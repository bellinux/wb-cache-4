40|$|Poster {{presentation}} - Session #: 38 : Abstract ID: 29228; Poster ID: 442 <b>Terrestrial</b> <b>pollution</b> and CO 2 -driven {{global warming}} are main threats to coral reefs ecosystems. Previous studies revealed the contrasting responses of reef building coral species to human-led changes. Increased sea surface temperature (SST) reduced coral annual extension in the Red Sea, whereas, <b>terrestrial</b> <b>pollution</b> increased extension in Indonesia. These two concurrent threats raise {{some questions about}} coral annual extension in the Anthropocene. Coral reefs in Chuuk lagoon have suffered from high anthropogenic impacts through the WWII and subsequent population growth, additionally, the SST increased by about 0. 5 °C over the same period. To assess {{the relative importance of}} these two factors in coral annual extension, we collected two coral cores of Porites sp. at Newman and Nepukos which are located at Weno island in Chuuk lagoon, Federated States of Micronesia. Age estimation based on band counts of x-radiograph indicated the first core encompasses the time-period 1938 - 2013 and the second core is estimated to include the entire 20 th century. According to correlation analyses, coral annual extension showed no correlation with SST and population density, however, significantly correlated with precipitation on the most recent half of the record. While the second core is still being analyzed, the preliminary results indicate increased human population and concomitant deforestation caused an influx of terrestrial pollutants and subsequently affect coral annual extension rather than global warming nearshore reef...|$|E
40|$|Space debris, an {{externality}} {{generated by}} expended launch vehicles and damaged satellites, reduces the expected value of space activities {{by increasing the}} probability of damaging existing satellites or other space vehicles. Unlike <b>terrestrial</b> <b>pollution,</b> debris created in the production process interacts with firms’ final products, and is, moreover, self-propagating: collisions between debris or extant satellites creates additional debris. We construct a formal model to explore private incentives to launch satellites and to mitigate space debris. The model predicts that, relative to the social optimum, firms launch too many satellites and choose technologies which create more debris than is socially optimal. We discuss remediation strategies and policies, and demonstrate that Pigovian taxes {{can be used to}} internalize the debris externality...|$|E

40|$|Along Korea's 11 542 km shoreline, {{there are}} 310 000 ha of coastal {{aquaculture}} areas. Mariculture is already practised in 110 000 ha, distributed mainly {{along the southern}} and western coasts.

Aferwards coastal industries developed well for at least two decades and, in 1994, aquaculture production amounted to 1 072 t, a quarter of total fisheries products, with an estimated value of US $ 900 million. This policy should be further strengthened after the inauguration of the Minishy of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries (MOMAF) in August 1996.

Continuous flow filtration through column of sand or brick powder was investigated for removal of total nitrogen, color, conductivity and COD caused by urine. Whilst brick powder demonstrates good filtration efficiency, sand is found to be inefficient for the intention.

40|$|This work {{represents}} one of very few studies showing intergenerational effects of <b>terrestrial</b> <b>pollution</b> with heavy metals in a terrestrial predatory invertebrate. We demonstrate that carabid beetles Pterostichus oblongopunctatus (Coleoptera, Carabidae) inhabiting metal polluted environment have altered life-history parameters in comparison to those from reference area populations. We observed decreased hatchability of eggs in field collected animals fed with uncontaminated food, which suggests that carabids from heavily polluted sites {{are not able to}} fully avoid the risk of secondary poisoning via contaminated prey. The adult fresh body mass of young imagines from the first laboratory generation reared in uncontaminated conditions was affected by pollution level at the sites of beetles' origin. However, we did not observe any effects of site contamination in the second laboratory generation. Therefore, we conclude that although genetic adaptation has not occurred in the populations chronically exposed to toxic metal concentrations, there is evidence of intergenerational maternal effects of metal pollution...|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} few years, a {{remarkable}} number of structurally unique and highly active metabolites has been published from marine bacteria, and especially marine actinomycetes have shown an im-pressive metabolic capacity. If these bacterial isolates are really indigenous to the marine environ-ment is, however, often not proven. After decades of research mainly on terrestrial microbes, the yearly output of the marine research has passed now its terrestrial counterpart. This chapter summa-rizes {{the development of the}} marine microbial research since the year 2000. In spite of the long and successful history of antibiotics of terrestrial origin, the search for marine microbial metabolites is even today a nearly untouched subject. The very first antibi-otic – mycophenolic acid (1) from a Penicillium spp. (Bentley, 2000) – was described as early as 1896 and has even found medical application long before the discovery of penicillin; the first marine antibiotic, pentabromopseudilin (2), was described {{more than half a century}} later (Burkholder et al., 1966; Hanessian et al., 1966; Lovel, 1966; Andersen et al., 1974). The reason for this unexpected fact is among others certainly the assumption of the past decades, that sea water is nearly sterile and that even microbes due to <b>terrestrial</b> <b>pollutions</b> cannot sur-vive for long in the sea. It is now a fact, however, that the water column of the oceans con-tains on the average 104 – 106 bacteria/ml, that is an estimated global weight of at least 1012 tons at a weight of 1 pg/bacterium and a volume of 1. 35 109 km 3 of the oceans!

40|$|Recent {{estimates}} put average coral cover {{across the}} Great Barrier Reef (GBR) at about 20 - 30 %. This {{is estimated to}} be a large reduction since the 1960 s. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act was enacted in 1975 and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA) set up shortly afterwards. So the question is: why has coral cover continued to decline when the GBR is being managed with a management regime often recognised as the best managed coral reef system in the world', based on a strong science-for-management ethic. The stressors which are known to be most responsible for the loss of coral cover (and general 'reef health') are <b>terrestrial</b> <b>pollution</b> including the link to outbreaks of crown of thorns starfish, fishing impacts and climate change. These have been established through a long and intensive research effort over the last 30 years. However the management response of the GBRMPA after 1975, while based on a strong science-for-management program, did not concentrate on these issues but instead on managing access through zoning with restrictions on fishing in very limited areas and tourism management. Significant action on fishing, including trawling, did not occur until the Trawl Management Plan of 2000 and the rezoning of the GBR Marine Park in 2004. Effective action on <b>terrestrial</b> <b>pollution</b> did not occur until the Australian Government Reef Rescue initiative which commenced in 2008. Effective action on climate change has yet to begin either nationally or globally. Thus {{it is not surprising that}} coral cover on the GBR has reduced to values similar to those seen in other coral reef areas in the world such as Indonesia and the Philippines. Science has always required long periods to acquire sufficient evidence to drive management action and hence there is a considerable lime lag between the establishment of scientific evidence and the introduction of effective management. It can still be credibly claimed that the GBR is the best managed coral reef system in the world but it must be realised that this is a relative assessment against other reef systems and management regimes and not an absolute claim for effective management...|$|E

40|$|In Southern California, <b>terrestrial</b> runoff <b>pollution</b> often drains {{directly}} onto the beach, degrading water quality and leading to increased beach closures each year. Beaches are a significant piston in California’s economic engine and beach closures can have significant economic impact on local communities. Runoff pollution can be localized, as from a storm drain, or can be more diffuse with many smaller, distributed sources. In either case, upon entering ocean waters, the pollution is first mixed, dispersed, and advected within the surfzone (the region of breaking waves). However, behavior of polluted waters upon entering the surfzone is not understood, and advancing this understanding is crucial to improved beach water quality.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that oil {{pollution}} in the marine environment may be caused by many different sources, including transport accidents, leakage of oil tanks and pipes, oil waste discharge, oil drilling, production, refineries, and transportation, and port loading and unloading activities. Without proper treatment, oil pollution in marine and <b>terrestrial</b> <b>pollution</b> may result in uncontrollable environmental damages. Various methods have been devoted in the past for remediating the oil spill in marine and coastal environment. Compared to physical and chemical methods, bioremediation have been proved as most effective method to cleanup oil spills with minimal or without problems. Bioremediation consists of bioaugmentation and biostimulation. Bioaugmentation (by adding microbial product to the polluted environment), in many bench scale and field studies, have been failed to remediate oil spills. Furthermore, it is expensive and needs specific technique. In other hand, biostimulation have been effective to degrade petroleum. Nutrient adding by using organic fertilizers (biostimulation) is a promising method to cleanup oil spill that should be developed This paper present an approach in modeling the quantity of nutrient required for in situ treatment. The modeling for estimating the material needed for the bioremediation is based on the same principles used for all chemical reactions, i. e. the ratio of reactants. The ratio is dictated by the stoichiometric equation. Based on the equation, and a hypothetical case study presented here shows that the modeling approach might be potentially used to estimate the time and nutrients required for the bioremediation.

40|$|Coastal {{fish populations}} are {{typically}} threatened by multiple human activities, including fishing pressure and run-off of <b>terrestrial</b> <b>pollution.</b> Linking multiple threats to their impacts on fish populations is challenging because the threats may influence a species directly, or indirectly, via its habitats and its interactions with other species. Here we examine spatial variation in abundance of coral reef fish across gradients of fishing pressure and turbidity in Fiji. We explicitly account for multiple pathways of influence {{to test the}} alternative hypotheses that (1) habitat moderates predation by providing shelter, so habitat loss only affects prey fish populations if there are abundant predators, (2) habitat change co-drives biomass of both prey and predator functional groups. We examined responses of 7 fish functional groups and found that habitat change co-drives both predator and prey responses to turbidity. Abundances of all functional groups were associated with changes in habitat cover; however, the responses of their habitats to turbidity were mixed. Planktivore and piscivore abundance were lower in areas of high turbidity, because cover of their preferred habitats was lower. Invertivore, browser and grazer abundance did not change strongly over the turbidity gradient, because different components of their habitats exhibited both increases and decreases with turbidity. The effects of turbidity on fish populations were minor in areas where fish populations were already depleted by fishing. These findings suggest that terrestrial run-off modifies the composition of reef fish communities indirectly by affecting the benthic habitats that reef fish use.

40|$|In {{modern life}} petroleum-based plastic has become {{indispensable}} {{due to its}} frequent use as an easily available and a low cost packaging and moulding material. However, its rapidly growing use is causing aquatic and <b>terrestrial</b> <b>pollution.</b> Under these circumstances, research and development for biodegradable plastic (bioplastics) is inevitable. Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), a type of microbial polyester that accumulates as a carbon/energy storage material in various microorganisms {{can be a good}} alternative. In this study, 23 cyanobacterial strains (15 heterocystous and 8 non-heterocystous) were screened for PHB production. The highest PHB (6. 44 % w/w of dry cells) was detected in Nostoc muscorum NCCU- 442 and the lowest in Spirulina platensis NCCU-S 5 (0. 51 % w/w of dry cells), whereas no PHB was found in Cylindrospermum sp., Oscillatoria sp. and Plectonema sp. Presence of PHB granules in Nostoc muscorum NCCU- 442 was confirmed microscopically with Sudan black B and Nile red A staining. Pretreatment of biomass with methanol: acetone: water: dimethylformamide [40 : 40 : 18 : 2 (MAD-I) ] with 2 h magnetic bar stirring followed by 30 h continuous chloroform soxhlet extraction acted as optimal extraction conditions. Optimized physicochemical conditions viz. 7. 5 pH, 30 °C temperature, 10 : 14 h light:dark periods with 0. 4 % glucose (as additional carbon source), 1. 0 gl- 1 sodium chloride and phosphorus deficiency yielded 26. 37 % PHB on 7 th day instead of 21 st day. Using FTIR, 1 H NMR and GC-MS, extracted polymer was identified as PHB. Thermal properties (melting temperature, decomposition temperatures etc.) of the extracted polymer were determined by TGA and DSC. Further, the polymer showed good tensile strength and young's modulus with a low extension to break ratio comparable to petrochemical plastic.

40|$|The {{construction}} {{and operation of}} offshore wind farms (OWF) in UK waters require an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) to be undertaken to assess and examine the environmental consequences of the development. Marine water and sediment quality (MWSQ) is often addressed within the EIA as a receptor likely to be impacted by such a development. The offshore location of wind farms and the relatively short-term activities associated with their construction suggest that {{the potential impact of}} their development on MWSQ is minimal; therefore it could be possible for the topic to be screened out at an earlier stage of the EIA process. Working in collaboration with Royal HaskoningDHV, this project has reviewed several OWF case studies to assess the extent of metal contamination in the seabed sediments. The review also included a comparison of sampling surveys, laboratory treatment methods and data obtained from the particle size analysis (PSA). An extensive literature review was also undertaken to investigate the relationship between sediment grain size and contamination levels in sediments, this was followed by an investigation as to whether this relationship existed in the survey results obtained from the case studies. The review highlighted a number of inconsistencies in how the topic of MWSQ is addressed in the EIA process for OWF. Metal contamination in offshore sediments, where sources of historical or current pollution could not be identified was relatively low; however metal contamination was much great in the near shore regions, suggesting <b>terrestrial</b> <b>pollution</b> sources are impacting the MWSQ in this region. These results suggest that in cases where pollution sources are absent, the undertaking of large scale surveys in the offshore region are unnecessary. A relationship between sediment grain size and contamination levels was observed in a number of the case studies, however there was a level of variance in the results, suggesting that this methodology would require further investigation if it were to be adopted as a preliminary survey method in the EIA process.

40|$|This {{investigation}} characterized karstic and nearshore environments of Bermuda {{to describe}} 1) behavior and periodicity of cave springs; 2) submarine spring water quality; and 3) nearshore marine seagrass density. Caves can be conduits for groundwater pollution where terrestrial anthropogenic processes leach nutrient enriched water into marine caves springs that flow directly into coastal waters. Seagrass {{may serve as}} an environmental indicator due to its susceptibility to anthropogenic pollution. In 2007, environmental water monitoring devices were moored {{at the entrance of}} coastal cave springs throughout Bermuda to retrieve data on water quality, flow volume, velocity and direction. Nutrients (nitrate, phosphate, nitrite, and ammonium) and fecal bacteria (Enterococcus spp. and Escherichia coli) were measured in each cave. To qualify a link between <b>terrestrial</b> <b>pollution</b> and the nearshore environment, seagrass density within 100 m from cave entrances were measured. Bermuda caves were tidally influenced. Caves in Harrington Sound showed a delayed tidal flux with smaller ranges due to the restricted tidal inlet. Four caves exhibited a 1 : 1 in:out flow ratio. Caves with an imbalance flow ratio could be influenced by additional entrances, connection to an alternate water body, or cave geometry. Cave water was similar between caves. Environmental parameters and nutrients changed together, excluding seasonal variations in temperature (17. 89 to 22. 94 degrees C). Higher nutrients and fecal coliforms within caves indicated sewage may be leaching into the subsurface ground water system. Three seagrass species were evenly distributed within patchy meadows. Densities ranged from 0. 91 to 4. 5 (on a Braun-Blanket Scale). Higher mean densities in Harrington Sound, suggested the enclosed, protected nature of the sound allowed for reduced wave and current action. Syringodium filiforme decreased in density towards the ocean signifying a direct influence of cave water on seagrass beds. Tidal in and out-flux allowed for a constantly changing environment suitable for a mixture of seagrass species. Higher dissolved inorganic nutrient concentrations were associated with locations lacking seagrass. This study found 1) cave springs connected groundwater and nearshore seagrass ecosystems; and 2) components associated with terrestrial sewage pollution (DIN, HPO 4 =, and Enterococcus spp.) were higher within caves than nearshore waters...|$|E

Four main causes are named for declining amphibian populations: loss of habitat (amphibians rely on both aquatic and <b>terrestrial</b> habitats), environmental <b>pollution</b> (including global climatic changes), diseases (fungal diseases in particular), and invasive species (predators and other pathogens) [2]. Amphibians may be exposed to various types of environmental contaminants such as various sources of unspecific anthropogenic pollution (waste water, deposits, air pollution), industrial or agricultural chemicals, or from traffic (directly or indirectly for example from salt used for de-icing) and climate change [3, 4]. Depending on their migration behavior and habitat selection, some amphibian species may be present on agricultural sites during times of fertilizer or pesticide applications and may thus be exposed to such chemicals [5, 6].|$|R

40|$|Abstract – Over {{the past}} two decades, soil ecotoxicologists have made strides in {{utilizing}} the basic concepts and advancements in soil zoology and ecology. They have applied the existing tools, and developed new ones to investigate how chemical contamination can affect soil ecosystems, including the degradation or destruction of soil quality and habitats or the diminishment of belowground biodiversity. Soil ecotoxicologists are applying a suite of standard protocols, originally developed as laboratory tests with single chemicals (e. g., pesticides), and further enhancing both the approaches and protocols {{for the assessment of}} contaminated lands. However, ecological relevance of some approaches remains unresolved. The authors discuss the main challenges for a coherent ecotoxicological assessment of soil ecosystems amid contaminated lands, and provide recommendations on how to integrate the effects of physical and chemical soil properties, the variations in the diversity of soil invertebrates, and the interactions among organisms of various trophic levels.

40|$|Airborne {{measurements}} of DMS and H 2 S were made off {{the east coast}} of the United States and over the tropical Atlantic off Brazil. Samples were collected through a fluorinated ethylene propylene Teflon inlet manifold. Dimethyl sulfide (DMS) was preconcentrated onto gold wool and analyzed by gas chromatography/flame photometric detection. H 2 S was collected on AgNO 3 -impregnated filters and determined by fluorescence quenching. Use of a new scrubber material (cotton) to remove negative interference on DMS measurements was investigated. Comparison with a Na 2 CO 3 /Anakrom scrubber gave good overall agreement. Only under extreme conditions, e. g., on flight 9 (continental air mass, low humidity, high O 3, and low DMS values) did Na 2 CO 3 show noticeable loss of DMS compared to cotton. On most flights, especially in marine air masses with high humidity and relatively low O 3, the results from both scrubbers agreed well {{with each other and with}} other instruments used during the intercalibration. Off the U. S. East Coast, DMS levels showed strong dependence on air mass origin with high values (up to 83 ppt) in marine tropical air masses and low values (10 - 20 ppt) in continental and polar air. Over the tropical Atlantic, DMS ranged over 20 - 100 ppt in the mixed layer. Nighttime values were a factor of 1. 6 - 2. 3 higher than daytime levels. DMS decreased with altitude to less than 1 ppt at 4000 m. H 2 S in the mixed layer off the U. S. East Coast ranged from 10 to 200 ppt. Significant influence from <b>terrestrial</b> and <b>pollution</b> sources was evident. H 2 S in air masses originating over the eastern seaboard was much higher than in continental polar air or over the remote tropical continents. In contrast, over the tropical Atlantic, concentrations were very low (5 - 10 ppt), typical of truly marine air. Night/day ratios were about 1. 4. No significant geographical variability was seen in H 2 S levels over the tropical Atlantic. The correlation of atmospheric Rn- 222 and H 2 S was significant, with both being higher off the U. S. East Coast than over the tropical Atlantic...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY Coral reef {{ecosystems}} are global biodiversity hotspots {{that depend on}} the massive calcium carbonate structures mainly deposited by scleractinian (i. e., “hard”) corals. Scleractinian coral distribution is primarily limited by sea-surface temperature, light, depth, ocean pH, sea water salinity, nutrients and sediment loads. These {{ecosystems are}} currently threatened by localized stresses such as overfishing and destructive fishing practices, <b>pollution,</b> <b>terrestrial</b> nutrient and sediment run-off, but are increasing impacted by direct and indirect impacts of rising CO 2 concentrations and climate change. Coral reefs provide {{a broad range of}} ecosystems services with high socio-economic value: tourism, fisheries (food and employment), nutrient cycling, climate regulation, protection of the shoreline and other ecosystems (e. g. mangroves), and constitute the habitat {{for a wide range of}} species. Rising atmospheric CO 2 concentrations have already led to a slight acidification of ocean surface waters and are projected to lead to levels of acidification that will severely impede calcium carbonate accretion. Global warming associated with greenhouse gas emissions has resulted in increased sea-surface temperatures, leading to frequent coral bleaching. Acidification and the increased frequency of local and global disturbances are projected to seriously degrade coral reefs world-wide. If current trends continue coral reef ecosystems may undergo regime shifts from coral to sponge or algae dominated habitats. The tipping point for this phase shift is estimated to be a sea-surface temperature increase of 2 °C and/or atmospheric CO 2 concentrations above 480 ppm (estimated to occur by 2050). Shifts in dominance from corals to sponges or algae would have dramatic consequences for coral reef communities. The reduction of habitat complexity through erosion would reduce the niches for numerous species that rely on corals for shelter, food, substrate, settlement and nursery. In order to avoid this phase shift, urgent local and global action is necessary. Reducing local stresses, such as the reduction of terrestrial inputs of sediment, nutrients and pollutants, is paramount to promote a higher resistance to disturbance and ensure ecosystem resilience. Fisheries require the sustainable management of marine species and should aim to conserve key functional groups such as herbivores that control algae growth. Marine protected areas networks should be designed and implemented to provide refuges and serve as larval sources to replenish harvested areas outside reserves. Globally, urgent and ambitious action to reduce CO 2 emissions is necessary to limit sea surface temperature increase and water acidification...|$|R

It {{is of paramount importance}} to implement suitable monitoring procedures to assess the fate of pesticides, their transfer to groundwater and the potential effects of water quality on aquatic and <b>terrestrial</b> organisms. Diffuse <b>pollution</b> is a significant water management issue in France, imposed notably through the European Water Framework Directive. The effects of past and present land-use practices may take decades to become apparent in groundwater. This is why it remains a challenge to link the current pesticide pressure and observed impact on groundwater quality. In other words, the evaluation of the significance of measured parameters is not trivial. The alluvial domain of the Ariège River (about 538 km 2) is an unconfined aquifer, the thin thickness of vadose zone making it vulnerable to contamination. Due to intensive agriculture in this area, related to corn cultivation in particular, groundwater quality is affected by pesticides and some of their metabolites. Monthly monitoring of water quality at 16 water points (wells and springs) in the plain was performed from March 2009 to May 2011 and from March 2012 to November 2014. It includes some 50 organic molecules, major ions such as nitrate and other non-conservative parameters (pH, temperature, redox potential). For each of the sampling point, ground water catchment delineation was performed, based on an existing piezometric map. Land-uses were known thanks to farmer declarations. Regional data on practises were available. A strong spatial variability of the contamination was demonstrated, with predominance of degradation products over parent molecules in some locations, and also showed a strong temporal variability. Short time transfers from soil into groundwater were observed locally. High transmissivity of the aquifer enabled rapid renewal of the water in the saturated zone. For some parent compounds having a very short presence in groundwater, it is therefore quite easy to link application and presence. Annual variability of concentrations appeared driven by both land-uses and climatic conditions. But, for others molecules and notably metabolites, long-term monitoring illustrated the possible lag-time between application and impact. Thus polar metabolites can be detected not only after application but also during recharge events coming next year and sometimes years after. Metabolites of withdrawn molecules illustrated clearly this aspect. In addition, for a compound recently used close to a well, highest concentrations were quantified after several years and not the first year of uses. As for parent molecules, hydrodynamic affected evidently observed concentrations...|$|R
40|$|Coral reef {{ecosystems}} {{around the}} world face a number of threats, including ocean acidification, increased ocean temperatures due to anthropogenic global warming (AGW), increased disease outbreaks, crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks, <b>terrestrial</b> sedimentation, eutrophication, <b>pollution,</b> and fishing pressure. At the same time, coral reef ecosystems provide valuable direct and indirect economic and social benefits {{to millions of people}} worldwide. However, the intensity and spatial distribution of threats are likely to change with increasing human population and economic development, and thus understanding how multiple stressors may interact and affect coral reefs – particularly in the face of incomplete knowledge about these stressors – is an issue of pressing importance. This thesis aims to explore and advance the understanding of interactions between multiple stressors and their effects as they pertain to coral reefs generally and the Great Barrier Reef specifically. I review several of the components that are integral to this issue, including: stressors and stress ecology, research to date on the issue of multiple stressors and coral reefs, the multiple threats from climate change to coral reefs, and approaches to modelling and managing multiple stressors. The overall aim of this thesis is to quantitatively evaluate the importance of multiple stressor interactions to coral reef ecosystems and to assess alternative management approaches to mitigating the effects of potentially increased prevalence and severity of these stressors. I do this through both assessing the state of existing knowledge as well as by using new approaches to model stressors and stressor effects {{within the context of the}} GBR. In addition, I seek to provide an example of how these effects can be conceptualized and managed more effectively in the face of uncertain knowledge and incomplete data. The specific research objectives of my thesis are as follows: 1. To synthesize the available knowledge of multiple stressors on coral reefs; 2. To use the occurrence of bleaching and disease in the GBR as a case study to determine the spatial and temporal overlap of these stressors; 3. To use expert knowledge to identify key uncertainties and knowledge gap(s) regarding multiple stressor interactions on coral reef systems; 4. To apply expert-elicited knowledge about stressors and stressor interactions on the GBR to map potential threats to reefs under a variety of different climate change and management scenarios. Chapter 2 addresses research objective 1 by using a formal literature search to provide the foundation for a qualitative and selected quantitative meta-analysis of multiple-stressors as they pertains to coral reef ecosystems, and by examining the evidence for the prevalence of synergistic, antagonistic, and additive interactions between stressors. Here I investigate stressor interactions in two ways: first by examining stressor interactions with other stressors, and secondly by looking at potentially synergistic effects between two or more stressors on a response variable (where stressors interact to produce an effect that is greater than purely additive). For stressor-stressor interactions, I found 176 studies that examined interactions between at least two stressors. Applying network analysis to analyse relationships between stressors, I found that pathogens were exacerbated by more co-stressors than any other stressor, while sedimentation, storms, and water temperature directly affected the largest number of other stressors. Pathogens, nutrients, and crown-of-thorns starfish were the most-influenced stressors. In terms of responses to multiple stressors, I found 187 studies that examined the effects of two or more stressors on a third dependent variable. The interaction of irradiance and temperature on corals has been the subject of more research than any other combination of stressors, with many studies reporting a synergistic effect on coral symbiont photosynthetic performance. Second, I performed a quantitative meta-analysis of existing literature on the interaction between temperature and irradiance. Although the sample size was small, I found that the mean effect size of combined treatments was statistically indistinguishable from a purely additive interaction. This chapter provides evidence that considerable gaps remain in our knowledge regarding numerous stressor interactions and effects, and that the available evidence is inconclusive on whether synergistic effects are widespread in coral reef systems. Chapter 3 addresses research objective 2 by using data from the AIMS Long-term Monitoring Program (LTMP) to examine the spatial and temporal overlap of bleaching and disease in the GBR. Coral bleaching and disease have often been hypothesized to be mutually reinforcing or co-occurring, but much of the research supporting this has only drawn an implicit connection through common environmental predictors. I examine whether an explicit relationship between white syndrome and bleaching exists using assemblage-level monitoring data from up to 112 sites on the reef slopes spread throughout the GBR over 11 years of monitoring. None of the temperature metrics commonly used to predict mass bleaching performed strongly when applied to these data, and the inclusion of bleaching as a predictor did not improve model in predicting white syndrome outbreaks. Conversely, the inclusion of white syndrome as a predictor did not improve models of bleaching. Evidence for spatial co-occurrence of bleaching and white syndrome at the assemblage level in this dataset was also very weak. These results suggest the hypothesized relationship between bleaching and disease events may be weaker than previously thought, and more likely to be driven by common responses to environmental stressors, rather than directly facilitating one another. Chapter 4 addresses research objective 3 by exploring the use of Bayesian Belief Networks (hereafter BBNs) in conjunction with expert elicitation to determine the degree of expert consensus about the greatest threats to the GBR, and assessing the degree of confidence that experts have about the effects of various stressors both alone and in combination. BBNs are finding increasing application in adaptive ecosystem management where data are limited and uncertainty is high. I used a formal expert-elicitation process to obtain estimates of outcomes associated with a variety of scenarios in the GBR that combined stressors both within and outside the control of local managers. Among consulted experts, there was much stronger consensus about certain stressor effects - such as between temperature anomalies and bleaching – than others, such as the relationship between water quality and coral health. In general, models generated from the mean responses from experts predicted that climate change effects could potentially overshadow the mitigating effects of management actions to reduce local stressors. Chapter 5 addresses research objective 4 by implementing the model developed in Chapter 4 in a spatial way through the use of several scenarios. Coral reefs are one example of an ecosystem where management of local stressors may be a way of mitigating or delaying the effects of climate change. In this chapter, I use a combination of an expert-elicited BBN and empirical, spatial environmental data to examine how hypothetical scenarios of climate change and local management would result in different outcomes for coral reefs on the GBR. I also assess whether reefs within the existing protected area network differ in their predicted probability of decline from reefs outside the protected area network. Parameterizing the BBN using the mean responses from my expert pool resulted in predictions of limited efficacy of local management in combating the effects of climate change; however, there was considerable variability in expert responses; thus, I also examine the effect that using optimistic versus pessimistic expert responses has on the model predictions of coral cover decline on the GBR. Many reefs within the central GBR appear to be at risk of further decline, but further parameterization of the model as data and knowledge become available will improve predictive power. This approach serves as a proof of concept for subsequent work that can fine-tune parameters and explore uncertainties in predictions of responses to management. My thesis thus addresses two critical elements that are often missing from studies examining the conservation implications of multiple stressors (especially on coral reefs) : interactions between stressor/stressor effects and assessing the effect of different management options on these interactions...|$|R
