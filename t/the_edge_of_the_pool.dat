25|$|After filming was {{completed}} on Fiesta, Williams {{appeared in the}} romance This Time for Keeps (1947) with singer Johnnie Johnston. In 1948, Williams {{signed a contract with}} swimwear company Cole of California to appear as their spokesperson, and Williams and the other swimmers in her films wore Cole swimsuits. Since the aqua-musicals were an entirely new genre, the studio's costume designers had little experience creating practical swimsuits. William's plaid flannel swimsuit for Thrill of a Romance (1945) was so heavy that she was dragged {{to the bottom of the}} pool, and had to unzip the suit, swimming naked to <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> to avoid drowning. Cole swimsuits used latex, which meant zippers were no longer necessary. While filming Skirts Ahoy (1952), Williams discovered that members of the WAVES program received thin, cotton, shapeless swimsuits as part of their uniforms. Williams modeled a Cole swimsuit for the Secretary of the Navy and explained that the new swimsuits helped support women's figures. The United States Navy ordered 50,000 suits immediately.|$|E
