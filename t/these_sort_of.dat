25|$|One of {{the most}} {{relevant}} uses for the mammalian orthoreoviruses are the manipulation of their oncolytic properties for their use in cancer treatments. This particular use of reoviruses was discovered in 1995 by Dr Patrick Lee who discovered these viruses could kill those cells that contained an over-activated Ras pathway, often a hallmark of cancerous cells. These viruses are particularly ideal for <b>these</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> therapies because they are self-limiting while simultaneously harnessing the ability to induce apoptosis in tumor cells exclusively. One of the more widely used strains for these anti-cancer clinical trials is the serotype 3 dearing strain, Resolysin, used in phase I-III trials. A variety of cancers have been treated with this therapy, either alone or in tandem with others, including multiple myeloma, ovarian epithelial, and pancreatic cancers. A recent clinical trial demonstrated that mammalian orthoreovirus was effective in inducing apoptosis in hypoxic prostate tumor cells with hopes of success in clinical trials.|$|E

500|$|During the investigation, {{the matter}} of Cho's court-ordered mental health {{treatment}} was also examined to determine its outcome. Virginia investigators learned after a review of Cho's medical records that he never complied with the order for the mandated mental health treatment as an outpatient. The investigators also found that neither the court nor New River Valley Community Services exercised oversight of his case to determine his compliance with the order. In response to questions about Cho's case, New River Valley Community Services maintained that its facility was never named in the court order as the provider for his mental health treatment, and its responsibility ended once he was discharged from its care after the court order. In addition, Christopher Flynn, director of the Cook Counseling Center at Virginia Tech, mentioned that {{the court did not}} notify his office that Cho was required to seek outpatient mental health treatment. Flynn added that, [...] "When a court gives a mandatory order that someone get outpatient treatment, that order is to the individual, not an agency...

[...] "So her thing is instead of balancing work and pleasure, it’s balancing crime and pleasure." [...] Cross stated, [...] "I think we’ll figure out if that’s really a big love for her or if she’s able to let it go." [...] Jonathan Cake, who appeared as Chuck in four episodes during the seventh season, was promoted to series regular with this episode. On the relationship between Bree and Chuck, Cake stated: [...] "As a detective, he's sort of drawn to this woman who seems both quite proper and conservative and yet can't seem to stop herself from being drawn into <b>these</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> crazy, lurid scenarios. There's a sort of wild streak in Bree somewhere that he thinks is really interesting." [...] To prepare for the role, Cake watched key episodes of the series focusing on Bree's previous relationships.|$|E

500|$|William Moseley as Peter Pevensie. In a {{departure}} from the novel, Peter has a rivalry with Caspian. Moseley explained, [...] "Peter's got his own issues to deal with, and Caspian's got his own issues to deal with, and when neither is willing to compromise, there's bound to be friction. Peter came back to Narnia expecting to be king again and that everyone would do as he said, and Caspian is unwilling to let him take over, so that causes some of it. That's really what happens. And it's a lot about humility. I think they both have to learn a certain humility [...] and that's really what a great king needs is to be humble, to listen to his people, to be willing to compromise, and they start off as <b>these</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> angry teenagers, and become kings at the end." [...] In real life, the two actors got on well together. Moseley also stated that he identified with Peter, having gone back to school between shooting both films. He trained for three months in New York City to improve his performance and his physicality.|$|E

Authors of the Malleus Maleficarum strongly established the link between witchcraft and women by proclaiming greater likelihood for women to be addicted to [...] "evil".
