50|$|It was {{announced}} on 12 September 2016 the series would return in 2017 with an extended series which will see 10 couples be wed. During the fourth season, 10 female contestants are matched with their ‘perfect’ male partner {{by a panel}} of experts. In the first episode, <b>two</b> <b>couples</b> (Cheryl & Jonathan, Sean & Susan) met and wed. In the second episode, another <b>two</b> <b>couples</b> (Michael & Scarlett, Anthony & Nadia) met and wed. In the third episode, <b>two</b> more <b>couples</b> (Simon & Alene, Andrew & Vanessa) met and wed. In the fourth episode, another <b>two</b> <b>couples</b> (Andrew & Lauren, John & Deborah) met and wed. In the fifth episode, the final <b>two</b> <b>couples</b> (Michelle & Jesse, Sharon & Nick) met and wed.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, the {{previously}} introduced fuzzy modeling method {{is used to}} model the input impedance of <b>two</b> <b>coupled</b> dipole antennas in the echelon form. The initial data of <b>two</b> <b>coupled</b> dipole antennas in the parallel and collinear form, which are required for the model, are obtained using the MoM (Method of Moments). Then, the knowledge of <b>two</b> <b>coupled</b> dipole antennas in the echelon form is easily predicted based on the knowledge of <b>two</b> <b>coupled</b> dipole antennas in the parallel and collinear form {{and the concept of}} spatial membership functions. Comparing the results of the proposed model with MoM shows an excellent agreement with a vanishingly short execution time comparing with MoM. 1...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} {{finite element method}} (FEM) to {{investigate}} the quasi-static analysis of two dimensional (2 D) shielded <b>two</b> <b>coupled</b> stripline structures for microelectronic devices.   In the proposed method, we specifically determine the values of capacitance per unit length and inductance per unit length of shielded <b>two</b> vertically <b>coupled</b> striplines and shielded <b>two</b> <b>coupled</b> striplines embedded in dielectric material.  Extensive simulation results are presented, and some comparative results are given by other methods and {{found them to be}} in excellent agreement. Furthermore, we determine the quasi-TEM spectral for the potential distribution of these shielded <b>two</b> <b>coupled</b> striplines. </p...|$|R

50|$|The Case: The bottom <b>two</b> <b>couples</b> are {{automatically}} in {{risk of being}} eliminated. The audience members have the entire week (Saturday to Saturday) to vote for their favorite couple. The sentenced couples must induce people to vote for them. On Saturday the bottom <b>two</b> <b>couples</b> are sent to duel.|$|R
50|$|The {{points for}} judges' score and public vote are then added together, and the <b>two</b> <b>couples</b> with the fewest points {{are placed in}} the bottom <b>two</b> (if <b>two</b> <b>couples</b> have equal points, the points from the public vote are given precedence). As with the {{previous}} series, the bottom <b>two</b> <b>couples</b> will have to perform a dance-off on the results show. Based on that performance alone, each judge then votes on which couple should stay and which couple should leave, with Goodman (as head judge) having the last and casting vote.|$|R

The <b>two</b> <b>couples</b> who gained the least votes, each week, had to sing again, this time a 'Grease' classic. The judges then eliminated one of those <b>two</b> <b>couples.</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{numerical}} simulation of <b>two</b> <b>coupled</b> Navier-Stokes flows, using operator-splitting and optimization-based nonoverlapping domain decomposition methods. The model problem consists of <b>two</b> Navier-Stokes fluids <b>coupled,</b> through a common interface, by a nonlinear transmission condition. Numerical experiments {{are carried out}} with <b>two</b> <b>coupled</b> fluids; one with an initial linear profile {{and the other in}} rest.

50|$|Note: The couples were {{randomly}} {{divided into four}} teams, each consisting of <b>two</b> <b>couples.</b> Every team performed an unlearned dance. Instead of scoring, the judges picked the better of <b>two</b> <b>couples</b> in every performance. The winners were safe for next week, while the losers had to perform another routine, which they had not done before.|$|R
