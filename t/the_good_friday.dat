5|$|The RIRA's {{objective}} is a united Ireland by forcing {{the end of}} British sovereignty over Northern Ireland {{through the use of}} physical force. The organisation rejects the Mitchell Principles and <b>the</b> <b>Good</b> <b>Friday</b> Agreement, comparing the latter to the 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty which resulted in the partition of Ireland. The organisation aims to uphold an uncompromising form of Irish republicanism and opposes any political settlement that falls short of Irish unity and independence.|$|E

5|$|The {{third section}} {{discusses}} {{the rulers of}} secular society and their flaws. The fourth, which is a formal section, deploys a series of Baroque paradoxes {{in the context of}} <b>the</b> <b>Good</b> <b>Friday</b> mass. This past manner is regarded ironically by the poet in the fifth section as he looks back on his period of experimentation in 'the years of l'entre deux guerres as 'largely wasted'. He welcomes approaching old age as a new opportunity to find renewal, although it might only be a rediscovery of 'what has been lost and found and lost again'.|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} {{following}} Labour's 1997 election victory, referendums {{were held in}} Scotland and Wales regarding devolution. There was a clear majority supporting devolution in Scotland and a narrower majority in Wales; Scotland received a stronger degree of devolution than Wales. The Labour government passed laws in 1998 to establish a Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly, the first elections for these were held in 1999. Blair attempted to continue peace negotiations in Northern Ireland by offering {{the creation of a}} regional parliament and government. In 1998, <b>the</b> <b>Good</b> <b>Friday</b> Agreement was made, which allowed for a 108-member elected assembly and a power-sharing arrangement between nationalists and unionists. Blair was personally involved in these negotiations.|$|E
5|$|María del Carmen, nicknamed Lita, {{was born}} in 1838. She had met Betances when she was 10, and Betances became {{instantly}} fond of her. Once he returned to Puerto Rico from his medical studies he requested the necessary ecclesiastical permissions to marry her (due {{to the degree of}} consanguinity between them), which were granted in Rome (then part of the Papal States) after an extended delay. Their marriage was supposed to occur on May 5, 1859 in Paris, but Lita fell sick with typhus and died at the Mennecy house of Dr. Pierre Lamire, a friend from Betances' medical school days, on April 22, 1859 (<b>the</b> <b>Good</b> <b>Friday</b> of that year).|$|E

5|$|Other groups, on {{both the}} unionist side and the {{nationalist}} side, participated in violence and a period known as the Troubles began. Over 3,600 deaths resulted over the subsequent three decades of conflict. Owing to the civil unrest during the Troubles, the British government suspended home rule in 1972 and imposed direct rule. There were several unsuccessful attempts to end the Troubles politically, such as the Sunningdale Agreement of 1973.

In the lead-up to the referendum the Irish and British governments issued a joint statement saying that they did not regard the proposed constitutional change as affecting the British-Irish Agreement (this being the inter-governmental component of <b>the</b> <b>Good</b> <b>Friday</b> Agreement).
