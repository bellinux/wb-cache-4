40|$|Two {{electrode}} configurations {{were tested}} in an electric-arc wind tunnel at the NASA Lewis Research Center. The results indicated approximately the same heat-loss rate per unit of arc power input {{for each of the}} configurations. Measured heat-loss rates were on the order of 40 percent of the arc power input. Nearly all this loss occurred at the anode. The power input and arc current limitations of the electrodes appear to be the critical design factors. Up to now, the maximum power to the stream has been 115 kilowatts with a cooled <b>tungsten</b> <b>cathode</b> and a cooled cylindrical anode incorporating a magnetic field. The maximum power input to this anode could not be established with the cooled <b>tungsten</b> <b>cathode</b> because cathode failures occurred at a gross power level of approximately 175 kilowatts. It was necessary to use a graphite cathode to seek the limitation of the anode. The results indicated that the anode limitation was primarily a function of arc current rather than power input. The anode was successfully operated at a power of 340 kilowatts at 1730 amperes; however, the anode failed with a power input of 324 kilowatts and a current of 2140 amperes. The magnetic flux density at the time of failure was 0. 32 weber per square meter, or 3200 gauss. The graphite cathode was used only to establish the anode limitation; further investigation of graphite cathodes was discontinued because of the large amount of stream contamination associated with this type of electrode...|$|E

Furthermore, an investigation was conducted into the feasibility of collecting titanium metal from the dissociated TiCl$ sb 4 $ molecule in the plasmagas. The titanium metal was collected in a molten bath, which also served as the anode in the transferred arc system. Three anode bath compositions were used in this study. Two of them, namely titanium and zirconium, were not able to reduce recombined titanium subchlorides in the bath. The third aluminum, was a reducing bath.

On the other hand, the surface temperature of flat-tip cathodes operating in helium and pointed-tip cathodes operating in either helium or argon are near the boiling point of tungsten.
