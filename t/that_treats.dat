5|$|She {{identifies}} the UN as the book's villain and criticizes the UN's practise of moral equivalency <b>that</b> <b>treats</b> both sides equally even though {{one side is}} clearly dominant and brutally oppressive. It results in the requirement of its personnel to remain neutral but Off questions how a peacekeeper can remain neutral while watching people being killed. The book treats this as a reality of international relations, which places precedence on state sovereignty over human rights, and a factor in making the UN slow, ineffectual, and inappropriately bureaucratic. She notes that some peacekeepers cope by demonizing all sides which helps diminish the sense of impotence in being unable to intervene.|$|E
5|$|The Avalanche {{chose not}} to re-sign Fleury, and he joined the New York Rangers on a three-year {{contract}} worth $21million that included a club option for a fourth year at $7million. He touched off a wave of anger on signing with the Rangers when he claimed he was unappreciated in Calgary, comments he later stated were directed at the Flames' owners and not the team's fans, who he said always supported him. Fleury's first year in Manhattan was a disappointment. He scored only 15goals in 1999–2000, struggling {{under the pressure of}} trying to lead the Rangers into the playoffs and adapting to life in New York. After the season, he voluntarily entered a league-operated program <b>that</b> <b>treats</b> substance abuse and emotional problems, though he denied that either had any effect on his play.|$|E

25|$|In his Divina Commedia, however, Dante {{changes his}} view to another <b>that</b> <b>treats</b> the Adamic {{language}} {{as the product}} of Adam.

Dante concludes (Paradiso XXVI) that Hebrew is a derivative of the language of Adam. In particular, the chief Hebrew name for God in scholastic tradition, El, must be derived of a different Adamic name for God, which Dante gives as I.|$|E
25|$|Cation {{exchange}} processes {{have previously}} been investigated {{as a potential}} treatment for acid mine drainage. The principle is that an ion exchange resin can remove potentially toxic metals (cationic resins), or chlorides, sulfates and uranyl sulfate complexes (anionic resins) from mine water. Once the contaminants are adsorbed, the exchange sites on resins must be regenerated, which typically requires acidic and basic reagents and generates a brine that contains the pollutants in a concentrated form. A South African company that won the 2013 IChemE (ww.icheme.org) award for water management and supply (treating AMD) have developed a patented ion-exchange process <b>that</b> <b>treats</b> mine effluents (and AMD) economically.|$|E

Many recent open source molecular biology packages have built-in facilities that determine the volume accessible to ions in a protein system. The Adaptive Poisson Boltzmann Solver (APBS) scheme has been incorporated to BioMOCA to obtain the accessible volume region and therefore partition the simulation domain into continuous regions.|$|E

25|$|Vasopressin receptors {{activated}} by vasopressin are {{found on the}} basolateral membrane of the cells lining the collecting ducts of the kidneys. Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage(aSAH) results in hyponatremia which leads to water retention and antidiuretic hormone release causing increase in intracranial pressure and formation of cerebral edema. This can be prevented by administration of conivaptan, a safe FDA approved drug <b>that</b> <b>treats</b> euvolemic hyponatremia. Through the process of aquaresis, conivapten which is a vasopressin receptor antagonist improves serum sodium concentration while eliminating free water without having any negative effect on systolic blood pressure and pulse rate. Since it can decrease cerebral volume and ICP, it has a potential to treat many forms of cerebral edema.|$|E
25|$|Citizens of low- {{and middle-income}} {{countries}} (LMICs) often have higher mortality rates from injury. These countries accounted for 89% of all deaths from injury worldwide. Many {{of these countries}} {{do not have access}} to sufficient surgical care and many do not have a trauma system in place. In addition, most LMICs do not have a pre-hospital care system <b>that</b> <b>treats</b> injured persons initially and transports them to hospital quickly, resulting in most casualty paients being transported by private vehicles. Also, their hospitals lack the appropriate equipment, organizational resources, or trained staff. By 2020, the amount of trauma-related deaths is expected to decline in high-income countries, while in low- to middle-income countries it is expected to increase.|$|E
25|$|Jordan's first {{wastewater}} treatment plant was established in 1968 in Ain Ghazal near Amman (the plant now serves as a pre-treatment plant for the As-Samra plant). The construction of other treatment plants started in the early 1980s. The total number of treatment plants was 28 as of 2013, treating about 324,000 m3 per day (118 million m3/year), or about 98% of the collected wastewater. By far the largest treatment plant is the As-Samra plant <b>that</b> <b>treats</b> the wastewater of Amman-Zarqa, accounting for about 80% of all wastewater treated. The plant initially used the stabilization pond technology, but was rebuilt using the activated sludge technology in 2008 under a Build-Operate-Transfer contract signed in 2002. In June 2012 the government signed a contract {{for the expansion of}} the treatment plant to a capacity of 365,000 m3. Water is reused mainly for irrigation in the Jordan Valley, with some reuse for irrigation in the Highlands and limited industrial reuse in Aqaba.|$|E

40|$|AIM:To {{compare the}} efficacies of {{subconjunctival}} bevacizumab, ranibizumab, and pegaptanib sodium injections for the inhibition of corneal neovascularization in an experimental rat model. METHODS:Sixteen corneas of 16 rats were chemically cauterized and randomized into four groups:bevacizumab group <b>that</b> <b>treated</b> with 0. 05 mL/ 1. 25 mg bevacizumab, ranibizumab group <b>that</b> <b>treated</b> with 0. 05 mL/ 0. 5 mg ranibizumab, pegaptanib group <b>that</b> <b>treated</b> with 0. 05 mL/ 0. 15 mg pegaptanib sodium, and control group <b>that</b> <b>treated</b> with 0. 05 mL saline solution. Digital {{photographs of the}} corneas were taken and analyzed using an image analysis software program. All corneas were excised and examined histologically on the 15 th day. RESULTS: Each treatment group had significantly less neovascularized corneal areas and fewer blood vessels {{than the control group}} (all P 0. 05). CONCLUSION:Subconjunctival bevacizumab, ranibizumab, and pegaptanib sodium were effective with no corneal epitheliopathy for inhibiting corneal neovascularization after corneal burn in rats.

500|$|Ellsworth Monkton Toohey is Roark's antagonist. He is Rand's {{personification}} of evilthe most active and self-aware villain {{in any of}} her novels. Toohey is a socialist, and represents the spirit of collectivism more generally. He styles himself as representative of {{the will of the}} masses, but his actual desire is for power over others. He controls individual victims by destroying their sense of self-worth, and seeks broader power (over [...] "the world", as he declares to Keating in a moment of candor) by promoting the ideals of ethical altruism and a rigorous egalitarianism <b>that</b> <b>treats</b> all people and achievements as equally valuable. Rand used her memory of the British democratic socialist Harold Laski to help her imagine what Toohey would do in a given situation. She attended a New York lecture by Laski as part of gathering material for the novel, following which she changed the physical appearance of the character to be similar to that of Laski. New York intellectuals Lewis Mumford and Clifton Fadiman also helped inspire the character.|$|E
500|$|Most {{scholars}} do {{not currently}} {{believe that the}} Catalogue should be considered the work of Hesiod, but questions about the poem's authenticity have not lessened its interest {{for the study of}} literary, social and historical topics. As a Hesiodic work <b>that</b> <b>treats</b> in depth the Homeric world of the heroes, the Catalogue offers a transition between the divine sphere of the Theogony and the terrestrial focus of the Works and Days by virtue of its subjects' status as demigods. Given the poem's concentration upon heroines in addition to heroes, it provides evidence for the roles and perceptions of women in Greek literature and society during the period of its composition and popularity. Greek aristocratic communities, the ruling elite, traced their lineages back to the heroes of epic poetry; thus the Catalogue, a veritable [...] "map of the Hellenic world in genealogical terms," [...] preserves much information about a complex system of kinship associations and hierarchies that continued to have political importance long after the Archaic period.
