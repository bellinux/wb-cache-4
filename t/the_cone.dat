5|$|Some active subwoofers use a servo {{feedback}} mechanism {{based on}} cone movement which modifies the signal {{sent to the}} voice coil. The servo feedback signal is derived from {{a comparison of the}} input signal to the amplifier versus the actual motion of <b>the</b> <b>cone.</b> The usual source of the feedback signal is a few turns of voice coil attached to <b>the</b> <b>cone</b> or a microchip-based accelerometer placed on <b>the</b> <b>cone</b> itself. An advantage of a well-implemented servo subwoofer design is reduced distortion making smaller enclosure sizes possible. The primary disadvantages are cost and complexity.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>cones</b> are 3 - 7 cm long. <b>The</b> <b>cones</b> have prickles on the scales.|$|R
5000|$|Usually {{less than}} 1 m thick folded lava flows of gray colour {{are found in}} the field, {{containing}} xenoliths and scoriaceous material from <b>the</b> <b>cones.</b> In two of <b>the</b> <b>cones</b> were erupted at the base of <b>the</b> <b>cones</b> by dykes. In <b>the</b> northernmost <b>cone,</b> two northeastern lava flows were erupted above each other. The lower flow (900 x 3000 m wide and long) is thinner and contains pyroxene phenocrysts, the upper one has a smaller extent (1200 m long) and is dominated by olivine. On its western margin, it borders a lineament that cuts through <b>the</b> <b>cones.</b> <b>The</b> eastern <b>cone</b> has no less than four lava flows dominated by olivine, one of which is 2.5 km long.|$|R
50|$|Both {{the above}} {{accounts}} described {{a method of}} extracting the seeds from <b>the</b> green <b>cones.</b> Another method is to leave <b>the</b> <b>cones</b> on <b>the</b> trees until they are dry and brown, then beat <b>the</b> <b>cones</b> with a stick, knocking <b>the</b> <b>cones</b> loose or <b>the</b> seeds loose from <b>the</b> <b>cones</b> which then {{fall to the ground}} where they can be collected. The nomadic hunter-gathering people of the Great Basin usually consumed their pinyon seeds during the winter following harvest; the agricultural Pueblo people of the Rio Grande valley of New Mexico could store them {{for two or three years}} in underground pits.|$|R
5|$|At {{this stage}} the anti-breakage box was swung {{out of the}} way and the coal allowed to run {{directly}} down the chute and down the sides of <b>the</b> <b>cone</b> at its angle of repose.|$|E
5|$|Chrysippus also {{responded to}} a problem first posed by Democritus. If a cone is divided by a plane {{parallel}} to its base, are the surfaces of the segments equal or unequal? If they are equal, then <b>the</b> <b>cone</b> becomes a cylinder; if they are unequal, then the surface of <b>the</b> <b>cone</b> must be stepped. The reply of Chrysippus was that the surfaces are both equal and unequal. Chrysippus was, in effect, negating the law of excluded middle {{with respect to the}} equal and unequal, and thus he may have anticipated an important principle of modern infinitesimal calculus, namely, the limit and the process of convergence towards a limit.|$|E
5|$|The {{seeds of}} conifers, {{the largest group}} of gymnosperms, are {{enclosed}} in a cone and most species have seeds that are light and papery that can be blown considerable distances once free from <b>the</b> <b>cone.</b> Sometimes the seed remains in <b>the</b> <b>cone</b> for years waiting for a trigger event to liberate it. Fire stimulates release and germination of seeds of the jack pine, and also enriches the forest floor with wood ash and removes competing vegetation. Similarly, a number of angiosperms including Acacia cyclops and Acacia mangium have seeds that germinate better after exposure to high temperatures.|$|E
30|$|It is {{well known}} that <b>the</b> second-order <b>cone</b> and <b>the</b> {{circular}} <b>cone</b> have many analogous properties. In particular, there exists an important distance inequality associated with <b>the</b> second-order <b>cone</b> and <b>the</b> circular <b>cone.</b> <b>The</b> inequality indicates that the distances of arbitrary points to <b>the</b> second-order <b>cone</b> and <b>the</b> circular <b>cone</b> are equivalent, which is crucial in analyzing <b>the</b> tangent <b>cone</b> and normal <b>cone</b> for <b>the</b> circular <b>cone.</b> In this paper, we provide an alternative approach to achieve the aforementioned inequality. Although the proof is a bit longer than the existing one, the new approach offers a way to clarify when the equality holds. Such a clarification is helpful for further study of the relationship between <b>the</b> second-order <b>cone</b> programming problems and <b>the</b> circular <b>cone</b> programming problems.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>cones</b> are 6 - 12 cm {{long and}} 4 - 4.5 cm broad, green or purple {{ripening}} pale brown, with about 100-150 scales; the scale bracts are short, and hidden in <b>the</b> closed <b>cone.</b> <b>The</b> winged seeds are released when <b>the</b> <b>cones</b> disintegrate at maturity about 6 months after pollination.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>cones</b> {{are small}} and {{inconspicuous}} at pollination in late winter, <b>the</b> pollen <b>cones</b> in clusters of 10-30 together, <b>the</b> female <b>cones</b> singly or 2-3 together.|$|R
5|$|Many {{carnivorous}} marine gastropods {{are known}} predators of L.canarium, including the volutes Cymbiola nobilis and Melo melo and <b>the</b> <b>cone</b> snail (Conus textile). The dog conch is also preyed upon by vertebrates. These include the crab-eating macaque, Macaca fascicularis, an opportunistic predator that scours intertidal environments. Humans {{are one of}} the dog conch's main predators, subjecting the species to intensive fishing and exploitation.|$|E
5|$|Cannon {{in general}} have {{the form of}} a {{truncated}} cone with an internal cylindrical bore for holding an explosive charge and a projectile. The thickest, strongest, and closed part of <b>the</b> <b>cone</b> is located near the explosive charge. As any explosive charge will dissipate in all directions equally, the thickest portion of the cannon is useful for containing and directing this force. The backward motion of the cannon as its projectile leaves the bore is termed its recoil and the effectiveness of the cannon can be measured in terms of how much this response can be diminished, though obviously diminishing recoil through increasing the overall mass of the cannon means decreased mobility.|$|E
5|$|During the mafic capping stage, basanite, alkali olivine basalt and hawaiite erupted {{mainly from}} small {{parasitic}} cones, tuff rings and fissures {{in the eastern}} half of the shield. Eruptions occurred subglacially, subaqueously and/or subaerially as shown by a wide range in the degree of vesicularity, freshness and glass content of the lavas. In most cases, each parasitic cone produced three or four lava flows from breaches in <b>the</b> <b>cone</b> walls. These were erupted as pāhoehoe and ʻaʻā, but the tops of the lava flows are commonly missing due to erosion. Hawaiite was the most extensively erupted lava of the mafic capping stage, occurring mostly {{at the southern end of}} the Itcha Range but also in its interior.|$|E
50|$|The fertile stems are {{shorter than}} the others; on these develop <b>the</b> <b>cones</b> that bear <b>the</b> spore casings. The leaves develop on the fertile stems and the stems lengthen; then <b>the</b> <b>cones</b> open to release their spores. <b>The</b> <b>cones</b> then drop off. This process takes a few weeks. All the stems may {{continue}} to grow until fall and generally die back over winter.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>cones</b> are {{constructed}} by reddish lapilli and lava bombs up to 1 m wide with subordinate amounts of ash-like material, {{concentrated in the}} talus deposits that have been formed by erosion at the basis of <b>the</b> <b>cones.</b> Arenite of sedimentary origin and dacite are found as xenoliths. <b>The</b> <b>cones</b> were presumably built by Strombolian activity with occasional Hawaiian episodes.|$|R
5000|$|The {{solid angle}} {{subtended}} by {{a segment of}} a spherical cap cut by a plane at angle [...] from <b>the</b> <b>cone's</b> axis and passing through <b>the</b> <b>cone's</b> apex can be calculated by the formula: ...|$|R
5|$|Magnetic Airborne Detection (MAD) {{was used}} to detect {{submerged}} U-boats. It consisted of a sensitive magnetometer installed in <b>the</b> <b>cone</b> of the aircraft (mostly Catalinas) that could detect anomalies in the Earth's magnetic field within a range of 400 feet and was sensitive to detect a submarine to within a few feet. The mine was {{used in conjunction with}} a 65.5lb retro bomb. It was filled with 25lb of Torpex and the weapon was rocket propelled backwards to the line of flight at a speed that counteracted the aircraft's forward motion. It was released rearwards from rails on the wings of the aircraft. Thus, with the aircraft's forward motion cancelled-out by the rocket motor, the device fell directly onto the target.|$|E
5|$|On September 16, 44hours before Hurricane Isabel made {{landfall}} on the Outer Banks of North Carolina, the National Hurricane Center {{issued a}} tropical storm watch for the entire coastline of Delaware. The National Hurricane Center also briefly issued a hurricane watch for the coastline. On September 17, 26hours before Isabel made landfall, the watches were changed to tropical storm warnings. While over the western Atlantic Ocean as a Category 5 hurricane, forecasters predicted Isabel would move northwestward and within five days be at a position 155miles (250km) south-southeast of Lewes as a 115mph (185km/h) major hurricane. Though located within <b>the</b> <b>cone</b> of uncertainty, all subsequent forecasts predicted a landfall on North Carolina with the hurricane passing {{to the west of}} the state.|$|E
5|$|The fruit {{bodies are}} {{typically}} found growing in large numbers, sometimes in clumps, though solitary specimens are occasionally encountered. Several bodies can be connected at their bases, or younger bodies can {{grow out of}} the bases of older ones. The youngest fruit bodies are conical in shape. When the body reaches around 2mm in length, the tip of <b>the</b> <b>cone</b> begins to expand, forming the head. This is the stage at which the hymenium becomes differentiated {{from the rest of}} the body, and the bodies quickly reach their mature form, maturing only through growth after that point. Fruit bodies can be infected by the mould Hypomyces leotiarum.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: [...] alt= A pair of conical pulleys, with a {{flat belt}} running between them. The lower pulley is formed from two {{separate}} movable <b>cones.</b> In <b>the</b> current configuration, <b>the</b> <b>cones</b> have been moved apart so the belt [...] "falls" [...] into the space between them. By moving <b>the</b> <b>cones</b> closer, <b>the</b> belt is forced to ride higher {{on the sides of}} <b>the</b> <b>cones,</b> changing <b>the</b> pulley ratio.|$|R
5000|$|In 1878, naturalist John Muir {{described}} the Indian method of harvesting pinyon seeds in Nevada. In September and October, the harvesters knocked <b>the</b> <b>cones</b> off <b>the</b> pinyon trees with poles, stacked <b>the</b> <b>cones</b> into a pile, put brushwood on top, lit it, and lightly scorched <b>the</b> pinyon <b>cones</b> with fire. <b>The</b> scorching burned off the sticky resin coating <b>the</b> <b>cones</b> and loosened <b>the</b> seeds. <b>The</b> <b>cones</b> were then dried {{in the sun}} until the seeds could be easily extracted. Muir said the Indians closely watched the pinyon trees year-round and could predict the scarcity or abundance of the crop months before harvest time. [...] In 1891, B. H. Dutcher observed the harvesting of pinyon seeds by the Panamint Indians (Timbisha people) in the Panamint Range overlooking Death Valley, California. The harvesting method {{was similar to the}} foregoing except that the pinyon seeds were extracted immediately after <b>the</b> <b>cones</b> had been scorched in the brushwood fire.|$|R
50|$|In <b>the</b> {{obstacle}} <b>cone</b> driving, time penalties {{are awarded}} for exceeding the time allowed to complete <b>the</b> <b>cones</b> course, which is calculated {{by taking the}} measured distance of the course and dividing it by the speed allowed. Penalties are also awarded for knocking down a ball from any of <b>the</b> <b>cones</b> on <b>the</b> course.|$|R
5|$|Auriscalpium vulgare, {{commonly}} known as the pinecone mushroom, <b>the</b> <b>cone</b> tooth, or the ear-pick fungus, is a species of fungus in the family Auriscalpiaceae of the order Russulales. It was first described in 1753 by Carl Linnaeus, who included it {{as a member of the}} tooth fungi genus Hydnum, but British mycologist Samuel Frederick Gray recognized its uniqueness and in 1821 transferred it to the genus Auriscalpium that he created to contain it. The fungus is widely distributed in Europe, Central America, North America, and temperate Asia. Although common, its small size and nondescript colors lead it to be easily overlooked in the pine woods where it grows. A.vulgare is not generally considered edible because of its tough texture, but some historical literature says it used to be consumed in France and Italy.|$|E
5|$|Licancabur {{formed in}} three units, {{all of which}} have lava flows; the last one also {{includes}} pyroclastic deposits. The bulk of <b>the</b> <b>cone</b> was formed by the second unit. The second unit's eruption was preceded by the injection of basic magma into the magma chamber. The oldest flows crop out on the western and northern sides of the volcano and are partially covered by more-recent flows from Licancabur and flows from Sairecabur. Flows from both appear to be pre-glacial. The older lavas have compositions similar to shoshonite and old Sairecabur lavas, and tend to be more basic than recent lavas. Weak explosive activity left pyroclastic deposits on the volcano. Licancabur formed primarily after the late glacial period, between 12,000 and 10,000 years ago. Flank lava flows are its youngest feature. The neighbouring Juriques dates to the Pleistocene.|$|E
5|$|Nightjars have {{relatively}} large eyes, {{each with a}} tapetum lucidum (reflective layer behind the retina) that makes the eyes shine in torchlight and improves light detection at dusk, dawn and in moonlight. The retinas of nocturnal birds, including nightjars, are adapted for sight in low-light levels and have a higher density of rod cells and far fewer cone cells compared to those of most diurnal birds. These adaptations favour good night vision {{at the expense of}} colour discrimination. In many day-flying species, light passes through coloured oil droplets within <b>the</b> <b>cone</b> cells to improve colour vision. In contrast, nightjars have a limited number of cone cells, either lacking or having only a few oil droplets. The nocturnal eyesight of nightjars is probably equivalent to that of owls. Although they have good hearing, European nightjars appear not to rely on sound to find insects, and nightjars do not echolocate.|$|E
50|$|Jack pine cones {{are usually}} 5 cm and curved at <b>the</b> tip. <b>The</b> <b>cones</b> are 3 - 5 cm long, the scales with a small, fragile prickle that usually wears off before maturity, leaving <b>the</b> <b>cones</b> smooth.|$|R
50|$|The {{leaves are}} in fascicles of three, needle-like, yellow-green, twisted, and 9-15 cm (about 3.5-6 in) long. <b>The</b> <b>cones</b> are 8-16 cm long and {{clustered}} in whorls {{of three to}} six on the branches. The scales end in a short stout prickle. <b>The</b> <b>cones</b> remain closed for many years until a fire opens them and allows reseeding. As a result, <b>the</b> <b>cones</b> may even become embedded in the trunk as the tree grows.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> seed <b>cones</b> are 10-15 mm long, pale purple with a whitish wax coating, {{with four}} (rarely six) scales {{arranged}} in opposite decussate pairs; the outer pair of scales each bears two winged seeds, the inner pair(s) usually being sterile; <b>the</b> <b>cones</b> are borne on a 4-6 mm long peduncle covered in small (2 mm) scale leaves. <b>The</b> <b>cones</b> turn brown when mature about 8 months after pollination. <b>The</b> pollen <b>cones</b> are 4-5 mm long.|$|R
5|$|Over time Surtseyan eruptions tend to form maars, broad low-relief {{volcanic}} craters {{dug into}} the ground, and tuff rings, circular structures built of rapidly quenched lava. These structures {{are associated with a}} single vent eruption, however if eruptions arise along fracture zones a rift zone may be dug out; these eruptions tend to be more violent then the ones forming a tuff ring or maars, an example being the 1886 eruption of Mount Tarawera. Littoral cones are another hydrovolcanic feature, generated by the explosive deposition of basaltic tephra (although they are not truly volcanic vents). They form when lava accumulates within cracks in lava, superheats and explodes in a steam explosion, breaking the rock apart and depositing it on the volcano's flank. Consecutive explosions of this type eventually generate <b>the</b> <b>cone.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>cone</b> shaped fruiting body of Cyathus striatus {{makes use}} of a splash-cup {{mechanism}} to help disperse the spores. When a raindrop hits {{the interior of the}} cup with the optimal angle and velocity, the downward force of the water ejects the peridioles into the air. The force of ejection rips open the funiculus, releasing the tightly wound funicular cord. The hapteron attached {{to the end of the}} funiculus is adhesive, and when it contacts a nearby plant stem or stick, the hapteron sticks to it; the funicular cord wraps around the stem or stick powered by the force of the still-moving peridiole (similar to a tetherball). The peridioles degrade over time to eventually release the spores within, or they may be eaten by herbivorous animals and redeposited after passing through the digestive tract.|$|E
5|$|The same {{applies to}} herbivores, animals that eat plants, {{and the plants}} that they eat. In the Rocky Mountains, red {{squirrels}} and crossbills (seed-eating birds) compete for seeds of the lodgepole pine. The squirrels get at pine seeds by gnawing through <b>the</b> <b>cone</b> scales, whereas the crossbills get at the seeds by extracting them with their unusual crossed mandibles. In areas where there are squirrels, the lodgepole's cones are heavier, and have fewer seeds and thinner scales, {{making it more difficult}} for squirrels to get at the seeds. Conversely, where there are crossbills but no squirrels, the cones are lighter in construction, but have thicker scales, making it more difficult for crossbills to get at the seeds. The lodgepole's cones are in an evolutionary arms race with the two kinds of herbivore.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Red <b>Cones</b> last erupted {{approximately}} 5000 years ago, {{with both}} cinder eruption (forming <b>the</b> <b>cones),</b> and a basalt flow from <b>the</b> southern <b>cone,</b> which flowed approximately 1.5 km towards the upper Middle Fork of the San Joaquin River.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> seed <b>cones</b> are 10-20 mm long, pale purple with a whitish wax coating, {{with four}} (rarely six) scales {{arranged}} in opposite decussate pairs; the outer pair of scales each bears two winged seeds, the inner pair(s) usually being sterile; <b>the</b> <b>cones</b> are borne on a 1-2 cm long peduncle covered in very small (1 mm) scale leaves. <b>The</b> <b>cones</b> turn brown when mature about 8 months after pollination. <b>The</b> pollen <b>cones</b> are 4-8 mm long.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>cones</b> are ovoid, 5-9 cm long, green {{ripening}} brown, opening when mature in spring to 5-6 cm broad. The seeds are winged, 5-6 mm long with a 1.5-2.5 cm wing. Pollination is in late spring, with <b>the</b> <b>cones</b> maturing 20-22 months after.|$|R
