5|$|Henry {{responded to}} the French and Angevin threat by {{expanding}} his own network of supporters beyond the Norman borders. Some Norman barons deemed unreliable were arrested or dispossessed, and Henry used their forfeited estates to bribe his potential allies in the neighbouring territories, in particular Maine. Around 1110, Henry attempted to arrest the young William Clito, but William's mentors moved him {{to the safety of}} Flanders before he could be taken. At about this time, Henry probably began <b>to</b> <b>style</b> himself as the Duke of Normandy. Robert of Bellême turned against Henry once again, and when he appeared at Henry's court in 1112 in a new role as a French ambassador, he was arrested and imprisoned.|$|E
5|$|John Sigismund's rule {{began with}} his mother's death. Rather than {{adopting}} a new title, he continued <b>to</b> <b>style</b> himself rex electus (king-elect). Mihály Csáky, Christopher and Stephen Báthory, and his mother's other advisors continued {{to participate in}} state administration. John Sigismund sent envoys to Ferdinand to propose marriage with one of Ferdinand's daughters, but also to announce his claim to the parts of Hungary under Ferdinand's rule. His demands were rejected, but peace was preserved.|$|E

5|$|Negotiations {{between the}} envoys of Matthias and Vladislaus Jagiellon {{accelerated}} {{during the next}} few months. The first draft of a treaty was agreed upon on 28 March 1478, and the text was completed by the end of 1477. The treaty authorized both monarchs to use the title of King of Bohemiaalthough Vladislaus could omit <b>to</b> <b>style</b> Matthias as such in their correspondenceand the Lands of the Bohemian Crown were divided between them; Vladislaus ruled in Bohemia proper and Matthias in Moravia, Silesia and Lusatia. They solemnly ratified the peace treaty at their meeting in Olomouc on 21 July.|$|E
5|$|Pope Boniface who {{regarded}} Hungary as a fief of the Holy See declared Charles the lawful king of Hungary on 31May 1303. He also threatened Wenceslaus with excommunication if {{he continued}} <b>to</b> <b>style</b> himself king of Hungary. Wenceslaus, left Hungary in summer 1304, taking the Holy Crown with him. Charles met his cousin, Rudolph III of Austria, in Pressburg (now Bratislava in Slovakia) on 24August. After signing an alliance, they jointly invaded Bohemia in the autumn. Wenceslaus who had succeeded {{his father in}} Bohemia renounced his claim to Hungary in favor of Otto III, Duke of Bavaria on 9October 1305.|$|E
5|$|The {{liberty of}} being {{employed}} in silk factories starting in 1865 allowed some women <b>to</b> <b>style</b> themselves tzu-shu nii (never to marry) {{and live in}} communes with other women.

These communes passed because of the Great Depression and were subsequently discouraged by the communist government for being a relic of feudal China. In contemporary Chinese society, tongzhi (same goal or spirit) is the term {{used to refer to}} homosexuals; most Chinese are reluctant to divide this classification further to identify lesbians.|$|E

5|$|A grandniece of Anne Boleyn {{and close}} to Elizabeth since childhood, Lettice Knollys was {{introduced}} early into court life. At 17 she married Walter Devereux, Viscount Hereford, who in 1572 became Earl of Essex. After her husband went to Ireland in 1573 she possibly became involved with Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester. There was plenty of scandalous talk, not least when Essex died in Ireland of dysentery in 1576. Two years later Lettice Knollys married Robert Dudley in private. When the Queen was told of the marriage she banished the Countess forever from court, effectively curtailing her social life. The couple's child, Robert, Lord Denbigh, {{died at the age}} of three, to the great grief of his parents and ending all prospects for the continuance of the House of Dudley. Lettice Knollys' union with Leicester was nevertheless a happy one, as was her third marriage to the much younger Sir Christopher Blount, whom she unexpectedly married in 1589 only six months after the Earl's death. She continued <b>to</b> <b>style</b> herself Lady Leicester.|$|E
5|$|After long negotiations, Portugal {{signed a}} treaty with Brazil on 29 August 1825 {{in which it}} {{recognized}} Brazilian independence. Except for the recognition of independence, the treaty provisions were at Brazil's expense, including a demand for reparations {{to be paid to}} Portugal, with no other requirements of Portugal. Compensation was to be paid to all Portuguese citizens residing in Brazil for the losses they had experienced, such as properties which had been confiscated. JoãoVI was also given the right <b>to</b> <b>style</b> himself emperor of Brazil. More humiliating was that the treaty implied that independence had been granted as a beneficent act of JoãoVI, rather than having been compelled by the Brazilians through force of arms. Even worse, Great Britain was rewarded for its role in advancing the negotiations by the signing of a separate treaty in which its favorable commercial rights were renewed and by the signing of a convention in which Brazil agreed to abolish slave trade with Africa within four years. Both accords were severely harmful to Brazilian economic interests.|$|E
5|$|As king, Matthias waged wars {{against the}} Czech mercenaries who {{dominated}} Upper Hungary (today parts of Slovakia and Northern Hungary) and against Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor, who claimed Hungary for himself. In this period, the Ottoman Empire conquered Serbia and Bosnia, terminating {{the zone of}} buffer states along the southern frontiers of the Kingdom of Hungary. Matthias signed a peace treaty with Frederick III in 1463, acknowledging the Emperor's right <b>to</b> <b>style</b> himself King of Hungary. The Emperor returned the Holy Crown of Hungary with which Matthias was crowned on 29 April 1464. In this year, Matthias invaded the territories that had recently been occupied by the Ottomans and seized fortresses in Bosnia. He soon realized he could expect no substantial aid from the Christian powers and gave up his anti-Ottoman policy.|$|E

5|$|Melchior Balassa, one of {{the wealthiest}} lords in John Sigismund's realm, deserted to Ferdinand in December 1561. John Sigismund moved to seize Balassa's domains, but his army was routed at Hadad (now Hodod in Romania) on 4 March 1562. Stirred up by Balassa, the Székely commoners rose to restore their ancient liberties (including {{exemption}} from taxes), which had been restricted in the 1550s. John Sigismund's army routed them in May, and their leaders were impaled or mutilated. The Diet adopted new laws to restrict the privileges of the Székelys, including a ban on the employment of commoners as jurors. Two new royal castles named Székelytámad ("Székely-assault") and Székelybánja ("Székely-regret") were erected in the Székely Land. After Balassa's revolt, most counties outside Transylvania changed allegiance from John Sigismund to Ferdinand. To persuade Ferdinand to renounce the counties, John Sigismund even offered not <b>to</b> <b>style</b> himself king, but this was rejected in July 1562.|$|E
5|$|The company {{merged with}} Newcastle Breweries in 1960, forming Scottish & Newcastle, {{a group with}} market value of £50 million. William McEwan Younger, the son of William Younger, was the {{chairman}} and managing director. The company dedicated itself to the free trade, and promoted its brands to an extent not previously witnessed in the British brewing industry. McEwan's Export {{became one of the}} three core brands of the new company, alongside Newcastle Brown Ale and Younger's Tartan Special. Scottish & Newcastle became the dominant force in brewing across Scotland and the North of England. From the 1960s, the company began <b>to</b> <b>style</b> itself MacEwan's in export markets, in order to make pronunciation easier. The company's McEwan's Strong Ale was the highest gravity beer on general sale throughout the world. McEwan's Export was alternatively sold as India Pale Ale or Scotch Ale overseas. William McEwan Younger retired in 1970.|$|E
