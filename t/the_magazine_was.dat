5|$|A {{little over}} {{ten years after the}} first US edition ceased, a new version appeared, again as a {{companion}} to F. This time <b>the</b> <b>magazine</b> <b>was</b> quarterly. The debut issue was dated May 1969, and it was edited by Edward L. Ferman—son of Joseph Ferman—who was also the editor of F. There was no statement of editorial intent for this version, but the policy was straightforward: a novel was presented in each issue. Although these were substantially cut, they still took up most of the magazine, with the result that the other stories tended to be very short. As in the first incarnation, the contents were of fairly good quality, with contributions from well-known writers. However, <b>the</b> <b>magazine</b> <b>was</b> no more successful than before, and lasted for only six quarterly issues; the last issue was August 1970.|$|E
5|$|The first 8 {{issues of}} Lobster are A5 paper size (148 × 210mm) format, growing to A4 (210 × 297mm) from Issue 9 in September 1985. <b>The</b> <b>magazine</b> <b>was</b> {{originally}} typewritten, reduced on a photocopier, pasted-up and printed on a Gestetner off-set litho duplicating machine. Around issue 17, <b>the</b> <b>magazine</b> <b>was</b> type-set on an Amstrad PCW using Wordstream and from Lobster 27, on an AppleMac with Claris Works. Lobster Issue 57 (Summer 2009) {{was the last}} hard copy issue. Issue 58 (Winter 2009/2010) was the first available without charge. The magazine is published from Ramsay's home in Hull.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>magazine</b> <b>was</b> {{canceled}} {{after the}} April 1941 issue, {{but when a}} boom in science fiction magazines began in 1950, the publishers revived it. The first {{issue of the new}} series was dated November 1950; a further six issues appeared, the last dated May 1952. In addition to Kuttner, contributors to the first run included Arthur J. Burks and Jack Williamson; the second run published stories by Arthur C. Clarke, Isaac Asimov, Jack Vance, and L. Sprague de Camp, among others. In the opinion of science fiction historian Joseph Marchesani, the quality of the second incarnation of <b>the</b> <b>magazine</b> <b>was</b> superior to the first, but it was unable to compete with the new higher-quality magazines that had appeared in the interim.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Magazines</b> <b>are</b> {{inserted}} into <b>the</b> <b>magazine</b> well, which <b>is</b> located {{to the rear}} of the pistol grip. <b>The</b> <b>magazine</b> <b>is</b> inserted front-first into the well so that the notch on the front of <b>the</b> <b>magazine</b> <b>is</b> retained in <b>the</b> well. <b>The</b> <b>magazine</b> <b>is</b> then [...] "rocked" [...] into place by rotating the rear of <b>the</b> <b>magazine</b> upwards into <b>the</b> well (in a manner similar to the AK-47 series) until <b>the</b> <b>magazine</b> release to <b>the</b> rear of the well is engaged. To release <b>the</b> <b>magazine,</b> <b>the</b> <b>magazine</b> release <b>is</b> pressed rearward, and <b>the</b> <b>magazine</b> pivoted forward and disengaged from the front recess.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>magazine</b> <b>was,</b> however, highly controversial. Before {{publication}} Muslim {{groups had}} expressed opposition. After publication began the Playboy Indonesia offices were attacked, as were various printers. In one instance the Islamic Defenders Front attacked the Playboy Indonesia offices in South Jakarta, {{leading to the}} building being evacuated. By May 2006 the continuous protests had left the magazine without an office. The bad publicity led advertisers to abandon the magazine. Ultimately <b>the</b> <b>magazine</b> <b>was</b> shut down after releasing ten issues, having moved to the predominantly Hindu island Bali since its second issue, in June 2006.|$|E
5|$|As Thrilling Wonder <b>the</b> <b>magazine</b> <b>was</b> {{much less}} influential. Until the mid-1940s it {{was focused on}} younger readers, {{and by the time}} Merwin and Mines {{introduced}} a more adult approach, Astounding Science Fiction had taken over as the unquestioned leader of the field. Thrilling Wonder could not compete with John Campbell and the Golden Age of science fiction that he brought into being, but it did periodically publish good stories. In the end it was unable to escape its roots in the pulp industry, and died in the carnage that swept away every remaining pulp magazine in the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|Authentic Science Fiction was a British {{science fiction}} {{magazine}} {{published in the}} 1950s that ran for 85 issues under three editors: Gordon Landsborough, H.J. Campbell, and E.C. Tubb. <b>The</b> <b>magazine</b> <b>was</b> published by Hamilton and Co., and began in 1951 {{as a series of}} novels appearing every two weeks; by the summer it became a monthly magazine, with readers' letters and an editorial page, though fiction content was still restricted to a single novel. In 1952 short fiction began to appear alongside the novels, and within two more years it completed the transformation into a science fiction magazine.|$|E

5|$|If Wilde's {{period at}} the helm of <b>the</b> <b>magazine</b> <b>was</b> a mixed success from an {{organizational}} point of view, one can also argue that it played a pivotal role in his development as a writer and facilitated his ascent to fame. Whilst Wilde the journalist supplied articles under the guidance of his editors, Wilde the editor is forced to learn to manipulate the literary marketplace on his own terms.|$|E

5|$|The 1908 Ordnance Survey map of Gibraltar reveals Flat Bastion Magazine {{within the}} east side of the bastion.

June 1940 was followed by August and October 1940 and January and March 1941. The May 1941 issue inaugurated another monthly period that lasted until August 1943, when the schedule switched back to bimonthly until the June 1944 issue. Fantastic then went on a quarterly schedule, beginning with the October 1944 issue; in October 1945 it became bimonthly again, {{though there was a}} gap between February and May 1946. From September 1947 {{to the end of the}} run <b>the</b> <b>magazine</b> <b>was</b> monthly. The volume numeration was regular, with a new volume starting at the beginning of each calendar year; the result was a variable number of issues in each volume, from a low of four in 1944 to a full twelve when <b>the</b> <b>magazine</b> <b>was</b> monthly, as it was for the last few years of its life.

Issue 10 used the new, shorter title on the cover and spine, but reverted to Beyond Fantasy Fiction for the table of contents. As a result, the magazine is often listed as having changed its name {{for the last two}} issues.|$|E
5|$|After {{his time}} on the Kentucky Court of Appeals, Hines {{returned}} to practicing law in Frankfort, Kentucky. In 1886, Hines began writing a series of four articles discussing the Northwest Conspiracy for Basil W. Duke's Southern Bivouac magazine. <b>The</b> <b>magazine</b> <b>was</b> dedicated {{to the memory of}} the Lost Cause of the Confederacy, but was less adversarial than similar Southern magazines, gaining a larger Northern readership than similar journals. The first of the articles was printed in the December 1886 issue. However, after consulting with former Confederate president Jefferson Davis at Davis' home in Mississippi, Hines did not name anybody on the Northern side who assisted in the conspiracy. After writing the first article, Hines was attacked for not being more forthcoming regarding all the participants from both newspapers' reviewers (particularly from the Louisville Times) and Southern readers, which discouraged Hines from publishing any more accounts of the Northwest Conspiracy.|$|E
