An entry through a grooved door gives access to a long corridor and in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>wall</b> of which is an inscription that discloses the name of the donor and the monastic order.|$|E
5|$|Light {{falls on}} the {{pictorial}} space from the left, creating shadows against <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>wall,</b> the strongest cast by the girl's hennin. The depth of space provided by <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>wall</b> gives room for this detailing, which Charles Sterling believes is indebted to van Eyck. The light throws a murky but curved shadow {{on the wall behind}} the girl and acts as a counterpoint to the contour of her cheek and hairline.|$|E
5|$|Platform D5 is a south-facing range {{structure}} of great length {{with just two}} access stairways. Excavations uncovered a number of funerary urns deposited under <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>wall</b> of the structure, the only example burial urns being interred behind such a platform.|$|E

5|$|A {{mirror on}} <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>wall</b> {{reflects}} the upper bodies and heads of two figures identified from other paintings, and by Palomino, as King PhilipIV(10) and Queen Mariana(11). The most common {{assumption is that}} the reflection shows the couple in the pose they are holding for Velázquez as he paints them, while their daughter watches; and that the painting therefore shows {{their view of the}} scene.|$|E

40|$|Photograph of San Francisco {{earthquake}} damage, {{showing an}} interior {{view of the}} ruins of Hale's, 1906. A charred, skeletal frame is all that remains inside the building. The bricks of the interior walls as well as various pipes and metal pieces blanket the floor. The absence of the roof has allowed sunlight to fill <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>walls...</b>|$|R
5|$|All {{the figures}} are adorned with carved {{ornaments}} and surrounded by borders with reliefs of animals and birds. The lotus design is a common theme. On the ceiling are images of the Vidyadhara couples as well as couples in courtship and erotic Mithuna scenes. Through a cleft in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>wall</b> of the cave is a square sanctuary with more carved images. In the mandapa is a seated Nandi facing the garbha ghriya (sacrum sanctum) containing a Shiva linga.|$|E
5|$|Next to it, but {{higher up}} and almost inaccessible, are two cells; then a well; and, thirdly, a small vihara, with three cells, {{two of them}} with stone-beds. Some rough cutting on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>wall</b> between the cell-doors resembles a dagoba in low relief, but it is quite unfinished. Outside are two more cells and a chamber or chapel {{at the end of}} a veranda that runs along in front both of the vihara and the cells.|$|E
5|$|The {{paintings}} on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>wall</b> {{are recognized as}} representing Minerva Punishing Arachne and Apollo's Victory Over Marsyas. Both stories involve Minerva, the Goddess of Wisdom and patron of the arts. These two legends are both stories of mortals challenging gods and the dreadful consequences. One scholar {{points out that the}} legend dealing with two women, Minerva and Arachne, is {{on the same side of}} the mirror as the queen's reflection while the male legend is on the side of the king.|$|E
50|$|Since early Lycian times, the city's {{settlement}} was likely {{concentrated on the}} southern slope and western slopes. Wide terraces with cisterns and <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>walls</b> of buildings carved from the rock are found there, {{as well as an}} agora, a Roman-era theatre, for plays and concerts, public roman baths and the remains of an early Byzantine church.|$|R

5|$|Cave 12 {{is a small}} {{dwelling}} {{entered by}} a door from the veranda of cave 11. It has its own open veranda, which has a partly broken floor and ceiling and recessed benches {{on the left and}} right of the door to the middle room. The middle room has a small window {{to the left of the}} door and a seat recess in its right wall. In <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>wall</b> of the middle room to the left is a half cell - which has a seat recess - and a cell with a grooved door. The floor of the cave has a coating of cement, while the ceiling of the middle room bears painted concentric circles.|$|E
5|$|Cave 13 on a {{slightly}} higher level than cave 12, is a small dwelling with an open court and from 2 steps lead to a veranda. To {{the right of the}} court is a cistern. The veranda has a bench along its right wall. The front of the veranda has 2 benches, flanked by a plain eight-sided pillar and pilaster; some remnants of these survive. On the right pilaster is a double crescent ornament. A grooved door leads to a middle room, which has a bench along the right wall and seat recess to the left. A window is to the left of door. In <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>wall</b> of the middle room a cell (left) - with a grooved bench and a bench - and a half cell (right) are seen. The ceiling has traces of painting.|$|E
5|$|On June 10, a {{powerful}} squall line of thunderstorms with embedded supercells developed across New York and moved northeast through parts of northern New England and Quebec. Particularly hard hit was the Montreal region and its southern suburbs including Longueuil, Châteauguay, Brossard and Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu. Barns were reported damaged and other structures sustained roof and siding damage; {{particularly in the}} Saint-Blaise-sur-Richelieu area where one home was pushed from its foundation. In Sainte-Catherine, the roof of an office was blown into a nearby residence punching a large hole on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>wall.</b> On Montreal's Champlain Bridge, eight tractor trailers were overturned forcing {{the closure of the}} entire bridge in both directions. In addition, a window washing platform tumbled from a high rise building in downtown Montreal. The workers were able to get inside.|$|E
25|$|Dating to the mid-4th century BCE, the stoa {{measured}} 11 by 110m with 39 exterior Doric {{columns and}} 17 internal Ionic columns. There were stone benches set into <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>walls</b> of <b>the</b> structure, perhaps where the suppliants {{of the god}} slept and awaited their dreams. The sexes may have been segregated as {{may have been the}} case for the bath to the northeast of the stoa, which is traditionally called the women’s bath.|$|R
50|$|Throughout {{the years}} various {{improvements}} were made. The rectory {{was completed in}} 1958. In the spring of 1958, the old church-rectory was demolished. On July 21, 1959, the parish became free of debt. In November 1965 an Italian-made mosaic was installed on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>walls</b> of <b>the</b> main and side altars. In 1968 a Catechetical Center was completed. This required {{the purchase of the}} remaining half block of property west of the church and the demolition of the buildings.|$|R
5000|$|Colwell Playhouse, with 674 seats, mainly hosts {{plays and}} dance {{performances}} {{and is used}} mainly by the Departments of Theatre and Dance and also by touring productions. Like the Festival theatre, it {{is equipped with a}} Sennheiser Audio System, a computerized lighting system, sound reinforcement and recording capability. The acoustics in this venue are designed to specifically support speech performances. The walls are shaped to reflect voices from the stage towards the audience while <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>walls</b> are echo-proof.|$|R
5|$|One monk {{was thrown}} from a balcony {{down to the}} {{courtyard}} six meters below. Nhu's men vandalized the main altar and confiscated the intact charred heart of Thích Quảng Đức, which had failed to burn during his re-cremation. However, some of the Buddhists were able to flee the pagoda with a receptacle containing his ashes. Two monks jumped <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>wall</b> of Xá Lợi to enter {{the grounds of the}} adjoining United States Agency for International Development (USAID) mission, where they were given asylum, despite the presence of troops behind the pagoda walls who opened fire with automatic weapons on any monks who tried to flee by jumping the fence.|$|E
5|$|Platform A6 {{encloses}} {{the western}} extreme of the Group A plaza. The platform has two levels, the upper {{of which has}} a vertical cornice. The platform faces east onto the plaza; access was via two stairways flanked by balustrades terminating in vertical cornices. Platform A6 was built over an older {{version of the same}} building; this earlier construction phase was smaller and its stairways were destroyed in order to build the stairways of the final version. During restoration work carried out by archaeologists <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>wall</b> and a section of the facade were left exposed. Four funerary urns were found associated with the platform, mostly interred under the front of the building.|$|E
5|$|Platform B5 {{possesses}} two stepped {{levels with}} cornices and encloses {{the northern part}} of the west side of the Group B plaza. The lower level possesses a single inset stairway, while the upper terrace has two stairways flanked by balustrades, with a third balustrade dividing the two. The platform provides a broad view across the Pancaco River valley to the west. Structure B5 was built on top of an earlier construction phase, which is exposed along the upper portion of <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>wall</b> because restoration of the building only rebuilt the lower portion. It was built from stone slabs and was originally taller than the final version of the platform but was cut back to the reduced height of the new building.|$|E
50|$|In particular, on {{this tour}} Keane {{emphasized}} the percussive {{nature of the}} piano, since they had discovered during the U2 shows that the piano sound echoed off <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>walls</b> of arenas, giving it a delayed, doubling sound effect that further made the group's sound dense. Thus for the Under the Iron Sea tour, the group's sound crew added a delay element into the processing of the piano mic pickups, thereby reproducing that arena effect in the band's smaller-sized venues when headlining.|$|R
50|$|The {{new church}} altar faced front while the old church altar {{had taken up}} <b>the</b> entire <b>back</b> <b>wall.</b> <b>The</b> altar area of the new church was no longer {{separated}} by the communion rail of the old church.|$|R
50|$|The casemate is {{a simple}} {{flanking}} one, meaning that it has just only one firing chamber which is directed towards the north. It has an underground gallery connecting to its neighbor, the Casemate de Rountzenheim Nord. It was built in 1932 to accommodate 15 troops, a warrant officer and an officer. Its dimensions are: 19 by 14 meters, for 7.5 meters height. The concrete top measures 2 meters thickness and the external walls 2.25 meters for the exposed walls and 1 meter for <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>walls.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Arnolfini {{is named}} after Jan van Eyck's {{masterpiece}} The Arnolfini Portrait (1434) depicting the merchant and arts patron Giovanni Arnolfini. The Arnolfini Portrait {{is one of the}} earliest paintings to assert the presence of the artist within its depiction (an inscription {{in the middle of the}} work and a reflection in a mirror on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>wall)</b> and one of Arnolfini's consistent concerns: to explore the role of artist as a witness and recorder of what is around them – contemporary society. The painting is in the National Gallery, London and it was one of the founder's favourite paintings.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>back</b> <b>wall</b> of the room, {{which is}} in shadow, is hung with rows of paintings, {{including}} {{one of a series}} of scenes from Ovid's Metamorphoses by Peter Paul Rubens, and copies, by Velázquez's son-in-law and principal assistant Juan del Mazo, of works by Jacob Jordaens. The paintings are shown in the exact positions recorded in an inventory taken around this time. The wall to the right is hung with a grid of eight smaller paintings, visible mainly as frames owing to their angle from the viewer. They can be identified from the inventory as more Mazo copies of paintings from the Rubens Ovid series, though only two of the subjects can be seen.|$|E
5|$|The Capitoline Temple {{stands behind}} the {{basilica}} within what would originally {{have been an}} arcaded courtyard. An altar stands in the courtyard in front of 13 steps {{leading up to the}} Corinthian-columned temple, which had a single cella. The building was of great importance to civic life as it was dedicated to the three chief divinities of the Roman state, Jupiter, Juno and Minerva. Civic assemblies were held in front of the temple to beseech the aid of the gods or to thank them for successes in major civic undertakings such as fighting wars. The layout of the temple, facing <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>wall</b> of the basilica, is somewhat unusual and {{it has been suggested that}} it may have been built on top of an existing shrine. An inscription found in 1924 records that it was reconstructed in 218. It was partly restored in 1955 and given a more substantial restoration in 1962, reconstructing 10 of the 13 steps, the walls of the cella and the columns. There were four more small shrines within the temple precinct, one of which was dedicated to Venus.|$|E
50|$|Shortly before midday on April 6, 2016, Mexican federal {{authorities}} headed to Providencia neighborhood in Guadalajara, Jalisco, in several vehicles. When {{they arrived at}} the property they were looking to raid, they cordoned the area and entered the building through the front entrance while a helicopter flew over the vicinity. Neighbors stated that other federal agents surrounded the property through the rear and climbed <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>walls</b> from other properties. The helicopter then descended at the golf course of the Guadalajara Country Club, where three military vehicles later arrived.|$|R
5000|$|Jack Harrold (June 10, 1920 - July 22, 1994) was an American operatic tenor {{and voice}} teacher. Admired for his comedic skills, he {{specialized}} in the tenor buffo repertoire. He had a particularly long {{association with the}} New York City Opera from the 1940s through the 1980s. He also appeared in several Broadway musicals. Danny Newman of the Lyric Opera of Chicago stated that, [...] "Jack Harrold was one of American musical theater's most beloved and most versatile performers, possessing a clarion tenor voice that practically bounced off <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>walls</b> of <b>the</b> biggest theaters." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>back</b> <b>walls</b> {{should be}} 3 meters high {{covering}} <b>the</b> entire <b>back</b> of <b>the</b> {{field and the}} side walls should be 3 meters high and 2 meters long ending on another wall 2 meters high and 2 meters long (known as step-type, see picture). The diagonal-type side wall is also accepted, instead of a step, it runs as straight line between the two heights of the side wall. The rest of the court is closed using a metallic mesh also 3 meters high, the wall closed sides can also have a metallic mesh up to 1 meter tall.|$|R
