25|$|The bharal or blue sheep is {{the most}} {{abundant}} mountain ungulate in the Ladakh region, {{although it is not}} found in some parts of Zangskar and Sham areas. The Asiatic ibex is a very elegant mountain goat that is distributed {{in the western part of}} Ladakh. It is the second most abundant mountain ungulate in the region with a population of about 6000 individuals. It is adapted to rugged areas where it easily climbs when threatened. The Ladakhi Urial is another unique mountain sheep that inhabits the mountains of Ladakh. The population is declining, however, and there are not more than 3000 individuals left in Ladakh. The urial is endemic to Ladakh, where it is distributed only along two major river valleys: the Indus and Shayok. The animal is often persecuted by farmers whose crops are allegedly damaged by it. Its population declined precipitously in the last century due to indiscriminate shooting by hunters along the Leh-Srinagar highway. The Tibetan argali or Nyan is the largest wild sheep in the world, standing 3.5 to 4 feet at the shoulder with the horn measuring 90–100cm. It is distributed on the Tibetan plateau and its marginal mountains encompassing a total area of 2.5 million km2. There is only a small population of about 400 animals in Ladakh. The animal prefers open and rolling terrain as it runs, unlike wild goats that climb into steep cliffs, to escape from predators. The endangered <b>Tibetan</b> <b>antelope,</b> known as chiru in Indian English, or Ladakhi tsos, has traditionally been hunted for its wool (shahtoosh) which is a natural fiber of the finest quality and thus valued for its light weight and warmth and as a status symbol. The wool of chiru must be pulled out by hand, a process done after the animal is killed. The fiber is smuggled into Kashmir and woven into exquisite shawls by Kashmiri workers. Ladakh is also home to the Tibetan gazelle, which inhabits the vast rangelands in eastern Ladakh bordering Tibet.|$|E

50|$|The fur of <b>Tibetan</b> <b>antelopes</b> is distinctive, and {{consists}} of long guard hairs and a silky undercoat of shorter fibres. The individual guard hairs are thicker than those of other goats, with unusually thin walls, and have a unique pattern of cuticular scales, said to resemble {{the shape of a}} benzene ring.|$|R
50|$|They {{primarily}} prey on Plateau pikas, {{followed by}} rodents, marmots, woolly hares and lizards. They may also scavenge on the carcasses of <b>Tibetan</b> <b>antelopes,</b> musk deer, blue sheep and livestock. Tibetan foxes are mostly solitary, daytime hunters as their main prey, pikas, are diurnal. Tibetan foxes may form commensal relationships with brown bears during hunts for pikas. The bears dig out the pikas, and the foxes grab {{them when they}} escape the bears.|$|R

50|$|The <b>Tibetan</b> <b>antelope,</b> {{also known}} as chiru, is taller than the gazelles and has longer horns. It is endemic to the Tibetan Plateau and is endangered. The animal is poached for its fine wool, which is made by Kashmiri weavers into the Shahtoosh shawl. The film Kekexili: Mountain Patrol {{documents}} efforts to protect the animal from poaching. The <b>Tibetan</b> <b>antelope</b> {{was one of the}} mascots for the 2008 Summer Olympics.|$|E
5000|$|The Antilopinae are a {{subfamily}} of Bovidae. The gazelles, blackbucks, springboks, gerenuks, dibatags, and Central Asian gazelles {{are often}} referred to as [...] "true antelopes", and are usually classified as the only representatives of the Antilopinae. True antelopes occur in much of Africa and Asia, with the highest concentration of species occurring in East Africa in Sudan, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia, Kenya, and Tanzania. The saigas and <b>Tibetan</b> <b>antelopes</b> are related to true antelopes (Antilopinae) and goats (Caprinae), but often placed in their own subfamily, Saiginae. These animals inhabit much of central and western Asia. The dwarf antelopes are sometimes placed in a separate subfamily, Neotraginae, and live entirely in sub-Saharan Africa.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>Tibetan</b> <b>antelope</b> is {{the sole}} species in the genus Pantholops, named from the Greek for [...] "all antelope".

According to lead actor Zhang Lei, the crew was upset about this—as some of the crew had grown affectionate towards the animal actor. The animal was later buried.|$|E
30|$|There {{are three}} main broad {{contexts}} {{that affect the}} lives and livelihoods of Tibetan herders: (1) local history and traditional socio-cultural practices, (2) government policies for development and conservation, and (3) global climate change. In regard to the first context, {{it is important to}} note that even while some level of adaptation may be recommended for people in all societies, there are still valid reasons why some communities or ethnic groups may choose not to change some or all of their traditional practices. Among Tibetan pastoralists, for example, community-based management of grassland resources has been practiced for many centuries. In the project area, this form of human organization clearly reflects some of the ecological requirements of a subsistence economy based on livestock grazing in arid zones and also the hunting of wildlife (such as <b>Tibetan</b> wild yak, <b>antelope,</b> gazelle) in the vast landscapes of the plateau. In some places, the practice of hunting also required long-distance tracking or pursuit of wildlife during seasonal migrations (Combe 1926; Foggin 2000; Mei and Zhang 2004).d Many such features of the socio-ecological landscape have helped to form the pastoral people of the Tibetan plateau (Ekvall 1968; 1974), and loss of their traditional ways of life will almost certainly lead to greater erosion of their sense of identity, certain cultural traits, and their overall well-being (Schech and Haggis 2000).|$|R

50|$|Despite {{the harsh}} climate, Hoh Xil {{is home to}} more than 230 species of wild animals, 20 of which are under Chinese state protection, {{including}} the wild yak, wild donkey, white-lip deer, brown bear and the endangered <b>Tibetan</b> <b>antelope</b> or chiru. The abundant plateau pika, a small burrowing rodent, is the main food of the region's brown bears; the bears also feed on the yak and antelope. The hitherto little-known region, as well the struggling <b>Tibetan</b> <b>antelope,</b> or chiru, became household names in China upon the release of the film Kekexili: Mountain Patrol in 2004.|$|E
50|$|The {{wildlife}} species {{recorded in}} the county are wild yak, wild ass, <b>Tibetan</b> <b>antelope,</b> Tibetan gazelle, and black-necked cranes. The livestock are mainly yak, pianniu, cattle, goats, sheep, horses, donkeys, mules and pigs.|$|E

50|$|In 1945, American {{paleontologist}} George Gaylord Simpson classified both in {{the tribe}} Saigini under the same subfamily, Caprinae.

50|$|The film had a {{profound}} impact in China in bringing attention the region and the plight of its inhabitants and endangered species.

50|$|The chiru or <b>Tibetan</b> <b>antelope</b> is {{hunted for}} its pelt, {{which is used}} in making shahtoosh, an {{incredibly}} fine material used in shawls.

This unsustainable demand has led to enormous declines in the chiru population.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tibetan</b> <b>antelope</b> are gregarious, {{sometimes}} congregating in herds hundreds strong {{when moving}} between {{summer and winter}} pastures, although they are more usually found in much smaller groups, {{with no more than}} 20 individuals.

The relation between the saiga and the <b>Tibetan</b> <b>antelope</b> (Pantholops hodgsonii) have long been debated.
