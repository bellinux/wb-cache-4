Laurent and Tristan retire from the Sultan's bedroom and when <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> to train Lexius as their secret slave, a rescue team led by the Captain of the Guard arrives and Laurent takes Lexius with him to their ship along with Beauty and Tristan.

2500|$|During the war years, Chamberlain {{was one of}} the [...] "annexationists" [...] {{who wanted}} the war to end with Germany annexing most of Europe, Africa and Asia to give the Reich the [...] "world power status" [...] he {{believed}} it deserved. As such, Chamberlain worked closely with the Pan-German League, the Conservatives and the völkishe groups to mobilise public support for the maximum war aims he sought. Chamberlain was {{a founding member of the}} Independent Commission for a German Peace, and in July 1915 he signed the Address of the Intellectuals, a petition signed by 1,347 teachers, writers, professors, and theologians asking the government to win the war in order to annex as much territory as possible. Much of this propaganda including Chamberlain's essays in support of the maximum war aims had a very strong anti-Semitic character as Chamberlain claimed that it was the entire German Jewish community who were supposedly seeking a compromise peace to end the war, and were preventing the full mobilization of Germany's power that would allow the Reich to win the war. In a letter to his friend Prince Maximilian of Baden, Chamberlain wrote: I learned today from a man who is especially well-placed to observe these things-even when they go on secretly-that the Jews are completely intoxicated by their success in Germany-first from the millions they have gained through the war, then because of the praise showered on them in all official quarters, and thirdly from the protection they and their machinations enjoy from the censor. Thus, already <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> to lose their heads and reach a degree of insolence which may allow us to hope for a flood-tide of reaction. May God grant it!. In October–November 1916, the so-called Judenzählung ("Jew count") was held by the German Army to examine the popular anti-Semitic claim that German Jews were [...] "shirking" [...] their duty to the Fatherland by avoiding war service. The [...] "Jew count" [...] revealed that in fact German Jews were disproportionately over-represented in the front-line units as most German Jews were anxious to prove their German patriotism and love of the Fatherland by volunteering for front-line duty. Many young German Jewish men wished to rebut the anti-Semitic canard that they were not real Germans by fighting for the Fatherland, and thus showing that they loved Germany as much as their Gentile neighbors, hence the disproportionate number of German Jews on the front-line compared to their share of the German population. As the results of the [...] "Jew count" [...] did not please the two men in charge of High Command, namely Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg and General Erich Ludendorff, the latter a [...] "fanatical anti-Semite" [...] who had been expecting the [...] "Jew Count" [...] to reveal that German Jews were disproportionally underrepresented on the front-line, the High Command issued a facetious statement saying that for the safety of the German Jewish community the [...] "Jew count" [...] could not be made public as it would endanger the lives of German Jews. The implication that if people could see just how far German Jews were allegedly [...] "shirking" [...] their duty to the Fatherland, then pogroms would break out in Germany led to a major upsurge in anti-Semitism, which Chamberlain was quick to exploit.|$|E
