40|$|<b>The</b> <b>mudded</b> weak {{interlayer}} is a geotechnical sandwich material exhibiting {{strain softening}} behavior, which {{plays an important}} part in the slope stability. The present work primarily focuses on the shear strength of <b>the</b> <b>mudded</b> weak interlayer in rock slopes. To determine the peak and residual shear strengths of <b>the</b> <b>mudded</b> weak interlayers, <b>the</b> particle flow code (PFC) is used to simulate the failure behavior during the direct shear tests. Laboratory investigations including uniaxial compression test, SEM, and 3 D deformation measurement are employed to calibrate the essential micro parameters of <b>the</b> <b>mudded</b> weak interlayer during the simulation process in PFC. The numerical model is built based on these parameters and both the peak and residual shear strengths can be predicted from the model. The prediction results show that the peak and residual internal friction angle are 19. 36 ° and 14. 61 °, while the peak and residual cohesion are 22. 33 [*]kPa and 2. 73 [*]kPa, respectively. Moreover, to validate the obtained peak and residual strengths, the results are compared with literature data. The peak and residual shear strengths of <b>the</b> <b>mudded</b> weak interlayer can serve as an important benchmark to evaluate the stability of side slopes and provide guiding suggestions for their reinforcement...|$|R

5|$|A {{detailed}} re-assessment of the taphonomy by palaeontologist Martin Sander of the University of Bonn, Germany, {{found that}} the mud-miring hypothesis first suggested by Fraas is true: animals above a certain body weight sank into <b>the</b> <b>mud,</b> which was further liquefied by their attempts to free themselves. Sander's scenario, similar to that proposed for the famous Rancho La Brea Tar Pits, {{is the only one}} explaining all taphonomic data. The degree of completeness of the carcasses was not influenced by transport, which is obvious from the lack of indications for transport before burial, but rather by how much the dead animals were scavenged. Juveniles of Plateosaurus and other taxa of herbivores were too light to sink into <b>the</b> <b>mud</b> or managed to extract themselves, and were thus not preserved. Similarly, scavenging theropods were not trapped due to their lower body weights, combined with proportionally larger feet. There is no indication of herding, or of catastrophic burial of such a herd, or catastrophic accumulation of animals that previously died isolated elsewhere.|$|E

40|$|Six cores sampled at two mud fields {{located on}} the {{northern}} Portuguese continental shelf have been studied in order to evaluate the control processes of fine sedimentation. <b>The</b> south-ern <b>mud</b> patch, offshore from the Douro River, is limited {{on the western side}} by some Cretaceous and Paleocene outcrops that constitute reliefs of 5 - 30 m in width; on the contrary, <b>the</b> northern <b>mud</b> patch, offshore from the Minho River, extends along a flat region. Granulometric distribu-tion shows that the sediments from <b>the</b> Minho <b>mud</b> patch are coarser than those from <b>the</b> Douro <b>mud</b> patch, where <b>the</b> grain size diminishes towards the west. Carbonate content is also higher in <b>the</b> Minho <b>mud</b> field. <b>The</b> sediment organisation in fining-up sequences in <b>the</b> Minho <b>mud</b> patch and {{in the eastern part of}} <b>the</b> Douro <b>mud</b> patch indicates sediment remobilisation by storms. <b>The</b> Douro <b>mud</b> patch has higher sedimentation rates than <b>the</b> Minho <b>mud</b> patch. <b>The</b> highest val-ues are probably related to the existence of reliefs, which may offer hydrodynamic protection or function as a fine sediment barrier. The elemental distribution for chemical elements was deter-mined in different fractions of these cores. Geochemical patterns are generally quite similar for both mud fields, indicating a common continental origin for the sediments. The major differ-ences in the chemical composition are mainly controlled by the grain-size distribution, either re-flecting the presence of coarse quartz particles or a local enrichment in biogenic material.

40|$|Red mud {{derived from}} alumina {{refineries}} through the Bayer {{process is a}} waste material with a density of 2187 kg/m(3). The particle size distribution of <b>the</b> red <b>mud</b> is similar to fly ash. In this paper, the {{physical and chemical properties}} of <b>the</b> red <b>mud</b> including oxide and mineral contents are studied by XRF and XRD. The potential use of <b>the</b> red <b>mud</b> as a pozzolanic material to replace fly ash in self-compacting concrete (SCC) is assessed by conducting a range of fresh and hardened properties test (such as slump flow, density, porosity, compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, elasticity modulus and drying shrinkage). The XRF and XRD results show that the oxide forms in <b>the</b> red <b>mud</b> are mainly SiO 2, Al 2 O 3 and CaO at 45. 76 %, 40. 69 % and 4. 98 % respectively, and the crystalline phases are mainly gismondine, goosecrekite and epistilbite which belong to the zeolite family. The results show that the strength activity indeces (SAI) of <b>the</b> red <b>mud</b> are 79. 60 and 88. 46 at 7 days and 28 days respectively, which are approximately equal to that of a common Class F fly ash.
