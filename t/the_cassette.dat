5|$|Following {{the release}} of the music video, a 45-minute {{documentary}} was released that provided candid glimpses behind the scenes of the music video's production. Entitled Making Michael Jackson's Thriller, it, like the music video, was shown heavily on MTV for a time and was the top-selling home-video release of all time at one point, with over nine million copies sold. MTV paid $250,000 for the exclusive rights to show the documentary; Showtime paid $300,000 for pay-cable rights; and Vestron Video reportedly paid $500,000 to market <b>the</b> <b>cassette,</b> in a profit participation agreement.|$|E

5|$|After {{the final}} photo was selected, Heiden {{commissioned}} two {{different versions of}} the album cover. The original image was taken in black-and-white, and Heiden experimented with a variety of treatments of the photo, {{to go along with the}} album's title, and finally arrived at the blue toned, hand tinted version of the image. The LP and CD album cover is a cropped image of a longer picture including torso, more of which is seen in the cover of <b>the</b> <b>cassette</b> tape edition, and was also included as a fold-out poster in the initial pressings of the LP. A poster of Madonna, mirroring the cover art, was included within the vinyl versions of the album.|$|E
5|$|Death Cab for Cutie {{began as}} a solo project of Ben Gibbard in 1997, while he was the guitar player for the band Pinwheel, and was {{recorded}} under the name All-Time Quarterback. As Death Cab for Cutie, Gibbard released a cassette titled You Can Play These Songs with Chords the same year. The release was surprisingly successful, and Gibbard decided to expand the project into a complete band, recruiting Chris Walla (who had also worked on <b>the</b> <b>cassette)</b> as lead guitarist, Nick Harmer as bass player, and Nathan Good as drummer. Death Cab for Cutie was officially formed at Western Washington University in Bellingham, Washington, and lyrics from early songs include local references that were important to the band's development. Many of the early songs were recorded {{in the basement of}} an Ellis Street home Gibbard lived in with several roommates in Bellingham.|$|E
5|$|Pat Secor, Hoppus' boss at {{music store}} The Wherehouse, was {{attempting}} {{to start his own}} record label, named Filter Records. Secor pulled money from his savings and helped finance and produce the demo recording. Buddha was recorded live at local Santee studio Doubletime, compiling a collection that represented nearly all of the songs the band had written up to that point. Hoppus and friends Cam Jones and Kerry Key created <b>the</b> <b>cassette</b> artwork, and the original cassette packaging was compiled by the band and Hoppus' family. Locally distributed to several San Diego record stores and available for purchase at early concerts, Buddha helped the trio cement an audience and was a deciding factor in their signing to local label Cargo in 1993.|$|E

5|$|Police are {{dispatched}} {{to rescue the}} President. However, Romero, the right-hand man of the Duke of New York, the top crime boss in the prison, warns them that the Duke has taken the President hostage, {{and that he will}} be killed if any further rescue attempts are mounted. Commissioner Bob Hauk offers a deal to Snake Plissken, a former Special Forces soldier convicted of attempting to rob the Federal Reserve in Denver: if Snake rescues the President and retrieves <b>the</b> <b>cassette</b> tape, Hauk will arrange a presidential pardon. To ensure his compliance, Hauk has Plissken injected with micro-explosives that will rupture Snake's carotid arteries within 22 hours; if Snake returns with the President and the tape in time, Hauk will have the explosives neutralized.|$|E
5|$|Soona {{gives the}} digital {{cassette}} to Mulder at a discreet {{meeting in a}} park. An excited Mulder returns to FBI headquarters, {{only to find that}} <b>the</b> <b>cassette</b> is encrypted.

When Skinner calls Mulder to his office to question him about the tape, Mulder physically attacks him. Scully is brought before an FBI panel led by Skinner and is questioned about Mulder's actions. Scully is told that Mulder faces dismissal from the FBI, and that she will suffer a similar punishment if she has lied to them.|$|E
5|$|The BASIC {{interpreter}} {{was developed}} from that {{used on the}} ZX81 and a ZX81 BASIC program can be typed into a Spectrum largely unmodified, but Spectrum BASIC included many extra features {{making it easier to}} use. The ZX Spectrum character set was expanded from that of the ZX81, which did not feature lower-case letters. Spectrum BASIC included extra keywords for the more advanced display and sound, and supported multi-statement lines. <b>The</b> <b>cassette</b> interface was much more advanced, saving and loading around five times faster than the ZX81 (1500 bits per second compared to 307), and unlike the ZX81, the Spectrum could maintain the TV display during tape storage and retrieval operations. As well as being able to save programs, the Spectrum could save the contents of arrays, the contents of the screen memory, and the contents of any defined range of memory addresses.|$|E

5|$|Three albums were {{released}} by Hollywood Records on July 29, 2014: The film's score, Guardians of the Galaxy (Original Score), which features the music composed by Bates for the film; , which comprises the twelve songs from Quill's mixtape; and a deluxe edition featuring both albums. By August 2014, the album which mirrored Quill's mixtape {{had reached the}} top of the Billboard 200 chart, becoming the first soundtrack album in history consisting entirely of previously released songs to top the chart. Hollywood Records also released a cassette version of the Awesome Mix Vol. 1 soundtrack on November 28, 2014, as an exclusive to Record Store Day participants. <b>The</b> <b>cassette,</b> which is the first cassette Disney Music Group has released since 2003, comes with a digital download version of the album.|$|E
25|$|The label {{was founded}} by Beat Happening {{frontman}} Calvin Johnson and managed for many years by Candice Pedersen.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>cassette</b> {{was adapted}} {{into what is}} called a {{streamer}} cassette, a version dedicated solely for data storage, and used chiefly for hard disk backups and other types of data. Streamer cassettes look almost exactly the same as a standard cassette, with the exception of having a notch about one quarter-inch wide and deep situated slightly off-center at the top edge of <b>the</b> <b>cassette.</b> Streamer cassettes also have a re-usable write-protect tab on only one side of the top edge of <b>the</b> <b>cassette,</b> with {{the other side of the}} top edge having either only an open rectangular hole, or no hole at all. This is due to the entire one-eighth inch width of the tape loaded inside being used by a streamer cassette drive for the writing and reading of data, hence only one side of <b>the</b> <b>cassette</b> being used. Streamer cassettes can hold anywhere from 50 to 160 megabytes of data.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the birth}} {{and growth of}} <b>the</b> <b>cassette</b> began in the 1960s, its {{cultural}} moment {{took place during the}} 1970s and 1980s. The cassette's popularity grew during these years as a result of being a more effective, convenient and portable way of listening to music. Stereo tape decks and boom boxes became some of the most highly sought-after consumer products of both decades. Portable pocket recorders and high-fidelity ("hi-fi") players, such as Sony's Walkman (1979), also enabled users to take their music with them anywhere with ease. The increasing user-friendliness of <b>the</b> <b>cassette</b> led to its popularity around the globe. The body of the Walkman was not much larger than <b>the</b> <b>cassette</b> tape itself, with mechanical keys on one side, or electronic buttons or a display on the face. Sony's WM-10 was even smaller than <b>the</b> <b>cassette</b> itself, and expanded to hold and play a cassette.|$|E
25|$|All {{cassettes}} {{include a}} write protection mechanism to prevent re-recording and accidental erasure of important material. Each side of <b>the</b> <b>cassette</b> has a plastic tab {{on the top}} that may be broken off, leaving a small indentation in the shell. This indentation allows the entry of a sensing lever that prevents {{the operation of the}} recording function when <b>the</b> <b>cassette</b> is inserted into a cassette deck. If <b>the</b> <b>cassette</b> is held with one of the labels facing the user and the tape opening at the bottom, the write-protect tab for the corresponding side is at the top-left. Occasionally, manufacturers provided a movable panel {{that could be used to}} enable or disable write-protect on tapes.|$|E
