5|$|In the meantime, the Commonwealth forces {{after a long}} siege stormed {{and took}} Smolensk in 1611. At <b>the</b> <b>Kremlin</b> the {{situation}} of the Poles had been worsening despite occasional reinforcements, and the massive national and religious uprising was spreading all over Russia. Prince Dmitry Pozharsky and Kuzma Minin effectively led the Russians, a new rescue operation attempted by Hetman Chodkiewicz had failed and a capitulation of the Polish and Lithuanian forces at <b>the</b> <b>Kremlin</b> terminated in 1612 their involvement there. Mikhail Romanov, son of the imprisoned in Poland (since his rejection of Sigismund III's demand for the Russian throne) Patriarch Filaret, became the new tsar in 1613.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the season, Kuznetsova showed low results due to {{her hand}} injury, twice losing in the 2nd Round in a total of three tournaments, after {{receiving}} a Bye. She withdraw from <b>the</b> <b>Kremlin</b> Cup, where she was the two-times defending champion. On 23 October, she pulled out of the top-10 and dropped to the 11th position, ending her 65 weeks streak in the top 10.|$|E
5|$|In 1485 Ivan III {{commissioned}} {{the building of}} the royal residence, Terem Palace, within <b>the</b> <b>Kremlin,</b> with Aloisio da Milano as the architect of the first three floors. He and other Italian architects also contributed to the construction of <b>the</b> <b>Kremlin</b> walls and towers. The small banquet hall of the Russian Tsars, called the Palace of Facets because of its facetted upper story, is the work of two Italians, Marco Ruffo and Pietro Solario, and shows a more Italian style. In 1505, an Italian known in Russia as Aleviz Novyi or Aleviz Fryazin arrived in Moscow. He may have been the Venetian sculptor, Alevisio Lamberti da Montagne. He built 12 churches for Ivan III, including the Cathedral of the Archangel, a building remarkable for the successful blending of Russian tradition, Orthodox requirements and Renaissance style. It is believed that the Cathedral of the Metropolitan Peter in Vysokopetrovsky Monastery, another work of Aleviz Novyi, later served as an inspiration for the so-called octagon-on-tetragon architectural form in the Moscow Baroque of the late 17th century.|$|E

5|$|In October 1992, Hans Ephraimson-Abt led a {{delegation}} of families and U.S. State Department officials to Moscow {{at the invitation of}} President Yeltsin.

5|$|In late 2007 {{and early}} 2008, several Russian newspapers, {{including}} Rossiyskaya Gazeta, Komsomolskaya Pravda, and Nezavisimaya Gazeta printed stories that implicated the Nazis in the crime, spurring concern {{that this was}} done with the tacit approval of <b>the</b> <b>Kremlin.</b> As a result, the Polish Institute of National Remembrance decided to open its own investigation.|$|E
5|$|Quarry House was {{constructed}} {{on the site}} of the former Quarry Hill Flats (see 1920s and 1930s) at Quarry Hill. The building houses the Department of Health and the Department for Work and Pensions and is their main regional offices. The building is controversial. Its imposing design has often been regarded as being domineering and self-important and has led the building to be nicknamed <b>The</b> <b>Kremlin</b> and The Ministry of Truth.|$|E

5|$|The goal of {{his policy}} was to {{withdraw}} all the U.S. forces from Europe.

5|$|To Lenin's {{embarrassment and}} horror, in April 1920 the Bolsheviks held {{a party to}} {{celebrate}} his fiftieth birthday, which was also marked by widespread celebrations across Russia and the publication of poems and biographies dedicated to him. Between 1920 and 1926, twenty volumes of Lenin's Collected Works were published; some material was omitted. During 1920, several prominent Western figures visited Lenin in Russia; these included the author H. G. Wells and the philosopher Bertrand Russell, {{as well as the}} anarchists Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman. Lenin was also visited at <b>the</b> <b>Kremlin</b> by Armand, who was in increasingly poor health. He sent her to a sanatorium in Kislovodsk in the Northern Caucasus to recover, but she died there in September 1920 during a cholera epidemic. Her body was transported to Moscow, where a visibly grief-stricken Lenin oversaw her burial beneath <b>the</b> <b>Kremlin</b> Wall.|$|E

5|$|After the Brest-Litovsk Treaty, the Left Socialist Revolutionaries had {{abandoned}} the coalition and increasingly viewed the Bolsheviks as traitors to the revolution. In July 1918, the Left Socialist Revolutionary Yakov Grigorevich Blumkin assassinated the German ambassador to Russia, Wilhelm von Mirbach, hoping that the ensuing diplomatic incident {{would lead to a}} relaunched revolutionary war against Germany. The Left Socialist Revolutionaries then launched a coup in Moscow, shelling <b>the</b> <b>Kremlin</b> and seizing the city's central post office before being stopped by Trotsky's forces. The party's leaders and many members were arrested and imprisoned, but were treated more leniently than other opponents of the Bolsheviks.|$|E
5|$|As the {{defending}} champion, Kuznetsova took a wildcard into <b>the</b> <b>Kremlin</b> Cup, {{knowing that she}} had to win the title to qualify for Singapore. Kuznetsova handled the pressure well; defeating Alizé Cornet, Tímea Babos, Elina Svitolina and Daria Gavrilova in the final to win the title. This win automatically took the place in the last spot at WTA Finals {{for the first time since}} 2009 and also meant that Kuznetsova managed to successfully defend a title for the first time in her career.|$|E

5|$|In 1980-81 {{representatives from}} the Eastern Bloc nations met at <b>the</b> <b>Kremlin</b> to discuss the Polish situation.

Even so, some artists and writers joined the family at the graveside for the interment.|$|E

5|$|Lissitzky, {{aware of}} severe {{mismatch}} between his {{ideas and the}} existing urban landscape, experimented with different configurations of the horizontal surface and height-to-width ratios so that the structure appeared balanced visually ("spatial balance is in the contrast of vertical and horizontal tensions"). The raised platform was shaped {{in a way that}} each of its four facets looked distinctly different. Each tower faced <b>the</b> <b>Kremlin</b> with the same facet, providing a pointing arrow to pedestrians on the streets. All eight buildings were planned identically, so Lissitzky proposed color-coding them for easier orientation.|$|E
5|$|On one {{occasion}} {{in the summer}} of 2004, President Putin chastised the national football team for their behavior during the playing of the anthem. During the opening ceremonies of the 2004 European Football Championship, the team was caught on camera chewing gum during the Russian anthem. Through Leonid Tyagachev, then head of the Russian Olympic Committee, Putin told the team to stop chewing gum and to sing the anthem. Gennady Shvets, then the Russian Olympic Committee's press chief, denied being contacted by <b>the</b> <b>Kremlin</b> but said he was aware of displeasure with the players' behaviour.|$|E
5|$|Sigismund III {{subsequently}} {{rejected the}} compromise solution and demanded the tsar's throne for himself, {{which would mean}} complete subjugation of Russia, and as such {{was rejected by the}} bulk of the Russian society. Sigismund's refusal and demands only intensified the chaos, as the Swedes proposed their own candidate and took over Veliki Novgorod. The result of this situation and of the ruthless Commonwealth occupation in Moscow and elsewhere in Russia was the 1611 popular Russian anti-Polish uprising, heavy fighting in Moscow and a siege of the Polish garrison occupying <b>the</b> <b>Kremlin.</b>|$|E
