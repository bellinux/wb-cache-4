40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to analyze all {{existing}} structural solution from hardware manufacturers to build sheet-fed systems and group them according to basic characteristics, identify and investigate the impact {{of each of the}} above factors on the quality of printing on a different types of material. In the course of the studies were analyzed building of sheet-fed systems more than 60 offset presses such manufacturers: Heidelberg, manroland, KBA, Mitsubishi, Komori, Hamada, Ryobi, Shinohara, Sakurai. Each sheet printing machine, which was filed, was separated basic parameters and design features: maximum size sheet, number of sections, speed, availability and type of coup sheet system, type of <b>transfer</b> <b>cylinder,</b> diameter of printed cylinder, type of grippers. During the studies analyzed in detail the impact of each factor to print quality. The classification can clearly detect the presence of certain technological features of printing machines or analyze the compatibility of some design decisions. Using classification is also possible to pick up equipment under certain technical problems or optimize existing manufacturing process. ? ?????? ??????????? ??????????? ???? ??????????? ??????????????? ?????? ???????? ???????? ????? ? ??????????? ?? ????????????? ???????? ?????????? ???????? ??????????...|$|E
40|$|Direct <b>transfer</b> <b>cylinders</b> {{are usually}} imaged from positives created {{off of the}} camera back. In this thesis a method was {{proposed}} to create positives from a dot-generating laser scanner that would fit the requirements of direct <b>transfer</b> <b>cylinders.</b> A test gray scale was scanned and a positive produced which contained square dots as opposed to round dots. This positive was used to etch a cylinder and then the cylinder was run on the Champlaln rotogravure press, located {{in the school of}} printing. From the printed results of the first test positive a tone reproduction study was performed to determine how subsequent positives should be made to achieve an improved reproduction. A required camera curve was derived from the tone reproduction study and programmed into the scanner. The positives that conformed to this predetermined curve were chosen as the best reproductions by a panel of six jurors who were shown prints consisting of differing tone reproduction curves. The conclusions of the study illustrate {{that it is possible to}} use the laser scanner to produce direct transfer positives that fit the requirements of the system. However, it is pointed out in detail that the screened positives alone cannot fully determine tone reproduction because of the inherent problems of etching affecting cell width and depth...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Here {{we report}} {{a study of}} joint-action {{coordination}} in transferring objects. Fourteen dyads were asked to repeatedly reposition a cylinder in a shared workspace without using dialogue. Variations in task constraints concerned {{the size of the}} two target regions in which the cylinder had to be (re) positioned and the size and weight of the <b>transferred</b> <b>cylinder.</b> Movements of the wrist, index Wnger and thumb of both actors were recorded by means of a 3 D motiontracking system. Data analyses focused on the interpersonal transfer of lifting-height and movement-speed variations. Whereas the analyses of variance did not reveal any interpersonal transfer eVects targeted data comparisons demonstrated that the actor who fetched the cylinder from where the other actor had put it was systematically less surprised by cylinder-weight changes than the actor who was Wrst confronted with such changes. In addition, a moderate, accuracy-constraint independent adaptation to each other’s movement speed was found. The current Wndings suggest that motor resonance plays only a moderate role in collaborative motor control and conWrm the independency between sensorimotor and cognitive processing of action-related information...|$|R

Simulation models adopted {{in the design of}} reciprocating compressors are generally based on lumped formulation and rely on empirical correlations for different physical phenomena, including the gas-to-wall heat <b>transfer</b> in the <b>cylinder.</b> The present paper reports a numerical study of heat <b>transfer</b> inside the <b>cylinder</b> of a simplified geometry of reciprocating compressor, considering the effect of fluid flow through the valves. Predictions for the instantaneous heat transfer at the walls are obtained for actual operating conditions and compared with estimates given by correlations commonly adopted for reciprocating compressors. It is shown that the increase of heat transfer during the suction and discharge processes is not properly accounted for by such correlations. Based on the predictions, a new correlation for the in-cylinder heat transfer is put forward and tested in different operating conditions...|$|R
