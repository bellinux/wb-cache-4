5|$|The Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998 (c.23) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom {{that protects}} whistleblowers from {{detrimental}} treatment by their employer. Influenced by various financial scandals and accidents, {{along with the}} report of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, the bill was introduced to Parliament by Richard Shepherd and given government support, on the condition that it become an amendment to the Employment Rights Act 1996. After receiving the Royal Assent on 2 July 1998, the Act came into force on 2 July 1999. It protects employees who make disclosures of certain <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>information,</b> including evidence of illegal activity or damage to the environment, from retribution from their employers, such as dismissal or being passed over for promotion. In cases where such retribution takes place the employee may bring a case before an employment tribunal, which can award compensation.|$|E
50|$|According to the multifactor transfer-appropriate {{processing}} account, {{the generation}} task forces participants {{to focus their}} processing on the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> needed to solve the generation task. When a later test is sensitive to the same <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>information,</b> a generation effect occurs. However, when {{there is not a}} match between the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> processed to solve the generation task and the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> needed to do well on a later test, the generation effect does not occur. For example, a participant that is required to generate same-category targets from distinctive semantic cues (e.g., PURR-C_T, SADDLE-H_RS_) is likely to notice similarities between the targets (e.g., they are all animals). This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> manipulation would promote whole-list relational processing, which may enhance generation performance on a free recall test. Other manipulations can emphasise cue-target processing, thus helping generation performance on cued recall tests.|$|R
30|$|The {{analysis}} on the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> provided (obtained from gum tree or without artificial synthetic gum) did not significantly affect WTP. Previous consumer studies reported, on the contrary, a significant influence <b>of</b> the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> on consumers’ food preferences, and in particular, on consumers’ products evaluation, purchase intention, and willingness to pay (Chandon and Wansink 2007; Gifford and Bernard 2011; Chrysochou and Grunert 2014; Berry et al. 2017). Such discrepancy might relate to the specific carrier used in current study. Chewing gum was chosen, among other reasons, for its low emotional involvement. This might explain why different <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> had low influence on consumers’ preferences.|$|R
40|$|Neuroimaging {{evidence}} is conflicting regarding whether human prefrontal cortex (PFC) shows functional organization by <b>type</b> <b>of</b> processes engaged or <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> processed. Most studies use complex working or long-term memory tasks requiring multiple processes and the combinations of processes recruited for different materials may vary. Using functional {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) and simple tasks suggested by a component process approach, we found activity in left PFC when participants thought about (refreshed) a just-seen item and in right PFC when participants noted whether an item had been presented previously. Furthermore, the distribution of activation in left or right PFC varied with <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>information.</b> Thus, at the component process level, PFC shows functional organization by both process and <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>information...</b>|$|R
5|$|In neuroscience, a {{great deal}} of effort has gone into {{investigating}} how the perceived world of conscious awareness is constructed inside the brain. The process is generally thought to involve two primary mechanisms: (1) hierarchical processing of sensory inputs, and (2) memory. Signals arising from sensory organs are transmitted to the brain and then processed in a series of stages, which extract multiple <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> from the raw input. In the visual system, for example, sensory signals from the eyes are transmitted to the thalamus and then to the primary visual cortex; inside the cerebral cortex they are sent to areas that extract features such as three-dimensional structure, shape, color, and motion. Memory comes into play in at least two ways. First, it allows sensory information to be evaluated in the context of previous experience. Second, and even more importantly, working memory allows information to be integrated over time so that it can generate a stable representation of the world—Gerald Edelman expressed this point vividly by titling one of his books about consciousness The Remembered Present. In computational neuroscience, Bayesian approaches to brain function have been used to understand both the evaluation of sensory information in light of previous experience, and the integration of information over time. Bayesian models of the brain are probabilistic inference models, in which the brain takes advantage of prior knowledge to interpret uncertain sensory inputs in order to formulate a conscious percept; Bayesian models have successfully predicted many perceptual phenomena in vision and the nonvisual senses.|$|E

40|$|Aiming bias {{typically}} influences perception but action {{towards the}} illusory stimulus is often unaffected. Recent studies, however, {{have shown that}} the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> available is a predictor for the expression of action bias. In the present cyclical aiming experiment, the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> (retinal and extra-retinal) was manipulated in order to investigate the differential contributions of different cues on both eye and hand movements. The results showed that a Müller-Lyer illusion caused very similar perturbation effects on hand and eye-movement amplitudes and this bias was mediated by the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> available on-line. Interestingly, the impact of the illusion on goal-directed movement was smaller, when information about the figure but not the hand was provided for on-line control. Saccadic information did not influence the size of the effect of a Müller-Lyer illusion on hand movements. Furthermore, the illusions did not alter the eye-hand coordination pattern. The timing of saccade termination was strongly linked to hand movement kinematics. The present results are not consistent with current dichotomous models of perception and action or movement planning and on-line control. Rather, they suggest that the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> available for movement planning mediates the size of the illusory effects. Overall, it has been demonstrated that movement planning and control processes are versatile operations, which have the ability to adapt to the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> available. status: publishe...|$|R
