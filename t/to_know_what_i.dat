5|$|We made it {{very clear}} we were not doing another record for TVT. But they made it pretty clear they weren't ready to sell. So I felt like, well, I've finally got this thing going but it's dead. Flood and I had to record Broken under a {{different}} band name, because if TVT found out we were recording, they could confiscate all our shit and release it. Jimmy Iovine got involved with Interscope, and we kind of got slave-traded. It wasn't my doing. I didn't know anything about Interscope. And I was real pissed off at him at first because it was going from one bad situation to potentially another one. But Interscope went into it like they really wanted <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> wanted. It was good, after I put my raving lunatic act on.|$|E
25|$|I {{used to have}} {{to punch}} a time clock at Columbia. Every day of my life. That's what it was like. I was under {{exclusive}} contract, like they owned me… I think he had my dressing room bugged… He was very possessive of me as a person, he didn't want me to go out with anybody, have any friends. No one can live that way. So I fought him… You want <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> think of Harry Cohn? He was a monster.|$|E
500|$|This {{silence was}} an {{exception}} to the practice of oral history among black families. Minnie Lee Langley knew James and Emma Carrier as her parents. She kept the story from her children for 60 years: [...] "I didn't want them <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> came through and I didn't discuss it with none of them... I just didn't want them to know what kind of way I come up. I didn't want them to know white folks want us out of our homes." [...] Decades passed before she began to trust white people. Some families spoke of Rosewood, but forbade the stories from being told: Arnett Doctor heard the story from his mother, Philomena Goins Doctor, who was with Sarah Carrier the day Fannie Taylor claimed she was assaulted, and was in the house with Sylvester Carrier. She told her children about Rosewood every Christmas. Doctor was consumed by his mother's story; he would bring it up to his aunts only to be dissuaded from speaking of it.|$|E

2500|$|According to Scott Speedman, {{the actor}} who portrays Michael in the franchise, about how his [...] "personal lack of gun {{knowledge}} worked in his favor"; [...] "I get to carry a gun once in the movie and I didn't know what I was doing, and that was appropriate. I'm the [...] "girlfriend". Every time I've got this shocked look {{on my face and}} she throws me to the ground. I'm screaming in terror. When I was watching it I was like, [...] "Wow, how weird."

2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the '68 Special project, a nervous Presley had said to the executive producer Bob Finkel: [...] "I want everyone <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> can really do." [...] Critics generally agree that had happened – in addition to making profitable, but generally uninspired movies and soundtracks. The '68 Special is widely credited with revitalizing his career: chart statistics for the summer of 1968 suggest that Presley's recording career was becoming all but non-existent and irrelevant. After the special, he began his stint in Las Vegas and toured, achieving a string of record-breaking sell-out performances across America. Chart successes returned, including a U.S. number one in 1969 ("Suspicious Minds") and a U.K. number one ("The Wonder of You", (1970)) – his first since 1965.|$|E
2500|$|International {{opposition}} and criticism {{from both the}} Catholic Party and the Labour Party caused the Belgian parliament to compel the king to cede the Congo Free State to Belgium in 1908. The deal {{that led to the}} handover cost Belgium the considerable sum of 215.5 million Francs. This was used to discharge the debt of the Congo Free state and to pay out its bond holders as well as 45.5 million for Leopold's pet building projects in Belgium and a personal payment of 50 million to him. [...] The Congo Free State was transformed into a Belgian colony known as the Belgian Congo under parliamentary control. Leopold {{went to great lengths to}} conceal potential evidence of wrongdoing during his time as ruler of his private colony. The entire archive of the Congo Free State was burned and he told his aide that even though the Congo had been taken from him, 'they have no right <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> did there.' ...|$|E
2500|$|Okereke is {{extremely}} shy. He has expressed disdain for interviews, asking one interviewer from Skyscraper magazine, [...] "Why {{is it important}} <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> had for breakfast? Or who I went to bed with? Or what sneakers I am wearing? If it's relevant to understanding my music, then so be it. But if it's purely to satisfy the media's obsession with celebrity, then no thanks. I don't want to play that game." [...] The focus of one interview with NME in July 2005 was largely {{to do with his}} dislike of being interviewed. In it he implied that the media placed deliberate emphasis on conflicts between bands {{and did not want to}} be drawn into such publicity, saying that [...] "public feuding between bands is completely pointless." [...] Okereke has also said, [...] "people think that I hate being approached but that's not true" [...] in NME on 15 September 2005. In 2005 Okereke appeared on the front cover of Australian queer zine They Shoot Homos Don't They? ...|$|E

60|$|Nevertheless, {{with respect}} to the good and polite German's poetically-contemplated, and finely æsthetic, tea, may it not be asked whether poppy leaves themselves, like the bread and butter, are not, if we may venture an opinion--too thin,--im-properly thin? In the last chapter, my reader was, I hope, a little anxious <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> meant by saying that modern {{philosophers}} did not know {{the meaning of the word}} 'proper,' and may wish <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> mean by it myself.
