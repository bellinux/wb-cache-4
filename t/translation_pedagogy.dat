40|$|Research in {{translation}} studies has paid relatively {{little attention to}} <b>translation</b> <b>pedagogy</b> and how students, as potential professional translators, may understand and apply the range of current theories and concepts to practical translation tasks. This research explores the construction of translation knowledge and its application with groups of postgraduate students from two universities in China {{and one in the}} UK. In the light of new insights into translation teaching, this exploration focuses on the application of translation theories and pedagogical issues. The thesis investigates the three cases qualitatively to ascertain {{the extent to which the}} participants used theoretical elements, their perspectives on translation theory, together with comments from Chinese and British translation teachers and the documents of translation courses similar to the case study programmes. This study aims to provide empirically an in-depth understanding of the construction of translation knowledge and expertise related to students’ learning of translation, translation theories and their application and the complexity of these features in their particular social contexts of learning. The research employs the triangulated methods of analysing a translation task performed by students, subsequent interviews with them and with translation teachers, and the analysis of documents relating to British and Chinese translation courses. Data analyses within and across the three cases of translation programmes serve the exploration from triangulated perspectives. Additional complementary data are analysed to support the results. The findings indicate that the differences between and across the three groups are partly due to local contextual and institutional variation, but are largely due to different conceptions of the roles of translation theories and <b>translation</b> <b>pedagogy.</b> Explorations of the three programmes show the features between them, in particular how the two Chinese groups have inadequate knowledge of translation. The findings indicate how constraints on the two Chinese groups promote a tendency towards incompetence {{in translation}} performance, through relatively incoherent course content, lack of pedagogical planning, and lack of practical and professional training. This shows a need to reconceptualise <b>translation</b> <b>pedagogy</b> in the Chinese cases, and arguably in similar Chinese contexts; findings show that traditional language pedagogy with non-specialist teachers remains the chief element in <b>translation</b> <b>pedagogy.</b> The principal findings are further evaluated and interpreted by considering linguistic approaches, the use of translation briefs, the quality of translators, a holistic view of translation theories and the need for enhanced systematic <b>translation</b> <b>pedagogy</b> in Chinese translation studies contexts. A need is shown for Chinese students to learn to go beyond the mechanisms of putting one language in terms of another. Developments could include the holistic consideration of combining translation product-process-translator processes, as shown in a chart derived from Williams’ (2013). These findings are corroborated by the reflections and comments from university teachers of translation in China. The results contribute to a wider understanding of translation theories and pedagogy applicable to translation teaching in a Chinese context. Further suggestions include practical ideas to enhance <b>translation</b> <b>pedagogy</b> in China...|$|E

It also investigates the problems encountered by fourth-year English department students of El-Mergib University in Libya in translating relative clauses from English into Arabic and vice versa. Despite {{the fact that}} some studies have been conducted that include relativization in English and Arabic, none of them could be considered comprehensive. Therefore, this thesis {{presents a}} detailed discussion of relativization in both languages and examines translation between them. It can also be considered as an attempt to suggest a link between contrastive linguistics and translation studies. It also aims to persuade the officials of the University of El-Mergib to revise the teaching programme at the department of English and/or to establish a new programme in which translation is taught as a separate course. This is shown in the remedial solutions suggested in the conclusion chapter of this thesis. The thesis comprises seven chapters. Chapter One is an introduction to the study. Chapter Two reviews the relevant literature on contrastive studies and relativization in the world’s languages with an emphasis on English-Arabic relativization. Chapter Three presents a theoretical discussion of <b>translation</b> theories, <b>pedagogy,</b> and assessment. Chapter Four gives a theoretical background to relativization in English, relativization in Arabic, and a contrastive study between them. Chapter Five presents the research methodology and design. Chapter Six presents the quantitative and qualitative data analysis. This chapter is the empirical part of the research. It focuses on the description of students’ errors. Chapter Seven (the last one) deals with the conclusion, presents some remedial solutions, gives some recommendations for the University of El-Mergib to overcome the students’ difficulties in translating relative clauses from English into Arabic and vice versa, and suggests some topics for further research. ...|$|R

40|$|Current {{scholarship}} in <b>translation</b> <b>pedagogy</b> {{calls for a}} paradigm shift towards a learner-centered and socio-constructivist approach to translator education. This view is founded on translating as a socially situated act of intercultural communication anchored in socio-cognitive abilities, and translation learning as multi-componential and sequential. Instruction in translation is thus seen to benefit from process- rather than product-oriented teaching and a focus on learners' textual and discursive competence. In spite of significant progress {{over the last decade}} the empirical basis of translation teaching theory and methods remains scant. A lack of attention to the "human factor" in translator education research (students and educators, in favor of processes, content and activities) is particularly conspicuous (Kelly 2008). As the field of <b>translation</b> <b>pedagogy</b> consolidates with ever more refined frameworks that pull teaching designs away from teacher- and text-centered classes to become more learner and learning/teaching-based, {{little is known about the}} nature of <b>translation</b> <b>pedagogy</b> ‘on the ground’ in diverse locations of the globe: by whom and how is translation taught, under what constraints, and to what effects. This qualitative study is grounded in second language (L 2) teacher cognition research (e. g. Borg 2006, Phipps and Borg 2009), representations of translation as 'inquiry' (Sakai 2010, Cronin 2000, 2003, Venuti 2016) and recent socio-constructivist and sequenced and process-focused translation teaching approaches (Kiraly 2000, Colina 2003, 2015, Hurtado Albir 1999, González Davies 2004, Kelly 2005). From these frameworks, it examines the professional biographies, knowledge base, beliefs and practices of Chilean translation instructors at three different universities, as well as the views and experiences of approximately 50 of these instructors' students regarding their understanding and experiences of translation and instruction in the classroom. Additionally, in order to contribute to the developing 'rapprochement' between translation studies and second language education, findings on the strengths and challenges of undergraduate <b>translation</b> <b>pedagogy</b> derived from these two studies are discussed in a third article in light of the contributions from socio-culturally-oriented L 2 education research, particularly multiliteracies approaches to FL teaching (Kern 2000, Byrnes 2005, 2006, Maxim 2009, Kramsch 2011, 2006, Paesani et al. 2015, Swaffar and Arens 2005) ...|$|E

40|$|My paper {{discusses}} the research findings of my project on service-learning, social activism, sign language translators and <b>Translation</b> Studies <b>pedagogy.</b> Since August 2013, I {{have been working}} closely with two NGOs who care for deaf people in Hong Kong. My students served those NGOs as language and translation major. The outcomes of their services include a short film, translated sign language textbook, website materials, and subtitles of films for Deaf Film Festivals in Hong Kong. Pedagogically, they have found service-learning tremendously helpful for them to better acquire the subject knowledge of Translation Studies. It has also broadened their social awareness as well as career horizon. From the collected empirical data, I will argue that service-learning has made substantial difference for my students. Service-learning has also empowered my research capacity. It inspires me {{to embark on a}} new research frontier, namely the history and status quo of sign language translators of Hong Kong. This is a ground-breaking attempt both in fields of Deaf Studies and Translation Studies. Blessed with enthusiastic support from local deaf communities, sign translators and activists, I have conducted over a dozen in-depth interviews with veteran sign translators. Had it not been my first interest in service-learning, my research profile wouldn 2 ̆ 7 t have been so enriched. The recent 2 ̆ 2 Occupy Central 2 ̆ 2 social movement in Hong Kong provides timely evidence of the validity of my research on social activism and sign translation. Activist-translators have played a pivotal role in assisting deaf people {{to take part in the}} Occupy movement for over two months. Thanks to dedicated, conscientious sign translators, deaf people are able to 2 ̆ 2 voice 2 ̆ 2 their concerns for social justice, get informed and educated of the subject matter, and be involved in various acts of resistance. Based on the various perspectives mentioned above, my paper discusses how service-learning opens the door for translation students as well as the researcher to understand, and participate in social issues. The benefits of service-learning for teaching, learning and research are complex and multifaceted. In the very least, my paper shows how service-learning greatly facilitates our critical reflection on identity, marginality of sign language and deafness, social activism, and politics of translation...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{spite of}} a {{relatively}} great variety of theoretical approaches to translation, translation theory mainly deals, irrespective of how elaborate it is, with fidelity to either the letter or {{the spirit of a}} message.

The choices discussed here refer to both translation theory and <b>translation</b> <b>pedagogy.</b> Thus, for an undergraduate course in translating/interpreting designed to meet both academic and vocational requirements a communicative translation model is chosen as theoretical background for a training focused on translation as an end product rather than on translation as a process.

Grucza (2004), the central determiner of attainment in <b>translation</b> <b>pedagogy</b> is a set of skills to be developed in a student translator. This set embraces linguistic-cultural skills, translation skills as well as other skills which may significantly affect the degree to which students master translation. The author of this paper will focus, in particular, on the possibility of developing 4 major groups of translator competences ‒ based on competence models proposed by PACTE group (2003) or EMT expert group (2009) and pertaining to: language, culture, text and translation problem-solving ‒ with the implementation of ethnographic, empirical, dialogic and comparative teaching methods, derived from M. Byram's (1997, 2008) Intercultural Approach to foreign language teaching...|$|E
40|$|Since the 1990 s, {{the study}} of {{translation}} at university level has expanded exponentially, {{both in terms of}} translator training programs and as a component of foreign-language curricula. This paper concentrates on the latter in particular, discussing the polarized tendency, at work in certain environments, towards narrowly philological approaches {{on the one hand and}} narrow vocationalism on the other. Special focus is then placed on an approach to <b>translation</b> <b>pedagogy</b> assumed to mitigate this polarization. At its core is an understanding of translation as transferable generic learning, i. e. as an activity that provides access to a range of widely applicable skills and attributes. After a brief contextualization of these learning outcomes, the suggested approach is discussed in terms of the challenges it poses to both implementation and empirical study, and then a tentative agenda for future research is attempted...|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} {{effective}} and innovative <b>translation</b> <b>pedagogy</b> has been drawing increasing attention in recent years, but {{the training of}} adaptive and elastic competence is somewhat overlooked. This study investigates the importance of strategic translation through the theoretical lens of Verschueren's (1998) Adaptation Theory. The analysis {{is based on a}} case study of the 2001 Sino-American Hainan airplane collision crisis, and in particular the pivotal role of different versions of the American "two sorries" letter in facilitating the resolution. It highlights the need to incorporate language adaptation and the interests of all parties in a translation. This study argues that translation is a negotiable and adaptable process, influenced by both overt and covert components, and that this process should be reflected in translation education by foste 1 ing the ability to get behind the text to cater to the interests of all interested parties: that is, to cultivate adaptive and elastic competence. The findings suggest that a realistic, balanced, and robust account of adaptation and elasticity is needed for effective translation education...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the profile of}} the translator in Cameroon and posits that the translating activity is increasingly becoming part of the translation service, reflecting the market expectation to train translation service providers rather than translators. The paper demonstrates that the translation profession as it is performed in the field and portrayed in job adverts reveals that a wide range of employers are looking for translators and their services. A survey of the Cameroonian translation market was carried out to raise awareness of the language skills translators need in order to work successfully as language services providers. The data for this study was obtained from 36 professionaltranslators drawn from the public service, the freelance and in-house corporate translation market in Cameroon. The study argues that today’s new translator’s profile and his activities are basically variants of interlingual communication in which the traditional concept of translation constitutes only one option and that these ‘add-ons,’which contribute to a better professionalization of the translator,pose new challenges to <b>translation</b> <b>pedagogy</b> in terms of both content and methodology. In this vein the study proposes a translational language teaching model aimed at making training more responsive to market exigencies in this era of modernization...|$|E
40|$|Since the 1990 s, the {{academic}} study of translation has expanded exponentially, {{both in terms}} of translator training programmes and as component of modern language curricula with a view to enhancing communicative skills. The latter phenomenon, though undoubtedly an improvement on the ostracism translation was typically subject to, is not entirely problem-free. The article will briefly touch upon a number of shortcomings identified in the specific context of Italian higher education, in particular the marked polarization between philological and vocational impulses. Special focus will be then placed on an alternative approach to the teaching of translation in modern language degrees that is assumed to overcome the mentioned dichotomy and enhance student employability and personal development. This approach envisages the teaching of communicative translation with an explicit focus on the transferable generic skills this practice provides access to. After a conceptual contextualization of these learning outcomes, the suggested model of <b>translation</b> <b>pedagogy</b> will be discussed in terms of the implications it yields as far as actual implementation is concerned. Although the problem statement refers to the specificity of the Italian context, the proposed pedagogical approach is believed to have value as well as application potential in other environments as wel...|$|E
40|$|Error {{analysis}} and product assessment are increasingly viewed as reductive procedures in <b>translation</b> <b>pedagogy.</b> In the current paper, a case {{is made for}} ‘rehabilitating’ error analysis, especially in advanced L 2 translation teaching. Attention is drawn to its usefulness in creating a group profile for L 2 translation trainees, particularly as regards the scope it offers for showing how aspects of linguistic transfer frequently considered marginal, when taken individually, are, on the contrary, significant if viewed cumulatively. In {{the course of the}} article it is suggested that error analysis can be used dynamically to show that apparently sporadic and ‘low level’ aspects of transfer are among the most frequent problems, and that they consistently interlock with ‘higher-level’ textual and contextual (if not cultural) considerations. Far from encouraging a transmissionist stance {{on the part of the}} L 1 teachers normally responsible for L 2 translation courses, error analysis can be used to empower L 2 students. One way in which this can be done is through a focus on technologies that address the issues emerging from the analysis. This should make students increasingly independent of the intuitive, internalized knowledge of their trainers, both in the short term and in the course of their professional careers...|$|E
40|$|Translation {{theory has}} faced {{criticism}} from professional translators for adopting an ivory tower stance to the ‘real world’ challenges of translation. This article {{argues that a}} {{case can be made}} for considering the challenges of translation as it takes place in the school classroom. In support of such an argument the pedagogue as translator is seen to occupy a pivotal position, such that the insights from translation theory, understanding translation as an inter-linguistic act, can be combined and bridged with the burgeoning field of <b>translation</b> <b>pedagogy,</b> focusing on how the practice of (inter-linguistic) translation might be taught and learned in the school classroom. Extending the sphere of influence of translation, it is argued that the pedagogue as translator is concerned with teaching pupils in the classroom how to engage in making meaning in their respective subjects. This requires acts of translation from and with something heard or seen with respect to the subject concerned, in order to make into personal knowledge. After an initial presentation of a particular understanding of translation theory inspired by Walter Benjamin 2 ̆ 7 s famous essay on ‘The Task of the Translator’, examples of bridging are presented in the teaching of translation skills in two classroom subjects: teaching English as a foreign language and teaching natural science...|$|E
40|$|While the {{presence}} of mobile electronic devices in the classroom has posed real challenges to instructors, {{a growing number of}} teachers believe they should seize the chance {{to improve the quality of}} instruction. The advent of new mobile technologies (laptops, smartphones, tablets, etc.) in the translation classroom has opened up new opportunities for translator trainers to facilitate the process of translator education. The present paper investigates the use of mobile devices in the classroom particularly for <b>translation</b> <b>pedagogy.</b> A focus group interview of translation instructors with experience in using mobile tools in their translation classes was followed by a survey sent to a group of English Persian translation instructors of which 26 people filled out the questionnaire completely. The participants of the study provided both qualitative and quantitative data regarding the application of mobile devices in their translation classes. The results showed that the majority of teachers encouraged their advanced level students to use mobile tools for doing classroom assignments followed by note-taking, using terminology databases, searching the Internet, using language resources and contacting their group members. The findings highlight the potentials of mobile devices to have a positive impact on the translation classroom activities and underline the need for their systematic integration into the translation curriculum as part of the tools contributing to the development of technological competence.           Keywords: application, mobile devices, translation classroom, translator educatio...|$|E
