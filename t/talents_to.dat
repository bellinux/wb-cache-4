5|$|Steve Burke {{served as}} the audio lead on the Kameo project, his first at Rare, for which he {{composed}} its soundtrack and contributed to its sound effects and voiceovers. As the game was originally planned for the GameCube, {{the first few months}} of development appeared to have no support for audio above the MIDI sample-style compositions characteristic of Nintendo's previous console, the Nintendo 64. The game's first demo at the 2001 Electronic Entertainment Expo used this type of audio. Of the first pieces he wrote for this project in the early months of 2001, some were scrapped. Others were re-recorded as streaming audio, which plays pre-recorded audio files, when the developers added support. It became Rare's first orchestral soundtrack. Other Rare staff members contributed their <b>talents</b> <b>to</b> the recording process, such as trumpet and voice recordings.|$|E

Alchemy was sealed away in the past, however, and {{the world in the}} present age has become seemingly devoid of this power. However, in various places throughout the world, people demonstrate an aptitude to manipulate one of the elements through a form of magic called Psynergy.
