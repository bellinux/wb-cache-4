50|$|Therefore, the {{individual}} who obtains a large package of food (in cases where this seldom happens) will face asymmetric contests over food. Thus, the obtainer will not benefit from fighting over less valuable portions. However, latecomers who have not obtained food on their own will have much to gain even from the less valuable portions. It is not worth the effort for a food-obtainer to fight over these portions, and so the obtainer {{should be expected to}} relinquish these without a fight since it would likely lose to the latecomer. Thus, another expectation is that natural selection will favor the ability <b>to</b> <b>assess</b> <b>costs</b> and benefits. Among frequently interacting individuals, the roles of obtainer and latecomer/thief will interchange, balancing out benefits of latecomer gains and obtainer losses (reciprocation develops to avoid injury). Equal (reciprocal) sharing is the eventual consequence from this tolerated theft behavior. When food packages are small to begin with, then theft will be less tolerated as portions will have lower returns along the assumed diminishing value curve. Hoarding is expected in cases where either food can be defended, there is a season of scarcity, a synchronous glut (ex. salmon run or agricultural harvest), or when accumulated food no longer follows a diminishing curve (ex. Financial capital). Scrounging is expected to increase among groups when active foragers miss out on sharing opportunities due to their own acts of less successful foraging. Foragers do worse than scroungers because scroungers are able to participate in 100% of sharing events.|$|E

However, there is little standardization with regard to modeling practices, and the quality and usefulness of economic and health outcomes models may vary. We propose the following set of recommendations for good modeling practices {{to be used in}} both the development and review of models. These recommendations are divided into three sections: criteria to be addressed before model development or initial review; criteria used during model development or evaluation; and criteria used following model development. These recommendations also include examples regarding different modeling techniques and practices as well as a checklist (see appendix) to assess model correspondence with the recommendations. We hope that the use of good practice recommendations for modeling will not only improve the development and review of models but also lead to greater acceptance of this methodology...|$|E
40|$|Home-based health {{services}} remain {{one of the}} fastest-growing sectors in the Canadian healthcare system. While there have been studies addressing the characteristics of home care users and the determinants of utilization, the costs {{associated with the use of}} home care services, particularly private costs, have been largely neglected. To gain a comprehensive appreciation of the financing context in which ambulatory and home-based care is delivered and received, it is imperative <b>to</b> <b>assess</b> <b>costs</b> incurred by clients and their family/friends. Accordingly, this study examined the magnitude and determinants of the share of private costs incurred by Ontarians who received in-home publicly financed services and by their unpaid caregivers. The private share of costs was found to be 75 %. Determinants of the private share included participants’ gender, martial status, functioning in activities of daily living and the type and length of service received. These findings suggest that recipients of home-based {{health services}} in Ontario may bear an economic burden when care is shifted into the home setting...|$|E

40|$|The INDES {{project and}} related working papers focus on market-compatible, {{cost-effective}} {{security of supply}} responses by the EU. Security of supply is understood as insurance against risks, in which responsibility is shared between the EU, member states, energy companies and customers.

40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} this study was to enumerate the annual {{morbidity}} and mortality incidence and estimate the direct and indirect costs associated with occupational injuries and illnesses in Bangkok in 2008. In this study, data on workmen compensation claims and costs from the Thai Workmen Compensation Fund, Social Security Office of Ministry of Labor, were aggregated and analyzed. Methods: <b>To</b> <b>assess</b> <b>costs,</b> this study focuses on direct costs associated with the payment of workmen compensation claims for medical care and health services. Results: A total of 52, 074 nonfatal cases of occupational injury were reported, with an overall incidence rate of 16. 9 per 1, 000. The incidence rate for male workers was four times higher than that for female workers. Out of a total direct cost of $ 13. 87 million, $ 9. 88 million were for medical services and related expenses and $ 3. 98 million for compensable reimbursement. The estimated amount of noncompensated lost earnings was an additional $ 2. 66 million. Conclusion: Occupational injuries and illnesses contributed to the total cost; it has been estimated that workers' compensation covers less than one-half to one-tenth of this cost...|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of Game Theory {{to the study}} of behaviour has shown that it is possible, in theory, to have stable equilibria with individuals in a population behaving in different ways. In order to test for colony type selection or nesting strategies in this species, breeding success, site tenacity and mate selection should be monitored on a long term basis. An investigation of the reproductive biology and behaviour of Great Black-backed Gulls was undertaken to provide preliminary data to design such project. [...] The effects of habitat or colony type selection on reproductive output was assessed in a one year study by comparing the breeding biology and behaviour of Great Black-backed Gulls in two different environments, namely a mono-specific and a mixed-species colony. Many aspects of the breeding biology of Great Black-backed Gulls were similar between colonies but important behavioural differences were observed. [...] There is some evidence that colony type selection fits the model of “ideal free distribution (Fretwell and Lucas, 1970) and acts as a breeding strategy in Great Black-backed Gulls.
