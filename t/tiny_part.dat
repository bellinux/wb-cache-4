Although the only highway in Melrose is a <b>tiny</b> <b>part</b> of Route 99, the city has access to many nearby {{highways}} including Route 1 in Saugus, Interstate 93 in Stoneham, Massachusetts Route 16 In Everett and Route 128/Interstate 95 in Wakefield. The city is also served by the MBTA. Service includes five bus routes: 106, 131, 132, 136 and 137. There are three commuter rail stations: Wyoming Hill, Melrose/Cedar Park, and Melrose Highlands. Oak Grove, the northern terminus of the MBTA's Orange Line subway system, is located in Malden on the Melrose city line. Oak Grove is primarily a park-and-ride station with 788 parking spaces.|$|E
500|$|A key {{component}} of the arousal system is the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), a <b>tiny</b> <b>part</b> of the hypothalamus located directly above {{the point at which}} the optic nerves from the two eyes cross. The SCN contains the body's central biological clock. Neurons there show activity levels that rise and fall with a period of about 24 hours, circadian rhythms: these activity fluctuations are driven by rhythmic changes in expression of a set of [...] "clock genes". The SCN continues to keep time even if it is excised from the brain and placed in a dish of warm nutrient solution, but it ordinarily receives input from the optic nerves, through the retinohypothalamic tract (RHT), that allows daily light-dark cycles to calibrate the clock.|$|E
2500|$|The City of London is a {{city and}} county that {{contains}} the historic centre and central business district of London. It constituted most of London from its settlement by the Romans in the 1st century AD to the Middle Ages, but the agglomeration has since grown far beyond the City's borders.

Administratively, it forms one of the 33 local authority districts of Greater London; however, the City of London is not a London borough, a status reserved for the other 32 districts (including London's only other city, the City of Westminster).|$|E

2500|$|Internal pattern {{generation}} {{operates on}} a wide range of time scales, from milliseconds to hours or longer. [...] One of the most important types of temporal pattern is circadian rhythmicity—that is, rhythmicity with a period of approximately 24 hours. [...] All animals that have been studied show circadian fluctuations in neural activity, which control circadian alternations in behavior such as the sleep-wake cycle. [...] Experimental studies dating from the 1990s have shown that circadian rhythms are generated by a [...] "genetic clock" [...] consisting of a special set of genes whose expression level rises and falls over the course of the day. [...] Animals as diverse as insects and vertebrates share a similar genetic clock system. [...] The circadian clock is influenced by light but continues to operate even when light levels are held constant and no other external time-of-day cues are available. [...] The clock genes are expressed in many parts of the nervous system as well as many peripheral organs, but in mammals, all of these [...] "tissue clocks" [...] are kept in synchrony by signals that emanate from a master timekeeper in a <b>tiny</b> <b>part</b> of the brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus.|$|E

2500|$|In 1680 a {{more extreme}} mood {{appeared}} among {{sections of the}} Covenanter underground, which found expression in a document known as the Sanquhar Declaration. [...] This was the manifesto of the followers of the Reverend Richard Cameron, soon {{to be known as}} the Cameronians. Hitherto, many in the Covenanter underground maintained an outward loyalty to the king, despite their opposition to the religious policy of his government; but the Cameronians took matters to a new height, renouncing their allegiance to Charles and denouncing his brother, James, as a papist. One extreme position inevitably led to another: the government in attempting to stamp out sedition authorized field executions without trial. This was the beginning of what Robert Wodrow later called the Killing Time. Cameron himself was killed in a clash with government forces at Airds Moss in July 1680, but his followers, now a <b>tiny</b> <b>part</b> of the Covenanter movement, continued to exist. After the accession of James VII in 1685 the King issued a series of Letters of Indulgence allowing such [...] "ousted ministers as had lived peaceably and orderly to return to their livings". This succeeded in luring many ministers away from the struggle, but those remaining became more determined. When William of Orange summoned a Convention of the Estates which met on 14 March 1689 in Edinburgh to consider whether Scotland should recognise him or James, forces of Cameronians arrived to bolster William's support. In the subsequent Jacobite rising, the Cameronian Guard helped to defeat the Jacobite Highlanders, particularly at the Battle of Dunkeld. Although the Cameronians had helped to defend the Revolution, they were disappointed that their religious views were not adopted by the new government. The binding obligation of the National Covenant (1638) and the Solemn League and Covenant (1643) was passed over since the acts of parliament in favour of these had been rescinded by Charles and were not revived under William and Mary. For some Covenanters even William of Orange was an [...] "uncovenanted" [...] King since he was head of the Church of England which was an episcopal church. Perhaps 1000 people in the south west made an issue of the failure to maintain the covenants and also, with some justification, viewed the new establishment as tainted by Erastianism. They formed the United Societies refusing to recognise the [...] "usurped" [...] Church of Scotland.|$|E

60|$|It {{was this}} utter {{dependence}} on him, {{the feeling that}} he had rescued something, which gave him sense of anchorage. That, and his buried life in the retreat of these two rooms. Just for an hour in the morning, from nine to ten, the charwoman would come, but not another soul all day. They never went out together. He would stay in bed late, while Wanda bought what they needed for the day's meals; lying on his back, hands clasped behind his head, recalling her face, the movements of her slim, rounded, supple figure, robing itself before his gaze; feeling again the kiss she had left on his lips, the gleam of her soft eyes, so strangely dark in so fair a face. In a sort of trance he would lie till she came back. Then get up to breakfast about noon off things which she had cooked, drinking coffee. In the afternoon he would go out alone and walk for hours, any where, so long as it was East. To the East there was always suffering to be seen, always that which soothed him with {{the feeling that he}} and his troubles were only a <b>tiny</b> <b>part</b> of trouble; that while so many other sorrowing and shadowy creatures lived he was not cut off. To go West was to encourage dejection. In the West all was like Keith, successful, immaculate, ordered, resolute. He would come back tired out, and sit watching her cook their little dinner. The evenings were given up to love. Queer trance of an existence, which both were afraid to break. No sign from her of wanting those excitements which girls who have lived her life, even for a few months, are supposed to need. She never asked him to take her anywhere; never, in word, deed, look, seemed anything but almost rapturously content. And yet he knew, and she knew, that they were only waiting to see whether Fate would turn her thumb down on them. In these days he did not drink. Out of his quarter's money, when it came in, he had paid his debts--their expenses were very small. He never went to see Keith, never wrote to him, hardly thought of him. And from those dread apparitions--Walenn lying with the breath choked out of him, and the little grey, driven animal in the dock--he hid, as only a man can who must hide or be destroyed. But daily he bought a newspaper, and feverishly, furtively scanned its columns.|$|E
