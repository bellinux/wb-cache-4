He went on the say, [...] "this is definitely the kind of stuff I'm planning to do for the next album, incorporate more fusion elements and stuff like that. This is a really good production. I like it because it's little parts with gaps, which I don't normally have. Somebody <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> listen to [...] This is one I'm definitely going to buy I'd like to do more stuff with complicated melodies, everybody playing together, drum breaks, things like that." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, Edith,--if {{he thinks}} it. He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>I</b> <b>should</b> be turning {{all his friends}} against him. So I promised him that I would speak to Sir Peregrine, and break it off if it be possible." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 1st Peas. Oh dear! oh dear! If any man had <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>I</b> <b>should</b> ride {{forty miles}} on this errand, {{to see him}} that went out flesh come home grass, like the flower of the field! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have two}} horses here, sergeant; my own, {{and one of}} Colonel Tempe's. General Chanzy <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> find room here, {{but it does not}} look like it." ...|$|E
6000|$|My {{heart has}} <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> know, [...] In such a lonely place, if one [...] From other worlds came there and stood [...] Between {{me and the}} sun.|$|E

6000|$|... 'He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have to {{pass through}} a wood full {{of all sorts of}} enchantments and voices, which would try to frighten me and make me lose my way.

6000|$|... "I {{would not}} meet him for any earthly consideration.

6000|$|My resentment deepened. Fate {{had played}} me a wanton trick. Cynthia trusted <b>me.</b> If <b>I</b> were weak, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> {{not be the}} only one to suffer.

6000|$|... "Very little--nothing in fact {{but what}} {{she and her sister}} showed me in the morning paper. I know they're in great {{distress}} about him; I just met Miss Suzette and your sister, and they <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> find you at the station." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, well, this is wonderful," [...] Mrs. Vickars {{said when}} her husband had {{finished}} reading the letter.
