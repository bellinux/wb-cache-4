25|$|Magnus was {{selected}} by Gustav I Vasa to become Archbishop, in 1523. As {{he was about to}} travel to Rome to be ordained, a papal bull from Pope Clement VII was received, stating that the previous Archbishop Gustav <b>Trolle,</b> who was at the time in exile abroad, should be reinstated. The papal bull declared the deposition of <b>Trolle</b> unlawful.|$|E
25|$|His brother, Olaus Magnus, had {{meanwhile}} travelled to Rome {{to explain}} the matter of Gustav <b>Trolle</b> to the Pope. In 1533 the Pope finished investigating the <b>Trolle</b> matter and decided that Magnus was the most appropriate successor, and Magnus travelled to Rome to be ordained. However, as Sweden now no longer took direction from the Vatican, both brothers remained in Italy {{for the remainder of}} their lives.|$|E

25|$|After Gustav seized power, the {{previous}} Archbishop, Gustav <b>Trolle,</b> {{who at the}} time held the post of a sort of chancellor, was exiled from the country. Gustav sent a message to Pope Clement VII requesting the acceptance of a new archbishop selected by Gustav himself: Johannes Magnus.|$|E
25|$|The Pope {{sent back}} his {{decision}} demanding that unlawful expulsion of Archbishop Gustav <b>Trolle</b> be rescinded, {{and that the}} archbishop be reinstated. Here Sweden's remote geographical location proved to have a marked impact – for the former Archbishop had been allied with the Danish king, or at least was considered to have been so allied in contemporary Stockholm, and to reinstate him would be close to impossible for Gustav.|$|E
25|$|The Old Norse nouns troll and tröll (variously meaning 'fiend, demon, werewolf, jötunn') and Middle High German troll, <b>trolle</b> 'fiend' (according to philologist Vladimir Orel likely {{borrowed}} from Old Norse) developed from Proto-Germanic neuter noun *trullan. The {{origin of the}} Proto-Germanic word is unknown. Additionally, the Old Norse verb trylla 'to enchant, {{to turn into a}} troll' and the Middle High German verb trüllen 'to flutter' both developed from the Proto-Germanic verb *trulljanan, a derivative of *trullan.|$|E

He {{was a member of}} the State College (Statskollegiet, a governing body overseeing the workings of the government) and the large legal committee, after which he was named governor-general of Norway as Niels <b>Trolle's</b> successor. The population complained about him, as they had complained about his predecessor; more significantly, however, he had enemies in Copenhagen. It was expected that he would leave the position in the summer of 1663, but he remained in power until January 1664, when he was replaced by Ulrik Frederik Gyldenløve.|$|R
25|$|Someone {{had become}} rather {{more than a}} little {{concerned}} over the 160mph lap in 1985, for by the time the Grand Prix returned in Silverstone in 1987, a new corner was inserted before Woodcote which changed the character of the circuit. However, the first International meeting in 1987 was the initial round of the Intercontinental F3000 Championship on 12 April. The race was run at 103.96mph, the winner being Maurício Gugelmin in a Ralt from Michel <b>Trollé</b> in a Lola and Roberto Moreno aboard another Ralt.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after seizing {{power in}} 1523, Gustav Vasa {{addressed}} the Pope in Rome with {{a request for}} the confirmation of Johannes Magnus as new archbishop of Sweden, {{in the place of}} Gustav <b>Trolle</b> who had been formally deposed by the Riksdag of the Estates due to his involvement with the Danes. The pope initially refused, but gave his approval a year later. Magnus then was in a position between the reformation friendly king and the Catholic bishops. He was sent on a diplomatic mission to Russia in 1526 while the king continued the reformation. Magnus travelled down to Rome and was consecrated in 1533, but never returned home.|$|E
25|$|However, Gustav <b>Trolle</b> {{was deemed}} a traitor to the country, and Gustav Vasa could not {{reinstate}} him. Instead {{he ignored the}} papal bull and {{took it upon himself}} to install Magnus without papal acceptance. Before long, however, Johannes Magnus rebelled by declaring his discontent with the Lutheran teachings spread by the brothers Olaus and Laurentius Petri, under the supervision of King Gustav Vasa. The King then sent him off to Russia as a diplomat in 1526. Johannes Magnus was careful not to return home during that time, realizing that he was unwanted. Gustav Vasa appointed a new archbishop, Laurentius Petri, in 1531, and Johannes realized that his time as archbishop was over.|$|E

He distinguished himself at the battle of Mared the same year, and the King made him captain of the warship Byens Løve (56 guns). Byens Løve belonged to Herluf <b>Trolle's</b> fleet when it met the Swedes at the first battle of Öland in the spring of 1564. During {{the second day of the}} battle Byens Løve and the Lübeck ship Engel boarded the Swedish flagship Mars, and manage to take captive the Swedish admiral Jakob Bagge, his second-in-command, and about 100 Swedish sailors before the burning Mars exploded.|$|R
50|$|In 1686, {{the king}} granted {{the mayor and}} city council {{permission}} to sell the building {{to a member of}} the donators' family {{to raise money for the}} school. In 1598, it was sold to Peder Brahe, whose wife, Margrethe Gøye, was a niece of Birgitte Gøye. They expanded the house with the west wing on Sankt Anna Gade in 1592. The city acquired the Brahe House as it was then known in 1630 and turned it into its new poorhouse. In 1632, the old hospital building was expanded to the same height as <b>Trolle's</b> house. The poorhouse was later expanded with a half-timbered north and west wing, turning it into a four-winged complex with a central courtyard. In 1761, 71 people lived in the building and by 1845 the number had increased to 96. The south wing as from 1805 until 1841 used as a school for the poor with up to 120 pupils. The poorhouse was decommissioned in 1902. Helsingør City Museum took over the building in 1973. It had previously been based in Marienlyst Castle.|$|R
5000|$|The {{largest group}} of {{political}} murder cases in Stockholm is undeniably the Stockholm Bloodbath, which revolves around the looting and followed executions between 7 November och 9 November 1520. The events took place three days following the coronation of Christian II as King of Sweden. when the coronation party guests were called to a meeting at Tre Kronor Castle. Archbishop Gustav <b>Trolles</b> demands of economic compensation for the demolishing of his castle led to the question if the previous regent Sten Sture the Younger and his followers should be found guilty of heresy or not. Supported by canon law, approximately 82 persons were executed during the following days. The executions were performed on Stortorget and commenced in the afternoon of 8 November with the beheadings of bishops Mattias och Vincent. 15 members of the nobility were thereafter also beheaded by sword, thereafter the mayor of Stockholm along with his advisors were killed by hanging. On 9 November, the servants belonging to the now executed parts of the nobility were also executed. Bonfires were lit on Södermalm {{in the same area}} where Katarina graveyard would be laid out on 10 November. The grave of Sten Sture the Younger in the Black Friars' Monastery was dug up and thrown in the bonfire on Pelarbacken. The events were immortalized in 1524 on Blodbadstavlan (literally [...] "The Bloodbath Painting") which also contains one of the oldest known depictions of the city of Stockholm.|$|R
25|$|Russians {{captured}} the turuma Sällan Värre which had run aground while defending the blockades and Enrique MacDonell's hemmema Oden which {{had come to}} its aid. The Swedish archipelago fleet withdrew into the safety of fortress at Svartholm {{when it became clear}} that Russians had beaten the blockade. Several other ships were lost during the withdrawal. The turuma Björn Järnsida, which had been Ehrensvärd's flagship at the start of the battle, ran aground and struck its colors after bravely fighting nearly to the last man. The frigate af <b>Trolle,</b> turuma Ragvald, and a gun sloop were also captured. Swedish auxiliaries and transport vessels trapped north of island of Kotka were burned to prevent their capture.|$|E
25|$|The king let the Pope {{know the}} impossibility of the request, and the {{possible}} results if the Pope persisted, but – {{for better or worse}} – the Pope did persist, and refused to accept the king's suggestions of archbishops. At the time, incidentally and for different reasons, there were also four other unoccupied bishop's seats, where the king made suggestions to the Pope about candidates, but the Pope only accepted one of the candidates. Because the Pope refused to budge on the issue of Gustav <b>Trolle,</b> the king, influenced by Lutheran scholar Olaus Petri, in 1531 took it upon himself to appoint yet another archbishop, namely the brother of Olaus, Laurentius Petri. With this royal act, the Pope lost any influence over the Swedish Church.|$|E

This has been taken by some scholars to imply that he made military campaigns into Southern Mesopotamia to relieve his fellow Mesopotamians from Amorite and Elamite invasions. However, the historian M. <b>Trolle</b> Larsen has suggested that this represented an attempt to lure traders from the south of Assur with tax privileges and exemptions, to monopolize the exchange of copper from the gulf for tin from the east. The cities cited therefore are the three major caravan routes the commodities would have traveled rather than campaign routes for the king. His construction activities included building the old temple of Ishtar, a city wall, subdivision of the city into house plots and diversion of the flow of two springs to the city gates, “Aushum” and “Wertum”.|$|E
2500|$|Stortorget was {{the scene}} of the Stockholm Bloodbath in November 1520, when, during three days, the Danish-Swedish king Christian II {{beheaded}} and hanged 90 people. [...] This deed was accomplished notwithstanding the reprieve proclaimed by Queen Christina Gyllenstierna following four months of Danish siege. Nevertheless, the Danish king wasn't directly responsible for the deed. [...] The archbishop Gustav <b>Trolle,</b> dethroned and imprisoned by the regent Sten Sture the Elder who died during the siege, wanted to obtain a redress. [...] So, during the coronation of the Danish king, the prominent guests were confronted with the bill of indictment of the archbishop and subsequently condemned for blasphemy. [...] The death sentences were to be accomplished at once, so the square was cleared while a curfew forced all citizens to stay indoors. [...] The executioners beheaded archbishops, councillors, noblemen, and city magistrates indiscriminately, including Erik Johansson Vasa, father of the succeeding king Gustav Vasa who escaped the fate of his father by hiding. [...] All bodies were burned on Södermalm together with the body of the dead regent Sten Sture. The Danish king, satisfied with having pacified Sweden, returned to Denmark in December, drowning a few monks during the trip, while ignoring the dawning insurrection in Dalarna.|$|E
