5|$|In Africa, certain arrow poisons {{are made}} using floral ingredients, such as of that {{taken from the}} plant Acokanthera. <b>This</b> <b>plant</b> {{contains}} ouabain, which is a cardiac glycoside, oleander, and milkweeds.|$|E
5|$|Banksia 'Pygmy Possum' – {{originally}} propagated by Austraflora Nursery, {{this is a}} prostrate form {{originally from}} the Green Cape area on the New South Wales far south coast. Similar plants are seen in nurseries called simply B.serrata (Prostrate) collected from the same area. <b>This</b> <b>plant</b> is suitable for rockeries and small gardens.|$|E
50|$|Much of <b>this</b> <b>plant's</b> {{range is}} within Bandelier National Monument.|$|R
50|$|<b>This</b> <b>plant's</b> common {{habitat type}} is wet forest up to 500 meters in elevation.|$|R

5|$|Canada golden-rod (Solidago canadensis) {{appeared}} in 2003 {{as a result}} of plant deposits. The threat proved to be serious the following year. Some stations show a significant concentration of the species, while isolated plants grow everywhere on the site. <b>This</b> <b>plant</b> is easily pulled by hand before flowering to prevent seed dispersal, and the shoots are burned.|$|E
5|$|In addition, {{like all}} Nepenthes, <b>this</b> <b>plant</b> needs a fairly humid {{environment}} to grow well. Values {{in the region}} of 75% R.H. are generally considered optimal, with increased humidity at night (~90% R.H.). However, N. rajah does tolerate fluctuations in humidity, especially when young, provided that the air does not become too dry (below 50% R.H.). Humidity can be easily controlled using an ultrasonic humidifier in conjunction with a humidistat.|$|E
5|$|Lady Wilkinson (1858), who {{provides}} an extensive {{discussion of the}} etymology of the various names for <b>this</b> <b>plant,</b> suggests a very different origin, namely the Old English word affodyle (that which cometh early), citing a 14th-century (but likely originally much earlier) manuscript {{in support of this}} theory, and which appears to describe a plant resembling the daffodil. Ellacombe provides further support for this from a fifteenth century English translation of Palladius that also refers to it.|$|E
50|$|The larvae only feed on Ricinus communis, {{which is}} curious because <b>this</b> <b>plants</b> {{produces}} the natural insecticide ricin.|$|R
50|$|<b>This</b> <b>plant's</b> {{habitat is}} {{affected}} by road construction, limestone quarrying, and recreational activity such as off-road vehicle use.|$|R
50|$|Further east - in the Eastern Cape and Kwazulu-Natal - <b>this</b> <b>plant's</b> close {{relative}} Knowltonia capensis is rather more common.|$|R
5|$|The Pine Bush {{is home to}} bog {{bluegrass}} (Poa paludigena), {{a federal}} species of concern, {{as well as the}} rare red-rooted flatsedge (Cyperus erythrorhizos), Houghton's umbrella-sedge (Cyperus houghtonii), and Schweinitz's flatsedge (Cyperus schweinitzii). Bog bluegrass occurs {{at the bottom of a}} ravine in the Pine Bush and is the only place in the New York Bight watershed where <b>this</b> <b>plant</b> appears. Bayard's malaxis (Malaxis bayardii) is a rare orchid that occurs in the Pine Bush as well.|$|E
5|$|The {{electrolytic}} finishing {{plant was}} established at Morgantown because that plant {{was under the}} control of DuPont's Ammonia Division. At <b>this</b> <b>plant</b> the output from the distillation plants, which was about 90% heavy water, was broken down by electrolysis into hydrogen and oxygen. The light hydrogen tends to be drawn off first, leaving the heavy water behind. This process was repeated through several stages to yield a finished product that was 99.75% heavy water.|$|E
5|$|<b>This</b> <b>plant</b> was {{introduced}} to North America simultaneously by the French colonists in Canada and the British in the Thirteen Colonies {{for use as a}} root vegetable, but in the mid-19th century, it was replaced as the main source of starch by the potato and consequently was less widely cultivated.|$|E
50|$|Between 1927 and 1935 <b>this</b> <b>plant's</b> {{transmission}} antenna was a t-antenna, which was spun between two 75 meter high freestanding steel framework towers.|$|R
50|$|Joseph Pitton de Tournefort {{mentions}} that blades covered in <b>this</b> <b>plant's</b> juices {{were believed to}} cut through stone as easily as through wood.|$|R
50|$|The {{significant}} secondary metabolites of kava are kavalactones and flavokawains. Pipermethystine {{is suspected}} {{to be the}} main hepatotoxic compound in <b>this</b> <b>plant's</b> stems and leaves.|$|R
5|$|Aloe vera {{has been}} widely grown as an {{ornamental}} plant. The species is popular with modern gardeners as a putatively medicinal plant and for its interesting flowers, form, and succulence. This succulence enables the species to survive in areas of low natural rainfall, making it ideal for rockeries and other low water-use gardens. The species is hardy in zones 8–11, and is intolerant of heavy frost and snow. The species is relatively resistant to most insect pests, though spider mites, mealy bugs, scale insects, and aphid species may cause a decline in plant health. <b>This</b> <b>plant</b> has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.|$|E
5|$|B.spinulosa var.spinulosa: The {{nominate}} race is an autonym, a {{name that}} was automatically created for the original material of the species as the other subspecies were described. The original hairpin banksia, <b>this</b> <b>plant</b> is coastal in Queensland, seen in such places as Walshs Pyramid (near Cairns), Byfield National Park and the Blackdown Tableland, then again in New South Wales south of the Hawkesbury River, just north of Sydney, down the New South Wales South Coast and into Victoria. Northwards of the Hawkesbury River on Sydney's northern outskirts there is a gradation between this and B.spinulosa var.collina. It commonly has black, maroon or claret styles on gold spikes but all-gold inflorescences are seen, and leaves are generally narrower than other varieties at 1–2mm in width and have several serrations toward the apex only.|$|E
5|$|Bogbean and Water Lobelia {{are common}} plants of moorland pools and lochans. The Least (Nuphar pumila), Yellow and White Water-lilies are also widespread. Pipewort has {{generated}} some botanical controversy regarding its discovery, classification and distribution. It was found growing on Skye in the 18th century, {{although there was}} subsequent confusion as to both the discoverer and the correct scientific name – now agreed to be Eriocaulon aquaticum. The European range of <b>this</b> <b>plant</b> is confined to Scotland and western Ireland {{and it is one}} of {{only a small number of}} species which is common in North America, but very restricted in Europe.|$|E
50|$|<b>This</b> <b>plants</b> roots possess root nodules, which harbor a {{symbiotic}} species of actinomycotal fungus, which fixes nitrogen {{at a faster}} rate than do the legumes.|$|R
50|$|The {{species was}} {{formally}} described in 1981 in the Journal of South African Botany. Prior to <b>this,</b> <b>plants</b> in cultivation had been erroneously identified as Coleonema pulchrum.|$|R
50|$|Some Californians, {{on hearing}} the name, {{believe that the}} name was {{inspired}} by Zzyzx Road. In fact, the story of <b>this</b> <b>plant's</b> unusual name is much more practical than that.|$|R
5|$|Erythranthe species tend to {{concentrate}} sodium chloride and other salts absorbed from the soils {{in which they}} grow in their leaves and stem tissues. Native Americans and early travelers in the American West used <b>this</b> <b>plant</b> as a salt substitute to season wild game. The entire plant is edible, but reported to be very salty and bitter unless well cooked. The juice from the leaves {{was used as a}} poultice for mild skin irritations and burns. Leaves can be used in salads and soups; flowers taste best before blooming. E. lutea has been used for cooking in Peru.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} {{boundary}} event was severe, there was significant {{variability in the}} rate of extinction between and within different clades. Species that depended on photosynthesis declined or became extinct as atmospheric particles blocked sunlight and reduced the solar energy reaching the surface of the Earth. <b>This</b> <b>plant</b> extinction caused a major reshuffling of the dominant plant groups. Omnivores, insectivores, and carrion-eaters survived the extinction event, perhaps because of the increased availability of their food sources. No purely herbivorous or carnivorous mammals seem to have survived. Rather, the surviving mammals and birds fed on insects, worms, and snails, which in turn fed on dead plant and animal matter. Scientists hypothesize that these organisms survived the collapse of plant-based food chains because they fed on detritus (non-living organic material).|$|E
5|$|From {{the mid-1970s}} {{sewerage}} was processed at a plant near the town, which also handles sewerage from nearby Hadspen. Treated waste-water from there is discharged into {{a tributary of}} the Liffey River. As of 2003 the reticulated water supply in the town was untreated and both were operated by the Meander Valley council. By 2011 Carrick's water was supplied from the Mount Leslie Water Treatment Plant. <b>This</b> <b>plant</b> was built in 1996 and supplies treated water from the Trevallyn Dam.|$|E
50|$|One {{threat to}} <b>this</b> rare <b>plant</b> is the {{mountain}} goat, {{which is an}} introduced species in the area. Climate change {{is also expected to}} have negative effects on <b>this</b> high-elevation <b>plant.</b>|$|R
50|$|Each {{house was}} to have two trees—there would be 20 species of disease- and drought-resistant trees, one species to each block. <b>This</b> <b>planting</b> plan was {{expected}} eventually to provide a continuous canopy of shade.|$|R
50|$|<b>This</b> <b>plant's</b> thick short-stemmed {{dark green}} leaves {{are some of}} the {{smallest}} and most compact in the Anubias species, growing only to 3.2 inches (8 cm) for a total height of 4.7 inches (12 cm).|$|R
5|$|In 1925, NESCo set up {{separate}} {{plant at}} the power station for the low temperature carbonisation treatment of coal, before being burned in boilers and the steam used for electricity generation. The treatment plant was manufactured by Babcock & Wilcox, and {{set up in a}} self-contained boiler house which contained four boilers, four retorts and pulverising mills. The building was also fitted with gas-stripping and by-product plants. The carbonising plant could handle up to 100 tonnes of coal per day, while its boilers produced 78,000lb of steam per hour. <b>This</b> <b>plant</b> was extended in 1931.|$|E
5|$|Persoonia lanceolata {{is rarely}} seen in cultivation, mainly due to {{difficulties}} in propagation; seed germination is unpredictable, and cuttings have proven difficult to strike. Nevertheless, its bright green hue {{is considered an}} attractive horticultural feature. Well drained sandy soils in sun or part shade are needed for <b>this</b> <b>plant</b> in a garden setting. Once established, it tolerates moderate frosts and dry spells, and grows fairly readily in suitable conditions. Plantsmen in England were able to germinate seed there in 1791.|$|E
5|$|Scarborough's {{drinking}} water is {{supplied by the}} R.C. Harris Filtration Plant {{at the foot of}} Victoria Park Avenue and the F.J. Horgan Filtration Plant. The F.J Horgan Filtration Plant was built in 1979 and was formerly known as the 'Easterly Plant'. Upgrades completed in 2011 allows it to process up to 800 Megalitres/day and it will also be the first plant to replace chlorine with ozone as its primary cleansing method. Wastewater for Scarborough is treated at the Highland Creek Water Pollution Control Plant. <b>This</b> <b>plant</b> was constructed in 1954 and started processing in 1956. It has undergone continual expansion to meet ongoing demand. Electricity is mainly provided in Scarborough by Toronto Hydro.|$|E
50|$|<b>This</b> <b>plant's</b> long-stemmed {{dark green}} leave blades are 5-9 {{times as long}} as wide (up to 3.5 cm) and 8-15 cm long. The {{petioles}} are 4-33 cm long, from 0.5-1 times {{as long as the}} blade.|$|R
50|$|Of all the aloes, {{this species}} is the slowest growing. In spite of <b>this,</b> <b>plants</b> {{have been found}} in the wild with heights of over 2 meters. Such {{individuals}} are believed to be several hundred years old.|$|R
50|$|The {{species was}} first {{formally}} described by Joy Thompson in Telopea in 1989 based on specimens collected on Mackays Peak in the Serra Range. Previous to <b>this,</b> <b>plants</b> of <b>this</b> species {{had been identified}} as Leptospermum nitidum.|$|R
