5|$|Cicadas, {{unlike other}} Auchenorrhyncha, are not adapted for jumping (saltation). They have the usual insect modes of locomotion, walking and flight. However, {{they do not}} walk or run well, and take to the wing to travel {{distances}} greater than a few centimetres. Cicadas can extend their hindlegs in under a millisecond <b>to</b> <b>execute</b> <b>a</b> jump, implying elastic storage of energy for sudden release.|$|E

The missile struck the port-side wing, rupturing a fuel tank and causing the loss of all three {{hydraulic}} systems. With the flight controls disabled, the crew used differential thrust <b>to</b> <b>execute</b> <b>a</b> safe landing at Baghdad.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{emerged from}} the African coast late on July 10. The wave entered the Bahamas on July 21 and organized into Tropical Depression Six while 70miles (110km) east of Eleuthera. Initially the storm was predicted <b>to</b> <b>execute</b> <b>a</b> clockwise loop and drift to the west {{in response to a}} high pressure system. Several models indicated the possibility of the storm to drift westward into central Florida. Soon after the depression formed, it strengthened into Tropical Storm Franklin.|$|E
5|$|As soon as Fremantle Prison {{came under}} local control in 1886, a {{refractory}} block with gallows was planned. It {{was completed in}} 1888, and first used in 1889 <b>to</b> <b>execute</b> <b>a</b> convicted murderer, Jimmy Long, a Malayan. The gallows room was the only lawful place of execution in Western Australia between 1888 and 1984. At least 43 men and one woman were hanged in this period. Martha Rendell {{was the only woman}} to be hanged at the prison, in 1909. The last person to be hanged was serial killer Eric Edgar Cooke, executed in 1964.|$|E
5|$|At first, the {{depression}} slowly tracked westward {{because it was}} blocked by a ridge of high pressure to the north. The system was under frequent reconnaissance surveillance, and {{the depression}} remained poorly organized and continued to be at tropical depression status well into 29 July. The organization of the system hindered further development despite favorable conditions with low wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures. Late on July 29, the system began <b>to</b> <b>execute</b> <b>a</b> turn to the northwest {{with an increase in}} forward speed. It still remained a poorly organized tropical depression south of Louisiana.|$|E

5|$|Between every down, {{the player}} selects a formation, play and, on defense, {{coverage}} shell from a menu. The game contains fifty-five offensive plays and seventy-one defensive plays, such as screen and play-action passes, blitzes and man-to-man defense. During a down, the player may control one team member {{at a time}} or allow the entire team <b>to</b> <b>execute</b> <b>a</b> play automatically. On offense, depending on the play, the player controls the quarterback, running back or kicker. After a pass, control automatically changes to the ball receiver. On defense, the player may at any time switch control between any members of the team. Instant replay is available to review plays.|$|E
5|$|Candice Michelle {{used her}} rematch clause for the Women's Championship on the October 22 edition of Raw in a {{two out of}} three falls match against Beth Phoenix. After Phoenix won the first pinfall, Candice failed <b>to</b> <b>execute</b> <b>a</b> move {{correctly}} from the top rope, causing her to fall on her neck, shoulder and face. As a result, Candice suffered a legitimate cracked clavicle, and Phoenix retained the title.|$|E
5|$|Finland {{was divided}} into two {{operational}} zones. Northern Finland was the staging area for Army Norway. Its goal was <b>to</b> <b>execute</b> <b>a</b> two-pronged pincer movement on the strategic port of Murmansk, named Operation Silver Fox. Southern Finland was still under {{the responsibility of the}} Finnish Army. The goal of the Finnish forces was, at first, to recapture Finnish Karelia at Lake Ladoga as well as the Karelian Isthmus, which included Finland's second largest city Vyborg.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} main match, Goldberg faced Chris Jericho. In {{the early stages}} of the match, Jericho and Goldberg fought at ringside. During this tussle, Goldberg {{attempted}} <b>to</b> <b>execute</b> <b>a</b> spear on Jericho, who was positioned on the security barricade; Jericho, however, avoided the attack as Goldberg broke through the security barricade. Goldberg was billed as being injured, prompting Jericho to apply several submission holds on Goldberg's injured shoulder. After remaining in control for the duration of the match, Goldberg was able to counter Jericho's Wall's of Jericho and execute the Jackhammer on him. Goldberg then covered Jericho for the pinfall.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} {{televised}} match of the event, Bret Hart fought Razor Ramon. Hart got the early advantage, but Ramon used his size advantage to control {{much of the}} match. He performed a fallaway slam and a running powerslam {{but was unable to}} pin Hart. Hart performed several of his signature moves, including a Russian legsweep and an elbow drop from the second rope. Ramon regained control of the match and attempted <b>to</b> <b>execute</b> <b>a</b> suplex from the top rope. Hart landed on top of Ramon, however, and pinned him to win the match.|$|E
5|$|Sestero recalls in {{his book}} The Disaster Artist that Wiseau {{intended}} for the film to contain a subplot in which Johnny was revealed to be a vampire, due to Wiseau's own fascination with the creatures. Sestero recounts how, {{at the outset of}} production, Wiseau tasked members of the crew with figuring out a way <b>to</b> <b>execute</b> <b>a</b> sequence in which Johnny's Mercedes-Benz would lift off from the roof of the townhouse and fly across the San Francisco skyline, revealing Johnny's vampiric nature. However, this scene did not end up being created for the film.|$|E

5|$|The B-52 aircraft, callsign Czar 52, {{took off}} at 13:58 and {{completed}} {{most of the}} mission's elements without incident. Upon preparing to execute the touch-and-go on Runway 23 {{at the end of}} the practice profile, the aircraft was instructed to go around because a KC-135 aircraft had just landed and was on the runway. Maintaining an altitude of about 250 feet (75m) above ground level (AGL), Holland radioed the control tower and asked for permission <b>to</b> <b>execute</b> <b>a</b> 360° left turn, which was immediately granted by the tower controller.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} Eddie Guerrero versus Rey Mysterio in a {{standard}} match. In the match, Mysterio tried to counter Guerrero's offense, but Guerrero blocked all of Mysterio's attempts. Mysterio gained the advantage when he was able <b>to</b> <b>execute</b> <b>a</b> flying headbutt to Guerrero. Chavo ran down to the ring to distract the referee, as Eddie grabbed a chair. Guerrero then attempted to hit Mysterio with the chair, but Mysterio dodged it with a low dropkick and performed another low dropkick, setting up Guerrero on the ropes for a 619. Mysterio won the match after Guerrero was disqualified for hitting him with a steel chair.|$|E
5|$|The {{propellers}} of a DC-6 {{are designed}} to provide reverse thrust after the aircraft touches down. The pilot then retards the throttle levers to a point below idle speed and that directs the electric mechanisms in the propeller hub to rotate the blades to a position in which they will provide reverse thrust. Should the pilot need to perform a go-around, he moves the thrust levers forward to a positive position again and that will produce forward thrust, enabling the pilot <b>to</b> <b>execute</b> <b>a</b> go-around maneuver.|$|E

5|$|This {{major change}} from a Classical design to a far more complex revival style, little known in Russia, meant Vorontsov had to find an {{alternative}} architect <b>to</b> <b>execute</b> <b>a</b> new design. This was further complicated by Vorontsov's desire to not only have a loose Jacobean style, but also to incorporate motifs from Islamic architecture so as to highlight the oriental strain evident in the Khan's Palace, Enikale Fort, and other local Tatar architecture. The resulting design was to highlight the Crimea's position {{as a place where}} the East and West meet. It was a radical departure from the Neoclassical strain that dominated the Russian architecture of the period.|$|E
5|$|After {{learning}} {{they are}} short of money, {{a group of}} four robbers decide <b>to</b> <b>execute</b> <b>a</b> bank heist. The four create a plan and hire an unwitting chauffeur to drive them to their location. As soon as they reach an isolated road, the robbers force the chauffeur out of the car, gag him, and throw him into a ditch. The robbers then drive {{the car to the}} bank. After entering, they kill a security guard and use explosives to force the bank vault open. The thieves steal as much money as possible and make a quick retreat to their car. Back in the park, a young couple on a walk discover the unconscious body of the chauffeur, and the man calls the police.|$|E
5|$|Despite being named, Rafael {{remained}} disorganized initially; {{this was}} the result of the interaction between an upper-level trough and the cyclone itself. Moderate to strong wind shear dislocated the center of Rafael and the deepest shower and thunderstorm activity. Over the course of the next few days, however, the upper-level trough gradually weakened and backed westward, allowing for the development of an anticyclone atop the tropical storm. Wind shear lessened, allowing the center to become obscured from view and outflow to develop in association with the system. As it began <b>to</b> <b>execute</b> <b>a</b> turn towards the north under the influence of an upper-level trough to its west, a central dense overcast was noted on satellite imagery. Following a series of intensity estimates, Rafael was upgraded to a hurricane around 0600UTC on October15, while positioned about 650mi (1045km) south of Bermuda, although this intensity was speculated upon until later that afternoon following a hurricane hunters flight into the system.|$|E
