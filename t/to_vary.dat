5|$|Titanium may be {{anodized}} <b>to</b> <b>vary</b> {{the thickness}} of the surface oxide layer, causing optical interference fringes and a variety of bright colors. With this coloration and chemical inertness, titanium is a popular metal for body piercing.|$|E
5|$|Although space vector {{pulse-width}} modulation (SVPWM) {{is becoming}} increasingly popular, sinusoidal PWM (SPWM) is the most straightforward method used <b>to</b> <b>vary</b> drives' motor voltage (or current) and frequency. With SPWM control (see Fig. 1), quasi-sinusoidal, variable-pulse-width output is constructed from intersections of a saw-toothed carrier signal with a modulating sinusoidal signal which is variable in operating frequency {{as well as in}} voltage (or current).|$|E

5|$|Another {{issue is}} the role of {{inherited}} genetic factors in shaping attachments: for example one type of polymorphism of the gene coding for the D2 dopamine receptor has been linked to anxious attachment and another in the gene for the 5-HT2A serotonin receptor with avoidant attachment. This suggests that the influence of maternal care on attachment security is not the same for all children. One theoretical basis for this is that it makes biological sense for children <b>to</b> <b>vary</b> in their susceptibility to rearing influence.|$|E
5|$|Because {{strontium}} is {{so similar}} to calcium, it {{is incorporated in}} the bone. All four stable isotopes are incorporated, in roughly the same proportions they are found in nature. However, the actual distribution of the isotopes tends <b>to</b> <b>vary</b> greatly from one geographical location to another. Thus, analyzing the bone of an individual can help determine the region it came from. This approach helps to identify the ancient migration patterns and the origin of commingled human remains in battlefield burial sites.|$|E
5|$|Births occur year-round, with peaks between May and June in {{northern}} populations and between January and March in southern populations. Gestation appears <b>to</b> <b>vary</b> {{from four to}} twelve months, as the species is capable of delayed implantation followed by four months of pregnancy. In California, sea otters usually breed every year, about twice as often as those in Alaska.|$|E

5|$|By {{allowing}} u <b>to</b> <b>vary</b> {{over all}} possible integers, an infinite family of solutions {{can be generated}} from a single solution (x1,y1). If the solutions are required to be positive integers (x>0,y>0), only {{a finite number of}} solutions may be possible. This restriction on the acceptable solutions allows some systems of Diophantine equations with more unknowns than equations to have a finite number of solutions; this is impossible for a system of linear equations when the solutions can be any real number (see Underdetermined system).|$|E
5|$|Changes in Earth's {{magnetic}} field on a time scale {{of a year}} or more are referred to as secular variation.

5|$|Data {{obtained}} from the composition of soil samples collected on Apollo 15 show that most (about 90%) of the samples from the Apennine Front are brown-glass breccias, and approximately 60–70% {{obtained from}} the mare surface are basalt. Although the basalts seem <b>to</b> <b>vary</b> in their texture, their ages appear to be approximately the same. Most of the samples obtained on the Apennine Front are KREEP (potassium, rare-earth elements, phosphorus) materials, anorthosites, recrystallized norite, or recrystallized breccia.|$|E

The ratio of deuterium to normal hydrogen was found <b>to</b> <b>vary</b> from compound to compound, which astronomers believe suggests that cometary ices were formed in interstellar clouds, {{rather than in the}} solar nebula. Theoretical modelling of ice formation in interstellar clouds suggests that comet Hale–Bopp formed at temperatures of around 25–45kelvins.|$|E
5|$|In a tour {{match against}} the Englishmen, Woodfull made 275 not out for Victoria, his highest score for his state. During the match, Woodfull was captain and had agreed with English captain Chapman <b>to</b> <b>vary</b> rules {{that had been}} laid by the Australian Board of Control. The two men agreed to cover the pitch {{throughout}} the match and to bowl overs of six balls instead of eight. The Australian Board of Control reacted by reprimanding the Victorian Cricket Association. The match was a high-scoring draw.|$|E
5|$|Mach-Zehnder interferometers {{are being}} used in {{integrated}} optical circuits, in which light interferes between two branches of a waveguide that are externally modulated <b>to</b> <b>vary</b> their relative phase.

Premiums are allowed <b>to</b> <b>vary</b> by enrollee age, but those for the oldest enrollees (age 45–64 average expenses $5,542) can only be three times as large as those for adults (18–24 $1,836).|$|E
5|$|Prognosis of {{spontaneous}} cervical arterial dissection involves neurological and arterial results. The overall functional prognosis {{of individuals with}} stroke due to cervical artery dissection does not appear <b>to</b> <b>vary</b> from that of young people with stroke due to other causes. The rate of survival with good outcome (a modified Rankin score of 0–2) is generally about 75%, or possibly slightly better (85.7%) if antiplatelet drugs are used.

5|$|Species {{recognition}} {{is based on}} combinations of minor structural variations in the shape, aperture, whorl contour, umbilical region, and color pattern. It {{appears to be the}} case that many species have a stable color pattern, while other species seem <b>to</b> <b>vary</b> tremendously. Adequate unselected field samples will enable {{a better understanding of the}} relative stability or variability of particular species in single localities.|$|E
5|$|Structural {{coloration}} {{could be}} exploited industrially and commercially, and research {{that could lead}} to such applications is under way. A direct parallel would be to create active or adaptive military camouflage fabrics that vary their colours and patterns to match their environments, just as chameleons and cephalopods do. The ability <b>to</b> <b>vary</b> reflectivity to different wavelengths of light could also lead to efficient optical switches that could function like transistors, enabling engineers to make fast optical computers and routers.|$|E
5|$|The {{arterial}} bubble assumption {{can introduce}} {{variability in the}} decompression outcome through the lung function. The first variable is individual susceptibility. The filtering capacity of the lung may be assumed <b>to</b> <b>vary</b> between individuals, and for a given individual, from day to day, and {{may account for the}} inter-personal and intra-persona variability which have been observed in DCS susceptibility. Basically, a good diver is a good bubble filter. This is a justification for divers who seek top physical fitness for severe decompression exposures.|$|E
