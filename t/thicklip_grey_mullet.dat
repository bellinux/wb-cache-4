The ‘visitors’ hosted eight pathogens from four taxonomic groups: Protozoa, Nematoda, Acanthocephala and Mollusca. Nematodes, the most numerous ones, were found in three host species. All the parasite species were new for the hosts examined; only the larvae of the acanthocephalan Corynosoma strumosum had already been recorded in one of the hosts (Chelidonichthys lucerna). The stomachs of almost all the fish examined were empty, but the species composition of the parasite fauna found showed that the fish must have ingested some food in the Pomeranian Bay...|$|E

However, no recent studies have been made regarding polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in wild C. labrosus. Due to that, the concentration of 13 PCBs congeners was measured in muscles and livers, of males and females, of C. labrosus of different ages, allowing the estimation of PCB bioaccumulation throughout the species lifespan, in the Mondego estuary, a southern European temperate estuary. Male muscle sample concentrations ranged from 32 to 96 ng g− 1 (lipid wt.) and in females from 32 to 62 ng g− 1 (lipid wt.). In male liver sample concentrations ranged from 106 to 158 ng g− 1 (lipid wt.), while female concentrations ranged from 88 to 129 ng g− 1 (lipid wt.). The most abundant congeners presenting higher percentages in all samples were CB 138, 153 and 180. No {{significant differences were found}} between the concentrations in both sexes, but muscle and liver PCB concentrations in males tended to increase with age whereas in females concentrations remained stable throughout the species lifespan.

Therefore, the purpose of study was to investigate the effects of low water temperature on the stress response of <b>grey</b> <b>mullets</b> Mugil cephalus acclimated in freshwater. The blood samples of experimental fish (TL: 28. 2 ± 1. 1 cm, BW: 198. 6 ± 25. 9 g) were collected during winter season when the water temperature of controlled rearing system was stable at 25 °C and uncontrolled rearing system slowly dropped until 12 °C. Their stress response on both rearing systems was observed. The results showed that low temperature affected to lower the behavior activity and increase the stress response of <b>grey</b> <b>mullets.</b> The breath frequency of <b>grey</b> <b>mullet</b> regarding their opercular movement at 12 °C was 74 - 97 breath/min., while at 25 °C it was 95 - 114 breath/min.

The tendencies of cortisol and glucose level increased with the lowering temperature, showing higher value of 264. 8 ng/mL and 35. 5 mg/dL in 12 °C than 5. 5 ng/mL and 32. 7 mg/dL in 25 °C.

However, the results showed lower values at 12 °C in every blood components, except for chloride.
