25|$|Arthur Berry... was a {{good teacher}} and focus for art {{activity}} at the Burslem & Stoke Art School. I do not agree that he is for many the finest 20th century artist from Stoke - there are other candidates also. Mr Berry's work lies somewhere between painting and drawing - for me paint and its properties hold most attraction. Mr Berry's talent was spread over several areas - drawing, painting, writing, plays, poems and teaching. I do not <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> good enough myself to do several things well, so concentrate on one (painting). Mr Berry said he admired Lowry and once encountered him in a Manchester Gallery - said he was built and made for a particular task - as an artist recording the vanishing industrial scene of Manchester....Mr Berry was, I feel, a humorist whose interest was {{the people of the}} old working class of Stoke - a type of person who no longer exists. I mostly liked his landscapes. They seemed to convey that strange Stoke light which appeals to me and the old buildings and streets which were very much part of my own childhood and youth.|$|E
500|$|When the Associated Press picked Petoskey {{as only a}} second-team All-American in 1933, ten-year-old Mary Lee Grossman from Saginaw, Michigan protested in {{a letter}} to AP sports editor, Alan Gould, that he had [...] "chosen wrong" [...] in leaving Petoskey and Whitey Wistert off the first-team. [...] To avoid any {{appearance}} of bias, the Saginaw native noted: [...] "You may <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> a friend of these boys but I do not know either of them. [...] I hope you change your mind." [...] Gould responded to Miss Grossman in his column: [...] "You may be right, Mary Lee, but it's too late now to change our mind." ...|$|E
500|$|Critic Alan di Perna praised Gilmour's guitar {{work as an}} {{integral}} element of Pink Floyd's sound. Rolling Stone ranked Gilmour number 14 in their [...] "100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time" [...] list and di Perna described him {{as the most important}} guitarist of the 1970s, calling him [...] "the missing link between Hendrix and Van Halen." [...] In 2006, Gilmour commented on his playing technique: [...] " [...] fingers make a distinctive sound... aren't very fast, but I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> instantly recognisable... The way I play melodies is connected to things like Hank Marvin and the Shadows". Gilmour's ability to use fewer notes than most to express himself without sacrificing strength or beauty drew a favourable comparison to jazz trumpeter Miles Davis.|$|E

500|$|Kajol {{studied at}} the St Joseph Convent {{boarding}} school in Panchgani. Apart from her studies, she participated in extra-curricular activities, such as dancing. It was in school that she began to form an active interest in reading fiction, as it helped her [...] "through the bad moments" [...] in her life. At the age of sixteen, she began work on Rahul Rawail's film Bekhudi, which according to her was a [...] "big dose of luck". She initially intended {{to return to school}} after shooting for the film during her summer vacations. However, she eventually dropped out of school to pursue a full-time career in film. On not completing her education, she quoted, [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> any less well-rounded because I didn't complete school".|$|E
500|$|On 24 December 1809, Cavendish married Granville {{with her}} aunt's blessing. Though ageing, Granville {{maintained}} his handsome appearance and Cavendish {{was said to}} have [...] " [...] high degree the charm of voice and manner which belongs to the Cavendish family". Their marriage was happy; she loved him until her death, writing in September 1810 to her sister, [...] "I really <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> happier every hour. There never was anything so adorable as he is in every way". Their eldest child, Susan, was born in October 1810 in London. The couple would go on to have four further children, and his two illegitimate issue with Henrietta also flourished in the happy household. Granville was made a Viscount in 1815; an earldom awarded in 1833 led to Harriet becoming known as Countess Granville.|$|E
500|$|During his year-long {{absence from}} the screen, Khan {{actively}} looked to play different parts, saying: [...] "These are smarter movies, the interaction with them is deeply rewarding...I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> finally beginning to understand my sense of style as an actor. I am developing my craft, understanding what acting and communication is." [...] He found the role in his second collaboration with director Vishal Bhardwaj, Rangoon (2017), an epic romance set during World War II. Cast alongside Shahid Kapoor and Kangana Ranaut, Khan drew inspirations from the mannerisms of his grandfather and the character Darth Vader to portray filmmaker Rustom [...] "Rusi" [...] Billimoria. Rajeev Masand termed the film [...] "overlong, indulgent {{to the point of}} exhaustion", but praised Khan for [...] "imbu Russi with the swagger and the arrogance of an aristocrat from the forties".|$|E

500|$|Nationally, the Whigs were irreparably split by the Kansas–Nebraska Act {{and other}} efforts to {{compromise}} on the slavery issue. Reflecting the demise of his party, Lincoln would write in 1855, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> a Whig, but others say there are no Whigs, and that I am an abolitionist [...] I {{do no more than}} oppose the extension of slavery." [...] Drawing on the antislavery portion of the Whig Party, and combining Free Soil, Liberty, and antislavery Democratic Party members, the new Republican Party formed as a northern party dedicated to antislavery. Lincoln resisted early attempts to recruit him to the new party, fearing that it would serve as a platform for extreme abolitionists. Lincoln also still hoped to rejuvenate the ailing Whig Party, though he bemoaned his party's growing closeness with the nativist Know Nothing movement.|$|E
500|$|Debate over Trescothick's {{place in}} the England squad {{continued}} amid an end-of-series reshuffle in the England batting lineup. This included the dropping of fellow opener Strauss from the one-day side, {{and the rise of}} Alastair Cook as a Test and ODI opener for England. Trescothick stated that he would see how he progresses before committing to the international scene: [...] "Of course I'd love to play for England again.... Clearly, if I want to continue my career I have to undertake another tour. But for now, if and when I get back to full fitness and I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> OK and ready to play, I'll make myself available for England." [...] He added that he was [...] "desperate to play for England again" [...] but was waiting until he was [...] "as convinced as I can be that I am ready to take on the challenge of international cricket".|$|E
500|$|Nina was {{initially}} {{meant to be}} a [...] "bad girl", but the writers rewrote the part for Goodrem, and the character became a [...] "painfully shy schoolgirl" [...] who gets a job in the Coffee Shop. The Age described Nina as the [...] "quintessential girl next door". Goodrem described her character as [...] "a quiet, unassuming type of girl", who did not think anything of her amazing gift. When Goodrem was asked if she was similar to Nina, she replied [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> in some ways and in some ways I'm not. Nina's very shy, I really like the character Nina but I think she'd probably walk out of a room and I'd probably chat all day I think that's probably the difference, she'd sneak out of a room and I'd stay!" [...] The BBC agreed with Goodrem and said that Nina would not say [...] "boo to a goose" [...] and would flee if anyone looked her way.|$|E

500|$|At first, Angelou {{intended}} {{to return to}} poetry and play-writing after completing Caged Bird and write no more autobiographies, but she chose the genre as her primary mode of expression because of its challenge and {{so that she could}} [...] "change it, to make it bigger, richer, finer, and more inclusive in the twentieth century". In a 1989 interview, she stated, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> the only serious writer who has chosen the autobiographical form to carry my work, my expression". [...] As she told journalist George Plimpton during a 1990 interview, [...] "Autobiography is awfully seductive; it’s wonderful". [...] She also told Plimpton that like the tradition begun by Frederick Douglass in slave narratives, she used the literary technique of [...] "speaking in the first-person singular talking about the first-person plural, always saying I meaning 'we'". [...] As critic Susan Gilbert states, Angelou was reporting not one person's story, but the collective's. [...] Scholar Selwyn R. Cudjoe agrees, and sees Angelou as representative of the convention in African-American autobiography as a public gesture that speaks for an entire group of people.|$|E
500|$|Batman subdues the Joker {{and tells}} him that Gordon survived the Joker's torments, and {{suggests}} that the Joker is alone in his madness. He attempts {{to reach out to}} the Joker and offers to help him recover in order to end their everlasting war, which Batman fears may one day result in a fight to the death. The Joker declines, saying it is too late..."far too late". He then says that this situation reminds him of a joke about two inmates in a lunatic asylum who try to escape. One inmate jumps across a narrow gap between the asylum and the adjoining building, but the other is afraid he will fall. The first inmate offers to shine his flashlight across the gap so the other can walk across it, but the second inmate replies, [...] "What do you <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> crazy? You'd turn it off when I was halfway across!" [...] Batman chuckles at the punch line, and the two old foes laugh as the police arrive.|$|E
500|$|Burnside did {{not perform}} an {{adequate}} reconnaissance of the area, {{and he did not}} take advantage of several easy fording sites out of range of the enemy; his troops were forced into repeated assaults across the narrow bridge which was dominated by Confederate sharpshooters on high ground. By noon, McClellan was losing patience. He sent a succession of couriers to motivate Burnside to move forward. He ordered one aide, [...] "Tell him if it costs 10,000 men he must go now." [...] He increased the pressure by sending his inspector general to confront Burnside, who reacted indignantly: [...] "McClellan appears to <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not trying my best to carry this bridge; you are the third or fourth one who has been to me this morning with similar orders." [...] The IX Corps eventually broke through, but the delay allowed Maj. Gen. A. P. Hill's Confederate division to come up from Harpers Ferry and repulse the Union breakthrough. McClellan refused Burnside's requests for reinforcements and the battle ended in a tactical stalemate.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Upgrade U" [...] was shot during the two-week filming for the B'Day Anthology Video Album. It was {{directed}} by Melina and Knowles herself. The video was shot between those of [...] "Kitty Kat" [...] and [...] "Green Light", and took about one and half days of filming. Jay-Z performed his rap scenes first, [...] afterwards Knowles studied his scene, and then did her impersonation of him. Melina said: [...] "If anybody knows Jay-Z, it would be Beyoncé". Knowles commented on her impersonation of Jay-Z on MTV, [...] "I love what I did in [...] because it's completely out of my character, {{or at least the}} character that people <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>am.</b> I was pretending to be Jay, and he was there, and I told him he had to leave, because I couldn't do it with him in the room — it was way too embarrassing. I think I did a pretty good job. I had the lip curl down!" [...] The video premiered on February 28, 2007, on BET's 106 & Park, with the video for Knowles' other single release, [...] "Beautiful Liar" [...] (2007) featuring Shakira, premiering the same day on Total Request Live (TRL).|$|E
500|$|... "You Are Not Alone" [...] is a R ballad {{about love}} and isolation. The song was written by R. Kelly and {{produced}} by Kelly and Jackson. Kelly wrote the song after losing close people in his life. Kelly was delighted {{to be able to}} work with his idol, explaining [...] "I was psyched... I feel I could have done his whole album. Not being selfish. I was just that geeked about it. It was an experience out of this world... It's amazing to know that five years ago I was writing songs in a basement in the ghetto and now I'm writing for Michael Jackson... I'd be a fool not to say it's a dream come true." [...] Jackson contacted Kelly to see if he had any material available. Kelly forwarded a tape recording of the song and Jackson then agreed to work with Kelly on the piece. On the tape sent to Jackson, Kelly sung [...] "You Are Not Alone" [...] mimicking Jackson's vocal style, explaining, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> him. I become him. I want him to feel that as well." [...] Jackson found the interpretation amusing. They spent the last week of November 1994 together in the studio working on the track.|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked about}} the theme of racism and if her books have changed how people think, Rowling said, [...] "I do not <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> pessimistic but I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{realistic}} about {{how much you can}} change deeply entrenched prejudice, so my feeling would be that if someone were a committed racist, possibly Harry Potter is not going to have an effect." ...|$|E
