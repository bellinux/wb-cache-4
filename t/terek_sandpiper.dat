50|$|The <b>Terek</b> <b>sandpiper</b> {{likes to}} {{associate}} with ruddy turnstones (Arenaria interpres), smallish calidrids, and Charadrius (but maybe not Pluvialis) plovers; a vagrant bird at Paraty (Rio de Janeiro state) was noted to pair up with a spotted sandpiper (Actitis macularius). Thus {{it may be that}} the <b>Terek</b> <b>sandpiper</b> under natural conditions may mate with common sandpiper (A. hypoleucos), the Old World sister species of spotted sandpiper (A. macularius). As hybridisation in shorebirds is extremely commonplace and Actitis is among the closer relatives of the <b>Terek</b> <b>sandpiper,</b> such pairings (should they indeed occur) may produce hybrid offspring.|$|E

5000|$|Because of its {{importance}} for shorebirds, Eighty Mile Beach {{is classified as}} an Important Bird Area (IBA) {{and is one of}} the principal shorebird study sites in north-western Australia. It regularly supports over 400,000 shorebirds, including over 1% of the global populations of bar-tailed godwits, eastern curlews, great knots, red knots, red-necked stints, grey-tailed tattlers, <b>Terek</b> <b>sandpipers,</b> pied oystercatchers, greater sand plovers, Oriental plovers, red-capped plovers and Oriental pratincoles, with irregular high counts of other species. [...] Since 1981 almost yearly expeditions by the Australasian Wader Studies Group have been banding and counting shorebirds there as part of a long-term program of monitoring the populations using the East Asian - Australasian Flyway. Since 1992 most birds caught have also been leg-flagged in order to discover their precise migration routes and staging sites.|$|R
50|$|Among the Scolopacidae, Xenus {{is part of}} the shank-tattler-phalarope clade {{and less}} closely related to the calidrid sandpipers. Based on the degree of DNA {{sequence}} divergence and putative shank and phalarope fossils from around the Oligocene/Miocene boundary some 23-22 million years ago, the <b>Terek</b> <b>sandpiper</b> presumably diverged from their relatives in the Late Oligocene.

40|$|Key {{sites for}} the {{conservation}} of waterbirds (Aves) in Durban Bay, South Africa. Durban Museum Novitates 30 : 1 - 14. Forty-eight monthly counts of waterbirds were conducted in Durban Bay (July 1999 -June 2003). A total of 47 227 waterbirds of 79 species were recorded. Eighteen waterbird species were significantly more abundant in summer while seven were significantly more abundant in winter. Centre Bank supported 40. 6 % of all waterbirds, comprising mainly Palearctic waders and roosting gulls and terns. Distinct species assemblages of plovers (Charadridae) and sandpipers (Scolopacidae) were associated with the two most selected of the intertidal sites: Bayhead and Centre Bank. The assemblage at Centre Bank included three large-bodied Palearctic species (Greenshank, Grey Plover and Whimbrel), all of which occurred in abundance there and showed strong selection for this site. The assemblage which showed strong site selection for Bayhead consisted of both resident and Palearctic species, five of which are known to favour finer sediments (Ringed and Kittlitz's plovers, Common and <b>Terek</b> <b>sandpipers,</b> and Little Stint). Bayhead had a higher number of waterbird species that occurred at higher densities, when compared with Centre Bank, and showed the highest species-diversity ranking of all sites. This may be a result of the more heterogenous nature of this area. Sporting Bodies- Pelican Island had high densities of, and strong site selection by, piscivorous species and species associated with the semi-natural shorelines of this area. This site, however, supported only 8. 6 % of all waterbirds counted during the study period. Fish Wharf-Yacht Basin had the highest numbers and densities of Greyheaded Gulls, which utilized this area when scavenging. Other waterbird species were poorly represented here and this site had the lowest species-diversity ranking. Commercial harbour areas were the least attractive for waterbirds in terms of species-abundance values, densities and site selection. This is largely attributed to the artificial nature of these areas. It is recommended that Centre Bank receive highest priority for conservation status within the Bay. Reasons for conserving this site include: (a) the high overall abundance of waterbirds that this site supports; (b) the unique assemblage of Palearctic waders that utilizes this area, and the overall contribution that this has to waterbird diversity in the Bay; and (c) the importance of this site to roosting gulls and terns, particularly Kelp Gull which has regionally, and potentially globally, significant numbers in this area...|$|R
50|$|Many Palearctic {{migrants}} {{winter in}} the lagoon during the austral summer, particularly in September as species arrive from the northern hemisphere, and in March when they gather in large numbers to feed up prior to undertaking the return migration. At these times the birds will be transitioning out of and into their breeding plumage. The birds are pushed towards the hides as the water level rises with the tide and eventually they must fly off until the tide has receded once more. Red knot, sanderling, little stint, Ruff, marsh, <b>Terek</b> and Curlew <b>sandpipers,</b> ruddy turnstone, ringed and grey plover, greenshank, Eurasian whimbrel, Eurasian curlew and bar-tailed godwit are the most regular species. Little egret and South African shelduck are resident and can often be seen with the waders, while greater flamingoes and great white pelican occur in deeper water. An isolated hide west of the Geelbek educational centre overlooks a salt pan where {{it is possible to}} observe the rare chestnut-banded plover. The lagoon's importance for migratory birds means that it is a site which is subject to the Ramsar Convention for the conservation and sustainable use of wetlands.|$|R

The most common bird species in the Rauchua / Kyttyk wetland are the yellow-billed, black-throated and Pacific divers. One of the main reasons for the importance of the Rauchua / Kyttyk is the breeding population (figures as of 1994) of Bewick's swan (approximately 300 birds), the Pacific eider (approximately 3,000 birds) and the spectacled eider (approximately 2,000 birds). Spectacled and Pacific eider as well as black-throated and Pacific divers are also found in the Ust-Chaun region, though the Pacific eider is much more common on the Kyttyl Peninsula and near Apapelgino.|$|E

40|$|Migratory {{activity}} of waders departing from north-western Australia in March-April 1991 was recorded by field observations and radar tracking. Field observations {{showed that the}} species concerned were mainly Bar-tailed Godwit Limosa lapponica, Grey Plover Pluvialis squatarola and Great Knot Calidris tenuirostris. Peak migration {{took place in the}} second week of April. Most flocks departed in the late afternoon, never at high tide. A strong correlation was found between the tidal cycle and the timing of departures. The majority of the flocks flew towards NNW. Given that the next stopover site of especially the larger sized waders is in east and south China (Barter & Wang 1990) this observed departure direction is more westerly than a course along the great circle route (0 -degree). Wind patterns along two possible northward routes (a great circle and an island hopping route along the island-arc of South-east Asia) are analysed. In view of recoveries of waders ringed in Australia, especially the smaller waders (Mongolian Plover Charadrius mongolus, Large Sandplover Charadrius leschenaultii, Red-necked Stint Calidris ruficollis, Curlew Sandpiper Calidris ferruginea, Broad-billed Sandpiper Limicola falcinellus, <b>Terek</b> <b>Sandpiper</b> Xenus cinereus) may migrate via the island hopping route, while the larger ones (Grey Plover, Great Knot, Red Knot Calidris canutus, Bar-tailed Godwit, Whimbrel Numenius phaeopus and Eastern Curlew Numenius madagascariensis) take a direct, great circle flight to China. Considerable tail wind assistance can be gained during the northward trip, more so along the island arc than along the great circle. Flight range estimates indicate that the smaller waders cannot fly the 4500 - 5500 km nonstop to east and south China, while the larger species can, on the condition that they experience tail wind assistance...|$|E
