5|$|Scholz saw the {{manuscript}} in 1845, and Paul de Lagarde in 1853, {{but they did}} not decipher it. The lower text of the codex was deciphered, transcribed, and edited by Tregelles in 1861. Tregelles used types originally cast for printing the Codex Alexandrinus, which only approximately represented the shape of <b>the</b> <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> codex. The hand-written letters are smaller than the type. Tregelles included one page of typographical facsimile in this edition. He did not decipher the small Patristic writing and doubted that it could be read without chemical restoration.|$|E

5|$|Amino acids {{are made}} into {{proteins}} by being joined {{together in a}} chain of peptide bonds. Each different protein has a unique sequence of amino acid residues: this is its primary structure. Just as <b>the</b> <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> alphabet can be combined to form an almost endless variety of words, amino acids can be linked in varying sequences to form a huge variety of proteins. Proteins are made from amino acids that have been activated by attachment to a transfer RNA molecule through an ester bond. This aminoacyl-tRNA precursor is produced in an ATP-dependent reaction carried out by an aminoacyl tRNA synthetase. This aminoacyl-tRNA is then a substrate for the ribosome, which joins the amino acid onto the elongating protein chain, using the sequence information in a messenger RNA.|$|E
5|$|Most {{people like}} themselves; {{the name is}} {{associated}} with the self, and hence <b>the</b> <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> name are preferred, {{despite the fact that they}} appear in many other words. People who do not like themselves tend not to exhibit the name-letter effect. A similar effect has been found for numbers related to birthdays: people tend to prefer the number signifying the day of the month on which they were born. Alternative explanations for the name-letter effect, such as frequent exposure and early mastery, have been ruled out. In psychological assessments, the Name Letter Preference Task is widely used to estimate implicit self-esteem.|$|E
5|$|The Letter Preference Task is the second-most popular {{method to}} measure {{implicit}} self-esteem, surpassed {{only by the}} Implicit Association Test. The task has also been called the Name Letter Preference Task, Name-Letter-Ratings Measure, and Initial Preference Task. There is no standard method for applying the task. The most commonly used one is a letter rating task, which involves having participants judge all <b>the</b> <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> alphabet. Even within this method there are variations in the instructions (how much you like the letters or how attractive you find them), in the rating scales (five-point, seven-point, or nine-point), {{in the order of}} the letters (random or alphabetical), and in data collection (paper-and-pencil or computer-based).|$|E
5000|$|In the Eastern Orthodox Church, akribeia (ἀκρίβεια), also {{sometimes}} akribia, akrivia is strict adherence to <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church, as distinguished from economy, which is discretionary deviation from <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law {{in order to}} adhere to <b>the</b> spirit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law.|$|R

5|$|The kvitel {{is either}} {{sent to the}} Rebbe by {{messenger}} or mail, or given personally by the Hasid during his private audience with the Rebbe. The kvitel is usually given together with a sum of money known as a pidyon (redemption), which {{is used by the}} Rebbe for the upkeep of his court or for distribution to charity. Some Rebbes requested from the Hasid a sum of money equal to twice the numerical value of the Hebrew word Chai (life), which equals 18. Others took an amount of money equal to the numerical value of <b>the</b> <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hebrew names of the Hasid or his wife.|$|E
5|$|When a {{tropical}} depression intensifies into {{a tropical}} storm {{to the north of}} the Equator between the coastline of the Americas and 140°W, it will be named by the NHC. There are six lists of names which rotate every six years and begin with the letters A—Z used, skipping Q and U, with each name alternating between a male or a female name. The names of significant tropical cyclones are retired from the lists, with a replacement name selected at the next World Meteorological Organization's Hurricane Committee. If all of the names on a list are used, storms are named using <b>the</b> <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Greek alphabet.|$|E
5|$|In Tantra, {{the fifty}} or fifty-one letters {{including}} vowels {{as well as}} consonants from A to Ksha, of the Devanagari alphabet itself, the Varnamala of bija, {{have been described as}} being the Matrikas themselves. It is believed that they are infused with the power of the Divine Mother herself. The Matrikas are considered to be the subtle form of the letters (varna). These letters combined make up syllables (pada) which are combined to make sentences (vakya) and it is of these elements that mantra is composed. It is believed that the power of mantra derives from the fact that <b>the</b> <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> alphabet are in fact forms of the goddess. The 50 Matrika Kalas are given in the same account as follows: Nivritti, Pratishtha, Vidya, Shanti, Indhika, Dipika, Mochika, Para, Sukshma, Sukshmamrita, Jnanamrita, Apypayani, Vyapini, Vyomarupa, Ananta, Srishti, Riddhi, Smriti, Medha, Kanti, Lakshmi, Dyuti, Sthira, Sthiti, Siddhi, Jada, Palini, Shanti, Aishvarya, Rati, Kamika, Varada, Ahladini, Pritih, Dirgha, Tikshna, Raudri, Bhaya, Nidra, Tadra, Kshudha, Krodhini, Kriya, Utkari, Mrityurupa, Pita, Shveta, Asita, Ananta.
