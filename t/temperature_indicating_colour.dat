50|$|HD 108063 is a {{somewhat}} bright star that lies {{in an area}} of the southern sky towards the middle of Centaurus. It has not been studied particularly extensively, but was identified as modestly high proper motion star during the previous century. With a Hipparcos parallax of 18.5 mas, it lies at a distance of 54 parsecs, so the star is fairly nearby. The relative brightness of the star at its distance means that it is substantially over-luminous compared to a dwarf star, and as of such it has been previously classified as a G5III or G4IV star. On the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (left), the star lies on the subgiant branch, confirming that it is over-luminous. The star's B-V <b>colour</b> <b>indicates</b> a spectral type of F9.5, while the spectroscopic effective <b>temperature</b> <b>indicates</b> a spectral type closer to F9.|$|R
