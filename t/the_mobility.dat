5|$|The scheme {{presented}} in the table {{is known as the}} impedance analogy. Circuit diagrams produced using this analogy match the electrical impedance of the mechanical system seen by the electrical circuit, making it intuitive from an electrical engineering standpoint. There is also <b>the</b> <b>mobility</b> analogy, in which force corresponds to current and velocity corresponds to voltage. This has equally valid results but requires using the reciprocals of the electrical counterparts listed above. Hence, M → C, S → 1/L, D → G where G is electrical conductance, the inverse of resistance. Equivalent circuits produced by this scheme are similar, but are the dual impedance forms whereby series elements become parallel, capacitors become inductors, and so on. Circuit diagrams using <b>the</b> <b>mobility</b> analogy more closely match the mechanical arrangement of the circuit, making it more intuitive from a mechanical engineering standpoint. In addition to their application to electromechanical systems, these analogies are widely used to aid analysis in acoustics.|$|E

A sense of impending victory was heightened by the interception of a German wireless message that revealed the Ottoman Dardanelles forts were running out of ammunition. When the message was relayed to Carden, it was agreed a main attack would be launched on or around 17 March. It transpired that Carden, suffering from stress, {{was placed on the}} sick list by the medical officer and command was taken over by Admiral John de Robeck.|$|E

Azotobacter also synthesizes some biologically active substances, including some phytohormones such as auxins, thereby stimulating plant growth.

Some kinds of Azotobacter can also biodegrade chlorine-containing aromatic compounds, such as 2,4,6-trichlorophenol, which was previously used as an insecticide, fungicide, and herbicide, but later was found to have mutagenic and carcinogenic effects.|$|E
5|$|Sponges {{have three}} asexual methods of reproduction: after fragmentation; by budding; and by {{producing}} gemmules. Fragments of sponges may be detached by currents or waves. They use <b>the</b> <b>mobility</b> of their pinacocytes and choanocytes and reshaping of the mesohyl to re-attach {{themselves to a}} suitable surface and then rebuild themselves as small but functional sponges {{over the course of}} several days. The same capabilities enable sponges that have been squeezed through a fine cloth to regenerate. A sponge fragment can only regenerate if it contains both collencytes to produce mesohyl and archeocytes to produce all the other cell types. A very few species reproduce by budding.|$|E

Although possessing significant forces, the Australian advance proved slow.

5|$|The area {{south of}} Lake Ladoga is a heavily forested area with many {{wetlands}} (especially peat deposits) {{closer to the}} lake.

Since the front line had changed very little since the blockade was established, the German forces had built a dense defensive network of strong points, interconnected by trenches and protected by extensive obstacles and interlocking artillery and mortar fire.

5|$|The classic view {{of water}} in cells is that about 5% of this water is {{strongly}} bound in by solutes or macromolecules as water of solvation, while the majority has the same structure as pure water. This water of solvation is not active in osmosis and may have different solvent properties, so that some dissolved molecules are excluded, while others become concentrated. However, others argue {{that the effects of}} the high concentrations of macromolecules in cells extend throughout the cytosol and that water in cells behaves very differently from the water in dilute solutions. These ideas include the proposal that cells contain zones of low and high-density water, which could have widespread effects on the structures and functions of the other parts of the cell. However, the use of advanced nuclear magnetic resonance methods to directly measure <b>the</b> <b>mobility</b> {{of water in}} living cells contradicts this idea, as it suggests that 85% of cell water acts like that pure water, while the remainder is less mobile and probably bound to macromolecules.|$|E

40|$|It is {{now more}} than a decade since the {{emergence}} of the ‘mobilities turn’ in the social sciences. Popularised in John Urry’s books on Mobilities, and Sociology Beyond Societies, {{as well as in the}} work of Tim Cresswell, Mimi Sheller, and others, the ‘mobilities turn’ has rapidly begun to influence approaches to the analysis of social life, agency, status, and power. In the years since the emergence of this transdisciplinary paradigm, <b>the</b> <b>mobilities</b> approach, and <b>the</b> examination of flows, connections, networks, and inclusion/non-inclusion that marks it, has made its way into studies of migration, urbanisation, mediatisation, social and locative media, post-industrial life and lives, globalisation, nationhood, environment, ecology, and climate change. “As movement in both time and space has become an increasingly central feature of social and cultural life,” Emily Keightley and Anna Reading suggest, “mobility is used as an explanatory device and analytical framework across humanities and social science research”. <b>The</b> <b>mobilities</b> approach has also begun to make its way into contemporary drama, theatre, performance, and public art, and the study of contemporary art practice. In some ways, <b>the</b> <b>mobilities</b> paradigm, which prioritises the study of rhythm, movement, the mobilisation of people, objects, information and ideas across space and time, contestation, change, and transformation, is a natural fit for our field. With this potentiality, it is not surprising that theatrical performance today – and, more particularly, theatrical performance in public sites, spaces, and places today – is more and more frequently engaging with <b>the</b> concepts of <b>mobility</b> and mobilities. What is interesting is that engagement with <b>the</b> <b>mobilities</b> paradigm to date has been in the theatrical performances themselves, and in scholarly articles which engage with the theatrical performances in a detailed way, offering insight into how these works individually engage spectators and social fields. As valuable as these offerings are, to date there have been few broader surveys of this field of practice, either globally or locally. This is what I seek to offer here, by mobilising <b>the</b> <b>mobilities</b> paradigm in reference to recent work in drama, theatre, and performance studies, using the same method that Mimi Sheller and John Urry have recently used in their article on ‘mobilizing <b>the</b> <b>mobilities</b> paradigm’ in <b>the</b> social sciences...|$|R
