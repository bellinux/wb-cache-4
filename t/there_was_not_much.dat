5|$|Fox Mulder's {{abduction}} was {{devised by}} Chris Carter {{towards the end}} of seventh season as a way of allowing the actor to leave the series. Duchovny fulfilled his contractual obligations after the seventh season and felt that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>much</b> else to do with the character following the previous seven years.|$|E
5|$|Thirdly, Hays faced {{opposition}} to {{his choice of}} Prince Rupert, on Kaien Island, B.C., for the western terminal, because <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>much</b> traffic there. Hays preferred the location as he believed it would provide a shorter route for transshipment to destinations in Asia.|$|E
5|$|As in {{the first}} study, the second one also {{included}} a task relating to disliking letters. Subjects were asked to select the six letters they liked the least. As before, merely having a letter in one's own name significantly reduced the chances of disliking it. This task revealed an asymmetry in the letter preference hierarchy. While {{there was a large}} consensus within each of the 12 languages as to which letters were least preferred, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>much</b> consensus at all around the most preferred letters.|$|E

5|$|Asch {{found that}} some 1/4 of all {{subjects}} successfully withstands this form of social pressure, 1//20 completely succumbs, while the remainder conforms to the majority's manifestly incorrect opinion only in some experimental rounds. Asch suggested that this procedure created a doubt in the participants' mind about the seemingly obvious answer. Participants reported that the correct but rejected line was almost but not quite equal to the standard line. Asch {{also found that the}} effectiveness of the group pressure increased significantly from 1 person to 3 people unanimously responding incorrectly. However, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>much</b> increase after that. He also found that when one confederate responded correctly, the power of the majority to influence the subject decreased substantially.|$|E
5|$|Soon after Jagiello's {{accession}} to the Polish throne, Jagiello granted Vilnius a city charter {{like that of}} Kraków, modeled on the Magdeburg Law; and Vytautas issued a privilege to a Jewish commune of Trakai on almost the same terms as privileges issued to the Jews of Poland in the reigns of Boleslaus the Pious and Casimir the Great. Władysław's policy of unifying the two legal systems was partial and uneven at first but achieved a lasting influence. By {{the time of the}} Union of Lublin in 1569, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>much</b> difference between the administrative and judicial systems in force in Lithuania and Poland.|$|E
5|$|The c.1800 {{manuscript}} related {{that the}} spell of the banner meant that it would vanish when it was displayed for the third time. The final unfurling of the banner would either gain the clan a complete victory over their enemies or meant that the clan was to suffer total extinction. The writer of the c.1800 manuscript went on to state that the temptation for unfurling the flag for {{the third and final}} time was always resisted; and {{that at the time of}} his writing, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>much</b> chance of it ever being unfurled again, since it was in such a reduced state. The writer stated that of the few shreds that remained, he himself possessed a fragment.|$|E

5|$|The delay {{caused by}} these rearguards may have seriously {{compromised}} the British Empire advance as <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>much</b> time to conclude military engagements in southern Palestine. The winter rains {{were expected to}} start {{in the middle of}} the month and the black soil plain which was currently firm, facilitating the movements of large military units would with the rains become a giant boggy quagmire, impassable for wheeled vehicles and very heavy marching for infantry. With the rains the temperatures which were currently hot during the day and pleasant at night would drop rapidly to become piercingly cold. In 1917 the rains began on 19 November just as the infantry began their advance into the Judean Hills.|$|E
5|$|This freelancing attempt did {{not start}} out well, with Benchley selling just one piece to Vanity Fair and accumulating countless {{rejections}} in two months. When a position as press agent for Broadway producer William A. Brady was offered, Benchley accepted it, {{against the advice of}} many of his peers. This experience was a poor one, as Brady was extremely difficult to work for. Benchley resigned to become a publicity director for the federal government's Aircraft Board at the beginning of 1918. His experience <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>much</b> better, and when an opportunity was offered to return to the Tribune under new editorial management, Benchley took it.|$|E
5|$|The Report was {{received}} warmly by Virginia Democratic-Republicans. The General Assembly arranged for five thousand copies to be printed and {{distributed in the}} state, but <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>much</b> public response to the Report, and {{it appears to have}} had relatively little impact on the presidential election of 1800 (which was, nevertheless, a major victory for the Democratic-Republicans and a repudiation of Federalist policies). Parties outside Virginia seemed uninterested in the rehashing of the 1798 Resolutions, and in other states there was very little public comment. Jefferson eagerly sought copies for distribution to Democratic-Republican members of Congress departing for their home states, and when they failed to arrive he entreated Monroe for at least one copy that he could reproduce. Despite Jefferson's approval of and attempt to distribute Madison's work, the national reaction was tepid. Though it had little impact on the immediate election, Madison's Report clarified the legal argument against the Acts and for states' rights in general, particularly in its advancement of the Tenth Amendment rather than the Ninth as the main bulwark against federal encroachment on state autonomy.|$|E

5|$|When Burnet {{returned}} to Australia, {{he continued his}} work on virology, including the epidemiology of herpes simplex. He was also involved in two projects that were not viral, the characterisation of the causative agents of psittacosis and Q fever. After finding that parrots and cockatoos were infected with psittacosis and were responsible for transmission, he lobbied the government for a ban {{in order to prevent}} human infection, but he was rebuffed and later came to agree with the government position that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>much</b> danger. During the time he worked on Q fever with Australian scientist E.H. Derrick, the causative organism of which was named Coxiella burnetii in Burnet's honour, he became the first person to acquire the disease in the laboratory. His epidemiological studies of herpes and Q fever displayed an appreciation of the ecology of infectious disease that became a characteristic of his scientific method.|$|E
5|$|In 1860 the Clifton Bridge Company {{was set up}} {{to oversee}} the final stages of {{completion}} and manage the operation of the bridge. They paid £50 each year to the trustees who gradually purchased the shares in the company. The revenues from tolls were minimal initially as <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>much</b> traffic; however, this increased after 1920 with greater car ownership. In 1949 the trustees purchased all the outstanding shares and debentures. The bridge is managed by a charitable trust, originally formed by the Society of Merchant Venturers following Vick's bequest. The trust was authorised to manage the bridge and collect tolls by Acts of Parliament in 1952, 1980 and 1986. A toll of £0.50 has been levied on vehicles since 2007, but the £0.05 toll that the Act allows for cyclists or pedestrians is not collected. Human toll collectors were replaced by automated machines in 1975. The tolls are used to pay for the upkeep of the bridge, including the strengthening of the chain anchor points, which was done in 1925 and 1939, and regular painting and maintenance, which is carried out from a motorised cradle slung beneath the deck. By 2008 over 4 million vehicles crossed the bridge each year.|$|E

Despite mutual support, {{counseling}} and therapy provided to employees, many of whom suffered physical ailments from the trauma, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>much</b> spirit left to carry on. After the defections of several partners, the firm dissolved in 1995.|$|E
25|$|It is {{believed}} that before Christianity became the official religion of Abyssinia (ancient Eritrea and northern Ethiopia) in the 4th century, Judaism had a heavy presence in Eritrea. Those who refused to embrace the new religion were compelled to seek refuge {{in the mountains of}} southern Ethiopia. This explains the concentration of Jews known as Beta Israel or Falasha in Gondar, Ethiopia and southern Tigray. However, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>much</b> oppression against ethnic Jews.|$|E
25|$|The Kings went to Staples Center and {{dominated}} Game 3 to regain home-court advantage, leading {{by as many}} as 27 and never trailing. They were again paced by Webber and Bibby, who combined for 50 points, and got solid contributions from Doug Christie (17 points, 12 rebounds, 6 assists, 3 steals) and Vlade Divac (11 points, 9 rebounds and 3 blocks). Other than a brief 3-point barrage in the 4th quarter by the Lakers to cut the lead to 12, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>much</b> help provided for O'Neal, who had 20 points and 19 rebounds.|$|E

25|$|Until 1912, the {{education}} system in Albania depended on religious institutions. Muslims attended Ottoman schools, the Orthodox population attended Greek or Armenian schools, Catholics attended Italian or Austrian schools, whereas in the districts near Slavic states, the population attended Serbian or Bulgarian schools. When Albania was declared independent in 1912 its government took measures to close foreign schools and to open Albanian ones. From 1912 to 1914, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>much</b> opportunity and time for progress of national education, because of the political instability and the breakout of World War I. The first laic school was opened in Shkoder in 1913.|$|E
25|$|Groundbreaking for {{the first}} section of the subway, between DeKalb Avenue and 43rd Street (ending at 36th Street), took place on November 13, 1909 at DeKalb Avenue and Flatbush Avenue, after the plans and surveys for the line were {{completed}}. This section was completed in 1916. In June 1911, more than 70 percent of the excavation was completed. The line {{did not have to be}} excavated through tough bedrock like in Manhattan; in fact, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>much</b> difficulty, owing to the fact that Brooklyn soil is sandy. The construction of the first portion of the line was broken up into six sections. The construction of the line was expected to transform communities in South Brooklyn, such as Bay Ridge, Dyker Heights, Fort Hamilton, Bath Beach, and Coney Island.|$|E
25|$|Typically <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>much</b> social mobility. It was possible, however, {{over several}} generations {{for a family}} to slowly move up the social ladder. For example, A wealthy {{merchant}} or artisan could sometimes attract a wife from an impoverished but aristocratic family. This would bring the merchant/artisan social standing and bring his wife and her family needed finances. The wealthier the family, the greater the odds that they would marry their children off to wealthy families from neighboring towns. This would increase the family influence beyond that of the local village or town. On {{the lower end of}} the social spectrum, occasionally a free farmer with a sufficient dowry for his daughter could attract an artisan to marry her. This kind of strategic marriage could sometimes be used to accomplish social mobility in as little as 2-3 generations. Sometimes the opposite occurred and families would move down the social ladder due to disgrace or financial calamity. In general though, families married within and stayed within their social class for hundreds of years.|$|E
