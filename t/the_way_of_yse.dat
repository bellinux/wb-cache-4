50|$|According to <b>the</b> <b>Way</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Open Palm, {{the key to}} {{maintaining}} the universe is by being in harmony with nature, one's surroundings, and one's station in life.

According to <b>the</b> <b>Way</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Closed Fist, on the other hand, the purpose of life is to follow <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> serving oneself—to face one's challenges head on, challenge one's station in life, and work to become self-reliant. <b>The</b> emphasis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Way</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Closed Fist is combat, turmoil, and constantly challenging oneself.
