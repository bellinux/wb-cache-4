5|$|Just as the team's {{competitive}} {{season was}} nearing its end, Lance Armstrong announced <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>planned</b> {{to return to}} competitive cycling in 2009 after a four-year absence. As Bruyneel was Armstrong's team manager for all seven of his Tour de France victories, there was much speculation immediately that Armstrong would sign with Astana in his comeback, which he eventually did.|$|E
5|$|When Scott finally read Zelda's book, a {{week after}} she'd sent it to Perkins, he was furious. The book was a semi-autobiographical account of the Fitzgeralds' marriage. In letters, Scott berated her and fumed that the novel had drawn upon the autobiographical {{material}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>planned</b> to use in Tender Is the Night, which he'd {{been working on for}} years, and which would finally see publication in 1934.|$|E

5|$|By May, Harrison {{had agreed}} {{distribution}} terms with A Records {{and was therefore}} able to formally launch Dark Horse Records, although he would remain contracted to Apple as a solo artist, like the other Beatles, until January 1976. After announcing the staging of the Music Festival from India in September 1974, Harrison also confirmed <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>planned</b> to tour North America, together with Ravi Shankar's ensemble, during November and December. Despite his stated aversion to performing live, Harrison {{would be the first}} of his former bandmates to undertake a tour of Beatle-hungry America; the expectations that this created, together with his role as a hands-on record company boss, meant that the pressure on Harrison was immense.|$|E
5|$|During the half-time interval, Stein gave also Gordon Strachan notice <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>planned</b> {{to bring}} him off {{during the second half}} and replace him with winger Davie Cooper. Stein's five-man {{defensive}} set-up meant that his midfielders were outnumbered by the Welsh, and consequently Strachan had failed to make an impact on the game up to then. Despite this, Strachan was prepared to argue with Stein that he should remain on, until Alex Ferguson cautioned him to be aware that the manager was clearly not well, and should not cause too much stress with a confrontation.|$|E

Lake wrote Earp <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>planned</b> to send portions of the book to his New York agent, but Earp objected because he wanted to read it first. After Earp's death on January 13, 1929, Josephine continued to try to persuade Lake to leave her and Earp's former wife, Mattie Blaylock, out of the book, even threatening legal action. Lake finally published Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal in 1931, two years after Earp's death.|$|E

5|$|The {{situation}} had escalated when, in 40 AD, Caligula {{announced to the}} senate <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>planned</b> to leave Rome permanently and to move to Alexandria in Egypt, where he hoped to be worshipped as a living god. The prospect of Rome losing its emperor and thus its political power was the final straw for many. Such a move would have left both {{the senate and the}} Praetorian Guard powerless to stop Caligula's repression and debauchery. With this in mind Chaerea convinced his fellow conspirators to put their plot into action quickly.|$|E
5|$|Washington {{ordered his}} men to build {{earthworks}} that were parallel to the south bank of the Assunpink Creek southeast of Trenton proper (near the modern location of the Trenton Transit Center).

Washington told his officers <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>planned</b> to move the army and that their current position was only temporary.|$|E
