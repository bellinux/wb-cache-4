Tempest learned from the young man's family members that his fiancée had the same symptoms and died on the Navajo Reservation five days earlier. Deaths on the reservations are not reported to <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>health</b> <b>department</b> because they are sovereign nations. Tempest had considered plague as the cause because it is endemic to the region. But that had already been ruled out by tests on all the victims. Within a short time, a dozen more people contracted the illness, most of them young Navajos in New Mexico. This included two relatives of the young couple who had died within a week of each other.|$|E

These brought in almost thirty hospitals in the programme and has resulted in significant increase in the donation rate in the state.
