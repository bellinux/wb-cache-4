Neurochem. 75 : 553 – 562.), further documented here by its immunostaining without cell permeabilization, is consistent with it being a binding partner for MAG on the axonal surface. Binding sites for a MAG-Fc chimera on DRGNs colocalized with MAP 1 B on neuronal varicosities, and MAG and MAP 1 B also colocalized in the periaxonal region of myelinated axons. In addition, expression of the phosphorylated isoform of MAP 1 B was increased significantly when DRGNs were cocultured with MAG-transfected COS cells. The interaction of MAG with MAP 1 B is relevant to the known role of MAG in affecting the cytoskeletal structure and stability of myelinated axons...|$|R
