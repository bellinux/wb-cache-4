40|$|Abstract: Flexible ac {{transmission}} systems (FACTS) controllers, {{which can}} effectively enhance the loadability {{of the network}} by controlling the power flows, must be placed optimally due to their high cost. This paper proposes a mixed integer based non-linear programming approach for optimal location of UPFC for system loadability enhancement in competitive electricity markets. The method accounts for ac load flow equations with constraints on generation, line flows and FACTS controller parameters. New secure bilateral <b>transaction</b> <b>matrix</b> based on AC distribution factors has also been proposed. The system loadability has been determined in a hybrid electricity market model incorporating bilateral <b>transaction</b> <b>matrix</b> in the optimal power flow model. The results obtained with UPFC have been compared with the other optimally placed FACTS controllers like TCPAR and TCSC.

Once M is available it can be subtracted from Z to obtain the matrix Zrr, which is desirable for regional calculations, i.e., Z^rr = Z - M (matrix form of Eq.  3).
