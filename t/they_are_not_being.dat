5|$|From {{the moment}} the egg is hatched, the male {{macaroni}} penguin cares for the newly hatched chick. For about 23 to 25 days, the male protects its offspring and helps to keep it warm, since {{only a few of}} its feathers have grown in by this time. The female brings food to the chick every one to two days. When <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>being</b> protected by the adult male penguins, the chicks form crèches to keep warm and stay protected. Once their adult feathers have grown in at about 60 to 70days, they are ready to go out to sea on their own.|$|E

25|$|Most modern {{dairy farms}} divide the animals into {{different}} management units {{depending on their}} age, nutritional needs, reproductive status, and milk production status. The group of cows that are currently lactating, the milking herd, is often managed most intensively {{to make sure their}} diet and environmental conditions are conducive to producing as much high quality milk as possible. On some farms the milking herd is further divided into milking strings, which are groups of animals with different nutritional needs. The segment of the adult herd that are in the resting period before giving birth to their next calf are called dry cows because <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>being</b> milked. All female animals that have yet to give birth to their first calf are called heifers. They will grow up {{to take the place of}} older animals in the milking herd and thus are sometimes generally referred to as the replacement herd.|$|E

25|$|Methods of {{effective}} {{verbal and nonverbal}} communication include treating patients with respect and showing empathy, clearly communicating with patients {{in a way that}} best fits their needs, practicing active listening skills, being sensitive with regards to cultural diversity and respecting the privacy and confidentiality rights of the patient. To use appropriate communication technology, healthcare professionals must choose which channel of communication is best suited to benefit the patient. Some channels are more likely to result in communication errors than others, such as communicating through telephone or email (missing nonverbal messages which are an important element of understanding the situation). It is also the responsibility of the provider to know the advantages and limitations of using electronic health records, as they do not convey all information necessary to understanding patient needs. If a health care professional is not practicing these skills, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>being</b> an effective communicator which may affect patient outcome.|$|E
500|$|Kyle, Cartman, Stan, [...] and Kenny enjoy a {{nice day}} outside with the weather being warm until {{a large group of}} Harley riders disturb them. The {{residents}} of South Park are frustrated by a large group of Harley riders frequently making noise in town. The Harley riders eat lunch and talk about how nobody is paying attention to them, so one of the Harley riders comes up with a noise to get everyone's attention. Before the Harley riders take off, Cartman confronts the bikers, describing them as insecure losers who ride loud motorcycles to draw attention to themselves. Cartman tells them their behavior makes them look like [...] "fags" [...] and, when other children begin referring to the bikers with the same slur, the bikers assume they are being insulted because <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>being</b> loud enough. They believe that they should be louder because after all, children are around loud stuff today (such as the Xbox 360 and Surround sound system). The motorcyclists equip their motorcycles with horns, sirens and various musical instruments. The boys devise a plan to rid the town of the bikers. However, once Butters reveals that he likes Harley motorcycles, he is not allowed to participate in the scheme. As the riders eat at a diner, Cartman defecates on the seats of their motorcycles while Kyle and Stan spray paint [...] "FAGS GET OUT" [...] on several buildings around town. The boys are pleased when the bikers temporarily leave town, but the graffiti alarms Big Gay Al and Mr. Slave because they interpret it as homophobia.|$|E
500|$|Throughout her career, Ayola {{has been}} outspoken {{on the subject}} of racial {{discrimination}} in the entertainment industry. Describing her motivation, she states: [...] "I am not an overtly political person. I just want fairness". Ayola believes that black actors receive less recognition than their white counterparts, explaining; [...] "If you get a show with six stars and one is black you are more likely to see interviews with the five white actors. [...] <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>being</b> sold as a reason to watch." [...] She believes that her career would have taken her in a different direction were she not of ethnic origin, stating: [...] "I could not have played any of the roles I have played on TV if I was white [...] I am very aware of where the glass ceiling is and it's still very low and expectations are still very low". She has noted having casting directors accept the notion of characters being both black and Welsh to be a particular problem, explaining that: [...] "I get offered a lot of very different roles, but they're never Welsh. [...] The one time I was asked to play a Welsh character on screen was in Tiger Bay for BBC Wales, but I know if that series had been called Radyr Park or Cyncoed Close I wouldn't have been in it". In 2001, Ayola founded a production company and directed a short film entitled Persephone's Playground. She presented the film at the Cannes film festival, using it as part of her campaign for increased black representation in theatre, films and television. The project, however, was largely unsuccessful, with Ayola stating: [...] "it just made me decide that if there's anything I don't want to do, it's produce films, because I'm rubbish at it. I was so bad with the budget that I just said yes to everything and then had to worry about how to pay for things at the end." [...] In 2008, Ayola offered her support to the [...] campaign Dignity! Period, aiming to provide affordable sanitary protection to Zimbabwean women.|$|E

2500|$|The overt or {{explicit}} {{curriculum in}} education {{is designed to}} meet the inferred needs of students, as they are those identified by teachers or individuals to improve the classroom learning environment. [...] In the ethics of care philosophy, inferred needs are referred to as those that come from those not directly expressing the need. [...] Most needs identified by educators for learners are inferred needs because <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>being</b> identified by the learners themselves. Students’ inferred needs can often be identified interactively, through working with them one on one or observing their behaviour in a classroom environment.|$|E
2500|$|Eurogamers Jeffrey Matulef {{compared}} the animatronic {{animals in the}} game to Weeping Angels — predatory creatures from the universe of Doctor Who — due {{to their ability to}} only move when <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>being</b> observed. Softpedia gave the game 4 out of 5 stars, with reviewer Cosmin Anton noting that it [...] "drifts away from the classic first-person horror survival titles", but that the [...] "inability to move combined with the limited power available will make you feel quite helpless in front of those relentless robots that just want to share a bit of their 'love' with you". Ben Croshaw of Zero Punctuation hailed the game as extremely effective, but expressed doubts about using jumpscares as a central game mechanic.|$|E
2500|$|Where {{classical}} hypnosis is authoritative {{and direct}} and often encounters {{resistance in the}} subject, Erickson's approach is permissive, accommodating and indirect. For example, where a classical hypnotist might say [...] "You are going into a trance", an Ericksonian hypnotist {{would be more likely}} to say [...] "you can comfortably learn how to go into a trance". In this way, he provides an opportunity for the subject to accept the suggestions they are most comfortable with, at their own pace, and with an awareness of the benefits. The subject knows <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>being</b> hustled and takes full ownership of, and participates in, their transformation. [...] Because the induction takes place during the course of a normal conversation, Ericksonian hypnosis is often known as Covert or Conversational Hypnosis.|$|E

Anthony also proclaimed,"The only question left to be settled now is: Are women persons? And I hardly believe any of our opponents will have the hardihood to say <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not.</b> <b>Being</b> persons, then, women are citizens; and no state has a right to make any law, or to enforce any old law, that shall abridge their privileges or immunities." ...|$|E

Obama expressed [...] "extraordinary appreciation and respect {{for the vast majority of}} police officers" [...] and noted the difficult nature of the job. He stated, [...] "When incidents like this occur, there's a big chunk of our citizenry that feels as if, because of the color of their skin, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>being</b> treated the same, and that hurts, and that should trouble all of us.

6000|$|At Galesburgh, {{the other}} day, I said, {{in answer to}} Judge Douglas, that three years ago there never had been a man, so far as I knew or believed, in the whole world, who had said that the Declaration of Independence did not include negroes in the term [...] "all men." [...] I reassert it to-day. I assert that Judge Douglas and all his friends may search the whole records of the country, {{and it will be}} a matter of great astonishment to me if they shall be able to find that one human being three years ago had ever uttered the astounding {{sentiment}} that the term [...] "all men" [...] in the Declaration did not include the negro. Do not let me be misunderstood. I know that more than three years ago there were men who, finding this assertion constantly in the way of their schemes to bring about the ascendency and perpetuation of slavery, denied the truth of it. I know that Mr. Calhoun and all the politicians of his school denied the truth of the Declaration. I know that it ran along in the mouth of some Southern men for a period of years, ending at last in that shameful, though rather forcible, declaration of Pettit of Indiana, upon the floor of the United States Senate, that the Declaration of Independence was in that respect [...] "a self-evident lie," [...] rather than a self-evident truth. But I say, with a perfect knowledge of all this hawking at the Declaration without directly attacking it, that three years ago there never had lived a man who had ventured to assail it in the sneaking way of pretending to believe it, and then asserting it did not include the negro. I believe the first man who ever said it was Chief Justice Taney in the Dred Scott case, and the next to him was our friend Stephen A. Douglas. And now it has become the catchword of the entire party. I would like to call upon his friends everywhere to consider how they have come in so short a time to view this matter in a way so entirely different from their former belief; to ask whether <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>being</b> borne along by an irresistible current,--whither, they know not.|$|E
