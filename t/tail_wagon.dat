50|$|A train {{coming from}} Tunisia's Sfax derailed and toppled over after {{being hit by}} the other train at the <b>tail</b> <b>wagon</b> at 3 p.m. local time (14:00 UTC) at Bir el-Bey train station.|$|E
5000|$|Progetto K {{was started}} by Fabrizio Petrucci who has {{previously}} made a variety of hand-crafted models in resin under the name King Model produced in the Centocelle region of Rome in the 1970s (Progetto K 2012). Petrucci is recognized as among the earlier modelers to make 1:43 scale cars for the collectible market. King Model produced Italian auto subjects mainly from the 1930s through the 1950s, and were usually early Alfa Romeos and FIATs. Some King Model selections were: the Fiat 1500, 1500E musone, 1100, 1100 BLR taxi, 508L, 500C, 508C long <b>tail,</b> 500C <b>wagon,</b> 1900B granluce, Alfa Romeo 2300B, 8C 2300, and a Lancia Aurelia B24 spider.|$|R
60|$|It {{was nearly}} twelve o'clock when they topped a {{treeless}} ridge {{and came in}} sight of the round-up. Below them, {{in the midst of}} a wide, grassy river flat, stood several tents and a covered wagon. Nearby lay a strong circular corral of poplar logs filled with steers. At some distance from the corral a dense mass of slowly revolving cattle moved, surrounded by watching horsemen. Down from the hills and up the valley came other horsemen, hurrying forward irregular bands of cows and calves. A small fire near the corral was sending up a pale strand of smoke, and at the <b>tail</b> of the <b>wagon</b> a stovepipe, emitting a darker column, told that dinner was in preparation. Over the scene the cloudless September sky arched. Dust arose under the heels of the herds, and the bawling roar of bulls, the call of agonized cows, and the answering bleat of calves formed the base of the shrill whoopings and laughter of the men. Nothing could be wilder, more stirring, more picturesque, except a camp of Sioux or Cheyennes in the days of the buffalo.|$|R
5000|$|After {{the entry}} of the USA into World War I on 6 April 1917, Hoople volunteered to {{minister}} to the troops of the American Expeditionary Force with the YMCA. He was appointed a secretary of the National War Council of the Y.M.C.A. of the USA. On 18 May 1918 Hoople sailed for France. While in France, Hoople worked incessantly at the front lines as an entertainer, where he not only raised {{the spirits of the}} troops with [...] "his melodious singing", but also led many soldiers to Christ. Hoople preached [...] "in barns, buildings that had been shot to pieces, from the <b>tail</b> end of <b>wagons,</b> and auto trucks. His great voice led them many times in singing the old hymns that reminded them of home and sacred things. He won the hearts of thousands of those laddies, until he was commonly known among the regiment as 'Pop'." [...] While on the front lines, Hoople was exposed to poisonous gas, and his health was subsequently damaged {{for the rest of his}} life. He was subsequently stationed in Italy and Germany, before returning to Brooklyn and his ministry at the John Wesley Pentecostal Church of the Nazarene. However, by 1919 Hoople was the pastor of the Utica Avenue Pentecostal Tabernacle that he had founded in 1894, and Rev. A.E. Reid was listed as the pastor at John Wesley church.|$|R
60|$|The hour {{set for the}} Talk {{to begin}} was three o'clock, so that people could have their naps comfortably over, after the one o'clock dinner, and be just in the right frame of mind for listening. But long before the {{appointed}} time the people who dine at twelve, and never take an afternoon nap, began to arrive, on foot, in farm-wagons, smart buggies, mud-crusted carryalls, {{and all manner of}} ramshackle vehicles. They arrived as if coming to a circus, old husbands and wives, young couples and their children, pretty girls and their fellows, and hitched their horses to the <b>tails</b> of their <b>wagons,</b> and began to make a picnic lunch {{in the shadow of the}} grove lying between the hotel and the station. About two we heard the snorting of a locomotive at a time when no train was due, and a construction train came in view, with the men waving their handkerchiefs from the windows, and apparently ready for all the fun there was to be in the thing. Some of them had a small flag in each hand, the American Stars and Stripes and the white flag of Altruria, in compliment to my guest, I suppose. A good many of the farmers came over to the hotel to buy tickets, which they said they expected to get after they came, and Mrs. Makely was obliged to pacify them with all sorts of lying promises. From moment to moment she was in consultation with the landlord, who decided to throw open the dining-room, which connected with the parlor, so as to allow the help and the neighbors to hear without incommoding the hotel guests. She said that this took a great burden off her mind, and that now she should feel perfectly easy, for now no one could complain about being mixed up with the servants and the natives, and yet every one could hear perfectly.|$|R
