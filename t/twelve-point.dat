5|$|As a {{consequence}} of the race, Michael Schumacher won the Drivers' Championship with a <b>twelve-point</b> gap over championship rival Häkkinen, who in turn was confirmed as the runner-up in the Championship. Coulthard maintained third with 67 points, nine points ahead of Barrichello, and 43 in front of Ralf Schumacher. In the Constructors' Championship, Ferrari increased their lead to thirteen points.

5|$|UT's {{second round}} {{opponent}} was 8-seeded Western Kentucky, {{who had lost}} only by to one to Louisiana Tech in the Sun Belt Tournament, and had defeated Stephen F. Austin in the first round, 88–76. Tennessee started slowly and Randall picked up two early fouls, resulting in Ace Clement taking {{her place in the}} lineup where she scored five quick points and helped the team to a <b>twelve-point</b> halftime lead. Western Kentucky pulled to within six early on in the second half, only to follow their run up by going 0 for 6 on their next shots. However, the Hilltoppers pulled back within six a second time. Once again, their run was short lived, as it was followed up with a spree of turnovers. The Lady Vols took advantage of this drought, and went on to win 82–62. Holdsclaw led all scorers with 34 and Catchings contributed 20, while Le Johnson was Western Kentucky's highest scorer, with 17.|$|E
5|$|February {{began with}} another SEC match-up, this time against unranked Alabama. Starter Kyra Elzy tore her ACL {{during the game}} ending her season, during this game, while going up for a rebound. Meanwhile, Alabama was keeping close to the Lady Vols, by slowing the game down. At half time, Tennessee only had a 13-point lead. The team never did shake off the Crimson Tide, but did manage {{to pull out the}} win, 73–66. A trip to Ole Miss was next, and the team started off much better, score the first ten points of the game and having a 54–17 lead at halftime. Summitt let the bench play the rest of the game, {{ultimately}} winning 91–45. This game was followed up by a non-conference match against longtime rival Old Dominion, whom Tennessee had beaten in the previous year's national championship. The game was even for fifteen minutes, but in the last five minutes of the half, Tennessee was able to build a <b>twelve-point</b> lead. Holdsclaw took over the second half for the Lady Vols, scoring 24 points for an 85–61 victory, ODU's biggest loss in four years. This match was followed up with another conference game, this time against the Mississippi State Bulldogs. UT started out sloppily, and ended the half with only a nine-point lead. However, once again the team came out strong to open the second half, raising their lead and eventually had double State's points, with ten minutes remaining. The Bulldogs cut the lead to eleven, but then Summitt put Holdsclaw back in, scoring eight in a row, giving Tennessee another victory, 74–52.|$|E

25|$|Louisville {{plays the}} role of {{newcomer}} to the Final Four by missing its first 13 shots. Over seven minutes into the game, Louisville has taken their second full timeout, has yet to hit a basket, and is losing 16-2. Louisville shook off the opening jitters and began scoring. Just after the final media timeout of the first half, two Angel McCoughtry free throws would cut the lead to six, but Oklahoma would outscore Louisville 10-4 to take a <b>twelve-point</b> lead into the half.|$|E

Finally it passes through the four base points of orthogonal lines dropped from each Euler point to the face not containing the vertex that generated the Euler point.|$|E
25|$|The 1990–91 {{season for}} the Merritt Centennials was {{significant}} {{in that it was}} the first time in three years that the team didn't feature a player among the top eight scorers in the Interior Conference, but it also represented a <b>twelve-point</b> improvement over the previous season. The Cents claimed the final Interior Division playoff spot with a fourth-place finish. The post-season berth wasn't really in doubt as Merritt ended up 33 points ahead of last place Penticton. In the Interior Division semifinals, the Centennials locked horns with the returning Chilliwack Chiefs, who had finished first in the division during the regular season. The Chiefs proved to be too much for Merritt, as they beat the Cents in six games. It was a close series, with Chilliwack posting 25 goals for and Merritt countering with 24 goals for. At the 1991 NHL Entry Draft, the Chicago Blackhawks made Cents defenceman Maco Balkovec the highest player ever drafted directly from the BCJHL team when they chose him in the fifth round, 110th overall.|$|E

2500|$|Duke William was {{presented}} with a <b>twelve-point</b> proposal which resembled medieval pacta conventa. The monarch had the executive power to appoint ministers, sign legislation into law, and initiate legislation in the parliament. The ministers were to be selected from among the Lithuanians and were to ultimately report to the parliament. The King was {{to abide by the}} Constitution, protect the independence and territorial integrity of Lithuania, and preserve religious tolerance. Without parliamentary approval he could not become ruler of another state. The Lithuanian language was to be used as the official state and court language, with a special provision to limit and eventually exclude all foreigners from the royal court. The monarch and his family were obligated to reside in Lithuania, spending no more than 2 months a year abroad. His children were to be educated and raised in Lithuania. In essence, the Lithuanians imposed [...] "elective ethnicity." [...] There were reports that Duke William began learning the Lithuanian language and reading about Lithuanian history and customs, but he never visited Lithuania.|$|E
2500|$|Barbados took a <b>twelve-point</b> {{lead on the}} Carib Beer Series {{table with}} a round to play after twin centuries from captain Ryan Hinds, who also took four wickets to become Man of the Match. Hinds had opted to bat first after winning the toss, and after Leewards bowler Adam Sanford took the first four wickets at St Thomas, Hinds built {{partnerships}} with Alcindo Holder (65 for the fifth wicket) and Ian Bradshaw (141 for the seventh, the highest seventh-wicket partnership in this season's tournament. Barbados ended on 360, and after a 104-run fourth-wicket partnership between Austin Richards and Sylvester Joseph, the Leewards lost seven wickets to Ian Bradshaw and Ryan Austin. Leading by 102, Barbados built onwards, with Dwayne Smith retiring hurt on 20 but returning to make 48 and Ryan Hinds once again top-scoring with 150. The Leewards were set 409 to win in well over a day, and despite the second half-century in as many matches from Steve Liburd, Barbados bowled them out for 236 to win the match. With one game left, against Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados would secure the Carib Beer Cup title by avoiding defeat.|$|E
2500|$|Johnson who {{had used}} a camera as an observer, {{reported}} to Roosevelt, to the Navy leaders, and to Congress that conditions were deplorable and unacceptable. He argued that the South West Pacific urgently needed a higher priority and {{a larger share of}} war supplies. The warplanes sent there, for example, were [...] "far inferior" [...] to Japanese planes, and morale was bad. He told Forrestal that the Pacific Fleet had a [...] "critical" [...] need for 6,800 additional experienced men. Johnson prepared a <b>twelve-point</b> program to upgrade the effort in the region, stressing [...] "greater cooperation and coordination within the various commands and between the different war theaters." [...] Congress responded by making Johnson chairman of a high-powered subcommittee of the Naval Affairs Committee, with a mission {{similar to that of the}} Truman Committee in the Senate. He probed the peacetime [...] "business as usual" [...] inefficiencies that permeated the naval war and demanded that admirals shape up and get the job done. Johnson went too far when he proposed a bill that would crack down on the draft exemptions of shipyard workers if they were absent from work too often; organized labor blocked the bill and denounced him. Johnson's biographer, Robert Dallek concludes, [...] "The mission was a temporary exposure to danger calculated to satisfy Johnson's personal and political wishes, but it also represented a genuine effort on his part, however misplaced, to improve the lot of America's fighting men." ...|$|E
