5|$|The size of {{a market}} assumes primary {{importance}} {{in the study of}} what induces investment in a country. Ragnar Nurkse referenced the work of Allyn A. Young to assert that inducement <b>to</b> <b>invest</b> is limited {{by the size of the}} market.

For example, if an automobile manufacturer is trying to decide which countries to set up plants in, he will naturally only invest in those countries where the demand is high. He would prefer <b>to</b> <b>invest</b> in a developed country, where though the population is lesser than in underdeveloped countries, the people are prosperous and there is a definite demand.|$|E
