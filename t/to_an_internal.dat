According <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>internal</b> document released in 2007, the British Army {{had failed to}} defeat the IRA but {{made it impossible for}} them to win by violence. Operation Helvetic replaced Operation Banner in 2007, maintaining fewer service personnel in a more-benign environment. From 1971 to 1997, a total of 763 British military personnel were killed during the Troubles.

The Regina Margherita class had become obsolete by the outbreak of World War I and had been reduced to training ships.

The bedroom contains an ornately carved fireplace. Doors lead off the room <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>internal</b> balcony overlooking the courtyard and to the bretache over the gate arch. The furniture is mainly by Chapple and post-dates Burges, although the washstand and dressing table are pared-down versions of two pieces – the Narcissus Washstand and the Crocker Dressing Table – that Burges made for his own home in London, The Tower House.|$|E

5|$|On 4 November 2010, Qantas Flight 32, {{en route}} from Singapore Changi Airport to Sydney Airport, {{suffered}} an uncontained engine failure, resulting {{in a series of}} related problems, and forcing the flight to make an emergency landing. The plane safely returned to Singapore. There were no injuries to the passengers, crew or people on the ground despite debris falling onto the Indonesian island of Batam. The A380 was damaged sufficiently for the event to be classified as an accident. Qantas subsequently grounded all of its A380s that day subject <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>internal</b> investigation taken in conjunction with the engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce plc. A380s powered by Engine Alliance GP7000 were unaffected but operators of Rolls-Royce Trent 900-powered A380s were affected. Investigators determined that an oil leak, caused by a defective oil supply pipe, led to an engine fire and subsequent uncontained engine failure. Repairs cost an estimated 139 million (~US$145M). As other Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines also showed problems with the same oil leak, Rolls-Royce ordered many engines to be changed, including about half of the engines in the Qantas A380 fleet. During the airplane's repair, cracks were discovered in wing structural fittings which also resulted in mandatory inspections of all A380s and subsequent design changes.|$|E

25|$|Compared <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>internal</b> {{combustion}} {{engine of the}} same power rating, Stirling engines currently have a higher capital cost and are usually larger and heavier. However, they are more efficient than most internal {{combustion engine}}s. Their lower maintenance requirements make the overall energy cost comparable. The thermal efficiency is also comparable (for small engines), ranging from 15% to 30%. For applications such as micro-CHP, a Stirling engine is often preferable <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>internal</b> combustion engine. Other applications include water pumping, astronautics, and electrical generation from plentiful energy sources that are incompatible with the internal combustion engine, such as solar energy, and biomass such as agricultural waste and other waste such as domestic refuse. However, Stirling engines are generally not price-competitive as an automobile engine, because of high cost per unit power, low power density, and high material costs.|$|E
