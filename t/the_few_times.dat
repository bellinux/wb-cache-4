5|$|Lasker {{finished}} second in an international tournament at Amsterdam, ahead of some well-known masters, including Isidore Gunsberg (assessed as the second strongest {{player in the world}} at that time by Chessmetrics). In 1890 he finished third in Graz, then shared first prize with his brother Berthold in a tournament in Berlin. In spring 1892, he won two tournaments in London, the second and stronger of these without losing a game. At New York City 1893, he won all thirteen games, one of <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>times</b> in chess history that a player has achieved a perfect score in a significant tournament.|$|E
5|$|Reproduction {{is one of}} <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>times</b> the Sunda slow loris {{aggregates}} with conspecifics, as it {{is largely}} solitary. One study recorded that the most slow lorises ever seen together was six; this {{appeared to be a}} female in estrus and five males following her. This may suggest a more promiscuous mating system, where females mate with more than one male. Despite this, its testis size is small compared with similar sized promsimians, which is indicative of monogamy. In the wild the mating system of the Sunda slow loris is thought to vary between populations.|$|E
5|$|A case {{in which}} the Taft Court struck down {{regulation}} that generated a dissent from the chief justice was Adkins v. Children's Hospital. Congress had decreed a minimum wage for women in the District of Columbia. A 5–3 majority of the Supreme Court struck it down. Justice Sutherland wrote for the majority that the recently ratified Nineteenth Amendment, guaranteeing women the vote, meant that the sexes were equal when it came to bargaining power over working conditions; Taft, in dissent, deemed this unrealistic. Taft's dissent in Adkins was rare both because he authored few dissents, and because it was one of <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>times</b> he took an expansive view of the police power of the government.|$|E
50|$|The {{first round}} was {{conducted}} in round-robin format, to one touch. Pool sizes ranged from 5 to 8 fencers. Double-touches counted against both fencers. The three contestants who had been struck <b>the</b> <b>fewest</b> <b>times</b> advanced.|$|R

5|$|The {{sequence}} in which multiple Alien Bounty Hunters appear involved {{the use of}} motion control, a method in which a motion-control camera on a computerized module is repeatedly run through the same motion while elements are continually added. The shot, according to John Wash, was one of <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>times</b> in the series in which the production crew {{was able to use}} motion control and therefore presented a slight challenge. In the filming of the sequence, both a blank plate, for just the set, and lighting elements, that were in the set, were shot before the production crew filmed five different passes, each one with the Alien Bounty Hunter in a different position. The production crew were finally able to clone the Bounty Hunter by blending all the passes together.|$|E
5|$|World War II had a {{significant}} impact on changing family roles. Because of the draft, workers were scarce in many industries and employers began to fill jobs with women, mainly in nontraditional positions. This increase in working women became one of <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>times</b> in history where women were praised for work outside the home. Divorce rates also reached a new high during this period. Not only had many women found a new sense of independence, but cultural shifts were underway, including the rise of feminism and the development of reliable methods of birth control. Such changes caused some women to decide to end their unhappy marriages.|$|E
5|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>times</b> {{a federal}} court was asked to {{invalidate}} a law or action on Third Amendment grounds was in Engblom v. Carey (1982). In 1979, prison officials in New York organized a strike; they were evicted from their prison facility residences, which were reassigned {{to members of the}} National Guard who had temporarily taken their place as prison guards. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled: (1) that the term owner in the Third Amendment includes tenants (paralleling similar cases regarding the Fourth Amendment, governing search and seizure), (2) National Guard troops count as soldiers {{for the purposes of the}} Third Amendment, and (3) that the Third Amendment is incorporated (that is, that it applies to the states) by virtue of the Fourteenth Amendment. The case was remanded to the district court, which dismissed the case on the grounds that state officials could not have been aware of this interpretation.|$|E

They also struck out <b>the</b> <b>fewest</b> <b>times</b> (766) of all 28 MLB teams. They also {{had one of the}} most formidable pitching staffs in the AL, allowing the second-fewest hits (1,261), finishing with the best ERA (3.83), <b>the</b> <b>fewest</b> runs allowed (607), fewest earned runs allowed (554), the most saves (50) and <b>the</b> <b>fewest</b> intentional walks (16).|$|R

(Game 7 of that year's World Series drew 50,596 fans to the Met, the only time a baseball crowd exceeded 50,000 and the biggest-ever attendance for baseball at the stadium.) The Vikings hosted the 1969 NFL Championship Game at the stadium.|$|E
25|$|Little {{action was}} {{actually}} {{seen as the}} Turks slipped out of El Arish, apparently getting wind of the attack a day before the Train landed. But {{it was one of}} <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>times</b> that the Train supported other Australian forces in combat, the Imperial Camel Corps and Australian Light Horse under General Sir Harry Chauvel were both involved in the Battle. However, this was the last real action that the Train saw before being disbanded.|$|E
25|$|The Edmonton Rustlers were {{winners of}} the 1933 Alpine Cup, and {{defeated}} the Preston Rivulettes to become National Champions. It was one of <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>times</b> that the Rivulettes ever lost a game as Hazel Case scored the game-winning goal and the Rustlers prevailed by a 3–2 score. In 1934, the Rivulettes were slated to play the Rustlers in a rematch for the National Championship, but the Rivulettes were unable to raise the $1800 necessary. By default, the Rustlers were champions.|$|E

The Chiefs won the game, 30–20, {{and became the first}} visiting team to travel and play on the same day. Since the game was planned for Sunday afternoon, it is one of <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>times</b> in history that the Dolphins wore their road jerseys in a home game played at night.|$|E
25|$|In 1932, Stieglitz {{mounted a}} forty-year {{retrospective}} of 127 {{of his works}} at The Place. He included all of his most famous photographs, but he also purposely chose to include recent photos of O'Keeffe, who, because of her years in the Southwest sun, looked older than her forty-five years, next to portraits of his young lover Norman. It was one of <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>times</b> he acted spitefully to O'Keeffe in public, and {{it might have been}} {{as a result of their}} increasingly intense arguments in private about his control over her art.|$|E

25|$|On {{an audio}} {{commentary}} {{track in the}} Criterion edition of the DVD, Gilliam expresses great pride in the film and says {{it was one of}} <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>times</b> where {{he did not have to}} fight extensively with the studio during the filming. Gilliam chalks this up to the fact that many of the studio executives read Thompson's book in their youth and understood it could not be made into a conventional Hollywood film. However, he does express frustration with the advertising campaign used during its initial release, which he says tried to sell it as wacky comedy. The film was later released by Universal Studios on HD DVD and, subsequently, Blu-ray; Criterion released the film on Blu-ray on April 26, 2011.|$|E
25|$|In {{his first}} meeting with Genie, James Kent {{initially}} observed no reactions from her but eventually drew a small amount of nonverbal and verbal responsiveness with a small puppet. Playing with this and similar puppets quickly became her favorite activity and, apart from her tantrums, accounted for most of <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>times</b> she expressed any emotion during the early part of her stay. Within a few days she started learning to dress herself and began voluntarily using the toilet, but she continued to suffer from nighttime and daytime incontinence which only slowly improved. Kent quickly realized there would be {{a large number of people}} working with Genie, and was concerned that she would not learn to form a normal relationship unless somebody was a steady presence in her life, so he decided to accompany her on walks and to all of her appointments.|$|E
25|$|On 10 February Napoleon moved against Blücher's over-extended army in {{the hope}} of smashing it. He caught Olsufiev's IX Corps of 5,000 Russians near the village of Baye just south of Champaubert. The battle was one of <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>times</b> during the war that France was able to take the field with a large {{numerical}} advantage, in this case six-to-one. Planning to march south to Sézanne that day, Olsufiev left the Saint-Prix bridge over the Petit Morin intact. He also left the span unguarded, so that Napoleon's cavalry seized it early in the morning. Marmont's two VI Corps divisions led the French column. Joseph Lagrange's 3rd Division filed across the Saint-Prix bridge followed by Étienne Pierre Sylvestre Ricard's 8th Division. Following Napoleon's instructions, 100 Guard Dragoons rode ahead into Bannay where they surprised and captured a group of Russian soldiers.|$|E
