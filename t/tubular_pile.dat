40|$|At present, {{in large}} precast {{concrete}} enterprises, the management over precast concrete component has been chaotic. Most enterprises take labor-intensive manual input method, which is time consuming and laborious, and error-prone. Some other slightly better enterprises choose to manage through bar-code or printing serial number manually. However, on one hand, {{this is also}} labor-intensive, on the other hand, this method is limited by external environment, making the serial number blur or even lost, and also causes a big problem on production traceability and quality accountability. Therefore, to realize the enterprise’s own rapid development and cater {{to the needs of}} the time, to achieve the automated production management has been a big problem for a modern enterprise. In order to solve the problem, inefficiency in production and traceability of the products, this thesis try to introduce RFID technology into the production of PHC <b>tubular</b> <b>pile.</b> By designing a production management system of precast concrete components, the enterprise will achieve the control of the entire production process, and realize the informatization of enterprise production management. RFID technology has been widely used in many fields like entrance control, charge management, logistics and so on. RFID technology will adopt passive RFID tag, which is waterproof, shockproof, anti-interference, so it’s suitable for the actual working environment. The tag will be bound to the precast component steel cage (the structure of the PHC <b>tubular</b> <b>pile</b> before the concrete placement), which means each PHC <b>tubular</b> <b>pile</b> will have a unique ID number. Then according to the production procedure, the precast component will be performed with a series of actions, put the steel cage into the mold, mold clamping, pouring concrete (feed), stretching, centrifugalizing, maintenance, mold removing, welding splice. In every session of the procedure, the information of the precast components can be read through a RFID reader. Using a portable smart device connected to the database, the user can check, inquire and management the production information conveniently. Also, the system can trace the production parameter and the person in charge, realize the traceability of the information. This system can overcome the disadvantages in precast components manufacturers, like inefficiency, error-prone, time consuming, labor intensity, low information relevance and so on. This system can help to improve the production management efficiency, and can produce a good economic and social benefits, so, this system has a certain practical value...|$|E

Press-in piling machines are capable of installing large <b>tubular</b> <b>piles</b> with up to 4. 6 MN of static jacking force, gaining reaction from adjacent piles within the cell. This technique permits the installation of, for example, bridge foundations, with minimal temporary works. By using static jacking force alone, environmental disturbance through noise and vibration is minimized. Since the press-in method provides a measurement of jacking resistance during installation, this value {{can be used to}} estimate the long-term capacity of the completed foundation.

Using a combination of geotechnical borings and Cone penetration soundings, the subgrade underlying the road was characterized, providing litho-stratigraphic, shear strength, bearing capacity, settlement and axial pile capacity data for the area.

Model piles were manufactured from glass which enabled soil displacement both inside the outside of the pile to be observed. The tests results indicate that (i) a pile with a driving shoe generates greater initial resistance however substantial reductions occur as the pile installation depth increases due to increased lateral soil movement, (ii) surface body ribs are effective in maintaining reduced interface friction {{along the length of the}} pile and (iii) onset of soil plugging occurs at increased installation depths producing ‘closed end’ pile conditions which reduced installation resistance...|$|E
40|$|A new formal {{solution}} for the multiple scattering of plane harmonic waves {{by a group of}} arbitrary configuration tubular piles in an elastic total space is derived. Each order of scattering satisfies prescribed boundary conditions at the interface of tubular piles, which is delivered as the sum of incident and scattering waves. The first order performs the scattering wave by each scattered pile and the subsequent orders resulted from the excitation of each pile of first order of scattering from the remaining tubular piles. Advanced scattering orders can be regarded as the same manners. Several series of scattering coefficients are figured out with the aids of addition theorem so that the exact steady-state {{solution for}} the scattered displacement and stress is obtained. Particularly, when internal diameter of tubular piles tends to be infinitely small, it degenerates to a solid pile problem. By imposing the normalized displacement amplitudes and transmissibility indices, the influences of specific parameters such as scattering orders, internal and external diameter ratio of piles, pile material rigidity, position and distances between <b>tubular</b> <b>pile</b> and pile rows, and pile numbers are discussed.

40|$|Since 1970 costal {{structures}} in the Port of Koper are designed as reinforced concrete slabs founded on vertical and inclined steel piles with a slope under the deck. This method of construction requires the excavation of large quantities of silt with bad characteristics, which is used mainly for acquiring new surfaces. The amount of pumped silt, derived from construction of new docks and deepening waterways, exceeds needs. Therefore {{it is necessary to}} take the extra silt elsewhere, which represents an increasing cost for the port. In the thesis is analyzed the possibility of using sheet pile wall on the particular case of the extension of dock number 11. The proposed coastal structure consists of concrete slab founded on steel <b>tubular</b> <b>piles</b> and steel sheet pile wall, which has a soil retaining and bearing function. This method of construction does not required addition excavations. Because of the complexity of the structure, individual elements and appropriate geometry models are acquired step by step. Initially the possibility of using a concrete slab on ground level founded on steel <b>tubular</b> <b>piles</b> and combined sheet pile wall that consist of different types of primary and secondary elements is analyzed. Because of the poor bearing capacity of the soil such type of structure is not an option. The following steps show the need of anchorage, inclination of piles and sheet wall and a relieving platform.

40|$|Four {{instrumented}} sites, with a {{total of}} 14 instrumented piles, have been analysed to understand the structural behaviour of the piles and the geotechnical behaviour of the stabilised slopes. Vibrating wire strain gauges are used for the calculation of the bending moment applied to the piles, while inclinometers are used to measure the displacements. A review of the instrumentation has been carried out and a methodology for processin and analysing strain gauges data has been developed. Concrete is a material with a complex behaviour. Shrinkage, creep, cracking, temperature variations, strength and modulus of elasticity of concrete are critically analysed to understand their influence on the concrete pile behaviour and on the function of the strain gauges. The results show that creep and shrinkage effects can be neglected in underground reinforced concrete structures in saturated clay, while cracking effects and temperature variations have to be analysed case by case. A correction method has been developed to consider the difference between the coefficient of thermal expansion of the strain gauges and that of the concrete. Two types of pile have been analysed, standard reinforced concrete piles and circular concrete-filled steel tubular piles. A review of their behaviour in bending that considers the development of cracking is presented. Two methods for the calculation of bending moment in the piles have been developed taking into account realistic stress/strain curves and the effects of concrete cracking. The bending moment results are compared with the inclinometer profiles using an improved version of an existing curve fitting method. The comparison shows good agreement between the two instrument results. A critical analysis of the pile/soil behaviour has been carried out comparing the results from the instrumented sites with theoretical mechanisms for landslide stabilising piles presented elsewhere. The results show a good match with the theoretical mechanisms as well as showing that the slopes have been successfully stabilised. Other observations have been made during analysis of the monitoring data.

40|$|Fibre {{composites}} have inherent {{material properties}} that {{are better than}} other existing materials such as steel, timber, or concrete in numerous environments. In the marine and ground-zone environments in particular, fibre composite materials can be selected for their corrosion, rot, and pest resistance, as well as high strength-to-weight ratio. The advantages of fibre composites over traditional construction materials, is their high strength, light weight, less corrosive, durable, and most importantly, no decay / deterioration by natural organisms, which is the dominant problem for timber piles used in water front structures. This research project, focused {{on the development of}} a system for decayed timber piles replacement, for piers, jetties, bridges and boardwalks, using fibre composite technology to enable rehabilitation of the structures, as well as new construction, by using Glass Fibre Reinforced Polymer (GFRP) <b>tubular</b> <b>pile</b> and connector. Three objectives were considered to examine the structural behaviour of GFRP tubular piles and connector used for novel timber pile rehabilitation technique. As the first objective, the effects of various loading scenarios on the capacity of the GFRP hollow tubular piles were investigated. Then as a second objective, numerical simulations were performed using the finite element analysis approach to verify experiments, and study the behaviour of the overall pile rehabilitation system. Based on the results of these numerical simulations, further research areas were highlighted for filler material development, which was used to fill the space between the GFRP connector and the existing timber pile. Due to durability, pumpability, workability and compressive strength requirements, polyester resin based filler development was chosen. As the third objective, appropriate polyester based filler materials were developed for the GFRP tubular connector, to transfer the vertical load from the super structure, to the original timber stump, by the connector. A research program has been initiated to improve the fundamental understanding of this rehabilitation concept. A new polyester based filler material has been considered to provide the working knowledge required for its broad utilisation. Fibre composites have not been used in this specific manner previously. While there have been fibre composite wraps developed, these are not the replacement systems, and have inherent weaknesses in their application, being more difficult to install, and needing to be highly tailored to specific instances. The concept developed, tested and verified in this study is viable for general timber pile rehabilitations in piers / jetties with reasonable factor of safety and will be possible to extended rural two lane timber bridges. The results of this research, reveals a system, designed from an engineering perspective, relatively simple to install. Further, it is favourably disposed to mass production processes, to gain efficiencies of scale. Finally, this targeted research project, uncovers a timber pile rehabilitation system, capable of accepting the full working loads, while also ensuring a life span of some 50 - 100 years, with minimal maintenance. ...|$|E

The current codes of practice such as API/DnV suggest methods to analysis long flexible piles which are being used (often without any modification) to analyse large diameter monopiles giving unsatisfactory results. As a result, there is {{an interest in the}} analysis of deep foundation {{for a wide range of}} length to diameter (L/D) ratio embedded in different types of soil. This paper carries out a theoretical study utilising Hamiltonian principle to analyse deep foundations (L/ 2 D≥) embedded in three types of ground profiles (homogeneous, inhomogeneous and layered continua) that are of interest to offshore wind turbine industry. Impedance functions (static and dynamic) have been proposed for piles exhibiting rigid and flexible behaviour in all the 3 ground profiles. Through the analysis, it is concluded that the conventional Winkler-based approach (such as p–y curves or Beanon-Dynamic Winkler Foundations) may not be applicable for piles or caissons having aspect ratio less than about 10 to 15. The results also show that, for the same dimensionless frequency, damping ratio of large diameter rigid piles is higher than long flexible piles and is approximately 1. 2 – 1. 5 times the material damping. It is also shown that Winkler-based approach developed for flexible piles will under predict stiffness of rigid piles, thereby also under predicting natural frequency of the WTG system.

40|$|Extreme folding {{damage of}} {{open-ended}} <b>tubular</b> <b>piles</b> could occur during piling in onshore practices. Amazonehaven unique quay wall removal gave {{the opportunity to}} study king pile’s failure close to toe. King piles are primary piles in a combined wall system, exposed to static and dynamic load. It is argued that the unexpected pile toe failure {{have been caused by}} dynamic load because of the uniaxial direction of the extreme deformations. However, research into pile toe failure in Amazonehaven shows that hammer-induced driving stresses are significantly lower than material’s yield stress close to pile toe, given Amazonehaven soil condition. Therefore, the dynamic load has not been solely detrimental to the pile toe integrity. The main reasons for pile toe failure are discussed to be (1) pile imperfection, (2) pile inclination and (3) pile inhomogeneous strength. Bear in mind that, pile toe failure to such extent when not limited might lead to dysfunction of the asset during its technical lifetime. Therefore, counteractions must be taken to assure quay wall’s safety and stability while operating. The remedies when such a piling risk event occur could be: replacement, early maintenance, or a reduction in its designed storage capacity. The reactive solutions will bring financial consequences of pile toe failure forward. In other words, the client will experience a reduction in its revenues due to asset’s malfunction. However, when proactive process-based alternatives are implemented in the current procedure in piling industry, the probability of occurrence of the failure is to be reduced. Therefore, financial consequences of piling risk event will remain limited.

40|$|Modeling {{pile driving}} {{is a complex}} process, {{including}} vibrations generated from the driving hammer, propagating further through the pile and transferred to the surroundings at the pile-soil interface. The vibrations propagating through the ground interact with structures, potentially causing damage to both underground and structures at surface level or potentially disturbing their inhabitants. Prediction models of ground vibrations focus on estimating the vibrations at ground surface level. The prediction of vibration amplitude at different depths can be more useful at sites with sensitive ground conditions. A model predicting these subsurface vibrations, easily applicable in engineering practice is currently not available or not validated. One of the impediments in developing a model for predicting ground vibrations at different depths {{is the lack of}} field data for validation. The purpose of this thesis is to find a prediction model for ground vibrations at different depths below the surface level. The study is focused on vibrations induced by impact driving of open ended steel <b>tubular</b> <b>piles.</b> A literature study was conducted to gain theoretical knowledge on pile driving and ground vibrations. The model developed by Massarsch and Fellenius [15] was found in the literature and although it predicts ground vibrations at surface level, the adaptation of the model for predicting vibrations at different depths was studied. Vibration measurements from the field test performed in the Caland Canal have been analyzed. The soil profile at the site consists of sandy clay and clay layers overlying a dense sand layer. First, large diameter dolphin piles were driven by a vibratory hammer. When the pile toe reached the dense sand layer, the driving process was changed to impact hammering in order to change the characteristics of the vibrations transmitted through the soil. The pile driving was extensively monitored and particle velocities were recorded by 3 D geophones placed up to depths of NAP - 22 m (9. 50 m embedment depth). The prediction model of Massarsch and Fellenius [15] makes a distinction between the velocities of different wave types emitted from piles during impact driving. These waves are the shear waves propagating with a cylindrical wave front along the pile shaft and compression waves emitted at the pile toe, propagating with a spherical wave front. Surface waves resulting from wave reflection at ground surface are not considered in this thesis, as this research focuses on vibrations at different depths. Wave velocities are calculated from the hammer input energy, taking into account ground conditions and considering the vibration transmission efficacy which defines the amount of energy transmitted at the pile-soil interface. The model is adapted for open ended <b>tubular</b> <b>piles.</b> Due to the large diameter of the dolphin piles and the present soil conditions, the soil plugging effect and its contribution to dynamic soil resistance at the pile toe are ignored. Dynamic soil resistance at the pile toe is considered the source of spherical waves, while the soil resistance along the pile shaft is the source of cylindrical waves. The ratio between the pile cross section and the total area delimited by the external diameter is taken into account when calculating the dynamic soil resistance at the pile toe, resulting particle velocities of spherical waves smaller than unity. Therefore the cylindrical waves propagating from the pile shaft are considered the main source of ground vibrations. The results of the prediction model have been compared to vibration values measured in the field test. The predicted vibration amplitudes are a good approximation of the vibration levels measured in the sandy clay and clay layers. The predicted vibrations are of higher magnitude compared to the amplitude of vibrations recorded by the sensors placed in the dense sand layer.

40|$|Investigations {{into the}} {{performance}} of concrete plugs in <b>tubular</b> steel <b>piles</b> under tension and compression have been conducted at Monash University {{over the past three}} years. The work presented in this paper reports the result of push out tests carried out on seven steel tubes specimens filled with reinforced concrete plugs with variable depths. Only one tube diameter, one concrete strength and one reinforcement arrangement was tested. The single variable was the length of the plug. Test results included the ultimate push -out forces, slip of concrete plugs, and longitudinal and hoop strains along the piles for some specimens. Strain measurements on the steel tube allowed the determination of shear transfer during the push out tests. The tests clearly showed that average bond strength achieved in compression significantly exceeds expectations and it is higher than the results of previous investigations using plugs without reinforcement...|$|R
40|$|The {{cost of the}} {{foundation}} can be up to 20 - 30 % of the total building cost. Reducing consumption of materials and quality selection of the required characteristics of the pile can reduce both the estimated cost and time of work. In terms of compact construction and the high land prices the most relevant is high-rise building. But {{it is hard to}} build in soft ground conditions (for example, in St. Petersburg). The situation is complicated by insufficiently explored methods of selection and design of piles (especially steel-tube piles) for specific cases of construction, {{as well as by the}} absence of regulatory documents related to the high-performance technology. The article considers the clarification methods for calculating the bearing capacity of <b>tubular</b> steel <b>piles.</b> An additional contribution of soil core to the overall bearing capacity due to accounting an effect of its "natural" selflocking in the cavity of the steel pipe is considered. The conclusions about the effectiveness of the piles, depending on different initial parameters are made...|$|R
40|$|In 2010 the Newcastle Port Corporation {{replaced}} {{a number}} of <b>tubular</b> mild steel <b>piling</b> after 33 years of service on the New South Wales Pacific Ocean coast due to heavy localized corrosion attack. Four of these tubular pilings {{were taken to the}} University of Newcastle for investigation. This paper reports on multiple longitudinal cross section loss measurements which allowed for statistical analysis of the variability of corrosion loss at different elevations. The statistical results are unique for such long-term exposures and are of major importance for structural reliability analyses of similar marine infrastructure assets. A pattern consistent with so-called accelerated low water corrosion was observed, suggesting microbiological attack at some point in time...|$|R
40|$|Impact driving {{technique}} {{is commonly used}} in offshore environments to install pipe piles. This technique consists in striking the pile head with a hammer to reach the required installation depth. The quest for offshore wind energy demands that pipe pile foundations be installed in increasingly challenging geotechnical conditions. To reach final installation depth, the pile has now to be driven through very dense soil with high resistance and even into rock layers. This increases the difficulty of pile driving while avoiding its damage during hammering. The objective of this thesis is to portray stresses in a pipe pile during driving into rock layer and to assess the structural integrity of the pile toe. An analytical approach has been attempted first {{to solve the problem}} for the static case. On one hand, an original analytical solution of a pipe pile subjected to non-axial static loading has been developed based on the Airy stress function. This solution gave results approaching those of Boussinesq’s plane strain solution for the case of large diameters. On the other hand, two novel closed-form solutions for cylindrical and spherical cavity expansion in a rock mass governed by a particular case of the Hoek-Brown yield criterion were developed and validated numerically. Two numerical methods were implemented to simulate dynamic pipe pile driving into rock: the Lagrangian method consisting in an axisymmetric modelling based on the “zipper type” technique and the Coupled Eulerian Lagrangian method (CEL- 3 D). Stresses in <b>tubular</b> <b>piles</b> during impact driving were evaluated, allowing the structural integrity of the pile toe to be assessed. To validate the proposed numerical models, a 1 g reduced scale model was built, featuring different synthetic rock resistances. The developed experimental model is able to simulate pipe pile driving into rock. Comparison between numerical simulations (CEL- 3 D) and experimental tests showed similar results in terms of strains at the pile toe level. Based on numerical simulations and experimental results, the following conclusions can be drawn: • The power form of the Extended Drucker-Prager yield criterion can emulate the mechanical behaviour of rock mass governed by the Hoek-Brown yield criterion. • The “zipper-type” {{technique is}} applicable to quasi-static cone penetration into dense sand and fully coring penetration of pipe pile undergoing driving. • Pipe pile driving into good quality rock mass (σc> 20 MPa) entails a significant risk of damaging the pile toe; the use of high steel grade is recommended.
