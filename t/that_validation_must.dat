A {{look at some of}} the domains involved, including at least medical devices, automotive, railway, aeronautical, space and telecommunications provides a feeling on the importance of the topic. For many of these domains, and partly because of the increasing complexity of software, validation is an open issue and not straightforward at all, both from a technical and from a managerial point of view. Another topic to consider is <b>that</b> <b>validation</b> is often performed at the end the development lifecycle, which results in obvious calendar problems. One of the consequences is that the relevance of lifecycle processes such as system testing and <b>validation</b> <b>must</b> be broadened. Therefore inputs from research and experience from industry is required in order to enable innovative, and often more rigorous, approaches...|$|R

40|$|Medical imaging {{informatics}} must {{exceed the}} mere development of algorithms. The discipline is {{also responsible for}} the establishment of methods in clinical practice to assist physicians and improve health care. From our point of view, it is commonly accepted that model-based analysis of medical images is superior to other concepts, but only a few applications are found in daily clinical use. The gap between development of model-based image analysis and its routine application can be addressed by identifying four necessary transfer steps: formulation, parameterization, instantiation, and validation. Usually, computer scientists formulate the model and define its parameterization, i. e., configure a model to handle a selected subset of clinical data. During instantiation, the algorithm adapts the model to the actual data, which is validated by physicians. Since medical a priori knowledge and particular knowledge on technical details are required for parameterization and validation, these steps are considered to be bottlenecks. In this paper, we propose general schemes that allow an application- or image-specific parameterization to be performed by medical users. Combining noncontextual and contextual approaches, we also suggest a reliable scheme <b>that</b> allows application-specific <b>validation,</b> even if a gold standard is unavailable. To emphasize our point of view, we provide examples based on unsupervised segmentation in medical imagery, {{which is one of the}} most difficult tasks. Following the proposed schemes, an exact delineation of cells in micrographs is parameterized, validated, and successfully established in daily clinical use, while automatic determination of body regions in radiographs cannot be configured to support reliable and robust clinical use. The results stress <b>that</b> parameterization and <b>validation</b> <b>must</b> be based on clinical data that show all potential variations and artifact sources...|$|R

30|$|Finally, {{certificate}} <b>validation</b> <b>must</b> be scalable. Asking one’s {{friends to}} validate certificates scales well under three assumptions. Firstly, users <b>that</b> consume <b>validation</b> services, i. e., requesting other clients to perform certificate validation on their behalf, do also offer validation services to others, i. e., {{there is no}} free-riding. Secondly, friends trust each other mutually, i. e., {{they are willing to}} consume and offer validation services among themselves. Thirdly, the available resources offered by a group of friends are sufficient to handle the aggregate query volume issued by all of its members. However, in reality, it is difficult to force users to honor these assumptions. Therefore, a practical system should be able to cope with unbalanced trust relationships as well as uneven resources and loads.|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, {{commercial}} banks have devoted many resources to developing internal models to better quantify their financial risks and assign economic capital. These {{efforts have been}} recognized and encouraged by bank regulators; for example, the 1997 Market Risk Amendment (MRA) formally incorporates banks' internal, value-at-risk models into regulatory capital calculations. A key component {{in the implementation of}} the MRA was the development of standards, such as for model <b>validation,</b> <b>that</b> <b>must</b> be satisfied in order for banks' models to be used for regulatory capital purposes. Recent proposals, such as by the IIF (1998) and ISDA (1998), argue that credit risk models should also be used to determine risk-adjusted capital requirements.; However, an important question for both users of such models and their regulators is evaluating the accuracy of the model's forecasts of credit losses. A serious impediment to such model validation is the small number of forecasts available due to the long planning horizons typical of credit risk models. Using a panel data approach, we propose evaluation methods for credit risk models based on cross-sectional simulation. Specifically, models are evaluated not only on their forecasts over time, but also on their forecasts at a given point in time for simulated credit portfolios. Once the forecasts corresponding to these portfolios are generated, they can be evaluated using various methods, such as the binomial method commonly used for evaluating value-at-risk models and currently embodied in the MRA.
