40|$|Objective. In this study, we {{evaluated}} the clinical efficacy of mandible reconstruction with preoperative virtual planning, {{which focused on}} esthetics and occlusion. Study Design. A series of 9 patients were enrolled prospectively to undergo mandibulectomy and simultaneous reconstruction. Preoperative spiral CT scans of the maxillofacial region and the fibula region were performed. Virtual surgery of tumor resection and fibula reconstruction was performed in the Mimics platform. The reconstructed mandible models were fabricated with CAD/CAM technique. The reconstruction plate and the <b>positioning</b> <b>template</b> were accommodated to the stereolithographic model as the surgical template. Results. Surgery was performed accurately according to the templates. All the fibula flaps survived. The appearance and occlusion of the patients were satisfactory. Conclusions. With preoperative virtual planning, the spatial relationship of the mandible and the fibula graft can be planned individually, which helps achieve optimum appearance and occlusion relationship. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|In this paper, a {{modeling}} {{technique for}} CMOS gates, {{based on the}} reduction of each gate to an equivalent inverter, is presented. The proposed method can be incorporated in existing timing simulators {{in order to improve}} their accuracy. The conducting and parasitic behavior of parallel and serially connected transistors is accurately analyzed and an equivalent transistor is extracted for each case, taking into account the actual operating conditions of each device in the structure. The proposed model incorporates short-channel effects, the influence of body effect and is developed for nonzero transition time inputs. The exact time point when the gate starts conducting is efficiently calculated improving significantly the accuracy of the method. A mapping algorithm for reducing every possible input pattern of a gate to an equivalent signal is introduced and the "weight" of each <b>transistor</b> <b>position</b> in the gate structure is extracted. Complex gates are treated by first mapping every possible structure to a NAND/NOR gate and then by collapsing this gate to an equivalent inverter.

40|$|To recover a {{mandible}} defect, {{the defect}} is resected {{and the resulting}} bone gap can be reconstructed by a fibula graft that shaped similar to the resected part of the mandible. Mandible resection and shaping of the fibula bone is assisted by computer-aided simulation and computer-aided manufacturing (CAS/CAM). In a nutshell, these techniques introduce virtual surgery (CAS) to design an optimal virtual resection and reconstruction plan.

40|$|The {{carcinogen}} 2 -acetylaminofluorene forms {{two major}} DNA adducts: N-(2 ′-deoxyguanosin- 8 -yl) - 2 -acetylaminofluorene (dG-AAF) and its deacetylated derivative, N-(2 ′-deoxyguanosin- 8 -yl) - 2 -aminofluorene (dG-AF). Although the dG-AAF and dG-AF adducts are distinguished {{only by the}} presence or absence of an acetyl group, they have profoundly different effects on DNA replication. dG-AAF poses a strong block to DNA synthesis and primarily induces frameshift mutations in bacteria, resulting in the loss of one or two nucleotides during replication past the lesion. dG-AF is less toxic and more easily bypassed by DNA polymerases, albeit with an increased frequency of misincorporation opposite the lesion, primarily resulting in G → T transversions. We present three crystal structures of bacteriophage T 7 DNA polymerase replication complexes, one with dG-AAF in the <b>templating</b> <b>position</b> and two others with dG-AF in the <b>templating</b> <b>position.</b> Our crystallographic data suggest why a dG-AAF adduct blocks replication more strongly than does a dG-AF adduct and provide a possible explanation for frameshift mutagenesis during replication bypass of a dG-AAF adduct. The dG-AAF nucleoside adopts a syn conformation that facilitates the intercalation of its fluorene ring into a hydrophobic pocket on the surface of the fingers subdomain and locks the fingers in an open, inactive conformation. In contrast, the dG-AF base at the <b>templating</b> <b>position</b> is not well defined by the electron density, consistent with weak binding to the polymerase and a possible interchange of this adduct between the syn and anti conformations...|$|R

The ΔF508 mutation is a deletion of the C-G pair from position 507 along with the first two T-A pairs from position 508, leaving the DNA sequence A-T-T (paired with T-A-A) at position 507, which is transcribed into the mRNA codon A-U-U. Since A-U-U also codes for isoleucine, position 507's amino acid does not change, and the mutation's net effect is equivalent to a deletion ("Δ") of the sequence resulting in the codon for phenylalanine at position 508.|$|R

40|$|RNA-dependent RNA polymerases play a {{vital role}} in the growth of RNA viruses where they are {{responsible}} for genome replication, but do so with rather low fidelity that allows for the rapid adaptation to different host cell environments. These polymerases are also a target for antiviral drug development. However, both drug discovery efforts and our understanding of fidelity determinants have been hampered by a lack of detailed structural information about functional polymerase-RNA complexes and the structural changes that take place during the elongation cycle. Many of the molecular details associated with nucleotide selection and catalysis were revealed in our recent structure of the poliovirus polymerase-RNA complex solved by first purifying and then crystallizing stalled elongation complexes. In the work presented here we extend that basic methodology to determine nine new structures of poliovirus, coxsackievirus, and rhinovirus elongation complexes at 2. 2 – 2. 9 A ̊ resolution. The structures highlight conserved features of picornaviral polymerases and the interactions they make with the template and product RNA strands, including a tight grip on eight basepairs of the nascent duplex, a fully pre-positioned templating nucleotide, and a conserved binding pocket for the + 2 <b>position</b> <b>template</b> strand base.
