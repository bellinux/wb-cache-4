After the Nazi regime {{came to power in}} Germany in 1933, she was operated as part of the Strength Through Joy programme, which provided leisure activities and cheap holidays as a means of promoting the party's ideology. She ran aground off <b>Thorshavn,</b> Faroe Islands, on 23 July 1934, but was refloated the next day.|$|E
500|$|Survivors {{estimated}} that about 900 men abandoned Glorious. The Germans {{did not try}} to pick up survivors. The Royal Navy knew nothing of the sinking until it was announced on German radio. [...] The Norwegian ship , on passage to the Faroe Islands, arrived late on 10 June and picked up survivors, eventually delivering 37 alive to <b>Thorshavn</b> of whom two later died. Another Norwegian ship, Svalbard II, also making for the Faeroes, picked up five survivors but was sighted by a German aircraft and forced to return to Norway, where the four still alive became prisoners of war for the next five years. It is also believed that one more survivor from Glorious was rescued by a German seaplane. Therefore, the total of survivors was 40, including one each from Acasta and Ardent. The total killed or missing was 1,207 from Glorious, 160 from Acasta and 152 from Ardent, a total of 1,519.|$|E
5000|$|Rasmus Rask was a world-famous Danish {{comparative}} language historian. He {{was interested}} in Icelandic from his youth and in 1816 he helped in forming the Icelandic Literary Union (Hið íslenska Bókmentafélag) and in 1818 the Library in Reykjavik (later Landsbókasafn Islands). He helped establish Literary Societies on London, Iceland and Copenhagen. His interest in Faroese inspired and helped {{in the creation of}} the written Faroese language of 1846. He helped Rafn in the translation of Faroe Saga. He was one of the leading inspirations behind the Faroese Library (<b>Thorshavns</b> Læsebibliothek - Later Færo Amts Bibliotek - and even later Landsbókasavnið) - helping Davidsen with many gifts of books.|$|R

They gave it the name Sandefjordbukta after the town of Sandefjord, Norway, center of the Norwegian whaling industry. The term [...] "ice bay" [...] is applied to this feature because of its formation in ice, and to reduce confusion with other bays of this name, particularly Sandefjord Bay on Coronation Island.|$|E

It was discovered February 20, 1935 by Captain Klarius Mikkelsen in the <b>Thorshavn,</b> a Norwegian whaling ship sent out by Lars Christensen. It is named for Captain Mikkelsen's wife Caroline Mikkelsen, who accompanied her husband on this voyage {{and became the first}} woman to set foot on Antarctica.|$|E
5000|$|She joined two expeditions {{undertaken}} by whaling fleet owner Lars Christensen {{and his wife}} Ingrid Christensen on the tanker <b>Thorshavn,</b> one in 1933 and one in 1936-7. Recent research suggests Rachlew was the second woman ever {{to land on the}} mainland of Antarctica, and the third to step onto the continent including islands. The four women had [...] "travelled nearer to the South Pole than any woman had done before," [...] Christensen was reported to have said when he arrived in London from South Africa on his way back.|$|E
5000|$|An {{association}} of cooperatives formed in Zealand in 1884 was first named the Fællesforeningen for Danmarks Brugsforeninger, but the present FDB {{was founded in}} 1896 from a merger between that association and the cooperative association for Jutland. In 1897, it began forming its own factories and brands, some of which [...] like Cirkel-brand coffee [...] continue to be successful although most were shuttered in the 1980s and 1990s. In 1918, it helped form the NAF ( [...] , [...] "Nordic Coop Federation") which later became Coop Norden AB. In 1952, it opened the first viable supermarket in the Faroes at <b>Thorshavn.</b>|$|E
50|$|Despite all {{the unrest}} and disruption, Hazelhoff Roelfzema {{still managed to}} pass exams, and was awarded his {{doctorate}} in law on 10 June 1941. Three weeks later he was an Engelandvaarder, a Dutchman who escaped Nazi control by {{finding a way to}} reach England. Hazelhoff Roelfzema, Peter Tazelaar, Bram van der Stok, Gerard Volkersz, and Toon Buitendijk posed as crew members aboard the SS St. Cergue, a Swiss freighter bound for New York City. The ship was intercepted in the North Sea by the British cruiser HMS Devonshire, suspecting her to be a German resupply ship. The Devonshire escorted her to <b>Thørshavn,</b> in the Faroe Islands, were the stowaways were brought ashore. Hazelhoff Roelfzema persuaded the captain of the British cruiser to give them passage to Britain.|$|E
50|$|In April 1899 {{the steam}} trawler Caspian was fishing off the Faroe Islands when a Danish gunboat tried to arrest her for {{allegedly}} fishing illegally inside the limits. The trawler refused {{to stop and}} was fired upon. Eventually the trawler was caught, but before the skipper left his ship to go aboard the Danish gunboat, he ordered the mate to make a dash for it after {{he went on to}} the Danish ship. The Caspian set off at full speed. The gunboat fired several shots at the unarmed boat but could not catch up with the trawler, which returned heavily damaged to Grimsby, England. On board the Danish gunboat, the skipper of the Caspian was lashed to the mast. A court held at <b>Thorshavn</b> convicted him on several counts, including illegal fishing and attempted assault, and he was jailed for thirty days.|$|E
50|$|Amberg's approach, {{like that}} of his contemporaries, was {{influenced}} by the Historicist requirement to adopt one or more historical styles in every assignment. He designed buildings in the Faroe Islands, including a residence in <b>Thorshavn</b> and Eidi Church on the island of Suðuroy (1880-1881); both with characteristic pyramid spires. His Tinghus in the centre of Esbjerg (1891) and the manor at Vindeholme near Nakskov (1913) are also notable. His greatest achievements were, however, in the area of restoration and renovation work including that on the town hall of Ribe (1882-1884) and Ribe Cathedral (1882-1904) as well as the old priory in Mariager (1891-1892). He also restored St Nicolas Church and, under the sponsorship of Carl Jacobsen, redesigned its spire (1908-1910); in collaboration with Carl Brummer, he designed a spire for the Church of Our Lady in Copenhagen. The latter project was, however, not completed as Jacobsen died in 1914.|$|E
5000|$|During the {{qualification}} for the Euro 1992, Faroe Islands participated for {{the first}} time in international football. A problem for them was that no UEFA-approved grass pitch arena existed at this North Atlantic country.For unknown reasons Faroe Islands then chose Landskrona IP as their temporary home ground. Their first opponents were Austria, a team who were expected to win against this small nation, who were new to international football, but Faroe Islands won their first ever competition game 1:0 [...] "home" [...] at Landskrona IP, on 12 September 1990. This led to a fast decision, to build a usable home ground in <b>Thorshavn</b> within weeks. However UEFA decided that it would not be fair for the other national teams to have to play at the new stadium at Faroe Islands, hence another three international competition games were played at Landskrona IP, against Denmark, Yugoslavia and Northern Ireland.|$|E
50|$|The {{coastline}} in {{the vicinity}} of the bay was first seen and named the IngridChristensen Coast by Captain Mikkelsen of the Norwegian ship <b>Thorshavn</b> on 20 February 1935. Oblique aerial photographs of the coastline were taken on a Lars Christensen financed expedition in 1937 as well as by the US Navy’s Operation Highjump in 1947 for reconnaissance purposes. In the 1954-55 summer, the Australian National Antarctic Research Expedition (ANARE) explored the waters of Prydz Bay on the Kista Dan. The first recorded landing in the area was made on 5 February 1955 on Lichen Island by a sledging party led by Phillip Law. Further aerial photography was undertaken by ANARE from 1957 to 1960, with the first recorded visit to the bay taking place in August 1957 by a surveying party from Davis Station. During the return flight the area was photographed and named Amanda Bay after the newly-born daughter of the pilot, RAAF Squadron Leader Peter Clemence.|$|E
