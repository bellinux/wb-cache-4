40|$|<b>The</b> <b>test</b> program {{developing}} {{parachutes for}} the Orion/MPCV includes drop tests with parachutes deployed from an Orion-like parachute compartment at {{a wide range}} of dynamic pressures. Aircraft and altitude constraints precluded the use of an Orion boilerplate capsule for several test points. Therefore, a dart-shaped <b>test</b> <b>vehicle</b> with a hi-fidelity mock-up of the Orion parachute compartment has been developed. The available aircraft options imposed constraints on <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>vehicle</b> development and concept of operations. Delivery of this <b>test</b> <b>vehicle</b> to <b>the</b> desired velocity, altitude, and orientation required for <b>the</b> <b>test</b> is a di cult problem involving multiple engineering disciplines.

The desired separation behavior is achieved by precisely controlling the release point using on-board monitoring of the motion. The design of <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>vehicle</b> is also described. The trajectory simulations and other analyses used to develop this technique and predict the behavior of <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>vehicle</b> are reviewed in detail.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an experimental platform for <b>the</b> demonstration and <b>testing</b> of autonomous lane keeping and pedestrian avoidance {{through the use}} of a <b>test</b> <b>vehicle</b> equipped with an Xbox Kinect 2. 0 for vision-?based detection. <b>The</b> <b>test</b> <b>vehicle</b> is a 1 / 5 th-?scale electric remote control car customized for autonomous steering and drive motor control {{through the use of}} an Arduino Mega 2560. A proportional derivative (PD) steering controller running on the Arduino receives position commands from a laptop via serial communication. These commands are generated on the laptop based on an analysis of images captured from the Kinect. On the laptop, the program, Processing, is used to identify the colored boundaries of the path the vehicle is traveling, calculate the position of the center of that path, find the position error of <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>vehicle</b> relative to <b>the</b> center of the path, and then send that error to the Arduino to calculate a corrective steering command. In addition to lane keeping, <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>vehicle</b> is capable of pedestrian detection and avoidance through the use of body tracking libraries written for the Kinect in Processing. Once a human body is detected and tracked, the position of each foot is checked relative to the boundaries of the path. If the pedestrian is located inside of the path boundaries, then <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>vehicle</b> stops and waits for the person to leave the path. The PD controller for the steering servo was tuned empirically, and after tuning, the vehicle was consistently able to autonomously navigate a curved path of variable width with an error of less than 75 pixels (5 cm). The pedestrian-?avoidance algorithm worked successfully in conjunction with the lane keeping algorithm. However, the body tracking libraries for the Kinect demonstrated a 40 % failure rate for body detection when <b>the</b> <b>test</b> <b>vehicle</b> and <b>the</b> Kinect were in motion...|$|R

40|$|An {{open-source}} <b>vehicle</b> <b>testbed</b> {{to enable}} <b>the</b> exploration of automation technologies for road vehicles is presented. The platform hardware and software, {{based on the}} Robot Operating System (ROS), are detailed.

The first approach used digital filtering of Controller Area Network (CAN) messages.
