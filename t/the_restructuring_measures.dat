40|$|The Korean {{government}} {{adopted the}} modified London approach for <b>the</b> <b>restructuring</b> following <b>the</b> crisis. While <b>restructuring</b> <b>measures</b> include vitalising <b>the</b> market force, {{the relationship between}} banks and business groups has shifted more toward the Japanese bank-led system and subsequently the ex ante required banks' business group monitoring has increased, due mainly to ownership and contractual effects of recapitalised bank-led chaebols restructuring. However, ex post effectiveness of banks' business group monitoring from this short term shift will be constrained by challenging issues, such as snow-balling nonperforming loan and business uncertainties in the banking sector, limited feasibility and lack of incentive to monitor. Other factors affecting corporate-bank relationship include degree of diversification of corporate financing, coupled with capital market development and financial market liberalisation, an improved corporate governance mechanism and ad hoc change in government's bank ownership and banks' business group ownership given cultural factors. While stylised scenarios of this business group monitoring are divided into government-led centralised, bank-led relationship orientation, and market-led arm's length, actual evolution of this mechanism in Korea depends on {{the relative importance of}} the current constraining factors, as well as the various mid-to-long term determining factors discussed in the paper.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{a sample}} of 72 firms listed on the Italian Stock Exchange between 2007 and 2011 which were in serious economic difficulty. These companies adopted a series of measures {{to find a way}} out of the crisis, including management changes, divestment of assets, debt <b>restructuring</b> and <b>the</b> issuing of new shares. The paper aims to verify the existence of a preference order for responses to the economic crisis. Unlike previous research, a methodology has been adopted which analyses the content of the Management Commentary in order to identify both the proposals presented by managers and the measures actually adopted. The result of the analysis shows that the different types of measures to solve the crisis are often proposed and/or realized in a combined manner. Although the existence of a pecking order is not immediately obvious, a preference for management changes seems to emerge, whereas debt renegotiation and the issuing of new shares appear to be used only as secondary responses. Furthermore, based on the results of the logistic regression model, this paper suggests that the reasons for choosing <b>the</b> types of <b>restructuring</b> <b>measures</b> appears to be mainly related to their profitability. Managers of low profitability firms intervene most frequently on the capital structure rather than adopting general management changes and divestment plans. This result is consistent with the Pecking order theory which deals with the hierarchy of funding sources followed by firms...|$|R

40|$|Banking crises are {{typically}} followed by bank restructuring, which is launched by regulators {{and designed to}} help recovery. During the last two decades, more than {{two thirds of the}} banking crises around the world took place in developing countries. However, there is no formal study to date that attempts to systematically analyse the impact of <b>the</b> post-crisis <b>restructuring</b> on <b>the</b> banking systems of such countries. This thesis investigates whether <b>the</b> post-crisis <b>restructuring</b> enhances <b>the</b> efficiency of banks in developing countries. The focus is on <b>restructuring</b> <b>measures</b> related to bank ownership, environmental factors, and to measure relative bank efficiency using frontier approaches. The results indicate that although <b>the</b> <b>restructuring</b> does not enhance the efficiency of entire banking systems, on average, <b>the</b> efficiency of <b>restructured</b> banks gradually improves after <b>the</b> implementation of <b>restructuring.</b> <b>The</b> results reveal domestic-merged banks to be more cost and technically efficient during the post-crisis period, whereas allowing for foreign bank entry does not produce more efficient banks as was expected. In line with the literature, banks under state intervention are found to be less efficient than those not subject to intervention banks. The results from the productivity analysis suggest that, on average, there is little improvement. Although Asian banks experienced an improvement in technical efficiency, this was partially offset by a contraction in their technology. Nonetheless, the total productivity of <b>the</b> <b>restructured</b> banks increased gradually and stood at a higher level than when the crisis emerged. This thesis also examines the potential influence of country-specific factors. The results indicate that country-specific conditions {{play a significant role in}} bank efficiency measurement. High interest rates and concentrated markets appear to be unfavourable influences on bank efficiency. The positive association between the overall level of economic development and inefficiency contradicts findings from studies on western countries. The results also indicate that levels of efficiency estimated from various frontier techniques are not comparable in terms of average efficiency scores. However, some similarities in implied rankings have been found. Finally, the directions of efficiency scores estimated by the frontier techniques are consistent with traditional measures of performance, although the correlations are not strong. In summary, this thesis provides useful guidelines for bank regulators in terms of <b>the</b> effectiveness of <b>restructuring</b> policies implemented following a banking crisis. The results from this thesis reveal that <b>the</b> effects of <b>restructuring</b> on bank efficiency are relatively low compared to the influences of macro-economic factors. Consequently, in order to deal with future potential crises, local and international bank regulators should put more emphasis on macro-economic policies...|$|R
40|$|Urban {{restructuring}} {{takes place}} in numerous cities in Western European countries, often {{in the form of}} the demolition of relatively cheap dwellings and replacement by new, more expensive dwellings. This phenomenon has been studied extensively. Especially the effects of urban <b>restructuring</b> on <b>the</b> <b>restructured</b> areas themselves have been examined. Much less is known about the residents that had to relocate because of urban <b>restructuring</b> <b>measures</b> like demolition and intensive renovation. This paper therefore focuses on the question whether and why residents improve their housing situation. Using data from four Dutch cities we first make clear how the old and new housing situation differ by focusing both on objective and evaluated changes. Then, explanations are offered for the extent to which residents do or do not experience changes, with respect to dwelling as well as neighbourhood aspects. We found that (a) displaced residents both experience objective and evaluated improvements of their housing situation; (b) that in contrast to objective improvements, evaluated improvements are hardly related to individual and household characteristics; (c) evaluated improvements can be attributed to improved characteristics of the dwelling and neighbourhood; and (d) that increased satisfaction with the dwelling and neighbourhood are strongly related...|$|R
