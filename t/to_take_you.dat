25|$|In Tulgao or Sumadel, {{you need}} to {{negotiate}} to find a local guide willing <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> to the Sugo-oc fumarole field. The trek from the village to the fumarole field is steep, difficult, at higher elevation, along carabao (water buffalo) tracks. As of 2008, tourists do not visit Sugo-oc and special arrangements need to be made. There is no western style accommodation in the villages of Tulgao or Sumadel, and no accommodation at all at Sugo-oc. There is a little used foot track from Sumadel to the plateau on the southern flank of Binuluan but requires some months of planning and negotiation and {{a high level of}} fitness.|$|E

Alight at Balatoc drop-off {{and walk}} towards the village of Balatoc to see the Bu-ot fumarole field along the way, and the orange-yellow stained rocks of the Pasil River. At Balatoc, {{you might be able}} to arrange a local guide <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> to Bum-bag fumarole firld. Most of the walk is on tribal lands or private property. Walk from Balatoc to Bum-bag is only for the fit and takes about 5 hours one way. There are no accommodations near Bum-bag fumarole field although there are some very basic huts at the Bum-bag rice terraces. Bum-bag fields are located on private property and permission is required from the owner.|$|E
500|$|Pinkner and Wyman {{revealed}} {{in a conference}} call interview that the episode was the [...] "culmination of {{a lot of things that}} [...] had been working on for quite a while". Though they loved all of their episodes, the two stated that [...] "Entrada" [...] was a particular favorite of theirs, with Pinker elaborating that [...] "if the only episode of Fringe you ever tune into watch is this one, sure, it’s going <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> five minutes to catch up, but you will feel what’s going on, and you will understand the relationships... a great entry point". The producers considered making [...] "Entrada" [...] the mid-season finale, but instead selected [...] "Marionette", the following week's episode.|$|E

500|$|After {{watching}} {{the first several}} episodes of season three, Aaron Riccio of Slant Magazine gave the show 3.5/4 stars, and praised it for making a [...] "huge, game-changing step forward". He continued that [...] "Hard science meets soft comedy, {{and the results are}} consistently surprising and rarely disappointing. The solid mythology and high stakes keep the series moving as forward as quickly as FlashForward and The Event, but the dual tones of the two worlds offer considerably more breadth in the stories it tells... captivating television". Robert Bianco from USA Today praised Torv, Noble, and Jackson's performances. He however disliked the new plotline of two Olivias, explaining [...] "It's hard to fault the execution of the first two episodes, which skillfully set up Fringe's two competing universes and two misplaced Olivias... Yet well-done isn't the same as welcome. I'm not giving up on the show, which was one of last year's best. But I don't want to spend weeks watching our Olivia suffer and their Olivia make Walter and Peter suffer. You have to give writers leeway <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> where they want to go — but at a certain point, commercial entertainment has to be entertaining, or there's no reason to watch".|$|E
500|$|In 1969, the Revue's {{profile in}} their home country was raised after opening for the Rolling Stones on their US tour. In 1970, they {{performed}} on The Ed Sullivan Show. The tour's success resulted in the Revue signing with Liberty Records, where they released two albums, Come Together and Workin' Together, released in 1970 and 1971 respectively. Come Together produced the duo's first top 40 single with their cover of Sly and the Family Stone's [...] "I Want <b>to</b> <b>Take</b> <b>You</b> Higher." [...] Come Together marked {{a turning point in}} their careers in which they switched from their usual R repertoire to incorporate more rock tunes. In early 1971, their cover of Creedence Clearwater Revival's [...] "Proud Mary" [...] became their biggest hit, reaching number 4 on the Hot 100 and selling over a million copies, winning them a Grammy for Best R Performance by a Duo or Group. Later in 1971, their live album, What You Hear Is What You Get, taken from a performance at Carnegie Hall, was their first to be certified gold. In 1972, Ike Turner created the studio, Bolic Sounds, near their home in Inglewood. After Liberty was bought by United Artists Records, the duo was assigned to that label, releasing ten albums in a three-year period. The duo's final major hit single, [...] "Nutbush City Limits", was released in 1973, reaching number 22 on the Hot 100, and peaking at number 4 in the UK. In 1974, Tina released her first solo album, Tina Turns the Country On!, winning a Grammy nomination.|$|E

Mansell Upham, a researcher and jurist specializing in South African colonial history also helped spur the movement to bring Baartman's remains back to South Africa.
