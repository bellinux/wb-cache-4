5|$|Glass beads for {{jewellery}} {{have traditionally}} been made in Hebron. Blue beads and glass beads with 'eyes' (owayneh) were made for use as amulets since they were considered particularly effective against the evil-eye. In the Museum of Mankind collections, there exist several glass necklaces that were made in Hebron during the Mandate period or earlier. Besides necklaces made of blue and green beads, and 'eyes' beads, there are examples of beads of small hands, also called a Hamsa, representing the hand of Fatimah, the daughter of <b>the</b> <b>prophet</b> <b>Muhammad.</b> Most of a woman's jewellery was given to her at marriage; in the early 1920s, in Bayt Dajan, a glass bracelet (ghwayshat) made in Hebron {{would be considered a}} necessary part of the jewellery of a bride's trousseau.|$|E
5|$|In Islamic tradition, Bayt Jibrin is {{the burial}} {{place of the}} sahaba (companion) of <b>the</b> <b>prophet</b> <b>Muhammad,</b> Tamim al-Dari, who was famously known for his piety and briefly served as the Governor of Jerusalem in the late 7th century. Al-Dari {{and his family were}} granted {{trusteeship}} over the Hebron Hills, including Bayt Jibrin, and were assigned as the supervisors of the Cave of the Patriarchs (Ibrahimi Mosque) in Hebron. His sanctuary is the most venerated site in Bayt Jibrin, located just northwest of it. Until the present day, al-Dari's sanctuary has been a place of local Muslim pilgrimage. Other Islamic holy sites in the village include Maqam (shrine) for a local shaykh named Mahmud and a tomb for a shaykha (female religious figure) named Ameina.|$|E
5|$|The {{stone was}} venerated at the Kaaba in pre-Islamic pagan times. According to Islamic tradition, {{it was set}} intact into the Kaaba's wall by <b>the</b> <b>prophet</b> <b>Muhammad</b> in the year 605 AD, five years before his first revelation. Since then it has been broken {{into a number of}} {{fragments}} and is now cemented into a silver frame {{in the side of the}} Kaaba. Its physical appearance is that of a fragmented dark rock, polished smooth by the hands of pilgrims. Islamic tradition holds that it fell from heaven as a guide for Adam and Eve to build an altar. It has often been described as a meteorite, a hypothesis which is now uncertain.|$|E
40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this thesis is to offer an {{approach}} to building a culture of leadership based on <b>the</b> <b>Prophet</b> <b>Muhammad's</b> teaching of love in Islamic schools. Since people are strongly motivated by values they deeply adhere to, the paradigms used as rationale for this study embody views of leaders as motivators and values transformation as their main task. The thesis holds the view that <b>the</b> <b>Prophet</b> <b>Muhammad's</b> teaching of love needs to be cultivated in an Islamic school community. The thesis presents discussion on transrational values as the contributing factor to this view, and the main argument centres on the discussions of <b>the</b> <b>Prophet</b> <b>Muhammad's</b> teaching of love and its applications in developing a culture of leadership in Islamic schools...|$|R

5|$|The rebels, {{who were}} joined {{by some of the}} city's poorer Muslim {{residents}}, began to loot the homes of Egyptian officers. In response, some 500 Egyptian troops left the citadel to pursue the rebels, but began to loot homes in the city as well in revenge before Rashad Bey ordered them to cease. Fifty rebels, sixteen residents and five soldiers were killed in the confrontations of 20 May. On 21 May, the rebels attacked the city again and after a brief counterattack, Rashad Bey and his men returned to the citadel. Afterward, residents sympathetic to the revolt opened the Damascus Gate and 2,000 peasant irregulars from Nablus entered the city to reinforce the rebels, whose numbers in Jerusalem then reached some 20,000. On that same day, but prior to the rebels' entry, Rashad Bey's troops had arrested Jerusalem's leading notables, including the mufti (leading Islamic scholar) Tahir Effendi al-Husayni, the leading ashraf (locally honored descendants of <b>the</b> <b>prophet</b> <b>Muhammad)</b> Umar Effendi al-Husayni and Muhammad al-Khalidi, and others. When the reinforcements from Nablus arrived, Egyptian troops withdrew further into the citadel, and Jerusalem was all but captured.|$|E
