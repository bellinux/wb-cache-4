40|$|Introduction: Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) causes {{recurrent}} and debilitating {{infections and}} {{has been linked to}} mortality in neonates and immunocompromised individuals with increased susceptibility to HIV infection. In this study we examined the protection generated by a liposomal tripeptide epitope vaccine (L-gD 3 pep-HD) containing the TLR 4 adjuvant, Monophosphoryl Lipid A (MPL) or the adjuvant <b>Tucaresol.</b> Methods: Vaccines were administered subcutaneously to BALB/c female mice on d 0, d 28, and d 56 with gD 3 pep-HD (5 or 10 ug/dose), <b>Tucaresol</b> (5. 6 ug/dose), MPL (15 ug/dose), and/or PBS (n= 17 /group). Mice (n= 10 /group) were given Medroxyprogesterone on D 63 and 69 to enhance virus infectivity and challenged with HSV- 2 on d 70; vaginal swabs were collected on d 72 for viral burden and mice were monitored for morbidity 2 x/day to d 98. Results: Mice vaccinated with L-gD 3 pep-HD without adjuvants (80 % survival) or with MPL (100 % survival) or <b>Tucaresol</b> (60 % survival) were significantly more protected vs PBS control (0 % survival), p< 0. 006. Weight loss, mucosal, and neurological scores paralleled survival with L-gD 3 pep-HD+MPL or <b>Tucaresol</b> or L-gD 3 alone providing the most protection. The mice vaccinated with L-gD 3 +MPL also showed significantly less viral burden vs all other groups, p< 0. 0213. Conclusions: The liposomal gD 3 pep vaccines containing the protein alone or with the addition of an adjuvant, provided enhanced survival in BALB/c mice against HSV- 2 intravaginal infection. Liposomal vaccines with <b>Tucaresol</b> alone and no protein provided minimal protection. Bacterial MPL at 15 ug/dose was the most effective adjuvant when used in a liposomal gD 3 pep vaccine...|$|E
40|$|Although plasmid DNA (pDNA) -based {{immunization}} {{has proven}} efficacy, {{the level of}} immune responses that is achieved by this route of vaccination is often lower than that induced by traditional vaccines, especially for primates and humans. We report here a simple and potent method to enhance pDNA-based vaccination by using two different plasmids encoding viral or bacterial antigens. This method is based on coadministration of low concentrations of a recently described immunopotentiating, Schiff base-forming drug called <b>tucaresol</b> {{which has led to}} significant augmentation of antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses. Our data suggest that enhancement of the immune response with <b>tucaresol</b> might provide a powerful tool for the further development of pDNA-based immunization for humans...|$|E
40|$|In {{addition}} to macromolecular interactions that provide co-stimulation during antigen-presenting cell (APC) and CD 4 + T-cell conjugation, covalent chemical events between specialized ligands have {{been implicated in}} T-cell co-stimulation. These {{take the form of}} transient Schiff base formation between carbonyls and amines expressed on APC and T-cell surfaces. Small Schiff base-forming molecules, such as <b>tucaresol,</b> can substitute for the physiological donor of carbonyl groups and provide co-stimulation to T cells, thereby functioning as orally active immunopotentiatory drugs. The Schiff base co-stimulatory pathway in T cells has been partially characterized in terms of changes in Na+ and K+ transport, and activation of the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) ERK 2. In the present study, the effects of Schiff base co-stimulation by <b>tucaresol</b> on the T-cell receptor (TCR) -dependent pathway leading to Ca 2 + release were investigated. Schiff base co-stimulation by <b>tucaresol</b> was found to prime for enhanced TCR-dependent phospholipase C-γ phosphorylation, inositol 1, 4, 5 -triphosphate production, and Ca 2 + mobilization that correlated with functional enhancement of interleukin- 2 production in primary T cells. The effects on Ca 2 + occurred comparably in Jurkat and primary CD 4 + T cells responding to anti-CD 3 monoclonal antibody. Enhancement of the Ca 2 + response required a 10 -min priming period and was prevented by prior covalent ligation of cell-surface free amino groups by sulpho-N-hydroxy succinimido-biotin; clofilium-mediated inhibition of tucaresol-induced changes in intracellular K+; and selective inhibition of the MAPK pathway. The data are consistent with a priming mechanism in which late co-stimulation-triggered events exert a positive influence on early TCR-triggered events. In additional studies of murine T cells expressing trans-gene TCRs, <b>tucaresol</b> was likewise shown to prime for enhanced Ca 2 + mobilization in response to physiological TCR-engagement by MHC–peptide complexes...|$|E
40|$|Effective {{vaccination}} against heterologous {{influenza virus}} infection remains elusive. Immunization with plasmid DNA (pDNA) expressing conserved genes from influenza virus is a promising approach to achieve cross-variant protection. However, despite having been described {{for more than}} a decade, pDNA vaccination still requires further optimization to be applied clinically as a standard vaccination approach. We have recently described a simple and efficient approach to enhance pDNA immunization, based on the use of <b>tucaresol,</b> a Schiff base-forming drug. In this report we have tested the ability of this drug to increase the protection conferred by pDNA vaccination against influenza virus infection. Our results demonstrate that a significant protection was achieved in two strains of mice by using the combination of pDNA and <b>tucaresol.</b> This protection was associated with an elevated humoral and cellular response and a switch in the type of the T helper cell (Th) immune response from type 2 to type 1. This vaccine combination represents a promising strategy for designing a clinical study for the protection from influenza and similar infections...|$|E

40|$|<b>Tucaresol,</b> a novel immunomodulator, was {{inactive}} against Leishmania donovani amastigotes in both peritoneal {{and bone}} marrow macrophages in vitro at concentrations between 100 and 1 μM, with toxicity to macrophages and parasites at 300 μM. However, against L. donovani in BALB/c mice at doses between 80 and 1. 25 mg/kg {{of body weight}} administered once daily by the oral route during days 7 to 11 of infection, an optimal dose of 5 mg/kg produced a 43. 8 to 62. 4 % suppression of liver amastigotes, with significantly reduced activity at the extremes of the dose range. This response {{was not related to}} levels of infection. No interaction with the standard pentavalent antimonial sodium stibogluconate (Pentostam) was observed during this period of infection. The optimum dose of 5 mg/kg was ineffective when administered {{during the first week of}} infection and was most effective against the liver infection when administered during weeks 2 to 3 of infection (42. 3 to 46. 8 % inhibition) and against the splenic infection when administered during week 6 of infection (59. 5 % inhibition). The optimum dose of <b>tucaresol</b> against L. donovani in C 57 BL/ 6 mice was 5 mg/kg, which produced a 40. 8 to 48. 7 % suppression of liver amastigotes when administered in a range of 80 to 1. 25 mg/kg during days 7 to 11 of infection.

40|$|Mycobacteria can infect macrophages and {{dendritic}} cells (DC), {{where they}} reside inside the endosomal compartment. The importance of CD 4 + T cells in protective immunity against mycobacteria and other intracellular pathogens is well established, {{and for a}} long time these cells were thought to be the major defense in controlling an infection. Lately, several reports have shown that also cytotoxic CD 8 + T cells contribute to protective immunity. Heat shock proteins (lisp) are highly conserved molecules that have been shown to contain important antigens both for B and T cell mediated immune responses against several infections. Studies have indicated that in vivo expression of the hsp 65 gene from M. leprae could induce protection against live bacterial challenge with M. tuberculosis. CD 8 + T cells could confer the observed hsp 65 induced protection. We studied an immunization approach where plasmids encoding mycobacterial hsp 65 (Mhsp 65) were injected intramuscularly in mice to evaluate the resultant immune response following in vivo transcription of the immunogen. This mode of immunization is associated with efficient CD 8 + T cell priming and the generation of a T helper I (Th 1) type of immune response. Genetic vaccination further offers possibilities to manipulate the quality of the induced immune responses. We showed that the immune response could be efficiently enhanced after co-administration of either a Schiff base forming drug, <b>tucaresol,</b> or by plasmids encoding the cytokines interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) or granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Among these, <b>tucaresol</b> had the most prominent effect, resulting in a general enhancement of the immune responses in our studies. This makes <b>tucaresol</b> a potent and interesting adjuvant candidate for plasmid DNA immunization. Human antigenic epitopes can be evaluated in mice expressing transgenes for human HLA complexes, since antigen processing and presentation is similar in mouse and man. We concluded that Mhsp 65 plasmid injection results in human HLA class I and II restricted antigen presentation, and a subsequent priming of CD 8 + and CD 4 + T cells in HLA transgenic mice. We did also investigate CD 8 + T cells with specificity for Mhsp 65. This was studied by the identification of human I-ILA class I restricted cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes encoded within Mhsp 65. One of the identified epitopes, Mhsp 659 - 369, is conserved within hsp 65 from several human pathogens. Our results revealed that Mhsp 659 - 369 could be processed and presented in the context of HLA-A* 0201 during both Salmonella and mycobacterial infections. Several additional pathogens have this conserved epitope. These results suggested that T cells primed during infections may recognize conserved pathogen-associated epitopes, thereby conferring protection to unrelated pathogens. In summary, DNA vaccines have the potential to induce protection against intracellular pathogens like M. tuberculosis, where Mhsp 65 fulfills the criteria to be an efficient antigen. The use of defined epitopes can ftirther restrict the immune responses...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} among CCR 5 genotype, cytomegalovirus infection, {{and disease progression}} and death was studied among 159 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) –infected patients with hemophilia. One patient (0. 6 %) had the CCR 5 D 32 /CCR 5 D 32 genotype (which occurs in ∼ 2 % of the Scandinavian population) and a rapid disease course. His HIV V 3 region contained genotypic features attributable to X 4 virus and resembled functionally verified X 4 virus and virus from patients treated with a CD 4 cell–stimulating drug, <b>tucaresol.</b> Age-related dif-ferences in disease progression rate and survival time were seen for CCR 5 /CCR 5 patients. Surprisingly, no protective effect of the CCR 5 /CCR 5 D 32 genotype on disease progression or survival was seen for children but was evident for adults. Age group–related immunologic differences might explain this variation, and transmission route and/or viral phenotype variation within donor virus {{may be related to}} the limited protection of the CCR 5 D 32 /CCR 5 D 32 genotype. Sequence comparisons indicate that X 4 virus can be selected in vivo due to either absence of CCR 5 receptors or relative increase of CXCR 4 receptors. Other than CD 4, several receptors among the group of 7 -membrane G protein–coupled chemokine receptors have been demonstrated to be essential to human im...|$|E
40|$|Annually {{more than}} 20 million deaths are {{globally}} caused because of infections or cancer. This accounts for 41. 5 % of annual deaths. New techniques {{are supposed to}} constitute our tools {{in the fight against}} these types of deaths. The new technologies of immune and gene therapies promise to revolutionize medicine in the next century. Active immune and gene therapies include both non-specific (such as cytokines and synthetic chemicals) and specific (i. e. vaccination) approaches. Cytokines when delivered by genetic approaches to tumors were reported to affect their capacity to present antigens and to act as targets for natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T cells (CTL). In the first part of my thesis, I have studied the mechanism by which the cytokine interleukin- 10 (IL- 10) alters tumor cell sensitivity to NK and CTL mediated cytotoxicity and affects MHC class I antigen presentation in particular peptide transportation by the transporter associated with antigen presentation (TAP). The delivery of a gene in a suitable expression plasmid to cells in vivo allows the immune system to recognize its product leading to protective immunity against infectious agents or tumors, a process termed plasmid DNA (pDNA) vaccination. In the second part of my thesis I have studied pDNA vaccination and methods to improve this mode of immunization by cytokine genes and by <b>tucaresol</b> a Schiff forming drug. To this end, I have established two clinically relevant animal models. In one, a gene from the tumor associated Epsteine Bar virus (EBV) nuclear antigen 4 (EBNA- 4) gene was used, while in the other, the mycobacterial heat-shock protein 65 (Mhsp 65) was tested as a pDNA vaccine. In these two models I analyzed the cytokine genes interferon gamma (IFN-[gamma]) and granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) for their ability to enhance pDNA induced immune responses. In the same models I also tested the effect of the novel immune response modifying adjuvant, <b>tucaresol.</b> In this part of my thesis I have also established the possibility of using HER- 2 based immunotherapy for the treatment of human tumors overexpressing this gene product. These studies have provided three candidate genes (EBNA- 4, Mhsp 65 and HER- 2), Peptides, cytokines and adjuvant {{that could be used for}} vaccination or to treat patients against cancer and viral and bacterial diseases. pDNA or peptide vaccines based on these could lead to protection from a large range of diseases including tuberculosis, leprosy, typhoid fever, brucellosis, infectious mononucleosis, EBV associated tumors, carcinomas and melanoma. I have shown that cytokines and adjuvants could be used to efficiently enhance the immune response to pDNA vaccines resulting in full protection from tumor outgrowth. An insight into the mechanism by which IL- 10 modulates the immune response was presented. I have been able to show how IL- 10 affects the MHC-I antigen-processing pathway resulting in alteration of NK and CTL responses...|$|E
40|$|For centuries {{infectious}} diseases {{have been one}} of the main causes of death in the world. With the invention of vaccine technology 200 years ago, we have been able to impede and even eradicate several dangerous pathogens. However, even with the success of modern vaccine technology, there are several diseases for which there are no effective vaccines. Cancer is the second main cause of death in the western world; where conventional treatments can cure a majority of patients, there is still no treatment for several malignancies. Thus, there is a need to develop alternative therapies to be able to salvage those patients who cannot be helped with standard therapy. One such strategy is immunotherapy - wherein specific antibodies and T-lymphocytes are raised against antigens overexpressed on the surface of the tumors by immunization. Conventional vaccines have shortcomings with regard to safety and efficacy. An alternative method is to use DNA that encodes for an antigen in a circular ring (plasmid) and injecting the DNA directly into a patient. The DNA is then taken up by cells in the body, producing the antigen in vivo. This methodology is important since it ensures not only long lasting expression of the antigen to continuously boost the immune system, but more importantly, it facilitates the proper processing of the antigen and presentation by the antigen presenting machinery. DNA vaccines have been able to induce immunity in both mice and men to wide selections of pathogens and tumors. However, due to low efficacy of DNA vaccines, the clinical effects have been limited and survival not significantly improved. This is despite sometimes-impressive demonstration of T and B cell responses in vitro. Clearly DNA vaccines must be improved for this therapeutic strategy to have a clinical relevance. In this thesis, I have described different ways to enhance the effect of DNA vaccines, focusing on the induction of T cell mediated immunity in three different ways. Protein Transduction Domains, PTD, are short alkaline peptide segments which when fused to an epitope (small antigenic peptide) can transfer the epitope across the plasma membrane barrier. We have shown that mice immunized with PTD-epitope DNA vaccines demonstrate increased survival to a lethal infection of Lymphocyte Choriomeningitis Virus (LCMV). Furthermore, we prove that this mechanism is proteosome dependent and mediated by TAP, indicating that the effect is mediated through the normal MHC class I pathway. Protection was associated with high CD 8 + T cell precursor frequency. Another mechanism by which immunity can be enhanced is by activating the secondary signal. This is usually done through a reversible covalent binding known as Schiff-base formation. Other amine donors in the form of a drug can mimic such Schiff base formation. <b>Tucaresol</b> is such a Schiff base-forming drug, which we tested in an influenza mouse model. We could see that survival was increased with the addition of <b>Tucaresol</b> and this was associated with higher CTL specific killing of influenza peptide pulsed target cells. An attempt has also been made in this thesis to delineate the components of the immune system that are employed in efficient clearing of pathogens or malignant cells. The model that was employed was that of HER- 2 /neu overexpressing tumors. HER- 2 /neu is a tumor-associated antigen that is overexpressed in 20 - 30 % of all breast and ovarian carcinomas. It is expressed at very low levels or is absent in normal cells, and its overexpression in malignancies is associated with poor prognosis, thus making it an attractive target for immune therapy. Conflicting results exist regarding the role of antibodies versus T cell mediated immunity in HER- 2 based immune therapy. In order to investigate this we employed B cell deficient mice, which lack the ability to produce antibodies as well as depletion of CD 8 + and/or CD 4 + subsets of T cells. We were able to demonstrate that immunity to a lethal challenge of tumor cells was the results of HER- 2 specific T cells in the absence of antibodies. The immunity was furthermore dependent on helper T cells and their ability to produce the cytokine IFN-ã during the effector phase of the immune response. We were also able to prove that specific immunity could only be induced on co-administration of a plasmid encoding the cytokine GM-CSF. This thesis also investigates the use of Virus-Like Particles (VLPs) as carriers of HER- 2 antigen. A fusion protein consisting of the Vp 2 of Murine Polyoma Virus (MyPV) with the extracellular and transmembrane domains of HER- 2 neu were encapsulated by Vp 1 protein from MyPV. We show that a single injection of HER- 2 containing VLPs can protect from tumor challenge and tumor outgrowth in a transgenic mouse model. In summary, the efficacy of DNA vaccines can be augmented by several means; protective and therapeutic effects appear to be associated with potent T cell mediated immune responses, a lesson which can be taken to the clinic...|$|E
