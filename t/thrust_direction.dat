In this study we present new images obtained from deep seismic reflection profiling in the Eastern Alps between Munich and Venice which give rise to examine and revise existing concepts. The seismic sections exhibit a prominent bi-verging reflection pattern at crustal scale. A major ramp-like structure, outcropping at the Inn-Valley fault, can be traced southward over 80 km into the mountain root where relics of the subducted Penninic ocean are expected.

50|$|The {{electric}} sail probably {{cannot be}} used inside planetary magnetospheres because the solar wind does not penetrate them, allowing only slower plasma flows and magnetic fields. While modest variation of the <b>thrust</b> <b>direction</b> {{can be achieved by}} inclining the sail, the thrust vector always points more or less radially outward from the Sun. It has been estimated that maximum operational inclination would be 60°, resulting in a thrusting angle of 30° from the outward radial direction.|$|E
50|$|A de Laval nozzle (or convergent-divergent nozzle, CD nozzle or con-di nozzle) is a {{tube that}} is pinched in the middle, making a {{carefully}} balanced, asymmetric hourglass shape. It {{is used to}} accelerate a hot, pressurized gas passing through it to a higher supersonic speed in the axial (<b>thrust)</b> <b>direction,</b> by converting the heat energy of the flow into kinetic energy.

High levels of main rotor retreating side blade-vortex interaction noise are shown to radiate downstream of the model. The isolated tail rotor noise results show the dominance of harmonic noise in the <b>thrusting</b> <b>direction.</b> The occurrence of tail rotor broadband noise is seen by the broadening of the tail rotor harmonics and is attributed to fuselage wake turbulence.

5000|$|An L-drive {{is a type}} of azimuth {{thruster}} {{where the}} electric motor is mounted vertically, removing the second bevel gear from the drivetrain. Azimuth thruster pods can be rotated through a full 360 degrees, allowing for rapid changes in <b>thrust</b> <b>direction</b> and eliminating the need for a conventional rudder. This form of power transmission is called a L-drive because the rotary motion has to make one right angle turn, thus looking a bit like the letter [...] "L". This name is used to make clear the arrangement of drive is different from Z-drive.|$|E
50|$|Cyclorotors {{provide a}} high degree of control. Traditional propellers, rotors, and jet engines produce thrust only along their axis of {{rotation}} and require rotation of the entire device to alter the <b>thrust</b> <b>direction.</b> This rotation requires large forces and comparatively long time scales since the propeller inertia is considerable, and the rotor gyroscopic forces resist rotation. For many practical applications (helicopters, airplanes, ships) this requires rotating the entire vessel. In contrast, cyclorotors need only to vary the blade pitch motions. Since there is little inertia associated with blade pitch change, thrust vectoring in the plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation is rapid.|$|E

A set of orbit elements, {{known as the}} equinoctial elements, are selected as the state variables. The uncertainties are modelled statistically by random vector and stochastic processes. The motion of the vehicle and the measurements are described by nonlinear stochastic differential and difference equations respectively. A minimum time nominal trajectory is defined and the equation of motion and the measurement equation are linearized about this nominal trajectory. An exponential cost criterion is constructed and a linear feedback guidance law is derived to control the <b>thrusting</b> <b>direction</b> of the engine. Using this guidance law, the vehicle will fly in a trajectory neighboring the nominal trajectory. The extended Kalman filter is used for state estimation. Finally a short mission using this system is simulated. The results indicate that this system is very efficient for short missions...|$|R

50|$|The {{demand for}} {{increasing}} power ratings could first be answered with larger rudderpropellers. Limits {{were set to}} this trend by mechanical stress {{and the fact that}} with an increasing propeller diameter, the draft of the vessel inevitably increases. Schottel therefore developed a thruster where the required power is divided between two counter-rotating thrusters that share a single shaft. The Twin Propeller is equipped with a pull propeller and a push propeller. The vortex street of the front pull propeller passes between the blades of the rear push propeller without impeding it. Contraction of the slip stream in the pull propeller means that more water reaches the push propeller from the sides. The strut is equipped with a fin, thus the swirl energy generated in the propeller stream is recovered. Additionally, the flow around the fins creates a lift component in the <b>thrust</b> <b>direction,</b> which has a thrust-enhancing effect.|$|E

Dawn successfully completed its orbital mission at Vesta. The Dawn spacecraft has complex, difficult to quantify, {{and in some cases}} severe limitations on its attitude agility. The low-thrust transfers between science orbits at Vesta required very complex time varying thrust directions due to the strong and complex gravity and various science objectives. Traditional low-thrust design objectives (like minimum change in velocity or minimum transfer time) often result in <b>thrust</b> <b>direction</b> time evolutions that cannot be accommodated with the attitude control system available on Dawn.

40|$|The ElectroDynamic Delivery Express (EDDE) is an {{autonomous}} space vehicle that can maneuver throughout {{low earth orbit}} without using fuel. EDDE uses solar power to drive multi-ampere currents through a kilometers-long aluminum conductor, creating a force normal to both the conductor and the local magnetic field that drives the space vehicle. The tether spins at about 8 times/orbit. This stabilizes its dynamics and also allows {{a wider range of}} electrodynamic <b>thrust</b> <b>directions</b> as it spins. The current circuit is closed through the ambient plasma around the conductor. To provide complete control of the orbit, the high-voltage current must be switched repeatedly {{as a function of the}} orbital position, to modulate the force on the conductor. This paper describes our solution to this power switching and control problem. Arcing from the conductor to the ambient plasma is a potentially serious problem. To reduce the possibility of arcing, the solar arrays are distributed along the conductor length to reduce the peak potential between the conductor and the local plasma. If arcing does start, it can be quenched by electrically isolating the tether segments upstream of the arcing section, using high-voltage control switches in each power module. This makes it feasible to pull the arcing segment positive to quench the arc. Eac...|$|R
