30|$|The {{other school}} of {{thoughts}} suggests {{that there can be}} abrupt changes in the growth path especially in small enterprises. Recent researches have shown that due to unpredictable intervening factors like knowledge and <b>technology,</b> <b>absorption</b> capabilities, appropriateness of the founder's judgment, and competitive environment, the sequences of stages may be heterogeneous in small enterprises. Phelps et al. 2007 Aislabie 1992 Levie and Hay 1998 Rutherford et al. 2003 and Stubbart and Smalley 1999 have argued that the life cycle models and the deterministic approach to growth are not relevant to organizations. The authors' points out that describing an enterprise growth through a series of stages is equivalent to assuming an organization growth as organism metaphor. Majumdar (2008) has suggested that the enterprise growth depends upon the entrepreneurial vision and stand point. He has further suggested that entrepreneurship is not only maintaining a status quo but also making the enterprise grow.|$|E

Simulation results are threefold. First, biased institutions under Scenario I might help drag the economy towards the right trajectory, with current generations experiencing welfare loss. Secondly, the benevolent government under Scenario II supports the path of capital-augmenting technological change, which is also supported by the distorted government only when institutions deliberately favor the investment goods producing sector. Thirdly, sectoral asymmetries in technology assimilation do not help industries overcome disadvantageous situations in the political market, and hence do not in�uence the direction of technological developments. ...|$|E
