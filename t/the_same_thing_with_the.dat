25|$|In {{order to}} secure his power, Díaz engaged in various forms of {{co-optation}} and coercion. He played his people like a board game – catering to the private desires of different interest groups and playing off one interest against another. In order to satisfy any competing forces, such as the Mestizos and wealthier indigenous people, he gave them political positions of power {{that they could not}} refuse. He did <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> elite Creole society by not interfering with their wealth and haciendas. Covering both pro and anti-clerical elements, Díaz was both the head of the Freemasons in Mexico and an important advisor to the Catholic bishops. Díaz proved to be a different kind of liberal than those of the past. He neither assaulted the Church (like most liberals) nor protected the Church. As for the Native American population, who were historically repressed, they were almost completely depoliticized; neither put on a pedestal as the core of Mexican society nor suppressed, and were largely left to advance by their own means. In giving different groups with potential power a taste of what they wanted, Díaz created the illusion of democracy and quelled almost all competing forces.|$|E

500|$|During {{the closing}} credits of the episode, Stewie talks with Brian {{about how he}} does not like women and relationships, he talks about how he wishes {{that he could do}} <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> same sex so Brian says, [...] "They do; it's called being gay."

500|$|The single [...] "The Wire" [...] was {{released}} on July 29 and the album followed on September 30. The album reached {{number one in the}} UK and has since sold 200,000 copies there. To promote the album, the group performed [...] "The Wire" [...] on the BBC's The Andrew Marr Show, with Este dedicating the song to the British Prime Minister David Cameron, also a guest on the show. The move was criticised as being ill-judged by Johnny Marr, who stated that “It’s really simple: they made themselves look like idiots. It’s ridiculous. No-one put a gun to their head. The Conservatives tried to do <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>with</b> <b>The</b> Smiths, to re-appropriate us in a false way, to be cool by association.” Haim did not respond.|$|E

Just think of it!" ...|$|E

60|$|The demon-worship of Korea is a mild form of <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{hierarchy}} left out, {{every man}} there being his own spiritual adviser. An ordinary Korean is born with an innate belief in malevolent spirits, whom he accordingly propitiates {{from time to}} time. One of nobler birth propitiates only the spirits of his own ancestors.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{is pretty}} nearly so," [...] Malcolm said; [...] "but at present the empress has bought off the Prussians, whose king {{joined in the}} affair solely for his own advantage, by giving him the {{province}} of Silesia, so that in fact at present it is England and Hanover, which is all <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Dutch and Hessians, against France and Bavaria, for I don't think that at present Spain has sent any troops." ...|$|E

[...] "They run pretty nearly {{as fast as a}} horse can gallop, and they don't seem to fear death in the slightest, for they believe that if they are killed they go straight to heaven. It seems to me that savages must be braver than civilized soldiers. It was <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Zulus, you know, they came right down on our men at Isandula, and the fire of the breech-loaders did not stop them in the slightest." ...|$|E

Therefore, I think, they, {{as well as the}} Sepoys, are likely, if they find the task longer and more difficult than they expect, to be ready to grant terms. I have no great faith in native oaths. Still they might be kept.|$|E

He wasn't there, but directly in front of me was King Wallace, in tights, waiting for his turn to go on with his cage of performing lions. He was watching with much amusement a quarrel between a couple of trapeze artists. All the rest of the people in {{the dressing}} tent were watching <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> exception of De Ville whom I noticed staring at Wallace with undisguised hatred.

60|$|It {{might be}} {{supposed}} {{that there is}} always in circulation in a country a quantity of money equal in value to {{the whole of the}} goods then and there on sale. But this would be a complete misapprehension. The money laid out is equal in value to the goods it purchases; but the quantity of money laid out is not <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> quantity in circulation. As the money passes from hand to hand, the same piece of money is laid out many times before all the things on sale at one time are purchased and finally removed from the market; and each pound or dollar must be counted for as many pounds or dollars as the number of times it changes hands in order to effect this object.|$|E

60|$|Piccolo Wright was stooping over {{to pull a}} melon and Archie Hawkins came {{up behind}} him with a big melon that had a seam across it, it was so ripe; and he brought it down on Piccolo's head, and it smashed open and went all over Piccolo. He was pretty mad at first, but {{then he saw the}} fun of it, and he took one end of the melon and scooped it all out, and put it on in place of his hat and wore it like a helmet. Archie did <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> other end, and then all the big boys scooped out melons and wore them for helmets. They were all drabbled with seeds and pulp, and some of the little fellows were {{perfectly}} soaked. None of them cared very much for the muskmelons.|$|E
6000|$|Since the {{appearance}} of these hasty Sketches, I have heard from several of my comrades at the Hospital; and their approval assures me that I have not let sympathy and fancy run away with me, as that lively team is apt to do when harnessed to a pen. As no two persons see <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> same eyes, my view of hospital life must be taken through my glass, and held {{for what it is}} worth. Certainly, nothing was set down in malice, and to the serious-minded party who objected to a tone of levity in some portions of the Sketches, I can only say that it is a part of my religion to look well after the cheerfulnesses of life, and let the dismals shift for themselves; believing, with good Sir Thomas More, that it is wise to [...] "be merrie in God." ...|$|E
60|$|These {{of course}} are all built {{with a view}} to profit, and it may be presumed that in each case the originators of the {{speculation}} enter into some calculation as to their expected guests. Whence are to come the sleepers in those two hundred bed-rooms, and who is to pay for the gaudy sofas and numerous lounging chairs of the ladies' parlors? In all other countries the expectation would extend itself simply to travelers--to travelers or to strangers sojourning in the land. But this {{is by no means the}} case as to these speculations in America. When the new hotel rises up in the wilderness, it is presumed that people will come there with the express object of inhabiting it. The hotel itself will create a population, as the railways do. With us railways run to the towns; but in the States the towns run to the railways. It is <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> hotels.|$|E
60|$|Don't you see? Our truth, {{the very}} truth we told, was our damnation.

6000|$|As soon as tide {{turned the}} anchor was hove {{up and the}} Susan got under way again. The boys soon learnt {{the meaning of the}} word beating, and found that it meant sailing {{backwards}} and forwards across the channel, with the wind sometimes on one side of the boat and sometimes on the other. Geoffrey wanted very much to learn why, when the wind was so nearly ahead, the boat advanced instead of drifting backwards or sideways. But this was altogether beyond the power of either Master Lirriper or Joe Chambers to explain. They said every one knew that when the sails were full a vessel went in the direction in which her head pointed. [...] "It's just the same way with yourself, Master Geoffrey. You see, when you look one way that's the way you go. When you turn your head and point another way, of course you go off that way; and it's just <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> ship." ...|$|E
60|$|From {{inquiries}} which I {{have made}} in several large families, pouting does not seem very common with European children; but it prevails throughout the world, and must be both common and strongly marked with most savage races, as it has {{caught the attention of}} many observers. It has been noticed in eight different districts of Australia; and one of my informants remarks how greatly the lips of the children are then protruded. Two observers have seen pouting with the children of Hindoos; three, with those of the Kafirs and Fingoes of South Africa, and with the Hottentots; and two, with the children of the wild Indians of North America. Pouting has also been observed with the Chinese, Abyssinians, Malays of Malacca, Dyaks of Borneo, and often with the New Zealanders. Mr. Mansel Weale informs me that he has seen the lips much protruded, not only with the children of the Kafirs, but with the adults of both sexes when sulky; and Mr. Stack has sometimes observed <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> men, and very frequently with the women of New Zealand. A trace of the same expression may occasionally be detected even with adult Europeans.|$|E
6000|$|Let {{the commons}} in {{parliament}} assembled be one and <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> commons at large. The distinctions {{that are made}} to separate us are unnatural and wicked contrivances. Let us identify, let us incorporate, ourselves with the people. Let us cut all the cables and snap the chains which tie us to an unfaithful shore, and enter the friendly harbour that shoots far out into the main its moles and jettees to receive us.--"War with the world, and peace with our constituents." [...] Be this our motto, and our principle. Then, indeed, we shall be truly great. Respecting ourselves, we shall be respected by the world. At present all is troubled, and cloudy, and distracted, and full of anger and turbulence, both abroad and at home; but the air may be cleared by this storm, and light and fertility may follow it. Let us give a faithful pledge to the people, that we honour indeed the crown, but that we BELONG to them; that we are their auxiliaries, and not their task-masters,--the fellow-labourers in the same vineyard,--not lording over their rights, but helpers of their joy: that to tax them is a grievance to ourselves; but to cut off from our enjoyments to forward theirs, is the highest gratification we are capable of receiving.|$|E
