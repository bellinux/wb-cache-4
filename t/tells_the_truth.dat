500|$|Susan Beegel {{has written}} that some more recent critics—writing {{through the lens of}} a more modern social and {{cultural}} context several decades after Hemingway's death, and {{more than half a century}} after his novels were first published—have characterized the social era portrayed in his fiction as misogynistic and homophobic. In her 1996 essay, [...] "Critical Reception", Beegel analyzed four decades of Hemingway criticism and found that [...] "critics interested in multiculturalism", particularly in the 1980s, simply ignored Hemingway, although some [...] "apologetics" [...] have been written. Typical, according to Beegel, is an analysis of Hemingway's 1926 novel, The Sun Also Rises, in which a critic contended: [...] "Hemingway never lets the reader forget that Cohn is a Jew, not an unattractive character who happens to be a Jew but a character who is unattractive because he is a Jew." [...] Also during the 1980s, according to Beegel, criticism was published that focused on investigating the [...] "horror of homosexuality" [...] and the [...] "racism" [...] typical of the social era portrayed in Hemingway's fiction. In an overall assessment of Hemingway's work Beegel has written: [...] "Throughout his remarkable body of fiction, he <b>tells</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> about human fear, guilt, betrayal, violence, cruelty, drunkenness, hunger, greed, apathy, ecstasy, tenderness, love and lust." ...|$|E
