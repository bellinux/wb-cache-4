5|$|Two {{weeks after}} the end of <b>the</b> <b>hostage</b> <b>crisis,</b> President Claire Haas (Marcia Cross) and CIA {{director}} Matthew Keyes put forth a covert joint task force between the FBI and CIA. President Haas mentions that there were eight collaborators within the shadowy cabal group who are secretly involved with the AIC. As a result of Lydia's actions, the collaborators gained access to sensitive U.S intelligence. This information was vital to their goal of controlling certain areas within the government. As a response, the task force is assigned to uncover the conspiracy and expose the involvement of the collaborators in orchestrating <b>the</b> <b>hostage</b> <b>crisis.</b> Alex is hired {{to be a member of}} the task force along with Ryan Booth, Nimah Amin, Shelby Wyatt, and Dayana Mampasi. The leader of the group is Clay Haas (Hunter Parrish), a renowned political advisory strategist. Prior to the formation of the task force, Alex is re-instated as an FBI agent.|$|E
5|$|The hostage-takers {{and their}} cause were largely {{forgotten}} after the Iran–Iraq War broke {{out later that}} year and <b>the</b> <b>hostage</b> <b>crisis</b> in Tehran continued until January 1981. Nonetheless, the operation brought the SAS to the public eye {{for the first time}} and bolstered the reputation of Thatcher. The SAS was quickly overwhelmed by the number of applications it received from people inspired by the operation and experienced greater demand for its expertise from foreign governments. The building, having suffered major damage from a fire that broke out during the assault, was not reopened as the Iranian embassy until 1993.|$|E
5|$|Alex Parrish, {{a former}} FBI recruit, becomes a prime suspect after a {{terrorist}} attack on Grand Central Terminal and is arrested for treason. In flashbacks, she and her fellow agents (each with their own reason for joining the bureau) train at the FBI Academy. The current time-line focuses on Parrish's constrained relationship with her friends while {{she is on the}} run in an attempt to prove her innocence. In the second season, Parrish has apparently been fired by the FBI; in flashbacks, she works undercover for the FBI as a CIA recruit to uncover the AIC, a rogue faction within the agency. In the current time-line, a hostage crisis at a G-20 summit in New York City is initiated by the Citizens Liberation Front, a terrorist group. Two weeks after the crisis, President Claire Haas and CIA director Matthew Keyes form a covert CIA-FBI task force (led by Clay Haas) to expose eight conspirators who were secretly involved in <b>the</b> <b>hostage</b> <b>crisis.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> Iran <b>hostage</b> <b>crisis</b> {{negotiations}} were negotiations in 1980 and 1981 between the United States Government and the Iranian Government to end <b>the</b> Iranian <b>hostage</b> <b>crisis.</b> <b>The</b> 52 American <b>hostages,</b> seized from <b>the</b> US Embassy in Tehran in November 1979, were finally released on 20 January 1981.|$|R

5|$|Duane Roger Morrison (July 23, 1953 – September 27, 2006) was {{eventually}} {{identified as the}} perpetrator of the incident. He was unemployed {{at the time of}} <b>the</b> <b>hostage</b> <b>crisis,</b> and had no known connection to Platte Canyon High School or any of the hostages. Initial reports of the gunman described him as a bearded 35-year-old man with a camouflage backpack and a black hooded sweatshirt. Morrison had been imprisoned in 1973 for larceny and possession of marijuana, and was arrested on a separate occasion for obstructing police in Littleton, Colorado. Police announced that a suicide letter written by Morrison to a family member was being analyzed by the FBI. Morrison's family gave the letter to police, who then submitted the document to the FBI Behavioral Unit in Quantico, Virginia. In the 14-page letter, Morrison claimed that he was mentally and physically abused by his father as a child, and had suicidal thoughts since he was 21 years old.|$|E
5|$|On Nimbus III, the Enterprise crew {{discovers that}} renegade Vulcan Sybok, Spock's half-brother, is behind <b>the</b> <b>hostage</b> <b>crisis.</b> Sybok reveals the hostage {{situation}} was a ruse to lure a starship to Nimbus III. Sybok {{wants to use}} a ship to reach the mythical planet Sha Ka Ree, the place where creation began; the planet lies behind a seemingly impenetrable barrier {{near the center of}} the galaxy. Sybok uses his unique ability to reveal and heal the innermost pain of a person through the mind meld to subvert the wills of the hostages and crew members. Only Spock and Kirk prove resistant to Sybok; Spock is unmoved by the experience and Kirk refuses the Vulcan's offer, telling him that his pain is what makes him human. Sybok reluctantly declares a truce with Kirk, realizing he needs his leadership experience to navigate the Enterprise to Sha Ka Ree.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, Human Rights Watch {{reported}} Chechens in Moscow {{were subjected}} to increased police harassment after <b>the</b> <b>hostage</b> <b>crisis.</b> Moscow's Chechens rose in numbers from about 20,000 in the Soviet period to an estimated 80,000 in 2002.|$|E

50|$|The {{group was}} {{instrumental}} in the Russian government's attempts to forcibly bring an end to a series of mass <b>hostage</b> <b>crisis</b> incidents, in which groups of Chechen and other separatist militants took hostages. These events took place in Russia's southern territories near Chechnya {{as well as in the}} Russian heartland, and were made up of <b>the</b> Budyonnovsk hospital <b>hostage</b> <b>crisis</b> in June 1995, <b>the</b> Kizlyar-Pervomayskoye <b>hostage</b> <b>crisis</b> in January 1996, <b>the</b> Moscow theatre <b>hostage</b> <b>crisis</b> in October 2002, and <b>the</b> Beslan school <b>hostage</b> <b>crisis</b> in September 2004.

25|$|President Putin {{was unhappy}} with the {{coverage}} of <b>the</b> <b>hostage</b> <b>crisis</b> by NTV, the last nationwide TV channel effectively independent of the government. In January 2003 the management of NTV was replaced, resulting in {{a profound effect on}} its editorial policy.|$|E
25|$|In early November, Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov {{announced}} Russian {{troops had}} launched large-scale operations against separatists throughout Chechnya.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>hostage</b> <b>crisis</b> was {{resolved}} {{by a combined}} police and military intervention, which was able to rescue 10 hostages. The end of the crisis saw the deaths of five hostages, including Hamill, {{as well as all}} 16 hostage takers. It is unclear if the five deaths among the hostages was a consequence of the intervention or if it was an act commited by the inmates.|$|E

25|$|By the {{beginning}} of the election campaign, the prolonged Iran hostage crisis had sharpened public perceptions of a national crisis. On April 25, 1980, Carter's ability to use <b>the</b> <b>hostage</b> <b>crisis</b> to regain public acceptance eroded when his high risk attempt to rescue the hostages ended in disaster when eight servicemen were killed. The unsuccessful rescue attempt drew further skepticism towards his leadership skills.|$|E
25|$|On {{the third}} day of <b>the</b> <b>hostage</b> <b>crisis,</b> the Beslan siege {{collapsed}} into a bloodbath. After the bloody conclusion of the crisis, Nur-Pashi attempted to escape by disguising himself as a hostage and hiding under an OMON truck. One of the local residents noticed him, at which point he was pulled out from beneath the truck and almost lynched by an angry mob before being arrested by Russian special forces.|$|E
25|$|The {{survivors}} of <b>the</b> <b>hostage</b> <b>crisis</b> {{were put into}} military custody immediately after the crisis was resolved. Reporters were barred from interviewing the survivors raising speculation of a coverup. Brig. Gen. Mariano Baccay, one of the negotiators, said that the survivors were still recovering from shock caused by the incident. It was reported that photographers covering the event witnessed a soldier delivering a coup de grace to a wounded inmate hostage taker.|$|E

25|$|The {{aftermath}} of <b>the</b> <b>hostage</b> <b>crisis</b> {{was met with}} shock and dismay throughout the Philippines. Comments ranged from shame, sadness, and sympathy for the hostage victims; anger mixed {{with a sense of}} disbelief at the perpetrator Rolando Mendoza, the police force for its apparent bungling, and media for its overzealous coverage; and concern over the damage to the image of the country as a tourist destination and the safety and well-being of Filipinos overseas who might experience backlash over the incident.|$|E

The two Kuwaitis {{killed during the}} course of the hijacking were buried at a ceremony attended by over 2,000 people. On April 25, Time Magazine reported that many Middle East leaders had condemned the hijacking because it had shifted focus away from the Palestinian uprising against Israel that had commenced a few months earlier. It also frustrated already tense relations between Iran and the PLO. The Kuwait government believed the hijacking to be the work of Hezbollah, a pro-Iranian Shi'ite group based in Lebanon.|$|E

25|$|Jimmy Carter, {{running as}} someone {{who was not a}} part of the Washington {{political}} establishment, was elected president in 1976. On the world stage, Carter brokered the Camp David Accords between Israel and Egypt. In 1979, Iranian students stormed the U.S. embassy in Tehran and took 66 Americans hostage, resulting in the Iran hostage crisis. With <b>the</b> <b>hostage</b> <b>crisis</b> and continuing stagflation, Carter lost the 1980 election to the Republican Ronald Reagan. On January 20, 1981, minutes after Carter's term in office ended, the remaining U.S. captives held at the U.S. embassy in Iran were released, ending the 444-day hostage crisis.|$|E
25|$|In July 1990, the Jamaat al Muslimeen, {{an extremist}} Black Muslim group with an {{unresolved}} grievance {{against the government}} over land claims, tried to overthrow the NAR government. The group held {{the prime minister and}} members of parliament hostage for five days while rioting shook Port of Spain. After a long standoff with the police and military, the Jamaat al Muslimeen leader, Yasin Abu Bakr, and his followers surrendered to Trinidadian authorities. Having had the matter referred back to the local courts by the Privy Council with a clear indication of a view that the amnesty was valid, in July 1992, the High Court upheld the validity of a government amnesty given to the Jamaat members during <b>the</b> <b>hostage</b> <b>crisis.</b> Abu Bakr and 113 other Jamaat members were jailed for two years while the courts debated the amnesty's validity. All 114 members were eventually released. Subsequent to this, the UK Privy Council deemed the amnesty invalid but expressed the view that it would be improper to re-arrest the 114 accused.|$|E
500|$|As a {{counter-argument}} to {{accusations of}} a pre-arranged prisoner release, deficits {{in planning and}} communications that the German negotiators had encountered during <b>the</b> <b>hostage</b> <b>crisis</b> have been cited. The situation had been chaotic and confusing at times, which lets it seem unlikely that it was scripted. LH 615 – Operation München (...) , a 1975 documentary feature produced by Bayerischer Rundfunk, attributes the non-violent outcome of the hijacking to Lufthansa chairman Culmann and consul Laqueur: They had acted {{on their own terms}} rather than obeying orders by governmental officials.|$|E
