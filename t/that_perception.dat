Because dominance complementarity bodes well for task-oriented relationships, seeing dominance complementarity allows one to be optimistic about a work relationship. As evidence <b>that</b> <b>perceptions</b> of dominance complementarity are an instance of motivated perception, the authors show <b>that</b> complementary <b>perceptions</b> occur when participants think about or expect task-oriented relationships with the target and <b>that</b> <b>perceptions</b> of dominance complementarity are enhanced when individuals care about the task component of the relationship...|$|R

He supported the idea <b>that</b> <b>perception</b> of sound derives from signals from nerve cells of the basilar membrane and that the elastic appendages of these cells are sympathetically vibrated by pure sinusoidal tones of appropriate frequencies. Helmholtz agreed with the finding of Ernst Chladni from 1787 that certain sound sources have inharmonic vibration modes.|$|E

40|$|A {{person is}} said to be 'trust responsive' if she fulfils trust because she {{believes}} the truster trusts her. The experiment we report was designed to test for trust responsiveness and its robustness across payoff structures, and to disentangle it from other possible factors making for trustworthiness, including perceived kindness, perceived need, and inequality aversion. We elicit the truster's confidence that the trustee will fulfil, and the trustee's belief about the trusteer's confidence after the trustee receives evidence relevant to this. We find evidence of strong trust responsiveness. We also find <b>that</b> <b>perceptions</b> of kindness and of need increase trust responsiveness, and <b>that</b> <b>perceptions</b> of kindness and need raise fulfilling rates only in conjunction with trust responsiveness...|$|R

Belieu and Marvin, {{because they}} are both poets and teachers, had been acquainted with one another for some time.

25|$|The direct realist {{theory of}} speech {{perception}} (mostly associated with Carol Fowler) {{is a part}} of the more general theory of direct realism, which postulates <b>that</b> <b>perception</b> allows us to have direct awareness of the world because it involves direct recovery of the distal source of the event that is perceived. For speech perception, the theory asserts that the objects of perception are actual vocal tract movements, or gestures, and not abstract phonemes or (as in the Motor Theory) events that are causally antecedent to these movements, i.e. intended gestures. Listeners perceive gestures not by means of a specialized decoder (as in the Motor Theory) but because information in the acoustic signal specifies the gestures that form it. By claiming that the actual articulatory gestures that produce different speech sounds are themselves the units of speech perception, the theory bypasses the problem of lack of invariance.|$|E

Having laid out Tye’s `absentqualia’ scenario, the PANIC theory from which it derives and the case of heat perception as a counterexample, I defend the putative counterexample against three possible responses: (1) <b>that</b> heat <b>perception</b> represents general(i. e. non-disjunctive) intrinsic properties of objects,(2) <b>that</b> heat <b>perception</b> represents the non-specific heat energy that is transferred between a subject’s body and another body and (3) <b>that</b> heat <b>perception</b> exclusively represents heat properties of the subject’s own body...|$|R
25|$|During 19th {{and early}} 20th century, in the Ottoman Empire and Middle East, {{liberalism}} influenced periods of reform {{such as the}} Tanzimat and Nahda; the rise of secularism, constitutionalism and nationalism; and different intellectuals and religious group and movements, like the Young Ottomans and Islamic Modernism. Prominet of the era were Rifa'a al-Tahtawi, Namık Kemal and İbrahim Şinasi. However, the reformist ideas and trends didn't reach the common population successfully, as the books, periodicals, and newspapers were accessible primarily to intellectuals and segments of an emerging middle class, while many Muslims saw them as foreign influences on the world of Islam. <b>That</b> <b>perception</b> complicated reformist efforts made by Middle Eastern states.

25|$|After the NFL's Green Bay Packers won {{the first}} two Super Bowls, some team owners feared {{for the future of}} the merger. At the time, many doubted the {{competitiveness}} of AFL teams compared with their NFL counterparts, though <b>that</b> <b>perception</b> changed when the AFL's New York Jets defeated the NFL's Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl III in Miami. One year later, the AFL's Kansas City Chiefs defeated the NFL's Minnesota Vikings 23–7 in Super Bowl IV in New Orleans, which was the final AFL-NFL World Championship Game played before the merger. Beginning with the 1970 season, the NFL realigned into two conferences; the former AFL teams plus three NFL teams (the Colts, Pittsburgh Steelers, and Cleveland Browns) would constitute the American Football Conference (AFC), while the remaining NFL clubs would form the National Football Conference (NFC). The champions of the two conferences would play each other in the Super Bowl.|$|E
25|$|Vibrato is a {{technique}} of the left hand and arm in which the pitch of a note varies subtly in a pulsating rhythm. While {{various parts of the}} hand or arm may be involved in the motion, the end result is a movement of the fingertip bringing about a slight change in vibrating string length, which causes an undulation in pitch. Some violinists oscillate backwards, or lower in pitch from the actual note when using vibrato, since it is believed <b>that</b> <b>perception</b> favors the highest pitch in a varying sound. Vibrato does little, if anything, to disguise an out-of-tune note; in other words, misapplied vibrato is a poor substitute for good intonation. Scales and other exercises meant to work on intonation are typically played without vibrato to make the work easier and more effective. Music students are often taught that unless otherwise marked in music, vibrato is assumed. However, it has to be noted that this is only a trend; there is nothing on the sheet music that compels violinists to add vibrato. This can be an obstacle to a classically trained violinist wishing to play in a style that uses little or no vibrato at all, such as baroque music played in period style and many traditional fiddling styles.|$|E

As the Chicago School of Sociology often proclaimed, perceptions are ‘real in their consequences’ (Thomas and Znaniecki, 1927, p. 8, cited in Rogers, 1995, p. 209). This project also examines how integrators’ perceptions can act upon present expectations of RFID technology. An understanding of what leading integrators think at this moment may benefit vendors and others to create applications that will eventually secure more widespread acceptance.

500|$|When the Khmer Rouge {{regime was}} removed from power in January 1979, the Kampuchean people hoped that peace and liberty would return to their country. This was {{reinforced}} by the Constitution of the People’s Republic of Kampuchea, proclaimed in 1981, which specifically stated that Kampuchea is an independent, peaceful state where power belongs to the people. However, there was a deep contrast between what was written within the Kampuchean constitution and reality, because the Kampuchean people began to despair at what they viewed as the Vietnamese occupation of their country, rather than a liberation that had freed them from the brutality of Democratic Kampuchea. <b>That</b> <b>perception</b> was reinforced {{by the presence of}} Vietnamese advisers who worked at every level of Heng Samrin's Kampuchean Government. In 1986, for example, there was one Vietnamese adviser for every Kampuchean cabinet minister and one adviser for each one of their three deputy ministers. Furthermore, it was reported that final decisions made by a Kampuchean minister had to receive final approval from the Vietnamese adviser, who usually dictated policies. Opposition to Vietnamese was further fomented by human rights abuses committed by the Vietnamese and their allies. To fulfill its K5 Plan, a construction project to strengthen the Cambodia-Thai border, the PRK government conscripted 380,000 people, with large numbers succumbing to malaria. Claude Malhuret of [...] Médecins Sans Frontières reported that a tactic the Vietnamese and KPRAF used to fight the Khmer Rouge was to withhold food from areas controlled by the Khmer Rouge.

40|$|There {{is growing}} {{recognition}} globally {{that the current}} organisational change management methodologies and practices are ineffective. This admission {{is based on the}} fact that change efforts implemented in organisations do not produce the desired results in terms of set change objectives. This assertion is evidenced by the dismal success rate in the implementation of organisational change initiatives. Empirical studies conducted previously by authors such as Hattingh (2004), Balogun and Hope Hailey (2004), Bregman (2009), Lotich (2011), and Choi and Ruona (2011) have confirmed that there is indeed a high failure rate in the implementation of organisational change efforts. The high failure rate that organisations record is attributed to managers’ neglect of the elements and dynamics of change, which constitute the human dimension of change. People’s perceptions of change form part of the dynamics of change which need to be seriously addressed if success in the implementation of organisational change efforts is to be attained. Empirical studies that seek to validate the claim <b>that</b> <b>perceptions</b> play a critical role in shaping people’s attitudes towards change and consequently their responses to change in terms of their reactions and resistance to change, have somehow been very limited. This is what this study sought to do – to investigate, establish, explore and understand the role <b>that</b> <b>perceptions</b> play in influencing people’s attitudes towards change, thereby influencing the status of change in terms of success or failure. The undertaking of the study on perceptions was to ensure that managers understand the influence <b>that</b> <b>perceptions</b> have on people’s attitudes towards change. The researcher conducted a literature study in order to contextualise the role of perceptions in influencing people’s attitudes within the offender correctional environment in the Department of Correctional Services of South Africa.
