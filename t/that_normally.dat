5|$|A flight {{behaviour}} {{in which}} a bird rapidly descends with a zig-zagging, side-slipping motion. During whiffling, some birds invert the aerodynamic mechanics of their body <b>that</b> <b>normally</b> provide lift—flying by turning their bodies upside down but with their necks twisted 180 degrees to keep their heads in a normal flying position—resulting in a rapid plummet, before a quick arrest of the fall by resuming a normal flying orientation.|$|E

5|$|As {{with most}} breeds of dog, the Russian Toy can suffer from patellar luxation, {{which is where}} the knee cap slips out of place when the knee bends as the groove <b>that</b> <b>normally</b> holds it in place is too shallow. It is usually an {{inherited}} defect, which occurs during the development of the foetus and rarely by trauma.|$|E

5|$|Bumblebees are {{parasitised}} by tracheal mites, Locustacarus buchneri; protozoans including Crithidia bombi and Apicystis bombi; and microsporidians including Nosema bombi and Nosema ceranae. The tree bumblebee B. hypnorum {{has spread}} into the United Kingdom despite hosting {{high levels of}} a nematode <b>that</b> <b>normally</b> interferes with queen bees' attempts to establish colonies.

5|$|A {{few of the}} {{closely related}} mites also infest humans, some causing intense itching by their bites and others by {{burrowing}} into the skin. Species <b>that</b> <b>normally</b> infest other animals such as rodents may infest humans if their normal hosts are eliminated. Three species of mite are a threat to honey bees and one of these, Varroa destructor, has become the largest single problem faced by beekeepers worldwide. Mites cause several forms of allergic diseases, including hay fever, asthma and eczema, and they aggravate atopic dermatitis. Mites are also significant crop pests, although predatory mites {{may be useful in}} controlling some of these.|$|E
5|$|Apo{{lipoprotein}} B, in its ApoB100 form, is {{the main}} apolipoprotein, or protein part of the lipoprotein particle. Its gene {{is located on the}} second chromosome (2p24-p23) and is between 21.08 and 21.12Mb long. FH is often associated with the mutation of R3500Q, which causes replacement of arginine by glutamine at position 3500. The mutation is located on a part of the protein <b>that</b> <b>normally</b> binds with the LDL receptor, and binding is reduced {{as a result of the}} mutation. Like LDLR, the number of abnormal copies determines the severity of the hypercholesterolemia.|$|E
5|$|At {{the ends}} of the linear {{chromosomes}} are specialized regions of DNA called telomeres. The main function of these regions is to allow the cell to replicate chromosome ends using the enzyme telomerase, as the enzymes <b>that</b> <b>normally</b> replicate DNA cannot copy the extreme 3′ ends of chromosomes. These specialized chromosome caps also help protect the DNA ends, and stop the DNA repair systems in the cell from treating them as damage to be corrected. In human cells, telomeres are usually lengths of single-stranded DNA containing several thousand repeats of a simple TTAGGG sequence.|$|E

Cumulus virga clouds are cumulus clouds producing virga (precipitation that evaporates while aloft), and cumulus praecipitatio produce precipitation that reaches the Earth's surface. Cumulus pannus comprise shredded clouds <b>that</b> <b>normally</b> appear beneath the parent cumulus cloud during precipitation. Cumulus arcus clouds have a gust front, and cumulus tuba clouds have funnel clouds or tornadoes. Cumulus pileus clouds refer to cumulus clouds that have grown so rapidly as to force the formation of pileus {{over the top of}} the cloud. Cumulus velum clouds have an ice crystal veil over the growing top of the cloud.|$|E
5|$|Hemorrhage from a Rathke's cleft cyst, {{a remnant}} of Rathke's pouch <b>that</b> <b>normally</b> regresses after embryological development, may cause {{symptoms}} that are indistinguishable from pituitary apoplexy. Pituitary apoplexy is regarded by some as distinct from Sheehan's syndrome, where the pituitary undergoes infarction {{as a result of}} prolonged very low blood pressure, particularly when caused by bleeding after childbirth. This condition usually occurs {{in the absence of a}} tumor. Others regard Sheehan's syndrome as a form of pituitary apoplexy.|$|E
5|$|In 1913 the {{physicist}} Niels Bohr proposed {{a model in}} which the electrons of an atom were assumed to orbit the nucleus but could only {{do so in a}} finite set of orbits, and could jump between these orbits only in discrete changes of energy corresponding to absorption or radiation of a photon. This quantization was used to explain why the electrons orbits are stable (given <b>that</b> <b>normally,</b> charges in acceleration, including circular motion, lose kinetic energy which is emitted as electromagnetic radiation, see synchrotron radiation) and why elements absorb and emit electromagnetic radiation in discrete spectra.|$|E

These facilities take energy <b>that’s</b> <b>normally</b> wasted and convert it into electricity and thermal power for manufacturers, universities, hospitals, {{and other large}} institutions.

Though they did not race as Astana due to UCI rules, Armstrong, Leipheimer, and Chris Horner {{took part in the}} Tour of the Gila at the end of April and early May in what was Armstrong's first race back from the collarbone injury, with Leipheimer and Armstrong finishing in the top two places. With a squad made up of riders <b>that</b> <b>normally</b> ride in support for others, the team took a stage win (Klöden) and second overall (Janez Brajkovič) in the Giro del Trentino, also in April.|$|E
5|$|In endometrioid adenocarcinoma, {{the cancer}} cells grow in {{patterns}} reminiscent of normal endometrium, with many new glands formed from columnar epithelium with some abnormal nuclei. Low-grade endometrioid adenocarcinomas have well differentiated cells, have not invaded the myometrium, and are seen alongside endometrial hyperplasia. The tumor's glands form very close together, without the stromal tissue <b>that</b> <b>normally</b> separates them. Higher-grade endometrioid adenocarcinomas have less well-differentiated cells, have more solid sheets of tumor cells no longer organized into glands, and {{are associated with}} an atrophied endometrium. There are several subtypes of endometrioid adenocarcinoma with similar prognoses, including villoglandular, secretory, and ciliated cell variants. There is also a subtype characterized by squamous differentiation. Some endometrioid adenocarcinomas have foci of mucinous carcinoma.|$|E
5|$|In {{the table}} above, genitive pronouns all end with -gin, which is {{separated}} orthographically by a hyphen <b>that</b> <b>normally</b> divides morphemes. The -gin form {{here is not}} a separate morpheme and cannot be lexically segmented; {{there is no such}} word as nganing that would be formed by removing -gin from nganing-gin 'my/mine'. The fact that the genitive forms have regular endings across the entire pronoun paradigm may have been a historical accident.|$|E

An outdoor concert is held on Amsterdam's Museumplein, where {{as many as}} 800,000people may gather. To aid visitors in returning home by train after the festivities outdoor events must end by 20:00, and the Museumplein show by 21:00. The city centre is closed to cars, and no trams ride {{in the heart of}} the city; people are urged to avoid Amsterdam Centraal railway station and use other stations if possible from their direction. International trains <b>that</b> <b>normally</b> begin or terminate at Amsterdam Centraal are instead directed to a suburban stop.|$|E
5|$|One {{source of}} income for the area is visiting cruise ships. The Norwegian {{government}} has become concerned in recent years about large numbers of cruise ship passengers suddenly landing at small settlements such as Ny-Ålesund, which is conveniently close to the barren-yet-picturesque Magdalena Fjord. With the increasing size of the larger ships, up to 2000 people can potentially appear in a community <b>that</b> <b>normally</b> numbers less than 40. The government has recently passed legislation, effective from January 2014, severely restricting the size of cruise ships that may visit.|$|E

Avian malaria has also been recorded. The leucocytozoon blood parasite L. caprimulgi is rare in the European nightjar. Its scarcity {{and the fact that}} it is the only one of its genus found in nightjars support the suggestion that it has crossed over from close relatives <b>that</b> <b>normally</b> infect owls.|$|E
