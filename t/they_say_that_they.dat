However, the Police's UK National Wildlife Crime Unit has said that policing of hunting should be a priority for forces in some areas of the country, most notably the South West.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fourth}} stanza, the poet visits a fruit shop. There she {{inquires}} {{about what they}} are selling. They reply, we sell lemon, pomegranate and plum. Then the musicians were asked what they play and they say sitar, sarangi and drums. The poet even comes across magicians and asks them what they are chanting and <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are chanting magical spells to charm thousand ages to come.|$|E

[...] Jeanie, an {{eccentric}} young woman, appears wearing a gas mask, satirizing pollution ("Air"). [...] She is pregnant and {{in love with}} Claude. [...] Although she wishes it was Claude's baby, she was [...] "knocked up by some crazy speed freak". [...] The tribe link together LBJ (President Lyndon B. Johnson), FBI (the Federal Bureau of Investigation), CIA (the Central Intelligence Agency) and LSD ("Initials"). [...] Six members of the tribe appear dressed as Claude's parents, berating him for his various transgressions – {{he does not have}} a job, and he collects [...] "mountains of paper" [...] clippings and notes.

500|$|Meanwhile, the French crew is {{rescued by}} a cargo ship, and the U.S. Navy is {{deployed}} by NATO after getting {{word from the}} cargo ship captain that the pirates now have [...] "advanced weaponry" [...] (which was really just Kevin's toy lightsaber, that the French crew thought was real). Kyle arrives in Mogadishu, but is immediately taken captive by the pirates and held hostage. He pleads with Cartman to let him and his brother leave, but Cartman refuses, believing that Kyle is simply jealous of his new pirate life. Meanwhile, an English-speaking pirate named Guleed asks Butters and Ike why they decided to become pirates. When <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> left because they were tired of things like school, chores, homework, and being yelled at by adults, Guleed responds by telling them that he dreamed of a simple life going to school, and that his mother is suffering with AIDS but cannot be treated, and his father {{was killed in an}} attempt to find food for his family. He never set out to be a pirate, but was forced into piracy to support his family. Butters and Ike end up realizing how close-minded they've been and that a life of piracy is one of hardship and suffering rather than fun and adventure like normal life can be. They then tell Cartman that they want to return home, but he refuses to give up his delusions of grandeur and threatens the boys with death by calling the real pirates to hold them at gunpoint. However, Cartman's vision is quickly disrupted when a U.S Navy ship hired by NATO appears off the coast carrying snipers, who shoot all of Cartman's pirate colleagues with a single gunshot to each of their heads. This leaves Cartman dumbfounded and annoyed.|$|E

There, they meet Apu and Manjula. <b>They</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{would like to have a}} baby. They {{eventually}} do, and Manjula gives birth to octuplets with the help of fertility drugs, given by the Simpsons and Apu. It makes headlines across Springfield, with local companies giving the Nahasapeemapetilons free products. However, their feat is eclipsed when a family in Shelbyville give birth to nine babies. With the discovery, the gifts were revoked. Apu and Manjula swiftly find they are not up to the task of raising eight kids all at once.|$|E

Carbunkle also confirms that because Pat will be away participating in the contest, a robot replica of him called the [...] "Patbot 3000" [...] will be taking over his postal duties, along with another robot replica of Jess called the [...] "Jessbot" [...] as well. After Pat has gone, the Patbot delivers the rounds like Pat normally does, but it behaves oddly {{and the people of}} Greendale are starting to complain about Pat behaving in such a way. Sara and Julian are starting to worry about Pat too.|$|E

50|$|Rita Carter says {{evidence}} for multiplicity abounds and {{is found in}} history, and that when an individual states <b>that</b> <b>they</b> have {{been taken over by}} a spirit, soul, or ghost, <b>they</b> are <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are experiencing another personality.
