25|$|The Perry Mason {{character}} {{has appeared in}} comic books and a short-lived (October 16, 1950– June 21, 1952) comic strip. He was also the inspiration for <b>The</b> <b>Whole</b> <b>Truth</b> (1986) by James Cummins, a book-length collection of sestinas.|$|E
25|$|Deception is {{the act of}} {{propagating}} {{beliefs in}} {{things that are not}} true, or not <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>truth</b> (as in half-truths or lying by omission). Deception can involve dissimulation, propaganda, and sleight of hand, as well as distraction, camouflage, or concealment. There is also self-deception, as in bad faith.|$|E

60|$|To tell <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> {{unvarnished}} <b>truth,</b> {{his interview}} with Clyffurde and his thoughtlessness in wandering along the road all alone, laden with twenty-five million francs, not waiting {{for the arrival of}} M. le Comte d'Artois' patrol, was unthinkable.|$|R
25|$|While being interrogated, García {{claimed that}} the two men had merely {{attempted}} to rape her. Her Catholic sensibilities and sense of shame prevented her from revealing <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>truth.</b> At the jail, she was tested for drugs and alcohol but not for signs of rape. Castillo was never charged with any crime.|$|E
25|$|On May 17, 2000 {{a special}} {{commission}} was formed with David Gamkrelidze at the chairmanship {{to investigate the}} budget deficit of 1999. In six months, David Gamkrelidze presented to the Parliament a conclusion and said <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>truth</b> {{as to what the}} reason for the 1999 drastic budget deficit in actuality was.|$|E
25|$|A half-truth is a {{deceptive}} {{statement that}} includes some element of truth. The statement might be partly true, the statement may be totally true but {{only part of}} <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>truth,</b> or it may employ some deceptive element, such as improper punctuation, or double meaning, especially if the intent is to deceive, evade, blame or misrepresent the truth.|$|E

60|$|Awaiting him in {{the study}} he found not only Lord Wellington, but Colonel Grant, and by the cold gravity of both their faces he had an {{inspiration}} that in some mysterious way <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> hideous <b>truth</b> was already known to them.|$|R
6000|$|The Chief Inspector {{snatched}} {{across the}} counter the cloth out of her hands, and she sat heavily on the chair. He thought: identification’s perfect. And in that moment he had a glimpse into <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> amazing <b>truth.</b> Verloc was the “other man.” ...|$|R
25|$|Woodman {{was exposed}} to the {{symbolic}} work of Max Klinger whilst studying in Rome from 1977 to 1978 and his influence can clearly be seen in many photographic series’, such as Eel Series, Roma (1977–78) and Angel Series, Roma (1977). In combining performance, play and self-exposure, Woodman’s photographs create extreme and often disturbing psychological states. In concealing or encrypting her subjects she reminds the viewer that photographs flatten and distort, never offering <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>truth</b> about a subject.|$|E
25|$|The {{problem with}} this kind of {{argument}} is just that, in defining the meaning of what is happening in society, {{it is very difficult to}} provide definite scientific proof that this meaning is the objective truth. It remains an interpretation, which may make sense of things at a certain level, without providing <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>truth.</b> Engels's comment illustrates that the concept of character masks is not infrequently used in a polemical way to describe a false or inauthentic representation.|$|E
25|$|While {{appointed}} Prime Minister, {{the aftermath}} of the Portella della Ginestra massacre came to haunt Scelba again. On February 9, 1954, Gaspare Pisciotta was found dead in his cell. After Pisciotta had been sentenced to life in imprisonment and forced labour, he realized that he had been abandoned by all. He declared {{that he was going to}} tell <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>truth,</b> in particular who signed the letter which had been brought to Giuliano, which demanded the massacre at Portella delle Ginestra in exchange for liberty for the bandits and which Giuliano had destroyed immediately.|$|E

60|$|Lady Ferringhall {{sat with}} half closed eyes and clenched teeth. Brute! Fool! To {{have come to}} her on such an errand. She felt a hysterical desire to strike him, to burst out crying, to blurt out <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> miserable <b>truth.</b> <b>The</b> effort to {{maintain}} her self-control was almost superhuman.|$|R
25|$|Rosa later faces {{financial}} {{trouble with the}} restaurant and George offers her help, which she accepts. After Nicky claims she was assaulted by her mathematics tutor Rod Morris (Forbes Masson) and later admits she didn't tell <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>truth</b> (but was still assaulted) and then dissowns the family when they said she was lying, Rosa decides the whole family should leave Walford to move to Leicester and besides Beppe the entire family leaves Walford in August 2000. Rosa dies {{from a heart attack}} two years later at the age of 50. Beppe then later joins the rest of his family in Leicester.|$|E
25|$|Eli goes on {{to train}} Samuel. When Samuel hears God {{speaking}} to him, he at first thinks it is Eli; Eli, who doesn't hear God calling Samuel, eventually realizes the truth, and instructs Samuel on how to respond. Samuel is told that God's threat (which isn't elaborated further) {{will be carried out}} on Eli and his family, and that there is nothing {{that can be done to}} prevent it. Eli asks Samuel what he had been told, insisting that he be told <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>truth,</b> and so Samuel does; Eli reacts by saying that God will do as he judges best.|$|E
25|$|Aurobindo {{asserted}} that spiritual aspirants may pass through an intermediate zone where experiences of force, inspiration, illumination, light, joy, expansion, power, {{and freedom from}} normal limits are possible. These can become associated with personal aspirations, ambitions, notions of spiritual fulfilment and yogic siddhi, and even be falsely interpreted as full spiritual realisation. One can pass through this zone, and the associated spiritual dangers, without harm by perceiving its real nature, and seeing through the misleading experiences. Those who go astray in it may end in a spiritual disaster, or may remain stuck there and adopt some half-truth as <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>truth,</b> or become an instrument of lesser powers of these transitional planes. According to Aurobindo, this happens to many sadhaks and yogis.|$|E
6000|$|... "You, you!" [...] my eyes {{cried out}} on me. And a furious storm--remorse, grief, horror-broke within. I knew <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> awful <b>truth.</b> Like a Shade {{in the bright}} light, Mr Crimble stood there beyond the table, not looking at me, its face turned away. Unspeakable misery bowed my shoulders, chilled my skin.|$|R

60|$|But {{already she}} {{had risen from}} her chair, desperately anxious, {{wondering}} what the meaning could be of the shortness of the interview. She was not kept long in suspense, {{for a moment or}} two later Sir Thomas Ryder came in followed by Doctor Newington. One glance at her uncle's face told her <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> disappointing <b>truth,</b> even before he spoke.|$|R
25|$|The {{parable of}} the blind men and an {{elephant}} originated in ancient Indian subcontinent, from where it has widely diffused. It {{is a story of}} a group of blind men, who have never come across an elephant before, learn and conceptualize what the elephant is like by touching it. Each blind man feels {{a different part of the}} elephant body, but only one part, such as the side or the tusk. They then describe the elephant based on their partial experience and their descriptions are in complete disagreement on what an elephant is. In some versions they come to suspect that the other person is dishonest and they come to blows. The moral of the parable is that humans have a tendency to project their partial experiences as <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>truth,</b> ignore other people's partial experiences, and one should consider that one may be partially right and may have partial information.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, Hunter toured North America with Ringo Starr and his All-Starr Band {{as part of}} a line-up which {{included}} Ringo Starr, Sheila E., Greg Lake, Howard Jones, Roger Hodgson, and Mark Rivera. Hunter's studio album Rant, released the same year, received wide critical acclaim, and was followed by two live albums: 2004's Strings Attached with a 20-piece orchestra, and 2005's The Truth, <b>The</b> <b>Whole</b> <b>Truth</b> and Nuthin' But The Truth with Mick Ralphs (and Brian May of Queen and Joe Elliott of Def Leppard on one song). Hunter won Classic Rock Magazine's Songwriter Award in October 2005. His studio album Shrunken Heads was accompanied by a three-song bonus CD, and was released in May 2007 by Jerkin' Crocus promotions in Europe and Yep Roc Records in the US. Man Overboard, was released on 21 July 2009, by New West Records to critical success, further bolstering his return to public acclaim.|$|E

60|$|<b>The</b> <b>whole</b> sad <b>truth</b> {{about herself}} {{was in that}} melancholy aspiration. No relief in tears, no merciful {{oblivion}} in a fainting-fit, for her. The terrible strength of the vital organization in this woman knew no yielding to the unutterable misery that wrung her to the soul. It roused its glorious forces to resist: it held her in a stony quiet, with a grip of iron.|$|R

500|$|On 22 March 2005, the Polish Sejm {{unanimously}} {{passed an}} act requesting the Russian archives to be declassified. The Sejm also requested Russia to classify the Katyn massacre {{as a crime}} of genocide. The resolution stressed that the authorities of Russia [...] "seek to diminish the burden of this crime by refusing to acknowledge it was genocide and refuse to give access to {{the records of the}} investigation into the issue, making it difficult to determine <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>truth</b> about the murder and its perpetrators." ...|$|E
500|$|His first novel, Lalande 21185, {{appeared}} in 1966, {{a year after}} his first short-story anthology, and was geared toward young adults. His first serious science-fiction novel was a [...] "first contact"-type SF mystery, [...] (Right of Return, 1975); {{but it was his}} novels of the late 1970s and early 1980s — Cylinder van Troffa (Van Troff's Cylinder, 1980); Limes inferior (The Lower Limit, 1982); Cała prawda o planecie Ksi (<b>The</b> <b>Whole</b> <b>Truth</b> about Planet Xi, [...] 1983); [...] (Out of the Shadows, 1983); and Paradyzja (Paradise: World in Orbit, 1984) — that earned him {{a reputation as one of}} the most important Polish science-fiction writers.|$|E
