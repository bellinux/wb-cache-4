5|$|The attack caused little direct damage, but in {{the narrow}} waters of the channel the fireships panicked the sailors of the French fleet and most of their ships {{grounded}} and were left immobile. Cochrane expected Gambier to follow his attack with the main fleet, which could then destroy the vulnerable French force, but Gambier refused. Cochrane continued <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> next several days, successfully destroying several French ships, but with little support from Gambier. This allowed most of the French fleet to refloat and retreat up the Charente to safety. Gambier recalled Cochrane on 14 April and sent him back to Britain, withdrawing most of the inshore squadron at the same time, although scattered fighting continued until 25 April. The increasingly marginalised French fleet was badly damaged and trapped in its home ports; several captains were court-martialed for cowardice and one was shot.|$|E
5|$|The {{third and}} current DeKalb County Courthouse was {{constructed}} in 1905 at an approximate cost of $137,000. The project reignited {{the debate over the}} county courthouse's location and, once again, the debate over which town would hold the coveted title of county seat. The county Board of Supervisors authorized the project in 1901 and appropriated $100,000 for the new building. The idea for a new courthouse originated as early as 1900, when the essential design elements of the Lee County courthouse were chosen as the model for the new DeKalb County Courthouse. Though the courthouse was modeled after the Lee County structure it does differ; the Lee County building, in Dixon, Illinois, has a rooftop dome and also is longer and wider than the DeKalb County building. By 1903, the appropriation had been upped to $140,000 and <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> county seat had begun.|$|E
5|$|The {{game is a}} turn-based {{strategy}} and revolves around the British 6th Airborne Division's attempts to secure Bénouville Bridge (later renamed Pegasus Bridge, in honour of <b>the</b> <b>battle)</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Caen Canal during the Normandy landings on 5 June 1944. The player is able to command either the British or German side in the game. Regardless of the side chosen, British units will not appear on the map {{at the beginning of}} the game as the British 6th Airborne Division have not yet made their parachute drops. German forces are distributed around the four far corners of the map, with a few units positioned near Bénouville Bridge. If playing as the British, the objective is to defeat all German forces and secure all bridges in the area, with the capture or destruction of the Merville Battery being the ultimate goal. If playing as the Germans, the only objective is to hold off all British attacks for 18 hours, which is the equivalent to 36 in-game turns.|$|E

25|$|However, on {{the second}} day, July 6, 1809, the grenadiers, {{with the rest of}} the Guard cavalry, were {{assigned}} to support general Jacques MacDonald's massive attack column. After an initial success, MacDonald saw a rare opportunity to rout the disorderly troops before him and to that effect he requested a charge from general Étienne de Nansouty's cavalry reserve, inviting all other cavalry commanders in the sector to do the same. The Guard cavalry, however, did not move and the opportunity came to nothing. An angry MacDonald confronted Walther after <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> latter's inaction, at which Walther explained that neither his commander, Marshal Bessières, nor the Emperor, had given any orders for a charge and that the Guard could not act without direct orders from one of the two.

25|$|Dayan {{suggested}} options at {{the beginning}} of the war, including a plan to withdraw to the Mitleh Mountains in Sinai and a complete withdrawal from the Golan Heights to carry <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Jordan, abandoning the core strategic principles of Israeli war doctrine, which says that war must be taken into enemy territory as soon as possible. Chief of Staff David Elazar objected to these plans and was proved correct. Israel broke through the Egyptian lines on the Sinai front, crossed the Suez canal, and encircled the 3rd Egyptian Army. Israel also counterattacked on the Syrian front, repelling the Jordanian and Iraqi expeditionary forces and shelling the outskirts of Damascus. During the war, Dayan was in contact with Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson, who urged him to allow Israeli forces to enter Damascus, even for a few moments. Such a move, argued Schneerson, would provide Israel with a decisive victory. The war ended in a ceasefire and stalemate, but the Arab attack destroyed the image of Israeli invincibility and eventually led to the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty and the subsequent withdrawal of Israeli forces from all Egyptian territory.|$|E

500|$|In the stanza that follows, Helgi {{asks the}} valkyries (who {{he refers to}} as [...] "southern goddesses") if they would like to come home with the warriors when night falls (all the while arrows were flying). <b>The</b> <b>battle</b> <b>over,</b> <b>the</b> valkyrie Sigrún ("victory-rune"), informs him from her horse that her father Högni has betrothed her to Höðbroddr, the son of king Granmar of the Hniflung clan, who Sigrún deems unworthy. Helgi assembles an immense host to ride to wage battle at Frekastein against the Hniflung clan to assist Sigrún in her plight to avoid her betrothment. Later in the poem, the hero Sinfjötli flyts with Guðmundr. Sinfjötli accuses Guðmundr of having once been female, and gibes that Guðmundr was [...] "a witch, horrible, unnatural, among Odin's valkyries", adding that all of the einherjar [...] "had to fight, headstrong woman, on your account". Further in the poem, the phrase [...] "the valkyrie's airy sea" [...] is used for [...] "mist".|$|E

500|$|The {{importance}} of hierarchy and leadership {{is also a}} significant element. The overarching hierarchy of race is informed by Victorian concepts, influenced by the new theories of evolution proposed by Darwin and others. In morals and culture, the natives are placed lower on the evolutionary ladder than are Europeans, as is evidenced in <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> native woman Avatea, which pits [...] "the forces of civilization versus the forces of cannibalism". Another hierarchy {{is seen in the}} organisation of the boys. Although Jack, Ralph and Peterkin each have a say in how they should organise themselves, ultimately the younger boys defer to Jack, [...] "a natural leader", particularly in a crisis, forming a natural hierarchy. The pirates also have a hierarchy, but one without democracy, and as a consequence are wiped out. The hierarchy of the natives is imposed by savagery. Ballantyne's message is that leaders should be respected by those they lead, and govern with their consent. This educational message is especially appropriate considering Ballantyne's adolescent audience, [...] "the future rulers of the world".|$|E
500|$|Randolph {{arrived in}} Boston with Dudley's charter on 14 May 1686, and Dudley {{formally}} {{took charge of}} Massachusetts on 25 May. [...] His rule did not begin auspiciously, since a number of Massachusetts magistrates had been named to his council but refused to serve, and {{he was unable to}} reconcile with Increase Mather, who refused to see him. [...] According to Randolph, the Puritan magistrates [...] "were of opinion that God would never suffer me to land again in this country, and thereupon began in a most arbitrary manner to assert their power higher than at any time before." [...] Elections of colonial military officers were compromised when many of them also refused to serve. [...] Dudley made a number of judicial appointments, generally favoring the political moderates who had supported accommodation of the king's wishes in <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> old charter. [...] He renewed treaties with the Indians of northern New England, and traveled to the Narragansett Country in June to formally establish his authority there.|$|E

[...] As Lord President he assumed vast responsibilities over domestic issues and chaired the War Cabinet during Churchill's many absences. Attlee later remembered him as [...] "free {{from any of the}} rancour he might have felt against us. He worked very hard and well: a good chairman, a good committeeman, always very businesslike". As chairman of the Lord President's Committee, he exerted great influence over the wartime economy. When Axis feelers for peace reached the War Cabinet on 26 May 1940, with the Low Countries conquered and France tottering, Halifax urged following up and seeing if the actual offer was worthwhile. <b>The</b> <b>battle</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> course of action within the War Cabinet lasted three days, and Chamberlain's statement on the final day that there was unlikely to be an acceptable offer and that the feelers should not be pursued at that time helped persuade the War Cabinet to reject negotiations.|$|E

500|$|<b>The</b> <b>battle</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Pryor Mountain herd {{moved to}} the {{national}} level on July 11, 1968, when ABC broadcast a special on the horses on the evening news. The public reacted with outrage, and the BLM responded that [...] "no decision had yet been made regarding the horses." [...] However, {{by the end of}} August, a trap to collect the horses had been completed. At the same time, the BLM was unresponsive to efforts by members of the public, senators and officials from the Humane Society of the United States to ascertain final plans regarding the horses. Because of this, court proceedings were begun, and on August 27, 1968, a US District Court judge made a decision that had the result of barring the BLM from removing the horses from the range. On September 9, 1968, the Secretary of the Interior, Stewart L. Udall, declared the area inhabited by the Pryor Mountain Mustangs as the Pryor Mountain Wild Horse Refuge (PMWHR), in a decision later noted in the Congressional Record. After the creation of the refuge the BLM appointed a committee to study the area and make recommendations regarding appropriate herd numbers. The committee, which met in late 1968 and early 1969, was made up of range and wildlife experts, local citizens interested in the herds and representatives from several federal, state and private organizations. A boundary adjustment was made to the refuge, adding some land in Wyoming. The final report of the committee, submitted in June 1969, was that the horses were not in danger of starvation, that overgrazing was likely due to domestic sheep who utilized the land decades earlier, and that horses were the most likely of any species to be able to survive and thrive in the Pryor Mountain environment. On December 18, 1971, the Wild and Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971 (WFRHBA) was signed into law by President Richard M. Nixon. The Act made it a crime for anyone to harass or kill feral horses or burros on federal land, required the departments of the Interior and Agriculture to protect the animals, required studies of the animals' habits and habitats, and permitted public land to be set aside for their use. [...] The Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service were jointly charged with responsibility for administrating the Act. The National Park Service was also involved in the management of the land. These federal agencies were limited to managing horses only on public lands where [...] "wild horses were documented as being 'presently found' {{at the time of the}} passage of the Act in 1971." ...|$|E

2500|$|Martí's {{writings}} on {{the concepts of}} Cuban nationalism fuelled the 1895 revolution and have continued to inform conflicting visions of the Cuban nation. The Cuban nation-state under Fidel Castro consistently claimed Martí as a crucial inspiration for its Communist revolutionary government. His nuanced, often ambivalent positions {{on the most important}} issues of his day have led Marxist interpreters to see a class conflict between the proletariat and the bourgeousie as the main theme of his works, while others, namely the Cuban diasporic communities in Miami and elsewhere have identified a liberal-capitalist emphasis. These Cuban exiles still honor Martí as a figure of hope for the Cuban nation in exile and condemn Castro's regime for manipulating his works and creating a [...] "Castroite Martí" [...] to justify its [...] "intolerance and abridgments of human rights". His writings thus remain a key ideological weapon in <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> fate of the Cuban nation.|$|E
2500|$|The {{connection}} of the Reform movement to an anti-circumcision, pro-symbolic stance {{is a historical}} one. From {{the early days of}} the movement in Germany, some classical Reformers hoped to replace ritual circumcision [...] "with a symbolic act, as has been done for other bloody practices, such as the sacrifices". In the US, an official Reform resolution in 1893 announced converts are no longer mandated to undergo the ritual, and this ambivalence towards the practice has carried over to classical-minded Reform Jews today. In Elyse Wechterman's essay A Plea for Inclusion, she argues that, even in the absence of circumcision, committed Jews should never be turned away, especially by a movement [...] "where no other ritual observance is mandated". She goes on to advocate an alternate covenant ceremony, brit atifah, for both boys and girls as a welcoming ritual into Judaism. With a continuing negativity towards circumcision still present within a minority of modern-day Reform, Judaic scholar Jon Levenson has warned that if they [...] "continue to judge brit milah to be not only medically unnecessary but also brutalizing and mutilating ... the abhorrence of it expressed by some early Reform leaders will return with a vengeance", proclaiming that circumcision will be [...] "the latest front in <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Jewish future in America".|$|E
