5|$|The {{north side}} of the DeKalb County Courthouse is not as ornately {{decorated}} as the south face but each has its own distinctive qualities. The courthouse drive, entering from Exchange Street, crosses below a stone porte-cochere on the courthouse property. <b>The</b> <b>back</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the building features four pilasters with composite capitals which give the courthouse a temple appearance.|$|E
5|$|The font design {{featured}} on the front cover was created by Pizz, a graphic artist from Long Beach, who also designed album cover art for several other indie rock bands. <b>The</b> <b>back</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the album features a painting by bassist Emery, depicting a topless woman looking at herself through a hand mirror. On her chest is a red heart surrounded by arrows, and below, her ribs protrude from her sides, possibly a reference to anorexia and body image issues, a major theme of the album and its successor Live Through This.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternate}} hypothesis {{suggested by}} Benoit et al. involves {{some kind of}} sensory organ occupying the maxillary fossa. Uniquely among therapsids, the canal within the maxilla is exposed on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the maxillary fossa, which implies that the canal, carrying the trigeminal nerve, would probably have extended across the fossa, outside of {{the outline of the}} skull. Benoit et al. hypothesized that the fossa may have supported a specialized sensory organ analogous to the pit organ of pit vipers and some other snakes, or alternatively a ganglion of nerve cells. It is also possible that this organ functioned as a replacement for the parietal eye in Euchambersia, like the pit organ does in pit vipers. However, such an expanded sensory organ would be unprecedented among tetrapods, and the few other therocephalians that also lack a parietal eye do not have a maxillary fossa either. Thus, Benoit et al. considered the venom hypothesis as being more plausible.|$|E

5|$|Until 2007, US-89 {{followed}} State Street to North Temple (100 North), {{two blocks}} from the capitol, but now it turns at 400 South, following the former alignment of SR-186 and SR-176 west and north on 300 West, and rejoining its pre-2007 route at North Temple. In this area, modern US-89 runs for one block with the UTA TRAX Red Line in its median before crossing the TRAX line in Main Street's median, then passing the Frank E. Moss United States Courthouse, Pioneer Park, the historic Warehouse District at Pierpont Avenue, Japantown, EnergySolutions Arena, the Arena TRAX station, the Triad Center, and West High School. As it leaves downtown, 300 West curves northwesterly and becomes Beck Street, meeting the modern terminus of SR-186 at Victory Road at <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> Capitol Hill.|$|E
5|$|Pipistrellus raceyi is a {{small to}} {{medium-sized}} pipistrelle. It is long-furred and the body is reddish above, with the head a trifle darker, and yellowish-brown below. The glandular swellings on the muzzle, next to the nose, are hairless. The dark, short, round ears bear three to five ridges. The crescent-shaped tragus (a projection {{on the inner side}} of the outer ear) is about half as long as the ear and contains a slight constriction on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> its base. The wings are dark. The third through fifth metacarpals (hand bones) are about equally long, but the first phalange (finger bone) on the third finger is short. P.endoi has a longer first phalange on the third metacarpal. P.raceyi has short tibiae (lower leg bones) and small feet and the tail is shorter than the head and body. Forearm length is 28.0 to 31.2mm (1.10 to 1.23in), tail length is 22.9 to 30.3mm (0.90 to 1.19in), hindfoot length is 5.3 to 7.5mm (0.21 to 0.30in), and ear length is 7.5 to 10.6mm (0.30 to 0.42in) in 13 measured specimens. Females average slightly larger than males.|$|E
5|$|The talonid {{contains}} a hypoconid, hypoconulid, and entoconid and is much {{wider than the}} trigonid because the hypoconid is displaced buccally. A cristid obliqua descends from the hypoconid and reaches the protoconid. Although a crest, the postmetacristid, descends from <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the metaconid, ending in a small cusp, the metastylid, it is separated from the entoconid by a notch. The living colugos lack such a strong postmetacristid. The hypoconulid is near the back lingual margin of the tooth, behind the entoconid. In D.major, this cusp is further to the back than in both D.chimaera and the Sunda colugo, while the two cusps are merged in the Philippine colugo. In D.chimaera, a low crest, the post-hypoconulid cristid, reaches from the hypoconulid to the back lingual corner of the tooth, where a small cuspule, the distocuspid, is located. A long crest, the postcristid, connects the distocuspid to the hypoconid along the posterior side of the tooth. The Philippine colugo is similar, but in D.major, both the distocuspid and the post-hypoconulid cristid are absent, and the Sunda colugo has a weaker distocuspid and a postcristid that does not reach further lingually than the hypoconulid.|$|E

50|$|The cloud-forest {{pygmy owl}} is {{quite similar to}} {{temperate}} forms of Costa Rican pygmy owl (Glaucidium costaricanum), Andean pygmy owl (G. jardinii) and Yungas pygmy owl (G. bolivianum), but it is heavier and has a shorter tail. Besides, it has minimal or complete lack of pale spotting or barring on <b>the</b> <b>back,</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chest and flanks. In contrast with the similar appearing Costa Rican pygmy owl, its “false eyespots” are bordered with white in all non-rufous individuals.|$|R
40|$|In {{creating}} his {{gravitational field}} equations Einstein unjustifiedly assumed that inertial mass, and its energy equivalent, {{is a source}} of gravity. Denying this assumption allows modifying the field equations to a form in which a positive cosmological constant appears as a uniform density of gravitationally repulsive matter. Field equations with both positive and negative active gravitational mass densities incorporated along with a scalar field coupled to geometry with nostandard polarity yield cosmological solutions that exhibit acceleration, inflation, coasting, and a 'big bounce' instead of a 'big bang'. The repulsive matter is identified as <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 'drainholes' (called by some 'traversable wormholes') introduced by the author in 1973, solutions of the same field equations, which attract on their high, front sides and repel more strongly on their low, <b>back</b> <b>sides.</b> <b>The</b> front sides serve as the unseen particles of 'dark matter' needed to hold together the large scale structures seen in the universe. Formation of cosmic voids, walls, filaments, and nodes are attributed to separation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drainholes from the front, driven by their mutual attractive-repulsive interactions. One can assert that all of these cosmological entities have been found wrapped in one neat package, namely, the field equations and the variational principle from which they are derived...|$|R

25|$|By {{the end of}} 2009, more names {{had been}} {{submitted}} for engraving than could be accommodated on the original wall. In light of this, the Town of Tonawanda chose to initiate a second phase of construction to expand the memorial. That expansion {{took the form of}} a semicircular wall surrounding <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the existing memorial, adding space for up to 2,500 additional names across 30 new granite plaques. Construction began in the spring of 2010 with workers carefully orchestrating the installation of the new wall around existing memorial fixtures.|$|E
25|$|During the Santa Ana winds, large ocean waves can develop. These waves {{come from}} a northeasterly direction; toward the {{normally}} sheltered side of Catalina Island. Protected harbors such as Avalon and Two Harbors are normally sheltered and the waters within the harbors are very calm. In strong Santa Ana conditions, these harbors develop high surf and strong winds that can tear boats from their moorings and crash them onto the shore. During a Santa Ana, it is advised that boaters moor on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the island to avoid the dangerous conditions of the front side.|$|E
25|$|Following the Challenger disaster, {{examination}} of the recovered vehicle cockpit revealed {{that three of the}} crew members Personal Egress Air Packs were activated: those of Onizuka, mission specialist Judith Resnik, and pilot Michael Smith. The location of Smith's activation switch, on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> his seat, means that either Resnik or Onizuka could have activated it for him. This is the only evidence available from the disaster that shows Onizuka and Resnik were alive after the cockpit separated from the vehicle. However, if the cabin had lost pressure, the packs alone would not have sustained the crew during the two-minute descent.|$|E
30|$|For FRCCs, the {{fracture}} energy of PVASCC and PESCC {{is greater than}} that of SCC, which shows the influence of hybrid macro and micro fiber on FRCC flexural performance. Additionally, comparing the flexural performance of FRCCs to that of the plain specimens, {{the fracture}} energy of FRCCs is significantly larger than that of NHC and NCC. By having increased fracture energy, FRCCs have superior resistance to local damage under contact explosions, which suppresses the propagation of wide radial cracks to <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> panels.|$|R

The second 1920 version has more distinctive feathering on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the pendant. The engraving on the 1930 version is especially fine. In 1933, BSA was removed from all of the Eagle Scout insignia, including the medal. In 1955 the obverse of the eagle pendant was made flat so it could be engraved. BSA was added back to the front and the reverse was returned to a full feathered design in 1969.|$|E
25|$|Front Street – The final {{component}} of Adriaen's Landing, 'Front Street', {{sits across from}} the Convention Center and covers the land between Columbus Boulevard and The Hartford Times Building.
