50|$|Urbanomics {{describes}} the city formation phenomenon where economic priorities prevail {{to facilitate the}} city’s propensity to generate and accumulate wealth. Such city formation involves some irreversible spatial investments, massive resource allocations and financial investments recoverable only if anticipated future income transpires. Consequently, it is a pertinent concept in urban planning. Though related, {{this is not to}} be confused with urban economics where economic principles and <b>tools</b> <b>are</b> <b>applied</b> at macro and micro levels. Urbanomics is to be understood as a paradigm to understand impact of the globalization process on urban development.|$|E
50|$|Multipole {{radiation}} is {{a theoretical framework}} for the description of electromagnetic or gravitational radiation from time-dependent distributions of distant sources. These <b>tools</b> <b>are</b> <b>applied</b> to physical phenomena which occur {{at a variety of}} length scales - from gravitational waves due to galaxy collisions to gamma radiation resulting from nuclear decay. Multipole {{radiation is}} analyzed using similar multipole expansion techniques that describe fields from static sources, however there are important differences in the details of the analysis because multipole radiation fields behave quite differently from static fields. This article is primarily concerned with electromagnetic multipole radiation, although the treatment of gravitational waves is similar.|$|E

50|$|Some {{important}} {{studies with}} unsupervised learning {{with respect to}} fraud detection should be mentioned. For example, Bolton and Hand use Peer Group Analysis and Break Point Analysis applied on spending behaviour in credit card accounts. Peer Group Analysis detects individual objects that begin to behave in a way different from objects to which they had previously been similar. Another tool Bolton and Hand develop for behavioural fraud detection is Break Point Analysis. Unlike Peer Group Analysis, Break Point Analysis operates on the account level. A break point is an observation where anomalous behaviour for a particular account is detected. Both the <b>tools</b> <b>are</b> <b>applied</b> on spending behaviour in credit card accounts.|$|E
50|$|The goal of COSIC's {{research}} activities {{is to create}} a secure electronic equivalent for interactions in the physical world such as confidentiality, signatures, identification, anonymity, payment and elections. The research concentrates on the design, evaluation, and implementation of cryptographic algorithms and protocols, on the development of security architectures for information and communication systems and on the development of security mechanisms for embedded systems. COSIC's theoretical work is mainly based on discrete mathematics such as number theory, finite fields, Boolean algebra, but also includes statistics and optimization. The aim is to achieve efficient and secure solutions. The broader goal is to achieve efficient and secure multi-party computation.
