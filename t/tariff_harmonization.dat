These schemes will be based on compensatory mechanisms between countries, because of the costs incurred by international trade, and some degree of <b>tariff</b> <b>harmonization.</b> The paper describes and compares the transmission tariffs applied in each one of these countries for some representative case examples. The driving factors that may explain the different levels in the transmission tariffs are examined. Finally, regulatory recommendations regarding transmission <b>tariff</b> <b>harmonization</b> and the compensatory mechanisms to be implemented in the IEM are provided. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E
40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{linkages between}} trade and {{innovation in the}} chemicals sector, building on past work at the OECD on trade and innovation. The chemicals sector {{has a long history}} of innovation and is a large trading item. It covers very diverse sub-sectors. This paper analyses and compares different trade and innovation linkages in basic industrial chemicals, speciality and fine chemicals and consumer chemicals. This sector has also been a subject of successive rounds of multilateral trade negotiations, and partly as a consequence tariff rates have been reduced over time. Nonetheless remaining tariffs are still non-negligible and constitute impediments to trade. Export restrictive measures on raw material inputs are also being highlighted on the trade negotiating agenda. Moreover, the chemicals sector is heavily regulated for health and environmental reasons and further legislative initiatives have been pursued, whose practical impact on innovation remains to be seen. Intellectual property has played a very important role in technology diffusion in this sector, and infringement of intellectual property continues to be a major problem. innovation, intellectual property, technical barriers to trade, emerging economies, financial crisis, Chemicals <b>Tariff</b> <b>Harmonization</b> Agreement, environmental regulations, chemicals, multilateral trade negotiations, export restrictive measures...|$|E
40|$|Anglophone African {{countries}} have been implementing reform and modernization initiatives in their Customs administrations. This paper outlines the progression of key reform and modernization initiatives in these countries since the early 1990 s, and assesses the gap between these reforms and those of more modern Customs agencies. The review suggests that Customs administration reform and modernization initiatives in Anglophone African countries generally lag behind international good practice and {{it is necessary to}} speed up implementation if revenue, trade facilitation, and trade chain security objectives are to be achieved. The findings also have implications on the design of reform programs and focus of potential technical assistance for the outstanding reform agenda.

40|$|There {{have been}} income and welfare {{redistribution}} in Burkina and Senegal produced by fiscal reforms undertaken {{within the context}} of the West African Economic and Monetary Union where a unique VAT tax and common <b>tariffs</b> <b>harmonization</b> were adopted. The measure of redistributive effects and the costs of the horizontal iniquity generated by the new taxations shows that, although the reform is deemed positive for both countries, Burkina has more benefited from it. This is mainly explained by the relatively important place of fiscal evasion, by selfconsumption and the informal sector, and by the fact that most of the goods consumed by the poor households are not liable of taxation. The performances of tax systems have been improved, with an appreciable growth of the equality in the two countries, particularly for Burkina. The excess of fiscal revenues is more important after the reform, either for Senegal as for the Burkina...|$|R

40|$|As trade {{among members}} of the European Union (EU) is now free of <b>tariffs,</b> the <b>harmonization</b> of {{technical}} regulations or standards has become an important issue for deeper integration of the internal market. A previous analysis of the completion of the Single Market calculated that in 1996 about 80 % of intra-EU trade was been affected by harmonization of technical regulations. A major objective of this thesis is to examine to what extent harmonization of regulations has reduced the so called border effect. After a brief survey of the gravity literature, we propose and test some economic and econometric extensions of the standard gravity model. This model is then applied to total manufacturing as well as to more detailed levels corresponding to different harmonization approaches. We find that harmonization of technical regulations has a positive impact on imports of total manufacturing. However, this hardly explains the importance of border effects within the EU. This result is supported at a more disaggregated level when we distinguish between manufacturing sectors according to the type of EU harmonization including the category where technical barriers do not apply. In addition, sectors where harmonization is of minor importance exhibit smaller border effects. The last part of the thesis examines, with particular reference to EU and enlargement, how environmental regulations at the national and EU level have collided and affected exports. The major findings are that more harmonization has been accompanied by higher levels of domestic environmental regulations in candidate countries. In addition, the level of domestic environmental regulations - when treated endogenously - has a larger negative effect on EU exports. We employ a newly constructed data set that contains information at the three digit level of manufacturing industries. For each industry we identify the dominant harmonization approach used by the European Commission to the removal of technical barriers to trade in the EU. (ECON 3) [...] UCL, 200...|$|R
40|$|Regional {{integration}} {{has been}} seen in Africa {{as a means of}} encouraging trade and securing economies of scale. This paper examines in detail the prospects and challenges for trade expansion in the two most prominent arrangements in eastern and southern Africa: the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) and the Southern African Development Community (SADC). It finds that possibilities of growth in intraregional trade may be limited, but that the two arrangements offer opportunities for member countries to gain policy credibility for trade reforms and tariff liberalization and to address structural weaknesses. In this regard, the negotiation of the Economic Partnership Agreements with the European Union can also have a significant impact.

40|$|Developing {{countries}} {{have an important}} stake in products which have relatively high post-Tokyo MFN tariff rates in developed market economy countries (DMECs). On the whole, their market share is greater in higher tariff imports and, consequently, reductions which cut high tariffs more than lower ones, e. g. by applying <b>tariff</b> ceilings or <b>harmonization</b> formulae, are {{in the interest of}} developing countries. They would benefit from such MFN reductions despite erosions in their existing preference margins. This is due to relatively narrower product coverage of GSP schemes and smaller preference margins in higher tariff imports - other than the schemes for the least developed countries. Therefore, complementing MFN reductions with broadening the product coverage of GSP schemes in high tariff items and deepening the preference margins in certain markets would significantly enhance the exports of developing countries. Tariff liberalization and improved GSP product coverage and margins in higher tariff items would do very little to developing countries, however, if NTMs were not relaxed to accommodate the potential gains from tariffs. The frequency and trade coverage of NTMs in DMECs affecting high tariff items are significantly greater compared to their overall imports. Furthermore, NTMs substantially discriminate imports from developing countries in high tariff products. Therefore, tariff liberalization schemes which are confined to products not currently covered by NTMs would not yield any noteworthy results for developing countries. This is to say that unless some action is taken in the field of NTMs, no significant expansion of trade can be expected through tariff reductions, not even in the high tariff items. Furthermore, if the relaxation of NTMs is only limited to the accommodation of potential trade expansion through tariff liberalization, even complete elimination of tariffs would only yield meager results. This overall picture is especially bleak for certain sectors, notably labour intensive manufactures such as textiles and clothing and miscellaneous manufactures. In some sectors, particularly in food products, the observations are diluted due to the extreme restrictiveness of some DMECs' trade regimes. Hence, the conclusion to draw is that the importance of liberalization of high tariff products for developing countries can be grossly understated as these evaluations are based on trade which is significantly curtailed by NTMs. ¬†Published in connection with a visit at the IIES...|$|R
