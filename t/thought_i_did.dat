500|$|Bangerz is {{primarily}} a pop album, which also integrates elements of hip hop, synthpop, and country music. During an interview on The Ellen DeGeneres Show on October 10, host Ellen DeGeneres asked Cyrus if the record was inspired by her relationship with Liam Hemsworth, to which she replied [...] "the whole album {{is a story of}} that and I think it says that starting with [...] "Adore You" [...] and ending with [...] "Someone Else" ..... I think I knew more intuitively where my life was going than I actually <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> at the time." ...|$|E
500|$|Many {{critics of}} the time and since have {{declared}} it Cagney's best film, drawing parallels between Cohan and Cagney; they both began their careers in vaudeville, struggled for years before reaching the peak of their profession, were surrounded with family and married early, and both had a wife who was happy to sit back while he went on to stardom. The film was nominated for eight Academy Awards and won three, including Cagney's for Best Actor. In his acceptance speech, Cagney said, [...] "I've always maintained that in this business, you're {{only as good as the}} other fellow thinks you are. It's nice to know that you people <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> a good job. And don't forget that it was a good part, too." ...|$|E

500|$|During an {{interview}} on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in October 2013, host Ellen DeGeneres asked Cyrus if Bangerz was inspired by her relationship with Liam Hemsworth, to which she replied [...] "the whole album {{is a story of}} that and I think it says that starting with 'Adore You' and ending with 'Someone Else' ..... I think I knew more intuitively where my life was going than I actually <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> at the time." [...] Elysa Gardner of USA Today thought of [...] "Someone Else" [...] as a more [...] "reflective" [...] lyrical offering from its parent record, while Lipshutz interpreted the track to detail the departure of Cyrus' [...] "past baggage" [...] and the introduction of [...] "her new self". Dan DeLuca from The Philadelphia Inquirer assumed that the song was designed to address her transition from her innocent Hannah Montana image and then-recent breakup with fiance Liam Hemsworth; from a production standpoint, he jokingly referenced Cyrus' earlier single [...] "We Can't Stop" [...] when mentioning that [...] " [...] her party and she can do what she wants", in regards to the increasingly diverse genres she had begun experimenting with. Los Angeles Times Mikael Wood opined that it spoke of the [...] "psychic damage" [...] that comes with prosperity in the entertainment industry. Based on the line [...] "if you're looking for love know that love don't live here anymore" [...] from the refrain, David Drake and David Bry from Complex opined that Cyrus' track was [...] "thematically" [...] similar to [...] "Love Don't Live Here Anymore" [...] by Rose Royce.|$|E
500|$|... "Suede and America fuelled {{my desire}} to prove to {{everyone}} that Blur were worth it", Albarn told Mojo in 2000, [...] "There was nothing more important in my life." [...] Albarn felt the popularity American grunge music was enjoying in Britain at the time would soon run out of steam, and argued that Blur would embody a renaissance of classic British pop on their next album. Although the singer felt Blur had finally found their musical identity, not everybody was convinced with Albarn's new British-centric manifesto. Food Records owner David Balfe, in particular, strongly disagreed, and got into fierce arguments with Albarn over the proposed change in Blur's image. After the still-sceptical Balfe finally relented, Food warily gave Blur the go-ahead {{to work on their}} second album with Albarn's first choice of producer, Andy Partridge of XTC. Blur and Partridge began work at The Church, a studio in Crouch End owned by keyboardist Dave Stewart. However, the pairing didn't work out. Bassist Alex James described the sessions as a [...] "disaster"; he added that [...] "as it was all being put together, they were all good parts, but it just wasn't ... sexy". Partridge said in 1999 of the sessions: [...] "I felt quite fatherly and I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> sterling work. They got Dave ‘Twat’ Balfe really stoned to listen to some mixes and he was rolling around going, ‘This is fantastic, you're George Martin and they're The Beatles.’ Next day he'd say, ‘Quite frankly, Andy, this is shit.’" [...] The band successfully recorded four songs, but they were wary about working in the same conditions again.|$|E

We did come across disagreements, but they were very healthy." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{went on with}} my day's {{business}} tranquilly; {{but ever}} and anon vague suggestions kept wandering across my brain of reasons why I should quit Thornfield; and I kept involuntarily framing advertisements and pondering conjectures about new situations: these <b>thoughts</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not think to check; they might germinate and bear fruit if they could.|$|R

2500|$|Although {{he might}} by today's terms {{be called a}} seamer, back then Shaw was {{fundamentally}} a length bowler, holding a line on or just outside the off-stump: certainly, he often employed the off-theory, {{with as many as}} eight fielders patrolling the offside. His run-up was made up of six rapid, economical steps, but, according to the man himself, [...] "I really used to bowl faster than people <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> and I could make the ball break both ways, but not much. In my opinion, length and variation of pace constitute the secret of successful bowling." [...] However, although he was regarded almost universally as [...] "the high priest of length", he and Ted Peate together poured scorn all over suggestions that they were capable of [...] "hitting the spot" [...] with nearly every delivery (as was the common perception).|$|E
2500|$|Liberati's {{system of}} {{acquiring}} his style {{is founded on}} the bedrock of virtuosoship: persevering, persistent, faithful work of the severest nature. With a determination and energy truly admirable he devoted all his spare moments to practice. His {{first step was to}} perfect the 'attack of the tone.' Then, with a metronome as his guide in tempo, he practiced scales in all keys—always in a light staccato—until he could play them with absolute precision, in both time and tune. He stated, [...] "You may think you play a scale perfectly but try it with a metronome and you will find out that you don't. I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> until I began practicing with a metronome." [...] Although then regarded as an artist, Liberati learned that he could not play a simple scale with evenness, but by diligence he gained the point he sought. He was forced to begin at a slow tempo but gradually increasing it, he rapidly acquired the desired precision at any tempo he found necessary.|$|E
2500|$|Stokes {{scored a}} goal {{in each of}} Celtic's first two league games of the season, 3–0 and 6–1 wins over St Johnstone and Dundee United respectively. [...] However {{over the course of}} the season Stokes scored fewer goals than in {{previous}} seasons, mainly due to new manager Ronny Deila fielding him in a wide left role as opposed to his more recognised position as a striker. [...] Stokes' form at this time was often unimpressive, drawing criticism from supporters, and he was also disciplined by the club after he returned to Celtic late from a trip to his home city of Dublin. [...] Stokes continued to feature on the left wing for Celtic though, and it was from his cross that Kris Commons scored the opening goal on 15 March 2015 in Celtic's 2–0 win over Dundee United in the League Cup Final. [...] He commented after the final, [...] "I do need to show that I can still bring something to the team and I <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> that today. I felt fresher and sharper. I thought I contributed." [...] A few days later, Stokes provided the assist for Jason Denayer's opening goal in a 4–0 win over Dundee United in a Scottish Cup quarter-final replay at Parkhead. [...] However, Stokes was sent off later in the same game for elbowing United's Paul Paton.|$|E
