5|$|By 1969, WMATA {{had decided}} on the current routing and stations, except for the {{extension}} beyond Rockville to Shady Grove. Montgomery County officials opposed ending <b>the</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Line</b> in downtown Rockville, saying it would cause congestion {{in the area and}} use scarce vacant land for a storage yard. Metro decided to propose to extend <b>the</b> <b>red</b> <b>line</b> one more station to Shady Grove and the U.S. Department of Transportation conditionally approved funding for the extension on July 26, 1975. Construction on <b>the</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Line</b> began with a groundbreaking ceremony on December 9, 1969. Construction proved difficult because the National Park Service prohibited a bridge across Rock Creek and required that <b>the</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Line</b> tunnel under that valley, the tunnel in turn caused both the Dupont Circle and Woodley Park stations to be built further underground. <b>The</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Line</b> was proposed to tunnel under Yuma Street from Connecticut Avenue to Wisconsin Avenue, but local residents sued and that court case delayed construction of the tunnel for two years, then WMATA finally won the right to build the tunnel there.|$|E

50|$|In 1977, the Redline Wheel was phased out, with <b>the</b> <b>red</b> <b>lines</b> being erased {{from the}} wheels. This cut costs, but also {{reflected}} that <b>the</b> <b>red</b> <b>lines</b> popularized during <b>the</b> era of muscle cars and Polyglas tires {{were no longer}} current. During this period, there was a trend away from wild hot rods and fictitious cars and a move to more realistic cars and trucks.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Line</b> begins {{above ground}} at Shady Grove, and {{parallels}} CSX Transportation's Metropolitan Subdivision (served by MARC Brunswick Line trains) to south of Twinbrook. <b>The</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Line</b> then enters a tunnel and curves west to run under Rockville Pike at White Flint. Until Tenleytown, <b>the</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Line</b> follows {{the route of}} Rockville Pike and Wisconsin Avenue, in a tunnel except for a bridge over the Washington Beltway (I-495). The tunnel curves east at Tenleytown into Yuma Street to reach the Van Ness-UDC station, curving south there under Connecticut Avenue to south of Farragut Square. A curve under Lafayette Park takes the tunnel east under G Street Northwest through the Metro Center station and the Gallery Place – Chinatown station.|$|E

5|$|Aside {{from his}} career in hockey, Ross was {{interested}} in improving the game. Prior {{to the start of}} the 1927–28 season, the NHL adopted a new style of goal net created by Ross. With the back molded into a B-shape, it was better designed to catch pucks and the net was used until 1984, when a modified version was adopted. He also improved the design of the puck. Ross' design had bevel edges, which prevented it bouncing too much, and used synthetic rubber, rather than the natural rubber previously in vogue. Along with New York Rangers coach Frank Boucher, Ross helped to create <b>the</b> <b>red</b> <b>line,</b> which was introduced to help speed up the game by removing the ability for defenders to pass the puck from the defensive to offensive zone; until 2006 it was against the rules of hockey to make a two line pass. More scoring chances resulted as teams could not simply send the puck down the ice with impunity. In order to help tell <b>the</b> <b>red</b> <b>line</b> and blue lines apart on television, Ross suggested that <b>the</b> <b>red</b> <b>line</b> be striped.|$|E

5|$|MetroLink began {{service on}} July 31, 1993, {{with the opening}} of <b>the</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Line</b> segment from North Hanley to 5th & Missouri. An infill station at East Riverfront and an {{extension}} to Lambert–St. Louis International Airport opened in 1994, followed by a second station at the airport in 1998. Since then, the system has had two major expansions. The first expansion, known as the St. Clair County Extension, was completed on May 5, 2001, with the extension of <b>the</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Line</b> to Belleville, Illinois and two years later to Scott Air Force Base. The second major expansion, known as the Cross County Extension, was completed on August 26, 2006, with the addition of the Blue Line branch from Forest Park-DeBaliviere to Shrewsbury-Lansdowne I-44 via Clayton, Missouri.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Line</b> is {{the only}} line in the system that does not share its tracks with another Metrorail line. The Amtrak and MARC tracks do, however, run {{parallel}} to <b>the</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Line</b> tracks between Washington Union Station and Silver Spring {{as well as between}} Twinbrook and Shady Grove stations. These tracks used {{to be part of the}} former Batimore & Ohio Railroad route. MARC uses this parallel route when traveling between Washington and Martinsburg, West Virginia. Amtrak, on the other hand, uses this parallel route when traveling the Capitol Limited route between Washington and Chicago Union Station. Although MARC does stop at the Silver Spring and Rockville stations between Washington and West Virginia, Amtrak only stops at Rockville between Washington and Chicago.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Line</b> needs 44 trains (10 eight-car {{trains and}} 34 six-car trains, {{consisting}} of 284 rail cars) {{to run at}} peak capacity Trains leave at 6-minute intervals during the mid-day and 12-minute intervals during the evenings.|$|E

5|$|A second {{improvement}} project involves {{building a}} pedestrian tunnel to interconnect the Gallery Place station with Metro Center. A July 2005 study proposed connecting the eastern mezzanine of Metro Center {{with the western}} mezzanine of Gallery Place that are only one block apart.

As of 2011, the project remains unfunded.|$|E

Artyom escapes and races Pavel's forces to locate the Dark One and Anna, who has been kidnapped by Lesnitsky, an ex-Ranger and Red Line spy. En route, he finds a contingent of Red Line forces massacring the inhabitants of a station, supposedly to contain a mysterious epidemic. It was <b>the</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Line</b> that introduced the virus to the station – weaponized Ebola acquired from the D6 vault by Lesnitsky. Artyom finds Anna and frees her but they are exposed to the virus and are quarantined after rescue. Afraid that she will die, Anna seduces Artyom.|$|E

5|$|As {{a part of}} <b>the</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Line</b> Northwest Extension, Porter was {{included}} {{as one of the}} stations involved in the Arts on the Line program, devised to bring art into the MBTA's subway stations in the late 1970s and early 1980s. It was the first program {{of its kind in the}} United States and became the model for similar drives for art across the country.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of a 2006 {{settlement}} of a lawsuit filed by the Boston Center for Independent Living and a group of individuals, the MBTA installed additional elevators at Porter and four other busy MBTA subway stations. The elevator to <b>the</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Line</b> was out of service for 15 months beginning in March 2011 for car replacement and the installation of a second, redundant, elevator. An accessible shuttle bus ran between Porter and Davis.|$|E
