5000|$|... 1960: The {{first modern}} heel-and-toe binding for alpine skiing was the Cubco binding, first {{introduced}} in 1950 but not popular until about 1960. A heel-release binding faced {{the problem that}} there was no obvious place <b>to</b> <b>attach</b> <b>to</b> on <b>the</b> <b>heel,</b> so <b>the</b> Cubco solved this by screwing small metal clips into the sole of the boot. This also eliminated the changes in performance as the sole of the boot wore down, or the geometry of the sole changed as the boot wore into the skiers foot. Marker introduced the Rotomat, which gripped onto the sole where it extended past <b>the</b> <b>heel,</b> and Look quickly followed suit with their Grand Prix design. By the mid-1960s, release bindings that worked on both <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> and <b>the</b> toe were common, and by the late 1960s, the cable binding had disappeared from alpine skiing.|$|R
50|$|The calf (Latin: sura) is {{the back}} {{portion of the}} lower leg in human anatomy. The muscles within the calf {{correspond}} to the posterior compartment of the leg. The two largest muscles within this compartment are known together as the calf muscle and <b>attach</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> via <b>the</b> Achilles tendon. Several other, smaller muscles <b>attach</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> knee, the ankle, and via long tendons to the toes.|$|R
5000|$|The Achilles tendon is {{the muscle}} tendon of the triceps surae, a [...] "three-headed" [...] group of muscles—the soleus {{and the two}} heads of the gastrocnemius. The main {{function}} of the triceps surae is plantar flexion, i.e. to stretch the foot downward. It {{is accompanied by a}} [...] "fourth head", the slight plantaris muscle, the long slender tendon of which is also <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> bone but not visible.|$|R
5000|$|The term fiador {{refers to}} {{different}} styles of equipment {{in different parts of}} the western hemisphere. In the United States and Canada, the fiador is a type of throatlatch used on heavier styles of bosal hackamore. [...] This design crosses over the horse's head at the poll, with a knot under <b>the</b> jawbone, and <b>attaches</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hackamore at the noseband or bosal. The knot under the jaw is usually a fiador knot, and the fiador may have a second fiador knot at the point where it <b>attaches</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> knot of <b>the</b> bosal.|$|R
50|$|The effigy of Richard Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick in the Collegiate Church of St Mary, Warwick, {{show how}} 15th century Italian-style sabatons {{would have been}} worn. These consist of a toe cap, four {{articulated}} lames, a foot plate and ankle plate, and a hinged heel cap, joined with buckled straps. Although the spurs are missing from the effigy, remains of rivet holes and staples may represent {{the way that the}} spurs would have been directly <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> cap of <b>the</b> sabaton, rather than being strapped on afterwards.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Gait {{analysis}} is commonly done in gait laboratories, where several gait variables are estimated using measurement systems {{installed in the}} laboratory. The major drawback of these measurement systems is their restriction to the laboratory. This study shows the possibilities of an ambulatory measurement system: the forceshoe. The forceshoe consists of an orthopaedic sandal with force/moment sensors and inertial sensors <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> and <b>the</b> forefoot. Ankle and foot dynamics as well as center of mass movement have been estimated. Moreover, the ambulatory system {{has been compared to}} a reference system consisting of an optical position measurement system and two force plates.

5000|$|Spurs {{are usually}} held on by a leather or leather-like strap, called a spur strap, that {{goes over the}} {{arch of the foot}} and under the sole in front of <b>the</b> boot <b>heel.</b> Some western designs have a leather strap that goes only over the top, with a heel chain or a rubber [...] "tiedown" [...] instead of a strap under the boot. There are also styles with no straps where <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> band is simply very tight and slips on wedged between <b>the</b> sole and <b>heel</b> of <b>the</b> boot. Some spur designs have a slot for running the spur strap through, others have [...] "buttons," [...] {{sometimes}} on <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> band itself and sometimes <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> band by hinges, that allow a strap with buttonholes <b>to</b> be <b>attached.</b>|$|R
500|$|Spurs were {{commonly}} used throughout the period, especially by knights, with whom they were regularly associated. [...] A young man {{was said to have}} [...] "won his spurs" [...] when he achieved knighthood. [...] Wealthy knights and riders frequently wore decorated and filigreed spurs. <b>Attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rider's <b>heel</b> by straps, spurs could be used both to encourage horses to quickly move forward or to direct lateral movement. [...] Early spurs had a short shanks or [...] "neck", placing the rowel relatively close to the rider's heel; further developments in the spur shape lengthened the neck, making it easier to touch the horse with less leg movement {{on the part of the}} rider.|$|R
40|$|Gyroscopes {{have been}} used in {{previous}} studies to measure the peak angular velocity of the shoe or foot in the frontal plane (evVel). However, {{it is not clear whether}} different test conditions (footwear hardness or locomotion speed) can influence the accuracy of evVel. The purpose of the present study was to compare the accuracy of gyroscopes and electrogoniometers when measuring evVel and the time until evVel (t_evVel) in 12 different conditions using a single axis gyroscope <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> cap. Twenty-four recreational runners were instructed to walk and run on a 15 -m indoor track at four locomotion speeds (1. 5, 2. 5, and 3. 5 m/s, and individual running speed) and in three footwear conditions (low to high hardness). The gyroscope data and electrogoniometer data were sampled at a rate of 1000 Hz. Comparisons between both measurement devices showed small mean differences up to 49. 8 ± 46. 9 deg/s for evVel and up to 5. 3 ± 3. 5 ms for t_evVel. Furthermore, strong relationships between gyroscope and electrogoniometer data were found for evVel as well as for t_evVel for all conditions. It can be concluded that gyroscopes can be used to accurately determine evVel and t_evVel under a variety of conditions...|$|R

5000|$|... 1894: Fritz R. Huitfeldt {{invented a}} binding with a secure toe iron which allowed <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> to move freely. This became the {{standard}} industry binding through the 1930s. Huitfeldt drove {{the evolution of}} the ski binding over the next 20 years. In 1894, he introduced the use of semi-circular metal hooks at <b>the</b> toe <b>to</b> <b>attach</b> <b>the</b> straps. The hooks were positioned to tightly fit to the sides of the boot, keeping the ski centred and eliminating any [...] "flop" [...] that the formerly loose straps allowed. <b>The</b> <b>heel</b> strap was also <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> same hooks, but because of their rounded shape, the required range of motion was provided by the straps sliding {{up and down on the}} hooks. This allowed <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> strap to be replaced by a less flexible leather strap. Together, these changes dramatically tightened the binding, greatly increasing control.|$|R
