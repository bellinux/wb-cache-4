5|$|Heparin-induced {{thrombocytopenia}} (HIT) is {{the development}} of thrombocytopenia (a low platelet count), due to the administration of various forms of heparin, an anticoagulant. HIT predisposes to <b>thrombosis</b> (the abnormal formation of blood clots inside a blood vessel) because platelets release microparticles that activate thrombin, thereby leading to <b>thrombosis.</b> When <b>thrombosis</b> is identified the condition is called heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and <b>thrombosis</b> (HITT). HIT is caused by the formation of abnormal antibodies that activate platelets. If someone receiving heparin develops new or worsening <b>thrombosis,</b> or if the platelet count falls, HIT can be confirmed with specific blood tests.|$|E
5|$|Thrombophilia (sometimes {{hypercoagulability}} or a prothrombotic state) is an abnormality {{of blood}} coagulation {{that increases the}} risk of <b>thrombosis</b> (blood clots in blood vessels). Such abnormalities can be identified in 50% of people who have an episode of <b>thrombosis</b> (such as deep vein <b>thrombosis</b> in the leg) that was not provoked by other causes. A significant proportion of the population has a detectable abnormality, but most of these only develop <b>thrombosis</b> in the presence of an additional risk factor.|$|E
5|$|Venous <b>thrombosis</b> {{may also}} occur in more unusual places: in the veins of the brain, liver (portal vein <b>thrombosis</b> and hepatic vein <b>thrombosis),</b> {{mesenteric}} vein, kidney (renal vein <b>thrombosis)</b> and the veins of the arms. Whether thrombophilia also {{increases the risk}} of arterial <b>thrombosis</b> (which is the underlying cause of heart attacks and strokes) is less well established.|$|E
5|$|The first {{description}} of <b>thrombosis</b> of the cerebral veins and sinuses {{is attributed to}} the French physician Ribes, who in 1825 observed <b>thrombosis</b> of the saggital sinus and cerebral veins in {{a man who had}} suffered from seizures and delirium. Until {{the second half of the}} 20th century it remained a diagnosis generally made after death. In the 1940s, reports by Dr Charles Symonds and others allowed for the clinical diagnosis of cerebral venous <b>thrombosis,</b> using characteristic signs and symptoms and results of lumbar puncture.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} symptom of HIT is {{enlargement}} or extension of a previously diagnosed blood clot, or {{the development of}} a new blood clot elsewhere in the body. This may take the form of clots either in arteries or veins, causing arterial or venous <b>thrombosis,</b> respectively. Examples of arterial <b>thrombosis</b> are stroke, myocardial infarction ("heart attack"), and acute leg ischemia. Venous <b>thrombosis</b> may occur in the leg or arm in the form of deep vein <b>thrombosis</b> (DVT) and in the lung in the form of a pulmonary embolism (PE); the latter usually originate in the leg but migrate to the lung.|$|E
5|$|A {{fibrinogen}} uptake {{test was}} formerly {{used to detect}} deep vein <b>thrombosis.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{very small}} {{proportion}} (those affected by SMAD4 (MADH4) mutations, see below) have multiple benign polyps {{in the large}} intestine, which may bleed or transform into colorectal cancer. A similarly small proportion experiences pulmonary hypertension, a state in which the pressure in the lung arteries is increased, exerting pressure {{on the right side}} of the heart and causing peripheral edema (swelling of the legs), fainting and attacks of chest pain. It has been observed that the risk of <b>thrombosis</b> (particularly venous <b>thrombosis,</b> in the form of deep vein <b>thrombosis</b> or pulmonary embolism) may be increased. There is a suspicion that those with HHT may have a mild immunodeficiency and are therefore at a slightly increased risk from infections.|$|E
5|$|Cancer, {{particularly}} when metastatic (spread {{to other places}} in the body), is a recognised risk factor for <b>thrombosis.</b> A number of mechanisms have been proposed, such as activation of the coagulation system by cancer cells or secretion of procoagulant substances. Furthermore, particular cancer treatments (such as the use of central venous catheters for chemotherapy) may increase the risk of <b>thrombosis</b> further.|$|E
5|$|Cerebral venous sinus <b>thrombosis</b> (CVST) is the {{presence}} of acute <b>thrombosis</b> (a blood clot) in the dural venous sinuses, which drain blood from the brain. Symptoms may include headache, abnormal vision, any of the symptoms of stroke such as weakness of the face and limbs {{on one side of the}} body, and seizures. The diagnosis is usually by computed tomography (CT/CAT scan) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) employing radiocontrast to demonstrate obstruction of the venous sinuses by thrombus.|$|E
5|$|Deep vein <b>thrombosis,</b> or deep venous <b>thrombosis</b> (DVT), is the {{formation}} of a blood clot (thrombus) within a deep vein, most commonly the legs. Nonspecific signs may include pain, swelling, redness, warmness, and engorged superficial veins. Pulmonary embolism, a potentially life-threatening complication, is caused by the detachment (embolization) of a clot that travels to the lungs. Together, DVT and pulmonary embolism constitute a single disease process known as venous thromboembolism. Post-thrombotic syndrome, another complication, significantly contributes to the health-care cost of DVT.|$|E
5|$|In 1856, German {{physician}} and pathologist Rudolf Virchow published what {{is referred to}} as Virchow's triad, the three major causes of <b>thrombosis.</b> The triad provides the theoretical framework for the current explanation of venous <b>thrombosis,</b> although it was focused on the effect of a foreign body in the venous system and the conditions required for clot propagation.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to its effects on <b>thrombosis,</b> hypercoagulable states may accelerate the development of atherosclerosis, the arterial disease that underlies myocardial infarction {{and other forms of}} cardiovascular disease.|$|E
5|$|Once {{dissection}} has occurred, two mechanisms {{contribute to}} the development of stroke symptoms. Firstly, the flow through the blood vessel may be disrupted due to the accumulation of blood under the vessel wall, leading to ischemia (insufficient blood supply). Secondly, irregularities in the vessel wall and turbulence increase the risk of <b>thrombosis</b> (the formation of blood clots) and embolism (migration) of these clots of the brain. From various lines of evidence, it appears that <b>thrombosis</b> and embolism is the predominant problem.|$|E
5|$|Pregnancy is {{associated}} with an increased risk of <b>thrombosis.</b> This probably results from a physiological hypercoagulability in pregnancy that protects against postpartum hemorrhage.|$|E
5|$|The {{inability}} to compress the vein {{is one of}} the more reliable indications of venous <b>thrombosis.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} behind arterial <b>thrombosis,</b> such as {{with heart}} attacks, is more established than {{the steps that}} cause venous <b>thrombosis.</b> With arterial <b>thrombosis,</b> blood vessel wall damage is required, as it initiates coagulation, but clotting in the veins mostly occurs without any such damage. The beginning of venous <b>thrombosis</b> {{is thought to be}} caused by tissue factor, which leads to conversion of prothrombin to thrombin, followed by fibrin deposition. Red blood cells and fibrin are the main components of venous thrombi, and the fibrin appears to attach to the blood vessel wall lining (endothelium), a surface that normally acts to prevent clotting. Platelets and white blood cells are also components. Platelets are not as prominent in venous clots as they are in arterial ones, but they may play a role. Inflammation is associated with VTE, and white blood cells {{play a role in the}} formation and resolution of venous clots.|$|E
5|$|The {{veins of}} the brain, both the {{superficial}} veins {{and the deep}} venous system, empty into the dural venous sinuses, which carry blood back to the jugular vein and thence to the heart. In cerebral venous sinus <b>thrombosis,</b> blood clots usually form both in the veins {{of the brain and}} the venous sinuses. The <b>thrombosis</b> of the veins themselves causes venous infarction—damage to brain tissue due to a congested and therefore insufficient blood supply. This results in cerebral edema (both vasogenic and cytotoxic edema), and leads to small petechial haemorrhages that may merge into large haematomas. <b>Thrombosis</b> of the sinuses is the main mechanism behind the increase in intracranial pressure due to decreased resorption of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The condition does not lead to hydrocephalus, however, because there is no difference in pressure between various parts of the brain.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{acquired}} conditions augment {{the risk of}} <b>thrombosis.</b> A prominent example is antiphospholipid syndrome, which is caused by antibodies against constituents of the cell membrane, particularly lupus anticoagulant (first found in people with the disease systemic lupus erythematosus but often detected in people without the disease), anti-cardiolipin antibodies, and anti-β2-glycoprotein 1 antibodies; it is therefore regarded as an autoimmune disease. In some cases antiphospholipid syndrome can cause arterial as well as venous <b>thrombosis.</b> It is also more strongly associated with miscarriage, and can cause {{a number of other}} symptoms (such as livedo reticularis of the skin and migraine).|$|E
5|$|Improvements on the {{diagnosis}} of cerebral venous sinus <b>thrombosis</b> in life were made {{with the introduction of}} venography in 1951, which also aided in the distinction from idiopathic intracranial hypertension, which has similar presenting signs and symptoms in many cases.|$|E
5|$|In most patients, {{the direct}} {{cause for the}} {{cerebral}} sinus <b>thrombosis</b> is not readily apparent. Identifying a source of infection is crucial; it is common practice to screen for various forms of thrombophilia (a propensity to form blood clots).|$|E
5|$|Medroxyprogesterone acetate, a progestin, {{has been}} shown to improve the {{ventilatory}} response, but this has been poorly studied and is associated with an increased risk of <b>thrombosis.</b> Similarly, the drug acetazolamide can reduce bicarbonate levels, and thereby augment to normal ventilatory response, but this has been researched insufficiently to recommend wide application.|$|E
5|$|Obesity {{has long}} been {{regarded}} as {{a risk factor for}} venous <b>thrombosis.</b> It more than doubles the risk in numerous studies, particularly in combination with the use of oral contraceptives or in the period after surgery. Various coagulation abnormalities have been described in the obese. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, an inhibitor of fibrinolysis, is present in higher levels in people with obesity. Obese people also have larger numbers of circulating microvesicles (fragments of damaged cells) that bear tissue factor. Platelet aggregation may be increased, and there are higher levels of coagulation proteins such as von Willebrand factor, fibrinogen, factor VII and factor VIII. Obesity also increases the risk of recurrence after an initial episode of <b>thrombosis.</b>|$|E
5|$|On March 5, 2007, Cheney {{was treated}} for deep-vein <b>thrombosis</b> in his left leg at George Washington University Hospital after {{experiencing}} pain in his left calf. Doctors prescribed blood-thinning medication and allowed {{him to return to}} work. CBS News reported that during the morning of November 26, 2007, Cheney was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation and underwent treatment that afternoon.|$|E
5|$|Protease {{inhibitory}} {{activity in}} blood plasma was first {{reported in the}} late 1800s, {{but it was not}} until the 1950s that the serpins antithrombin and alpha 1-antitrypsin were isolated. Initial research focused on their role in human disease: alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency is one of the most common genetic disorders, causing emphysema, and antithrombin deficiency results in <b>thrombosis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Smith died of {{coronary}} <b>thrombosis</b> in September 1940. He {{was buried in}} the Jewish section of Fawkner Cemetery with full military honours. His Victoria Cross was sold by his family in 1990 and later auctioned as part of a collection of Smith's medals, selling for approximately £30,000 (US$60,000).|$|E
5|$|The {{treatment}} of HIT requires stopping heparin treatment, and both protection from <b>thrombosis</b> and choice of an agent {{that will not}} reduce the platelet count any further. Several alternatives are available for this purpose and mainly used are danaparoid, fondaparinux, argatroban and bivalirudin.|$|E
5|$|There is an {{association}} between the blood levels of homocysteine and <b>thrombosis,</b> although {{this has not been}} reported consistently in all studies. Homocysteine levels are determined by mutations in the MTHFR and CBS genes, but also by levels of folic acid, vitamin B6 and vitamin B12, which depend on diet.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{specific}} treatment for most thrombophilias, but recurrent episodes of <b>thrombosis</b> {{may be an}} indication for long-term preventative anticoagulation. The first major form of thrombophilia, antithrombin deficiency, was identified in 1965, while the most common abnormalities (including factor V Leiden) were described in the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Unless {{a person}} has medical {{problems}} preventing movement, after a person starts anti-coagulation therapy bed rest {{should not be used}} to treat acute deep vein <b>thrombosis.</b> There are clinical benefits associated with walking and no evidence that walking is harmful, but people with DVT are harmed by bed rest except when it is medically necessary.|$|E
5|$|After initial {{reports that}} {{warfarin}} could reduce bone mineral density, {{several studies have}} demonstrated a link between warfarin use and osteoporosis-related fracture. A 1999 study in 572 women taking warfarin for deep venous <b>thrombosis,</b> risk of vertebral fracture and rib fracture was increased; other fracture types did not occur more commonly. A 2002 study looking at a randomly selected selection of 1523 patients with osteoporotic fracture found no increased exposure to anticoagulants compared to controls, and neither did stratification of the duration of anticoagulation reveal a trend towards fracture.|$|E
5|$|After {{retiring}} from athletics, Des Jardien {{worked as a}} manufacturing executive in Los Angeles. He {{was inducted into the}} College Football Hall of Fame in July 1955. He died at his home in Monrovia, California in 1956 from a cerebral <b>thrombosis</b> and was buried at the Forest Lawn Cemetery. Des Jardien was posthumously inducted into the University of Chicago Hall of Fame in 2006.|$|E
5|$|An MR venogram is also {{performed}} {{in most cases}} to exclude the possibility of venous sinus stenosis/obstruction or cerebral venous sinus <b>thrombosis.</b> A contrast-enhanced MRV (ATECO) scan has a high detection rate for abnormal transverse sinus stenoses. These stenoses can be more adequately identified and assessed with catheter cerebral venography and manometry. Buckling of the bilateral optic nerves with increased perineural fluid is also often noted on MRI imaging.|$|E
5|$|Any {{blood clot}} forms {{due to an}} {{imbalance}} between coagulation (the formation of the insoluble blood protein fibrin) and fibrinolysis. The three major mechanisms for such an imbalance are enumerated in Virchow's triad: alterations in normal blood flow, injury to the blood vessel wall, and alterations in the constitution of blood (hypercoagulability). Most cases of cerebral venous sinus <b>thrombosis</b> are due to hypercoagulability.|$|E
5|$|In April 1964 Monteux {{conducted}} {{his last}} concert, {{which was in}} Milan with the orchestra of Radiotelevisione italiana. The programme consisted of the overture to The Flying Dutchman, Brahms's Double Concerto and Berlioz's Symphonie fantastique. Unrealised plans included his debut at The Proms, and his 90th birthday concert, at which he intended to announce his retirement. In June 1964 Monteux suffered three strokes and a cerebral <b>thrombosis</b> {{at his home in}} Maine, where he died on 1 July at the age of 89.|$|E
5|$|Nephrotic syndrome, {{in which}} protein from the {{bloodstream}} is {{released into the}} urine due to kidney diseases, can predispose to thrombosis; this is particularly the case in more severe cases (as indicated by blood levels of albumin below 25g/l) and if the syndrome {{is caused by the}} condition membranous nephropathy. Inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease) predispose to <b>thrombosis,</b> particularly when the disease is active. Various mechanisms have been proposed.|$|E
5|$|On 31 January 1952, despite {{advice from}} {{those close to}} him, the King went to London Airport to see off Princess Elizabeth, who was going on her tour of Australia via Kenya. On the morning of 6 February, George VI {{was found dead in}} bed at Sandringham House in Norfolk. He had died from a {{coronary}} <b>thrombosis</b> in his sleep at the age of 56. His daughter flew back to Britain from Kenya as Queen Elizabeth II.|$|E
