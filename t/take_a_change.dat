In 1975 Pinter began a serious {{affair with the}} historian Lady Antonia Fraser, the wife of Sir Hugh Fraser, which he confessed to his wife that March. At first, Merchant took it very well, saying positive things about Fraser, according to her friend artist Guy Vaesen (as cited by Michael Billington); but, Vaesen recalled, after [...] "a female friend of Vivien's trotted round to her house and poisoned her mind against Antonia ... Life in Hanover Terrace the Pinters then lived gradually became impossible". Pinter left, and Vivien Merchant filed for divorce and gave interviews to the tabloid press, expressing her distress. Merchant made some unflattering comments about Fraser at this time: [...] "He didn't need to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>change</b> of shoes. He can always wear hers.

Martin bemoaned having to campaign against a woman, a position that would soon become anachronistic. Though {{he was running for}} state office, Martin focused much attention on President Johnson, unpopular with many in Alabama because of the Vietnam War, inflation and urban unrest. [...] "We want to see this war ended, and it's going to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>change</b> of administration to do it," [...] Martin said. At the state level, Martin questioned a $500,000 school book depository contract awarded to Wallace supporter Elton B. Stephens of Ebsco Investment Company. Martin challenged [...] "secret deals" [...] regarding the construction of highways or schools" [...] and [...] "conspiracies between the state house and the White House." [...] At her general election campaign kickoff in Birmingham, Lurleen Wallace pledged [...] "progress without compromise" [...] and [...] "accomplishment without surrender ... George will continue to speak up and stand up for Alabama." [...] She continued: [...] "Contrary to what the liberals preach, progress can be made without sacrificing the free enterprise system and ... the Constitution." [...] It was during this 1966 campaign that Wallace coined his line: [...] "There's not a dime's worth of difference" [...] between the two national parties. Wallace likened such Republicans as the then House Minority Leader Gerald R. Ford, Jr., later the president from 1974 to 1977, and Chief Justice Earl Warren, who supported civil rights legislation, to [...] "vultures" [...] who presided over the destruction of the U.S. Constitution. In plugging for two-party politics, Martin claimed {{that the only way to}} unseat President Johnson was for Alabama and the South to become [...] "strongly conservative Republican states." [...] One of Martin's slogans read: [...] "Beat LBJ the Jim Martin Way." [...] Wallace's memoirs merely mention Martin as [...] "the strongest Republican candidate in many years." [...] The Wallaces had little need to campaign, as hardly anyone could out-fox Wallace in the then [...] "popular sport of LBJ-cussin'". [...] Martin did not receive all of the anti-Wallace vote by default. Some liberals coalesced behind the Independent candidate Carl Ray Robinson, a physician and lawyer from Bessemer. Robinson claimed that Wallace had so perverted the Democratic label that Martin, rather than James B. Allen, could be the Democratic lieutenant governor nominee. Robinson filed a $5 million slander suit against Martin after the Republican alleged that Wallace was subsidizing the Robinson campaign in order to split the opposition. Martin dismissed the suit as [...] "something the Democrats have cooked up" [...] and questioned how it could be slanderous to say that [...] "one Democrat supports another." [...] Former Senator Barry Goldwater and sitting Senator Strom Thurmond campaigned on behalf of Martin and Senate candidate John Grenier. Thurmond, who had carried Alabama in 1948 as the nominee of the Dixiecrats addressed an all-white GOP state convention, where he denounced the national Democratic leadership as [...] "the most dangerous people in the country" [...] and urged a [...] "return to constitutional government." [...] George Wallace was so irritated over Goldwater's appearance on Martin's behalf that he questioned why Goldwater could win only six states in his 1964 race against Johnson. [...] "Where were the Republicans when I was fighting LBJ?" [...] Wallace asked. Goldwater shunned personal criticism of Wallace but repudiated Wallace's talk of a third party in the 1968 presidential election.|$|E
