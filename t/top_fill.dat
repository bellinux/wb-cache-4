5000|$|The M-970 Semi-Trailer Refueler is a 5,000 gal fuel {{dispensing}} tanker {{designed for}} under/overwing refueling of aircraft. It {{is equipped with}} a filter/separator, recirculation system and two refueling systems, one for underwing and one for overwing servicing. The tanker is designed to be towed by a 5-ton, 6x6 truck tractor or similar vehicle equipped with a fifth wheel. The M-970 can be loaded through the bottom or through the <b>top</b> <b>fill</b> openings. A ladder is provided {{at the front of the}} semitrailer for access to the top manhole, and a 4-cylinder diesel engine and pump assembly provides self load/unload capability. The body of the refueler is a 5,000-U.S.-gallon, single compartment, stainless steel tank. The chassis is of welded steel construction and is equipped with full floating tandem axles and a manually operated landing gear. There has been talk of retiring the M-970, but a suitable off-road replacement has not been found. The Marine Corps also uses R-9 and R-10 tankers, but they are not capable of off road use. The M-970 is a part of the [...] "United States Marine Corps Maintenance Center - Albany, Georgia, USA - An Integrated Enterprise Scheduling Case Study" [...] which is working to upgrade the Semitrailer for future use.|$|E
50|$|Afterward, the Johnston Island {{launch complex}} was heavily damaged and {{contaminated}} with plutonium. Missile launches and nuclear testing halted until the radioactive debris was dumped and soils were recovered and the launch emplacement rebuilt. Three months of repairs, decontamination, and rebuilding the LE1 {{as well as}} the backup pad LE2 were necessary before tests could resume. In an effort to continue with the testing program, U.S. troops were sent in to do a rapid cleanup. The troops scrubbed down the revetments and launch pad, carted away debris and removed the top layer of coral around the contaminated launch pad. The plutonium-contaminated rubbish was dumped in the lagoon, polluting the surrounding marine environment. More than 550 drums of contaminated material were dumped in the ocean off Johnston from 1964-1965. At the time of the Bluegill Prime disaster, the <b>top</b> <b>fill</b> around the launch pad was scraped by a bulldozer and grader. It was then dumped into the lagoon to make a ramp, so the rest of the debris could be loaded onto landing craft to be dumped out into the ocean. An estimated 10 percent of the plutonium from the test device was in the fill used to make the ramp. Then the ramp was covered and placed into a 25 acre landfill on the island during 1962 dredging to extend the island. The lagoon was again dredged in 1963-1964 and used to expand Johnston Island from 220 acres to 625 acres recontaminating additional portions of the island.|$|E
40|$|The present {{invention}} {{is about}} a method for filling an opening in an insulating layer in a fast and highly reliable way {{and can be used}} to fill openings such as trenches and via holes simultaneously. This method is based on the principle of reaction enhanced wetting and simultaneous seed layer formation. The idea is, in contrast to trying to avoid the TiAl 3 formation, to use this reaction to its advantage for the creation of an ultra-thin continuous Al-containing seed layer. The latter allows a bottom to <b>top</b> <b>fill</b> during the subsequent Al-containing metal deposition. As a consequence, the filling process proceeds much faster and is production worthy...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an analytical and experimental evaluation of an enhanced techniques for no-vent fill. The method entails injecting liquid {{through the top}} of the receiver vessel, thereby increasing surface area and agitation of the ullage/liquid interface. Both of these factors promote condensation induced ullage collapse, and reduce compressive impedance to the incoming liquid. The enhanced process was analyzed by modifying the surface area algorithm of an existing tank thermodynamic code to model a downward-pointing, conical jet impringing on a steadily rising liquid surface. Transient pressure and temperature measurements from several tests with Freon- 114 were input into the revised model to calculate condensation rate as a function of fill level. By expressing these rates in dimensionless form (i. e., in terms of Stanton number and Prandtl number), an empirical correlation similar to the submerged jet model of Brown and Sonin (1989) was derived. This provided a basis for developing an expression which relates <b>top</b> <b>fill</b> to bottom fill performance...|$|E
40|$|Increased {{demand for}} oil and gas pushes {{producers}} to develop and enhance methods for exploring deeper reservoirs located in offshore fields. With greater depths comes greater complications, this greater water depth along with other unknown formation factors in conjunction with the high daily rental cost of offshore rigs, equipment and personnel renders performing research and development on a deep water offshore well prohibitively expensive. However, with the occurrence of incidents such as the Macondo in 2010, regulators and operators have been prompted to be more cautious and perform research in offshore drilling operations, to better understand the unknown factors which involve the deepwater conditions. This thesis investigates riser gas migration while drilling offshore wells using the EC-Drill? technology. EC-Drill? is a variation of Dual Gradient Drilling, where two fluid gradients are achieved by controlling the annular mud level in the riser via subsea pumps, voiding the top section to air, forming the two gradients; air in top section and drilling mud for the remaining fluid column, providing dynamic control of the Bottom Hole Pressure and improved drilling and well control capabilities, which reduce costs, non-productive time and create a safer drilling environment. However, one of the issues of voiding the riser to air in the EC-Drill? is that if a gas kick occurs or gas is drilled, then the gas entering the system will rise to the voided section of the riser creating a combustible mixture of gas and air below the rig floor, leading to devastating results such as equipment damage, losing the well, and even death. These results make it important to understand and mitigate the problem of gas migration. This study provides the design process of the experiment facility in which the gas migration study was performed and the preliminary tests that were done to study gas migration. The method of elimination that was proposed for the testing facility was called the ?<b>top</b> <b>fill</b> technique?, where additional drilling fluid is injected {{from the top of the}} riser in the annulus, causing a downward flow motion which is meant to prevent the gas from rising up. The injected drilling fluid is then returned to the rig floor through the EC-Pump mounted on the riser along with the gas. This method requires a priori knowledge of the amount of drilled gas, mud properties, circulation rates, the injection rate and the required downward flow which is obtained through experiments. To perform the necessary experiments a small-scale simulator was designed at the University Services Building at Texas A&M University, following the guidelines provided by the EC-Drill? Technology Providers and available literature. The model was scaled to 1 / 3 of actual riser size and initial tests were done using water to prove the successful design and installation of the equipment. Following this, the scaled model was prepared and calibrated to accommodate clear drilling mud to provide visual study of the gas migration phenomenon. However, due to the limitations of the pump rates and flow meters along with the use of water as a drilling mud, the tests were unsuccessful in fully mitigating the gas migration issue, leading to the need of upgrading the equipment that were used to run the tests...|$|E
40|$|Physical Vapour Deposition (PVD) is a {{thin film}} {{deposition}} technique used to deposit dim films {{for a wide variety}} of applications. One key application area is the microchip fabrication process where PVD is used to deposit the various layers of metal which interconnect die devices on the mictochip. This study focuses on this application area and the emphasis is placed on using PVD deposited matenals to coat and fill deep sub-mtcton vias and contacts. Through a combination of modelling, simulation, and experiment it is shown that PVD will remain the technology of choice up to and beyond 0 25 |Jm technology. Chapter 1 introduces both the PVD process and microchip fabrication. The basic physics underlying PVD is studied and this discussion is extended to film growth kinetics, variations of the basic PVD process, and alternative / rival processes. The microchip fabrication process is discussed and the role PVD plays in the larger picture is highlighted. This is followed by a discussion on the direction the microchip fabrication industry is taking and what PVD must do to keep up. Chapter 2 looks at the PVD process in more detail. After introducing some commercially available sputter simulation packages, the development of a model and 3 -D sputter simulation package is detailed. The sputter model / simulation is then used to investigate a number of key aspects of sputtering. The reactive sputtering process is discussed as is the sputter etch process and film uniformity as a function of process and hardware configurations. Chapter 3 looks at the barriers, liners and wetting layers typically used as part of the metallisation scheme. Emphasis is placed on achieving the required step coverage to achieve barrier integrity, reliable feature fill, and good yield The ionised metal PVD process is studied m detail and it js argued that this technique is probably the best available process for coating deep sub-micron features. Chapter 4 looks at the aluminium deposition process in detail in order to ascertain the best method of filling deep sub-micron high aspect ratio structures with aluminium Shrinking feature sizes means the low resistivity materials such as aluminium need to be used as the via and contact plug materials in order to maintain device optimum speed and performance. A number of different via fill schemes are presented. A remarkable bottom to <b>top</b> <b>fill</b> process is developed and explained with the help of a film growth simulation package. Chapter 5 follows on from chapter 4 and examines alternative fill processes using standard and collimated wetting layers. Detailed simulations which include the effect of wetting and seed layers are performed and the influences of these underlayers on the fill mechanism discussed. Chapter 6 examines the ionised PVD processing detail Film profiles over submicron features are studied as a function of the material fluxes to the substrate during deposition. Material re-deposition at the bottom of features due to the effects of ion bombardment is studied both experimentally and theoretically. It is found that re-deposition at the bottom of high aspect ratio features can be used to redistribute material to die lower sidewall, thus improving barrier integrity...|$|E
