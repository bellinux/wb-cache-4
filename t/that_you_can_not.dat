It is really a masterpiece, both for the delicate and passionate figure and for the strange and powerful originality of the painting. One of these days I will come to thank you personally.

60|$|Your {{letter of}} the 7th was {{received}} night before last. I very cheerfully send you the twenty dollars, which sum you say is necessary to save your land from sale. It is singular {{that you should have}} forgotten a judgment against you; and it is more singular that the plaintiff should have let you forget it so long, particularly as I suppose you have always had property enough to satisfy a judgment of that amount. Before you pay it, it would be well to be sure you have not paid it; or, at least, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> prove you have paid it. Give my love to Mother, and all the connections.|$|E
6000|$|There {{are clear}} and simple {{remedies}} for nothing. In medicine there has been discovered but a single specific; in politics not one. The interests, moral and natural, of a community in our highly differentiated civilization are so complex, intricate, delicate and interdependent, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> touch one without affecting all. It is a familiar truth that no law was ever passed {{that did not have}} unforeseen results; but of these results, by far the greater number are never recognized as of its creation. The best that can be said of any [...] "measure" [...] is, that the sum of its perceptible benefits seems so to exceed the sum of its perceptible evils as to constitute a balance of advantage. Yet the magnificent innocence of the statesman or philosopher to whose understanding [...] "the whole matter lies in a nutshell"--who thinks he can formulate a practical political or social policy within the four corners of an epigram--who fears nothing because he knows nothing--is constantly to the fore with a simple specific for ills whose causes are complex, constant and inscrutable. To the understanding of this creature a difficulty well ignored is half overcome; so he buttons up his eyes and assails the problems of life with the divine confidence of a blind pig traversing a labyrinth.|$|E
60|$|A {{portion of}} the city is pretty {{exclusively}} Turkish; the Jews have a quarter to themselves; the Franks another quarter; so, also, with the Armenians. The Armenians, of course, are Christians. Their houses are large, clean, airy, handsomely paved with black and white squares of marble, and in the centre of many of them is a square court, which has in it a luxuriant flower-garden and a sparkling fountain; the doors of all the rooms open on this. A very wide hall leads to the street door, and in this the women sit, the most of the day. In the cool of the evening they dress up in their best raiment and show themselves at the door. They are all comely of countenance, and exceedingly neat and cleanly; they look as if they were just out of a band-box. Some of the young ladies--many of them, I may say--are even very beautiful; they average a shade better than American girls--which treasonable words I pray may be forgiven me. They are very sociable, and will smile back when a stranger smiles at them, bow back when he bows, and talk back if he speaks to them. No introduction is required. An hour's chat at the door with a pretty girl one never saw before, is easily obtained, and is very pleasant. I have tried it. I could not talk anything but English, and the girl knew nothing but Greek, or Armenian, or some such barbarous tongue, but we got along very well. I find that in cases like these, the fact <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> comprehend each other isn't much of a drawback. In that Russia n town of Yalta I danced an astonishing sort of dance an hour long, and one I had not heard of before, with a very pretty girl, and we talked incessantly, and laughed exhaustingly, and neither one ever knew what the other was driving at. But it was splendid. There were twenty people in the set, and the dance was very lively and complicated. It was complicated enough without me--with me it was more so. I threw in a figure now and then that surprised those Russians. But I have never ceased to think of that girl. I have written to her, but I can not direct the epistle because her name is one of those nine-jointed Russian affairs, and there are not letters enough in our alphabet to hold out. I am not reckless enough to try to pronounce it when I am awake, but I make a stagger at it in my dreams, and get up with the lockjaw in the morning. I am fading. I do not take my meals now, with any sort of regularity. Her dear name haunts me still in my dreams. It is awful on teeth. It never comes out of my mouth but it fetches an old snag along with it. And then the lockjaw closes down and nips off a couple of the last syllables--but they taste good.|$|E

50|$|Tired of {{covering}} Western blues bands, the Flower Travellin' Band {{wanted to create}} their own material.

Joe Yamanaka revealed that there are relatively few lyrics on the album because of the band's love for improvisation. He stated <b>that</b> because <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> suddenly change direction with lyrics as <b>you</b> <b>can</b> with instrumentation, he consciously stepped back and trusted the other musicians.
