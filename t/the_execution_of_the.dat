5|$|In C++ {{computer}} programming, allocators are {{an important}} component of the C++ Standard Library. The standard library provides several data structures, such as list and set, commonly referred to as containers. A common trait among these containers is their ability to change size during <b>the</b> <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> program. To achieve this, some form of dynamic memory allocation is usually required. Allocators handle all the requests for allocation and deallocation of memory for a given container. The C++ Standard Library provides general-purpose allocators that are used by default, however, custom allocators may also be supplied by the programmer.|$|E
5|$|In English law, secret trusts are a {{class of}} trust defined as an {{arrangement}} between a testator and a trustee, made to come into force after death, that aims to benefit a person without having been written in a formal will. The property {{is given to the}} trustee in the will, and he would then be expected to pass it on to the real beneficiary. For these to be valid, the person seeking to enforce the trust must prove that the testator intended to form a trust, that this intention was communicated to the trustee, and that the trustee accepted his office. There are two types of secret trust — fully secret and half-secret. A fully secret trust is one with no mention in the will whatsoever. In the case of a half-secret trust, the face of the will names the trustee as trustee, but does not give the trust's terms, including the beneficiary. The most important difference lies in communication of the trust: the terms of a half-secret trust must be communicated to the trustee before <b>the</b> <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> will, whereas {{in the case of a}} fully secret trust the terms may be communicated after <b>the</b> <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> will, as long as this is before the testator's death.|$|E
5|$|Isabella and her {{supporters}} Péter Petrovics and Ferenc Patócsy {{made a new}} attempt to prevent <b>the</b> <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Treaty of Nyírbátor in May 1551, but Martinuzzi defeated them.

Two days later, she surrendered the Holy Crown to Ferdinand's representative, Giovanni Battista Castaldo. The Diet acknowledged their abdication and swore fealty to Ferdinand on 26July.|$|E

5|$|Since early 1792 France {{had been}} at war with four of its {{neighbours}} on two fronts, battling Austria and Prussia in the Austrian Netherlands, and the Austrians and Piedmontese in Italy. On 2 January 1793, almost one year into the French Revolutionary War, republican-held forts at Brest in Brittany fired on the British brig HMS Childers. A few weeks later, following <b>the</b> <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> imprisoned King Louis XVI, diplomatic ties between Britain and France were broken. On 1 February France declared war on both Britain and the Dutch Republic.|$|E
5|$|Stephen III {{launched}} a new invasion against Syrmium {{in the spring of}} 1165. Emperor Manuel directed the counter-attack, and Béla accompanied him again.

A Byzantine army also occupied Dalmatia. A new peace treaty between Stephen III and Emperor Manuel followed, which confirmed the emperor's suzerainty in Béla's former duchy. Dalmatia and Bosnia were soon converted into Byzantine themes.|$|E

5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> King in January 1649, England was {{declared}} a commonwealth and the Scots declared his son king as Charles II. The English responded with an invasion and, after defeats for the Scots at Dunbar in 1650 and Worcester in 1651, the English occupied {{the country in}} 1652, declaring Scotland part of the Commonwealth. In the period after the defeat at Dunbar the Kirk became deeply divided, partly {{in the search for}} scapegoats for defeat. Different factions and tendencies produced rival resolutions and protests, which gave their names to the two major parties as the Resolutioners, who were willing to make an accommodation with royalism, and the more hard line Protesters who wished to purge the Kirk of such associations. Subsequently, the divide between rival camps became almost irrevocable. After 1655 both groups appointed permanent agents in London.|$|E
5|$|Departing {{from the}} main central {{administrative}} system generally known as the Three Departments and Six Ministries system, which was instituted by various dynasties since late Han (202 BCE – 220 CE), the Ming administration had only one Department, the Secretariat, that controlled the Six Ministries. Following <b>the</b> <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chancellor Hu Weiyong in 1380, the Hongwu Emperor abolished the Secretariat, the Censorate, and the Chief Military Commission and personally {{took charge of the}} Six Ministries and the regional Five Military Commissions. Thus a whole level of administration was cut out and only partially rebuilt by subsequent rulers. The Grand Secretariat, at the beginning a secretarial institution that assisted the emperor with administrative paperwork, was instituted, but without employing grand counselors, or chancellors.|$|E
5|$|Even before Haywood {{first became}} an {{official}} with the Western Federation of Miners, {{he was convinced that}} the system under which working people toiled was unjust. He described <b>the</b> <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Haymarket leaders in 1887 as a turning point in his life, predisposing him toward membership in the largest organization of the day, the Knights of Labor. Haywood had watched men die in unsafe mine tunnels, and had marched with Kelly's Army. He had suffered a serious hand injury in the mines, and found that his only support came from other miners. When Haywood listened to Ed Boyce of the WFM addressing a group of miners in 1896, he discovered radical unionism and welcomed it.|$|E

5|$|In 1531, a {{group of}} Spaniards led by Francisco Pizarro landed {{on the shores of}} the Inca Empire, thus {{starting}} the Spanish conquest of Peru. At that time the empire was emerging from a civil war in which Atahualpa had defeated his brother Huascar to claim the title of Sapa Inca. Atahualpa underestimated the strength of the small force of Spaniards and was captured during an ambush at Cajamarca in November 1532. Pizarro ordered <b>the</b> <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> emperor in July 1533, and occupied the Inca capital of Cusco four months later. To replace Atahualpa, Pizarro installed his brother Túpac Huallpa as a puppet ruler, but he died shortly afterwards. Another brother, Manco Inca, was crowned in his place. During this stage, Atahualpa's generals were the only opposition to the Spanish advance as a sizable part of the empire's population had fought on Huascar's side during the civil war and joined Pizarro against their enemies.|$|E
5|$|In 1629, Edward Hyde {{married his}} first wife, Anne Ayliffe of Grittenham. Six {{months into the}} {{marriage}} Anne caught smallpox, miscarried and died. Three years later, Hyde married Frances Aylesbury. In 1637, Anne, the couple's eldest daughter, was born at Cranbourne Lodge in Windsor. Almost nothing except that she was named after Edward Hyde's first wife is known of her life before 1649, when her family fled to the Netherlands after <b>the</b> <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deposed King Charles I. They settled in Breda, where they were offered a home by Mary, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange, who {{had done the same}} with many English fugitives.

The specific initiative of those executions is controversial. Chilean historian Vicuña Mackenna indicts San Martín, while J. C. Raffo de la Reta blames O'Higgins instead. Manuel Rodríguez was also imprisoned and then killed in prison; this death may have been decided by the Lautaro lodge. San Martín could not have taken part in it, as he was already on the way to Buenos Aires.|$|E

5|$|So {{yesterday}} morning the Tories, {{by the hand}} of Mr Calcraft, accomplished the final act of separation between England and Ireland. The only thing that the Fenians still lacked were martyrs. They have been provided by Derby and G Hardy. Only <b>the</b> <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three has made the liberation of Kelly and Deasy the heroic deed which will now be sung to every Irish babe in the cradle in Ireland, England and America... To my knowledge, {{the only time that}} anybody has been executed for a similar matter in a civilised country was the case of John Brown at Harpers Ferry. The Fenians could not have wished for a better precedent. The Southerners had at least the decency to treat J. Brown as a rebel, whereas here everything is being done to transform a political attempt into a common crime.|$|E
5|$|Stephen {{sought to}} ingratiate himself with Mehmed by sending out orders to commanders and castellans to surrender, {{enabling}} his captor to take command {{of more than}} 70 towns in one week. Mehmed, however, {{had no intention of}} sparing Stephen's life and summoned him on 25 May. Stephen fearfully brought Angelović's document, but Mehmed's Persian-born mullah, Ali al-Bistami, issued a fatwah declaring that the Sultan was not bound to keep the promise made by his servant without his knowledge. As if to demonstrate the validity of his fatwah, the elderly mullah took out his sword and beheaded Stephen in front of Mehmed. The chronicler Benedetto Dei, who claimed to {{have been part of the}} Sultan's retinue, recorded that Mehmed himself decapitated Stephen. According to later accounts, Mehmed had Stephen flayed or used as a shooting target. <b>The</b> <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> King, his uncle, cousin and two noblemen took place in a field next to Jajce, which has since been known as Carevo Polje ("the Emperor's Field").|$|E
5|$|Tensions in Europe {{had been}} {{steadily}} mounting since the French Revolution of 1789 and in 1792 the French Revolutionary Wars began with {{war between the}} new French Republic and the Austrian and Prussian Empires. Great Britain was not initially engaged in this conflict, but diplomatic relations with France were rapidly deteriorating. On 1 February 1793, shortly after <b>the</b> <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deposed King Louis XVI, the French National Convention declared war on Britain and the Dutch Republic. Due to the long distances involved, it took five months for news of the outbreak of war to reach India, passing through the British consul at Alexandria, George Baldwin. On 2 June the news arrived at Madras and passed to Calcutta on 11 June. The Governor-General of India Lord Cornwallis issued instructions for operations against the territories of French India.
