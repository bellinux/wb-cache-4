5|$|The {{immediate}} {{result of}} the battle was inconclusive, both squadrons retiring with one ship damaged apiece. French losses had been heavy, with 15 killed and 20 wounded on Prudente, the latter including Renaud and 22 killed and 62 wounded on Cybèle. One sailor was killed and five wounded on Jean-Bart and no casualties were reported on Courier. By contrast, Centurion had only three men killed and 23 wounded and Diomede none at all, but the damage to Osborne's ship was more problematic; while Renaud could repair and resupply his ships in nearby Port Louis, Centurion {{had to return to}} India, several <b>thousand</b> <b>miles</b> <b>away,</b> to affect repairs. Osborne was thus forced to abandon the blockade, with Centurion sailing to Bombay and Diomede to Madras.|$|E
5|$|The French {{had also}} been {{preparing}} reinforcements for the region, but their nearest naval bases were in France itself, several <b>thousand</b> <b>miles</b> <b>away</b> across oceans almost totally controlled by the Royal Navy. These distances also delayed the arrival of news from the Indian Ocean, and therefore word had still not reached France {{of the fall of}} Isle de France by 17:00 on 2 February 1811, when a reinforcement squadron set sail from Brest. This squadron consisted of three powerful frigates, Renommée under Commodore François Roquebert, Clorinde under Captain Jacques Saint-Cricq and Néréide under Captain Jean-François Lemaresquier. Each ship carried over 200 soldiers for the Isle de France garrison and significant food and military supplies with which to refit Hamelin's squadron and resupply the island. The French authorities were aware of the possibility that Isle de France had been captured, and had ordered that if the island was in British hands, the squadron should continue on to the Dutch city of Batavia on Java, to operate against the British from there.|$|E
5|$|To get to Ottawa, several <b>thousand</b> <b>miles</b> <b>away,</b> {{the club}} {{had to get}} to Whitehorse by {{overland}} sleigh, catch a train from there to Skagway, Alaska, then catch a steamer to Vancouver, B.C. and a train from there to Ottawa. On December 18, 1904, several players set out by dog sled and the rest left the next day by bicycle for a 330-mile trek to Whitehorse. At first the team made good progress, but the weather turned warm enough to thaw the roads, forcing the players to walk several hundred miles. The team spent the nights in police sheds along the road. At Whitehorse, the weather turned bad, causing the trains not to run for three days and the Nuggets to miss their steamer in Skagway. The next one could not dock for three days due to the ice buildup. The club found the sea journey treacherous, and it caused seasickness amongst the team. When the steamer reached Vancouver, the area was too fogged in to dock, and the steamer docked in Seattle. The team from there caught a train to Vancouver, from which it left on January 6, 1905, arriving in Ottawa on January 11.|$|E

25|$|For each episode's score, Goldsmith {{simulated}} a real orchestra with a synthesizer {{palette of}} an eighty-piece symphony orchestra for budgetary reasons, although he occasionally used {{two or three}} musicians for added orchestral authenticity. Goldsmith's long-time assistant Neal Acree started composing additional music for Stargate SG-1 in Season 8. The amount of composed music varied between 12 and 33 minutes out of a 44-minute episode, {{with an average of}} around 22 to 26 minutes, making the full symphonic score of SG-1 more time-consuming to create than for general TV shows. Since Goldsmith lived a <b>thousand</b> <b>miles</b> <b>away</b> from Vancouver, he and the producers discussed ideas over the phone and exchanged tapes via Federal Express for several years until the show switched to Internet file transfers.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from the}} marvellous and fanciful reports of this history, the most {{probable}} interpretation {{is that the}} Mugharrarin reached the Sargasso Sea, {{a part of the}} ocean covered by seaweed, which is very close to Bermuda yet one <b>thousand</b> <b>miles</b> <b>away</b> from the American mainland. Then while coming back, they may have landed either on the Azores, or on Madeira or even on the westernmost Canary Island, El Hierro (because of the sheep). Last, the story with the inhabited island might have occurred either on Tenerife or on Gran Canaria, where the Mugharrarin presumably met some Guanche tribe. This would explain why some of them could speak Arabic (some sporadic contacts had been maintained between the Canary Islands and Morocco) and why they were quickly deported to Morocco where they were welcomed by Berbers. Yet, the story reported by Idrisi is an indisputable account of a certain knowledge of the Atlantic Ocean by Andalusians and Moroccans.|$|E

In May 1960 divorce proceedings started; Leigh reported the fact to the press and informed reporters of Olivier's relationship with Plowright. The decree nisi was issued in December 1960, which enabled him to marry Plowright in March 1961. A son, Richard, was born in December 1961; two daughters followed, Tamsin Agnes Margaret—born in January 1963—and Julie-Kate, born in July 1966.|$|E
