25|$|Wilson {{recommended}} Kiggell as {{his successor}} and thought {{the appointment of}} William Robertson “a tremendous gamble”, writing “my heart sinks when I <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> all may mean to the College & this house”. He may have felt that Robertson’s lack of private means did not suit him for a position which required entertaining. Robertson visited Camberley with Lord Kitchener (28 July 1910), who criticised Wilson; {{this may have been}} one of the causes of the poor relations between Wilson and Kitchener in August 1914. Edmonds later told a story of how Wilson had, perhaps as a joke or wanting to draw attention to Robertson’s shortage of money, left a bill for £250 for furniture and improvements to the Commandant’s residence, and that Wilson’s predecessor Rawlinson, when approached by Robertson for advice, had been amused and had commented that many of these improvements had been made by his own wife or by previous Commandants. Whatever the truth of the matter, relations between Wilson and Robertson deteriorated thereafter.|$|E
500|$|From then on, Williams {{began to}} work in {{independent}} features, which attracted smaller audiences. [...] "I feel like I haven't been working in a particularly flashy or visible way," [...] she reflected to Vogue magazine. [...] "If you weren't looking for them, you would miss the movies that I've made that I'm proud of." [...] For Me Without You (2001), Williams co-starred with Anna Friel. The movie's reception was split, with review aggregator website, Rotten Tomatoes, assigning it a 66% rating based on 65 reviews. Next was Prozac Nation (2002), starring Christina Ricci {{and based on the}} autobiography of the same name by Elizabeth Wurtzel. It portrayed her struggle with major depression. Asked if her roommate role was interesting to play, Williams said: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> needed to be was helpful. Somebody to stand like this [...] so that she [...] could keep smacking up against it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In addition, in many communities, {{negation}} is put {{at the end}} of the clause, {{unless there}} is a wh- question word. For example, the sentence, [...] "I thought the movie was not good," [...] could be signed as, [...] "BEFORE MOVIE ME SEE, <b>THINK</b> <b>WHAT?</b> <b>IT</b> GOOD NOT." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't suppose men {{feels it}} as we do; but, oh, Mrs. Lopez, give me a little, safe, so that I may know that I shan't see my {{children}} want. When I <b>thinks</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> {{would be to have}} them darlings' little bellies empty, and nothing in the cupboard, I get that low that I'm nigh fit for Bedlam." ...|$|R

"That's all you are, little Paul," [...] he had persisted, [...] "a {{good little}} {{hard-working}} doll, that does <b>what</b> <b>it's</b> made to do, and <b>thinks</b> <b>what</b> <b>it's</b> made to <b>think.</b> We are all dolls. Your {{father is a}} gallant-hearted, soft-headed little doll; your mother the sweetest and primmest of dolls. And I'm a silly, dissatisfied doll that longs to be a man, but hasn't the pluck. We are only dolls, little Paul." ...|$|R

2500|$|Some {{terrorism}} experts {{thought there}} was a connection in Muhammed's case to other homegrown terror plots in recent years, including targets, ideological motives and religious inspiration. Neil Livingstone, a terrorism consultant, said that people on the margins of society are [...] "easy marks" [...] for recruiters offering them ideological and fanatical religious justifications for violence, noting [...] "Most of these guys — I <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> comes down to — they're misfits, they believe they've suffered injustice. ... They basically are striking back at society." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wilson, a folksy, honest, and outspoken man, {{sometimes}} {{got into}} trouble because of casual remarks. In January 1957, for example, he referred to enlistees in the National Guard during the Korean War as [...] "draft dodgers". This caused a storm of protest and even brought a rebuke from the president, who said he thought Wilson had made [...] "a very ... unwise statement, without stopping to <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> meant". On another occasion, Wilson jokingly referred to the White House as a [...] "dung hill", generating further controversy. These episodes should not detract from recognition of Wilson's determined efforts to run the Department of Defense efficiently and to maintain the nation's security forces within reasonable budget guidelines.|$|E
6000|$|There was {{something}} wrong. Grandfather Frog knew it the very minute {{he got up}} that morning. At first he couldn't <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> was. He sat with just {{his head out of}} water and blinked his great goggly eyes, as he tried to <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> was that was wrong. Suddenly Grandfather Frog realized how still it was. It was a different kind of stillness from anything he could ever remember. He missed something, and he couldn't <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> was. It wasn't the song of Mr. Redwing. There were many times when he didn't hear that. It was--Grand-father Frog gave a startled jump out on to the shore. [...] "Chugarum! It's the Laughing Brook! The Laughing Brook has stopped laughing!" [...] cried Grandfather Frog.|$|E

6000|$|... "Exactly. That is {{just what}} he says. But, Mrs. Clavering, I care nothing for that. I care nothing for what any body says or <b>thinks.</b> <b>What</b> is <b>it</b> to me <b>what</b> they say?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Can't you <b>think,</b> dear, <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is?" [...] she says, {{laying a}} hand upon her father's, with a tremor in her voice, perhaps, but eyes that are quite open and bright.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{ought to}} be looked to;--that's all. Only <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> will be if he marries, and has a son before {{anything}} is--is settled." ...|$|E
60|$|The Hoppers {{looked at}} one another questioningly and blinked their eyes and tried to <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> all meant; but they couldn't figure it out.|$|E
6000|$|Paolo walked silently {{along for}} some time, and then said: [...] "If {{it is not}} wanted to carry our weight, master, I cannot <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is wanted for." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And do we? Sometimes, when I <b>think</b> of <b>what</b> <b>it</b> means--This poor {{child of}} Redwood's--And, of course, your three... Forty feet high, perhaps! After all, ought we {{to go on}} with it?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I can't <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> can be," [...] said Anne in despair, [...] "unless it's that Moody Spurgeon MacPherson saw {{you home}} from prayer meeting last night. Did he?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{seems to}} me that I have," [...] replied the Pumpkinhead, seriously; [...] "but I cannot <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is. My father knows all about it, but he is not here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Does she mean young Gay, Louisa?' inquired Mr Dombey, {{knitting}} his brows. 'Really, this child's manners {{have become}} very boisterous. She cannot mean young Gay, I <b>think.</b> See <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is, will you?' ...|$|R
60|$|Lapham went, {{trying to}} <b>think</b> <b>what</b> had happened. <b>It</b> {{seemed to him}} a long time since he had drunk that wine.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{wonder you}} find any {{gratification}} {{in coming to}} see me. I can't <b>think</b> <b>what</b> put <b>it</b> in your head. I never had much in seeing you. There was no love lost between us, Mr Pinch, at any time, I think.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] she answered, [...] "I am merely {{trying to}} <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> {{can be that}} has been {{worrying}} me all the morning. It has clean gone out of my head." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wonderful, {{but very}} terrible," [...] she replied; [...] "it {{is all very}} well to look at from here, but only <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> must be for those within that circle of fire." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If He does, {{it makes}} it all the worse. I never heeded; I thought it all a bore. I never let myself <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> all meant. I've thrown it all away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well;--what do you <b>think?</b> <b>What</b> is <b>it</b> {{probable}} {{that such a}} girl as I would say when such a man as your brother asks her to be his wife? Is he not such a man as a girl would love?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Next. 'You cannot <b>think</b> <b>what</b> a {{difference}} <b>it</b> makes {{to have you}} here. I never need think about Arthur's being made comfortable.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Elizabeth, <b>think</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> may mean!" [...] he muttered. [...] "How can I drag {{you through}} it all? A trial, perhaps, the suspense, {{and all the}} time that guilty {{knowledge}} behind--yours and mine!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh! Right. Thanks. Goodbye, William. Give my {{respects to}} the cook, and mind you don't work too hard. <b>Think</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> {{would be if you}} {{developed}} heart disease. Awful! You mustn't do it, William.' ...|$|E
