5|$|While chrism is {{used only}} for the three sacraments that cannot be repeated, a {{different}} oil is used by a priest or bishop to bless a Catholic who, because of illness or old age, {{has begun to be}} in danger of death. This sacrament, known as Anointing of the Sick, is believed to give comfort, peace, courage and, if the sick person is unable <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>confession,</b> even forgiveness of sins.|$|E
25|$|One of the convicted, Dorcas Hoar, {{was given}} a {{temporary}} reprieve, {{with the support of}} several ministers, <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>confession</b> of being a witch. Mary Bradbury (aged 77) escaped. Abigail Faulkner Sr. was pregnant and given a temporary reprieve (some reports from that era say that Abigail's reprieve later became a stay of charges).|$|E
25|$|On 1 May, it was {{reported}} that rebels captured 508 Antitank Battalion, the village of Tira and the 'Tal Ashtara' hill. The same day, the FSA-affiliated Southern Syrian Revolutionary Front was established, consisting of some 20 rebel groups. Three days later, several rebel commanders belonging to this front (including the commander: Colonel Ahmad Al-Na’meh) were arrested by the al-Nusra front. This incident evoked tension in Daraa, with some moderate rebels saying that they will attack al-Nusra Front if the commanders are not released from custody. A mediation committee had been set up to deal with the case, involving leading figures from both sides, as well as tribal sheikhs. Colonel Ahmad Al-Na’meh was forced <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>confession</b> on video after four days of detainment.|$|E

500|$|Religious fervor {{had been}} waning in the Massachusetts Bay Colony {{since the time}} of the first settlements, and church {{membership}} was dropping off. [...] To counter this, minister Richard Mather suggested a means of allowing membership in the church without requiring a religious testimonial. [...] Traditionally, parishioners had <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>confession</b> of faith in order to have their children baptized and in order to participate in the sacrament of Holy Communion (Last Supper). [...] In the face of declining church membership, Mather proposed the Half-way covenant, which was adopted. [...] This policy allowed people to have their children baptized, even though they themselves did not offer a confession.|$|E
500|$|The {{phrase is}} likely to have {{originated}} in the Kingdom of Israel following the Law of Moses in beth din courts as a way of giving credence to the authority of God as the author of all law. It {{is likely to}} have come from Deuteronomy 16:18 where it stated: [...] "Judges and officers shalt thou make thee in all thy gates, which the Lord thy God giveth thee, tribe by tribe; and they shall judge the people with righteous judgment". This gave rise to the theory that judges had been given authority from God to exercise judgment on matters of the law and would use the phrase to attribute this fact to God. The phrase continued to be used in courts, passing from Jewish to Christian context as a way to continue to affirm God as the highest authority in law. Clarence Darrow, Oliver O'Donovan and the Chicago Law Journal have stated that the phrase's continual usage may have come about as a result of judges feeling that while they could pass a sentence of death upon a person, they personally did not have the authority to destroy souls and that only God had the authority to do that. As a result, some judges would cross their fingers whenever they said the phrase as a result of concern for the criminal's soul as they said it as a prayer. While the phrase is intended to be said by judges with conviction, it is also said because of legal tradition and not necessarily due to belief in its meaning. During the 17th century in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, the Puritan majority of judges at the time did not believe that stating [...] "may God have mercy on your soul" [...] had any meaning unless the accused had made a confession of the crime in open court. They, and other Puritan office holders, would also regularly press the condemned up until the point of execution <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>confession</b> of the crime they had been convicted of to ensure that the phrase satisfactorily had meaning according to their views.|$|E
2500|$|All {{the pupils}} under John Bosco {{observed}} a monthly event called The Exercise of a Happy Death; this practice continues {{under the name}} The Monthly Day of Recollection. [...] This practice was encouraged by Pope Pius IX. Part of this was <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>Confession</b> and Communion {{as though they were}} the last ones to be made before death. Bosco notes that Dominic observed this practice devoutly, and that one day, Dominic said that he would be the first amongst the group to die. During the month of May, before his death, the intensity of his spiritual practices increased. John Bosco notes that he said, [...] "Let me do what I can this year; if I am here next year I'll let you know what my plans are." ...|$|E

60|$|Florence felt guilty. After all, {{as she was}} the {{principal}} cause of his expenses, it was generous of him to put it as he had done.

6000|$|... "Do you {{remember}} what we said to each other this morning about telling our faults?" [...] he asked abruptly, finding that she still remained immovable.

6000|$|Hilda spoke {{clearly and}} distinctly. She {{had thought it}} all out with herself beforehand. [...] "Such {{witnesses}} as will carry absolute conviction to the mind of all the world; irreproachable, disinterested witnesses; official witnesses. In the first place, a commissioner of oaths. Then a Plymouth doctor, {{to show that you}} are in a fit state of mind <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>confession.</b> Next, Mr. Horace Mayfield, who defended my father. Lastly, Dr. Blake Crawford, who watched the case on your behalf at the trial." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{prisoner}} wishes <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>confession,</b> Master Holmes. I {{thought it}} best {{that you should be}} here. You can hear what he says then, and it may help you in your inquiry. Besides, you may think of questions on points he may not mention; he understands that he is speaking entirely of his own free will, and that I have given him no promise whatever that his so doing will alter his sentence, although no doubt it will be taken into consideration." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{days were}} going by in a monotony of {{adversity}} to him, {{from which he}} could no longer escape, even at home. He attempted once or twice to talk of his troubles to his wife, but she repulsed him sharply; she seemed to despise and hate him; but he set himself doggedly <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>confession</b> to her, and he stopped her one night, as she came into the room where he sat--hastily upon some errand that was to take her directly away again.|$|E

25|$|Despite the Luhansk City Court's verdict, {{the case}} remains {{far from being}} certain.

60|$|Maso mused silently, and in deep abstraction. He then desired {{that the}} chapel might be cleared {{of all but}} the {{travellers}} of condition, the monks, and his judges.

6000|$|... "Yes, father, I {{agree with}} you. There {{would be nothing}} treacherous in that. I have simply {{to try to get}} her <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>confession</b> of {{anything}} she may know in the matter. I quite agree with you in all you have said about the man, but I do not see how Ruth Powlett can know anything for certain, whatever she may suspect; for if she was, as you say, dangerously ill {{for a long time after}} the murder, she cannot very well have seen the man, who would be sure to have quitted the country at once." ...|$|E

Well, I've been allowing you to wear yourself out hunting for work for me when there's been a chance open {{to me all the}} time. Forgive my pride--what was left of it. It is all gone, now, and I've come to confess that if those ghastly artists want another confederate, I'm their man--for at last I am dead to shame." ...|$|E
50|$|At his trial, Rupe {{denied any}} {{involvement}} in the crime and blamed a friend of his. A psychologist testified that he had given Rupe a diagnosis of schizotypal personality disorder and a secondary diagnosis of histrionic personality disorder, and that these disorders caused Rupe <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> false <b>confession.</b> Mitchell Rupe {{was found guilty of}} aggravated murder and sentenced to death.|$|R
5000|$|The Cardassian {{legal system}} is {{centered}} around {{the concept of a}} [...] "show trial".

The verdict is always guilty, the sentence is always death, and defendants have few or no rights. ("Tribunal") ...|$|R
