5|$|Many {{fish have}} eyespots near their tails, {{a form of}} automimicry, to {{distract}} attacks away from the vulnerable head and eye. For example, Chaetodon capistratus has both a (disruptive) eyestripe <b>to</b> <b>conceal</b> <b>the</b> eye, and a large eyespot near its tail, giving {{the impression that the}} head is {{at the tail end of}} the body.|$|E

5|$|Based on {{his work}} for the 60 Minutes reports plus further {{investigation}} on his own, Thompson wrote A Glimpse of Hell. The book was published by W. W. Norton & Company.

60|$|The methods also {{in private}} families, {{which would have}} been universally used <b>to</b> have <b>concealed</b> <b>the</b> {{distemper}} and <b>to</b> have <b>concealed</b> <b>the</b> persons being sick, would have been such that the distemper would sometimes have seized a whole family before any visitors or examiners could have known of it. On the other hand, the prodigious numbers {{which would have been}} sick at a time would have exceeded all the capacity of public pest-houses to receive them, or of public officers to discover and remove them.|$|R

Following his recovery, he gave up smoking and took up jogging.|$|E
5|$|Set {{pieces in}} Noh {{such as the}} boats, wells, altars, and bells, are {{typically}} carried onto the stage {{before the beginning of}} the act in which they are needed. These props normally are only outlines to suggest actual objects, although the great bell, a perennial exception to most Noh rules for props, is designed <b>to</b> <b>conceal</b> <b>the</b> actor and to allow a costume change during the kyōgen interlude.|$|E

5|$|Around {{the time}} of Kameo release, lead {{designer}} George Andreas felt that the original Kameo concept of finding and using monsters had evolved and carried through to the final product. He {{said that there were}} enough ideas for a sequel within the new intellectual property if players were interested. Years later, Andreas reappraised and said that the game should never have been released and remains a sore subject for him to discuss. Since the project was nearly finished, they had opted for launch title release instead of starting over. Andreas felt that the effort <b>to</b> <b>conceal</b> <b>the</b> fairy Kameo as an elf was unsuccessful and that the character did not match the Xbox's first-person shooter demographic.|$|E
5|$|Chile's National Monuments Council {{declared}} Patio 29 a National Monument on 13 July 2006 at {{the request}} of a group of Chamber of Deputies legislators. The Council chose the site for its proof of the Pinochet military government's elaborate procedures used <b>to</b> <b>conceal</b> <b>the</b> disappeared's bodies and their identities. At the ceremony, Patio 29 was described {{as a symbol of the}} country's painful history and an educational place for human rights. As a national monument, the site will be conserved and maintained by government funds unless ordered otherwise by the courts. It is the first cemetery to become a national monument in Chile.|$|E
5|$|Evidence was {{presented}} that Tabak had then tried <b>to</b> <b>conceal</b> <b>the</b> crime by disposing of her body. The court heard that DNA swabs taken from Yeates' body had provided a match with Tabak. Samples found behind the knees {{of her jeans}} indicated {{she may have been}} held by the legs as she was carried, while fibres suggested contact with Tabak's coat and car. Blood stains were found on a wall overlooking a quarry close to where Yeates was discovered. The prosecution also said that Tabak attempted to implicate Jefferies for the murder during the police investigation, and that in the days following Yeates' death, he had made internet searches for topics that included the length of time a body takes to decompose and the dates of refuse collections in the Clifton area.|$|E

50|$|The Orange County funds, {{managed by}} Citron, were worth $8 billion. However, Citron {{went out to}} the repo market and {{leveraged}} the County Pools to amounts ranging from 158% to over 292%. To obtain this degree of leverage, he used treasury bonds as collateral.

He pleaded guilty to improperly transferring securities from the Orange County General Fund to the Orange County Treasury Commingled Pool.|$|R
5|$|Geotaphonomy is the {{examination}} of how the decomposition of the body affects the environment. Geotaphonomy examinations can include how the soil was disturbed, pH alteration of the surrounding area, and either the acceleration or deceleration of plant growth around the body. By examining these characteristics, examiners can begin to piece together a timeline of the events during and after death. This can potentially help determine the time since death, whether or not trauma on the skeleton {{was a result of}} peri or post-mortem activity, as well as if scattered remains were the result of scavengers or a deliberate attempt <b>to</b> <b>conceal</b> <b>the</b> remains by an assailant.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of the nineteenth century, the British {{administration}} drew up an urban plan for the development of Chamba. They laid emphasis on the building of civic buildings around the Chaugan <b>to</b> <b>conceal</b> <b>the</b> unorthodox structural layout of the residential complexes. The western oriented development programme grew particularly active after the arrival of Major Blair Reid in January 1863, during the reign of Raja Shri Singh. The next fourteen years in particular, until his retirement in March 1877, were characterised by large-scale building projects in Chamba, with Reid fully revising the administrative and revenue departments of Chamba and reorganizing the state machinery to make development more efficient.|$|E
5|$|Kalam {{was invited}} by Raja Ramanna {{to witness the}} country's first nuclear test Smiling Buddha as the {{representative}} of TBRL, {{even though he had}} not participated in its development. In the 1970s, Kalam also directed two projects, Project Devil and Project Valiant, which sought to develop ballistic missiles from the technology of the successful SLV programme. Despite the disapproval of the Union Cabinet, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi allotted secret funds for these aerospace projects through her discretionary powers under Kalam's directorship. Kalam played an integral role convincing the Union Cabinet <b>to</b> <b>conceal</b> <b>the</b> true nature of these classified aerospace projects.|$|E

50|$|On February 17, 2004, Mario Navarette, Alberto Martinez, Jacob Burgoyne, and Douglas Woodcoff {{were indicted}} by Georgia {{authorities}} for the murder. Burgoyne {{pleaded guilty to}} voluntary manslaughter {{and was sentenced to}} 20 years in prison. Woodcoff pleaded guilty <b>to</b> <b>concealing</b> <b>the</b> death of another and was sentenced to probation. At trial, Navarette was convicted of felony murder while in the commission of an aggravated assault, aggravated assault, possession of a knife during the commission of a crime, and <b>concealing</b> <b>the</b> death of another. Martinez was convicted of the same charges and malice murder. Navarette and Martinez were both sentenced to life plus fifteen years in prison.|$|R
60|$|They {{frequently}} conversed together about her, {{and always}} in a hopeful tone, each endeavouring <b>to</b> <b>conceal</b> from <b>the</b> other the real state of his own mind. Indeed, except when necessity required it, they seldom spoke on any other subject.|$|R
5|$|Some animals {{actively}} seek to hide by decorating {{themselves with}} {{materials such as}} twigs, sand, or pieces of shell from their environment, to break up their outlines, <b>to</b> <b>conceal</b> <b>the</b> features of their bodies, and to match their backgrounds. For example, a caddis fly larva builds a decorated case and lives almost entirely inside it; a decorator crab covers its back with seaweed, sponges and stones. The nymph of the predatory masked bug uses its hind legs and a 'tarsal fan' to decorate its body with sand or dust. There are two layers of bristles (trichomes) over the body. On these, the nymph spreads an inner layer of fine particles and an outer layer of coarser particles. The camouflage may conceal the bug from both predators and prey.|$|E
5|$|The May Revolution {{began the}} Argentine War of Independence, {{although}} no formal {{declaration of independence}} was issued {{at the time and}} the Primera Junta continued to govern {{in the name of the}} deposed king, FerdinandVII. As similar events occurred in many other cities of the continent, the May Revolution is also considered one of the early events of the Spanish American wars of independence. Historians today debate whether the revolutionaries were truly loyal to the Spanish crown or whether the declaration of fidelity to the king was a necessary ruse <b>to</b> <b>conceal</b> <b>the</b> true objective—to achieve independence—from a population that was not yet ready to accept such a radical change. A formal declaration of independence was finally issued at the Congress of Tucumán on July9, 1816.|$|E
5|$|The Peninsular War was not {{developing}} favourably for Spain, and by May 1810 a ship {{arrived with}} {{the news of the}} defeat of Seville and the disbanding of the Junta of Seville. Without either a recognised Spanish king or the Junta that had appointed Cisneros, many people thought that the viceroy no longer had any authority. Cisneros tried <b>to</b> <b>conceal</b> <b>the</b> news by gathering all the newspapers brought by the ship, but Belgrano and Castelli managed to get one. Cisneros then explained the European developments to the public. Belgrano {{and the members of the}} Carlotist party, despite having given up their original idea, plotted to remove the viceroy and replace him with a junta. Under the advice of Cornelio Saavedra, they waited for the news of the defeat in Spain to take action.|$|E
