25|$|In July 1805 Plumper, {{together}} with her sister-ship , {{were part of the}} Royal Navy force blockading the coat of northern France. On 15 July the two gun-brigs were off Granville, Manche when they became becalmed. To avoid the tide carrying them onto the coast, the two anchored in the afternoon off Chausey. A heavy fog came up and at 2:30 am on 16 July, several French vessels were seen to emerge from the darkness. Plumper attempted to get closer to <b>Teazer</b> so that they could support each other, but was unable to so. The French force, which consisted of six brigs, a schooner, and a ketch, stood off and battered Plumper with their guns. Plumper returned fire, but being armed primarily with cannonades, was outranged. During the exchange of fire, Garrety had an arm shot off, a leg crippled by grapeshot, and a piece of langrange lacerated his chest. Four seamen were also wounded. After an hour, Sub-Lieutenant Richards, who had taken over command after Garrety had been taken below, struck. Later, some of Plumpers crew accused Richards of having too quickly surrendered.|$|E

Each task unit was also assigned two Seafires to spot their gunfire. The destroyers which were assigned to the bombardment task units were responsible for counter-battery fire on any Japanese guns which fired on the cruiser, and for generating smoke screens if necessary.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the subjective well-being of female strippers. The effect that certain variables namely, self-esteem, general health, self-efficacy, perceived social support and sense of coherence had on subjective well-being and the independent components of subjective well-being, namely life satisfaction and positive and negative affect, were investigated. The sample consisted of 75 female strippers and was a consequence {{of a combination of}} purposive and convenience non-probability sampling. These women were employed at <b>Teazers</b> - a chain of strip clubs in Gauteng, South Africa. Information was gathered through self-reported questionnaires with quantifiable scales. The results of the regression models showed that life satisfaction depends on perceived social support, but positive and negative affect depends on self-esteem and general health. If life satisfaction and positive and negative affect is combined into a measurement of subjective well-being, 6. 7 % of the total variance in subjective well-being is uniquely explained by self-esteem.

Hornet, Midge, and Gnat spent their whole careers there. Gnats service, however, was rather short as she ran aground and was wrecked on Balabac Island, south of the Philippines, {{less than a year after}} she was commissioned. Their duties included protecting British lives and property and fighting pirates. Another major deployment area was the Gulf of Guinea in West Africa where Fly, Lynx, Flirt, Dwarf, Beacon, Avon, Pert, Growler, Rocket, Hart, and Boxer all spent part of one or more commissions. Beacon supported British coastal operations during the Third Anglo-Ashanti War in 1873 while most of the others engaged river pirates at various times. Rocket, Elk, Dwarf, Beacon, and Avon served at least one commission off the south-east coast of South America, while Cracker spent her entire career there. Dwarf made a port visit to Asunci√≥n, on the Paraguay River, some [...] from the ocean during one of her tours in the region. <b>Teazer,</b> Lynx, Beacon, and Thistle each made one deployment to the East Indies Station where they helped to suppress the slave trade between East Africa and the Persian Gulf. Beacon, Hart, and Growler were deployed to the Mediterranean where the former participated in the Bombardment of Alexandria in 1882.

And don't {{you remember}} what we spring from:- heaps of lumps of clay, partially prepared and cleaned in Devonshire and Dorsetshire, whence said clay principally comes - and hills of flint, without which we should want our ringing sound, and should never be musical?

And as to the flint again, isn't it mashed and mollified and troubled and soothed, exactly as rags are in a paper-mill, until it is reduced to a pap so fine that it contains no atom of 'grit' perceptible to the nicest taste? And as to the flint and the clay together, are they not, after all this, mixed in the proportion of five of clay to one of flint, and isn't the compound - known as 'slip' - run into oblong troughs, where its superfluous moisture may evaporate; and finally, isn't it slapped and banged and beaten and patted and kneaded and wedged and knocked about like butter, until it becomes a beautiful grey dough, ready for the potter's use? ...|$|R
