40|$|A aceitação de nove amostras comerciais de vinhos brancos brasileiros, de três diferentes linhas varietais (Riesling, Chardonnay e Gewürztraminer), foi avaliada por 43 consumidores de vinhos brancos nacionais, utilizando a escala hedônica estruturada de nove pontos. Os provadores foram recrutados através de um questionário de avaliação de hábitos de consumo de vinho branco. Duas metodologias distintas foram utilizadas para avaliar os dados obtidos: o Mapa de Preferência Interno (MDPREF) e Análise de Variância (ANOVA) com comparação de médias (teste de Tukey).

25|$|For {{several centuries}} Lyon, capital of Rhône-Alpes, {{has been known}} as the French capital of gastronomy, due, in part, to the {{presence}} of many of France's finest chefs in the city and its surroundings (e.g. Paul Bocuse).

The yields of Sancerre blanc are limited to a maximum of 60 hectoliters per hectare while Sancerre rouge and rose are restricted to maximum yields of 55 hl/ha.

2500|$|Despite (or {{perhaps because}} of) the {{traditional}} importance of appellations for wine, {{there has been}} little harmonisation of national provisions within the European Union. Member States delimit the specified areas of production and determine the rules and appellations which apply: the European Commission restricts itself to publishing the information provided by the Member States. Appellations are usually the geographical name of the area in which the wine is produced, although there are some historical exceptions: muscadet and blanquette in France, cava and manzanilla in Spain and vinho verde in Portugal. The appellations are not necessarily unique: Cava may refer either to a quality sparkling wine psr produced in Spain or to a Greek <b>table</b> <b>wine</b> which has been aged (as a transliteration of [...] "Κάβα").|$|E
