MAAT {{project is a}}n airship based cruiser-feeder transport system. This paper analyzes the criticalities {{of the project and}} the way to upfront these problems which have different natures and possible solutions. Most important criticalities are analyzed both on a methodological point of view and on a direct point of view. Enhanced design methodologies are analyzed in depth to analyze problems, upgrade the project design status continuously and to examine different design options and solutions. An innovative design method has been defined to avoid that problems can produce show stoppers and minimize time delays during project definition...|$|E
