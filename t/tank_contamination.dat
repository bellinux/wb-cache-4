40|$|The Green Swamp Preserve {{is a large}} {{geographic}} area that has sustained many changes since Europeans settled in Florida. There has been little published research on the impacts of anthropogenic activity on this system. This thesis research seeks to document more recent changes in the Green Swamp and to evaluate the effects of various human activities on the system. The study period is from 1985 to 2015. For this time period changes in land use and landcover were examined using neural network classifications. Changes in vegetation health were evaluated by examining Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Green Vegetation Index differences. Field site visits were made to document current conditions at thirty sample locations within the study area. Changes in land use and landcover and vegetation health were evaluated in relation to anthropogenic activities such as proximity to pollution sources, conservation lands and restoration sites. Statistical analysis was conducted to determine if statistically significant clustering occurred in these changes and if present geographically weighted regressions were performed {{to determine if a}} significant spatial relationship existed between the clustering and the various human activities. WAP data showed an overall decline in wetland health at the assessment sites and showed a trend of lower wetland health at sites within 2 Km of pollution sources, specifically petroleum <b>tank</b> <b>contamination</b> sites and state roads. The statistically significant clustering identified in land use landcover changes from 1985 to 2015 were in relation to changes from field, forested and wetland landcover types to built environments. Spatial relationships were identified between the proximity of petroleum <b>tank</b> <b>contamination</b> sites, state roads and solid waste facilities and clustering of NDVI decreases from 1985 to 2015. NDVI increases in the study area from 1985 to 2015 also showed statistically significant clustering in relation to conservation lands and lands purchased by the Southwest Florida Water Management District for environmental protection. These preliminary findings suggest that human activities may have influenced changes in the health of the Green Swamp. Further, more extensive research is suggested to confirm these findings...|$|E

40|$|Bovine viral {{diarrhea}} (BVD) is {{the most}} important bovine viral disease across the world. The virus belongs to Flavi viridae and of Pesti virus genus which causes to various syndromes. The virus affects the reproduction, respiratory, digestive, cardiovascular, immunity, lymphatic, muscular  and central nervous systems. Today, different tests (virus isolation, RT-PCR, capturing ELISA, direct and indirect ELISA  and immune fluorescence test) have be designed in order to diagnosis viral infection of cattle’s viral diarrhea. This study aimed at demonstrating the importance of the disease in cattle’s abortion of Tabriz suburb’s cattle pens in 89 - 90 by measurement antibody titre of produced milk.

40|$|An {{outbreak}} of waterborne cryptosporidiosis affecting 27 persons, diagnosed stool positive, occurred in Ayrshire in April 1988. Twenty-one in 27 confirmed cases required {{some form of}} fluid replacement therapy. Local general practitioners indicated a two- to fivefold increase in diarrhoeal disease during the outbreak, and following enquiries made by Environmental Health Officers {{it became apparent that}} many hundreds of people had suffered a diarrhoeal illness at that time. Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts were detected in the treated chlorinated water supply system, in the absence of faecal bacterial indicators. Oocyst contamination of a break-pressure tank containing final water for distribution was the cause of this waterborne outbreak. An irregular seepage of oocyst-containing water, which increased during heavy rains, was the cause of the break-pressure <b>tank</b> <b>contamination,</b> rather than a failure of the water-treatment processes. The waterborne route should be considered when clusters of cryptosporidiosis-associated with potable water occur.

40|$|Every summer, a small {{percentage}} of Wisconsin’s soybean fields have injury, which is generically described as “leaf puckering”. Although the severity of the injury may not be great, the injury generates a lot of concern for the soybean grower. The grower may be concerned that the injury will result in yield loss and/or be concerned over who was responsible for causing the injury. Leaf puckering may be caused by growth regulator herbicides such as dicamba, which is an ingredient in Banvel, Clarity, and several other corn herbicides. These herbicides mimic the plant’s natural hormones and distort new leaf growth. Dicamba is applied to nearly 1 million acres of corn in Wisconsin each year (232, 000 lb applied to 0. 95 million acres in 2002) (NASS 2003). As a consequence, the potential for dicamba drift or <b>tank</b> <b>contamination</b> is real. However, there have been several other suggested theories for these puckered soybeans. These suggested reasons include the following: 1. A physiological response to adverse growing conditions such as high temperatures are suggested to cause a hormone-type response. 2. The new high yielding soybean varieties are responding to environmental stresses. 3. Nitrogen additives such as the biuret concentration in 28 % UAN are causing lea...|$|E

40|$|The blossom blight {{phase of}} fire blight, {{caused by the}} bacterium Erwinia amylovora, is {{typically}} managed by applying the antibiotic, streptomycin sulfate, to trees during bloom. Biological control of fire blight {{can be achieved by}} applying non-pathogenic bacteria to open flowers that then colonize flower part surfaces and compete with the pathogen for space and nutrients. The objective {{of this study was to}} measure the growth of three applied biological control organisms at three orchard locations in New York. We hope to identify safe and effective alternatives to streptomycin because the pathogen is likely to become resistant to streptomycin if this product is used too often. This has already occurred in some western and mid-western states. We detected population levels of the biological control organisms that were slightly lower than those reported in the Pacific Northwest. We also determined that the spread of the biological control organisms increased over time at each location. Application of the bacteria with a handgun sprayer appeared to result in higher populations than when applied with a handheld sprayer. A mixture of antagonists was detected at more than one location, indicating either <b>tank</b> <b>contamination</b> or natural dispersal of the organisms via pollinators. Our results confirmed the ability of these three biological control organisms to colonize and multiply on flowers in New York state.

"Thesis supervisor: Dr. Kevin W. Bradley. Due {{to the increase in}} glyphosate-resistant (GR) weeds, two agrochemical companies have developed soybeans with resistance to 2, 4 -D and dicamba in an effort to provide growers with new options for the control of problematic GR species. Due to the high sensitivity of non-transformed soybeans that may be grown in close proximity to 2, 4 -D- or dicamba-resistant crops, there is increasing concern about the potential for off-target movement of these herbicides through drift, volatility, and/or <b>tank</b> <b>contamination.</b> Traditionally, applications of fungicides have been made to corn between tasseling (VT) and silking (R 1); however in recent years some pesticide manufacturers have promoted early-season fungicide coapplications with post-emergence (POST) herbicide treatments. Corn is also a nitrogen-demanding crop, where nitrogen uptake is often limited due to soil characteristics and environmental factors. The ability to co-apply agrochemicals allows growers the option of combining desirable products with a POST herbicide application at no additional application cost. The objectives of this research are to: 1) compare the relative soybean phytotoxicity of eight synthetic auxin herbicides to one another and 2) determine the effects of V 5 herbicide, fungicide, and/or slow-release N co-applications on corn injury and yield. Results from these experiments suggest significant yield reductions can occur if proper application methods are not followed when applying synthetic auxin herbicides. Also, the addition of a fungicide and/or slow-release N fertilizer at V 5 is not likely to increase corn grain yields in comparison to an herbicide treatment alone.

30|$|Crude oil {{is a kind}} of water/oil emulsion, {{which the}} oil phase {{consists}} of organic molecules with different molecular weights such as alkanes, paraffin, asphaltene, and resins. Due to the change in physicochemical conditions during the production, transportation, storage, and refining, heavier molecules can precipitate from crude oil. Thus, viscous sludge formed at the bottom of storage tanks can cause many problems including reduction of storage capacity of <b>tank,</b> oil <b>contamination,</b> corrosion, repair costs, environmental pollution, etc. The reduction of sludge viscosity can be achieved by reduction of its interfacial tension. In this study, different chemical and physical factors, influencing prepared emulsions (made of sludge, water and surfactant), such as surfactants, solvents, temperature, pressure, and mixing conditions were investigated. Results showed that non-ionic surfactants (like bitumen emulsifier), and solvents (such as mixed xylene, AW- 400, and AW- 402), injection of additives, applying pressure, and mixing operations had a positive effect on reduction of emulsion viscosity. All experiments were carried out with sludge obtained from crude oil storage tanks at Kharg Island, Iran.|$|R

40|$|A {{combined}} {{engineering and}} geochemistry approach {{is recommended for}} the stabilization of waste in decommissioned tanks and contaminated soils at the AX Tank Farm, Hanford, WA. A two-part strategy of desiccation and gettering is proposed for treatment of the in-tank residual wastes. Dry portland cement and/or fly ash are suggested as an effective and low-cost desiccant for wicking excess moisture from the upper waste layer. Getters work by either ion exchange or phase precipitation to reduce radionuclide concentrations in solution. The authors recommend the use of specific natural and man-made compounds, appropriately proportioned to the unique inventory of each tank. A filler design consisting of multilayered cementitous grout with interlayered sealant horizons should serve to maintain tank integrity and minimize fluid transport to the residual waste form. External <b>tank</b> soil <b>contamination</b> is best mitigated by placement of grouted skirts under and around each tank, together with installation of a cone-shaped permeable reactive barrier beneath the entire tank farm.

40|$|Listeria monocytogenes is a {{zoonotic}} pathogen {{that causes}} listeriosis in humans. Dairy cattle are a healthy reservoir of L. monocytogenes {{and the presence}} of the pathogen on dairy farms has been frequently described. The present study had as main objective to study the molecular epidemiology of L. monocytogenes on a New York State dairy farm by using data collected between February 2004 and June 2008, and Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) typing of L. monocytogenes isolates. Fecal samples were collected every 6 months from all lactating cows. Approximately 20 environmental samples were obtained every 3 months. Bulk tank milk samples and in-line milk filter samples were obtained weekly. Samples from milking equipment and the milking parlor were obtained in May 2007, and in January and February 2008. A high prevalence of L. monocytogenes in bulk tank milk (25. 4 %) and in milk filters (66. 6 %) was observed, contrasting with a low prevalence of the pathogen in fecal (6 %) and environmental (7 %) samples. The presence of a L. monocytogenes-containing biofilm in milking equipment was suggested as a potential source of bulk <b>tank</b> milk <b>contamination.</b> Furthermore, the presence of three predominant and persistent L. monocytogenes strains (PFGE types T, D, and F accounting for 28. 6 %, 22. 6 %, and 14. 9 % of L. monocytogenes isolates, respectively) was observed in the milking line. Predominant and persistent strains showed high adherence ability in an in-vitro biofilm assay. Our results suggest that the milking system was exposed to several L. monocytogenes types from different sources. Only 3 PFGE types, however, were successful in persisting within the milking system, suggesting that some strains are more suitable to that particular ecological environment. Finally, the risk of listeriosis due to consumption of raw milk sold by permitted dealers and due to consumption of raw milk on farms was estimated. Overall, the annual number of listeriosis cases due to raw milk consumption was predicted to be low by our model.

Higher toxin levels were found in red wines (0. 017 to 0. 050 mu g/L) than white wines (0. 006 to 0. 022 mu g/L). Intensive pressing of pomace, prolonged drying of grapes, and storage in partially empty <b>tanks</b> increased OTA <b>contamination</b> of wines. Poor winery sanitation practice was {{the primary source of}} OTA contamination, as wines from contaminated wineries had the highest OTA values (0. 130 to 1. 300 mu g/L). Filtration through a 10 -pm membrane and heating on hot plates at 55 degrees C did not cause a significant decrease in the toxin level. An 80 % decrease of OTA was observed after wine filtration through a 0. 45 -mu m membrane (p < 0. 05). Eleven enological fining agents were tested to study their ability to remove OTA from wine. Enological decolorizing carbon removed (at 30 g/hL) up to 72 % of OTA. The Freundlich isotherm was used to model OTA adsorption on carbon.

Forensic investigations of dead birds suggested that lead {{may have been the}} causative agent. At the time, lead and nickel, as well as iron ore and other materials, were being exported through the Port of Esperance (port). Government agencies undertook a targeted environmental sampling programme to identify the exposure sources and the extent of contamination. Results of ambient air monitoring, blood lead level investigations and analysis of metals in rainwater <b>tanks</b> suggested widespread <b>contamination</b> of the Esperance town site with lead and nickel.

The quantity and quality of exposure data are an important contributor to the uncertainty associated with the outcomes of a risk assessment. Conclusion: As the data were collected essentially as part of the emergency response to the events in Esperance, there was some uncertainty about the suitability and completeness of the data for risk assessment. The urgent nature of the emergency response meant that sampling was opportunistic and not necessarily sufficient or suitable for risk assessment from a methodical and scientific perspective.

40|$|As much as {{one million}} gallons of waste is {{believed}} to have leaked from tanks, pipelines or other equipment in the single-shell tank farm waste management areas (WMAs) within the 200 East and West areas of the U. S. Department of Energy's Hanford Site near Richland, Washington. Although some contamination has reached groundwater, most contamination still resides in the vadose zone. The magnitude ofthis problem requires new approaches for soil characterization if we are to understand {{the nature and extent of}} the contamination and take action to protect the enviromnent. Because of the complexity and expense of drilling traditional boreholes in contaminated soil, direct push characterization using a hydraulic hammer has been extensively employed. Direct push probe holes < 3 -inch diameter have been pushed to a maximum depth of 240 feet below ground surface in 200 East area. Previously gross gamma and moisture logging of these narrow probe holes was perfonned to identify the location of cesium- 137 ({sup 137 }Cs) (which has limited mobility in Hanford soil) and moisture peaks. Recently a bismuth germinate detector has been deployed for detecting and quantifying the spectrum of cobalt- 60 ({sup 60 }Co) (a more mobile contaminant), which provides additional information. The direct push system is configured to allow the collection ofmultiple soil core samples throughout the depth ofthe probe hole. The direct push unit has been used to place individual electrodes at a variety of depths as the probe hole is being decommissioned. These deep electrodes enable the use of soil resistivity measurement methods between surface and deep electrodes as-well-as between sets of deep electrodes. Initial testing of surface-to-deep electrode resistivity measurements in WMA C demonstrated significant improvement in defining the three dimensional extent of a contamination plume. A multiple-electrode string is presently being developed to further enhance the resolution of resistivity data. The combined use of direct push logging/sampling and soil resistivity measurement allows more extensive characterization of the large tank farm WMAs with less cost and time commitment than required by traditional methods. An additional tool is in the laboratory testing stage to support these investigations. A beta detection tool is being evaluated to determine if it might be deployed with the direct push unit to identify technetium- 99 ({sup 99 }Tc) contamination. {sup 99 }Tc is a mobile, long-lived contaminant that is the major risk driver from <b>tank</b> waste <b>contamination.</b> A screening tool to locate {sup 99 }Tc contamination is anticipated to further increase the cost-effectiveness ofvadose zone characterization efforts...|$|R

S. Department of Energy (DOE) regarding the near-term operations, future waste retrieval, and final closure activities for the single-shell tank Waste Management Areas (WMAs). For a more complete discussion of the {{goals of the}} Tank Farm Vadose Zone Project, see the overall work plan, Phase 1 RCRA Facility Investigation/Corrective Measures Study Work Plan for the Single-Shell Tank Waste Management Areas (DOE 1999). Specific details on the rationale for activities performed at WMA U are found in Crumpler (2003). To meet these goals, CH 2 M HILL Hanford Group, Inc., asked scientists from Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) to perform detailed analyses of vadose zone sediment collected within the U Single-Shell Tank Farm. Specifically, this report contains all the geochemical and selected physical characterization data collected on vadose zone sediment recovered from ten direct push characterization holes emplaced to investigate vadose zone contamination associated with potential leaks within the 241 -U Single-Shell Tank Farm. Specific tanks targeted during this characterization campaign included tanks 241 -U- 104 / 241 -U- 105, 241 -U- 110, and 241 -U- 112. Additionally, this report compiles data from direct push samples collected north of tank 241 -U- 201, as well as sediment collected from the background borehole (C 3393). After evaluating all the characterization and analytical data, {{there is no question that}} the vadose zone in the vicinity of tanks 241 -U- 104 and 241 -U- 105 has been contaminated by tank-related waste. This observation is not new, as gamma logging of drywells in the area has identified uranium contamination at the same depths interrogated by push hole C 5602. Given that the deepest sample string analyzed from push hole C 5602 contained trace activities of technetium- 99, it is obvious that <b>tank</b> waste <b>contamination</b> has impacted the vadose zone to at least a depth of 92 ft bgs at this location. However, the scope of the sampling campaign was to acquire additional samples to better understand the aerial extent of contamination in the U Tank Farm; therefore, future characterization activities (i. e., a borehole) will be required to understand the total vertical depth of contamination at this location...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{organization}} of water supply to and on ships differs considerably {{from that of}} water supply on land. Risks of contamination can arise from source water at the port or during loading, storage, or distribution on the ship. The {{purpose of this article}} is to review documented outbreaks of waterborne diseases associated with passenger, cargo, fishing, and naval ships to identify contributing factors so that similar outbreaks can be prevented in the future. METHODS: The authors reviewed 21 reported outbreaks of waterborne diseases associated with ships. For each outbreak, data on pathogens/toxins, type of ship, factors contributing to outbreaks, mortality and morbidity, and remedial action are presented. RESULTS: The findings of this review show that the majority of reported outbreaks were associated with passenger ships and that more than 6, 400 people were affected. Waterborne outbreaks due to Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, noroviruses, Salmonella spp, Shigella sp, Cryptosporidium sp, and Giardia lamblia occurred on ships. Enterotoxigenic E. coli was the pathogen most frequently associated with outbreaks. One outbreak of chemical water poisoning also occurred on a ship. Risk factors included contaminated port water, inadequate treatment, improper loading techniques, poor design and maintenance of storage <b>tanks,</b> ingress of <b>contamination</b> during repair and maintenance, cross-connections, back siphonage, and insufficient residual disinfectant. CONCLUSIONS: Waterborne disease outbreaks on ships can be prevented. The factors contributing to outbreaks emphasize the need for hygienic handling of water along the supply chain from source to consumption. A comprehensive approach to water safety on ships is essential. This may be achieved by the adoption of Water Safety Plans that cover design, construction, operation, and routine inspection and maintenance...|$|R
40|$|A {{human health}} risk {{analysis}} was conducted on inactive tanks 7562, H- 209 and T- 30 to determine the method for remediating the tanks. Risk analysis {{results indicated that the}} health risk associated with these tanks were within or below the EPA range of concern of 1 {times} 10 {sup {minus} 4 } to 1 {times} 10 {sup {minus} 6 }. On the basis of these results, and with regulator approval, it was determined that either no action or in-place stabilization of the tanks would satisfy risk-based remediation goals. Therefore, a decision was made and approved by DOE to remediate these tanks in-place as a maintenance action. Tanks H- 209 and T- 30 were isolated from associated piping, electrical systems, and instrumentation and grouted in-place. Due to regulatory concerns over the location of tank 7562 relative to an area of subsurface soil <b>contamination,</b> <b>tank</b> 7562 was isolated from associated piping and instrumentation and left in-place empty. Completion of these maintenance actions has met the intent of the Federal Facility Agreement (FFA) for remediation of inactive tanks H- 209 and T- 30. EPA and Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC) will be requested to approve a change to the FFA removing tanks H- 209 and T- 30 from the Appendix F list of inactive tanks. The request for removal of tank 7562 from Appendix F will be submitted pending final disposition of the tank. Since the associated tank piping systems remain in-place, it will further be requested that these systems be included as individual sites in Appendix C of the FFA for future remedial consideration...|$|R
40|$|Tap water {{filtering}} {{devices are}} widely employed to improve odor and taste of tap water, or to obtain refrigerated or sparkling drinking water. The presence of disinfectants-resistant bacteria in tap water is responsible of the biofilm formation inside tubes and <b>tanks.</b> The consequent <b>contamination</b> of dispensed {{water is a}} well-known hygiene problem because of the quite constant presence of potentially pathogenic bacteria likes P. aeruginosa. In this study, we tested the technical feasibility and effectiveness of the addition to different commercial devices of a packaged polysulphone fibers filter. We aimed to find a simple solution to implement {{the quality of the}} delivered water. Water contamination levels were determined in a wide selection of microfiltered water dispensers and we selected among them a representative group of 10 devices, new or in use. The packaged ultrafilter was introduced in about half of them, to monitor, when possible, in parallel the contamination levels and flow rate of a couple of identical units, with and without the filter. The placement of the dialysis filters resulted feasible at different positions along the water circuits of the variously designed filtration units. Delivered water resulted completely free from bacteria when the filter was placed exactly at, or very close to, the outlet in spite of the inner surfaces contamination. This performance was not obtained in presence of a more or less long tract of water circuits downstream the ultrafilter: a significant but not complete reduction of the plate count numbers was observed. The filters worked in continue over the whole study period, ten months, showing exactly the same efficiency. Moreover, the flow rate in presence of the filter was quite unaffected. The addition of this kind of filter to already in use water dispensers was technically easy, and its use can be recommended in all cases a simple but reliable water sanitization is requested...|$|R
40|$|Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis (MAP), the {{etiologic}} agent of Johne's disease in dairy cattle, may enter the bulk <b>tank</b> via environmental <b>contamination</b> or direct excretion into milk. Traditionally, diagnostics to identify MAP in milk target either MAP antibodies (by ELISA) or the organism itself (by culture or PCR). High ELISA titers may be directly associated with excretion of MAP into milk but only indirectly linked to environmental {{contamination of the}} bulk tank. Patterns of bulk-milk ELISA and bulk-milk PCR results could therefore {{provide insight into the}} routes of contamination and level of infection or environmental burden. Coupled with questionnaire responses pertaining to management, the results of these diagnostic tests could reveal correlations with herd characteristics or on-farm practices that distinguish herds with high and low environmental bulk-tank MAP contamination. A questionnaire on hygiene, management, and Johne's specific parameters was administered to 292 dairy farms in New York, Oregon, and Wisconsin. Bulk-tank samples were collected from each farm for evaluation by real-time PCR and ELISA. Before DNA extraction and testing of the unknown samples, bulk-milk template preparation was optimized with respect to parameters such as MAP fractionation patterns and lysis. Two regression models were developed to explore the relationships among bulk-tank PCR, ELISA, environmental predictors, and herd characteristics. First, ELISA optical density (OD) was designated as the outcome in a linear regression model. Second, the log odds of being PCR positive in the bulk tank were modeled using binary logistic regression with penalized maximum likelihood. The proportion of PCR-positive bulk tanks was highest for New York and for organic farms, providing a clue as to the geographical patterns of MAP-positive bulk-tank samples and relationship to production type. Bulk-milk PCR positivity was also higher for large relative to small herds. The models revealed that bulk-milk PCR result could predict ELISA OD, with PCR-positive results corresponding to high bulk-milk ELISA titers. Similarly, ELISA was a predictor of PCR result, although the association was stronger for organic farms. Despite agreement between high bulk-milk ELISA titers and positive PCR results, a large proportion of high ELISA farms had PCR-negative bulk tanks, suggesting that farms are able to maintain satisfactory hygiene and management despite a presence of MAP in these herds...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: In this connection, {{the object}} of this study has been to {{identify}} and compare the microbiological contamination and residue chlorine levels in the main network water that is taken from the Dicle Dam and distributed in Diyarbakir Province Centre and in the tanks of dwellings that use this water {{as well as the}} effects of the maintenance, hygiene, and physical conditions of these <b>tanks</b> on microbiological <b>contamination.</b> METHODS: Water samples were taken from both the tank input side network water and tank output side tank waters of 200 dwellings with water tanks in Diyarbakir city centre (tank entrance network side water for 200 and tank output side tank water for 200) {{within the framework of the}} research study. RESULTS: Coliform bacteria were detected in 35 % of the tank entrance side network water samples and in 52. 0 % percent of the tank output side water samples. Faecal coliform bacteria were not detected in tank entrance side network water samples, but they existed in 2. 5 % of the tank output side water samples. Free residue chlorine level was found to be over 0. 2 ppm in 67 % of tank entrance side network water samples and in 35 % of the tank output side water samples. Coliform bacteria were detected in 95. 5 % of the tank entrance side network water samples, of which free residue chlorine level were below 0. 2 ppm. Total germ growth was detected in 52. 0 % of the tank entrance side network water samples and in 67. 5 % of the tank output side water samples. The most frequently isolated bacteria both in tank entrance side network and tank output side water samples were found to be Bacillus spp. Bacillus type bacteria were found in 48 % of tank entrance side network water samples and 57. 5 % of the tank output side water samples. Filamentous fungi were prevalent in 8 % of all the samples examined within the study and the most commonly isolated filamentous fungi were Aspergillus spp (5. 5 %) and Penicillum spp (2. 5 %). Water tanks of dwellings contain more micro-organisms as compared to municipal network waters. CONCLUSION: Dwelling water system may be chemically and microbiologically polluted, so it should be analyzed periodically. [TAF Prev Med Bull. 2008; 7 (1) : 15 - 24...|$|R
