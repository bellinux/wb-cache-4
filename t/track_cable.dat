50|$|An {{aerial tramway}} {{consists}} {{of one or}} two fixed <b>cables</b> (called <b>track</b> <b>cables),</b> one loop of cable (called a haulage rope), and a number of passenger cabins. The fixed cables provide support for the cabins while the haulage rope, by means of a grip, is solidly connected to the truck (the wheel set that rolls on the <b>track</b> <b>cables).</b> An electric motor drives the haulage rope which provides propulsion. Aerial tramways are constructed as reversible systems; vehicles shuttling back and forth between two end terminals and propelled by a cable loop which stops and reverses direction when the cabins arrive at the end stations. Aerial tramways differ from gondola lifts in that gondola lifts are considered continuous systems (cabins attached onto a circulating haul rope that moves continuously).|$|R

50|$|The 1990 Tbilisi {{aerial tramway}} {{accident}} was an aerial tramway accident in Tbilisi, {{the capital of}} Soviet Georgia on June 1, 1990, which resulted in 20 deaths and at least 15 injuries. The accident involved 2 gondolas on a ropeway route between Rustaveli Avenue and Mount Mtatsminda. The red gondola number 1 {{was on its way}} down from the slope of the mountain nearing the lower supporting tower and the red gondola number 2 was nearing an upper tower, when the hauling rope broke inside the coupler of the upper gondola. Both gondolas rolled down simultaneously. The lower gondola slammed into the wall of the lower station injuring people and killing 4. The upper gondola generated a higher speed (the length of ropeway was 863,3 meters); on reaching the lower support tower, it struck the broken hauling rope which was hanging on the tower, causing the cable to tear the gondola apart. The collision was so strong that the <b>track</b> <b>cable</b> fell off the tower, dangling the cut open gondola above the rooftops. This also caused the cabin to slide further down, striking the rooftop of a six-story building. This caused even further destruction to the gondola and caused people to fall 20 meters onto the rooftops and ground below. Overall, 20 people were killed and at least 15 badly injured. Most of them were children on a sightseeing tour in Tbilisi from regional town Akhaltsikhe school number 5.Children's Day. Witnesses in both gondolas who survived say that brakes did not work in either of the gondolas despite the desperate attempts from guides and passengers who helped them to pull the brakes.|$|E
40|$|Purpose. To {{estimate}} {{influence of}} elastic deformations of the <b>track</b> <b>cable</b> arising at movement of cars, on effort in a hauling rope of the aerial ropeway. Methodology. The method of consecutive approaches {{was used for}} research influence of elastic deformations of a <b>track</b> <b>cable</b> on effort in a hauling rope. Thus, definition of a tension of a <b>track</b> <b>cable</b> was carried out with use of the technique based on principles of modular configuration, the essence of which consists in formation of mathematical model {{by a combination of}} blocks of the formulas describing balance of the <b>track</b> <b>cable</b> on supports. Findings. The research has shown that influence of elastic deformations of a <b>track</b> <b>cable</b> on effort in a hauling rope was insignificant (less than 1 %). That points to possibility not to consider change of the <b>track</b> <b>cable</b> length, caused by its elastic properties, when modeling loading of elements of system «drive – traction rope – tension device». Also it has been found that use of the tension device of a <b>track</b> <b>cable</b> increased influence of its elastic properties on loading of rope system elements. At the same time the elastic component of the <b>track</b> <b>cable</b> tension in the test flight does not depend on a car position in the adjacent span, but only determines by the parameters of the rope system. Originality. The possibility of excluding the changes of <b>track</b> <b>cable</b> length caused by its elastic properties, when modeling loading of elements of system «drive – traction rope – tension device» was proved. Practical value. The use of these techniques and the results will simplify the mathematical model of loading of elements of the cable system and the system «drive – traction rope – tension device» as a whole...|$|E
