40|$|Airplane Pose {{is a short}} novel {{told from}} the {{perspective}} of three different narrators, all telling the same story. Lenny, Bradley, and Mason, all “disabled” in their own way, witness a woman, Nadia, fall to her death outside their apartment building. Airplane Pose chronicles the events, inside and outside of the narrators 2 ̆ 7 minds, following her death. By using three different narrators, questions of narrative reliability are raised, particularly when issues of reality are called into question. Lenny desires to escape to a different reality, Mason 2 ̆ 7 s grip on his own reality is revealed to be unsteady and unpredictable, and Bradley attempts to understand the reality in which he exists. While reality doesn 2 ̆ 7 t change for any of the characters, each comes <b>to</b> <b>term</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> or her own ambiguous reality, just as the exact cause of Nadia 2 ̆ 7 s death is never truly established [...] This unknown reality mirrors the unknown and ever-changing ideas of disability or ability; arguably, every character in the novel is in some way disabled, whether mentally, intellectually, or emotionally, which forces the question: is anyone actually abled?

5|$|Nadal {{defeated}} Federer in 5 sets in 4 {{hours and}} 19 minutes, with the match finishing after midnight, {{to become the}} first Spaniard to win the Australian Open. The match was lauded {{as one of the greatest}} ever at the Australian Open and it was yet another high quality match between two of the greatest players of all time, only 6 months since their epic 2008 Wimbledon final. It was a match of huge significance as had Federer won the match he would have equalled the all-time Grand Slam tournament record of 14 by Pete Sampras and the open-era record for most Australian Open titles of 4 with Andre Agassi (he would go on to achieve these in the near future). However, as a result of Nadal winning he set his own records, holding 3 of the 4 slams at the same time for the first time in his career. Not only that but he became the first man in the open-era to hold 3 Grand Slam tournament titles on 3 different surfaces at the same time. This victory over Federer many believed brought about a change in the tennis standings as Nadal was now clearly the number 1 player after Federer had that title for over 4 and a half years consecutively with Nadal deemed the second best for nearly 3 years of that. The defeat brought Federer to tears as he came <b>to</b> <b>terms</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> loss.|$|E
5|$|The regular cast is {{introduced}} in season one, with storylines involving a villain deriving power from kryptonite exposure.

Smallvilles first season primarily dealt with Clark Kent's coming <b>to</b> <b>terms</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> alien origin and {{the revelation that}} his arrival on Earth {{was connected to the}} death of Lana Lang's parents. After the first season the series had fewer villain-of-the-week episodes, focusing instead on individual-character story arcs and exploring Clark's origins. Major storylines include Clark's discovery of his Kryptonian heritage and Lex Luthor's escalating conflict with his father, Lionel. The disembodied voice of Clark's father, Jor-El, {{is introduced}}; he communicates to Clark through his spaceship, setting the stage for plots involving his role in fulfilling Clark's earthly destiny. In a fourth-season arc Clark, instructed by Jor-El, searches for three Kryptonian stones which contain the knowledge of the universe and form his Fortress of Solitude. Clark battles Brainiac in his attempts to release the Kryptonian criminal General Zod, and must capture (or destroy) other escaped Phantom Zone criminals. His cousin Kara arrives, and Lex Luthor discovers Clark's secret. The eighth season introduces Davis Bloome (Smallvilles version of Doomsday), and Tess Mercer replaces the departing Lex Luthor. Justin Hartley becomes a series regular as Oliver Queen (Green Arrow) after being a recurring guest in season six. In the ninth season Major Zod (Callum Blue) and other members of Zod's military group are revived (without their Kryptonian powers) by Tess Mercer, and their efforts to regain their powers are the season's central conflict. The final season revolves around Clark's attempts to lose his doubts and fears and become the hero he is meant to be, while confronting his biggest challenges: the coming of Darkseid and the return of Lex Luthor.|$|E
