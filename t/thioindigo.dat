50|$|During a visit at {{his parents}} in Königsberg, he got engaged and married Martha Kobligk; they had three daughters. Although he liked staying in Germany, Friedländer {{accepted}} a position at the Technologische Gewerbemuseum in Vienna in 1895. During that time, he discovered the <b>thioindigo.</b> His research on the color variations in substituted indigoes yielded numerous patents and was applied in industrial production. Friedländer isolated and analyzed the natural dyestuff of Tyrian purple. He was able to obtain 12,000 Murex brandaris from biologists working at the Mediterranean sea. In a complicated process, he isolated 1.4 g of pure Tyrian purple. Contrary to his expectations, the compound did not contain sulfur, but was a bromine substituted indigo, which had been already synthesized back in 1903. Friedlander was awarded the Lieben Prize for this discovery.|$|E

40|$|Maya Blue {{has been}} the focus of {{numerous}} studies and is believed to be a mixture of palygorskite clay and indigo dye. 1, 2 Several derivatives of this pigment have been developed with intriguing properties. For instance, the dye <b>thioindigo</b> reacts with the palygorskite clay to exhibit a broad range of colors from red to blue under UV-Vis excitation. Based on FT-Raman and computer simulation, previous work performed in our group could relate indigo and <b>thioindigo</b> interaction to the aluminum sites in the framework. 3, 4 ^ The work performed with other inorganic host materials such as, layer structures and zeolites have displayed reversible acid indicator properties, similar to the ones observed in concentrated sulfuric acid. Spectroscopic analyses and computer modeling of the above mentioned interactions have been evaluated. Results obtained by these techniques showed that in dehydrated materials a disturbance of <b>thioindigo</b> C=O at 1655 cm- 1 to lower frequencies occurs, due to the C=O [...] -Lewis acid sites (LAS) interaction. In the presence of water, a smaller C=O shift due to C=O [...] -HO(H) LAS was observed. Moreover, displacement of the 001 plane in some layer materials confirmed the effect of water on the color changes displayed by UV-Vis spectroscopy. ^ Based on these premises, it was concluded that weak electron donor-acceptor interactions took place between <b>thioindigo</b> functional groups (electron donors) and LAS of the aluminum silicate framework (electron acceptor). LAS (extra-framework aluminum and exchangeable cations) high hydration enthalpy made them extremely susceptible to water molecules (electron donors); generating a hydrogen bond between the two sites.

The photoinduced trans-to-cis isomerization as well as the opposite thermal cis-to-trans conversion was followed by visible spectroscopy. No photoisomerization was observed for samples exhibiting Na+ in S(II*) or S(III) cation sites, thus blocking the torsional motion.

40|$|The {{photochemical}} reaction dynamics {{of a set}} of photochromic compounds based on <b>thioindigo</b> and stilbene molecular parts (hemithioindigos, HTI) are presented. Photochemical Z/E isomerization around the central double bond occurs with time constants of 216 ps (Z → E) and 10 ps (E → Z) for a 5 -methyl-hemithioindigo. Chemical substitution on the stilbene moiety causes unusually strong changes in the reaction rate. Electron-donating substituents in the position para to the central double bond (e. g., para-methoxy) strongly accelerate the reaction, while the reaction is drastically slowed by electron-withdrawing groups in this position (e. g., para-nitrile). We correlate the experimental data of seven HTI-compounds in a quantitative manner using the Hammett equation and present a qualitative explanation for the application of ground-state Hammett constants to describe the photoisomerization reaction. ...|$|E

40|$|Density Functional Theory (DFT) is a {{powerful}} tool {{that can be used}} to model various systems in materials science. Our research applies DFT to two problems of interest. First, an organic/inorganic complex dye system known as a Mayan pigment is modeled to determine chemical binding sites, verifying each model with physical data such as UV/Vis spectra. Preliminary studies on palygorskite-based mayan pigments (mayacrom blue, mayacrom purple) show excellent agreement with experimental studies when using a dimer dye geometry binding with tetrahedrally-coordinated aluminum impurity sites in palygorksite. This approach is applied to a sepiolite-based organic/inorganic dye system using <b>thioindigo</b> attached to a tetrahedral aluminum impurity site with an additional aluminum impurity site in close proximity to the binding site.

40|$|N the 1980 s vat dyes, bearing {{about 60}} 1 C. I. Names (I), were {{available}} in the U. S. under about 260 different trade names. This collection of dyes has not changed much in recent years. About 60 % of them have C. I. Numbers-i. e., ihe chemical structure of the principle color component is known; 85 % are derivatives of anthraquinone, and of these almost 50 % fall into only five chemical structure subgroups; indigo derivatives and the related <b>thioindigo</b> derivatives account for about 10 % of the list. As a class, vat dyes are expensive, although they share this characteristic with some fiber reactive dyes. One shouid not overlook the 10 % of so-called sulfurized vat dyes, which are more economical hybrids of sulfur and vat dyes. The practical details of using vat dyes in both batch and continuous processes are covered in this second and final part of Chapter 3. Vat dyes generally offer superior fastness properties. Potential drawbacks to selecting vat dyes include a tendency for phototendering and a limited color gamut. Based on the substantivities of leuco-vat anions, the traditional classification system for vat dyes offers batch dyers a better means for selecting vat dyes to be used successfully in combination. Leuco-vat dyeing, prepigmentation, semipigmentation and batch aftertreatments are covered. While continuous dyeing with vats offers economic advantages, several precautions are required to ensure a satisfactory result.

40|$|This work {{addresses}} relaxation {{mechanisms of}} photoexcited organic molecules {{of small and}} medium size, up to 62 atoms. For most systems it is investigated theoretically, how modifications, often {{in the form of}} substituents, influence the decay processes. The research in large parts is done in close collaboration with groups providing experimental data, which allows to formulate robust hypotheses and models. Four systems are discussed in this context. We find the formation of the dewar lesion in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) to only occur, when the nucleobase is embedded in the DNA backbone, which sterically hinders accessing alternative channels. Substituting hydroxy groups at certain points of <b>thioindigo</b> is shown to open up an efficient deactivation channel via excited state intramolecular proton transfer, and greatly enhance the photostability of the molecule. By substituting electron donating groups to the stilbene moiety of the hemithioindigo photoswitch and correlating their effect to their Hammett parameters, the isomerization speed of hemithioindigo is optimized. And lastly, when adding an aldehyde group to furan, an additional pathway is found for its derivatives furfural and β-furfural. Their relaxation is slowed down regardless. The effects on the excited state potential energy surfaces are described as general means, by which the surfaces can be influenced, and likely can be translated to other molecules as well. This eventually allows to predict properties and tailor molecules to yield desired behavior. In this context, for example for furan, furfural and β-furfural the structural implications of the aldehyde substituent on one conical intersection are deducted from the extended two-electron two-orbital model prior to any calculations or experiments. Alongside the system specific investigations, an interface for the on-the-fly dynamics package NewtonX to the quantum chemistry package Molpro was programmed. Non-adiabatic semiclassical on-the-fly dynamics are a powerful tool to simulate complete relaxation processes without constraints in the dimensionality. For the interface, which in its primary setup uses complete active space self consistent field theory calculations, a number of features has been implemented. Most notably, it enables non-adiabtatic dynamics on complete active space perturbation and ONIOM level of theory...|$|E
40|$|Within the {{framework}} of this dissertation E/Z isomers, that allow experimental access to basic concepts of photochemistry, especially molecular switches, were investigated. The scientific results can be summarized as follows: 1. The isomers of <b>thioindigo</b> show differences in their UV/VIS absorption spectra. According to the spectra the isomers can be photochemically switched in both directions between two isomers and thermally from Z→E. A physical separation by thin layer chromatography was not possible. 2. An E/Z isomerization of stilbene could not be proved. Spectroscopic measurements showed the formation of phenanthrene as by-product, that limits the use of stilbene as a reversible switch. 3. Known experiments with azobenzene were reproduced successfully with new light sources. The azobenzene derivatives dimethyl-azobenzene- 4, 4 ’-dicarboxylate and methyl red show reversible photochemical switching between two isomeric states. Unfortunately a physical separation of the isomers was unsuccessful in both cases. 4. Diazocine and diamino-diazocine were synthesized following published instructions, though the yields {{did not meet the}} expectations. All experimental data from other sources were reproduced successfully. Furthermore a series of experiments with thin layer chromatography of diazocine was realized. The preparation of an intelligent foil with diazocine in a polystyrene matrix failed. 5. Pure E -diazocine was isolated successfully and UV/VIS spectra as well as X-ray crystal structures and X-ray powder diffraction of the thermally less stable E -isomer could be recorded successfully. So it was possible to clarify the crystal structure of E -diazocine. The results comply with theoretical computations. Furthermore it could be shown that the E→Z isomerization of diazocine proceed completely in solid state whereas the Z→E isomerization only takes place at the surface of a crystal. The thermal half-life of E -diazocine was determined in ethyl acetate at 20 °C. An NMR spectra of E -diazocine could be measured. However the existence of two conformers of E -diazocine could not be confirmed by NMR spectroscopy. The scientific investigations about E/Z isomers provide the basis for research in chemical education and the development of didactic materials: 1. At first the importance of E/Z isomerization for current research and development was shown and thus the relevance for school education. Different basic concepts were included that allow the implementation of E/Z isomerizations in chemical education in the upper secondary level. An important fundamental issue is the energy concept “ground state and electronic excited state” as starting point for all photochemical reactions. 2. An educational video about the photochemical isomerization of azobenzene was made to allow an indirect experimental access for E/Z isomerizations in school. 3. Diazocine is a suitable substitution for azobenzene in school. Diazocine is not yet banned for school experiments. All experiments with azobenzene can also be realized with diazocine. In addition the isomers of diazocine show different colours, so a sheer phenomenological view with simple experiments is possible. 4. The experimental kit “photo-switch” was developed to allow an experimental approach to photochemical E/Z isomerizations and to introduce diazocine as an innovative substance in school education. 5. A designed and programmed flash animation about E/Z isomerizations represents an important media to support this topic for teaching. It allows a dynamic view of the processes on particle level. Learners can explore the animation alone or in small groups and the set-up of this media allows a diverse usage. As a service for teachers all developed materials (video, flash-animation, experimental set “photo-switch”), that have already been tested in school with a positive feedback, are available online for free. By that and by presenting this topic in publications and on conferences the dissemination of E/Z isomerizations as a school relevant issue is promoted...|$|E
