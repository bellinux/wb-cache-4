40|$|Using {{cooperative}} {{behavior in}} economic decision-making settings, we predicted {{and found that}} people’s susceptibility <b>to</b> <b>priming</b> influences is moderated by two factors: people’s chronic accessibility to a behavioral repertoire and people’s self-concept activation. In Experiment 1, we show that individuals highly consistent in their social value orientation (SVO) assimilate their behavior to their dispositions rather than <b>to</b> the <b>primes,</b> whereas the opposite effect is obtained among individuals with a low consistent SVO. In Experiment 2, we show that low consistent SVO individuals become less susceptible <b>to</b> <b>priming</b> influences when their self-concept is activated. These studies shed new light on individuals’ susceptibility <b>to</b> <b>priming</b> influences on social behavior. " [author's abstract...|$|R

5|$|According <b>to</b> <b>Prime</b> Minister Einar Gerhardsen, it took long {{to persuade}} Meisdalshagen to even take the post as Minister of Finance, {{and he was}} more {{interested}} in agro-economical questions than traditional planning of the economy. It was even said that Gerhardsen's Cabinet had an interest in luring Meisdalshagen away from the Parliament, where he had driven through significant increases in farmer's income, threatening the overall balance and planning of the state finances. In fact the income from farming, measured in the amount of money earned per decare, was doubled between the war's end in 1945 and 1950, when the Main Agreement for Agriculture, , was introduced. It regulated future price negotiations, and institutionalized the negotiating partners: the state {{on one side of the}} table, the Norwegian Agrarian Association and the Norwegian Farmers and Smallholders Union on the other.|$|E
5|$|Armed {{with an air}} gun, Huseby {{threatened}} a cabin attendant and told the captain to proceed as planned to Fornebu. He claimed (falsely) to have placed explosives on board.

The plane landed at 15:30 at Fornebu and was surrounded by the police. After one hour, Huseby released 70 hostages in exchange for having the aircraft being {{moved closer to the}} terminal building. Thirty minutes later, Huseby released the remaining passengers. He drank throughout the incident, and at 17:30, after he consumed the plane's beer supply, he surrendered his weapon in exchange for more beer.

In gratitude, Rana Bahadur made Bhimsen a kaji (equivalent to a minister) of the newly formed government.

40|$|Learned {{associations}} between stimuli and responses (S–R associations) make important contributions to behavioral and neural priming. The current {{study investigated the}} automaticity and flexibility of these S–R associations and whether the global task {{context in which they}} occur modulates the impact of S–R retrieval on priming. Participants engaged in a semantic repetition priming task in which S–R retrieval is known <b>to</b> influence <b>priming.</b> Across participants, repetition priming occurred in global task contexts (i. e., combination of activated task sets) that either remained consistent or shifted across time. In the stable context group, the global task context at study matched that at test, whereas in the shifting context group, the global task context at study differed from that at test. Results revealed that the stability of the global task context did not affect the magnitude of S–R contributions <b>to</b> <b>priming</b> and that S–R contributions <b>to</b> <b>priming</b> were significant in both the stable and shifting context groups. These results highlight the robustness of S–R contributions <b>to</b> <b>priming</b> and indicate that S–R associations can flexibly transfer across changes in higher-level task states...|$|R

He demanded to receive guarantees for a better treatment and economic security from the authorities. Assisted by a psychologist, the police negotiated with Huseby. One hour after the plane landed, 70 passengers were let out of the plane. The first group were those passengers who had or claimed they had transfers to other flights. In exchange, the aircraft was {{moved closer to the}} terminal building. The passengers were picked up by a bus and transported to the domestic terminal, where they were questioned by the police.

However, there were continuing concerns that not enough was being done to revitalise and secure the newly liberated areas. By 26 March, the allied forces had liberated ten towns within the month, including Qoryoley and El Buur.
