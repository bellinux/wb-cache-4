25|$|The {{manufacture}} of machine tools {{was once a}} major industry in Coventry. Alfred Herbert Ltd {{became one of the}} largest machine tool companies in the world. In later years the company faced competition from foreign machine tool builders and ceased trading in 1983. Other Coventry machine tool manufacturers included A. C. Wickman, and Webster & Bennett. The last Coventry machine <b>tool</b> <b>manufacturer</b> was Matrix Churchill which was forced to close {{in the wake of the}} Iraqi Supergun (Project Babylon) scandal.|$|E
40|$|AbstractMachine <b>tool</b> <b>manufacturers</b> {{realized}} that offering {{a high quality}} technical product is not sufficient considering the rising customer requirements. To commit customers and differ from the competitors machine <b>tool</b> <b>manufacturers</b> provide services which support the production of their customers. To guarantee a high quality Product-Service Systems (PSS) machine <b>tool</b> <b>manufacturers</b> have to analyze how well their PSS fulfills {{the requirements of the}} customers. Therefore, an assessment tool is necessary to control the quality of PSS. In this paper a software demonstrator is presented that serves for assessing the quality of PSS. The demonstrator is developed during a project with machine <b>tool</b> <b>manufacturers.</b> An overview of the project results will be presented by means of developed use cases and determined requirements of the lead-users of the project partners. Based on the customer requirements of the lead-users quality criteria are developed and clustered to generally valid PSS quality criteria. To measure the PSS quality criteria Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are developed with the project partners. These KPIs are monitored within the software demonstrator which supports machine <b>tool</b> <b>manufacturers</b> to measure and control their PSS...|$|R

50|$|The {{history of}} the {{association}} is the {{history of the}} machine tool industry in India. The concept of binding machine <b>tool</b> <b>manufacturers</b> into an association was first mooted at an informal gathering of ‘like-minded’ manufacturers. The manufacturers met at a formal gathering in New Delhi on 20 September 1946 to concretise the thoughts of bringing together all machine <b>tool</b> <b>manufacturers</b> under one umbrella body. The meeting chaired by Sir Dhunjishaw B. Cooper came up with the name of “Indian Machine Tool Manufacturers’ Association” or IMTMA in short for this umbrella body representing the interest of the machine tool industry. The association was granted instant recognition by the government as a body representing machine <b>tool</b> <b>manufacturers</b> in the country. IMTMA was constituted with 19 members.|$|R
