40|$|<b>The</b> three <b>Himalayan</b> lithologic units, <b>the</b> Lesser <b>Himalayan</b> Sequence, <b>the</b> Greater <b>Himalayan</b> Crystalline complex, and <b>the</b> Tethyan <b>Himalayan</b> Sequence, have a {{specific}} structural correlation with the Main Central thrust and South Tibet detachment in the central Himalaya. There, the Main Central thrust places <b>the</b> Greater <b>Himalayan</b> Crystalline complex over <b>the</b> Lesser <b>Himalayan</b> Sequence, and <b>the</b> South Tibet detachment places <b>the</b> Tethyan <b>Himalayan</b> Sequence over <b>the</b> Greater <b>Himalayan</b> Crystallines. Although this division has {{formed the basis for}} all Himalayan tectonic models, it fails to explain aspects of the geology of the western Himalaya where the Main Central thrust places <b>the</b> Tethyan <b>Himalayan</b> Sequence directly above <b>the</b> Lesser <b>Himalayan</b> Sequence. Our mapping in NW India shows that this relationship results from southward merging of the Main Central thrust and South Tibet detachment. This finding, in conjunction with observed alternating shear senses on the South Tibet detachment, is inconsistent with the wedge-extrusion and erosion-induced channel-flow models (both require only top-to-the-N motion on the South Tibet detachment) but is consistent with a tectonic-wedging model. © 2007 The Geological Society of America.

40|$|The {{study area}} {{consists}} of three tectonic zones from south to north, they are <b>the</b> Siwalik, Lesser <b>Himalayan</b> Sequence and Higher Himalaya Crystalline thrust sheet. <b>The</b> Lesser <b>Himalayan</b> Sequence is composed of chlorite, biotite and garnet grade metasediments and augen gneiss. <b>The</b> Higher <b>Himalayan</b> Crystalline thrust sheet is composed of kyanite to sillimanite grade paragneiss, orthogneiss and quartzite. The area is affected mainly by two deformational episodes (i) Syn-MCT metamorphic ductile deformation and (ii) Post-MCT metamorphic deformation. Syn-MCT metamorphic ductile deformation is characterized by (a) development of bedding-parallel foliation and syn-metamorphic stretching lineations trending NNE- SSW and (b) development of S-C structure. Three sub phases of the post-MCT metamorphic deformation are observed {{in the study area}} viz. (a) development of folds, (b) new generation of foliation and extensional shearing features and (c) small-scale brittle fault, shear bands and cross-cut veins. <b>The</b> Lesser <b>Himalayan</b> Sequence has been metamorphosed to greenschist-amphibolite facies whereas <b>the</b> Higher <b>Himalayan</b> Crystalline thrust sheet has been metamorphosed to amphibolite to granulite facies. At least two metamorphic events could be recorded in <b>the</b> Lesser <b>Himalayan</b> Sequence. During Pre <b>Himalayan</b> metamorphic phase, <b>the</b> Lesser <b>Himalayan</b> Sequence might be metamorphosed up to anchizone grade prograde metamorphism(?). But Eo-Himalayan metamorphic phase could not affect <b>the</b> Lesser <b>Himalayan</b> Sequence. <b>The</b> Neo-Himalayan (Syn-MCT) metamorphic phase has been recorded on S-C fabric and is revealed by inverted metamorphic zonation in <b>the</b> Lesser <b>Himalayan</b> Sequence. <b>The</b> final phase in <b>the</b> Lesser <b>Himalayan</b> Sequence was retrograde phase shown by chloritization of garnet and biotite. At least three metamorphic events are recognized in <b>the</b> Higher <b>Himalayan</b> Crystalline thrust sheet of the study area. In the Eo-Himalayan (pre-MCT) metamorphic event kyanite grade prograde metamorphism has been occurred. This is followed by sillimanite grade retrograde metamorphism (lower P/high T) on the hanging wall of MCT and is assigned as Neo-Himalayan (Syn-MCT) metamorphic event. Finally the replacement of garnet and biotite by chlorite is the third (retrogressive metamorphic event) occurred during post MCT movement...|$|R

5|$|Suillus sibiricus {{has been}} {{recorded}} in parts of Europe, North America and Siberia. The fungus forms strict ectomycorrhizal associations with pines of the subgenus Strobus. These include Swiss pine (Pinus cembra) in the Alps and Tatras of central Europe, Macedonian pine (P.peuce) in the Balkans, western white pine (P.monticola) and limber pine (P.flexilis) in the Pacific Northwest of North America, P.banksiana in Quebec, Canada, and Siberian pine (P.sibirica) and Siberian dwarf pine (P.pumila) in Siberia and the Russian Far East. The range of the fungus is hence limited by {{the distribution of the}} host tree.

5|$|The {{ascent of}} Dhruva Dharavarsha's third son, Govinda III, {{to the throne}} heralded an era of success like never before. There is {{uncertainty}} about {{the location of the}} early capital of the Rashtrakutas at this time. During his rule there was a three way conflict between the Rashtrakutas, the Palas and the Pratiharas for control over the Gangetic plains. Describing his victories over the Pratihara Emperor Nagabhatta II and the Pala Emperor Dharmapala, the Sanjan inscription states the horses of Govinda III drank from the icy waters of <b>the</b> <b>Himalayan</b> streams and his war elephants tasted the sacred waters of the Ganges. His military exploits have been compared to those of Alexander the Great and Arjuna of Mahabharata. Having conquered Kannauj, he travelled south, took firm hold over Gujarat, Kosala (Kaushal), Gangavadi, humbled the Pallavas of Kanchi, installed a ruler of his choice in Vengi and received two statues as an act of submission from the king of Ceylon (one statue of the king and another of his minister). The Cholas, the Pandyas and the Cheras all paid him tribute. As one historian puts it, the drums of the Deccan were heard from <b>the</b> <b>Himalayan</b> caves to the shores of the Malabar. The Rashtrakutas empire now spread over the areas from Cape Comorin to Kannauj and from Banaras to Bharuch.|$|E

5|$|According to a {{traditional}} account, Hanuman went to Valmiki numerous times to hear him sing the Ramayana, but Valmiki turned down the request saying that Hanuman being a monkey was unworthy of hearing the epic. After the victory of Rama over Ravana, Hanuman went to the Himalayas to continue his worship of Rama. There he scripted a play version of the Ramayana called Mahanataka or Hanuman Nataka engraved on <b>the</b> <b>Himalayan</b> rocks using his nails. When Valmiki saw the play written by Hanuman, he anticipated that {{the beauty of the}} Mahanataka would eclipse his own Ramayana. Hanuman was saddened at Valmiki's state of mind and, being a true bhakta without any desire for glory, Hanuman cast all the rocks into the ocean, some parts of which are believed to be available today as Hanuman Nataka. After this, Valmiki was instructed by Hanuman to take birth as Tulsidas and compose the Ramayana in the vernacular.|$|E
