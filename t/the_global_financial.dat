5|$|<b>The</b> <b>global</b> <b>financial</b> crisis precipitated in 2007 and 2008 shared {{some of the}} key {{features}} exhibited by the wave of international financial crises in the 1990s, including accelerated capital influxes, weak regulatory frameworks, relaxed monetary policies, herd behavior during investment bubbles, collapsing asset prices, and massive deleveraging. The systemic problems originated in the United States and other advanced nations. Similarly to the 1997 Asian crisis, the global crisis entailed broad lending by banks undertaking unproductive real estate investments as well as poor standards of corporate governance within financial intermediaries. Particularly in the United States, the crisis was characterized by growing securitization of non-performing assets, large fiscal deficits, and excessive financing in the housing sector. While the real estate bubble in the U.S. triggered the financial crisis, the bubble was financed by foreign capital flowing from many different countries. As its contagious effects began infecting other nations, the crisis became a precursor for the global economic downturn now referred to as the Great Recession. In the wake of the crisis, total volume of world trade in goods and services fell 10% from 2008 to 2009 and did not recover until 2011, with an increased concentration in emerging market countries. <b>The</b> <b>global</b> <b>financial</b> crisis demonstrated the negative effects of worldwide financial integration, sparking discourse on how and whether some countries should decouple themselves from the system altogether.|$|E
5|$|The real GDP {{growth rate}} from 2002 to 2007 {{averaged}} 6.8 percent annually, which made Turkey {{one of the}} fastest growing economies in the world during that period.

According to Eurostat data, Turkish GDP per capita adjusted by purchasing power standard stood at 52 percent of the EU average in 2011.|$|E

5|$|While <b>the</b> <b>global</b> <b>financial</b> {{system is}} edging toward greater stability, governments {{must deal with}} differing {{regional}} or national needs. Some nations are trying to orderly discontinue unconventional monetary policies installed to cultivate recovery, while others are expanding their scope and scale. Emerging market policymakers face a challenge of precision as they must carefully institute sustainable macroeconomic policies during extraordinary market sensitivity without provoking investors to retreat their capital to stronger markets. Nations' inability to align interests and achieve international consensus on matters such as banking regulation has perpetuated the risk of future global financial catastrophes.|$|E
5|$|A country's {{decision}} to operate an open economy and globalize its financial capital carries monetary implications {{captured by the}} balance of payments.

Both individuals and groups may participate in <b>the</b> <b>global</b> <b>financial</b> system. Consumers and international businesses undertake consumption, production, and investment. Governments and intergovernmental bodies act as purveyors of international trade, economic development, and crisis management. Regulatory bodies establish financial regulations and legal procedures, while independent bodies facilitate industry supervision. Research institutes and other associations analyze data, publish reports and policy briefs, and host public discourse on global financial affairs.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} {{currency}} devaluations and oil crises in the 1970s led most countries to float their currencies. The world economy became increasingly financially integrated in the 1980s and 1990s due to capital account liberalization and financial deregulation. A series of financial crises in Europe, Asia, and Latin America followed with contagious effects due to greater exposure to volatile capital flows. <b>The</b> <b>global</b> <b>financial</b> crisis, which {{originated in the}} United States in 2007, quickly propagated among other nations and is recognized as the catalyst for the worldwide Great Recession. A market adjustment to Greece's noncompliance with its monetary union in 2009 ignited a sovereign debt crisis among European nations known as the Eurozone crisis.|$|E

5|$|American {{economist}} and former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Paul Volcker {{has argued that}} the lack of global consensus on key issues threatens efforts to reform <b>the</b> <b>global</b> <b>financial</b> system. He has argued that quite possibly the most important issue is a unified approach to addressing failures of systemically important financial institutions, noting public taxpayers and government officials have grown disillusioned with deploying tax revenues to bail out creditors for the sake of stopping contagion and mitigating economic disaster. Volcker has expressed an array of potential coordinated measures: increased policy surveillance by the IMF and commitment from nations to adopt agreed-upon best practices, mandatory consultation from multilateral bodies leading to more direct policy recommendations, stricter controls on national qualification for emergency financing facilities (such as those offered by the IMF or by central banks), and improved incentive structures with financial penalties.|$|E

5|$|In March 2009, Nesbitt {{signed a}} {{contract}} with the American talent agency United Talent Agency, as <b>the</b> <b>global</b> <b>financial</b> crisis was restricting roles in British television. He continued to be represented in the United Kingdom by Artists Rights Group. The next year Nesbitt played the hunter Cathal in the low-budget British horror film Outcast, which was a departure from his previous character types. After screening at major international film festivals in early 2010, the film had a general release {{in the latter part of}} the year. Nesbitt had previously worked with the film's director and co-writer Colm McCarthy on Murphy's Law, which was one reason he took the role. He researched the mythical aspects of the character by reading about Irish folklore and beliefs. He also starred alongside Minnie Driver and his Welcome to Sarajevo co-star Goran Višnjić in the Tiger Aspect television serial The Deep. In the five-part drama, Nesbitt played submarine engineer Clem Donnelly. The serial was filmed over 12 weeks at BBC Scotland's studios in Dumbarton. August 2010 saw the release of Nadia Tass's film Matching Jack, in which Nesbitt plays the leading role of Connor. He became involved in the film after reading an early script draft in 2006. In 2008, <b>the</b> <b>global</b> <b>financial</b> crisis severely reduced the budget of the film, and Nesbitt volunteered a reduction in his salary so the film could still be made. The film was shot over eight weeks in Melbourne in 2009 and released in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, as of 2008, Japan {{still was}} Germany's second largest trading partner in Asia after China. In 2006, German imports from Japan totaled €15.6billion and German exports to Japan €14.2billion (15.4% and 9% {{more than the}} {{previous}} year, respectively). In 2008, however, Japanese exports and imports {{to and from the}} European Union fell by 7.8 and 4.8% after growing by 5.8% in 2007 due to <b>the</b> <b>global</b> <b>financial</b> crisis. Bilateral trade between Germany and Japan also shrank in 2008, with imports from Japan having dropped by 6.6% and German exports to Japan having declined by 5.5%. Despite Japan having remained Germany's principal trading partner in Asia after China in 2008, measured in terms of total German foreign trade, Japan’s share of both exports and imports is relatively low and falls well short of the potential between the world’s third- and fifth-largest economies.|$|E
5|$|Polling {{conducted}} throughout March 2009 by Maurice de Hond {{indicated the}} Party for Freedom {{was the most}} popular parliamentary party. The polls predicted that the party would take 21% of the national vote, winning 32 out of 150 seats in the Dutch parliament. If the polling results were replicated in an election, Wilders would be a major power broker. Under such circumstances, there would also be some likelihood of him becoming Prime Minister of the Netherlands. This has been partially attributed to timely prosecution attempts against him for hate speech and the travel ban imposed on him by the United Kingdom, as well as dissatisfaction with the Dutch government's response to <b>the</b> <b>global</b> <b>financial</b> crisis of 2008–2009.|$|E
