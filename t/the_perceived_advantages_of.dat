50|$|The {{concept of}} FAI was first {{described}} by Smith-Petersen. However, modern {{diagnosis and treatment}} of FAI was pioneered by Ganz in 2003, who initially advocated the use of an open surgical dislocation technique for treatment of intra-articular pathology. This involved the use of the 'trochanteric flip' approach {{to gain access to the}} hip joint. This is an extensive approach, needing an often large incision over the side of the hip, with the detachment of the greater trochanter of the femur and its attached musculature to gain access to the joint. By using this approach, the ball of the hip joint can be rotated out of the socket (termed 'surgical dislocation'), giving 360-degree access to the whole joint. This approach, although considered generally safe, carries with it inherent risks, which is the case with all large incision surgery. The risks of infection and blood clots are always present, and Ganz and his colleagues cite complications such as heterotopic ossification (new bone formation around the hip), nerve injuries, failure of the greater trochanter to heal back properly, persistent pain following the formation of scar tissue (adhesions) in the hip joint, and a small risk of damage of the blood supply to the femoral head. The patient usually needs to stay in hospital for a few days, and the post-operative rehabilitation after such extensive surgery can be prolonged. As a result, surgeons have looked to use the arthroscope more extensively in the hip joint in an attempt to avoid the possible pitfalls of large, open surgery. <b>The</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> this are the avoidance of large scars, decreased blood loss, faster recovery periods and less pain.

5000|$|A longstanding {{proposal}} {{to address the}} issue of the lack of uniformity in court interpretations of federal tax law has been to create a national court of tax appeals. [...] Indeed, a federal court of tax appeals appears to be the favored view of many academics who address the subject and some tax attorneys. [...] Under the approaches advocated, tax litigation could begin in the courts of original jurisdiction, as is currently the case, but the appeals would have to be made to a single, specialized court of tax appeals which would develop great expertise on tax law as well as reconcile divergent interpretations from the lower courts so that one consistent set of interpretations would prevail. <b>The</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> this approach is, as Professor Shores argues, “income realized by a resident of California ought to be taxed in the same way as income realized by a resident of Maine.” [...] Shores sees such consistency not only as sound policy, but as a constitutional mandate.|$|R

However, the estimate must be interpreted {{in light of the}} fact that the Fuelcost variable is set to zero for BEVs. The estimate includes, in other words, <b>the</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> having zero fuel cost throughout a vehicle’s lifetime. When we adjust for this, applying an average Fuelcost value of NOK 8.91 per 10  km, the BEVs’ market advantage is reduced to around NOK 66, 000  = € 7800. This estimate reflects the fact that, in Norway, BEVs enjoy a large number of privileges, such as access to the bus lane, exemption from road tolls and public parking charges, strongly reduced ferry fares, and free recharging in many public parking lots. Among BEV owners in Norway as of March 2016, the median value of these benefits has been estimated at NOK 10, 000  = € 1200 per year [13]. In certain parts of the country, the value of the toll exemption alone can exceed € 4000 per year for a motorist using a long bridge or subsea tunnel on his daily commute.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Models of {{incomplete}} information {{have played}} a major role in the fields of political science and political economy. The models have almost exclusively been signaling models, and their substantive focus is frequently on situations in which the extensive form is not dictated by institutional requirements or procedures. We explore the relation between multiple-sender signaling games and the corresponding screening or mechanism design games without transfers and establish an equivalence result. If there is a fully-revealing equilibrium in the signaling game there is also a full-information optimal mechanism that yields the principal’s optimal policy in every state. The converse, that fully-revealing equilibria exist in the signaling game if a full-information optimal mechanism exists, is true if and only if the mechanism involves only the selection of policies that are optimal for some belief about the state. We also present two straightforward sufficient conditions for the existence of full-information optimal mechanisms. When either holds, fully-revealing equilibria in the signaling and screening games exist. <b>The</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> signaling over the screening approach – that no commitment by the principal is assumed – may be over-stated as flexibility in specifying off the path beliefs can mimic commitment. ...|$|R

40|$|Background: This study {{aimed to}} explore the {{predictors}} of major satisfaction of nursing students and the mediating role of group identification, including gender differences. Methods: Data were collected from 270 students by questionnaire which included the scales of major satisfaction, group identification, perceived advantages and disadvantages due to gender, social support, experiences of supervision, Big Five factors, and self-esteem. Results: Male nursing students believed they had more advantages (males, M= 3. 34, females, M= 2. 79), as well as disadvantages (males, M= 2. 34, females, M= 1. 58), than female nursing students. It revealed that self-esteem (males, β= 0. 30, females, β= 0. 23), conscientiousness (males, β= 0. 40, females, β= 0. 19) and group identification (males, β= 0. 59, females, β= 0. 50) showed significant effect on major satisfaction in both gender. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> males, and social support of females, influenced major satisfaction through group identification. Conclusions: We found the powerful role of group identification in enhancing major satisfaction and key precursor of it differing based on gender.

Since serum proteins has been considered as useful vehicles for targeting tumors, in this study we investigated the effect of incorporation of human serum albumin (HSA) in branched polyethylenimine (bPEI) -siRNA polyplexes in their internalization in epithelial and endothelial cells. We observed that introduction of HSA preserves the capacity of bPEI to complex with siRNA and protect it against extracellular endonucleases, while affording significantly improved internalization and silencing efficiency, compared to bPEI-siRNA polyplexes in endothelial and metastatic breast cancer epithelial cells. Furthermore, the uptake of the HSA-bPEI-siRNA ternary polyplexes occurred primarily through a caveolae-mediated endocytosis, thus providing evidence for a clear role for HSA in polyplex internalization.
