5|$|Although {{there were}} several short spells when a third {{division}} was created, the two-division structure remained largely in place until 1975, when a major re-organisation of the league led to a new three-tier set-up {{and the creation of}} a new Premier Division at <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>level.</b> In 1998, the teams then in the Premier Division broke away to form the SPL, which supplanted the Premier Division as <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>level</b> of football in Scotland. The SPL and SFL merged in 2013 to form the Scottish Professional Football League (SPFL), which branded its top division as the Scottish Premiership.|$|E

50|$|The {{closure of}} the Three Bridges-Ashurst Junction line after the last train on Sunday 1 January 1967 spelt the end for <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>level</b> station and St Margaret's Loop which would receive no further traffic.

Although very nearly redundant, <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>level</b> goods sidings could still be accessed via <b>the</b> low to <b>high</b> <b>level</b> connecting spur; both spurs serving <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>level</b> station were however closed in 1967. The last train to use the station was in February 1968, a tracklifting train hauled by a Class 33 diesel locomotive. As the footbridge at the low-level platforms had been demolished in Summer 1965, passengers used <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>level</b> station as a short-cut between platforms, thereby avoiding the need to go around a local housing estate. <b>The</b> <b>high</b> <b>level's</b> demolition in 1970 led to protests from passengers {{at the loss of}} the short-cut, as a result of which British Rail erected a footbridge which today marks the site of <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>level</b> station.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{our work}} on analysing <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>level</b> search within a graph based hyperheuristic. The graph based hyperheuristic solves {{the problem at}} a <b>higher</b> <b>level</b> by searching through permutations of graph heuristics rather than the actual solutions. The heuristic permutations are then used to construct the solutions. Variable Neighborhood Search, Steepest Descent, Iterated Local Search and Tabu Search are compared. An analysis of their performance within <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>level</b> search space of heuristics is also carried out. Experimental results on benchmark exam timetabling problems demonstrate the simplicity and efficiency of this hyperheuristic approach. They also indicate that the choice of <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>level</b> search methodology is not crucial and <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>level</b> search should explore the heuristic search space as widely as possible within a limited searching time. This simple and general graph based hyperheuristic may be applied {{to a range of}} timetabling and optimisation problems...|$|R
