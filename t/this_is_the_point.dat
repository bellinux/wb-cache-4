But the statute went on to define additional crimes: theft or falsification of court records, perjury, bribery of federal judges, interference with judicial process, and liberation of federal prisoners. All of these were plainly necessary and proper to the operation of the federal courts; Marshall was to cite the perjury section as precedent for the existence of implicit powers in M'Culloch v.

5|$|In flashbacks, it is {{revealed}} that as children Tifa and Cloud {{had decided to}} follow a path to a mountain near their hometown of Nibelheim. However, they were both injured and Tifa {{was in a coma}} for a week, with her father holding Cloud responsible for the incident. Cloud eventually left to join Shinra's SOLDIER program in order to become stronger, but it is later revealed that he did it primarily to attract her attention. In response, she requested if she was ever in danger, he would return to save her. Years later, after Sephiroth destroyed the town of Nibelheim, Cloud rescued Tifa after she was wounded by Sephiroth. Surviving the incident, Tifa was taken to safety by her martial arts instructor Zangan, eventually arriving in Midgar and meeting AVALANCHE's leader, Barret Wallace. Upon recovering, she joined AVALANCHE so as to get revenge for the destruction of her home. She eventually encountered an incoherent Cloud at the city's train station, and convinced him to work for Barret, so as to keep him close and safe. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> at which the game begins.|$|E

25|$|The {{center of}} mass plays an {{important}} role in astronomy and astrophysics, where it is commonly referred to as the barycenter. The barycenter is the point between two objects where they balance each other; it is the {{center of mass}} where two or more celestial bodies orbit each other. When a moon orbits a planet, or a planet orbits a star, both bodies are actually orbiting around a point that lies away from the center of the primary (larger) body. For example, the Moon does not orbit the exact center of the Earth, but a point on a line between the center of the Earth and the Moon, approximately 1,710km (1,062miles) below the surface of the Earth, where their respective masses balance. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> about which the Earth and Moon orbit as they travel around the Sun. If the masses are more similar, e.g., Pluto and Charon, the barycenter will fall outside both bodies.|$|E

[...] And <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> to which the defense should direct itself..." [...] In 1964, Speer mentioned to Wolters in a letter that he would need the Chronik as a reference in revising his memoirs upon his release. [...] Wolter's response was to have Riesser retype the entire Chronik, leaving out any mention of the GBI's involvement in the persecution of the Jews, without telling Speer what he was doing. [...] Wolters later wrote that he did this to correct mistakes, to leave out extraneous matters, and [...] "above all to delete certain parts on the basis of which Speer and one or another of his colleagues could still have been prosecuted. [...] The Ludwigsburg Central office for 'war crimes' was still at work and an end of the persecution of National Socialists was not in sight." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the eastern}} plains, the Emigrant Trail follows the North Platte River into Wyoming. The trail follows the river {{upstream}} to Fort Laramie, a prominent military and trading {{post in the}} region. Prior to 1850 the northern {{side of the river}} was thought to be impassable beyond Fort Laramie, so the wagon trains that were traveling on the northern side of the river through Nebraska had to undertake a dangerous crossing at the fort. After crossing, trains on the main trail to the south of the river had to cross the North Platte again [...] upstream. In 1850 several wagon trains successfully blazed a path along the northern side of the river. This new route, which reduced the risk and expense of crossing the river twice, was preferred for all subsequent traffic on the northern side of the river. The northern route is sometimes called Child's Route after Andrew Child who describe it in a guide book published in 1852. Above Fort Laramie, Child's Route follows the North Platte River through the present day town of Douglas, and near the site of Fort Fetterman which was built in 1867. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> at which the Bozeman Trail turned north to the gold fields of Montana in the 1860s.|$|E
