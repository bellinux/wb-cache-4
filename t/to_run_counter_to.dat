Despite his accomplishments, he never wrote a book, held public office, or even kept books. Although {{he was not an}} abolitionist by definition, he had no problem teaching blacks and whites as equals, as evident by his opening Baldwin Institute without regard to race or gender. His parents taught him to fear God, and he consequently devoted himself to living humbly and righteously, to being kind to the poor, and to joining the Methodist Church.|$|E
25|$|Several {{experimental}} findings seem <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>counter</b> <b>to</b> two-factor theory. For example, avoidance behavior often extinguishes {{very slowly}} {{even when the}} initial CS-US pairing never occurs again, so the fear response {{might be expected to}} extinguish (see Classical conditioning). Further, animals that have learned to avoid often show little evidence of fear, suggesting that escape from fear is not necessary to maintain avoidance behavior.|$|E
25|$|People may {{be placed}} on a low fibre diet. It was {{previously}} thought that a low-fibre diet gives the colon adequate time to heal. Evidence tends <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>counter</b> <b>to</b> this with a 2011 review finding no evidence for the superiority of low fibre diets in treating diverticular disease and that a high-fibre diet may prevent diverticular disease. A systematic review published in 2012 found no high quality studies, but found that some studies and guidelines favour a high-fibre diet {{for the treatment of}} symptomatic disease. While {{it has been suggested that}} probiotics may be useful for treatment, the evidence currently neither supports nor refutes this claim.|$|E
50|$|Derrida's {{approach}} {{consists in}} conducting readings of texts with an ear <b>to</b> what <b>runs</b> <b>counter</b> <b>to</b> the structural unity or intended {{sense of a}} particular text. The purpose is to expose that the object of language and that which any text is founded upon is irreducibly complex, unstable, or impossible. Throughout his readings, Derrida hoped to show deconstruction at work, i.e., the ways that this originary complexity—which by definition cannot ever be completely known—works its structuring and destructuring effects.|$|R
5000|$|The Allmusic site {{awarded the}} album 3 stars stating [...] "in a sense it's run-of-the-mill {{as far as}} Prestige late-'60s soul-jazz goes: quite fine grooves, a {{dependable}} yet somewhat predictable house sound, and a reliance upon cover versions {{for much of the}} material (two-thirds of the songs, in this case). It's solidly executed, though, in a lean fashion that, <b>to</b> its credit, <b>runs</b> <b>counter</b> <b>to</b> the more excessive arrangements that were creeping into soul-jazz around this time".|$|R
50|$|This term {{indicates}} the specific strip or storyline {{in which a}} cartoonist uses a plot tactic or stunt that seems <b>to</b> <b>run</b> completely <b>counter</b> <b>to</b> the long-standing vision for the comic (in the case of Cathy, the strip {{for most of its}} existence had centered on the title character's struggles as a single, early-middle-age, slightly overweight woman). As such, fans and long-time readers may notice a decline in quality for subsequent comics, though this is not always true. Quality may remain adequate (or on-par with prior work) but the overall vision for the comic may be too drastically altered for it to retain its original attraction. It is the print comic and webcomic version of jumping the shark.|$|R
500|$|However, Yong C.J. did not {{articulate}} any alternative {{test for}} determining if a restriction upon {{freedom of religion}} is appropriate. Quoting Malaysian Chief Justice Hashim Yeop Sani's judgment in the case Minister for Home Affairs, Malaysia v. Jamaluddin bin Othman (1989), he agreed that [...] "he freedom to profess and practise one's religion should not {{be turned into a}} licence to commit unlawful acts or acts tending to prejudice or threaten the security of the country". Yong C.J. considered that since [...] "the sovereignty, integrity and unity of Singapore are undoubtedly the paramount mandate of the Constitution", religious beliefs and practices which tended <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>counter</b> <b>to</b> these objectives had to be restrained.|$|E
500|$|As well, anarchist activists {{focussed}} much {{of their}} energy towards preparing society for social revolution through education. Anarchists ran schools for children <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>counter</b> <b>to</b> the Catholic schools and public schools, believing that religious schools were anathema to their ideas of freedom, and that public schools were too often used to instill ideas of [...] "patriotic nationalism" [...] and discourage free thought in children. In issues of ¡Tierra!, a weekly anarchist newspaper (published from 1899 through 1915, putting out more than 600 issues), writers denounced the public school requirement to pay allegiance to the Cuban flag, and encouraged teaching children that the flag {{was a symbol of}} [...] "closed mindedness and divisiveness." [...] Anarchists claimed that students enrolled in such schooling would become [...] "cannon fodder" [...] for a conflict of Liberal and Conservative Party leaders in 1906, which caused the US to intervene and occupy Cuba through 1909. Though anarchists had been running schools since that of the Círculo de Trabajadores, it wasn't until 1906 that the schools began to take on a less traditional flavor. In 1908, anarchists included a manifesto in issues of ¡Tierra! and La Voz del Dependiente, calling for the establishment of schools modeled after Francesc Ferrer's Escuela Moderna (Modern School).|$|E
2500|$|Copland's work in {{the late}} 1940s and 1950s {{included}} use of Schönberg's twelve-tone system, a development that he had recognized but not fully embraced. He had also believed the atonality of serialized music <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>counter</b> <b>to</b> his desire to reach a wide audience. Copland therefore approached dodecaphony with some initial skepticism. [...] While in Europe in 1949, he heard a number of serial works but did not admire much of it because [...] "so often it seemed that individuality was sacrificed to the method." [...] The music of French composer Pierre Boulez showed Copland that the technique could {{be separated from the}} [...] "old Wagnerian" [...] aesthetic with which he had associated it previously. Subsequent exposure to the late music of Austrian composer Anton Webern and twelve-tone pieces by Swiss composer Frank Martin and Italian composer Luigi Dallapiccola strengthened this opinion.|$|E

40|$|Scheduled {{to become}} {{operational}} in April 2006 {{and with its}} senior staff already appointed (July 2005), the new Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) —a key element of the current police reform programme—is {{a significant departure from}} the traditional policing infrastructure in the United Kingdom. As such, its creation begs a number of questions about priority setting and accountability. Government assertions {{that it is not a}} police force seem <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>counter</b> both <b>to</b> its function and some aspects of its legislative design and, as such, hint at a paradigm shift. Divining Government intention from official sources and locating this innovation within the context of current theoretical models, this paper documents one of the most significant changes in British policing, identifies the potential for confused perceptions about SOCA and highlights the possible implications of its establishment...|$|R
2500|$|Critics {{note that}} Gurdjieff gives no value {{to most of}} the {{elements}} that compose the life of an average person. According to Gurdjieff, everything an average person possesses, accomplishes, does, and feels is completely accidental and without any initiative. A common everyday ordinary person is born a machine and dies a machine without any chance of being anything else. This belief seems <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>counter</b> <b>to</b> the Judeo-Christian tradition that man is a living soul. Gurdjieff believed that the possession of a soul (a state of psychological unity which he equated with being [...] "awake") was a [...] "luxury" [...] that a disciple could attain only by the most painstaking work of {{over a long period of}} time.

This <b>ran</b> <b>counter</b> <b>to</b> the aims of much of the studio pottery movement at the time, as epitomised by the work of Bernard Leach.

And a fourth would come in with a fear, saying, 'I doubt he will not receive us.'[117] The old gentleman too, the Recorder, that was so before Diabolus took Mansoul, he also began to talk aloud; and his words were now to the town of Mansoul as if they were great claps of thunder. No noise now so terrible to Mansoul as was his, with the noise of the soldiers, and shoutings of the captains.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the most}} {{destructive}} groups {{of people have been}} communist regimes, which have destroyed library books that do not serve the current power structure. In Soviet Russia, as Joseph Stalin [...] "purged" [...] individuals, all of their writing and research was also destroyed. During the Invasion of Tibet, Chinese communists forced Tibetans to destroy their own books or manuscripts by burning, shredding, mixing with manure or by walking on them. Other totalitarian governments have destroyed various library books because these governments see [...] "reading and research as political acts" [...] which can lead individuals <b>to</b> thoughts that <b>run</b> <b>counter</b> <b>to</b> the government.|$|R
40|$|It is not {{uncommon}} for convicted killers to receive letters and visits from women hoping to win their affection. This behavior is puzzling, as evolutionary theory would posit that attraction <b>to</b> murderers <b>runs</b> <b>counter</b> <b>to</b> people's survival instincts. To date, however, no research has been conducted to investigate this phenomenon. The goals of the present studies were to determine whether characteristics of killers that women have evolved to find attractive (i. e., fame and dominance) make them appealing to women, and whether women with certain personality characteristics are more likely to find a killer attractive. Results showed that fame was a characteristic that appealed to women, but that dominance was not. Also, women higher in sensation seeking and attachment avoidance with their fathers were more likely to find the killer attractive. Women higher in attachment anxiety with their fathers were less likely to find the killer attractive. Self-esteem, attachment avoidance with romantic partner, and attachment anxiety with romantic partner were not related to attraction...|$|R

40|$|Conclusions about {{strategic}} {{behavior in}} political science often depend on implicit assumptions about counterfactual reasoning. These assumptions are nested within widely used game-theoretic equilibrium concepts, such as Nash or Perfect Bayesian, and are seldom discussed. However, empirical research casts doubt on the validity of these assumptions in important cases. For example, the finding that many voters dedicate limited cognitive energy <b>to</b> politics <b>runs</b> <b>counter</b> <b>to</b> the common (but implicit) assumption that players base their actions on extensive counterfactual assessments. Similarly, evidence that some political actors (e. g., Democrats and Republicans) think about cause-and-effect in politics quite differently runs against the common assumption that actors share not only common prior beliefs, but also common counterfactual assessments. The extent to which extant conclusions are robust to more realistic assumptions about players’ counterfactual reasoning is unclear. Models based on the self-confirming equilibrium concept (SCE) can clarify such matters. SCE preserves many of the attractive analytic features of more common concepts, while allowing for {{a broader range of}} counterfactual reasoning styles. Two examples reveal opportunities and challenges inherent applying in the approach. In general, the concept provides an improved foundation for more serious interactions between formal theory and political psychology...|$|R

Indeed, this principle is embodied in most intrapreneurial practices, too. As Schon observed: “the new idea either finds a champion or it dies” (Schon 1963, p. 84). The internal business development processes of most established companies provide the originators of new product and business ideas with the resources and autonomy to actualize their visions.|$|R
