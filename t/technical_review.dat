40|$|This paper {{presents}} initial {{findings from}} an ongoing research project studying {{the social and}} organizational practices of <b>technical</b> <b>reviews</b> at NASA. <b>Technical</b> <b>reviews</b> are a ubiquitous part of organizational life in most technical organizations, {{and one of the}} most consequential in terms of risk and innovation management. At NASA, a series of formal <b>technical</b> <b>reviews</b> are conducted across the mission lifecycle, including preliminary and critical design reviews in conceptual design as well as launch and flight readiness reviews in mission operations. Additionally, less formal engineering peer reviews are often conducted as pre-cursors to formal reviews. While recent reports at NASA–most prominent the Columbia investigation report–criticize the inadequate practice of <b>technical</b> <b>reviews,</b> little is known about the specific behavioral impacts of review processes. The objective of this research project is to systematically collect much needed empirical data to model the functional and dysfunctional effects of formal and informal <b>technical</b> <b>reviews</b> on work practices, managerial decision making, and organizational culture. We introduce a novel conceptual framework distinguishing formal, documentary reviews and informal, discursive reviews as two substantially different sets of practices. We show how each of these practices inhibit or facilitate effective knowledge sharing between project engineers and external experts. The paper also presents some initial empirical findings supporting this framework. 1 1477...|$|R

After the accident 49 recovered bolts were investigated, of which 41 had fatigue cracks. On 8bolts, the fatigue damaged area exceeded 90% of the total cross-sectional area.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{proposes a}} {{framework}} for implementing systems engineering measures at <b>technical</b> <b>reviews</b> and audits that expand upon the International Council on Systems Engineering (INCOSE) set of systems engineering leading indicators. Premature transition through key decision gates is {{likely to lead to}} cost and schedule overruns. Risks to a program can be monitored by measuring key systems engineering measures in the development of products. Decision makers need to assess uncertainty in a program's ability to meet cost, schedule and technical performance requirements at key milestones throughout the systems engineering life cycle. The paper seeks to improve and expand on the existing INCOSE systems engineering leading indicators that are significant predictors of program performance. Correlation between a set of leading indicators and <b>technical</b> <b>reviews</b> to support successful program performance is evaluated. Further research is planned to improve systems engineering by providing examples of performance measurement benchmarks that could aid <b>technical</b> <b>reviews</b> and decision gate analysis...|$|R

2500|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century, Marconi began {{investigating}} the means to signal completely across the Atlantic in order to compete with the transatlantic telegraph cables. Marconi established a wireless transmitting station at Marconi House, Rosslare Strand, Co. Wexford in 1901 to act as a link between Poldhu in Cornwall, England and Clifden in Co. Galway, Ireland. He soon made the announcement that the message was received at Signal Hill in St John's, Newfoundland (now part of Canada) on 12 December 1901, using a [...] kite-supported antenna for reception—signals transmitted by the company's new high-power station at Poldhu, Cornwall. The distance between the two points was about [...] It was heralded as a great scientific advance, yet there also was—and continues to be—considerable scepticism about this claim. The exact wavelength used is not known, but it is fairly reliably determined to have been in the neighbourhood of 350 meters (frequency ≈850kHz). The tests took place at a time of day during which the entire transatlantic path was in daylight. We now know (although Marconi did not know then) that this was the worst possible choice. At this medium wavelength, long distance transmission in the daytime is not possible because of heavy absorption of the skywave in the ionosphere. It was not a blind test; Marconi knew in advance to listen for a repetitive signal of three clicks, signifying the Morse code letter S. The clicks were reported to have been heard faintly and sporadically. There was no independent confirmation of the reported reception, and the transmissions were difficult to distinguish from atmospheric noise. (A detailed <b>technical</b> <b>review</b> of Marconi's early transatlantic work appears in John S. Belrose's work of 1995.) The Poldhu transmitter was a two-stage circuit.|$|E
