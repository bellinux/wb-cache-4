50|$|There {{were several}} {{significant}} uprisings against plans {{to develop a}} Prussian <b>Tariff</b> <b>Union</b> because they threatened to undermine Frankfurt's role as a centre of transport and trade.

After the founding of Germany's Customs Union in 1834 of which Nassau also became a member, Frankfurt was the only city that was not part of Prussian Customs Union, in contrast to the surrounding area. Within a short period of time, trade in Frankfurt had been dramatically reduced. Meanwhile, the trade of neighbouring cities, like Offenbach, Höchst and Bockenheim, flourished. In 1836 the free city of Frankfurt was the last one to join the German Customs Union.|$|E

Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin had argued that unions too often pursued improvements in wages and working conditions rather than advocating revolution. Intellectuals, it was argued, had to take over labor unions to prevent such bourgeois inclinations. Perlman criticized this theory by arguing that workers in the United States were not, in fact, alienated {{as they were in}} Europe. Rather, in the U.S., the source of owner-worker conflict was not capitalism per se but the downward pressure on wages exerted by a marketplace free from internal <b>tariffs.</b> <b>Unions</b> formed, Perlman argued, as a means for workers to maintain high wages. It was correct, not an aberration, for unions to focus solely on wages and working conditions, he wrote. In response, Perlman developed the [...] "business unionism" [...] model of labor, where the goals of unions are defined by their members. It was an ingenious and effective critique, and one which had a large impact on the American labor movement.|$|R

40|$|Austria {{is faced}} by the {{decision}} {{whether or not to}} join the European Union (EU) as a full member as of 1995. If a majority of the Austrian population votes "no" at the referendum on June 12, 1994, Austria will remain a member of the European Economic Area (EEA). An evaluation of the most important economic aspects of these two scenarios are the subject of this WIFO investigation. In the short run, EU membership means joining a <b>tariff</b> <b>union,</b> an elimination of both border controls and of the concomitant discrimination for a number of sectors, as well as the inclusion of agriculture and food processing into the integration process. These measures form the final step of Austria's integration into the Western European Single Market. Previous important steps leading towards this goal include tariff reductions through EFTA and free trade agreements with the EC, autonomous steps mainly with respect to monetary policy and membership in the EEA. The expected short-term effects of economic integration are of only secondary importance relative to long-run expectations, and especially to the political importance of membership. Membership in the EU allows Austria to participate in the completion of the European economic and monetary union and in the common foreign and security policy. EU membership will make Austria a partner in the decision-making processes of essential framework conditions which will influence Austria in any case, even if we do not join. Membership means that possible future discrimination of non-members can be avoided and that the Austrian economy will not be decoupled from Western Europe. These factors are especially important during periods of unfavorable economic developments in the European and world economies. State-of-the-art econometric modeling permits one to estimate the short and medium-term effects of the present integration and adjustment steps with sufficient accuracy. Longer-term dynamic effects are impossible to measure quantitatively, but qualitative statements about their direction and their effect on the economy are within the reach of economic research. The same holds for the consequences of Austria's integration into the political decision-making processes of the EU. Both model runs simulating the quantifiable effects of membership and the qualitative evaluation of membership vis-à-vis the EEA scenario speak unequivocally in favor of membership. Membership in the EU will in the short run impose additional burdens on the Austrian economy, consisting of temporary expenditure increases for the public households and in changes in the structure of production, which will in turn necessitate adjustment costs for employment and capital. On the other hand, with membership Austria will become a more attractive location for investment from inside as well as abroad. The short- and medium term costs of adjustment will be more than compensated by the longer-term benefits of membership. In this sense they can be regarded as an investment into the economic future of Austria. The careful evaluation of the effects of membership relative to maintaining the status quo and of foreseeable opportunities and risks in the long run in this WIFO investigation lead to the conclusion that EU membership will benefit {{the economy as a whole}} as well as the wide majority of economic sectors, professions and social classes. From an economic point of view membership in the EU is to be recommended. Zum vorliegenden Bericht; Editorial...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the appropriate sequencing between accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) and {{the implementation of}} the Eurasian Economic Community (EAEC) customs union and whether the latter facilitates or delays WTO accession for some member countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). If EAEC members pursue a coordinated approach toward WTO accession, this may cause delays that benefit some countries at the expense of others. The paper simulates the welfare effects resulting from the two sequencing alternatives (customs union and WTO or the reverse). The results show that, from a consumer surplus standpoint, it would be preferable to join the WTO ahead of the EAEC customs union.

40|$|Lerøy Seafood Group ASA (LSG) {{is based}} in Bergen {{and is one of}} Norway’s largest {{exporters}} of fish. LSG operates companies worldwide, {{both inside and outside the}} EU. The company has been growing strongly over the last three decades, with revenues up from approximately 100 million NOK (Norwegian kroner) in 1980 to 6057 million NOK in 2008. Sales to the EU area represented 58. 2 percent of total sales in 2008. Salmon is LSG’s most important product and represents approximately 70 percent of the company’s total revenues. Norway is member of the EEA agreement, which brings together the 27 EU members and the EFTA countries (excluding Switzerland) in the “Internal Market. ” However, the EEA Agreement does not cover the EU’s Common Fisheries and Agriculture Policies, which implies that the trade of fish does not move freely. A Norwegian EU membership would imply a full entry into the “Internal Market” and a complete removal of all tariffs. The first part of our analysis examines whether tariffs on Norwegian fish exports are an important trade barrier. The empirical analysis aims at discovering whether the products that received a tariff concession in 1993 have increased their EU share of total Norwegian fish exports. Our findings illustrate no significant correlation. There are clear limitations to our study, but this finding indicates that EU membership is likely to have a minor effect with respect to a removal of tariffs. Other research both supports and opposes our findings, a fact that undeniably illustrates the complexity of this issue. In our discussion, we find that a change in FTA agreements due to a Norwegian EU membership seems to be of limited importance. Antidumping countermeasures and minimal prices forced by the EU have primarily harmed EU consumers. The industry might have gained an economic rent because of a price markup, but on the other hand, the industry could also have experienced increased economic risk and prevented a full utilization of its competitiveness. Interviews with shareholders indicate few trade limitations, but do indicate unnecessary transaction costs due to minimal prices. Furthermore, the compensation quotas Norway received when former EFTA countries joined EU will to very little extent reduce the potential gains from tariff removals. EU membership will result in reduced protectionism of the agricultural industry and thus cheaper food in Norway. This implies that in the home 3 market, LSG could face increased competition from cheaper agricultural products, but one the other hand, LSG could benefit from an increase in consumers’ real purchasing power. If EU membership will change the export structure for Norwegian fish exporters, an important question is whether LSG will be able to defend or increase its export share. Market dynamics suggest more benefits than drawbacks for a large and experienced fish company like LSG. Marketing activities provide little information on how LSG will be affected by EU membership, but product differentiation may increase. Poland entered the EU in 2004 and went from being a third country with a bilateral trade agreement with the EFTA to being a part of the EU <b>tariff</b> <b>union.</b> Poland hence became a strategic place to process fish, and it is currently the most important processing country for Norwegian salmon. Ever since Poland’s accession, there has been a steady increase in Norwegian fish exports in terms of both quantity and value. Our thesis does not indicate clear benefits of a Norwegian EU membership for LSG. The explanation behind this conclusion is that trade barriers are currently limited, Norway is dominant player in the EU salmon market, and through the EEA agreement, Norwegian fish exporters are already benefitting from free movements on inputs without membership. Turning to the opposite question, whether EU membership will be an overall drawback for LSG, we find few negative aspects...|$|E

It focuses on the structure of EU imports from preferred and non-preferred suppliers in the transitional period, and it evaluates the tariff equivalent that should be applied in 2006 on EU imports from non-preferred suppliers. The most vulnerable African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries, mainly the Caribbean states, would suffer from the new regulation unless they were to receive direct aid to make their banana production more competitive. banana, European <b>Union,</b> <b>tariff,</b> tariff-rate quota, World Trade Organization, International Relations/Trade,...|$|R
40|$|The European <b>Union</b> <b>tariff</b> {{schedule}} {{includes a}} large number of specific and composite tariffs as well as many tariff-rate quotas (TRQs), which affect the composition of imports. By altering price ratios between products with different unit values, both can generate the typical Alchian-Allen ’shipping the good apples out’ effect in foreign countries’ exports to the EU. Different patterns of trade liberalization, either through tariff reduction or an expansion in preferential-access quotas, might have different consequences for producers and consumers because of changes in the composition of trade. We illustrate the issues at stake in the beef sector, focusing on Mercosur exports to the EU. We model import demand for different qualities {{in the presence of a}} TRQ and we derive comparative statics results for changes in various policy variables.

5000|$|As of 2010, most customs unions rarely {{operate as}} a single entity and are {{represented}} in relations with other customs territories either jointly by their member states governments and the union institutions or by only the member states. Thus, in practice, they rarely appear as a single customs territory and instead they {{operate as a}} multiple separate customs territories that have the same or similar customs <b>tariff.</b> The European <b>Union</b> (EU) is the only trade bloc in which the union institutions have exclusive competence over the common external tariff and thus sign and ratify agreements with foreign states without direct participation of the EU member states. [...] The EU is also the only trade bloc member of the World Trade Organization, but the EU member states are continuing their own separate memberships, as {{not all of the}} WTO issues fall within the scope of exclusive EU competences.|$|R
40|$|GJ exports {{account for}} {{a major part of}} Florida as well as U. S. GJ sales, {{accounting}} for 41. 5 % and 36. 9 % of total Florida GJ sales in 2008 - 09 and 2009 - 10. The largest export market in many of the recent years has been the EU. The EU imposes a 12 % ad valorem tariff on GJ imports, resulting in a higher price for GJ there and a lower volume demanded than would be expected otherwise. Based on the analysis of this study, it is estimated that removal of the EU tariff would result in increased sales of GJ in the EU, benefitting consumers in Europe, and a higher price for Florida growers. The Florida grower price and annual revenue were estimated to increase by $. 06 per SSE gallon and $ 3. 6 million, respectively, if the EU tariff were removed.

5000|$|Mandelson, then EU Trade Commissioner, had {{presided over}} a {{reduction}} in European <b>Union</b> <b>tariffs</b> on aluminium, which benefitted Deripaska and led many to suggest there was {{a conflict of interest}} and even that Mandelson had intervened in EU policy on behalf of the aluminium tycoon. Mandelson denied this. In response to the allegations, David O'Sullivan, the European Commission's Director-General for Trade, wrote a letter to The Sunday Times in which he stated:I am very surprised by the allegations in the British press about Peter Mandelson, Oleg Deripaska and aluminium. The claims hint at Mandelson's personal intervention, in his capacity of European commissioner for trade, in favour of the Russian aluminium company Rusal. I would like to clarify that no such intervention took place. One allegation relates to a nine-year debate in the EU over tariffs on raw aluminium. The other relates to anti-dumping duties on Russian aluminium. In both instances, decisions were made after the usual consultation procedures.While Deripaska has been observer of world events and policy, he has previously stated that he has no desire to be involved in politics: [...] "I have a strong stay away from politics as a matter of business ethics", he said.|$|R
