Graham, on the film [...] On {{his role in the}} episode, Lauter has stated [...] "I don’t really have a lot <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> except I thought I did a nice job, and that it was nice working up there in Vancouver with David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson".|$|E
2500|$|Of {{his work}} as a playwright, DeLillo has said that he feels his plays are not {{influenced}} by the same writers as his novels: [...] "I'm not sure who influenced me [...] I've seen some reviews that mention Beckett and Pinter, but I don't know what <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> I don't feel it myself." ...|$|E

5000|$|Simon used <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> himself <b>that</b> he {{was born}} in 1895 and, [...] "as misfortune never comes singly, cinema was born the same year".|$|R
2500|$|On March 28, 2011, Love, Erlandson, Patty Schemel and Auf der Maur {{appeared}} at the New York screening of Schemel's documentary [...] at the Museum of Modern Art. The appearance {{was the first time}} in thirteen years that all four members appeared together in public. Schemel had expressed a desire to record with Love, Erlandson and Auf der Maur stating [...] "nothing has been discussed, but I have a feeling." [...] After the screening, the four took part in a Q session where Love stated: [...] "For me, as much as I love playing with Patty – and I would play with her in five seconds again, and everyone onstage – if it's not moving forward, I don't wanna do it. That's just my thing. There's rumblings; there's always bloody rumblings. But if it's not miserable and it's going forward and I'm happy with it… that's all I have <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> question." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the {{incident}} McQueen's stepfather persuaded {{his mother to}} sign a court order stating that McQueen was incorrigible, remanding him to the California Junior Boys Republic in Chino. Here, McQueen began to change and mature. He was not popular with the other boys at first: [...] "Say the boys had a chance once a month to load into a bus and go into town to see a movie. And they lost out because one guy in the bungalow didn't get his work done right. Well, you can pretty well guess they're gonna have something <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> I paid my dues with the other fellows quite a few times. I got my lumps, no doubt about it. The other guys in the bungalow had ways of paying you back for interfering with their well-being." [...] Ultimately McQueen became a role model {{when he was elected}} to the Boys Council, a group who set the rules and regulations governing the boys' lives. He eventually left the Boys Republic at age 16. When he later became famous he regularly returned to talk to the boys and retained a lifelong association.|$|E
2500|$|Around {{the release}} of Music, Madonna told Rolling Stone about how she felt about the song's leak: [...] "There's not much to say, honestly. I think it's blown out of proportion. They {{downloaded}} a portion of 'Music' before I'd even mixed it. It was astonishing. I {{have no idea how}} they got it. It was still in such a beginning stage. And it freaked me out, because I suddenly thought, 'Oh, my God. If they got that, then they have other things on my record that aren't finished.' And that's really scary. So, basically, I made — well, my manager made — a public statement [...] Simple as that. And then suddenly it was in every headline: 'Madonna is against Napster.' I mean ... I don't take that sort of a stance. I feel covetous about my work, and I don't want people to hear it until it's finished. At the same time, I think, to a certain extent, the trading of information is inevitable. And, on the other hand, Napster could be a great way for people to hear your music who wouldn't have the chance to hear it on the radio. So that's what I have <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> Really, I want to strangle the person who got ahold of it. I don't know — I can't control everybody [...] ".|$|E
50|$|However, by 1971/1972 {{the market}} had already shown signs of weakening, and, unfortunately, {{subsequent}} global events {{had a lot}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> whether <b>that</b> rosy forecast would come true.|$|R

6000|$|... "I wouldn't like <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{anything}} <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> Professor," [...] {{he answered}} slowly. [...] "I might be accusing a fellow cadet unfairly. If the suitcase isn't returned by to-morrow I {{may have something}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I haven't {{anything}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> because I {{may have}} missed it a little in their cases, but I WAS too many for the Baldwin's Ranch people, General!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Madame Merle {{dropped her}} eye on him a moment, during which her lips closed with a certain firmness. [...] "Is that all you can find <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> fine creature?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Old Orlick growled, {{as if he}} {{had nothing}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> and we all went on together. I asked him {{presently}} whether he had been spending his half-holiday up and down town? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Stop a moment, Mr. Tappitt; I'm {{not quite}} sure {{that it would be}} much the greatest. I don't want <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{anything}} <b>about</b> <b>that</b> now; only if I were to let your remark pass without notice it would seem that I had assented." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Then all I have <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> is,' {{interposed}} Miss La Creevy, 'that I don't envy {{you your}} taste; and that {{sitting in the}} same room with his very boots, would put me out of humour for a fortnight.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am afraid," [...] he {{answered}} smiling, [...] "that {{there are other}} people who would have something <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> Your stepmother is already anxious. I have promised that you shall be back at the Hall by ten o'clock." ...|$|E

5000|$|Thinking Plague's {{name was}} created by the band's founders, Mike Johnson and Bob Drake.

6000|$|... "But style, but style!" [...] {{they might}} return.

Do you want us to take infinite pains in acquiring a style?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{can tell}} Cheditafa," [...] said the captain, quickly, [...] "that if I {{want him to}} stay he'll stay, and if I {{want him to go}} he'll go. He has nothing <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> So much for him. Now, what do you think?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I ain't {{got nothing}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> {{one way or}} the other. Now I'm off," [...] and with a short nod of his head Jarley Bangs threw in the gears of his machine and rattled away, slowly {{gathering}} speed as he proceeded.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, no, he had {{precious}} little <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> for he must know I knew he and Jasniff were guilty. He wrote about you. It {{was a long}} letter--nearly eight pages--and he spoke about what you had done to get him and me into trouble." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Only a queer-shaped box of wood like {{a little}} house, and two candlesticks, and some rolls of parchment.

You won't say that I told you, will you, Señor?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, sir,' sighed my aunt. 'All I {{have got}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> it is, <b>that</b> if it's gone, I can bear it; and if it's not gone, I shall {{be glad to}} get it back.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Talking to me, {{why should}} you {{hesitate}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> anything <b>about</b> yourself <b>that</b> is true? I can hold my tongue. I do not gossip about my friends. Whose doing is it?" ...|$|R
60|$|Now, I {{have nothing}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> this morning. It may be so; or, again, it may not; I read {{a good many}} things in books every week the sense of which I cannot understand. At all events {{it is not the}} {{salvation}} of which Isaiah speaks here.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah, well! I {{might have}} had a word or two <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> but the time has gone by for it, worse luck. Perhaps it is best that I have said nothing, and she has had her way. No, I shan't come in, Picotee. Father is gone, and I am going too.' ...|$|E
6000|$|She smiled. [...] "There {{is really}} nothing <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> young person, of whom, by the way, {{you should not}} speak as 'Sylvia.'

6000|$|... "That we {{must leave}} it in their hands at present; {{that they did not}} know exactly what the Rajah might have <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> it, but <b>that</b> he would be there himself in a few weeks, and decide the matter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Keep {{yourself}} quiet, my lad," [...] said Bartle; [...] "keep quiet. It's {{not what}} you're thinking of. It's the young Methodist woman {{come from the}} prison.

6000|$|... 'Like enough, squoire; like enough.
