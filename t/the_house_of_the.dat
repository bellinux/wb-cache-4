5|$|Similar to {{the design}} of the {{majority}} of Delian homes, <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lake is an irregular-shaped home (as opposed to a rectangular or square floor plan), located near a sacred lake and inhabited from roughly 300 to 100 BC. The peristyle impluvium is decorated with a geometric-patterned motif around a central rosette, surrounded on all sides by monolithic columns in the Ionic style.|$|E

5|$|The Moscow militsiya {{sealed off}} {{downtown}} Moscow during the funeral on 15 November. Large avenues were tightly guarded {{by the police}} and the Moscow military garrison. The soldiers, who stood in front of <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Unions, wore black-edged red armbands. <b>The</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Unions was decorated by numerous red flags and other communist symbols. Brezhnev's body lay in state for three days at <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Unions. On the third day the coffin was placed on an artillery carriage towed by an olive-green BRDM-2 armored vehicle of the Red Army—led by dozens of wreaths as well as Brezhnev's decorations carried by Soviet military personnel and other mourners—to the Lenin Mausoleum on the Red Square, where it was greeted by speeches by Andropov; Minister of Defence Dmitriy Ustinov; Anatoly Alexandrov, the President of the Academy of Sciences; and a factory worker. After the speeches, pallbearers, led by Andropov and Nikolai Tikhonov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers, carried the coffin to another location close to the mausoleum. It was here that Brezhnev's family made their farewell. Before the body was laid to rest Viktoria kissed Brezhnev on the face in accordance with Russian traditions. As Brezhnev's body was lowered into the grave a military squad saluted while an orchestra played the Soviet national anthem. According to Time magazine Brezhnev's death was mourned by the majority of Soviets.|$|E

5|$|A further {{testament}} to this devotion included Hasan-Jalal's commissioning of the Gandzasar Monastery. Construction {{of the monastery}} began in 1216 and lasted until 1238. On July 22, 1240, amid great celebration during Vardavar celebrations and {{in the presence of}} nearly 700 priests including Nerses, the Catholicos of Albania, the church was consecrated. The monastery {{went on to become the}} residence and sepulcher of the family as well as <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> catholicos; beginning in the 15th century, the family also monopolized control over the seat of Catholicos itself, which would from thereon in pass down from uncle to nephew. Hasan-Jalal's son John VII is considered to be the first to have established this practice when he became the Catholicos whereas his nephew, also named John, became the second.|$|E
5|$|At about 11pm, the rioters {{arrived at}} <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Reverend John Vachell, who, after {{threatening}} to shoot anyone who entered his house, was disarmed when threemen rushed him. He fled on foot {{with his wife}} and two daughters towards Ely. After Vachell had left, the rioters destroyed his goods and chattels and stole some of his silverware. Vachell was later to sue the Hundred of Ely for the damages under the Riot Act. He received over £708 (£), an award which was challenged in the press, as many people complained about the size of the resulting district levies used to pay for it. The rioters then stopped a post-chaise returning with Hugh Robert Evans senior and Henry Martin from a Turnpike Trust meeting in Downham. They robbed Evans of 14shillings (£) before allowing them both to proceed. On reaching Ely, Evans alerted the magistrates who sent a carriage for Reverend Vachell, which collected him and his family walking towards Ely.|$|E

5|$|Brezhnev's body {{reportedly}} sustained two falls. As {{the coffin}} was lifted into {{place for the}} lying in state at the Column Hall of <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Unions, Brezhnev's body fell through the bottom. After that, a new, metal-plated coffin was made, and as it was lowered into the grave, the funeral servants could not handle its weight and the coffin fell with a loud crash into the grave hole. This account, however, was contested by Georgy Kovalenko, one of the funeral servants—according to him, twenty minutes before the deposition of the coffin he {{was asked by the}} Kremlin custodian Semyon Shornikov to lower the coffin simultaneously with the chime of bells.|$|E
5|$|Dostoyevsky's renewed {{financial}} troubles {{led him to}} join several political circles. Because of {{his participation}} in the Petrashevsky Circle, in which he distributed and read several Belinsky articles deemed as anti-religious and anti-government, he and other members were sentenced to capital punishment. He was pardoned at the last minute, but they were imprisoned in SiberiaDostoyevsky for four years. During his detention he wrote several works, including the autobiographical <b>The</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dead. A New Testament booklet, which had been given shortly before his imprisonment, and other literature obtained outside of the barracks, were the only books he read at that time.|$|E
5|$|He {{accepted}} selected opera productions, such as: {{the first}} {{performance of the}} three-act version of Alban Berg's Lulu, completed by Friedrich Cerha, at the Paris Opera in 1979; Berg's Wozzeck at the Staatsoper Berlin in 1994; Wagner's Tristan und Isolde at La Scala in 2007; Janáček's From <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dead, shown at several festivals and the Metropolitan Opera; and, as his last staging, Elektra by Richard Strauss, first performed at the Aix-en-Provence Festival in July 2013.

5|$|In 1991, Ryder {{played a}} young taxicab driver in Jim Jarmusch's Night on Earth. The film {{was given a}} limited release, but {{received}} critical praise. Ryder then starred in the dual roles of Count Dracula's reincarnated love interest Mina Murray and Dracula's past lover Princess Elisabeta, in Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992), a project she brought to director Francis Ford Coppola's attention. In 1993, she starred in the melodrama <b>The</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Spirits, based on Isabel Allende's novel. Ryder played the love interest of Antonio Banderas' character. Principal filming was done in Denmark and Portugal. The film was poorly reviewed and a box office flop, grossing just $6million on its $40million budget.|$|E
5|$|Like <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lake, most {{houses in}} the crowded Theatre Quarter of Delos have irregular-shaped floor plans (such as {{trapezoidal}} designs), as opposed to square or rectangular designs. The narrow and irregular street grid is unlike that of other quarters, where streets usually meet at approximately right angles. Similar {{to the majority of}} excavated homes of Delos, those in the Theatre Quarter feature an open courtyard without porticoes, instead of the peristyle layout with columns. Some of the {{houses in the}} Theatre Quarter lack interior decoration altogether, with neither wall murals nor mosaics, which is unusual for most Delian homes.|$|E
5|$|Meetings usually {{began at}} dawn, {{although}} occasionally certain events (such as festivals) might delay {{the beginning of}} a meeting. A magistrate who wished to summon the Senate had to issue a compulsory order (a cogere), and senators could be punished if they failed to appear without reasonable cause. In 44 BC for example, consul Mark Antony threatened to demolish <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former consul Cicero for this very reason. The Senate meetings were technically public because the doors were usually left open, which allowed people to look in, but only senators could speak. The Senate was directed by a presiding magistrate, who was usually either a consul (the highest-ranking magistrate) or, if the consul was unavailable, a Praetor (the second-highest ranking magistrate). By the late Republic, another type of magistrate, a plebeian tribune, would sometimes preside.|$|E
