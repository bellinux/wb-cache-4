5|$|On 26 February 1793, another vote {{to abolish}} the slave trade was {{narrowly}} defeated by eight votes. The outbreak of war with France the same month effectively prevented any further serious consideration of <b>the</b> <b>issue,</b> <b>as</b> politicians concentrated on the national crisis {{and the threat of}} invasion. The same year, and again in 1794, Wilberforce unsuccessfully brought before Parliament a bill to outlaw British ships from supplying slaves to foreign colonies. He voiced his concern about the war and urged Pitt and his government to make greater efforts to end hostilities. Growing more alarmed, on 31 December 1794, Wilberforce moved that the government seek a peaceful resolution with France, a stance that created a temporary breach in his long friendship with Pitt.|$|E
5|$|Once the {{election}} date was set as September 10, national organizations {{on both sides}} of the gun-control debate started to weigh in. On the recall, pro-gun rights side was the National Rifle Association and Americans for Prosperity, while on the gun control side was the Mayors Against Illegal Guns and Mayor Bloomberg. Morse went door-to-door in an effort to gain voter support and both sides of the campaigns accused the other side of mud-slinging. Morse supporters were upset about an ad alleging ethical misconduct by Morse, noting that he had been cleared of those allegations.

5|$|A public {{announcement}} of the new pieces was made on May 15, 1965, only to be met with a storm of objections. Both the public and many congressmen saw <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>as</b> a poor use of Mint resources {{at a time of}} severe coin shortages, which would only benefit coin dealers. On May 24, one day before a hastily called congressional hearing, Adams announced that the pieces were deemed trial strikes, never intended for circulation. The Mint later stated that 316,076 pieces had been struck; all were reported melted amid heavy security. To ensure {{that there would be no}} repetition, Congress inserted a provision in the Coinage Act of 1965 forbidding the coinage of silver dollars for five years. That act also removed silver from the dime and quarter, and reduced the silver content of the half dollar to 40%.|$|E
5|$|Clay {{believed}} the Democrats would again nominate Martin Van Buren, who was ardently opposed to annexation, {{and this would}} keep annexation from becoming {{an issue in the}} campaign. Clay was nominated by acclamation at the Whig convention in Baltimore a week later. At the Democratic nominating convention a month later, however, Van Buren was unable to secure his party's nomination, and the Democrats instead nominated James K. Polk, who strongly favored annexation. Clay tried to moderate his views on annexation, but his changes of position drew opposition from supporters of both sides of <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>as</b> he attempted to find a middle ground. Polk {{went on to win the}} election in a close race. This was the last time Clay would be nominated for president, and many Whigs believed that, following Clay's defeat, Crittenden was the new leader of their party.|$|E
5|$|Henry's precise {{motivations and}} {{intentions}} {{over the coming}} years are not widely agreed on. Henry himself, {{at least in the}} early part of his reign, was a devout and well-informed Catholic to the extent that his 1521 publication Assertio Septem Sacramentorum ("Defence of the Seven Sacraments") earned him the title of Fidei Defensor (Defender of the Faith) from Pope Leo X. The work represented a staunch defence of papal supremacy, albeit one couched in somewhat contingent terms. It is not clear exactly when Henry changed his mind on <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>as</b> he grew more intent on a second marriage. Certainly, by 1527 he had convinced himself that in marrying Catherine, his brother's wife, he had acted contrary to Leviticus 20:21, an impediment Henry now believed that the Pope never had the authority to dispense with. It was this argument Henry took to Pope Clement VII in 1527 in the hope of having his marriage to Catherine annulled, forgoing at least one less openly defiant line of attack. In going public, all hope of tempting Catherine to retire to a nunnery or otherwise stay quiet were lost. Henry sent his secretary, William Knight, to appeal directly to the Holy See by way of a deceptively worded draft papal bull. Knight was unsuccessful; the Pope could not be misled so easily.|$|E

5|$|In his absence, {{the issue}} of female genital {{mutilation}} (FGM) had become a topic of strong debate in Kikuyu society. The Protestant churches, backed by European medics and the colonial authorities, supported the abolition of this traditional practice, but the KCA rallied to its defence, claiming that its abolition would {{be a threat to}} the structure and customs of Kikuyu society. Anger between the two sides had heightened, with several churches expelling KCA members from their congregations, and it was widely believed that the January 1930 killing of the American nun, Hulda Stumpf, had been due to <b>the</b> <b>issue.</b> <b>As</b> Secretary of the KCA, Kenyatta soon attended a meeting with church representatives. There, he expressed the view that although he personally opposed FGM, he regarded its legal abolition as counter-productive, and that the churches should focus on eradicating the practice through education of its harmful effects on women's health. The meeting ended without compromise, and John Arthurâ€”the head of the Church of Scotland in Kenyaâ€”later complained about what he described as Kenyatta's dishonesty during the debate, expelling him from the church. In 1931, Kenyatta took his son out of the church school at Thogota and enrolled him in a KCA-approved, independent school.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1880s, Wallace was {{drawn into the}} debate over {{mandatory}} smallpox vaccination. Wallace originally saw <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>as</b> {{a matter of personal}} liberty; but, after studying some of the statistics provided by anti-vaccination activists, he began to question the efficacy of vaccination. At the time, the germ theory of disease was very new and far from universally accepted. Moreover, no one knew enough about the human immune system to understand why vaccination worked. When Wallace did some research, he discovered instances where supporters of vaccination had used questionable, in a few cases completely phony, statistics to support their arguments. Always suspicious of authority, Wallace suspected that physicians had a vested interest in promoting vaccination, and became convinced that reductions in the incidence of smallpox that had been attributed to vaccination were, in fact, due to better hygiene and improvements in public sanitation.|$|E
5|$|Saumarez sent Jahleel Brenton in a gig to Venerable at 08:00, {{just as the}} {{foremast}} also fell overboard, {{with instructions}} that if the combined French and Spanish squadron, visible off Cadiz, should proceed south to attack the grounded British vessel then Hood should remove his crew and set his ship on fire. Thames was brought close alongside in order to evacuate the ship if the need arose, but Hood refused the order and insisted {{that he would be}} able to save his ship. Eventually the arrival of Audacious and Superb on the southern horizon decided <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>as</b> Moreno abandoned any intention to counterattack, instead entering Cadiz harbour with his squadron, followed by Troude in Formidable. Their arrival was greeted with cheers from the city's population, unaware of the disaster in the Gut of Gibraltar.

5|$|The {{implementation}} of a uniform civil code for all citizens has not been achieved owing to widespread opposition from various religious groups and political parties. The Shah Bano case (1985â€“86) provoked a political firestorm in India when the Supreme Court ruled that Shah Bano, a Muslim {{woman who had been}} divorced by her husband in 1978 was entitled to receive alimony from her former husband under Indian law applicable for all Indian women. This decision evoked outrage in the Muslim community, which sought the application of the Muslim personal law and in response the Parliament passed the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986 overturning the Supreme Court's verdict. This act provoked further outrage, as jurists, critics and politicians alleged that the fundamental right of equality for all citizens irrespective of religion or gender was being jettisoned to preserve the interests of distinct religious communities. The verdict and the legislation remain a source of heated debate, with many citing <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>as</b> a prime example of the poor {{implementation of}} Fundamental Rights.|$|E

5|$|The new {{pieces were}} {{publicly}} announced on May 15, 1965, and coin dealers immediately offered $7.50 each for them, ensuring {{that they would}} not circulate.

No 1964-D Peace dollars are known to exist in either public or private hands.

40|$|ABSTRACT The aim of {{this study}} is to analyse if the UN today {{constructs}} <b>the</b> water <b>issue</b> <b>as</b> a security <b>issue</b> and to argue about in which way the organization in that case does so alternatively why it can be said that the UN doesnâ€™t construct <b>the</b> water <b>issue</b> <b>as</b> a security <b>issue.</b> In order to reach this purpose the following questions will be answered: â€¢Does the UN construct <b>the</b> water <b>issue</b> <b>as</b> a security <b>issue</b> today? -If yes, in which way? -If no, why can it be said that the organisation doesnâ€™t? The methods used are qualitative literature studies of policy documents on water from the UN. The focus is to analyze the ideas about water and to apply my theory on the concept of security, which is Barry Buzanâ€™s framework on security, to these ideas. The main results showed that the UN strongly constructs <b>the</b> water <b>issue</b> <b>as</b> an environmental security issue for environments and species and in relatively strong terms also constructs it as an environmental security issue for civilisations. In rare cases the organisation constructs it as a societal security <b>issue,</b> but <b>the</b> UN doesnâ€™t construct <b>the</b> water <b>issue</b> <b>as</b> a military, political or economic security issue...|$|R

5|$|The script {{revealed}} that a frame story indeed {{was part of the}} original Caligari screenplay, albeit a significantly different one than that in the final film. The original manuscript opens on an elegant terrace of a large villa, where Francis and Jane are hosting a party, and the guests insist that Francis tell them a story that happened to him 20 years earlier. The conclusion to the frame story is missing from the script. Critics widely agree that the discovery of the screenplay strongly undermines Kracauer's theory, with some, like German film historian Stephen Brockmann, even arguing it disproves his claims altogether. Others, however, like John D. Barlow, argues it does not completely settle <b>the</b> <b>issue,</b> <b>as</b> the original screenplay's frame story simply serves to introduce the main plot, rather than subvert it as the final film's version does.|$|E
5|$|Weaver {{also took}} {{up the issue of}} white {{settlement}} in Indian Territory. For several years, white settlers had been claiming homesteads in the Unassigned Lands in what is now Oklahoma. After the Civil War, the Five Civilized Tribes had been forced to cede their unused western lands to the federal government. The settlers, known as Boomers, believed that federal ownership made the lands open to settlement under the Homestead Acts. The federal government disagreed, as did the Cherokee Nation, which leased its neighboring Cherokee Outlet to Kansas cattle ranchers, and many Easterners, who believed the Boomers to be the tools of railroad interests. Weaver saw <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>as</b> one between the landless poor homesteaders and wealthy cattlemen, and took the side of the former. He introduced a bill in December 1885 to organize Indian Territory and the neighboring Neutral Strip into a new Oklahoma Territory. The bill died in committee, but Weaver reintroduced it in February 1886 and gave a speech calling for the Indian reservations to be broken up into homesteads for individual Natives and the remaining land to be open to white settlement.|$|E
