40|$|The laminar {{nature of}} {{microfluidic}} flows is most elegantly demonstrated via {{the confluence of}} two fluids forming two stable parallel flows within a single channel meeting at a highly stable interface. However, maintenance of laminar conditions can become complicated {{when there is a}} large viscosity contrast between the neighbouring flows leading to unique instability patterns along their interface. Here, we study the dynamics of high viscosity contrast confluent flows - specifically a core flow made of highly viscous glycerol confined by sheath flows made of water within a microfluidic flow focusing system. Our experiments indicate the formation of <b>tapered</b> <b>core</b> structures along the middle of the channel. Increasing the sheath flow rate shortens the <b>tapered</b> <b>core,</b> and importantly induces local instability patterns along the interface of core-sheath flows. The dynamics of such <b>tapered</b> <b>core</b> structures is governed by the intensity of instability patterns and the length of the core, according to which the core structure can experience stable, disturbed, broken or oscillated regimes. We have studied the dynamics of <b>tapered</b> <b>core</b> structures under these regimes. In particular, we have analysed the amplitude and frequency of core displacements during the broken core and oscillating core regimes, which have not been investigated before...|$|E

30|$|Suspended <b>core</b> fiber <b>tapers</b> with {{different}} cross sections (with diameters from 70 μm to 120 μm) {{are produced by}} filament heating. Before obtaining the taper, the spectral behavior of the suspended core fiber is a multimode interference structure. When the taper is made, an intermodal interference between a few modes is observed. This effect is clearly visible for low <b>taper</b> <b>core</b> dimensions. Since the core and cladding do not collapse, two taper regions exist, one in the core {{and the other in}} the cladding. The cladding taper does not affect the light transmission, only the core is reduced to a microtaper. The spectral response of the microtaper based-suspended core fiber is similar to a beat of two interferometers. The strain is applied to the microtaper, and with the reduction in the transverse area, an increase in sensitivity is observed. When the taper is immersed in a liquid with a different index of refraction or subjected to temperature variations, no spectral change occurs.|$|R
40|$|A {{new device}} for {{improving}} the free-space optical monitoring and coupling into a single mode fiber is proposed.

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{comparison}} behaviour between a tapered silica Multi-Mode Fibre (MMF) and a Plastic Multi-Mode (PMM) fibre is proposed. The tapered silica MMF (<b>tapered</b> <b>core</b> and cladding) and PMM fibre (only core) sensors use a Tunable Laser Source (TLS) at 1550 nm {{and a yellow}} He-Ne laser at 594 nm as the sources for measuring the attenuation of the input signal when the sensor is being soaked into the glucose solution. From this work, the tapered PMM fibre performs better {{in terms of its}} linearity, and provides a reliable calibration graph of glucose concentration against output signal. It has a sensitivity of 0. 0088 mV/% and an error of 2. 6 percent with a resolution of 0. 36 %.

40|$|Multiphase {{microfluidic}} devices offer precise {{control of}} the flows {{in a wide range}} of applications such as chemical reactions, biological samples, mixing and droplet formation by applying different flow rates and channel geometries. However, in the majority of these cases, fluids used in these devices can have similar physical properties such as viscosity, density and surface tension. Interaction of fluids with different physical properties can generate multifaceted fluid patterns in confined systems. In particular, applying fluids with a large viscosity contrast into a microfluidic system can generate quite complex instabilities arising from localised velocity and shear stress gradients. High viscosity contrast interfaces have been investigated within microfluidic flow focusing systems. However, in these works, the ratio of core/sheath flows as well as the diffusion coefficient between the core/sheath flows is such that the width of the core reduces very quickly at the entrance of the flow focusing channel. This motivated the author to change the set the operating conditions of the system to study the stability of the core flow such that the core flow can maintain its width at the entrance of the flow focusing channel. As the first research contribution, the author investigated the dynamics of a highly viscous glycerol core confined between water sheath flows. Experiments indicate that the structure of core flow is determined by the ratio of core/sheath flows. At high flow rate ratios, parallel streams of core and sheath flows move alongside each other throughout the channel. At lower flow rate ratios, a <b>tapered</b> <b>core</b> flow is formed at the upstream of the channel before converting into a thin &lsquo;viscous thread&rsquo;. In this case, the stability of <b>tapered</b> <b>core</b> flow is determined by the magnitude of the sheath flow rate. At low sheath flow rates, the <b>tapered</b> <b>core</b> remains stable. In contrast, at high sheath flow rates, &lsquo;surface waves&rsquo; are induced at the interface of core/sheath flows. Such surface waves can buckle the core or even break it into two parts, which is referred to as &rsquo;core pinch off&rsquo; phenomenon, which has not been reported before. As the second research contribution, the author characterised the dynamics of pinch off phenomenon under various combinations of core and sheath flow rates. In particular, using high speed imaging the author investigated the variations of core length and pinch off frequency. Experiments are conducted under a constant core flow rate but varying sheath flow rates as well as under varying core flow rates but a constant sheath flow rate. As the third research contribution, the author explored the role of viscosity contrast between the core and sheath flows on the stability of the core. This has enabled the author to obtain the flow map of the core, representing the extent of the core not only under various combinations of core and sheath flows but also under two different viscosity contrasts...|$|E
40|$|The Gaussian {{approximation}} that {{is typically}} {{used to estimate}} single-mode fiber microlens performance is investigated. It is applied to hemispheric lenses on two types of tapered single-mode fiber. Theoretical and experimental results are compared. The first type of taper, which is fabricated by pulling a fiber while it is melted, has a <b>tapered</b> <b>core</b> and a tapered cladding. The second type of taper, which is fabricated by etching the cladding, has a tapered cladding only. For a tapered-core fiber, coupling to the cladding-guided modes and the finite radius of curvature of the wave front before the lens must be considered to predict the lens spot size accurately, whereas the spot size of a tapered-cladding lens can be predicted from the lens diameter alone. Thus the spot size of a lens on a tapered-cladding fiber is easier to predict and control {{than that of a}} lens on a tapered-core fiber. It is also shown that the usual theory used to predict the spot size gives accepted values for tapered-cladding lenses but not for tapered-core lenses...|$|E

The spot-size converter consists of a <b>tapered</b> rib <b>core</b> region and a double-cladding region.

We use magneto-hydrodynamic simulations to investigate the relation between protostellar outflow evolution, turbulence and star formation efficiency. We model the collapse and evolution of isolated dense cores for ≳ 0. 5 Myr including the effects of turbulence, radiation transfer, and both radiation and outflow feedback from forming protostars. We show that outflows drive and maintain turbulence in the core environment even with strong initial fields. The star-formation efficiency decreases with increasing field strength, and the final efficiencies are 15 - 40 %. The Stage 0 lifetime, during which the protostellar mass is less than the dense envelope, increases proportionally with the initial magnetic field strength and ranges from ∼ 0. 1 - 0. 4 Myr. The average accretion rate is well-represented by a <b>tapered</b> turbulent <b>core</b> model, which {{is a function of the}} final protostellar mass and is independent of the magnetic field strength.

40|$|There is {{continued}} {{interest in}} nonlinear devices for {{different types of}} optical signal processing, such as Raman or parametric amplifiers. The small nonlinearity of conventional single-mode fibers sets a major limitation for these devices. A large nonlinearity {{can be achieved by}} having a large nonlinear coefficient, a small effective area, or both. Having a small effective area, however, requires efficient coupling to very small core fibers. A novel technique for splicing conventional single-mode fibers to small core fibers is pro-posed and demonstrated. The coupling efficiency obtained by this technique is considerably improved over that obtained by the butt-joint splice. This technique uses a highly tapered splice in which the field leaves the core and propagates as a fundamental cladding mode before it couples back to the core mode of the small core fiber. At the beginning of the <b>taper</b> the fundamental <b>core</b> mode carries most of the power. Over the down-taper region, the core mode couples to the fundamental cladding mode for which the cladding-air interface {{plays a major role in}} guiding the light. Over the up-taper region, the cladding mode is coupled back to the core mode. Fabrication of such a device involves many constraints. Alignment of the cores, the slope of the taper, and the taper length are important issues to ensure tha...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{presentation}} of results from tests in a 5 GeV/c hadron beam of detectors based on liquid-core scintillating fibres, each fibre consisting of a glass capillary filled with organic liquid scintillator. Fibre readout was performed via an Electron-Bombarded Charge-Coupled Device (EBCCD) image tube, a novel instrument that combines the functions of a high-gain, gated image intensifier and a Charge-Coupled Device. Using 1 -methylnaphthalene doped with 3 g/l of R 45 as liquid scintillator, the attenuation lengths obtained for light propagation over distances greater than 16 cm were 1. 5 m in fibres of 20 mu m core and 1. 0 m in fibres of 16 mu m core. For particles that crossed the fibres of 20 mu m core at distances of similar to 1. 8 cm and similar to 95 cm from the fibres' readout ends, the recorded hit densities were 5. 3 mm(- 1) and 2. 5 mm(- 1) respectively. Using 1 -methylnaphthalene doped with 3. 6 g/l of R 39 as liquid scintillator and fibres of 75 mu m core, the hit density obtained for particles that crossed the fibres at a distance of similar to 1. 8 cm from their readout ends was 8. 5 mm(- 1). With a specially designed bundle of <b>tapered</b> fibres, having <b>core</b> diameters that smoothly increase from 16 mu m to 75 mu m, a spatial precision of 6 mu m was measured...|$|R
