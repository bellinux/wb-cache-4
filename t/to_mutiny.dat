5|$|The {{combination}} of the humiliation of Casey, {{the deaths of the}} topmen, and the severe punishment {{of the rest of the}} sailors appears to have driven the crew <b>to</b> <b>mutiny.</b> These factors, however, were arguably the final events in a series of harsh and brutal punishments by the captain. Dudley Pope, in his book The Black Ship, argues that it was not Pigot's cruelty that drove the men <b>to</b> <b>mutiny</b> but the general injustice that he showed in his favouritism to some and overly harsh punishment of others. Had Pigot remained more even-handed in his leadership, the mutiny might have been avoided.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the heavy}} losses Tigranes suffered, {{the battle was}} not decisive in ending the war. In {{retreating}} northwards, Tigranes and Mithridates were able to elude Lucullus' forces, though losing again against the Romans {{during the battle of}} Artashat. In 68, Lucullus' forces' began <b>to</b> <b>mutiny,</b> longing to return home, and he withdrew his forces from Armenia the following year.|$|E
5|$|Black women {{played a}} minor role in units {{such as the}} Rhodesia Native Regiment, {{accompanying}} the black soldiers into the operational area and performing domestic tasks like washing and cooking. Many of these were local East African women who had formed attachments with RNR soldiers. Officers tolerated {{the presence of these}} women in the interest of morale, aware that attempting to take them away from the men would probably lead <b>to</b> <b>mutiny.</b>|$|E
50|$|As {{the end of}} the war approached, Adam {{instituted a}} {{demobilisation}} system based on the 'first in, first out' principle and resisted attempts to repeat the practice in 1918-19 of giving priority to the needs of the economy, which had led <b>to</b> <b>mutinies</b> by long-serving men.|$|R
50|$|By 67, the {{province}} was secure {{enough to allow}} Legio XIV Gemina to be withdrawn, but inactivity, {{and the lack of}} opportunities for booty, led <b>to</b> <b>mutinies</b> among the legions that remained. Not being a military man, Trebellius was unable to restore discipline, and a feud with Marcus Roscius Coelius, commander of XX Valeria Victrix, further undermined his authority.|$|R

5|$|The {{third stage}} of Zeppelin {{involved}} a delay until 21 May, {{on the basis}} that the Soviets had asked for them to be synchronised with their own invasion plans. This ran from 21 April until 9 May, when a major revision to the plans (stage four) was introduced. The Twelfth Army and Polish forces would land in Albania and Croatia, bypassing Greece due <b>to</b> <b>mutiny</b> within Allied Greek forces in Africa, with an invasion set in June. A major invasion of Southern France was also added, codenamed Vendetta.|$|E
5|$|Under this {{sycamore}} tree at Tolpuddle in Dorset, England, six agricultural labourers, {{known as}} the Tolpuddle Martyrs, formed an early trades union in 1834. They {{were found to have}} breached the Incitement <b>to</b> <b>Mutiny</b> Act 1797 and were transported to Australia. The subsequent public outcry led to their release and return. The tree now has a girth of 5.9 metres (19 feet, 4 inches) and a 2005 study dated the tree to 1680. The tree is cared for by the National Trust, who have pollarded the tree in 2002 and 2014.|$|E
5|$|Following the battle, Wayne ordered Scott's {{volunteers to}} conduct {{numerous}} raids within a fifty-mile radius of their position. Due {{to a lack}} of pack horses in Wayne's force, the mounted volunteers were also employed transporting supplies between forts throughout September 1794. They eventually grew weary of garrison duty and complained that the use of their personal horses to transport goods had injured the animals. Many threatened <b>to</b> <b>mutiny</b> if not discharged. On October 13, 1794, Wayne finally ordered them home. In a commendation of Wayne issued on December 4, 1794, the U.S. House of Representatives specifically thanked Scott and his men for their service at the Battle of Fallen Timbers. The Treaty of Greenville formally ended the war in mid-1795.|$|E

5|$|In their Bounty histories, both Hough and Alexander {{maintain}} that the men were not at a stage close <b>to</b> <b>mutiny,</b> however sorry they were to leave Tahiti. The journal of James Morrison, the boatswain's mate, supports this. The events that followed, Hough suggests, were determined in the three weeks following the departure, when Bligh's anger and intolerance reached paranoid proportions. Christian was a particular target, always seeming to {{bear the brunt of}} the captain's rages. Unaware of the effects of his behaviour on his officers and crew, Bligh would forget these displays instantly and attempt to resume normal conversation.|$|E
5|$|Irene {{remained}} {{confined in}} a palace at the Harbour of Eleutherios {{in the capital}} and retained her formal title as empress. Then, on 15 January 792, for reasons not clear, she was recalled to the imperial palace with her title as empress and co-ruler confirmed and her name restored in the imperial acclamations. Staurakios too {{seems to have been}} recalled and, along with Irene, again took {{an active role in the}} governance of the state. This turn of events drove the Armeniacs once again <b>to</b> <b>mutiny,</b> but their commander, Alexios Mosele, was in Constantinople. Despite guarantees of safety, Mosele was imprisoned and later blinded at the instigation of Irene and Staurakios, both eager to take revenge for his role in their overthrow in 790.|$|E
5|$|On {{arrival in}} England, Baker {{declined}} re-enlistment into the British Marines {{and returned to}} civilian life. Within six months he received an appointment from the Navy Board to act as civilian superintendent of convicts aboard the transport vessel Surprize, which departed for New South Wales in early 1794. A British loyalist, Baker took an immediate dislike to four of the convicts under his watch, sentenced for political offences and collectively known as Scottish Martyrs. Late in the voyage he advised Surprizes captain Patrick Campbell that the Martyrs planned <b>to</b> <b>mutiny</b> and seize the vessel. Acting on Baker's word, Campbell had {{three of the four}} confined until Surprize reached Sydney Cove.|$|E

50|$|A new Mutiny Act {{was passed}} each year until 1879. The Mutiny Act was soon {{modified}} to allow courts-martial for other crimes besides mutiny, sedition, and desertion. Modifications <b>to</b> the <b>Mutiny</b> Act soon allowed courts-martial trial of soldiers for acts prohibited by the Crown’s articles of war, {{as long as}} the articles conformed <b>to</b> the <b>Mutiny</b> Act in 1718. Civilians who were closely associated to the military, such as victuallers, could also be tried by courts-martial.|$|R
5|$|The deposed Sultan made an {{unsuccessful}} appeal to Kenya and Tanganyika for military assistance, although Tanganyika sent 100 paramilitary {{police officers to}} Zanzibar to contain rioting. Other than the Tanganyika Rifles (formerly the colonial King's African Rifles), the police were the only armed force in Tanganyika, and on 20 January the police absence led the entire Rifles regiment <b>to</b> <b>mutiny.</b> Dissatisfied with their low pay rates and with the slow progress of the replacement of their British officers with Africans, the soldiers' mutiny sparked similar uprisings in both Uganda and Kenya. However, order on the African mainland was rapidly restored without serious incident by the British Army and Royal Marines.|$|E
5|$|In January 1654, the anti-Polish {{alliance}} of Pereiaslav was concluded between the rebellious Cossack Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky and Alexis of Russia, {{who was in}} control of a well-equipped army that was undergoing modernization. In 1654, when Charles X Gustav succeeded his cousin Christina on the Swedish throne, Russian forces were advancing into the unprotected Commonwealth, and {{by focusing on the}} northeast these drew close to the Swedish sphere of interest at the Baltic coast. Seeing the great success on the Russian side, Sweden also decided to intervene, among other reasons using the explanation that it was to protect the Protestant population in Poland. Having a close relationships with the Prince of Transylvania, Sweden had intentions to defeat the Catholic Poland. Sweden also drew the rising Cossack Hetmanate to its side that stood in the strong opposition to the Polish government and promised military support if the Cossacks will break with the Russians. Bohdan Khmelnytsky sent an expedition headed by the Kiev colonel to Halychyna which soon turned back due <b>to</b> <b>mutiny</b> within its ranks. The leader of Hetmanate did not participate in actions due to poor health conditions.|$|E
5|$|The American {{troops had}} signed up to capture Louisbourg, and {{expected}} to go home after siege ended. The British government, who had believed that the provincial troops were incapable of capturing Louisbourg on their own, had made no plans to send British troops to take over occupation of the fortress. When it become evident that British troops would not be relieving the provincials until after winter had passed, Governor Shirley travelled to Louisbourg to raise {{the morale of the}} troops. His first speech to the troops had little effect, and some troops were close <b>to</b> <b>mutiny.</b> In a second speech Shirley promised to send home more troops immediately, and provide higher pay and better supplies for those who stayed until spring. Honors from the British government were sparse; Pepperrell was made a baronet, he and Shirley were made colonels in the British Army with the right to raise their own regiments, and Warren was promoted to rear admiral.|$|E

5|$|The {{men came}} close <b>to</b> <b>mutiny</b> at Aux Cayes in February 1819 when MacGregor {{failed to produce}} the 80 silver dollars per man on arrival promised by his recruiters. MacGregor persuaded South American merchants in Haiti to support him with funds, weapons and ammunition, but then procrastinated and gave the order to sail for the island of San Andrés, off the Spanish-controlled Isthmus of Panama, only on 10 March. Going first to Jamaica to arrange {{accommodation}} for Josefa and Gregorio, MacGregor was almost arrested there on charges of gun-running. He joined his troops on San Andrés on 4 April. The delay had led to renewed dissension in the ranks that the stand-in commander Colonel William Rafter had difficulty containing. MacGregor restored morale by announcing that they would set out to attack Porto Bello on the New Granadian mainland the following day.|$|E
5|$|On 15 February, the 5th Light Infantry {{stationed}} at Singapore {{was among the}} few units <b>to</b> <b>mutiny</b> successfully. Nearly eight hundred and fifty of its troops mutinied {{on the afternoon of}} the 15th, along with nearly a hundred men of the Malay States Guides. This mutiny lasted almost seven days, and resulted in the deaths of 47 British soldiers and local civilians. The mutineers also released the interned crew of the SMS Emden, who were asked by the mutineers to join them but refused and actually took up arms and defended the barracks after the mutineers had left (sheltering some British refuges as well) until the prison camp was relieved. The mutiny was suppressed only after French, Russian and Japanese ships arrived with reinforcements. Of 200 people tried at Singapore, 47 mutineers were shot in public executions, the rest were transported for life to East Africa. Most of the rest were deported for life or given jail terms ranging between seven and twenty years. In all 800 mutineers were either shot imprisoned or exiled Some historians, including Hew Strachan, argue that although Ghadar agents operated within the Singapore unit, the mutiny was isolated and not linked to the conspiracy. Others deem this as instigated by the Silk Letter Movement which became intricately related to the Ghadarite conspiracy.|$|E

Fighting known as the Battle of the Observatories continued for local advantage all summer on the Chemin des Dames and along the Moronvilliers heights east of Reims. In late October the French conducted a limited-objective attack on the west end of the Chemin-des-Dames in the Battle of La Malmaison, which forced the Germans to retire across the Ailette valley.|$|R
