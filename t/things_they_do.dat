5|$|Andrea Anders as Linda Katherine Zwordling: Linda is {{a tester}} {{in one of}} Veridian's departments. She finds herself very {{attracted}} to Ted, but maintains other relationships and reminds Ted repeatedly that he has rejected {{the idea of a}} workplace romance with her. She seems to be a bit of an outsider to the corporate culture. Often she demands that Ted consider the horrible ramifications of the company policies or activities. Her relationship with the scientists is strained by her rejection of the weird <b>things</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> in the name of science. Despite this, she finds herself increasingly looking at Veronica as a mentor as the series progresses.|$|E
25|$|Adventure Program is {{for boys}} and girls in third through fifth grade. Adventure members earn Action Crafts beads for all the new <b>things</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> and for the good habits they learn. At this level youth begin to accept more {{responsibility}} for choosing and planning their club activities.|$|E
25|$|People who are poor, perhaps homeless, without {{dependable}} transportation cannot {{afford to}} run {{all over town}} seeking such services, and often they don’t know where to begin. Despite being aware of the overwhelming needs many students face, we force all children—regardless of interest or aptitude—into academic courses and then fight an uphill battle to motivate them to do <b>things</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not want to do.|$|E
60|$|It <b>did.</b> <b>They</b> {{started with}} {{breaking}} a cup. That {{was the first}} <b>thing</b> <b>they</b> <b>did.</b> <b>They</b> <b>did</b> that just {{to show you what}} <b>they</b> could <b>do,</b> and to get you interested.|$|R
5000|$|The party plan is {{criticized for}} {{exploiting}} social conventions and pressuring [...] "guests" [...] into buying <b>things</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not want.|$|R

500|$|Themes in {{the series}} often revolve around {{forbidden}} love, such as those involving Bluestar and Oakheart, Graystripe and Silverstream, Leafpool and Crowfeather, and Dovewing and Tigerheart. These relationships are not allowed for various reasons: some involve medicine cats (such as Leafpool), who cannot have mates, while others develop between cats in different Clans, which is forbidden by the warrior code. Holmes said that another central theme of the series centres on [...] "faith and spirituality" [...] in StarClan. [...] All books {{in the series}} feature the influence of StarClan, not just as the cats think of them, {{but in terms of}} prophecies delivered by StarClan which inevitably come true. [...] Some scenes take place within StarClan's realm, with no living cats present as point-of-view characters. [...] Thus the existence of an afterlife and the influence of spirits who have passed on and yet retain their earthly identities is integral to all of the plot arcs in the series. Another idea explored in the novels is the reactions of different faiths when meeting each other. For example, the Tribe of Rushing Water, which believes in different spiritual ancestors than the Clans, is introduced in Moonrise. In an author chat, Holmes explained that the books never say that either of the Clans or the Tribe of Rushing Water is right about faith because both are [...] "equally valid." [...] This leads to fear and suspicion between them because they are afraid of <b>things</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not understand. Holmes said that [...] "ignorance is a very scary thing!" [...] Non-belief is also significant in the storylines: Mothwing and Cloudtail do not believe in StarClan.|$|E
2500|$|It is a {{difficult}} and dangerous thing in a democracy to prevent {{a substantial part of}} the population from doing <b>things</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not regard as wrong. ... The freedom with which a person can walk about and look around is a very useful guide to the civilized quality of an urban area ... judged against this standard, many of our towns now seem to leave a great deal to be desired ... there must be areas of good environment where people can live, work, shop, look about and move around on foot in reasonable freedom from the hazards of motor traffic.|$|E
2500|$|As {{in other}} novels by Vonnegut, certain {{characters}} cross over from other stories, making cameo appearances and connecting the discrete novels {{to a greater}} opus. Fictional novelist Kilgore Trout, often an important character in other Vonnegut novels, in Slaughterhouse-Five is a social commentator and a friend to Billy Pilgrim. In one case, {{he is the only}} non-optometrist at a party, therefore, he is the odd-man-out. He ridicules everything the Ideal American Family holds true, such as Heaven, Hell, and Sin. In Trout's opinion, people do not know if the <b>things</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> turn out to be good or bad, and if they turn out to be bad, they go to Hell, where [...] "the burning never stops hurting." [...] Other crossover characters are Eliot Rosewater, from God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater; Howard W. Campbell, Jr., from Mother Night; and Bertram Copeland Rumfoord, relative of Winston Niles Rumfoord, from The Sirens of Titan. While Vonnegut re-uses characters, the characters are frequently rebooted and do not necessarily maintain the same biographical details from appearance to appearance. Kilgore Trout in particular is palpably a different person (although with distinct, consistent character traits) in each of his appearances in Vonnegut's work.|$|E

5000|$|Just like YCDTOTV {{that had}} a mean {{producer}} that was mean to the kid cast and often made them <b>do</b> <b>things</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> {{not want to do}} who that would sometimes appear on the show, Dont Look Now [...] also claimed to have a mean producer who made people <b>do</b> <b>things</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not want to do, like make Bajah drink papaya juice which she hated, but unlike YCDTOTV the producer of Dont Look Now [...] never appeared on the show.|$|R

6000|$|... “Captain Blunt doesn’t {{seem to be}} a {{very happy}} person,” I said. “He seems to have a grudge against everybody. People make him wince. The <b>things</b> <b>they</b> <b>do,</b> the things they say. He must be awfully mature.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes! so did I," [...] {{she said}} with a sigh, [...] "Pretty women," [...] she added meditatively, [...] "ought {{to have a good time}} in England, since all the {{pleasant}} things are forbidden them--the very <b>things</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> every day." ...|$|E

60|$|BLY. Well, Governments! They're all the same--Butter when they're out of power, {{and blood}} when they're in. And Lord! 'ow they do abuse other Governments for doin' the <b>things</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> themselves. Excuse me, I'll want her dosseer back, sir, when you've done with it.|$|E
60|$|It {{is always}} better for boys to be modest and humble-minded. They appear ridiculous to others {{when they are}} boasting what great things they can do; and when they boast what good <b>things</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> they are very likely to be just {{on the eve of}} doing exactly the opposite.|$|E
60|$|The {{above is}} a fair {{specimen}} of a shopman--a favourable rendering. There are other <b>things</b> <b>they</b> <b>do,</b> but I simply cannot write about them because it irritates me so to think of them. One infuriating manoeuvre is to correct your pronunciation. Another {{is to make a}} terrible ado about your name and address--even when it is quite a well-known name.|$|E
60|$|The two snakes {{looked at}} each other in dismay. The ring and the casket were the only <b>things</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not want her to have. Then after a short pause they spoke.|$|R
50|$|After {{the series}} ended, several contestants spoke {{out and said}} that they felt disrespected by the {{production}} company, that they were directed and controlled to say and <b>do</b> <b>things</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not really want to do http://www.dagbladet.no/kultur/2004/11/30/416140.html.|$|R

60|$|This argument, {{drawn from}} {{universal}} consent, has this misfortune in it, {{that if it}} were true in matter of fact, that there were certain truths wherein all mankind agreed, it would not prove them innate, if there can be any other way shown how men may come to that universal agreement, in the <b>things</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> consent in, which I presume may be done.|$|E
60|$|The others, tipsy, sat {{round the}} table with the terrified gravity of {{children}} who are somehow responsible for <b>things</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not understand. They stirred in their seats, turning aside, with gestures almost of pain, of imprisonment. Only Alfredo, laying his hand on mine, was laughing, loosely, floridly. He would upset all the Government with a jerk of his well-built shoulder, and then he would have a spree--such a spree. He laughed wetly to me.|$|E
6000|$|... "And there's a sort {{of beauty}} in it--there they are at Richmond {{at this very moment}} {{building}} things up. They're all wrong, perhaps, but there's {{a sort of}} beauty in it," [...] she repeated. [...] "It's so unconscious, so modest. And yet they feel <b>things.</b> <b>They</b> <b>do</b> mind if people die. Old spinsters are always doing things. I don't quite know what they do. Only that was what I felt when I lived with them. It was very real." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And a {{very good}} <b>thing</b> <b>they</b> <b>did,</b> {{to put a stop}} to such doings as never was," [...] said Mrs Hewlett's voice. [...] "Bless me, the dear {{children}} and the ladies might have been burnt in their beds!" ...|$|R

5000|$|... "We {{evolved to}} be goal-striving creatures. You'll regret more {{the things that}} you didn't do than the things you did." [...] —Thomas Gilovich Gilovich has {{researched}} the causes of regret. A study he conducted in 1994 found that specific actions people wish they hadn't taken are regretted more in the short run, but ultimately, inactions are regretted more in the long run. He has continued to emphasize that people tend to regret the <b>things</b> <b>they</b> don't <b>do</b> more than the <b>things</b> <b>they</b> <b>did.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "You have it now," [...] Savine {{declared}} very gravely. [...] "As you know, {{my life is}} uncertain, and I {{believe you}} faithful and strong enough {{to take care of}} Helen. After all, what more could I look for? Still, if she does not like you, there will be an end of the matter. It may be many would blame me for yielding, but I believe I could trust you, Thurston--and there are <b>things</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not know." ...|$|E
6000|$|Ecclesiastically-minded {{persons are}} {{in the habit of}} calling <b>things</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not like by very hard names, and I should not wonder if they brand the {{proposition}} I am about to make as blasphemous, and worse. But, not minding this, I venture to ask, Would there really be anything wrong in using part of Sunday for the purpose of instructing those who have no other leisure, in a knowledge of the phaenomena of Nature, and of man's relation to Nature? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 2. The same {{may be said}} {{concerning}} Jesus Christ, who doubtless loveth and tendereth the honour of his own merits, {{as much as any}} who {{are saved}} by him can do, whether they be in heaven or earth; yet he hath promised a reward to a cup of cold water, or giving of any other alms; and hath further told us, they that do these <b>things,</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> lay up treasure in heaven, namely, a reward when their Lord doth come, then to be received by them to their eternal comfort.|$|E
60|$|When <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not {{understand}} a <b>thing</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> {{not hesitate to}} ask questions, and they found the other persons present very willing to explain and to help them.

6000|$|... "Charge be damned!" [...] Mr. Horser answered. [...] "The police don't want {{particulars}} from me. When I say <b>do</b> a <b>thing</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> it. <b>They</b> {{know that}} if they declined it would be their last day on the force." ...|$|R
6000|$|The boy did {{not notice}} his insinuation. [...] "I suppose there were some <b>things</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> in the army, and then they couldn't get over the habit. But General Grant says in his 'Life' that he never used a profane expletive." ...|$|R
