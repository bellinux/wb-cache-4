5|$|As {{with any}} theory, {{a number of}} mysteries and {{problems}} have arisen {{as a result of}} the development of the Big Bang theory. Some of these mysteries and problems have been resolved while others are still outstanding. Proposed solutions to some of <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Big Bang model have revealed new mysteries of their own. For example, the horizon problem, the magnetic monopole problem, and the flatness problem are most commonly resolved with inflationary theory, but the details of the inflationary universe are still left unresolved and many, including some founders of the theory, say it has been disproven. What follows are a list of the mysterious aspects of the Big Bang theory still under intense investigation by cosmologists and astrophysicists.|$|E
5|$|Concerns over {{possible}} violent outbreaks {{continued for}} many years. Chartism became {{prominent in the}} region in the late 1830s, again causing Bute considerable worries in 1839 and leading to him encouraging the mobilisation of military forces to deal with the threat. Bute began to advocate the creation of a police force to suppress <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> northern valleys, for once allying himself with the local ironmasters to overcome rural opposition to the scheme. In 1841 the scheme was passed by the Glamorgan magistrates, with a chief constable and headquarters established that year.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, the Earl of Pembroke {{had been}} {{negotiating}} with France {{to resolve the}} long-standing disagreements over the administration of Gascony, {{and as part of}} this Edward and Isabella agreed to travel to Paris in June 1313 to meet with Philip IV. Edward probably hoped both to resolve <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> south of France and to win Philip's support in the dispute with the barons; for Philip it was an opportunity to impress his son-in-law with his power and wealth. It proved a spectacular visit, including a grand ceremony in which the two kings knighted Philip's sons and 200 other men in Notre Dame, large banquets along the River Seine, and a public declaration that both kings and their queens would join a crusade to the Levant. Philip gave lenient terms for settling the problems in Gascony, and the event was spoiled only by a serious fire in Edward's quarters.|$|E
5|$|Michael Farrar {{underwent}} surgery in December 1995 to treat an abscess {{in his brain}} caused by the poisoning. Fearful that Farrar would not survive the proceedings, and knowing that his testimony was key to their case, prosecutors videotaped his testimony beforehand. The surgery was successful, and Farrar testified in person and recounted Green's problems with alcohol and the break-up of their marriage. Under cross-examination by Green's counsel, he admitted that both he and Green had contributed to <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> couple's marriage and that {{his relationship with his}} son had been so adversarial that they had sometimes come to blows.|$|E
5|$|Hermética's last {{concert was}} held in Mar del Plata. Their second concert in Obras was canceled; rumors that Iorio had {{contracted}} hepatitis B {{turned out to be}} false. The other members sent him a formal request to attend the concert but Iorio refused and the band broke up. Iorio did not attend any meeting since then and ordered the other band members to stop using the name Hermética, which Iorio had invented. Iorio gave his first interviews after the break-up to the Clarín newspaper and the other members to the music magazine Madhouse. Iorio said that the band had always been united, but few weeks before their final concert, the members were not talking to each other. He said he had lied about having hepatitis B, expecting to end the hostilities, but it did not work. Iorio flew from Mar del Plata to Buenos Aires to avoid seeing the other members, who returned by bus. O'Connor, Romano, and Strunz stated in Madhouse magazine that the harsh relation was because Iorio had not consulted the others about the decisions he was making, that he received most of the money, and that he avoided meeting them when they were discussing <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> band.|$|E

5|$|In all versions, Khandoba {{returns to}} Jejuri {{with his new}} wife and faces the wrath of Mhalsa. Many songs tell about the {{confrontations}} of Mhalsa and Banai. In some songs, Mhalsa complains about Khandoba's infatuation with the impure Banai. The cantankerous Mhalsa grumbles how Banai has polluted the house by her uncouth ways and suggests that Banai {{should be returned to}} the wilderness again. The songs sing how the vegetarian, high-caste Mhalsa is forced to catch fish and eat in the same plate as the non-vegetarian low-caste Banai. Mhalsa is portrayed blaming Banai for <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> palace and talking about her superiority to Banai. Banai retorts by saying that Khandoba came to her, mesmerized by her beauty and became her servant. A frustrated Khandoba leaves the palace on a hunting trip after Mhalsa and Banai quarrel about who will embroider a shawl for him and marries Rambhai. The songs also narrate how ultimately the wives have to remain in harmony and aid each other. For example, a song sings how Mhalsa and Banai come together and celebrate the festival of Diwali with Khandoba at Jejuri.|$|E

The lead–zinc ore also contained increasing amounts of fine-grained, carbonaceous pyrite (FeS2). This material was naturally hydrophobic and floated {{without the aid of}} a collector into the lead concentrate, diluting it. The additional sulfur from the pyrite in the lead concentrate reduced the lead smelter's lead production because the ability to eliminate sulfur from the concentrate was lead smelter's capacity bottleneck.|$|E

The near-full reservoir behind the St. Francis dam was the only source of water from the north and withdrawals began immediately.|$|E

25|$|Sonya {{becomes the}} {{convenor}} {{of the local}} Gambler's Anonymous support group and meets Patricia Pappas, her neighbour Chris's (James Mason) mother. She learns that Patricia does not know that Chris's boyfriend Hudson Walsh (Remy Hii) is serving time in prison for murder, and inadvertently reveals Chris's secret to her. Soon after Patricia is arrested for theft to fund her gambling, leading to Chris discovering her secret. Chris is angry with Sonya, calling her a hypocrite. However, Chris {{come to terms with}} his mother's problem, and turns to Sonya for advice. Sonya spends less time at home with Toadie, Callum and Nell, causing strain on her marriage. Toadie hires Naomi Canning as his personal assistant and her mother, Sheila (Colette Mann), warns Sonya to be wary of her daughter. Sonya reluctantly allows Callum to go to the United States after he wins an overseas scholarship. <b>The</b> <b>problems</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Rebecchi marriage continue when Sonya starts spending all of her time helping Mark Brennan and Bailey Turner (Calen Mackenzie) through their issues. Sonya and Toadie have a big argument in public, and Sonya goes away with Nell. On her return, she learns Naomi kissed Toadie and Sonya slaps her during a confrontation. She later apologises to Naomi. Sonya and Toadie agree to cut back on their work, so that they can spend more time together, and eventually convinces Naomi to return to working for Jarrod as he loses customers. Sonya supports Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis) when he falls ill with depression, allowing him to visit the nursery to be at one with nature. When Paul recovers, he uses the nursery, and Sonya, as a marketing campaign to try to get himself re-elected as mayor; however, the nursery is trashed by Jayden Warley (Khan Oxenham) in revenge as his mother Sue Parker (Kate Gorman) is the stand-in mayor. Paul convinces Sonya not to press charges against Jayden and Sonya realises that Paul did this to blackmail Sue into standing down as mayor.|$|E
