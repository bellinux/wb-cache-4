5|$|Professor Onassis, {{who invented}} the time machine in the 1800s, arrives in the {{original}} version of the machine soon after and future Candace steals it. She travels back to the day the boys built the rollercoaster in their backyard and succeeds in getting her mother to see them, finally fulfilling her dream of busting them. However, in doing so, she accidentally leads Perry, their pet platypus who is secretly a suave secret agent, to be injured while stopping an evil magnet mechanism. As a result, Perry's nemesis, Dr. Doofenshmirtz, comes out unharmed {{from the effects of}} the now-destroyed machine. Over time, everything is altered and the Tri-State Area becomes childproof for fear of a repeat of Phineas and Ferb's dangerous activities. Doofenshmirtz eventually gains the upper hand, effectively becoming the ruler. He claims <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> Emperor, though, since he can remember everyone's name (though this is considerably easier than it seems, since one of his rules is that everyone has to be named Joe and requires everyone to wear lab coats at all times). Also, because of Doofenshmirtz succeeding, the Agency is now forced into a oath to obey him, resulting a demoralized Perry to fail more on his missions against Doofenshmirtz and is forbidden to use the time machine that Candace previously used as suggested by Major Monogram. After arriving in the dystopian future Doofenshmirtz rules, Candace finds the time machine in a junk yard and returns to the day of the rollercoaster to stop herself from interfering like before, stopping the dystopia from occurring.|$|E
25|$|The Sussex Railroad, {{operating}} under the DL as the Sussex Branch, began its slow, early decline in the late 19th century, owing {{to the discovery of}} better ore elsewhere in the country. Many industries and mines began to close in Sussex County, including the blast furnace in Franklin that shut down in 1900. Still, there was some expansion: A new station was added at Cranberry Lake, which proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> country get away and weekend vacation spot for residents, and the Netcong-Stanhope Cutoff was completed in 1900, thus prompting the abandonment of the line to Waterloo.|$|E

In September, he first made claims that U2 were working on three separate album projects: a [...] "rocking club album" [...] comprising material the group previously wrote with producer Rick Rubin but shelved; the songs {{that he and the}} Edge had written for Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark; and Songs of Ascent. Bassist Adam Clayton was sceptical about Bono's statements, believing their material to still be in its infancy, while the Edge said he was not sure if the Spider-Man songs would be released as a U2 album or a cast recording, adding: [...] "The Spider-Man collection is the most developed but the least appropriate to the band. We've got so much material at different stages of completion, it's going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> problem when we've got a few weeks to look at it."

Having come up with little new material in the previous six months, Harrison revisited songs he had written or begun writing in 1973, one of which was titled [...] "World of Stone". While discussing the song in September 1975, with BBC Radio 1 disc jockey Paul Gambaccini, Harrison commented: [...] "There's not much of a story to it ... it's really just down to saying that everybody has their own opinion and right <b>to</b> <b>be</b> ...

40|$|Abstract: This note {{deals with}} a problem of the {{probabilistic}} Ramsey theory in functional analysis. Given a linear operator T on a Hilbert space with an orthogonal basis, we define the isomorphic structure Σ(T) as the family of all subsets of the basis so that T restricted <b>to</b> their span <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> isomorphism. Our main result <b>is</b> <b>a</b> dimension-free optimal estimate {{of the size of}} Σ(T). It improves and extends in several ways the principle of restricted invertibility due to Bourgain and Tzafriri. With an appropriate notion of randomness, we obtain a randomized principle of restricted invertibility. 1...|$|R

Edmondson revealed that [...] "Abra comes back as a patient because some trauma has happened in Africa {{and he will be}} sponging off Ric." [...] Expanding on this, he explained: [...] "Abra’s in a very fragile state, as he’s suffering from post-traumatic stress. He keeps hurting himself, but no one knows why. Ric’s pretty off with Abra at first, but he agrees to let him stay at his place for a week. Abra used <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> guy, but he’s horrible now. Something happened to him on his travels, though even I haven’t been told what it is yet. What I do know is that Abra has a huge machete scar on his back... I imagine he’s been though some horror." [...] He has stated that this appearance in the show will last four or five months, and that he doesn't yet know how the character will be written out this time, beyond there being [...] "some kind of mental-health issue." [...] It emerged that Abra had borne witness to a violent attack on the hospital he was working in the Congo, eventually leading to him checking into a psychiatric unit. After being discovered being treated by his own mother, Kyla and Lola Griffin convinced him to discharge himself and return to Ghana. He returned briefly to Holby in December 2008, when he convinced Kyla to move to Ghana with him, proposing marriage to her.|$|E

Hale's name precedes Bopp's because his was the first report to arrive. It is uncertain {{who was the first}} to discover it, as they both spotted it at around the same time. The following day Hale phoned Bopp to introduce himself with the words, [...] "I think that we have something in common."

40|$|An {{important}} subclass of D-branes on a Calabi-Yau manifold, X, are in 1 - 1 {{correspondence with}} objects in D(X), the derived category of coherent sheaves on X. We study {{the action of}} the monodromies in Kaehler moduli space on these D-branes. We refine and extend a conjecture of Kontsevich about the form of one of the generators of these monodromies (the monodromy about the "conifold" locus) and show that one can do quite explicit calculations of the monodromy action in many examples. As one application, we verify a prediction of Mayr about {{the action of the}} monodromy about the Landau-Ginsburg locus of the quintic. Prompted by the result of this calculation, we propose a modification of the derived category which implements the physical requirement that the shift-by- 6 functor should be the identity. Boundary Linear sigma-Models prove <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> very <b>nice</b> physical model of many of these derived category ideas, and we explain the correspondence between these two approache...|$|R

Surprise everyone and make her a really evil chick." [...] Her quotes were designed {{to have a lot of}} double entendres, with writer Kawasaki, citing one quote that while it appears as a compliment of their physique, her opponent may take offense to it. Initially, she was designed to be always smiling, similar to other female characters according to developer Kamei. However, it did not fit, resulting in the team working on other faces, some he describes as [...] "scary." [...] The team eventually settled on a [...] "cool-headed" [...] look. Kamei commented that one of his favourite expressions of Juri's is the one she makes when she appears to be having fun; he adds that this look made him feel like the animators had finally began to understand the character. In designing her eyes, Kamei wanted her eyes to have more expression to them than other characters, commenting that the team [...] "wanted her to tell a story with her eyes." [...] Because of the anger from Korean fans over the lack of a Korean character in Street Fighter, the team decided to make her a strong character. Juri is said to have a warlike and provocative character and enjoys playing around with her opponent while beating them.

50|$|Given {{an action}} {{of a group}} G on a topological space X by homeomorphisms, a {{fundamental}} domain (also called fundamental region) for this action <b>is</b> <b>a</b> set D of representatives for the orbits.

One typical condition is that D <b>is</b> almost <b>an</b> open set, {{in the sense that}} D is the symmetric difference of an open set in G with a set of measure zero, for a certain (quasi)invariant measure on X. A fundamental domain always contains a free regular set U, an open set moved around by G into disjoint copies, and nearly as good as D in representing the orbits. Frequently D <b>is</b> required <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> complete set of coset representatives with some repetitions, but the repeated part has measure zero.
