5|$|German {{intelligence}} {{suggested that}} the RAF was down to just 300 serviceable fighters on 17 August 1940, taking into consideration German pilots' claims and their estimates of British production capabilities. In fact, there were 855 machines serviceable, with another 289 at storage units and 84 at <b>training</b> <b>units.</b> These resources were included {{in a total of}} 1,438 fighters, twice as many as at the beginning of July 1940. Expecting weakening opposition, the Luftwaffe prepared for a major action against RAF Sector Stations on 18 August.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the winter}} of 1941–42 the Soviets {{transferred}} all of the remaining MiG-3s to the Navy and PVO so that on 1 May 1942 none were left on strength with the VVS. By 1 May 1942, Naval Aviation had 37 MiGs on strength, while the PVO had 323 on hand on 10 May. By 1 June 1944, the Navy had transferred all its aircraft to the PVO, which reported only 17 on its own strength, {{and all of those}} were gone by 1 January 1945. Undoubtedly more remained in <b>training</b> <b>units</b> and the like, but none were assigned to combat units by then.|$|E

5|$|Players {{begin with}} a {{constructed}} town center or a wagon that will build into such, an armed explorer, and a modest number of villagers. Players explore the map and begin gathering resources used to build additional units and buildings and to research upgrades or technologies. Actions such as <b>training</b> <b>units,</b> constructing buildings, killing enemy units etc., earn the player experience points. At certain experience point thresholds, players earn shipments that may be turned in for cards from the player's Home City, which can include units, upgrades, or resources. The game progresses similar to most real-time strategy games until one side resigns.|$|E
5|$|Stewart did not embark for the Middle East until June 1917. Most of his war {{service was}} in Egypt, {{where he was}} the {{adjutant}} of the New Zealand <b>Training</b> <b>Units</b> and Depots there. He also spent a period of time with the headquarters of the Australian and New Zealand Mounted Division, which was serving in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign. By the end of the war, he had been promoted to captain and was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire for his services. He returned to New Zealand in December 1919 and his service with the NZEF was terminated.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the battalion's other ranks were drawn from men who were originally part of the 8th reinforcement draft, intended {{to be sent to}} the Middle East as reinforcements for the New Zealand 2nd Division. Sugden had previously been commandant of the Army School and was familiar with most of the graduates of the recent officer cadet <b>training</b> <b>units.</b> He selected many of these as the battalion's officers while a few other officers were sourced from the 3rd New Zealand Tank Battalion. Upon establishment, the battalion consisted of a headquarters company, three rifle companies and a machine gun/support company.|$|E
5000|$|No. 8 Operational <b>Training</b> <b>Unit</b> (8OTU) was an {{operational}} <b>training</b> <b>unit</b> of the Royal Australian Air Force formed at RAAF Station Narromine, Narromine, New South Wales in 1942.|$|R

50|$|No. 2 (Coastal) Operational <b>Training</b> <b>Unit</b> RAF was a <b>training</b> <b>unit</b> {{operated}} by the Royal Air Force Coastal Command. The unit started operating from late 1940 and disbanded during early 1944.|$|R
5|$|After {{five years}} of war and heavy {{attrition}} many of the Luftwaffe's pilots were inexperienced fledgelings and poorly trained, deficient in marksmanship and flight skills. There was a shortage of experienced instructors, {{and many of the}} <b>training</b> <b>units</b> were forced to fly front-line operations in order to bolster the front-line Jagdgeschwader. Long-range Allied fighters exacerbated this situation by shooting down many training aircraft. By late 1944 there were no safe areas in which pilots could be trained without the possibility of air attack. Allied personnel who witnessed the attacks frequently remarked on the poor aim of the strafing aircraft, and many of the Luftwaffe aircraft shot down by Allied anti-aircraft fire were caught because they were flying too slowly and too high. Aviation fuel supplies were also at a premium.|$|E
5|$|During World WarII, the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) {{established}} several operational <b>training</b> <b>units</b> (OTUs) {{to convert}} recently graduated pilots from advanced trainers to combat aircraft, and to add fighting ability to the flying skills {{they had already}} learned. Post-war demobilisation saw the disbandment of these OTUs, and operational conversion of new pilots became the responsibility of front-line squadrons. This practice impacted upon the squadrons' standard duties, {{and the advent of}} the Korean War and introduction of jet aircraft further necessitated a more formal training system. The Air Force's initial move in this direction was to re-establish No.2 (Fighter) Operational Training Unit at RAAF Base Williamtown, New South Wales, in March 1952; it was renamed No.2 (Fighter) Operational Conversion Unit in September 1958.|$|E
5|$|For torpedo {{training}} it {{was even}} more difficult. Shallow water was needed to recover training duds. Torpedoes usually sank by 20 to 50 feet before making their run. Thorney Island was selected but then quickly ruled out as a useful site. It was later used, but at the time, its location near Portsmouth was considered too near the English Channel and as a result Turnberry in south-west Scotland was selected instead with Fighter Command giving up the site to Coastal Command. These Torpedo <b>Training</b> <b>Units</b> (TTU) were formed in January 1943. Training in this regard enabled the Command to cope with increasing demands for trained aircrews.|$|E
50|$|It {{was first}} {{activated}} as the 326th Fighter Squadron {{and served as}} an air defense and operational <b>training</b> <b>unit</b> until 1 March 1944, and then a replacement <b>training</b> <b>unit</b> until 31 March 1944.|$|R
50|$|No. 3 (Coastal) Operational <b>Training</b> <b>Unit</b> RAF (3 OTU) was a <b>training</b> <b>unit</b> of Royal Air Force Coastal Command, {{operating}} from 27 November 1940 and disbanding 4 January 1944, being absorbed into No. 6 OTU.|$|R
50|$|No. 89 {{squadron}} {{was formed}} on 1 September 1917 as a <b>training</b> <b>unit</b> at Netheravon. The squadron {{was not used}} for operations and remained a <b>training</b> <b>unit</b> until it was disbanded on 4 July 1918.|$|R
5|$|In August 1941, McAloney {{was posted}} to the Directorate of Equipment at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne. In this {{capacity}} he advised on the procurement {{of equipment and}} spare parts for RAAF aircraft. He was further tasked with compiling a register of aeroplane equipment at RAAF flight <b>training</b> <b>units</b> and operational bases throughout Australia. The latter entailed McAloney visiting several Air Force units in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland to check equipment stores. On 1 March 1942, he was commissioned as a flying officer. Transferred to the Directorate of Equipment Administration in July, McAloney was made Officer Commanding Technical and Photographic Staffs {{and served as a}} liaison between his own directorate and that of Technical Services.|$|E
5|$|Two <b>training</b> <b>units</b> also {{operated}} the Vengeance. No. 2 Operational Training Unit received {{several of the}} type in 1942. On 1 October 1942, No. 4 Operational Training Unit (No. 4 OTU) was formed at RAAF Station Williamtown to train aircrews to operate the Vengeance in combat. The unit began its first operational conversion training course on 28 October that year. No. 4 OTU's fleet of Vengeances was augmented with several Wirraways in January 1943; from this time crews began their training on the simple-to-operate Wirraway before progressing onto the Vengeance. Two of the dive bombers were destroyed in flying accidents during August and September 1943, resulting {{in the deaths of}} their crews.|$|E
5|$|Cunningham and Rawnsley {{were soon}} ordered to staff positions. It was a {{compulsory}} order for fighter pilots {{even when the}} men considered themselves fit for operational duties. Before they departed Middle Wallop and 604, {{they had a chance}} to test the new 4-inch (10 cm) AI Mk. VIII radar which had a range of two or three miles (3–5 kilometres). The new radar was a radical improvement. All the information was displayed on a single tube. The ground echo was reduced but could still be seen on screen when flying low, but it did not interfere with the overall picture. Cunningham was to take over as director of all <b>training</b> <b>units</b> from Rory Chisholm who left 604 to become a staff officer at group headquarters. Rawnsley was due to take an instructors job at 62 Operational Training Unit (OTU) at Usworth. Cunningham managed to persuade the CAS to deploy him to headquarters at No. 81 Group RAF, the training organisation for RAF Fighter Command. Rawnsley was also promoted to squadron leader and was awarded the DFC and Distinguished Flying Medal (DFM). The pair remained grounded for six months until January 1943.|$|E
50|$|The {{airfield}} {{opened on}} 26 January 1942, hosting No. 59 Operational <b>Training</b> <b>Unit</b> RAF, a fighter <b>training</b> <b>unit,</b> later {{joined by the}} Specialised Low Attack Instructors School. The OTU trained ground-attack pilots for the Hawker Typhoon.|$|R
50|$|Activated during World War II as a B-17 Flying Fortress {{operational}} <b>training</b> <b>unit</b> (OTU). Redesignated as {{a replacement}} <b>training</b> <b>unit</b> (RTU) in August 1943. Inactivated in April 1944 when Second Air Force switched to B-29 Superfortress training.|$|R
50|$|Activated {{in early}} 1942 as a B-24 Liberator Operational <b>Training</b> <b>Unit</b> (OTU), later {{becoming}} a Replacement <b>Training</b> <b>Unit</b> (RTU) for deployed combat units, assigned to II Bomber Command. Inactivated in April 1944 when heavy bomber training ended.|$|R
