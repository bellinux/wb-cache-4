5|$|That same year, Brian Hodgson, who {{had spent}} many years in Nepal serving as the Assistant Resident, and who had a good {{knowledge}} about Nepal's bio-diversity, culture, and politics, became the new British Resident. Although the British Residents were officially instructed <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the internal politics of Nepal, the Resident was courted by both the King {{as well as the}} Mukhtiyar. Hodgson was waiting for an opportunity to exploit the rift between the Mukhtiyar and the royal family and begin a more aggressive campaign to increase British influence and trading opportunities. Hodgson also believed the large standing army to be a security threat and that the border tensions could be pacified if the King was directly in control, rather than a mukhtiyar who needed to keep {{on the right side of}} the army. By 1834, Hodgson had come to a conclusion that he would not be able to have his way so long as Bhimsen was in control of the Nepalese administration; thus he strongly sympathized with the Pande faction, and he wished to install Fateh Jung Shah, who was more favorably disposed to him, as the mukhtiyar. In August 1834, Hodgson proposed to conduct a new commercial treaty between Nepal and Britain, which Bhimsen in principle agreed to but disagreed with several of the clauses. At a time when his authority was diminishing, Bhimsen could not afford to antagonize the Resident; but at the same time, he could not accept his proposals and be seen as subservient to the British by the Nepalese court. Nevertheless, he tried to maintain a friendly and conciliatory attitude toward the Resident, in order to win him as his ally, by loosening the restrictions on his movements and granting direct access to the King.|$|E

25|$|From the {{inception}} of the violence that began in Syria {{as a result of the}} Arab Spring, the Syrian Civil War has produced and inspired a great deal of strife and unrest among armed factions.

25|$|In 1790, Clark was {{commissioned}} by General Arthur St. Clair, governor of the Northwest Territory, as a captain in the Clarksville, Indiana militia.

25|$|Due to the {{convention}} that Whips do not speak in Parliament, Heath managed <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{the controversy over the}} Suez Crisis. On the announcement of Eden's resignation, Heath submitted a report on the opinions of the Conservative MPs regarding Eden's possible successors. This report favoured Harold Macmillan and helped to secure Macmillan the premiership in January 1957. Macmillan later appointed Heath Minister of Labour, a Cabinet Minister—as Chief Whip Heath had attended Cabinet, but had not been formally a member—after winning the October 1959 election.|$|E
25|$|In 1879, Smith {{arrived in}} Denver {{for the first}} time. By 1882, he had {{successfully}} built {{the first of his}} empires.

By 1887, he was reputedly involved with most of the criminal bunko activities in the city. Newspapers in Denver reported that he controlled the city's criminals and underworld gambling, and accused corrupt politicians and the police chief of receiving graft from him.|$|E

25|$|With {{the death}} of Austin Corbin in June 1896 the LIRR was reorganized {{and the decline of}} the Manhattan Beach line started. Various rapid transit lines in Brooklyn had been unified under the Brooklyn Rapid Transit (BRT) system, and a {{connection}} was built between the Fulton Street Elevated and the Brighton Line, which was long opposed by Corbin, and this led to a decline in revenue for the Manhattan Beach. The LIRR and BRT agreed <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the other's business after an agreement was made on April 1, 1899. The BRT's acquisition of all of the Brooklyn Elevated railroads was no longer opposed by the LIRR, and a connection at Sheepshead Bay was built so that trains from the Brighton Line could go to the Manhattan Beach Hotel. Control of the Culver Line was given to the BRT soon afterwards.|$|E
25|$|Preston Manning {{denied that}} he and most Reformers based their {{policies}} on intolerant views, but admitted that the Reform Party's populism had in inadvertent effect of drawing in some intolerant people whom Manning claimed he had always sought <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the Reform Party. Manning claimed {{that he was just}} as committed to purging extremists from the Reform Party as his father Ernest Manning had done as Alberta Social Credit Party leader, in purging anti-Semites from Social Credit. Manning stated that during the 1988 election he was faced with such an extremist who had joined the Reform Party named Doug Collins who was seeking nomination as a Reform candidate, Manning was faced by calls by many Reform Party supporters themselves who condemned Collins as being racist and said that they would leave the party if he were nominated. Manning responded by sending a letter to the constituency association which called for all candidates to accept the Reform Party's denouncement of racism and demanded that Collins accept this, Collins and his supporters refused and he subsequently failed to win the nomination.|$|E
25|$|Obtaining a Social Security {{number for}} a child is voluntary. Further, there is no general legal {{requirement}} that individuals join the Social Security program unless they want or have to work. Under normal circumstances, FICA taxes or SECA taxes will be collected on all wages. About {{the only way to}} avoid paying either FICA or SECA taxes are to join a religion that does not believe in insurance, such as the Amish, Christian Science or a religion whose members have taken a vow of poverty (see IRS publication 517 and 4361). Federal workers employed before 1987, various state and local workers including those in some school districts who had their own retirement and disability programs were given the one-time option of joining Social Security. Many employees and retirement and disability systems opted <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the Social Security system because of the cost and the limited benefits. It was often much cheaper to obtain much higher retirement and disability benefits by staying in their original retirement and disability plans. Now only a few of these plans allow new hires to join their existing plans without also joining Social Security. In 2004, the Social Security Administration estimated that 96% of all U.S. workers were covered by the system with the remaining 4% mostly a minority of government employees enrolled in public employee pensions and not subject to Social Security taxes due to historical exemptions.|$|E
