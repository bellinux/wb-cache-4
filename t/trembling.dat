5|$|<b>Trembling</b> Before G-d is an 2001 American {{documentary}} film about {{gay and lesbian}} Orthodox Jews trying to reconcile their sexuality with their faith. It was directed by Sandi Simcha DuBowski, an American who wanted to compare Orthodox Jewish attitudes to homosexuality with his own upbringing as a gay Conservative Jew.|$|E
5|$|With a seed {{grant from}} Steven Spielberg, {{the creators of}} the film have set up the <b>Trembling</b> Before G-d Orthodox Education Project, to teach Orthodox {{educators}} and rabbis about homosexuality, as well as convening the first Orthodox Mental Health Conference on Homosexuality and training facilitators to show the film to community leaders. Over 2000 principals, educators and school counselors have attended screenings within Israel's religious school system. The film has now been seen by an estimated 8 million people worldwide. Following the success of <b>Trembling</b> before G-d, DuBowski produced a documentary about gay devout Muslims entitled A Jihad for Love.|$|E

5|$|Southern Labrador {{is mostly}} taiga. It is {{characterized}} by low winter temperatures, a longer growing season, and more precipitation than the tundra. Soils are typically lacking important nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus. The taiga is dominated by coniferous trees, notably balsam fir and black spruce, though the deciduous white birch, <b>trembling</b> aspen and mountain ash are also present. The most common animals are the moose, American black bear, Canada lynx, red fox, pine marten, short-tailed weasel, and American mink. Beavers, muskrats, and river otters thrive in the many rivers, streams, and wetlands. Willow ptarmigan, common raven, and blackpoll warbler inhabit the forests of southern Labrador while golden eagles, rough-legged hawks and peregrine falcons nest on steep cliffs.|$|E

40|$|The {{function}} of the honey bee <b>tremble</b> dance and how it attracts signal receivers is poorly understood. We tested the hypothesis that <b>tremble</b> followers and waggle followers exhibit the same dance-following behavior. If correct, this could unify our understanding of dance following, provide insight into dance information transfer, and offer a way to identify the signal receivers of <b>tremble</b> dance information. Followers showed similar initial attraction to and tracking of dancers. However, waggle dancers were faster than <b>tremble</b> dancers, and follower-forward, -sideways, and -angular velocities were generally similar to the velocities of their respective dancers. Waggle dancers attracted followers from 1. 3 -fold greater distances away than <b>tremble</b> dancers. Both follower types were attracted to the lateral sides of dancers, but <b>tremble</b> followers were more attracted to the dancer's head, and waggle followers were more attracted to the dancer's abdomen. <b>Tremble</b> dancers engaged in 4 -fold more brief food exchanges with their followers than waggle dancers. The behaviors of both follower types are therefore relatively conserved. Researchers can now take the next steps, observing <b>tremble</b> followers to determine their subsequent behaviors and testing the broader question of whether follower attraction and tracking is conserved {{in a wide range}} of social insects...|$|R
5|$|Chris sets up {{a camera}} in his room to capture the creature. When he reviews the tape he finds no {{evidence}} of the Evil Monkey, and goes ahead with his plans on capturing him. The family is taken aback when Chris proves it is real by capturing the monkey, and showing it to them, but he turns {{out not to be}} evil after all. The monkey then explains himself to the Griffins for being here. He reveals that he got home from work one day and caught his wife cheating on him with another monkey. He went through a deep depression after the divorce, which costed him his job, and all his money was gone, meaning that he lost his house, so he moved into Chris's closet just until he finally got back on his feet, and has lived there for 9 years. He also reveals that the face he makes at Chris was what he makes when thinking, and he was really trying to talk with Chris this whole time (pointing at him was his only way of trying to start a conversation with him). In addition, the <b>trembling</b> was due to a copper deficiency. The monkey apologizes to Chris for unintentionally terrorizing him and wishes to start over. Chris is at first unconvinced, but when the monkey helps him write a book report, he is surprised to receive a passing grade, and the two become great friends.|$|E
5|$|Manuscripts 1eap and 1rK Erasmus {{borrowed}} from Johannes Reuchlin. The {{rest of the}} manuscripts he {{borrowed from}} Dominicans. It is significant {{that he did not}} use the Codex Basilensis, which was held at the Basel University Library, and was available for him. Erasmus had three manuscripts of the Gospels and Acts, four manuscripts of the Pauline epistles, but only one manuscript with the Book of Revelation. In every book of the New Testament he compared three or four manuscripts, except the last book, Book of Revelation. Unfortunately, this manuscript was not complete, it lacked the final leaf, which contained the last six verses of the book. Instead of delaying the publication, on account of the search for another manuscript, he decided to translate the missing verses from the Latin Vulgate into Greek. He used an inferior manuscript of Vulgate with textual variant libro vitae (book of life) instead ligno vitae (tree of life) in Rev 22:19. Even {{in other parts of the}} Book of Revelation and other books of the New Testament Erasmus occasionally introduced self-created Greek text material taken from the Vulgate. F. H. A. Scrivener remarked, that in Rev 17:4 he created a new Greek word: ἀκαθαρτητος (instead τὰ ἀκάθαρτα). There is no such word in Greek language as ακαθαρτητος. In Rev 17:8 he used καιπερ εστιν (and yet is) instead of και παρεσται (and shall come). In Acts 9:6 the question that Paul asks at the time of his conversion on the Damascus road, Τρέμων τε καὶ θαμβὣν εἲπεν κύριε τί μέ θέλεις ποιῆσαι ("And he <b>trembling</b> and astonished said, Lord, what will you have me to do?") was incorporated from the Vulgate.|$|E
25|$|Dr Heather Proctor (formerly at the University of Toronto, {{now at the}} University of Alberta) {{studied the}} {{courtship}} behaviour of Neumania papillator, and noticed that male leg <b>trembling</b> caused females (who were in the 'net stance') to orient towards and then often clutch the male. This did not damage the male or deter further courtship; the male then deposited spermatophores and began to vigorously fan and jerk his fourth pair of legs over the spermatophore, generating a current of water that passed over the spermatophores and towards the female, for about 60 seconds. Sperm packet uptake by the female would sometimes follow. Proctor hypothesised that the vibrations the <b>trembling</b> male legs made were done to mimic the vibrations that females detect from swimming prey - this would trigger the female's prey-detection response causing females to orient and then clutch at males, mediating courtship. If this was true and males were exploiting female predation responses, then hungry females should be more receptive to male <b>trembling</b> - Proctor found that unfed captive females did orient and clutch at males significantly more than fed captive females did, consistent with the sensory exploitation hypothesis. Further evidence for the sensory exploitation hypothesis resulted from a cladistic analysis comparing 28 characters between other water mites of the family Unionicolidae and identified the most likely evolutionary scenario (the fewest number of reversal of character states and the fewer parallel evolution of character states (homoplasies)) for the origin of both the <b>trembling</b> behaviour and the 'net stance'. If male courtship <b>trembling</b> behaviour only ever evolved after the net stance evolved in the species analyzed, then this {{support the idea that}} <b>trembling</b> was an exploitation of a preexisting female sensory system. The cladograms generated showed two equally plausible evolutionary histories: the 'net stance' and <b>trembling</b> either evolved concomitantly in the common ancestor of Neumania and Unionicola (a closely related mite in the same family (confamilial)) or net stance evolved and then <b>trembling</b> evolved twice afterwards. The former scenario is ambiguous and is not evidence for or against the sensory exploitation hypothesis, whilst the latter supports it.|$|E

25|$|In the Banggai cardinalfish, {{courtship}} {{behavior is}} usually {{initiated by the}} female. Upon choosing a mate, the female isolates her potential mate from other individuals in the colony by creating a spherical spawning site that is about 50-60 centimeters in diameter. The general movement that the female exhibits is called ‘side by side trembling,’ {{which is where the}} female approaches the male from behind with a vigorous <b>trembling</b> motion while the male stays motionless. Then she places herself alongside him and tilts her body thirty degrees outward from its vertical plane, when the male and female’s caudal and anal fins come into contact. The female repeats this movement until the male responds with sporadic ‘mouth opening,’ a sign of receptiveness. Such courtship behavior may last from several hours to two to three days. When an intruder interrupts a female’s courtship behavior, the female would rapidly and aggressively chase the intruder away if the intruder is of the same sex. However, when the secondary male, or the intruder male approaches, he, instead of the female, exhibits <b>trembling</b> behavior, and also helps to defend the female and primary male’s isolated territory. If the primary male does not respond to female’s <b>trembling,</b> the female leaves periodically to visit the secondary male and displays <b>trembling</b> behavior which often results in mating.|$|E
25|$|Early {{symptoms}} {{may include}} loss of precision muscle coordination (sometimes first manifested in declining penmanship, frequent small injuries to the hands, and dropped items), cramping pain with sustained use, and <b>trembling.</b> Significant muscle pain and cramping {{may result from}} very minor exertions like holding a book and turning pages. It may become {{difficult to find a}} comfortable position for arms and legs with even the minor exertions associated with holding arms crossed causing significant pain similar to restless leg syndrome. Affected persons may notice <b>trembling</b> in the diaphragm while breathing, or the need to place hands in pockets, under legs while sitting or under pillows while sleeping to keep them still and to reduce pain. <b>Trembling</b> in the jaw may be felt and heard while lying down, and the constant movement to avoid pain may result in the grinding and wearing down of teeth, or symptoms similar to temporomandibular joint disorder. The voice may crack frequently or become harsh, triggering frequent throat clearing. Swallowing can become difficult and accompanied by painful cramping.|$|E
