5|$|Agricultural {{improvements}} {{beginning in}} the 17th century resulted in <b>the</b> <b>enclosure</b> of the commons and ultimately in the Victoria era the emergence of large and well-managed farms using a five-shift rotation system and producing high-quality beef cattle.|$|E
5|$|The {{cemetery}} {{consists of}} neat lines of graves arranged on an east–west alignment, covering a nearly square area of about , in a layout {{not seen in}} any other known Anglo-Saxon cemetery. <b>The</b> <b>enclosure</b> within which the cemetery was laid out was many centuries older, dating to about 200BC; {{the establishment of a}} cemetery within its boundaries was probably intended to serve as a deliberate link to the past. It would still have been clearly visible in Saxon times. The layout of the cemetery seem to have consciously reflected that of the earlier enclosure, with its apparent main entrance aligned with that of <b>the</b> <b>enclosure.</b>|$|E
50|$|The zoo has {{a variety}} of <b>enclosures.</b> <b>The</b> <b>enclosures</b> are {{primarily}} constructed of metal posts and chain-wire mesh. Some of <b>the</b> <b>enclosures</b> are topped with barbed wire, others completely enclosed with wire mesh, while others have roofs of corrugated iron, depending on the inhabitant. Each of <b>the</b> <b>enclosures</b> has concrete flooring, some with ponds set into the floor others with small pools on top of the flooring. A number of <b>the</b> <b>enclosures</b> retain signage. <b>The</b> crocodile <b>enclosure</b> is away {{from the rest of the}} zoo and is adjacent to the swimming pool. Animals known to have been housed in Strathmore private zoo include buffalo, deer, monkeys, a camel, numerous bird species and a crocodile.|$|R
40|$|Results of {{measurement}} and modelling of pollutant gases {{inside and outside}} 11 enclosures used to protect exhibited objects in 10 European museums are presented. Monthly average values for ozone, nitrogen dioxide, formic and acetic acid, temperature and relative humidity inside <b>the</b> <b>enclosures,</b> and yearly average values for the pollutants inside and outside <b>the</b> <b>enclosures</b> are presented for each enclosure. An available pollution impact model was adapted to <b>the</b> use with <b>enclosures.</b> Model calculations are presented for the expected change in concentrations of the oxidizing: ozone and nitrogen dioxide, and acidic: acetic and formic acid, pollutants depending on possible change in the ventilation rate of <b>the</b> <b>enclosures</b> and on inclusion of active carbon absorber to reduce the concentrations. The modelling results are presented as the ‘impact concentration’ of the pollutants by weighing the measured concentrations with their respective recommended levels. In several of <b>the</b> <b>enclosures</b> a clear correlation was observed between temperature and/or relative humidity and the concentration of acetic and formic acid. The modelling showed that all of <b>the</b> <b>enclosures</b> protected against air pollutants, but that only one of <b>the</b> 11 <b>enclosures</b> satisfied <b>the</b> recommended level. The recommended level could be reached for all <b>the</b> <b>enclosures</b> by reducing <b>the</b> ventilation or including active carbon absorber to cover the floor area...|$|R
50|$|Viewing {{platforms}} {{are positioned}} throughout the park, which are wheelchair-friendly and allow visitors to view {{into some of}} <b>the</b> <b>enclosures</b> from an elevated position. They are located at <b>the</b> giraffe/ostrich <b>enclosure,</b> <b>the</b> lion reserve and the Amur tiger habitat.|$|R
5|$|The {{purpose of}} Neolithic causewayed {{enclosures}} is unclear, {{and they probably}} had a variety of functions. As well as burials, indicating the site at Maiden Castle was important for rituals related to death, pottery from the coast and areas {{to the east and}} west indicate it was used as a meeting place which attracted people over long distances. Radiocarbon dating indicates that <b>the</b> <b>enclosure</b> was abandoned around 3,400BC. Arrowheads discovered in the ditches may indicate that activity at <b>the</b> <b>enclosure</b> met a violent end.|$|E
5|$|Through <b>the</b> <b>enclosure</b> ran the processional path, {{which led}} from the temple {{entrance}} through the main gate in <b>the</b> <b>enclosure</b> wall. The path was frequently decorated with sphinx statues and punctuated by barque stations, where the priests carrying the festival barque could set it down to rest during the procession. The processional path usually ended in a quay on the Nile, which served as the entrance point for river-borne visitors and the exit point for the festival procession when it travelled by water. In Old Kingdom pyramid temples, the quay adjoined an entire temple (the valley temple), which {{was linked to the}} pyramid temple by the processional causeway.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} {{different}} calls have been recorded from captive birds, including harsh, harmonic, chatter and whistle vocalisations. Harsh calls were made when a bird was alarmed or agitated, whistle-type calls were emitted in general contexts, sometimes monotonously, and shorter duration 'chatter' calls were given when a bird sighted a human near <b>the</b> <b>enclosure.</b>|$|E
50|$|Course <b>Enclosure</b> <b>The</b> {{cheapest}} of <b>the</b> <b>enclosures</b> {{is situated}} in {{the centre of the}} course. It has its own bar, cafe, Tote Betting Shop, Bookmakers stands and 'big screen'; however, it lacks many of the facitities <b>the</b> other <b>enclosures</b> benefit from.|$|R
40|$|A mobile, self-powered, self-contained, and {{remote-controlled}} robot is presented. The robot {{is capable}} of safely operating in a combustible atmosphere and providing information about the atmosphere to the operator. The robot includes non-sparking and non-arcing electro-mechanical and electronic components designed to prevent the robot from igniting the combustible atmosphere. The robot also includes positively pressurized <b>enclosures</b> that house <b>the</b> electromechanical and electronic components of the robot and prevent intrusion of the combustible atmosphere into <b>the</b> <b>enclosures.</b> <b>The</b> <b>enclosures</b> are interconnected such that a pressurized gas injected into any one of <b>the</b> <b>enclosures</b> is routed to all <b>the</b> other <b>enclosures</b> through <b>the</b> interconnections. It is preferred that one or more sealed internal channels through structures intervening between <b>the</b> <b>enclosures</b> be employed. Pressure transducers for detecting if the pressure within <b>the</b> <b>enclosures</b> falls below a predetermined level are included. The robot also has a sensing device for determining the types of combustible substances in the surrounding atmosphere, {{as well as the}} concentrations of each type of substance relative to a pre-determined lower explosive limit (LEL). In addition, the sensing device can determine the percent level of oxygen present in the surrounding atmosphere...|$|R

5|$|In the North, the Wons Position {{formed a}} {{bridgehead}} {{at the eastern}} end of <b>the</b> <b>Enclosure</b> Dike; it had a long perimeter of about nine kilometres to envelop enough land to receive a large number of retreating troops without making them too vulnerable to air attack. On 12 May units with a combined strength of only two battalions were still present, so the line was weakly held. This was exploited by the first German unit to arrive, the single bicycle battalion of 1. Kavalleriedivision. At noon it quickly penetrated the line in a concentrated attack, forcing the defenders to withdraw to <b>the</b> <b>Enclosure</b> Dike. For some the German advance cut off their escape route by land; they sailed away from the small port of Makkum, taking the last remaining vessels on the eastern side of Lake IJssel. This denied the Germans any craft for a crossing attempt, which plan was now abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Organisations {{that remain}} {{critical}} of Edinburgh Zoo's work include the Animal Liberation Front, who have voiced their distaste {{for the quality}} of <b>the</b> <b>enclosure</b> that formerly housed polar bears. The Born Free Foundation has also stated several times that the zoo fails in its conservation work, as well as opposing the zoo's plans to house elephants.|$|E
5|$|The Knavesmire, home of York Racecourse, plays host to Yorkshire's largest beer festival every September run by York CAMRA – York Beer & Cider Festival. It {{is housed}} in a marquee {{opposite}} the grandstand of the racecourse in <b>the</b> <b>enclosure</b> and in 2016 will offer over 450 real ales and over 100 ciders.|$|E

50|$|Over {{the years}} various Acts of Parliament removed {{the right of}} the cottager to hold land. According to the Hammonds in their book The Village Labourer, before <b>the</b> <b>Enclosures</b> Act <b>the</b> cottager was a farm {{labourer}} with land, and after <b>the</b> <b>Enclosures</b> Act <b>the</b> cottager was a farm labourer without land.|$|R

5|$|The {{area around}} Arbroath has been {{occupied}} {{since at least}} the Neolithic period. Material taken from postholes from an enclosure at Douglasmuir, near Friockheim, about five miles north of Arbroath have been radiocarbon dated to around 3500BC The function of <b>the</b> <b>enclosure</b> is unknown, but may have been for agriculture or for ceremonial purposes.|$|E
5|$|Through {{the main}} {{doors of the}} Main Stand is a wood-panelled hallway. A {{staircase}} leads to the boardroom and trophy room. Inglis compared Ibrox to Highbury, in that it combined corporate power {{with a sense of}} tradition and solidity. It was originally constructed as a 10,000-seat stand above a standing enclosure. It was redeveloped in the early 1990s with the addition of the Club Deck and seating in <b>the</b> <b>enclosure.</b> It is now a three-tier all-seated structure, accommodating approximately 21,000 spectators. The front wall of the middle tier {{is one of the last}} surviving examples of the Leitch style of criss-cross detailing. The middle tier is split into front and rear sections, while <b>the</b> <b>enclosure</b> is split into east and west sections, either side of the retractable tunnel cover.|$|E
5|$|Adrian V {{abolished}} Gregory X's strict {{regulations in}} 1276, but Celestine V, elected in 1294 following a two-year vacancy, restored them. In 1562 Pius IV issued a papal bull that introduced regulations relating to <b>the</b> <b>enclosure</b> of the conclave and other procedures. Gregory XV issued two bulls {{that covered the}} most minute of details relating to the election; the first, in 1621, concerned electoral processes, while the other, in 1622, fixed the ceremonies to be observed. In December 1904 Pope Pius X issued an apostolic constitution consolidating almost all the previous rules, making some changes, Vacante sede apostolica. John Paul II instituted several reforms in 1996.|$|E

30|$|Still, all the {{measurement}} {{locations in the}} National military museum {{were found to be}} similar or better than typical European “historic house museums”. The observed reduction in the photo-oxidizing load and risk inside <b>the</b> <b>enclosures</b> in <b>the</b> Warehouse for foreign uniforms (1) and the contemporary history room in the main museum building (3) was an expected protective effect of <b>the</b> <b>enclosures.</b> <b>The</b> higher measured photo-oxidizing impact inside the wooden chest in the probative storage room (2) than in this room itself was thus surprising. This could be due to some unidentified oxidation impact, but probably more likely due to dust accumulation on the dosimeter glass, as the dosimeter was positioned horizontally besides rough textile materials (see Fig.  1, position 2 b). Although dust accumulation was probably not a risk for the objects in this case, this points to the possible damage risks that may occur when co-locating sensitive objects with objects or materials which off-gas or release harmful substances. The slightly higher acidic impact measured inside all <b>the</b> <b>enclosures</b> than in <b>the</b> respective rooms in the National military museum is typical. It is well known that the levels of gaseous organic compounds are usually higher inside than outside of enclosures [9, 12, 38]. This is due to the larger emitting surfaces as compared to the volumes and usually lower ventilation rates of enclosures as compared to rooms. The small differences between the measured acidic impact in <b>the</b> <b>enclosures</b> and <b>the</b> rooms in the National military museum indicated little risk related to organic acid off gassing in <b>the</b> <b>enclosures.</b> This may be due to relatively low emitting materials and/or ventilation effects in <b>the</b> <b>enclosures.</b> <b>The</b> emission from materials is typically reduced as they age, and <b>the</b> aging of <b>enclosures</b> contribute to lower internal off gassing.|$|R
40|$|The {{rates of}} {{ingestion}} of natural bacterial assemblages by natural populations of zooplankton (> 50 μm in size) were measured during a 19 -day period in eutrophic Frederiksborg Slotssø, Denmark, {{as well as}} in experimental enclosures (containing 5. 3 m 3 of lake water). The fish and nutrients of <b>the</b> <b>enclosures</b> were manipulated. In enclosures without fish, large increases in ingestion by zooplankton > 140 μm in size were found (up to 3 μg of C liter− 1 h− 1), compared with values less than 0. 3 μg of C liter− 1 h− 1 in <b>the</b> <b>enclosures</b> with fish and in the open lake. Daphnia cucullata and D. galeata dominated the community of zooplankton of > 140 μm. Ingestion rates for zooplankton between 50 and 140 μm decreased after a period of about 8 days, in all <b>enclosures</b> and in <b>the</b> lake, to values below 0. 1 μg of C liter− 1 h− 1. On the last 2 sampling days, somewhat higher values were observed in <b>the</b> <b>enclosures</b> with fish present. The > 50 -μm zooplankton ingested 48 to 51 % of the bacterial net secondary production in enclosures without fish, compared to 4 % in <b>the</b> <b>enclosures</b> with added fish. Considering the sum of bacterial secondary production plus biomass change, 35 to 41 % of the available bacteria were ingested by zooplankton of > 50 μm in <b>the</b> <b>enclosures</b> without fish, compared with 4 to 6 % in <b>the</b> <b>enclosures</b> with added fish and 21 % in the open lake. Fish predation reduced the occurrence of zookplankton sized > 50 μm and thus left {{a large proportion of the}} available bacteria to zooplankton sized < 50 μm. In fact, there were 4. 6 × 103 to 5. 0 × 103 flagellates (4 to 8 μm in size) ml− 1 in <b>the</b> <b>enclosures</b> with fish added {{as well as in}} the lake, compared with 0. 5 × 102 to 2. 3 × 102 ml− 1 in <b>the</b> <b>enclosures</b> without fish. This link in the food chain was reduced when fish predation on zooplankton was eliminated and a direct route of dissolved organic matter, via the bacteria to the zooplankton, was established...|$|R
5|$|An Enclosure Act is a {{parliamentary}} authority to fence-off common land, thus making that land private property, while awarding commoners land in compensation. Inclosure {{is the name}} given to the parliamentary statute thus created. <b>The</b> <b>enclosure</b> process began in the 13th century and was supported by Acts of Parliament from 1640. In November 1833, the Isle of Ely intended to apply for Acts of Parliament to enclose the lands of Little Thetford. Officials arrived in the village armed {{with nothing more than}} a notice to be pinned on the Church of England's St. George's church door, but were prevented from doing so by a dozen villagers. They returned later with ten constables, authorised by Ely magistrates, and were confronted this time by 150stick-wielding protesters, who continued to prevent due process. When the clergyman, Henry Hervey Baber, arrived the following afternoon, he was prevented from carrying out his normal Sunday service. Villagers may have rebelled against the church at this time, perhaps believing it was acting on behalf of the establishment in <b>the</b> <b>enclosure</b> acts. This event may have been the trigger that, five years later, encouraged a strong Baptist following amongst the poorer villagers. About half the total area of Little Thetford was eventually enclosed in 1844, seven years after that of Stretham.|$|E
5|$|As a {{three-way}} loudspeaker system employing six individual drive units, each Isobarik kabinet has two tweeters, two midrange drivers and two woofers. One driver of each frequency range faces forward; a second tweeter and midrange are {{mounted on the}} top surface of <b>the</b> <b>enclosure,</b> and one bass unit is hidden from view. While the bass units are isobaric loaded, the midrange is mounted in a terminated transmission line. Crossover points are set at 375Hz between the woofer and midrange, and 3kHz between the tweeter and midrange. The upward-firing drivers were designed to aid dispersion and improve the off-axis listening experience.|$|E
5|$|Based on this information, Frost {{decided to}} divide the company into five groups of forty men for the raid, each named after a famous Royal Navy admiral: 'Nelson', 'Jellicoe', 'Hardy', 'Drake' and 'Rodney'. 'Nelson' would clear and secure German {{positions}} defending the evacuation beach, whilst 'Jellicoe', 'Hardy' and 'Drake' would capture the radar site, villa and <b>the</b> <b>enclosure.</b> 'Rodney' was the reserve formation, placed between the radar site and the main likely enemy approach to block any counterattack.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>enclosures</b> contain several cenotaphs. In Enclosures 1 and 2, {{there are}} cenotaphs to 19 known burials whose {{original}} graves were destroyed in later fighting, and for 2 men buried in <b>the</b> former <b>Enclosure</b> 4 whose graves were also destroyed.|$|R
50|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} {{implies that}} <b>the</b> <b>enclosures</b> were visited occasionally by Neolithic groups {{rather than being}} permanently occupied. The presence of human remains in the banks and ditches of <b>the</b> <b>enclosures</b> {{has been seen as}} an attempt by the builders to connect their ancestors with the land and thus begin to anchor themselves to specific areas. Longitudinal sections excavated along the ditches by archaeologists suggest that the builders repeatedly redug the ditches and each time deliberately deposited pottery and human and animal bones, apparently as a regular ritual. Environmental archaeology suggests that the European landscape was in general heavily forested when <b>the</b> <b>enclosures</b> were built and that they were rare clearings in the woodland that were used for various social and economic activities.|$|R

5|$|Following the {{publication}} of the 1990 Taylor Report, {{in the wake of the}} Hillsborough disaster, top-flight English football grounds had to become all-seated. At the time three of the four sides of the ground had standing areas. <b>The</b> <b>Enclosure,</b> fronting the main stand, had already been made all-seated in time for the 1987–88 season and was given the new name of Family Enclosure. The Paddock, the Park End terrace and the Gwladys Street terrace, known as 'the Ground', were standing and had to be replaced.|$|E
5|$|Fort Eliza, {{also known}} as The Salt Battery, is a {{freestanding}} five-sided four-gun battery, constructed around 1812, and standing {{on the east side}} of the River Shannon. Three sides face the river and were formed of broad parapets. The other two sides meet at the rear salient angle at a guardhouse, which is now ruined. The battery is surrounded by a dry moat, with the entrance originally across a drawbridge close to the guardhouse. At the centre of <b>the</b> <b>enclosure</b> was the brick-vaulted powder magazine. This fort, combined with Cromwell's Castle, the Martello tower and Fort Falkland would have protected both the town and the river crossing from all angles.|$|E
5|$|Military {{architecture}} was {{the supreme}} {{expression of the}} Ayyubid period, {{as well as an}} eagerness to fortify the restoration of Sunni Islam, especially in a previously Shia-dominated Egypt by constructing Sunni madrasas. The most radical change Saladin implemented in Egypt was <b>the</b> <b>enclosure</b> of Cairo and al-Fustat within one city wall. Some of the techniques of fortification were learned from the Crusaders, such as curtain walls following the natural topography. Many were also inherited from the Fatimids like machicolations and round towers, while other techniques were developed simultaneously by the Ayyubids, particularly concentric planning.|$|E
60|$|First of {{all they}} {{declined}} to leave <b>the</b> <b>enclosures,</b> {{out of which}} they had tried pertinaciously to escape all the voyage. By way of overcoming this difficulty, Christian ordered <b>the</b> <b>enclosures</b> to be torn down, and the planks with {{which they had been}} formed were used as persuaders to urge the refractory creatures on. As each poke or slap produced a series of horrible yells, it may be understood that the operation was accompanied with noise.|$|R
5000|$|Status-wise, the bordar or cottar ranked below a serf in {{the social}} {{hierarchy}} of a manor, holding a cottage, garden and just enough land to feed a family. In England, {{at the time of}} the Domesday Survey, this would have comprised between about 1 and 5 acre. Under an Elizabethan statute, the Erection of Cottages Act 1588, the cottage had to be built with at least 4 acre of land. However, <b>the</b> later <b>Enclosures</b> Acts (1604 onwards) removed the cottars' right to any land: [...] "before <b>the</b> <b>Enclosures</b> Act <b>the</b> cottager was a farm labourer with land and after <b>the</b> <b>Enclosures</b> Act <b>the</b> cottager was a farm labourer without land".|$|R
