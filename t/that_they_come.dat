5|$|All these {{distributions}} have no or {{only minor}} changes {{when compared with}} the original FreeBSD base system. The main difference to the original FreeBSD is <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>come</b> with pre-installed and pre-configured software for specific use cases. This can be compared with Linux distributions, which are all binary compatible because they use the same kernel and also use the same basic tools, compilers and libraries, while coming with different applications, configurations and branding.|$|E
5|$|The hybrid {{program has}} been criticized, with one of Sulimov's colleagues {{pointing}} out that in other tests the Laika performed {{just as well as}} the jackal hybrids. The assumption that dogs have lost some of their scent-detection ability may be incorrect, in that dogs {{need to be able to}} scent-detect and identify the many humans <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>come</b> into contact with in their domesticated environment. Another researcher crossed German Shepherds with wolves and claimed that this hybrid had superior scent-detection abilities. The scientific evidence to support the claims of hybrid researchers is minimal, and more research has been called for.|$|E

5|$|The {{majority}} of Kentucky's citizens believed {{the state should}} be a mediator between the North and South. On December 9, 1860, Kentucky Governor Beriah Magoffin {{sent a letter to}} the other slave state governors, suggesting <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>come</b> to an agreement with the North that would include strict enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Act, a division of common territories at the 37th parallel, a guarantee of free use of the Mississippi River, and a Southern veto over slave legislation. Magoffin proposed a conference of slave states, followed by a conference of all the states to secure the concessions. Because of the escalating pace of events, neither conference was held.|$|E

25|$|Many Haredim who {{subscribe}} to the anti-Zionist view still immigrate to the Land of Israel. Their rationalization {{is that they do}} so only as individuals and families, but not as members of the organized mass-immigration, and <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>come</b> to the Land solely to live there, not in order to conquer it or rule over it. Such Haredim accordingly do not believe themselves to be in violation of the Three Oaths.|$|E

25|$|A growing {{population}} of Indians, primarily of the Sikh religion, were also required {{to abide by}} immigration laws starting in 1908, {{despite the fact that}} they were subjects of the British Empire. This culminated in the 1914 Komagata Maru incident, in which most of 376 immigrants on the Komagata Maru, most of them from the Punjab in India were not permitted to disembark because they had not complied with immigration laws that required <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>come</b> by a continuous passage from their home country.|$|E
25|$|Scrying {{has been}} practised in many {{cultures}} {{in the belief that}} it can reveal the past, present, or future. Some practitioners assert that visions that come when one stares into the media are from the subconscious or imagination, while others say <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>come</b> from gods, spirits, devils, or the psychic mind, depending on the culture and practice. There is neither any systematic body of empirical support for any such views in general however, nor for their respective rival merits; individual preferences in such matters are arbitrary at best.|$|E

25|$|An episode {{from the}} life of Krishna narrates of when he stole the {{garments}} of gopis when they were bathing in a pond near Vrindavan. Varuna, the sea-god, had forbidden nude bathing in rivers, ponds and other public places, but gopis often resorted to it. One day, to teach them a lesson, Krishna reached the bank of the pond where they were taking a bath and took away their garments and spread them on the branches of nearby kadamba tree. He himself climbed the tree and hid there behind a branch. After the gopis had bathed, they looked for their garments but found them missing. Suddenly their attention was drawn to the nearby kadamba tree by the stirring of its branches. When they looked up, they saw Krishna hiding there and their garments scattered all over the branches of the tree. Krishna insisted <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>come</b> out naked to receive their garments. This episode is portrayed in song, story, painting and artifacts, in the backdrop of the kadamba tree.|$|E
25|$|Several labour-sending {{countries}} have issued travel bans or restrictions for Lebanon in recent years, among them Ethiopia, Nepal and the Philippines. However, the Lebanese {{government has been}} ineffective with implementing the migration workers ban from entering into Lebanon from the country of Nepal simply kept issuing pre-approved work permits and visas. Madagascar issued its Lebanon ban as {{a direct consequence of}} the death of 17 Madagascan domestic migrant workers in 2010 which in 2011 also led the Madagascar Government to fly out 86 domestic migrant worker. Ethiopian women have reportedly tried to bypass restrictions imposed by their government to work as domestic workers in Lebanon by first embarking on journeys to Sudan or Yemen. A figure presented by Anti-Slavery International explains the lack of proper implementation of the travel bans on migrant workers coming to Lebanon, as irregular channels of bringing the workers still operate. The figure in 2010 is 65%, this represents the amount of workers who received their work permits despite the fact <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>come</b> from countries which are in the travel ban.|$|E
25|$|Ultimately, each {{relatively}} autonomous {{field of}} modern life, such as economy, politics, arts, journalism, bureaucracy, science or education engenders a specific complex {{of social relations}} where the agents will engage their everyday practice. Through this practice, they develop a certain disposition for social action that is conditioned by their position on the field (dominant/dominated and orthodox/heterodox are only two possible ways of positioning the agents on the field; these basic binary distinctions are always further analysed considering the specificities of each field). This disposition, combined with every other disposition the individual develops through his engagement with other fields operating within the social world, will eventually come to constitute a system of dispositions, known in Bourdieu's lexicon as a habitus. Dispositions - a key concept in Bourdieu's work - can be conceived as {{a sense of the}} game, a partly rational but partly intuitive understanding of fields and of social order in general, a practical sense, a practical reason, giving rise to opinions, tastes, tone of voice, typical body movements and mannerisms and so on. The dispositions constitutive of habitus are therefore conditioned responses to the social world, becoming so ingrained <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>come</b> to occur spontaneously, rather like 'kneejerk' opinions. It follows that the habitus developed by an individual will typify his position in the social space. By doing so, social agents will often acknowledge, legitimate and reproduce the social forms of domination (including prejudices) and the common opinions of each field as self-evident, clouding from conscience and practice even the acknowledgment of other possible means of production (including symbolic production) and power relations.|$|E
