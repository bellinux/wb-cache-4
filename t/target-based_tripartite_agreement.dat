40|$|This thesis investigates {{whether the}} <b>tripartite</b> <b>agreement</b> from March 17, 2016 on labour market {{integration}} of refugees {{can be seen as}} a development or dismantling of the Danish model. It is concluded that the agreement contains elements that are both developing and dismantling, but ultimately differs from fundamental principles in the Danish model, and as such, must be considered as primarily dismantling. This thesis especially focuses on the agreements most central features: the integration education (IGU). The answer is based on two parameters: 1) whether the agreement will meet the goal of getting more refugees into employment and 2) to which degree the IGU abide by the fundamental principles in the current Danish model. Parameter 1 is answered by analysing the <b>tripartite</b> <b>agreement</b> based on 6 relevant recommendations from OECD considering good labour market integration. The analysis illustrates that the <b>tripartite</b> <b>agreements</b> contents arguably will contribute to increased employment among refugees. Parameter 2 is evaluating the IGU consisting of two elements: education and employment. These elements are analysed historically based on the theories Industrial Relations and Historical Institutionalism. Building on this analysis, the thesis compares the pivotal ideas in the IGU with the leading principles in the Danish model. Evidently, the IGU is,for the most part, not conforming to the Danish model. Finally, the thesis establishes that the dismantling in Parameter 2 outweighs the development in Parameter 1. As such, the <b>tripartite</b> <b>agreement</b> is dismantling, rather than developing, the Danish model...|$|R
