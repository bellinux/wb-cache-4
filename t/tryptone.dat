T. celer {{is unable to}} use carbohydrates as a carbon source and is considered a sulphur-dependent organism as it depends upon the reduction of sulphur to hydrogen sulfide for optimal growth. Though it is less efficient, T. celer is also able to utilize fermentation. Unlike most prokaryotes, T. celer is able to perform respiration via the Embden-Meyerhof Pathway (glycolysis), though it uses an alternative route.|$|E

This is evident {{from the fact that the}} archaeon grew only in the presence of oxygen when nitrate was absent. It produces colonies that are round and greyish yellow. It utilizes both organic (maximal cell densities were observed with complex organics such as yeast extract, meat extract, <b>tryptone,</b> and peptone as substrates) and inorganic compounds during aerobic and anaerobic respiration. Also, use of elemental sulphur for growth was observed. Further, P. aerophilum grows between 75 and 104 °C with an optimal growth temperature at 100 °C.|$|E

For the detection of acid-resistant yeasts like Z. bailii, acidified media are recommended, such as MEA or TGY with 0.5% (v/v) acetic acid added. Plating with agar media is often used for counting of yeasts, with surface spreading technique is preferable to pour plate method because the former technique gives a better recovery of cells with lower dilution errors. The common incubation conditions are aerobic atmosphere, temperature 25 °C {{for a period of}} 5 days. Nevertheless, a higher incubation temperature (30 °C) and shorter incubation time (3 days) can be applied for Z. bailii, as the yeast grows faster at this elevated temperature.|$|E
5000|$|... == Metabolism == D. donghaensis {{performs}} light-driven {{sodium ion}} transport. This light-driven proton pump {{is called a}} proteorhodopsin, which increases the organism’s survival rate because it can convert light into energy that the organism needs to grow. Since the organism uses light for energy, it is a phototroph. D. donghaensis is able to secrete enzymes such as catalase and oxidase. Since the organism is a strict aerobe, it used oxygen as a terminal electron acceptor. The organism can grow on peptone and <b>tryptone</b> as the sole carbon and nitrogen sources. D. donghaensis cannot grow {{in the absence of}} NaCl or when it is greater than 7% (w/v); growth is optimal at 2% (w/v) NaCl. The organism is susceptible to the antibiotics tetracycline and carbenicillin, although the organism's ability to form biofilms makes it difficult for antibiotics to penetrate the viscous layers.|$|E
50|$|Thermotoga neapolitana is {{strictly}} heterotrophic for its metabolic needs. It can also facultatively reduce elemental sulfur to hydrogen sulfide. In growth experiments, {{it was found}} to multiply rapidly with glucose and yeast abstract. After 24 hours of growth, the longest rods divide into two rods, most likely in response to decreases levels of glucose availability. Glucose, sucrose, lactose, and starch nutrients all support growth when used as a sole source of energy. Low level of growth occurred with exposure to only peptone or <b>tryptone.</b> Thermotoga neapolitana is unable to metabolize acetate, lactate, formate, pyruvate, propionate, mannitol, ethanol, methanol, glycerol, glutamate, or glycine. Chloramphenicol, vancomycin, streptomycin were all found to completely inhibit growth, though it was resistant to rifampin. Growth can be found within a 0.25-6% NaCl range exclusively, with no survival outside of this limit. It was originally thought to be strictly anaerobic, but can also survive under micro-aerophilic environments.|$|E
5000|$|It grows between [...] and , with an optimum {{temperature}} of , and between pH 5 and 9 (with an optimum at pH 7). It grows well on yeast extract, maltose, cellobiose, β-glucans, starch, and protein sources (<b>tryptone,</b> peptone, casein, and meat extracts). This {{is a relatively}} wide range {{when compared to other}} archaea. Growth is very slow, or nonexistent, on amino acids, organic acids, alcohols, and most carbohydrates (including glucose, fructose, lactose, and galactose). The metabolic products of P. furiosus are CO2 and H2. The presence of hydrogen severely inhibits its growth and metabolism; this effect can be circumvented, however, by introducing sulfur into the organism's environment. In this case, H2S can be produced through its metabolic processes, although no energy seems to be derived from this series of reactions. Interesting to note is that, while many other hyperthermophiles depend on sulfur for growth, P. furiosus does not.|$|E

40|$|The {{nitrogen}} (N) sources including nitrate, ammonium, urea, <b>tryptone</b> and {{yeast extract}} were optimized for eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) production by the diatom Nitzschia laevis in heterotrophic cultures. First, nitrate and urea {{were found to}} be the preferred N sources for both cell growth and EPA content. The optimal concentrations of nitrate and urea for cell growth and EPA yield were 620 mg/liter and 600 mg/liter, respectively. Secondly, <b>tryptone</b> and yeast extract were respectively added to the medium and both of them were found to enhance EPA production compared with the control. To investigate the co-effects of <b>tryptone</b> and yeast extract, in the subsequent experiments, a central composite experimental design was used to optimize the two complex nitrogen sources. The results showed that the EPA production was influenced not only by <b>tryptone</b> or yeast extract, but also by their interactions. The cell dry weight (DW), EPA content and EPA yield could be described by the second-order polynomial equations with high confidence levels (> 99 %). Based on the surface plots of the responses, the optimal concentrations of <b>tryptone</b> and yeast extract were determined to be 1. 6 g/liter and 0. 8 g/liter, respectively. To verify the predicted models, the alga was grown in the medium with <b>tryptone</b> and yeast extract at optimal concentrations. The resulting DW, EPA content and EPA yield reached 6. 48 g/liter, 2. 74 % (w/w), and 175 mg/liter, respectively, which agreed with the predicted values, and were much higher than those obtained in the previous studies. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.
