5|$|His first {{exposure}} to musical training {{came in the}} form of piano lessons, which he later said in his instructional video A Work in Progress did not have much impact on him. He had a penchant for drumming on various objects around <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> pair of chopsticks, so for his thirteenth birthday his parents bought him a pair of drum sticks, a practice drum and some lessons, with the promise that if he stuck with it for a year they would buy him a kit.|$|E

5|$|On , {{a senior}} army officer on active duty, Major-General Sir Frederick Maurice, {{prompted}} a second crisis {{when he went}} public with allegations that Lloyd George had lied to Parliament on military matters. Asquith, the Liberal leader in the House, took up the allegations and attacked Lloyd George (also a Liberal). While Asquith's presentation was poor, Lloyd George vigorously defended his position, treating the debate as a vote of confidence. He won over <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> powerful refutation of Maurice's allegations. The main results were to strengthen Lloyd George, weaken Asquith, end public criticism of overall strategy, and strengthen civilian control of the military. Meanwhile, the German offensive stalled and was ultimately reversed. Victory came on 11 November 1918.|$|E
5|$|Sabina {{ran out of}} <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> hammer, {{periodically}} hitting herself {{over the}} head with it.

5|$|South Stoneham House was acquired, with South Hill (some {{two miles}} to the northwest), in 1920 to house male {{students}} at University College Southampton.

5|$|The {{house at}} Valley View is a two-story brick Greek Revival-style {{structure}} with a rectangular architectural plan. The front entrance {{is covered by}} a small portico, topped with a pediment supported by wooden Doric columns. The rear of <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> two-story (double) wood porch stretching across it, faces the South Branch Potomac River valley and Mill Creek Mountain. Each of the original eight large rooms of the 1855 structure contains a fireplace framed by a wooden trabeated mantelpiece with classical elements. The original windows, wooden trim, and materials in the main section of the house are intact. In 2012, Valley View was listed on the National Register of Historic Places for its locally significant architecture.|$|E

There were depictions of many gods there and a woman who is described as well dressed near the door.|$|E
5|$|Decatur House (748 Jackson Place NW) is {{allegedly}} {{haunted by}} the ghost of Stephen Decatur. In 1820, Commodore James Barron challenged Commodore Decatur to a duel over comments Decatur had made regarding Barron's conduct in the Chesapeake-Leopard Affair of 1807. The two men duelled on March 20, and Decatur was mortally wounded in the stomach. Decatur was rushed back to his home, and died there on March 22. A year after Decatur's death, his ghost reportedly began appearing at the house—standing in a second floor window looking out at H Street NW or leaving {{the back door of}} <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> box of dueling pistols. So many witnesses saw the specter of Decatur that the window was walled up. Some people have also claimed that they can hear his widow, who became hysterical at his death, weeping in the house.|$|E

5|$|From December 1559 Amy Dudley {{lived at}} Cumnor Place, near Abingdon in Berkshire (now in Oxfordshire). The house, an altered 14th century monastic complex, was rented {{by a friend}} of the Dudleys and {{possible}} relative of Amy's, Sir Anthony Forster. He lived there with his wife and Mrs. Odingsells and Mrs. Owen, relations of the house's owner. Lady Dudley's chamber was a large, sumptuous upper story apartment, the best of <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> separate entrance and staircase leading up to it. At the house's rear there were a terrace garden, a pond, and a deer park. Amy Dudley received the proceeds of the Robsart estate directly into her hands and largely paid for her own household, which comprised about 10 servants. She regularly ordered dresses and finery as accounts and a letter from her of as late as 24August 1560 show. She also received presents from her husband.|$|E
5|$|Seeing Arnaud felled by gunfire, Magruder, who {{was wearing}} body armor, stepped back and drew her sidearm. However, before she could return fire, Logan then shot six bullets at her, one of which struck her in the head, mortally {{wounding}} her. Logan then went over to Arnaud and, while standing over his body, shot him four more times, injuring his liver and inducing severe internal bleeding. Arnaud would die from severe gunshot-induced blood loss at the scene, but the mortally wounded Magruder was able to call for assistance over her radio at 9:34p.m. Logan's father, {{who was in the}} house's master bedroom, had heard the gunshots, and thinking that the deputies had shot him, went over to see what had happened. Instead, he saw Logan leaving <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> firearm in hand, and saw that the two deputies had been shot. Logan's father then called 9-1-1 via telephone at 9:39p.m. to report the shooting to authorities. Emergency medical technicians arrived and removed Arnaud and Magruder were removed from the house via stretchers, with Magruder being airlifted via medical helicopter to the Prince George's Hospital Center, with CPR being applied on her while en route. However, she would be pronounced dead at the hospital before midnight.|$|E
5|$|The family becomes {{increasingly}} frightened and distrustful of him, especially when his latest advice leads Hayley {{to be attacked}} by a shark. With the shark loose in the house, the family fights for survival. Stan loses hope and admits Francine's suggestions are better than his own, until Klaus gives him an encouragement speech which inspires him to prove himself reliable in a crisis once more. Stan obtains a bear from the zoo to battle the shark, which only further aggravates the situation when the two animals work together to kill the family. Refusing to accept Francine's pleas to just get help, Stan instead throws a javelin that hits his wife in her shoulder instead of the bear. Buckle enters <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> tranquilizer gun and sedates the two predators before also shooting Stan, who later tells Buckle that he made the right call. Despite the whole ordeal, Stan is no longer convinced that he should stay out of a future crisis.|$|E

5|$|The tariff fight {{continued}} into the 50th Congress, which opened in 1887, in which Democrats retained control of <b>the</b> <b>House,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> reduced majority. By that time, Cleveland had openly sided with the tariff reformers and backed the proposals introduced in 1888 by Representative Roger Q. Mills of Texas. Mills had replaced Morrison at Ways and Means after the latter's defeat for reelection, and was as {{much in favor of}} tariff reform as the Illinoisan had been. Mills's bill would make small cuts to tariffs on raw materials, but relatively deeper cuts to those on manufactured goods; Randall, representing a manufacturing district, opposed it immediately. Randall was again ill and absent from the House when the Mills tariff passed by a 162 to 149 vote. The Senate, now Republican-controlled, refused to consider the bill, and it died with the 50th Congress in 1889.|$|E
5|$|William Moreton III used what {{is today}} {{known as the}} Exhibition Room as a bedroom in the mid-17th century; it is entered through a doorway from the {{adjoining}} Withdrawing Room. Following William's death in 1654 his children Ann, Jane and Philip divided the house into three separate living areas. Ann, whose accommodation was in the Prayer Room above, then used the Exhibition Room as a kitchen. The adjoining Chapel, begun in 1508, is accessible by a doorway from the courtyard. The Chapel contains Renaissance-style tempera painting, thought to date from the late 16th century. Subjects include passages from the Bible. The chancel was probably a later addition dating from the mid-16th century. It is separated from the nave by an oak screen and projects eastwards from the main plan of <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> much higher ceiling. The stained glass in the east wall of the chancel is a 20th-century addition installed by Charles Abraham, the last private owner of Little Moreton Hall, as a parting gift on his transfer of ownership to the National Trust.|$|E
