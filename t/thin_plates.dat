To this day, indeed, leather {{is one of the}} most frequently employed materials for chair covering. The outstanding characteristic of most chairs until the middle of the 17th century was massiveness and solidity.

5|$|Cystidia {{that are}} located {{along the edge}} of the cap (called cheilocystidia) are spherical, and 30–120 by 20–74µm. The facial cystidia (called pleurocystidia) are {{club-shaped}} or elongated ellipses, up to 130–155µm in length. The pleurocystidia protrude from the face of the gill and act as guards, preventing adjacent gills from touching each other, and also ensuring that the basidia and spores have sufficient room for development. C.micaceus may also have scattered caulocystidia (cystidia on the stem) that are 60–100 by 5–10µm, but their presence is variable and cannot reliably be used for identification. Both De Bary and Buller, in their investigations into the structure of the cystidia, concluded that there is a central mass of cytoplasm formed where numerous <b>thin</b> <b>plates</b> of cytoplasm meet at the center of the cell. De Bary believed that the plates were filamentous branching processes, but Buller thought that they were formed in a process similar to the walls of foam bubbles, and that the central mass was able to slowly change form and position by altering the relative volumes of the vacuoles enclosed by the numerous thin cytoplasmic walls. In older cells, the cytoplasm may be limited to the periphery of the cell, with one huge vacuole occupying the cell center.|$|E

Its physical analogy involves a thin lying sheet of metal that is deformed and forced to pass {{through a set of}} control points. The <b>Thin</b> <b>Plate</b> Spline equation minimizes that <b>thin</b> <b>plate</b> bending energy. Rather than using Euclidean distances between control points for image deformation, we are using geodesic distances for image segmentation.

40|$|Residual {{stresses}} which {{occur in}} a <b>thin</b> <b>plate</b> and a film of both MEMS and an electric device have become a direct cause of a deformation and a destruction of them. To evaluate the residual stress is therefore very important for improving their mechanical reliability. A strain gauge is often incapable of using to measure the strain of the <b>thin</b> <b>plate</b> and the film, while X-ray diffraction method is effective in the nondestructive measurement of residual stress of them. If a diffracted X-ray transmitted through the <b>thin</b> <b>plate</b> is available, spacing of the lattice plane orthogonal to the direction along the surface could be measured directly. It suggests potentiality for the strain measurement of <b>thin</b> <b>plate</b> with high precision and efficiency. This paper presents a new measurement method of the stress in a polycrystalline <b>thin</b> <b>plate</b> by using transmission diffracted X-rays. This method is able to determine the principal stress and its direction in the <b>thin</b> <b>plate</b> from the measurement of the lattice spacing with random three directions within <b>thin</b> <b>plate</b> and the vertical direction of <b>thin</b> <b>plate</b> surface. The method was verified using a pure aluminum <b>thin</b> <b>plate</b> of 50 μm thickness which was loaded with tension using compact tensile loading equipment. The X-ray elastic modulus of Al(311) lattice plane which was measured {{at the start of}} the experiment was derived as Young's modulus of 61. 7 GPa and Poisson's ratio of 0. 33. As a result, principal stress and its direction in the aluminum <b>thin</b> <b>plate</b> could be evaluated with errors of less than about 9 MPa and 3 degree, respectively.

GeS2 forms as a white precipitate when hydrogen sulfide is passed through strongly acid solutions containing Ge(IV). The disulfide is appreciably soluble in water and in solutions of caustic alkalis or alkaline sulfides. Nevertheless, it is not soluble in acidic water, which allowed Winkler to discover the element. By heating the disulfide in a current of hydrogen, the monosulfide (GeS) is formed, which sublimes in <b>thin</b> <b>plates</b> of a dark color and metallic luster, and is soluble in solutions of the caustic alkalis.
