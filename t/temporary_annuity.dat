40|$|The paper {{approaches}} {{the potential of}} risk-adjusted performance indicators in life insurance, with special reference to a structured policy. The final issue is the computation of risk adjusted indicators {{as a tool to}} evaluate the portfolio given a policy structure. The computation of such indicator could be suitable for the appraisal of both portfolio optimization and potential profits of the structured policy. The selection tool is put into an asset and liability management decision making context, where the relationship between expected surplus and capital at risk are compared. The analysis is applied to a structured <b>temporary</b> <b>annuity</b> and is treated by means of Monte Carlo simulations...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} actuarial methods {{that are used}} for life {{insurance}} and reinsurance, for traditional insurance products (whole life, term insurance, pure endowment, endowment, whole life annuity, <b>temporary</b> <b>annuity).</b> The main goal of this thesis is to outline the actuarial methods used for life insurance premium and reinsurance premium. The work {{is focused on the}} comparison of the unisex rates, gender specific rates and legislation changes for both sides, insurance company and policyholder. The model examples for each combination of insurance type and gender specific rates (male, female and unisex) are presented. In {{the last part of the}} thesis, the time series of the written premium for the Czech Republic market are analyzed for years from 2006 to 2013. The regression model is used to predict the development in next two years...|$|E
50|$|A {{hybrid of}} these is when the {{payments}} stop at death, but also after a predetermined number of payments, if this is earlier: known as a <b>temporary</b> life <b>annuity.</b> The difference with the period certain annuity is that the period certain annuity will keep paying {{after the death of}} the nominee until the period is completed.|$|R
40|$|Both {{academics}} and practitioners don’t seem to {{pay too much}} attention to the databases of zero-coupon rates that they employ in their research and the implementation of models for valuation or risk measuring purposes. We show that significant differences may arise when using alternative popular and usually accepted interest rates databases. In particular, we show that these differences are relevant when calibrating well known interest rates models (Vasicek and Cox,Ingersoll and Ross) and also when valuing some insurance contracts such as <b>temporary</b> life <b>annuities...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model for}} the force of interest which is based on the consideration of a real force of interest deviations from its estimated value; the resulting stochastic process for financial evaluation is characterized by its expected value and autocovariance functions. Then applications of the results to actuarial contracts are proposed. In particular, the cases of <b>temporary</b> life <b>annuity</b> and n-year term life insurance are considered and their expected values and variances are illustrated.

40|$|Abstract: We study {{indifference}} pricing {{of mortality}} contingent claims in a fully stochastic model. We assume both stochastic {{interest rates and}} stochastic hazard rates governing the population mortality. In this setting we compute the indifference price charged by an insurer that uses exponential utility and sells k contingent claims to k independent but homogeneous individuals. Throughout {{we focus on the}} examples of pure endowments and <b>temporary</b> life <b>annuities.</b> We begin with a continuous-time model where we derive the linear pdes satisfied by the indifference prices and carry out extensive comparative statics. In particular, we show that the price-per-risk grows as more contracts are sold. We then also provide a more flexible discrete-time analogue that permits general hazard rate dynamics. In the latter case we construct a simulation-based algorithm for pricing general mortality-contingent claims and illustrate with a numerical example...|$|R
