This is done by varying the tension placed on the drumhead: the opposing drum heads are connected by a common <b>tension</b> <b>cord.</b> The waist of the drum is held between the player's arm and ribs, so that when squeezed the drumhead is tightened, producing a higher note than when it's in its relaxed state; the pitch can be changed during a single beat, producing a warbling note.

40|$|A {{system for}} {{mechanical}} suspension and vibration isolation {{of a machine}} or instrument {{is based on the}} use of Kevlar (or equivalent aromatic polyamide) cord held in variable tension between the machine or instrument and a surrounding frame. The basic concept of such a tensioned-cord suspension system (including one in which the cords are made of aromatic polyamide fibers) is not new by itself; what is new here is the additional provision for adjusting the tension during operation to optimize vibration- isolation properties. In the original application for which this system was conceived, the objective is to suspend a reciprocating cryocooler aboard a space shuttle and to prevent both (1) transmission of launch vibrations to the cryocooler and (2) transmission of vibrations from the cryocooler to samples in a chamber cooled by the cryocooler. The basic mechanical principle of this system can also be expected to be applicable to a variety of other systems in which there are requirements for cord suspension and vibration isolation. The reciprocating cryocooler of the original application is a generally axisymmetric object, and the surrounding frame is a generally axisymmetric object with windows (see figure). Two cords are threaded into a spoke-like pattern between attachment rings on the cryocooler, holes in the cage, and cord-tension- adjusting assemblies. Initially, the <b>cord</b> <b>tensions</b> are adjusted to at least the level necessary to suspend the cryocooler against gravitation. Accelerometers for measuring vibrations are mounted (1) on the cold tip of the cryocooler and (2) adjacent to the cage, on a structure that supports the cage. During operation, a technician observes the accelerometer outputs on an oscilloscope while manually adjusting the <b>cord</b> <b>tensions</b> in an effort to minimize the amount of vibration transmitted to and/or from the cryocooler. A contemplated future version of the system would include a microprocessor-based control subsystem that would include cord-tension actuators. This control subsystem would continually adjust the <b>cord</b> <b>tension</b> in response to accelerometer feedback to optimize vibration-isolation properties as required for various operating conditions. The control system could also adjust <b>cord</b> <b>tensions</b> (including setting the two <b>cords</b> to different <b>tensions)</b> to suppress resonances. Other future enhancements could include optimizing the cord material, thickness, and braid; optimizing the spoke patterns; and adding longitudinal cords for applications in which longitudinal stiffness and vibration suppression are required...|$|R
50|$|Newton was {{concerned}} {{to address the}} problem of how it is that we can experimentally determine the true motions of bodies in light of the fact that absolute space is not something that can be perceived. Such determination, he says, can be accomplished by observing the causes of motion (that is, forces) and not simply the apparent motions of bodies relative to one another (as in the bucket argument). As an example where causes can be observed, if two globes, floating in space, are connected by a cord, measuring the amount of <b>tension</b> in the <b>cord,</b> with no other clues to assess the situation, alone suffices to indicate how fast the two objects are revolving around the common center of mass. (This experiment involves observation of a force, the tension). Also, the sense of the rotation —whether it is in the clockwise or the counter-clockwise direction— can be discovered by applying forces to opposite faces of the globes and ascertaining whether this leads to an increase or a decrease in the <b>tension</b> of the <b>cord</b> (again involving a force). Alternatively, the sense of the rotation can be determined by measuring the apparent motion of the globes with respect to a background system of bodies that, according to the preceding methods, have been established already as not in a state of rotation, as an example from Newton's time, the fixed stars.|$|R
40|$|A {{solar sail}} concept has been {{developed}} from a common spiral fold pattern in order to enable a simultaneous mast and sail deployment.

Deployment of the solar sail system is actuated by rotating the central drum around which the masts, spars, and film are wrapped. <b>Tensioned</b> radial <b>cords</b> deterministically unfold the membrane film under the authority of the resilient, spring-like spar members.

40|$|Results from an {{experimental}} study on rayon and nylon tire cords embedded in rubber are reported.

This safety record is attributable to bungee operators rigorously conforming to standards and guidelines governing jumps, such as double checking calculations and fittings for every jump. As with any sport, injuries can still occur (see below), {{and there have been}} fatalities. A relatively common mistake in fatality cases is to use a cord that is too long. The cord should be substantially shorter than the height of the jumping platform to allow it room to stretch. When the cord becomes taut and then is stretched, the <b>tension</b> in the <b>cord</b> progressively increases. Initially the tension is less than the jumper's weight and the jumper continues to accelerate downwards.

There is {{evidence}} to support that stenosis and vertebral instability are two aspects of a process, the progressive and cyclic nature of which is not widely considered. The term "vertebral instability" is used in a non rigorous manner by exponents of highly invasive spinal surgery and arthrodesis is still considered the most effective therapy. However, attitudes may be beginning to change. We tackled the problem of vertebral lumbar stenosis/instability from a functional point of view, correlating the morphological alterations wiht the functional ones and considering them not as "excessive" but as "anomalous" movements. We assessed this condition in 26 patients by conventional methods and by biomechanical study "in vivo" with Axial-Loaded Computed Tomography (ALCT) wich enabled elementary dynamic modifications (EDMs) and complex dynamic modifications (CDMs) to be determined, revealing the biomechanical anomalies and their translation into dynamic images with a high anatomical and functional information. All patients underwnet "dynamic neutralisation" with the Dynesys(TM) system. The system controls vertebral dynamics, neutralising anomalous movements by opposing compressive forces through the elistic spacers, while <b>tension</b> in the <b>cords</b> limits elastic return, determining the resting position of the system.

Methods 15 health subjects attended the QUT podiatry clinic during December 2011. Subjects were examined and data recorded on clinical tests such as; Manual Supination Resistance (MSRT), Jack's, Lunge, Foot Posture morphology, facial <b>cord</b> <b>tension</b> and hamstrings tension tests [1 - 3]. Two dynamic force tests were then undertaken using the Zebris WinFDM-T and GAITrite walkway systems. Gait, pressure and force parameters as wells as walking speed, stance duration were all recorded. SPSS data analysis software was then used to analyse associations between clinical and outcome measures. Results Several important relationships were identified between the various clinical tests and the gait analysis data. Of significance is the potential for variables such as body weight to directly confound the finding of some kinetic test such as the MSRT. In particular, when controlling for body weight, MSRT was not found to be predictive of differences in vertical ground reaction force during the gait cycle.
