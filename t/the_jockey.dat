5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Jockey</b> Club {{decided not}} to re-run the race, {{and as a result}} it has often been called the race that never was.

5|$|Bond {{discovers that}} the ring is {{operated}} by the Spangled Mob, a ruthless American gang run by the brothers Jack and Seraffimo Spang. He follows the trail from London to New York. To earn his fee for carrying the diamonds he is instructed by a gang member, Shady Tree, to bet on a rigged horse race in nearby Saratoga. There Bond meets Felix Leiter, a former CIA agent working at Pinkertons as a private detective investigating crooked horse racing. Leiter bribes <b>the</b> <b>jockey</b> to ensure {{the failure of the}} plot to rig the race, and asks Bond to make the pay-off. When he goes to make the payment, he witnesses two homosexual thugs, Wint and Kidd, attack <b>the</b> <b>jockey.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1913, <b>the</b> <b>Jockey</b> Club and {{the owners}} of the General Stud Book passed a {{regulation}} named by the foreign press after <b>the</b> <b>Jockey</b> Club's senior steward, Lord Jersey, prohibiting the registration of horses in the book unless all of their ancestors had been registered. Despite protests from American breeders, the regulation remained in force until 1949. Among the factors influencing its relaxation were the racing success of ineligible horses in Europe and the damage caused to British and Irish breeders by the unavailability of French Thoroughbreds during and after the Second World War. In addition, by 1949 the possibly impure ancestors of the American bloodlines had receded far back in most horses' ancestry.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Jockey</b> Club ran a {{candidate}} in both parties' primary elections. In the Democratic primary Beckham defeated the Club's relatively obscure candidate, Robert T. Crowe. Flem D. Sampson, the Club's nominee in the Republican primary, won his party's nomination. In the general election Beckham could not secure the support of Democratic governor William J. Fields, who had been elected {{with the help of}} <b>the</b> <b>Jockey</b> Club. Despite the Democrats winning every other contest on the ballot, including the race for lieutenant governor, Beckham lost to Sampson by more than 32,000 votes. It was estimated that the Club spent over $500,000 to defeat him.|$|E
5|$|A {{working group}} {{produced}} a 34-page report with recommendations following the official inquiry, which {{was approved by}} <b>the</b> <b>Jockey</b> Club. Considerable public discussion had arisen over the possibility of introducing electronic devices, such as horns or flashing lights, to provide a fail-safe starting and recall system. The use of modern technology however was dismissed {{on the basis of}} a lack of total success overseas, and being open to sabotage and technical failure.|$|E

5|$|Following {{his term}} in the Senate, Beckham resumed his legal {{practice}} in Louisville. He sought another term as governor in 1927. This time he {{had the support of}} the Louisville Courier-Journal, which had been purchased by his ally, Robert W. Bingham. He was opposed by a powerful political machine known as <b>the</b> <b>Jockey</b> Club, whose main interest was securing legislation to allow parimutuel betting at the state's horse racetracks.|$|E
5|$|Most British breeders {{thought the}} {{regulation}} necessary and welcomed it, whereas most American breeders found it insulting, {{and believed that}} it was intended merely to protect the British racehorse market. The rule did adversely affect many British breeders as well though, including even one senior member of <b>the</b> <b>Jockey</b> Club, Lord Coventry, whose successful line of racehorses was ineligible for registration. Initially there was little foreign complaint or organized opposition, probably owing to the effect of the gambling bans in the United States on the domestic horse market. The American Jockey Club did not even remark on the Jersey Act in its official publication, the Racing Calendar, and no mention of it appears in <b>the</b> <b>Jockey</b> Club's meeting minutes for 1913. Contributing to the lack of outcry was a legal ruling in New York allowing oral betting at racetracks, which led to the growth of racing in the United States; by 1920 the American breeding market had rebounded and was booming.|$|E

5|$|Although {{named the}} Jersey Act by a {{critical}} foreign press, after Lord Jersey, the new regulation {{did not have}} the force of law as it was promulgated by the registration authorities of the Thoroughbred horse, not by the United Kingdom government. Nor was it promulgated by <b>the</b> <b>Jockey</b> Club, which had no authority over registration, only over racing matters. The regulation required that any horse registered in the General Stud Book trace in every line to a horse that had already been registered in the General Stud Book, effectively excluding most American-bred Thoroughbreds.|$|E

5|$|Sampson and Congressman John M. Robsion {{organized}} a formidable Republican faction {{in the eastern}} part of Kentucky. In 1927, Sampson was a candidate for the Republican gubernatorial nomination. His opponent was Robert H. Lucas, a tax collector for the Internal Revenue Service. Lucas secured the support of Kentucky senators Frederic M. Sackett and Richard P. Ernst, while Sampson was backed by longtime supporter John M. Robsion and <b>the</b> <b>Jockey</b> Club, a coalition of leaders who supported parimutuel betting on horse races. Sampson won the primary by a margin of 39,375.|$|E

In the lieutenant governor's race, Democrat James Breathitt, Jr. defeated Sampson's running mate, E. E. Nelson, by 159 votes out of more than 700,000 cast. It was estimated that <b>the</b> <b>Jockey</b> Club spent half a million dollars to defeat Beckham and the large majority for Sampson versus the close defeat of all other Republican candidates suggested some type of fraud, although none was ever proven.|$|E
5|$|St. Gatien (1881after 1906) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse and sire.

5|$|The Democratic {{party was}} badly divided over the parimutuel betting issue {{as well as}} prohibition, and a {{severance}} tax on coal. The prohibitionist and anti-gambling faction of the Democratic Party—with the help of Louisville Courier-Journal editor Robert Worth Bingham—united to make former governor and senator J. C. W. Beckham the party's gubernatorial nominee. Following Beckham's nomination, many pro-gambling and anti-prohibition Democrats hurried to the support of Sampson. Sitting Democratic governor William J. Fields, who had been elected with help from <b>the</b> <b>Jockey</b> Club, was very passive in the campaign and refused to support Beckham.|$|E

5|$|The Democrats {{nominated}} {{former governor}} and senator J. C. W. Beckham to challenge Sampson. The primary {{issue in the}} campaign was whether to outlaw parimutuel betting at the state's racetracks. Beckham favored the ban, while Sampson opposed it. A political machine known as <b>the</b> <b>Jockey</b> Club backed Sampson, and several key Democrats bolted the party after Beckham's nomination. Sampson won the governorship by over 32,000 votes, but every other Republican on the ticket lost by small majorities. The results suggested that some carefully coordinated vote swapping had occurred to ensure Beckham's defeat, but none was ever proven.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} <b>the</b> <b>jockey</b> {{creature}} was not explored in the film, but Scott later theorized {{that it might}} have been the ship's pilot, and that the ship might have been a weapons-carrier capable of dropping alien eggs onto a planet so that the aliens could use the local lifeforms as hosts. In early versions of the script, the eggs were to be located in a separate pyramid structure which would be found later by the Nostromo crew and would contain statues and hieroglyphs depicting the alien reproductive cycle, contrasting the human, alien, and space jockey cultures. Cobb, Foss, and Giger each created concept artwork for these sequences, but they were eventually discarded due to budgetary concerns and the need to make the film shorter. Instead, the egg chamber was set inside the derelict ship and was filmed on the same set as the space-jockey scene; the entire disc piece supporting <b>the</b> <b>jockey</b> and its chair were removed and the set was re-dressed to create the egg chamber. Light effects in the egg chamber were created by lasers borrowed from English rock band The Who. The band was testing the lasers for use in their stage show on the sound-stage next door.|$|E

Sometimes they would sing further songs and carols at this point. Upon being presented with payment, the team would leave to repeat the process at another house.|$|E
