25|$|In {{the late}} 1960s and early 1970s, a new {{generation}} of low-budget film companies emerged that drew from all the different lines of exploitation as well as the sci-fi and teen themes that had been a mainstay since the 1950s. Operations such as Roger Corman's New World Pictures, Cannon Films, New Line Cinema, Film Ventures International, Fanfare Films, and Independent-International Pictures brought exploitation films to mainstream theaters around the country. The major studios' <b>top</b> <b>product</b> was continuing to inflate in running time—in 1970, the ten biggest earners averaged 140.1 minutes. The B's were keeping pace: In 1955, Corman had a producorial hand in five movies averaging 74.8 minutes, with a range between 69 and 79. He played a similar part in five films originally released in 1970, two for AIP and three for his own New World, including an Italian horror film that he purchased for around $25,000: the average length was 89.8 minutes, with a range between 86 and 94. These films could turn a tidy profit. The first New World release, the biker movie Angels Die Hard, cost $117,000 to produce. It was no Easy Rider, but its box-office take of $2 million–plus meant a 46 percent return for New World's investors.|$|E

500|$|In the {{standard}} Golden Age model, the industry's <b>top</b> <b>product,</b> the A films, premiered {{at a small}} number of select first-run houses in major cities. Double features were not the rule at these prestigious venues. As described by historian Edward Jay Epstein, [...] "During these first runs, films got their reviews, garnered publicity, and generated the word of mouth that served as the principal form of advertising." [...] Then it was off to the subsequent-run market where the double feature prevailed. At the larger local venues controlled by the majors, movies might turn over on a weekly basis. At the thousands of smaller, independent theaters, programs often changed {{two or three times a}} week. To meet the constant demand for new B product, the low end of Poverty Row turned out a stream of micro-budget movies rarely much more than sixty minutes long; these were known as [...] "quickies" [...] for their tight production schedules—as short as four days. As Brian Taves describes, [...] "Many of the poorest theaters, such as the 'grind houses' in the larger cities, screened a continuous program emphasizing action with no specific schedule, sometimes offering six quickies for a nickel in an all-night show that changed daily." [...] Many small theaters never saw a big-studio A film, getting their movies from the states rights concerns that handled almost exclusively Poverty Row product. Millions of Americans went to their local theaters as a matter of course: for an A picture, along with the trailers, or screen previews, that presaged its arrival, [...] "he new film's title on the marquee and the listings for it in the local newspaper constituted all the advertising most movies got", writes Epstein. Aside from at the theater itself, B films might not be advertised at all.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the peak}} of her career, Aunor was the <b>top</b> <b>product</b> {{endorser}} for television, print, and radio advertisements. Everybody wanted to buy everything that she endorsed. The sales of Dial bath soap, for instance, shot up after Aunor endorsed it. Originally imported from the US, Dial soap first catered the AB bracket. When it was eventually manufactured locally, it courted the CD market by making Aunor its product endorser. Aunor appeared in a television commercial of Dial soap taking a shower and singing, [...] "Aren’t you glad you used Dial?". The television commercial proved successful as sales of Dial soap went up, and the masses, which comprise the bulk of her fans, patronized Dial soap.|$|E
2500|$|In 1962 Meyers was {{appointed}} Director of Purchasing for American Motors Corporation in Detroit. He {{was promoted to}} Director of Manufacturing, Vice-President of Manufacturing, Vice-President of the Product (Engineering) Group, and Executive Vice-President. In charge of product development, Meyers introduced AMC's innovative [...] "AMC Buyer Protection Plan" [...] that included the industry's first 12-month or [...] bumper-to-bumper warranty. The number of models was reduced to remove basic, stripped versions, but the centerpiece was improved quality during the production, although Meyers said [...] "I don't claim we've magically and finally licked all {{the problems of the}} assembly line." [...] Other improvements included mechanical upgrades to increase durability and quality, as well as improved standard equipment levels. By 1973, Meyers was pushing the development of the Wankel engine for installation into an AMC car within two years, possibility of going independent of GM's rotary engineering work, but he ruled out AMC producing the new engine itself. While Meyers was AMC's <b>top</b> <b>product</b> man, he was [...] "given considerable, and justifiable, credit for pushing the AMX/3 project from inception through the design and prototype stages into testing." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the model}} that would be {{standard}} during the Golden Age, the industry's <b>top</b> <b>product,</b> its A films, would premiere at a select number of deluxe first-run metropolitan cinemas, located in U.S. cities with populations {{in the range of}} 100,000 and above. There were fewer than 500 of these downtown movie palaces; in 1934, 77 percent of them were under the control of {{one or the other of}} the leading studios, the [...] "Big Five." [...] As a whole, the first-run circuit comprised the palaces and another 900 or so houses covering North America's 400 largest municipalities. Double features, though sometimes employed, were the rule at few if any of these prestigious venues. As described by historian Edward Jay Epstein, [...] "During the first runs, films got their reviews, garnered publicity, and generated the word of mouth that served as the principal form of advertising." [...] After a film's opening run, it was off to the nabes and the hinterland, the subsequent-run market where the double feature prevailed. At the larger local venues controlled by the majors, movies might turn over on a weekly basis. At the thousands of small theaters that belonged to independent chains or were individually owned, programs often changed two or three time a week, sometimes even faster. To keep up with the constant demand for new B product, the low end of Poverty Row turned out a stream of micro-budget movies rarely much more than sixty minutes long; these were known as [...] "quickies" [...] for their tight production schedules—a week's shooting was about average, just four days was not unheard of.
