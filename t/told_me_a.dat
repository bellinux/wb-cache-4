500|$|The leading actor-manager Charles Hawtrey, {{whom the}} young Coward idolised and {{from whom he}} {{learned a great deal}} about the theatre, cast him in the children's play Where the Rainbow Ends. Coward played in the piece in 1911 and 1912 at the Garrick Theatre in London's West End. In 1912 Coward also {{appeared}} at the Savoy Theatre in An Autumn Idyll (as a dancer in the ballet) and at the London Coliseum in A Little Fowl Play, by Harold Owen, in which Hawtrey starred. Italia Conti engaged Coward to appear at the Liverpool Repertory Theatre in 1913, and in the same year he was cast as the Lost Boy Slightly in Peter Pan. He reappeared in Peter Pan the following year, and in 1915 he was again in Where the Rainbow Ends. He worked with other child actors in this period, including Hermione Gingold (whose mother threatened to turn [...] "that naughty boy" [...] out); Fabia Drake; Esmé Wynne, with whom he collaborated on his earliest plays; Alfred Willmore, later known as Micheál Mac Liammóir; and Gertrude Lawrence who, Coward wrote in his memoirs, [...] "gave me an orange and <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> few mildly dirty stories, and I loved her from then onwards." ...|$|E
500|$|Kahn {{said that}} the entire idea for the video was Brown's: [...] "It's an {{interesting}} video for me, because it's so rare that music videos ever try to achieve anything emotional. Chris just basically <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> story of what he felt this video was going to be, with his heart glowing and how he's, like, cold. It is a very personal story. But it's told in such a graphic manner that I {{fell in love with}} the idea. It's Chris' story. Period. I am the pencil that put it down on the paper." [...] When comparing the song's video to that of [...] "I Can Transform Ya", the director said, [...] "'Crawl' is my favorite one, because — gosh, I'm going to let you in on this — 'cause it's probably his most personal thing he's ever done." [...] He went on to say, [...] "I mean, everything that's happened to him in the year, I think this is going to be his big statement, in terms of what he's feeling and what he's living through right now." [...] When talking about the ideas and concepts of the video, Kahn {{said that the}} video, his first ballad with Brown, should speak for itself through the ideas that he had and the [...] "genesis" [...] of what that idea was.|$|E

2500|$|The Anglican {{establishment}} predominantly opposed Darwin. Palmerston, {{who became}} Prime Minister in June 1859, mooted Darwin's name to Queen Victoria {{as a candidate}} for the Honours List with the prospect of a knighthood. While Prince Albert supported the idea, after the publication of the Origin Queen Victoria's ecclesiastical advisers, including the Bishop of Oxford Samuel Wilberforce, dissented and the request was denied. Some Anglicans were more in favour, and Huxley reported of Kingsley that [...] "He is an excellent Darwinian to begin with, and <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> capital story of his reply to Lady Aylesbury who expressed astonishment at his favouring such a heresy – 'What can be more delightful to me Lady Aylesbury, than to know that your Ladyship & myself sprang from the same toad stool.' Whereby the frivolous old woman shut up, in doubt whether she was being chaffed or adored for her remark." ...|$|E
2500|$|Initially, {{the cast}} of the series {{performed}} a small promotional tour ("The Gleek Tour") at various Hot Topic stores in the U.S. to showcase the series' soundtrack and to meet with fans of the show. This was followed with a performance of [...] "The Star-Spangled Banner" [...] at Citizens Bank Park for the 2009 World Series. A concert tour was hinted by several cast members via Twitter {{at the beginning of}} 2010. The success of the promotional outing lead {{to the creation of the}} concert tour. The tour was officially announced via Fox on March 1, 2010 at the conclusion of the first season. Lea Michele (Rachel Berry) expressed her excitement for the tour stating, [...] "This has been such an extraordinary year for 'Glee' and I can’t think of a better way to finish up the first season than performing live on stage with the cast". Her comments were later shared by Cory Monteith (Finn Hudson) stating, [...] "This show has changed my life in so many ways. If you had <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> year ago that I’d be performing classic rock songs in concert theaters around the country, I would never have believed you. We are psyched!". The tour performed over a dozen sell-out shows in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|Most of Orthodox Judaism {{holds that}} the teachings of Kabbalah were {{transmitted}} from teacher to teacher, in a long and continuous chain, from the Biblical era until its redaction by Shimon ben Yochai. Some fully accept the claims that the Kabbalah's teachings are in essence a revelation from God to the Biblical patriarch Abraham, Moses and other ancient figures, but were never printed and made publicly available until {{the time of the}} Zohar's medieval publication. The greatest acceptance of this sequence of events is held within Haredi Judaism, especially Chasidic groups. R' Yechiel Michel Epstein (d.1908), and R' Yisrael Meir Kagan (d.1933) both believed in the authenticity of the Zohar. Rabbis Eliyahu Dessler (d.1953) and Gedaliah Nadel (d.2004) maintained that it is acceptable to believe that the Zohar was not written by Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai and that it had a late authorship."I approached Rav A [...] with some of the questions on the Zohar, and he responded to me - 'and what about nikud? Nikud is also mentioned in the Zohar {{despite the fact that it}} [...] from Geonic times!' he said. I later found this comment in the Mitpachas Seforim. I would just add that not only is nikud mentioned, but only the Tiberian Nikkud - the norm in Europe of the middle ages - is mentioned and not the Yerushalmi nikud or the Babylonian one — which was used then in the Middle East, and is still used by Yemenites today. Also the Taamay Hamikrah - the trop - are referred to in the Zohar - only by their Sefardi Names. Rav A <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> remarkable piece of testimony: 'My rebbe (this is how he generally refers to Rav E [...] ) accepted the possibility that the Zohar was written sometime in the 13th century.|$|E

2500|$|There is dispute among modern Haredim as to {{the status}} of Isaac Luria's, the Arizal's Kabbalistic teachings. While a portion of Modern Orthodox Rabbis, Dor Daim and many {{students}} of the Rambam, completely reject Arizal's Kabbalistic teachings, as well as deny that the Zohar is authoritative, or from Shimon bar Yohai, all three of these groups completely accept the existence and validity of Ma'aseh Merkavah and Ma'aseh B'resheet mysticism. Their only disagreement concerns whether the Kabbalistic teachings promulgated today are accurate representations of those esoteric teachings to which the Talmud refers. Within the Haredi Jewish community one can find both rabbis who sympathise with such a view, while not necessarily agreeing with it,(מעין אומר סימן צג עמ' עדר) available at [...] as well as rabbis who consider such a view absolute heresy.
