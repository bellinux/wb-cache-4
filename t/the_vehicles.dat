5|$|In Soviet service, <b>the</b> <b>vehicles</b> were {{allocated}} to brigades at {{a scale of}} 60 per brigade.

40|$|Abstract: Design the {{structure}} of <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> system for overturning prevention {{and set up the}} system dynamic model. Based on the Matlab/Simulink, establish the dynamic simulation system of <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> system for overturning prevention for the Chery A 3 car. Using the brake / drive integrated ESP control principle, based on the simulation model, respectively simulate and analyze the ESP control performances of <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> system and <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> system for overturning prevention on different simulation conditions. The study results indicate that when there is no ESP control or ESP control system failure, <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> system for overturning prevention can simulate the ESP control performances of <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> system effectively, <b>the</b> ESP control performances of <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> system and <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> system for overturning prevention have remarkable consistency. The theory of <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> system for overturning prevention for the ESP control performances test provides a basis for <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> stability control performance research. ...|$|R
5|$|The Finnish Defence Forces {{carried out}} a winter test for {{potential}} military vehicles in March 1958. 35candidate vehicles from the two domestic producers and various importers were driven around Finland. VAT sent four vehicles to the test, three of which were 4×4s and one was an ordinary, rear-wheel driven vehicle. During the five days' testing period, all vehicles were continuously fully loaded. For part of the journey, <b>the</b> <b>vehicles</b> had to tow an eight-ton field cannon. <b>The</b> <b>vehicles</b> were tested for off-road capabilities in even, -deep snow. One of the Vanajas was destroyed in an accident. The domestic vehicles performed well in the test; {{in some cases the}} rear-wheel driven Sisus and Vanajas outperformed the 4×4-driven foreign competitors. None of <b>the</b> <b>vehicles</b> were clearly better than the others but the result convinced the Defence Forces of the capabilities of the domestic vehicles and led to several deals for SAT and VAT.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the {{building}} was a crane for ironware handling. When the frames were taken in, they were fitted with suspension and axles, and then turned the right way up. The next parts were the engine and transmission components. The final part for lorries was a pre-assembled cabin. Conventional bus chassis were delivered with bonnet and wings, but the forward control types left the factory without any body parts. After being painted, <b>the</b> <b>vehicles</b> left the assembly hall. Finally, every vehicle was tested on a -long test run on different roads and with various loads. The bus chassis were tested in a similar way; because there was no body, the drivers only had warm clothes and driving goggles to protect them against the weather conditions. <b>The</b> <b>vehicles</b> were handed over to the customers after final adjustments.|$|E
5|$|Each {{battery-powered}} vehicle, or AGV, {{is made up}} of two platforms. Riders sit on {{the upper}} platform, which provides three degrees of freedom. A lower platform provides omnidirectional lateral movement. Unlike previous ride designs, the trackless system and the wheel and motor configurations allow movements diagonal to a rider's perspective. <b>The</b> <b>vehicles</b> use a dead reckoning system developed by Frog AGV to navigate their way through the environment, allowing a vehicle to cross another's path. Each vehicle features a built-in controller, which wirelessly communicates with a central ride-system controller. Movement commands are issued by the ride-system controller, and executed by the vehicles' controllers. A specially-designed battery and charge system allow <b>the</b> <b>vehicles</b> to be quickly charged while docked at the loading and unloading platforms.|$|E

5|$|Farmer {{was also}} criticized for his {{management}} of the agriculture department's vehicle fleet. Late in his first term, Farmer had removed <b>the</b> <b>vehicles</b> used by the Agriculture Department from the state fleet, opting to have department officials manage them separately. In 2010, the Bluegrass Institute for Public Policy Solutions, a free market think tank, criticized the department's management of <b>the</b> <b>vehicles</b> under its control, citing {{the frequency with which}} the department's vehicles were being replaced. The Lexington Herald-Leader noted in 2010 that the department's fleet had grown from 178 to 206 vehicles since 2007 while the state's fleet had shrunk by 5%, and that all but three of the department's vehicles were fewer than four years old. A department spokesman defended the moves, citing decreased maintenance costs and higher resale values of vehicles being replaced. The Lexington Herald-Leader noted that such incidents could undermine Williams and Farmer's traditional Republican message of the need for less government spending.|$|E

5|$|Heat {{levels on}} the speeder must be monitored, as {{although}} there are no set top speeds for <b>the</b> <b>vehicles,</b> they can explode if allowed to overheat.

Designated cooling strips along the track and the Ice power-up can cool the vehicle without a speed penalty, allowing the player to continue accelerating.|$|E

5000|$|Essentially, these rockets {{would place}} <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> onto an [...] {{intercontinental}} ballistic missile-like trajectory and then fall away. When <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> reentered <b>the</b> atmosphere, instead of fully reentering, bleeding off its speed and landing, <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> would use <b>the</b> lift from its wings to redirect its glide angle upward while bleeding off speed in the process. In this way, <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> would be [...] "bounced" [...] back into space again. This skip-glide method would repeat until the speed was low {{enough that the}} pilot of <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> would need to pick a landing spot and glide <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> to a landing. This use of hypersonic atmospheric lift meant that <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> could greatly extend its range over a ballistic trajectory using the same engines.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a cost effective mini autonomous underwater <b>vehicle.</b> <b>The</b> mini size of <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> is achieved by extracting the control module hardware out from <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> vessel and by reducing the on-board sensors. The control of <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> is conducted by a base station wirelessly telecommunicating with <b>the</b> <b>vehicle.</b> Furthermore, <b>the</b> reduction of the sensors also reduces the cost of <b>the</b> <b>vehicle.</b> For <b>the</b> purpose, in <b>the</b> <b>vehicle,</b> a single sensor featuring a CCD camera is mounted at the front of <b>the</b> <b>vehicle.</b> <b>The</b> images taken by this CCD camera are used both for obstacle avoidance and for underwater object searching. Experimen-tal results show that <b>the</b> developed <b>vehicle</b> can successfully avoid the frontal obstacle while the operator in the base station can see the frontal view of <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> simultaneously. However, relative param-eters of the image processing algorithm must vary for different time of the day and different whether. This implies that an adaptive image processing algorithm is necessary for operation in different situations...|$|R
