50|$|QMCF Technology is an episomal protein {{production}} system that uses genetically modified mammalian cells and specially designed plasmids. QMCF plasmids carry {{a combination of}} regulatory sequences from mouse polyomavirus (Py) DNA replication origin which in combination with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) EBNA-1 protein binding site as nuclear retention elements ensure stable propagation of plasmids in mammalian cells. In addition the vetors carry the selection marker operational for selection of plasmid carrying bacteria and QMCF cells, bacterial ColE1 origin of replication, and cassette for expression of protein of interest. QMCF cell lines express Large-T antigen and EBNA-1 proteins which bind the viral sequences on the QMCF plasmid and hence support plasmid replication and maintenance in the cells. QMCF Technology has several important differences compared to commonly known <b>transient</b> <b>expression</b> and stable cell line expression systems. Unlike in <b>transient</b> <b>expression</b> system, QMCF Technology enables to maintain episomally replicating QMCF plasmids inside the cells for up to 50 days thus providing an option for production phase of 2-3 weeks. Therefore, the production levels of QMCF Technology are higher (up to 1g/L). Another difference is the option of establishing expression cell banks within one week, which is not feasible with transient system. Compared to usage of stable cell line, QMCF technology is a rapid method leaving out time-consuming clone selection step during cell line development.|$|E

40|$|Current {{recombinant}} protein production systems require {{several months to}} develop. Existing systems fail to provide timely, flexible, and cost-effective therapies to protect against emergency mass-casualty infections or poisonings. As the identity of many new biological threat agents {{are unlikely to be}} known in advance, pre-emptive manufacturing and stockpiling of countermeasures cannot be performed. Preparedness for a biological catastrophe requires a radical solution to replace the current slow scale-up and manufacture of lifesaving medical countermeasures. Subunit vaccines and antibody fragments may be produced in bacteria, yeast, plant or insect cells. However, generation of full-length, human like glycosylated antibodies requires mammalian cell culture due to the cell’s ability to carry out complex assembly and processing. Although commercial cell culture methods for antibody production from stable gene expression have been substantially improved over the last 30 years, the time required to achieve full scale production for a new product is too long for a rapid, emergency response. An alternative method for rapid production of high quality antibody protein is <b>transient</b> gene <b>expression.</b> <b>Transient</b> gene <b>expression</b> is an established, routine approach to small scale, researchgrade material of {{recombinant protein}}s. It is frequently used to generate gram quantities of material within weeks of lead target identification. In the past, <b>transient</b> gene <b>expression</b> has been considered for emergency production of large production of antibodies, but dismissed due to low titers, high DNA requirements, uncertain regulations, unavailable manufacturing capacity, and uncertain scale-up performance. If these barriers can be overcome in the next few years, emergency use of <b>transient</b> gene <b>expression</b> for production of life saving medical countermeasures would be a viable means to help protect our nation from biological attacks. The goal of this thesis is to investigate both the technical and operational feasibility of scaling up <b>transient</b> gene <b>expression.</b> In order to investigate the technical feasibility of such a method, a phenomenological understanding of transfection was developed for process characterization, process optimization and scale-up studies. Experiments in shaker flasks and lab-scale bioreactors interrogated a number of factors involved in the transfection process and identified an optimal design space for performing transfections (Chapters 2 and 3). Important factors that were identified include cell/DNA/PEI ratio, transfection incubation time, and agitation set points. Through this optimization process, the highest reported titer (3 ̆e 300 mg/L) in transient CHO production was achieved. Experimental transfections also provided calibration metrics for phenomenological models of mass transfer in very large bioreactors. These models were used to investigate the potential of mass transfer limitations upon scale-up (Chapter 2). The results indicate that, with appropriate design of the agitation systems, including consideration of the impact of mass transfer of PEI/DNA complexes from the medium to the cells during the transfection stage, scale-up should be successful. In the final stage of experimentation, successful identification of scalable systems for aseptic liquid-cell separation eliminated other potential bottlenecks that may be encountered during scale-up (Chapter 3). A novel combination of existing technology generated simplified transfection protocols, which may be commercialized for alternative markets. Operational feasibility was investigated through a survey of current manufacturing capacity for mammalian cell culture and their capabilities to provide meaningful emergency production of antibody countermeasures. Process simulation was conducted to analyze process flow, plant design, and cost for large scale production of both plasmid DNA (Chapter 5), a sub-component of <b>transient</b> gene <b>expression,</b> as well as antibody protein (Chapter 4). Simulations predicted that a 1, 000 -L fermentor would produce sufficient plasmid DNA at a cost of approximately 377 /gram. This DNA could be utilized in a 200, 000 -L facility to produce between 32 and 1, 274 kg of recombinant antibody. Experimentally validated transfection processes were then used to refine simulations. Subsequent simulation resulted in production of 197 kg within 3 months at a cost of 705 /gram mAb. These simulations predict that largescale <b>transient</b> gene <b>expression</b> can provide sufficient lifesaving countermeasures if titer improvements are possible and can be successfully scaled to large bioreactors. This thesis demonstrates both the operational and technical feasibility of a successful large-scale <b>transient</b> gene <b>expression</b> platform for the production of full-length, human-like glycosylated antibodies as medical countermeasures for biological catastrophe. This approach is one critical component of our Nation’s arsenal of bio-defense capabilities...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Plant cell {{suspensions}} and hairy root cultures represent scalable protein expression platforms. Low {{protein product}} titers {{have thus far}} limited the application of <b>transient</b> protein <b>expression</b> in these hosts. The objective of this work was to overcome this limitation by harnessing A. tumefaciens to deliver replicating and non-replicating RNA viral vectors in plant tissue co-cultures. Results Replicating vectors derived from Potato virus X (PVX) and Tobacco rattle virus (TRV) were modified to contain the reporter gene β-glucuronidase (GUS) with a plant intron to prevent bacterial expression. In cell suspensions, a minimal PVX vector retaining only the viral RNA polymerase gene yielded 6. 6 -fold more GUS than an analogous full-length PVX vector. Transient co-expression of the minimal PVX vector with P 19 of Tomato bushy stunt virus or HC-Pro of Tobacco etch virus to suppress post-transcriptional gene silencing increased GUS expression by 44 and 83 %, respectively. A non-replicating vector containing a leader sequence from Cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV- HT) modified for enhanced translation led to 70 % higher <b>transient</b> GUS <b>expression</b> than a control treatment. In hairy roots, a TRV vector capable of systemic movement increased GUS accumulation by 150 -fold relative to the analogous PVX vector. Histochemical staining for GUS in TRV-infected hairy roots revealed the capacity for achieving even higher productivity per unit biomass. Conclusions For the first time, replicating PVX vectors and a non-replicating CPMV- HT vector were successfully applied toward <b>transient</b> heterologous protein <b>expression</b> in cell suspensions.

As a result, cultivars YC- 1 and YC- 2 were screened, which had the highest <b>transient</b> GUS <b>expression</b> percentage and shoot induction frequency.

It has been demonstrated that CDX proteins suppress cardiac differentiation in both zebrafish and mouse embryonic stem cells, but the overall mechanism for how this happens is poorly understood. However, CDX1 has been shown to be transiently expressed in the embryonic heart 11.5 days post coitum (dpc). This <b>transient</b> <b>expression</b> is thought to induce epicardial epithelial-to-mesynchemal transition and thus proper cardiovascular formation. It has been shown that low-dose CDX1 induction caused enhanced migration and differentiation of epicardium-derived cells into vascular smooth muscle, where as continued high dose induction of CDX1 or CDX1 deficiency diminished the ability of these cells to migrate and differentiate into smooth muscle by the actions of TGF-β1. Furthermore, CDX1 induction also altered transcript expression of genes related to cell adhesions for EMT and angiogenesis. Therefore, along with its known roles in intestinal patterning and differentiation, CDX1 is also shown to be important in epicardial development.|$|E

The role of QSulf1 was determined in quail cartilage development and joint formation because of its association with chondrogenic growth factor signaling (Wnt and BMP). Sulf1 was expressed highly in condensing mesenchyme and, in cell culture, caused prechondrocytes to differentiate into chondrocytes, indicating QSulf1 is needed for early chondrogenesis. QSulf1 displayed perichondrial staining during early development but was downregulated during later stages of development. [...] In addition, QSulf1 shows <b>transient</b> <b>expression</b> in the early joint line followed by its rapid loss of expression in later stages of joint development, suggesting it would have an inhibitory effect in later joint development. [...] Because Sulfs were important in normal chondrogenesis, they were investigated in cartilage diseases. Expression patterns of Sulf1 and Sulf2 were determined in normal and osteoarthritic (AO) cartilage. Both Sulf1 and Sulf2 showed enhanced expression in OA and aging cartilage. Given several HSPGs (perlecan, syndecan 1/3, glypican) are upregulated and growth factor signaling through FGF-2, Wnt, BMP, and Noggin are modulated in OA, Sulfs and the modifications of HS may mediate an entirely new level of control over OA development.|$|E

Heterologous expression of EBOV-and MARV-specific sequences fused to a reporter gene suggest that ZAP specifically targets L gene sequences. The activity of NZAP-Zeo in this assay was also dependent on the integrity of the second and fourth zinc finger motif. Time-course experiments with infectious EBOV showed that ZAP reduces the level of L mRNA before the level of genomic or anti genomic RNA is affected. <b>Transient</b> <b>expression</b> of ZAP decreased the activity of an EBOV replicon system by up to 95%.
