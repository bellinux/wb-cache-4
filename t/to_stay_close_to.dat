5|$|Alexios had {{anticipated}} {{help in the}} form of mercenary forces from the West, and was totally unprepared for the immense and undisciplined hosts which soon arrived, to his consternation and embarrassment. The first group, under Peter the Hermit, he sent to Asia Minor, ordering them <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the coast and await reinforcements. However, the unruly crusaders refused to listen and began looting and pillaging the local Christian inhabitants. As they marched on Nicaea in 1096, they were caught by the Turks and massacred almost to the man.|$|E
5|$|The Field Spaniel {{can be a}} {{good family}} dog while it has a job to do. They are {{suitable}} for dog agility and hunting. Without some sort of purpose, the dog can often try to amuse itself and cause mischief. However, they are patient with children and like <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> their family. When socialised, they are good with other dogs. They are generally docile and independent, and are not as excitable as Cocker Spaniels. Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs lists the breed as being above average in working intelligence.|$|E
5|$|The recent {{incidents}} lead U.S. government agent Kent Mansley to town. He discovers {{evidence of}} Hogarth's involvement and rents {{a room in}} their house <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the boy. Hogarth ditches Kent long enough to move the Giant to a junkyard owned by beatnik artist Dean McCoppin, where {{they are able to}} pretend the Giant is one of Dean's scrap metal sculptures. Nevertheless, the easily spooked Kent issues orders for the military, led by General Shannon Rogard, to move into town.|$|E
25|$|Mike Trout's first rehab {{assignment}} of his career, in July 2017, {{was with the}} Inland Empire 66ers of San Bernardino, California, the Class A-Advanced affiliate of the Los Angeles Angels.

5|$|Early in the {{development}} of Dick Tracy, Beatty decided to make the film using a palette limited to just seven colors, primarily red, green, blue and yellow—to evoke the film's comic strip origins; furthermore each of the colors was to be exactly the same shade. Beatty's design team included production designer Richard Sylbert, set decorator Rick Simpson, cinematographer Vittorio Storaro (whom Beatty had worked with on his previous film, Ishtar, as producer and lead actor), visual effects supervisors Michael Lloyd and Harrison Ellenshaw, prosthetic makeup designers John Caglione, Jr. and Doug Drexler, and costume designer Milena Canonero. Their main intention was <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> Chester Gould's original drawings from the 1930s. Other influences came from the Art Deco movement and German Expressionism.|$|E
5|$|Sue tells Will's wife Terri Schuester (Jessalyn Gilsig) that {{guidance}} counselor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays) has romantic feelings for Will. Determined <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> her husband, Terri takes {{a job as}} the school nurse, despite having no medical qualifications. She encourages Emma's boyfriend, football coach Ken Tanaka (Patrick Gallagher) to propose to her, which he does. After asking Will {{if there is any}} reason she should not marry Ken, and being warned off Will by Terri, Emma accepts his proposal. Terri is still hiding the fact she experienced a hysterical pregnancy from Will, and upon realizing how much her life is changing due to her pregnancy, Quinn agrees to let Terri secretly adopt her baby.|$|E
5|$|The three Eubalaena species inhabit three {{distinct}} {{areas of the}} globe: the North Atlantic in the western Atlantic Ocean, the North Pacific in a band from Japan to Alaska and {{all areas of the}} Southern Ocean. The whales can only cope with the moderate temperatures found between 20 and 60 degrees in latitude. The warm equatorial waters form a barrier that prevents mixing between the northern and southern groups with minor exclusions. Although the southern species in particular must travel across open ocean to reach its feeding grounds, the species is not considered to be pelagic. In general, they prefer <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> peninsulas and bays and on continental shelves, as these areas offer greater shelter and an abundance of their preferred foods.|$|E
50|$|Ideological realism {{is also a}} {{name for}} a {{literary}} current that reached its zenith in the 19th century. It was very much like realism, but ideological realism tried to deliver an ideological message to the reader, in addition <b>to</b> <b>staying</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> reality. Famous writers that {{can be described as}} ideological realists include Charles Dickens and Dutch poet Jacob Cats.|$|R

5|$|Extra-pair {{copulation}} with neighbouring birds {{has been}} recorded and may be a reason for adult males <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the female {{before and during the}} egg laying period. Females may sometimes associate with two males and all three help in raising the brood. The typical clutch consists of two eggs which are incubated in turns by both parents. The eggs are brick red with the broad end covered more densely with blotches of red, brown, and black. The parents begin incubating soon after the first egg is laid leading to asynchronous hatching. The first egg hatches after about 42 days. The second chick may hatch three to five days later and a longer delay increases the likelihood that it will die of starvation. In cliffs where the nests are located close to each other, young birds have been known to clamber over to neighbouring nests to obtain food. In the Spanish population, young fledge and leave the nest after 90 to 110 days. Fledged birds continue to remain dependent on their parents for at least a month.|$|E
5|$|Juveniles {{have lower}} {{foraging}} efficiency compared to adults {{and in most}} feeding flocks, the juveniles are usually outnumbered by the adults. They usually tend <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> one another and forage for food together at the peripheral region of the group. During the breeding season, adult male ibises have been recorded raiding other parent ibises who are feeding their young in the colony. The raiders force their bill down the throat of the victim—either the parent about to disgorge their food or recently fed young—and extract the ball of food. This behavior allows the otherwise starving adult males to obtain food without having to spend {{long periods of time}} away from the nest, and prevent its female mate copulating with another male ibis, which would reduce its own reproductive success. Females and juveniles almost never try to drive off the larger and more aggressive pirating males, but instead try to avoid or move away from them. This pirating behavior is less common between two male ibises as the males will actively fight off the pirate. The explanation of the species' sexual dimorphism of body size is unclear, because no differences between the sexes in feeding success rates or the foraging behavior have been observed and, as males are larger, they need more food than females.|$|E

25|$|The Métis had <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the bison, {{which meant}} {{they were to}} move west of Red River.

In the 1860s, living conditions, including crop conditions, were so severe that the Hudson's Bay Company had to step in to help avoid starvation.|$|E
25|$|The single-lens microscopes of van Leeuwenhoek were {{relatively}} small devices, the largest being about 5cm long.

25|$|In California, Spanish {{settlement}} {{began in}} 1769 {{with the establishment}} of the Presidio and Catholic mission of San Diego. 20 more missions were established along the California coast by 1823, along with military Presidios and civilian communities. Settlers in California tended <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the coast and outside of the California interior. The California economy was based on agriculture and livestock. In contrast to central New Spain, coastal colonists found little mineral wealth. Some became farmers or ranchers, working for themselves on their own land or for other colonists. Government officials, priests, soldiers, and artisans settled in towns, missions, and presidios.|$|E

25|$|Hostilities {{commenced}} on 24 July. Tryon was of {{the view}} {{at the outset that}} there was little he could do directly against the superior force, so he set about attempting to wear down his enemy, using feints and false alarms to reduce their attentiveness.

This tour of duty with the Life Saving Service would be of valuable experience later in his career when the USLSS merged with the Revenue Cutter Service to form the United States Coast Guard.|$|E
25|$|If the Axis garrisons at the {{frontier}} tried to retreat, the New Zealanders {{and the rest}} of XIII Corps were to cut them off or closely pursue them if they escaped. To protect the western flank of XIII Corps, the 4th Armoured Brigade Group had been detached from XXX Corps but remained under command, ready to intervene in support of either corps. At a conference on 6 October, Freyberg insisted that the New Zealand Division should not engage Axis armoured units without British tanks under command, unless the opposing tanks forces had already been defeated. If the brigade group was called on by both corps, Freyberg wanted priority but this was refused, although the brigade group was still ordered <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> XIII Corps on {{the frontier}}, a compromise much to the dismay of Godwin-Austen and Freyberg in XIII Corps and the armoured commanders in XXX Corps, who wanted to keep their tanks concentrated.|$|E

During her undergraduate years she {{was considered a}} devoted friend and engaged in theatre, becoming an excellent singer. This showed in her election to the soloist position at Ann Arbor's local Episcopal Church. However, her educational experience was marred by an overseas battle; World War I broke out during her time at Michigan.
