40|$|The {{fatigue crack}} {{initiation}} and propagation characteristics of Friction Stir Welds (FSW) and 13 mm gauge 2024 -T 351 A 1 alloy have been studied. Two failure locations have been identified: outside <b>the</b> weld <b>nugget</b> region and over <b>the</b> <b>nugget</b> region. <b>The</b> {{study shows that}} when failure occurs outside <b>the</b> <b>nugget,</b> fatigue crack growth is essentially conventional (mode I dominated), with initiation from S-phase particles. For failures over <b>the</b> <b>nugget</b> region initiations were linked to coarse intermetallics associated with macroscopic discontinuities in the weld flow pattern; with subsequent crack growth being seen to follow {{the curve of the}} banded structure within <b>the</b> weld <b>nuggets</b> region. A variety of microstructural and micromechanical contributions to fatigue failure have been identified, including the roles of local matrix ageing characteristics, intermetallic particle size and distributions, local flow stress characteristics and the residual stress distributions. The effect of varying the welding parameters has also been studied in partial penetration 25 mm gauge 2024 -T 351 Al alloy. Again, two failure locations have been identified: outside <b>the</b> weld <b>nugget</b> region and over <b>the</b> <b>nugget</b> region. Outside <b>the</b> <b>nugget</b> exhibited essentially conventional (mode I dominated) crack growth, with initiation occurring at S-phase particles. Failure over <b>the</b> <b>nugget</b> only occurred in samples from the slower of the two welding speeds, initiation was identified with linear defects at, or just below, the surface. Again a variety of microstructural and micromechanical facts were identified as having an influence on the subsequent growth, in particular the marked deflection from a conventional mode I path. The failure location however did not appear to significantly alter fatigue lives. <br/...|$|R

40|$|Resistance {{spot welds}} were {{prepared}} on 3. mm thick sheets of continuous cast and rolled AZ 31 magnesium alloy. The microstructure and composition analysis of weld nugget, {{heat affected zone}} (HAZ) and base metal were examined using optical and scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM and EDS/X). The resistance spot welded magnesium alloy joints consist mainly of weld <b>nugget</b> and HAZ. <b>The</b> <b>nugget</b> contains two different structures, i. e. the cellular-dendritic structure {{at the edge of}} <b>the</b> <b>nugget</b> and <b>the</b> equiaxed dendritic structure in the centre of <b>the</b> <b>nugget.</b> <b>The</b> structure transition is attributed to the changes of solidification conditions. In the HAZ, grain boundary melting occurred and grain boundaries became coarse.

Prior to his second season, head coach Brian Shaw {{described}} Miller {{as if he has}} the potential to be comparable to Paul George. Once the season began, Miller's second year salary became fully guaranteed. On December 27, 2013, Miller scored a career-high 9 points against the New Orleans Pelicans. With Wilson Chandler suffering from a groin injury, Miller made his first NBA career start on January 9, 2014 against the Oklahoma City Thunder with Kevin Durant as his defensive assignment. The game was nationally televised. Miller matched his career high with 9 points, while Durant scored 30, but Denver won 10188. In his second start in the following game against Orlando on January 11, Miller achieved his first NBA double double with career highs of 16 points and 11 rebounds. Miller again served in the starting lineup on February 10 but this time in the backcourt when point guard Ty Lawson was injured and starting shooting guard Randy Foye shifted over to replace him. In late March, when Wilson Chandler missed several games, Miller moved into the starting lineup. On April 6, Miller, who was still starting in place of Chandler, scored a career-high 19 points in an overtime contest against Houston.|$|E
5|$|Some bootlegs {{consist of}} private or {{professional}} studio recordings distributed without the artist's involvement, including demos, works-in-progress or discarded material. These {{might be made}} from private recordings {{not meant to be}} widely shared, or from master recordings stolen or copied from an artist's home, a recording studio or the offices of a record label, or they may be copied from promotional material issued to music publishers or radio stations, but not for commercial release. A theme of early rock bootlegs was to copy deleted records, such as old singles and B-sides, onto a single LP, as a cheaper alternative to obtaining all the original recordings. Strictly speaking, these were unlicensed recordings, but because the work required to clear all the copyrights and publishing of every track for an official release was considered to be prohibitively expensive, the bootlegs became popular. Some bootlegs, however, did lead to official releases. The Who's Zoo bootleg, collecting early singles of The Who, inspired the official album Odds And Sods, which beat the bootleggers by issuing unreleased material, while various compilations of mid-1960s bands inspired <b>the</b> <b>Nuggets</b> series of albums.|$|E
5|$|The Egyptians worked {{deposits}} {{of the lead}} ore galena at Gebel Rosas to make net sinkers, plumb bobs, and small figurines.

Iron deposits found in upper Egypt were utilized in the Late Period. High-quality building stones were abundant in Egypt; the ancient Egyptians quarried limestone all along the Nile valley, granite from Aswan, and basalt and sandstone from the wadis of the eastern desert. Deposits of decorative stones such as porphyry, greywacke, alabaster, and carnelian dotted the eastern desert and were collected even before the First Dynasty.

5|$|The highest-scoring {{regular season}} game in {{regulation}} {{was between the}} Golden State Warriors and the Denver Nuggets on November 2, 1990. In that game, Golden State defeated Denver 162–158. The Warriors' Chris Mullin scored a game-high 38 points. <b>The</b> <b>Nuggets</b> were coached by Doug Moe from 1980 to 1990 and Paul Westhead from 1990 to 1992, both of whom employed a run and gun offensive strategy, which focuses on attempting {{a high number of}} field goals while also conceding a large number of points on defense. In fact, Moe's and Westhead's Nuggets were participants in five of the ten highest-scoring regular season games in NBA history. The Warriors were coached by Don Nelson from 1988 to 1995 and 2006 to 2010. He employed Nellie Ball, a style of run and gun that uses smaller, more athletic players to outrun opponents. Another notable high scoring regular season game is a March 2, 1962 game between the Philadelphia Warriors and the New York Knicks. In that game, the Warriors' Wilt Chamberlain scored an NBA-record 100 points.|$|E
5|$|Though usually {{opposing}} {{each other}} in their reporting of events, reporting by both the Epitaph and the Nugget initially supported the lawmen's version of events. Woods, the publisher of the pro-Cowboy Nugget, was out of town during the hearings, and an experienced reporter, Richard Rule, wrote the story. The Nugget staff had a close relationship with Sheriff Behan, but Rule's story, as printed in the Nugget the day after the shootout, backed up the Earps' version of events. This varied widely from Behan's and the Cowboys' later court testimony. Subsequent stories about the gunfight published in the Nugget after that day supported Behan's and the Cowboys' view of events. Other stories in the Epitaph countered <b>the</b> <b>Nuggets</b> later view entirely and supported the lawmen.
