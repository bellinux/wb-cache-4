5|$|Forecasts of {{hurricane}} activity are issued before each hurricane season by Dr. William M. Gray {{and his associates}} at Colorado State University (CSU) and the Weather Research Center (WRC). A normal season {{as defined by the}} National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has 12.1 named storms, of which 6.4 reach hurricane strength, and 2.7 become major hurricanes. In December 1991, CSU issued its first forecast for the year and predicted that 1992 would see eight named storms, four hurricanes, and one major hurricane. CSU also issued a forecast in April, June and August, however no revisions were made <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> of named storms, hurricanes, and major hurricane predicted in 1992.|$|E
5|$|What this {{effectively}} did was {{shift the}} bombing campaign southwestward to the Ho Chi Minh Trail. The interdiction {{campaign against the}} enemy logistics corridor was massively expanded due to the increased number of U.S. aircraft (approximately 500 planes) made available by the closure of Rolling Thunder. By November 1968 bombing missions over southern Laos had climbed by 300 percent, from 4,700 sorties in October to 12,800 in November. By {{the end of the}} conflict, U.S. and South Vietnamese aircraft would drop over three million tons of ordnance on Laos, three times the total tonnage dropped on North Vietnam. The new campaign against the trail was unprecedented, and not just due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> sorties flown or munitions expended. The U.S. was going to field its latest technology in its attempt to prevent the North Vietnamese from toppling the South Vietnamese government.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} {{recorded}} fake or counterfeit gold sovereigns in circulation, {{although they are}} still relatively scarce in comparison <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> of genuine coins, due {{to the difficulty of}} accurately replicating such a small coin economically.

Such fakes present a potential problem only to the numismatic collector, as they still have standard bullion content.|$|E
25|$|In music theory, {{the just}} {{intonation}} of the diatonic scale involves regular numbers: the pitches {{in a single}} octave of this scale have frequencies proportional <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> in the sequence 24, 27, 30, 32, 36, 40, 45, 48 of nearly consecutive regular numbers. Thus, for an instrument with this tuning, all pitches are regular-number harmonics of a single fundamental frequency. This scale is called a 5-limit tuning, meaning that the interval between any two pitches {{can be described as}} a product 2i3j5k of powers of the prime numbers up to 5, or equivalently as a ratio of regular numbers.|$|E

25|$|The {{origin of}} the event is unclear, however it is {{unlikely}} to be before 1800. By the early 20th century the tradition had died out due to the railways, as the local population travelled further for their annual break during the Saddleworth Wakes week. However The Rushcart was revived in 1975 by the newly formed Saddleworth Morris Men following research by Fred Broadbent and Peter Ashworth, who were able to still hear the stories of the Rushcart from the older members of the community. The audience at the time was small, which is in stark contrast <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> that gather now.|$|E

The away jersey was white with orange striping, an orange number on the back and white sleeve numbers. Other than a few minor alterations <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> and the switch the NHL made to wear white at home and dark on the road for 1970–71, this general design was used {{until the end of the}} 1981–82 season.|$|E

Although the army has had a rough military history, a portion of its forces, which were known as the national guard, became integrated with {{what is now the}} National Police of Nicaragua. In essence, the police became a gendarmerie. The National Police of Nicaragua are rarely, if ever, labeled as a gendarmerie. The other elements and manpower that were not devoted to the national police were sent over to cultivate the new Army of Nicaragua.|$|E
25|$|On {{this last}} point, Grayling's {{view is that}} for {{historical}} reasons religions have an inflated place {{in the public domain}} out of all proportion <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> of their adherents or their intrinsic merits, so that their voice and influence is amplified disproportionately: with the result that they can distort such matters as public policy (e.g. on abortion) and science research and education (e.g. stem cells, teaching of evolution). He argues that winning the metaphysical and ethical debates is already abating the problems associated with (c) in more advanced Western societies, even the US. He sees his own major contribution as being the promotion of understanding of humanist ethics deriving from the philosophical tradition.|$|E
25|$|It can be {{inferred}} from the report of Aristoxenus about Plato's lecture 'On the Good,' that {{a discussion of the}} nature of numbers occupied an important part of Plato's argument.

Plato distinguished between the numbers used in mathematics and the metaphysical Forms of numbers. In contrast <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> used in mathematics, the Forms of numbers do not consist of groups of units and so cannot be added together or subjected to the ordinary operations of arithmetic. The Form of Twoness, for example, does not consist of two units designated by the number 2 but rather the real essence of twoness.|$|E
