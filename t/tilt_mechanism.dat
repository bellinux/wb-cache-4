25|$|Acela {{service was}} {{originally}} {{expected to begin}} in late 1999 but was delayed. The catenary system could not support the intended speeds between Washington DC and New York City, but the newer system between New York City and Boston allows the higher speeds. Attention {{was drawn to the}} decreased 4.2° tilt, but this was not the root of the speed problem, as the tracks from New York to Boston are similar to those between New York and Washington, and the <b>tilt</b> <b>mechanism</b> is not the factor enabling higher speeds. Following repairs, the first Acela service began on December 11, 2000, a year behind schedule.|$|E
30|$|<b>Tilting</b> <b>mechanism</b> The {{purpose of}} the <b>tilting</b> <b>mechanism</b> is to {{increase}} the number of DOFs of the calibration board. It allows calibration trajectories to be in three-dimensional space. Figure  2 c, d shows the <b>tilting</b> <b>mechanism.</b> To increase the number of DOFs while retaining sufficient stiffness of the calibration table, a 3 -DOF ball joint with high stiffness was used in the <b>tilting</b> <b>mechanism.</b> The calibration board can tilt in roll and pitch directions. A wing nut on the ball joint slider is used to fix the ball joint slider and aluminum extrusion (see Fig.  2 c, d). Therefore, the calibration broad rotates in roll and pitch direction via the <b>tilting</b> <b>mechanism.</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} the FEM {{analysis}} of manually operated <b>tilting</b> <b>mechanism</b> of three furrows reversible plough is presented. Plough is important agricultural equipment used for soil preparation. The mainobjective {{of this analysis}} was to optimize the design of <b>tilting</b> <b>mechanism.</b> The existing <b>tilting</b> <b>mechanism</b> which is manufactured by local small scale manufacturer gets failed at different points afterapproximately 150 Hr of uses. To analyze this <b>tilting</b> <b>mechanism</b> using FEM, firstly a proper CAD model is developed using Pro/E cad software. Then by using ANSYs software FEM analysis is done to determine the von Mises stresses.

50|$|The first {{consideration}} {{was whether}} or not a suitable <b>tilting</b> <b>mechanism</b> could be built into the bogies that would not require extra space or project into the car. Dofasco, a major steel manufacturer in Hamilton, won the majority of the bogie development contracts. They developed a system that consisted of two parts, a bogie and suspension on the bottom, and a separate <b>tilting</b> <b>mechanism</b> on top.|$|R

50|$|Most of the {{carriages}} {{remained in}} service after {{the withdrawal of}} the LRC locomotives, though pulled by newer locomotives, usually P42DCs and often with the <b>tilting</b> <b>mechanism</b> disabled. From 2003 onwards, Via installed wireless internet on all Corridor trains, with distinctive white domes for the satellite downlink being installed on top of the first class cars. A new capital program announced by the Canadian government in October 2007 includes funding for the refurbishment of Via's remaining LRC cars. The <b>tilting</b> <b>mechanisms</b> will be removed as part of this project.|$|R
50|$|In recent years, the <b>tilting</b> <b>mechanism</b> was deactivated, due {{the end of}} {{production}} of gyroscopic tilting controls (build by British Aerospace and as a precaution, and top speed was reduced to 200 km/h.|$|R
50|$|In the Wii {{version of}} the game, the player uses the trigger buttons of the Wii Remote and Nunchuk to {{activate}} the flippers. The machine can be bumped or shifted with the motion sensors in either the Remote or Nunchuck. The resulting motion is proportional in magnitude and identical in direction to the controller's motion. This allows skilled players to use just enough motion to perform advanced ball saves without triggering the <b>tilt</b> <b>mechanism,</b> just as can be done on a physical machine.|$|E
50|$|Unlike most view cameras, {{the shift}} {{mechanism}} allows shifts along only one axis, and the <b>tilt</b> <b>mechanism</b> allows tilts about only one axis; however, {{the rotation of}} the mechanisms allows the orientations of the axes to be changed, providing, in effect, combined tilt and swing, and combined rise/fall and lateral shift. The TS-E 17 mm 4L uses the same barrel design as the TS-E 24 mm f/3.5L II, which allows the tilt and the shift mechanisms to be rotated independently of each other.|$|E

50|$|CrossCountry's new operator, Arriva, {{does not}} run {{much on the}} WCML, and {{considers}} it not worthwhile to activate the <b>tilt</b> <b>mechanism</b> for the short stretch of the Cherwell Valley line. For this reason many SuperVoyagers have been transferred to Virgin West Coast, who can use their tilting ability on the WCML. The majority of CrossCountry services on the Cherwell Valley line are now worked by standard non-tilting Voyager trains, and any remaining tilting Voyagers have had their tilt function disabled to improve reliability and cut costs.|$|E

In addition to optical improvements, the TS-E 24 mm 3.5L II also introduces a new barrel design, allowing the tilt and the shift to be rotated independently of each other without removing screws on the lens body, as was required on the original version.|$|E
50|$|When started, {{the train}} usually {{consisted}} {{of two or three}} coaches and a food-service / custom-class car combination. Amtrak and Via alternated equipment: at first, Amtrak used diesel locomotives and Amfleet coaches, while Via used LRCs and Tempo coaches. Equipment assignments and allocations frequently changed; after the VIA equipment was sidelined due to winter conditions in 1985, only Amtrak cars were used. On August 10, 1988, Via began using nine LRC passenger cars with the <b>tilt</b> <b>mechanism</b> removed (making them compatible with Amtrak cafe cars) pulled by F40PH locomotives.|$|E

50|$|Yoshi {{can jump}} and stick out his tongue to eat fruit or enemies, {{but the main}} feature {{of the game is}} the <b>tilt</b> <b>mechanism.</b> By moving the Game Boy Advance side to side, players tilt the world around Yoshi, causing enemies to roll around, {{swinging}} ships and pendulums, and bouncing items all over the place. An impassable wall will become a climbable slope, or a rolled-up carpet will become a long platform. Each environment requires players to master not only button presses but also tilt movements to progress.|$|E
50|$|The {{design program}} was {{organised}} under Mike Newman, while Alastair Gilchrist headed the research side. Newman {{noted that a}} single car was unlikely to answer practical questions like how the train would operate as a complete unit, and that a dummy body would not {{answer the question of}} whether the <b>tilt</b> <b>mechanism</b> could really be built under the floor without projecting into the cabin. Accordingly, later that same November, Newman and Wickens drew up plans for a complete experimental train with the design goal to be not only to study the tilt system, but do so on actual lines.|$|E
50|$|The first {{tilting train}} {{to enter into}} regular service in North America was the United Aircraft TurboTrain, used by Canadian National Railways in 1968. It should be {{rightfully}} considered the first tilting train in service in the world. It assured daily service between Montreal and Toronto at speeds of 160 km/h, until it was replaced by Bombardier LRC trains in 1982. United Aircraft Turbos were also used by Amtrak between Boston and New York. The UAC Turbos had a passive <b>tilt</b> <b>mechanism</b> based on a four-bar arrangement, and they inspired the second generation of TALGO trains.|$|E
