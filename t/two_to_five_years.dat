5|$|A {{key part}} of the Recovery Plan is the {{supplementary}} feeding of females. The kakapo breeds only once every <b>two</b> <b>to</b> <b>five</b> <b>years,</b> when a certain type of plant species, primarily Dacrydium cupressinum (rimu), produces protein-rich fruit and seeds. Observations of the relationship between intermittent breeding and the plant's mast year help biologists choose which suitable supplementary foods to increase kakapo breeding frequency. In 1989, six preferred foods (apples, sweet potatoes, almonds, Brazil nuts, sunflower seeds and walnuts) were supplied ad libitum each night to 12 feeding stations. Males and females ate the supplied foods, and females nested on Little Barrier Island in the summers of 1989–91 {{for the first time since}} 1982, although nesting success was low.|$|E

5|$|While New World Cabernets are {{characterized}} as being drinkable earlier than Bordeaux, premium producers {{such as the}} Californian cult wines will produce wines that need time to age and could potentially develop {{for two to three}} decades. Overall, the majority of Californian Cabernets are meant to be approachable after only a couple of years in the bottle but can still have the potential to improve further over time. Similarly many premium Australian Cabernet will also need at least ten years to develop though many are approachable after <b>two</b> <b>to</b> <b>five</b> <b>years.</b> New Zealand wines are typically meant to be consumed young and will often maintain their green herbal flavors even with extended bottle aging. South American Cabernets have very pronounced fruit flavors when they are young and the best made examples will maintain some of those flavors as they age. South African wines tend to favor more Old World styles and typically require six to eight years' aging before they start to develop further flavors.|$|E
5|$|Despite being mostly solitary, {{sirenians}} congregate {{in groups}} while females are in estrus. These groups usually include one female with multiple males. Sirenians are K-selectors, so, despite the longevity, females give birth {{only a few}} times during their life and invest considerable parental care in their young. Dugongs generally gather in groups of less than a dozen individuals for one to two days. Since they congregate in turbid waters, little is known about their reproductive behavior. The males are often seen with scars, and the tusks on dugongs grow in first for males, suggesting they are important in lekking. They have also been known to lunge at each other. The age when a female first gives birth is disputed, ranging anywhere from six to seventeen years. The time between births is unclear, with estimates ranging from 2 to 7 years. Manatees can reach sexual maturity as early as <b>two</b> <b>to</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> of age. Manatee gestation length is around one year, and then they lactate for one to two years. West Indian manatees and African manatees can breed year-round, and a female will mate with multiple male partners. Amazonian manatees have a breeding season, usually mating when the river levels begin to rise, which varies from place to place.|$|E

40|$|Just as poverty {{analysis}} has {{a central part}} in Development Economics, studies of fertility behaviour have an equally important standing in the Demography literature. Poverty and fertility are two important aspects of welfare that are closely related. In this paper we use unique longitudinal data sources to study the relationship between poverty and fertility at household level over a <b>two</b> <b>to</b> <b>five</b> <b>year</b> period. In particular we compare the relationship between fertility and poverty in four countries: Albania, Ethiopia, Indonesia and Vietnam. These countries differ greatly in their history, average income, social structure, economic institutions and demographic features. We find {{that there is a}} substantial difference in the relative importance of the determinants of poverty dynamics and fertility; the persistence of high levels of fertility and poverty in Ethiopia is driven by lack of economic growth and poor access to family planning; education and health provision are crucial elements in reducing poverty and fertility, as is clear from Vietnam, Indonesia and Albania. ...|$|R

40|$|My {{research}} paper {{focuses on the}} first phase of a project to examine Forest School as a way of facilitating experiential learning in the outdoors in the United Kingdom. The first phase starts with a consideration of the defining characteristics of Forest School by analyzing fourteen case studies of Forest School experience, used with different age-groups in different settings across the UK. The study uses a grounded theory approach and utilizes the computer software package NVivo 8 as a coding tool. It then uses the initial codes and comparisons to facilitate discussion with the other lead practitioners in Forest School in the UK, to debate whether these are the necessary and sufficient conditions for Forest School, and to reach a co-constructed consensus national perspective. In a later phase of my research I will be exploring the transferability of these characteristics to Forest School in the early years community, typically with practitioners working with <b>two</b> <b>to</b> <b>five</b> <b>year</b> old, as this is the age group that I typically work with. ...|$|R
