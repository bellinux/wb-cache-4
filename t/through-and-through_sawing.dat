40|$|A {{simulation}} {{study has}} been performed on a small log database of tropical hardwoods consisting of 10 Jambirre (Millettia stuhlmannii Taub.) and 5 Umbila (Pterocarpus angolensis D. C.) logs. The outer log shape was acquired by a 3 D laser scanner before sawing and the heartwood content was estimated by measurement on images of the centre slabs after <b>through-and-through</b> <b>sawing.</b> Yield and value recovery using different sawing techniques and different sawing patterns, together with rotational and skew positioning errors, are presented. The results show that <b>through-and-through</b> <b>sawing</b> in the best rotation and skew positions tested improves the yield of Umbila logs {{by an average of}} 4. 5 percentage points and Jambirre logs by 3. 6 percentage points compared to cant sawing. It can be concluded that positioning and sawing patterns have a great influence on the yield and value recovery of these species and that log grade and species {{have an impact on the}} sawing pattern that should be used.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{the effect of the}} positioning of the log before sawing on the volume yield of sawn timber from tropical hardwood species. Three positioning parameters were studied, the offset, skew, and rotation, combined with two sawing patterns of cant-sawing and <b>through-and-through</b> <b>sawing.</b> A database consisting of two tropical hardwood species with very different outer shapes, jambirre (Millettia stuhllmannii Taub.) and umbila (Pterocarpus angolensis DC.), was used to simulate the sawing process. The result of the simulation revealed that, according to the combined effect of offset, skew, and rotation positioning, the positioning of the log before sawing is extremely important to achieve a high volume yield of sawn timber. The positioning parameter that has the highest effect on the volume yield is the rotation, and the variation in the volume yield associated with a deviation in the positioning can reduce the volume yield of sawn timber by between 7. 7 % and 12. 5 %.

40|$|The sawing of {{tropical}} hardwood species {{is a big}} challenge for sawmills in developing countries. In order to investigate sawing strategies and volume recovery {{of tropical}} hardwood species, a log shape database was created using a portable 3 D laser scanner. The data were collected in Mozambique, where twelve Jambirre (Millettia stuhlmannii Taub.) and five Umbila (Pterocarpus angolensis DC) logs were scanned. The logs were selected among the most commercialized species and the crook was the main selection parameter. In addition, straight logs were incorporated as reference. A saw simulation Matlab algorithm that combines skew and rotation was developed. The results show that point cloud data from the 3 D scanner provide detailed models of the external log geometry and accurately describe the log shapes and volumes. Preliminary results from breakdown simulation revealed that the <b>through-and-through</b> <b>sawing</b> pattern yields more than the cant saw pattern and {{that the increase in}} yield was almost the same for both species.

40|$|The PrimWood method. Part 1 : Properties and {{production}} of timber with vertical annual rings. Old traditions and modern measurements show that radial sawn wood is subject to smaller moisture movements in {{the plane of the}} surface and has a harder surface and better shape-stability than timber sawn by conventional sawing techniques such as square sawing and <b>through-and-through</b> <b>sawing.</b> The advantages are greater if the juvenile wood is removed. Timber with radial faces and where the juvenile wood has been removed is said to have vertical annual rings, and such timber is particularly valuable for products such as floors, furniture, panels and exterior carpentry. The special properties of the timber are then utilised in the best possible manner. The PrimWood method is a new production concept for the manufacture of high quality wood components and boards of massive wood from both softwood and hardwood. The concept leads to a knot-free material with vertical annual rings. Upprättat; 2007; 20140902 (dicsan...|$|E

Diese Vorteile nehmen zu, wenn das {{juvenile}} Holz entfernt wird. Holz, bei dem die Breitseiten radial sind und bei dem das juvenile Holz entfern wurde, hat so genannte stehende Jahresringe. Holz mit stehenden Jahresringen ist besonders wertvoll für die Herstellung von Tischlerarbeiten, Möbeln und Fußböden und Paneelen. Bei diesen Produkten werden die besonderen Eigenschaften des Holzes am Besten ausgenutzt.

40|$|The {{harvesting}} of Mozambique tropical hardwood {{species is}} considerable {{higher than the}} natural regrowth in the forest and the stock is decreasing drastically. Therefore, {{it is important to}} improve the material recovery when the wood is refined (i. e., in sawing and further refinement to products such as joineries, furniture etc.) to reduce the waste and to re-utilize efficiently the by-products to increase the added value. The wood processing industry is an important means to boost the industries in the rural areas and also to generate incomes for the local communities by creating jobs and business opportunities. The majority of the logging {{that can be used for}} sawmilling in Mozambique is exported as roundwood due to the inability of companies to meet the product standards set for export and to generate profit. The lack of capabilities of the local sawmills to generate profit, also foments the illegal logging because of the higher price of roundwood for export which contributes to increase the number of unlicensed individuals in harvesting. This threatens the law enforcement and thus the degradation of the local wood industry. An alternative to increase the profit and empower the local community could be to export more refined wood products such as sawn timber, parquet, and veneer instead of the roundwood. The objective of the work was to investigate alternative sawing strategies of tropical hardwood species that could increase the profitability of the Mozambique wood industry in general and at sawmill in particular. The subject was approached using a database of virtual logs and together with a sawing simulator. The thesis has two main focus areas: (1) creating the log database with the corresponding algorithms for sawing simulation, and (2) investigations of alternative sawing strategies. The first focus was to build the database of surface-scanned logs and develop the algorithm for the saw simulation. The results are a database of 15 logs models describing the logs outer shape in which 10 jambirre (Millettia stuhlmannii Taub.) and 5 umbila (Pterocarpus angolensis DC.), and the algorithm for the sawing simulation. The algorithm use “brute force” i. e., determines all volume yields of sawn timber from the combination of all settings of log-positioning parameters (offset, skew and rotation) and selects the maximum value of volume yield. From simulation, using three sawing patterns (cant-sawing, <b>through-and-through</b> <b>sawing</b> and square-sawing) combined with two positioning parameters (offset and rotation) it was found that the sawing pattern has great impact on volume yield and that the square-sawing gave higher yield followed by <b>through-and-through</b> <b>sawing</b> pattern. The second focus was on alternative sawing strategies; having in mind that the optimal volume yield is achieved by aid of computerized production systems and that these resources are not yet in use in Mozambique. Hence, the objective was to find the positioning parameters that can be set manually and improve the volume yield. The result have shown that the rotation is the most affecting parameter followed by offset and skew, and that the volume yield can decrease by between 7. 7 % and 12. 5 % from the optimal positioning when the logs are manually positioned with the knowledge about the optimal log position. In another study, using crook-up or horns-down positioning as alternative to the optimal positioning, the volume yield decreases by between 10 % and 13 % from the optimal positioning. By using bucked logs, the optimal volume yield increased by between 8 % and 13 % in relation to full lengths logs, and the volume yield of bucked logs when using crook up positioning decreases 2 % in relation to optimal positioning of full length logs. It is concluded that there is an unexploited value potential in the wood chain which can be reached using alternative positioning and modern measurement techniques and that the grading of wood will facilitate and improve the sawing process...|$|E
