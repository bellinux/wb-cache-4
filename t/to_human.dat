5|$|According <b>to</b> <b>Human</b> Rights Watch, Noreen's {{situation}} is not unusual. Though {{no one has been}} executed for blasphemy yet in Pakistan, the accused often remain imprisoned for an extensive amount of time while the case is being processed.

5|$|According <b>to</b> <b>Human</b> Rights Watch, the Shia {{minority}} face systematic discrimination {{from the}} Saudi government in education, {{the justice system}} and especially religious freedom.

5|$|According <b>to</b> <b>human</b> rights {{organisations such as}} Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch the {{government}} of Zimbabwe violates the rights to shelter, food, freedom of movement and residence, freedom of assembly {{and the protection of}} the law.

5|$|Demographers or sociologists of {{population}} study the size, composition and {{change over time}} of a given population. Demographers study how these characteristics impact, or are impacted by, various social, economic or political systems. The study {{of population}} is also closely related <b>to</b> <b>human</b> ecology and environmental sociology, which studies a populations relationship with the surrounding environment and often overlaps with urban or rural sociology. Researchers in this field may study the movement of populations: transportation, migrations, diaspora, etc., which falls into the subfield known as Mobilities studies and is closely related <b>to</b> <b>human</b> geography. Demographers may also study spread of disease within a given population or epidemiology.|$|E

50|$|Within {{the monkey}} {{population}} in Peninsular Malaysia, Anopheles hackeri {{is believed to}} be the main vector of P. knowlesi: although A. hackeri is capable of transmitting malaria <b>to</b> <b>humans,</b> it is not normally attracted <b>to</b> <b>humans</b> and seems unlikely to be an important vector for transmission <b>to</b> <b>humans.</b>|$|R
40|$|Background: Bisphenol A (BPA) is a {{synthetic}} compound {{used to produce}} plastics and epoxy resins.

5|$|Genes {{related to}} FLCN and {{diseases}} similar to BHD {{have been found}} in dogs, fruit flies, rats, and mice. In German Shepherd dogs, missense mutations in the canine ortholog of FLCN cause a similar phenotype <b>to</b> <b>human</b> BHD—kidney cancers (in this case, mutifocal renal cystadenocarcinoma) and skin tumors (nodular dermatofibrosis). They had a similar pattern of tumorigenesis <b>to</b> <b>human</b> BHD in that the skin lesions were heterozygous for the FLCN mutation and the renal tumors were likely caused by loss of heterozygosity. Female German shepherds with a FLCN mutation are also prone to uterine leiomyomas.|$|E

5000|$|The {{toxicity}} of L. camara <b>to</b> <b>humans</b> is undetermined, with several studies suggesting that ingesting berries can be toxic <b>to</b> <b>humans,</b> {{such as a}} study by O P Sharma which states [...] "Green unripe fruits of the plant are toxic to humans". However other studies have found evidence which suggests that ingestion of L. camara fruit poses no risk <b>to</b> <b>humans</b> and are in fact edible when ripe.|$|R
50|$|Although {{colubrid}} snakes are usually harmless <b>to</b> <b>humans,</b> Philodryas are opisthoglyphous (rear-fanged) snakes and {{can give a}} venomous bite. However, they have mild venom; so a bite is unlikely to cause lasting damage <b>to</b> <b>humans.</b>|$|R
5|$|In 1898–1899, Bastianelli, Bignami and Grassi {{were the}} first to observe the {{complete}} transmission cycle of P. falciparum, P. vivax and P. malaria from mosquito <b>to</b> <b>human</b> and back in A. claviger.|$|E

50|$|In {{environmental}} chemistry {{the term is}} in some cases virtually equivalent to pollution, where the main interest is the harm done {{on a large scale}} <b>to</b> <b>humans</b> or <b>to</b> organisms or environments that are important <b>to</b> <b>humans.</b>|$|R
50|$|CC398 or MRSA CC398 {{is a new}} {{variant of}} MRSA that has emerged in animals and is found in intensively reared {{production}} animals (primarily pigs, but also cattle and poultry), {{where it can be}} transmitted <b>to</b> <b>humans</b> as LA-MRSA (livestock-associated MRSA). A 2009 study shows, however, that dissemination of CC398 from exposed <b>humans</b> <b>to</b> other, non-exposed <b>humans</b> is infrequent. Though dangerous <b>to</b> <b>humans,</b> CC398 is often asymptomatic in food-producing animals. In a single study conducted in Denmark, MRSA was shown to originate in livestock and spread <b>to</b> <b>humans,</b> though the MRSA strain may have originated in humans and was transmitted to livestock.|$|R

50|$|Critics {{of animal}} testing have cited {{the case to}} argue that {{experiments}} on nonhuman animals, even in species closely related <b>to</b> <b>humans,</b> are not necessarily predictive of human responses, and cannot justify the harm inflicted on animals or the resultant risks <b>to</b> <b>humans.</b>|$|R
