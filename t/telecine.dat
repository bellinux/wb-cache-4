5|$|During {{the period}} between 1968 and 1969, NBN secured a relay from the Postmaster-General to enhance their news service. In 1970, NBN began {{upgrading}} its studios {{in preparation for the}} commencement of colour television at a cost of A$360,000. The improvements included an enlarged film department; a film editing and cleaning equipment; a larger master control with four video transfer machines; a new <b>telecine</b> room with caption scanner and slide drums; as well as an expansion of the administration and staff offices which also included new offices and a boardroom.|$|E
5|$|The {{video was}} {{directed}} by British directing duo James Frost & Alex of The Artists Company. It was shot at 50 frames per second, twice the regular speed. At the shoot, Chris Martin had to sing the song at double speed so that the audio and visual content would be in sync, a common yet difficult practice of music videos. The final product is slowed to 25 frames per second, giving the slow motion effect of the video. The transition of the video from night to day was achieved during the <b>telecine</b> process. During the transfer from film to videotape, an operator manually adjusted the amount of lighting for blue in the beginning, red in the middle, and yellow {{at the end of}} the video.|$|E
25|$|Over-saturated {{colors were}} used to reflect scenes of rural Thailand, which the {{director}} saw as bright and colorful. Walls on the sets and locations were painted pink or green, and lighting was used to achieve the saturation. The film was treated in the color grading process by transferring it to digital Betacam tape {{and then back to}} 35mm film. Oxide Pang, working as a <b>telecine</b> colorist, won a special effects award in Thailand for his work.|$|E

25|$|The {{combination}} of high gain, low noise, high frequency response or, equivalently, ultra-fast response, and large area of collection has maintained photomultipliers an essential place in nuclear and particle physics, astronomy, medical diagnostics including blood tests, medical imaging, motion picture film scanning (<b>telecine),</b> radar jamming, and high-end image scanners known as drum scanners. Elements of photomultiplier technology, when integrated differently, {{are the basis}} of night vision devices. Research that analyzes light scattering, such as the study of polymers in solution often use a laser and a PMT to collect the scattered light data.|$|E
25|$|The {{production}} of the television programmes was decentralised, with three Base Production Centres located at Delhi, Cuttack and Hyderabad, and an ISRO studio located in Mumbai. Each of the centres had a production studio, three IVC tape recorders, two 16mm. projectors, a slide Projector in <b>Telecine</b> and audio equipment like tape desks and turntables. Each centre also had 2–3 full-fledged synchronised sound camera units, an editing table (Delhi had two) and a film processing plant. There was also a sound dubbing studio equipped with a pilot tone recording plant and an audio mixing console.|$|E
25|$|Videotape {{technology}} {{was still in}} its infancy when Australian television was launched in 1956 and video recorders did not become widely available to Australian TV stations until the 1960s. For the first few years, the only available method for capturing TV programs was the kinescope process, in which a fixed movie camera filmed broadcasts screened on a specially adjusted TV monitor. Similarly, the playback of pre-recorded programs to air was only possible at this stage through the <b>telecine</b> process, in which films or kinescoped TV recordings were played back on a movie screen which was monitored by a TV camera.|$|E

50|$|For {{high-end}} systems many <b>telecines</b> {{are controlled}} by a Da Vinci Systems color corrector 2k or 2k Plus, which is also called color grading.|$|R
5000|$|... 2K and 2K Plus {{systems were}} {{intended}} for use with the then latest generation of <b>telecines</b> including Spirit, URSA or similar, C-Reality, Rascal, Sony and ITK <b>telecines.</b> MK3 / FDL / Quadra types were not supported. Many USA delivered 2Ks were supplied with an onboard TLC2 which supported 24/30 dual sync functionality for 24P operation. A TLC Assistant station comprising another IBM PC was available for dual operator installations. Alternatively, a standalone TLC2 of the traditional type could be interfaced if it was required.|$|R
25|$|Electromechanical {{broadcasts}} {{began in}} Germany in 1929, but were without sound until 1934. Network electronic service started on March 22, 1935, on 180 lines using <b>telecine</b> transmission of film, intermediate film system, or cameras using the Nipkow Disk. Transmissions using cameras {{based on the}} iconoscope began on January 15, 1936. The Berlin Summer Olympic Games were televised, using both all-electronic iconoscope-based cameras and intermediate film cameras, to Berlin and Hamburg in August 1936. Twenty-eight public television rooms were opened for anybody who did not own a television set. The Germans had a 441-line system {{on the air in}} February 1937, and during World War II brought it to France, where they broadcast from the Eiffel Tower.|$|E
25|$|A {{pioneering}} three-color additive {{system was}} patented in England by Edward Raymond Turner in 1899. It used a rotating set of red, {{green and blue}} filters to photograph the three color components {{one after the other}} on three successive frames of panchromatic black-and-white film. The finished film was projected through similar filters to reconstitute the color. In 1902, Turner shot test footage to demonstrate his system, but projecting it proved problematic because of the accurate registration (alignment) of the three separate color elements required for acceptable results. Turner died a year later without having satisfactorily projected the footage. In 2012, curators at the National Media Museum in Bradford, UK, had the original custom-format nitrate film copied to black-and-white 35mm film, which was then scanned into a digital video format by <b>telecine.</b> Finally, digital image processing was used to align and combine each group of three frames into one color image. The result is that the whole world can now view brief motion pictures from 1902 in full color.|$|E
500|$|In the UK, Doppelgänger {{has been}} aired on TV {{under the title}} Journey to the Far Side of the Sun and has been {{formatted}} accordingly. Broadcasts have often contained inverted picture due to a mistake made in transferring the original print to videotape. Prior to a screening in the 1980s, a <b>telecine</b> operator viewed the print and, being unfamiliar with {{the premise of the}} film, concluded that the scenes set on the parallel Earth had been reversed in error. An additional [...] "flop-over" [...] edit restored the image to normal, which became the standard for all broadcasts but compromised the plot: if Doppelgänger is screened in this modified form, the viewer is led to conclude that the parallel Ross has landed on the non-reversed, normal Earth.|$|E
5000|$|The film {{projectors}} {{used in a}} film chain are not standard. A special five-blade shutter is used {{to convert}} the film's 24 frames per second into NTSC's 30 frame per second video. If this was not used, the video would have major flicker problems. This process is called a [...] "3:2" [...] pull down. Modern <b>telecines</b> use the same process, but it is done electronically, not with a five-blade shutter. [...] "3:2" [...] pull down means that a film frame is shown for three TV fields. The next film frame is shown for two TV fields. The add field in the [...] "3" [...] is used to convert the 24 frames per second to 30 frames per second. A normal projector has a two-bladed shutter that shows the same frame twice. Before modern continuous motion <b>telecines,</b> film chains were sometime referred to as <b>telecines.</b>|$|R

5000|$|In {{addition}} to these field recorders, Kudelski S.A. produced a studio recorder called the Nagra T-Audio, designed mainly for use in <b>telecines</b> for transferring dailies. All of the above machines use 1/4" [...] tape.|$|R
500|$|The video premiered on June 21, 1993 on MTV, {{and later}} won two {{categories}} for Best Art Direction and Best Cinematography at the 1993 MTV Video Music Awards. It was ranked number 70 on Slant Magazines [...] "100 Greatest Music Videos" [...] list. Sal Cinquemani from the publication called {{it as one}} of Madonna's most beautiful music video and said, [...] "The waterlogged clip was a simple and refreshing break from the singer's visually sex-drenched Erotica period." [...] He also pointed out that despite its innocent look, [...] "it's difficult to separate the images from the song's double entendres." [...] Jef Rouner from Houston Press called the video [...] "one of Romanek's more light-hearted and definitely the most... purple of his work," [...] as well as [...] "a fascinating treatise on the act of creating a music video itself." [...] Bryant Frazer from Studio Daily described it as a futuristic, overexposed look influenced by Japanese fashion imagery." [...] He noted that the video [...] "pushed the boundaries of <b>telecine</b> work at the time." [...] Rettenmund called the video a [...] "masterpiece about art and artifice". He noted that although Romanek expressed to create a video [...] "devoid of nostalgia", instead the [...] "Rain" [...] clip [...] "created a modern enigma [...] who herself was no stranger to overexposure". The video was later commercially available on Madonna's video albums [...] (1999) and [...] (2009).|$|E
2500|$|While {{the series}} was in pre-production, studios were looking at ways for their {{existing}} shows {{to make the transition}} from the then-standard [...] to the widescreen formats that would accompany the next generation of televisions. After visiting Warner Bros., who were stretching the horizontal interval for an episode of , producer John Copeland convinced them to allow Babylon 5 to be shot on Super 35mm film stock. [...] "The idea being that we would <b>telecine</b> to 4:3 for the original broadcast of the series. But what it also gave us was a negative that had been shot for the new 16×9 widescreen-format televisions that we knew were on the horizon." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bassan {{was born}} in Burgas, Bulgaria, of French nationality, in 1948. His family moved to Paris in 1949. He has been {{interested}} in all forms of cinema from childhood. He has been a poet since 1964. He {{was one of the}} founders with Hubert Haddad of the magazine, [...] (which only published three issues). Feeling that he was locked into a post-surrealist form, he chose to write in a [...] "more modern" [...] style as a critic. After writing reviews in specialized magazines, his first [...] "professional" [...] job was for the magazine Politique Hebdo when it was founded in 1970. He co-founded the Collectif Jeune Cinéma (as a co-op) in 1971 and collaborated with a large number of magazines and various publications, notably the cinema magazines: <b>Téléciné</b> (1972–1976), Écran (1976–1980), Cinéma différent (1976–1980), La Revue du cinéma (1980–1992), Le Mensuel du cinéma (1992–1994), and the fine arts magazines: Canal (1978–1988), L'Art vivant (second formula: beginning of the 1980s), and the French national daily newspaper, Libération (1985–1991) and Senses of Cinema.|$|E
5000|$|... 1992 - In a {{significant}} development {{in addition to}} vector grading, Custom Curves {{were introduced to the}} Renaissance 888. 1994 - da Vinci Systems wholly acquired the TLC product line from Time Logic. The TLC is still viewed today as the de facto standard edit control interface between <b>telecines,</b> color correctors, VTRs and DDRs. TLC (Time Logic Controller) is an edit controller for <b>telecines,</b> vision mixers (switchers), and VTRs. It provides accurate 2:3 editing when transferring 24fps film in a 30fps video environment. TLC 1 was originally made in Moorpark, CA (started in Redondo Beach, then Simi Valley). The TLC 2 was released later that year under the da Vinci brand.|$|R
