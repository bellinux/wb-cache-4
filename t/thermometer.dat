5|$|A {{specific}} {{example of}} an RNA <b>thermometer</b> motif is the FourU <b>thermometer</b> found in Salmonella enterica. When exposed to temperatures above 45°C, the stem-loop that base-pairs opposite the Shine-Dalgarno sequence becomes unpaired and allows the mRNA to enter the ribosome for translation to occur. Mg2+ ion concentration {{has also been shown}} to affect the stability of FourU. The most well-studied RNA <b>thermometer</b> is found in the rpoH gene in Escherichia coli. This thermosensor upregulates heat shock proteins under high temperatures through σ32, a specialised heat-shock sigma factor.|$|E
5|$|Examples of RNA {{thermometers}} include FourU, the Hsp90 cis-regulatory element, the ROSE element and the Hsp17 <b>thermometer.</b>|$|E
5|$|In about 1593, Galileo {{constructed}} a <b>thermometer,</b> using the expansion and contraction of {{air in a}} bulb to move water in an attached tube.|$|E
5|$|Most <b>thermometers</b> now use {{pigmented}} alcohol {{instead of}} mercury, and galinstan alloy <b>thermometers</b> are also an option. Mercury <b>thermometers</b> are still occasionally {{used in the}} medical field {{because they are more}} accurate than alcohol <b>thermometers,</b> though both are commonly being replaced by electronic <b>thermometers</b> and less commonly by galinstan <b>thermometers.</b> Mercury <b>thermometers</b> are still widely used for certain scientific applications because of their greater accuracy and working range.|$|R
50|$|Alcohol <b>thermometers,</b> {{infrared}} <b>thermometers,</b> mercury-in-glass <b>thermometers,</b> recording <b>thermometers,</b> thermistors, and Six's <b>thermometers</b> {{are used}} in meteorology and climatology in various levels of the atmosphere and oceans. Aircraft use <b>thermometers</b> and hygrometers to determine if atmospheric icing conditions exist along their flight path. These measurements are used to initialize weather forecast models. <b>Thermometers</b> {{are used in}} roadways in cold weather climates to help determine if icing conditions exist and indoors in climate control systems.|$|R
50|$|<b>Thermometers</b> may be {{described}} as empirical or absolute. Absolute <b>thermometers</b> are calibrated numerically by the thermodynamic absolute temperature scale. Empirical <b>thermometers</b> are not in general necessarily in exact agreement with absolute <b>thermometers</b> as to their numerical scale readings, but to qualify as <b>thermometers</b> at all they must agree with absolute <b>thermometers</b> and {{with each other in}} the following way: given any two bodies isolated in their separate respective thermodynamic equilibrium states, all <b>thermometers</b> agree as to which of the two has the higher temperature, or that the two have equal temperatures. For any two empirical <b>thermometers,</b> this does not require that the relation between their numerical scale readings be linear, but it does require that relation to be strictly monotonic. This is a fundamental character of temperature and <b>thermometers.</b>|$|R
5|$|The ibpAB operon of E. coli is {{predicted}} to contain two co-operative RNA thermometers: a ROSE element and the IbpB <b>thermometer.</b>|$|E
5|$|Though {{typically}} {{associated with}} heat-induced protein expression, RNA thermometers can also regulate cold-shock proteins. For example, the expression of two 7kDa proteins are regulated by an RNA <b>thermometer</b> in the thermophilic bacterium Thermus thermophilus and a similar mechanism has been identified in Enterobacteriales.|$|E
5|$|An RNA <b>thermometer</b> (or RNA thermosensor) is a temperature-sensitive non-coding RNA {{molecule}} which regulates gene expression. RNA thermometers often regulate genes required during {{either a}} heat shock or cold shock response, {{but have been}} implicated in other regulatory roles such as in pathogenicity and starvation.|$|E
50|$|Mercury also {{enters into}} the {{environment}} through the improper disposal (e.g., land filling, incineration) of certain products. Products containing mercury include: auto parts, batteries, fluorescent bulbs, medical products, <b>thermometers,</b> and thermostats. Due to health concerns (see below), toxics use reduction efforts are cutting back or eliminating mercury in such products. For example, most <b>thermometers</b> now use pigmented alcohol instead of mercury. Mercury <b>thermometers</b> are still occasionally used in the medical field {{because they are more}} accurate than alcohol <b>thermometers,</b> though both are being replaced by electronic <b>thermometers.</b> Mercury <b>thermometers</b> are still widely used for certain scientific applications because of their greater accuracy and working range.|$|R
50|$|Rectal <b>thermometers</b> {{are often}} colored cherry red to {{differentiate}} them from oral or axillary <b>thermometers,</b> {{as well as}} having a shorter, squat, pear, or stubby bulb shape. They {{are not meant to}} be used interchangeably with other types of <b>thermometers.</b>|$|R
50|$|FourU <b>thermometers</b> are a {{class of}} non-coding RNA <b>thermometers</b> found in Salmonella. They are named 'FourU' due to the four highly conserved uridine {{nucleotides}} found directly opposite the Shine-Dalgarno sequence on hairpin II (pictured).RNA <b>thermometers</b> such as FourU control regulation of temperature via heat shock proteins in many prokaryotes. FourU <b>thermometers</b> are relatively small RNA molecules, only 57 nucleotides in length, and have a simple two-hairpin structure.|$|R
5|$|Though {{predominantly}} {{found in}} prokaryotes, a potential RNA <b>thermometer</b> {{has been found}} in mammals including humans. The candidate thermosensor heat shock RNA-1 (HSR1) activates heat-shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) and induces protective proteins when cell temperature exceeds 37°C (body temperature), thus preventing the cells from overheating.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Major Margaret Houlihan (Loretta Swit) and Major Frank Burns (Larry Linville) are eagerly {{awaiting}} the upcoming transfer of {{command of the}} 4077th MASH: upon Blake's departure, Burns will become the unit commander. Henry and Radar begin {{to clean out the}} main office, sharing a sentimental moment in which Radar tells Blake of his meaning to him. As a token of appreciation and admiration, Radar gives him an inscribed Winchester cartridge; a surprised Henry returns the favor by spontaneously giving Radar a rectal <b>thermometer</b> that once belonged to his father.|$|E
5|$|The Girossi newsstands project, {{which was}} never carried out, was a {{commission}} from the tradesman Enrique Girossi de Sanctis. It would have consisted of 20 newsstands, spread throughout Barcelona. Each would have included a public lavatory, a flower stand and glass panels for advertisements {{as well as}} a clock, a calendar, a barometer and a <b>thermometer.</b> Gaudí conceived a structure with iron pillars and marble and glass slabs, crowned by a large iron and glass roof, with a gas illumination system.|$|E
40|$|Despite {{great strides}} in the {{reduction}} of mercury use in health and home applications, mercury <b>thermometers</b> remain in common use {{in a variety of}} laboratory and testing uses. Historically, health care, regulated testing laboratories, and specific industries (e. g., petroleum) have relied on NIST-calibrated or NIST-traceable mercury-in-glass <b>thermometers</b> as stable reference standards of temperature. The use of mercury <b>thermometers</b> has been virtually eliminated in routine hospital use, but a wide variety of regulations and test methods continue to specify mercury <b>thermometers.</b> Mercury <b>thermometers</b> have several intrinsic advantages: • stable for long periods • failure usually is visually apparent • minimal training or maintenance is required. However, mercury is a powerful neurotoxin, and the cost of cleaning a mercury spill in industry is several thousands of dollars. Furthermore, many states now restrict the sale of mercury <b>thermometers.</b> Further adoption of alternatives to mercury <b>thermometers</b> is stymied by the lack o...|$|R
40|$|RNA <b>thermometers</b> are thermosensors that {{regulate}} gene expression by temperature-induced changes in RNA conformation. Naturally occurring RNA <b>thermometers</b> exhibit complex secondary structures which {{are believed to}} undergo a series of gradual structural changes in response to temperature shifts. Here, we report the de novo design of considerably simpler RNA <b>thermometers</b> that provide useful RNA-only tools to regulate bacterial gene expression by {{a shift in the}} growth temperature. We show that a single small stem-loop structure containing the ribosome binding site is sufficient to construct synthetic RNA <b>thermometers</b> that work efficiently at physiological temperatures. Our data suggest that the <b>thermometers</b> function by a simple melting mechanism and thus provide minimum size on/off switches to experimentally induce or repress gene expression by temperature...|$|R

5|$|As {{an obsessive}} new mother {{who has spent}} many an hour {{hovering}} over my son with a <b>thermometer</b> and a pre-emptive bottle of Calpol, Rachel's contention that she didn't {{want to go out}} for dinner with Adam because she couldn't bear to leave three-month-old Matthew in the care of their best friend's children's nanny was just one niggling implausibility too far. After three months of being on baby duty 24 hours a day, every woman I've ever come across has, ordinary guilt aside, all but wept with joy at the prospect of a bowl of pasta and a glass of wine consumed somewhere other than Babyville. None of which would matter a jot, of course, had Cold Feet not been feted for reflecting the lives of its target audience.|$|E
5|$|Detective Michael Tritter is a {{recurring}} fictional {{character in the}} medical drama series House, portrayed by David Morse. He is the main antagonist of the third season, which ran between 2006 and 2007. Tritter is a police detective, who tries to get Dr. Gregory House (Hugh Laurie) to apologize for leaving him in an examination room with a <b>thermometer</b> in his rectum. After House refuses to apologize, Tritter researches House's background and discovers his Vicodin addiction. Tritter turns people close to House against him and forces House to go to rehab. When the case ultimately comes to court, the judge sentences House to one night in jail, for contempt of court, and to finish his rehabilitation, telling Tritter that she believes House is not the drug addict {{he tried to make}} him out to be.|$|E
5|$|RNA {{thermometers}} {{are found}} in the 5' UTR of messenger RNA, upstream of a protein-coding gene. Here they are able to occlude the ribosome binding site (RBS) and prevent translation of the mRNA into protein. As temperature increases, the hairpin structure can 'melt' and expose the RBS or Shine-Dalgarno sequence to permit binding of the small ribosomal subunit (30S), which then assembles other translation machinery. The start codon, typically found 8 nucleotides downstream of the Shine-Dalgarno sequence, signals the beginning of a protein-coding gene which is then translated to a peptide product by the ribosome. In addition to this cis-acting mechanism, a lone example of a trans-acting RNA <b>thermometer</b> has been found in RpoS mRNA where it is thought {{to be involved in the}} starvation response.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{identify}} {{the attitudes of}} general practitioners towards the use of <b>thermometers</b> in general practice. DESIGN [...] Postal questionnaire survey. SETTING [...] All general practitioners in the catchment area of Frimley Park Hospital, Surrey. SUBJECTS [...] 145 general practitioners. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Answers to questions covering a variety of aspects concerning the use of <b>thermometers</b> in general practice. RESULTS [...] 116 (80 %) doctors replied. Seven doctors {{did not have any}} method of taking a patient's temperature; up to 12 more doctors did not use their <b>thermometers</b> and 56 doctors used them infrequently, less than once a fortnight. Mercury glass <b>thermometers</b> were most commonly used (80 doctors; 69 %), but only 8 % of doctors used them correctly. Six doctors failed to clean their <b>thermometers</b> between patients. The study failed to {{identify the}} roles of axillary and rectal temperature readings. CONCLUSION [...] There is a wide variation in attitudes towards the use of <b>thermometers</b> in general practice...|$|R
5|$|The first temperature-sensitive RNA element was {{reported}} in 1989. Prior to this research, mutations upstream from the transcription start site in a lambda (λ) phage cIII mRNA were found to affect the level of translation of the cIII protein. This protein is involved in selection of either a lytic or lysogenic life cycle in λ phage, with high concentrations of cIII promoting lysogeny. Further study of this upstream RNA region identified two alternative secondary structures; experimental study found the structures to be interchangeable, and dependent on both magnesium ion concentration and temperature. This RNA <b>thermometer</b> is now thought to encourage entry to a lytic cycle under heat stress {{in order for the}} bacteriophage to rapidly replicate and escape the host cell.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{possible}} to rule out many explanations of the observed divergences in the masses of the world's prototypes proposed by scientists and the general public. The BIPM's FAQ explains, for example, that the divergence {{is dependent on the}} amount of time elapsed between measurements and not dependent on the number of times the artifacts have been cleaned or possible changes in gravity or environment. Reports published in 2013 by Peter Cumpson of Newcastle University based on the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy of samples that were stored alongside various prototype kilograms suggested that one source of the divergence between the various prototypes could be traced to mercury that had been absorbed by the prototypes being in the proximity of mercury-based instruments. The IPK has been stored within centimetres of a mercury <b>thermometer</b> since at least {{as far back as the}} late 1980s. In this Newcastle University work six platinum weights made in the nineteenth century were all found to have mercury at the surface, the most contaminated of which had the equivalent of 250µg of mercury when scaled to the surface area of a kilogram prototype.|$|E
5|$|On {{the table}} are various {{other pieces of}} {{equipment}} that the natural philosopher would have used during his demonstration: a <b>thermometer,</b> candle snuffer and cork, {{and close to the}} man seated to the right is a pair of Magdeburg hemispheres, which would have been used with the air pump to demonstrate the difference in pressure exerted by the air and a vacuum: when the air was pumped out from between the two hemispheres they were impossible to pull apart. The air pump itself is rendered in exquisite detail, a faithful record of the designs in use at the time. What may be a human skull in the large liquid-filled glass bowl would not have been a normal piece of equipment; William Schupbach suggests that it and the candle, which is presumably lighting the bowl from behind, form a vanitas—the two symbols of mortality reflecting the cockatoo's struggle for life.|$|E

5|$|When making observations, {{scientists}} {{look through}} telescopes, study images on electronic screens, record meter readings, and so on. Generally, on a basic level, they {{can agree on}} what they see, e.g., the <b>thermometer</b> shows 37.9 degrees C. But, if these scientists have different ideas about the theories {{that have been developed}} to explain these basic observations, they may disagree about what they are observing. For example, before Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, observers would have likely interpreted the image at left as five different objects in space. In light of that theory, however, astronomers will tell you that there are actually only two objects, one in the center and four different images of a second object around the sides. Alternatively, if other scientists suspect that something is wrong with the telescope and only one object is actually being observed, they are operating under yet another theory. Observations that cannot be separated from theoretical interpretation are said to be theory-laden.|$|E
5|$|Although Galileo seriously {{considered}} the priesthood {{as a young}} man, at his father's urging he instead enrolled at the University of Pisa for a medical degree. In 1581, when he was studying medicine, he noticed a swinging chandelier, which air currents shifted about to swing in larger and smaller arcs. To him, it seemed, by comparison with his heartbeat, that the chandelier took {{the same amount of}} time to swing back and forth, no matter how far it was swinging. When he returned home, he set up two pendulums of equal length and swung one with a large sweep and the other with a small sweep and found that they kept time together. It was not until the work of Christiaan Huygens, almost one hundred years later, that the tautochrone nature of a swinging pendulum was used to create an accurate timepiece. Up to this point, Galileo had deliberately been kept away from mathematics, since a physician earned a higher income than a mathematician. However, after accidentally attending a lecture on geometry, he talked his reluctant father into letting him study mathematics and natural philosophy instead of medicine. He created a thermoscope, a forerunner of the <b>thermometer,</b> and, in 1586, published a small book on the design of a hydrostatic balance he had invented (which first brought him to the attention of the scholarly world). Galileo also studied disegno, a term encompassing fine art, and, in 1588, obtained the position of instructor in the Accademia delle Arti del Disegno in Florence, teaching perspective and chiaroscuro. Being inspired by the artistic tradition of the city and the works of the Renaissance artists, Galileo acquired an aesthetic mentality. While a young teacher at the Accademia, he began a lifelong friendship with the Florentine painter Cigoli, who included Galileo's lunar observations in one of his paintings.|$|E
