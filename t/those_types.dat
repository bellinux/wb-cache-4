5|$|Chemical {{defense is}} another {{important}} defense found among species of Coleoptera and Lepidoptera, usually being advertised by bright colors, such as the monarch butterfly. They obtain their toxicity by sequestering the chemicals from the plants they eat into their own tissues. Some Lepidoptera manufacture their own toxins. Predators that eat poisonous butterflies and moths may become sick and vomit violently, learning not to eat <b>those</b> <b>types</b> of species; this is actually the basis of Müllerian mimicry. A predator who has previously eaten a poisonous lepidopteran may avoid other species with similar markings in the future, thus saving many other species as well. Some ground beetles of the Carabidae family can spray chemicals from their abdomen with great accuracy, to repel predators.|$|E
5|$|Following the event, a {{field survey}} was {{conducted}} along the fault zone {{with the goal of}} estimating the peak ground acceleration of the shock based on visually evaluating precarious rock formations and other indicators. Ground disturbances that were created by the earthquakes were also surveyed, both in the valley and in the foothills, with both vertical and horizontal displacements present in the epicentral area. The strong motion records that were acquired from the event were significant, and a reconnaissance report was recognized for its coverage of the event, and how it set a standard for <b>those</b> <b>types</b> of engineering or scientific papers. Repercussions of the sequence of earthquakes were still being felt in the heavily damaged downtown area of Bakersfield well into the 1990s as city leaders attempted to improve safety of the surviving unreinforced masonry buildings.|$|E
5|$|In November 2011, Kaye {{announced}} that particles of pure (unalloyed) titanium {{had also been}} found on the tie. He explained that titanium, which was much rarer in the 1970s than it is today, {{was at that time}} found only in metal fabrication or production facilities, or at chemical companies using it (combined with aluminum) to store extremely corrosive substances. The findings suggested that Cooper may have been a chemist or a metallurgist, or possibly an engineer or manager (the only employees who wore ties in such facilities at that time) in a metal or chemical manufacturing plant, or at a company that recovered scrap metal from <b>those</b> <b>types</b> of factories. In January 2017, Kaye reported that rare earth minerals such as cerium and strontium sulfide had also been identified among particles from the tie. One of the rare applications for such elements in the 1970s was Boeing's supersonic transport development project, suggesting the possibility that Cooper was a Boeing employee. Other possible sources of the material included plants that manufactured cathode ray tubes, such as the Portland firms Teledyne and Tektronix.|$|E

5|$|Yet more {{extraneous}} {{details were}} removed from the Pipe rolls under the Cowick Ordinance of June 1323, along with further ordinances in 1324 and 1326, all of which were done during the time that Walter de Stapledon held the office of Treasurer. Prior to this reform the rolls had become clogged with debts, and clauses 2 through 8 of the Cowick Ordinance attempted to return the rolls to an exposition of accounts. Another attempted reform at this time was the removal of customs receipts, as well as military accounts, from the rolls. New offices in the Exchequer were also created, in an attempt to speed up the auditing process and lessen the time it took to prepare the Pipe rolls and other financial records. The attempt to remove non-Exchequer accounts did completely remove <b>those</b> <b>types</b> of records from the Pipe rolls, and further reforms in 1368 created a set of foreign rolls, and all extraneous records in the Pipe rolls were transferred to those rolls.|$|E

Other classes of customers, such as those with private banking accounts and those of foreign government officials, are subjected to enhanced due diligence because the law deems that <b>those</b> <b>types</b> of accounts are a higher risk for money laundering. All accounts are subject to ongoing monitoring, in which internal bank software scrutinizes transactions and flags for manual inspection those that fall outside certain parameters.

Although the language of Yuan poetry is still generally considered to be Classical Chinese, a certain vernacular aspect reflecting linguistic changes can be seen in some of the fixed-rhythm verse forms, such as Yuan ci and qu. Certain aspects of Yuan poetry can be understood in the context of the social and political changes which took place as part of the process of the Mongol conquest of the Jin and Song Dynasties and their subsequent establishment of the Yuan dynasty.|$|E

40|$|AbstractPowerful {{concurrency}} primitives {{in recent}} concurrent languages and thread libraries provide great flexibility about implementation of high-level features like concurrent objects.

In order to overcome <b>those</b> problems, advanced <b>type</b> systems for input-only/output-only channels and linear (use-once) channels have been recently studied, but the type reconstruction problem for <b>those</b> <b>type</b> systems remained open, and therefore, their applications to concurrent programming languages have been limited. In this paper, we develop type reconstruction algorithms for variants of Kobayashi, Pierce, and Turner's linear channel type system with Pierce and Sangiorgi's subtyping based on input-only/output-only channel types and prove correctness of the algorithms. To our knowledge, no complete type reconstruction algorithm has been previously known for <b>those</b> <b>type</b> systems. We have implemented one of the algorithms and incorporated it into the compiler of the concurrent language HACL. This paper also shows some experimental results on the algorithm and its application to compile-time optimizations...|$|R
25|$|S. 517 {{would impose}} a private-sector mandate by {{eliminating}} an existing right {{of action for}} wireless carriers (and others), who are currently able to pursue legal action against those who, without permission, circumvent the access controls on certain wireless telephone handsets. The cost of the mandate would be the forgone net value of settlements and damages in such cases. A search of the literature suggests that few, if any, of <b>those</b> <b>types</b> of lawsuits have been brought against individual consumers. Because such claims would probably be uncommon {{in the future and}} the damage awards allowed in such cases would be relatively small, CBO estimates that the cost of this mandate would be small and fall below the annual threshold established in UMRA for private-sector mandate ($152 million in 2014, adjusted annually for inflation). If the Librarian of Congress decides to broaden the exemption allowed under the bill to cover other types of mobile devices, such an action would eliminate additional rights of action. The cost of that expansion would depend on what devices the Librarian would include under the exemption and the forgone net value of settlements and damages. CBO has no basis to estimate the cost of such mandates as it would depend on the regulatory actions taken by the Librarian.|$|E
