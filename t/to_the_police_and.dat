5000|$|In 2016, Nicolson {{put forward}} a {{proposal}} for an [...] "Alan Turing law" [...] which would retroactively pardon gay and bisexual {{men who had been}} convicted of offences under historical law which outlawed certain homosexual acts that are no longer crimes. He placed his proposal before Parliament as a Private Member's Bill. However, the government instead supported a cross-party amendment <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Policing</b> <b>and</b> Crime Act 2017, which had been tabled by the Liberal Democrats on the same issue. Nicolson did not withdraw his bill as the amendment proposed a much narrower law which would pardon only the dead and not the living. The Turing Bill was filibustered by Conservative government Justice Minister Sam Gyimah.The Minister spoke for around 25 minutes on the Bill, continuing until the deadline for a vote on the proposals. <b>The</b> amendment <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Policing</b> <b>and</b> Crime Act 2017 was eventually adopted meaning that people who are living with such historic convictions will not receive pardons automatically.|$|R
