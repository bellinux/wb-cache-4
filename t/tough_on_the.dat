25|$|Beginning in 1929, the Lopez family began {{migrating}} {{north for}} work. In that year, {{they arrived in}} Arvin, CA in the San Joaquin Valley {{and worked as a}} crew picking cotton. Her Aunt Maria, who Jessie recalled as her sister because of their close age and sister like relationship, was killed in a tragic accident when her dress caught fire, causing her to perish. In January 1930, her mother Guadalupe fell ill and was bedridden by February. She died on March 11, 1930 and was laid to rest in Compton, CA. After the death of their mother, Lopez and her sisters moved back to Anaheim with their grandparents. Her grandfather Basillo returned to cotton picking in the San Gabriel Valley to support them, but fell ill shortly after and died of dropsy on June 14, 1930. The depression years were <b>tough</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Lopez family. In 1931 they became migrant workers again, often sleeping roadside in a tent.|$|E

At Gloria's suggestion, immediate subsequent television spots referred to the bankruptcy, spelling out the troubles and asking customers to please buy today. A crisis manager took control of operations, leaving Peterson to work the sales floors until the stores closed in March 1992. Peterson said in 1995, [...] "The big nationals make it very <b>tough</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> regional, like Smith's, and on the locals, like us."

500|$|During his {{tours in}} the early 1990s, his memory failed him at times during concerts, and he fainted onstage in Richmond, Virginia, in March 1994. His final public concerts were held in Fukuoka Dome in Japan on December 19–20, 1994. The {{following}} year, Sinatra sang for the very last time on February 25, 1995, before a live audience of 1200 select guests at the Palm Desert Marriott Ballroom, on the closing night of the Frank Sinatra Desert Classic golf tournament. Esquire reported of the show that Sinatra was [...] "clear, <b>tough,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> money" [...] and [...] "in absolute control". Sinatra was awarded the Legend Award at the 1994 Grammy Awards, where he was introduced by Bono, who said of him, [...] "Frank's {{the chairman of the}} bad attitude...

500|$|Sommers felt [...] "almost 100 percent" [...] of the {{technology}} in the film would actually become available within 10 to 20 years, citing the various books and magazines about developing weapons that he loved reading. For example, Sommers said he believed invisibility was impossible, but the virtual invisibility provided by camouflage camera that projects the background of a soldier's body upon its front allowed him to include it. The production designers modelled the interior of Destro's private submarine on a Handley Page Jetstream. Sommers said the bulky immobile [...] "accelerator suits" [...] (which Beattie said had enabled them to write [...] "a car chase where one guy's not even in a car") had been <b>tough</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> actors and were likely to have their roles reduced in potential sequels.

500|$|Johnson presided {{with dignity}} over Lincoln's funeral ceremonies in Washington, before his predecessor's body {{was sent home}} to Springfield, Illinois, for burial. Shortly after Lincoln's death, Union General William T. Sherman {{reported}} he had, without consulting Washington, reached an armistice agreement with Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston for the surrender of Confederate forces in North Carolina {{in exchange for the}} existing state government remaining in power, with private property rights to be respected. This did not even acknowledge the freedom of those in slavery. This was not acceptable to Johnson or the Cabinet who sent word for Sherman to secure the surrender without making political deals, which he did. Further, Johnson placed a $100,000 bounty (equivalent to $ in [...] ) on Confederate President Davis, then a fugitive, which gave him the reputation of a man who would be <b>tough</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> South. More controversially, he permitted the execution of Mary Surratt for her part in Lincoln's assassination. Surratt was executed with three others, including Atzerodt, on July 7, 1865.|$|E
500|$|In 1976, Ripken {{finally reached}} the major leagues when the Orioles named him their bullpen coach. Halfway through 1977, he became the third base coach for the Orioles when Billy Hunter was hired to be {{the manager of the}} Texas Rangers. Ripken served in this role through the 1986 season. During this time, and even later when he became a manager, he would pitch batting {{practice}} and hit fungoes before games. He {{would be one of the}} last members of the team to leave after games. Ripken could be <b>tough</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> players he coached, enjoying using the term [...] "lunkhead" [...] when talking to them, but he would always make time to answer any questions they had about the game. Doug DeCinces, who played under him through the 1981 season, recalled, [...] "He was the dictator of that regimen, instructing us on everything down to how to wear our socks. He said, `Take pride in your appearance and you'll take pride in your game.'" [...] The Orioles experienced great success during this time, reaching the World Series in 1979, which they lost to the Pittsburgh Pirates in seven games. Four years later, Ripken earned a World Series ring as the Orioles won the 1983 World Series in five games over the Philadelphia Phillies.|$|E
500|$|As {{the title}} indicates, {{it sought to}} {{distance}} itself from New Age politics. [...] If the term [...] "New Age" [...] suggests utopianism, the term [...] "radical middle" [...] suggests, for Satin and others, keeping at least one foot firmly on the ground. [...] Satin attempted to embrace the promise but also the balance implied by the term. [...] One feature story is entitled [...] "Tough on Terrorism, and <b>Tough</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Causes of Terrorism". [...] Another feature story attempts to go beyond polarized positions on biotechnology. [...] Another argues that corporate activity abroad can best be seen as neither inherently moral nor inherently imperialistic, but as a [...] "chance for mutual learning". [...] The board of advisors of Radical Middle Newsletter signaled Satin's new direction. [...] It was politically diverse, {{and many of its}} members sought to promote dialogue or collaboration across ideological divides. [...] By the end of 2004 it included John Avlon, Don Edward Beck, Jerry H. Bentley, Esther Dyson, Mark P. Painter, Shelley Alpern of the Social Investment Forum, James Fallows of the New America Foundation, Jane Mansbridge of the Harvard Kennedy School, John D.

500|$|Labour {{is unable}} to make {{significant}} dents in the Conservative majority at the 1987 general election, with the Tories dropping by only 0.2% in the national share of the vote compared to 1983. Kinnock promotes Smith to Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer, with Brown as his [...] "number two". Three years later, Thatcher resigns as Prime Minister having been toppled from within the Conservative Party, and Brown asserts his view that a Labour victory {{in the next election}} will now be possible. Despite contrary predictions, however, the Conservatives led by John Major win the 1992 general election and secure the most votes ever recorded for a single political party in British history. Blair tells Brown that a new approach is needed, and that Brown should stand for the party leadership. Brown refuses to stand against Smith, his friend and mentor. Mandelson privately suggests to Brown that Blair should stand as leader but Brown ridicules the idea. Smith is elected and, over the next two years, Labour gains support as scandals rock the government - but both Blair and Brown are concerned that Smith's [...] "one more heave" [...] strategy of allowing Conservative unpopularity to hand the next election victory to Labour is not radical enough. Blair, as Shadow Home Secretary, pledges to be [...] "tough on crime, <b>tough</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> causes of crime" [...] {{in the wake of the}} murder of James Bulger. During a late-night conversation about the future direction of the party, Smith tells a clearly irritated Brown that he sees Blair as his natural successor.|$|E

60|$|As to Bievre, then, James Mohr was right. He {{may or may}} {{not have}} lied in the {{following}} paper, when he says that the Prince was coming over, with Lord Marischal, to the Balhaldie faction of Jacobites, who were more in touch with the French Court than his own associates. Mr. Trant, of whom James Mohr speaks, was really with the Prince, as Pickle also asserts, and as the Stuart Papers prove. Probably he was akin to Olive Trant, a pretty intriguer of 1715, mentioned by Bolingbroke in his famous letter to Wyndham. As to Ireland, James Mohr really did take it on his way to France, though his promises in the name of 'the People of Fingal' are Irish moonshine. Were arms, as James Mohr says, lodged in Clanranald's country, Moidart? Pickle refused to let them be landed in Knoydart, his own country, and thought nothing of the kind could be done without his knowledge. James Mohr may really have had news of arms landed at the House of <b>Tough</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Forth, near Stirling, where they would be very convenient. Pickle, I conceive, was not trusted by Clanranald, and Cameron he had traduced. If James Mohr by accident speaks the truth in the following Information, more was done by Lochgarry and Cameron than Pickle wotted of during the autumn of 1752 and the spring of 1753. The arms may have been those ordered by Charles in 1750.|$|E
