He recommended at least eight hours sleep each night and short naps throughout the day.|$|E
500|$|Anaerobic {{digestion}} (AD), {{the breaking}} down of biodegradable material by microorganisms {{in the absence}} of oxygen, is recognised as an effective method of waste disposal, with the potential to address the food waste problem nationally. AD technology has a small environmental impact, producing less greenhouse gas emissions than composting. However, although the process is well established in the water industry, it is less so within the waste sector. Despite this, the AD industry is being (and planned to be further) expanded by local councils and retailers to deal with food waste; several local authorities in the UK are planning to build anaerobic digestion plants, with the largest, to be located in Selby, due to operate from 2010. Supermarket chains Tesco and Sainsbury's are both adopting AD technology to dispose of their waste, while Tesco's head of waste and recycling said: [...] "As renewable energy technologies now become mainstream, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>excuse</b> for sending waste to landfill that could actually be put to positive use." [...] AD technology remains an experimental field though, and there is potential for advancements to increase efficiency. In July 2014 Sainsbury's began powering one of its stores using anaerobic digestion.|$|E

2500|$|John Calvin {{describes}} the sacred {{origin of the}} role of human father (which thus demands honour). The analogy between the honour of parents and the honour of God himself is further strengthened by this understanding that earthly fatherhood is derived from God's Fatherhood. [...] Thus the duty to honour does not depend on whether the parent is particularly worthy. However, Calvin acknowledges that some fathers are outright wicked and emphasizes <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>excuse</b> for sin in the name of honouring a parent, calling the notion [...] "absurd".|$|E

2500|$|However, a 2011 {{report by}} the Historical Inquiries Team (HET) {{concluded}} that Provisional IRA members were responsible and that the [...] "South Armagh Republican Action Force" [...] was merely a covername. It added: [...] "There is some intelligence that the Provisional IRA unit responsible was not well-disposed towards central co-ordination but <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>excuse</b> in that. These dreadful murders were {{carried out by the}} Provisional IRA and none other". Responding to the report, Sinn Féin spokesman Mitchel McLaughlin said that he did [...] "not dispute the sectarian nature of the killings" [...] but continued to believe [...] "the denials by the IRA that they were involved". SDLP Assemblyman Dominic Bradley called on Sinn Féin to [...] "publicly accept that the HET's forensic evidence on the firearms used puts Provisional responsibility beyond question" [...] and to stop [...] "deny that the Provisional IRA was in the business of organising sectarian killings on a large scale".|$|E
2500|$|Finberg says [...] "I think I {{may take}} this {{opportunity}} to protest once again against the prevalent habit of calling this artist Janssens. In spite of Walpole's unfortunate remark that this is the correct form of the name, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>excuse</b> for using it. While in England the artist invariably spelt his name Cornelius Johnson, and when he left England he changed the form to Jonson. The usual form of his signature when the name is given in full is invariably, in all the pictures painted after 1643 which I have seen : ' Cornelius Jonson van Ceulen.' He appears never to have adopted the form of Janson, Jansen, or Janssens. But so long as auctioneers are born with an ingrained conviction that a foreign-looking name gives greater value to a picture than an English name, so long may we expect to find Cornelius Johnson or Jonson masquerading in catalogues as Cornelius Janssens." ...|$|E

2500|$|During {{the summer}} of 2000, bassist Brian Marshall began a spiral into alcoholism. While under the influence, Marshall {{threatened}} to beat up Tremonti, began missing band obligations, and attacked Stapp both verbally and online. The band {{had a meeting with}} management to discuss Marshall's future. Stapp and Tremonti supported the idea of Marshall going to rehab and attempted to talk Marshall into going, but he refused. Initially, the public thought Marshall was let go because he criticized Pearl Jam frontman Eddie Vedder in a radio interview with KNDD in June 2000, claiming that Scott Stapp is a better songwriter, and criticized Pearl Jam's recent albums for [...] "having songs without hooks." [...] Stapp later distanced the rest of the band from Marshall's comments and stated, [...] "Yes, we get tired of the PJ question, but <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>excuse</b> for the arrogance and stupidity [...] I ask you all not to judge Creed as a band, because the statements made were not the band's feelings, they were Brian's. I'm sorry if Brian offended anyone, and he has already apologized for his comments." [...] Although it was reported that Marshall left Creed [...] "on friendly terms", he did not. Tremonti and Stapp were concerned for Marshall and their collective friendships, but soon after the controversy, Marshall formed a new band called Grand Luxx with his old Mattox Creed band mates. Stapp stated that Marshall's leaving was his choice and was unrelated to the Pearl Jam comments. Brett Hestla, from the band Virgos Merlot, replaced Marshall for the tour.|$|E
