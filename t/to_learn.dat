Despite mixed empirical evidence, the possibility of encouraging students to adopt a deep approach <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> through interventions in the learning context is suggested by the approaches <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> and metacognition literatures. Functional Linguistics (Halliday, 1985) provides principles upon which such interventions might be based. This paper, first, provides a rich description of an intervention in an introductory accounting course to encourage a deep approach <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> by improving students' written communication skills. Second, the effectiveness of the intervention is examined by comparing students' approaches <b>to</b> <b>learning,</b> using Biggs' (1987 a) Study Process Questionnaire, with those at another leading Australian university offering a more 'traditional' course. The findings broadly confirm the effectiveness of the intervention, both in encouraging a deep approach, and in improving overall course results. approaches <b>to</b> <b>learning,</b> functional linguistics, study process questionnaire, deep approach <b>to</b> <b>learning,</b> writing and curriculum design, introductory accounting,...|$|R

Unlike other learning styles models, a person's approach <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> {{is seen as a}} function of the interaction between the learner, the discipline and the context (rather than as a function of personality traits). However the relationship between context-specific approach <b>to</b> <b>learning,</b> context-general metacognition and trait-based personality requires further elaboration. Using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis of three different inventories (approach <b>to</b> <b>learning,</b> metacognition and personality), we identify that these constructs do not appear to be distinct from each other, and consequently that the approaches <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> model may misrepresent both the nature and the importance of strategic approaches <b>to</b> <b>learning...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the effect of 5 E learning model on three seventh grade students’ approaches <b>to</b> <b>learning.</b> The students’ approaches to “remembering what s/he learned”, “the goal of learning” and “encountering the difficulty in learning” before and after the application of 5 E model is presented. Data was gathered through these students’ scores on the scale of “Deep Approaches to Learning” and “Surface Approaches to Learning”. Pre and post interviews were also conducted with the students. The results show that the change in students’ approaches <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> varies from each other. Two of the three students used both “deep approaches” and “surface approaches” <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> before the application of 5 E model, then the students developed their approaches <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> deeply. The third student maintained both “deep approach” and “surface approach” <b>to</b> <b>learning.</b> The reason why two of the three students changed their approaches <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> deeply is that through 5 E learning model, these students become active participants in the process of learning.

The {{purpose of this study is}} <b>to</b> measure the <b>learning</b> approach (deep versus surface) of first-year engineering students, test the impact of two interventions (journaling and learning strategy awareness) on increasing the deep approach <b>to</b> <b>learning,</b> and determine the relationship of the approach <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> on retention within {{an engineering}} program. 	The study was conducted using a quantitative self-reporting instrument to measure surface and deep learning at the beginning and end of the first and second semesters of the freshman year in an engineering program. Retention was measured as the continuous enrollment of a student in the second semester of the first-year engineering program. 	Results indicate that the first-year engineering students have a slightly higher level of the deep approach <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> than a surface approach <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> when they begin college. However, the results also indicate that the deep approach <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> decreased during the first semester and during the second semester of their freshman year. A student's approach <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> can be impacted by their prior knowledge, the teaching context, the institutional context or the motivation of the student. Results surrounding the learning strategies intervention also indicate that the first-year engineering students do not possess the strong learning strategies that are anticipated from students accepted into an engineering program with stringent application requirements. Finally, results indicate that a deep approach <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> appears <b>to</b> have a positive relationship and a surface approach <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> appears <b>to</b> have a negative relationship to retention in an engineering program. This study illustrates that incorporating learning theory and the use of current learning strategy measurements contributes to the understanding of a freshman engineering student's approach <b>to</b> <b>learning.</b> The understanding of the engineering student's approach <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> benefits faculty in establishing curriculum and pedagogical design.

The deep approach <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> is thought <b>to</b> be more effective for learning than surface approaches. In this study we determined how the approaches <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> of clerks and residents predicted the valued site and preceptor characteristics in the ambulatory setting. Methods Postal survey of all medical residents and clerks in training in Ontario determining the site and preceptor characteristics most valued in the ambulatory setting. Participants also completed the Workplace Learning questionnaire that includes 3 approaches <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> scales and 3 workplace climate scales. Multiple regression {{analysis was used to}} predict the preferred site and preceptor characteristics as the dependent variables by the average scores of the approaches <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> and perception of workplace climate scales as the independent variables. Results There were 1642 respondents, yielding a 47. 3 % response rate. Factor analysis revealed 7 preceptor characteristics and 6 site characteristics valued in the ambulatory setting.
