5|$|As {{the wing}} develops, the dorsal and ventral integumental layers become closely apposed {{over most of}} <b>their</b> <b>area</b> forming the wing membrane. The {{remaining}} areas form channels, the future veins, in which the nerves and tracheae may occur. The cuticle surrounding the veins becomes thickened and more heavily sclerotized to provide strength and rigidity to the wing. Two types of hair may occur on the wings: microtrichia, which are small and irregularly scattered, and macrotrichia, which are larger, socketed, and may be restricted to veins. The scales of Lepidoptera and Trichoptera are highly modified macrotrichia.|$|E

These new councils {{would be responsible for}} all services carried out by non-metropolitan district and county authorities within <b>their</b> <b>area,</b> thus resembling county boroughs.

5|$|In {{the first}} 20 {{years of the}} BAA/NBA, the league {{was still trying to}} gain the support of fans who lived in or near the teams' home markets. To achieve this, the league {{introduced}} the territorial pick rule to help teams acquire popular players from colleges in <b>their</b> <b>area</b> who would presumably have strong local support. Before the draft, a team could forfeit its first-round draft pick and then select any player from within a 50-mile radius of its home arena. Although the territorial picks were selected before the draft, these picks were not factored into the overall selection count of the draft; therefore, the first non-territorial pick of the draft was considered the first overall pick.|$|E
