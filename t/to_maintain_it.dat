5|$|Part of modern-day Route311 was {{originally}} the Philipstown Turnpike, a road built in 1815 {{to overcome a}} lack of transportation when the Hudson River froze during the winter months. The turnpike was a large business center for the county, though it was abandoned due to insufficient tolls <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>it.</b> Another section was constructed in the early 1900s, from the Patterson Baptist Church near the modern-day intersection of Route311 and Route164 to the Village of Patterson, {{by a group of}} Italian immigrants.|$|E
5|$|Several {{ownership}} schemes {{were considered}} {{in the process of}} building and running the system. One plan, which named city officials as the owners and operators of the network, was scrapped because the city lacked the core competency to do it on its own, as well as the $25–30 million capital investment required for the initial construction. The plan which was ultimately adopted entailed a private company building and running the network. This plan met opposition from the Institute for Local Self Reliance, an organization that stated that it believed that the city should build the network itself, and then contract a private company <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

50|$|Hazna Lake is an {{artificial}} lake in Gradačac, Bosnia and Herzegovina. It {{was built in}} 1967 after the Hazna River and the Vidara Lake flooded Gradačac in 1964 and 1967. The lake was first stocked with fish in 1967. A pontoon bridge was built a few years later. The lake was a popular attraction in Gradačac before the Bosnian War. After the war, very little care was devoted <b>to</b> <b>maintaining</b> <b>it,</b> and it quickly became contaminated. A few buildings surround the lake—a restaurant, a hotel still under construction, etc.|$|R
5|$|Trading {{continued}} {{throughout the}} medieval period {{evidenced by the}} importance of Torksey, which was then a flourishing town, now only a small village. However, the Fossdyke needed much maintenance to keep it clear of silt. Henry I had overseen the scouring of its channel, and there were inquiries in 1335, 1365 and 1518 to consider {{the state of the}} Fossdyke and to compel the inhabitants of the region <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>it.</b> Lincoln was a centre for the collection of business taxes, but this came at the cost of maintaining the waterways, and having finally decided it was too large a cost, James I presented the Fossdyke to the City of Lincoln.|$|E
5|$|Mandurah {{had grown}} rapidly {{as a tourist}} {{destination}} in the post war period, and on 17 April 1953 a new bridge connecting Old Coast Road to Mandurah was opened. Construction of the new bridge, adjacent to the old bridge, began in September 1951, and was designed with reinforced concrete piles. The old wooden bridge had rapidly deteriorated due {{to the presence of}} marine organisms, and needed considerable attention <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>it</b> in a usable condition. The opening ceremony was attended by the Chairman of the Mandurah Road Board, W. Anderson, Leader of the Opposition, Ross McLarty, Minister for Works, John Tonkin; Commissioner of Main Roads, Digby Leach; C. H. Henning, MLC; engineer in charges of bridges, Ernest Godfrey; local government representatives, and a number of schoolchildren who were given a half-day off school.|$|E
5|$|Rhodesia's Lisbon mission {{remained}} open {{throughout the}} late 1960s and early 1970s, providing a key {{link between the}} Rhodesian and Portuguese governments, which remained close. When Rhodesia adopted a republican constitution in 1970, Portugal bowed to British diplomatic pressure and withdrew its consul-general, João de Freitas Cruz, from Salisbury, but the Rhodesian office in Lisbon remained open. With the Carnation Revolution of 1974, Portugal's African policy was suddenly reversed. By contrast to the former authoritarian government, which had been committed to a pluricontinental Portugal, fighting costly wars against independence movements in its African territories <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>it,</b> the new leftist administration rapidly initiated moves to withdraw from Africa as quickly as possible. Following hurried negotiations between Portugal and the nationalist guerrillas in each territory, both Mozambique and Angola became independent under communist governments in 1975. Lisbon's stance on Rhodesia altered accordingly. The Portuguese government ordered {{the closure of the}} Rhodesian mission in April 1975, and simultaneously withdrew its own remaining officials from Rhodesia. The Rhodesian mission in Lisbon formally closed on 1 May 1975.|$|E

5|$|Like his father, Louis {{administered}} Hungary {{with absolute}} power and used royal prerogatives to grant privileges to his courtiers. However, he also confirmed the liberties of the Hungarian nobility at the Diet of 1351, emphasizing the equal status of all noblemen. At the same Diet, he introduced an entail {{system and a}} uniform rent payable by the peasants to the landowners, and confirmed the right to free movement for all peasants. He waged wars against the Lithuanians, Serbia, and the Golden Horde in the 1350s, restoring the authority of Hungarian monarchs over territories along frontiers that had been lost during previous decades. He forced the Republic of Venice to renounce the Dalmatian towns in 1358. He also made several attempts to expand his suzerainty over the rulers of Bosnia, Moldavia, Wallachia, and parts of Bulgaria and Serbia. These rulers were sometimes willing to yield to him, either under duress or {{in the hope of}} support against their internal opponents, but Louis's rule in these regions was only nominal during most of his reign. His attempts to convert his pagan or Orthodox subjects to Catholicism made him unpopular in the Balkan states. Louis established a university in Pécs in 1367, but it was closed within two decades because he did not arrange for sufficient revenues <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

50|$|Flattops are {{traditionally}} groomed with hair control wax, {{commonly referred to}} as butch wax. It should be noted that certain hair textures do not require waxes or straighteners <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> <b>it's</b> hold. Since the haircut is short and quickly grows out of its precisely-cut shape, maintenance haircuts are required at least every few weeks, and some flattop wearers get haircuts as often as once a week. Flattops have almost exclusively been worn by men and boys, being most popular among military men, athletes and blue collar workers.|$|R
