25|$|In this schema, {{three main}} {{prerequisites}} are posited for globalization to occur. The {{first is the}} idea of Eastern Origins, which shows how Western states have adapted and implemented learned principles from the East. Without the traditional ideas from the East, Western globalization would not have emerged <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>did.</b> The second is distance. The interactions amongst states were not on a global scale and most often were confined to Asia, North Africa, the Middle East, and certain parts of Europe. With early globalization, it was difficult for states to interact with others that were not within close proximity. Eventually, technological advances allowed states to learn of others' existence and another phase of globalization was able to occur. The third has to do with interdependency, stability, and regularity. If a state is not dependent on another, then there is no way for either state to be mutually affected by the other. This is one of the driving forces behind global connections and trade; without either, globalization would not have emerged <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> and states would still be dependent on their own production and resources to function. This is one of the arguments surrounding the idea of early globalization. It is argued that archaic globalization did not function in a similar manner to modern globalization because states were not as interdependent on others as they are today.|$|E
25|$|The {{defeat of}} Mahmud IV at Jenné has been {{attributed}} to several causes. Details are sparse on the nature of both armies. The overarching theme in why the battle turned out <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> revolves around the ability of each side to rally its forces. In few other instances are the effects of imperial collapse {{in the face of a}} changing political and military environment so well demonstrated. The Mali which faced off against the pashalik forces and its native allies was not the grand military of Mansa Musa. In fact, it had reversed back to its pre-imperial structure just at the time when leaps forward in technology and organization were essential to the empire’s survival.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} said that the bra took off <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> {{in large part because of}} World War I, which shook up gender roles by putting many women to work in {{factories}} and uniforms for the first time. The war also influenced social attitudes toward women and helped to liberate them from corsets. But women were already moving into the retail and clerical sectors. Thus the bra emerged from something that was once discreetly tucked into the back pages of women's magazines in the 1890s, to prominent display in department stores such as Sears, Roebuck, and Montgomery Ward by 1918. Advertising was now promoting the shaping of the bust to contemporary fashion demands, and sales reflected this.|$|E
25|$|Another {{reason for}} cricket's decline in {{popularity}} {{may be that}} in the late 19th century American cricket remained an amateur sport reserved for the wealthy while England and Australia were developing a professional version of the game. As cricket standards improved with professionalism {{elsewhere in the world}} many North American cricket clubs stayed stubbornly elitist. Clubs such as Philadelphia and Merion abandoned cricket and converted their facilities to other sports. Some city cricket clubs unknowingly contributed to their own demise by sponsoring auxiliary baseball teams. By 1900 baseball had taken over the American scene and created its independent mythology. The formation of the Imperial Cricket Conference in 1909 also helped to keep the popularity of the game down. It certainly undercut any momentum to professionalize cricket in the USA, although whether the momentum would have developed even {{in the presence of a}} more open ICC remains a question. Regardless of its cause, the game did not flourish in the United States <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> in the British Empire. From the 1880s until the outbreak of World War I, the American game was dominated not by the national side, but by an amateur team from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.|$|E

500|$|Despite careful preparations, {{patience}} and remedial {{efforts by the}} overseeing Precursors, {{it became apparent that}} the Forerunners were grossly unworthy of their inheritance, to the extent of becoming a direct threat to the Mantle itself. Eventually, the Precursors reached the limit of their patience, and determined that to protect the Mantle, the Forerunners must be reserved for utter destruction. However, the Forerunners discovered the Precursors' intentions before they could be carried out, and in defiance, hunted the Precursors to the verge of extinction. Surviving Precursors proceeded to protect their own continued existence, by reducing themselves to a biological powder which would regenerate their past selves when the time was right. However, time rendered the powder defective, and it became mutagenic, reacting with other living organisms to produce what would eventually mutate into the Flood. The sole surviving Precursor who discovered this catastrophic failure of the final solution, remarked that as the Precursors' destruction would be permanent, it was [...] "good" [...] that the solution failed in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>did,</b> as the Flood would insure that none of their creations would persist to threaten the Mantle. The Flood was unleashed upon the galaxy, its first target being a space-faring civilization of prehistoric humans.|$|E

It is just a pity he didn't take care that it didn't happen". Elf was also unhappy with {{the way in which the}} episode had been handled, the company's Commercial Director Michel Bonnet declaring that [...] "We believe the FIA acted in a high-handed manner in disqualifying our two cars so quickly. It should have declared the results provisional and waited for the results of further analysis. Acting <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>did,</b> the FIA has affected the image of large industrial companies, of top F1 teams and of famous drivers. The fact that we have been treated as cheats by a red team – probably red with embarrassment at having finished one lap behind our cars – and by Gerhard Berger is a serious slur against us." [...] Elf also threatened to take the matter to a tribunal if the cars were not reinstated. Company representative Valerie Jorquera also highlighted the need for a consistent chromatographic analysis of fuel samples, drawing attention to the fact that the samples provided during the event had been analysed by a different company than the reference sample, and that the differences may have been caused by the use of different analytical machines and methods. The incident was seen as unfortunate for the sport, which was trying to make a fresh start after several controversies the previous year. From the San Marino Grand Prix onwards, an FIA mobile fuel laboratory accompanied the teams to each event to permit more detailed testing at the track, in addition to ensuring consistency between events.|$|E
