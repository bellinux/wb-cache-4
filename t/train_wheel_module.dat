Sheldon Brown wrote that <b>training</b> <b>wheels</b> can become an obstacle to learning if they are adjusted incorrectly, because they prevent the bike from leaning if they are too low, and can inhibit braking if too much weight is taken off the rear <b>wheel</b> by <b>training</b> <b>wheels</b> that are too low. Adjusting <b>training</b> <b>wheels</b> correctly, and raising them higher as the child's skill increases, avoids these problems. [...] Alternatives to using <b>training</b> <b>wheels</b> include removing the pedals from a child's bike, or balance bicycles.|$|R

40|$|The {{conditions}} of a secure loss of stability of a two-axle wheel vehicle with absolutely hard steering {{have been found}} before. The analytically derived {{conditions of}} a secure stability loss in case of torsional stiffness are dependent {{on the relationship between}} the slipping resistance coefficients, the transverse clutch coefficients on the axes, and the torsional stiffness of the controlled <b>wheel</b> <b>module.</b> In this case, the trail distance is taken into account in the <b>wheel</b> <b>module</b> control system, the mass of the module being neglected. The approach suggested in the paper does take into account the mass of the controlled <b>wheel</b> <b>module.</b> The slipping forces are presented accurate to a cubic term of expansion in slipping angles. The torsional stiffness intervals have been found that provide a secure loss of stability of a two-axle wheel vehicle model. The intervals have been obtained {{on the basis of a}} bifurcation analysis of actual bifurcations of the stationary states in the vicinity of the rectilinear motion of the model. Diagrams that illustrate the fulfillment of secure stability loss conditions and allow using the results obtained in designing a <b>wheel</b> <b>module</b> are presented in the paper. The technique used is alternative to the well-known M. Bautin’s approach to determination of secure-insecure conditions in case of a divergent loss of stability. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} method to {{recognize}} a complicated curved object from an image contour. We are developing a system that automatically measures <b>train</b> <b>wheel</b> abrasion from its contour image. Because a <b>train</b> <b>wheel</b> consists of a curved surface, {{the transformation of the}} image contour due to position variation affects the measurement accuracy. The 3 D shape model of the <b>train</b> <b>wheel</b> is analyzed to compute on image contour model represented with a numerical equation. The system corrects the measured value using the relation between position variation and contour model. Experimental result shows that the system can measure <b>train</b> <b>wheel</b> abrasion with an objective accuracy. ...|$|R
5000|$|Manufacturers {{of balance}} {{bicycles}} say {{that children can}} learn to bicycle faster because they learn to balance and countersteer first and then to pedal later, and that <b>training</b> <b>wheels</b> slow learning because kids become too dependent on them, acquiring bad habits. Pediatricians [...] {{say that there is}} no evidence that children learn to bike faster without <b>training</b> <b>wheels.</b> <b>Training</b> <b>wheels</b> that prevent the bike from leaning also prevent countersteering, so that, as with a tricycle, kids learn to turn the handlebars the wrong way, which must be unlearned later. Sheldon Brown wrote that <b>training</b> <b>wheels</b> can become an obstacle to learning if they are adjusted incorrectly, because they prevent the bike from leaning if they are too low, and can inhibit braking if too much weight is taken off the rear <b>wheel</b> by <b>training</b> <b>wheels</b> that are too low. Adjusting <b>training</b> <b>wheels</b> correctly, and raising them higher as the child's skill increases, avoids these problems. Balance bikes with no brakes at all except the rider's feet might stop poorly as well, though very young children might not use brakes effectively anyway. Brown recommended simply removing the pedals from a normal kid's bicycle, avoiding the extra expense of a balance bike, and parents have had success with this approach.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} a SAW sensor unit for <b>train</b> <b>wheel</b> monitoring. On board health monitoring of <b>train</b> <b>wheel</b> is important for safe operation of high-speed railway system. Defects on <b>train</b> <b>wheel</b> may cause a crucial accident of train so that a real time monitoring is necessary. Difficulty in monitoring, however, is the rotation of wheel. When several strain sensors are installed on the wheel the sensor signals should be sent out to the train. In this paper, a remote strain sensor for the monitoring of <b>train</b> <b>wheel</b> will be presented. The strain sensor is based on surface acoustic wave, and the issues on design, manufacturing, and test of the sensor will be addressed. This research is a proof-of concept stage, and problems for further research will be mentioned...|$|R

30|$|Although {{there are}} a plenty of {{researches}} on vibration response and sound radiation of a <b>train</b> <b>wheel,</b> the effects of wheel rotation have not been adequately addressed. It has recently demonstrated in Ref. [12] that, at high speeds the rotation of a wheel has {{a significant effect on}} wheel dynamics. From this, it would be expected that the rotation of the wheel may also have an important effect on sound radiation. In other words, for a <b>train</b> <b>wheel</b> moving at high speeds, wheel rotation should be considered when performing vibro-acoustic analyses for the wheel.|$|R
