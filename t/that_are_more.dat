Crop varieties that are resistant to pests and diseases can reduce the need for application of harmfulpesticides.While crops <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> vigorous can better compete withweeds whichreduces the need for applyingherbicides. This is shown in a case study completed atAarhus Universityin Denmark which used more robust maize.Drought resistant plants can help save water and reduce the need forirrigation whiledeeper rooting varieties can help stabilize soils; and varieties <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> efficient in their use of nutrients require lessfertilizer.|$|E
5|$|Ascocoryne cylichnium, {{another small}} and {{gelatinous}} violet-colored species, has apothecia <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> often cup-shaped, and has larger spores—20–24 by 5.5–6µm. Because of its {{resemblance to the}} jelly fungi, A.sarcoides has been mistaken for the basidiomycete species Auricularia auricula and Tremella foliacea. T.foliacea is larger, brown, and leafy in appearance. Auricularia auricula is also larger, typically brown, is disc- or ear-shaped, with a ribbed undersurface. Microscopically, Tremella foliacea and Auricularia auricula are easily distinguished from A.sarcoides {{by the presence of}} basidia (rather than asci).|$|E
5|$|Banksia integrifolia subsp. monticola: Commonly {{known as}} white {{mountain}} banksia, {{it is the}} only subspecies with a montane distribution; it occurs in the Blue Mountains of northern New South Wales.

5|$|The American {{alligator}} {{was first}} classified by French zoologist François Marie Daudin as Crocodilus mississipiensis in 1801. In 1807 Georges Cuvier created the genus Alligator; the American alligator shares this genus with the Chinese alligator. They are grouped {{in the family}} Alligatoridae with the caimans. The superfamily Alligatoroidea includes all crocodilians (fossil and extant) <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> {{closely related to the}} American alligator than to either the Nile crocodile or the gharial.|$|E
5|$|The {{migration}} of many birds in Australia, including honeyeaters, {{has generally been}} described as occurring mainly in response to external environmental stimuli, such as food availability or an influx of water. However, the yellow-faced honeyeater {{has been found to}} have a broad range of characteristics <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> often associated with Northern Hemisphere migrants. These are an annual cycle of migratory restlessness, seasonally appropriate orientation based on magnetic, solar and polarised light cues, and a migration program based on the magnetic inclination compass.|$|E
5|$|Using light microscopy, {{the spores}} of Calvatia craniiformis are {{generally}} indistinguishable {{from those of}} C.rubroflava and C.gigantea; electron microscopy reveals that each has distinctive spore ornamentation. C.craniiformis features small, well-separated verrucae (wartlike projections) up to 0.2μm tall with rounded tips. In comparison, C.gigantea has larger verrucae (up to 0.4μm tall) <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> irregularly arranged.|$|E

5|$|Vinegar is {{typically}} 4–18% acetic acid by mass. Vinegar is used directly as a condiment, {{and in the}} pickling of vegetables and other foods. Table vinegar {{tends to be more}} diluted (4% to 8% acetic acid), while commercial food pickling employs solutions <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> concentrated. The proportion of acetic acid used worldwide as vinegar is not as large as commercial uses, but is by far the oldest and best-known application.|$|E
5|$|Abdominal {{segments}} 3–6 and 10 each bear {{a pair of}} legs <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> fleshy. The thoracic {{legs are}} known as true legs and the abdominal legs are called prolegs. The true legs vary little in the Lepidoptera except for reduction in certain leaf-miners and elongation in the family Notodontidae. The prolegs contain {{a number of small}} hooks on the tip, which are known as crochets. The families of Lepidoptera differ in the number and positioning of their prolegs. Some larvae such as inchworms (Geometridae) and loopers (Plusiinae) have five pairs of prolegs or less, while others like Lycaenidae and slug caterpillars (Limacodidae) lack prolegs altogether. In some leaf-mining caterpillars there are crochets present on the abdominal wall which are reduced prolegs, while other leaf-mining species lack the crochets entirely. The abdominal spiracles are located {{on each side of the}} body on the first eight abdominal segments.|$|E
5|$|Archaea and {{bacteria}} are generally similar {{in size and}} shape, although a few archaea have very strange shapes, such as the flat and square-shaped cells of Haloquadratum walsbyi. Despite this morphological similarity to bacteria, archaea possess genes and several metabolic pathways <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> closely related to those of eukaryotes, notably the enzymes involved in transcription and translation. Other aspects of archaeal biochemistry are unique, such as their reliance on ether lipids in their cell membranes, including archaeols. Archaea use more energy sources than eukaryotes: these range from organic compounds, such as sugars, to ammonia, metal ions or even hydrogen gas. Salt-tolerant archaea (the Haloarchaea) use sunlight as an energy source, and other species of archaea fix carbon; however, unlike plants and cyanobacteria, no known species of archaea does both. Archaea reproduce asexually by binary fission, fragmentation, or budding; unlike bacteria and eukaryotes, no known species forms spores.|$|E

5|$|Banksia menziesii regenerates after bushfire by resprouting {{from its}} woody lignotuber, or from epicormic buds on the trunk. It is {{generally}} only weakly serotinous {{in the southern}} part of its range, that is, it lacks a canopy seed bank as follicles on old flower spikes in the canopy release their seed after two years, but populations retain more seed as populations move north. Lower canopies and drier climates predispose to hotter fires <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> likely to kill plants and effect seed release, and thus facilitate seedling recruitment.|$|E
5|$|Cnidarians form {{an animal}} phylum <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> complex than sponges, about {{as complex as}} ctenophores (comb jellies), and less complex than bilaterians, which include almost all other animals. However, both cnidarians and ctenophores are more complex than sponges as they have: cells bound by inter-cell {{connections}} and carpet-like basement membranes; muscles; nervous systems; and some have sensory organs. Cnidarians are distinguished from all other animals by having cnidocytes that fire like harpoons and are used mainly to capture prey. In some species, cnidocytes {{can also be used}} as anchors.|$|E
5|$|Comcast's {{office space}} was {{designed}} by Daroff Design + DDI Architects and Gensler. Comcast's space is topped by a conference room floor with the executive offices on the four floors below it. Below <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> offices and then, on the 43rd and 44th floors, is Ralph's Cafe, a two-story cafeteria space named after the company founder Ralph J. Roberts. Below the cafe is the training center called Comcast University. The rest of the space is used for content and programing teams, customer service, Technology & Product teams, Finance and Legal. The interior design of the offices are designed {{with a variety of}} shape and color ranging from the open white space of the upper offices to the colorful walls of the training center. Other designs include a glass and stainless steel staircase that wraps around a four-story column of flat-screen monitors and connects the executive floors.|$|E

5|$|Like most RPGs, the Final Fantasy {{installments}} use {{an experience}} level system for character advancement, in which experience points are accumulated by killing enemies. Character classes, specific jobs that enable unique abilities for characters, are another recurring theme. Introduced {{in the first}} game, character classes have been used differently in each title. Some restrict a character to a single job to integrate it into the story, while other games feature dynamic job systems that allow the player to choose from multiple classes and switch throughout the game. Though used heavily in many games, such systems have become less prevalent in favor of characters <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> versatile; characters still match an archetype, but are able to learn skills outside their class.|$|E
