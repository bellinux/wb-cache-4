40|$|The flow {{dynamics}} (<b>tray</b> <b>hydraulics)</b> are of key {{importance for}} the initial dynamic response of distillation columns. The most important parameters are the liquid holdup, the liquid hydraulic time constant and the vapor constant representing the initial effect {{of a change in}} vapor flow on liquid flow. In the paper we present methods for determining these parameters experimentally, and compare the results with estimates from available correlations such as the Francis Weir formula...|$|E
40|$|To column control, in {{contrast}} to column design, tray hold-up and dependencies of tray hold-up on the operating conditions play an important role. The essence {{of this article is}} the development of an improved model of <b>tray</b> <b>hydraulics</b> over a broad operating range and its experimental validation by means of batch distillation. First, the column dynamics are related to tray column design parameters and operating conditions. The model parameters are fitted by column residence time measurements. Two tray load regimes are distinguished: an aeration regime and an obstruction regime. At low column load a vapour increase will decrease the tray mass since the liquid is driven out by larger aeration. At high load the opposite is the case, since the liquid is driven up by stowage. The resulting dynamic behaviour is studied by linearising the rigorous tray model in an operating point. Especially the influence of the vapour flow on the column dynamics is investigated. For the influence of the tray composition change on the molar mass, a new composition-shift parameter κ is defined. The influence appeared to be small...|$|E
40|$|The need of {{maximizing the}} {{economic}} benefits of a distillation unit often requires operating close to its capacity limits. The limits of an operating column depend on the internal vapor and liquid flows and their physical properties. In this thesis, distillation modelling in a dynamic process simulator was improved to consider internal phenomena in a distillation column i. e. <b>tray</b> <b>hydraulics.</b> The structure of the original distillation model was first reconsidered. In the developed model, separate flash separators were used to represent an active area and a downcomer of a tray. The hydraulic phenomena included in the model were jet flooding, downcomer backup flooding, downcomer choke flooding and weeping. Downcomer backup flooding occurred in the model automatically due to the model structure and configuration. To represent the other hydraulic phenomena in the model, correlations were used. These correlations were rationalized based on the literature study. For determining the limit values, at which each phenomenon begins, and maximum jet flooding and downcomer choke flooding occurs in a specific distillation column, Koch-Glitsch’s KG-TOWER software was utilized. The developed distillation model was first implemented in the dynamic process simulator with fixed pressure, and jet flooding, downcomer choke flooding and weeping occurring only on one tray. The liquid flow rates, pressures and levels of the tanks were also calculated manually with a spreadsheet, and simulation results were compared to those to verify {{the accuracy of the}} simulation model. After ensuring the reasonable function of the correlations, the calculation of the correlations was implemented in the simulator code by programming. For more extensive examination, the model was implemented in a distillation game model. The function of the model was studied by varying the reboiler duty, feed rate and reflux rate. The simulation results showed that some oscillation occurs easily both in flooding and in weeping. To ensure the stability in all situations, the model configuration needs further examination. All the hydraulic phenomena did, however, occur in the model according to implemented calculation as assumed...|$|E
