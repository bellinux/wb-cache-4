50|$|CLEVER employs an {{electronically}} {{controlled and}} hydraulically actuated Direct Tilt Control {{system with a}} maximum tilt angle of ±45° 6. A pair of single acting hydraulic actuators generate a <b>tilting</b> <b>moment</b> about the tilt bearing (which joins the cabin and rear module). The tilt controller uses driver’s steer input and the vehicle’s speed to estimate the lateral acceleration and hence the appropriate tilt angle. The DTC system provides excellent stability at low speeds but during vigorous manoeuvres at higher speeds the system’s torque output exceeds that which can be reacted by the non-tilting rear module; {{as a result the}} inside rear wheel lifts, this can lead to the vehicle rolling over.|$|E
5000|$|By {{reducing}} {{the severity of}} the driver’s steer inputs, or indeed initiating countersteer, the active steering system delays the onset of lateral acceleration and reduces the moment necessary for the DTC actuators to tilt the cabin of the vehicle into the corner. This reduced <b>tilting</b> <b>moment</b> benefits both vehicle stability and energy consumption. Simulation results show a significant reduction in load transfer across the rear axle. In 2014 experimental results were published showing a 40% reduction in the load transfer across the rear axle during a severe ramp steer manoeuvre conducted at 10 m/s and showing that the combined SDTC strategy became more effective at higher speeds [...] In the same article, it is noted that the whilst the driver of a SDTC equipped vehicle is subject to an additional under-steer sensation during harsh transient manoeuvres, this does not inhibit his/her ability to control the vehicle’s trajectory.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper was}} {{accepted}} for publication in the journal International Journal of Solids and Structures and the definitive published version is available at [URL] the present paper we explore the response of a half-plane indented by a tilted flat punch with sharp corners {{in the context of}} couple-stress elasticity theory. Contact conditions arise in a number of modern engineering applications ranging from structural and geotechnical engineering to micro and nanotechnology. As the contact scales reduce progressively the effects of the microstructure upon the macroscopic material response cannot be ignored. The generalized continuum theory of couple-stress elasticity introduces characteristic material lengths in order to describe the pertinent scale effects that emerge from the underlying material microstructure. The problem under investigation is interesting for three reasons: Firstly, the indentor's geometry is simple so that benchmark results may be extracted. Secondly, important deterioration of the macroscopic results may emerge in the case that a <b>tilting</b> <b>moment</b> is applied on the indentor inadvertently or in the case that the flat punch itself is not self-aligning so that asymmetrical contact pressure distributions arise on the contact faces. Thirdly, the voluntary application of a <b>tilting</b> <b>moment</b> on the flat punch during an experiment gives rise to potential capabilities of the flat punch for the determination of the material microstructural characteristic lengths. The solution methodology is based on singular integral equations which have resulted from a treatment of the mixed boundary value problem via integral transforms and generalized functions.

At the same time, to simulate the wind turbine loads, a dynamic model of three-bladed upwind {{horizontal axis wind turbine}} is built.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a dynamic model for slipper-pads which allows lift and tilt behaviour to be predicted, including {{the effects of}} possible contact with the swashplate or slipper retaining plate. This model has been incorporated in the Bathfp simulation package and {{used to examine the}} dynamic stability of slipper-pads over the pumping cycle, and to compare the behaviour over a range of pump speeds. The centripetal <b>tilting</b> <b>moments</b> acting on the slipper-pad increase with speed and as a consequence can lead to contact between the slipper and the swashplate at high speed. This is particularly likely to occur as the piston makes the transition between suction and delivery, where the pressure forces acting on the piston-slipper assembly change abruptly. The predicted nature of the swashplate contacts at high speeds correspond closely with witness marks on a dismantled pump. The model presented may also be used for predicting slipper behaviour in other types of pump, for example wobble-plate type pumps, or in piston motor...|$|R
40|$|When {{manufacturing}} {{axial piston}} pumps, mass difference of piston-slipper assembly is inevitable because of manufacturing precision limits. Small mass difference may not cause problems when the pump operates at low speeds, while it cannot be ignored at high speeds. One problem related to high speed is the cylinder block tilt {{resulting from the}} inertial effect of piston-slipper assembly. Recently, the speed of electro-hydrostatic actuator (EHA) pump in aircraft can reach more than 10, 000 rpm. Therefore, mass difference of pistonslipper assembly {{should be taken into}} account in future EHA pump design. The main {{purpose of this paper is}} to investigate the effect of the mass difference of piston-slipper assembly on the cylinder block tilt in a high-speed EHA pump. A detailed set of relevant equations is developed to establish the relationship between the mass difference of piston-slipper assembly and cylinder block <b>tilting</b> <b>moment.</b> It is found that a tighter control over the mass difference of piston-slipper assembly should be guaranteed when it comes to high-speed EHA pumps...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} work {{on early}} detection of space launch vehicle failures {{that could lead to}} loss of control during ascent. The particular focus is on the Solid Rocket Motor (SRM) comprising First Stage of the Crew Launch Vehicle (CLV). Some of the most important failure modes leading to loss of vehicle control are caused by hot gases ejected from the SRM combustion chamber through a case breach, through a joint between SRM segments, through a nozzle joint, or through an igniter seal. These hot gases create lateral thrust augmentation, with the resulting <b>tilting</b> <b>moment</b> possibly leading to loss of control. By using Thrust Vector Control (TVC) gimballing of the main nozzle, the flight control system tries to counter any attitude disturbance, which could mask the moment augmentation till it overwhelms the TVC and the control authority is lost. The approach proposed and demonstrated in a medium-fidelity simulation of the rocket dynamics employs continuous model-based multivariable estimation and monitoring of the augmentation forces and moments for {{early detection of}} the failure.

The system incorporates spherical supports for the base, a specially designed spring-cam system to keep the base rigidly supported under normal conditions and {{to allow it to}} move {{for the duration of the}} earthquake under the constraint of a spring with optimized stiffness characteristics. A single degree of freedom structure was considered to investigate the feasibility of the concept. The simulation of the system response shows a 20 times reduction of the transmitted force as a result of using the proposed design in the considered case. This paper extends the previous study to the case a 3 story concrete structure subjected to the Taft as well as El Centro earthquakes. A 11. 5 and 17 times reduction of the maximum transmitted force was achieved for the considered disturbances respectively without any adverse effects due to the <b>tilting</b> <b>moment</b> which is inherent in this type of base isolation. Since the system performance is highly dependent on the rapid unlocking of the cams in the event of a seismic disturbance, careful consideration should be given to the design of a reliable cam release control. This can be achieved by spring loading each cam such that it would be normally unlocked. A hydraulic actuator would be used to force it rotate to the locking position under fluid pressure which would be constantly maintained at the design level during normal conditions. The actuator would be equipped with a quick response release valve for rapidly releasing the pressure and consequently unlocking the cam as soon as an earthquake is detected...|$|E

The literature contains various analyses of seals having orderly face patterns (radial taper, waves, spiral grooves, etc.). These are useful for design purposes and for performance predictions.

40|$|Narrow tilting {{vehicles}} {{offer an}} opportunity to tackle both traffic congestion and carbon emissions having a small footprint, low weight and small frontal area. Their narrow width requires that they tilt into corners {{in order to maintain}} stability; this may be achieved by means of an automated tilt control system. A three-wheeled tilting vehicle prototype, known as the Compact Low Emission Vehicle for uRban transport (CLEVER), was constructed at the University of Bath in 2006. The vehicle was equipped with a direct tilt control system in which a pair of hydraulic actuators applied a moment between the cabin and a non-tilting base. This tilt control system provided satisfactory steady state performance but limited transient stability. High tilt rate demands associated with rapid steering inputs would lead to large tilting moments being applied to the non-tilting rear engine module; this, combined with the engine module’s own propensity to roll out of the bend, could cause the inside wheel to lift and the vehicle to capsize. This thesis details the implementation of a Steering Direct Tilt Control (SDTC) system, whereby the front wheel steer angle is used to generate some of the <b>tilting</b> <b>moment,</b> on the prototype CLEVER Vehicle. Simulation and experimental results are presented which show a 40 % reduction in load transfer across the rear axle during a transient ramp steer manoeuvre. The influence of the SDTC system, and associated steer angle alteration, on the vehicle trajectory is considered. A human driver is found to be capable of adapting their steer inputs such that they can follow their chosen path. Finally, a feed-forward control strategy is shown to reduce the load transfer across the rear axle by an additional 30 % in transient situations, but only if the steer input signal is sufficiently free of noise...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} use of {{disturbance}} models {{in the design of}} wind turbine individual pitch controllers. Previous work has used individual pitch control and disturbance models with the Multiblade Coordinate Transfor-mation to design controllers that reduce the blade loads at the frequencies associated with the rotor speed. This paper takes a similar approach of using a disturbance model within the H 1 design framework to account for peri-odic loading effects. The controller is compared with a baseline design that does not include the periodic disturbance model. In constant wind speeds, the disturbance model design is significantly better than the baseline de-sign at canceling blade loads at the rotor frequencies. However, these load reduction improvements become negligible even under low turbulent wind conditions. The two controllers perform similarly in turbulent wind condi-tions because disturbance augmentation improves load reduction only at the multiples of the rotor frequency in the yaw and <b>tilt</b> <b>moment</b> channels whereas turbulence creates strong collective bending moments. In addition, turbulent wind contains energy across a broad frequency spectrum and improvements at multiples of the rotor frequency are less important in these conditions. Therefore inclusion of periodic disturbance models in the control design may not lead to the expected load reduction in fielded wind turbines...|$|R

40|$|This article {{proceeds}} with investigations on a 5 [*]MW direct-drive floating {{wind turbine}} system (FWTDD) that was developed in a previous study. A fully integrated land-based direct-drive wind turbine system (WTDD) was created using SIMPACK, a multi-body simulation tool, to model the necessary response variables. The comparison of blade pitch control action and torque behaviour with a similar land-based direct-drive model in HAWC 2 (an aero-elastic simulation tool) confirmed that the dynamic feedback effects can be ignored. The main shaft displacements, air-gap eccentricity, forces due to unbalanced magnetic pull (UMP) and the main bearing loads were identified as the main response variables. The investigations then proceed with a two-step de-coupled approach for the detailed drive-train analysis in WTDD and FWTDD systems. The global motion responses and drive-train loads were extracted from HAWC 2 and fed to stand-alone direct-drive generator models in SIMPACK. The main response variables of WTDD and FWTDD system were compared. The FWTDD drive-train was observed to endure additional excitations at wave and platform pitch frequencies, thereby increasing the axial components of loads and displacements.

The propeller blade is pitched harmonically one cycle per propeller revolution which results in vehicle control forces and moments, termed cyclic-control.

An alternative solution, when the cyclic-blade angle function {{is limited to a}} sinusoidal cycle, is in terms of Bessel functions. An estimate of non-steady azimuth angle change or lag is presented. Cyclic-control analysis applied to the counter-rotating propeller shows that control forces or moments can be uniquely isolated from each other.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ten Pd-Ag frameworks were tested over two master models with: 1) parallel vertical implants, and 2) tilted distal implants. Strain gauges were fixed on the abutments of each master model to measure the deformation when a static load of 50 N was applied on the cantilever (15 mm). The deformation values were measured when the metallic frameworks were tested over three, four or five abutments, and transformed into force and bending moment values. Data were analyzed by ANOVA and Tukey's test for multiple comparisons at 5 % level of significance. RESULTS: Abutment # 1 (adjacent to the cantilever) had the highest values of force and sagittal bending moment for all tests with three, four or five abutments.

40|$|Wind {{turbines}} used in {{the electricity}} production nowadays are extremely large systems. Due to the increased sizes of the wind turbines, varying loads affecting on the turbine have became more significant. These changing loads are mainly caused by the variations in the wind speed experienced by the turbine. Wind shear, describing {{the increase in the}} wind speed from bottom to upper in the height, can be regarded as the main reason to the changing loads of the blades and the top of the turbine. This loading can be alleviated significantly by individual pitch control, which means that the pitch angle of each blade is controlled individually; in a way that aerodynamic force is kept constant during a revolution. In the commercial wind turbines, collective pitch control is used to limit the output power of the turbine above the rated wind speeds and the turbines are already equipped with individual pitch actuators. This makes the implementation of individual pitch control rather simple. In addition to the wind shear, tower shadow, describing the decrease in the wind speed experienced by the blade when it is {{directly in front of the}} tower, has also some impact on the wind turbine loading. The scope of this thesis is on the pitch control of the wind turbine blades. However, wind turbines and wind characteristics as well as the wind turbine control in general are discussed briefly at the beginning of this thesis. Simulations within this thesis are made for the NREL’s 5 MW reference turbine by using the wind turbine simulation software FAST. Simulations can be divided into three different topics. First, performance of the collective pitch controller in the extreme wind conditions as well as the effect of wind shear on the wind turbine loading in the case of this controller are evaluated. Then, different individual pitch control schemes for the wind shear compensation are implemented and evaluated. Finally, the effect of tower shadow on the wind turbine loading is evaluated and different methods striving to compensate it are implemented. The study indicates that the loads caused by wind shear can be decreased significantly by individual pitch control. All methods described within this thesis are able to alleviate the loading of the blades as well as the static component of the <b>tilt</b> and yaw <b>moments</b> at some rate. On the other hand, fluctuating components of the <b>tilt</b> and yaw <b>moments</b> are decreased only when the reduction of the 2 P load component in the blade loads is also considered in the IPC algorithm. On the other hand, comprehensive reduction of the loading caused by tower shadow seems to be challenging. However, the effect of the tower shadow is also less significant than the effect of wind shear. This study has been made as a part of the larger project for the ABB Corporate Research Center in Germany...|$|R
60|$|These men {{of course}} {{knew nothing of}} the poignant little drama which had been enacted inside the coach. All they knew {{was that they had}} been {{surrounded}} by a rough crowd--a hundred or so strong--who brandished scythes and spades, that they had made valiant efforts to break through the crowd by whipping up their horses, but that suddenly some of those devils more plucky than the others seized the horses by their bits and rendered poor Jean-Marie quite helpless. He thought then that all would be up with the lot of them and was thinking of scrambling down from his box in order to protect Mademoiselle with his body, and the pistols which he had in the boot, when happily for every one concerned, he heard in the distance--above the clatter which that abominable rabble was making, the hurried tramp of horses. At once he jumped to the conclusion that these could be none other than a company of soldiers sent by M. le duc. This spurred him to a fresh effort, and gave him a new idea. To Carmail the postilion who had a pistol in his holster he gave the peremptory order to fire a shot into the air or into the crowd, Jean-Marie cared not which. This Carmail did, and at once the horses, already maddened by the crowd, plunged and reared wildly, shaking themselves free. Jean-Marie, however, had them well in hand, and from far away there came the cries of encouragement from the advancing horsemen who were bearing down on them full <b>tilt.</b> The next <b>moment</b> there was a general mêlée. Jean-Marie saw nothing save his horses' heads, but the outriders declared that men were trampled down like flies all around, while others vanished into the night.|$|R
40|$|We {{analyze the}} causes of the century-long {{increase}} in geomagnetic activity, quantified by annual means of the aa index, using observations of interplanetary space, galactic cosmic rays, the ionosphere, and the auroral electrojet, made during the last three solar cycles. The effects of changes in ionospheric conductivity, the Earth's dipole <b>tilt,</b> and magnetic <b>moment</b> are shown to be small; only changes in near-Earth interplanetary space make a significant contribution to the long-term increase in activity. We study the effects of the interplanetary medium by applying dimensional analysis to generate the optimum solar wind-magnetosphere energy coupling function, having an unprecedentedly high correlation coefficient of 0. 97. Analysis of the terms of the coupling function shows that the largest contributions to the drift in activity over solar cycles 20 - 22 originate from rises in the average interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) strength, solar wind concentration, and speed; average IMF orientation has grown somewhat less propitious for causing geomagnetic activity. The combination of these factors explains almost all of the 39 % rise in aa observed over the last three solar cycles. Whereas the IMF strength varies approximately in phase with sunspot numbers, neither its orientation nor the solar wind density shows any coherent solar cycle variation. The solar wind speed peaks strongly in the declining phase of even-numbered cycles and can be identified as the chief cause of the phase shift between the sunspot numbers and the aa index. The rise in the IMF magnitude, the largest single contributor to the drift in geomagnetic activity, is shown to be caused by a rise in the solar coronal magnetic field, consistent with a rise in the coronal source field, modeled from photospheric observations, and an observed decay in cosmic ray fluxes...|$|R
