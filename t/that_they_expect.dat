The few authors who express serious doubt about it include [...] who lists some reasons for being skeptical, and [...] who flatly states that he believes it is false, {{and that there is}} no evidence whatever for it and no imaginable reason that it would be true. The consensus of the survey articles ( [...] , , and [...] ) is that the evidence for it is strong but not overwhelming, so that while it is probably true there is some reasonable doubt about it.|$|E
2500|$|The {{advantages}} of licensure vary depending upon location. For example, in the United States and Canada [...] "only a licensed engineer may seal engineering work for {{public and private}} clients". This requirement is enforced by state and provincial legislation such as Quebec's Engineers Act. In other countries, no such legislation exists. Practically all certifying bodies maintain {{a code of ethics}} <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>expect</b> all members to abide by or risk expulsion. In this way these organizations {{play an important role in}} maintaining ethical standards for the profession. Even in jurisdictions where certification has little or no legal bearing on work, engineers are subject to contract law. In cases where an engineer's work fails he or she may be subject to the tort of negligence and, in extreme cases, the charge of criminal negligence. An engineer's work must also comply with numerous other rules and regulations, such as building codes and legislation pertaining to environmental law.|$|E

Harmonix stated that they amended their employee policy to require them to identify their employment at Harmonix as part of such reviews or to remove them, and stated the posted reviews were [...] "inappropriate actions". Separately, PlayStation 4 users of Rock Band 4 in Europe were unable to download some of their previously purchased DLC from the PlayStation Store, at least four weeks after the game's launch. Mad Catz stated that the issue stemmed from technical and licensing difficulties between the various countries served by the European PlayStation Store. Harmonix affirmed there were issues with more than 400 existing songs due to difficulties with licensing between them and Sony Computer Entertainment Europe but <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>expect</b> to have these available by early December 2015. Harmonix was finally able to confirm the licensing problems were resolved by December 2016, and anticipates the missing tracks will be available by May 2017.|$|E

2500|$|The name {{videophone}} {{is not as}} standardized as {{its earlier}} counterpart, the telephone, resulting {{in a variety of}} names and terms being used worldwide, and even within the same region or country. [...] Videophones are also known as videotelephones (or video telephones) and often by an early trademarked name [...] "Picturephone", which was the world's first commercial videophone produced in volume. The compound name [...] "videophone" [...] slowly entered into general use after 1950, although [...] "video telephone" [...] likely entered the lexicon earlier after [...] "video" [...] was coined in 1935. Videophone calls (also: videocalls and video chat), differ from videoconferencing in <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>expect</b> to serve individuals, not groups. However that distinction has become increasingly blurred with technology improvements such as increased bandwidth and sophisticated software clients that can allow for multiple parties on a call. In general everyday usage the term videoconferencing is now frequently used instead of videocall for point-to-point calls between two units. Both videophone calls and videoconferencing are also now commonly referred to as a video link.|$|E

How thankful I am that we fortunate ones are exempt from this. Yet in my way I, too, try to think a bit about what is going on; and I don't want to be too gloomy, or to ignore some good in all this ferment in men's minds. It is better than stagnation and indolent respectability. There is everywhere a consciousness of a vast work to be done, and sincere efforts are made to do it.
