5|$|A {{central point}} of debate on GWA studies has been <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SNP {{variations}} found by GWA studies {{are associated with}} only a small increased risk of the disease, and have only a small predictive value. The median odds ratio is 1.33 per risk-SNP, {{with only a few}} showing odds ratios above 3.0. These magnitudes are considered small because they do not explain much of the heritable variation. This heritable variation is known from heritability studies based on monozygotic twins. For example, it is known that 80-90% of variance in height can be explained by hereditary differences, but GWA studies only account for a minority of this variance.|$|E

It has also been reported that prototypes for the proposed Atari Mindlink controller system were disposed of at the site, which only further fuels speculation, since Atari Museum owner Curt Vendel actually currently owns the Mindlink prototypes. Writing for the Pacific Historical Review, John Wills speculated that location's place in the public psyche—its proximity to the sites of both the Trinity nuclear test and Roswell UFO incident—has aided {{the popularity of the}} story.|$|E

5|$|Almost {{all species}} are hermaphrodites, {{in other words}} each {{individual}} can function as both male and female. Some are simultaneous hermaphrodites, which can produce both eggs and sperm at the same time, while others are sequential hermaphrodites, in which the eggs and sperm mature at different times. The gonads {{are located in the}} parts of the internal canal network under the comb rows, and eggs and sperm are released via pores in the epidermis. Fertilization is generally external, but platyctenids use internal fertilization and keep the eggs in brood chambers until they hatch. Self-fertilization has occasionally been seen in species of the genus Mnemiopsis, and it is thought <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hermaphroditic species are self-fertile.|$|E
5|$|Although the Ministry of Education {{reported}} that eleven schools had sustained a combined total of $300,000 of damage, the Ministry of Communications, Works, Transport, and Public Utilities reported <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country's other major infrastructure remained functional.

Saint Lucia Air and Sea Ports Authority reported another $922,000 of damage, but none of these sectors experienced prolonged disruptions to their functionality.|$|E
5|$|Although the Navy was {{satisfied}} with the investigation and its results, others were unconvinced, and in October 1991, amid increasing criticism, Congress forced the Navy to reopen the investigation. This second investigation, handled by independent investigators, was hampered by the fact <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original debris from Iowa had been cleaned up or otherwise disposed of by the Navy {{before and after the}} first investigation, but it did uncover evidence pointing to an accidental powder explosion rather than an intentional act of sabotage.|$|E

5|$|Another {{issue of}} {{controversy}} was {{the scale of}} its actual scientific return, particularly following {{the loss of the}} Spektr science module. Astronauts, managers and various members of the press all complained that the benefits of the program were outweighed by the risks associated with it, especially considering the fact <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> US science experiments had been contained within the holed module. As such, a large amount of American research was inaccessible, reducing the science that could be performed. The safety issues caused NASA to reconsider the future of the program at various times. The agency eventually decided to continue and came under fire from various areas of the press regarding that decision.|$|E

Hops, and beer made with it, contain 8-prenylnaringenin which is a potent phytoestrogen. Hop also contains myrcene, humulene, xanthohumol, isoxanthohumol, myrcenol, linalool, tannins and resin. The alcohol 2M2B is a component of hops brewing.|$|E
5|$|Blöndal & Benedikz (2007) note <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Greece runestones {{are from}} Uppland and relate {{it to the}} fact that it was the most common area to start a journey to Greece, and the area from which most Rus' originated. However, as noted by Jansson (1987), the fact that most of these runestones were raised in Uppland and Södermanland does not {{necessarily}} mean that their number reflects the composition of the Scandinavians in the Varangian Guard. These two provinces are those that have the greatest concentrations of runic inscriptions.|$|E

5|$|Both {{stable and}} {{unstable}} isotopes of beryllium are created in stars, but the radioisotopes do not last long.

Primordial beryllium contains only one stable isotope, 9Be, and therefore beryllium is a monoisotopic element.|$|E
5|$|Brown began {{researching and}} writing Bodyguard of Lies in 1961.

Brown wrote Bodyguard of Lies at a time when details of both cryptography and deception during the war were still classified. His attempts at research was resisted by the British and American governments; he was denied access to British war records and had to undertake considerable work to obtain US records via Freedom of Information requests.|$|E
5|$|Charlton was {{approached}} by the FAI to manage the Republic of Ireland in December 1985. He was the first foreigner to be appointed to the role. In May 1986, Ireland won the Iceland Triangular Tournament at Laugardalsvöllur, in Iceland's capital of Reykjavík, with a 2–1 victory over Iceland and a 1–0 win over Czechoslovakia. By this time Charlton had developed his tactics, which {{were based on the}} traditional British 4–4–2 system, as opposed to the continental approach of using deep-lying midfielders, as he noted <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ireland international players plied their trade in England. Crucially he instructed all members of his team to pressure opposition players and in particular force ball-playing defenders into mistakes.|$|E
