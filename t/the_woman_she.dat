5|$|Je Me Souviens was {{published}} in 1910, after Vivien's death. That same year, Barney published Actes et Entr'actes (Acts and Interludes), {{a collection of short}} plays and poems. One of the plays was Equivoque (Ambiguity), a revisionist version on the legend of Sappho's death: Instead of throwing herself off a cliff for the love of Phaon the sailor, she does so out of grief that Phaon is marrying <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>she</b> loves. The play incorporates quotations from Sappho's fragments, with Barney's own footnotes in Greek.|$|E
5|$|Norcross was afforded {{a privileged}} {{education}} {{that was not}} available to many young ladies of her generation. At 16 years of age, she graduated from Fitchburg High School, and, beginning in 1870, she attended Wheaton Female Seminary, now Wheaton College. When she was 16 and 17 years old she wrote essays for Rushlight, the school's literary journal. The nature of her essays provide insight into <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>she</b> would become: one who would successfully operate in a male-oriented society, {{had an interest in}} bettering the plight of others, and appreciated historical things. She graduated in 1872. Frances Vose Emerson was a classmate at Wheaton, good friend from childhood, and ultimately a trustee for the Fitchburg Art Museum.|$|E

5|$|Finding her mother's body, Buffy {{at first}} denies what she sees, {{to the point}} of imagining {{alternate}} realities. Whedon stated that these mini dream sequences were like documentaries; people who find their loved ones dead are desperate to imagine a different, better outcome, and they create fantasies that cause much more pain when they are forced to return to the harshness of reality. Later in the hospital, Buffy imagines what she {{might have been able to}} do to save Joyce, although the doctor tells her there was nothing to be done. Willow and Xander express anger and helplessness. Anya, new to mortality and human connections, is childlike in her innocence and questions. Xander's anger and Anya's confusion allow them to be mothered somewhat by Willow, who needs to take care of someone. Dawn is deeply in denial, unable to understand that <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>she</b> thought she had known all her life was gone. Tara, who has gone through the ordeal before, represents the acceptance phase, soothing and helping the others to work through what they are experiencing. Buffy toward the end also begins to see acceptance when she tells Dawn that the body in the morgue is not their mother; Joyce is gone.|$|E
5|$|The third era {{deviates}} {{from the}} original plot considerably. When Lara was young she travelled with her parents on many of their archaeological expeditions which helped to shape <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>she</b> was becoming. It was {{on one of these}} expeditions that her mother vanished and was presumed dead and a few years later her father presumably took his own life, she was then left in the care of Conrad Roth. Even though she was left with a vast fortune, giving her the means to attend Cambridge with ease, Lara chose to study at University College London. This decision required her to pay her tuition and rent by working many jobs. Though this was a much tougher choice, it helped her become more grounded and level-headed than she might otherwise have been. She also ended up meeting her best friend, Samantha Nishimura, during her time at UCL. It was because of Sam's free spirit and wild streak that Lara was able to experience much more of London than just the universities and museums that she loved so much. After travelling the world, both Lara and Sam end up on an expedition to the Dragon's Triangle off the Japanese coast in search of the lost civilisation of Yamatai. It is on this expedition that Lara is stranded on a remote island full of natural, human and supernatural dangers, which enables her to develop from a vulnerable girl to a survivor. And after experiencing the supernatural powers of the ancient world, she comes to realise her father was right about his theories and her hunger for adventure awakens.|$|E

500|$|As {{children}} {{coming of}} age, Scout and Jem face hard realities {{and learn from}} them. Lee seems to examine Jem's sense of loss about how his neighbors have disappointed him more than Scout's. Jem says to their neighbor Miss Maudie {{the day after the}} trial, [...] "It's like bein' a caterpillar wrapped in a cocoon... I always thought Maycomb folks were the best folks in the world, least that's what they seemed like". This leads him to struggle with understanding the separations of race and class. Just as the novel is an illustration of the changes Jem faces, it is also an exploration of the realities Scout must face as an atypical girl on the verge of womanhood. As one scholar writes, [...] "To Kill a Mockingbird can be read as a feminist Bildungsroman, for Scout emerges from her childhood experiences with a clear sense of her place in her community and an awareness of her potential power as <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>she</b> will one day be." ...|$|E

When Victor goes missing, Tucker enlists Genevieve’s help and promises to reward her if she does. Genevieve finds Victor in Los Angeles suffering from amnesia. [...] Victor believes his name is [...] "Christian." [...] Genevieve poses as a barmaid, calling herself Jenny, so she can watch Victor. [...] After Victor regains his memory, Genevieve helps him get home to Genoa City. After their return, Genevieve is shunned by the town for keeping Victor away. Afterward, someone began impersonating Samantha, and when Cane found <b>the</b> <b>woman,</b> <b>she</b> insisted that Genevieve put her up to this. Genevieve denied any involvement but was convinced Colin was behind the plot. When the woman's hotel room was found trashed with blood on the floor, Ronan Malloy (Jeff Branson) considered Genevieve a suspect.

500|$|Kimberly Brock (Holly Marie Combs) and {{her best}} friend Lisa Fenn (Alexondra Lee) {{exchange}} several experimental kisses during a sleepover at Kimberly's house, the first kiss being a chaste peck with the later kisses becoming more intimate. Kimberly's younger brother Matthew (Justin Shenkarow) eavesdrops on the girls the next day when they discuss the incident and their feelings. He goes to his mother, town doctor Jill Brock (Kathy Baker) and tells her that Kimberly is a [...] "lesbo". A patient overhears and word of the kissing spreads through the town. Kimberly's father, Sheriff Jimmy Brock (Tom Skerritt) and stepmother Jill react poorly to the idea that their daughter might be a lesbian, debating [...] "nature vs. nurture" [...] and [...] "elective lesbianism" [...] and even renting [...] "hunk films" [...] starring Mel Gibson and Kevin Costner. Kimberly turns to her birth mother, Lydia (Cristine Rose), who had had a lesbian relationship in college. Lydia advises her that her relationship with another woman was during the women's movement and that while she enjoyed her time with <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>she</b> realized that she was confusing feelings of intimacy with sexuality. Lisa and Kimberly talk further. Lisa acknowledges that she is in love with Kimberly but Kimberly lets her know that she is unable to return those feelings.|$|E
500|$|Pre-Madonna {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Mark Egan from Rocky Mountain News writes that [...] "although the songs have soul in them, it's the delivery that lacks in Madonna's voice; {{you just feel}} that something is really missing." [...] Mark Zug from Chicago Tribune commented that [...] "the demos on Pre-Madonna are a delight to listen to. To all the Madonna fans, this is one album worth collecting and replaying." [...] Jasmine Temple from Lexington Herald-Leader calls the album, [...] "a gloriously voyeuristic—and unauthorized—glimpse at Madonna's past, <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>she</b> was then. You can actually sense {{the development of the}} icon she is today from the songs." [...] Robin DeRosa from USA Today was disappointed with the release, saying that [...] "it feels forced. This release is as unneeded as the hoopla surrounding Madonna's new born. Every artist has demo recordings in their early phases of career and they are generally not good. This one is not different." [...] After Madonna was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2008, Tony Sclafani from MSNBC noted that none of Madonna's songs were in the rock music genre, [...] "but all use rock as a jumping off point. Audible evidence of Madonna's rock roots {{can be found on the}} collection of early demos Pre-Madonna." ...|$|E

[...] He added that the characters of Babe, Sylvie and Stan are [...] "unremittingly grim and unappealing", but Babe was namingly [...] "gratuitously vile". Shelley was pleased when Babe left in May 2015 and said [...] "the last thing anyone wanted was {{for her to come}} back" [...] when discussing her return in September 2015. Laura Morgan of Digital Spy praised Babe's introduction, writing that her addition [...] "worked beautifully". Sally Brockway, writing for magazine Soaplife, wrote, [...] "She may rustle up a mean trifle, but you'll pay the price if you get {{on the wrong side of}} Aunt Babe Smith." [...] Ellis (Inside Soap) said, [...] "Of all the villains in Walford, we never would have thought that a trifle-making, Reliant-Robin-driving, apron-wearing aunt would turn out to be the most fearsome!

5|$|In 2001, Falle began {{counselling}} {{women in}} prostitution at Streetlight Support Services. Once she received her diploma from George Brown College, she redeveloped the organization's Choices program, a four-week program that helps women leave prostitution. Between 1997 and 2005, Choices helped 325 <b>women</b> out of <b>the</b> sex trade. <b>Women</b> entered into <b>the</b> program through {{the criminal justice}} system after being arrested for offences related to prostitution. By 2011, Falle had conselled more than 800 women. Of these women, 97% wrote on their intake surveys that they wanted to exit the sex industry, and 95% wrote that they had been physically abused by either a pimp, a client, or another <b>woman</b> in <b>the</b> sex industry. Falle believed these statistics to be representative of women in prostitution in Canada because <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>she</b> counselled did not come to her by choice; they were required to undergo the counselling by court order. In 2010, Falle said that hundreds of <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>she</b> had met were controlled by pimps, either as sexual partners or as traffickers. She also said that women in prostitution tend to be moved around a lot because they tend to fetch higher prices when they are new to a region. One of <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>she</b> counselled through Streetlight Support Services had been kept in a closet when she was not providing sexual services to men.|$|R

500|$|As an Irishwoman, Streep acted {{opposite}} Michael Gambon and Catherine McCormack in Pat O'Connor's Dancing at Lughnasa (1998), {{which was}} {{entered into the}} Venice Film Festival in its year of release. [...] Janet Maslin of The New York Times remarked that [...] "Meryl Streep has made many a grand acting gesture in her career, but the way she simply peers out a window in Dancing at Lughnasa ranks with the best. Everything the viewer need know about Kate Mundy, <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>she</b> plays here, is written on that prim, lonely face and its flabbergasted gaze". Later that year, Streep played a cancer sufferer caught in a difficult family situation, playing the mother of Renée Zellweger and wife of William Hurt in One True Thing. The film gained positive reviews. Mick LaSalle in the San Francisco Chronicle declared: [...] "After 'One True Thing', critics who persist in the fiction that Streep is a cold and technical actress will need to get their heads examined. She is so instinctive and natural – so thoroughly in the moment and operating on flights of inspiration – that she's able {{to give us a}} woman who's at once wildly idiosyncratic and utterly believable." [...] Los Angeles Times film critic Kenneth Turan noted that Streep's role [...] "is one of the least self-consciously dramatic and surface showy of her career" [...] but that she [...] "adds a level of honesty and reality that makes [...] one of her most moving".|$|E
500|$|In June 2005, Ivy Queen {{partnered with}} co-founder of Perfect Image Records, José Guadalupe to form Filtro Musik. This stemmed from Guadalupe parting ways {{with the other}} co-founder of Perfect Image, Anthony Pérez who in turn would launch his own label The Roof Records. Filtro Musik's concept {{initially}} stemmed from its name which means [...] "filter" [...] in English. Guadalupe explained the title, saying [...] "I've been in this industry for 15 years now, {{and we have the}} ability to filter and pick the best". In the coming year, Univision Music Group signed the label to licensing plan to release the album in September 2005, which ensured that the [...] "album was positioned in Latin and mainstream accounts that would normally not carry Latin product." [...] Ivy Queen was previously married to fellow reggaeton artist Omar Navarro, known by his stage name Gran Omar. They were divorced in 2005 shortly before the release of Flashback, which influenced the composition of the album. She denied ever having found him in the act of adultery, while claiming that if she had found Navarro with another woman, she'd be in La Vega Alta, a prison for women in Puerto Rico. She also denied rumors that she had physically assaulted <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>she</b> caught with Navarro. She stated they had not lived with each other for two months citing the [...] "extensive travels of her husband and his workload of being a producer" [...] as being causes to the end of the nine-year marriage.|$|E
500|$|The album {{opens with}} [...] "Muchacha (ojos de papel)", {{one of the}} most celebrated songs in Argentine rock history. Spinetta {{dedicated}} the song to Cristina Bustamante, his girlfriend at the time, and has compared the romantic ballad to songs like [...] "Tu nombre me sabe a hierba" [...] by Joan Manuel Serrat and [...] "Julia" [...] by the Beatles. Musician Alejandro del Prado described its lyrics as [...] "almost pornographic at the time", citing phrases such as [...] "pechos de miel" [...] and [...] "quédate hasta el alba" [...] ("stay until dawn"). The length of the nine-plus-minute [...] "Color humano", written by Edelmiro Molinari, concerned the record label since it precluded radio play. The jazz-inspired jam session is composed of two relatively short vocal segments surrounding a five-minute guitar solo by Molinari. The lyrics of [...] "Figuración" [...] have been described as metaphysical, with Spinetta urging the listener to disfigure themselves. In [...] "Ana no duerme", a sleepless girl is restlessly waiting; its lyrics refer to the need of many teenage girls to repress their sexuality. Spinetta described the title character as [...] "that being that is always waiting. That girl who hopes to be loved, who expects a little bit of friendship, of understanding, who wants to leave her vulgar world of womanhood, who wants to occupy another place. [...] At that time, a girl of 16 or 17 was not <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>she</b> can be today." [...] The strongly [...] paced track, with a rhythmic shift representing the [...] "interrupted dreams" [...] of the title character, has been compared to Pink Floyd's [...] "See Emily Play". Although the [...] "Ana" [...] in the song was long thought to be Ana María Spinetta (Luis Alberto's sister), he denied it on more than one occasion. Film producer Ana Aizenberg claims to be the inspiration after her affair with Spinetta.|$|E
