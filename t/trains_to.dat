5|$|After the {{war there}} was limited {{resources}} for new rolling stocks and upgrades to the line. Multiple units gradually took over passenger trains, and by 1957, no passenger <b>trains</b> <b>to</b> Storlien were hauled by locomotives. That year Stavne–Leangen Line opened, allowing <b>trains</b> <b>to</b> bypass Trondheim Central Station. The new Di 3 diesel locomotives {{were put into}} service in 1961. The last steam engine {{was taken out of}} service in 1971. The introduction of the Di 3 forced an upgrade to the line to allow for an axle load of 18 tonnes. The opening of European Road E14 in the 1950s caused a reduction in shorter-haul passenger and freight. NSB subsequently cut passenger services to a single daily train, with a Di 3 hauling Swedish carriages through Meråker. Trains continuing along the Nordland Line continued to increase.|$|E
