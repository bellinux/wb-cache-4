5|$|Many KFC {{outlets in}} Kobe and Osaka moved their Colonel Sanders statues inside until {{the series was}} over <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> rabid Tigers fans. The newly {{replaced}} Colonel Sanders statue in the Dōtonbori KFC branch was bolted down to prevent {{a repeat of the}} incident.|$|E
5|$|Many {{saltwater}} fish manufacture {{large amounts of}} trimethylamine oxide <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> the high osmotic effects of their environment; conversion of this compound to dimethylamine {{is responsible for the}} early odour in unfresh {{saltwater fish}}. In animals, free radical nitric oxide (derived from an amino acid), serves as an important regulatory molecule for circulation.|$|E
5|$|The elite cavalry {{corps of}} the Persians was the Aswaran. The lance was {{probably}} their preferred weapon, having {{the power to}} skewer two men simultaneously. Their horses were covered in lamellar armor <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> enemy archers. Persian archers had a lethal range of about 175 meters and accurate range at about 50–60 meters.|$|E

50|$|Often {{users of}} {{transaction}} processing systems are casual users. The {{system should be}} simple for <b>them</b> <b>to</b> understand, <b>protect</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> data-entry errors as much as possible, {{and allow them to}} easily correct their errors.|$|R
5|$|The {{finished}} product is ivory-colored and has almost no scent. (Perfumes are never used in Nabulsi soap.) Before leaving the factory, the individual cubes which {{are to be}} sold locally are wrapped by hand in paper which is waxed on one side.

5|$|Active and cheerful, the Russian Toy was {{originally}} bred {{both as an}} anti-rat dog and a watch dog. The second quality is still active in the breed, {{and they can be}} very vocal. They can become quite attached to their family, regardless of the ages of the family members. Russian Toys are usually very reserved with strangers, but very loyal to their owners, always ready <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> any perceived danger.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{are often}} {{important}} to island ecology. Birds have frequently reached islands that mammals have not; on those islands, birds may fulfil ecological roles typically played by larger animals. For example, in New Zealand the moas were important browsers, {{as are the}} kereru and kokako today. Today the plants of New Zealand retain the defensive adaptations evolved <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> the extinct moa. Nesting seabirds may also affect the ecology of islands and surrounding seas, principally through the concentration of large quantities of guano, which may enrich the local soil and the surrounding seas.|$|E
50|$|The {{current system}} of {{indigenous}} territories has also been criticised by proponents of indigenous rights, {{who say that the}} process of demarcation is too slow and that FUNAI lacks the resources <b>to</b> properly <b>protect</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> encroachment once registered.|$|R
50|$|The picturesque {{dragonet}} {{may grow}} to a size of 7 cm in length. They have thick slime on their skin that inhibits {{many types of}} parasitic infection and minimizes the risk of disease following stress or physical trauma. This seems <b>to</b> help <b>protect</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> some other more aggressive fish.|$|R

5|$|The {{archives}} {{are housed}} in a building south of and connected to the main building, which also contains NARA facilities. The Clinton archives {{are the first to}} include electronic information along with physical documents. The total amount of records is , the most of any presidential archive. Because Clinton wanted a light-filled library, the archives are kept underground <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> damage from ultraviolet degradation.|$|E
25|$|Lt. Gov. Alexander Spotswood made further {{advances}} in policy with the Virginia Indians along the frontier. In 1714, he established Fort Christanna to help educate and trade with several tribes {{with which the}} colony had friendly relations, as well as <b>to</b> help <b>protect</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> hostile tribes. In 1722, he negotiated the Treaty of Albany.|$|R

5|$|The {{small size}} and {{independence}} of the laser modules allowed the huge NIF building to be dispensed with. Instead, the modules were arranged in groups surrounding the target chamber in a compact arrangement. In baseline designs, the modules were stacked in 2-wide by 8-high groups in two rings {{above and below the}} target chamber, shining their light through small holes drilled into the chamber <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> the neutron flux coming back out.|$|E
5|$|Though in 1990, UNESCO {{had ordered}} the Punjab Archaeological Department to bar {{the use of the}} Fort for state or private {{functions}} on account of historical significance, a wedding reception was held in violation on December 23, 2010.

5|$|Though only {{numbering}} about 3,000 {{soldiers and}} 2,000 porters, the Belgo-Congolese force had to manage 15,000 prisoners {{in the former}} Galla-Sidamo Governorate after the campaign. At Gazzera's request, Gilliaert guaranteed the Eritrean askari safe passage to British prisoner of war camps {{in the east and}} sent Congolese guards <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> Ethiopian retaliation. The Belgian force quickly returned to Congo with their spoils of war. The siege was the first major victory for the Free Belgian Forces and greatly improved their morale.|$|E
50|$|Glassman {{had been}} {{head of a}} small group of diplomats who {{remained}} in the Embassy during the last day of fighting between the Mujahadeen and the Soviet-backed Afghan régime. In February 1989, Secretary of State James Baker decided to withdraw this small group of diplomats, so that they did not become hostages, and <b>to</b> otherwise <b>protect</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> harm.|$|R
50|$|On 2 August 2007, the two {{surviving}} CDF defendants, Kondewa and Fofana, {{were convicted}} of murder, cruel treatment, pillage and collective punishments. Kondewa was further found guilty of use of child soldiers. The CDF trial {{was perhaps the most}} controversial as many Sierra Leoneans considered the CDF <b>to</b> be <b>protecting</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> the depredations of the RUF.|$|R

5|$|Later, Momma {{decides to}} send her grandchildren to their mother in San Francisco, California, <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> the dangers of racism in Stamps. Maya attends George Washington High School and studies dance and drama on a {{scholarship}} at the California Labor School. Before graduating, she becomes the first Black female streetcar conductor in San Francisco. While still in high school, Maya visits her father in southern California one summer and has some experiences pivotal to her development. She drives a car {{for the first time}} when she must transport her intoxicated father home from an excursion to Mexico. She experiences homelessness for a short time after a fight with her father's girlfriend.|$|E
5|$|Many congregations {{gathered}} in their churches upon hearing {{news of the}} attacks, volunteering {{to spend the night}} there <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> further attacks. The local Catholic leaders demanded a peaceful bandh on 15 September in and around the city of Mangalore, and as a response Catholic traders and transport owners closed their shops and stopped their vehicles. A memorandum was submitted to the district council at 10.30 am, seeking protection for the lives and property of Christians. Prayers were to be held in all the 48 churches of the district on Wednesday, 17 September. On 6 October 2008, some 10,000 people from civil society and religious organisations organised a march to protest against the anti-Christian perpetrators of the attacks.|$|E
5|$|Many {{women are}} {{convinced}} that their husbands are putting their lives at risk by engaging in extramarital sexual relations without using protection; however, because of their secondary status, they are often unwilling to initiate discussions about HIV/AIDS in the home. Most women in Malawi do not view divorce as a viable option, even when their husbands are HIV-positive and refuse <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> the virus by wearing condoms during marital intercourse. Because they lack the education and training needed to seek gainful employment, women are not usually able to support {{themselves and their children}} outside of marriage without resorting to commercial sex work for money.|$|E

50|$|The {{pull-down}} knit cap {{was known}} in {{the army of the}} British Empire as an Uhlan cap or a Templar cap. During the Crimean War, handmade pull-down caps were sent over to the British troops <b>to</b> help <b>protect</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> the bitter cold weather before or after the battle of Balaclava. The cap became popularly known a Balaclava helmet or just balaclava among the soldiers.|$|R
5|$|On an {{ordinary}} day, a brown bear strolls {{onto the streets}} of Springfield, frightening the town. The bear is eventually subdued by the police. Homer convinces Springfield that {{something needs to be}} done <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> bears, and the town takes their complaint to Mayor Quimby, who gives in easily. Soon, the Bear Patrol is created. Homer is then shocked to see taxes have been raised five dollars to maintain the patrol, and this warrants another visit by the town to the Mayor's office. To appease them, Mayor Quimby blames the high taxes on illegal immigrants. He creates Proposition 24, which will require all illegal immigrants in Springfield to be deported.|$|E
5|$|Pliny the Elder and {{his party}} saw flames coming from several parts of the crater. After staying overnight, the party was driven from the {{building}} by an accumulation of material, presumably tephra, which threatened to block all egress. They woke Pliny, who had been napping and emitting loud snoring. They elected {{to take to the}} fields with pillows tied to their heads <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> the raining debris. They approached the beach again but the wind prevented the ships from leaving. Pliny sat down on a sail that had been spread for him and could not rise even with assistance when his friends departed. Though Pliny the Elder died, his friends ultimately escaped by land.|$|E
5|$|Strikebreakers {{made another}} attempt to move the streetcars into their carhouses <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>them</b> <b>from</b> being vandalized. When rioters in the mob {{realized}} what was being done, they attacked the policemen protecting the strikebreakers, and the police clubbed the rioters to drive them back. The rioters fled, and the police resumed their attempt to move the cars {{only to have the}} rioters renew the attack. Strikebreakers opened fire on the crowd; four rioters were killed. Numerous injuries were reported, including among the policemen. The rioters eventually overpowered the police and strikebreakers and forced them to abandon their efforts.|$|E

50|$|The Viennese had {{demolished}} many of {{the houses}} around the city walls and cleared the debris, leaving an empty plain that would expose the Ottomans to defensive fire if they tried to rush the city.

According to Richard Rutt in his History of Handknitting, the name [...] "balaclava helmet" [...] was not used during the war but appears much later, in 1881.|$|R
