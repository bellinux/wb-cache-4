5|$|During the 1848 revolution, San Martin left Paris {{and moved}} to Boulogne-sur-Mer, a small city in {{northern}} France. He was almost blind and had many health problems because of his advanced age, but continued <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>letters</b> and {{keep in touch with}} the news from South America. Shortly after receiving the news of the Argentine victory against the Anglo-French blockade, he died, three o'clock on 17 August 1850.|$|E
5|$|Although often {{assumed to}} be a debate of recent origins, local Washington, D.C. {{newspapers}} have published news items on the controversy many times since at least 1971, all in response to Native American individuals or organizations asking for the name to be changed. National protests began in 1988, after the team's Super Bowl XXII victory, prompting numerous Native Americans <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>letters</b> to Redskins owner Jack Kent Cooke; others boycotted Redskins products and protested, but Cooke rejected the possibility of change. There was a protest of about 2,000 people at the 1992 Super Bowl between the Redskins and the Buffalo Bills; the American Indian Movement's (AIM) Vernon Bellecourt {{was one of the main}} organizers of the protest.|$|E
5|$|In April 10, 2015 Marylin Zuniga, {{a teacher}} at Forest Street Elementary School in Orange, New Jersey, was {{suspended}} without pay after asking her students <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>letters</b> to Abu-Jamal, who fell ill in prison due to complications from diabetes, without approval from the school or parents. Some parents and police leaders denounced her actions. On the other hand, community members, parents, teachers, and professors expressed their support and condemned Zuniga's suspension. Scholars and educators nationwide including Noam Chomsky, Chris Hedges and Cornel West among others signed a letter calling for her immediate reinstatement. On May 13, 2015 The Orange Preparatory Academy board voted to dismiss Marylin Zuniga after hearing from her and several of her supporters.|$|E

5|$|In {{a letter}} dated 12 June 1842 in the Colonial Secretary's Records, Marshall Clifton, Chief Commissioner of the Western Australian Land Company, {{wrote of the}} need for an {{improved}} Perth–Fremantle–Bunbury road. On a special trip he took in the previous October to look for a new route, two surveyors gave their approval to the proposed coastal route, with a ferry across the estuary. Governor John Hutt approved of the idea of a road, but thought a ferry would be impractical, at least during winter, and that the lack of public funds made it impossible. Clifton continued <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>letters</b> to the Colonial Secretary advocating the construction of a road.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to Hanna-Barbera's Speed Buggy (1973) and Wonder Wheels (1977–78), the three series were commonly grouped together {{due to the}} similarities in plot and characters. Reception-wise, several critics reacted negatively to the violence and portrayal of motorcycles in the series, prompting viewers <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>letters</b> to NBC in hopes that the show would be pulled off the air. Wheelie and the Chopper Bunch had a total of 13 episodes, each consisting of 3 segments, or a total of 39 segments. It has since been released on DVD as part of Warner Bros.' Archive Collection on a three disc set.|$|E
5|$|In {{seeking to}} {{discipline}} the nuns, the Vatican did not contact {{any one of}} them personally, and did not respond to direct individual communication. Rather, the superiors of the nuns were asked <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>letters</b> verifying whether or not the nuns were in line with Catholic teaching on abortion, and a variety of responses were received from the superiors. A few nuns disavowed their position on abortion and the cases were quickly closed. Most nuns held to their earlier conviction, although their superiors sent letters saying that they accepted Church teaching. Once a nun's superior had {{sent a letter to the}} Vatican, the case was closed, without any further attempt to prevent the nun from speaking out on the issues.|$|E

5|$|When Victoria became queen in 1837, Lehzen {{served as}} a sort of {{unofficial}} private secretary, enjoying apartments adjacent to Victoria's. The Queen's marriage to Prince Albert in 1840 led to significant changes in the royal household. Albert and Lehzen detested each other, and after an illness of the Princess Royal in 1841, Lehzen was quietly dismissed. Her close relationship with the Queen came to an end, although the two continued <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>letters</b> to each other. Lehzen spent her last years in Hanover on a generous pension, dying in 1870. Historian K. D. Reynolds writes that Lehzen was a major influence on Victoria's character, in particular giving her the strength of will to survive her troubled childhood and life as a young queen.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert Foliot (c.1110– 18 February 1187) was {{a medieval}} English monk and prelate, {{successively}} Abbot of Gloucester, Bishop of Hereford and Bishop of London. Born to an ecclesiastical family, {{he became a}} monk at Cluny Abbey in France at {{about the age of}} twenty. After holding two posts as prior in the Cluniac order he was appointed Abbot of Gloucester Abbey in 1139, a promotion influenced by his kinsman Miles of Gloucester. During his tenure as abbot he acquired additional land for the abbey, and may have helped to fabricate some charters—legal deeds attesting property ownership—to gain advantage in a dispute with the Archbishops of York. Although Foliot recognised Stephen as the King of England, he may have also sympathised with the Empress Matilda's claim to the throne. He joined Matilda's supporters after her forces captured Stephen, and continued <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>letters</b> in support of Matilda even after Stephen's release.|$|E
5|$|Potter {{had become}} tired of writing for {{children}} and increasingly unfamiliar with them. The Moore children (for whom she had written several tales early in her career) were grown, and Potter had not replaced them with other children, although she continued <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>letters</b> to child fans who had written her. She was {{out of touch with}} the interests of American children. Her marriage to William Heelis on October 15, 1913 effectively ended her literary and artistic career. Although she published sporadically in the years following her marriage, her works depended principally upon decades-old concepts filed away in her publisher's offices and ageing illustrations tucked away in her portfolio. Only The Tale of Johnny Town-Mouse (1918) brought forth a completely new set of illustrations from the artist. She devoted herself to marriage and farming, and avoided publicity and fans.|$|E

5|$|On 29 January 1536, when Anne miscarried a son, {{the king}} began to reflect {{again on the}} biblical {{prohibitions}} that had haunted him during his marriage with Catherine of Aragon. Shortly after the miscarriage, the king started to {{take an interest in}} Jane Seymour. By 24 April, he had commissioned Cromwell to prepare the case for a divorce. Unaware of these plans, Cranmer had continued <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>letters</b> to Cromwell on minor matters up to 22 April. Anne was sent to the Tower of London on 2 May, and Cranmer was urgently summoned by Cromwell. On the very next day, Cranmer {{wrote a letter to the}} king expressing his doubts about the queen's guilt, highlighting his own esteem for Anne. After it was delivered, however, Cranmer was resigned to the fact that the end of Anne's marriage was inevitable. On 16 May, he saw Anne in the Tower and heard her confession and the following day, he pronounced the marriage null and void. Two days later, Anne was executed; Cranmer was one of the few who publicly mourned her death.|$|E

When Jeannie fails to persuade Joan <b>to</b> <b>write</b> a <b>letter</b> of {{recommendation}} for Meadow, Carmela presents Joan with a ricotta pie and a folder of Meadow's high school transcripts.

Gibson heard nothing more from Stanley.|$|E
25|$|The {{governor}} protested, {{claiming that}} he had not expected such action. He accused the lieutenant of treachery, as the Americans had come ashore under a flag of truce, before making the Spaniards prisoners of war.

The Spanish officials were allowed <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>letters</b> to their families. Afterward, Marina and his staff were taken to City of Sydney after sending an order to Agana for the Spanish soldiery and native militia to be at Piti landing no later than four o'clock that afternoon.|$|E
