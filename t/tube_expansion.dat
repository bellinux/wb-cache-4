40|$|Background: <b>Tube</b> <b>{{expansion}}</b> defects like stenoses and atresias cause devastating human diseases. Luminal expansion during organogenesis {{begins to}} be elucidated in several systems {{but we still}} lack a mechanistic view of the process in many organs. The Drosophila tracheal respiratory system provides an amenable model to study tube size regulation. In the trachea, COPII anterograde transport of luminal proteins is required for extracellular matrix assembly and the concurrent <b>tube</b> <b>expansion.</b> Principal Findings: We identified and analyzed Drosophila COPI retrograde transport mutants with narrow tracheal tubes. cCOP mutants fail to efficiently secrete luminal components and assemble the luminal chitinous matrix during tracheal <b>tube</b> <b>expansion.</b> Likewise, tube extension is defective in salivary glands, where it also coincides with a failure in the luminal deposition and assembly of a distinct, transient intraluminal matrix. Drosophila cCOP colocalizes with cis-Golgi markers and in cCOP mutant embryos the ER and Golgi structures are severely disrupted. Analysis of cCOP and Sar 1 double mutants suggests that bidirectional ER-Golgi traffic maintains the ER and Golgi compartments and is required for secretion and assembly of luminal matrixes during <b>tube</b> <b>expansion.</b> Conclusions/Significance: Our results demonstrate the function of COPI components in organ morphogenesis and highlight the common role of apical secretion and assembly of transient organotypic matrices in <b>tube</b> <b>expansion...</b>|$|E
40|$|Epithelial {{tubes in}} {{developing}} organs, such as mammalian lungs and insect tracheae, {{need to expand}} their initially narrow lumina to attain their final, functional dimensions [1]. Despite its critical role for organ function, the cellular mechanism of <b>tube</b> <b>expansion</b> remains unclear. Tracheal <b>tube</b> <b>expansion</b> in Drosophila involves apical secretion and deposition of a luminal matrix [2, 3, 4, 5], but the mechanistic role of secretion {{and the nature of}} forces involved in the process were not previously clear. Here we address the roles of cell-intrinsic and extrinsic processes in tracheal <b>tube</b> <b>expansion.</b> We identify mutations in the sec 24 gene stenosis, encoding a cargo-binding subunit of the COPII complex [6, 7, 8]. Via genetic-mosaic analyses, we show that stenosis-dependent secretion drives <b>tube</b> <b>expansion</b> in a cell-autonomous fashion. Strikingly, single cells autonomously adjust both tube diameter and length by implementing a sequence of events including apical membrane growth, cell flattening, and taenidial cuticle formation. Known luminal components are not required for this process. Thus, a cell-intrinsic program, rather than nonautonomous extrinsic cues, controls the dimensions of tracheal tubes. These results indicate a critical role of membrane-associated proteins in the process and imply a mechanism that coordinates autonomous behaviors of individual cells within epithelial structures...|$|E
40|$|<b>Expansion</b> <b>tubes</b> are an {{important}} type of test facility {{for the study of}} planetary entry flow-fields, being the only type of impulse facility capable of simulating the aerothermodynamics of superorbital planetary entry conditions from 10 to 20 km/s. However, the complex flow processes involved in <b>expansion</b> <b>tube</b> operation make it difficult to fully characterise flow conditions, with two-dimensional full facility computational fluid dynamics simulations often requiring tens or hundreds of thousands of computational hours to complete. In an attempt to simplify this problem and provide a rapid flow condition prediction tool, this paper presents a validated and comprehensive analytical framework for the simulation of an <b>expansion</b> <b>tube</b> facility.

Unsteady effects of stenosis severity and the imposed pressure conditions on the tube wall and flow are studied.

40|$|Eddy current testing (ECT) is a {{conventional}} inspection method of heat exchanger tubes. Many types of probes {{have been developed}} depending on such tube conditions as tube shapes and materials. However, the vicinity of a <b>tube</b> <b>expansion</b> is still a difficult area to inspect. This is {{because there is a}} step-shape variation circumferentially on the inside surface and there is a ferromagnetic tube sheet around the outside surface so that large noise is observed. A high signal to noise ratio (S/N) is required to inspect the area because fatigue cracks can occur near the <b>tube</b> <b>expansion.</b> In this study, we chose test pieces having an outside circumferential notch with a depth of 20 % tube thickness (20 %t) and set the target of the detection performance at S/N = 3. In order to realize this target, we utilized the difference of eddy current flows at a local notch and a <b>tube</b> <b>expansion,</b> and devised a new arrangement for exciting and pick-up coils. In our arrangement, the pick-up coil having a winding direction along the circumference is placed at the center of two exciting coils. The exciting coils induce an eddy current flow in the axial direction at the center and the pick-up coil can detect only a circumferential component. By using this probe, large noise having an axial component is suppressed and only a notch signal having a circumferential component can be detected. In order to confirm the probe performance, we compared it with a general bobbin type probe. In the sensitivity evaluation for an outside circumferential notch with 20 %t, the signal amplitude was improved 5. 7 times. In the noise evaluation test using a test piece with <b>tube</b> <b>expansion,</b> the noise amplitude was decreased 1 / 8 times.

40|$|The main aim of {{this work}} is to study the end forming {{behaviour}} of friction stir processed Al 6063 -T 6 tubes fabricated at different tool rotational speeds. <b>Tube</b> <b>expansion,</b> tube reduction and tube beading are performed on the friction stir processed and parent tubes. The load, thinning and hardness evolution during the end forming operations are evaluated. A rotational speed yielding moderate combination of initial hardness and hardening index of the friction stir processed zone governs the maximum load required during end forming. Tube reduction and tube beading need larger load because of tube thickening, as compared to <b>tube</b> <b>expansion,</b> in which tube thinning is witnessed. The friction stir processed zone of the processed tube undergoes larger thinning and thickening as compared to base material in <b>tube</b> <b>expansion</b> and reduction, respectively, while base material thickens more in tube beading. The hardness and strain hardening exponent difference govern such thickness evolution. Mechanical instabilities like failure of friction stir processed zone, wrinkling and overlapping of friction stir processed zone, and fine cracks development are seen during the end forming operations. The effect of rotational speed on the hardness and grain size distribution of friction stir processed zone is negligible. The hardness of processed zone is found to increase after end forming operations...|$|E

40|$|A stent is {{a device}} {{that is used to}} support {{arterial}} walls to alleviate the blockage of arteries by plaque. The slotted tube stent {{is one of the most}} common stent designs being widely used in many patients today. The amount of stent implantations is growing each year and for this it is becoming increasingly important in interventional cardiology. One of the reasons is that the use of stents has proved more effective in the therapy of coronary stenosis. However, it is evidenced that the success of the stent implantation is limited by re-stenosis, which is discussed almost entirely in terms of medical and biological reasons. This work is concerned with investigating the deformation mechanism with variable conditions during slotted <b>tube</b> <b>expansion</b> processes using numerical simulation. The simulations were run and analysed using commercial finite element software. A nonlinear explicit solution method was used in each case. The processes chosen for simulation were: slotted <b>tube</b> <b>expansion</b> without balloon catheter, slotted <b>tube</b> <b>expansion</b> with balloon catheter, scaling the stent size, stent production defect and slotted <b>tube</b> <b>expansion</b> with the presence of artery and plaque. A number of process parameters were varied for balloon catheter (i. e. balloon length, thickness and friction factor) and the subsequent effects on the process were identified. Some trial experimental tests were carried out to verify the finite element results from the computer simulations. From the results obtained it was concluded that higher rate of pressure increase results in higher stresses in stent for similar levels of expansion. Deployment of higher magnitude pressure might increase the expansion in radial direction but it does not necessarily increase the uniformity of the slotted tube. Appropriate balloon length has to be chosen to obtain a uniform expansion. Friction could reduce the foreshortening of the stent. When scaling down the stent, displacement deceases proportionally for similar deployment pressure and stent geometry. It was found from the simulations that the tubular stent is not very sensitive to imperfections. Altering sent strut configuration and number has practical effects on the clinical use of vascular stents, as the magnitude of expansion will change. The deformation characteristic of the slotted tube during deployment is affected by the presence of artery and plaque...|$|E

40|$|Jupiter's {{large scale}} size and rapid {{planetary}} rotation period combine {{to produce the}} strong centrifugal force responsible for many unique properties of its magnetosphere. It was previously proposed that this centrifugal force and nonadiabatic field line stretching could cause the observed dawn‐dusk asymmetry of Jupiter's plasma sheet, which is thickest near dusk. As flux tubes rotate and stretch between noon and dusk, particles bouncing along the field gain parallel energy and create pressure anisotropy. Because bounce times can be long compared with the outward expansion timescale, particles may respond nonadiabatically, and the resulting pressure anisotropy can drive the plasma sheet to instability. We used a large‐scale kinetic simulation to follow a collection of rotating particles as they move in a time‐varying, rotating magnetic field designed to represent flux <b>tube</b> <b>expansion</b> in Jupiter's magnetosphere. The analysis quantifies the response of trapped particles by characterizing the pressure anisotropy and energy changes. We compare results of nonadiabatic and adiabatic outward expansions and find that the nonadiabatic case leads to a large pitch angle anisotropy and higher total energy than for adiabatic expansion. Although the calculation was not handled fully self‐consistently, the results support the proposition that plasma pressure changes lead {{to changes in the}} magnetic field structure with local time. Our findings are consistent with the idea that nonadiabatic effects in Jupiter's magnetosphere contribute to field dipolarization and the observed plasma sheet thickening between noon and dusk.
