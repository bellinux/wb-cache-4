5|$|Birds {{found in}} birch {{woodland}} include the chaffinch, <b>tree</b> <b>pipit,</b> willow warbler, nightingale, robin, woodcock, redpoll and green woodpecker.|$|E
25|$|Among the birdlife {{which can}} be seen at Cors Caron are buzzard, {{peregrine}} falcon, merlin, Eurasian sparrowhawk and hen harrier. There have also been rare sightings of Montagu's harrier. The reserve provides a habitat for the endangered red kite. Once nearly extinct, the bird of prey has made a dramatic resurgence in the area. The wetlands attract a variety of wild fowl such as the teal, curlew, and water rail. Snipe, red grouse, <b>tree</b> <b>pipit,</b> grasshopper warbler and whinchat can be seen more in the drier areas and the common redstart and willow warbler nest in the willow scrub.|$|E
25|$|Where bracken is {{dominant}} it excludes most specialist heathland/moorland {{bird species}} of conservation concern, {{although there are}} a few species that may benefit from a certain proportion of bracken. Deeper bracken stands provide a good food site for many resident or breeding birds, such as threatened ground-nesting species skylark, yellowhammer, curlew and lapwing. Some British birds such as the whinchat and the nightjar use bracken as their preferred habitats. The nightjar may lay its eggs on the bare ground under the bracken. The skylark often nests in bracken and uses it for cover. Small stands of bracken provide nesting, feeding and roosting habitat for a variety of smaller birds, including the willow warbler (which will also use bracken to construct its nest), the <b>tree</b> <b>pipit,</b> the yellowhammer, the ring ouzel, the woodcock and the twite.|$|E
50|$|The Nilgiri pipit {{is closely}} related to the <b>tree</b> <b>pipits</b> and is a sister to the clade {{containing}} Anthus trivialis and Anthus hodgsoni from which it diverged in the Pliocene.|$|R
50|$|Nearby, the Penallt Old Church Wood is a 10 acre {{nature reserve}} {{managed by the}} Gwent Wildlife Trust. This {{deciduous}} woodland forms a habitat for pied flycatchers, nuthatches, <b>tree</b> <b>pipits,</b> treecreepers and sparrowhawks, as well as plants such as wild daffodils and moschatel.|$|R
50|$|Several insect, {{bird and}} other animals have been {{recorded}} on the site. Birds include Eurasian sparrowhawks, common sandpipers, long-tailed tits, red-legged partridges, Eurasian skylarks, mallards, greater white-fronted geese and meadow and <b>tree</b> <b>pipits.</b> However the only amphibian found is the common frog.|$|R
6000|$|It {{may appear}} strange to some readers that I put the tree-pipit, with his thin, shrill, canary-like pipe, in this list; but his notes {{are not all}} of this character; he is {{moreover}} a most variable singer; and it happens that in some individuals the concluding notes of the song have more of that peculiar human quality than any other British songster. No doubt it was a bird in which these human-like, languishing notes {{at the close of}} the song were very full and beautiful that inspired Burns to write his [...] "Address to a Wood-lark." [...] The <b>tree</b> <b>pipit</b> is often called by that name in Scotland, where the true wood-lark is not found.|$|E

50|$|The {{site has}} the largest {{remaining}} area of woodland in Bedfordshire, together with lowland heath, acidic grassland and some small ponds. There {{are a number of}} rare plant species, including great woodrush, wood vetch and saw-wort. There are also abundant birds and insects, including white admiral butterflies and <b>tree</b> <b>pipits.</b>|$|R
50|$|Ninety {{types of}} birds {{have also been}} {{recorded}} within the park. These include the European robin, common chaffinch, blue tit, great tit and common wood pigeon, with willow warblers and <b>tree</b> <b>pipits</b> visiting {{during the summer and}} fieldfare and redwing during the winter. Nuthatches are frequently seen on the bird feeders outside the small cafe near the lake.|$|R
50|$|This {{habitat is}} home to badgers, foxes, voles, shrews and weasels, and {{pipistrelle}} and long-eared bats. Jays, green and great spotted woodpeckers are frequently seen, and rarer sightings include yellowhammers, chiffchaffs and <b>tree</b> <b>pipits.</b> Many butterflies, such as the comma and hedge brown thrive here. Also found are turtle doves, nightingales, grey and red-legged partridges, and barn and long-eared owls.|$|R

50|$|This {{is a small}} pipit, which resembles meadow pipit. It is an undistinguished-looking species, {{streaked}} brown {{above and}} with black markings on a white belly and buff breast below. It can be distinguished from the slightly smaller meadow pipit by its heavier bill and greater contrast between its buff breast and white belly. <b>Tree</b> <b>pipits</b> more readily perch in trees.|$|R
5000|$|The site is in two {{separate}} areas. The Roman River, after which the site is named, runs along the southern boundary of both of them. There are areas of woodland, grassland, fen, scrub and heath. The woodland it mainly ancient, {{and there are more}} than a thousand species of moths and butterflies, and nearly seventy of breeding birds, including hawfinches, <b>tree</b> <b>pipits</b> and yellow wagtails.|$|R
50|$|The Nilgiri pipit (Anthus nilghiriensis) is a {{distinctive}} species of pipit that is endemic {{to the high}} altitude hills of southern India. Richer brown in colour than other pipits in the region, it is distinctive in having the streaking on the breast continuing along the flanks. It is non-migratory and {{has a tendency to}} fly into low trees when disturbed and is closely related to the <b>tree</b> <b>pipits,</b> Anthus hodgsoni and Anthus trivialis.|$|R
50|$|It {{is similar}} to the red-throated pipit Anthus cervinus, which is more heavily {{streaked}} and (in summer only) has an orange-red throat, and to the <b>tree</b> <b>pipit</b> Anthus trivialis, which is slightly larger, less heavily streaked, and has stronger facial markings and a shorter hind claw. The song of the meadow pipit accelerates towards the end while that of the <b>tree</b> <b>pipit</b> slows down.|$|E
50|$|Birds {{recorded}} {{on the site}} include the willow tit, <b>tree</b> <b>pipit,</b> European nightjar and the Eurasian sparrowhawk.|$|E
50|$|Butterflies {{includes}} Duke of Burgundy {{and small}} blue. Downland and wetland birds include dipper, kingfisher, yellowhammer and <b>tree</b> <b>pipit.</b> Reed buntings breed in the marsh.|$|E
50|$|The {{wood was}} {{formerly}} {{part of a}} large area of common land in the parish of Northaw which was used for grazing livestock and gathering wood fuel. Closure of the canopy has led to the disappearance of open woodland birds such as nightingales and <b>tree</b> <b>pipits,</b> but the management plan for the wood aims to restore biodiversity. The site has one of the county's most extensive areas of ancient hornbeam woodland, with other trees including oak and silver birch. Glades, streams and springs add to the biodiversity.|$|R
5000|$|Terrestrial {{animals in}} the region include brown bears, European adders, moles of the Talpa genus, red foxes and red deer, gray wolves, lynx, {{mountain}} hares, and several species of mustelids including stoats and wolverines. [...] Bird species include hazel grouse, <b>tree</b> <b>pipits,</b> Eurasian three-toed woodpeckers, golden eagles, peregrine falcons, black storks, northern eagle owls, and gyrfalcons. [...] Aquatic species include moor frogs, Siberian taimen, fish of the genus Cottus, Siberian grayling, Asiatic trout and European otters. Insect fauna include the Siberian silk moth, a plant-eating insect species that lives {{in the region and}} feeds on tree leaves.|$|R
50|$|On the {{woodland}} edge - {{however it}} is defined - {{not only does the}} flora change, but also the fauna and the soil type. These edge effects mean that many species of animal prefer woodland edges {{to the heart of the}} forest, because they have both protection and light - for example <b>tree</b> <b>pipits</b> and dunnocks. At the woodland edge trees are often different from those inside the wood, as well as hedge vegetation, brambles and low-growing plants.The more gradual the transition from open country to woodland (for example through intermediate young trees or bushes), the less risk there is that, in stormy weather, wind will blow under the canopy and uproot the outer rows of trees. The structure of the woodland edge and its maintenance is viewed as important in forest management especially during reforestation.|$|R
50|$|The reserve {{supports}} woodland and grassland {{species such}} as blackcap, linnet, <b>tree</b> <b>pipit,</b> coal tit, goldcrest, turtle dove, great spotted woodpecker, pied wagtail and jackdaw.|$|E
50|$|Species seen: Dartford warbler, Cetti's warbler, Montagu's harrier, great spotted woodpecker, redstart, spotted flycatcher, stonechat, linnet, <b>tree</b> <b>pipit,</b> nightjar, mute swan, chaffinch, {{reed warbler}} and Sandwich tern.|$|E
50|$|The {{olive-backed pipit}} (Anthus hodgsoni) {{is a small}} {{passerine}} bird of the pipit (Anthus) genus, which breeds across South, north Central and East Asia, {{as well as in}} the northeast of European Russia. It is a long-distance migrant moving in winter to southern Asia and Indonesia. Sometimes it is also called Indian pipit or Hodgson's pipit, as well as <b>tree</b> <b>pipit</b> owing to its resemblance with the <b>tree</b> <b>pipit.</b> However, its back is more olive-toned and less streaked than that species, and its head pattern is different with a better-marked supercilium.|$|E
5000|$|The main {{fabric of}} the Rosenau is a medieval {{structure}} which was first built at some time before 1439, when it is recorded as a possession of the lords of 'Rosenawe'. For three centuries the estate was owned by a family which took its name from Rosenau, but Silvester von Rosenau, a friend of Luther and Melanchthon, bequeathed his properties to his son weighed down by debts. In 1704, the Rosenau family finally lost the property when it was sold as a summer residence to the Austrian Freiherr Ferdinand Johann Adam von Pernau (1660-1731), {{who had been a}} member of the Privy Council of Albert V, Duke of Saxe-Coburg. Pernau was a pioneering student of bird behaviour. As a long-term experiment, he released a large number of young common chaffinches in and around Rosenau between 1704 and 1720, after first teaching them to sing like <b>tree</b> <b>pipits.</b> He was known as the Freiherr von Pernau zu Rosenau, and his most important publication, printed at Coburg in 1707, was titled Lessons, as to what one can do with the lovely Creatures, the Birds, either by Capture, by Probing of their Characteristics and Taming, or by other forms of Instruction, for Pleasure and Profit.|$|R
50|$|The madanga or rufous-throated white-eye (Madanga ruficollis) is {{a species}} of bird that was {{formerly}} included in the Zosteropidae family but is now thought to be an atypical {{member of the family}} Motacillidae consisting of the pipits and wagtails. It is monotypic within the genus Madanga, with its close relatives being <b>tree</b> <b>pipits</b> of the genus Anthus, and is endemic to the moist, mountainous, subtropical and tropical forests of the Indonesian island Buru. The bird was initially described from four specimens collected in April 1922 from one area {{in the western part of}} the island, near the settlement Wa Fehat, at elevations between 820 m and 1500 m. These observations were reproduced on two birds in December 1995 at Wakeika, at elevation of 1460 m; changes in the bird's habitat at Wa Fehat were also noted in 1995. The bird was observed only in a few localities and neither its habitat area nor population are reliably known. The population is estimated at more than several hundred individuals, and the habitat at several hundreds km2 from the available on Buru area above 1,200 meters (872 km²) and above 1,500 m (382 km²); the birds are believed to disperse over their habitat rather than form groups. Because the species are restricted to a single island and its habitat is threatened by logging and other human activities, it is listed as endangered by the IUCN since 1996.|$|R
50|$|Birds that {{frequent}} {{the area}} include Arctic loon, Arctic tern, Baird's sandpiper, black-bellied plover, buff-breasted sandpiper, Canada goose, glaucous gull, golden eagle, golden plover, herring gull, king eider, Lapland longspur, long-tailed jaeger, mallard, northern phalarope, oldsquaw, parasitic jaeger, pectoral sandpiper, pintail, raven, red-breasted merganser, red-throated loon, rough-legged hawk, sanderling, semipalmated sandpiper, short-eared owl, snow bunting, snowy owl, <b>tree</b> sparrow, water <b>pipit,</b> whistling swan, willow ptarmigan, and yellow-billed loon.|$|R
50|$|The hill is circled by swifts in the summer. Kestrel and buzzard may {{be spotted}} overhead. Breeding birds include skylark, <b>tree</b> <b>pipit</b> and meadow pipit. The green {{woodpecker}} is {{attracted by the}} anthills.|$|E
50|$|Whitethroat, marsh tit, skylark, <b>tree</b> <b>pipit</b> and {{grey wagtail}} {{are some of}} the birds {{recorded}} at the reserve. The great spotted woodpecker is also present. Over 70 different bird species are recorded for this site.|$|E

50|$|The nearby Dersingham Bog National Nature Reserve, {{managed by}} English Nature, {{contains}} habitats ranging from marshland to heathland and woodland. Birds {{such as the}} redpoll, crossbill, long-eared owl, <b>tree</b> <b>pipit,</b> sparrowhawk and nightjar can be found there.|$|E
50|$|Many {{plants such}} as heather, cross-leaved heath, dwarf and common gorse, heath spotted-orchid, bog asphodel, and round-leaved sundew are now thriving, along with keeled skimmer {{dragonfly}} and <b>tree</b> <b>pipit</b> {{as a result of}} heath and bog habitat restoration.|$|E
50|$|The loch and {{the forest}} around it are popular with birdwatchers, walkers, {{mountain}} bikers and day-trippers. Among the birds found on or around Loch an Eilein are the crested tit, redstart, spotted flycatcher, <b>tree</b> <b>pipit,</b> red-throated diver, common sandpiper, whinchat, and the occasional merlin.|$|E
