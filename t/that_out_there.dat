500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} talks {{about someone who}} has got over a broken relationship, declaring the partner as [...] "so yesterday". According to Duff, the song's lyrics are very {{empowering}} towards breaking up with someone and getting over it. In a 2006 interview with Instinct, Duff said that people often told her that [...] "So Yesterday" [...] was [...] "the ultimate post-breakup anthem". She said her mother instilled the notion of inner strength in her, and that she wanted the music she makes to be positive. [...] "I don't think there's very much of <b>that</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> anymore.", she said. She {{stressed the importance of}} strong songs that are not all about how [...] "a boy broke your heart and you're never going to get on your feet again", saying it was good for girls to hear.|$|E
500|$|Prior to {{the release}} of the album, a few tracks were made {{available}} for streaming via the band's Myspace: [...] "The Plot to Bomb the Panhandle", [...] "Fast Forward to 2012", [...] "The Danger in Starting a Fire", [...] "A Shot in the Dark" [...] and [...] "Show 'Em the Ropes". Cover art was unveiled on November 30, 2006. A commercial to promote the album was released on January 4, 2007. Pre-orders were taken starting January 16. The album was released in the US on January 22, while the UK release occurred a week later, on January 29. On March 8, the band released the music video for [...] "The Plot to Bomb the Panhandle", which featured Ron Jeremy. The video was filmed in Los Angeles. After being asked how they got Jeremy to appear, McKinnon said [...] "It was pretty much some that we were kicking around. We were kicking around different people and I think, Tony threw <b>that</b> <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> out of nowhere and we were like 'That'd be cool, that'd be funny, people will be into that.'".|$|E
2500|$|David Denby of The New Yorker {{criticized the}} way the Coens [...] "disposed of" [...] Llewelyn Moss. [...] "The Coens, however {{faithful}} to the book", he said, [...] "cannot be forgiven for disposing of Llewelyn so casually. After watching this foolhardy but physically gifted and decent guy escape so many traps, {{we have a great}} deal invested in him emotionally, and yet he's eliminated, off-camera, by some unknown Mexicans. He doesn't get the dignity of a death scene. The Coens have suppressed their natural jauntiness. They have become orderly, disciplined masters of chaos, but one still has the feeling <b>that,</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> on the road from nowhere to nowhere, they are rooting for it rather than against it." ...|$|E

One of the greatest sights I've ever seen here at Yankee Stadium!" ...|$|R
2500|$|... "Bring Me to Life" [...] {{was written}} by Amy Lee, Ben Moody and David Hodges for their first studio album Fallen. Recording work for Fallen started at Ocean Studios in Burbank, California, where most of [...] "Bring Me to Life" [...] was {{recorded}}, prior to full album production. The song was mixed by Jay Baumgardner in his studio, NRG Recording Studios in North Hollywood, on an SSL 9000 J. A 22-piece string section was recorded in Seattle by Mark Curry. [...] "Bring Me to Life" [...] was mixed at the Newman Scoring Stage and Bolero Studios, both in Los Angeles. The orchestra parts were arranged by David Hodges and David Campbell. During an interview, Lee recalled that during the recording process of the song it was said {{to her that the}} song must feature male vocals: [...] "It was presented to me as, 'You're a girl singing in a rock band, there's nothing else like <b>that</b> <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> nobody's going to listen to you. You need a guy to come in and sing back-up for it to be successful.'" ...|$|E

5000|$|Among {{the first}} wave of bands to gain {{mainstream}} success were 311, Bloodhound Gang and Limp Bizkit. Although the popularity of rapcore declined, some believe that rapcore may regain popularity, with younger music fans discovering bands in the genre. Drew Simollardes of the rapcore band Reveille states that [...] "I feel like lately it’s more appropriate. People are sick {{of a lot of the}} stuff <b>that’s</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> right now." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2005, Kirk {{stated that}} he was not opposed to the {{immigration}} process in the United States discriminating against young Arab males from [...] "terrorist-producing states". He stated, [...] "I think that {{when we look at the}} threat <b>that’s</b> <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> young men between, say, the ages of 18 and 25 from a couple of countries, I believe a certain amount of intense scrutiny should be placed on them." ...|$|R

60|$|Only the superstitious terror engendered in him by {{the stories}} poured into his ears by the whites and blacks of the Russian's party kept him from leaping upon Tarzan with his warriors and slaying him forthwith, for he and his people were inveterate maneaters.

60|$|On the morrow he {{rode out}} of the red cliff gate with Dave and the pack-horses, a dull ache in his heart; for amid the cheering crowd of {{children}} and women who bade them good-bye he had caught the wave of Mescal's hand and a look of her eyes that would be with him always. What might happen before he returned, if he ever did return! For he knew now, {{as well as he}} could feel Silvermane's easy stride, <b>that</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> under the white glare of desert, the white gleam of the slopes of Coconina, was wild life awaiting him. And he shut his teeth, and narrowed his eyes, and faced it with an eager joy that was in strange contrast to the pang in his breast.|$|E
6000|$|... 'He {{came in at}} last; but I {{believe it}} was mostly the rain that did it; it was falling just then with a devastating {{violence}} which quieted down gradually while we talked. His manner was very sober and set; his bearing {{was that of a}} naturally taciturn man possessed by an idea. My talk was of the material aspect of his position; it had the sole aim of saving him from the degradation, ruin, and despair <b>that</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> close so swiftly upon a friendless, homeless man; I pleaded with him to accept my help; I argued reasonably: and every time I looked up at that absorbed smooth face, so grave and youthful, I had a disturbing sense of being no help but rather an obstacle to some mysterious, inexplicable, impalpable striving of his wounded spirit.|$|E

60|$|There is {{very much}} in the mode of life adopted by the {{settlers}} in these regions which creates admiration. The people are all intelligent. They are energetic and speculative, conceiving grand ideas, and carrying them out almost with the rapidity of magic. A suspension bridge half a mile long is erected, while in England we should be fastening together a few planks for a foot passage. Progress, mental as well as material, is the demand of the people generally. Everybody understands everything, and everybody intends sooner or later to do everything. All this is very grand; but then there is a terrible drawback. One hears on every side of intelligence, but one hears also on every side of dishonesty. Talk to whom you will, of whom you will, and you will hear some tale of successful or unsuccessful swindling. It seems to be the recognized rule of commerce in the far West that men shall go into the world's markets prepared to cheat and to be cheated. It may be said that as long as this is acknowledged and understood on all sides, no harm will be done. It is equally fair for all. When I was a child there used to be certain games at which it was agreed in beginning either that there should be cheating or that there should not. It may be said <b>that</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> in the Western States, men agree to play the cheating game; and that the cheating game has more of interest in it than the other. Unfortunately, however, they who agree to play this game on a large scale do not keep outsiders altogether out of the playground. Indeed, outsiders become very welcome to them; and then it is not pleasant to hear the tone in which such outsiders speak of the peculiarities of the sport to which they have been introduced. When a beginner in trade finds himself furnished with a barrel of wooden nutmegs, the joke is not so good to him as to the experienced merchant who supplies him. This dealing in wooden nutmegs, this selling of things which do not exist, and buying of goods for which no price is ever to be given, is an institution which is much honored in the West. We call it swindling--and so do they. But {{it seemed to me that}} in the Western States the word hardly seemed to leave the same impress on the mind that it does elsewhere.|$|E
5000|$|The {{album was}} written and {{recorded}} {{following the death}} of Ty Segalls father, Brian Segall. Following the albums release, Segall noted, [...] "It was just therapeutic, really.
