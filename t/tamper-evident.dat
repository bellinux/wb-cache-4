25|$|During {{commercial}} {{filling it}} is common to use a flame to sterilize the rim and lid of jars to destroy any yeasts and molds which may cause spoilage during storage. Steam is commonly injected immediately prior to lidding to create a vacuum, which both helps prevent spoilage and pulls down <b>tamper-evident</b> safety button when used.|$|E
2500|$|Sometimes the {{objectives}} of package development seem contradictory. [...] For example, regulations for an over-the-counter drug might require the package to be <b>tamper-evident</b> and child resistant: These intentionally make the package difficult to open. The intended consumer, however, might be handicapped or elderly and unable to readily open the package. Meeting all goals is a challenge.|$|E
2500|$|Additionally, the {{incident}} prompted {{the pharmaceutical industry}} {{to move away from}} capsules, which were easy to contaminate as a foreign substance could be placed inside without obvious signs of tampering. Within the year, the FDA introduced more stringent regulations to avoid product tampering. This led to the eventual replacement of the capsule with the solid [...] "caplet", a tablet made {{in the shape of a}} capsule, as a drug delivery form and with the addition of <b>tamper-evident</b> safety-seals to bottles of many sorts.|$|E
2500|$|Security – Packaging {{can play}} an {{important}} role in reducing the security risks of shipment. [...] Packages can be made with improved tamper resistance to deter manipulation and they can also have <b>tamper-evident</b> features indicating that tampering has taken place. Packages can be engineered to help reduce the risks of package pilferage or the theft and resale of products: [...] Some package constructions are more resistant to pilferage than other types, and some have pilfer-indicating seals. Counterfeit consumer goods, unauthorized sales (diversion), material substitution and tampering can all be minimized or prevented with such anti-counterfeiting technologies. Packages may include authentication seals and use security printing to help indicate that the package and contents are not counterfeit. Packages also can include anti-theft devices such as dye-packs, RFID tags, or electronic article surveillance tags that can be activated or detected by devices at exit points and require specialized tools to deactivate. [...] Using packaging in this way is a means of retail loss prevention.|$|E

50|$|In police work, <b>tamper-evident</b> {{techniques}} {{must often}} {{be used to}} guard access to evidence, providing means of storing items and samples {{in a way which}} can be used to prove that they were not altered after their collection. It could be argued that CCTV systems perform a similar function in the handling of suspects. Video systems of course, can be given <b>tamper-evident</b> features by the use of timestamps generated by a suitably trusted clock.|$|E

50|$|Anti-tamper {{devices have}} one or more {{components:}} tamper resistance, tamper detection, tamper response, and tamper evidence. In some applications, devices are only <b>tamper-evident</b> rather than tamper-resistant.|$|E

50|$|<b>Tamper-evident</b> {{design is}} perhaps most visible {{in the process of}} product {{packaging}} and labelling, where it can be vital to know that the product has not been altered since it left the manufacturer.|$|E

50|$|As the {{phenomenon}} of supermarkets spread across the UK, the need for <b>tamper-evident</b> packaging became a top priority so Chadwicks shifted production towards heat-seal lids that offered the security that consumers and retailers required.|$|E
5000|$|Since any device or {{system can}} be foiled by a person with {{sufficient}} knowledge, equipment, time, etc., the term [...] "tamperproof" [...] is a misnomer. Tamper resistance and <b>tamper-evident</b> systems and devices are better terminology.|$|E

50|$|While <b>tamper-evident</b> {{bands are}} not {{considered}} a challenge for recycling, {{it is important that}} the band stays attached to the cap in case of refillable bottles, because it is hard to remove the rings from intact bottles in an economical way.|$|E

50|$|Despite {{the easy}} {{availability}} of miniature key loggers, <b>tamper-evident</b> design {{is not often}} used in personal computers. While transparent computer cases and keyboards are common, they are mainly used for the decorative effect rather than security. Many PCs do have a switch to detect opening of the case, and this provides a visual notification when the computer is next turned on that the case has recently been opened. In any case, {{it has long been}} possible to complicate the task of tampering with electronic devices by sealing them with <b>tamper-evident</b> tape or sealing wax. Alternatively, radio-controlled alarm-devices (which transmit a silent alarm) can be installed, or cases can be glued shut in such a manner that tampering attempts will distort or fracture the casing.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>tamper-evident</b> package, {{according}} to the regulations of the Food and Drug Administration (21 CFR § 211.132), “is one having one or more indicators or barriers to entry which, if breached or missing, can reasonably be expected to provide visible evidence to consumers that tampering has occurred.” In addition, the indicator or barrier must be “distinctive by design,” which means the <b>tamper-evident</b> feature is designed from material not readily available to the public. Therefore, it can’t be easily duplicated. The labeling must also include {{a description of the}} safety feature. For blister packaging, each tablet or capsule is individually sealed, so any form of tampering is immediately visible. The product label needs to include a statement similar to the following: “Do not use if blister is cut or broken.” ...|$|E
50|$|Road tax vignettes {{and price}} tags are often <b>tamper-evident</b> {{in the sense}} that they cannot be removed in one piece. This makes it {{difficult}} to move a vignette from one car to another, or to peel off a price tag from a cheaper article and reapply it to a more expensive one.|$|E
