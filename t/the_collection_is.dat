5|$|In 2002, the South African-born Australian poet John Mateer {{published}} his fourth collection of poems, entitled Loanwords. <b>The</b> <b>collection</b> <b>is</b> {{divided into four}} sections, of which the third, In the Presence of a Severed Head, has Yagan as its subject.|$|E
5|$|In October 2016, Ono {{unveiled}} {{her first}} permanent art installation in the United States; <b>the</b> <b>collection</b> <b>is</b> located in Jackson Park, Chicago and promotes peace. Ono was inspired {{during a visit}} to the Garden of the Phoenix in 2013 and feels a connection to the city of Chicago.|$|E
50|$|While closed, <b>the</b> <b>collection</b> <b>were</b> {{stored at}} <b>the</b> Gettysburg Museum and Visitor Center, where {{material}} from <b>the</b> <b>collection</b> <b>was</b> displayed 2013-2015.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>collection</b> <b>was</b> {{compared}} to Lars Von Triers movie Melancholia, Ray Bradbury and H.C. Andersen.Another reviewer commented that <b>the</b> <b>collection</b> <b>was</b> wayard but too fragmental and complex. Additional {{to this one}} reviewer criticized the length of <b>the</b> <b>collection.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Library was {{formally}} inaugurated in 1689. From <b>the</b> start <b>the</b> <b>collection</b> <b>was</b> a general one. In 1709 {{the status of}} <b>the</b> <b>collection</b> <b>was</b> confirmed when Queen Anne's Copyright Act gave the Keeper of the Library the right to claim a copy of every book published in the British Isles. <b>The</b> <b>collection</b> <b>was</b> enhanced by purchase and donation, particularly of continental imprints and of manuscripts.|$|R
5|$|The Palace Museum's bronze {{collection}} {{dates from}} the early Shang dynasty. Of the almost 10,000 pieces held, about 1,600 are inscribed items from the pre-Qin period (to 221 BC). A significant part of <b>the</b> <b>collection</b> <b>is</b> ceremonial bronzeware from the imperial court.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>collection</b> <b>is</b> {{divided up}} into four main {{information}} areas: market research, company information, trade directories, and journals. It {{is free of}} charge in hard copy and online via approximately 30 subscription databases. Registered readers can access the collection and the databases.|$|E
5|$|Tinne {{acquired}} a significant collection of clothes from shops in Bold Street, Liverpool shops and her local dressmaker. The collection comprised both off-the-rail items and bespoke outfits. She also made some clothes, including special outfits for her children's dance shows. <b>The</b> <b>collection</b> <b>is</b> held by National Museums Liverpool, donated {{in three stages}} by Emily Tinne's daughter, Alexine. Due to {{the sheer volume of}} items, Alexine would put out two tea chests per week, which would be collected by the museum. The collection includes more than 700 items, though many other items could not be accepted due to the low quality. The total collection included over 1000 items. <b>The</b> <b>collection</b> <b>is</b> the largest from an individual owned by a museum in the United Kingdom.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> Marine Invertebrate <b>Collection</b> <b>was</b> {{started in}} <b>the</b> 1930s with alcohol-preserved {{specimens}} collected by Dr. C. McLean Fraser and Dr. Ian McTaggart Cowan. <b>The</b> <b>collection</b> <b>was</b> primarily used for teaching purposes and eventually grew to several thousand specimens encompassing the major lineages of invertebrate animals. <b>The</b> <b>collection</b> <b>was</b> expanded in 2006, {{due to the}} donation of thousands of shells and corals by Kelly Norton. <b>The</b> <b>collection</b> <b>was</b> further expanded <b>the</b> following year with a large donation from Evelyn Hebb Killiam.|$|R
50|$|The {{results of}} the Battle of Tripoli in August 2011, with the later arrest of Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, may alter the museum's opening date and festivities. Hafed Walda, Cultural Counsellor of the regime, {{confirmed}} that the project was on hold and {{that the future of}} <b>the</b> <b>collection</b> <b>was</b> not ensured. Meanwhile, no attempts of looting <b>the</b> <b>collection</b> <b>were</b> reported, though <b>the</b> seeming patron-less future of <b>the</b> <b>collection</b> <b>was</b> uncertain.|$|R
50|$|The museum have {{extensive}} collections of mammals, birds, skeletons, animal tracks, springtails, mollusks and corral. <b>The</b> <b>collections</b> in <b>the</b> museum <b>are</b> the second-largest {{of its kind}} in Denmark both in regards to size of <b>the</b> <b>collection</b> and size of the exhibition area- The largest parts of <b>the</b> <b>collections</b> <b>are</b> stored with only a small segment in <b>the</b> exhibition. <b>The</b> <b>collections</b> <b>are</b> used in ongoing research which mainly takes place in Denmark. Parts of <b>the</b> <b>collections</b> <b>are</b> on display in four permanent exhibitions and changing special exhibitions.|$|R
5|$|A {{significant}} and growing proportion of <b>the</b> <b>collection</b> <b>is</b> now {{made available to}} readers as surrogate facsimiles, either on microfilm, or, more recently, in digitised form. In 2010 a ten-year programme of digitisation of the newspaper archives with commercial partner DC Thomson subsidiary Brightsolid began, and the British Newspaper Archive was launched in November 2011. A dedicated newspaper reading room opened at St Pancras in April 2014, including facilities for consulting microfilmed and digital materials, and, where no surrogate exists, hard-copy material retrieved from Boston Spa.|$|E
5|$|As {{the museum}} {{moved to the}} National Mall in the mid 1980s, its {{permanent}} collection consisted of more than 6,000 art objects (e.g., sculpture, artifacts, textiles) and the large Elisofon photography collection. This original collection focused on Sub-Saharan Africa, with better representation of the Guinea coast and Western Sudan than the Central African region. <b>The</b> <b>collection</b> <b>is</b> idiosyncratic, reflecting the relative lack of colonial era African art acquisitions in American donor collections. Some early highlights of the museum's collection include an Edo–Portuguese ivory spoon and an Akan gold pendant bequeathed by the Robert Woods Bliss estate. The museum's first acquisitions budget came with joining the Smithsonian.|$|E
5|$|In Buah Rindu, Amir {{shows an}} {{affinity}} for using traditional Malay poetic forms such as the quatrain, but unlike the highly fixed traditional forms, he mixes the rhyming patterns. The text is dominated by terms related to love and searching, and according to Dutch scholar of Indonesian literature A. Teeuw <b>the</b> <b>collection</b> <b>is</b> united by a theme of longing. Johns states that the imagery in Buah Rindu is dependent on traditional Malay literature, and that Amir's terminology is heavily influenced by classical Malay poetry. The author's use of language is also notably coloured by Javanese terms and ideas, and another source of influence appears to be Indian literature, with references to Hindu gods and goddesses.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>collection</b> <b>was</b> first {{published}} in 1881 by editor Victor Havard. <b>The</b> <b>collection</b> <b>was</b> well received by many critics and by the public. It enjoyed a number of reprints within the ten years agreed with the publishing company.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Fletcher <b>Collection</b> <b>is</b> Hugh Greenwell Fletcher's {{lifetime}} philatelic {{collection of}} British postage stamps and British stamps used abroad including overprints and non-stamp {{items such as}} postal stationery. On his death in 1968 (aged 86), <b>the</b> <b>collection</b> <b>was</b> bequeathed to <b>the</b> Bruce Castle Museum in Tottenham, once the home of Sir Rowland Hill. <b>The</b> <b>collection</b> <b>was</b> donated to <b>the</b> British Library in 1989.|$|R
50|$|The {{loss of the}} 1806 {{shipment}} {{was perhaps}} {{a blessing in disguise}} since it ultimately enhanced Giesecke's reputation in Britain. <b>The</b> <b>collection</b> <b>was</b> examined by <b>the</b> mineralogist Robert Jameson, who, unaware of its provenance, concluded it was worthless. Ninian Imrie and Thomas Allan suspected that a white mineral in <b>the</b> <b>collection</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> rare cryolite and bought the lot. However, it was only when Morten Wormskjold was detained in Edinburgh on his way to Greenland in 1812 that he could identify the collector as Giesecke and the provenance as Greenland. Another mineral in <b>the</b> <b>collection</b> <b>was</b> later named allanite after Thomas Allan. Thus the value of <b>the</b> <b>collection</b> <b>was</b> ultimately recognized prior to Giesecke's return to Europe.|$|R
5|$|Items of {{jewellery}} {{made before}} the death of Queen Victoria in 1901 are regarded as heirlooms owned by the Queen in right of the Crown and pass from one monarch to the next in perpetuity. Objects made later, including official gifts, can also be added {{to that part of}} the Royal Collection at the sole discretion of the monarch. It is not possible to say how much <b>the</b> <b>collection</b> <b>is</b> worth because the jewels have a rich and unique history, and they will likely never be sold on the open market.|$|E
5|$|The Gateway Foundation already owned {{two of the}} {{two dozen}} pieces prior to Citygarden's creation, and it {{purchased}} the remaining number between 2006 and 2009. The organization has not revealed the cost of acquiring the sculptures, an amount {{not included in the}} $30 million; however, it is estimated that <b>the</b> <b>collection</b> <b>is</b> worth around $12 million, if not more. The garden has received criticism from those who think that 24 sculptures is too many in such a small space.|$|E
5|$|The Getty Villa {{is one of}} two {{locations}} of the J. Paul Getty Museum. Located at the easterly end of the Malibu coast in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood of Los Angeles, California, USA, the Getty Villa is an educational center and museum dedicated {{to the study of the}} arts and cultures of ancient Greece, Rome, and Etruria. The collection has 44,000 Greek, Roman, and Etruscan antiquities dating from 6,500BC to 400AD, including the Lansdowne Heracles and the Victorious Youth. The UCLA/Getty Master’s Program in Archaeological and Ethnographic Conservation is housed on this campus. <b>The</b> <b>collection</b> <b>is</b> documented and presented through the online GettyGuide as well as through audio tours.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>collection</b> <b>was</b> {{formally}} {{announced at}} the 2010 Tokyo Game Show. In the months prior, <b>the</b> <b>collections</b> existence <b>was</b> hinted by industry rumors and appearances of <b>the</b> <b>collection</b> on on-line vendor catalogs.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>collection</b> <b>was</b> {{regularly}} {{expanded by}} donations, especially <b>the</b> Haubrich <b>collection</b> of contemporary art, in 1946. In 1976, {{on the occasion}} of the donation of Mr. and Mrs. Ludwig, <b>the</b> <b>collection</b> <b>was</b> split. <b>The</b> new Museum Ludwig took over the exhibition of the 20th century art.|$|R
5000|$|It {{is unclear}} at exactly what point Kathleen Garman and Sally Ryan {{conceived}} {{of making a}} collection of art. It has <b>been</b> suggested that <b>the</b> <b>collection</b> <b>was,</b> in part, {{in response to the}} death of Jacob Epstein (Kathleen's husband) whose work and own personal artefacts feature heavily within <b>the</b> <b>collection.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Collection</b> <b>was</b> largely assembled between 1959 and 1973.|$|R
5|$|The Palace Museum holds {{close to}} 50,000 paintings. Of these, more than 400 date {{from before the}} Yuan dynasty (1271–1368). This is the largest such {{collection}} in China. <b>The</b> <b>collection</b> <b>is</b> based on the palace collection in the Ming and Qing dynasties. The personal interest of Emperors such as Qianlong meant that the palace held {{one of the most}} important collections of paintings in Chinese history. However, a significant portion of this collection was lost over the years. After his abdication, Puyi transferred paintings out of the palace, and many of these were subsequently lost or destroyed. In 1948, many of the works were moved to Taiwan. The collection has subsequently been replenished, through donations, purchases, and transfers from other museums.|$|E
5|$|The Wagga Wagga Regional Art Gallery hosts local {{collections}} and travelling exhibitions and has space for an Artist in residence. The centrepiece of <b>the</b> <b>collection</b> <b>is</b> the National Art Glass Gallery, a nationally significant collection of studio art glass hosted in a separate, specially designed gallery. The collection was first {{established by the}} former director of the Wagga Wagga Regional Art Gallery, Judy Le Lievre in response to a request by the Australia Council for regional galleries to develop a specialised collection to avoid duplication and competition. The collection consists of around 400 works making it the largest studio glass collection in Australia.|$|E
5|$|The {{entrance}} is resolved {{in a manner}} simultaneously elegant and eccentric, in an almost exuberant and free syntax. The canonical orders are absent, and <b>the</b> <b>collection</b> <b>is</b> conceived as an imaginative blend of quasi-archaeological redeployment. For this reason, critics do not attribute the project to Cairano, which remains a formidable invention that is highly representative of antiquarian culture of the time. Surely Cairano's, however, is the hand that produced the sculptures along with anthropomorphic figures, dolphins and fantastic creatures, the artist already experimented with these in the Loggia; and once again, the artist inserted small Caesars, both on the portal {{as well as the}} overpass, which achieve the poetic zenith of some of his portraiture of old.|$|E
5000|$|... 2008, <b>The</b> men's shoe <b>collection</b> <b>was</b> {{launched}} under <b>the</b> name Ong London. Named after British film directors, <b>the</b> <b>collection</b> <b>was</b> {{an instant}} success.|$|R
50|$|The largest part of <b>the</b> <b>collections</b> <b>are</b> {{stored in}} a 60-meter-high tower, a {{landmark}} in Leiden, opened in April 1998.

5000|$|The Woman’s Club of Boca Raton {{started the}} {{community}} library in January, 1923.

It closed in 1926 and <b>the</b> <b>collection</b> <b>was</b> donated to a local elementary school.|$|R
5|$|The {{prints and}} {{drawings}} department encompasses works on paper. The {{origins of the}} collection were the 8,600works in the Royal Collection (Cabinet du Roi), which were increased via state appropriation, purchases such as the 1,200works from Fillipo Baldinucci's collection in 1806, and donations. The department opened on 5 August 1797, with 415pieces displayed in the Galerie d'Apollon. <b>The</b> <b>collection</b> <b>is</b> organized into three sections: the core Cabinet du Roi, 14,000royal copper printing-plates, and the donations of Edmond de Rothschild, which include 40,000prints, 3,000drawings, and 5,000illustrated books. The holdings are displayed in the Pavillon de Flore; due to {{the fragility of the}} paper medium, only a portion are displayed at one time.|$|E
5|$|The serious {{collection}} and publication of Washington's documentary record {{began with the}} pioneer work of Jared Sparks in the 1830s in Life and Writings of George Washington (12 vols., 1834–1837). The Writings of George Washington from the Original Manuscript Sources, 1745–1799 (1931–44) is a 37 volume set edited by John C. Fitzpatrick. It contains over 17,000 letters and documents and is available online from the University of Virginia. The definitive letterpress edition of his writings was begun by the University of Virginia in 1968, and today comprises 52 published volumes, with more to come. It contains everything written by Washington or signed by him, together with most of his incoming letters. Part of <b>the</b> <b>collection</b> <b>is</b> available online from the University of Virginia.|$|E
5|$|Also on {{show is a}} late 19th-century shambar (large veil) from Bayt Jibrin worn at {{weddings and}} festivals. It is made of {{embroidered}} handwoven black silk with a separate heavy red silk fringe. A woman wore the shambar mainly on her wedding day, positioned so that when she covered her face the embroidered end would show. Another item in <b>the</b> <b>collection</b> <b>is</b> a headdress (iraqiyeh) embroidered with cross-stitch and decorated with Ottoman coins minted in AH 1223 (1808), as well as Maria Theresa coins. The iraqiyeh was worn by married women and elaborate pieces were passed down as family heirlooms. Long embroidered headbands made of cotton hanging from both sides were wrapped around the woman's braids to facilitate the bundling of her hair, then secured {{to the back of}} the headdress.|$|E
50|$|The first tries of coin {{collecting}} by {{the state}} began shortly after the independence of Greece in Aegina. <b>The</b> <b>collection</b> <b>was</b> enriched after excavations, purchases and donations. The museum was founded in 1838, around the same era with the National Archaeological Museum {{but it was not}} until many years after and several decrees that became an independent organization. Initially, <b>the</b> <b>collection</b> <b>was</b> a part of the National Library of Greece and was housed at the main building of the University of Athens and later at the building of the Academy of Athens where <b>the</b> <b>collection</b> <b>was</b> first exhibited. In 1946, <b>the</b> <b>collection</b> <b>was</b> moved at <b>the</b> National Archaeological Museum. The organization of the museum became twice independent, in 1893 and 1965.|$|R
50|$|City {{officials}} also commissioned a new inventory of all artifacts housed at the Mid-America All-Indian Center. <b>The</b> <b>collection</b> <b>was</b> recorded, photographed and digitized. The museum's computer database were upgraded and modernized for better record keeping. All {{of the missing}} items from <b>the</b> <b>collection</b> <b>were</b> ultimately found.|$|R
50|$|The Kentucky Folk Art Center was {{established}} in 1985 as part of Morehead State University's Folk Art <b>Collection.</b> <b>The</b> <b>collection</b> <b>was</b> housed on two separate buildings on campus until 1997 when <b>the</b> <b>collection</b> <b>was</b> moved to <b>the</b> historic Union Grocery Building in Morehead's First Street Arts District.|$|R
