Counter {{abstraction}} {{allows us}} to transform a concurrent sys-tem with an unbounded number of agents into a finite-state bounded abstraction, independent {{of the number of}} processes present in the im-plementation. In its general form it is not well suited for verification of parameterised concurrent systems based on message passing that are not fully symmetric and/or use <b>two-way</b> <b>handshaken</b> synchronisation be-tween processes. In this paper we present a method whose main idea is to count processes that are in certain equivalence classes. We use la-belled transitions systems to model processes (both implementation and specification) and traces refinement for verification checks. Refinement is checked automatically using the FDR model checker. We illustrate the method on a token ring mutual exclusion algorithm from [8]. ...|$|R
30|$|In TPSN, the {{receiver}} synchronizes {{with the local}} clock of the sender according to the <b>two-way</b> message <b>handshake,</b> as shown in Fig. 7. For this reason, TPSN {{is based on a}} sender-receiver synchronization method. Hierarchical structures created by TPSN are similar to the structures created by NTP. Like in NTP, nodes may fail causing nodes to become unsynchronized. Also, nodes mobility can make the hierarchy useless, as they may move out of their levels. Therefore, nodes at level n cannot synchronize with nodes at level n− 1, without requiring additional and periodical synchronization.|$|R
30|$|To protect users’ privacy, Tsai et al. [10], Fu et al. [11], and Zhu et al. [12] {{respectively}} presented anonymous handover authentication protocols, which effectively {{protected the}} privacy of users from attackers. However, these protocols need at least three-way handshakes to implement the handover authentication process, which {{is associated with a}} high communication cost and authentication delay. To improve performances, Yang et al. [13] and He et al. [14] proposed anonymous handover authentication protocols, which only involved <b>two-way</b> <b>handshakes.</b> Later, Yang et al. [13] presented an anonymous handover authentication protocol by using group signature technique, where each access point (AP) is the group manager of an independent group signature system, and in the handover authentication process, mobile clients only need to send a group signature generated by an AP (AP 1) to a new AP (AP 2). If the group signature is valid, AP 2 will authenticate the mobile client; otherwise, AP 2 will reject the request. He et al. [14] described an anonymous handover authentication protocol by using pseudo identities. Mobile clients pre-apply pseudo identities (PID 1 …PIDn) from AS. The handover authentication process can be completed only by sending a PID (PIDi). However, both [13, 14] are based on bilinear pairings which have a high computational cost. To achieve a better performance, our previous works [15] and Chaudhry et al. [16] respectively used elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) to construct the protocols. However, both [15, 16] incur high computation overhead at the mobile client side and cannot provide batch authentication as well.|$|R
30|$|EDCA {{employs the}} CSMA/CA algorithm. Its {{operation}} bases on station contention for medium access using a backoff procedure. The latter involves waiting intervals of different length, called Arbitrary Distributed Interframe Spaces (AIFSs), and backoff intervals of different length, called Contention Windows (CWs), {{according to the}} priority of the corresponding packet buffer, called Access Category (AC). These different values of the intervals' length impose different access probabilities for the traffic packets based on their priorities. This way, traffic can be differentiated and QoS can be supported. Additionally, EDCA implements a collision avoidance technique using a <b>two-way</b> <b>handshake,</b> called RTS/CTS (Request To Send/Clear To Send). This technique handles to some degree the serious hidden station problem.|$|E

30|$|When all {{stations}} in multi-hop wireless networks {{are not in}} a single-radio range, carrier sense multiple access-based medium access control (MAC) protocols (<b>two-way</b> or four-way <b>handshake)</b> are known to exhibit severe throughput imbalances and few flows are even starved completely. It is very critical to analytically model such behavior and predict per-flow throughput for designing efficient networking protocols. Flow starvation can be modeled by computing conditional packet loss probability and busy time duration sensed by each station in the network. Accurate modeling of MAC behavior is very critical for modeling starvation and predicting per-flow throughput. However, traditional metrics like aggregate throughput and latency are not suitable for this purpose. In this work, we develop analytical model for conditional packet loss probability, computation of busy time, and per-flow throughput prediction for all the flows in multi-hop wireless network.|$|R
40|$|The rapid {{increase}} of the Internet connectivity and the data publishing activity, like user-generated con- tent, has lead Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to establish more efficient mechanisms for content delivery, such as caching. Mechanisms such as content-aware-networks and in-network caching reduce network load, server load, and user response time, thus, manage the network. How- ever, caching of content also raises major implications in terms of legal acts and bills (e. g., data privacy, copyright), dealing with access control, validation scheme, and regu- lations (e. g., contractual obligation, legal restrictions). In general, user-generated content is linked with sen- sitive information, such as geographical information, med- ical and financial information, personal identifiable data, photos, videos, and contact information. Therefore, {{it is essential to}} secure data and regulate access. The latter, is gained by including access control mechanisms in the data exchange process, where a user requesting data must prove his access rights. Therefore, a user has to show an access ticket, which includes his rights based on legal and regulative implications. In order to secure any kind of data exchange, authentication of each participating communi- cation entity (e. g., content owner, server, and end-user) is essential, {{which is part of the}} proposed <b>two-way</b> authenti- cation <b>handshake</b> in this paper that is performed to gener- ate a secure communication channel. The main contribution of this paper is to show that transmission, storage, and usage of user-generated data in caches within the network is manageable within the legal laws on sensitivity, copyright, and privacy. The scope of studying these laws, acts, and policies is restricted to Swit- zerland (CH), the European Union (EU), and the United States of America (USA).

Most high-performance MPI implementations use Rendezvous Protocol for efficient transfer of large messages. This protocol can be designed using either RDMA Write or RDMA Read.

40|$|Abstract — We {{describe}} a new synchronous and distributed {{medium access control}} (MAC) protocol for multihop wireless networks that provides bandwidth guarantees to unicast connections. Our MAC protocol {{is based on a}} slotted time division multiple access (TDMA) architecture, with a multi-mini-slotted signaling phase scheduling data transmissions over slots in the following data phase. Resolving contentions {{at the beginning of a}} frame allows for effective utilization of bandwidth. Our protocol essentially combines the benefits of TDMA architecture with the distributed reservation mechanism of IEEE 802. 11 MAC protocol, thereby performing well even at high loads. We implement a <b>two-way</b> <b>handshake</b> before each data slot to avoid deadlocks, a phenomena that plagues 802. 11. Through theoretical analysis, we derive the system throughput achieved by our MAC protocol.

30|$|This {{function}} is not specified in EAP-AKA protocol. However, {{for supporting the}} link layer security of the WLAN network, two encryption schemes are adopted in EAP-AKA. One is the traditional wired equivalent privacy (WEP) specified by IEEE 802.11 standards. However, some known weaknesses and vulnerabilities are suffered in the WEP today. As considering with higher level of security, the Wi-Fi protected access (WPA) specified by IEEE 802.11 i is adopted by the EAP-AKA protocol. When the RADIUS has successfully authenticated the UE through the EAP-AKA mutual authentication protocol, they will share related keys, such as MK, MSK, TEK, and EMSK. The MSK is designated as pairwise mater key (PMK) and delivered to the APs. Then the AP and MS using a four-way handshake and a <b>two-way</b> <b>handshake</b> generate a pairwise transient key (PTK) and a group transient key (GTK) to support IEEE 802.11 i encryption operation, respectively. Furthermore, IEEE 802.11 i encryption operations include RC 4 based encryption temporal key integrity protocol (TKIP) algorithm for integrity protection and advanced encryption standard (AES) algorithm counter mode CBC-MAC protocol (CCMP) for the confidentiality.|$|E
30|$|The SCA-MAC {{protocol}} (Hsu et al. 2007) senses {{the spectrum}} intelligently and accesses the unused or underutilized spectrum dynamically with minimum or no interference to PUs. Operating range and channel aggregation {{are the two}} basic control parameters for SCA-MAC and to achieve a higher spectrum utilization it employs CSMA/CA (Zuquete 2008) mechanism. For the continuous and rapid spectrum sensing, SCA-MAC uses a cyclostationery feature detection (Cabric et al. 2004; Kim and Shin 2008). This protocol can speed up the transmission by either using more than one channel for data transmission or can wait for some high bandwidth channel to become available. A global decentralized CR protocol SCA-MAC performs a <b>two-way</b> <b>handshake</b> by exchanging frames that contain the information of the best opportunity. SCA-MAC focuses on the data transmission but ignores the pre-transmission overheads. Of course, exchanging more frames as control information will not only delay for QoS aware data {{but it will also}} cause inefficient power consumption as nodes will have to wait longer before the actual transmission starts.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{international}} standard IEEE 802. 11 was developed recently {{in recognition of}} the increased demand for wireless local area networks. Its medium access control mechanism is described according to a variant of the Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) scheme. Although collisions cannot always be prevented, randomised exponential backoff rules are used in the retransmission scheme to minimise the likelihood of repeated collisions. More precisely, the backoff procedure involves a uniform probabilistic choice of an integer-valued delay from an interval, where the size of the interval grows exponentially with regard to the number of retransmissions of the current data packet. We model the <b>two-way</b> <b>handshake</b> mechanism of the IEEE 802. 11 standard with a fixed network topology using probabilistic timed automata, a formal description mechanism in which both nondeterministic choice and probabilistic choice can be represented. From our probabilistic timed automaton model, we obtain a finite-state Markov decision process via a property-preserving discrete-time semantics. The Markov decision process is then verified using Prism, a probabilistic model checking tool, against probabilistic, timed properties such as “at most 5, 000 microseconds pass before a station sends its packet correctly. ”...|$|E
40|$|An {{abundance}} of spectrum access and sensing algorithms {{are available in}} the dynamic spectrum access (DSA) and cognitive radio (CR) literature. Often, however, the functionality and performance of such algorithms are validated against theoretical calculations using only simulations. Both the theoretical calculations and simulations come with their attendant sets of assumptions. For instance, designers of dynamic spectrum access algorithms often take spectrum sensing and rendezvous mechanisms between transmitter-receiver pairs for granted. Test bed designers, on the other hand, either customize so much of their design that it becomes difficult to replicate using commercial off the shelf (COTS) components or restrict themselves to simulation, emulation /hardware-in-Ioop (HIL), or pure hardware but not all three. Implementation studies on test beds sophisticated enough to combine the three aforementioned aspects, {{but at the same time}} can also be put together using COTS hardware and software packages are rare. In this paper we describe i) the implementation of a hybrid test bed using a previously proposed hardware agnostic system architecture ii) the implementation of DSA on this test bed, and iii) the realistic hardware and software-constrained performance of DSA. Snapshot energy detector (ED) and Cumulative Summation (CUSUM), a sequential change detection algorithm, are available for spectrum sensing and a <b>two-way</b> <b>handshake</b> mechanism in a dedicated control channel facilitates transmitter-receiver rendezvous...|$|E
30|$|In {{handover}} authentication protocol, re-authentication delay {{refers to}} {{from beginning to}} the end of the handover authentication phase. Here we do not consider those efficient operations that have little effect on the handover authentication delay (such as hash evaluation and so on) and communication costs are directly determined by the number of communications between the MC and the MR. Hence, we analyzed our communication costs by comparing the number of handshake times (TH) with other protocols. From Table  1, we can see that [13] needs three-way handshake in handover authentication, while others only take <b>two-way</b> <b>handshake.</b> In terms of the computation cost, compared with [10], our protocol cannot only complete a handover authentication without complex bilinear pairing operation, but also take less TE operations. Besides, the computation cost is obviously reduced in our protocol compared with other related protocols [15, 21]. The proposed protocol only needs to take two TE operations to complete a handover authentication process, while [15, 21] must take five and eight respectively. Additionally, only the protocol presented in Tsai et al. [10] and our protocol can support batch authentication which can substantially reduce computation load. According to [22], the running time of pairing operations TP and elliptic curve scalar multiplication operation TE are about 20.04 ms and 2.21 ms. As shown in Table  1, the total handover authentication delay of the protocol we put forward is about 2 TH+ 6.63 ms, and [10, 13, 15, 21] are about 2 TH+ 39.93 ms, 3 TH+ 8.84 ms, 2 TH+ 11.05 ms, and 2 TH+ 17.86 ms respectively. Therefore, from the performance analysis, we can conclude that the proposed protocol achieves a better performance than other closely related ones [10, 13, 15, 21].|$|E
30|$|The {{iterative}} AVs generation {{establishes a}} secure AVs and key sets generation operation {{that results in}} generating fresh AVs and keys to secure the communications between the AP and the MS. Moreover, iterative localized re-authentication is completed efficiently with minimum communications between the MS and the AP. As the MS responses the Fast_ID(i - 1) to requests a re-authentication access again and demonstrates the temporal identity is valid, FIL re-authentication protocol is trigger to invoke the new round iterative process. Then the new round iterative AVs generation shown in Figure 5 is also invoked in the LAA. In Figure 5, the LAA first acquires Fast_ID(i - 1) and MK(i - 1) attributes from the its database and generates new Counter_A(i) and Nonce_A(i) attributes where the index 'i' denotes the number of iterative process. Second, for the user identity privacy in the next round iterative process, the AP also generates new temporal Fast_ID, denoted as Fast_ID(i). Then new mater key denoted as MK(i) is derived as MK(i) = SHA - 1 (Fast_ID(i - 1) || Counter_A(i) || Nonce_A(i) || MK(i - 1)). Other new key sets included K_auth(i) and K_encr(i) are also acquired by using the PRF according to MK(i) key. Finally, new key sets (MK(i), K_auth(i) and K_encr(i)), Fast_ID(i), Counter_A(i), and Nonce_A(i) attributes need to store back to the AP's database for supporting the execution of following security-related functions of this round iterative localized re-authentication and the next round iterative process. When completing above operation, it represents that one round iterative AVs generation operation has been accomplished. Subsequently, other security-related functions can be executed between the AP and the MS in order during this round iterative localized re-authentication. In the final 802.11 i encryption function, new re-derived key sets results in generating fresh PTK and GTK by using a four-way handshake and a <b>two-way</b> <b>handshake</b> to support IEEE 802.11 i encryption operation. As the 802.11 i encryption function has been completed, it represents that this round localized re-authentication has been finished. When the next round iterative process is invoked, the next round iterative AVs generation is also invoked.|$|E
