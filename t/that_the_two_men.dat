5|$|The scene {{abruptly}} {{changes to}} the house {{from the beginning of}} the film. Two figures that appear to be Kelvin and his father embrace at the doorstep. However, after showing rainwater in the house, the camera pans out and reveals <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> are on an island in the Solaris ocean.|$|E
5|$|During World War I, Burnham {{was living}} in California and was active in counterespionage for Britain. Much of it {{involved}} a famous Boer spy, Captain Fritz Joubert Duquesne, who became a German spy in both World Wars and claimed to have killed Field Marshal Kitchener while en route {{to meet with the}} Russians. During the Second Boer War, Burnham and Duquesne were each under orders to assassinate the other, {{but it was not until}} 1910 <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> first met while both were in Washington, D.C., separately lobbying Congress to pass a bill in favor of the importation of African game animals into the United States (H.R. 23621). Duquesne was twice arrested by the FBI and in 1942 he and 32 other Nazi agents (the Duquesne Spy Ring) were jailed for espionage in the largest spy ring conviction in U.S. history.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before the}} election, {{tensions}} grew between the French and British delegations, already in Singapore. The Paris bid team considered submitting {{a complaint against}} London bid consultants Jim Sloman and Rod Sheard after they stated that the Stade de France was not adequate for athletics, an action that goes against the IOC rules which forbid any bid to make statements about a rival bid. The London team promptly denied <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> were under contract with the bid at that time, and underlined that their opinions did not reflect {{the views of the}} London bid.|$|E
60|$|It seemed one impulse <b>that</b> made <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> clasp each other's {{hand for}} a moment.|$|R
50|$|Examination of <b>the</b> remains showed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> young <b>men</b> {{had been}} handcuffed and executed.|$|R
60|$|This {{little story}} had taken {{some time in}} <b>the</b> telling, so <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> young <b>men</b> had now reached their hotel.|$|R
5|$|Faced {{with such}} {{conflicting}} accounts {{and unable to}} reach a conclusion, the Parlement announced on 15 September <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> would {{fight to the death}} on 27 November 1386 to decide guilt in the case. If Carrouges lost, then Marguerite would be burnt at the stake for perjury. In fact, the duel was delayed a month as the King and his court, which contained most of the country's senior dukes and generals, was held up on campaign in Flanders and could not return in time. Eager to see what was rapidly becoming the event of the season, the King ordered the duel postponed until 29 December so that he would be present for its culmination.|$|E
5|$|Returning to the United States in July 1920, Somervell {{was posted}} to the Office of the Chief of Engineers in Washington, D.C. His war record {{earned him a}} place at the Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, {{reserved}} for the Army's best and most promising officers. He once again ranked near the top of his class. After graduation he was posted to the 1st New York Engineer District but soon obtained leave to assist Hines with a special study of navigation on the Rhine and Danube Rivers on behalf of the League of Nations, essentially a continuation of the work <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> had done in 1920. He then attended the Army War College from 1925 to 1926.|$|E
5|$|The next year, {{he began}} {{printing}} with a partner, William Seres; the two based their {{operations at the}} parish of St Sepulchre in London. Day and Seres specialised in religious works, such as those by Robert Crowley, which were largely related to theological controversies of the time. The Protestant Reformation was advancing rapidly, and the laws against the publication of heretical works were being relaxed. In 1548, ten of the twenty works <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> published were devoted to criticizing the Catholic belief of transubstantiation. One of those publications, a satirical poem by Luke Shepherd titled Iohn Bon and Mast Person, almost landed Day in jail. Day and Seres also translated important works of Continental Protestantism for the English market, notably Herman von Wied's A Simple and Religious Consultation in 1547.|$|E
50|$|Around <b>that</b> time, <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> {{engaged in}} an epistolary correspondence. However, when they met in person in 1825, they quarrelled; the details are not known.|$|R
60|$|For a {{week they}} did little but rest, D'Arnot {{coaching}} Tarzan in French. At <b>the</b> end of <b>that</b> time <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> could converse quite easily.|$|R
50|$|Sotoudeh {{said she}} was shocked <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> convicted <b>men</b> were {{executed}} in secret, {{and their families and}} lawyers informed only after the fact.|$|R
5|$|McAleer's {{tenure as}} {{part-owner}} of the Red Sox {{came to a}} swift end. On July 15, 1913, McAleer became involved in a dispute with the AL president, Ban Johnson, when McAleer forced the resignation of Red Sox manager Jake Stahl, one of Johnson's closest friends. While McAleer claimed that he released Stahl because of a foot injury preventing Stahl from serving as a player-manager, rumors suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> had strong personal differences. Following a bitter quarrel with Johnson, McAleer sold his holdings in the Red Sox. His feud with Johnson {{turned out to be}} a lifelong affair, despite efforts taken by their mutual friend, Charles Comiskey, to smooth over the rift. While McAleer never publicly discussed the disagreement that spurred his retirement, he supposedly relayed his version of events to Frank B. Ward, a sports reporter with The Youngstown Daily Vindicator, with the understanding that the details remain confidential until McAleer's death.|$|E
25|$|Six {{days after}} the bombing, RUC {{officers}} shot dead INLA members Seamus Grew and Roddie Carroll near a vehicle checkpoint in Armagh. The officers said they believed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> were ferrying McGlinchey into Northern Ireland. Neither was armed, nor was McGlinchey in their car.|$|E
25|$|While being interrogated, García claimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> {{had merely}} {{attempted}} to rape her. Her Catholic sensibilities {{and sense of}} shame prevented her from revealing the whole truth. At the jail, she was tested for drugs and alcohol but not for signs of rape. Castillo was never charged with any crime.|$|E
60|$|She was interested, too, rather sadly in {{the crusade}} without <b>the</b> cross <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> young <b>men</b> {{were trying to}} {{undertake}} against the wretchedness of those potters.|$|R
6000|$|... "Compel me!" [...] cried Ruby, drawing {{himself up}} {{with a look of}} {{defiance}} and a laugh of contempt, <b>that</b> caused <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> to shrink back in spite of themselves.|$|R
6000|$|There was a silence, and in <b>that</b> silence <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> {{faced each}} other as if under some strange light. They seemed alien to each other, yet familiar, too. Bailey spoke first: ...|$|R
25|$|The {{names and}} fates {{of the other}} two men from {{lifeboat}} #4 are not known. Japanese records suggest that both men died in a Naval hospital within two weeks. But native and POW accounts suggest <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> survived much longer. One account claims that they were executed, along with other Allied POWs, during a rampage by Japanese officers in September 1945, a month after the surrender of Japan.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of 27 September 1972, the MRF shot dead Catholic {{civilian}} Daniel Rooney and wounded his friend Brendan Brennan. They were shot from a passing car while standing {{on a street corner}} at St James's Crescent, in the Falls district. The British Army told journalists <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> fired at an undercover patrol and that the patrol returned fire. It further claimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> were IRA members. The IRA, the men's families, and residents of the area denied this, and Rooney's name has never appeared on a republican roll of honour. An inquest was held in December 1973. The court was told that forensic tests on the men's hands and clothing found no firearms residue. The six soldiers involved repeated the British Army's claim, but they did not appear at the inquest. Their statements were read by a police officer and they were referred to by initials. In 2013, former MRF member 'Simon Cursey' again claimed that they were returning fire, but said that only one of the men was armed.|$|E
25|$|Police stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> {{that were}} shot by Davis were {{carrying}} sidearms but that no {{shots were fired}} from these weapons. It is disputed whether the firearms were licensed or not. A senior police officer has said that Haider had a criminal record and was previously involved in dacoity, but neighbors, friends and family {{of the young men}} stated that they had no criminal records or history of illegal activity.|$|E
5000|$|The song {{playing on}} <b>the</b> record player <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> older <b>men</b> are {{carrying}} is a re-recorded version of [...] "Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy" [...] by The Andrews Sisters on Capitol Records.|$|R

60|$|Just then Rollo {{observed}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> young <b>men</b> whom he and Josie {{had followed}} {{down into the}} crater were standing at a little distance, and attentively regarding some sort of instrument which they had in their hands.|$|R
25|$|Another claim {{over the}} estate was {{launched}} in 2012 by Boris Berezovsky. Berezovsky claimed that half of Badri's assets belong to him under a handshake agreement <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> made in 1995 to split all their commercial interests equally. However, following the judgement of Gloster J in Berezovsky v Abramovich 2012 that gave a damming report of Berezovsky's character, Berezovsky quickly settled his case against the Patarkatsishvili family. The details of the settlement however remained confidential.|$|E
25|$|Justinian was nervous: {{he was in}} {{the midst}} of {{negotiating}} with the Persians over peace in the east at the end of the Iberian War, there was enormous resentment over high taxes, and now he faced a potential crisis in his city. Facing this, he declared that a chariot race would be held on January 13 and commuted the sentences to imprisonment. The Blues and Greens responded by demanding <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> be pardoned entirely.|$|E
25|$|Heinrich Eggestein's {{return to}} Strasbourg is {{certainly}} verified, as he again got {{the rights of}} citizenship on 9 August 1459. However, {{it is not known}} whether and in what way Eggestein might have participated in the printing shop operated by Johannes Metelin in Strasbourg. It is indisputable, however, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> knew each other and had a close relationship. It is even thought to be possible that Mentelin and Eggestein swore to keep their knowledge of the art of book printing a secret, through an agreement which has unfortunately not been preserved.|$|E
25|$|On Gauss's recommendation, Friedrich Bessel {{was awarded}} an honorary doctor degree from Göttingen in March 1811. Around <b>that</b> time, <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> {{engaged in an}} epistolary correspondence. However, when they met in person in 1825, they quarrelled; the details are not known.|$|R

50|$|John Vickers {{has spent}} eight years hunting for the three men who murdered the woman he loved. He finds one, Woodson, and kills him in a gunfight, but not before {{learning}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> other <b>two</b> <b>men</b> have joined <b>the</b> U.S. Cavalry.|$|R
25|$|His successor, Frank Blake, {{previously}} {{served as}} the company's {{vice chairman of the}} board and executive vice president. Blake agreed to a much more conservative compensation package than Nardelli, that is very heavily dependent upon the success of the company. Although a longtime deputy to Nardelli at GE and Home Depot, Blake was said to lack Nardelli's hard edge and instead preferred to make decisions by consensus. Indeed, Blake repudiated many of his predecessor's strategies, and it has been reported <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> have not spoken since Nardelli departed Home Depot.|$|E
25|$|On April 12, 2008, Margarito {{engaged in}} a rematch with Cintron, who had won the IBF Welterweight title belt {{following}} his loss to Margarito in 2005. In the early rounds, Cintron struck Margarito with several flush power shots to the head, but Margarito remained unhurt and continued to execute a game plan of continuously moving forward and pressuring Cintron. In the sixth round, Margarito landed a liver shot, knocking Cintron out and taking the IBF title. As the referee counted Cintron out, HBO cameras captured Margarito from a neutral corner, gesturing upward with his arms and urging Cintron to get up so <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> could continue fighting.|$|E
25|$|The band {{were the}} subject of an hour-long {{television}} documentary entitled Hawkwind: Do Not Panic that aired on BBC Four as part of the Originals series. It was broadcast on 30 March 2007 and repeated on 10 August 2007. Although Brock participated in its making he did not appear in the programme, it is alleged that he requested all footage of himself be removed after he was denied any artistic control over the documentary. In one of the documentary's opening narratives regarding Brock, it is stated that he {{declined to be interviewed for}} the programme because of Nik Turner's involvement, indicating <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> have still not been reconciled over the xhawkwind.com incident.|$|E
