50|$|The {{first known}} {{automotive}} application of <b>toothed</b> <b>belts</b> to drive overhead camshafts was with Devin-Panhard racing specials built by Bill Devin for the Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) H-modified racing series. Some of these specials were powered by engines built from the crankcases of Panhard flat-twin engines and the cylinders of Norton motorcycles. The overhead camshafts on the Norton cylinders were driven by <b>toothed</b> <b>belts</b> from the Gilmer Belt Company {{instead of the}} tower shafts used in the Norton engines. Jimmy Orr won the 1956 SCCA H-modified championship in an overhead camshaft Devin-Panhard.|$|R
5000|$|A gilmer belt was a brand {{or trade}} {{name for a}} {{mechanical}} belt used for transferring power between axles in a machine. The gilmer belt was originally sold by the L. H. Gilmer company after 1949, and {{represents one of the}} earliest <b>toothed</b> <b>belt</b> designs. Gilmer belts use trapezoidal teeth to engage matching grooves on toothed pulleys in order to maintain synchronicity between moving parts. Belts are no longer sold under the Gilmer name, although enthusiasts are still likely to refer to <b>toothed</b> <b>belts</b> by the gilmer name.|$|R

50|$|The SuperFIRE {{features}} a unique control {{system of the}} engine timing distribution: A <b>toothed</b> <b>belt</b> drives the camshaft of the exhaust valves, which in turn drives the intake camshaft via a gear.|$|R
50|$|As <b>toothed</b> <b>belts</b> {{can deliver}} {{more power than}} a friction-drive belt, they are used for {{high-power}} transmissions. These include the primary drive of some motorcycles, notably later Harley-Davidsons; and the supercharger used for dragsters.|$|R
50|$|The Endura-DE engine {{features}} a cast iron block and indirect injection style cylinder head, which {{means there is}} a combustion chamber built into the cylinder head. This engine makes use of aluminium for some other components to minimise the weight penalty of the Diesel engine. It has a single overhead camshaft opening eight valves via shim-and-bucket followers. The camshaft is rotated by a <b>toothed</b> <b>belt</b> driven by a toothed sprocket on the Crankshaft, likewise the fuel injection pump is rotated by a second <b>toothed</b> <b>belt</b> driven from the crankshaft. The diesel injection pump is a rotary distributor type most typically made by Lucas CAV.|$|R
50|$|Aero-engine {{reduction}} gears are typically of the gear type, but smaller two-stroke engines {{such as the}} Rotax 582 use <b>belt</b> drive with <b>toothed</b> <b>belts,</b> which is a cheap and lightweight option with built-in damping of power surges.|$|R

50|$|The {{majority}} of fused filament printers {{follow the same}} basic design. A flat bed is used {{as the starting point}} for the print workpiece. A gantry above this carries the moving print head. The gantry design is optimised for movement mostly in the horizontal X & Y directions, with a slow climb in the Z direction as the piece is printed. Stepper motors drive the movement through either leadscrews or <b>toothed</b> <b>belt</b> drives. It is common, owing to the differences in movement speed, to use <b>toothed</b> <b>belts</b> for the X,Y drives and a leadscrew for Z. Some machines also have X axis movement on the gantry, but move the bed (and print job) for Y. As, unlike laser cutters, head movement speeds are low, stepper motors are universally used and {{there is no need to}} use servomotors instead.|$|R
50|$|The Slant Four {{is a type}} of car engine {{manufactured}} by Vauxhall Motors and, in modified form, by Lotus Cars.

5000|$|The angular-velocity ratio {{may not be}} {{constant}} {{or equal}} to that of the pulley diameters, due to slip and stretch. However, this problem has been largely solved by the use of <b>toothed</b> <b>belts.</b> Working temperatures range from [...] to [...] Adjustment of center distance or addition of an idler pulley is crucial to compensate for wear and stretch.|$|R
5000|$|A bicycle {{chain is}} a form of roller chain. Bicycle chains may have a master link, or may require a chain tool for removal and installation. A similar but larger and thus {{stronger}} chain is used on most motorcycles although it is sometimes replaced by either a <b>toothed</b> <b>belt</b> or a shaft drive, which offer lower noise level and fewer maintenance requirements.|$|R
50|$|Idler gears {{can also}} {{transmit}} rotation among distant shafts {{in situations where}} it would be impractical to simply make the distant gears larger to bring them together. Not only do larger gears occupy more space, the mass and rotational inertia (moment of inertia) of a gear is proportional to the square of its radius. Instead of idler gears, a <b>toothed</b> <b>belt</b> or chain can be used to transmit torque over distance.|$|R
40|$|The {{synchronous}} transmissions {{are nearly}} universal application, in all cases, or the user {{wants to have}} a synchronous operation and without sliding. They are found in diverse areas as micromechanics, office automation, machine tools and industrial shredders. Considering the important role of synchronous belts in the functioning of mechanisms, they are the subject of many studies and research in order to define more finely. Behavior of mechanisms that lead is influenced by their mechanical characteristics. Also, to better master their behavior, extent of the characteristics of longitudinal stiffness and stiffness of the teeth is required. In addition, these parameters are input data for the models for calculating the life and dynamic behavior synchronous transmissions. An approach for the determination of the longitudinal stiffness is presented. We have highlighted a study comparing the measurement of the rigidity of a <b>toothed</b> <b>belt</b> by two methods. This is to qualify the first method of measurement through experimentation. And the second measurement method using the simulation of this <b>toothed</b> <b>belt</b> by software solidworks...|$|R
50|$|With {{help from}} Norton {{motorcycle}} racer Don Evans, Devin adapted the cylinder barrels, cylinder heads and pistons from the Norton Manx motorcycle to the two-cylinder boxer Panhard crankcase, roller-bearing crankshaft assembly and piston rods. He then fabricated a custom manifold that accepted two-barrel side-draft Weber carburetors. All of these alterations {{did not affect}} the displacement of the engine, leaving the 79.5mm bore and 75mm stroke unchanged for a total displacement of 745cc. What made the engine unique was the method Devin used to operate the valves. He abandoned the Panhard's pushrod OHV system and contacted the L. H. Gilmer company about using their <b>toothed</b> <b>belts</b> to drive the Manx cylinder heads' overhead cams. Development of synchronous toothed-belts was begun by the Gilmer company around 1940. Their primary application had been as a means of transmitting power in textile mills. Devin's use of the technology to drive the valve train in the Devin-Panhard engine was the first time <b>toothed</b> <b>belts</b> were used in a timing belt application. Devin did not apply for a patent on this innovation.|$|R
