50|$|The exact changes {{happening}} to ENSO {{in the future}} is uncertain: Different models make different predictions. It may be that the observed phenomenon of more frequent and stronger El Niño events occurs only in the initial phase of the global warming, and then (e.g., after the lower layers of the ocean get warmer, as well), El Niño will become weaker than it was. It may also be that the stabilizing and destabilizing forces influencing the phenomenon will eventually compensate for each other. More research is needed to provide a better answer to that question. The ENSO {{is considered to be a}} potential <b>tipping</b> <b>element</b> in Earth's climate and, under the global warming, can enhance or alternate regional climate extreme events through a strengthened teleconnection. For example, an increase in the frequency and magnitude of El Niño events have triggered warmer than usual temperatures over the Indian Ocean, by modulating the Walker circulation. This has resulted in a rapid warming of the Indian Ocean, and consequently a weakening of the Asian Monsoon.|$|E

Modeling predictions show that implementation of adaptive forests management (including genetic efforts, activities addressed to increase permafrost protection forest services, special preparation of structure of forest landscapes) could substantially mitigate the expected risks. We discuss specific features of transformative adaptation. As long as practically all forests in Russia are in the state property, there is a legislative and institutional background for introduction of adaptive forest management in Russia.

40|$|The Asian monsoon {{system has}} been {{recognised}} as an important <b>tipping</b> <b>element</b> in Earth's climate. In this work, we apply recurrence networks, a recently developed technique for nonlinear time series analysis of palaeoclimate data, for detecting episodes with pronounced changes in Asian monsoon dynamics during the last 10 ka in speleothem records from 10 caves covering the major branches of the Asian monsoon system. Our methodology includes multiple archives, explicit consideration of dating uncertainties with the COPRA approach and rigorous significance testing for the coexistence of monsoonal regime shifts at multiple locations to ensure a robust detection of continental-scale changes in monsoonal dynamics. This approach enables us to identify several epochs characterised by nonlinear regime shifts in Asian monsoon variability (8. 5 – 8. 0, 5. 7 – 5. 4, 4. 1 – 3. 6 and 2. 8 – 2. 2 ka BP), the timing of which suggests a connection to high-latitude Bond events and other episodes of Holocene rapid climate change (RCC). Interestingly, we also observe a previously unnoticed episode of significantly increased regularity of monsoonal variations around 7. 3 ka BP, a timing {{that is consistent with}} the typical 1. 0 – 1. 5 ka return intervals of Bond events. A possible solar forcing of the detected nonlinear regime shifts in Asian monsoon dynamics is suggested by their co-occurence with pronounced minima and strong variability in solar activity. Drawing on a comprehensive review of the Holocene archeological record in the Asian monsoon realm, we find that these regime shifts partly coincide with known major periods of migration, pronounced cultural changes, and the collapse of ancient human societies. These findings indicate that also future transitions in monsoonal dynamics could induce potentially severe socio-economic impacts of climate change...|$|E
40|$|The Asian monsoon {{system is}} an {{important}} <b>tipping</b> <b>element</b> in Earth’s climate with a large impact on human societies {{in the past and}} present. In light of the potentially severe impacts of present and future anthropogenic climate change on Asian hydrology, it is vital to understand the forcing mechanisms of past climatic regime shifts in the Asian monsoon domain. Here we use novel recurrence network analysis techniques for detecting episodes with pronounced non-linear changes in Holocene Asian monsoon dynamics recorded in speleothems from caves distributed throughout the major branches of the Asian monsoon system. A newly developed multi-proxy methodology explicitly considers dating uncertainties with the COPRA (COnstructing Proxy Records from Age models) approach and allows for detection of continental-scale regime shifts in the complexity of monsoon dynamics. Several epochs are characterised by non-linear regime shifts in Asian monsoon variability, including the periods around 8. 5 – 7. 9, 5. 7 – 5. 0, 4. 1 – 3. 7, and 3. 0 – 2. 4 ka BP. The timing of these regime shifts is consistent with known episodes of Holocene rapid climate change (RCC) and high-latitude Bond events. Additionally, we observe a previously rarely reported non-linear regime shift around 7. 3 ka BP, a timing that matches the typical 1. 0 – 1. 5 ky return intervals of Bond events. A detailed review of previously suggested links between Holocene climatic changes in the Asian monsoon domain and the archaeological record indicates that, in addition to previously considered longer-term changes in mean monsoon intensity and other climatic parameters, regime shifts in monsoon complexity might have played an important role as drivers of migration, pronounced cultural changes, and the collapse of ancient human societies...|$|E
40|$|The West Antarctic {{ice sheet}} (WAIS), whose bedrock is {{to a large}} extent below sea level, has been {{identified}} as a <b>tipping</b> <b>element</b> in Earth’s climate system because it could dramatically re- treat and cause important sea-level rise. Different mechanisms underlying instabilities of such marine ice sheets have been proposed in the literature, but the risk that these mechanisms could trigger an accelerated retreat of the WAIS is still an open question. In this oral communication, which results from the literature study that I carried out during this ongoing first year of my PhD, I will review two main mechanisms that can cause marine ice sheet instability. The first mechanism is the marine ice sheet instability explained by Weertman who hypothe- sizes that marine ice sheets grounded on bedrocks which deepen inland can be inherently unstable. I will focus my attention on the stability of the steady states of this nonlinear dyna- mical system, {{as well as on the}} critical values of the external forcing parameters responsible for abrupt changes in the system behaviour (critical transitions). I will review how geological data suggest that rapid ice sheet retreats explained by Weertman’s hypothesis occurred in Antarctica during the Pleistocene and the early Holocene. The recently observed accelerated ice loss of the Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers of the WAIS could also be considered as a consequence of this instability mechanism and could lead to an important contribution to sea-level rise in the future. The second mechanism that I will review is the binge-purge oscillation mechanism which could have caused the disintegration of the Laurentide ice sheet during the last glacial period. These oscillations could also explain future behaviour of the WAIS. Binge-purge oscillations are short periods of enhanced ice flow (purge phase) followed by periods of much slower flow (binge phase). These oscillations are usually explained by a thermal-gravitational instability which takes place when basal conditions change. I will focus my attention on the mathematical and physical conditions which can trigger this instability process, as well as on examples of such oscillations in the WAIS in the past...|$|E

These methods are also used for crack analysis in rock fracture mechanics. There are singularities for the stresses and displacements at the crack tips in fracture mechanics problem, which decrease {{the accuracy of the}} numerical results in areas very close to the crack ends. To overcome this, higher order elements and isoperimetric higher order elements have been used. Recently, special crack <b>tip</b> <b>elements</b> have been proposed and used in most of the numerical fracture mechanics models. These elements can drastically increase the accuracy of the results near the crack tips, but in most of the models only one special crack <b>tip</b> <b>element</b> has been used for each crack end. In this study the uses of higher order crack <b>tip</b> <b>elements</b> are discussed and a higher order displacement discontinuity method is used to investigate the effect of these elements on the accuracy of the results in some crack problems.

In this analysis both Mode I and Mode II stress intensity factors are computed. Some example problems are solved and the computed results are compared with the results given in the literature. The numerical results obtained here are in good agreement with those cited in the literature.

40|$|The {{literature}} on the costs of climate change often draws a link between climatic 'tipping points' and large economic shocks, frequently called 'catastrophes'. The use of the phrase 'tipping points' in this context can be misleading. In popular and social scientific discourse, 'tipping points' involve abrupt state changes. For some climatic 'tipping points,' the commitment to a state change may occur abruptly, but the change itself may be rate-limited and take centuries or longer to realize. Additionally, the connection between climatic 'tipping points' and economic losses is tenuous, though emerging empirical and process-model-based tools provide pathways for investigating it. We propose terminology to clarify the distinction between 'tipping points' in the popular sense, the critical thresholds exhibited by climatic and social 'tipping elements,' and 'economic shocks'. The last {{may be associated with}} <b>tipping</b> <b>elements,</b> gradual climate change, or non-climatic triggers.

40|$|In {{the present}} contribution, we propose a new XFEM based {{enrichment}} of the displacement field {{to allow for}} cracks that end or kink within an element.

Based on that the internal field vanish along the the crack <b>tip</b> <b>element</b> edges, it be implicitly solved for in terms of the macroscopic field.

For many years, the standard quarterpoint shape functions {{have been widely used}} for crack <b>tip</b> <b>elements</b> in finite and boundary element analyses.
