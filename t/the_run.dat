5|$|During <b>the</b> <b>run</b> of Patience, Carte {{built the}} large, modern Savoy Theatre, {{which became the}} partnership's {{permanent}} home. It was the first theatre (indeed the world's first public building) to be lit entirely by electric lighting. Patience moved into the Savoy after six months at the Opera Comique and ran {{for a total of}} 578 performances, surpassing <b>the</b> <b>run</b> of H.M.S.

5|$|The {{bobsleigh}} run (Pista Olimpica di Bob – Eugenio Monti), {{was originally}} constructed in 1928.

40|$|Pigeons {{searched for}} any of several targets in {{experiments}} designed to explore attentional priming or search-image formation. Three experiments assessed <b>the</b> <b>runs</b> advantage, seen in improved search efficiency during single-target trial sequences compared with search efficiency during mixed-target sequences. Experiment 1 varied {{the number of items}} in the search display and the target set. Well-practiced pigeons showed <b>the</b> <b>runs</b> advantage only for a display size of 36 and a target set of 8. Experiments 2 and 3 followed <b>the</b> <b>runs</b> effect over training. For a target set of 4, <b>the</b> <b>runs</b> advantage was present initially but diminished with practice. For a target set of 12, <b>the</b> <b>runs</b> advantage persisted. <b>The</b> data suggest that learning permits a shift from controlled to automatic processing of memory, but constrains the number of items that can be addressed in parallel...|$|R
50|$|Under {{the second}} circumstance, {{if there are}} runners on base and a batter hits a foul fly ball that is dropped, and then bats in the runners on base through a base hit (including a home <b>run),</b> <b>the</b> <b>runs</b> are unearned for the time being, as the runners should not have advanced. If {{the results of the}} {{remaining}} at bats in the inning would not have scored <b>the</b> runners, <b>the</b> <b>runs</b> remain unearned. However, if results of subsequent at bats would have scored <b>the</b> <b>runs</b> anyway, <b>the</b> <b>runs</b> would count as earned, unless they only would have scored {{as a result of a}} subsequent error or passed ball.|$|R

5|$|As {{the cars}} arrived in 1978 and 1979 Amtrak {{employed}} them on short-haul routes radiating from Chicago. The first coaches entered regular service on February 26, 1979, running from Chicago to Milwaukee. The coaches, {{led by an}} EMD F40PH locomotive, displaced the regular Turboliner equipment. The equipment continued to operate on <b>the</b> <b>run</b> for several weeks. The Illini and Shawnee trains received Superliner coaches soon after; the first Superliner dining car ran on the Shawnee as a lounge.|$|E
5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of an inning during which runs are scored after an error or passed ball, the official scorer attempts to recreate {{the events of the}} inning without the errors or passed balls. If in the official scorer's opinion a run would not have scored without the defensive lapses, then <b>the</b> <b>run</b> is unearned. If the scorer believes that a run would have scored anyway, <b>the</b> <b>run</b> is earned and charged to the pitcher. In one basic example, if the first batter reaches by an error, the second batter hits a home run, and the next three batters strike out, then one of the two runs which were scored are unearned. There are rules and restrictions which govern this general guideline.|$|E
