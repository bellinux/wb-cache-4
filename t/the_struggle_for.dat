5|$|A small neutral bloc arose {{with the}} Non-Aligned Movement; it sought good {{relations}} with both sides. The two superpowers never engaged directly in full-scale armed combat, but they were heavily armed {{in preparation for a}} possible all-out nuclear world war. Each side had a nuclear strategy that discouraged an attack by the other side, on the basis that such an attack would lead to the total destruction of the attacker—the doctrine of mutually assured destruction (MAD). Aside from the development of the two sides' nuclear arsenals, and their deployment of conventional military forces, <b>the</b> <b>struggle</b> <b>for</b> dominance was expressed via proxy wars around the globe, psychological warfare, massive propaganda campaigns and espionage, rivalry at sports events, and technological competitions such as the Space Race.|$|E

5|$|Darwin's aims were twofold: to {{show that}} species had not been {{separately}} created, and {{to show that}} natural selection had been the chief agent of change. He knew that his readers were already familiar {{with the concept of}} transmutation of species from Vestiges, and his introduction ridicules that work as failing to provide a viable mechanism. Therefore, the first four chapters lay out his case that selection in nature, caused by <b>the</b> <b>struggle</b> <b>for</b> existence, is analogous to the selection of variations under domestication, and that the accumulation of adaptive variations provides a scientifically testable mechanism for evolutionary speciation.|$|E
