40|$|Objectives: The present {{research}} {{was motivated by}} providing new insight into early pregnancies with a chorionic bump diagnosis in first-trimester sonography {{and its impact on}} live birth rate. Methods: To determine the rate of CB, first trimester sonograms of pregnant women referring to Akbarabadi Hospital, which is a treatment and training center affiliated to Iran University of Medical Sciences as well as those referring to a private center were analyzed. The total number of <b>transvaginal</b> <b>sonographies</b> performed was 1900 cases from whom 8 cases of CB were detected. The chorionic bump size and number and history of infertility or coagulation disorders were considered as our independent variables and multiple gestation with pregnancy outcome as dependent ones. Results: Overall, the prevalence rate of CB was 0. 4 % (4 per 1000), with 8 patients diagnosed with CB from 1900 the first trimester pregnant women. Of 8 pregnant women, 5 showed live birth (62. 5 %) and 3 experienced fetal demise (37. 5 %). The chorionic bumps ranged in size from 0. 1  cc to 1. 8  cc (average, 0. 73  cc). No significant relationship was found between history of smoking, coagulopathy, infertility, multiple gestation and the size of CB. Conclusions: The main finding was that the frequency of live birth in our sample was 62. 5 % (5 from 8). The clinical inference is that a chorionic bump on first-trimester sonography does not definitely guarantee a secure prediction.

SETTING AND PATIENT(S) : Consecutive patients, pregnant through IVF-ET, who presented with clinically suspected EP. INTERVENTION(S) : <b>Transvaginal</b> <b>sonography,</b> serum hCG measurement at 6, 9, and 15 days after ET and after a negative <b>transvaginal</b> <b>sonography.</b> MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) : Ectopic pregnancy confirmed at laparoscopy.

40|$|Objective. Fetuses {{affected}} by homozygous α-thalassemia- 1 develop anemia {{as early as}} the first trimester. Our objective was to study hemodynamic indices in affected fetuses at 12 - 13 weeks of gestation to determine whether these would be useful in the prediction of anemia. Design. Prospective observational study. Subjects. Women referred before 14 weeks of gestation for the prenatal diagnosis of homozygous α-thalassemia- 1. Methods. Transabdominal and/or <b>transvaginal</b> Doppler <b>sonography</b> was performed to measure the flow velocities in the fetal ascending aorta and pulmonary artery at 12 - 13 weeks. The Doppler indices were compared between those that were subsequently confirmed to be {{affected by}} homozygous α-thalassemia- 1 and those that were unaffected. Results. Between June 1997 and April 1998, 60 eligible women were recruited. Doppler examination was successful in 58 fetuses. Of these, 22 were subsequently confirmed to be affected by homozygous α-thalassemia- 1. The diagnosis was made by chorionic villus sampling and DNA analysis in two affected fetuses and by cordocentesis and hemoglobin evaluation in 20 affected fetuses. Hemoglobin concentrations could be measured in ten fetuses and these ranged from 4 to 8 g/dl. The affected fetuses had significantly higher peak velocities at the pulmonary valve and ascending aorta and a larger inner diameter of the pulmonary valve than that in unaffected fetuses. The total cardiac output was increased by one-third in affected fetuses and was mainly due to an increase of the right-side cardiac output. Conclusion. In the early stage of anemia, the fetus responds mainly by increasing its right-side cardiac output. However, there is extensive overlap of the values of cardiac output between the affected and the unaffected fetuses, precluding its use in the prediction of anemia. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Deep pelvic endometriosis {{is defined}} as subperitoneal {{infiltration}} of endometrial implants in the uterosacral ligaments, rectum, rectovaginal septum, vagina, or bladder. It is responsible for severe pelvic pain. Accurate preoperative assessment of disease extension is required for planning complete surgical excision, but such assessment is difficult with physical examination.

Furthermore, exploratory laparoscopy has limitations in demonstrating deep endometriotic lesions hidden by adhesions or located in the subperitoneal space. Despite some limitations, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is able to directly demonstrate deep pelvic endometriosis. The MR imaging features depend on the type of lesions: infiltrating small implants, solid deep lesions mainly located in the posterior cul-de-sac and involving the uterosacral ligaments and torus uterinus, or visceral endometriosis involving the bladder and rectal wall. Solid deep lesions have low to intermediate signal intensity with punctate regions of high signal intensity on T 1 -weighted images, show uniform low signal intensity on T 2 -weighted images, and can demonstrate enhancement on contrast-enhanced images.

The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} tumor stiffness by ultrasound elastography, which has the potential to provide additional information that is useful in predicting the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSC) patients. In total, 32 patients with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage III and IV epithelial ovarian cancer treated with NACT underwent <b>transvaginal</b> and transabdominal <b>sonography,</b> followed by elastography and finally, by interval cytoreduc-tive surgery. Histopathological analysis revealed 24 (75 %) HGSCs. The mean elasticity score was statistically higher for the post-NACT lesions than for the pre-NACT lesions (3. 13 ± 0. 57 vs. 2. 04 ± 0. 51, respectively; P< 0. 001). The median elasticity score for the pre-NACT lesions on the four-point scale was 2, and the score for the post-NACT lesions was 4. Cases of post-NACT with scores of 3 and 4 had a higher optimal cytoreduction rate than cases with scores of 1 and 2 (93. 8 vs. 25. 0 %, respectively; P< 0. 001).

40|$|PURPOSE: The rectoanal {{inhibitory}} reflex {{has been}} studied using various methods, e. g., anometry and electromyography. The {{aim of this study}} was to apply ultrasound for direct visualization of the rectoanal inhibitory reflex. METHOD: The rectoanal inhibitory reflex was induced in ten healthy females (age range, 21 - 55 years) by injection of small amounts of water (7, 12, and 20 ml), into the rectum. The intra- anal pressure was measured with a microtransducer and the rectoanal inhibitory reflex was visualized with real- time <b>transvaginal</b> or transperineal <b>sonography.</b> RESULTS: The rectoanal inhibitory reflex consisted of a reduction in the intra- anal pressure and relaxation of the internal anal sphincter, manifested as an increase in the inner diameter of the internal anal sphincter from the mean of 11 to 16 mm (P < 0. 001). Simultaneously, a wave of rectal contents entered the anal canal. The distance from the most distal border of the rectal contents to the anal verge decreased from a mean of 33 to 20 mm (P < 0. 001). The rectoanal inhibitory reflex ended with a retrograde transport returning anal contents into the rectum. During the retrograde transport a contraction in the internal anal sphincter was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The rectoanal inhibitory reflex can readily be visualized with ultrasound as a wave of rectal contents entering the anal canal. The transport into the anal canal was not of voluntary origin and could be either noticed or not noticed by the subjects. The observed retrograde transportation in the anal canal was not noted by the subjects; it is related to a contraction in the internal anal sphincter and visualized for the first time using ultrasound...|$|R

The increasing rate of Cesarean delivery plus rapid development of in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET) may increase the occurrence of CSP {{as well as the}} ratio of heterotopic CSP (HCSP) /CSP. Therefore, early {{diagnosis and}} management of CSP are necessary to avoid serious complications. And {{the purpose of this article}} is to evaluate the importance and feasibility of the first-trimester diagnosis and management of CSP after IVF-ET. Methods: All the 12 cases were secondary infertility patients who had a history of Cesarean section and underwent IVF-ET in our reproductive center. All cases with CSP were diagnosed using <b>transvaginal</b> color Doppler <b>sonography</b> (TVS). Medical, surgical and expectant managements were implemented, and the management results were traced. Results: Patients with CSP (n = 12) were diagnosed from January 2011 to April 2015, 6 (50 %) of which were HCSP. The prevalence of CSP was 1 : 1688 pregnancies. The gestational age ranged from 5 + 3 to 7 + 4 weeks in all CSP, and from 5 + 6 to 7 + 4 weeks in HCSP at diagnosis. Five patients received successful surgical treatment. The success rate of medical and expectant management was 50 % (1 / 2) and 100 % (5 / 5), respectively. One patient with failed medical management needed an emergency laparotomy to evacuate CSP. The uterus was preserved in all 12 patients. Conclusions: The Caesarean section and IVF-ET may increase the ratio of HCSP/CSP. TVS is a noninvasive and effective tool for use in diagnosing CSP. CSP should be carefully excluded in patients who have had a history of Caesarean section. Early diagnosis of CSP in the first trimester may contribute towards the preservation of uterus as well as intrauterine pregnancy (IUP) in HCSP...|$|R

Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted to analyze the test performance of the parameters, except for tumor vessel location, and to estimate the best cut-off value of the parameters studied to differentiate between malignant and benign tumors. Definitive histopathological diagnosis was obtained in every case and used as the 'gold standard'. There were 20 (25. 3 %) malignant and 59 (74. 7 %) benign masses. Color Doppler signals were detected in 100 % of the malignant masses (20 out of 20) and 74. 6 % (44 out of 59) of the benign masses, and the difference was found to be statistically significant (p < 0. 001). Tumor vessel location was central in 18 out of 20 (90 %) malignant masses, whereas it was peripheral in 39 out of 44 (88. 6 %) benign masses. ROC analysis showed that the best cut-off values for number of vessels, PSV, RIlowest, RImean, PIlowest and PImean were three vessels, 25 cm/s, 0. 45, 0. 55, 0. 90 and 1. 50, respectively. However, for all these parameters except RIlowest, there was a considerable overlap between benign and malignant tumors, with a high false-positive rate. In conclusion, in our experience, the parameters that performed best were the RIlowest with a cut-off value of 0. 45 (sensitivity 100 %; false-positive rate 11. 4 %) and central tumor vessel location (sensitivity 90 %; false-positive rate 11. 4 %) ...|$|R

40|$|Objective To {{analyze the}} {{usefulness}} of transvaginal color Doppler assessment of venous flow in the differential diagnosis of adnexal masses. Material and Methods Ninety-one consecutive patients (mean age: 46. 6 years, range: 16 – 81 years) diagnosed as having an adnexal mass were evaluated by <b>transvaginal</b> color Doppler <b>sonography</b> prior to surgery. Color Doppler was used to detect and analyze the flow velocity waveform from arterial and venous blood flow within the tumor. For arterial signals the resistance index and peak systolic velocity, and for veins the maximum venous flow velocity, were calculated. Receiver operator characteristic curves were plotted {{to determine the best}} venous flow velocity cut-off. According to our previous study using arterial Doppler, a tumor was considered as malignant when flow was detected and the lowest resistance index was ≤ 0. 45. Using venous Doppler a mass was considered as malignant when flow was detected and the venous flow velocity was ≥ the best cut-off found on the receiver operator characteristic curve. Definitive histopathological diagnosis was obtained in all cases. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for B-mode morphology (evaluation performed according to Sassone’s scoring system), arterial Doppler, venous Doppler, and a combination of both arterial and venous Doppler were calculated. Results Twenty-five masses (27. 5 %) were malignant and 66 (72. 5 %) benign. Arterial and venous flow was found more frequently in malignant than in benign masses (92 % vs. 41 % (P < 0. 001) and 72 % vs. 21 % (P < 0. 001), respectively). The resistance index was significantly lower in malignant tumors (0. 42 vs. 0. 60, P = 0. 0003). No differences were found in peak systolic velocity. Venous flow velocity was significantly higher in malignant masses (18. 1 cm/s vs. 8. 9 cm/s, P = 0. 0006). The best cut-off of venous flow velocity was 10 cm/s. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for morphology, arterial Doppler, venous Doppler, and the combination of both arterial and venous Doppler were 92 %, 71 %, 45 %, 96 %; 76 %, 95 %, 87 %, 91 %; 68 %, 94 %, 81 %, 89 %; and 88 %, 91 %, 79 %, 95 %, respectively. Conclusions Our results indicate that preoperative evaluation by venous flow assessment of adnexal masses may be useful to discriminate between malignant and benign tumors...|$|R
40|$|Along {{with the}} {{increasing}} rate of cesarean section (CS) births has been a concomitant decrease {{in the rate of}} vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC), mostly due to concerns about uterine rupture during a trial of labor (TOL). The risk of uterine rupture in laboring women with a previous CS must be balanced against the increasing current and future risk of peripartum hysterectomy with repeat cesarean. Improved prediction of uterine rupture could allow women at low risk to have a TOL, and those at high risk for uterine rupture could undergo a planned CS. Thinning in the lower uterine segment (LUS) measured by ultrasonography is a possible predictor of uterine rupture. The present study was performed to identify an optimal LUS thickness cutoff value and to define groups of women with a history of previous CS to whom TOL either should not be offered or could be offered safely. PubMed and EMBASE were searched for relevant articles published during 1980 to 2011. Included studies reported on pregnant women with at least 1 prior CS and on the sonographic appearance of the LUS during pregnancy in relation to uterine defects observed during or immediately after delivery. Studies were scored on methodologic and clinical characteristics. For each study, a 2 x 2 table was constructed, cross-classifying LUS thickness measured by ultrasound and the presence of LUS defect after delivery. Sensitivity and specificity were determined for each study in the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) space along with a corresponding summary ROC curve. From an initial 147 citations, 21 studies (all cohort design) were included and involved 2776 women. The median sample size was 71 (range, 10 - 642; interquartile range, 149. 5). Lower uterine segment measurements were obtained at 34 to 39 weeks' gestation. Cutoff values used to define an insufficient LUS ranged from 0. 5 to 3. 0 mm in studies measuring myometrial LUS thickness and from 1. 5 to 5. 1 mm in those using full LUS thickness. Full LUS thickness measurement using cutoffs of 2. 0 to 3. 0 mm had a specificity of 0. 91 (95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 80 - 0. 96) at a sensitivity of 0. 61 (95 % CI, 0. 42 - 0. 77). Full LUS thickness measurement using cutoffs of 3. 1 to 5. 1 mm had a specificity of 0. 63 (95 % CI, 0. 30 - 0. 87) at a sensitivity of 0. 96 (95 % CI, 0. 89 - 0. 98). The accuracy of <b>transvaginal</b> or transabdominal <b>sonography</b> could not be compared statistically because of the limited number of studies. The main finding is the strong negative correlation between LUS thickness and risk of uterine defect. The similar shapes of the ROC curves for myometrial and full LUS thickness indicated no significant difference in accuracy, shape, and position. An ideal screening test to predict uterine rupture could affect medical decision making by allowing accurate selection of women with a scarred uterus unlikely to have uterine rupture and thus able to have a TO...|$|R
