40|$|Light traps {{are one of}} {{a number}} of {{different}} gears used to sample pelagic larval and juvenile fishes. In contrast to conventional <b>towed</b> <b>nets,</b> light traps primarily collect larger size classes, including settlement-size larvae (Choat et al., 1993; Hickford and Schiel, 1999; Hernandez and Shaw, 2003), and, therefore, have become important tools for discerning recruitment dynamics (Sponaugle and Cowen, 1996; Wilson, 2001).

40|$|Cod, haddock, whiting, saithe, plaice, sole and Norway lobster are 7 main {{target species}} of the {{demersal}} mixed fisheries in the North Sea, Skagerrak and Eastern Channel. Gadoids and Norway lobsters are mainly taken in the nor-thern North Sea by towed gears except beam trawls while the flatfish fisheries are conducted in the southern North Sea mainly using beam trawls. Recently, the central North Sea appears less fished by demersal gears. <b>Towed</b> <b>nets</b> including seines and beam trawls equipped with meshes of more than 100 mm resp. more than 80 mm were identified as the main gears effecting the depleted cod and reduced plaice stocks. The saithe sector, using <b>towed</b> <b>nets</b> with meshes of more than 110 mm, longlines, gill nets and others, appears to affect the 7 species to a lesser extend. These results support the interim effort limitations by gear types, vessel and month as enforced by the European Commission since 2003. TAC regulations alone are considered inefficient to sustainably harvest stocks by mixed fisheries. A fleet-effort management method is developed estimating the fleets’ effects based on the sum of partial exploitation rates of the species in mixed fisheries weighted by {{the ratio of the}} precautionary reference Bpa and the actual SSB size as ecological quality objective. Applying such fleet effort management could result in increased catch possibilities of some stocks by fleets selecting mainly few and non-overexploited stocks while respecting precautionary management constraints in minimum SSB or maximum exploitation rates at the same time...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. —Understanding {{sampling}} {{effectiveness is}} critical to gear selection and the determi-nation of larval fish dynamics. We evaluated bow-mounted push nets for collecting larval fish across reservoirs and habitats and compared them with traditional <b>tow</b> <b>nets.</b> By means of a pushed 0. 5 -m-diameter conical <b>net</b> and <b>towed</b> 0. 5 -m-diameter and 0. 75 -m-diameter conical nets, ichthyo-plankton samples were taken during daylight hours from May to July on 21 reservoirs that varied in morphological and environmental characteristics. The push net had higher catches than the same-diameter <b>tow</b> <b>net.</b> However, the push net was not as efficient as the larger-sized <b>tow</b> <b>net</b> in July, when larvae are larger. For pelagic habitats, bow-mounted push <b>nets</b> or large <b>tow</b> <b>nets</b> will sample the larval fish community more efficiently than traditional 0. 5 -m-diameter conical <b>tow</b> <b>nets.</b> We also assessed push nets for sampling nearshore littoral habitats (, 1. 0 m in depth). Across reservoirs the littoral areas had much higher catch rates than did the offshore pelagic zone; estimates of peak larval fish densities were four times as high in the littoral zone. Deriving estimates of larval fish abundance from pelagic habitats only will probably lead to underestimation of total larval fish densities. The versatility of the push net in sampling littoral habitats is an important consideration when designing surveys to estimate larval fish communities. Bow-mounted pus...|$|R

Basing on the materials obtained by the subsidiary trawlers belonging to the Fish-meal fleets operating on the Bering Sea in 1963 and in 1965, the possible relationship between the catches of the eastern net and the towing-force of the trawler which is to be denoted by the resultant of the Gross tonnage and the Horse Power of the main engine was put under investigation, with the following results obtained : 1) The increase of the Horse Power of the main engine of the trawler seemed to have been coincided with the responsive increase of the catch per one unit of the <b>towing</b> <b>net,</b> which was to be observed most remarkably at the good-catching period. 2) Each increase in the total tonnage seemed to have been accompanied by the increase in the catch per one unit of the <b>towing</b> <b>net,</b> though this was not so remarkable as in the above mentioned case. 3) The towing speed might be regarded as one of the chief factors in the formation of this relationship between the catch and the Horse Power of the main engine, but the versatility of the towing speed, easily influenced by the net-size, sea-condition and the catches make necessary the execution of the spot investigations. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Three new {{zooplankton}} nets {{have been}} designed to enable improved collection of zooplankters from ice-covered waters. These nets also enable quanti-tative sampling of species not adequately sampled by other methods. The first net is a vertical tow net which can be folded like an umbrella to pass through a small ice hole (10 cm). This 'Umbrella Net ' takes an integrated sample of zoo-plankton from all sample depths. The second net is a collapsible free-fall net designed to collect mobile zooplankters capable of avoiding <b>towed</b> <b>nets.</b> This was the only net used which was capable of collecting all furcilia stages of Euphausia crystallorophias from Ellis Fjord, Vestfold Hills, Antarctica. The third net is a diver-operated push net designed to collect zooplankters in the top 15 cm of the under-ice water column. Because of the high standing crop of phytoplankton at and near the under-ice surface at particular times of the year, some species of zooplankton tend to congregate there. These species, particularly Paralabidocera antarctica, were collected in great abundance using the push net, but were rare in samples collected by other methods. 1...|$|E
40|$|Cod, haddock, whiting, saithe, plaice, sole and Norway lobster are the 7 main {{target species}} of the mixed {{demersal}} fisheries of the North Sea, Skagerrak and Eastern Channel. Among these, cod and plaice stocks are at low levels (historically), there is risk of poor recruitment and the current levels imply ongoing and significant losses in long-term yields. The 7 main resources are exploited {{by a variety of}} competing fleets deploying often quite unselective gears. The poorly defined fishing strategies result in high discards or unallocated landings far in excess of the single species TACs and thus jeopardizing multi-annual recovery and management plans. In this paper we propose a fleet specific effort management system. The fleet specific effects we estimate are based on the sum of partial exploitation rates of the species caught. They are then weighted by the ratio of the actual SSB size and the precautionary biomass reference (Bpa) which is also the ‘ecological quality objective’. As an axiom, fishing activities are thus considered more beneficial with decreasing numbers of species represented in the catch. The developed relative effort factors were applied in medium term simulations of the annual management decision processes on future catch possibilities, in accordance with the existing or proposed multi-annual management plans (including the cod recovery). Uncertainties in the international catch data compiled and the stock assessments significantly undermine the results and their application for management purposes. <b>Towed</b> <b>nets,</b> including seines equipped with 70 - 99 mm or ≥ 100 mm mesh size, beam trawlers ≥ 80 mm and gill nets are identified as the main gears affecting the depleted cod and plaice stocks. In contrast, trawls of 16 - 31 mm, longlines and other gear types appear to less significantly affect the stocks we considered. The proposed fleet management would require stringent effort reductions for the cod and plaice sensitive fleets over a time period of about 5 years, i. e. <b>towed</b> <b>nets</b> of ≥ 100 mm mesh size, beam trawlers ≥ 80 mm, trawls of 70 - 99 mm and gill nets. This will reduce the exploitation rates of all stocks significantly and, after their recoveries, catches will continuously exceed recent levels by far and management interventions would be minor. The more selective longlines and other fleet types will profit from increased effort and catch allowances over the entire scenario periods. The recovery and management plans on cod are dominating the management decisions resulting in significant under-exploitation of each haddock, saithe and plaice stocks due to poor fishing strategies with high by-catches. Even a low degree of non-compliance with the effort and adapted catch allowances as simulated through parameter bias indicates significant delays in realizing the predefined management goals. JRC.
