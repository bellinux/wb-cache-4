5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, Nolan Bushnell saw Spacewar {{running on a}} {{mainframe}} at the University of Utah {{where he was a}} student. Bushnell worked during the summer at Lagoon Amusement Park in Utah as a manager of the games department overseeing the arcade games, and when he saw Spacewar he believed that an arcade game version of the game would be very popular. The high price of computers capable of running the game, however, meant that any such arcade game would not be economically feasible. After graduating from college Bushnell worked as an engineer in California for Ampex, an electronics company that worked in audio and video recording technology. He also met researcher Jim Stein, who worked for Stanford University's Stanford Artificial Intelligence Project; he learned from him that Spacewar was running on the laboratory's PDP-6, and played the game against him there when visiting. Soon after, he saw an ad for the Data General Nova computer, which cost only US$4,000, and <b>thought</b> <b>again</b> about his Spacewar arcade game idea; he believed that at that price, if he were able to connect four monitors and coin slots to allow multiple games to run simultaneously, the game would be economically viable. He showed his office mate and fellow Ampex engineer Ted Dabney Spacewar at the Stanford laboratory, and the two agreed to work together to try and design a prototype of the game; Bushnell was more experienced with computers and digital engineering, while Dabney was more experienced with analog and hardware engineering, as he had been working on designing video processing and control circuits and power supplies.|$|E

6000|$|Blucher was bewildered--and touched, too--stirred to the depths. He reflected. <b>Thought</b> <b>again.</b> Then an idea struck him, and he said: ...|$|E
60|$|She cast {{about in}} her <b>thoughts</b> <b>again,</b> {{and he kept}} his eye upon her as before.|$|R
5000|$|Receptivity: Adults who {{consider}} arguments {{from the child}} and [...] "hear him or her out" [...] encourage these children to reveal their <b>thoughts</b> <b>again</b> ...|$|R
60|$|Sibyl turned {{with the}} meekness of an ostentatious scape-goat, {{unjustly}} bearing {{the sins of}} her tribe, and went upstairs into the wilderness of her own <b>thoughts</b> <b>again.</b>|$|R
60|$|There was a {{dead silence}} in the little room. Anna sat {{with the face of}} a Sphinx--waiting. Annabel thought, and <b>thought</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Little things, indeed!" [...] I <b>thought</b> <b>again.</b> [...] "The head-hunters are right. These are {{the things}} that women like you to do for them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, utterly--utterly," [...] she repeated. And as {{she said}} so, she <b>thought</b> <b>again,</b> what would the world say of her {{if she were to}} share his flight? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am justly {{estranged from}} your daughter, and I am {{resolved}} never {{to give her}} a place in my <b>thoughts</b> <b>again.</b> I have madly wasted my youth on her. Let her be content with that and the other things I have sacrificed for her sake." ...|$|R
60|$|An Indian brave, {{whose eyes}} were {{directed}} sentimentally to the stars, {{as though he}} were thinking of his lady-love--or buffalo steaks and marrow-bones--cocked his ears and lowered his gaze to earth, but as nothing more was to be seen or heard, he raised his eyes and <b>thoughts</b> <b>again</b> to love--or marrow-bones.|$|R
50|$|At the banquet, Juan is {{preoccupied with}} his <b>thoughts</b> <b>again.</b> When {{he glances at}} Aurora, he catches {{a smile on her}} cheek, but is {{uncertain}} of its meaning, since Aurora sits pale and only a little flushed. Adeline goes about her duties as hostess, while the Duchess of Fitz-Fulke is very much at ease.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Brook <b>thought</b> <b>again.</b> [...] "I'm {{glad she}} is. He's too sweet. By hand!--it {{must have been}} so he sent them to mamma. He wouldn't for the world wire." ...|$|E
60|$|I shut my {{eyes and}} <b>thought.</b> <b>Again</b> the flashes seemed to stand out clear and distinct. But no detail supervened--no face came back to me. I felt it was useless.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked down}} {{for a moment at}} his glistening mouth; and he looked up at her, {{standing}} above him in her stately dress, and <b>thought,</b> <b>again,</b> how beautiful she was.|$|E
6000|$|... "Say it then, Robert," [...] said Septimius, who, having {{got over}} the first {{excitement}} of the interview, {{and the sort of}} exhilaration produced by the healthful glow of Robert's spirit, began secretly to wish that it might close, and to be permitted to return to his solitary <b>thoughts</b> <b>again.</b> [...] "What can I do for you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{tried to}} imagine the {{collective}} effect of the Fadden Ball; {{she had never seen}} a fancy-dress gathering in her life. Mr. Manning came into her <b>thoughts</b> <b>again,</b> an unexpected, tall, dark, self-contained presence at the Fadden. One might suppose him turning up; he knew a lot of clever people, and some of them might belong to the class. What would he come as? ...|$|R
60|$|It {{would not}} be easy to {{describe}} the degree of hope and exultation that now began to show itself among the people. Good-natured jests flew about the decks, and the laugh was easily raised where so lately all had been despondency and gloom. The minutes flew swiftly by, and every man had ceased to think of Spain, bending his <b>thoughts</b> <b>again</b> on the as yet unseen west.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you." [...] But Vanderbank, {{for all his}} happy appreciation, <b>thought</b> <b>again.</b> [...] "We ought at {{any rate}} to remember, oughtn't we? {{that we should have}} Mrs. Brook against us." ...|$|E
60|$|That's where I got {{my first}} shock. He wasn't there. I pleaded with them to think again, and they <b>thought</b> <b>again,</b> {{but it was no}} good. No Augustus Mannering-Phipps on the premises.|$|E
6000|$|Lord Theign <b>thought</b> <b>again.</b> [...] "Well, {{even if your}} conviction's just, {{that still}} doesn't tell me into which of my very empty pockets it will be of the least use for me to fumble." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And you won't {{think those}} ugly <b>thoughts</b> <b>again,</b> will you, Katharine?" [...] at which words the ship which Katharine had been {{considering}} seemed {{to put into}} harbor and have done with its seafaring. Yet she was in great need, if not exactly of sympathy, of some form of advice, or, at least, of the opportunity of setting forth her problems before a third person so as to renew them in her own eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh--none in particular," [...] he answered, {{thoroughly}} {{sick and}} tired, his <b>thoughts</b> <b>again</b> reverting to Alfredston, {{and the train}} {{he did not go}} by; the probable disappointment of Sue that he was not there when she arrived, and the missed pleasure of her company on the long and lonely climb by starlight up the hills to Marygreen. [...] "I ought to have gone back really! My aunt is on her deathbed, I fear." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now what chances up there, I wonder?" [...] <b>thought</b> Otter <b>again.</b> Then his {{attention}} was diverted {{in a somewhat}} unpleasant fashion.|$|R
6000|$|Fleda <b>thought</b> <b>again.</b> [...] "Then, even in {{the event}} of her mother's not having got home till the morning, you would have had your letter at the latest to-day. You see she has had plenty of time." ...|$|E
6000|$|He <b>thought</b> <b>again,</b> {{and a light}} broke {{over his}} face. [...] "By Jove!" [...] he says, [...] "you're right. I did put it down {{for a moment on}} the {{platform}} at Banbury while I bought a 'Tit-Bits.'" ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Stobell relapsed into <b>thought</b> <b>again,</b> but no {{gleam of}} {{expression}} disturbed {{the lines of}} his heavy face; Mr. Tredgold, whose sharp, alert features bred more confidence in his own clients than those of other people, waited impatiently.|$|E
60|$|She {{waved her}} hand to show that this matter was finished; then after long <b>thought</b> spoke <b>again,</b> {{addressing}} herself to the Khania.|$|R
60|$|The morning wore away {{in forming}} {{of these and}} similar surmises. As fast as I wove one system of belief, some {{movement}} of the unknown would completely overturn it, and throw all my <b>thoughts</b> <b>again</b> into confusion. Such are the solitary operations of a feverish mind. I was, as I have said, extremely nervous; and the continual meditation on the concerns of this invisible personage began to have its effect:--I was getting a fit of the fidgets.|$|R
6000|$|The {{captain of}} the band seemed to read their <b>thoughts,</b> for <b>again</b> he whispered into the ear of his companion, who called out: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'That is delightful. Whenever I {{find you}} have done a foolish thing I am glad, {{because it seems to}} bring you a little nearer to me, who have done many.' And Elfride <b>thought</b> <b>again</b> of her enemy asleep under the deck they trod.|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{need not}} tell me that,' Leonard replied, with a shudder; 'but I have no proof. I have <b>thought</b> <b>again</b> and again and again, but can find no {{possible}} witness. He was always cautious, and drink made him savage, but not noisy.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Father," [...] said Herbert, [...] "do not {{be unhappy}} about me, I can bear it." [...] And then he <b>thought</b> <b>again</b> of his bride--his bride {{as she was}} to have been; but {{nevertheless}} he repeated his last words, [...] "I can bear it, father!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Owen knows better;' but Lucilla stopped, {{surprised}} to see that his <b>thoughts</b> were <b>again</b> astray. Giving a constrained smile, he asked, 'Well, what next?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Might I suggest," [...] said I, {{after an}} instant's consideration, [...] "that {{the best way}} to give me a fair chance of {{studying}} Mademoiselle Clairfait's face at the next sitting, would be to lead her <b>thoughts</b> <b>again</b> to that quieting subject of the miniature, and to the events which the portrait recalls? It is really the only plan, after what I have observed this morning, that I can think of for enabling me to do myself and my sitter justice." ...|$|R
60|$|I <b>thought</b> that <b>again</b> I might with my {{skill as}} a runner elude my enemies at this game, and so {{with all my}} speed darted forward.|$|R
