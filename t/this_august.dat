5|$|At {{the end of}} World War I, Vanity Fair {{writers and}} Algonquin regulars Dorothy Parker, Robert Benchley, and Robert E. Sherwood started meeting for lunch at The Algonquin. Alexander Woollcott, acerbic critic and war correspondent, {{received}} a warm welcome from literary friends in 1919. They gathered in the Rose Room that afternoon; one person enjoyed the event enough to request that it become a daily event. That same request prompted a daily exchange of ideas and opinions shared between highly esteemed literary figures. George S. Kaufman, Heywood Broun, and Edna Ferber were {{also a part of}} <b>this</b> <b>August</b> assembly; these individuals influenced writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway. They founded The New Yorker magazine; all hotel guests receive free copies to this day.|$|E
5|$|The article {{explains}} {{the sequence of}} events of <b>this</b> <b>August</b> 4 New York City demonstration flight of 1895. When the reporter was all positioned and ready in the sky-cycle he gave word to the ground crew {{to let go of the}} ropes that held the hydrogen balloon back and it immediately lifted the sky-cycle into the air. The airship drifted up slowly at first, going towards the factory roof peaks. The driver-reporter immediately dropped one of the sandbag weights and the sky-cycle airship rose up sharply, avoiding the building roofs. When the airship was about a thousand feet high the attached balloon propeller revolved and the sky-cycle airship flew over the East River. The steamships and tugs that spotted the sky-cycle floating above tooted their whistles.|$|E
2500|$|After a brief {{diplomatic}} {{career at}} Madrid and Rome, the revolution of 1848 caused Albert de Broglie {{to withdraw from}} public life and devote himself to literature. He had already published a translation of the religious system of Leibniz (1846). He now at once made his mark by his contributions to the Revue des deux mondes and the Orleanist and clerical organ [...] These, and other contributions, brought him the succession to Lacordaire's seat in the Académie française in 1862, joining his father in <b>this</b> <b>august</b> society.|$|E

"After all, I suppose," [...] he observed, as {{he passed}} down the hall, [...] "there is {{something}} great about wealth or else one wouldn't believe that old Anselman there was thinking of his money-bags.

We never had a better month {{in the history of}} this organization than last month, and yet our profits are not commensurate with the volume of business that we did. That's the reason I sent for these cost statements and have compared them, and I find that our costs have increased out of all proportions to what is warranted. How do you account for it?" ...|$|R

60|$|Her Majesty, or MRS.

6000|$|<b>This</b> <b>August</b> company {{arrived at}} the great west door of the cathedral; and as the Archbishop entered a noble anthem rose and filled the vast building. The cathedral was packed with people--people in thousands. Only a wide space down the center had been kept free. Down this space walked the Archbishop and his canons, and after them {{followed}} those five stately figures in splendid harness, each bearing his feudal banner--and riding! ...|$|E

She met him at Monte Carlo this year, {{and they had a}} sort of flirtation. In the postscript he says: 'If you take my advice, don't go to Dinard <b>this</b> <b>August.</b> Don't be further away from home than you can help at all this summer.'

60|$|Gaston assented. He {{was glad}} to be rid of the mealy-mouthed creature, of whose {{necessary}} help in this matter he was heartily ashamed. Unlike Lydie, he was quite unconscious of the beauty of <b>this</b> <b>August</b> day: neither the birds nor the acrid scent of late summer flowers appealed to his fancy, and the clump of young beech trees only interested him in so far as he hoped to find Lydie there, alone.|$|E
6000|$|<b>This</b> <b>August</b> Sunday she {{had been}} tempted by the {{announcement}} that the Reverend Edmund Zitterel would preach on the topic [...] "America, Face Your Problems!" [...] With the great war, workmen in every nation showing a desire to control industries, Russia hinting a leftward revolution against Kerensky, woman suffrage coming, {{there seemed to be}} plenty of problems for the Reverend Mr. Zitterel to call on America to face. Carol gathered her family and trotted off behind Uncle Whittier.|$|E
60|$|It was on Wednesday, the 14th of October (continues {{the precise}} Antonio Agapida), {{that the good}} count de Cabra, {{according}} to arrangement, appeared at the gate of Cordova.

[...] Such is a faithful description of <b>this</b> <b>august</b> and venerable relic, and I question whether the learned Scriblerius contemplated his Roman shield, or the Knights of the Round Table the long-sought San-greal, with more exultation.|$|E
6000|$|I was a cipher in <b>this</b> <b>august</b> company, {{and felt}} subdued, {{not to say}} torpid. I was not even of {{sufficient}} consequence to assist at the wheel when {{it was necessary to}} put the tiller hard down in a hurry; the guest that stood nearest did that when occasion required--and this was pretty much all the time, because of the crookedness of the channel and the scant water. I stood in a corner; and the talk I listened to took the hope all out of me. One visitor said to another-- ...|$|E

Some {{symptoms}} were not so bad, it did not assume so acute a form. I thought {{he ought to be}} carried through it. He was older, about twenty-one, six feet high, a strong handsome young man, the pride of Norfolk Island, the destined helper and successor (had God so willed) of his father, the present Clergyman. The same faith, the same patience, the same endurance of suffering.|$|E

6000|$|After {{expressing his}} {{obligations}} to the army in general, and acknowledging the peculiar services and distinguished merits of the confidential officers who had been attached to his person, and composed his family during the war, and whom he especially recommended to the favor of Congress, he continued--"Having now finished the work assigned me, I retire from the great theatre of action; and, bidding an affectionate farewell to <b>this</b> <b>august</b> body, under whose orders I have long acted, I here offer my commission, and take my leave of all the employments of public life." ...|$|E
60|$|But {{leaving this}} hint {{to operate as}} it may with the phrenologists, I would merely assume the spinal theory for a moment, in {{reference}} to the Sperm Whale's hump. <b>This</b> <b>august</b> hump, if I mistake not, rises over one of the larger vertebrae, and is, therefore, in some sort, the outer convex mould of it. From its relative situation then, I should call this high hump the organ of firmness or indomitableness in the Sperm Whale. And that the great monster is indomitable, you will yet have reason to know.|$|E

"Out of {{the mouths}} of babes and sucklings hast Thou ordained strength," [...] she murmured, praising God who had put this gladness in her heart, the Christian's and the mother's love filling her eyes with tears.

Poor woman! ...|$|E
