5|$|The {{series has}} been {{described}} as a hybrid of fantasy and procedural dramas and serials, influenced by film and television shows such as Lost, The X-Files, Altered States, and The <b>Twilight</b> <b>Zone.</b> The series began as a traditional mystery-of-the-week series and became more serialized in later seasons.

5|$|One of the first-produced {{episodes of}} the season, {{it is known}} for {{showcasing}} early designs and different characterizations for {{several members of the}} show's cast. The episode is inspired by the comedy of Laurel and Hardy and features cultural references to films such as Citizen Kane and Freaks as well as the Batman and <b>Twilight</b> <b>Zone</b> television series. In November 1996, The BBC chose it as the first episode to be aired, when they started showing the series, later being beat in the ratings by Sabrina.|$|E
5|$|The episode, first {{aired on}} Channel 4 on 18 February 2013, was watched by 1.2 million viewers {{and was very}} well {{received}} by critics, particularly for its writing and Middleton's performance. The story draws parallels with real murder cases, primarily the 1960s Moors murders, where five children were killed. Its horror aspects are reminiscent of the 1970s film The Wicker Man and the video game Manhunt, while some similarities with The <b>Twilight</b> <b>Zone</b> have also been noted. This dystopian episode reflects upon several aspects of contemporary society, such as media coverage of murders, technology's effects on people's empathy, desensitization, violence as entertainment, vigilantism, the concept of justice and punishment, {{and the nature of}} reality.|$|E
5|$|Carter's initial {{pitch for}} The X-Files was {{rejected}} by Fox executives. He fleshed out the concept and returned a few weeks later, leading to the commission of the pilot. Carter worked with NYPD Blue producer Daniel Sackheim in further developing the pilot, drawing stylistic inspiration from the 1988 documentary The Thin Blue Line, and the English television series Prime Suspect. Inspiration was also taken from Carter's memories of watching Kolchak: The Night Stalker and The <b>Twilight</b> <b>Zone</b> in his youth; {{as well as from}} the then-recently released film The Silence of the Lambs, which was the impetus for framing the series around agents from the FBI, in order to provide the characters with a more plausible reason for being involved in each case than Carter believed was present in Kolchak. Carter was also keen on keeping the relationship between the two lead roles strictly platonic, basing their interactions on the characters of Emma Peel (Diana Rigg) and John Steed (Patrick Macnee) in the series The Avengers.|$|E
40|$|Two quasi-experiments {{investigated}} {{the contribution of}} reduced visibility to fatal accidents recorded by the U. S. Fatal Accident Reporting Systems from 1980 through 1990. Quasi-Experiment 1 evaluated 104, 235 accidents that occurred during morning and evening time periods, called <b>Twilight</b> <b>Zones,</b> during which natural illumination varied systematically {{in conjunction with the}} annual solar cycle. Fatal accidents were found to be overrepresented during darker portions of the <b>Twilight</b> <b>Zones.</b> This finding was not related to time of day, day of week, or drivers’ consumption of alcohol. The contribution of reduced visibility was also indicated by higher overrepresentation of fatal accidents in low illumination under adverse atmospheric conditions and with pedestrians and pedalcyclists as opposed to all other accidents. Reduced visibility was more important than drivers’ drinking as a contributor to fatal pedestrian and pedalcycle accidents, while the reverse pattern was found for all other fatal traffic accidents. Quasi-Experiment 2 assessed the role of seasonal variables other than natural illumination by comparing the monthly distributions of 337, 726 accidents recorded during three time periods: the <b>Twilight</b> <b>Zones</b> plus equal-duration control periods of Daylight and Darkness. The distribution of fatal nonpedestrian accidents exhibited no substantial variation across months in any of the test periods. The incidence of fatal pedestrian/pedalcycle accidents covaried with natural illumination during the <b>Twilight</b> <b>Zones,</b> while showing no variation during Daylight and Nighttime Control periods, confirming that visibility is a key factor in pedestrian and pedal cycle accidents. 	The present findings provide new evidence for both (1) the importance of visibility as a major contributing factor in fatal pedestrian and pedal cycle accidents, and (2) the relative success of previous efforts to deal with the difficulties of nighttime driving in other classes of fatal accidents...|$|R

5|$|Pierce largely {{fell from}} the movie industry's public eye shortly {{after the release of}} Boggy Creek II. In 1987, he {{directed}} Hawken's Breed, a Western film starring Peter Fonda as a drifter who meets and rescues a young Shawnee woman. While shooting that film, Pierce met the woman who became his second wife, Beth Pulley. In 1996, he directed Renfroe's White Christmas, an adaptation of the classic children's book Renfroe's Christmas. Starting in 1997, he began production on his western film Chasing the Wind (1998), a gritty epic about a mountain man. It proved to be Pierce's final directorial effort, although he continued working as a set decorator for several television shows including MacGyver, Remington Steele, The <b>Twilight</b> <b>Zone</b> and Fresno, a Carol Burnett miniseries parodying prime time soap operas. Pierce's work on the latter show earned him a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Art Direction for a Miniseries or a Special.|$|E
5|$|George R. R. Martin {{was already}} a {{successful}} fantasy and sci-fi author and TV writer before writing his A Song of Ice and Fire book series. Martin had published his first short story in 1971 and his first novel in 1977. By the mid-1990s, he had won three Hugo Awards, two Nebula Awards, and other awards for his short fiction. Although his early books were well received within the fantasy fiction community, his readership remained relatively small and Martin took on jobs as a writer in Hollywood in the mid-1980s. He worked principally on the revival of The <b>Twilight</b> <b>Zone</b> throughout 1986 and on Beauty and the Beast until 1990, but he also developed his own TV pilots and wrote feature film scripts. He grew frustrated that his pilots and screenplays were not getting made and that TV-related production limitations like budgets and episode lengths were forcing him to cut characters and trim battle scenes. This pushed Martin back towards writing books, where {{he did not have}} to worry about compromising the size of his imagination. Admiring the works of J. R. R. Tolkien in his childhood, he wanted to write an epic fantasy, though he did not have any specific ideas.|$|E
