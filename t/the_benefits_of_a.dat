Gary Baise, the Republican challenger to Gerry Connolly's Fairfax County Board of Supervisors Chairmanship, represented Tysons Tunnel. By 2010, Tysons Tunnel, Inc. ceased operations.|$|E

25|$|Within Asia, the {{cultural}} and economic centrality of China was recognized and most countries submitted to the Sinocentric model, if only to enjoy <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> trading relationship.

25|$|Anisimov et al.. (2007:655) {{assessed}} the literature for the polar region (Arctic and Antarctica).

One of these benefits was judged to be increased agricultural and forestry opportunities.|$|E

25|$|The period {{began with}} the {{election}} of Dan MacLennan as AUPE president. Under MacLennan’s leadership, AUPE began to turn the corner on bargaining and reaped <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> reputation for standing up for its members. MacLennan emphasized media savvy, and AUPE became effective as a force for social and legislative change in Alberta.|$|E
25|$|Some economists {{argue that}} a single world {{currency}} is unnecessary, because the U.S. dollar is providing many of <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> world currency while avoiding some of the costs.

25|$|Surgical {{excision}} of hypertrophic or keloid scars is often associated to other methods, such as pressotherapy or silicone gel sheeting. Lone {{excision of}} keloid scars, however, shows a recurrence rate close to 45%.

25|$|The Scottish {{military}} surgeon, John Rollo, published Notes of a Diabetic Case in 1797. It described <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> meat {{diet for}} those suffering from diabetes, basing this recommendation on Matthew Dobson's discovery of glycosuria in diabetes mellitus. By means of Dobson's testing procedure (for glucose in the urine) Rollo {{worked out a}} diet that had success for {{what is now called}} type 2 diabetes.|$|E
25|$|Situation {{awareness}} {{appears in}} the technical literature as early as 1983, when describing <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> prototype touch-screen navigation display. During the early 1980s, integrated “vertical-situation” and “horizontal-situation” displays were being developed for commercial aircraft to replace multiple electro-mechanical instruments. Integrated situation displays combined the information from several instruments enabling more efficient access to critical flight parameters, thereby improving situational awareness and reducing pilot workload.|$|E
25|$|Governesses are rarer now, except within {{large and}} wealthy {{households}} or royal families {{such as the}} Saudi royal family and in remote regions such as outback Australia. There has been a recent resurgence amongst families worldwide to employ governesses or full-time tutors.

2500|$|A {{purpose trust}} is a trust {{created for the}} {{fulfilment}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> purpose, not for <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> person. While charitable trusts are also for <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> abstract purpose, charitable purposes for <b>the</b> public <b>benefit</b> are {{an exception to the}} standard rule regarding purpose trusts, which is that they are void. The invalidity of purpose trusts is commonly said to have been set in Morice v Bishop of Durham. In Leahy v Attorney-General for New South Wales, Lord Simonds set the principle that: ...|$|R

25|$|Nonetheless, {{his very}} sinuous {{relationship}} with the new Prince {{was the source of}} several crisis situations. Notably, Brătianu would point to <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Republican project (which Rosetti and his left wing of the Liberal Party had never ceased advocating). Thus, when the experimental Republic of Ploiești was created in 1870 around a Liberal group, Ion Brătianu was arrested as the inspirational figure, but was soon released.|$|E

25|$|Also {{known as}} Generation 3 Omni VII and Generation 3+, {{following}} the issues experienced with generation IV technology, Thin Film technology became {{the standard for}} current image intensifier technology. In Thin Film image intensifiers, {{the thickness of the}} film is reduced from around 30 Angstrom (standard) to around 10 Angstrom and the photocathode voltage is lowered. This causes fewer electrons to be stopped than with third generation tubes, while providing <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> filmed tube.|$|E
25|$|As traffic by {{cars and}} truck {{increased}} rapidly, <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bridge {{in this area}} became evident, and its construction was authorized by the highway departments of Delaware and New Jersey in 1945. Originally, a two-lane highway tunnel was considered, but the costs for a four-lane bridge {{were found to be}} equivalent, hence the bridge was the choice. Congress approved the bridge project on July 13, 1946, and its construction began on February 1, 1949.|$|E
25|$|Some {{empirical}} studies {{have tried to}} ascertain <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> minimum wage beyond employment effects. In an analysis of census data, Joseph Sabia and Robert Nielson found no statistically significant evidence that minimum wage increases helped reduce financial, housing, health, or food insecurity. This study was undertaken by the Employment Policies Institute, a think tank funded by the food, beverage and hospitality industries. In 2012, Michael Reich published an economic analysis that suggested that a proposed minimum wage hike in San Diego might stimulate the city's economy by about $190 million.|$|E
