40|$|Single-unit, event-related {{potential}} (ERP), and neuroimaging {{studies have}} implicated the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in top-down control {{of attention and}} working memory. We conducted an experiment in patients with unilateral PFC damage (n � 8) to assess the temporal kinetics of PFC–extrastriate interactions during visual attention. Subjects alternated attention between {{the left and the}} right hemifields in successive runs while they detected target stimuli embedded in streams of repetitive task-irrelevant stimuli (standards). The design enabled us to examine tonic (spatial selection) and phasic (feature selection) PFC–extrastriate interactions. PFC damage impaired performance in the visual field contralateral to lesions, as manifested by both larger reaction times and error rates. Assessment of the extrastriate P 1 ERP revealed that the PFC exerts a tonic (spatial selection) excitatory input to the ipsilateral extrastriate cortex as early as 100 msec post stimulus delivery. The PFC exerts a second phasic (feature selection) excitatory extrastriate modulation from 180 to 300 msec, as evidenced by reductions in selection negativity after damage. Finally, reductions of the N 2 ERP to target stimuli supports the notion that the PFC exerts a third phasic (target selection) signal necessary for successful template matching during postselection analysis of target features. The results provide electrophysiological evidence of three distinct tonic and phasic PFC inputs to the extrastriate cortex in the initial few hundred milliseconds of stimulus processing. Damage to this network appears to underlie <b>the</b> <b>pervasive</b> deficits in <b>attention</b> observed in patients with prefrontal lesions.

40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} {{pervasive}} applications {{is to be}} invisible and to require a minimal amount of user attention. But invisibility raises lots of hard challenges, blocking <b>the</b> long-awaited <b>pervasive</b> era to emerge. The device heterogeneity and volatility, security enforcement and context-awareness {{are just some of}} the issues a developer must tackle inside the application code. To industrialize such development, we propose to use an application server dedicated to <b>the</b> <b>pervasive</b> environment. Thanks to this server, developers focus on the application, delegating to the server most of <b>the</b> <b>pervasive</b> constraint management. However, providing such a platform is a very difficult task. <b>The</b> <b>pervasive</b> environment constraints must be handled by this server in a consistent way, while being flexible enough to support the different applications.

40|$|With {{networks}} becoming <b>pervasive,</b> research <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> {{dynamics of}} epidemic models in networked populations has increased. While {{a number of}} well understood epidemic spreading models have been developed, little to no {{attention has been paid}} to epidemic control strategies; beyond heuristics usually based on network centrality measures. Since epidemic control resources are typically limited, the problem of optimally allocating resources to control an outbreak becomes of interest. Existing literature considered homogeneous networks, limited the discussion to undirected networks, and largely proposed network centrality-based resource allocation strategies. ^ In this thesis, we consider the well-known Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible spreading model and study the problem of minimum cost resource allocation to control an epidemic outbreak in a networked population. First, we briefly present a heuristic that outperforms network centrality-based algorithms on a stylized version of the problem previously studied in the literature. We then solve the epidemic control problem via a convex optimization framework on weighted, directed networks comprising heterogeneous nodes. Based on our spreading model, we express the problem of controlling an epidemic outbreak in terms of spectral conditions involving the Perron-Frobenius eigenvalue. This enables formulation of the epidemic control problem as a Geometric Program (GP), for which we derive a convex characterization guaranteeing existence of an optimal solution. We consider two formulations of the epidemic control problem—the first seeks an optimal vaccine and antidote allocation strategy given a constraint on the rate at which the epidemic comes under control. The second formulation seeks to find an optimal allocation strategy given a budget on the resources. The solution framework for both formulations also allows for control of an epidemic outbreak on networks that are not necessarily strongly connected. The thesis further proposes a fully distributed solution to the epidemic control problem via a Distributed Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm. Our distributed solution enables each node to locally compute its optimum allocation of vaccines and antidotes needed to collectively globally contain the spread of an outbreak, via local exchange of information with its neighbors. Contrasting previous literature, our problem is a constrained optimization problem associated with a directed network comprising non-identical agents. For the different problem formulations considered, illustrations that validate our solutions are presented. This thesis, in sum, proposes a paradigm shift from heuristics towards a convex framework for contagion control in networked populations. ...|$|R

[13] classified the faults {{that occur in}} <b>the</b> <b>pervasive</b> system as service failures, device failures, network failures and application failures. These faults greatly interrupt the service execution and {{will lead to a}} situation where service providers are constrained to complete their service requests. During such cases, the Service Selection framework have to invoke once again the service selection methodology to identify the next best service provider and the new service execution has to be re-started. In most cases, multiple services are offered by the service provider. Therefore, during such faults, one or more services will be affected thereby giving rise to higher service delay and service recovery overhead. Though attempts are made to provide best services to the user, executing the service without service disruptions, with minimal service delay and service recovery overhead is an important challenge in <b>the</b> <b>pervasive</b> environment.|$|R
