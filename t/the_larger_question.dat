500|$|In 1924 and 1925, McNair and Summerall defended McNair's {{work when}} it was criticized during the {{continuing}} debate {{about the future of}} the Army Air Service. [...] The head of the Air Service, Major General Mason Patrick, argued that the McNair board's findings underestimated the capabilities of bomber aircraft, and that the data the board had compiled was inaccurate. [...] In response, Major General Frank W. Coe, the chief of the Coast Artillery Corps, pointed out that McNair's panel included both Coast Artillery and Air Service officers, and that experiments with aircraft had included coast artillery officers as observers. [...] In addition, the aircrews that participated in the McNair board experiments had the opportunity to provide input and voice concern over the board's methods and conclusions. [...] Coe concluded his argument by recommending that the McNair board's findings be approved by the Army as its official position on the issue of coastal artillery versus bombers for shore defense. [...] Coe's recommendation was not followed; subsequent panels and committees continued to investigate and debate the issue. [...] In addition, the debate continued on <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>question</b> of whether the Air Service should remain a component of the Army or become a separate branch of the military.|$|E

40|$|In two {{separate}} papers, Artificial Intelligence (AI) /Robotics researcher Guy Hoffman takes {{as a starting}} point that actors have been in the business of reverse engineering human behaviour for centuries. In this paper, I follow the similar trajectories of AI and acting theory (AT), looking at three primary questions, in the hope of framing a response to Hoffman's papers: (1) How are the problems of training a human to simulate a fictional human both similar to and different from training a machine to simulate a human? (2) How are <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>questions</b> of AI design and architecture similar to <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>questions</b> that still remain within the area of AT? (3) Is there anything in the work of AI design that might advance the work of acting theorists and practitioners? The paper explores the use of “swarm intelligence” in recent models of both AT and AI, and considers the issues of embodied cognition, and the kinds of intelligence that enhances or inhibits imaginative immersion for the actor, and concludes with a consideration of the ontological questions raised by the trend towards intersubjective, dynamic systems of generative thought in both AT and AI...|$|R
