A final contribution demonstrates that one agent objective function is optimal for some models...|$|R
5|$|Some of {{the causes}} of {{deliberate}} self-poisoning in Sri Lankan adolescents included bereavement and harsh discipline by parents.

Great potential for the reduction of self-harm lies in education and prevention, but limited resources in the developing world make these methods challenging.|$|E

5|$|People {{receiving}} dimercaprol need to {{be assessed}} for peanut allergies since the commercial formulation contains peanut oil. Calcium EDTA is also effective if administered four hours after the administration of dimercaprol. Administering dimercaprol, DMSA (Succimer), or DMPS prior to calcium EDTA is necessary to prevent the redistribution of lead into the central nervous system. Dimercaprol used alone may also redistribute lead to the brain and testes. An adverse side effect of calcium EDTA is renal toxicity. Succimer (DMSA) is the preferred agent in mild to moderate lead poisoning cases. This {{may be the case}} in instances where children have a blood lead level >25μg/dL. The most reported adverse side effect for succimer is gastrointestinal disturbances. It is also important to note that chelation therapy only lowers blood lead levels and may not prevent the lead-induced cognitive problems associated with lower lead levels in tissue. This may be because of the inability of <b>these</b> <b>agents</b> to remove sufficient amounts of lead from tissue or inability to reverse preexisting damage.|$|E

On the first of the month several RAAF PBY Catalina aircraft carrying SRD personnel overflew Labuan. These aircraft later landed near two native prahu and questioned their crews; two sailors were flown back to an Allied base for further questioning. On 15 May two Malays working for the SRD were landed in Brunei Bay by a Catalina, and sailed to Labuan on board a prahu. <b>These</b> <b>agents</b> recruited a local civilian from Labuan, and the party was extracted by a Catalina near the mainland village of Kampong Mengalong on 19 May. The intelligence gained from these operations provided the Australians with a good understanding of Labuan's geography and infrastructure.

5|$|This {{reaction}} is exothermic and releases enough heat to ignite the resulting hydrogen {{in the presence}} of oxygen, possibly explosively splashing onlookers with potassium hydroxide, which is a strong alkali that destroys living tissue and causes skin burns. Finely grated potassium ignites in air at room temperature. The bulk metal ignites in air if heated. Because its density is 0.89 g/cm3, burning potassium floats in water that exposes it to atmospheric oxygen. Many common fire extinguishing agents, including water, either are ineffective or make a potassium fire worse. Nitrogen, argon, sodium chloride (table salt), sodium carbonate (soda ash), and silicon dioxide (sand) are effective if they are dry. Some Class D dry powder extinguishers designed for metal fires are also effective. <b>These</b> <b>agents</b> deprive the fire of oxygen and cool the potassium metal.|$|E
5|$|Fomepizole is {{a potent}} {{inhibitor}} of alcohol dehydrogenase; similar to ethanol, it acts to block {{the formation of the}} toxic metabolites. Fomepizole {{has been shown to be}} highly effective as an antidote for ethylene glycol poisoning. It is the only antidote approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of ethylene glycol poisoning. Both antidotes have advantages and disadvantages. Ethanol is readily available in most hospitals, is inexpensive, and can be administered orally as well as intravenously. Its adverse effects include intoxication, hypoglycemia in children, and possible liver toxicity. Patients receiving ethanol therapy also require frequent blood ethanol concentration measurements and dosage adjustments to maintain a therapeutic ethanol concentration. Patients therefore must be monitored in an intensive care unit. Alternatively, the adverse side effects of fomepizole are minimal and the approved dosing regimen maintains therapeutic concentrations without the need to monitor blood concentrations of the drug. The disadvantage of fomepizole is that it is expensive. Costing US$1,000 per gram, an average course used in an adult poisoning would cost approximately $3,500 to $4,000. Despite the cost, fomepizole is gradually replacing ethanol as the antidote of choice in ethylene glycol poisoning. Adjunct agents including thiamine and pyridoxine are often given, because they may help prevent the formation of oxalic acid. The use of <b>these</b> <b>agents</b> is based on theoretical observations and there is limited evidence to support their use in treatment; they may be of particular benefit in people who could be deficient in these vitamins such as malnourished or alcoholic patients.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Agent {{architectures}} have to {{cope with}} a number of internal properties (concerns), such as autonomy, learning, and mobility. As the <b>agent</b> complexity increases, <b>these</b> <b>agent</b> properties crosscut each other and the agent’s basic functionality. In addition, multi-agent systems encompass multiple agent types with heterogeneous architectures. Each of <b>these</b> <b>agent</b> types has different properties, which need to be composed in different ways. In this context, the separation and the flexible composition of agent concerns are crucial for the construction of heterogeneous agent architectures. Moreover the separation of agent concerns needs to be guaranteed throughout the different development phases, especially from the architectural to the implementation phase. Existing approaches do not provide appropriate support for the modularization of agent properties at the architectural stage, and do not promote a smooth transition to the system implementation. This paper presents an aspect-oriented method that allows for a better separation of concerns, supporting the systematic aspectization of agent properties through the architectural definition, detailed design and implementation. A multi-agent system for paper reviewing management is assumed as a case study through this paper to show the applicability of our proposal. ...|$|R
