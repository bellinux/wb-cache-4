5|$|Cadet nurses {{came from}} across the nation and from all backgrounds. Some joined {{because they wanted to}} become nurses, others for the free education, and others joined because <b>their</b> <b>country</b> needed them. Attrition rates for cadets were {{comparable}} to those reported for other nursing schools in the same period. The corps was the largest of the federal nurse-training programs, and allowed young women to serve <b>their</b> <b>country</b> in uniform and without discrimination.

5|$|I was {{of course}} happy to meet the Hizbullah people, {{because it is a}} point of view that is rarely heard in the United States. I have no problem saying that I do want to express {{solidarity}} with them, and I am {{not going to be a}} coward of (sic) a hypocrite about it. I don't care about Hizbullah as a political organization. I don't know much about their politics, and anyhow, it's irrelevant. I don't live in Lebanon. It's a choice that the Lebanese have to make: Who they want to be their leaders, who they want to represent them. But there is a fundamental principle. People have the right to defend <b>their</b> <b>country</b> from foreign occupiers, and people have the right to defend <b>their</b> <b>country</b> from invaders who are destroying <b>their</b> <b>country.</b> That to me is a very basic, elementary and uncomplicated question.|$|E

5|$|As a rationalist and ardent social reformer, Periyar {{advocated}} forcefully {{throughout his}} life that women should be given their legitimate position in society as the equals of men {{and that they should}} be given good education and have the right to property.

5|$|Despite German {{interest}} in the battlecruiser project, the two sides could not agree on terms. The German delegation insisted that orders placed in <b>their</b> <b>country</b> be guaranteed, with financial compensation {{to be paid to}} German companies if the Dutch did not construct the ships. They also refused to release a complete set of plans for the Scharnhorsts. Further complicating negotiations, the Dutch Cabinet, which would have to approve any deal, did not convene during the summer of 1939.|$|E

5|$|East Stirlingshire {{players have}} been capped for <b>their</b> <b>country</b> at full {{international}} level 9 times by four different players. The first person to do so was Humphrey Jones, who captained the Wales national team four times out of the five caps he earned whilst at East Stirlingshire. His first came in a British Home Championship match against England in 1889. The three other players to make an appearance for <b>their</b> <b>country</b> are Archibald Ritchie, David Alexander and James McKie, all for the Scotland national team at the British Championship. Each of them made their début against Wales, although in different seasons. Archibald Ritchie's one and only Scotland cap came in March 1891 against Wales, who were captained by former East Stirlingshire player Humphrey Jones. David Alexander made two appearances, one against Ireland and scoring against Wales at the 1894 British Home Championship which Scotland won. James McKie scored twice during his only appearance for Scotland, in a 5–2 victory over Wales in 1898. He is the last East Stirlingshire player to be capped by his country.|$|E

All the documents must be translated into Czech language by a sworn translator.|$|E
5|$|Gould {{continued}} to captain the Wales team through victory over Scotland, with tries coming from Bert Gould, Biggs and William McCutcheon; all {{the result of}} precision handling from the backs. This left the final encounter with Ireland, played at Stradey Park in Llanelli, as the deciding match for a Welsh Triple Crown. Despite an unconvincing Welsh display, an enthusiastic crowd of 20,000 watched <b>their</b> <b>country</b> win the game {{and with it the}} title, decided by a single try from Bert Gould.|$|E
5|$|Hispanic men {{and women}} have reached the top ranks of the Coast Guard, serving <b>their</b> <b>country</b> in {{sensitive}} leadership positions on domestic and foreign shores. In 1991, LTJG Katherine Tiongson became the first Hispanic-American female to command an afloat unit. In 2006, Ronald J. Rábago was the first Hispanic-American promoted to Rear Admiral (lower half). In 2009, Rear Admiral Joseph R. Castillo became the first Hispanic-American district commander in the U.S. Coast Guard. Hispanics currently account for 11% of the enlisted personnel, and 9% of the United States Coast Guard Academy's student body.|$|E
