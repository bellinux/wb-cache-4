5|$|The <b>turkey</b> <b>vulture</b> (Cathartes aura), {{also known}} in some North American regions as the turkey buzzard (or just buzzard), {{and in some}} areas of the Caribbean as the John crow or carrion crow, is the most {{widespread}} of the New World vultures. One of three species in the genus Cathartes of the family Cathartidae, the <b>turkey</b> <b>vulture</b> ranges from southern Canada to the southernmost tip of South America. It inhabits a variety of open and semi-open areas, including subtropical forests, shrublands, pastures, and deserts.|$|E
5|$|This {{bird with}} its somehow crow-like aspect gave {{foot to the}} naming of the Quebrada de los Cuervos (Crows Ravine) in Uruguay, where they dwell {{together}} with the black vulture and the <b>turkey</b> <b>vulture.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{prevalence}} of gram-negative bacterial {{species in the}} intestines of 20 apparently healthy <b>turkey</b> <b>vultures</b> (Cathartes aura) was determined. Edwardsiella tarda, Plesiomonas shigelloides, Salmonella, and Arizona hinshawii (Salmonella arizonae) were each recovered from 15 % of these birds. <b>Turkey</b> <b>vultures</b> may be important reservoirs of these bacterial pathogens...|$|R

To assess vulture flight behavior and activity patterns at the Marine Corps Air Station in Beaufort, South Carolina, we equipped 11 black vultures (Coragyps atratus) and 11 <b>turkey</b> <b>vultures</b> (Cathartes aura) with solarpowered Global Positioning System (GPS) satellite transmitters during a 2 -year study (1 Oct 2006 – 30 Sep 2008). <b>Turkey</b> <b>vultures</b> had larger seasonal home ranges than did black <b>vultures,</b> and 2 <b>turkey</b> <b>vultures</b> made round-trips to Florida.

5|$|Another {{interesting}} {{example that}} does not involve any luring is the zone-tailed hawk, which resembles the <b>turkey</b> <b>vulture.</b> It flies amongst the vultures, suddenly breaking from the formation and ambushing its prey. Here the hawk's presence is of no evident significance to the vultures, affecting them neither negatively or positively.|$|E
5|$|Like the <b>turkey</b> <b>vulture,</b> this vulture {{is often}} seen {{standing}} in a spread-winged stance. The stance is believed to serve multiple functions: drying the wings, warming the body, and baking off bacteria. This same behavior is displayed by other New World vultures, Old World vultures, and storks.|$|E
5|$|In natural settings, {{the black}} vulture eats mainly carrion. In areas {{populated}} by humans, it may scavenge at garbage dumps, but also takes eggs and decomposing plant material and can kill or injure newborn or incapacitated mammals. Like other vultures, it {{plays an important}} role in the ecosystem by disposing of carrion which would otherwise be a breeding ground for disease. The black vulture locates food either by sight or by following New World vultures of the genus Cathartes to carcasses. These vultures—the <b>turkey</b> <b>vulture,</b> the lesser yellow-headed vulture, and the greater yellow-headed vulture—forage by detecting the scent of ethyl mercaptan, a gas produced by the beginnings of decay in dead animals. Their heightened ability to detect odors allows them to search for carrion below the forest canopy. The black vulture is aggressive when feeding, and may chase the slightly larger <b>turkey</b> <b>vulture</b> from carcasses.|$|E

40|$|Copyright 2014 by American Association of Zoo Veterinarians. Free-flying <b>turkey</b> <b>vultures</b> (Cathartes aura) were sampled in California to {{investigate}} the fecal shedding prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility of Salmonella enterica, Campylobacter spp., and Escherichia coli. Nine different serotypes of Salmonella enterica were detected in cloacal swabs from <b>turkey</b> <b>vultures,</b> and 6 % of vultures were shedding Campylobacter spp [...] <b>Turkey</b> <b>vultures</b> sampled at a location with range sheep {{were more likely to}} shed tetracycline-resistant E. coli, suggesting that proximity to livestock facilities could facilitate acquisition of drug-resistant bacteria in avian scavengers. These findings illustrate the importance of assessing drug-resistant pathogen transfer at the livestock-wildlife interface...|$|R

5|$|Studies of the {{olfactory}} bulbs of dromaeosaurids {{reveal that}} they had similar olfactory ratios for their size to other non-avian theropods and modern birds with an acute sense of smell, such as tyrannosaurids and the <b>turkey</b> <b>vulture,</b> probably reflecting {{the importance of the}} olfactory sense in the daily activities of dromaeosaurids such as finding food.|$|E
5|$|It differs in {{appearance}} from the similar {{lesser yellow-headed vulture}} in several ways. It {{is larger than the}} lesser yellow-headed vulture, with a longer, broader tail. The plumage is a dark, glossy black in contrast to the lesser yellow-headed vulture's browner plumage. Its legs are darker in color and its head is more yellow and less orange/pink than that of the lesser yellow-headed vulture. Its wings are broader and its flight is also steadier. Unlike {{the other members of the}} genus Cathartes, the greater yellow-headed vulture has relatively dark inner primaries, which contrast slightly with the paler secondaries and outer primaries. The greater yellow-headed vulture prefers to live in forests while the lesser yellow-headed vulture prefers to inhabit savannas, and it is more heavily built than the lesser yellow-headed vulture. The greater yellow-headed vulture is also somewhat larger than the <b>turkey</b> <b>vulture.</b> It can be distinguished from that species only at relatively close range by the differing head coloration. The underwing coloration is similar to the <b>turkey</b> <b>vulture</b> but the greater yellow-headed usually has a faint but broad and dark band vertically down the middle of the wings.|$|E
5|$|It soars high while {{searching for}} food, holding its wings {{horizontally}} when gliding. It flaps in short bursts which {{are followed by}} short periods of gliding. Its flight is less efficient than that of other vultures, as the wings are not as long, forming a smaller wing area. In comparison with the <b>turkey</b> <b>vulture,</b> the black vulture flaps its wings more frequently during flight. It is known to regurgitate when approached or disturbed, which assists in predator deterrence and taking flight by decreasing its takeoff weight. Like all New World vultures, the black vulture often defecates on its own legs, using the evaporation {{of the water in}} the feces and/or urine to cool itself, a process known as urohidrosis. It cools the blood vessels in the unfeathered tarsi and feet, and causes white uric acid to streak the legs. Because it lacks a syrinx, the black vulture, like other New World vultures, has very few vocalization capabilities. It is generally silent, but can make hisses and grunts when agitated or while feeding. The black vulture is , and roosts in large groups. In areas where their ranges overlap, the black vulture will roost on the bare branches of dead trees alongside groups of turkey vultures. The black vulture generally forages in groups; a flock of black vultures can easily drive a rival <b>turkey</b> <b>vulture,</b> which is generally solitary while foraging, from a carcass.|$|E

50|$|Animals that inhabit this {{national}} park are coyotes, deer, porcupines, beavers, foxes, skunks, raccoons, <b>turkey</b> <b>vultures,</b> rabbits, squirrels, chickadees, and weasels.|$|R
5|$|The taxonomic {{placement}} of the <b>turkey</b> <b>vulture</b> and the remaining six species of New World vultures has been in flux. Though both are similar in appearance and have similar ecological roles, the New World and Old World vultures evolved from different ancestors {{in different parts of}} the world. Some earlier authorities suggested that the New World vultures were more closely related to storks. More recent authorities maintained their overall position in the order Falconiformes along with the Old World vultures or place them in their own order, Cathartiformes.|$|E
5|$|Mimesis or cryptic {{aggressive}} mimicry {{is where}} the predator mimics an organism that its prey is indifferent to. Unlike in all cases above, the predator is ignored by the prey, allowing it to avoid detection until the prey are close enough for the predator to strike. This is effectively a form of camouflage. The zone-tailed hawk (Buteo albonotatus), which resembles the <b>turkey</b> <b>vulture</b> (Cathartes aura), may provide one such example. It flies amongst them, suddenly breaking from the formation and ambushing its prey. Here the hawk's presence is of no evident significance to the vultures, affecting them neither negatively or positively. There is some controversy over {{whether this is a}} true case of mimicry.|$|E
5|$|New World {{vultures}} are not {{closely related}} to Old World vultures, but superficially resemble them because of convergent evolution. Like the Old World vultures, they are scavengers. Unlike Old World vultures, which find carcasses by sight, New World vultures have {{a good sense of}} smell with which they locate carcasses. The <b>turkey</b> <b>vulture</b> has a red head. The black vulture has a grey head. Although not a water bird, a flock of black vultures at the Myakka River State Park, southeast of Sarasota, has been seen bathing {{at the edge of the}} lake and then drying out their wings in the same way as cormorants like the Florida anhinga. This habit may help free them of parasites.|$|E
50|$|Common {{birds in}} the park include both black and <b>turkey</b> <b>vultures,</b> Canada geese, red-winged blackbirds, red-tailed hawks, red-shouldered hawks, and barn swallows.|$|R

5|$|The <b>turkey</b> <b>vulture</b> is a {{scavenger}} and feeds {{almost exclusively}} on carrion. It finds its food using its keen eyes and sense of smell, flying low enough to detect the gases produced by {{the beginnings of the}} process of decay in dead animals. In flight, it uses thermals to move through the air, flapping its wings infrequently. It roosts in large community groups. Lacking a syrinx—the vocal organ of birds—its only vocalizations are grunts or low hisses. It nests in caves, hollow trees, or thickets. Each year it generally raises two chicks, which it feeds by regurgitation. It has very few natural predators. In the United States, the vulture receives legal protection under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918.|$|E
5|$|While some of {{the native}} flora and fauna of the Sonoran Desert can be found within Phoenix city limits, most {{are found in the}} suburbs and the undeveloped desert areas {{surrounding}} the city. Native mammal species include coyote, javelina, bobcat, mountain lion, desert cottontail rabbit, jackrabbit, antelope ground squirrel, mule deer, ringtail, coati, and multiple species of bats, such as the Mexican free-tailed bat and western pipistrelle, that roost in and around the city. There are many species of native birds, including Costa's hummingbird, Anna's hummingbird, Gambel's quail, Gila woodpecker, mourning dove, white-winged dove, the roadrunner, the cactus wren, and many species of raptors, including falcons, hawks, owls, vultures (such as the <b>turkey</b> <b>vulture</b> and black vulture), and eagles, including the golden and the bald eagle.|$|E
5|$|Of the 127 {{bird species}} found along the Merced River, only 35 occur {{along the entire}} length of the river. Many of these birds are migratory and only pass the area a few times every year, while 109 species of birds are found only in the {{breeding}} season. Birds are more abundant along the slow-moving lower river, which has more suitable riparian habitat compared to the rocky, swift upper river. Common species of bird throughout the basin include ruby-crowned kinglet, cedar waxwing, American robin, yellow-rumped warbler, tree swallow and European starling, and several endangered species, including white-tailed kite and Swainson's hawk. Birds that occur commonly in the middle and upper sections of the Merced River include mourning dove, Cassin's finch, California quail, dark-eyed junco, woodpecker, dipper, great blue heron, scrub jay, red-winged blackbird, red-tailed hawk, <b>turkey</b> <b>vulture,</b> cliff swallow, canyon wren, merganser, and bald eagles. Common insects found along the river include mayflies, stoneflies and caddisflies. The river is impacted by invasive Asiatic clam, Chinese mitten crab, and New Zealand mud snail.|$|E

40|$|Vultures {{represent}} a serious hazard to {{military and civilian}} aircraft {{throughout much of the}} USA. According to the Breeding Bird Survey, populations of black vultures (Coragyps atratus) and <b>turkey</b> <b>vultures</b> (Cathartes aura) in South Carolina are growing exponentially. Safety concerns in light of burgeoning vulture populations prompted the initiation of a 2 -year study of vulture movements and activities at the Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) in Beaufort, SC. We trapped and outfitted <b>turkey</b> <b>vultures</b> and black vultures with solar powered GPS satellite transmitters. Each hour the location, altitude, and speed of each transmittered bird were recorded. We compiled and analyzed this information to determine daily and seasonal altitudinal patterns of each species, to identify major roost sites, and to assess potential hazards posed by vultures to air traffic at MCAS. Here, we report data from 8 black vultures followed for a mean of 12 months and 7 <b>turkey</b> <b>vultures</b> followed for a mean of almost 14 months...|$|R

5|$|Unanticipated deaths among recent condor populations {{occurred}} due {{to contact}} with golden eagles, lead poisoning, {{and other factors}} such as power line collisions. Since 1994, captive-bred California condors {{have been trained to}} avoid power lines and people. Since the implementation of this aversion conditioning program, the number of condor deaths due to power lines has greatly decreased. Lead poisoning due to fragmented lead bullets in large game waste is a particularly big problem for condors due to their extremely strong digestive juices; lead waste is not as much of a problem for other avian scavengers such as the <b>turkey</b> <b>vulture</b> and common raven. This problem has been addressed in California by the Ridley-Tree Condor Preservation Act, a bill that went into effect July 1, 2008 that requires that hunters use non-lead bullets when hunting in the condor's range. Blood lead levels in golden eagles as well as turkey vultures has declined with the implementation of the Ridley-Tree Condor Preservation Act, demonstrating that the legislation has helped reduce other species' lead exposures aside from the California condor. There is no comparable anti-lead-bullet legislation in the other states in which the condor currently resides.|$|E
5|$|Coastal areas {{provide a}} {{constant}} food supply, and in particularly plentiful areas, some Andean condors limit their foraging area to several kilometers of beach-front land. They locate carrion by spotting it or by following other scavengers, such as corvids or other vultures. It may follow New World vultures {{of the genus}} Cathartes—the <b>turkey</b> <b>vulture</b> (C. aura), the lesser yellow-headed vulture (C. burrovianus), and the greater yellow-headed vulture (C. melambrotus)—to carcasses. The Cathartes vultures forage by smell, detecting the scent of ethyl mercaptan, a gas produced by the beginnings of decay in dead animals. These smaller vultures cannot rip through the tougher hides of these larger animals with {{the efficiency of the}} larger condor, and their interactions are often an example of mutual dependence between species. Black vultures (Coragyps atratus), king vultures (Sarcoramphus papa) and even mammalian scavengers may sometimes track Cathartes vultures for carcasses but the condor is invariably dominant among the scavengers in its range. Andean condors are intermittent eaters in the wild, often going for a few days without eating, then gorging themselves on several pounds at once, sometimes {{to the point of being}} unable to lift off the ground. Because its feet and talons are not adapted to grasping, it must feed while on the ground. Like other carrion-feeders, it plays an important role in its ecosystem by disposing of carrion which would otherwise be a breeding ground for disease.|$|E
