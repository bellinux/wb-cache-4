5|$|Another {{result of}} <b>the</b> <b>coup</b> {{was that the}} work {{that had been done}} by British {{intelligence}} with the anti-Axis government of Cvetković and Maček was lost. By supporting <b>the</b> <b>coup</b> plotters, the SOE undermined the balance in Yugoslav politics that had been achieved by the Cvetković–Maček Agreement. Serb nationalists supported and welcomed <b>the</b> <b>coup</b> because it ended Croatian autonomy under the Agreement and freed them to pursue a Greater Serbia agenda. <b>The</b> <b>coup</b> and its immediate aftermath also contributed to the paralysis within the Yugoslav government-in-exile {{during the rest of the}} war, due to ongoing disputes regarding the legitimacy of the Cvetković–Maček Agreement.|$|E

Two days before <b>the</b> <b>coup,</b> the Cvetković government had signed the Vienna Protocol on the Accession of Yugoslavia to the Tripartite Pact (Axis). <b>The</b> <b>coup</b> had been planned for several months, but the signing of the Tripartite Pact spurred the organisers to carry it out, encouraged by the British Special Operations Executive.|$|E

5|$|After the Sejny Uprising, a Polish {{revolt against}} the Lithuanian {{authorities}} {{in one of the}} disputed border regions, Lithuanian intelligence intensified its investigation of the Polish minority and sympathizers in Lithuania, and uncovered the planned coup. The Lithuanians, not knowing the membership of the PMO, arrested numerous Polish activists and destabilized the PMO network enough to prevent <b>the</b> <b>coup</b> attempt. Later the full membership list was obtained and the PMO in Lithuania was dissolved. <b>The</b> <b>coup</b> further strained Polish–Lithuanian relations.|$|E

However, their leaders were barred from participating because of their involvement in <b>the</b> <b>coup,</b> and known anti-Mba organizers were deported to remote parts of the country. In addition, M'ba was known to have bribed voters with banknotes.|$|E

5|$|Khánh had {{a meeting}} with Lodge in the morning of <b>the</b> <b>coup</b> for around an hour after {{arranging}} a meeting through Wilson.

However, if Lodge was concerned about keeping a low profile regarding <b>the</b> <b>coup,</b> Khánh was not, arriving at Dunn's residence with seven jeeploads of aides before embracing Lodge. He told Lodge that he would go after the communists aggressively and that <b>the</b> <b>coup</b> would not disrupt the military in any significant way. Khánh vowed to intensify the war effort, ask Lodge for guidance constantly, introduce democracy and install a direct phone line between Vietnamese military headquarters and the US Embassy. Lodge also reported that Khánh wanted {{to give the impression that}} he seriously thought that neutralist deal involving de Gaulle was a genuine and ominous prospect, and that de Gaulle had made much progress in influencing the previous administration.|$|E

5|$|Phát {{and other}} pro-Diệm {{officers}} opposed the Buddhist influence being exerted on Khánh.

Thảo thus believed Kỳ would not intervene against him, but Kỳ was strongly opposed to Thảo and Phát. American intelligence analysts had believed that General Don was involved in <b>the</b> <b>coup</b> with Phát and Thảo, but this was proven false when the action started. Eight months after <b>the</b> <b>coup</b> was over, Don told the American historian George McTurnan Kahin {{that he had been}} plotting with Thảo, who had planned for him to become Defense Minister and Chief of Staff of the military, but that the Đại Việt and Thảo's Catholic civilian allies had insisted on installing Khiêm, a Catholic. A month before <b>the</b> <b>coup,</b> American intelligence analysts had believed that Thảo was planning to replace Khánh as commander-in-chief with Don.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish coup of July 1936 {{fractured}} the Spanish Republican Armed Forces {{and marked}} the beginning of the Spanish Civil War. Following a period of troubles in the Second Spanish Republic, a group of officers attempted to overthrow the left-wing Popular Front government, elected five months previously, in a military coup.

5|$|The Yugoslav coup d'état {{occurred}} on 27 March 1941 in Belgrade, Kingdom of Yugoslavia. <b>The</b> <b>coup</b> was planned and {{conducted by a}} group of pro-Western Serb-nationalist Royal Yugoslav Air Force officers formally led by its commander, General Dušan Simović, who had been associated with a number of coup plots from 1938 onwards. For practical purposes Brigadier General of Military Aviation Borivoje Mirković, Major Živan Knežević of the Yugoslav Royal Guards, and his brother Radoje Knežević all performed leadership roles in the conduct of <b>the</b> <b>coup.</b> In addition to Radoje Knežević, some other civilian leaders were probably aware of <b>the</b> <b>coup</b> before it was launched and moved to support it once it occurred, but they were not among the organisers.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> Venezuelan <b>coup</b> {{attempts}} of 1992 were attempts to {{seize control of}} the government of Venezuela by the Hugo Chávez-led Revolutionary Bolivarian Movement-200. <b>The</b> first <b>coup</b> attempt took place on February 4, 1992, and was led by Chávez. A second coup attempt on November 27, 1992, took place while Chávez was in prison but was directed by a group of young military officers who were loyal to the Revolutionary Bolivarian Movement-200. <b>The</b> <b>coups</b> were directed against President Carlos Andrés Pérez and occurred in a period marked by neo-liberal economic reforms, which were attempted in order to decrease the country's level of indebtedness and had caused major protests and labour unrest. Despite their failure to depose the government of Carlos Andrés, <b>the</b> February <b>coup</b> attempts brought Chávez into the national spotlight. Fighting during <b>the</b> <b>coups</b> resulted in <b>the</b> deaths of at least 143 people and perhaps as many as several hundred.|$|R
5|$|The communists {{were pleased}} by <b>the</b> <b>coup,</b> as the South Vietnamese {{military}} was wasting its resources and energy on infighting.

5|$|There is {{considerable}} academic debate concerning {{the involvement of}} Antanas Smetona in planning <b>the</b> <b>coup.</b> In 1931, Augustinas Voldemaras, who had since been ousted {{from the government and}} forced into exile, wrote that Smetona had been planning <b>the</b> <b>coup</b> since 1925. Historian Zenonas Butkus asserted that an idea of a coup had been raised as early as 1923. However, this time frame is disputed, since the military did not take action until the autumn of 1926. Smetona's personal secretary, Aleksandras Merkelis, held that Smetona knew about <b>the</b> <b>coup,</b> but neither inspired nor organized it. Before <b>the</b> <b>coup,</b> Smetona had been the editor of Lietuvis (The Lithuanian), and a shift in its orientation that took place in late November has been cited as evidence that he was not informed about <b>the</b> <b>coup</b> until then. Before the issue of 25 November appeared, the newspaper was critical of the government and of the Christian Democrats. On that date, however, the newspaper published several articles about 21 November student protest and an article headlined Bolshevism's Threat to Lithuania. The latter article argued that the communists posed a genuine threat and that the current government was incapable of dealing with it. After that date, the newspaper ceased issuing criticisms of the Christian Democrats.|$|E

5|$|Tuyen's group {{ended up}} being led by Thảo but his initial coup plans were shelved when American CIA agent Lucien Conein {{instructed}} Thảo's superior, General Khiêm, to stop <b>the</b> <b>coup</b> {{on the grounds that}} it was premature. Thảo's motivation for involvement in the plotting is generally attributed to communist instructions for him to cause infighting within the ARVN whenever possible. He resumed plotting, intending to stage <b>the</b> <b>coup</b> on 24 October. He had recruited various infantry, marine and paratroop units for his scheme, totalling 3,000 men. Thảo's group did not carry out <b>the</b> <b>coup</b> after senior generals persuaded him to integrate his forces into their larger group, which was more likely to succeed. Thảo reasoned that aligning himself with a group of officers that were likely to successful would yield more influence in the resulting junta. <b>The</b> <b>coup</b> was successfully executed on 1 November 1963 under the leadership of Generals Dương Văn Minh and Trần Văn Đôn.|$|E

5|$|Accounts of {{the final}} {{termination}} of <b>the</b> <b>coup</b> attempt vary between historians.

Miller refused, and instead showed the document to his superiors, who in turn informed Dean Acheson. Gleijeses writes that Acheson immediately spoke to Truman as a result of this document, and the operation was cut short. Nick Cullather writes that due to Somoza spreading the word about <b>the</b> <b>coup,</b> the State Department decided that the cover of the operation had been lost. Other diplomats began to learn of the operation, and on 8 October Dean Acheson summoned Smith and called off the operation.|$|E
