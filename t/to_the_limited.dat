5|$|Aspirin is a {{first-line}} {{treatment for}} the fever and joint-pain symptoms of acute rheumatic fever. The therapy often lasts for one to two weeks, and is rarely indicated for longer periods. After fever and pain have subsided, the aspirin is no longer necessary, since it does not decrease the incidence of heart complications and residual rheumatic heart disease. Naproxen {{has been shown to}} be as effective as aspirin and less toxic, but due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>limited</b> clinical experience, naproxen is recommended only as a second-line treatment.|$|E
5|$|Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>limited</b> budget, the {{restoration}} had been primarily focused on cleaning the sculptures, and Van Erp did {{not solve the}} drainage problem.

Van Erp used concrete from which alkali salts and calcium hydroxide leached and were transported {{into the rest of}} the construction. This caused some problems, so that a further thorough renovation was urgently needed.|$|E

5|$|Cars are the {{preferred}} {{mode of transport}} in the suburb. At the 2011 census, the Australian Bureau of Statistics reported that 68.8% of Hamersley's residents were drivers or passengers of cars in their commute to work, a figure only slightly lower than the north metropolitan average of 71.3%. Other private modes of transport included motorcycling (0.7%), cycling (1.1%) and walking (1.3%). The low number of walking commuters compared to the north metropolitan average of 1.5% and the Perth Statistical Region average of 1.81% is most likely due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>limited</b> number of workplaces within walking distance.|$|E

5|$|Casey's initial {{need was}} for {{engineer}} units {{to accomplish the}} daunting construction program, but soon stocks of engineer supplies and equipment began to run low. This was exacerbated by incoming units arriving without their equipment, or with it stowed on numerous ships, which often arrived at various ports in a theater where ports were hundred or thousands of miles apart. Critical shortages developed of tractors, graders, concrete mixers and welding equipment. In {{the absence of a}} proper stock control system, an overall coordinating agency, and adequate numbers of engineer depot units, the allocation and distribution of the meager supplies on hand were difficult tasks. The worst problem was spare parts. Equipment was operated around the clock under harsh conditions and soon wore out or broke. A large proportion of equipment became unserviceable for lack of spare parts. Requisitions sent to the United States took months to arrive, so recourse was made <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>limited</b> sources of supply in Australia.|$|E
5|$|Due partly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>limited</b> {{success of}} his latest book outside Indiana, Riley was persuaded to begin working with other midwestern writers to attempt to form an {{association}} to promote their work. Popular Indiana writer Lew Wallace, author of , was a major promoter of the effort. During 1885, {{more than one hundred}} writers joined the group. They held their first meeting in July, naming themselves the Western Association of Writers. At the meeting Maurice Thompson was named president, and Riley vice president. The association never succeeded in its goals of creating a powerful advertising force, but became a social club and a rival literary community to the eastern writing establishment. Riley was disappointed with the shortcomings of the group, but came to depend on its regular meetings as a escape from his normally hectic schedule.|$|E
5|$|Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>limited</b> {{interface}} of the 3DS, {{as well as}} to {{take advantage}} of the touch screen, 3D has vastly unique controls when compared to other games in the Metal Gear series. While the game has been heavily criticized for these control changes, use of the Circle Pad Pro peripheral has been cited to alleviate much of the control issues of the 3DS. This is done by restoring camera movement to the second analog stick, adding ZL and ZR buttons for aiming and attacking, and allowing the face buttons to be used in a manner more in line with all other releases in the Metal Gear series.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Lily was a {{short-lived}} Category 1 hurricane of August 1971 that devastated {{the city of}} Puerto Vallarta in Mexico. Forming from an area of cloudiness associated with former Atlantic Tropical Storm Chloe, the storm slowly intensified, building to peak intensity just before landfall northwest of Manzanillo, Colima on August 31. The hurricane quickly weakened and became extratropical. After leaving land, the extratropical remnants of Lily dissipated on September 1. The storm's movement close to land affected shipping due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>limited</b> warning, which was partially set back due to difficulties in clarifying the hurricane's position on radar from reconnaissance aircraft.|$|E

5|$|Initially unplanned, The Missing Link was {{developed}} by Human Revolutions core staff, including producer David Anfossi, director Jean-François Dugas, writer Mary DeMarle, and composer Michael McCann.

A boss battle was designed to allow for multiple solutions, in contrast <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>limited</b> action-based approaches of the main game's boss fights. Reception was generally positive: despite some mixed opinions on the story, praise was given to the improved visuals and gameplay.|$|E

5|$|Per the {{regulations}} for the 2015 season, three practice sessions were held, two 90-minute sessions on Friday and another one-hour session before qualifying on Saturday. However, all three sessions were disrupted and little running took place. During {{the first session}} on Friday morning, a spillage of diesel on track prevented the cars from going out on until very late in the session. Eventually, Nico Hülkenberg topped the session for Force India, ahead of his compatriots Nico Rosberg and Sebastian Vettel. Since water was used to clear the surface, the first laps were run on intermediate tyres by most drivers, with both Williams cars being equipped with full wet tyres, but Valtteri Bottas spun on them entering the pit lane. Later, the track dried enough to use slick tyres, Fernando Alonso being the first to do so. Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>limited</b> running, the last minutes were busy with most cars out on track. Marcus Ericsson however was confined to the sidelines as he stopped with an engine problem. As Lewis Hamilton spun on his last timed lap, he needed to settle for seventh fastest.|$|E
5|$|Player {{controls}} include clockwise and counterclockwise rotation, forward thrust, firing torpedoes, and hyperspace. Initially {{these were}} controlled using the front-panel test {{switches on the}} PDP-1 minicomputer, with four switches for each player, but these proved to be awkward to use and wore out quickly under normal gameplay, as well as causing players to accidentally flip the computer's control and power switches. The location of the switches also left one player {{off to one side}} of the CRT display due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>limited</b> space in front of the computer, which left them at a disadvantage. To alleviate these problems, Kotok and Saunders created a detached control device, essentially an early gamepad. The gamepad had a switch for turning left or right, another for forward thrust or hyperspace, and a torpedo launch button. The button was silent so that the opposing player would not have a warning that the player was attempting to fire a torpedo during a cooldown period.|$|E
5|$|Taxable, Glimmer and Big Drum were {{complicated}} in execution, requiring {{coordination of}} air and naval forces. Launched in poor weather conditions, Taxable {{did not appear to}} have the desired effect and failed to elicit any significant response from the Germans. The reaction to Glimmer was more encouraging. The attacks on the bomber squadrons indicated, at least to the satisfaction of RAF Bomber Command, that the Germans believed a genuine threat existed. There is no evidence that Big Drum elicited any specific response from the shore. According to historian Mary Barbier, the adverse conditions and complexity of the operations contributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>limited</b> enemy response.|$|E
