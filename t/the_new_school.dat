5|$|A {{majority}} of Old School {{leaders in the}} North were convinced of the orthodoxy of <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>School.</b> Some within the Old School, chiefly Princeton theologian Charles Hodge, claimed that there were still ministers within <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>School</b> who adhered to New Haven theology. Nevertheless, the Old and New School General Assemblies in the North and a {{majority of}} their presbyteries approved the reunion in 1869 of the PCUSA.|$|E
5|$|Notwithstanding the General Assembly's {{attempt to}} promote peace and unity, two {{distinct}} factions, the Old School and <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>School,</b> developed through the 1820s over {{the issues of}} confessional subscription, revivalism, {{and the spread of}} New England theology. <b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>School</b> faction advocated revivalism and New England theology, while the Old School was opposed to the extremes of revivalism and desired strict conformity to the Westminster Confession. The ideological center of Old School Presbyterianism was Princeton Theological Seminary, which under the leadership of Archibald Alexander and Charles Hodge became associated with a brand of Reformed scholasticism known as Princeton Theology.|$|E

5|$|Breckinridge {{was equally}} {{controversial}} in internal church politics. He rebuked the Synod of the Western Reserve for de-emphasizing and effectively abandoning {{the office of}} Ruling Elder. He also condemned the governance of Presbyterian missionaries by anyone other than the Presbyterian church. In 1834, he was the chief author of the Act and Testimony, a document summarizing the contentions between the Old and New Schools. <b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>School</b> resented Breckinridge and those who signed the Act and Testimony, and even some in the Old School camp had hoped for a more moderate course. The differences between the Old and New Schools widened over the teachings of Albert Barnes, and <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>School</b> members were ejected from the Presbyterian Church in 1837. Because of his leadership in the Old School-New School controversy, Breckinridge was elected moderator of the Old School branch's General Assembly in 1841.|$|E

5|$|Heresy {{trials of}} {{prominent}} New School leaders further deepened the division within the denomination.
