It's talking to God, putting things in the hands of God, trusting that you're living in God's world and praying for God's guidance. And being absolutely faithful to the core principles of Jesus' teachings." [...] In 2011, Rice participated in the [...] "I Am Second" [...] project, with a short documentary about her spiritual journey.

60|$|The same on the psychical plane. We either love too much, or impose {{our will}} too much, are too spiritual or too sensual. There {{is not and}} cannot be any actual norm of human conduct.

Some men must be too spiritual, some must be too sensual. Some must be too sympathetic, and some must be too proud. We {{have no desire to}} say what men ought to be. We only wish to say <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>kinds</b> of ways of being, and {{there is no such thing}} as human perfection. No man can be anything more than just himself, in genuine living relation to all his surroundings. But that which I am, when I am myself, will certainly be anathema to those who hate individual integrity, and want to swarm. And that which I, being myself, am in myself, may make the hair bristle with rage on a man who is also himself, but very different from me. Then let it bristle. And if mine bristle back again, then let us, if we must, fly at one another like two enraged men. It is how it should be. We've got to learn to live from the center of our own responsibility only, and let other people do the same.|$|E
