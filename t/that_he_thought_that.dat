5|$|The Poor People's Campaign was {{controversial}} {{even within}} the civil rights movement. Rustin resigned from the march, stating that {{the goals of the}} campaign were too broad, that its demands were unrealizable, and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> these campaigns would accelerate the backlash and repression on the poor and the black.|$|E
5|$|According to monk and biographer Teodosije the Hilandarian, King Radoslav {{was a good}} ruler at first, {{but fell}} under the {{influence}} of his wife, Queen Anna, daughter of the Epirote ruler Theodore Komnenos Doukas (1216–1230). The Serbian nobility most likely disliked Radoslav due to this Greek influence. Radoslav was probably safe from domestic rebellion as long as Theodore remained strong. In 1230, Theodore was defeated and captured by Emperor Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria, after which Radoslav's position seems to have weakened; some of his nobility revolted in the autumn of 1233. Teodosije said that the nobility no longer supported Radoslav, and instead supported Vladislav. Radoslav and his wife fled to Dubrovnik in 1233. He was unable to regain the kingdom, but eventually returned as a monk. There are indications that Radoslav organized rebellions against Vladislav, and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> he would regain the throne. This is evident from a document dated February 4, 1234, which promised Ragusa trading privileges once Radoslav had returned to Serbia and become king again. Because of this, Vladislav began threatening Ragusa, which then turned to Ban Matej Ninoslav of Bosnia for help. The revolt against Vladislav was unsuccessful, and Radoslav joined the court of Epirote ruler Manuel in Dyrrhachium.|$|E

The journal also reveals that it was Cafferty who forced the gun into his hand, getting Aengus's fingerprints on it.

25|$|In 1675, Huygens {{patented}} {{a pocket}} watch. The watches which {{were made in}} Paris from c. 1675 and following the Huygens plan are notable for lacking a fusee for equalizing the mainspring torque. The implication is that Huygens thought that his spiral spring would isochronise the balance, {{in the same way}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> the cycloidally shaped suspension curbs on his clocks would isochronise the pendulum.|$|E
25|$|In {{the scene}} where the knights were combatting the Rabbit of Caerbannog, a real white rabbit was used, {{switched}} with puppets for its killings.

He also stated <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that,</b> had they been more experienced in filmmaking, the crew would have just purchased a rabbit instead. Otherwise, the rabbit himself was unharmed. Also, the rabbit-bite effects were done by special puppetry by both Gilliam and SFX technician John Horton.|$|E

Rucker will be able to work without restrictions for golfers, but because he is not registered with the NFL players' union, he initially will only be able to meet with NFL players under very limited circumstances.|$|E
25|$|Burnside at {{this time}} ordered his reserve, the Third Brigade, into the line to support Reno's Second Brigade. The 4th Rhode Island {{replaced}} the 21st Massachusetts, which had used up its ammunition. While trading places, Colonel Isaac P. Rodman of the 4th Rhode Island was told by Lieutenant Colonel William S. Clark of the 21st Massachusetts <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> another attack on the brick kiln would be successful. Rodman sent a courier to General Parke informing {{him that he was}} taking responsibility, then formed his regiment and ordered them to charge. Armed with better knowledge of the enemy, this charge was successful. The 4th Rhode Island captured nine brass field pieces, and found themselves in rear of the Rebel entrenchments.|$|E
25|$|Makkali Gosala {{seems to}} have {{combined}} the ideas of older schools of thought into an eclectic doctrine. He appears to have believed in niyati (destiny), svabhava (nature), and sangati (change), and possibly parinama, which may have prompted other philosophical schools to label him variously as ahetuvadin, vainayikavadin, ajnanavadin, and issarakaranavadin. According to him all beings undergo development (parinama). This culminates {{in the course of}} time (samsarasuddhi) in final salvation to which all beings are destined under the impact of the factors of niyati (destiny), bhava (nature), and sangati (change). As such destiny does not appear as the only player, but rather chance or indeterminism plays equal part in his doctrine. He thus subscribed to niyativada (fatalism) only in the sense <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> some future events like salvation for all were strictly determined.|$|E

25|$|After taking command, Sinclair {{assessed}} {{that the}} companies of the ships off Fiji could not provide sufficient personnel to co-ordinate an evacuation. He asked Gration to provide troops to bolster his strength, and this was authorised by Cabinet in a meeting held on 21 May. By this time, Australia had received requests from seven countries, including the United States and Japan, to evacuate their citizens from Fiji if required. Despite taking this step, the Australian government {{believed that it was}} unlikely that law and order would break down in Fiji, with Foreign Minister Gareth Evans telling the media <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> there was a 20 percent chance of this occurring. At no stage was it considered possible that the ODF would be involved with fighting against the RFMF, and it was assumed that the Fijian military would want to help assist the evacuation of foreign nationals from the country.|$|E
25|$|The {{supporters}} of Caesar argued that Caesar deserved {{an extension of}} his command so that the fruit of his success would not be lost. There was a debate on this. Pompey showed goodwill towards Caesar. He claimed that he had letters from Caesar {{in which he said}} he wanted to be relieved of his command, but he said <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> he should be allowed to stand for the consulship in absentia. Cato opposed this and said that if Caesar wanted this he had to lay down his arms and become a private citizen. Pompey did not contest Cato's view. This gave rise to suspicions about his real feelings towards Caesar. Plutarch wrote that Pompey also asked Caesar for the troops he had lent him back, using the Parthian war as a pretext. Although Caesar knew why Pompey asked this he sent the troops back home with generous gifts. Appian wrote that Caesar gave these soldiers a donation and also sent one of his legions to Rome. Pompey was drifting toward the optimates and away from Caesar. According to Plutarch the rift between Pompey and Cato became accentuated when Pompey fell seriously ill in Naples in 50 BC. When he recovered the people of Naples offered thanksgiving sacrifices. This celebration spread throughout Italy. He was feted in towns he travelled to on his way back to Rome. Plutarch wrote that this was said ‘to have done more than anything else to bring about the subsequent civil war’. It made Pompey arrogant, incautious and contemptuous of Caesar’s power. The following year the two men were fighting each other in the Great Roman Civil War.|$|E

5000|$|Dickens {{was criticized}} for using a {{character}} that was a thief.
