5|$|It {{stipulated that}} Hong Kong would retain its laws and be {{guaranteed}} {{a high degree}} of autonomy for at least 50 years after the transfer. The Hong Kong Basic Law, based on English law, would serve as the constitutional document after the <b>transfer.</b> <b>It</b> was ratified in 1990. The expiry of the 1898 lease on the New Territories in 1997 created problems for business contracts, property leases and confidence among foreign investors.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} M-108 designation dated back to 1928. This {{version was}} transferred to local control in 1957, but revived later under a similar routing in 1960. On April 29, 2010, the Petoskey News-Review reported that the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) would rebuild the roadway in preparation to <b>transfer</b> <b>it</b> back to local control once again. MDOT and local officials signed memoranda of understanding, completing {{the transfer of the}} roadway on December 9, 2010.|$|E
5|$|There are two known {{examples}} of molecular-scale rotating structures used by living cells. ATP synthase is an enzyme {{used in the}} process of energy storage and <b>transfer.</b> <b>It</b> bears some similarity to the flagellar motors discussed below. ATP synthase is thought to have arisen by modular evolution, in which two subunits with their own functions have become associated and gained a new functionality.|$|E
50|$|This {{species was}} first {{published}} as Borago zeylanica by Nicolaas Laurens Burman in 1768. In 1810, Robert Brown <b>transferred</b> <b>it</b> into Trichodesma, but this was retained only until 1882, when Ferdinand von Mueller <b>transferred</b> <b>it</b> into Pollichia. In 1891, Otto Kuntze <b>transferred</b> <b>it</b> into Boraginella, and in 1898 William Philip Hiern <b>transferred</b> <b>it</b> into Borraginoides. Despite these many later <b>transfers,</b> <b>it</b> is Brown's placement that is currently accepted.|$|R

50|$|The fungus was {{originally}} described in 1903 by American mycologist Charles Horton Peck as Cortinarius punctifolius. Alexander H. Smith <b>transferred</b> <b>it</b> to Flammulina in 1945. It was given its current name when Rolf Singer <b>transferred</b> <b>it</b> to Gymnopilus in 1951.|$|R
5|$|Typical pulsar periods {{for young}} pulsars {{are of the}} order of one second, and they {{increase}} with time; the very short periods exhibited by so-called millisecond pulsars are due to the transfer of material from a binary companion. The pulse period of PSR B1620-26 is a few milliseconds, providing strong evidence for matter <b>transfer.</b> <b>It</b> is believed that as the pulsar's red giant companion expanded, it filled and then exceeded its Roche lobe, so that its surface layers started being transferred onto the neutron star.|$|E
5|$|Some of Aristotle's {{observations}} were not taken seriously by science {{until they were}} independently rediscovered in the 19th century. For example, he recorded that male octopuses have a hectocotylus, a tentacle which stores sperm and which can <b>transfer</b> <b>it</b> into the female's body; sometimes it snaps off during mating. The account was dismissed as fanciful until the French naturalist Georges Cuvier described it in his 1817 Le Règne Animal. Aristotle {{also noted that the}} young of the dogfish grow inside their mother's body attached by a cord to something like a placenta (a yolk sac). This was confirmed in 1842 by the German zoologist Johannes Peter Müller. Aristotle noted, too, that a river catfish which he called the glanis cares for its young, as the female leaves after giving birth; the male guards the eggs for forty or fifty days, chasing off small fish which threaten the eggs, and making a murmuring noise. The Swiss American zoologist Louis Agassiz found the account to be correct in 1890.|$|E
5|$|The 3rd Pioneers {{were raised}} in Victoria, in March 1916, from volunteers drawn from Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, and Western Australia and was {{subsequently}} assigned to the 3rd Division. The battalion was formed {{in the aftermath of}} the failed Gallipoli campaign when the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) was expanded as part of plans to <b>transfer</b> <b>it</b> from the Middle East to Europe for service in the trenches along the Western Front. This expansion saw several new infantry divisions raised in Egypt and Australia, as well as specialist support units such as machine gun companies, engineer companies, artillery batteries and pioneer battalions.|$|E
50|$|This {{species was}} {{described}} in the genus Rhacophorus by Guibé in 1974. Glaw and Vences <b>transferred</b> <b>it</b> to Boophis in 1994. Andreone and Randriamahazo <b>transferred</b> <b>it</b> to Mantidactylus in 1997, and finally Glaw and Vences then moved it to Spinomantis in 2006.|$|R
50|$|After being {{released}} from PSII, PQH2 travels to the cytochrome b6f complex which then transfers two electrons from PQH2 to plastocyanin in two separate reactions. The process that occurs {{is similar to the}} Q-cycle in Complex III of the electron transport chain. In the first reaction, PQH2 binds to the complex on the lumen side and one electron is transferred to the iron-sulfur center which then <b>transfers</b> <b>it</b> to cytochrome f which then <b>transfers</b> <b>it</b> to plastocyanin. The second electron is transferred to heme bL which then <b>transfers</b> <b>it</b> to heme bH which then <b>transfers</b> <b>it</b> to PQ. In the second reaction, a second PQH2 gets oxidized, adding an electron to another plastocyanin and PQ.Both reactions together transfer four protons into the lumen.|$|R

5|$|The Charity Commission has {{the power}} to issue an inquiry into a charity under Section 46 of the 2011 act and, if they are {{satisfied}} there has been mismanagement, they are allowed to suspend trustees or officers, appoint additional trustees, vest charity property in the Official Custodian for Charities or order debtors or people holding charity property not to <b>transfer</b> <b>it</b> without their permission. They can also remove trustees on the grounds of bankruptcy, mental incapacity, failure to act or the trustee's absence from the country. The Commission is also authorised to appoint new trustees to replace removed ones, or even {{to increase the number of}} trustees.|$|E
5|$|The lungs are {{the primary}} organs of the {{respiratory}} system in humans and many other animals including a few fish and some snails. In mammals and most other vertebrates, two lungs are located near the backbone {{on either side of}} the heart. Their function in the respiratory system is to extract oxygen from the atmosphere and <b>transfer</b> <b>it</b> into the bloodstream, and to release carbon dioxide from the bloodstream into the atmosphere, in a process of gas exchange. Respiration is driven by different muscular systems in different species. Mammals, reptiles and birds use their different muscles to support and foster breathing. In early tetrapods, air was driven into the lungs by the pharyngeal muscles via buccal pumping, a mechanism still seen in amphibians. In humans, the main muscle of respiration that drives breathing is the diaphragm. The lungs also provide airflow that makes vocal sounds including human speech possible.|$|E

50|$|This {{species was}} first {{published}} by Carl Linnaeus in his 1753 Species plantarum, under the name Gnaphalium luteo-album (the orthography was later changed to omit the hyphen). In 1829, Ludwig Reichenbach <b>transferred</b> <b>it</b> to Helichrysum, but this name was not taken up, and the species was retained in Gnaphalium until 1981, when Olive Mary Hilliard and Brian Laurence Burtt <b>transferred</b> <b>it</b> into Pseudognaphalium.|$|R
5|$|This fern was {{at first}} {{identified}} by André Michaux, in 1803, as black spleenwort (Asplenium adiantum-nigrum). Carl Ludwig Willdenow recognized and {{described it as a}} separate species, which he named Asplenium montanum, in 1810. In 1901, John A. Shafer attempted to <b>transfer</b> <b>it</b> to the genus Athyrium as Athyrium montanum, but this name is illegitimate as a later homonym of Athyrium montanum (Lam.) Röhl. ex Spreng. The species was segregated from Asplenium as Chamaefilix montana by Oliver Atkins Farwell in 1931. The change was not widely accepted and current authorities do not recognize this segregate genus. In 1974, Timothy Reeves described an unusual population of A.montanum from the Shawangunk Mountains. Having used chromatography to show {{that it was not a}} hybrid, he interpreted it as a new form, Asplenium montanum forma shawangunkense. In this form, as contrasted with the usual forma montanum, the leaf blade is yellow-green, the fronds continue highly dissected to the apex and do not come to a pointed tip, the fronds are shorter and more highly dissected than usual, and all fronds are sterile.|$|E
5|$|With Alden on {{a murderous}} rampage towards the Historic District, Cole defeats him {{once and for}} all in a bridge battle. Before jumping in the water, Alden reveals that Kessler exiled him from the First Sons. White, who turns out to be an NSA agent with no {{connection}} to Moya, reaches out to Cole and explains that the Ray Sphere is designed to consume bio-energy from thousands of lives and <b>transfer</b> <b>it</b> to a single user, making them a Conduit. During their search for the Sphere, Kessler publicly challenges Cole to stop a series of bombings across the district, ending with him being forced to choose between saving Trish or her colleagues. Regardless of which choice he makes, Cole fails to keep Trish from dying. Determined to punish Kessler, Cole tracks the Sphere to a remote pier, where he must decide whether to destroy it or use it to become even more powerful. Regardless, the Sphere releases the last of its energy, killing John before disappearing into a vortex.|$|E
