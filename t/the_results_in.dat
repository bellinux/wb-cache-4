5|$|As 91 {{votes are}} needed to elect the Governor from the 180-member body and Democrats and Progressives held 112 seats, it was {{considered}} unlikely that Milne would win. Milne argued that legislators should decide the election in line with how their individual districts voted. Neal Goswami of the Vermont Press Bureau calculated that if each legislator voted according to <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>in</b> their district, the vote {{would result in a}} 90–90 tie. Milne disagreed with this calculation and claimed voting according to district outcome would result in his winning 93–87.|$|E
5|$|As {{the project}} name suggests, the mobile robot is a cobot – a {{collaborative}} robot. During phases of navigation and inspection, a human operator accompanies the robot; {{he can take}} control if necessary, add inspection tasks, note a defect {{that is not in}} the list of robot checks, or validate <b>the</b> <b>results.</b> <b>In</b> the case of pre-flight inspections, the diagnosis of the walk-around is sent to the pilot who decides whether or not to take off.|$|E
5|$|Burney was {{reluctant}} to publish the study {{for fear of being}} labeled a cryptozoologist, but eventually published <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>in</b> American Anthropologist. Burney concluded that while the villagers had possibly encountered a Malagasy hippopotamus, it was also possible that the stories were inaccuratea combination of misidentified animals, old folk traditions, and information the villagers had gathered from modern paleontology.|$|E

5|$|Collecting {{butterflies}} {{was once}} a popular hobby; it has now largely been replaced by photography, recording, and rearing butterflies for release into the wild. The zoological illustrator Frederick William Frohawk succeeded in rearing all the butterfly species found in Britain, {{at a rate of}} four per year, to enable him to draw every stage of each species. He published <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>in</b> the folio sized handbook The Natural History of British Butterflies in 1924.|$|E
5|$|Dalton {{proposed}} that each chemical element {{is composed of}} atoms of a single, unique type, and though they cannot be altered or destroyed by chemical means, they can combine to form more complex structures (chemical compounds). This marked the first truly scientific theory of the atom, since Dalton reached his conclusions by experimentation and examination of <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>in</b> an empirical fashion.|$|E
5|$|In {{a number}} of von Neumann's papers, the methods of {{argument}} he employed are considered even more significant than <b>the</b> <b>results.</b> <b>In</b> anticipation of his later study of dimension theory in algebras of operators, von Neumann used results on equivalence by finite decomposition, and reformulated the problem of measure in terms of functions. In his 1936 paper on analytic measure theory, he used the Haar theorem in the solution of Hilbert's fifth problem {{in the case of}} compact groups. In 1938, he was awarded the Bôcher Memorial Prize for his work in analysis.|$|E

5|$|On arrival back in Australia, the AIF team played three {{first-class}} matches, {{defeating the}} reigning Sheffield Shield champions New South Wales and perennial Shield powerhouse Victoria. A likely victory against Queensland was frustrated due to torrential rain. <b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>in</b> Australia demonstrated {{the strength of}} the AIF team and within a few months of the team's dissolution, Collins would make his Test début, along with his AIF team-mates, Gregory, wicket-keeper Bert Oldfield and the batsmen Johnny Taylor and Nip Pellew.|$|E
5|$|Outer {{space is}} a {{convenient}} setting {{for measuring the}} speed of light because of its large scale and nearly perfect vacuum. Typically, one measures the time needed for light to traverse some reference distance in the solar system, such as the radius of the Earth's orbit. Historically, such measurements could be made fairly accurately, compared to how accurately the length of the reference distance is known in Earth-based units. It is customary to express <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>in</b> astronomical units (AU) per day.|$|E
5|$|The book {{presents}} {{case histories}} {{of all the}} twin-pairs studied and the raw data from the analyses. Its last chapters put <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>in</b> the context of existing studies, and presented a new theory and model to explain the causes and continuance of the disorder. The environmental aspects the researchers checked drew on existing literature, and multiple judgments were pooled to both compare and mutually cancel differing criteria for diagnosing schizophrenia. The theory in the book was that many genes work together to dispose a person to the disorder under certain environmental pressures. The model provided no specific therapeutic insight, but was useful as a guideline for further study.|$|E

5|$|The {{starting}} {{order is}} {{the order in}} which the pilots will race in each flying session. The starting order for Training is defined by the results of the last year's Red Bull Air Race World Championship standings. The highest ranking pilot starts first. Starting order for new race pilots is determined by a draw. The starting order for Qualifying is defined by the results of the fourth training session. The order is reversed so that the slowest pilot from the fourth training session starts first. The starting order for all sessions on Race Day is determined by <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>in</b> Qualifying. The order is reversed so that the slowest pilot from Qualifying starts first.|$|E
5|$|This is not {{the place}} to pass judgements, but perhaps I may say that, as it seems to me, both the monks and Tischendorf deserve our deepest gratitude, Tischendorf for having alerted the monks to the {{importance}} of the manuscript, and the monks for having undertaken the daunting task of searching through the vast mass of material with such spectacular results, and then doing everything in their power to safeguard the manuscript against further loss. If we accept the statement of Uspensky, that he saw the codex in 1845, the monks must have worked very hard to complete their search and bind up <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>in</b> so short a period.|$|E
