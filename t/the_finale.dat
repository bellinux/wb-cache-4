5|$|<b>The</b> <b>finale</b> is in sonata form. It {{features}} significant {{developments of}} a simple motif, and considerable dialogue between the four parts. <b>The</b> <b>finale</b> also contains {{a high degree of}} chromaticism, a feature that links the four movements of the work. The musicologist W.
