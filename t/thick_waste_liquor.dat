At the same time the <b>waste</b> <b>liquor</b> is divided into two layers: the upper organic solvent layer and the lower aqueous layer to which has moved the bulk of soluble minerals and organic substances from plant raw material (lignin, hemicelluloses, and extractives). The use of potassium and nitrogen compounds in the cooking liquor allows the use of <b>waste</b> <b>liquor</b> in the manufacture of fertilizers. Previously, we have also obtained nanofibrillated cellulose (CNF) from the air-dry-bleached softwood sulfate pulp with the use of mechanochemical treatment [28]. Mechanochemical treatment was performed {{with the use of a}} milling equipment common for pulp and paper industry. In this research, to reduce energy consumption for preparation of nanocellulose, we used organosolv straw pulp (OSP) which was never dried after cooking and bleaching. Never-dried cellulose is better than once-dried samples because the latter are known to irreversibly lose surface accessibility as a result of drying. Using of never-dried cellulose does not require consumption of energy for drying and grinding since dried cellulose fibers lose the ability to swell and percolate due to irreversible cornification. The application of wet cellulose enables better percolation of acid into cellulose fibers.|$|R

40|$|At {{the recent}} time, the {{chemical}} industry mainly relies on fossil fuels such as oil, gas or coal for all their processes. Approximately 97  % of these resources are used for energy production, while only 3  % of all fossil fuels are provided for production of raw materials like benzene, toluene or xylene. Due to the economic growth, especially in emerging countries, the demand for energy and basic chemicals is significantly increasing. However, due to environmental reasons, the extraction of fossil materials {{is becoming more and}} more difficult. Renewable resources are a good alternative, especially as raw materials in {{the chemical industry}}. In the pulp and paper industry, where cellulose is extracted from the wood, lignin and its degradation products accrue as <b>waste.</b> The <b>waste</b> <b>liquors</b> consist of a variety of degradation and condensation products of lignin as well as inorganic compounds. Currently, the lignin degradation products are mainly burned to produce energy but they have also high potential for the usage as raw materials in the chemical industry. Furthermore, for economic and ecological reasons, the inorganic compounds should also be recovered. At this point, improved processes would be needed to produce waste liquorswith a reproducible composition. Also, there is a new process to use wood as renewable resource – the organosolv-process in lignocellulosic bioraffinery. This process uses mictures of alcohol and water to frationate wood into cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin. While cellulose and hemicelluloses can be converted to sugars, applications for lignin are missing. In the first section of this work, different batches of Kraft and Organosolv liquors were characterized and compared. Especially the Kraft liquor shows significant differences from batch to batch in parameters as lignin, inorganic content or in volatile substances. The reasons for the inconstant composition of the <b>waste</b> <b>liquors</b> are that the process chemicals used are not controlled during the reaction and that the end of the reaction is determined only by kappa number. Therefore, a proper process monitoring should be implemented for an integral utilisation of wood in the pulp and paper industry. In the second step, the samples were fractionated by precipitation and extraction to isolate lignin degradation products and to recover other compounds like inorganic substances. For this purpose, various methods have been studied. In the Kraft liquor, lignin products were isolated by acid precipitation and purified by extraction. Furthermore, sulphur could be removed from isolated lignin degradation products. The Organosolv <b>waste</b> <b>liquor</b> contains lignin and hemicelluloses degradation products. The isolation was performed by the addition of water. A gas-chromatographic analysis of the Organosolv <b>waste</b> <b>liquor</b> showed many different compounds of various molecular weights. However, for further usage of the lignin degradation products only a few high-concentrated compounds with similar structures would be needed. A possible method to generate uniform molceluar structures is a thermal treatment. After thermal degradation, the condensed compounds were separated by comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography and identified by mass spectrometry. Different monomers like substituted Guaiacyl- and Sinapyl-structures were determined. The condensed thermolysis products were compared to the compounds of the <b>waste</b> <b>liquor</b> and it is shown that thermolysis results in degradation to mono- and dimeric substances. This means, that there is a great potential to uniform the lignin degradation products by thermolysis and use them as renewable aromatic materials in the chemical industry...|$|R
40|$|Increasing industrial, military, {{and space}} {{requirements}} for certain fission products place emphasis on large-scale methods for their recovery from <b>waste</b> <b>liquors</b> {{produced by the}} fuel recovery processes. With development of organic extractants for separating and recovering these fission products, solvent extraction offers a versatile alternative to ion-exchange, precipitation, and crystallization procedures heretofore used for small-scale recoveries. A process flowsheet was developed for the recovery of strontium and mixed rare earths from adjusted Purex 1 WW solution {{by the use of}} di(2 -ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (D 2 EHPA). After adding tartrate t complex the iron and caustic to adjust the pH to 6, strontium and rare earths are co-extracted and then co-stripped with nitric acid in the first cycle. In additional D 2 EHPA extraction cycles, they are isolated as concentrated fractions. The mixed rare earths from this process can be treated by tributyl phosphate (TBP) extraction to separate the individual rare earth elements of which promethium and cerium are of greatest interest. Zirconium [...] niobium also may be recovered with D 2 EHPA from acidic <b>waste</b> <b>liquors.</b> An amine pretreatment extraction process was developed for removing nitric acid, iron sulfate, zirconium [...] niobium, and ruthenium from waste solutions to furnish a feed liquor more amenable to subsequent processes for recovering fission products. The separate recovery of ruthenium, zirconium [...] niobium, and rare earths may also be possible by amine extraction. A process based on the use of substituted phenols was developed for recovering cesium from alkaline waste solutions. These compounds are selective extractants for cesium, giving high decontamination from other fission products and sodium, and they are readily stripped with dilute nitric acid. Previous studies also outlined methods for recovering neptunium, plutonium, and technetium with solvents similar to those described. When appropriately cornbined, these developments offer a versatile integrated solvent extraction flowsheet for the recovery of all important fission products and other components from <b>waste</b> <b>liquors.</b> (auth...|$|R

Oxytetracycline was concentrated more than 3 times to 3000 - 4000 mg/l in the retentate. Due to likely the high concentration of large biopolymers interacting with OTC molecules, OTC could not be successfully recovered from the RO retentate by conventional crystallization. With additional treatment of ultrafiltration by 3 K membranes, OTC crystallization and recovery from the RO retentate were significantly improved with a recovery ratio of more than 60 % and a purity of higher than 80 %. Detailed studies indicated that most large biopolymers in the OTC liquor were polysaccharides that would either hinder the growth of OTC crystals or precipitate together with OTC molecules. Removal of these large biopolymers by ultrafiltration could improve the condition remarkably for OTC crystallization.

However, their influences on delignification was greater than on pulping reactions. The intermediate density wood sample which had the lowest amount of lignin and the highest amount of sapwood underwent the most delignification and showed the highest yields.

40|$|Organic {{matters in}} <b>waste</b> <b>liquor</b> are oxidatively {{decomposed}} by microorganisms and non-biological chemical reactions. It {{is necessary to}} determine the oxygen demanded for the oxidative decomposition. As one method for measuring chemical oxygen demand (COD), permanganate oxidation is mainly used in Japan, and the procedure is authorized as Japan Industrial Standard (JIS). We tested utilities of the method using soluble starch, egg white albumin, lignosulfonate solution and their mixtures with metal sulfate as model of <b>waste</b> <b>liquor.</b> COD of these macromolecules were variously changed {{by the addition of}} metal ions. Above all, COD of soluble starch solution was remarkably diminished by divalent ions, such as Cu^ 2 + and Mg^ 2 +, trivalent ion Fe^ 3 + and monovalent K^+. The extent diminished was about 40 % in each mixture. Such conspicuous diminution of COD was not found in albumin-or LSA-metal ion mixture. COD of LSA-Cu^ 2 + mixture augmented more than that of LSA solution by a factor of 1. 1. In the mixture containing two sorts of macromolecules, COD also diminished by the addition of metal ions. These experimental results show that COD of the macromolecule solution measured can resist against permanganate oxidation. As this poorly-oxidizable complex was not conformed irreversibly, COD of the starch-metal mixture, above all, gradually increased as time passed. These experimental results show that COD of the macromelecule solution measured by permanganate consumption (JIS method) changes and always diminishes remarkably by the co-existence with other macromolecule and metal ion. Then, it may be concluded that JIS method can not be successfully adopted as a general one to analyze many kinds of <b>waste</b> <b>liquor</b> which varies the sorts and the content of organic and inorganic matter. The incompleteness of the method is due to the weak oxidative potentiality of permanganate reagent. Development of rapid COD analytical methods using more stronger oxidizing agent such as dichromate are claimed. Measurement of TOC (total organic carbon) is more favorable as the more strict indicator of water-pollution control, though the analytical procedure is yet unsettled. 各種排水中の有機物は微生物によつてあるいは非生物的に酸化分解されるので,その汚染度を規定するためには酸化分解に要する酸素量を測定する必要がある. この化学的酸素要求量(COD) を測定する方法としては,わが国では過マンガン酸酸化によるものが主に用いられており,本法は日本工業規格(JIS) に表示されている. 排水のモデルとして,可溶性でんぷん,卵白アルブミン,LSA溶液およびそれらの金属硫酸塩との混液を用いて本法の有効性を検定した. これらの高分子物質のCODは金属イオンの添加によつて変化し,その程度は高分子物質と金属イオンの組み合せによつて異なつていた. 特に可溶性でんぶん溶液のCODはCu^ 2 ＋,Mg^ 2 ＋などの二価イオン,さらにFe^ 3 ＋およびK^+によつて著しく減少した. しかしアルブミン－,LSA－金属塩混液では顕著なCODの減少は認められなかつた.

Organic impurities separated from actual OTC fermentation <b>waste</b> <b>liquor</b> by ultrafiltration were dosed into a pure OTC solution at various concentrations. The results demonstrated that small organic molecules with an apparent molecular weight (AMW) of below 10, 000 Da did not affect OTC crystallization significantly. However, large biopolymers, especially poly saccharides, in the fermentation waste caused severe retardation {{of crystal growth and}} considerable deterioration in the purity of the OTC crystallized. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) revealed that OTC nuclei formed in the solution attached to the surfaces of large organic molecules, probably polysaccharides, instead of being surrounded by proteins as previously thought. It is proposed that the attachment of OTC nuclei to biopolymers would prevent OTC from rapid crystallization, resulting in a high OTC residue in the aqueous phase. In addition, the adsorption of OTC clusters onto biopolymers would destabilize the colloidal system of organic macromolecules and promote particle flocculation. OTC crystallization would therefore take place with the precipitation of abundant organic impurities. Hence, the removal of polysaccharides and other biopolymers by ultrafiltration can be an effective means of improving the recovery of OTC and similar antibiotics by crystallization from the fermentation waste.

The combinations of levels of these five independent variables were chosen according to an incomplete block design, which allowed a maximum amount of statistical information to be obtained from only 30 individual cooks. Pulping properties studied were pulp yield, total solids of the <b>waste</b> <b>liquor,</b> pH of the <b>waste</b> <b>liquor,</b> the hypo number test of the pulp, and such pulp strength properties as Concora crush strength, tensile, burst, tear, and stiffness.

Cooking temperature, bark content, and chip size have less significant effects on pulp yields and pulp strength properties. Green liquor pulps have distinctly darker colors than neutral sulfite pulps from the same wood species, and the former pulp forms denser sheets than the latter. Generally speaking, green liquor semi-chemical Douglas-fir pulps are equivalent to or slightly lower in quality than other commercial semi-chemical pulps in Concora strength, but equal or slightly superior to them in tensile and bursting strengths. The deficiency in Concora strength can be overcome with increased refining, and the slightly higher pulp yield and elimination of the causticizing step make the green liquor semi-chemical process more attractive for corrugating medium...|$|R

The method used for selecting distillation procedure were simple distillation, distillation design A, B, C, D, E, F and F-m as mentioned in the procedure. The pH of substrate used were 14, 12, 10, and 9 while for absorbents were 1, 3, 5 and 7. Distillation time used varied from 3. 15; 5. 15; and 7. 15. The result shows that the highest phenol recovery {{was obtained from the}} design F-m yielding 75. 3 % phenol recovery during 5 hours 15 minutes distillation time, using substrate having pH of 14 and absorbent pH of 3. Applying such method on sulphite black liqour, gave 56. 3 % phenol recovery...|$|R
30|$|The {{practical}} {{utility of}} fabricated PANI-NCC for Cr(III) and Cr(VI) remediation was evaluated from chrome tannery leather effluent sample. At {{the time of}} collection, the chrome <b>waste</b> <b>liquor</b> was green with 6.5 pH. It {{is due to the}} presence of basic chromium sulfate, which is used in leather tanning. Prior to sorption, it is essential to devastate the organic moieties present in the effluent, and this was maintained by sulfuric acid–nitric acid amalgam. Sorption performance of PANI-NCC was tested at experimentally optimized conditions. Interestingly, we found that sorption latent of chromium in the same order as with those obtained in competitive environment. These results indicate that fabricated PANI-NCC can be used for effective removal of Cr(III) and Cr(VI) without interfering the influence of other heavy metal ions from industrial effluent and waste water.|$|R

Wastewater from the {{pulp and paper industry}} is an unutilized resource offering the potential to recover valuable products such as lignin, pigments, and water [1]. The recovery of lignin is particularly important because it has many applications, and membrane technology has been investigated as the basis of innovative recovery solutions. The concentration of lignin can be increased from 62 to 285 g. L- 1 using membranes and the recovered lignin is extremely pure. Membrane technology is also scalable and adaptable to different <b>waste</b> <b>liquors</b> from the pulp and paper industry...|$|R
40|$|In the {{treatment}} of carnotite concentrates, sodium diuranate was prepared by acidifying tricarbonate liquors to eliminate carbon dioxide, and then precipitating the sodium salt {{by the addition of}} caustic. Direct precipitation of uranium by the addition of caustic to tricarbonate liquors was used when pitchblende ores were processed, because this procedure was more effective in giving a product with a low molybdenum content. Tests of this method in the laboratory and Pilot Plant indicated that low uranium losses (0. 2 to 0. 3 %) would be encountered with typical liquors if 1. 7 to 2. 0 lbs of caustic were added for every pound of uranosic oxide in solution. Since losses as high as 3 % were incurred in plant operations, further work was undertaken, in an effort to reduce the uranium concentration in the <b>waste</b> <b>liquors...</b>|$|R

40|$|It was {{discovered}} that a green alga strain had the capacity of producing up to 5 g/l high viscosity biopolymers from lactose under mixotrophic cultivation conditions. The molecular weight of the polymer {{was determined to be}} around 505, 000 daltons. The polymers were shown to have similar rheological characteristics as xanthan gum, a commercial bacterial polysaccharides, which has found numerous applications in a large variety of different fields. The ability of this strain to utilize lactose for biopolymer production promises the potential of valuable biopolymer production from cheese whey, a <b>waste</b> <b>liquor</b> stream of the cheese industry that contains approximately 50 g/ 1 lactose. Using Plackett-Burnman experiment design and statistical analysis, it was determined that the major parameters affecting biopolymer production were the concentrations of sodium nitrate and lactose and temperature as well.

40|$|Black liquor is {{generated}} in Kraft pulping of wood or non-wood raw material in pulp mills, and {{regarded as a}} renewable resource. The objective {{of this paper was}} to develop an effective means to remove the water pollutants by recovery of both lignin and sodium hydroxide from black liquor, based on electrolysis. The treatment of a 1000 mL of black liquor (122 g/L solid contents) consumed 345. 6 kJ of electric energy, and led to the generation of 30. 7 g of sodium hydroxide, 0. 82 g of hydrogen gas and 52. 1 g of biomass solids. Therefore, the recovery ratios of elemental sodium and biomass solids are 80. 4 % and 76 %, respectively. Treating black liquor by electrolysis is an environmentally friendly technology that can, in particular, be an alternative process in addressing the environmental issues of pulping <b>waste</b> <b>liquor</b> to the small-scale mills without black liquor recovery...|$|R
40|$|Saccharification {{of various}} kinds of {{cellulose}} materials, including woods and barks of mulberry tree, cotton plant, bog-moss in the tundra of Saghalien, rice and barley straws, rice hulls etc., was carried by dilute sulphuric acid under pressure with an apparatus of Scholler's type which was planned by the author. It was found that saccharification of cellulose materials, especially of bog-moss is well achieved, if they are removed of humic acid beforehand with diluted ammonia and hydrolysed fractionally. Among various strains of yeasts, a kind of distilley yeast suitable for fermentation of saccharified solution was selected, and no inhibitting substance to the yeast was detected, though 0. 82 g of furfurol, 0. 021 g of hydroxymethylfurfurol and 3. 25 g of volatile acids were produced by decomposition of 100 g of mulberry tree in the saccharified solutions. Sugars in the solutions were investigated by the method of paper chromatograph {{and the presence of}} glucose, mannose, arabinose and xylose was verified. Thus, in decomposing 100 g of bog-moss by dilute acid at 130 ℃ and 150 ℃, about 30 g of sugars was obtained and then about 9 g of alcohol was produced by fermentation of saccharified solution. About 33 g of sugar and then about 10 g of alcohol were obtained by decomposition of 100 g of mulberry tree with dilute acid at 180 ℃. Production of yeast from the saccharified solutions was investigated, especially pentose-assimilable yeasts (isolated by the author and named Torulopsis xylinus). In saccharified solutions from 100 g of bog-moss or mulberry tree, about 9. 5 g or 8. 9 g of yeast was produced respectively. In order to know the availability of constituents of the spent wash, distilly <b>waste</b> <b>liquor</b> of the alcohol solution obtained from the saccharified solution of mulberry tree, experiments were carried out. During 120 hours ordinary culture, 1 / 3 parts of reducing sugars, including more than 2 / 3 parts of pentose, were consumed. It was pointed out that small amount of organic matters other than sugars was assimilated. No remarkable multiplication of yeasts took place with sulphite pulp <b>waste</b> <b>liquor</b> from which most of SO_ 2 was expelled by aeration and the remaining SO_ 2 was precipitated by adding calcium hydroxide to pH to 5. 6 by sulphuric acid, while noticeable crop yields of the yeasts were obtained. The chemical compositions of Torulopsis xylinus (7 - 9 % of ash, 43 - 47 % of crude protein and 0. 69 mg% of vitamin B_ 1) thus obtained were found to be very much the same with Torula utilis obtained from spent washes or pulp <b>waste</b> <b>liquors.</b> Production of fat with the saccharified solution of mulberry tree was carried out by the yeast (isolated by the author and named Rhodotorula mucilaginosa var.). It was found that at the first stage of fermentation (72 hours incubation) the immediate yeast population was larger in xylose or saccharified solutions as sources of carbon than in other sugars and at the second stage of fermentation (subsequent 24 hours incubation and the stage of fat production from glucose added) fat yield was also greater in the former. The fat-coefficient was more than twenty and the characteristic of fat looked like coconut...|$|R
