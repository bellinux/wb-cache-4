25|$|An opening batsman, Hathurusingha {{was most}} often {{one of the}} opening batsmen {{alongside}} Roshan Mahanama.

Hathurusingha started his career by piecing together a trio of half-centuries in his first three matches. After a long layoff from the side when other players took over in the opening batsman position, and the subsequent discovery of Sanath Jayasuriya in just that position, Hathurusingha began to play once again, but this time as a strong middle-order batsman and medium-pace bowler. This was not to prove overly effective, though, and when Hathurusingha was not called upon {{to play in the}} Cricket World Cup in 1999, this brought about an end to his international career.

25|$|These earlier Greek {{ideas of}} numbers were later upended by the {{discovery}} of the irrationality of the square root of two. Hippasus, a disciple of Pythagoras, showed that the diagonal of a unit square was incommensurable with its (unit-length) edge: in other words he proved there was no existing (rational) number that accurately depicts the proportion of the diagonal of the unit square to its edge. This caused a significant re-evaluation of Greek philosophy of mathematics. According to legend, fellow Pythagoreans were so traumatized by this discovery that they murdered Hippasus <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>him</b> <b>from</b> spreading his heretical idea. Simon Stevin {{was one of the first}} in Europe to challenge Greek ideas in the 16thcentury. Beginning with Leibniz, the focus shifted strongly to the relationship between mathematics and logic. This perspective dominated the philosophy of mathematics through the time of Frege and of Russell, but was brought into question by developments in the late 19th and early 20thcenturies.|$|E
