5|$|Painted turtles defend <b>themselves</b> by kicking, scratching, biting, or urinating. In {{contrast}} to land tortoises, painted turtles can right <b>themselves</b> {{if they are}} flipped upside down.|$|E
5|$|Securely {{attached}} adults tend to {{have positive}} views of <b>themselves,</b> their partners and their relationships. They feel comfortable with intimacy and independence, balancing the two. Anxious-preoccupied adults seek high levels of intimacy, approval and responsiveness from partners, becoming overly dependent. They {{tend to be less}} trusting, have less positive views about <b>themselves</b> and their partners, and may exhibit high levels of emotional expressiveness, worry and impulsiveness in their relationships. Dismissive-avoidant adults desire a high level of independence, often appearing to avoid attachment altogether. They view <b>themselves</b> as self-sufficient, invulnerable to attachment feelings and not needing close relationships. They tend to suppress their feelings, dealing with rejection by distancing <b>themselves</b> from partners of whom they often have a poor opinion. Fearful-avoidant adults have mixed feelings about close relationships, both desiring and feeling uncomfortable with emotional closeness. They tend to mistrust their partners and view <b>themselves</b> as unworthy. Like dismissive-avoidant adults, fearful-avoidant adults tend to seek less intimacy, suppressing their feelings.|$|E
5|$|The maps below (taken from 2013 census data) {{show the}} {{percentages}} of people in each census area unit identifying <b>themselves</b> as European, Māori, Asian, or Pacific Islander (as defined by Statistics New Zealand). As people could identify <b>themselves</b> with multiple groups, percentages are not cumulative.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} of Royal Tunbridge Wells is predominantly White and British in its ethnic origin and Christian in its religious affiliation: 97.5% of {{residents of the}} district described <b>themselves</b> as white in the 2001 census, and 75.0% identified <b>themselves</b> as being Christian.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} persons who {{associated}} <b>themselves</b> with Europeans and proved <b>themselves</b> useful to white people achieved positions in the native society through fraud and extortion. But the Europeans, having noticed it, stopped it. They could discern natives of the noble class by their loyalty and honesty.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} veteran support {{organizations}} and private companies devote <b>themselves</b> to exposing those who falsely {{claim to have}} received the Medal of Honor.|$|E
5|$|According to a 2014 {{study by}} the Pew Research Center, the largest {{religious}} groupings are Christians (52%), followed by those of no religion (37%), Hindus (2%), Buddhists (2%), Jews (1%), Muslims (1%) {{and a variety of}} other religions have smaller followings. According same {{study by the}} Pew Research Center, about 34% of Seattleites are Protestant, and 15% professing Roman Catholic beliefs. Meanwhile, 6% of the residents in Seattle call <b>themselves</b> agnostics, while 10% call <b>themselves</b> atheists.|$|E

5|$|After initial {{reports of}} {{suspicious}} contributions, prominent Democrats defended Hsu's reputation. Supporters began to distance <b>themselves</b> after his long-time fugitive status was revealed.|$|E
5|$|Always {{seeking to}} engage {{individuals}} {{both physically and}} mentally, the program uses the hurdle method. The hurdle method teaches individuals how to nimbly respond situation for which they have not specifically prepared <b>themselves.</b> The manager of learning prepared and present unexpected tasks or challenges to the leader and the group which they must organize <b>themselves</b> {{to find a solution}} or to complete a task. The hurdle method is closely linked to hands-on learning.|$|E

5|$|As at May 2013, 45% of ACT {{residents}} (25–64) had a {{level of}} educational attainment equal to at least a bachelor's degree, significantly higher that {{the national average of}} 29%. On census night in 2016, approximately 50.0% of ACT residents described <b>themselves</b> as Christian (excludong not stated responses), the most common denominations being Catholic and Anglican; 36.2% described <b>themselves</b> as having no religion.|$|E
5|$|As of 2003, {{those who}} join the U.S. Armed Forces are not {{required}} to identify <b>themselves</b> as Hispanics, therefore a person of Hispanic descent who decides that he or she {{does not want to be}} considered as a Hispanic and chooses to identify <b>themselves</b> with any race was not be included in the statistics of the Department of Defense as Hispanics.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} Household Cavalry, the {{officers}} of the Royals and Inniskillings found {{it very difficult to}} rein back their troops, who lost all cohesion. Having taken casualties, and still trying to reorder <b>themselves,</b> the Scots Greys {{and the rest of the}} Union Brigade found <b>themselves</b> before the main French lines. Their horses were blown, and they were still in disorder without any idea of what their next collective objective was. Some attacked nearby gun batteries of the Grande Battery.|$|E
5|$|Bats may avoid flying {{during the}} day to prevent {{overheating}} in the sun, since their dark wing-membranes absorb solar radiation. Bats {{may not be able}} to dissipate heat if the ambient temperature is too high. Unlike birds which have air sacs or other mammals which have sweat glands, bats have no means to cool <b>themselves</b> by evaporation, though they may use saliva to cool <b>themselves</b> in an emergency.|$|E
5|$|Bees are <b>themselves</b> Müllerian mimics {{of other}} aposematic insects {{with the same}} colour scheme, {{including}} wasps, lycid and other beetles, and many butterflies and moths (Lepidoptera) which are <b>themselves</b> distasteful, often through acquiring bitter and poisonous chemicals from their plant food. All the Müllerian mimics, including bees, benefit from the reduced risk of predation that results from their easily recognised warning coloration.|$|E
5|$|Beginning at the post–World War I 1920 Summer Olympics, the {{lighting}} of the Olympic Flame {{was followed by}} the release of doves, symbolizing peace. (Experienced athletes brought newspapers to cover <b>themselves</b> because of the birds' droppings.) The release was discontinued after several doves perched <b>themselves</b> at the cauldron's rim and were burned alive in the Olympic Flame during the opening ceremony of the 1988 Summer Olympics. It was later replaced with a symbolic release of doves after the flame has been lit.|$|E
5|$|Butterflies protect <b>themselves</b> {{from predators}} {{by a variety}} of means.|$|E
5|$|Disk-shaped LC {{molecules}} can orient <b>themselves</b> in a layer-like fashion {{known as}} the discotic nematic phase. If the disks pack into stacks, the phase is called a discotic columnar. The columns <b>themselves</b> may be organized into rectangular or hexagonal arrays. Chiral discotic phases, similar to the chiral nematic phase, are also known.|$|E
5|$|Even {{in terms}} of fan base, the two fan bases are close in a way. Although the general public has held a {{stereotype}} of heavy metal fans being suicidal, depressed and a danger to <b>themselves</b> and society in general. However, Adrian North, a Heriot-Watt University professor who studies genre listeners found that metal listeners were above all else creative, at ease with <b>themselves</b> and introverted — qualities he also found in classical listeners.|$|E

5|$|Farms with apple {{orchards}} may {{open them}} to the public, so consumers may <b>themselves</b> pick the apples they will purchase.|$|E
5|$|Fordyce spots, or Fordyce granules, are ectopic sebaceous glands {{found on}} the {{genitals}} and oral mucosa. They show <b>themselves</b> as yellowish-white milia (milk spots).|$|E
5|$|Fully aquatic mammals, the {{cetaceans}} and sirenians, {{have lost}} their legs and have a tail fin to propel <b>themselves</b> through the water. Flipper movement is continuous. Whales swim by moving their tail fin and lower body up and down, propelling <b>themselves</b> through vertical movement, while their flippers are mainly used for steering. Their skeletal anatomy allows them to be fast swimmers. Most species have a dorsal fin to prevent <b>themselves</b> from turning upside-down in the water. The flukes of sirenians are raised {{up and down in}} long strokes to move the animal forward, and can be twisted to turn. The forelimbs are paddle-like flippers which aid in turning and slowing.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, while patriarchal {{marriages are}} one of the great wrongs perpetrated upon women, Wollstonecraft argues that a greater wrong is women's lack of independence. Because they are unable to find respectable, well-paid work, they are reliant upon men. Women such as Jemima are reduced to hard {{physical}} labor, stealing, begging, or prostituting <b>themselves</b> in order to survive; they are demeaned by this work and think meanly of <b>themselves</b> because of it.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the wide}} range of {{countries}} the characters find <b>themselves</b> in throughout the story, a number of recurring characters arise from countries outside of Korea.|$|E
5|$|In 1831 {{the town}} {{population}} was 1,310, and in 1801 just 138. In 2001, the town comprised 34,441 households, while in 1829 it comprised just 250. The vast majority (96.5%) {{of the population}} described <b>themselves</b> as white in the 2011 census. 58.2% are Christian, with 32.4% describing <b>themselves</b> as having no religion. No other religious groups achieved as much as 0.5%.|$|E
5|$|In {{communal}} defence, prey groups actively defend <b>themselves</b> by grouping together, {{and sometimes}} by attacking or mobbing a predator, rather than allowing <b>themselves</b> to be passive victims of predation. Mobbing is the harassing of a predator by many prey animals. Mobbing is usually done {{to protect the}} young in social colonies. For example, red colobus monkeys exhibit mobbing when threatened by chimpanzees, a common predator. The male red colobus monkeys group together and place <b>themselves</b> between predators and the group's females and juveniles. The males jump together and actively bite the chimpanzees. Fieldfares are birds which may nest either solitarily or in colonies. Within colonies, fieldfares mob and defecate on approaching predators, shown experimentally to reduce predation levels.|$|E
5|$|In the 2001 census Keynsham had a {{population}} of 15,533, in 6,545 households, of which 6,480 described <b>themselves</b> as White. Keynsham East Ward had {{a population}} of 5,479, Keynsham North 5,035 and Keynsham South 5,019. In each of the wards between 75 and 80% of the population described <b>themselves</b> as Christians, and around 15% {{said that they had}} no religion.|$|E
5|$|It {{soon became}} {{evident that the}} Dominicans needed to {{reestablish}} <b>themselves</b> in Ciudad Real, and the hostilities with the colonists were calmed. In 1547, while de las Casas was in Spain, Francisco Marroquín, bishop of Guatemala, placed the first stone for the new Dominican convent in Ciudad Real. The Dominicans dedicated <b>themselves</b> to destroying indigenous temples and idols, and preached sermons with destructive imagery, such as from the Book of Revelation, that were more familiar to the Mesoamerican worldview. Saints were associated with animals, {{in much the same}} way as the Indians identified <b>themselves</b> with nahual spirit-forms. Different Mesoamerican otherworlds were tied to Christian concepts, where the Mictlan world of the dead became Hell, Ihuicatl became Heaven, and Tlalocan became Paradise.|$|E
