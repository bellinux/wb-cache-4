5|$|In COPD, it {{may take}} longer <b>to</b> <b>breathe</b> out than <b>to</b> <b>breathe</b> in. Chest {{tightness}} may occur but is not common and {{may be caused by}} another problem. Those with obstructed airflow may have wheezing or decreased sounds with air entry on examination of the chest with a stethoscope. A barrel chest is a characteristic sign of COPD, but is relatively uncommon. Tripod positioning may occur as the disease worsens.|$|E
5|$|All sharks {{need to keep}} {{water flowing}} over their gills {{in order for them}} <b>to</b> <b>breathe,</b> however not all species need to be moving to do this. Those that are able <b>to</b> <b>breathe</b> while not {{swimming}} do so by using their spiracles to force water over their gills, thereby allowing them to extract oxygen from the water. It has been recorded that their eyes remain open while in this state and actively follow the movements of divers swimming around them and as such they are not truly asleep.|$|E

5|$|A typical fish is ectothermic, has a {{streamlined}} body for rapid swimming, extracts oxygen from water using gills or uses an accessory breathing organ <b>to</b> <b>breathe</b> atmospheric oxygen, has {{two sets of}} paired fins, usually one or two (rarely three) dorsal fins, an anal fin, and a tail fin, has jaws, has skin that is usually covered with scales, and lays eggs.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of cervical injuries include low heart rate, low blood pressure, problems regulating body temperature, and breathing dysfunction. If the injury is high enough in the neck to impair the muscles involved in breathing, the person may not be able <b>to</b> <b>breathe</b> without the help of an endotracheal tube and mechanical ventilator.|$|E

5|$|Although Coming Up <b>to</b> <b>Breathe</b> {{possesses}} {{an overall}} heavier tone than MercyMe's previous albums, {{it has been}} described as an extension or a shift in presentation rather than a total departure. The sound of the album {{has been described as}} epitomizing the genre of modern rock. Guitars and guitar solos are more prominent on the album.|$|E
5|$|Narrowing of the airways occurs due to {{inflammation}} and scarring within them. This {{contributes to the}} inability <b>to</b> <b>breathe</b> out fully. The greatest reduction in air flow occurs when breathing out, as the pressure in the chest is compressing the airways at this time. This can result in more air from the previous breath remaining within the lungs when the next breath is started, resulting {{in an increase in}} the total volume of air in the lungs at any given time, a process called hyperinflation or air trapping. Hyperinflation from exercise is linked to shortness of breath in COPD, as it is less comfortable <b>to</b> <b>breathe</b> in when the lungs are already partly full. Hyperinflation may also worsen during an exacerbation.|$|E
5|$|Open {{water is}} {{unrestricted}} water {{such as a}} sea, lake or flooded quarry, where the diver has direct vertical access {{to the surface of}} the water in contact with the atmosphere. Open water diving implies that if a problem arises, the diver can directly ascend vertically to the atmosphere <b>to</b> <b>breathe</b> air.|$|E

5|$|Since the 1970s {{there have}} been various {{initiatives}} to attempt to regenerate Coatbridge. Urban Aid grants, European Union grants and, more recently, Social Inclusion Partnership's have attempted <b>to</b> <b>breathe</b> new life into Coatbridge.

5|$|The {{coconut crab}} is {{terrestrial}} and uses structures called branchiostegal lungs <b>to</b> <b>breathe</b> air. They cannot swim and would drown in water, yet they possess a rudimentary set of gills. They can breathe {{on land and}} hold their breath underwater. The branchiostegal lungs {{are seen as a}} developmental adaptive stage from water-living to enable land-living, or from fish to amphibian.|$|E
5|$|The first fully {{terrestrial}} vertebrates were amniotes. Like their amphibious tetrapod predecessors, {{they had}} lungs and limbs. Amniotic eggs, however, have internal membranes {{that allow the}} developing embryo <b>to</b> <b>breathe</b> but keep water in. Hence, amniotes can lay eggs on dry land, while amphibians generally need to lay their eggs in water.|$|E
40|$|We {{have studied}} {{arterial}} PO 2, PCO 2, and hydrogen ion and electroencephalogram during sleep in 10 patients with stable severe chronic respiratory failure. As a group the patients slept badly. Sleep {{was associated with}} a worsening of hypoxia and no significant change in PCO 2 and H+. Two patients were restudied, receiving oxygen therapy overnight. Both had improved sleep but one, who had an intact hypoxic drive <b>to</b> <b>breathing,</b> developed marked hypercapnia and acidosis when his PO 2 was restored to normal during sleep; the other, who had no hypoxic drive <b>to</b> <b>breathing,</b> developed no more hypercapnia or acidosis during sleep when breathing oxygen than when breathing air. Oxygen therapy may improve sleep disturbance in these patients, but its effect on the drive <b>to</b> <b>breathing</b> during sleep should be considered if severe hypercapnia and acidosis are to be avoided...|$|R

5|$|A {{quarter of}} all people with Guillain–Barré {{syndrome}} develop weakness of the breathing muscles leading to respiratory failure, the inability <b>to</b> <b>breathe</b> adequately to maintain healthy levels of oxygen and/or {{carbon dioxide in the}} blood. This life-threatening scenario is complicated by other medical problems such as pneumonia, severe infections, blood clots in the lungs and bleeding in the digestive tract in 60% of those who require artificial ventilation.|$|E
5|$|All have paddle-like {{tails and}} many have {{laterally}} compressed bodies that give them an eel-like appearance. Unlike fish, {{they do not have}} gills and must surface regularly <b>to</b> <b>breathe.</b> Along with whales, they are among the most completely aquatic of all air-breathing vertebrates. Among this group are species {{with some of the most}} potent venoms of all snakes. Some have gentle dispositions and bite only when provoked, but others are much more aggressive. Currently, 17genera are described as sea snakes, comprising 62 species.|$|E

5|$|Breath-hold diving by an {{air-breathing}} {{animal is}} limited to the physiological capacity to perform the dive on the oxygen available until it returns to a source of fresh breathing gas, usually the air at the surface. As this internal oxygen supply reduces, the animal experiences an increasing urge <b>to</b> <b>breathe</b> caused by buildup of carbon dioxide and lactate in the blood, followed by loss of consciousness due to central nervous system hypoxia. If this occurs underwater, it will drown.|$|E
5|$|COPD {{is a type}} of obstructive {{lung disease}} in which chronic incompletely {{reversible}} poor airflow (airflow limitation) and inability <b>to</b> <b>breathe</b> out fully (air trapping) exist. The poor airflow is the result of breakdown of lung tissue (known as emphysema) and small airways disease (known as obstructive bronchiolitis). The relative contributions of these two factors vary between people. Severe destruction of small airways can lead to the formation of large air pockets—known as bullae—that replace lung tissue. This form of disease is called bullous emphysema.|$|E
5|$|Deinosuchus had a {{secondary}} bony palate, {{which would have}} permitted it <b>to</b> <b>breathe</b> through its nostrils {{while the rest of}} the head remained submerged underwater. The vertebrae were articulated in a procoelous manner, meaning they had a concave hollow on the front end and a convex bulge on the rear; these would have fit together to produce a ball and socket joint. The secondary palate and procoelous vertebrae are advanced features also found in modern eusuchian crocodilians.|$|E
