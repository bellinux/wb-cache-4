The Tramp relates the girl's plight and the millionaire gives him money for her operation. Two burglars knock the millionaire out and <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> his money. The burglars flee {{before the arrival of}} the police, who find the Tramp with the money the millionaire gave him, but because of the knock on his head the millionaire does not remember giving it. The Tramp evades the police long enough to get the money to the girl, telling her he will be going away for a time, but in due course he is apprehended and imprisoned.|$|E
5|$|During a lunchtime tryst in Phoenix, Arizona, a {{real estate}} {{secretary}} named Marion Crane discusses with her boyfriend, Sam Loomis, how they cannot afford to get married because of Sam's debts. After lunch, Marion returns to work, where a client drops off a $40,000 cash payment on a property. Her boss asks her to deposit {{the money in the}} bank, and she asks if she can <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the afternoon off. Returning home, she begins to pack, deciding to steal the money and give it to Sam in Fairvale, California. She is seen by her boss on her way out of town, which makes her nervous. During the trip, she pulls over {{on the side of the}} road and falls asleep, only to be awakened by a state patrol officer. Suspicious about her nervous behavior, he notes her license plate number and follows her at a close distance. Hoping to shake his pursuit, Marion stops at an automobile dealership and trades in her Ford Mainline, with its Arizona license plates, for a Ford Custom 300 that has California tags.|$|E

25|$|The {{conflict}} in the City of Compostela reached its zenith in September 1320, when after forty years of autonomy and two years of war, the new archbishop, the French Bérenger de Landore, assassinated the nobleman Alonso Suárez de Deza together {{with the members of}} the City Council in his castle of A Rocha Forte near Santiago, where he had attracted them for talks. While Berenger's forcefulness temporarily pacified the city, he still had to fight for another year just to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the fiefdom. However, twenty-five years later, the City Council of Compostela obtained the long-sought reguengo status, granted by King Alfonso XI. Similar conflicts are also known in other Galician cities.|$|E

According to a source, Luetgert had financial difficulties so he started courting a rich widow whom he planned to marry once he got rid of his wife. The police continued their investigation and discovered that on the night of May 1, 1897, the night Louisa disappeared, she was seen entering the factory with her husband at 10:30pm. A watchman from the sausage plant confirmed the story, saying that Mr. Luetgert gave him an errand to run and told him that he could <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the night off.|$|E
25|$|If {{it is so}} {{difficult}} to define terms such as 'psychology' with such precision, why bother?

After all, if theoretical or empirical work improves our understanding of some aspect of the world or our fellow people, or improves our ability to help people enhance their physical or emotional well being, {{what difference does it make}} whether this work is considered a part of psychology, of cognitive science, of behavioral neuroscience, of public health, or what have you?

25|$|How {{can this}} be {{rational}} for both investors? The {{answer lies in the}} fact that the investors do not have to invest the full 100,000 US dollars. Max Return is content to invest only 10,000 US dollars for now. After all, Max Return may rationalize the outcome by thinking that maybe tomorrow there will be new opportunities available to invest the remaining 90,000 US dollars the bank is willing to lend Max Return, at even higher IRRs. Even if only seven more projects come along which are identical to Small-Is-Beautiful, Max Return would be able to match the NPV of Big-Is-Best, on a total investment of only 80,000 US dollars, with 20,000 US dollars left in the budget to spare for truly unmissable opportunities. Max Value is also happy, because she has filled her capital budget straight away, and decides she can <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the year off investing.|$|E
500|$|Although Noel rejoined Oasis a {{few weeks}} later, the band's {{management}} and handlers were worried. With an album's worth of songs already demoed, the general feeling among the Gallaghers was that they should record as soon as possible. Their manager, Marcus Russell, said in 2007 that [...] "in retrospect, we went in the studio too quickly. The smart move {{would have been to}} <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the year off. But at the time it seemed like the right thing to do. If you're a band and you've got a dozen songs you think are great, why not go and do it." [...] Morris expressed opposite sentiments, arguing that [...] "It was a mistake on everyone's part, management very much included, that we didn’t record Be Here Now in the summer of 1996. It would have been a much different album: happy probably." [...] He described the Mustique demos as [...] "the last good recordings I did with Noel" [...] and had a good rapport with Gallagher before Knebworth, regarding the concert as having changed things for the worse.|$|E

As Bobby blesses a waterline running to the sprinklers of the family's home, Sam and Dean dispatch some of the demons who have taken over the neighborhood. Ruby appears and angrily confronts them, but is stopped short by an oncoming horde of demons. The three of them run into the house as Bobby activates the sprinklers, creating a barrier of holy water. While Dean takes the girl's father to safety in the basement, Sam and Ruby go upstairs and split up in search of Lilith. Sam finds the possessed girl in her bedroom, and although initially hesitant he prepares to strike until he is stopped by Dean, who reveals that Lilith has left her. As midnight approaches, they <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the family into the basement.|$|E

[...] He checked into a six-week treatment program at the Menninger Clinic in Topeka, Kansas, and kicked his habit. [...] "For any number of reasons, the first three weeks were 'hell on earth,' Richard says, 'but after that, things really started to change, and of course, all for the better.'

2500|$|The {{first major}} {{test of the}} Mandinka war machine was the war against Soumaoro Kante and his Sosso kingdom. Mari Djata {{utilized}} the infantry resources of his allies within and outside of Manden proper to best the Sosso in several confrontations, culminating in the Battle of Krina circa 1235. Oral historians recount the use of poison bowmen from the south in Do (along {{what is now the}} Sankarani River), fire archers from Wagadou to the north, and heavy cavalry from the northern state of Mema. [...] These elements were then complemented by Mandinka [...] "smiths", clans which specialized in the production and use of iron weapons such as spears and swords. After Djata’s victory at Kirina, the Mandekalu forces quickly moved on to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the Sosso areas left leaderless upon Soumaoro’s disappearance. [...] If the chronicles of the djeli are to be taken seriously (and many modern historians do), this involved a series of sieges against fortified towns throughout the northern half of Manden proper.|$|E
2500|$|Some of {{the ideas}} of the {{movement}} were anticipated by A.W.N. Pugin (1812–1852), a leader in the Gothic revival in architecture. For example, he, like the Arts and Crafts artists, advocated truth to material, structure and function. Pugin articulated the tendency of social critics to compare the faults of modern society (such as the sprawling growth of cities and the treatment of the poor) unfavorably with the Middle Ages, a tendency that became routine with Ruskin, Morris and the Arts and Crafts movement. His book Contrasts (1836) drew examples of bad modern buildings and town planning in contrast with good medieval examples, and his biographer Rosemary Hill notes that in it he [...] "reached conclusions, almost in passing, about the importance of craftsmaship and tradition in architecture that it would <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the century and the combined efforts of Ruskin and Morris to work out in detail." [...] She describes the spare furnishings he specified for a building in 1841 - [...] "rush chairs, oak tables" [...] - as [...] "the Arts and Crafts interior in embryo." ...|$|E
2500|$|German {{preparations}} {{to resume}} the attack on 24 August were complete by [...] and the super-heavy artillery resumed the bombardment of forts Emine and Suarlée.

Fort Maizeret had fallen the day before to the 22nd Division and Gallwitz ordered the 38th Division to advance into the broken country to the south-west of Namur, to attack forts Malonne and St. Héribert. The 3rd Guard Division was to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> {{the town and the}} 1st Guard Reserve Division was to guard the artillery positions north of the Meuse, as forts Emines and Suarlée were bombarded. The 14th Reserve Division was to prevent a breakout to the west or south-west and the 22nd Division was to take forts Andoy and Dave, then advance to the Meuse. The 3rd Guard Division took the rest of Namur during the morning and the fall of fort Andoy. Malonne was taken by coup de main and the 38th Division closed up to the fort. In the evening the 38th Division took fort St. Héribert and forts Emines, Dave and Suarlée were captured on 25 August.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1930, Crater and his wife Stella Mance Wheeler were vacationing at their summer cabin in Belgrade, Maine. In late July, Crater {{received}} a telephone call. He offered no information to his wife {{about the content of}} the call, other than to say that he had to return to the city [...] "to straighten those fellows out". The next day, he arrived at his 40 Fifth Avenue apartment, but instead of dealing with business, he made a trip to Atlantic City, New Jersey, with his mistress, showgirl Sally Lou Ritzi (who used the stage name Ritz). He returned to Maine on August 1, and traveled back to New York on August 3. Before making this final trip, he promised his wife that he would return by her birthday on August 9. Crater's wife stated that he was in good spirits and behaving normally when he departed for New York City. On the morning of Wednesday, August 6, Crater spent two hours going through his files in his courthouse chambers, reportedly destroying several documents. He then had his law clerk Joseph Mara cash two checks for him that amounted to $5,150 (equivalent to about $ in [...] dollars).

He decided to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the year off to relax and rehabilitate. Richard was now sure that Karen was battling with anorexia nervosa, but she denied it, saying she simply had colitis. Karen {{did not want to}} take a break from singing nor seek professional medical help for her own condition, so she decided to pursue a solo album project with producer Phil Ramone in New York. The choice of Ramone and more adult-oriented and disco / dance-tempo material represented an effort to retool her image. Heatwave keyboardist and songwriter Rod Temperton (and future Michael Jackson collaborator) was asked by Ramone to help with songwriting and arranging, and Billy Joel's backup band were used for the album. She decided not to record Temperton's [...] "Off the Wall" [...] and [...] "Rock with You", which later became hits for Jackson. The album was finished by early 1980, but drew a negative reception from A Her mother, Agnes did not like Karen working without Richard, while Richard felt that Karen was not well enough to have worked on the album. The total cost of recording was $500,000 of which $400,000 came from the Carpenters' own funds. The album was not released and although the press announced it was canceled at Karen's request, its rejection devastated her, who felt she had just had wasted months of work. It was finally issued in 1996, 13 years after Karen's death.|$|E
2500|$|At the Pennsylvania Academy [...] Lynch {{made his}} first short film, which was titled Six Men Getting Sick (Six Times) (1967). He had first {{come up with the}} idea when he {{developed}} a wish to see his paintings move, and he subsequently began discussing the idea of creating an animation with an artist named Bruce Samuelson. When this project never came about, Lynch decided to work on a film alone, and so purchased the cheapest 16mm camera that he could find in order to do so. Taking one of the abandoned upper rooms of the Academy as a working space, he spent $200 – which at the time he felt {{to be a lot of}} money – to produce Six Men Getting Sick. Describing the work as [...] "57seconds of growth and fire, and three seconds of vomit", Lynch played the film on a loop at the Academy's annual end-of-year exhibit, where it shared joint first prize with a painting by Noel Mahaffey. This led to a commission from one of his fellow students, the wealthy H. Barton Wasserman, who offered him $1000 to create a film installation in his home. Spending $478.28 of that on purchasing the second-hand Bolex camera [...] "of [...] dreams", Lynch produced a new animated short, but upon getting the film developed, realized that the result was simply a blurred, frameless print. As he would later relate, [...] "So I called up Bart [...] and said, 'Bart, the film is a disaster. The camera was broken and what I've done hasn't turned out.'
