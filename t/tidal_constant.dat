40|$|A hybrid {{technique}} for predicting tides for new locations, based on {{as little as}} 25 h of concurrent temporary and reference site sea level observations, plus {{up to a year}} of reference records, is evaluated using 2 -yr South Korean and New Zealand case studies. Comparisons are made between the existing prediction methods of conventional standard harmonic analysis and prediction (CSHAP) and tidal species modulation with <b>tidal</b> <b>constant</b> corrections (TSM 1 TCC). Building on these approaches, a new procedure is developed to produce a complete tidal species modulation (CTSM) equivalent of CSHAP, with the added inclusion of nodal factors and angles, astronomical arguments, and tidal species <b>tidal</b> <b>constant</b> correction terms (1 TCC), to generate results for temporary sites. The CTSM 1 TCC approach described here overcomes the record length limitations of traditional standard harmonic-based prediction methods, making the technique more useful to diverse coastal and hydrographic researchers. The CTSM 1 TCC method is refined using yearlong input and comparative data from contrasting hydrographic settings, revealing spring periods, specific months, and conditions devoid of nontidal residual extremes (e. g., storms) as the most appropriate sample periods for collecting temporary site data in order to maximize prediction accuracy. CTSM 1 TCC represents a viable alternative to tidal prediction methods using multiconstituent inferences, for those wishing to make predictions for new sites based on established conventional tidal prediction software, with the added benefits of efficient input data collection and no need for a decision process regarding multiconstituent inference calculations. CTSM 1 TCC could, without compromising accuracy, support the spatial and temporal proliferation of tidal predictions across coastal oceans, where fieldwork funds and instruments currently hinder predictions for new locations...|$|E

The observations have been continuing {{almost four years}} until now.

After applying several corrections to the observed tidal parameters, the ocean-tide corrected tidal factors were compared with theoretical ones by an elastic, ellipsoidal, rotating Earth model. Finally, the obtained tidal factors are consistent with theoretical ones within the discrepancy of 1 % for principal constituents.

Materials and methods: The effects on respiratory system stress relaxation {{of changing the}} end inflation volume while keeping <b>tidal</b> volume <b>constant,</b> and of changing the tidal volume while maintaining constant end inflation volume, were separately studied by the end-inflation occlusion method. These changes were obtained by inflating the respiratory system starting from different volumes above functional residual capacity. Results: We found that: (1) a simple exponential equation well describe the visco-elastic pressure drop for different inflation modalities; (2) the stress relaxation-linked, visco-elastic pressure drop, increases with increasing the tidal volume and keeping the end-inflation volume constant, but is independent from the end-inflation lung volume at <b>constant</b> <b>tidal</b> volumes; (3) time constant values show a significant increment with end-inflation volume at <b>constant</b> <b>tidal</b> volume but result independent from tidal volume variation at constant end-inflation volume.

50|$|The {{state to}} which the science of tide-prediction had arrived by the 1870s can be summarized: Astronomical {{theories}} of the Moon and Sun had identified the frequencies and strengths of different components of the tide-generating force. But effective prediction at any given place called for measurement of an adequate sample of local tidal observations, to show the local tidal response at those different frequencies, in amplitude and phase. Those observations had then to be analyzed, to derive the coefficients and phase angles. Then, for purposes of prediction, those local <b>tidal</b> <b>constants</b> had to be recombined, each with a different component of the tide-generating forces to which it applied, and at each of a sequence of future dates and times, and then the different elements finally collected together to obtain their aggregate effects. In the age when calculations were done by hand and brain, with pencil and paper and tables, this was recognized as an immensely laborious and error-prone undertaking.|$|R

Several numerical experiments, including different model dimensions (two-dimension or three-dimension), prescribed open boundary conditions (without or with mean sea surface elevation), astronomical tidal forcing, stratifications (without or with baroclinic effect) and wind forcing, are carried out. The resulted time series of surface elevation data are stored to yield harmonic constants for the four most significant constituents, M- 2, S- 2, K- 1 and O- 1, and the computed harmonic constants are compared with the observed ones. It is shown that the predicted <b>tidal</b> harmonic <b>constants</b> by the three-dimensional model are better than those by the two-dimensional one; with astronomical tidal forcing and mean sea surface elevation at the open boundary, the predicted accuracy could be improved and {{it is recommended that}} the baroclinic effect and wind forcing are also included in the modeling.

The open boundary condition of Reid and Bodine (1968) was applied to regional models of the western Florida shelf, north-central Gulf of Mexico, and the Kenya Coast. In addition, two semienclosed basins were modeled, the Persian Gulf, and the entire Gulf of Mexico. A number of tests were conducted to determine how well forcing, using the <b>tidal</b> <b>constants</b> from the 10 xl ° Schwiderski global model (1981, 1983) could reproduce regional tides as determined from observations.

The western Florida shelf is known to resonate with the M 2 tide.

40|$|Binary {{neutron star}} mergers are studied using {{nonlinear}} 3 + 1 numerical relativity simulations and the analytical effective-one-body (EOB) model. The EOB model predicts quasiuniversal {{relations between the}} mass-rescaled gravitational wave frequency and the binding energy {{at the moment of}} merger, and certain dimensionless binary <b>tidal</b> coupling <b>constants</b> depending on the stars Love numbers, compactnesses and the binary mass ratio. These relations are quasiuniversal in the sense that, for a given value of the <b>tidal</b> coupling <b>constant,</b> they depend significantly neither on the equation of state nor on the mass ratio, though they do depend on stars spins. The spin dependence is approximately linear for small spins aligned with the orbital angular momentum. The quasiuniversality is a property of the conservative dynamics; nontrivial relations emerge as the binary interaction becomes tidally dominated. This analytical prediction is qualitatively consistent with new, multi-orbit numerical relativity results for the relevant case of equal-mass irrotational binaries. Universal relations are thus expected to characterize neutron star mergers dynamics. In the context of gravitational wave astronomy, these universal relations may be used to constrain the neutron star equation of state using waveforms that model the merger accurately...|$|R
2500|$|Current {{procedure}} for analysing tides follows {{the method of}} harmonic analysis introduced in the 1860s by William Thomson. It {{is based on the}} principle that the astronomical theories of the motions of sun and moon determine a large number of component frequencies, and at each frequency there is a component of force tending to produce tidal motion, but that at each place of interest on the Earth, the tides respond at each frequency with an amplitude and phase peculiar to that locality. [...] At each place of interest, the tide heights are therefore measured {{for a period of time}} sufficiently long (usually more than a year in the case of a new port not previously studied) to enable the response at each significant tide-generating frequency to be distinguished by analysis, and to extract the <b>tidal</b> <b>constants</b> for a sufficient number of the strongest known components of the astronomical tidal forces to enable practical tide prediction. The tide heights are expected to follow the tidal force, with a constant amplitude and phase delay for each component. [...] Because astronomical frequencies and phases can be calculated with certainty, the tide height at other times can then be predicted once the response to the harmonic components of the astronomical tide-generating forces has been found.|$|R

40|$|Tides in {{the polar}} region {{play a major}} role in the {{dynamics}} of sea ice and floating glacial ice shelves. Existing ocean tide models are much less accurate in coastal and shallow seas and polar oceans than other ocean areas. In particular, ocean tides are largely unknown in parts of polar oceans that are covered by permanent or seasonal sea ice and in regions that are beyond the coverage of the TOPEX/POSEIDON (T/P). We conducted a periodogram analysis using simulated satellite altimeter data (T/P or JASON, ERS- 2 or ENVISAT) at single and dual satellite crossover locations. Our results indicate that the TOPEX/ERS- 2 dual satellite crossovers show considerable improvements to mitigate tidal aliasing and are, therefore, preferable for tidal modeling. Empirical ocean tide models have been determined using the T/P and ERS- 2 altimetry at crossovers in the Southern Ocean below 55 ◦S and employing the response method.

Also, in the real Thomson machines, to save on motion and wear of the other parts, the shaft and pulley with the largest expected motion (for the M2 tide component at twice per lunar day) was mounted nearest to the pen, and the shaft and pulley representing the smallest component was at the other end, nearest to the point of fixing of the flexible cord or chain, to minimize unnecessary motion in the most part of the flexible cord.|$|R

The finite difference method is used to solve the control equations. The model area is 900 km × 900 km, and Taiwan lies in the central part of model. The tides at open boundaries of model are the driving forces for tidal flow inside the model. The tides at model boundaries are calculated through harmonic method making use of the principal <b>tidal</b> <b>constants</b> of M 2, S 2, K 1 and O 1 partial tides. Air pressure gradient and wind stress are considered as the driving forces for typhoon surge in this model. A circular storm model of Jelesnianski (1965) is taken here as the typhoon model. The combined effect of typhoon surge and tide will be studied in this model. The computed results are compared to the observed ones at some tidal stations around Taiwan. For strong wind region near typhoon center the computed results agree well with the observed data in most tidal gauge stations. For some typhoons, where the winds are weak and unstable, the computed results are poorly comparable to the observed ones. This may be due to the discrepancy between circular typhoon model and real typhoon. ...|$|R

The observed 18. 61 year nodal modulations of the diurnal constituents O 1 and K 1 are {{in agreement with the}} equilibrium tidal theory, except in the South China Sea. The observed modulations of the M 2 and N 2 amplitudes are smaller than theoretically predicted at the northern stations and larger at the southern stations. The discrepancies between the theoretically predicted nodal variations and the observations are discussed.

The corrections were determined on a 3 deg x 3 deg grid using both the harmonic analysis method and the response method. The two approaches produce similar solutions. The effect on the tide solution of simultaneously adjusting radial orbit correction parameters using altimeter measurements was examined. Four semidiurnal (N(sub 2), M(sub 2), S(sub 2) and K(sub 2)), four diurnal (Q(sdub 1), O(sub 1), P(sub 1), and K(sub 1)), and three long-period (S(sub sa), M(sub m), and M(sub f)) constituents, along with the variations at the annual frequency, {{were included in the}} harmomnic analysis solution. The observed annual variations represents the first global measurement describing accurate seasonal changes of the ocean during an El Nino year. The corrections to the M(sub 2) constituent have an root mean square (RMS) of 3. 6 cm and display a clear banding pattern with regional highs and lows reaching 8 cm.

In order to optimise the completeness and the accuracy of the sea surface height information derived from satellite altimetry in coastal ocean areas, a dedicated post-processing software, called X-TRACK, has been developed by the Center of Topography of the Ocean and Hydrosphere in Toulouse. It is tailored for extending the use of altimetry data to coastal ocean applications and provides freely available along-track Sea Level Anomaly time series that cover today all the coastal oceans. Here, we present the improvements made in version 2016 of X-TRACK and show the gain in near-coastal data accuracy using in situ tide gauge observations. The correlations between altimeter and tide gauge sea level anomalies are higher (by 15 % in average) compared with the previous version of X-TRACK. Three examples of applications are shown. The recent evolutions done in the X-TRACK processing result in an improved observation of the seasonal variations of the boundary circulation in the Bay of Biscay. Along Western Africa, sea-level variations derived from X-TRACK data are observed closer to land (5 km) compared to AVISO (10 km), and the sea-level statistics are more robust due to the larger and more stable data availability.

40|$|Quite a {{long time}} the {{analysis}} of tidal observations {{has been based on}} the knowledge of the frequencies of the tidal components. These frequencies follow from an analysis of the tidal potentialor the tide generating force. This analysis also yields amplitudes and phases, but they are not equal to those of the real tidal components, called tqe <b>tidal</b> <b>constants.</b> The latter, namely, have to be derived from observations and the method of the least squares is a suitable tooI for that purpose. Another method is the Fourier. analysis (transformation), which yields information about which components are important, and application of the method of least squares afterwards,but this method is used less frequently. One of the reasons is, that gaps in a registration cannot be handled by Fourier analysis, but the least squares method can overcome this difficulty. However, knowledge about astronomical frequencies remains required. In a way these methods for tidal analysis are rather conservative compared to the method of time series analysis, wh i. chis now widely used in many branches of engineering, physical sciences and economics. One important aspect of times series analysis is spectral analysis, such as has been treated in chapter 4 considering deterministic signals in particular. Munk and Cartwright were the first to apply this theory in behalf of tidal analysis. In this connection it means that the output of a system, consisting of a water level registration, for instance, is correlated to a series of inputs, such as the tide generating force, solar radiation and possibly meteorological influences. Schematically this system can be represented by a block diagram. Time series analysis aims at the determination of the properties of the (sub-) systems, either in the time domain or in the frequency domain.

Nineteen years of sea level data from tide gauge and satellite altimetry are analyzed to predict regional flooding. Harmonic analysis is used in analyzing tidal variations to determine the major astronomical <b>tidal</b> constituent harmonic <b>constants.</b> <b>Tidal</b> variation prediction can be performed with these harmonic constants. The empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method is then applied to the sea level data derived from altimetry for extracting warm-water mass variation.

The sea level data derived from along-track satellite altimeter near Tuvalu is decomposed into eight modes and one local trend using the EMD method. The EMD mode periods found by fast Fourier transform (FFT) include monthly, intra-seasonally, half-yearly, yearly, bi-annually, and inter-annually oscillations. We apply these periods to harmonic analysis to predict the variations in warm-water mass. The sea level tide and warm-water mass combination predictions are compared to field measurements.

This implies that, similar to observations, the critical shear stress for erosion is regularly exceeded during the tidal cycle and that modelled equilibrium conditions include high suspended sediment concentrations at the mudflat. Shear stresses are highest during low water, while shear stresses are lower than critical (and highest at the landward end) along the mudflat during high water. Scenarios of sea level rise and decreasing sediment supply drown the mudflat. In addition, the mudflat becomes more prone to channel incision because landward accumulation is hampered. This research suggests that sea level rise is a serious threat to the presence of many estuarine intertidal mudflats, adjacent salt marshes and their associated ecological values. </p...|$|R
40|$|A one-way nested-grid coastal ocean {{circulation}} modeling system {{was developed for}} Canadian Atlantic coastal waters based on an operational prototype shelf circulation forecast system known as Dalcoast 3 and a high-resolution coastal circulation model developed for Lunenburg Bay (LB) of Nova Scotia. The nested-grid system consists of five relocatable downscaling sub-models, including the outermost sub-model covering the eastern Canadian shelf with a coarse horizontal resolution of 1 / 12 °, and the innermost sub-model covering LB with a fine resolution of about 180 m. The nested-grid system is driven by meteorological forcing converted from three-hourly weather forecast fields provided by the Meteorological Service of Canada and tidal forcing produced by WebTide using pre-calculated <b>tidal</b> harmonic <b>constants.</b> The nested-grid system is used to simulate the dynamic response of coastal waters over the inner Scotian Shelf in June and July 2006. A comparison of model results with observations made in LB demonstrates that the NCOPS-LB performs reasonably well in simulating sea surface elevations and tidal currents, and less well in simulating hydrography and non-tidal currents over the inner shelf...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} tides in the {{circulation}} of the Adriatic Sea is investigated {{by means of a}} nested baroclinic numerical ocean model. Tides are introduced using a modified Flather boundary condition at the open edge of the domain. The results show that tidal amplitudes and phases are reproduced correctly by the baroclinic model and <b>tidal</b> harmonic <b>constants</b> errors are comparable with those resulting from the most consolidated barotropic models. Numerical experiments were conducted to estimate and assess the impact of (i) the modified Flather lateral boundary condition; (ii) tides on temperature, salinity, and stratification structures in the basin; and (iii) tides on mixing and circulation in general. Tides induce a different momentum advective component in the basin, which in turn produces a different distribution of water masses in the basin. Tides impact on mixing and stratification in the River Po region (northwestern Adriatic) and induce semidiurnal fluctuations of salinity and temperature, in all four seasons for the former and summer alone for the latter. A clear presence of internal tides was evidenced in the northern Adriatic Sea basin, corroborating previous finding...|$|R
30|$|Mechanical {{ventilation}} (Servo 900, Siemens, Berlin, Germany) {{was maintained}} using <b>constant</b> <b>tidal</b> volumes of 8  mL/kg. Initial PEEP was 5  cmH 20. Respiratory rate was adjusted {{to maintain an}} end-tidal CO 2 between 35 and 45  mmHg before the abdomen was inflated but not changed thereafter. Peak inspiratory pressure (pPAW) and dynamic respiratory system compliance (CRS) were obtained automatically from the ventilator. End-expiratory lung volume was measured at baseline IAP and PEEP of 5  cmH 2 O using the multiple breath nitrogen wash-out method as previously described [11]. Pressure-volume (P-V) curves were performed at PEEP 5  cmH 2 O and then at PEEP 15  cmH 2 O.|$|R
40|$|We reexamine {{the popular}} {{belief that a}} telluric planet or {{satellite}} on an eccentric orbit can, outside a spin-orbit resonance, be captured in a quasi-static tidal equilibrium called pseudosynchronous rotation. The existence of such configurations was deduced from oversimplified tidal models assuming either a <b>constant</b> <b>tidal</b> torque or a torque linear in the tidal frequency. A more accurate treatment requires that the torque be decomposed into the Darwin-Kaula series over the tidal modes, and that this decomposition be combined with a realistic choice of rheological properties of the mantle. This development demonstrates that there exist no stable equilibrium states for solid planets and moons, other than spin-orbit resonances...|$|R
