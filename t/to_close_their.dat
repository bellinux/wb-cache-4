5|$|During {{development}} in the early 2000s, the center took up nearly 200 acres of space previously used as farmland. Ryan Companies US, Inc. funded the project, which included {{the construction of a}} medical campus and several retail options. Upon completion in August 2005, over 20 retail tenants had been constructed with the majority of them being vacant. Several national retailers announced interest in the center, including Super Target, which announced plans <b>to</b> <b>close</b> <b>their</b> other Maple Grove location. OfficeMax opened a location in 2007, but closed in November 2014 after merging with Office Depot, Inc.. Following the closure, only 14 stores remained open at the center.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, Conteh {{began working}} with the CDC and team leader Joseph B. McCormick at the Nixon Methodist Hospital in Segbwema. Conteh became Medical Superintendent of the {{hospital}} in 1980. The Sierra Leone Civil War broke out in 1991, forcing the CDC <b>to</b> <b>close</b> <b>their</b> program and move to Guinea. The hospital was destroyed in the conflict {{and the spread of}} Lassa fever grew worse. During the civil war, the Natal multimammate mouse infested abandoned houses, increasing the likelihood of infection.|$|E

5|$|In Priyadas' biography, Tulsidas is {{attributed}} {{with the power}} of working miracles. In one such miracle, he is believed to have brought back a dead Brahmin to life. While the Brahmin was being taken for cremation, his widow bowed down to Tulsidas on the way who addressed her as Saubhagyavati (a woman whose husband is alive). The widow told Tulsidas her husband had just died, so his words could not be true. Tulsidas said that the word has passed his lips and so he would restore the dead man to life. He asked everybody present <b>to</b> <b>close</b> <b>their</b> eyes and uttered the name of lord Rama, on doing which the dead Brahmin was raised back to life.|$|E
5|$|The Russian {{force was}} superior, but faced severe {{logistical}} problems. Count Paskevich's army {{was too big}} to sustain on food confiscated from captured lands. It relied on provisions transported from Russia, either directly through Polish territory or theoretically neutral Prussia. The epidemic of cholera brought to Poland and East Prussia by Russian soldiers forced the Prussian authorities <b>to</b> <b>close</b> <b>their</b> borders to Russian transports. To avoid starving his army, Paskevich ordered two permanent bridges built across the Vistula, in Góra and Podgórze. Only the latter one had been completed {{by the start of}} the Russian assault of Warsaw.|$|E
5|$|During the 1950s and 1960s, the Manhattan Valley {{neighborhood}} (then {{known as}} Bloomingdale), where the Master Building is located, saw its culturally-oriented middle class renters depart. Many of them, it was said, opted to buy {{houses in the}} suburban New York metropolitan area. As a consequence, the museum and cultural center lost their audience and in 1971 they were forced <b>to</b> <b>close.</b> <b>Their</b> holdings were donated to Brandeis University and cultural initiatives such as the Master Institute Chorus, founded in 1960, either folded, or, {{as in the case}} of the chorus, became affiliated with other organizations, such as the New Amsterdam Singers. The Horches' daughter, Oriole, became advisory consultant for the collection at Brandeis. The building's auditorium continued to present concerts, plays, readings, and lectures in the 1940s and into the 1950s. From 1961 through 1978 the Equity Library Theater leased it for productions showcasing the talents of New York actors.|$|E

5|$|On one {{occasion}} {{while he was}} bathing in the Saigon River, Nao decided to inspect the sewer tunnel which his father had advised him to use. Nao concluded that the tunnel would provide {{the best way to}} get in and out of the American area, but using it also presented challenges. The sewerage tunnel contained both wastes and toxic oils which could cause blindness, so Nao and his men would have <b>to</b> <b>close</b> <b>their</b> eyes as they move through the tunnel, in order to avoid blindness. Furthermore, Nao and his men must wash their bodies to get rid of the deadly odours to avoid detection, and probably arrest, by South Vietnamese authorities. After Nao had surveyed the tunnels which lead into the port, he presented his plan of attack to the Saigon-Gia Dinh Military District Headquarters. Nao decided to utilise high explosives, enough to sink a ship, and detonate it using a timer so that his men could get away safely. Nao’s superiors approved the plan, and they ordered him to launch the attack before sunrise to avoid killing local Vietnamese civilians.|$|E
5|$|The Corporal had {{numerous}} limitations. It {{took a long}} time to set up, so it could not engage targets of opportunity; there could be delays in the countdown process, which made it hard to warn the troops <b>to</b> <b>close</b> <b>their</b> eyes or aircraft to avoid the area; and it was guided by a radio beam that not only could be jammed, but could actually be diverted. Moreover, during test firings in the Outer Hebrides, although eight out of twelve missiles accurately hit their targets, four fell short, which is always regrettable but particularly so when nuclear weapons are involved in view of the danger it posed to one's own troops. A new British project was therefore launched to develop a better missile, codenamed Blue Water, which was to have used the British Indigo Hammer and later the Tony warhead.|$|E

30|$|As in {{everyday}} activities, for potential criminals, the areas for committing crimes are concentrated and usually <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> living space or places they pass by, including nodes, paths, edges of various functional areas, and their awareness space.

25|$|Ducati is also {{famous for}} using the {{desmodromic}} valve system championed by engineer and designer Fabio Taglioni, though the firm has also used engines that use valve springs <b>to</b> <b>close</b> <b>their</b> valves.

These valves do not suffer from valve float at high engine speeds, thus a desmodromic engine is capable of far higher revolutions than a similarly configured engine with traditional spring-valve heads.|$|E
