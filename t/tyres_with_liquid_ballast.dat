40|$|FLNG is a {{new type}} of {{floating}} LNG platform which is ship-shaped FPSO hull equipped with LNG storage tanks and liquefaction plants and has been developed as an alternative to long pipelines to LNG liquefaction plant on land for stranded offshore fields. Different to the conventional FPSO, the hydrodynamic performance of the being-proposed FLNG can be significantly affected by the inner-tank liquid sloshing, {{due to the fact that}} LNG performs better liquidity than crude oil. In order to investigate the hydrodynamic characteristics of FLNG with large hull and high center of gravity, a series of numerical simulations on an FLNG designed by CNOOC and MARIC were conducted with the help of the well-known code WADAM. In addition, corresponding model tests on the same vessel with solid ballast were completed, serving as a verification of the numerical simulations. In order to inspect the sloshing effects of inner tanks on the global motion responses of the FLNG vessel, model tests <b>with</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>ballast</b> were also conducted. Comparisons were made between numerical and experimental results with methods of Fast Fourier Transformation technology and spectral analysis. The numerical simulation results were in good accordance with those of the model tests, which proves the feasibility of the numerical simulations. Furthermore, the effects of the inner tank sloshing on the FLNG hydrodynamic characteristics were summed up. Conclusions obtained from the comparison results would be of significant importance for the design of the FLNG system...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} {{tractive}} efficiency (TE) of MF 285 and U 650 tractors during moldboard plowing were evaluated and compared. Field experiments were {{conducted at the}} Experimental Station, College of Agriculture, Shiraz University, using a randomized complete block design with a 3 * 3 factorial. The soil was sandy clay loam with an average moisture content of 18 % b. d. from zero to 30 cm depth. Test treatments were combinations of three tractor types or conditions (U 650, MF 285 <b>liquid</b> <b>ballasted</b> and MF 285 <b>with</b> no <b>liquid</b> or weight <b>ballast)</b> and three levels of plowing depth (10 - 15 cm, 15 - 20 cm and 20 - 25 cm). Plowing speed was kept constant at about 4 km/h throughout the experiment. The measured or calculated parameters included: tractor drawbar pull and rolling resistance, drive wheel slip and tractor tractive efficiency. Statistical analysis of the test {{results showed that the}} primary difference between the tractor types or conditions was in their wheel slip, such that the average wheel slip of U 650 was lowest (12. 6 %) while that of unballasted MF 285 was highest (27 %) and was reduced to 17. 7 % <b>with</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>ballasting.</b> Also, while growth of unballasted MF 285 wheel slip with increasing plowing depth was drastically high (11 % to 48 %), that of U 650 was quite moderate (9. 7 % to 16. 5 %). Analysis of the calculated values of TE showed that there was no significant changes in the TE of U 650 with increasing plowing depth and that with an average of 73. 8 %, it had a desirable performance. The TE of unballasted MF 285 that was over 75 % at shallow plowing, dropped to 46 % with increasing plowing depth, while water ballasting improved the decreasing trend of TE with plowing depth and raised its minimum value to about 63 %. The overall results of this study showed that unballasted MF 285 tractors had desirable TE only at shallow plowing and that for medium and deep plowing, U 650 or water ballasted MF 285 tractors should be used...|$|R
6000|$|... "The guide-rope {{remedies}} {{the difficulty}} in the simplest manner conceivable. It is merely a very long rope which is suffered to trail from the car, {{and the effect of}} which is to prevent the balloon from changing its level in any material degree. If, for example, there should be a deposition of moisture upon the silk, and the machine begins to descend in consequence, there will be no necessity for discharging ballast to remedy the increase of weight, for it is remedied, or counteracted, in an exactly just proportion, by the deposit on the ground of just so much {{of the end of the}} rope as is necessary. If, on the other hand, any circumstances should cause undue levity, and consequent ascent, this levity is immediately counteracted by the additional weight of rope upraised from the earth. Thus, the balloon can neither ascend or descend, except within very narrow limits, and its resources, either in gas or ballast, remain comparatively unimpaired. When passing over an expanse of water, it becomes necessary to employ small kegs of copper or wood, filled <b>with</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>ballast</b> of a lighter nature than water. These float, and serve all the purposes of a mere rope on land. Another most important office of the guide-rope, is to point out the direction of the balloon. The rope drags, either on land or sea, while the balloon is free; the latter, consequently, is always in advance, when any progress whatever is made: a comparison, therefore, by means of the compass, of the relative positions of the two objects, will always indicate the course. In the same way, the angle formed by the rope with the vertical axis of the machine, indicates the velocity. When there is no angle--in other words, when the rope hangs perpendicularly, the whole apparatus is stationary; but the larger the angle, that is to say, the farther the balloon precedes the end of the rope, the greater the velocity; and the converse.|$|R
40|$|A three-year {{research}} project {{was carried out}} to study tractor-implement dynamics during tillage operations. Field tests with trailed disc harrows were carried out, under real working conditions, in dry medium textured soils, subject to primary and secondary tillage. The specific objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of <b>liquid</b> <b>ballast</b> and tyre inflation pressure on tractor performance parameters. The tests were performed using two different static <b>ballasts,</b> <b>with</b> and without <b>liquid</b> <b>tyre</b> <b>ballast,</b> and three different inflation pressures: the inflation pressure specified by the tyre manufacturer (100 kPa in the front tyres and 70 kPa in the rear tyres); the inflation pressure specified by the tractor manufacturer (140 kPa in the tyres of both axles); and the typical inflation pressure used by majority of the farmers in the region (190 kPa in the tyres of both axles). A four-wheel-drive, 59 kW (DIN), Massey-Ferguson 3060 Datatronic tractor and two trailed type medium-weight offset disc harrows, were used in the field tests. The instrumentation system to determine energy requirement and efficiency of the tractor-implement, included a portable computer based recording system which was placed in the tractor. The system was developed to record the information provided by the TPM "Datatronic", as well as the information provided by a load cell based pull measuring system. The studied evaluation parameters were: slip, real distance, work-rate, overall energy efficiency and fuel consumption per hectare. The results obtained showed that the use of <b>liquid</b> <b>ballast</b> in the tyres did not improve work-rate, and it even caused a 5 % to 10 % increase in fuel consumption per hectare. To avoid soil compaction, and allow a more efficient general use of the tractor, the common and indiscriminate use of <b>liquid</b> <b>ballast</b> should be questioned. It was also shown that, with regard to the tyre inflation pressure, there were no significant differences between the inflation pressure specified by the tractor manufacturer and that specified by the tyre manufacturer, either in work-rate or in fuel consumption per hectare. The use of higher tyre inflation pressures, showed a slight reduction (3 % to 5 %) in work-rate and a large increase in fuel consumption per hectare (10 % to 25 %), even in good traction conditions, shown by the interval of slip values (7 % to 15 %). In these dry farming soils the above practices should be questioned...|$|R

50|$|By {{depressing}} {{the freezing}} point of water, calcium chloride {{is used to}} prevent ice formation and is used to de-ice. This application consumes {{the greatest amount of}} calcium chloride. Calcium chloride is relatively harmless to plants and soil. As a de-icing agent, it is more effective at lower temperatures than sodium chloride. When distributed for this use, it usually takes the form of small, white spheres a few millimeters in diameter, called prills. Solutions of calcium chloride can prevent freezing at temperature as low as âˆ’52 Â°C (âˆ’62 Â°F), making it ideal for filling agricultural implement tires as a <b>liquid</b> <b>ballast,</b> aiding traction in cold climates.|$|R

5000|$|In 1974, Pirelli {{invented the}} [...] "wide radial tyre", upon {{a request from}} the Lancia rally racing team for a tyre strong enough to {{withstand}} {{the power of the}} new Lancia Stratos. At that time, racing tyres were either slick <b>tyres</b> made <b>with</b> the cross ply technique (very wide <b>tyres</b> <b>with</b> a reduced sidewall height), or radial tyres, which were too narrow to withstand the Stratos' power and did not provide enough grip. Both were unusable for the Lancia Stratos, as the radials were destroyed within 10 km, and the slicks too stiff.
