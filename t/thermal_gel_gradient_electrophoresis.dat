40|$|Background: The {{red palm}} weevil (RPW) Rhynchophorus ferrugineus Olivier (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) {{is one of}} the major pests of palms. The larvae bore into the palm trunk and feed on the palm tender tissues and sap, leading the host tree to death. The gut {{microbiota}} of insects plays a remarkable role in the host life and understanding the relationship dynamics between insects and their microbiota may improve the biological control of insect pests. The purpose of this study was to analyse the diversity of the gut microbiota of field-caught RPW larvae sampled in Sicily (Italy). Results: The 16 S rRNA gene-based Temporal <b>Thermal</b> <b>Gradient</b> <b>Gel</b> <b>Electrophoresis</b> (TTGE) of the gut microbiota of RPW field-trapped larvae revealed low bacterial diversity and stability of the community over seasons and among pools of larvae from different host trees.

40|$|A recently-described immunoenzymatic (ELISA) {{method for}} the {{quantitative}} determination of biologically-active wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) in unknown samples {{has been applied}} to measure the concentration of active WGA in raw and cooked wheatderived foodstuffs. The method exploits the binding specificity of WGA to ovalbumin as a first step followed by identification of bound lectin with polyclonal antibodies. Purified WGA was used to obtain calibration curves. Detectable amounts of WGA were found in raw foodstuffs and wheat flours, whilst variable amounts of agglutinin were found in wholemeal pasta probably as a consequence of thermal inactivation during food processing. The <b>thermal</b> <b>gradient</b> <b>gel</b> <b>electrophoresis</b> (TGGE) technique was therefore applied to analyse the thermal stability of WGA. The biological activity of WGA decreased as a function of heating temperatures and time of exposure to thermal treatment in an S-shaped fashion with an inflection point around 65 C. As a consequence, WGA might represent a biochemical ‘‘indicator’’ allowing one to determine the thermal treatment undergone by wheat-derived foods during processing...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine profile of {{bacteria}} contaminated in a dry sauna. Bacteria sampled from the floor of the dry sauna (75 ~ 80 ℃) were separated and identified by using a <b>thermal</b> <b>gradient</b> <b>gel</b> <b>electrophoresis</b> (TGGE) technique, and were cultivated using a defined medium at 50 ℃. Bacteria grown in the defined medium were identified based on 16 S-rDNA sequence homology. The band number of DNA separated by TGGE was 15, indicating the species diversity of bacteria contaminating the dry sauna. Seven species of bacteria were successfully cultured on agar plate medium at 50 ℃, which represented a combination of thermophilic and thermoduric bacteria contaminating the dry sauna. The highest limit temperature for growth of the bacterial isolates was generally 50 ℃ when cultivated in a defined medium, but was raised to 60 ℃ when cultivated in a complex medium. Consequently, the bacteria grown at 50 ~ 60 ℃ are thermoduric or thermophilic, but others may not be...|$|R
40|$|Lactic acid {{bacteria}} (LAB) {{with different}} ecological niches are widely seen in fermented meat, vegetables, dairy products and cereals {{as well as}} in fermented beverages. Lactic acid bacteria are the most important group of bacteria in dairy industry due to their probiotic characteristics and fermentation agents as starter culture. In the taxonomy of the lactic acid bacteria; by means of rep-PCR, which is the analysis of repetitive sequences that are based on 16 S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequence, it is possible to conduct structural microbial community analyses such as Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of DNA fragments of different sizes cut with enzymes, Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) polymorphic DNA amplified randomly at low temperatures and Amplified Fragment-Length Polymorphism (AFLP) -PCR of cut genomic DNA.

Difficulties in acceptance of the technique and interpretation of the results remain, due to its qualitative nature. In this study we have addressed this problem by the construction and evaluation of a quantitative standard for incorporation into test DNA samples. The standard {{was based on a}} naturally occurring 16 S rRNA gene carried by the X-endosymbiont of the psyllid Anomoneura mori, a gamma-proteobacterium. This sequence is the most AT-rich 16 S rDNA gene recovered from any cultured organism or environmental sample described to date, and a specifically amplified rDNA fragment denatured under exceptionally low stringency denaturing conditions. The native sequence was modified to incorporate perfect matches to the PCR primers used. The efficiency of amplification of this standard in comparison to a range of 16 S rDNA sequences and the errors involved in enumerating template molecules under a range of PCR conditions are demonstrated and quantified. Tests indicated that highly accurate counts of released target molecules from a range of bacterial cells could be achieved in both laboratory mixtures and compost.

40|$|To {{determine}} whether the diversity of phenanthrene-degrading bacteria in an aged polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) contaminated soil {{is affected by the}} addition of plant root exudates, DNA stable isotope probing (SIP) was used. Microcosms of soil with and without addition of ryegrass exudates and with 13 C-labelled phenanthrene (PHE) were monitored over 12 days. PHE degradation was slightly delayed in the presence of added exudate after 4 days of incubation. After 12 days, 68 % of added PHE disappeared both with and without exudate. Carbon balance using isotopic analyses indicated that a part of the 13 C-PHE was not totally mineralized as 13 CO 2 but unidentified 13 C-compounds (i. e. 13 C-PHE or 13 C-labelled metabolites) were trapped into the soil matrix. Temporal <b>thermal</b> <b>gradient</b> <b>gel</b> <b>electrophoresis</b> (TTGE) analyses of 16 S rRNA genes were performed on recovered 13 C-enriched DNA fractions. 16 S rRNA gene banding showed the impact of root exudates on diversity of PHE-degrading bacteria. With PHE as a fresh sole carbon source, Pseudoxanthomonas sp. and Microbacterium sp. were the major PHE degraders, while in the presence of exudates, Pseudomonas sp. and Arthrobacter sp. were favoured. These two different PHE-degrading bacterial populations were also distinguished through detection of PAH-ring hydroxylating dioxygenase (PAH-RHDa) genes by real-time PCR. Root exudates favoured the development of a higher diversity of bacteria and increased the abundance of bacteria containing known PAH-RHDa genes...|$|R
40|$|Rhizodegradation {{of organic}} pollutants, such as {{polycyclic}} aromatic hydrocarbons, {{is based on}} the effect of root-produced compounds, known as exudates. These exudates constitute an important and constant carbon source that selects microbial populations in the plant rhizosphere, modifying global as well as specific microbial activities. We conducted an experiment in two-compartment devices to show the selection of bacterial communities by root exudates and phenanthrene as a function of distance to roots. Using direct DNA extraction, PCR amplification, and <b>thermal</b> <b>gradient</b> <b>gel</b> <b>electrophoresis</b> screening, bacterial population profiles were analyzed in parallel to bacterial counts and quantification of phenanthrene biodegradation in three layers (0 to 3, 3 to 6, and 6 to 9 mm from root mat) of unplanted-polluted (phenanthrene), planted-polluted, and planted-unpolluted treatments. Bacterial community differed {{as a function of the}} distance to roots, in both the presence and the absence of phenanthrene. In the planted and polluted treatment, biodegradation rates showed a strong gradient with higher values near the roots. In the nonplanted treatment, bacterial communities were comparable in the three layers and phenanthrene biodegradation was high. Surprisingly, no biodegradation was detected in the section of planted polluted treatment farthest from the roots, where the bacterial community structure was similar to those of the nonplanted treatment. We conclude that root exudates and phenanthrene induce modifications of bacterial communities in polluted environments and spatially modify the activity of degrading bacteria...|$|R
40|$|We used a culture-independent approach, namely, <b>thermal</b> <b>gradient</b> <b>gel</b> <b>electrophoresis</b> (TGGE) {{analysis}} of ribosomal sequences amplified directly from community DNA, to determine {{changes in the}} structure of the microbial community following phenol shocks in the highly complex activated sludge ecosystem. Parallel experimental model sewage plants were given shock loads of chlorinated and methylated phenols and simultaneously were inoculated (i) with a genetically engineered microorganism (GEM) able to degrade the added substituted phenols or (ii) with the nonengineered parental strain. The sludge community DNA was extracted, and 16 S rDNA was amplified and analyzed by TGGE. To allow quantitative {{analysis of}} TGGE banding patterns, they were normalized to an external standard. The samples were then compared with each other for similarity by using the coefficient of Dice. The Shannon index of diversity, H, was calculated for each sludge sample, which made it possible to determine changes in community diversity. We observed a breakdown in community structure following shock loads of phenols by a decrease in the Shannon index of diversity from 1. 13 to 0. 22 in the noninoculated system. Inoculation with the GEM (Pseudomonas sp. strain B 13 SN 45 RE) effectively protected the microbial community, as indicated by the maintenance of a high diversity throughout the shock load experiment (H decreased from 1. 03 to only 0. 82). Inoculation with the nonengineered parental strain, Pseudomonas sp. strain B 13, did not protect the microbial community from being severely disturbed; H decreased from 1. 22 to 0. 46 for a 3 -chlorophenol– 4 -methylphenol shock and from 1. 03 to 0. 70 for a 4 -chlorophenol– 4 -methylphenol shock. The catabolic trait present in the GEM allowed for bioprotection of the activated sludge community from breakdown caused by toxic shock loading. In-depth TGGE analysis with similarity and diversity algorithms proved to be a very sensitive tool to monitor changes {{in the structure of}} the activated sludge microbial community, ranging from subtle shifts during adaptation to laboratory conditions to complete collapse following pollutant shocks...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe high organic {{pollutant}} concentration of aged {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon}} (PAH) -contaminated wasteland soils is highly recalcitrant to biodegradation due to its very low bioavailability. In such soils, the microbial community is well adapted to the pollution, but the microbial activity is limited by nutrient availability. Management strategies {{could be applied to}} modify the soil microbial functioning as well as the PAH contamination through various amendment types. The impact of amendment with clay minerals (montmorillonite), wood sawdust and organic matter plant roots on microbial community structure was investigated on two aged PAH-contaminated soils both in laboratory and 1 -year on-site pot experiments. Total PAH content (sum of 16 PAHs of the US-EPA list) and polar polycyclic aromatic compounds (pPAC) were monitored as well as the available PAH fraction using the Tenax method. The bacterial and fungal community structures were monitored using fingerprinting <b>thermal</b> <b>gradient</b> <b>gel</b> <b>electrophoresis</b> (TTGE) method. The abundance of bacteria (16 S rRNA genes), fungi (18 S rRNA genes) and PAH degraders (PAH-ring hydroxylating dioxygenase and catechol dioxygenase genes) was followed through qPCR assays. Although the treatments did not modify the total and available PAH content, the microbial community density, structure and the PAH degradation potential changed when fresh organic matter was provided as sawdust and under rhizosphere influence, while the clay mineral only increased the percentage of catechol- 1, 2 -dioxygenase genes. The abundance of bacteria and fungi and the percentage of fungi relative to bacteria were enhanced in soil samples supplemented with wood sawdust and in the plant rhizospheric soils. Two distinct fungal populations developed in the two soils supplemented with sawdust, i. e. fungi related to Chaetomium and Neurospora genera and Brachyconidiellopsis and Pseudallescheria genera, in H and NM soils respectively. Wood sawdust amendment favoured the development of PAH-degrading bacteria holding Gram-negative PAH-ring hydroxylating dioxygenase, catechol- 1, 2 -dioxygenase and catechol- 2, 3 -dioxygenase genes. Regarding the total community structure, bacteria closely related to Thiobacillus (beta-Proteobacteria) and Steroidobacter (gamma-Proteobacteria) genera were favoured by wood sawdust amendment. In both soils, plant rhizospheres induced the development of fungi belonging to Ascomycota and related to Alternaria and Fusarium genera. Bacteria closely related to Luteolibacter (Verrucomicrobia) and Microbacterium (Actinobacteria) were favoured in alfalfa and ryegrass rhizosphere...|$|R

This study was conducted in situ for 2 years using experimental plots of the two soils. NM soil was colonized by spontaneous vegetation (NM-SV), planted with Medicago sativa (NM-Ms), or left as bare soil (NM-BS), and the TD soil was planted with Medicago sativa (TD-Ms). The bacterial community density, structure, and diversity were estimated by real-time PCR quantification of the 16 S rRNA gene copy number, temporal <b>thermal</b> <b>gradient</b> <b>gel</b> <b>electrophoresis</b> fingerprinting, and band sequencing, respectively. The density of the bacterial community increased the first year during stabilization of the system and stayed constant in the NM soil, while it continued to increase in the TD soil during the second year. The bacterial community structure diverged among all the plot types after 2 years on site. In the NM-BS plots, the bacterial community was represented mainly by Betaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria. The presence of vegetation (NM-SV and NM-Ms) in the NM soil favored the development of a wider range of bacterial phyla (Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Chloroflexi) that, for the most part, were not closely related to known bacterial representatives. Moreover, {{under the influence of the}} same plant, the bacterial community that developed in the TD-Ms was represented by different bacterial species (Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, and Actinobacteria) than that in the NM-Ms. During the 2 years of monitoring, the PAH concentration did not evolve significantly. The abundance of gram-negative (GN) and gram-positive (GP) PAH-degrading bacteria was estimated by real-time PCR quantification of specific functional genes encoding the α subunit of PAH-ring hydroxylating dioxygenase (PAH-RHDα). The percentage of the PAH-RHDα GN bacterial genes relative to 16 S rRNA gene density decreased with time in all the plots. The GP PAH-RHDα bacterial gene proportion decreased in the NM-BS plots but stayed constant or increased under vegetation influence (NM-SV, NM-Ms, and TD-Ms) ...|$|R
