A marquee to shelter arriving and departing passengers spanned the seven central bays of the lower level, with a more ornate version on {{the north end of the}} pedestrian tunnel. The lower waiting room was expanded, a ticket office constructed, and a larger staircase to the main waiting room was built. The floor was covered with terrazzo and green marble, with white marble wainscoting on the walls. Three bays were added to the west wing for additional functional space, removing direct track access from the ramp. Cast iron streetlights with the PRR Keystone motif in their base were located around <b>the</b> <b>driveway</b> <b>and</b> grounds.|$|E
5|$|On December 31, 2008, Bellaire police {{officers}} confronted Robbie Tolan, {{the son of}} former Major League Baseball player Bobby Tolan, in the driveway of his house at the 800 block of Woodstock. Officers suspected Tolan, who was unarmed, of stealing a sports utility vehicle in <b>the</b> <b>driveway</b> <b>and</b> shot Tolan in the chest; Tolan's family owned the vehicle. Tolan was hospitalized with injuries to one lung and a liver. The incident sparked allegations of racial profiling. Members of minority groups reported that Bellaire police racially profiled people. In 2002, José Cruz, Jr., son of baseball player José Cruz, was stopped since his vehicle was missing a front license plate. He was arrested by Bellaire police and spent one night in jail after Bellaire law enforcement {{told him that he}} had a warrant for his arrest. The Houston Chronicle said that the Bellaire police decision to arrest Cruz was a mistake. In January 2009, Cruz accused the police of racial profiling. Mayor Cindy Siegel said that she was unaware of racial profiling by police. Siegel announced that the city will investigate racial profiling and hire an independent consultant to look at traffic stop data. The local National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) branch said that it established a pact with the City of Bellaire; people may report civil rights violations from Bellaire Police to the branch if the people do not wish to contact the City of Bellaire. However, the NAACP branch has not yet provided the city with any civil rights violations. On April 6, 2009, a Harris County grand jury indicted Sergeant Jeffrey Cotton, the police officer, for aggravated assault by a public servant. If convicted, Cotton could face up to life in prison. In addition the family sued the police department and the police officer. The upcoming trial in Harris County District Court on criminal felony charges against Cotton began on January 25, 2010. Jury selection was scheduled to begin on May 3, 2010. The officer was found not guilty in his criminal trial in May 2010.|$|E
25|$|Because Joe {{purchased}} the land believing {{that there would}} be access to the bridge and <b>the</b> <b>driveway</b> <b>and</b> Joe then paid for a house and a connection, Joe can be said to rely on Ray's promise of an easement. Ray materially misrepresented the facts to Joe. In order to preserve equity, the court will likely find an easement by estoppel.|$|E

25|$|The lawns {{contained}} many sculptural {{pieces in}} bronze, terra cotta, marble and stone.

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, if Ray had offered {{access to the}} bridge and {{driveway}} after selling Joe the land, {{there may not be}} an easement by estoppel. In this instance, it is merely inconvenient if Ray revokes access to the driveway. Joe did not purchase the land and build the house in reliance on access to <b>the</b> <b>driveway</b> <b>and</b> bridge. Joe will need to find a separate theory to justify an easement.|$|E
25|$|Surrounded by a picket fence, the Mapleton Drive {{house is}} two stories with a first floor kitchen, dining room, {{living room and}} {{adjoining}} patio, and at least three bedrooms on the second floor—one for the boys, one for the parents, and a guest room into which Beaver moves for a night. The cellar is accessible through a diagonal door in the kitchen. A kitchen door opens onto a small side yard, <b>the</b> <b>driveway,</b> <b>and</b> a single-car garage—a frequent setting for get-togethers between the boys, their father, and the boys' friends.|$|E
25|$|For example: Ray sells land to Joe on {{the promise}} that Joe can use Ray's {{driveway}} and bridge to the main road at any time, but Ray {{does not include the}} easement in the deed to the land. Joe, deciding that the land is now worth the price, builds a house and connects a garage to Ray's driveway. If Ray (or his successor) later decides to gate off <b>the</b> <b>driveway</b> <b>and</b> prevent Joe (or Joe's successor) from accessing the driveway, a court would likely find an easement by estoppel.|$|E

25|$|Moyne {{arrived in}} his car with his driver, Lance Corporal Arthur Fuller, his secretary, Dorothy Osmond, and his ADC, Major Andrew Hughes-Onslow.

The first bullet hit him in the neck on the right side, just above the clavicle, the second penetrated his abdomen, punctured his colon and large intestine, and became embedded to the right of the second lumbar vertebrae, while the third shot, fired after Moyne raised his right hand, ripped across four of his fingers and went in and out of his chest, causing no serious injuries.|$|E
500|$|The {{decision}} prompted complicated {{negotiations with}} the SR {{over the future of}} the LNC facilities in London. In December 1946 the directors of the two companies finally reached agreement. The railway-related portions of the LNC site (the waiting rooms, the caretaker's flat and the platforms themselves) would pass into the direct ownership of the SR, while the remaining surviving portions of the site (the office block on Westminster Bridge Road, <b>the</b> <b>driveway</b> <b>and</b> the ruined central portion of the site) would pass to the LNC to use or dispose of as they saw fit. The LNC sold the site to the British Humane Association in May 1947 for £21,000 (about £ in terms of [...] consumer spending power), and the offices of the LNC were transferred to the Superintendent's Office at Brookwood. The SR continued to use the surviving sections of the track as occasional sidings into the 1950s, before clearing what remained of their section of the site.|$|E

2500|$|Beginning in 1995, PGSMA began a $1.5 million [...] "Centennial Campaign" [...] {{fund-raising}} {{effort to}} make major improvements to its facility and to begin an endowment. The capital campaign, chaired by Diane Volk (whose father founded Volk Construction, a large building company in the state), surpassed its goal by $170,000 in early 1999. The funds allowed the museum to remove the sod from its north entrance and reinstall a historically accurate circular driveway. Local architectural firm L'Heureux Page Werner designed the new drive and staircase stabilization. The Helena, Montana, firm Dick Anderson Construction performed the stair work. Local construction firm United Materials, Inc. donated the materials for the drive. A commemorative sidewalk of brick, inscribed {{with the names of}} major donors to the capital campaign, was added between the staircase and the driveway. In addition to the driveway, all the windows in the building (which leaked significant amounts of air and permitted dust to filter inside) were replaced, the north steps were stabilized and repaired, the HVAC system repaired and made functional, the roof repaired, exhibit space renovated, oak trim throughout the building conserved and refinished, and the building's antique light fixtures restored (improving exhibition lighting dramatically). Historically accurate wooden doors replaced the existing doors, and the plaster in the entrance porticos repaired. <b>The</b> <b>driveway</b> <b>and</b> new stairs opened on September 30, 1999.
