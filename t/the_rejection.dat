5|$|<b>The</b> <b>rejection</b> likely {{had several}} causes. The {{people of the}} Grants were tired of the {{disputes}} with New York, and they were tired of Allen's posturing and egotistic behavior, which the success at Ticonderoga had enhanced. Finally, {{the failure of the}} attempt on St. John's was widely seen as reckless and ill-advised, attributes they did not appreciate in a regimental leader. Warner was viewed as a more stable and quieter choice, and was someone that also commanded respect. The history of Warner's later actions in the revolution (notably at Hubbardton and Bennington) may be seen as a confirmation of the choice made by the Dorset meeting. In the end, Allen took <b>the</b> <b>rejection</b> in stride, and managed to convince Schuyler and Warner to permit him to accompany the regiment as a civilian scout.|$|E

5|$|Bohemian {{waxwings}} are not brood parasitised by {{the common}} cuckoo or its relatives in Eurasia because the cuckoo's young cannot survive on a largely fruit diet. In North America, the waxwing's breeding range has little overlap with brown-headed cowbird, another parasitic species. Nevertheless, eggs of other birds {{placed in a}} Bohemian waxwing's nest are always rejected. This suggests that in the past, perhaps 3million years ago, the ancestral waxwing was a host of a brood parasitic species, and retains <b>the</b> <b>rejection</b> behaviour acquired then.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we study}} the {{asymptotic}} efficiency of <b>the</b> delayed <b>rejection</b> strategy. In particular, {{the efficiency of}} <b>the</b> delayed <b>rejection</b> Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is {{compared to that of}} the regular Metropolis algorithm. To allow for a fair comparison, the study is carried under optimal mixing conditions for each of these algorithms. After introducing optimal scaling results for <b>the</b> delayed <b>rejection</b> (DR) algorithm, we outline the fact that the second proposal after <b>the</b> first <b>rejection</b> is discarded, with a probability tending to 1 as the dimension of the target density increases. To overcome this drawback, a modification of <b>the</b> delayed <b>rejection</b> algorithm is proposed, in which the direction of the different proposals is fixed once for all, and the Metropolis-Hastings accept-reject mechanism is used to select a proper scaling along the search direction. It is shown that this strategy significantly outperforms the original DR and Metropolis algorithms, especially when the dimension becomes large. We include numerical studies to validate these conclusion...|$|R

A trial court must balance the defendant's interest in a robust defense with the (i) state's interest in 'efficient' justice, (ii) state's interest in excluding evidence lacking integrity, (iii) state's interest in a strong judicial authority with followed rules, and (iv) the prosecution interest in avoiding prejudice due to a defendant's discovery violation.|$|E

Roddenberry had already produced 68 pages after working on it for a month when he handed it to Koenig, who added another 83 in two months. Roddenberry received the changes enthusiastically, but a few weeks later Sackett informed Koenig that the project had been abandoned. In his 1997 autobiography Warped Factors, Koenig stated that he still had copies of the work he had completed on the book.|$|E

Nevertheless, she concedes that these principles may seem to be excessively demanding: there are many actions and institutions that do rely on non-universalisable principles, such as injury.|$|E
