5|$|<b>Their</b> <b>motives</b> for {{escaping}} {{evolved over}} time. Those who fled {{in the years}} shortly after the Wall was built had experienced the formerly open border first-hand and often had relatives in the West or had traveled there. By contrast, later escapees {{had grown up with}} the closed border, desired greater freedom and were dissatisfied with conditions in East Germany. Their attempts to escape were often triggered by specific events such as a wish to avoid conscription, repression by the authorities or the refusal of a request to emigrate. Many escapees had previously clashed with the state authorities and had been imprisoned for political offenses, often related to earlier unsuccessful escape attempts.|$|E
5|$|Caesar {{was assassinated}} in March 44 BC. The motives of the conspirators were both personal, as well as political. Many of Caesar's {{ultimate}} assassins were envious of him, and dissatisfied with the recognition that they had received from him. Most of the conspirators were senators, {{and many of them}} were angry {{about the fact that he}} had deprived the senate of much of its power and prestige. They were also angry that, while they had received few honors, Caesar had been given many honors. There were also rumors that he was going to make himself king, and transfer the seat of government to Alexandria. The grievances that they held against him were vague, and as such, their plan against him was vague. The fact that <b>their</b> <b>motives</b> were vague, and that they had no idea of what to do after his assassination, both were plainly obvious by the subsequent course of events.|$|E

5|$|Some reviewers {{enjoyed the}} game's story, but many {{pointed out that}} the campaign's {{conclusion}} was anticlimatic due to its abrupt and unresolved ending. Plagge found the plot to be interesting because it explored different parts of the Halo universe. She also felt the integration of the narrative with the campaign missions was effectively implemented through the cutscenes and pre-fight dialogue. However, she remarked that characters were underdeveloped and the story did not contribute much to the main Halo arc. Stapleton thought that Isabel was an endearing and emotive character that bolstered the fear induced by the game's antagonist, Atriox. He enjoyed Atriox's strong introduction but felt that the character became less prominent as the story progressed. Eurogamer writer Chris Bratt believed there was potential for an interesting backstory with Atriox and the Banished, but he viewed <b>their</b> <b>motives</b> in the campaign as being too similar to the Covenant, which consequently made the story feel like it was retreading familiar territory. Reactions towards the campaign cutscenes were overwhelmingly positive, with plenty of praise directed towards the high quality production and exceptional animation. While the character dialogue was noted as being cheesy at times, the expressive facial animations kept the cinematics captivating.|$|E
5|$|The protagonist {{encounters}} the antagonistic team, Team Galactic, {{early in}} the game, {{when he or she}} must save Professor Rowan from some of their thugs; however, <b>their</b> <b>motives</b> are unclear until later. The protagonist encounters the Team twice (when it takes over a wind farm and when it sets up a base in Eterna City) before it takes over Sinnoh's three lakes in an attempt to capture the Mirage Pokémon (Uxie, Azelf, and Mesprit). Shortly after the player earns his or her seventh Gym Badge, Team Galactic captures the Mirage Pokémon and imprisons them inside the science laboratory of the Team Galactic Headquarters Building, where its members extract crystals from the Pokémon to create the Red Chain, an object that can control the legendary Pokémon Palkia (in Pearl) or Dialga (in Diamond) (both in Pokémon Platinum, though Giratina appears after this). After releasing the trio, the protagonist is able to access Spear Pillar, an ancient ruin atop Mt. Coronet, where the leader of Team Galactic awakens Dialga or Palkia. The legendary Pokémon's powers begin to overwhelm Sinnoh, causing the newly free Uxie, Azelf, and Mesprit to attempt to stop it. The player then battles Palkia/Dialga; after defeating or capturing the Pokémon, Sinnoh returns to normal. After this, the player will continue, eventually battling the Sinnoh Region Pokémon League's Elite Four: Aaron, Bertha, Flint, and Lucian. After defeating all four members, the player will battle the Sinnoh League champion, a woman named Cynthia, who had appeared before in the game. If the protagonist beats Cynthia, he or she is the new Sinnoh League champion, beating the game. After the player beats the game, there is a new island to explore that is filled with other types of Pokémon. His or her old friend, who challenged him or her to battles multiple times before, will be waiting for him or her here. The old friend will challenge the player to another battle. On this island, there are also stores and a tournament center.|$|E

25|$|The Portella della Ginestra {{massacre}} {{was one of}} {{the most}} violent acts in the history of modern Italian politics, when 11 people were killed and 27 wounded during May Day celebrations in Sicily on May 1, 1947, in the municipality of Piana degli Albanesi. Those held responsible were the bandit and separatist leader Salvatore Giuliano and his band – although <b>their</b> <b>motives</b> and intentions are still a matter of controversy.|$|E
25|$|The {{uncertainty}} about {{the characteristics of the}} perpetrators, their relationships to the victims, or <b>their</b> <b>motives</b> is primarily due to the dysfunction of the Mexican justice system as most cases have been inadequately investigated and documented. While in many of the cases in Ciudad Juárez it has yet to be determined who exactly has committed the murders, much of the literature on this issue purports that patriarchal backlash against working women may be a potential motive for the killings.|$|E

The Human Rights Foundation stresses its beliefs on freedom of speech, self-determination, freedom of association, freedom of movement and democracy. In addition to hoping to topple the regime and agitating, the involved human rights organizations advocate causes like helping refugees, doing humanitarian work for disabled people living in North Korea, proselytizing Christianity, and various other causes.|$|E

The Negus replied that he had promised protection to the Muslims and therefore could not hand them over without hearing their side of the story. When the Muslims were called to answer to the Negus, Ja’far was their spokesman.|$|E
25|$|In July 2006 the Alabama-Coushatta sued {{lobbyist}} Jack Abramoff and {{his associates}} for attempts to defraud the tribe in seeking to defeat state legislation in 2001 {{that would have given}} them authority to run the casino. The tribe claimed the lobbyists had hidden <b>their</b> <b>motives</b> in representing the competing Coushatta of Louisiana, which ran their own casino, and mobilized Christian groups in an underhanded way. A Senate investigation in 2006 revealed that several tribes were defrauded of {{tens of millions of dollars}} by Abramoff and associates on issues associated with Indian gaming.|$|E
25|$|Emotion {{and social}} skills are {{important}} to an intelligent agent for two reasons.

Second, in an effort to facilitate human–computer interaction, an intelligent machine may want to display emotions (even if it does not experience those emotions itself) to appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction.|$|E

25|$|British writer Arthur C. Benson felt shyness is {{not mere}} self-consciousness, but a {{primitive}} suspicion of strangers, the primeval belief that <b>their</b> <b>motives</b> are predatory, with shyness a sinister quality which {{needs to be}} uprooted. He believed the remedy is for the shy to frequent society for courage from familiarity. Also, he claimed that too many shy adults take refuge in a critical attitude, engaging in brutal onslaughts on inoffensive persons. He felt that a better way is for the shy to be nice, to wonder what others need and like, interest in what others do or are talking about, friendly questions, and sympathy.|$|E
25|$|Most {{games in}} the series are set in fictional locales {{modelled}} on cities, usually either Liberty City, Vice City or San Andreas, which are stand-ins for New York City, Miami {{and the state of}} California, respectively. The first game encompassed three fictional cities, while subsequent titles tend to emphasise a single setting. Gameplay focuses on an open world where the player can choose missions to progress an overall story, as well as engaging in side activities, all consisting of action-adventure, driving, third-person shooting, occasional role-playing, stealth and racing elements. The series focuses around many different protagonists who attempt to rise through the ranks of the criminal underworld, although <b>their</b> <b>motives</b> for doing so vary in each game. The series also has elements of the earlier beat 'em up games from the 16-bit era. The antagonists are commonly characters who have betrayed the protagonist or his organisation, or characters who have the most impact impeding the protagonist's progress. Film and music veterans have voiced characters, including Ray Liotta, Burt Reynolds, Dennis Hopper, Samuel L. Jackson, James Woods, Debbie Harry, Phil Collins, Axl Rose and Peter Fonda. With its British origin, the series contains satire and humour.|$|E
25|$|Again excommunicated at Adrianople, he {{went with}} a few {{followers}} to Thessaloniki. There he met with scant welcome, but had more success in the communities of Chios and Corfu. From Corfu he went to Venice (March, 1668), where the rabbinate and the council of the city compelled him {{to give them a}} written confession that all his prophecies were the production of his imagination. The confession was published, whereupon Abraham ha-Yakini, the originator of the Shabbethaian movement, wrote Ghazzati a letter in which he condoled with him over his persecution and expressed his indignation at the acts of the Venetian rabbinate. The Venetian Jews then induced Ghazzati to set out for Livorno, where the Jewish population was known to be inimical to him. They sent an escort with him, ostensibly as a mark of honor, but in reality to prevent him from going elsewhere. He divined <b>their</b> <b>motives</b> in sending him to Livorno, however, and, succeeding in eluding his escort, proceeded to Rome. In spite of his disguise he was recognized there, and was banished from the city. He then went to Livorno voluntarily, and even there made converts to his cause. From Livorno he returned to Adrianople, and seems to have spent the remainder of his days in travel.|$|E

25|$|The {{latest version}} of Los Guerreros was Chavo Guerrero Jr. and the widow of Eddie Guerrero, Vickie Guerrero (they are not {{referred}} to, however, as Los Guerreros). Vickie acted as the manager/valet for Chavo, who was upset about Eddie's name being used by non-Guerreros (namely Rey Mysterio, with whom they maintained their first feud with). The duo used the cheating tactics that made the Guerreros famous, though this time {{to the dismay of}} the audience instead of the delight. It wasn't long after the end of their feud with Rey that Chris Benoit (another close friend of Eddie) started questioning <b>their</b> <b>motives,</b> leading to them feuding with Benoit {{over the course of a}} few short months, with Chavo becoming the number one contender for Benoit's WWE United States Championship, though failing at each opportunity mainly because of Vickie's actions constantly getting him disqualified, leading to Vickie leaving Chavo (she soon after declared in late January in backstage interviews with Kristal Marshall that she would be returning to SmackDown soon, though disappeared off of WWE TV directly after). It wasn't until mid-February at No Way Out 2007 that Chavo became WWE Cruiserweight Champion after emerging victorious in a Cruiserweight Open, which saw him as a surprise entry, pinning Jimmy Wang Yang to eliminate him last and win the title from Gregory Helms, ending Helms' more than a year-long reign.|$|E
25|$|Initially {{the rebels}} {{concealed}} <b>their</b> <b>motives,</b> declaring that {{they intended to}} join the campaign. Yet their failure to arrive ultimately forced Köprülü Mehmed to depart without them, and he set off toward the frontier on 24 June 1658. It {{was only then that}} Abaza Hasan and his compatriots revealed their true intentions by sending an emissary to Sultan Mehmed IV, and declaring that continuing to serve the state was intolerable so long as Köprülü Mehmed was not killed. They stated that their revolt was a response to the grand vizier having killed so many innocent men, and their fear that he would turn on them next. The rebel army then began its march from Konya to Bursa, the premier city of Ottoman Anatolia. Along the way Abaza Hasan issued orders preventing his troops from looting the countryside in an attempt to establish his public image as a fighter for justice. Yet even when his army surrounded Bursa and occupied the nearby towns and villages, the sultan continued to decisively stand behind his grand vizier and reject the demands of the rebels, referring to them as the servants of the Devil. Bursa successfully resisted the rebels throughout thirty days of siege, despite the defection of its commander Kenan Pasha to the rebel side. Abaza Hasan's failure to capture this city proved decisive in undermining the long-term viability of his revolt.|$|E
