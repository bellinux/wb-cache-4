25|$|A general festival for all {{the provinces}} of Sweden is customarily held at Uppsala every nine years. Participation in this festival is {{required}} of everyone. Kings and their subjects, collectively and individually, send their gifts to Uppsala; - and – a thing more cruel than any punishment – those who have already adopted Christianity buy themselves off from these ceremonies. The sacrifice is as follows; of every kind of male creature, nine victims are offered. By the blood of these creatures it is the custom to appease the gods. Their bodies, moreover, are hanged in a grove which is adjacent to the temple. This grove is so sacred {{to the people that}} the separate trees in it are believed to be holy because of the death or putrefaction of the sacrificial victims. There even dogs and horses hang beside human beings. (A certain Christian <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had seen seventy-two of their bodies hanging up together.) The incantations, however, which are usually sung in the performance of a libation of this kind are numerous and disgraceful, and it is better not to speak of them.|$|E
25|$|I {{have not}} seen Chas. Greville's book, but have read {{a good deal of}} it. It is a social outrage. And {{committed}} by one who was always talking of what he called ‘perfect gentlemen.’ I don't think he can figure now in that category. I knew him intimately. He was the vainest being—I don't limit myself to man—that ever existed; and I don't forget Cicero and Lytton Bulwer; but Greville wd. swallow garbage, and required it. Offended selflove is a key to most of his observations. He lent me a volume of his MS. once to read; more modern than these; I found, when he was not scandalous, he was prolix and prosy—a clumsy, wordy writer. The loan was made à propos of the character of Peel, which I drew in George Bentinck's Life, and which, I will presume to say, is the only thing written about Peel wh. has any truth or stuff in it. Greville was not displeased with it, and as a reward, and a treat, <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> wd. confide to me his character of Peel, and he gave me the sacred volume, wh. I bore with me, with trembling awe, from Bruton St. to Grosr Gate. If ever it appears, you, who have taste for style and expression, will, I am sure, agree with me that, as a portrait painter, Greville is not a literary Vandyke or Reynolds; a more verbose, indefinite, unwieldy affair, without a happy expression, never issued from the pen of a fagged subordinate of the daily press.|$|E

500|$|Balzac worked {{these scenes}} from his boyhood—as he did {{many aspects of}} his life and the lives of those around him—into La Comédie Humaine. His time at Vendôme is {{reflected}} in Louis Lambert, his 1832 novel about a young boy studying at an Oratorian grammar school at Vendôme. The narrator says : [...] "He devoured books of every kind, feeding indiscriminately on religious works, history and literature, philosophy and physics. He had <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> found indescribable delight in reading dictionaries for lack of other books." ...|$|E
500|$|Nevertheless, [...] {{with the}} {{primitive}} facilities {{available at the}} time, Ulam and von Neumann did carry out numerical computations {{that led to a}} satisfactory design. This motivated their advocacy of a powerful computational capability at Los Alamos, which began during the war years, continued through the cold war, and still exists. Otto Frisch remembered Ulam as [...] "a brilliant Polish topologist with a charming French wife. At once he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was a pure mathematician who had sunk so low that his latest paper actually contained numbers with decimal points!" ...|$|E

[...] "When Robert returned from travel and <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had just been to a beautiful place, all I could say is, 'take me too!'" [...] she later recalled. Lawrence reluctantly let her go. She immediately started working for Oppenheimer full-time, taking over the disused office of a physics professor who was absent on leave in November 1942.|$|E

Every time I asked the label, they said it was platonic. But I kept hearing complaints from people about her being in the studio with all those men. At 15," [...] Brown said. [...] "you have all those hormones and no brains attached to them." ...|$|E

He could not sleep. So I gave him the tablets." [...] On September 20, a reporter from The Daily Telegraph interviewed Dannemann's brother, Klaus-Peter Dannemann, who stated: [...] " [...] telephoned me on [...] {{and told me that}} [...] took nine sleeping tablets.

Following the conclusion of the lockout, Niederreiter was not invited to the Islanders' training camp and reportedly asked for a trade as a result.
