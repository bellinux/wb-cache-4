40|$|Disk plows {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} tillage tools. <b>Two</b> <b>way</b> (reversible) disk <b>plows</b> can perform continues plowing. So they can save time and costs and hence improve overall efficiency. In this study, a “two-way” disk plow was designed based on a λ-formed straight-line, four-bar linkage (Daniel mechanism). This design contains disk and rear wheel reversing mechanism, stabilization mechanism of the plow, a disk angle adjustment tool and transport condition for safe operation of the mechanism. Disk reversing mechanism was designed based on a geometrical analysis considering working condition of the disk plow. The suitable displacement of the plow’s frame was achieved by dimensional analysis of Daniel mechanism and a derived mathematical equation. The rear wheel mechanism was made by means of adding a slotted link to the previous four-bar linkage. The synthesized five-bar linkage was then analyzed for its kinematical and force conditions. For each analysis, related diagrams were plotted and discussed. This innovation has the advantages of low production cost and maintenance as well as easy operation, because of its design simplicity with minimum mechanical auxiliaries. The modeling and analysis was done by the aid of CATIA software...|$|R

40|$|Plowing is {{the main}} and most {{energy-intensive}} way of primary tillage. The development {{and the introduction of}} the energy-saving ways of the primary tillage are of great scientific and practical interest. In the Azov-Black Engineering Institute, we have developed a combined method of the tillage and a tool using left-hand blades designed to handle the lower layers of the soil. The tool is designed for a layered tillage providing moldboard shallow and mouldboardless shallow (12 [...] . 18 cm) subsurface tillage using the cropping and the offset of the lower layer of soil {{in the direction of the}} daylight surface. The installation of the left-hand blades is designed to decrease the energy intensity of the technological process by reducing the weight of soil treated by the plow body. The aim of this study is to compare the energy assessment of the three ways of the tillage: - Plowing without skimmers; - Plowing with coulters being at the wall of the furrow; - Plowing with a left-hand blades tool. The study has been carried out using a graphical simulation of the shifting of the center of gravity of the soil layer. The assessment of the energy intensity of the technological process has been carried out by the capacity value consumed to shift the center of gravity of the treated layer of soil at the different depths of the tillage. The results of the study have showed that the change of the total quantity of the shifting of the center of gravity of the treated soil layer ranges from 0. 43 [...] . to 0. 67 m in respect of the <b>two</b> first-mentioned <b>ways</b> of <b>plowing,</b> while the same index in respect of the combined tool ranges from 0. 37 [...] . to 0. 55 m. The maximum power consumption of the process is also higher in respect of the <b>two</b> first-mentioned <b>ways</b> of the tillage. The power required to shift the center of gravity of the treated layer in respect of both ways ranges from 0. 6 [...] . to 2. 0 kW., while the same index in respect of the combined method of tillage ranges from 0. 3 [...] . to 0. 9 k...|$|R

40|$|Experimental results giving {{information}} about the mechanisms of the <b>two</b> <b>way</b> memory effect are presented. It is shown that local martensite stabilization and true plastic deformations {{have to be considered}} as undesirable side-effects of training. The experimental results also indicate that the macroscopic <b>two</b> <b>way</b> memory behaviour is, on a microstructural level, associated with a reproducible and stable martensite formation path. The higher the amount of transformation cycles the better becomes the stability and reproducibility. In accordance with the stable path is that the <b>two</b> <b>way</b> memory effect can withstand considerable forces during the forward transformation (the <b>two</b> <b>way</b> memory can do work during cooling). Another consequence is that the maximum attainable <b>two</b> <b>way</b> memory diminishes when the training procedure is preceded by thermal transformation cycles. status: publishe...|$|R
