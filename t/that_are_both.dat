5|$|Oneworld {{has three}} premium status levels—Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald—based on the customer's tier {{status in the}} member airline's frequent-flyer program. Emerald status is the highest level in each member's programme, {{and all of the}} statuses are {{recognised}} by each of the member airlines. The premium statuses have no specific requirements of their own; membership is based solely on the frequent-flyer programs of the individual member airline. Alliance benefits are only available to passengers on scheduled flights <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>both</b> operated and marketed by a member airline.|$|E

Each section is weighted equally in determining the students' composite scores.|$|E
5|$|All Saints' parish {{church was}} rebuilt in 1873 {{and is a}} grade II listed building. James Oglethorpe, {{the founder of the}} state of Georgia, now part of the United States of America, is buried with his wife at the centre of its chancel. The area around the church forms a {{conservation}} area. There is a second church called St Luke's further north on Front Lane. Cranham Hall, the former manor house, is a grade II listed building. There are two community associations <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>both</b> registered charities. The Cranham Community Association operates a broad range of sporting, self-improvement and hobby activities at Cranham Community Centre on Marlborough Gardens. Cranham Social Hall, with a capacity of 100, is separately operated by the Front Lane Community Association, and provides a limited range of activities. The main cultural and entertainment facilities of the borough are located in Hornchurch and Romford.|$|E

5|$|Fossils of Indraloris {{have been}} found only in the Miocene Siwalik fossil beds of India and Pakistan. I.himalayensis is known only from Haritalyangar, a Late Miocene site in the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh. This site has been dated to about 9 million years ago. This site has also yielded Sivaladapis nagrii. Indraloris kamlialensis is known from two sites in the {{province}} of Punjab, Pakistan, <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>both</b> dated to 15.2 million years ago: Y642 and Y682. Sivaladapis palaendicus has also been recorded at both sites, and two lorisids are known from Y682. The unnamed large Indraloris is known from Y642 and an older site, Y801 (16.8 million years old). All are in the Potwar Plateau region.|$|E
5|$|Further, birds {{recall and}} avoid objects <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>both</b> {{conspicuous}} and foul-tasting longer than {{objects that are}} equally foul-tasting but cryptically coloured. This suggests that Wallace's original view, that warning colouration helped to teach predators to avoid prey thus coloured, was correct. However, some birds (inexperienced starlings and domestic chicks) also innately avoid conspicuously coloured objects, as demonstrated using mealworms painted yellow and black to resemble wasps, with dull green controls. This implies that warning coloration works {{at least in part}} by stimulating the evolution of predators to encode the meaning of the warning signal, rather than by requiring each new generation to learn the signal's meaning.|$|E
5|$|Tired of his high-priced {{imported}} livestock {{losing in}} local shows, Glure concocts a dog {{show with a}} special gold cup event that is limited to collies <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>both</b> American Kennel Club blue ribbon winners and capable of completing the tasks of a British working sheep dog trial. Initially, {{it seems like the}} only dog who meets the requirements is Glure's recently purchased blue-merle champion, Lochinvar III; however, the Mistress is able to command Lad through the motions of the trial. Lochinvar works primarily by hand signal, so when Glure accidentally burns his fingers on his cigar while going through the trial, the dog stops working and waits for Glure's hand-shaking to be explained. The dog is disqualified and Lad is declared the winner. The Master and Mistress donate the gold cup to the Red Cross in his name.|$|E

5|$|Van der Weyden was {{strongly}} influenced by Jan van Eyck, and the painting {{is very similar to}} the earlier Madonna of Chancellor Rolin, usually dated to around 1434, with significant differences. The figure's positioning and colourisation are reversed, and Luke takes centre stage; his face is accepted as van der Weyden's self-portrait. Three near contemporary versions are in the Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg, the Alte Pinakothek, Munich, and the Groeningemuseum, Bruges. The Boston panel is widely considered the original from underdrawings <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>both</b> heavily reworked and absent in other versions.

25|$|Binary stars <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>both</b> {{visual and}} spectroscopic {{binaries}} are rare, {{and are a}} valuable source of information when found. About 40 are known. Visual binary stars often have large true separations, with periods measured in decades to centuries; consequently, they usually have orbital speeds {{too small to be}} measured spectroscopically. Conversely, spectroscopic binary stars move fast in their orbits because they are close together, usually too close to be detected as visual binaries. Binaries <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>both</b> visual and spectroscopic thus must be relatively close to Earth.|$|E
