All three members of what {{came to be known as}} the Brundage Commission were from the Western Hemisphere and met in New Orleans in January 1949. The commission found that there was nothing <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>gained</b> <b>by</b> recognizing the 1906 games as Olympic, and it might set an embarrassing precedent. The full IOC endorsed the report when it met later that year in Rome.|$|E

On the contrary, we think that the peace and dignity of the state, which all criminal prosecutions are brought to redress, will be the better conserved by the entry of a nolle prosequi herein. Such a course is suggested to the Attorney General.|$|E
25|$|With {{the eastern}} {{frontier}} now finally secured, Vienna could flourish (Vienna gloriosa) and expand beyond its traditional limits. In the east Leopold was learning {{that there was}} little <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>gained</b> <b>by</b> harsh measures, which policy bought his acceptance and he granted the Hungarian diet rights through the Diploma Leopoldianum of 1691. However, on the military front, this merely freed up Austria to engage in further western European wars. Austria was becoming more involved in competition with France in Western Europe, fighting the French in the War of the League of Augsburg (1688–1697).|$|E

25|$|Irish {{people at}} home were facing {{discrimination}} from Great Britain based on the former's religion. Evictions only increased after {{the repeal of the}} British Corn Laws in 1846 and the new Encumbered Estates Act being passed in 1849 as well as the removal of existing civil rights. There had been agrarian terrorism against landlords which these new laws were implemented to stop the retribution. Any hope for change was squashed with the death of Daniel O'Connell in 1847, the political leader championing for Ireland, and the failed rising of the Young Irelanders in 1848. More was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>gained</b> <b>by</b> immigrating to America from Ireland and the 1848 discovery of gold in the Sierra Nevada lured away more.|$|E
25|$|From {{the death}} of Augustus (14 AD) until after 70 AD, Rome {{accepted}} as her Germanic frontier the water-boundary of the Rhine and upper Danube. Beyond these rivers she held only the fertile plain of Frankfurt, opposite the Roman border fortress of Moguntiacum (Mainz), the southernmost slopes of the Black Forest and a few scattered bridge-heads. The northern section of this frontier, where the Rhine is deep and broad, remained the Roman boundary until the empire fell. The southern part was different. The upper Rhine and upper Danube are easily crossed. The frontier which they form is inconveniently long, enclosing an acute-angled wedge of foreign territory between the modern Baden and Württemberg. The Germanic populations of these lands seem in Roman times to have been scanty, and Roman subjects from the modern Alsace-Lorraine had drifted across the river eastwards. The motives alike of geographical convenience and of the advantages <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>gained</b> <b>by</b> recognising these movements of Roman subjects combined to urge a forward policy at Rome, and when the vigorous Vespasian had succeeded Nero, a series of advances began which gradually closed up the acute angle, or at least rendered it obtuse.|$|E
500|$|Though Jackson {{considered}} the ending [...] "overwrought", {{he felt that}} it [...] "pulled the rug"; [...] "turning on a sixpence, the screams of 'Kathy' turned truly horrifying; the tackiness suddenly real and disturbing". Mellor {{considered the}} ending [...] "a terrific twist {{as long as you}} didn’t look at it too closely", arguing that the interviewer's patience and the crew's collusion were unlikely. However, she suggested, there is little <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>gained</b> <b>by</b> criticising these aspects of the episode. For Baylis, the ending was unexpected, revealing [...] "darkness of the shabby human kind". In the closing seconds of the episode, he said, [...] "we suddenly saw it all, without seeing anything".|$|E

500|$|The C {{was soon}} {{absorbed into the}} United New Jersey Railroad and Canal Company (1869) which itself was merged into the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) in 1871. [...] The PRR saw the {{potential}} publicity <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>gained</b> <b>by</b> exhibiting such an old engine, showing it at the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia; PRR workshop staff then [...] "back-dated" [...] the engine (by replacing some original parts with parts that [...] "looked" [...] old or by removing them entirely). The exhaust stack was replaced with a straight tube of metal and the cab walls and roof were removed. The PRR then exhibited the engine in 1883 at the National Railway Appliance Exhibition in Chicago, Illinois. [...] In 1885, the Smithsonian Institution accepted the donation of the John Bull from the PRR as the Institution's first large engineering artifact.|$|E
500|$|During 1931, NSS {{was busy}} closing shipyards {{elsewhere}} in the country, while an order from the Admiralty for two destroyers kept Palmer's working until mid-1932. The second of these ships, , was the last ship launched from the yard, on 19 July 1932. [...] By this time, Palmer's was insolvent, but retained a faint hope of further naval contracts. These failed to materialise, and in June 1933 the firm's creditors appointed a receiver. By December 1933 rumours of NSS interest in the yard were appearing in the press, and in the House of Commons Walter Runciman, the President of the Board of Trade, told members: [...] "There is nothing <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>gained</b> <b>by</b> giving Jarrow the impression that Palmer's can be revived". He continued: [...] "Would it not be very much better to make a clean sweep of that as a shipyard, and throw open to the world for sale what {{is one of the}} finest and most convenient sites anywhere in Europe?" [...] Despite efforts by management and workers to find an alternative solution, in the early summer of 1934 NSS acquired the yard, closed it, and began to dismantle its plant. Blythe wrote: [...] "The only sound to compete with the unfamiliar noise of the marsh birds... was the ring of the breakers' hammers." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{risks of}} Operation Barras were {{acknowledged}} by the MoD and by officers {{involved in the}} planning and the assault. It was described by an SAS soldier as [...] "not a clinical, black balaclava, Princes Gate type operation. It was a very grubby, green operation with lots of potential for things to go wrong". Richard Connaughton observed in the journal Small Wars & Insurgencies that the operation showed that Tony Blair's government was not averse {{to the possibility of}} casualties where they felt the cause was just. Geoff Hoon, British Secretary of State for Defence, summed up the effect of the operation at a press conference, stating that [...] " [...] sends a number of powerful messages. Firstly, it is a yet further demonstration of the refusal of successive British governments to do deals with terrorists and hostage takers. Secondly, we hope the West Side Group [...] and other rebel units in Sierra Leone will now [...] accept {{the rule of law and}} the authority of the democratically elected government of Sierra Leone. Thirdly, we hope all those who may in future consider taking similar actions against UK armed forces will think carefully about the possible consequences and realise there is nothing <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>gained</b> <b>by</b> such action". Andrew M. Dorman of King's College London suggested that the fate of the wider British operation in Sierra Leone depended heavily on the success or failure of Operation Barras and that, had the British forces been defeated, the United Kingdom would have been forced to withdraw all its forces from Sierra Leone. Dorman also suggests that a defeat would have [...] "raised questions" [...] regarding Tony Blair's policy of using armed force for humanitarian intervention.|$|E

2500|$|Grinnell, George Melendez Wright, {{a student}} of Grinnell's, and others objected to the {{predator}} control policy. Grinnell argued that, [...] "As a rule, predaceous animals should be left unmolested and allowed to retain their primitive relation {{to the rest of}} the fauna ... as their number is already kept within proper limits by the available food supply, nothing is <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>gained</b> <b>by</b> reducing it still further." [...] But trapping of rare animals for scientific study was an exception, he added [...] "A justifiable exception may be made when specimens are required for scientific purposes by authorized representatives of public institutions, and it should be remarked in this connection that without a scientific investigation of the animal life in the parks, and an extensive collection of specimens, no thorough understanding of the conditions or of the practical problems they involve is possible." ...|$|E
2500|$|Members of the Joint Fact Finding Team {{appointed}} by Habibie believed their mandate for seeking the truth behind the violence included drawing conclusions and making recommendations. Although {{they were given}} access {{to members of the}} military elite, their findings came into conflict with the military and the government. Unwilling to let go of [...] "the power <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>gained</b> <b>by</b> having a monopoly over ... 'representations' of the violence", government officials and the military elite inside and outside Suharto's circle rejected or ignored the team's findings. Sections of the report were also challenged by the national media. The People's Representative Council ( [...] , DPR) eventually declared the riots [...] "ordinary crimes" [...] during the Megawati administration (2001–2004). The collapse of Suharto's government also led to the intensification of separatist movements in the outlying provinces of Aceh, Papua, and East Timor. Ethnic and religious conflicts also flared in Maluku and Central Sulawesi as law and order deteriorated. In a January 1999 poll by daily newspaper The Jakarta Post, 77 percent of respondents rated public safety levels as bad or very bad. Economic conditions continued to fluctuate in {{the first few months of}} Habibie's presidency, and the National Police reported that crime increased by 10 percent during 1998.|$|E

The German light cruisers had only [...] guns, which had left Glasgow relatively unscathed, but these were now joined by the 8.2-inch guns of Gneisenau. Luce determined that nothing was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>gained</b> <b>by</b> staying and attempting to fight.
