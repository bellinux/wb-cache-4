5|$|The train's {{derailment}} caused {{severe damage}} to the Overhead Line Equipment and tripped the entire circuit between Brock (near Preston) and Tebay resulting {{in a number of}} other electric-powered services coming <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>halt</b> <b>and</b> all signalling equipment immediately turning to danger (red) in accordance with the system's fail safe design.|$|E
5|$|On 3 April 1970, a B-52D {{assigned}} to the 28th Bomb Wing caught fire and crashed while landing at Ellsworth Air Force Base, South Dakota; sliding <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>halt</b> <b>and</b> burning atop a 25,000 gallon fuel storage tank. Efforts by fire department personnel saved the 9 man crew and prevented a catastrophic explosion of the fuel tank.|$|E
5|$|Before the war, New Albany was {{the largest}} city in the state, mainly because of its river {{contacts}} and extensive trade with the South. Over half of Hoosiers with over $100,000 lived in New Albany. During the war, the trade with the South came <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>halt,</b> <b>and</b> many residents considered those of New Albany as too friendly to the South. The city never regained its stature. It was stilled as a city of 40,000 with its early-Victorian Mansion-Row buildings remaining from the boom period.|$|E

5|$|The {{fight was}} one of the first {{victories}} for American forces in repelling the North Korean advance. In stopping the North Korean advance at the Notch and around Masan, the UN forces were able to halt the progress of the North Korean 4th and 6th Divisions, grounding their flanking moves <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>halt</b> <b>and</b> forcing them to withdraw to rebuild and re-supply. In the meantime, the American forces along the perimeter were being reinforced by heavier infantry and armor formations every day. The North Korean defeat and retreat around the Masan region allowed both sides several critical days of reprieve from battle. This would end when the North Korean force began its final offensive on the UN forces in its coordinated assault on the Pusan Perimeter.|$|E
5|$|With the {{outbreak}} of the First World War, all WSPU activity came <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>halt</b> <b>and</b> the NUWSS turned much of their focus to relief work. The WPSU, reformed as the Women's Party from 1917, sent members across Wales, no longer to rally for suffrage but to encourage male volunteers to join the British Army. In 1915 Flora Drummond attended a rally in Merthyr to demand that men leave occupations that women could undertake, and to stop 'hiding behind the petticoats'. Women in Wales took up employment en masse, especially in newly opened munitions factories, and in 1918 the Newport Shell Factory had a female workforce of 83 per cent while the Queensferry factory was 70 per cent.|$|E
5|$|Amatoxins {{consist of}} at least eight {{compounds}} with a similar structure, that of eight amino-acid rings; they were isolated in 1941 by Heinrich O. Wieland and Rudolf Hallermayer of the University of Munich. Of the amatoxins, α-amanitin is the chief component and along with β-amanitin is likely responsible for the toxic effects. Their major toxic mechanism is the inhibition of RNA polymerase II, a vital enzyme in the synthesis of messenger RNA (mRNA), microRNA, and small nuclear RNA (snRNA). Without mRNA, essential protein synthesis and hence cell metabolism grind <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>halt</b> <b>and</b> the cell dies. The liver is the principal organ affected, {{as it is the}} organ which is first encountered after absorption in the gastrointestinal tract, though other organs, especially the kidneys, are susceptible. The RNA polymerase of Amanita phalloides is insensitive to the effects of amatoxins, so the mushroom does not poison itself.|$|E

5|$|When {{producing}} a particular chocolate {{for the first}} time, a mini-game is played where ingredients are fired from a cannon to fill circular trays which revolve around the cannon. The ingredients and quantities needed vary, depending on the recipe. Each time a circle {{is filled with the}} correct ingredients, it is removed and an empty circle put in its place. The trays spin faster as more circles are filled. If too many ingredients are wasted by misfiring the cannon, production is brought <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>halt</b> <b>and</b> the mini-game must be attempted again. The mini-game ends when the timer runs out; the number of completed circles is equal to the number of chocolates produced by that factory every week. The mini-game cannot be played unless the player owns the correct ingredients, and it can be replayed if the player wishes to try to improve the efficiency of the factory. Playing the mini-game advances in-game time by one week. Different chocolate types, such as truffles and squares, require the factory to be upgraded first, costing money.|$|E
5|$|Wien Air Alaska, {{which had}} its {{headquarters}} in Fairbanks, was the state's largest private employer until it declared bankruptcy in 1983. The resulting shutdown cost hundreds of jobs in Fairbanks. This was a foretaste of more problems to come. In 1986, Saudi Arabia boosted oil production and oil prices plummeted. Alaska banks failed, construction came <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>halt,</b> <b>and</b> bankruptcies and foreclosures were common. A common practice in Fairbanks was for workers to drop their house keys off at local banks before catching a flight out of Alaska, the better to speed the foreclosure process. Although an expansion of Fort Wainwright helped the construction industry during this time, Fairbanks lost about 3,000 jobs between 1986 and 1989. The U.S. Army's 6th Infantry Division was stationed at Fort Wainwright in late 1987, but it {{was reduced to a}} single brigade and renamed in 1993.|$|E
5|$|Before his death, Mr. Nobody {{tells the}} {{journalist}} {{that neither of}} them exist. They are figments {{in the mind of}} the 9-year-old Nemo at the train station, as he was forced to make an impossible choice. The young boy tries to find the correct decision, following each choice to its conclusion. Eventually, the boy takes a third option: to not make the choice at all. He leaves both parents and runs away towards an unknown future. This ambiguous choice somehow leads to him and Anna reuniting happily. The film returns to old Nemo on his death bed. The calculated time arrives and Mr. Nobody's last words are watched by the world. The expansion of the universe comes <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>halt</b> <b>and</b> time appears to reverse. The universe ceases to dissipate, and finally begins contracting. Consequently, Nemo's life simplifies itself. He is able to return to his childhood, watch his parents get back together and be with Anna. The 118-year-old man cackles triumphantly as he springs back into awareness with the realization that his younger self has finally found his one true love and life.|$|E
6000|$|The train, panting, wheezing, {{hot with}} speed, came <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{creeping}} <b>halt,</b> <b>and</b> the conductor, swinging out upon the side track, greeted the ranger pleasantly. [...] "Hello, Hans! What {{are you doing}} here?" ...|$|R
60|$|The negroes {{came out}} of the cottage and made after them, but only for a short distance. Then they came <b>to</b> <b>a</b> sudden <b>halt,</b> <b>and</b> after <b>a</b> brief consultation, hurried back to the cottage.|$|R

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Battle of Onjong, the Chinese recognized the ROK II Corps as the most vulnerable unit of the Eighth Army. Besides lacking the firepower of their US counterpart, the ROK II Corps also held the most difficult terrain on the UN right flank. At 10 a.m. on November 24, the ROK 7th Infantry Division on the II Corps' left flank attacked north from Tokchon. At the same time, the ROK 8th Infantry Division on the II Corps' right flank advanced north from Yongwon. The stubborn defenses by the PVA 38th and 42nd Corps soon ground the Korean advances <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>halt,</b> <b>and</b> the continuous fighting for the next two days failed to create any gains for the Koreans. During the advances, the Chinese defenses managed to create a wedge {{in the center of the}} ROK 7th Infantry Division, forcing the division to commit most of its reserves on the front line. Meanwhile, the ROK 6th Infantry Division in the II Corps' rear could only offer its 2nd Infantry Regiment as the corps' reserve due to the earlier losses at Onjong.|$|E
5|$|Throughout July, the battalion's {{companies}} were detached to support individual Australian brigades during the First Battle of El Alamein as the Allied forces– which had, {{since the beginning}} of the year, been steadily pushed back by the German and Italian forces– fought desperately to stop the German advance east towards Cairo. Supporting the infantry battalions fighting around Tel el Eisa in early July, several of the battalion's crews played significant roles in turning back attacks on the Australian positions, and in concert with divisional artillery were reported to have inflicted heavy casualties upon the German and Italian soldiers. Later, in the middle of the month, they supported an attack by the 2/32nd Infantry Battalion, now commanded by the 2/2nd's old commander, Whitehead, around Makh Khad Ridge to the right of the Qattara Track. By the end of the month the offensive had come <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>halt</b> <b>and</b> during the lull that followed the battalion provided defensive fire from depth positions. In October, it joined the second Allied counter-attack that was launched during the Second Battle of El Alamein. During these battles, the battalion was heavily engaged, with a company supporting a composite force under Whitehead, and another operating in support of the 24th Brigade. Its casualties amounted to 21 killed, 128 wounded and 26 captured.|$|E
25|$|Cartañá {{was working}} on new {{material}} independently and working towards a full Spanish album {{which was to be}} sprinkled with all her past influences.

60|$|Thus commanded, {{the mare}} moved forward once more, {{but this time}} much slower. Once or twice her feet seemed to stick fast, but Pawnee Brown did not notice this. At last she came <b>to</b> <b>a</b> dead <b>halt</b> <b>and</b> would not go another step.|$|R
25|$|The {{economic}} crisis {{that had already}} affected the development of Brazilian nuclear project in the 1980s continued through the 1990s. Nuclear activities slowed down, the program for developing the nuclear submarine ground <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>halt</b> <b>and</b> plans to build two additional nuclear power plants were put on hold. Only in 1994 did the Brazilian government decide to resume construction of Angra 2.|$|E
25|$|As Davies's first attack ground <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>halt,</b> <b>and</b> {{the attack}} of Irvin Gregg's brigade failed to {{dislodge}} the Confederates, David Gregg sent for reinforcements from Sheridan, who released two brigades from Torbert's division. Torbert's reserve brigade under Brig. Gen. Wesley Merritt extended Gregg's {{line to the}} right, thwarting a flanking maneuver attempted by Hampton with Chambliss's newly arrived brigade.|$|E
25|$|When escape seemed unlikely, Seringapatam changed {{course and}} {{appeared}} to be making an attack run on Greenwich but the latter came <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>halt</b> <b>and</b> waited for Georgiana to come up and provide assistance. At this point, four men were transferred from Georgiana to Greenwich so Captain Stavers chose to break off the attack and continue fleeing. Lieutenant Gamble closed the distance between the two ships and he first demanded that the British surrender. But when the Americans came within pistol range, Seringapatam raised her colors and fired a powerful broadside.|$|E
25|$|But in 1880 {{the golden}} {{years of the}} {{partnership}} came <b>to</b> <b>an</b> abrupt <b>halt</b> <b>and</b> they were declared bankrupt.

50|$|In 2007, {{construction}} {{began on}} a mega-mall, named Meadowlands Xanadu. Work came <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>halt</b> in 2009, <b>and</b> Triple Five, {{owners of the}} Mall of America, took over the project in 2011.|$|R
25|$|Characterized as an aloof {{politician}} {{with little}} {{support from the}} Legislature by the San Francisco, Sacramento and Los Angeles press, Burnett grew frustrated as his agenda ground <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>halt,</b> <b>and</b> his governance style increasingly criticized. He became a regular fixture of ridicule in the state's newspapers and {{on the floor of}} the Legislature. With little over a year in office, Burnett, the first governor of the state, became the first to resign, announcing his resignation in January 1851. Burnett cited personal matters for his departure. Lieutenant Governor John McDougall replaced Burnett as the Governor of California on 9 January.|$|E

Torbert's reserve brigade under Brig. Gen. Wesley Merritt extended Gregg's {{line to the}} right, thwarting a flanking maneuver attempted by Hampton with Chambliss's newly arrived brigade. There was plenty of infantry nearby {{that could have been}} called for reinforcements, with Hancock's II Corps dug in about one mile to the north, and there are disagreements between Sheridan's memoirs and historians about whether he asked for such reinforcements.|$|E
25|$|Several drug therapies {{are being}} {{developed}} based on p53, the tumour suppressor gene that protects the cell in response to damage and stress. It is analogous to deciding {{what to do with}} a damaged car: p53 brings everything <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>halt,</b> <b>and</b> then decides whether to fix the cell or, if the cell is beyond repair, to destroy the cell. This protective function of p53 is disabled in most cancer cells, allowing them to multiply without check. Restoration of p53 activity in tumours (where possible) has been shown to inhibit tumour growth and can even shrink the tumour.|$|E
50|$|In {{the face}} of such {{contradictory}} policy pronouncements and uncertain political currents, administrators and economic decision makers at all levels were virtually paralyzed.
