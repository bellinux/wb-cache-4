5|$|New to the Forza {{series is}} a feature known as Autovista. It is {{designed}} to allow players to walk around and explore inside cars. This feature allows players to view minute details such as brake pads, engine components, and interior details. The player can point at certain features, such as headlights, wheels and the engine for further information about them via audio recording. It can be controlled via Kinect or a game controller. Only 24 cars in the game support the Autovista feature, as it is primarily for sports cars, classic cars, and dream cars. The graphics used to create these cars are formed using image-based lighting which allowed the developers to create perfect reflections, and would better immerse {{the car in the}} environment both when racing on a track or in the garage or <b>Top</b> <b>Gear</b> studio when viewing a car.|$|E
5|$|Prior to filming, Clarkson's {{contract}} was not renewed by the BBC {{after he was}} involved in an altercation with a <b>Top</b> <b>Gear</b> producer in March 2015, leaving Hammond, May, and Wilman to follow him in departing the show following the end of the series.
