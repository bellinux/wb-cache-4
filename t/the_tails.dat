5|$|A {{pathology}} {{has been}} identified on the tail of Apatosaurus, caused by a growth defect. Two caudal vertebrae are seamlessly fused along the entire articulating surface of the bone, including the arches of the neural spines. This defect might {{have been caused by}} the lack or inhibition of the substance that forms intervertebral disks or joints. It has been proposed that the whips could have been used in combat, but <b>the</b> <b>tails</b> of diplodocids were quite light and narrow compared to Shunosaurus and mamenchisaurids, and thus to injure another animal with the tail would severely injure the tail itself.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of a tidal shock, streams of stars can be pulled away from the cluster halo, leaving only the core part of the cluster. These tidal {{interaction}} effects create tails of stars that can extend up to several degrees of arc away from the cluster. These tails typically both precede and follow the cluster along its orbit. <b>The</b> <b>tails</b> can accumulate significant portions of the original mass of the cluster, and can form clumplike features.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>tail</b> {{rotor drive}} system {{consists}} of a shaft powered from the main transmission and a gearbox mounted {{at the end of}} <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> boom. <b>The</b> drive shaft may consist of one long shaft or a series of shorter shafts connected at both ends with flexible couplings, that allow the drive shaft to flex with <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> boom. <b>The</b> gearbox {{at the end of the}} tailboom provides an angled drive for <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> rotor and may also include gearing to adjust the output to the optimum rotational speed for <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> rotor, measured in rotations per minute (RPM). On larger helicopters with a tail pylon, intermediate gearboxes are used to transition <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> rotor drive shaft from along the tailboom to the top of <b>the</b> pylon. <b>The</b> <b>tail</b> rotor pylon may also serve as a vertical stabilizing airfoil, to alleviate the power requirement for <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> rotor in forward flight. <b>The</b> <b>tail</b> rotor pylon may also serve to provide limited antitorque within certain airspeed ranges, in the event that <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> rotor or <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> rotor flight controls fail. About 10% of the engine power goes to <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> rotor.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>tail</b> force is, therefore:where [...] is <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> area, [...] is <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> force coefficient, [...] is the {{elevator}} deflection, and [...] is the downwash angle.|$|R
50|$|Tails are not {{pulled at}} the dock, so {{that it may be}} braided, and the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> is left natural in US competition, not trimmed. <b>The</b> <b>tail</b> is braided from the top down to the end of <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> bone, with <b>the</b> rest of <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> left loose.|$|R
5|$|Avialans diversified into a {{wide variety}} of forms during the Cretaceous Period. Many groups {{retained}} primitive characteristics, such as clawed wings and teeth, though the latter were lost independently in a number of avialan groups, including modern birds (Aves). While the earliest forms, such as Archaeopteryx and Jeholornis, retained the long bony tails of their ancestors, <b>the</b> <b>tails</b> of more advanced avialans were shortened {{with the advent of the}} pygostyle bone in the group Pygostylia. In the late Cretaceous, around 95 million years ago, the ancestor of all modern birds also evolved a better sense of smell.|$|E
5|$|Hot Jupiters, due {{to their}} extreme proximities to their host stars, {{have been shown to}} be losing their atmospheres into space due to stellar radiation, much like <b>the</b> <b>tails</b> of comets. These planets may have vast {{differences}} in temperature between their day and night sides that produce supersonic winds, although the day and night sides of HD 189733 b appear to have very similar temperatures, indicating that that planet's atmosphere effectively redistributes the star's energy around the planet.|$|E
5|$|In some archaea, the {{lipid bilayer}} is {{replaced}} by a monolayer. In effect, the archaea fuse <b>the</b> <b>tails</b> of two phospholipid molecules into a single molecule with two polar heads (a bolaamphiphile); this fusion may make their membranes more rigid and better able to resist harsh environments. For example, the lipids in Ferroplasma are of this type, which is thought to aid this organism's survival in its highly acidic habitat.|$|E
50|$|Alternately, a dolorimeter with a {{resistance}} wire with a constant heat flow may be used. For <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> flick test, <b>the</b> wire {{is attached to}} <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> of <b>the</b> organism, and the wire applies heat to <b>the</b> <b>tail.</b> <b>The</b> researcher then records <b>the</b> latency to <b>tail</b> flick.|$|R
25|$|There {{are only}} a few muscles in the trunk and <b>the</b> <b>tail,</b> but they are very strong and are {{essential}} for the bird. The pygostyle controls all the movement in <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> and controls <b>the</b> feathers in <b>the</b> <b>tail.</b> This gives <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> a larger surface area which helps keep the bird in the air.|$|R
50|$|The tailhead or dock is the {{beginning}} of <b>the</b> <b>tail,</b> where <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> joins <b>the</b> rump. It is known also as the base or root of <b>the</b> <b>tail,</b> and corresponds to the human sacrococcygeal symphysis. In some mammals <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> may be said to consist of the tailbone (meaning the bony column, muscles, and skin) and the skirt (meaning the long hairs growing from the tailbone). In birds, similarly, <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> consists of tailbone and tailfan (tail fan).|$|R
5|$|Rudimentary organs such as {{the human}} tailbone, now much reduced from their {{functional}} state, are readily understood as signs of evolution, the explanation being that they were cut down by natural selection from functioning organs when their functions were no longer needed, but make {{no sense at all}} if species are considered to be fixed. The tailbone is homologous to <b>the</b> <b>tails</b> of other primates.|$|E
5|$|Skis used in {{cross-country}} are {{lighter and}} narrower than {{those used in}} alpine skiing. Ski bottoms are {{designed to provide a}} gliding surface and, for classic skis, a traction zone under foot. The base of the gliding surface is a plastic material that is designed both to minimize friction and, in many cases, to accept waxes. Glide wax may be used on <b>the</b> <b>tails</b> and tips of classic skis and across the length of skate skis.|$|E
5|$|The Han Chinese also {{employed}} chemical warfare. In quelling {{a peasant}} revolt near Guiyang in 178 CE, the imperial Han forces had horse-drawn chariots carrying bellows {{that were used}} to pump powdered lime (calcium oxide) at the rebels, who were dispersed. In this same instance, they also lit incendiary rags tied to <b>the</b> <b>tails</b> of horses, so that the frightened horses would rush through the enemy lines and disrupt their formations.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>tail</b> {{is thick}} {{and strong and}} set on {{at the end of}} the top line. <b>The</b> <b>tail</b> should be at least long enough to reach to the hock joint. <b>The</b> <b>tail</b> may be loosely curled over the back or carried over the back in a sickle position. The hair on the {{underside}} of <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> is thick, stiff, abundant, and twice as long as the coat on the shoulders, which causes the hair to fan outward when <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> is up.|$|R
50|$|Make a bight in <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> end of <b>the</b> rope. Wrap {{the working}} end around <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> toward <b>the</b> bight end, with {{multiple}} turns. Complete the knot by passing <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> end through <b>the</b> bight loop.|$|R
40|$|The mouse {{transcription}} factor Noto {{is expressed in}} the notochord and involved in its development. Noto mouse mutants, Noto(tc/tc) (truncate) and Noto(GFP/GFP) (Noto null mutant), exhibit a segmental lack of the notochord in the caudal part of the embryo and subsequent tail truncation in adult animals. In order to address the relationship between <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> bud (<b>the</b> undifferentiated mesenchymal cells in the tip of <b>the</b> embryo <b>tail)</b> and <b>the</b> caudal notochord, Noto(GFP/GFP), a loss- of-function mutant, was analyzed. Taking advantage of Noto(GFP/+) heterozygotes, we could track Noto-GFP-expressing cells from <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> bud over <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> cord to <b>the</b> caudal notochord, and confirm a morphological continuum from <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> bud mesenchyme to the caudal notochord. Loss of Noto affected tail bud morphogenesis: Noto-GFP-expressing cells were scattered in <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> bud mesenchyme. They segregated in the notochord-like structure within the medullary cord instead at <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> cord, which subsequently disappeared. In <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> cord, instead of the notochord, additional lumen of <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> gut was formed. These findings suggest that Noto is involved in both rearrangement and morphogenesis of <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> bud during notochord formation.

5|$|The Red Tail Squadron, {{part of the}} {{non-profit}} Commemorative Air Force (CAF) and until June 2011, known as the Red Tail Project, maintains and flies a World War II era North American P-51C Mustang. The twice-restored aircraft flies to create interest in the history and accomplishments {{of the members of}} the World War II-era 332nd Fighter Group, also known as the Tuskegee Airmen, whose distinctive red markings on <b>the</b> <b>tails</b> of the P-51s they flew during that war, gave the organization its name.|$|E
5|$|Scaly-tailed {{squirrels}} {{and flying}} squirrels, although not closely related, can both glide {{from tree to}} tree using parachute-like membranes that stretch from the fore to the hind limbs. The agouti is fleet-footed and antelope-like, being digitigrade and having hoof-like nails. The majority of rodents have tails, which can be of many shapes and sizes. Some tails are prehensile, as in the Eurasian harvest mouse, and the fur on <b>the</b> <b>tails</b> can vary from bushy to completely bald. The tail is sometimes used for communication, as when beavers slap their tails on the water surface or house mice rattle their tails to indicate alarm. Some species have vestigial tails or no tails at all. In some species, the tail is capable of regeneration if a part is broken off.|$|E
5|$|The Pembroke is {{the more}} popular breed of dog, with the Cardigan Welsh Corgi {{appearing}} on The Kennel Club's list of Vulnerable Native Breeds. There are several physical {{differences between the two}} types according to the breed standards: the Cardigan is larger overall, both in weight and in height. Traditionally, <b>the</b> <b>tails</b> were of different shapes, but docking had previously been used. With regards to their health, according to a 2004 survey, they both had similar lifespans, although kidney or urethral conditions are more likely in the Pembrokes. Furthermore, Pembroke Corgis {{were more likely to have}} eye problems than the Cardigan breed. Welsh Corgis have a strong association with Queen Elizabeth II, who has personally owned more than 30 dogs, either Pembrokes or Corgi/Dachshund crosses.|$|E
50|$|The fur {{continues}} on along <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> of this possum but abruptly stops once the distal portion of <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> is reached {{to reveal a}} hairless tail. This naked part of <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> is dark much like its face and is a bit rugose but since it is also prehensile, it allows for <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> {{to be used for}} gripping.|$|R
50|$|When the {{trailing}} vortices colliding with <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> rotor are rotating {{in the same}} direction, this causes a loss of thrust from <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> rotor. When <b>the</b> trailing vortices rotate {{in the opposite direction}} of <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> rotor, thrust is increased. Use of the foot pedals is required to adjust <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> rotor's angle of attack, to compensate for these instabilities.|$|R
5000|$|In modern times, {{the term}} [...] "docked" [...] or [...] "docking" [...] in {{reference}} to <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> of a horse generally refers {{to the practice of}} cutting the hair of <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> skirt very short, just past the end of the natural dock of <b>the</b> <b>tail.</b> In particular, <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> is often cut short to keep it from being tangled in a harness.|$|R
5|$|Woodpeckers, piculets and wrynecks all possess {{characteristic}} zygodactyl feet, {{consisting of}} four toes, the first (hallux) {{and the fourth}} facing backward and {{the second and third}} facing forward. This foot arrangement is good for grasping the limbs and trunks of trees. Members of this family can walk vertically up a tree trunk, which is beneficial for activities such as foraging for food or nest excavation. In addition to their strong claws and feet, woodpeckers have short, strong legs. This is typical of birds that regularly forage on trunks. Exceptions are the black-backed woodpecker and the American and Eurasian three-toed woodpeckers, which have only three toes on each foot. <b>The</b> <b>tails</b> of all woodpeckers, except the piculets and wrynecks, are stiffened, and when the bird perches on a vertical surface, the tail and feet work together to support it.|$|E
5|$|The gray wolf's {{expressive}} {{behavior is}} more complex than that of the coyote and golden jackal, as necessitated by its group living and hunting habits. While less gregarious canids generally possess simple repertoires of visual signals, wolves have more varied signals that subtly inter grade in intensity. When neutral, the legs are not stiffened, the tail hangs down loosely, the face is smooth, the lips untensed, and the ears point in no particular direction. Postural communication in wolves consists of a variety of facial expressions, tail positions and piloerection. Aggressive, or self-assertive wolves are characterized by their slow and deliberate movements, high body posture and raised hackles, while submissive ones carry their bodies low, sleeken their fur and lower their ears and tail. When a breeding male encounters a subordinate family member, it may stare at it, standing erect and still with <b>the</b> <b>tails</b> horizontal to its spine. Two forms of submissive behavior are recognized: passive and active. Passive submission usually occurs as a reaction to the approach of a dominant animal, and consists of the submissive wolf lying partly on its back and allowing the dominant wolf to sniff its anogenital area. Active submission occurs often as a form of greeting, and involves the submissive wolf approaching another in a low posture, and licking the other wolf's face. When wolves are together, they commonly indulge in behaviors such as nose pushing, jaw wrestling, cheek rubbing and facial licking. The mouthing of each other's muzzles is a friendly gesture, while clamping on the muzzle with bared teeth is a dominance display.|$|E
25|$|The common rose {{is often}} the {{preferred}} species to show the amateur naturalist the utility of <b>the</b> <b>tails</b> in steering. This can be most easily observed when the common rose hovers over flowers to sip nectar. Then, its forewings beat readily to give it buoyancy while <b>the</b> <b>tails</b> move delicately to steer and adjust its position.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>tail</b> of Pamelaria {{is thick}} and heavy, {{possibly}} {{acting as a}} counterbalance to the long neck. <b>The</b> <b>tail</b> is tall near its base due to high neural arches above the vertebrae and long chevrons below them. Long sacral and caudal ribs restricted lateral movement, making most of <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> inflexible. <b>The</b> shape of the femur (upper leg bone) indicates that Pamelaria had large caudofemoralis muscles that further restricted <b>the</b> <b>tail's</b> movement (caudofemoralis muscles anchor {{to the base of}} <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> and insert into the femur).|$|R
50|$|In a G/G/2 queue with {{heavy-tailed}} job sizes, <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> of <b>the</b> {{delay time}} distribution {{is known to}} behave like <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> of an exponential distribution squared under low loads and like <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> of an exponential distribution for high loads.|$|R
50|$|The thunniform group {{contains}} high-speed long-distance swimmers, and is {{a unique}} trait (an autapomorphy) of the tunas. Here, virtually all the sideways movement is in <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> and <b>the</b> region connecting the main body to <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> (<b>the</b> peduncle). <b>The</b> <b>tail</b> itself tends to be large and crescent shaped.|$|R
25|$|In {{the case}} of the T4 phage, the {{construction}} of new virus particles involves the assistance of helper proteins. The base plates are assembled first, with <b>the</b> <b>tails</b> being built upon them afterward. The head capsids, constructed separately, will spontaneously assemble with <b>the</b> <b>tails.</b> The DNA is packed efficiently within the heads. The whole process takes about 15 minutes.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{suggests}} a simple method of deriving nonparametric lower bounds of {{the accuracy of}} statistical inference on heavy-tailed distributions. We present lower bounds of the mean squared error of <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> index, <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> constant, and extreme quantiles estimators. The {{results show that the}} normalizing sequences of robust estimators must depend in a specific way on <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> index and <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> constant...|$|R
50|$|A Stabyhoun's body {{should be}} {{powerful}} with well-rounded ribs. Its back is straight with the croup sloping slightly. The loin is powerful, and the belly is only moderately tucked up. <b>The</b> <b>tail</b> is long, reaching to the hock. It is set low and carried downwards {{with a gentle}} bend upwards toward the tip of <b>the</b> <b>tail.</b> In action, <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> is lifted, but never so as to curl. Like the hair behind a Stabyhoun's front and rear quarters, <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> hair should be long, full, and bushy. However, <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> hair should not feather.|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} cause of <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> of <b>the</b> {{distribution}} {{of the number of}} packet and byte arrivals at backbone routers. One possible cause is that sometimes there are a large number of active connections resulting in a large number of arrivals {{in a short period of}} time. Another possibility is that <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> is due to one or a few very fast connections. By examining time-stamped packet headers from several backbone links, we find that <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> is neither strictly from many users nor strictly from fast connections. Rather, at some times and some time-scales, we find that <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> (<b>the</b> skewness of the distribution in particular) is strongly influenced by <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> of <b>the</b> distribution of the number of active connections, while at other times, <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> of <b>the</b> number of arrivals is due to <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> of <b>the</b> distribution of the connection bit-rates. 1...|$|R
