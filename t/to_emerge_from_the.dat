5|$|Volcanism at La Reforma began {{during the}} Pliocene, with ash flows and subaqueous pumice flows. Later {{activity}} became subaerial and generated pillow lava. Of the local volcanoes, La Reforma {{was the first}} <b>to</b> <b>emerge</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> sea. Four to five million years ago, basaltic dykes formed. Volcanic activity at La Reforma occurred between 1.6 and 1.4 million years ago, and at least four ignimbrites have been found there.|$|E
5|$|Although these criticisms still {{form the}} {{prevailing}} {{view on the}} History's literary worth, modern scholars such as Rohrbacher have begun to argue that, while it is poorly written and not a stylistic or polished work, its use of allusion {{as a vehicle for}} parodying popular late 4th century biographical and historiographical works means that the very features which were once a cause for intense criticism (such as the inclusion of irrelevant or contradictory inventions alongside traditionally sourced material) are actually an intentional and integral part of the work, {{making it one of the}} most unique pieces of literature <b>to</b> <b>emerge</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ancient world.|$|E

5|$|As the SS Panzer Corps began <b>to</b> <b>emerge</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> city, {{they engaged}} Soviet units {{positioned}} directly {{southwest of the}} city, including the 17th NKVD Brigade, 19th Rifle Division and 25th Guards Rifle Division. Attempts by the Red Army to re-establish communication with {{the remnants of the}} 3rd Tank Army continued, although in vain. On 14–15 March these forces were given permission to withdraw to the northern Donets River. The Soviet 40th and 69th armies had been engaged since 13 March with the Großdeutschland Panzergrenadier Division, and had been split by the German drive. After the fall of Kharkov the Soviet defense of the Donets had collapsed, allowing Manstein's forces to drive to Belgorod on 17 March, and take it by the next day. However, weather and exhaustion forced Manstein's counterstroke to end soon thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Jelena {{was born}} in 1365 or 1366 as the third {{daughter}} of Princess Milica of Serbia and Lazar of Serbia. Her mother belonged to the Nemanjić dynasty, while her father was {{the founder of the}} Lazarević dynasty. He created Moravian Serbia, the largest and most powerful state <b>to</b> <b>emerge</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ruins of the Serbian Empire. Hence, Jelena {{was a member of the}} highest Serbian aristocracy. She {{was born in}} Prilepac and spent her childhood in Kruševac, where she lived until she married her first husband, Đurađ II Balšić, in 1386. She had one child with him, a son named Balša III who was born in 1387. Balša III had three children, a son whose name is not known and two daughters, Jelena and Teodora. His son died at a very young age in 1415. In 1424, Balša's daughter Jelena married Stjepan Vukčić Kosača and became the mother of Queen Catherine of Bosnia and Vladislav Hercegović.|$|E
5|$|London was {{instrumental}} in the development of punk music, with figures such as the Sex Pistols, The Clash, and Vivienne Westwood all based in the city.

London is also a centre for urban music. In particular the genres UK garage, drum and bass, dubstep and grime evolved in the city from the foreign genres of hip hop and reggae, alongside local drum and bass. Music station BBC Radio 1Xtra was set up to support the rise of local urban contemporary music both in London and {{in the rest of the}} United Kingdom.|$|E

5|$|On February 29, 2000, Boeing {{launched}} its next-generation twinjet program, initially called 777-X, and began issuing offers to airlines. Development was slowed by an industry downturn {{during the early}} 2000s. The first model <b>to</b> <b>emerge</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> program, the 777-300ER, was launched with an order for ten aircraft from Air France, along with additional commitments. On February 24, 2003, the -300ER made its first flight, and the FAA and EASA (European Aviation Safety Agency, successor to the JAA) certified the model on March 16, 2004. The first delivery to Air France took place on April 29, 2004. The -300ER, which combined the -300's added capacity with the -200ER's range, became the top-selling 777 variant in the late 2000s, benefitting as airlines replaced comparable four-engine models with twinjets for their lower operating costs.|$|E
5|$|The CECAFA Cup is {{considered}} Africa's oldest football tournament, and involves teams from Central and Southern Africa. The matches in the 1973 tournament were played from 22 September 1973 until 29 September 1973. The tournament was originally the Gossage Cup, contested {{by the four}} nations of Kenya, Uganda, Tanganyika (modern day Tanzania), and Zanzibar, running from 1929 until 1965. In 1967, this became the East and Central African Senior Challenge Cup, often shortened to simply the Challenge Cup, which was competed for five years, until 1971, before the CECAFA Cup was introduced in 1973. Ethiopia were the defending champions, having won the 2005 tournament in Rwanda, after finishing second in their group, and going on to beat Zanzibar and Rwanda in the final. The 2006 champions Sudan failed, however, <b>to</b> <b>emerge</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 2005 group stages.|$|E
5|$|The {{roots of}} a tree serve to anchor {{it to the ground}} and gather water and {{nutrients}} to transfer to all parts of the tree. They are also used for reproduction, defence, survival, energy storage and many other purposes. The radicle or embryonic root is the first part of a seedling <b>to</b> <b>emerge</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> seed during the process of germination. This develops into a taproot which goes straight downwards. Within a few weeks lateral roots branch {{out of the side of}} this and grow horizontally through the upper layers of the soil. In most trees, the taproot eventually withers away and the wide-spreading laterals remain. Near the tip of the finer roots are single cell root hairs. These are in immediate contact with the soil particles and can absorb water and nutrients such as potassium in solution. The roots require oxygen to respire and only a few species such as the mangrove and the pond cypress (Taxodium ascendens) can live in permanently waterlogged soil.|$|E

5|$|The series' title {{sequence}} {{was created}} by production studio Elastic for HBO. Creative director Angus Wall and his collaborators received the 2011 Primetime Emmy Award for Main Title Design for the sequence, which depicts a three-dimensional map of the series' fictional world. The map is projected {{on the inside of}} a sphere which is centrally lit by a small sun in an armillary sphere. As the camera moves across the map, focusing on the locations of the episode's events, clockwork mechanisms intertwine and allow buildings and other structures <b>to</b> <b>emerge</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> map. Accompanied by the title music, the names of the principal cast and creative staff appear.

5|$|The social {{structures}} of the red-throated bee-eater and the white-fronted bee-eaters {{have been described as}} more complex than for any other bird species. The birds exist in colonies located on nesting cliffs, and have a stable structure all year round. These colonies typically contain five to 50 burrows, occasionally up to 200, and are composed of clans of two or three pairs, their helpers, and their offspring. The helpers are male offspring from a previous year. Within the colony, the males alternate between guarding their mate and attempting to make forced copulations with other females. The females in turn attempt to lay eggs in their neighbour's nests, an example of brood parasitism. Some individuals also specialise in kleptoparasitism, stealing prey collected by other colony members. The colony's daily routine is <b>to</b> <b>emerge</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> nesting holes or roosting branches soon after dawn, preen and sun themselves for an hour, then disperse to feed. Feeding territories are divided by clan, with each clan defending its territory from all others of the same species, including clans of the same colony. The clans return to the colony before dusk, and engage in more social behaviour before retiring for the night. Colonies are situated several hundred metres apart and {{have little to do with}} each other, although young individuals may disperse between colonies. As such these species can be thought to have four tiers of social kinship, the individual pair, the family unit, the clan and the colony as a whole.|$|E
5|$|Whimpress tabled various {{hypotheses}} for Crockett's actions. At the time, Crockett was 37 {{years old}} and was ready <b>to</b> <b>emerge</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> shadow of Phillips, the eminent Australian umpire of the time. When Crockett called Marsh, it was his 29th match as a first-class umpire and the no-balling was seen in some quarters as a signal that he felt ready to officiate in Test matches. A cynical view of Crockett's calls held that if throwing was to be eradicated then the umpire was going to choose a soft target. This theory ruled out the calling of a fellow Victorian, his state of origin. The same line of reasoning concluded that a New South Welshman would be called, and likely not a high-profile Test player like Noble or Jack Saunders. Those who adhered to this hypothesis believed {{that it would be}} easier for Crockett to target someone who had a previous stigma of throwing and that Marsh—an aborigine who led the bowling averages with 21 wickets at 17.38—was an ideal target.|$|E

5|$|Miller went to {{the local}} state school before {{transferring}} to Melbourne High Schoola selective government institution that accepted students through an academic examat the start of 1934. The school's emphasis on scholastic and sporting excellence and its culture was {{more in line with}} that of a private school than a standard government school. Australian Test captain Bill Woodfull was on the teaching staff as Miller's mathematics teacher.}} Because he did little study and focused his energy on sport, Miller was a mediocre student.Perry, p. 18. In addition to cricket and football, Miller played baseball and competed in swimming. This disappointed Woodfull, a disciplined man who invoked the school's motto Honour the Work in exhorting his students to work hard as Australia was attempting <b>to</b> <b>emerge</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> depths of the Great Depression. Despite being Australia's captain, Woodfull refused to involve himself in the coaching of the school's cricket teams, feeling that it would intrude on the responsibilities of the sports teachers. Despite this, Woodfull watched the students at cricket training and quickly noticed Miller's skills. Aged 14 and still under , Miller was selected in the school's First XI. With his pads flapping against his stomach and sporting a sawn-down bat, Miller batted at No. 6 and scored 44 on his senior debut. Although his lack of power was obvious, Miller's control and solidity prompted the spectators to call him the Unbowlable, the same nickname that was accorded to Woodfull, who had a similarly strong defensive style. Melbourne {{went on to win the}} match,Perry, p. 20. and Miller impressed his captain Keith Truscott, who fought for his selection and took him under his wing. Truscott later became an ace fighter pilot in the Royal Australian Air Force, and Miller would follow in his footsteps. Truscott's social influence compounded the distractions from Miller's study. Miller failed all eight of his subjects at the end of 1934, and with an average mark of 25%, was the class dunce. He scored zero in his final exam for Woodfull's geometry class,Perry, p. 21. and was forced to repeat year 9.|$|E
