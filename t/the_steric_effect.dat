The contributions of these factors vary depending {{on the nature of the}} substituents and may either contribute positively or negatively to the energy barrier. Computational studies of small molecules such as ethane suggest that electrostatic effects make the greatest contribution to the energy barrier; however, the barrier is traditionally attributed primarily to steric interactions.In the case of cyclic systems, <b>the</b> <b>steric</b> <b>effect</b> and contribution to the free energy can be approximated by A values, which measure the energy difference when a substituent is in the axial or equatorial position.|$|E

It is the well-documented experimental {{finding in the}} literature that vicinal substitution with bulkier groups near the reaction center significantly slows the reaction due to steric hindrance, but theoretical understanding in the quantitative manner about factors dictating the SN 2 reaction barrier height is still controversial. In this work, employing the new quantification approach that we recently proposed for <b>the</b> <b>steric</b> <b>effect</b> from the density functional theory framework, we investigate the relative contribution of three independent effects-steric, electrostatic, and quantum-to the SN 2 barrier heights in gas phase for substituted methyl halide systems, R 1 R 2 R 3 CX, reacting with the fluorine anion, where R 1, R 2, and R 3 denote substituting groups and X = F or Cl. We found that {{in accordance with the}} experimental finding, for these systems, <b>the</b> <b>steric</b> <b>effect</b> dominates the transition state barrier, contributing positively to barrier heights, but this contribution is largely compensated by the negative, stabilizing contribution from the quantum effect due to the exchange-correlation interactions.
