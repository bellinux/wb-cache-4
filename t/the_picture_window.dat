50|$|The {{house was}} built in 1923 to a design by Arthur H. Bowditch, a Boston-based {{architect}} {{best known for his}} commercial buildings. The house is an excellent local example of rustic Craftsman styling.

50|$|In 1916, {{one year}} after the company hired for the {{construction}} of the building transferred the contract to Public Works General Company, the executive authority suspended the construction of the bridges and inclined planes due to the economic crisis and the lack of materials due to the World War I. As a result, some concepts of the palace had to be changed. <b>The</b> <b>picture</b> <b>windows</b> on <b>the</b> second floor (Sarmiento street side) had been originally conceived as entrances, therefore mezzanines were added while some floors were demolished to convert first and second basements into main hall entrances, putting the windows there.|$|R

5000|$|During Castlecrag’s early years, {{houses were}} either {{designed}} by Walter Burley Griffin and Marion Mahony (fifteen were built) or approved by them.

50|$|With its {{curvilinear}} plant {{forms and}} intricate framing of <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> <b>window,</b> the Chicago-landmark facade {{of this building}} is an outgrowth of Sullivan’s belief in organic architecture. It was commissioned in 1921 by William P. Krause to serve the dual purpose of a residence and a music shop, at a total cost of $22,000. Krause chose his neighbor, architect William Presto, to design the building. Years earlier, Presto {{had worked as a}} draftsman for Louis Sullivan. But by 1921, Sullivan’s success had faded, as his designs were no longer in demand. So in a reversal of roles, Sullivan was asked by his former employee to design what would become the building’s beautiful green terra cotta façade. Sullivan, in ill health, living in a rented room and hopelessly insolvent, accepted the offer.|$|E
50|$|After inheriting {{a portion}} of the Penn family tobacco interests, they {{relocated}} from Penn's Store, Patrick County, Virginia to North Carolina; Jeff Penn then augmented his fortune in stocks and bonds during the depression. He also operated a dairy husbandry and raised Holstein cattle. In later years he raised Black Angus. The Penn Tobacco Company was later purchased in 1911 by American Tobacco Company, the Duke family behemoth that made Lucky Strike cigarettes. The coats-of-arms above <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> <b>window</b> show the Penn family crest, {{as well as that of}} the Spencer family of Spencer, Virginia, to whom the Penns were related. Betsy's father was Arthur Schoellkopf, Chairman of the board of directors of Niagara Falls Power Company and Mayor of Niagara Falls, New York. Betsy Penn survived Jeff by nearly twenty years, during which time she became increasingly involved in philanthropic and community activities. She created the Betsy-Jeff Penn 4-H Educational Center on part of the estate. Most of the furnishings and art, showcasing 30 countries, were placed by the Penns.|$|E

5000|$|On {{the basis}} of the quality of Clark's {{contributions}} to Byrds, David Geffen signed him to Asylum Records in early 1974. The label was the home of the most prominent exponents of the singer-songwriter movement of the era and carried the kind of hip cachet that Clark hadn't experienced since his days with the Byrds. He retired to Mendocino and spent long periods at <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> <b>window</b> of a friend's cliff-top home with a notebook and an acoustic guitar, staring at the Pacific Ocean. Deeply affected by his visions, he composed the songs that became his masterpiece, No Other. Produced by Thomas Jefferson Kaye with a vast array of session musicians (including members of the Section and the Allman Brothers Band) and backing singers, the album was an unprecedented amalgam of country rock, folk, gospel, soul and choral music with poetic, mystical lyrics. Included in No Other are some of Clark's most enduring compositions, including the title track, [...] "Silver Raven", [...] "Some Misunderstanding" [...] and [...] "Lady of the North". Although the album was praised by critics, its unconventional arrangements limited public appeal. Furthermore, its high production costs (exceeding $100,000) prompted Geffen to berate Clark and Kaye. The album was minimally promoted and stalled in the Billboard album chart at number 144. Ultimately, No Other became a favorite of rock critics, growing in popularity with each passing year. In 2013, popularity of No Other grew when it was revealed that members of such au courant groups as Beach House, The Walkmen, Grizzly Bear, and Fleet Foxes would be performing the album in its entirety in a series of concerts.|$|E
