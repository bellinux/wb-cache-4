2500|$|On September 22, 2005 Jones {{presented}} {{his views on}} {{the collapse of the}} World Trade Center towers and World Trade Center 7 at a BYU seminar attended by approximately 60 people. Jones claimed that a variety of evidence defies the mainstream collapse theory and favors controlled demolition, using thermite. The evidence Jones cited included the speed and symmetry of the collapses, and characteristics of dust jets. Later, Jones claimed he had identified grey/red flakes found in the dust as nanothermite traces. He has also claimed that the <b>thermite</b> <b>reaction</b> products (aluminium oxide and iron-rich microspheres) were also found in the dust. He called for further scientific investigation to test the controlled demolition theory and the release of all relevant data by the government. Shortly after the seminar, Jones placed a research paper entitled [...] "Why Indeed Did the WTC Buildings Collapse?" [...] on his page in the Physics department Web site, noting that BYU had no responsibility for the paper.|$|E

40|$|In the {{framework}} of ISRU (In-Situ Resource Utilization) and ISFR (In-Situ Fabrication and Repair) applications, a novel recently patented process based on the occurrence of Self-propagating High temperature Synthesis (SHS) reactions potentially exploitable for the in-situ fabrication of construction materials in Lunar and Martian environments is described in this work. Specifically, the SHS process involves <b>thermite</b> <b>reactions</b> type between Lunar or Martian regolith simulants and aluminum as reducing agent. To overcome {{the fact that the}} original content of ilmenite (FeTiO 3) and ferric oxide (Fe 2 O 3) on Moon and Mars soils, respectively, is not enough to make the SHS process possible, suitable amounts of these species have {{to be added to the}} starting mixtures. The dependence of the most important processing parameters, particularly the composition of the starting mixture, evacuation level, and gravity conditions, on SHS process behaviour and product characteristics is specifically examined for the case of Lunar regolith. All the obtained findings allows us to conclude that the optimized results obtained under terrestrial conditions are valid for in-situ applications in Lunar environment. In particular, parabolic flight experiments evidenced that neither SHS process dynamics nor product characteristics are significantly influenced in both Lunar and Martian systems when passing from Earth to low gravity conditions.

40|$|In {{the field}} of {{composite}} energetic materials, properties such as ingredient distribution, particle size, and morphology affect both sensitivity and performance. Since the reaction kinetics of composite energetic materials are typically controlled by the mass transport rates between reactants, one would anticipate new and potentially exceptional performance from energetic nanocomposites. We have developed a new method of making nanostructured energetic materials, specifically explosives, propellants, and pyrotechnics, using sol-gel chemistry. A novel sol-gel approach has proven successful in preparing nanostructured metal oxide materials. By introducing a fuel metal, such as aluminum, into the nanostructured metal oxide matrix, energetic materials based on <b>thermite</b> <b>reactions</b> can be fabricated. Two of the metal oxides are tungsten trioxide and iron(III) oxide, {{both of which are}} of interest in {{the field of}} energetic materials. Due to the versatility of the preparation method, binary oxidizing phases can also be prepared, thus enabling a potential means of controlling the energetic properties of the subsequent nanocomposites. Furthermore, organic additives can also be easily introduced into the nanocomposites for the production of nanostructured gas generators. The resulting nanoscale distribution of all the ingredients displays energetic properties not seen in its micro-scale counterparts due to the expected increase of mass transport rates between the reactants. The unique synthesis methodology, formulations, and performance of these materials will be presented. The degree of control over the burning rate of these nanocomposites afforded by the compositional variation of a binary oxidizing phase will also be discussed. These energetic nanocomposites have the potential for releasing controlled amounts of energy at a controlled rate. Due to the versatility of the synthesis method, a large number of compositions and physical properties can be achieved, resulting in energetic nanocomposites that can be fabricated to meet specific safety and environmental considerations...|$|R

40|$|In a {{previous}} work a simple one-dimensional model to study theoretically various effects in energetic materials was presented [1]. The model solves {{the heat and}} mass transport equation coupled with a reaction kinetic involving the strong non-linear Arrhenius-term of the chemical reaction rate constant. The energetic material is ignited by a heat impulse modeled as a Gaussian function. It is called a Hot-Spot. Other applications and a 3 -dimensional version with applications to <b>thermite</b> <b>reactions</b> were presented in different works [2 - 4]. In this work the model is expanded with material parameters dependent on position, a phase transition and a new chemical reaction scheme with convective heat feedback to the unburned material. With the space-dependent material parameters the model {{takes into account the}} different thermal conductivity, density and heat capacity of the energetic material and the gas phase of the burned material. The phase transition models the melting of the energetic material. The chemical reaction scheme is modelled by a 1 st or 2 nd order reaction. It takes place in the gas-phase of vaporized material and radiates the energy partly back to the energetic material. Also different other heat losses can be modeled. Here the numerical procedure for solving these two coupled differential equations with different source terms is described. Therefore the method of the 1 -dimensional Green`s function is used. The one-dimensional solution of the problem could be a simplification for many 3 -dimensional problems because of the symmetry. With this model, parameter studies could be performed to investigate the influence of the different parameters. As a simple model the combustion of an energetic material with different chemical reaction schemes are presented and compared. It supplements the previous work. First examples of a study vary different parameters, like the material parameters, phase transition enthalpies, the chemical reaction scheme and heat of reaction. The influence of the different parameters is investigated by the burning rate...|$|R

The yields expected from this operation were about 95%. There are many documented explosions of these furnaces due to improperly packed refractory lining or a magnesium flare.
