50|$|In 1647 <b>the</b> <b>street</b> {{was first}} {{referred}} to as Sancti Påwels gathun.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>street</b> was renovated in {{the early}} 1990s during the {{construction}} of Arthur's Quay Shopping Centre which forms {{the west side of}} <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> <b>The</b> shopping centre is mainly inward facing, which does not add much to footfall on <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> <b>The</b> east side of <b>the</b> <b>street</b> was part of the ill-fated Opera Centre development which never passed the planning stage. As a result, most of this section of <b>the</b> <b>street</b> lies derelict with no business activity.|$|R

60|$|The French have no front gardens; but <b>the</b> <b>street</b> {{is every}} man's front garden. There are trees in <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> and {{sometimes}} fountains. <b>The</b> <b>street</b> is <b>the</b> Frenchman's tavern, for he drinks in <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> It is his dining-room, for he dines in <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> It is his British Museum, for the statues and monuments in French streets are not, as with us, of the worst, {{but of the}} best, art of the country, and they are often actually as historical as <b>the</b> Pyramids. <b>The</b> <b>street</b> again is <b>the</b> Frenchman's Parliament, for France has never taken its Chamber of Deputies so seriously as we take our House of Commons, and the quibbles of mere elected nonentities in an official room seem feeble to a people whose fathers have heard the voice of Desmoulins like a trumpet under open heaven, or Victor Hugo shouting from his carriage amid {{the wreck of the}} second Republic. And as the Frenchman drinks in <b>the</b> <b>street</b> and dines in <b>the</b> <b>street</b> so also he fights in <b>the</b> <b>street</b> and dies in <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> so that <b>the</b> <b>street</b> can never be commonplace to him.|$|R

The idea of {{the rehabilitation}} of <b>the</b> <b>street</b> {{was to create a}} place in Amman where pedestrians would walk safely and freely away from traffic. With its completion, Amman gained its very first first-rate pedestrianized public space. Before the completion of <b>the</b> project, <b>the</b> <b>street</b> used to allow parking, with cars driving through <b>the</b> <b>street</b> as well.|$|R

5|$|Fellow street artist Shepard Fairey {{wrote in}} Swindle:Invader's pop art may seem shallow, but {{by taking the}} risk of {{illegally}} re-contextualizing video game characters in an urban environment that provides more chaotic social interaction than a gamer's bedroom, he makes a statement about the desensitizing nature of video games and consumer culture. In a postmodern paradox, a game like Grand Theft Auto takes the danger of <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> {{and puts it in}} a safe video game, while Invader takes a safe video game icon and inserts it into the danger of <b>the</b> <b>streets.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>street</b> prospered from <b>the</b> {{time of its}} {{construction}} and quickly attracted the city's wealthier residents who then resided in the Englishtown area of medieval Limerick.

Although <b>the</b> <b>street</b> functioned as <b>the</b> main retail & commercial district of the city, this was (and remains today) primarily focused on the northern end of <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> <b>The</b> southern end of <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> in contrast, was more residential in character with the barrier being located about midway on <b>the</b> <b>street</b> (from <b>the</b> Cecil <b>Street</b> junction).
