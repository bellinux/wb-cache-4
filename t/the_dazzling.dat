25|$|As a poet, Statius was {{versatile}} in {{his abilities}} and contrived to represent {{his work as}} otium. Taught by his educated father, Statius {{was familiar with the}} breadth of classical literature and displayed his learning in his poetry which is densely allusive and has been described as elaborate and mannerist. He was able to compose in hexameter, hendecasyllable, Alcaic and Sapphic meters, to produce deeply researched and highly refined epic and polished impromptu pieces, and to treat a variety of themes with <b>the</b> <b>dazzling</b> rhetorical and poetic skill that inspired the support of his patrons and the emperor. Some of Statius' works, such as his poems for his competitions, have been lost; he is recorded as having written an Agave mime, and a four line fragment remains of his poem on Domitian's military campaigns, the De Bello Germanico composed for the Alban Games in the scholia to Juvenal 4.94.|$|E
25|$|Early {{in ancient}} Indian culture, the river Ganges was {{associated}} with fecundity, its redeeming waters and its rich silt providing sustenance to all who lived along its banks. A counterpoise to <b>the</b> <b>dazzling</b> heat of the Indian summer, the Ganges came to be imbued with magical qualities and to be revered in anthropomorphic form. By the 5th century CE, an elaborate mythology surrounded the Ganges, now a goddess in her own right, and a symbol for all rivers of India. Hindu temples all over India had statues and reliefs of the goddess carved at their entrances, symbolically washing the sins of arriving worshippers and guarding the gods within. As protector of the sanctum sanctorum, the goddess soon came to depicted with several characteristic accessories: the makara (a crocodile-like undersea monster, often shown with an elephant-like trunk), the kumbha (an overfull vase), various overhead parasol-like coverings, and a gradually increasing retinue of humans.|$|E

500|$|Of Waugh's early books, Decline and Fall {{was hailed}} by Arnold Bennett in the Evening Standard as [...] "an uncompromising and brilliantly {{malicious}} satire". The critical reception of Vile Bodies {{two years later}} was even more enthusiastic, with Rebecca West predicting that Waugh was [...] "destined to be <b>the</b> <b>dazzling</b> figure of his age". However, A Handful of Dust, later widely regarded as a masterpiece, received a more muted welcome from critics, despite the author's own high estimation of the work. The book's ending, with Tony Last condemned forever to read Dickens to his mad jungle captor, was thought by the critic Henry Yorke to reduce an otherwise believable book to [...] "phantasy". Cyril Connolly's first reaction to the book was that Waugh's powers were failing, an opinion that he later revised.|$|E
