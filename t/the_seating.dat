5|$|In 2003, the Government of Tasmania {{allocated}} $2million {{to erect}} a roof above 6,000terrace seats, in readiness for the 2003 Rugby Union World Cup; this meant {{that almost all of}} <b>the</b> <b>seating</b> area was protected from the weather. In 2004, the ground became known as Aurora Stadium as the result of six-year naming rights sponsorship deal with Aurora Energy.|$|E
5|$|The Apollonio Stadium {{was used}} for select games of the ice hockey tournament. Considerable work {{had to be done}} to bring the stadium up to date.

5|$|The {{new system}} {{implemented}} under the Lisbon Treaty, including revising <b>the</b> <b>seating</b> well before elections, {{was intended to}} avoid political horse trading when the allocations have to be revised to reflect demographic changes.|$|E
5|$|Because the 1924 Rose Bowl {{and several}} later Rose Bowls had very high ticket sales, the Tournament of Roses Association decided to close off the {{southern}} end of the Rose Bowl stadium and expand <b>the</b> <b>seating</b> from a horseshoe design to one that surrounded the entire field. The 1924 game was the first in which the Tournament of Roses made participating schools responsible for ticket sales. The strategy has been used since, with only a small number of tickets allocated to Tournament officials for each yearly edition.|$|E
5|$|During construction, {{the weight}} had {{increased}} from 149 to 170 tonnes; to reduce this to 158 tonnes, {{the original idea}} of step-free access was discontinued. Instead, a wheelchair lift was installed, but it proved not to work. The area around the doors are step-free from the platform, but within the trains steps {{must be taken to}} reach <b>the</b> <b>seating</b> area. The Norwegian Federation of Organisations of Disabled People have criticized Flytoget for ordering identical additional cars that will not ease access for the disabled.|$|E
50|$|The network {{consists}} of seats and center. Seat agreements, establishing rights and privileges, including extraterritoriality, have been signed for <b>the</b> <b>Seat</b> in Pescara in Italy, for <b>the</b> <b>Seat</b> in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil and for <b>the</b> <b>Seat</b> in Yerevan in Armenia. <b>The</b> <b>Seat</b> Agreement for <b>the</b> <b>Seat</b> in Pescara has been ratified on May 13, 2010. <b>The</b> <b>Seat</b> agreement for <b>the</b> <b>Seat</b> in Yerevan {{has been approved}} unanimously by the Parliament of the Republic of Armenia on November 13, 2015.|$|R

5|$|Imprisoned debtors {{were allowed}} some social contact, but the regime for criminals was {{designed}} to be one of isolation, according to the separate system. Consequently, <b>the</b> <b>seating</b> in the prison chapel is designed to enclose each prisoner individually so that the preacher could see everyone but each could see only him. By 1878 the system was discredited and the inmates were transferred to the new gaol in the eastern outskirts of Lincoln. The prison in the castle was left without a use until the Lincolnshire Archives were housed in its cells.|$|E
5|$|Larry Schmittou {{sold his}} {{majority}} {{interest in the}} Sounds to Al Gordon, president of AmeriSports Companies LLC, before the 1997 season. The new ownership group refurbished every area of the stadium, including the concession stands, bathrooms, concourse, stadium exterior, home clubhouse (a visitor's clubhouse had been built under the third base bleachers for the 1996 season), and parking lots. Several sections of bleachers in left field past third base were removed and replaced by tents and a group picnic area. This brought <b>the</b> <b>seating</b> capacity to 11,500.|$|E
5|$|On April 12, 2012, the Steelers {{confirmed}} {{they would}} seek {{approval from the}} NFL to expand seating by 3,000. On May 19, 2014, {{after more than two}} years, the Steelers and the SEA came to an agreement to add about 3,000 seats to the venue. After contractors surveyed the complex the final number of 2,390 added seats with five additional suites including more parking, restrooms and concessions was determined in December 2014 to increase capacity to a total of 67,890. <b>The</b> <b>seating</b> was put in place by the summer of 2015.|$|E

40|$|A {{new type}} of car seat has been {{designed}} in which the back-rest is able to move freely in the vertical direction. The design allows the back-rest to follow the vertical vibration {{of the back of}} an occupant of <b>the</b> <b>seat.</b> This is intended to decrease any strain on the lumbar part of the spinal column caused by a different vertical motion at <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> squab and <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> back. <b>The</b> transmission of vertical (z axis) vibration from the base of this <b>seat</b> to <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> surface, to <b>the</b> back-rest and to the backs and heads of seat occupants has been measured. Measurements were made with <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> back fixed, to prevent vertical motion relative to <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> frame, and with <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> back free to move. Vibration transmissibilities from <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> base to <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> surface were characterized by a resonance at frequencies in the region of 4 Hz. The resonance frequencies were slightly higher with the fixed back-rest than with the moving back-rest. The transmissibilities at frequencies above 4 Hz -were generally higher with the fixed back-rest. Measurements with no contact between <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> occupants and <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> back indicated that the dynamic properties of the human body and <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> cushion were less influenced by <b>the</b> moving <b>seat</b> back than by <b>the</b> fixed <b>seat</b> back. Differential motion between <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> surface and seat back was smaller with <b>the</b> moving <b>seat</b> back than with the fixed back. © IMechE 1996. </p...|$|R
5|$|Sir Oliver Popplewell {{published}} his {{inquiry into the}} fire in 1986, which introduced new safety legislation for sports grounds across the country. Forensic scientist David Woolley believed {{the cause of the}} fire was from a discarded cigarette or match, which had dropped through gaps between <b>the</b> <b>seating</b> to a void below the stand where rubbish had built up. A number of police officers and 22spectators were later awarded bravery awards for their deeds on the day.|$|E
5|$|When B {{was first}} founded, the linear {{magnetic}} eddy brake {{had yet to}} be developed, so it used friction brakes as its main braking system. On the train, pads are fitted beneath <b>the</b> <b>seating</b> areas. On the brakes, similar pads are connected to steel supports. When the pads on the train come into contact with the brakes, friction is created which slows the train. Beginning with Kumba in 1993, friction brakes have also been used as trim brakes that regulate the speed of the train while it is still navigating the course.|$|E
5|$|Aisles {{were added}} to the nave in the 14th century, first on the north side and then on the south, {{doubling}} <b>the</b> <b>seating</b> capacity. More windows were also installed in the nave. A century later, a timber porch was built on the north side, the chancel arch was widened and a rood screen was installed, a standard feature of churches in the medieval era, as were wall decorations and paintings. Ecclesiastical feeling moved in favour of austere, whitewashed walls, screens and pillars by the 17th century, and Parliament decreed these changes in the 1640s. The vicar of Ifield, Reverend Robert Goddin, was a strict Protestant who was strongly opposed to Catholic-style worship, ceremony and church decoration, and he enforced the new style rigorously. The rood screen and all internal decoration were removed at this time.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A new {{integrated}} {{child safety}} seat {{is presented in}} this paper. <b>The</b> <b>seat</b> is a two-mode seat for a motor vehicle cooperable with an adult seat belt assembly to provide two modes operation including an adult seat mode and a child <b>seat</b> mode. <b>The</b> <b>seat</b> locates in <b>the</b> center of <b>the</b> rear <b>seat.</b> <b>The</b> structure of <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> was designed in detail. The height of the booster of <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> can be adjusted continuously according to <b>the</b> <b>seated</b> shoulder height of the child passenger. The depth of booster cushion also can be changed according {{to the size of}} the passenger. The sled test with <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> was conducted. <b>The</b> <b>seat</b> simulation models with different booster heights were developed using MADYMO software and validated. Then, these models were used to study the performance of <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> in frontal impact. Some key parameters of <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> were studied in simulation test. The results of the test and simulation show that <b>the</b> <b>seat</b> can provide effective protection for the children aged from 3 to 10 years in frontal impact...|$|R

5|$|Construction {{started in}} 2006, and the stadium opened on 15 April 2007, {{replacing}} Kristiansand Stadion as Start's home ground. The venue cost 400 million Norwegian krone (NOK), {{of which the}} stadium itself cost NOK250 million, after significant cost overruns. While originally planned with artificial turf, the venue was ultimately built with a natural grass pitch. The venue and the holding company Start Stadion were taken over by Sparebanken Sør, the main creditor, in 2008. They subsequently also took over Start Toppfotball, the company running the club. Both companies were sold to Ernst Ravnaas in 2009. Following decreased attendance, ahead of the 2011 season <b>the</b> <b>seating</b> on the corners was sold as advertisement space and the maximum capacity has artificially been reduced to 11,700.|$|E
5|$|For the show, Minogue {{collaborated with}} {{creative}} director William Baker and art director Alan MacDonald. Baker and MacDonald had previously {{worked with the}} singer on her KylieFever2002 tour. The musical arrangements were handled by Steve Anderson, while the dance routines were choreographed by Michael Rooney. Display hardware manufacturer Barco was hired to provide 100 square metres large LED displays, which were {{set up on the}} stage behind Minogue. They were used to show animations and high resolution graphics. Minogue wore five different costumes during the 75-minute-long show. Fashion houses like Balenciaga, Chanel, and Helmut Lang designed these costumes. Minogue was backed by 12 dancers and a full-piece band. <b>The</b> <b>seating</b> capacity of the show was restricted to 4000 spectators and the entire staging of the show cost £1 million.|$|E
5|$|He {{joined the}} Blue Cuirassier {{regiment}} {{of the imperial}} Russian cavalry shortly before 1903. Grand Duke Michael, the younger brother of Tsar Nicholas II, was the regiment's honorary colonel. In April 1903, during a military parade at the Pavlovsk Palace, Grand Duchess Olga, the youngest sister of Nicholas and Michael, saw Kulikovsky and begged Michael to arrange <b>the</b> <b>seating</b> at a casual luncheon so that she and Kulikovsky were adjacent. The Grand Duchess was already married to Duke Peter Alexandrovich of Oldenburg, who was covertly believed by {{his friends and family}} to be homosexual. A few days after her brief meeting with Kulikovsky, Olga asked Oldenburg for a divorce, which he refused with the qualification that he would reconsider his decision after seven years.|$|E

5|$|In 1998 a new two-tier Anfield Road end was opened. The stand has {{encountered}} {{a number of}} problems since its redevelopment; {{at the beginning of the}} 1999–2000 season, a series of support poles and stanchions had to be brought in to give extra stability to the top tier of the stand. During Ronnie Moran's testimonial match against Celtic, many fans complained of movement of the top tier. At the same time that the stanchions were inserted, the executive seating area was expanded by two rows in the main stand, lowering <b>the</b> <b>seating</b> capacity in the paddock.|$|E
5|$|Old Trafford's {{most recent}} expansion, {{which took place}} between July 2005 and May 2006, saw an {{increase}} of around 8,000 seats {{with the addition of}} second tiers to both the north-west and north-east quadrants of the ground. Part of the new seating was used {{for the first time on}} 26 March 2006, when an attendance of 69,070 became a new Premier League record. The record continued to be pushed upwards before reaching its current peak on 31 March 2007, when 76,098 spectators saw United beat Blackburn Rovers 4–1, meaning that just 114 seats (0.15% of the total capacity of 76,212) were left unoccupied. In 2009, a reorganisation of <b>the</b> <b>seating</b> in the stadium resulted in a reduction of the capacity by 255 to 75,957, meaning that the club's home attendance record would stand at least until the next expansion.|$|E
5|$|The 747 {{line was}} further {{developed}} with {{the launch of}} the 747-300 in 1980. The 300 series resulted from Boeing studies to increase <b>the</b> <b>seating</b> capacity of the 747, during which modifications such as fuselage plugs and extending the upper deck over {{the entire length of the}} fuselage were rejected. The first 747-300, completed in 1983, included a stretched upper deck, increased cruise speed, and increased seating capacity. The -300 variant was previously designated 747SUD for stretched upper deck, then 747-200 SUD, followed by 747EUD, before the 747-300 designation was used. Passenger, short range and combination freighter-passenger versions of the 300 series were produced.|$|E
