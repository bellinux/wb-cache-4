60|$|The Great Eastern was {{intended}} for the Indian and Australian route by the Cape of Good Hope. The result of large experience in steam navigation has proved {{that the size of}} the ship, (when steam is used), ought to be in proportion to the length of the voyage. Mr Brunel, the talented engineer to whose genius and perseverance this monster ship owes her existence, acting on this principle, calculated that the voyage to Australia and back being 22,500 miles--a vessel of 22,500 tons burden, (or a <b>ton</b> <b>burden</b> for every mile to be steamed), would require to be built, capable of carrying fuel for the entire voyage, it being impossible, without incurring enormous expense, to procure coal for such a vessel at intermediate ports.|$|E
60|$|I am much mistaken, too, if {{since the}} Revolution {{some very good}} ships have not been built at this town, and {{particularly}} the Melford or Milford galley, a ship of forty guns; as the Greyhound frigate, a man-of-war of thirty-six to forty guns, was at John's Ness. But what is this towards lessening the town of Ipswich, {{any more than it}} would be to say, they do not build men-of-war, or East India ships, or ships of five hundred <b>ton</b> <b>burden</b> at St. Catherines, or at Battle Bridge in the Thames? when we know that a mile or two lower, viz., at Radcliffe, Limehouse, or Deptford, they build ships of a thousand ton, and might build first-rate men-of-war too, if there was occasion; and the like might be done in this river of Ipswich, within about two or three miles of the town; so {{that it would not be}} at all an out-of-the-way speaking to say, such a ship was built at Ipswich, any more than it is to say, as they do, that the Royal Prince, the great ship lately built for the South Sea Company, was London built, because she was built at Limehouse.|$|E

60|$|It may be objected {{that the}} writer, feeling the danger so strongly, {{should have taken}} other means than fiction to put his views before the authorities. The answer to this {{criticism}} {{is that he did}} indeed adopt every possible method, that he personally approached leading naval men and powerful editors, that he sent three separate minutes upon the danger to various public bodies, notably to the Committee for National Defence, and that he touched upon the matter in an article in The Fortnightly Review. In some unfortunate way subjects of national welfare are in this country continually subordinated to party politics, so that a self- evident proposition, such as the danger of a nation being fed from without, is waved aside and ignored, because it will not fit in with some general political shibboleth. It is against this tendency that we have to guard in the future, and we have to bear in mind that the danger may recur, and that the remedies in the text (the only remedies ever proposed) have still to be adopted. They are the sufficient encouragement of agriculture, the making of adequate Channel tunnels, and the provision of submarine merchantmen, which, on the estimate of Mr. Lake, the American designer, could be made up to 7,000 <b>ton</b> <b>burden</b> at an increased cost of about 25 per cent. It is true that in this war the Channel tunnels would not have helped us much in the matter of food, but were France a neutral and supplies at liberty to come via Marseilles from the East, the difference would have been enormous.|$|E

60|$|Like {{all other}} vessels, sloops vary in size, {{but none of}} them attain to great magnitude. As a class, they are the {{smallest}} decked vessels we have. From 40 to 100 <b>tons</b> <b>burden</b> is a very common size. A sloop of 40 <b>tons</b> <b>burden</b> is what we ordinarily call a little ship, and one of 100 tons {{is by no means a}} big one. The hull of such a vessel being intended exclusively to carry cargo, very little space is allowed for the crew. The cabins of the smaller-sized sloops are seldom high enough to permit of an ordinary man standing erect. They are usually capable of affording accommodation to two in the cabin, and three or four in the forecastle,--and such accommodation is by no means ample. The class to which vessels belong is determined chiefly by the number of their masts and by the arrangement and the form of their sails.|$|R
25|$|James Mansfield {{says that}} in the fall of 1678, La Salle built a vessel of about 10 <b>tons</b> <b>burden</b> at Fort Frontenac and that this vessel, named Frontenac, was the first real sailing vessel on the Great Lakes; specifically, on Lake Ontario (which some at the time called Lac de Frontenac).
