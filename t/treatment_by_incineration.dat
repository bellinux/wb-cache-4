40|$|International audienceAs nanocomposites are {{increasingly}} {{used for a}} wide range of applications, they are expected to end up in waste treatment facilities. Thus, it seems appropriate to study at a lab-scale the thermal <b>treatment</b> <b>by</b> <b>incineration</b> of various nanocomposites. Our purpose is to identify the main mechanisms of thermal degradation involved when such materials are incinerated, and to fully characterize the raw gases emitted in the combustion chambers, prior implementing fluegas treatment processes (like filtration, etc). With experimental lab-devices, combustion tests are performed and coupled with raw gas analysis to provide a better understanding of the thermal degradation and emission mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|Mechanical-biological {{treatment}} of waste (MBP) is the processing or conversion of waste from human settlements with biologically degradable components via a combination of mechanical and other physical processes with biological processes. It is a technological alternative to waste incineration. It is applicable for the {{treatment of}} waste prior to depositing, but also for the production of refuse derived fuels (RDF). A capacity of about 2 million tons has been es-tablished in Europe since 10 years, and a broad technological variety including aerobic and an-aerobic bioprocesses is available. The process design is mainly based empirically, but biotech-nological information is widely used. The following figures characterise the process results: Up to 95 % of the degradable TOC and 94 % resp. 86 % of non-cellulosic carbohydrates resp. cel-lulose are metabolised. The stability of the treated waste is defined by a respiratory coefficient (AT 4), or a gas production coefficient (GB 21); typical process results on the technical scale are 5 mg/g dry matter for AT 4 and 20 l/kg dry matter for GB 21. Emissions from the processes include organic compounds metabolised or generated by bioprocesses, as methane and carbon dioxide, as well as volatile organics which are stripped out from the waste. A treatment by biofilters results in a 20 % to 50 % reduction, after a further <b>treatment</b> <b>by</b> <b>incineration</b> a value < 55 g TOC per ton of waste is achieved. The level of contaminants in both leachate and gas emissions from the landfill is reduced up to 95 % compared with untreated waste. One kilo-gram of treated waste potentially releases a total load of 1 – 3 g COD, 0. 5 – 1. 5 g TOC, and 0. 1 – 0. 2 g NH 4 -N into the leachate...|$|E
40|$|Pollution {{prevention}} {{can be very}} {{beneficial for}} a manufacturing company {{as well as for}} the environment. Pollution prevention through source reduction can save on environmental compliance costs, by minimizing the generation of hazardous yaste. Besides saving costs, hazardous waste minimization means less waste is generated, less waste is stored, and less waste is transported. Hazardous waste minimization also means less <b>by</b> <b>treatment,</b> <b>incineration,</b> and land disposal. Pollution prevention can mean improved profits, less hazardous waste impact on the environment, and less risk of hazardous waste impairment of the environment. Compliance with environmental laws a significant cost to the paint manufacturing industry.

Results revealed that the proposal is under the support of law and takes into consideration the National Policy for Solid Waste, but with continuous responsibility for its use so that environmental damage can be avoided. The method used for the economic-financial assessment was cost-effectiveness.

Promising experiences have been gained with a spray-injection incineration process, where a large combustion surface is created by atomizing the waste {{with the help of}} nozzles. Considering the design of a spray-injection combustion facility this thesis evaluates as well the material- and slurry specific- as the process- and apparatus-technical parameters. To perform corresponding experiments a laboratory facility was designed and constructed for testing of different nozzles in respect of their atomization characteristics. As carrier liquids were used water and a hydrocrack gasoil residue. The essential results of the experimental investigations are summarized. (orig.)

40|$|The thermal <b>treatment</b> {{of waste}} <b>by</b> <b>incineration</b> is {{considered}} an ultimate solution {{in order to get}} rid of waste properly by using the combustible properties of waste and transforming them into inert form and gaseous emission, with the main advantage of a huge reduction in mass and volume of treated waste, destruction of the dangerous components in waste, and obtaining green and clean energy from the exothermal reaction from the completed combustion process. In order to achieve the main goal of incineration, a good design, construction, supervision, and intensive operation and maintenance must be taken into account, especially for the small-scale incinerator. This research will deal with the green, innovative, and eco design and manufacturing technology of a 1 -ton per batch municipal solid waste (MSW) incinerator. The concept design of the incinerator will focus on the design of the feeding process where only one batch of waste will be discharged into the combustion chamber at one time instead of the semi-feed process, as found in the conventional incinerator. This will ease the operation of the operator and reduce the operating cost. Moreover, the innovative design includes the redesign of combustion air injection into either the primary or secondary combustion chamber in order to achieve the 3 Ts of combustion (time, temperature. and turbulence). This design can eliminate the use of an auxiliary burner in the primary combustion chamber. Rethinking the innovative design of using recirculation hot flue gas for preheating of wet garbage in order to pre-dry the waste before combustion is also taken into account. The manufacturing process of the wall composition as well as other parts of the incinerator are also examined...|$|R
