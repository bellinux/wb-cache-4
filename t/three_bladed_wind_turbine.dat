40|$|Wind turbine {{generator}} acoustics {{is an issue}} for communities as it is people within these communities that occupy dwellings. The current New Zealand wind turbine standard NZS 6808 : 2010 Acoustics – Wind Farm Noise, places priority on received sound pressure levels at dwellings remote from the wind turbine rather than from sound emission at the wind {{turbine generator}} itself. As part of assessment under NZS 6808 : 2010, background noise levels are required to be measured [as LA 90] at selected relevant receiving locations off site before a wind farm site can be developed. Allowable wind turbine design sound limits are then derived [as LAeq] from {{a comparison of the}} predicted wind turbine sound pressure levels and the actual measured average background noise at the nominated off site receiving location[s]. A disparity arises with the use of two different sound level descriptors used for assessment under the standard, namely the statistical LA 90 versus the LAeq energy average sound level descriptors. In order to account for the possible variation between the LA 90 and LAeq sound level descriptors NZS 6808 : 2010 requires LAeq predicted sound pressure levels to be ‘converted’ to received LA 90 sound pressure levels as part of the acoustic prediction process and hence NZS 6808 : 2010 states the predicted LAeq sound pressure levels at any receiver location are to be treated as equivalent to the LA 90 value. At the time of commencing this study the [then] current New Zealand wind turbine standard NZS 6808 : 1998 Acoustics – The Assessment and Measurement of Sound from Wind Turbine Generators stated that background noise levels were ‘typically 1. 5 dB to 2. 5 dB’ lower than the predicted LAeq sound pressure levels for wind turbine generator sound. Unlike the current standard, NZS 6808 : 1998 did not provide any means to account for the disparity between the background noise levels and predicted wind farm sound levels as part of the wind farm assessment process. A key implication being that under NZS 6808 : 1998 wind turbine sound could potentially exceed the allowable 40 dBA design sound limit [or average background noise level + 5 dB] by up to a further 2. 5 dB and still remain in compliance with the limits recommended under the NZS 6808 : 1998. The impetus and motivation behind this study has consequently been to endeavour to quantify the variability between wind turbine generator sound descriptors [LAeq and LA 90] both on the wind farm site and at a remote receiver dwelling location where people actually reside. The research outcome is relevant as at the time of commencing this thesis NZS 6808 : 1998 was being reviewed by experts and practitioners in the area of wind turbine acoustics. This review included assessing any differences in sound level descriptors. This review provided the incentive for the thesis being particularly valuable, unique and practical so far as any actual measured field results were relative to wind turbine generators in New Zealand and the New Zealand Standards operating environment. In order to carry out the evaluation between LAeq and LA 90 sound level descriptors an assessment based around a semi-empirical field study of objective field measurements and subjective observations was conducted at two wind farms in the lower North Island of New Zealand. The study assessed present day, commercial class, horizontal, <b>three</b> <b>bladed</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> generators located over heterogeneous terrain. The principal implication of the study related to the collection of uncontaminated wind turbine sound level samples. A raw data set of 11, 150 [10 minute LAeq/LA 90 sound level samples] were collected over a 12 month period. From the total sample, merely 39 [or less than 2 % of the total raw sample] were actual uncontaminated wind turbine sound samples only. The conclusion here is that due to the high number of intervening variables it is a challenge to collect a large sample set of uncontaminated wind turbine sound data. Based on the data collected, it could potentially take several years to collect a suitable uncontaminated sample of say 1, 500 [10 minute samples] from wind turbine sound only at remote locations off the wind farm site using such methods. Data collection and analysis was not an issue on the wind farm site itself due to the measurement location and wind turbine being in close proximity. The results of the field study illustrated that based on the final data set of 10 minutes sound level sampling [n= 39] the overall mean sound level difference [LAeq - LA 90] for wind turbine sound was 2. 4 dB at a remote residential location some 1200 m from the wind farm site. The overall mean sound level difference for wind turbine sound levels based on the wind farm was 1. 4 dB [at the nominated Ro location]. As a result of the study’s findings it is concluded that although the field data indicated a quantifiable level difference between the two sound level descriptors the current wind turbine noise standard [NZS 6808 : 2010] rightly removes any uncertainties by stating that LAeq = LA 90 when carrying out the assessment process. Therefore the removal of any uncertainty is chiefly {{due to the fact that}} although a quantifiable level difference between the two sound level descriptors was achieved for this study the sound level difference is prone to change and any precise or exact level difference is therefore a factor of the wind turbine generator models tested site conditions and related intervening variables...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} {{optimization}} of a variable speed, <b>three</b> <b>blade,</b> horizontal-axis <b>wind</b> <b>turbine.</b> The design parameters considered are the rotor diameter, hub height and generator capacity. The levelized cost {{of energy and}} simple payback are the figures of merit being minimized. Blade element momentum theory {{is used to calculate}} the power produced by the <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> rotor. Increasing the rotor diameter increases the power delivered to the generator at all wind speeds up to the limit of generator capacity. Increasing the generator capacity raises the limit on maximum power output. Increasing the hub height of a <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> increases power output due to the higher wind speeds at increased heights. However, all of these design changes involve an increase in capital cost. Furthermore, wind characteristics vary between wind resources. Therefore, the optimal <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> design will change depending on the wind resource. The model developed in this thesis is used to minimize the levelized cost of energy for various wind resources. The results of this study provide a guideline for the optimum <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> design in various wind resources. The model is also used to compare the difference between minimizing the levelized cost of energy and minimizing simple payback of a <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> located off the coast of Georgia. Simple payback is calculated by considering not only the total annual electricity produced and capital cost of the turbine but also the revenue the turbine will generate. Revenue is calculated from a time-dependent valuation of electrical power. The results of this study show that minimizing levelized cost of energy and minimizing simple payback result in the same optimum design for this particular site. The results show, however, that using a time-dependent valuation of electricity results in a different simple payback than when an average value of electricity is used. M. S.

It {{has been found to}} be the best industrial compromise in the range of different turbine constructions. The current wind industry innovation is conducted in the development of individual turbine components. The blade constitutes 20 - 25 % of the overall turbine budget. Its optimal operation in particular local economic and wind conditions is worth investigating. The blade geometry, namely the chord, twist and airfoil type distributions along the span, responds to the output measures of the blade performance. Therefore, the optimal <b>wind</b> <b>blade</b> geometry can improve the overall turbine performance.

This research work reports the development of condition monitoring (CM) for early fault detection in <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> <b>blades</b> based on vibration measurements. The research started with a background and a survey of methods used for monitoring <b>wind</b> <b>turbines.</b> Then, finite element modelling (FEM) of <b>three</b> <b>bladed</b> horizontal axis <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> (HAWT) was developed to understand the nature and mechanism of the induced vibration. A HAWT test rig was constructed and equipped with computerised vibration measuring system for model verification. Statistical and spectral processing parameters then were used to analyse vibration signals that collected in healthy and faulty cases. Results obtained using time and frequency based techniques are not suitable for extracting blades condition related information. Consequently, empirical mode decomposition method (EMD), principal component analysis method (PCA) and continuous wavelet transform (CWT) are applied for extraction blade condition related features from the measured vibration. The result showed that although these methods generally proved their success in other fields, they have failed to detect small faults or changes in blade structure. Therefore, new techniques were developed using the above mentioned methods combined with feature intensity level (FIL) and crest factor. Namely, those are EDFIL, RMPCA and wavelet based FIL. The new techniques are found to be reliable, robust and sensitive to the severity of faults. Those analysis techniques are suitable to be the detection tool for an integrated <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> condition monitoring system.

The complex {{has been designed to}} host a variety of other sporting activities. Fifty thousand spectators, including 10, 500 in the main grandstand, can be accommodated simultaneously. State-of-the art on-site media and broadcast facilities are available. The noise level emitted from vehicles on the circuit during the Formula- 1 event, on April 4 th 2004, was acceptable and caused no physical disturbance to the fans in the VIP lounges or to scholars studying at the University of Bahrain's Shakeir Campus, which is only 1. 5 km away from the circuit. The sound-intensity level (SIL) recorded on the balcony of the VIP lounge was 128 dB(A) and was 80 dB(A) inside the lounge. The calculated SIL immediately outside the lecture halls of the University of Bahrain was 70 dB(A) and 65 dB(A) within them. Thus racing at BIC can proceed without significantly disturbing the academic-learning process. The purchased electricity demand by the BIC complex peaked (at 4. 5 MW) during the first Formula- 1 event on April 4 th 2004. The reverse-osmosis (RO) plant at the BIC provides 1000 m 3 of desalinated water per day for landscape irrigation. Renewable-energy inputs, (i. e., via solar and wind power), at the BIC could be harnessed to generate electricity for water desalination, air conditioning, lighting as well as for irrigation.
