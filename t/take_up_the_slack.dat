25|$|The Wankel {{design is}} used in the seat belt {{pre-tensioner}} system in some Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen cars. When the deceleration sensors detect a potential crash, small explosive cartridges are triggered electrically, and the resulting pressurized gas feeds into tiny Wankel engines which rotate to <b>take</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>slack</b> in the seat belt systems, anchoring the driver and passengers firmly in the seat before a collision.|$|E
25|$|His {{theory of}} asabiyyah {{has often been}} {{compared}} to modern Keynesian economics, with Ibn Khaldun's theory clearly containing {{the concept of the}} multiplier. A crucial difference, however, is that whereas for John Maynard Keynes it is the middle class's greater propensity to save that is to blame for economic depression, for Ibn Khaldun it is the governmental propensity to save at times when investment opportunities do not <b>take</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>slack</b> which leads to aggregate demand.|$|E

500|$|On 1January 1985, in {{preparation}} for the introduction of the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet to Australian service, No.77 Squadron took over all Mirages and Macchi MB-326s of No.2 Operational Conversion Unit, assuming responsibility for fighter combat instructor, introductory fighter, and Mirage conversion courses. The transfer swelled the squadron's strength to fifty-six aircraft—forty Mirages and sixteen Macchis—and over 500 officers and men, making it the largest operational unit in the RAAF. Along with a heavily expanded training program, and its existing Australian Army close support role, No.77 Squadron's fleet support commitment was increased to <b>take</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>slack</b> resulting from the diminution of the Royal Australian Navy's fixed-wing capability. [...] Its last fatal accident with the Mirage occurred on 2May 1986; the aircraft crashed into water during air-to-air gunnery practice.|$|E
2500|$|With {{federal and}} state sources for {{redevelopment}} generally less available, local governments {{have been forced to}} find other ways to subsidize improvement projects in their localities, without directly raising taxes. One of the tools many states use to <b>take</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>slack</b> by lack of {{federal and state}} funding is Tax Increment Financing (TIF), which is a public financing method used for redevelopment and community improvement projects for more than 50 years. [...] Texas utilizes TIF by creating tax increment reinvestment zones (TIRZs) which may be initiated by the city or county or by petition of owners whose total holdings in the zone consist of a majority of the appraised property value.|$|E

"The British Government {{determined}} not to repair this broken cable, but to take it up and lay down a better one; so they chartered a large steamer, and fitted her up with engines, and a big drum that they use {{for that sort of}} thing, and set her to work to wind up the Madras end of the broken cable. She had been at this business a good while before we were caught by the other end, and when they got near enough to us for their engines to be able to <b>take</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>slack</b> from the bottom between us and them, then of course they pulled upon us, and we began to move. And when they lay to for the night, and stopped the winding business, of course we stopped, and the stretch of cable between the two ships had no effect upon us, except when the big mail steamer happened to move this way or that, as they kept her head to the wind; and that's the way we lay quiet all night except when we got our shocks.|$|E

Johnson joined the retired President Eisenhower at the dedication on May 1, 1962.|$|R
60|$|Assuredly we {{all felt}} {{that there would be}} no {{difficulty}} in soon hooking up with another sailfish. And precisely three minutes later I was standing up, leaning forward, all aquiver, watching my line fly off the reel. I hooked that fellow hard. He was heavy, and he did not come up or take off any length of line. Settling down slowly, he descended three or four hundred feet, or so it seemed, and began to plug, very much like an albacore, only much heavier. He fooled around down there for ten minutes, with me jerking at him all the time to irritate him, before he showed any sign of rising. At last I worried him into a fighting mood, and up he came, so fast that I did not even try to <b>take</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>slack,</b> and he shot straight up. This jump, like that of a kingfish, was wonderful. But it was so quick that the cameras could not cover it, and we missed a great picture. He went down, only to leap again. I reeled in the slack line and began to jerk at him to torment him, and I got him to jumping and threshing right near the boat. The sun was in the faces of the cameras and that was bad. And as it turned out not one of these exposures was good. What a chance missed! But we did not know that then, and we kept on tormenting him and snapping pictures of his leaps. In this way, which was not careless, but deliberate, I played with him until he shook out the hook. Fifteen leaps was his record.|$|E

25|$|As {{the piston}} moves in and out, the seal drags and {{stretches}} on the piston, causing the seal to twist. The seal distorts approximately 1/10 of a millimeter.

5000|$|... "Jumping the halyard" [...] is a {{technique}} used to raise a large sail quickly by employing a few crew members to work simultaneously on the halyard. The person jumping stands next to the mast and manually grabs the halyard as high as he can (sometimes this necessitates jumping) and pulling it down as fast and far as possible. While this crew member reaches for the next heave, a second crew member 'tails' or <b>takes</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>slack</b> created by <b>the</b> jumper, on a winch. When the person jumping can no longer pull <b>up</b> <b>the</b> sail simply by hanging on the halyard, he must [...] "sweat" [...] the line.|$|R
50|$|A torque {{amplifier}} is essentially two capstans connected together. A capstan {{consists of a}} drum that is connected to a powerful rotary source, typically the steam engine of the ship, or an electric motor in modern examples. To use the device, a rope is wound around the drum, with one end attached to a load, and the other hand-held by the user. Initially the rope has little tension and slips easily as the drum turns. However, if the user pulls on their end of the rope, the tension increases, gripping the drum. Now the entire torque of the driver {{is applied to the}} other end of the rope, pulling the load. If the user does nothing, the capstan will pull the load toward them, loosening the rope and stopping further motion. If <b>the</b> user instead <b>takes</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>slack,</b> <b>the</b> tension is maintained and the load continues to be pulled. In this way, the user can easily control the motion of a very large load.|$|R

Charles complained bitterly and often to his {{compassionate}} sister in-law about all of Meg's antics, and despite repeated pleas from her family, Meg was not about to be denied. She thrived on scandal and whatever scandal she made with her amoral, wealthy paramours, she unabashedly threw it in her family's face.

Despite her villainous nature, deep down inside, she really did love her sister and her family; although her actions usually didn't imply that.|$|R
50|$|In about 1134, {{the chronicle}} reveals that Óláfr founded the abbey of St Mary of Rushen on Mann by {{granting}} Ivo, Abbot of Furness land {{to establish the}} house. As a Savignac daughter house of the nearby abbey of St Mary of Furness—a religious house seated just across the Irish Sea in Lancashire—the abbey of Rushen was the first reformed house in the Isles, and its foundation partly evidences the importance of links between Mann and northern England. The abbey's foundation charter reveals that Óláfr granted the monks of Furness the right to elect the Bishop of the Isles, a provision that further emphasised Óláfr's royal prerogative. The charter implies that episcopal authority within his realm had fallen to outsiders, and expresses the king's desire that the Isles be administered by its own bishop. This could be evidence that the former diocesan bishop, Hamond, died several years previous, and that a period of vacancy ensued in which neighbouring bishops <b>took</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>slack.</b> <b>The</b> reestablishment of the Diocese of Whithorn in 1128, may have been undertaken in this context, and may also signal the loss of western Galloway from the Kingdom of the Isles.|$|R
