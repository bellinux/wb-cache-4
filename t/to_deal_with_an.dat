5|$|Shira Mendelman, an 18-year-old Hasidic girl {{living in}} Tel Aviv, {{is looking forward}} to an {{arranged}} marriage with a young man whom she likes. However, on Purim, her family suffers a tragedy when Shira's older sister Esther dies in childbirth. Shira's father subsequently delays the engagement so as not to have <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> empty house so soon after Esther's death. Esther's husband, Yochay, begins to regularly bring their son, Mordechai, to the Mendelman's house, where Shira cares for him.|$|E
5|$|After this victory, the Normans took Dyrrhachium in February 1082 and {{advanced}} inland, capturing most of Macedonia and Thessaly. Robert was then {{forced to leave}} Greece <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> attack on his ally, the Pope, by the Holy Roman Emperor, Henry IV (r. 1084–1105). Robert left his son Bohemond {{in charge of the}} army in Greece. Bohemond was initially successful, defeating Alexios in several battles, but was defeated by Alexios outside Larissa. Forced to retreat to Italy, Bohemond lost all the territory gained by the Normans in the campaign. The Byzantine recovery began the Komnenian restoration.|$|E
5|$|By 9:00am it was {{apparent}} that the two gunmen possessed superior weapons and ample ammunition. The police officers in charge on the scene, Superintendent Mulvaney and Chief Superintendent Stark, contacted Assistant Commissioner Major Frederick Wodehouse at Scotland Yard. He telephoned the Home Office and obtained permission from Churchill to bring in a detachment of Scots Guards, who were stationed at the Tower of London. It {{was the first time that}} the police had requested military assistance in London <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> armed siege. Twenty-one volunteer marksmen from the Guards arrived at about 10:00am and took firing positions at each end of the street and in the houses opposite. The shooting continued without either side gaining any advantage.|$|E

5|$|However, between March 14 and 15, the ARVN 2nd Infantry Regiment {{was forced}} to turn back from Tam Kỳ <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> attack on Thang Binh, by the Viet Cong 70th and 72nd Local Force Battalions. In {{southern}} Quảng Ngãi, the Viet Cong 94th Local Force Regiment attacked Binh Son, cut off a section of National Highway 1 near Chau O, and the ARVN 4th Infantry Regiment (2nd Infantry Division) was pinned down {{trying to deal with}} Viet Cong attacks. Thus, South Vietnamese attempts to stage an effective counter-attack were quickly blunted by the combined Viet Cong and North Vietnamese forces in Quảng Ngãi Province. Recognising that he no longer has the manpower to mount a counter-attack, General Nhut ordered his troops to abandon Tra Bong and Son Ha, and concentrate his units in Tam Kỳ and Chu Lai instead.|$|E
5|$|The tower's gun {{installations}} {{were intended}} to be used <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> external threat approaching from {{the far side of}} the river. The parapet of the roof was crenellated with nine wide embrasures, and the embrasures facing out across the river were constructed flush with the floor of the roof, giving the bombards plenty of room to fire. The embrasures facing away from the river, however, had sloping cills rather than open positions, and the windows in the tower facing towards the city were rectangular and relatively unprotected. The entrance to the tower itself was not fortified, as the tower was not expected to be defended from a direct attack by land.|$|E
5|$|As {{events in}} Ngok Tavak unfolded, White sent urgent {{messages}} to Company C, 5th Special Forces Headquarters in Đà Nẵng, {{as well as}} to the Americal Division, to request support. In response, the 5th Special Forces Headquarters ordered Captain Eugene Makowski to fly to Khâm Đức, where he would assume command of the 12th Mobile Strike Force Company, to reinforce White's beleaguered soldiers at Ngok Tavak. Then, just before sunrise, Colonel Trí ordered the 40th Battalion to pull out of Ngok Tavak in order <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> enemy relief force, and leave behind only a blocking force to hold the captured positions inside the garrison. Following those events, Australian Warrant Officers Cameron and Lucas mounted a counter-attack using a handful of Nung soldiers in an attempt to retake captured positions. At that point, those Marines who had survived the main battle decided to join the fight, and as the Australian-led formation moved through the Ngok Tavak garrison, they gradually pushed the last remaining enemy soldiers beyond the defensive perimeter.|$|E

5|$|During 1783, Curtis {{was sent}} to Morocco to renew {{treaties}} with the country and then remained in Gibraltar, accepting the Spanish peace treaty delegates at the war's end. Brilliant was paid off in 1784, although Curtis remained in employment during the peace, commanding HMS Ganges as guardship at Portsmouth. In 1787 he was placed on half-pay, {{although it has been}} speculated that during this period he conducted a secret mission to Scandinavia to ensure British supplies on naval materials from the region in the event of war. In the Spanish armament of 1790, Curtis was briefly made flag captain of HMS Queen Charlotte under Howe, but soon transferred to HMS Brunswick. As captain of Brunswick, Curtis had <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> outbreak of a deadly and infectious fever. He was successful in controlling the disease and later published and advisory pamphlet on techniques for other officers to follow when faced with contagion aboard their ships.|$|E
5|$|On {{the eve of}} {{unveiling}} a {{new type}} of augmentation that will negate the use of Neuropozyne, Sarif Industries is attacked by the Tyrants. Adam Jensen attempts to save Megan Reed and her fellow scientists, but Tyrant leader Namir critically wounds him and apparently kills Megan and the scientists. David Sarif uses his most advanced technology to save Adam, giving him superhuman abilities: he also learns that the augmentations are bonding to him naturally without the need for Neuropozyne. Called back <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> attack on a Sarif Industries warehouse by anti-augmentation extremists, Adam discovers an augmented hacker attempting {{to gain access to the}} secret Typhoon weapon augmentation. Upon discovery, the hacker is forced by their controller to shoot himself. After Adam retrieves the deceased hacker's neural hub from his old Detroit police precinct, Frank Pritchard tracks the hacking signal to an abandoned factory in Highland Park. Adam discovers the Tyrants guarding a FEMA detention camp, but they are moving out after the failure of the Sarif raid. Adam confronts and defeats one of the mercenaries, Barrett, who tells him to go to Hengsha before killing himself with a grenade.|$|E
5|$|Bragg {{retained}} his position, relieving or reassigning {{the generals}} who had testified against him, and retaliated against Longstreet by reducing his command to only those units {{that he brought}} with him from Virginia. Despite the dysfunctional command climate under Bragg, and the lack of support from the War Department and President Davis concerning Bragg's removal, Longstreet did the best he could to continue to seek options in the Chattanooga Campaign. While Bragg resigned himself and his army to the siege of the Union Army of the Cumberland in Chattanooga, Longstreet devised a strategy to prevent reinforcement and a lifting of the siege by Grant. He knew this Union reaction was underway, and that the nearest railhead was Bridgeport, Alabama, where portions of two Union corps would soon arrive. After sending his artillery commander, Porter Alexander, to reconnoiter the Union-occupied town, he devised a plan to shift most of the Army of Tennessee away from the siege, setting up logistical support in Rome, Georgia, to go after Bridgeport to take the railhead, possibly catching Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker and arriving Union troops from the Eastern Theater in a disadvantageous position. The plan was well received and approved by President Davis, but it was disapproved by Bragg, who objected to the significant logistical challenges it posed. Longstreet accepted Bragg's arguments and agreed to a plan in which he and his men were dispatched to East Tennessee <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> advance by the Union Army of the Ohio, commanded by Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside. Longstreet was selected for this assignment partially due to enmity on Bragg's part, but also because the War Department intended for Longstreet's men to return to Lee's army and this movement was in that direction.|$|E

5|$|The {{first major}} {{campaign}} {{of the new}} reign was directed against the Khurramites in Adharbayjan and Arran. The Khurramite revolt {{had been going on}} since 816/7, aided by the inaccessible mountains of the province and the absence of large Arab Muslim population centres, except for a few cities in the lowlands. Al-Ma'mun had left the local Muslims largely to their own devices, although a succession of military commanders tried to subdue the rebellion on their own initiative, and thus gain control of the country's newly discovered mineral resources, only to be defeated by the Khurramites under the capable leadership of Babak. Immediately after his accession, al-Mu'tasim sent the Tahirid ṣāḥib al-shurṭa of Baghdad and Samarra, Ishaq ibn Ibrahim ibn Mus'ab, <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> expansion of the Khurramite rebellion from Jibal into Hamadan. Ishaq achieved success swiftly, and by December 833 had suppressed the rebellion, forcing many Khurramites to seek refuge in the Byzantine Empire. It was only in 835 that al-Mu'tasim took action against Babak himself, when he assigned his trusted and capable lieutenant, al-Afshin, to command the campaign against him. After three years of cautious and methodical campaigning, al-Afshin was able to capture Babak at his capital of Budhdh on 26 August 837, extinguishing the rebellion. Babak was brought captive to Samarra, where, on 3 January 838, he was paraded before the people seated on an elephant, and then publicly executed.|$|E
