Two subgenuses of trypanosomes were identified from ungulates in Europe. Trypanosoma evansi and T. equiperdum, flagellates of the subgenus Trypanozoon, could cause fatal infections to their hosts.

However, a highly distinctive morphological feature of trypanosome appeared in baby hamster kidney (BHK) cell culture in with non-thrown blood bully coat. The different stages and typical ultrastructures of trypanosome were observed in our isolate. The isolate was subsequently identified as T. theileri by species-specific PCR assay (Tth 625), 18 S rDNA sequencing alignment and internal transcribed spacer of ribosomal genes (ITS) as a marker for molecular phylogenetic analysis.

40|$|Megatrypanum trypanosomes {{have been}} {{isolated}} {{from a number}} of different European Cervidae, but on the basis of morphology it has not been possible to define the species to which these isolates belong. We isolated <b>Trypanosoma</b> (Megatrypanum) <b>theileri</b> from 10 cattle, and Megatrypanum trypanosomes from 11 fallow deer (Cervus dama), 9 red deer (Cervus elaphus), and 4 roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) by blood culture on a biphasic medium (NNN agar slopes). Trypanosomes were propagated in Schneider's Drosophila medium and characterized by isoenzyme analysis and molecular karyotyping. Isocitrate dehydrogenase and phosphoglucomutase were visualized after starch gel electrophoresis of trypanosome lysates. By cluster analysis of this data all isolates from deer were clearly separated from the T. (M.) theileri isolates from cattle. Isolates from roe deer were different not only from T.

Thus, there are probably at least two different species of Megatrypanum trypanosomes in the three Cervidae. One parasitizing roe deer, the other, apparently less host specific species, infecting red deer and fallow deer. Separation of the chromosomes of Megatrypanum trypanosomes by pulsed-field gradient gel electrophoresis (PFGE) showed that each isolate contained a large number (> 18) of chromosomes ranging in size from 300 to > 2200 kb.

Analysis of polymorphic sequences of {{a larger number of}} trypanosomes from broader geographical origins is required to evaluate the Clustering of isolates as suggested by previous studies. Here, we determined the sequences of the spliced leader (SL) genes of 21 isolates from cattle and 2 from water buffalo from distant regions of Brazil. Analysis of SL gene repeats revealed that the 5 S rRNA gene is inserted within the intergenic region. Phylogeographical patterns inferred using SL sequences showed at least 5 major genotypes of T. theileri distributed in 2 strongly divergent lineages. Lineage TthI comprises genotypes IA and IB from buffalo and cattle, respectively, from the Southeast and Central regions, whereas genotype IC is restricted to cattle from the Southern region. Lineage Tth II includes cattle genotypes IIA, which is restricted to the North and Northeast, and IIB, found in the Centre, West, North and Northeast.

Based on these findings, we conducted further investigations using a special antibody in immunofluorescence confocal images. Moreover, we examined a series of possible events of cell invasion in T. theileri. The results revealed that GM 1, a marker of membrane rafts, was implicated in the mechanism of entry by this parasite. After incubation with tissue culture trypomastigotes, the gelatinolytic activity was significantly increased and accumulated at the attachment sites. Using ultrastructural localization detection by CytoTracker live imaging and confocal immunofluorescence microscopy, we found that lysosome fusion and the autophagy pathway were engaged in invaginating processes. T. theileri amastigotes also invaded cells and were enclosed by the lysosomes. Furthermore, tissue-cultured trypomastigotes were found to be capable of triggering intracellular free Ca 2 + transients and TGF- -signaling. Our findings that intracellular amastigote stages exist in mammalian cells infected with T. theileri and that the invasion processes involved various host cell components and cell signalings were extremely surprising and warrant further investigation...|$|R

Analysis of 78 CATL catalytic domain sequences from 22 T. theileri trypanosomes disclosed 6 genotypes tightly clustered together into the T. theileri clade. The CATL genes in these trypanosomes are organized in tandem arrays of similar to 1. 7 kb located in 2 chromosomal bands of 600 - 720 kb. A diagnostic PCR assay targeting CATL sequences detected T. theileri of all genotypes from cattle, buffaloes and cervids and also from tabanid vectors. Expression of T. theileri cysteine proteases was demonstrated by proteolytic activity in gelatin gels and hydrolysis of Z-Phe-Arg-AMC substrate.

We considered the possibility that intracellular members of the APOL 1 family, against which extracellular trypanosomes could not have evolved resistance, could kill pathogenic T. brucei subspecies. Here we show that recombinant APOL 3 (rAPOL 3) kills all African trypanosomes, including T. b. rhodesiense, T. b. gambiense and the animal pathogens Trypanosoma evansi, Trypanosoma congolense and Trypanosoma vivax. However, rAPOL 3 did not kill more distant trypanosomes such as <b>Trypanosoma</b> <b>theileri</b> or Trypanosoma cruzi. This trypanolytic potential was partially shared by rAPOL 1 from Papio papio (rPpAPOL 1). The differential killing ability of rAPOL 3 and rAPOL 1 was associated with a distinct dependence on acidic pH for activity. Due both to its instability and toxicity when injected into mice, rAPOL 3 cannot be used for the treatment of infection, but an experimental rPpAPOL 1 mutant inspired by APOL 3 exhibited enhanced trypanolytic activity in vitro and the ability to completely inhibit T. b. gambiense infection in mice.

Measurements of the total length of T. theileri in thick blood smears (material which was shown to be usable by comparative statistical tests of varied preparations of Trypanosoma lewisi) yielded a mean of 47. 2 μ (range 24 to 61 μ) for a total of over 1000 specimens. This is very close to the original description of this species by Laveran (1902) and differs from measurements of other stercorarian trypanosomes described from cattle. During the course of infection, the sizes of the trypanosomes increased steadily, then decreased, and latterly they bore some resemblance to the "stumpy" forms of polymorphic salivarian trypanosomes.

40|$|AbstractApproximately 306 {{species of}} {{terrestrial}} and arboreal mammals {{are known to}} have inhabited the mainland and coastal islands of Australia at the time of European settlement in 1788. The exotic Trypanosoma lewisi was the first mammalian trypanosome identified in Australia in 1888, while the first native species, Trypanosoma pteropi, was taxonomically described in 1913. Since these discoveries, about 22 % of the indigenous mammalian fauna have been examined during the surveillance of trypanosome biodiversity in Australia, including 46 species of marsupials, 9 rodents, 9 bats and both monotremes. Of those mammals examined, trypanosomes have been identified from 28 host species, with eight native species of Trypanosoma taxonomically described. These native trypanosomes include T. pteropi, Trypanosoma thylacis, Trypanosoma hipposideri, Trypanosoma binneyi, Trypanosoma irwini, Trypanosoma copemani, Trypanosoma gilletti and Trypanosoma vegrandis. Exotic trypanosomes have also been identified from the introduced mammalian fauna of Australia, and include T. lewisi, Trypanosoma melophagium, <b>Trypanosoma</b> <b>theileri,</b> Trypanosoma nabiasi and Trypanosoma evansi. Fortunately, T. evansi was eradicated soon after its introduction and did not establish in Australia. Of these exotic trypanosomes, T. lewisi is the sole representative that has been reported from indigenous Australian mammals; morphological forms were recorded from two indigenous species of rodents (Hydromys chrysogaster and Rattus fuscipes). Numerous Australian marsupial species are potentially at risk from the native T. copemani, which may be chronically pathogenic, while marsupials, rodents and monotremes appear at risk from exotic species, including T. lewisi, Trypanosoma cruzi and T. evansi.

40|$|During two {{consecutive}} surveys (February and August/Sept 2002), {{a total of}} 970 cattle from the cattle population of Mafia Island (United Republic of Tanzania) were blood-sampled. All blood samples were microscopically screened {{for the presence of}} trypanosomes and a portion of these were checked for antibodies with an Ab-ELISA and for the presence of trypanosomal DNA with PCR. Microscopic evidence of trypanosomes of the congolense group (sub-genus Nannomonas) was found in 0. 8 % of the animals (8 / 970) and in two cases the species identified was confirmed by PCR as Trypanosoma congolense savannah type. Non-pathogenic <b>Trypanosoma</b> <b>theileri</b> were detected in 3. 2 % (31 / 970) of the samples using the Dark Ground-Buffy Coat (DG-BC) technique. For survey 1 (S 1), detection of antibodies (Ab-ELISA) against pathogenic trypanosomes indicated a seroprevalence of 14. 2 % (68 / 480). Of the samples, either DG positive or with a PCV lower then 25, examined by PCR, a total of 8. 4 % (5 / 59) (selected from 970 samples), were found positive for T. congolense. The low prevalence of pathogenic trypanosomes on Mafia Island is intriguing, especially in view of the omnipresence of the tsetse fly Glossina brevipalpis. Although the presence of detected trypanosomal antibodies does not necessarily indicate a current infection, the combination of serological/parasitological examinations and the results of the PCR do support this low prevalence of trypanosomosis in cattle. Despite the low prevalence, pathogenic trypanosomes are present on Mafia Island and possible reasons for this low infection rate, taking account of the relation between Glossina species present, transmission risk and trypanosomes found in cattle, are discussed also in view of a future appropriate intervention strategy...|$|E
40|$|There are {{hundreds}} of Trypanosoma species {{that live in the}} blood and tissue spaces of their vertebrate hosts.

Here, a detailed genome sequence and a transcriptome analysis of gene expression in bloodstream form T. theileri have been performed. Analysis of the genome sequence and expression showed that T. theileri has a typical kinetoplastid genome structure and allowed a prediction that it is capable of meiotic exchange, gene silencing via RNA interference and, potentially, density-dependent growth control. In particular, the transcriptome analysis has allowed a comparison of two distinct trypanosome cell surfaces, T. brucei and T. theileri, that have each evolved to enable the maintenance of a long-term extracellular infection in cattle. The T. theileri cell surface can be modelled to contain a mixture of proteins encoded by four novel large and divergent gene families and by members of a major surface protease gene family. This surface composition is distinct from the uniform variant surface glycoprotein coat on African trypanosomes providing an insight into a second mechanism used by trypanosome species that proliferate in an extracellular milieu in vertebrate hosts to avoid the adaptive immune response...|$|E
40|$|In this study, we {{describe}} the first survey in Thailand of <b>Trypanosoma</b> <b>theileri,</b> a widespread and prevalent parasite of cattle that is transmitted by tabanid flies. Investigation of 210 bovine blood samples of Thai cattle from six farms by hematocrit centrifuge technique (HCT) revealed 14 samples with trypanosomes morphologically compatible to T. theileri. Additional animals were positive for T. theileri by PCR based on the Cathepsin L-like sequence (TthCATL-PCR) despite negative by HCT, indicating cryptic infections. Results revealed a prevalence of 26 +/- 15 % (95 % CI) of T. theileri infection. Additionally, 12 samples positive for T. theileri were detected in cattle from other 11 farms. From a total of 30 blood samples positive by HCT and/or PCR from 17 farms, seven were characterized to evaluate the genetic polymorphism of T. theileri through sequence analysis of PCR-amplified CATL DNA sequences. All CATL sequences of T. theileri from Thai cattle clustered with sequences of the previously described phylogenetic lineages TthI and TthII, supporting only two major lineages of T. theileri in cattle around the world. However, 11 of the 29 CATL sequences analyzed showed to be different, disclosing an unexpectedly large polymorphic genetic repertoire, with multiple genotypes of T. theileri not previously described in other countries circulating in Thai cattle.

40|$|Babesia bovis is {{the most}} virulent Babesia organism, {{resulting}} in a high mortality rate in cattle. The genetic diversity of B. bovis merozoite surface antigens (MSAs), such as MSA- 1, MSA- 2 b, and MSA- 2 c, might be linked to altered immune profiles in the host animals. The present study aimed to develop type-specific PCR assays for Asian msa- 1 genotypes, thereby re-analyzing the genetic diversity of msa- 1 in Sri Lanka, Mongolia, and Vietnam. Specific primers were designed for nine Asian msa- 1 genotypes, which had been detected based on the phylogeny constructed using msa- 1 gene sequences retrieved from the GenBank database. Specificity of the type-specific PCR assays was confirmed using plasmids containing the inserts of msa- 1 gene fragments that represent Asian genotypes. Furthermore, no amplicons were observed by these PCR assays when DNA samples of Babesia bigemina, Babesia ovata, Theileria annulata, Theileria orientalis, Trypanosoma evansi, <b>Trypanosoma</b> <b>theileri,</b> Anaplasma marginale, and Anaplasma bovis, and non-infected bovine blood were analyzed. In total, 109 B. bovis-positive blood DNA samples sourced from Sri Lanka (44 cattle), Mongolia (26 cattle), and Vietnam (23 cattle and 16 water buffaloes) were then screened by the type-specific PCR assays. The sequences derived {{from all of the}} PCR amplicons were phylogenetically analyzed. Out of 109 DNA samples, 23 (20 from cattle and 3 from water buffaloes) were positive for at least one genotype. In agreement with previous studies, five and four different genotypes were detected among the DNA samples from Sri Lanka and Vietnam, respectively. In contrast, four genotypes, including three novel genotypes, were detected from Mongolia. Five DNA samples were found to be co-infected with multiple genotypes. The sequences of the PCR amplicons clustered phylogenetically within the corresponding clades. These findings indicated that the type-specific PCR assays described herein are useful for the determination of genotypic diversity of the B. bovis msa- 1 gene in Asia...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Animal African trypanosomiasis (AAT) greatly affects {{livestock}} production in sub-Saharan Africa. In Ghana prevalence of AAT {{is estimated to}} range between 5 and 50 %. Studies have reported serum biochemical aberrations and variability in cytokine profiles in animals during infection. However, information regarding the biochemical parameters and cytokine profiles associated with natural infections are limited. This study was therefore aimed at investigating changes in the levels of serum biochemical parameters and inflammatory cytokines during a natural infection. Methods Nested internal transcribed spacer (ITS) -based PCR and sequencing were used to characterise trypanosome infection in cattle at two areas in Ghana (Adidome and Accra) of different endemicities. The cattle were sampled at four to five-week intervals {{over a period of}} six months. Levels of serum biochemical parameters, including creatinine, cholesterol, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total bilirubin and total protein and cytokines (interleukin 10, interleukin 4, interleukin 12, interferon gamma and tumor necrosis factor alpha) were measured in serum samples and then compared between infected cattle and uninfected controls. Results The predominant trypanosome species detected in Accra (non-endemic) and Adidome (endemic) were <b>Trypanosoma</b> <b>theileri</b> and Trypanosoma vivax, respectively. Serum biochemical parameters were similar between infected and uninfected cattle in Accra. Infected cattle at Adidome however, had significantly higher levels of ALP, creatinine, total protein and total bilirubin (P <  0. 05) and significantly lower levels of cholesterol (P <  0. 05) at specific time points. At basal levels and during infection, significantly higher pro-inflammatory to anti-inflammatory (Th 1 /Th 2) cytokine ratios were observed in cattle at Adidome compared to Accra (P <  0. 05), indicating a shift towards Th 1 immune response in Adidome. Levels of IL- 10 were, however, significantly elevated in infected cattle in Accra (P <  0. 05), suggesting high anti-inflammatory cytokine response in Accra. Conclusion These results suggests that cattle in an endemic area repeatedly infected with trypanosomes of different species or different antigenic types demonstrate high pro-inflammatory (Th 1) immune response and biochemical alterations whereas cattle in a non-endemic area with predominantly chronic T. theileri infections demonstrate high anti-inflammatory response and no biochemical alterations...|$|E
40|$|To {{face the}} {{worldwide}} threat of Surra caused by Trypanosoma evansi, international organizations have {{stressed the need}} to evaluate and standardize diagnostic tools. PCR detection of T. evansi has known a great expansion during the last 20 years, but primer sets are often insufficiently assessed and compared. In this work, we compared the performances of six primer pairs-TBR 1 / 2 (Masiga et al., 1992), ESAG 6 / 7 (Holland et al., 2001 a, b), TEPAN 1 / 2 (Panyim et al., 1993), pMUTEC F/R (Wuyts et al., 1994), TRYP 1 R/S (Desquesnes et al., 2001) and TRYP 4 R/S (Desquesnes et al., unpublished) -tested with purified T. evansi DNA serial dilutions, T. evansi-infected rat blood serial dilutions and Thai dairy cattle samples. TBR 1 / 2 primer set was able to detect 0. 01 pg of purified DNA, and a parasitaemia below one parasite per ml in rat blood. They presented the highest sensitivity in cattle samples {{as well as a}} high specificity, without non-specific products nor false positive reactions out of 84 negative cattle samples tested. ESAG 6 / 7 showed equivalent results with purified DNA and rat samples but presented non-specific products with Thai dairy cattle samples, leading to non interpretable results. TEPAN 1 / 2 was not able to detect less than 0. 1 pg of purified DNA or 50 trypanosomes/ml in rat blood. In cattle, TEPAN 1 / 2 primers detected only 36 % of the positives detected by TBR 1 / 2. Given the parasitemic level detected, pMUTEC F/R, TRYP 1 R/S and TRYP 4 R/S were not more sensitive than classical microscopic examination of the buffy coat. TBR 1 / 2, TEPAN 1 / 2, pMUTEC F/R and TRYP 4 R/S did not cross-reacted with Babesia sp., <b>Trypanosoma</b> <b>theileri</b> and Anaplasma marginale. TBR 1 / 2 was the most sensitive primer set to detect T. evansi in purified DNA, rodent blood and cattle blood, and did not show cross reaction with the other pathogens tested: it should be therefore preferred for epidemiological surveys. These results confirmed that TBR 1 / 2 primers remain the reference for the detection of Trypanozoon DNA and should therefore be included in subsequent evaluations of new diagnosis tools based on DNA detection.
