50|$|Aggression and {{punishment}} {{are not just}} found in insects. For example, in naked mole rats, punishments by the queen are a way she motivates <b>the</b> <b>lazier,</b> less-related workers in their groups. The queen would shove <b>the</b> <b>lazier</b> workers, with <b>the</b> number of shoves increasing when there are fewer active workers. Reeve found that if the queen is removed when colonies are satiated, {{there is a significant}} drop in weight of the active workers because <b>the</b> <b>lazier</b> workers are taking advantage of the system.|$|R

25|$|The {{architecture}} of Ferdowsi's tomb is {{also influenced by}} poet's own personal life, reflecting a constant struggle between the poor poet and <b>the</b> <b>lazy</b> king, and adversity and hope. The Society for National Heritage in 1930s drawing on poet's attempt to revitalize the Persian language, also attempted to revitalize Persian culture and Iranian identity through architecture. This {{was in many ways}} taken literary with Persian poems from Shahnameh etched into the white marble facets of the edifice of the poet's mausoleum.|$|E

The EP narrowly missed out on the UK top 40, peaking at No.41. The last of the 1997 EPs was October's 3.. 6.. 9 Seconds of Light. The EP was made Single of the Week in both the NME and Melody Maker and reached No.32 in the charts, thus becoming the band's first top 40 single.|$|E

25|$|Lowell {{immediately}} embarked upon {{a series}} of reforms that were both academic and social in nature. Under his predecessor, Charles W. Eliot, Harvard had replaced the single standardized undergraduate course with a system that allowed students free choice of electives. That was a logical extension of the trend in U.S. education that had modeled the university on the German system, including the German principle of student freedom in choosing courses. So dominant was Harvard's role in American education that all large American colleges and universities had adopted the elective system by 1904. It appealed to all student types, those intellectually curious and energetic as well as <b>the</b> <b>lazy</b> without intellectual ambition.|$|E
25|$|Gli indifferenti was {{published}} {{at his own}} expense, costing 5,000 Italian lira. Literary critics described the novel as a noteworthy example of contemporary Italian narrative fiction. The next year, Moravia started collaborating with the newspaper La Stampa, then edited by author Curzio Malaparte. In 1933, together with Mario Pannunzio, he founded the literary review magazines Caratteri (Characters) and Oggi (Today) and started writing for the newspaper Gazzetta del Popolo. The years leading to World War II were difficult for Moravia as an author; the Fascist regime prohibited reviews of Le ambizioni sbagliate (1935), seized his novel La mascherata (Masquerade, 1941) and banned Agostino (Two Adolescents, 1941). In 1935 he traveled to the United States to give a lecture series on Italian literature. L'imbroglio (The Cheat) {{was published}} by Bompiani in 1937. To avoid Fascist censorship, Moravia wrote mainly in the surrealist and allegoric styles; among the works is Il sogno del pigro (The Dream of <b>the</b> <b>Lazy).</b> The Fascist seizure of the second edition of La mascherata in 1941, forced him to write under a pseudonym. That same year, he married the novelist Elsa Morante, whom he had met in 1936. They lived in Capri, where he wrote Agostino. After the Armistice of September 8, 1943, Moravia and Morante took refuge in Fondi, {{on the border of}} Ciociaria; the experience inspired La ciociara (The Woman of Ciociara, 1958).|$|E

500|$|Shaw espoused racial equality, and inter-marriage {{between people}} of {{different}} races. Despite his expressed wish {{to be fair to}} Hitler, he called anti-Semitism [...] "the hatred of <b>the</b> <b>lazy,</b> ignorant fat-headed Gentile for the pertinacious Jew who, schooled by adversity to use his brains to the utmost, outdoes him in business". In The Jewish Chronicle he wrote in 1932, [...] "In every country you can find rabid people who have a phobia against Jews, Jesuits, Armenians, Negroes, Freemasons, Irishmen, or simply foreigners as such. Political parties are not above exploiting these fears and jealousies." ...|$|E

The following year, the FlowRider, and Pipeline Paradise opened as Wipeout Beach. Six years later, WaterWorks was renamed to Crocodile Dundee's Boomerang Bay Waterpark (later simplified to Boomerang Bay Waterpark). In 2012, the water park was re-branded to Cedar Fair's Soak City.

500|$|Sylvia Anderson {{suggested}} that American audiences, who were less {{familiar with the}} Supermarionation productions of Century 21, were more enthusiastic. She explained, [...] "It was {{all too easy to}} compare our real actors with our puppet characters and descriptions such as 'wooden', 'expressionless', 'no strings attached' and 'puppet-like' were cheap shots some of the UK critics could not resist... Typecasting is <b>the</b> <b>lazy</b> man's friend, and boy, were we typecast in Britain." [...] On Doppelg√§nger, she said in 1992, [...] "I saw it on TV {{a couple of years ago}} and I was very pleased with it. I thought it came over quite well." ...|$|E
500|$|Among the {{stereotypes}} {{of blacks in}} Uncle Tom's Cabin are the [...] "happy darky" [...] (in <b>the</b> <b>lazy,</b> carefree character of Sam); the light-skinned tragic mulatto as a sex object (in the characters of Eliza, Cassy, and Emmeline); the affectionate, dark-skinned female mammy (through several characters, including Mammy, a cook at the St. Clare plantation); the pickaninny stereotype of black children (in the character of Topsy); the Uncle Tom, an African American who is too eager to please white people. Stowe intended Tom to be a [...] "noble hero".

500|$|The Workmans {{returned}} to Kashmir in 1906, {{and were the}} first Westerners to explore the Nun Kun massif. For this trip, the couple hired six Italian porters from the Alps, 200 local porters, and Savoye returned as guide. As Isserman, Weaver and Molenaar explain in their history of Himalayan mountaineering, the Workmans despised the local porters but were forced to recruit them; [...] "their otherwise invaluable books read like one long, anguished harangue against <b>the</b> <b>lazy,</b> lying, thieving, mutinous cheats on whom they unhappily depended for local support".

500|$|Originally {{the park}} {{featured}} {{a swimming pool}} built just past the wall in right field, level with {{the top of the}} outfield fence. Groups were able to rent out the pool during the game. [...] In 2016, the pool was replaced by the Choctaw Lazy River. [...] All ticketed guests have full 360-degree access to swim, wade or float on the gently-flowing lazy river, which measures longer from end-to-end (almost 175 feet) than an Olympic-size swimming pool and nearly as long as an NHL ice rink. A full lap around <b>the</b> <b>Lazy</b> River will take you over 400 feet - the distance from home plate to the center field wall. [...] For Thursdays and most Sunday home games, the Choctaw Lazy River is the site of a [...] "pool party" [...] with tickets available to the general public.|$|E
500|$|Reed's regular readers {{included}} the young P.G. Wodehouse, who particularly loved the school stories. Wodehouse's literary biographer Benny Green, while excoriating Reed as a [...] "hereditary prig" [...] and a [...] "religious huckster", accepts that he influenced Wodehouse, and cites in particular The Willoughby Captains. Green also echoes Quigly in asserting {{that none of}} Reed's successors could match his abilities as a storyteller. Quigly summarises Reed's legacy to future school story writers: he established a genre by [...] "alter the shapeless, long-winded, garrulous and moralistic school story" [...] into something popular and readable, a convention followed by all his successors. Reed himself expressed the guiding principles {{of his life in}} a letter addressed to a new Boys' Club in Manchester: [...] "The strong fellows should look after the weak, the active must look after <b>the</b> <b>lazy,</b> the merry must cheer up the dull, the sharp must lend a helping hand to the duffer.
