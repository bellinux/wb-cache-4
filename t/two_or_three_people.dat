5|$|In the 1880s, Edward was {{a regular}} habitué of Parisian brothels, most notably Le Chabanais, which was {{regarded}} as the top establishment in Paris where brothels were legal. One room contained a custom made bath which was sometimes filled with champagne; and a specially designed and crafted siège d'amour (love seat) that allowed easy access for oral {{and other forms of}} sex for <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>people.</b> It is now a museum piece.|$|E
25|$|Representative Jane Harman, a California Democrat and Chairman of the House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Intelligence, Information Sharing, and Terrorism Risk Assessment, said Pakistani {{officials}} arrested “alleged facilitators” {{as part of}} a “far broader investigation.” Pakistani authorities arrested {{more than}} a dozen suspects in the investigation of the attempted car bombing, including <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>people</b> at a house in Karachi's Nazimabad district where Shahzad is said to have stayed.|$|E
25|$|Initially, the Mark C was {{available}} only as either the Standard Tourer or the Deluxe Tourer {{with a single}} bench seat, seating <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>people.</b> The Deluxe version included an electric starter along with rear bumpers. The range was expanded in March 1954, when the Standard Family Safety and Deluxe Family Safety versions were added. On these models the bodywork was extended behind the front seat and, like the earlier Bond Family Safety Saloon, two child-size inward facing hammock-style seats were added in the gap. Factory advertising material resurrected the Safety label {{as part of this}} model's name, but it was generally dropped elsewhere.|$|E

25|$|Until his death, Borel {{attended}} the lycée professionnel Georges-Cisson in Toulon, {{where he studied}} electromechanics and did quite well academically. He {{was said to be}} a disciplined and quiet student. However, in his last year at school there was a radical change in behavior. He skipped classes without permission or explanation and became unaffable. He regularly said that he could not bear it anymore at home, that he had had enough of doing housework and being called names, and often stated his wish to join the military, like his father and grandfather. Apparently, the week prior to the shooting, he also told one of his classmates that he would commit suicide, but not before killing <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>people.</b>|$|E
25|$|It was at Southern, in {{the same}} year he joined the station, that Hargreaves made his screen debut with the series Gone Fishing – and so, what had {{previously}} been a pastime became the focus of his wider reputation. He recounted how on his first broadcast, sitting in the studio, apprehensive at the thought of being about to talk live to a potential audience of millions, his director had reminded him that although that vast audience might be statistically daunting, it was more likely to be <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>people</b> and perhaps a dog sitting in their front room. He aimed at conversing with such an audience {{for the rest of his}} career. The director of nearly all of Hargreaves' programmes at Southern Television was George Egan who, with cameraman Stan Bréhaut, became the third ingredient of a most creative outdoor team.|$|E
25|$|While many {{witnesses}} {{said that the}} Fanchers were in general a peaceful party whose members behaved well along the trail, rumors spread about aggressive and threatening behavior and other misdeeds. Brevet Major James Henry Carleton led the first federal investigation of the murders, published in 1859. He recorded Hamblin's account that the train was alleged to have poisoned a spring near Corn Creek; this resulted {{in the deaths of}} 18 head of cattle and <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>people</b> who ate the contaminated meat. Carleton interviewed the father of a child who allegedly died from this poisoned spring, and accepted the sincerity of the grieving father. But, he also included a statement from an investigator who did not believe the Fancher party was capable of poisoning the spring, given its size. Carleton invited readers to consider a potential explanation for the rumors of misdeeds, noting the general atmosphere of distrust among Mormons for strangers at the time, and that some locals appeared jealous of the Fancher party's wealth.|$|E

50|$|Before 1871, {{the number}} of {{immigrants}} rarely exceeded <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> thousand <b>people</b> a year. Immigration increased pressure from the first end of the international slave trade to Brazil, after {{the expansion of the}} economy, especially in the period of large coffee plantations in the state of São Paulo.|$|R
500|$|Meerkat Manor {{normally}} films episodes using {{a crew of}} only <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>people</b> {{to avoid}} disturbing the meerkats; the film was shot over two years at the Kuruman River Reserve, where the Kalahari Meerkat Project that the meerkats {{are a part of}} is based, and employed a much larger crew. Breaking from the series' pure documentary format, the film does not include footage of the project meerkats depicted in the story. Instead, wild meerkat [...] "actors" [...] represented Flower and her family; Flower was depicted by approximately eight female meerkats. The camera crew sought out appropriately aged meerkats for each scene, then filmed them until they behaved in ways the script required.|$|E
500|$|A {{tropical}} depression formed on October29 near Pohnpei. It {{moved to the}} northeast initially, but on October31 began tracking to the west. On November3, the system passed just south of Guam as a typhoon, where a pressure of [...] was recorded. Winds reached over 200km/h (125mph), {{and there was a}} slight decrease during the passage of the eyewall. The typhoon turned to the northwest, passing near the Bonin Islands. On November8, the typhoon accelerated to the northeast, crossing the International Date Line on November10. When the storm struck Guam, it damaged nearly every building on the island. Most of the damage occurred after the center of the storm passed and the onslaught of easterly winds began. The storm also damaged the Pan American tourist hotel and a hangar. Downed trees killed <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>people,</b> and five people in total died on the island, the others likely due to drowning. After the storm, Naval Governor George McMillin sought aid from the American Red Cross to assist residents in rebuilding. It was considered among the worst typhoons on record in Guam.|$|E
500|$|The use of fake weapons {{generated}} controversy. After {{the concert}} in Colorado, Madonna was criticised {{over the use}} of fake weapons, since the public was sensitized by the 2012 Aurora shooting, which occurred at the premiere of The Dark Knight Rises. Peter Burns, a radio broadcaster in the region, told The Hollywood Reporter that [...] "You could see people kinda looking at each other. I heard the word 'Colorado', you know, 'Aurora', 'shooting'. You could hear people talking about it, and it was little bit unsettling. I saw <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>people</b> get up and grab their stuff and actually leave their seats". Ray Mark Rinaldi from Reverb website said that Madonna was [...] "dancing with guns and shooting up bad guys during 'Revolver'. It was a bloody scene, particularly tasteless in Colorado these days, but all cartoon; if folks got upset, they were supposed to". Daniel Brokman from The Phoenix said: [...] "Madonna took the capacity crowd into a dark place that few were expecting minutes earlier from this queen of '80s pop music". In a review of the concert, Ross Raihala from Twin Cities mentioned that there was [...] "darkness hung over much {{of the first half of}} the show" [...] because of the performances of [...] "Revolver" [...] and [...] "Gang Bang." ...|$|E
50|$|The annual {{inspection}} of the battalion was a major social event: <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> thousand <b>people</b> attended the 1869 parade, when the Huddersfield Rifles, Holmfirth Volunteers, and Mirfield and Meltham Companies were inspected, and the Saddleworth Volunteers 'kept the ground' with the police. Later, the Huddersfield Rifles had a prizewinning brass band.|$|R

60|$|In {{the course}} of <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> days, <b>people</b> ceased to take {{interest}} in a feud so coldly conducted; and if they thought of it at all, it was but to wonder that both the parties should persevere in residing near the Spa, and in chilling, with their unsocial behaviour, a party met together {{for the purposes of}} health and amusement.|$|R
500|$|The [...] "Cover the Night" [...] event {{took place}} {{worldwide}} on April 20, 2012 and {{was to be}} conducted by supporters who were encouraged to perform some sort of charity work that morning in their local community. Then, that evening, they were to post flyers and posters throughout their city for the Kony 2012 campaign. The turnout for the event worldwide was much smaller than initially expected, with no organized spots officially announced and much fewer people attending than had pledged to attend. A tweet from Invisible Children stated, [...] "There is no official meet-up as we are asking people to act locally with friends+family [...] in their neighborhoods." [...] One gathering in Vancouver had only 17 people; another in Brisbane had fewer than 50 attendees. In Kelowna, British Columbia several signs and posters were put up, including two large banners that were [...] "placed {{on both sides of}} the pedestrian overpass". In Canberra, several Facebook groups resulted in a few gatherings of <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>people</b> each; Pierre Johannessen, a [...] "law firm partner who runs a charity for disadvantaged children", distributed around 3,000 posters to the groups to be put up throughout the city. In Phoenix, 200 posters were put up by [...] "college students and other people in their teens and 20s", along with a number of chalk and stencil messages.|$|E

2500|$|Like most of {{his fellow}} inmates, Fujita was {{returned}} to the United States {{over a period of}} several weeks in late 1945. Fujita travelled via train to Texas, and via bus to Abilene, arriving in October. He recorded later that [...] "I walked past my mother and baby sister without recognizing them.

2500|$|In 1966, Wilson {{elaborated}} {{that his}} writing process involved {{going to the}} piano and finding [...] "feels," [...] which he described as [...] "brief note sequences, fragments of ideas," [...] and that [...] "once they're {{out of my head}} and into the open air, I can see them and touch them firmly. They're not 'feels' anymore." [...] Mike Love remembered: [...] "Brian is so spontaneous that if there's a piano and <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>people</b> around to sing parts, he’ll sit down and write a song in five minutes. But if you don’t get it right then, he goes off and drops it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Thirty-eight {{witnesses}} — {{that was}} the story {{that came from the}} police. And it really is what made the story stick. Over the course of many months of research, I wound up finding a document that was a collection of the first interviews. Oddly enough, there were 49 witnesses. I was puzzled by that until I added up the entries themselves. Some of them were interviews with <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>people</b> [...] lived in the same apartment. I believe that some harried civil servant gave that number to the police commissioner who gave it to Rosenthal, and it entered the modern history of America after that.|$|E

2500|$|The group then {{entered an}} {{apartment}} building on 61 Jabotinsky Street planning to abduct <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>people</b> and take them back to Lebanon. One of the PFLP men, Abdel Majeed Asslan, broke into the apartment of Charles Shapiro, 34, a recent immigrant from South Africa, after the doors to his apartment had been shot up. Shapiro, who was armed with a [...]22 caliber magnum revolver, shot Asslan dead. Next, Kuntar's group encountered Moshe Sasson, a resident {{who was trying to}} reach the building's bomb shelter carrying his two young daughters, one under each arm. Kuntar shoved Sasson and slammed a handgun into the back of his skull. However, Sasson escaped when the hall lights suddenly went out, and hid under a parked car.|$|E
2500|$|Eight retired {{generals and}} admirals called for Rumsfeld to resign in early 2006 {{in what was}} called the [...] "Generals Revolt", accusing him of [...] "abysmal" [...] {{military}} planning and lack of strategic competence. Commentator Pat Buchanan reported at the time that Washington Post columnist David Ignatius, who traveled often to Iraq and supported the war, said the generals [...] "mirror the views of 75 percent of the officers in the field, and probably more". Rumsfeld rebuffed these criticisms, stating that [...] "out of thousands and thousands of admirals and generals, if every time <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>people</b> disagreed we changed the secretary of defense of the United States, it would be like a merry-go-round." [...] Bush defended his secretary throughout, and responded by stating that Rumsfeld is [...] "exactly what is needed".|$|E
2500|$|With {{very few}} {{exceptions}} aircraft of the pioneer era were relatively small designs {{powered by a}} single engine and designed to carry at most <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>people.</b> [...] Early multiple-engine designs were produced by the Short Brothers, who constructed a number of variants of their Farman-type Improved S.27 design. However the intention of using a pair of engines in these aircraft was to safeguard against engine failure rather than to permit a larger machine, and even a large aircraft such as the Voisin Aero-Yacht, intended to carry six people and with a wingspan of 22.5m (73ft 10in), was powered by a single engine. [...] The first large multi-engined aircraft was [...] Igor Sikorsky's Bolshoi Baltisky, first flown in May 1913 with two engines and later equipped with four.|$|E
