5000|$|A knot is {{a method}} of {{fastening}} or securing linear material such as string by tying or interweaving. It may consist of a length of one or several segments of string, <b>twine,</b> <b>cord,</b> strap, rope, or even chain interwoven such that the line can bind to itself or to some other object (the [...] "load").|$|E

Each purple stripe has 5 picks, with 4 picks of yellow between. At the opposite end there is a tiny section of purple dovetail tapestry clinging to three warps.; Somewhat dirty and worn. There are several small interior holes and large edge tears. The twining yarn has almost separated from the fragment. There is some wear from abrasion...|$|R

60|$|Next day Jarwin {{rose with}} the sun, {{and began to}} make twine of twisted cocoanut fibre--of which there was great {{abundance}} to be had everywhere. When a sufficient quantity had been made he plaited the <b>twine</b> into <b>cords,</b> and the cords into stout ropes, which, although not so neat as regular ropes, were, nevertheless, sufficiently pliable and very strong. Several days were spent over this somewhat tedious process; and we may mention here, that in all these operations the busy seaman was greatly assisted by his dog, who stuck close to him all the time, encouraging him with looks and wags of approbation.|$|R
5000|$|The Salish had an {{abundant}} supply of cedar bark, or SLAH {{and used it}} for many things including clothing. The softer inner bark was used for weaving. It was made softer and pliable by boiling for periods of up to two days. They would then work the strips by bending, twisting and rubbing between their hands which were covered with protective buckskin gloves. Once it was prepared, strips were taken off to use for plaiting or open-work basket weaving. When used for clothing, the bark was first pounded into shreds then combed into small separate fibers. Then it was spun into a fine <b>twine,</b> or <b>cord</b> as required[...]|$|R

50|$|A rationally {{constructed}} word-list would discard many synonyms or near-synonyms, {{of which}} the Anglo-American language is full. For example, little - small, big - large, begin - commence. It need not tolerate functional overlap as with band - ribbon - strip. Also, it would avoid over-specialization by making one word do what in natural languages is often done by three or more. For example, the French call the outer cover {{of the human body}} la peau, that of the onion la pelure, and that of the sausage la cotte. Though less precise than the French, we ourselves overburden the dictionary with the corresponding series skin - rind - jacket - peel. When we distinguish between thread - <b>twine</b> - <b>cord</b> - string - rope - tow we are merely heaping name upon name for what is ultimately a difference in size.|$|R
40|$|Ply-split {{braiding}} is a textile-making {{technique that}} involves separating the plies of one cord with a latch hook or similar tool, catching a second cord and pulling {{it through the}} gap between the plies of the first. The technique has been most fully developed by the men of the Thar Desert of Rajasthan, who use ply-split braiding, generally of 4 -ply cords of goat hair or cotton, to make girths and other paraphernalia for their camels (Harvey 1976; Quick and Stein 1982). Peter Collingwood (1998) provided the fullest description of traditional textiles made by ply-split braiding and of the techniques used to make them. In the decade following the publication of his book, fiber artists in several countries – including Collingwood himself – explored the use of ply-split braiding for novel creations, many of which were three-dimensional, in contrast with the one- and two-dimensional straps and braids more typical of traditional work in Rajasthan. Ply-split braiding has been usefully divided into three structural types, depending on the sequence and placement of cord splittings. In plain oblique <b>twining</b> (POT) each <b>cord</b> alternately splits and is split by cords that it meets along its path. In single-course oblique <b>twining</b> (SCOT) a <b>cord</b> may split or be split by several cords consecutively. In both POT and SCOT a cord typically has plie...|$|R
5000|$|The single-strand stopper knot is...variety of knob knots. Generally it is tied as a {{terminal}} knot {{in the end}} of a rope, where it forms a knob or bunch, the general purpose of which is to prevent unreeving. It is found in the ends of running rigging. It secures the end of a sewing thread; it provides a handhold or a foothold in bell ropes and footropes. It adds weight {{to the end of a}} heaving line, and it is often employed decoratively, but it should not be used to prevent unlaying and fraying except in small <b>cord,</b> <b>twine,</b> and the like, as a whippingis in every way preferable for large and valuable material.

6000|$|Pedro {{shook his}} head sadly, and the {{expression}} of the old man became grave. The question referred to Pedro's search for his lost child. It had long been the first inquiry when these two met after a separation. The old man seemed never to lose hope, but he had become so accustomed to the reply that his despondency was now of short duration. He had known and loved the child in days gone by--had helped the mother in cultivating her garden-plot, and had gone out hunting with the father many a time. He was a fine-looking man, above seventy years of age, with iron-grey hair, turning in some places to pure white. The hunter's spare though still upright figure showed that he must have been a powerful man in his youth, and the deeply-marked wrinkles about his mouth and eyes told eloquently that he was a kind one. Round his shoulders were <b>twined</b> the <b>cords</b> of the heavy [...] "bolas," [...] or balls, with which he sometimes felled, at other times entangled, his prey. These balls were covered with clotted blood. He carried a short gun in his hand, and a large knife was stuck in his belt.|$|R

We found many huts, and Indians fishing for pearls, and also a fair house, with porches; but no Spaniard therein, save one man; at which Mr. Oxenham was like a man transported, and fell on that Spaniard, crying, 'Perro, where is your {{mistress}}? Where is the bark from Lima?' To which he boldly enough, 'What was his mistress to the Englishman?' But Mr. O. threatened to <b>twine</b> a <b>cord</b> round his head till his eyes burst out; and the Spaniard, being terrified, said that the ship from Lima was expected in a fortnight's time. So for ten days we lay quiet, letting neither negro nor Spaniard leave the island, and took good store of pearls, feeding sumptuously on wild cattle and hogs until the tenth day, when there came by a small bark; her we took, and found her from Quito, and on board 60,000 pezos of gold and other store. With which if we had been content, gentlemen, all had gone well. And some were willing to go back at once, having both treasure and pearls in plenty; but Mr. O., he waxed right mad, and swore to slay any one who made that motion again, assuring us that the Lima ship of which he had news was far greater and richer, and would make princes of us all; which bark came in sight on the sixteenth day, and was taken without shot or slaughter. The taking of which bark, I verily believe, was the ruin of every mother's son of us." ...|$|R
60|$|One morning, as I was {{preparing}} and arranging specimens, I was told {{there was to}} be a trial; and presently four or five men came in and squatted down on a mat under the audience-shed in the court. The chief then came in with his clerk, and sat down opposite them. Each spoke in turn, telling his own tale, and then I found that those who first entered were the prisoner, accuser, policemen, and witness, and that the prisoner was indicated solely by having a loose piece of <b>cord</b> <b>twined</b> around his wrists, but not tied. It was a case of robbery, and after the evidence was given, and a few questions had been asked by the chief, the accused said a few words, and then sentence was pronounced, which was a fine. The parties then got up and walked away together, seeming quite friendly; and throughout {{there was nothing in the}} manner of any one present indicating passion or ill-feeling--a very good illustration of the Malayan type of character.|$|R
