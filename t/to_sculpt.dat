5|$|While {{most other}} museums were using cast or sculpted Camarasaurus skulls on Apatosaurus mounts, the Yale Peabody Museum decided <b>to</b> <b>sculpt</b> a skull {{based on the}} lower jaw of a Camarasaurus, with the cranium based on Marsh's 1891 {{illustration}} of the skull. The skull also included forward-pointing nasalssomething different to any dinosaurand fenestrae differing from both the drawing and other skulls.|$|E
5|$|From facial {{measurements}} and still {{photographs of the}} human templates, sculpting supervisor John Brown constructed Cliff Richard, while Brian Bennett was entrusted to Christine Glanville, Hank Marvin to Terry Curtis, John Rostill to Mary Turner and Bruce Welch to Tim Cooksey. Curtis went on <b>to</b> <b>sculpt</b> Zero-X crewmembers Captain Paul Travers and Co-Pilot Greg Martin, modelling the first on 1960s James Bond actor, Sean Connery and the latter partly on himself, {{in addition to the}} Glenn Field Controller, Commander Casey.|$|E

5|$|In 1937, Stackpole {{received}} a commission <b>to</b> <b>sculpt</b> {{his interpretation of}} Colorado River explorer John Wesley Powell, for display in the Main Interior Building of the U.S. Department of Interior. It {{was to be a}} companion piece to Heinz Warneke's portrayal of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Warneke learned that Stackpole intended a water scene, so he changed his portrayal of Lewis and Clark {{to be one of them}} on land. Stackpole and Warneke delivered their stone reliefs in 1940, and the two panels were mounted on either side of the stage of the building's auditorium.|$|E
5|$|Millett taught English at the University of North Carolina {{after graduating}} from Oxford University, but she left mid-semester to study art. In New York City {{she worked as a}} {{kindergarten}} teacher and learned <b>to</b> <b>sculpt</b> and paint from 1959 to 1961. She then moved to Japan and studied sculpture. Millett met fellow sculptor Fumio Yoshimura, had her first one-woman show at Tokyo's Minami Gallery, and taught English at Waseda University. She left Japan in 1963 and moved to New York's Lower East Side.|$|E
5|$|Early Heian period works {{before the}} mid-10th century appear heavy {{compared}} to Nara period statues, carved from single blocks of wood, and characterised by draperies carved with alternating round and sharply cut folds. Stylistically, they followed high to later Tang style. In the Heian period the zōbussho were replaced with temple-run and independent workshops; wood became the primary medium; and a specific Japanese style emerged. By the mid-10th century, the style was refined presenting a more calm and gentle appearance, with attenuated proportions. Jōchō {{was the most}} important sculptor of this time, and he used the yosegi technique, in which several pieces of wood are joined <b>to</b> <b>sculpt</b> a single figure. He was the ancestor of three important schools of Japanese Buddhist statuary: the , Inpa and Keiha school. The Amida Nyorai at Byōdō-in is the only extant work by Jōchō.|$|E

5|$|Helena and Christian {{were devoted}} to each other, and led a quiet life in {{comparison}} to Helena's sisters. Following their marriage, they took up residence at Cumberland Lodge in Windsor Great Park, the traditional residence of the Ranger of Windsor Great Park, the honorary position bestowed on Christian by the Queen. When staying in London, they lived at the Belgian Suite in Buckingham Palace. The couple had six children: Christian Victor in 1867, Albert in 1869, and Princesses Helena Victoria and Marie Louise in 1870 and 1872 respectively. Their last two sons died early; Harald died eight days after his birth in 1876, and an unnamed son was stillborn in 1877. Princess Louise, Helena's sister, commissioned the French sculptor Jules Dalou <b>to</b> <b>sculpt</b> a memorial to Helena's dead infants.|$|E
5|$|This {{was how he}} {{personally}} designed many of the Sagrada Família's sculptures. He would thoroughly study the anatomy of the figure, concentrating on gestures. For this purpose, he studied the human skeleton and sometimes used dummies made of wire to test the appropriate posture of the figure he was about <b>to</b> <b>sculpt.</b> In a second step, he photographed his models, using a mirror system that provided multiple perspectives. He then made plaster casts of the figures, both of people and animals (on one occasion he made a donkey stand up so it would not move). He modified the proportions of these casts to obtain the figure's desired appearance, depending on {{its place in the}} church (the higher up, the bigger it would be). Eventually, he sculpted the figures in stone.|$|E
5|$|A crew of over 200 craftspeople and {{technicians}} constructed the three principal sets: {{the surface of}} the alien planetoid, and the interiors of the Nostromo and the derelict spacecraft. Art Director Les Dilley created -scale miniatures of the planetoid's surface and derelict spacecraft based on Giger's designs, then made moulds and casts and scaled them up as diagrams for the wood and fiberglass forms of the sets. Tons of sand, plaster, fiberglass, rock, and gravel were shipped into the studio <b>to</b> <b>sculpt</b> a desert landscape for the planetoid's surface, which the actors would walk across wearing space suit costumes. The suits themselves were thick, bulky, and lined with nylon, had no cooling systems and, initially, no venting for their exhaled carbon dioxide to escape. Combined with a heat wave, these conditions nearly caused the actors to pass out: nurses had to be kept on-hand with oxygen tanks.|$|E

5|$|Early Philippine {{sculpture}} {{is characterized}} by frontal nudity. One of the earliest forms are the bulols by the Ifugao people which serve as an assurance for bountiful harvests. The original function of these sculptures {{are related to the}} ceremonies and beliefs of the tribes who created them. Arab and Russian missionaries also brought beveled type of carvings in the form of Okkil. The beginnings of this sculpture type started with the Islamization of Sulu. The Spanish colonization of the country did not hinder Filipinos creating sculptures for objects of adoration. During this time, sculptures of deities and saints were used to teach Filipinos Christian doctrines. During the American colonialism, worshippers of faith were not discouraged <b>to</b> <b>sculpt</b> in order to adorn churches. Filipinos' first exposure to painting happened when Spain conquered the Philippines and these were used as religious propaganda often displayed in churches. However, as education progressed and wealth increased, more and more artists started to shift from the traditional religious motifs to a more secular pattern of imagery.|$|E
5|$|For the game's {{character}} sculpting and rigging, {{the team}} introduced various new elements {{that were not}} used in their previous games. Lead character technical director Judd Simantov found {{that the creation of}} the faces was the most challenging, in terms of hardware. For the faces, the team used joint-based facial rigs, with some blend-shape correctives. To reta{{in the shape of the}} face and avoid awkward movement, the faces were rigged with the mouth open and eyes slightly closed. The faces were also based on the Facial Action Coding System, allowing for an anatomical-based approach. The use of a higher mesh density also allowed more volumes and creasing in the shape of the face, creating cleaner silhouettes and shapes and giving enough geometry <b>to</b> <b>sculpt</b> correctives. In an attempt to add subtle features, pupil dilation was added to the character models. For the bodies, the team edited the character movements from Uncharted 2, softening some joint alignment. The animation of carpal joints was also added for the game, allowing more dynamic hand shapes, and flexibility. Another subtle addition was the arm mover controls, allowing minor editing on the arms; though this feature was previously available, it was opened up to the animators for The Last of Us. A muscle system was also added, adding muscle shells that bulge, based on attachment joint distance; the muscle system, written in Maya within a few days, works in real time. To solve an issue in which body movement resulted in awkward movement of clothing, runtime helpers were implemented. A total of 326 joints were used in the full character model, with 98 of these in the face; 85 of these are runtime driven, while 241 are locked into animation.|$|E

5000|$|Kornél Sámuel [...] (1883 in Szilágykövesd - 1914 in Uzsok) was a Hungarian {{sculptor}} {{noted for}} his delicate rhythm and lyrical approach <b>to</b> <b>sculpting.</b> He {{died at the}} beginning of World War I and was the first victim from the arts in World War I from Hungary.|$|R
50|$|Daitetsu Hibiki is Jin's {{friend and}} a member of the art club. He seems to be talented at {{everything}} from singing <b>to</b> <b>sculpting</b> and Jin hopes to one day be as good as him. Despite his imposing figure, he can be sensitive and has a surprising love for cats.|$|R
25|$|Parallel <b>to</b> <b>sculpting</b> {{he started}} <b>to</b> paint fine {{aquarelles}} and creating more ceramics. His terracotta series Silk Road contains 32 figures which are representing a {{step by step}} change in the composition starting from the typical Orient flame shape to the well known traditional European presentation forms of man, animal, bird and flower. This series is an example how <b>to</b> connect the <b>sculpting</b> styles of Orient and Occident gradually using the stylistic element along the Silk Road.|$|R

25|$|Most of the sculptors {{were given}} a sketch drawn by Pope Clement's {{favorite}} painter, Carlo Maratta, {{to which they were}} to adhere, but with the notable exception being Pierre Le Gros the Younger, who successfully refused <b>to</b> <b>sculpt</b> to Maratta's design and consequently was not given a sketch.|$|E
50|$|By the 1970s {{manufacturers}} {{had begun}} to develop techniques to move from plain tufted carpet <b>to</b> <b>sculpted</b> carpet. Improved patterning, stain and wear resistance, and colors have made today's tufted carpet the choice for functional carpet {{for the vast majority}} of homes, and moved woven carpet to a decorative role.|$|R
50|$|In {{the next}} couple of years he {{successfully}} participated in numerous exhibitions (Lyon, Bern...), but soon found painting to be less and less fulfilling until eventually he had some sort of crisis and completely abandoned painting (he'll come back to it in later years) so he could dedicate himself <b>to</b> <b>sculpting.</b>|$|R
50|$|Switzer {{graduated}} from Ontario College of Art in 1972, majoring in Sculpture. Switzer works in bronze although his repertoire also includes works in other materials including wood.

25|$|After {{opening a}} New York studio, Brooks sculpted many {{portrait}} busts in 1883 to 1886. Finally financially {{able to purchase}} marble, she used that material <b>to</b> <b>sculpt</b> subjects including Thomas Carlyle, George Eliot, James A. Garfield, Lucretia Mott, Emanuel Swedenborg, Thurlow Weed, and a group sculptural portrait of Alicia Vanderbilt La Bau (daughter of Cornelius Vanderbilt) with her four children.|$|E
25|$|The {{sandstone}} used <b>to</b> <b>sculpt</b> {{the monuments}} is old red sandstone, a relatively soft stone that {{lends itself to}} detailed carving but is susceptible to erosion. The monuments {{are likely to have}} been worked with iron tools such as chisels, punches and hammers, together with hammerstones and wooden mallets. The sculpted designs may have been copied from painted vellum pattern books.|$|E
25|$|In 1781, Girolamo Zulian – the Venetian {{ambassador}} to Rome – hired Canova <b>to</b> <b>sculpt</b> Theseus and the Minotaur. The statue depicts the victorious Theseus {{seated on the}} lifeless body of a Minotaur.
