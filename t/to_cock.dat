5|$|To {{initiate}} {{firing the}} weapon the trigger mechanism, which was essentially just a large spring, {{had to be}} cocked, and to do this was a difficult and awkward process. The user had to first place the PIAT on its butt, then place two feet on the shoulder padding and turn the weapon to unlock the body and simultaneously lock the firing pin to the butt; the user would then have to bend over and pull {{the body of the}} weapon upwards, thereby pulling the spring back until it attached to the trigger and cocking the weapon. Once this was achieved, the body was then lowered and turned to reattach it {{to the rest of the}} weapon, and the PIAT could then be fired. Users of a small stature often found the cocking sequence challenging, as they did not have the sufficient height required to pull the body up far enough <b>to</b> <b>cock</b> the weapon; it was also difficult to do when lying in a prone position, as was often the case when using the weapon in action.|$|E
25|$|The Astra 400 {{is heavy}} {{compared}} to many contemporary service pistols {{of the time}} like the Tokarev TT-33 but is similar in weight and length to the Colt 1911. The Astra 400 {{was designed to be}} safe to fire with a simple blowback action unaided by any breech-locking devices. This is only possible with a heavy slide and strong recoil spring. It was fitted with an internal hammer which was considered very hard <b>to</b> <b>cock.</b> The pistol also featured grooved finger grips and left sided combined slide lock/safety behind the trigger guard. The original design was chambered in 9mm Largo, but later variants would be chambered differently so as to better fulfill different military needs.|$|E
500|$|Public {{interest}} in the story grew when {{it was discovered that}} the ghost appeared to follow Elizabeth Parsons. [...] She was removed to the house of a Mr Bray, where on 14January, in the presence of two unidentified nobles, more knocking sounds were heard. [...] A few days later she was returned <b>to</b> <b>Cock</b> Lane, where on 18January another séance was held. [...] In attendance were Kent, the apothecary, and local parish priest and incumbent of St John Clerkenwell, Stephen Aldrich. [...] On that occasion, when a clergyman used a candle to look under the bed, the ghost [...] "refused" [...] to answer, Frazer claiming [...] "she [...] loving not light". [...] After a few minutes of silence the questioning continued, but when Moore asked if the ghost would appear in court against Kent, Frazer refused to ask the question.|$|E

500|$|After {{reading the}} veiled accusations made {{against him in}} the Public Ledger, Kent {{determined}} to clear his name, and accompanied by a witness went to see John Moore. [...] The Methodist showed Kent the list of questions he and Parsons had drawn up for the ghost to answer. [...] One concerned William and Fanny's marital status, prompting Kent {{to admit that they}} never married. [...] Moore told him he did not think he was a murderer, rather, he believed the spirit's presence indicated that [...] "there was something behind darker than all the rest, and that if he would go to Parson's house, he might be a witness to the same and convinced of its reality". [...] On 12January therefore, Kent enlisted the aid of the two physicians who attended Fanny in her last days, and with Broughton, went <b>to</b> <b>Cock</b> Lane. [...] On the house's upper floor Elizabeth Parsons was publicly undressed, and with her younger sister was put to bed. [...] The audience sat around the bed, positioned in the centre of the room. [...] They were warned that the ghost was sensitive to disbelief and told that they should accord it due respect. [...] When the séance began, a relative of Parsons, Mary Frazer, ran around the room shouting [...] "Fanny, Fanny, why don't you come? [...] Do come, pray Fanny, come; dear Fanny, come!" [...] When nothing happened, Moore told the group the ghost would not come as they were making too much noise. [...] He asked them to leave the room, telling them he would try to contact the ghost by stamping his foot. [...] About ten minutes later they were told the ghost had returned and that they should re-enter the room. [...] Moore then started to run through his and Parsons' list of questions: ...|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "double action" [...] firearm designs, {{the trigger}} {{is also used}} <b>to</b> <b>cock</b> the firearm — {{and there are many}} designs where the trigger is used for a range of other functions. Although {{triggers}} usually consist of a lever actuated by the index finger, some such as the M2 Browning machine gun use the thumb, and others like the Springfield Armory M6 Scout use a [...] "squeeze-bar trigger." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the second}} sense, [...] "automatic revolver" [...] {{refers to the}} {{mechanism}} of firing rather than extraction. Double-action revolvers use a long trigger pull <b>to</b> <b>cock</b> the hammer, thus negating the need to manually cock the hammer between shots. The disadvantage {{of this is that}} the long, heavy pull cocking the hammer makes the double-action revolver much harder to shoot accurately than a single-action revolver (although cocking the hammer of a double-action reduces the length and weight of the trigger pull). A rare class of revolvers, called automatic for its firing design, attempts to overcome this restriction, giving the high speed of a double-action with the trigger effort of a single-action. The Webley-Fosbery Automatic Revolver is the most famous commercial example. It was recoil-operated, and the cylinder and barrel recoiled backwards <b>to</b> <b>cock</b> the hammer and revolve the cylinder. Cam grooves were milled {{on the outside of the}} cylinder to provide a means of advancing to the next chamber—half a turn as the cylinder moved back, and half a turn as it moved forward[...]38 caliber versions held eight shots, [...]455 caliber versions six. At the time, the few available automatic pistols were larger, less reliable, and more expensive. The automatic revolver was popular when it first came out, but was quickly superseded by the creation of reliable, inexpensive semi-automatic pistols.|$|E

2500|$|In a {{traditional}} double-action mechanism, the trigger mechanism has features that both allow the trigger <b>to</b> <b>cock</b> and release the hammer/striker when fully pulled, or to merely lock the hammer/striker in the cocked position {{when it is}} pulled to the rear and the trigger is not depressed. In a revolver, this means that simply squeezing the trigger when the hammer is lowered will both cock and release it. If the user uses their thumb to pull the hammer to the back, but doesn't press the trigger, the mechanism will lock the hammer in the cocked position until the trigger is pressed, just like a single action. Firing in double action mode gives greater rapidity of fire, but a longer, [...] heavier trigger pull, which can limit accuracy compared to the lighter, shorter trigger pull of a single-action only handgun.|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "single-action" [...] wasn't in use until weapons with {{double-action}} triggers were invented, which didn't occur {{until the}} mid-19th century; before that, all triggers were single-action (for example, all matchlocks, flintlocks, muskets, etc.). While originally all hammers required a separate hand motion <b>to</b> <b>cock</b> manually, {{with the birth}} of repeating rifles such as the Henry rifle, it was found to be easy to design the cocking of the hammer into the cycling of the action, which is still found in most modern repeating weapons, and some single-shots as well. Although these weapons don't require the user to physically cock the hammer, they are still single-actions because the cocking is not performed by the trigger mechanism. Manually-cocked triggers lasted much longer on revolvers; due to the limited size and weight of handguns, it was difficult to fit the necessary mechanisms in place, and most repeating rifles required the use of two hands to cycle the action. Thus the [...] "classic" [...] single-action revolver of the mid-to-late 19th century includes black-powder percussion-cap muzzleloaders such as the Colt 1860 [...] "Army" [...] Model, and Colt 1851 [...] "Navy" [...] Model, and European models like the LeMat, as well as early metallic-cartridge black-powder revolvers such as the Colt Model 1873 [...] "Single Action Army" [...] (named for its trigger mechanism) and Smith & Wesson Model 3, all of which required a thumb <b>to</b> <b>cock</b> the hammer before firing. Manually cocked hammers lasted a while longer in some break-action shotguns, and in dangerous game rifles, where the hunter didn't want to rely on an unnecessarily complex or fragile weapon. While single-action revolvers never lost favor in the US right up until the birth of the semi-automatic pistol, double action revolvers, such as the Beaumont–Adams, were designed in Europe before the American Civil War broke out, and saw great popularity all through {{the latter half of the}} 19th century, with certain numbers being sold in the US as well.|$|E
2500|$|In a single-action revolver, {{the hammer}} is {{manually}} cocked, usually with the thumb of the firing or supporting hand. This action advances the cylinder {{to the next}} round and locks the cylinder in place with the chamber aligned with the barrel. The trigger, when pulled, releases the hammer, which fires the round in the chamber. To fire again, the hammer must be manually cocked again. This is called [...] "single-action" [...] because the trigger only performs a single action, of releasing the hammer. Because only a single action is performed and trigger pull is lightened, firing a revolver in this way allows most shooters to achieve greater accuracy. Additionally, the need <b>to</b> <b>cock</b> the hammer manually acts as a safety. The Colt Paterson Revolver, the Walker Colt, the Colt's Dragoon and the Colt Single Action Army pistol of the American Frontier era are all good examples of this system.|$|E

50|$|There {{were several}} {{modifications}} of this pistol during its production until 1897. In some, the barrel catch does not operate during firing movement, {{so that the}} pistol closes to become fully self-loading. In no models, however, does the automatic action extend <b>to</b> <b>cocking</b> the self-loading pistol. In all variations the hammer must be <b>cocked</b> by thumb <b>to</b> fire or must be cocked and dropped in double action mechanical fashion by a pull on the trigger.|$|R
2500|$|Like {{the newer}} term [...] "WASP," [...] the old term [...] "Anglo-Saxon" [...] was used derisively by writers hostile to an {{informal}} alliance between Britain and the U.S. The negative use was especially common among Irish Americans and writers in France.

Irish-American humorist Finley Peter Dunne popularized the ridicule of [...] "Anglo Saxon", even calling President Theodore Roosevelt one. Roosevelt insisted he was Dutch. [...] "To be genuinely Irish is to challenge WASP dominance," [...] argues California politician Tom Hayden.
