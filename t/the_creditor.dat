5|$|Due to the Panic of 1819, many {{citizens}} in Kentucky fell deep into debt and began petitioning the legislature for help. The state's politicians {{split into two}} factions. Those who advocated for measures that were more favorable to debtors were dubbed the Relief faction while those who insisted on sound money principles and the strict adherence to the obligation of contracts were called the Anti-Relief faction. In 1820, a pro-relief measure passed the General Assembly providing debtors a one-year stay on the collection of their debts if <b>the</b> <b>creditor</b> would accept payment in devalued notes issued by the Bank of the Commonwealth or a two-year stay if <b>the</b> <b>creditor</b> demanded payment in sound money. Two separate circuit courts found the law unconstitutional {{in the cases of}} Williams v. Blair and Lapsley v. Brashear.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, the Argentine austral {{replaced}} the discredited peso. In 1986, Argentina {{failed to pay}} the debt for several months, and the debt was renegotiated with <b>the</b> <b>creditor</b> banks. In 1986 and 1987, the Austral Plan faded away, as ﬁscal policy was undermined by large off-budget spending and a loose monetary policy, again falling out of compliance with an IMF programme. A new IMF arrangement was reached in July 1987, only to collapse in March 1988.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, {{the company}} {{was the subject of}} a {{decision}} in a lawsuit before the Illinois Supreme Court when a creditor argued that it was owed monies from the defendants after judgments were obtained against them. The court ruled against <b>the</b> <b>creditor</b> and in favor of the law firm, stating that the retainer owed to the firm took precedence. In Dowling v Chicago Options Associates, Inc, the Illinois Supreme Court ruled that preemptive retainers used by attorneys were acceptable arrangements with clients.|$|E
5|$|Prompt Payment is {{a comedy}} {{that focuses on}} a lawyer named Jack who is deeply in debt {{to a bunch of}} <b>creditors.</b> <b>The</b> <b>creditors</b> gather {{together}} and go to Jack's office to demand repayment and refuse to leave until they are paid. Jack refuses to leave his office and <b>the</b> <b>creditors</b> decide to play poker while they wait. Jack escapes through a fire escape and dons a disguise and approaches them as another unhappy creditor. Jack's skill in the game leads him win a large sum of money from <b>the</b> <b>creditors.</b> Jack excuses himself from the game and returns undisguised to pay <b>the</b> <b>creditors</b> back, much to <b>the</b> <b>creditors</b> rejoicing.|$|R
50|$|An Official Assignee is {{an officer}} in the law court who {{distributes}} a bankrupt's assets to <b>the</b> <b>creditors.</b> He also assists the bankrupt to relieve of his obligations to <b>the</b> <b>creditors.</b>|$|R
50|$|At {{the first}} meeting of <b>the</b> <b>creditors,</b> up to five {{individuals}} may be appointed to be inspectors of the estate (except where <b>the</b> <b>creditors</b> decide that that is not necessary). No inspector may be appointed if he is a party to any contested action or proceeding against the estate. Where the value of an individual debtor's property is under $15,000, inspectors are not appointed (except where <b>the</b> <b>creditors</b> decide otherwise).|$|R
5|$|A Quistclose {{trust is}} a trust created where a {{creditor}} has lent {{money to a}} debtor for a particular purpose. In {{the event that the}} debtor uses the money for any other purpose, it is held on trust for <b>the</b> <b>creditor.</b> Any inappropriately spent money can then be traced, and returned to the creditors. The name and trust comes from the House of Lords decision in Barclays Bank Ltd v Quistclose Investments Ltd (1970), although the underlying principles can be traced back further. There has been much academic debate over the classification of Quistclose trusts in existing trusts law: whether they are resulting trusts, express trusts, constructive trusts or, as Lord Millett said in Twinsectra Ltd v Yardley, illusory trusts.|$|E
5|$|On November 29, 1820, the Assembly {{chartered}} the Bank of the Commonwealth, {{another source}} from which debtors could obtain money. Creditors {{did not want}} to accept payment from either the Bank of Kentucky or the Bank of the Commonwealth; the notes of the former were depreciated {{due to a lack of}} capital and the latter had no capital and no guarantee of state credit. In December 1820, the Assembly modified the replevin law to state that creditors who would accept payment in notes from the Bank of the Commonwealth but not the Bank of Kentucky would be forced to wait three months to collect on a debt. The wait was one year if <b>the</b> <b>creditor</b> accepted only notes from the Bank of Kentucky, and it remained two years for creditors who would not accept notes from either.|$|E

60|$|The great {{patron of}} these creditors, (to whose honor {{they ought to}} erect statues,) the right honorable gentleman,[9] in stating the merits which {{recommended}} them to his favor, has ranked them under three grand divisions. <b>The</b> first, <b>the</b> <b>creditors</b> of 1767; then <b>the</b> <b>creditors</b> of <b>the</b> cavalry loan; and lastly, <b>the</b> <b>creditors</b> of <b>the</b> loan in 1777. Let us examine them, one by one, as they pass in review before us.|$|R
50|$|In {{the event}} of the {{bankruptcy}} of the borrower, <b>the</b> unsecured <b>creditors</b> will have a general claim on {{the assets of the}} borrower after the specific pledged assets have been assigned to <b>the</b> secured <b>creditors.</b> <b>The</b> unsecured <b>creditors</b> will usually realize a smaller proportion of their claims than <b>the</b> secured <b>creditors.</b>|$|R

25|$|The notice {{must be in}} writing. The debtor {{does not}} commit this act of {{insolvency}} by informing <b>the</b> <b>creditor</b> orally that he cannot pay his debts, although he does provide <b>the</b> <b>creditor</b> with evidence of actual insolvency.|$|E

25|$|The {{opinion of}} the court, read by Justice Louis Brandeis, struck down the act on Fifth Amendment Takings Clause grounds. The court found the act {{stripped}} <b>the</b> <b>creditor</b> of property which was held before {{the passage of the}} act, without any form of compensation, and bestowed the property upon the debtor. Further, the act allowed the debtor to remain on the mortgaged property for up to five years after declaring bankruptcy, giving <b>the</b> <b>creditor</b> no opportunity to foreclose immediately. While the states could not impair contract obligations, the federal government could—but it could not take property in such a manner without compensating <b>the</b> <b>creditor.</b>|$|E
50|$|Here, any fine {{that might}} be imposed on the company could only be paid {{at the expense of}} <b>the</b> <b>creditors,</b> since, {{although}} <b>the</b> company could pay, it could only do so out of assets available for distribution to <b>the</b> <b>creditors.</b>|$|R
25|$|What if all <b>the</b> <b>creditors</b> are in KwaZulu Natal (KZN), but {{the debtor}} has {{just moved to}} the Western Cape, as in Ex parte Barton? The court held {{that it should be}} {{published}} in KZN, since its purpose is to notify <b>the</b> <b>creditors.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{administrator}} must inventory the debtors' assets, {{publish a}} call to <b>the</b> <b>creditors</b> and negotiate a debt restructuring agreement with <b>the</b> <b>creditors.</b> If <b>the</b> agreement is not concluded or if the moratorium expires, any creditor may request an immediate declaration of bankruptcy.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>creditor</b> may {{do so by}} filing an {{ordinary}} lawsuit against the debtor for the payment of the sum at issue.|$|E
25|$|In a {{partnership}} or joint venture where money is lent, <b>the</b> <b>creditor</b> only provides the capital yet is guaranteed {{a fixed amount}} of profit. The debtor, however, puts in time and effort, but is made to bear the risk of loss. Muslim scholars argue that such practice is unjust. As an alternative to usury, Islam strongly encourages charity and direct investment in which <b>the</b> <b>creditor</b> shares whatever profit or loss the business may incur (in modern terms, this amounts to an equity stake in the business).|$|E
25|$|If {{the debtor}} does not file an {{objection}}, {{or after the}} objection has been validly dismissed by the courts, <b>the</b> <b>creditor</b> may request execution proceedings to be initiated.|$|E

25|$|An arrest {{may only}} be ordered if <b>the</b> <b>creditor</b> can {{establish}} the prima facie validity of his claim {{as well as one}} of several statutory prerequisites for an arrest. An arrest may notably be imposed if the debtor holds a certificate of unpaid debts against the debtor, if the debtor attempts to hide or dispose of his assets, or if the debtor is not resident in Switzerland. The arrest of the assets of foreign debtors also establishes a venue in Switzerland under Swiss private international law in which the debtor may be sued by <b>the</b> <b>creditor,</b> except if the Lugano Convention is applicable.|$|E

30|$|We {{describe}} {{the effect of}} commitment operations on trust. Before we {{describe the}} effects, let us consider some situations wherein a commitment exists from a debtor toward a creditor. Effect of discharge. When a commitment is discharged, <b>the</b> <b>creditor’s</b> trust for <b>the</b> debtor increases. Effect of violation. When a commitment is violated, <b>the</b> <b>creditor’s</b> trust in <b>the</b> debtor decreases. Effect of delegation and discharge. When a commitment is delegated by the original debtor to a new debtor, and the new debtor satisfies it, <b>the</b> <b>creditor’s</b> trust in both the original and the new debtor increases. Effect of delegation and violation.

50|$|A typical {{proposal}} would involve a debtor making monthly payments for {{a maximum of}} five years, with the funds distributed to their creditors. Even though most proposals call for payments of less than the full amount of the debt owing, in most cases, <b>the</b> <b>creditors</b> will accept <b>the</b> deal, because if they do not, the next alternative may be personal bankruptcy, where <b>the</b> <b>creditors</b> will get even less money. <b>The</b> <b>creditors</b> have 45 days to accept or reject the consumer proposal. Once the proposal is accepted by both <b>the</b> <b>creditors</b> and <b>the</b> Court, the debtor makes the payments to the Proposal Administrator each month (or as otherwise stipulated in their proposal), and <b>the</b> general <b>creditors</b> are prevented from taking any further legal or collection action. If the proposal is rejected, the debtor is returned to his prior insolvent state and may have {{no alternative but to}} declare personal bankruptcy.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>creditor</b> must {{establish}} the debtor’s intention to evade or delay payment of his debts. Proof of departure or absence is not sufficient, because {{there may be}} other reasons (employment, for example) why he left.|$|E
