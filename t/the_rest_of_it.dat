(timber merchants), James Gresham (engineers), and W. T. Glovers & Co. (electric cable manufacturers). Glovers also built a power {{station in the}} park, {{on the banks of}} the Bridgewater Canal. Most of these early developments were built on the eastern side of the park, while <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> remained largely undeveloped.|$|E

After the ducklings are born, Mr. Mallard decides to take a trip up the river to see what <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> is like. Mr. and Mrs. Mallard agree to meet at the Public Garden in one week. In the meantime, Mrs. Mallard teaches the eight ducklings all they need to know about being ducks, such as swimming, diving, marching along, and to avoid dangers such as {{bicycles}} and other wheeled objects.|$|E
5|$|The album {{comprises}} four songs, all instrumental, and {{was recorded}} in two days.

5|$|Four Hungarian-built gate stock {{motor cars}} {{were used as}} ballast motor cars, and were {{numbered}} L13 to L16. The final one was stored in 1955, {{in the hope that}} it would be restored and preserved, but by 1960, the project appeared to be too costly, and so the gate end of the car was cut off, and <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> was scrapped. After refurbishment, the gate was displayed at the London Transport Museum. A further four Hungarian motor cars from the Piccadilly line were used as pilot motor cars during the reconstruction of the Hampstead line in 1922, and were numbered L17 to L20. Once a spur between the Hampstead line and the Piccadilly line at Kings Cross station was opened on 27 March 1927, it became much easier to transfer ballast motor cars between lines. The 14 departmental vehicles which were operational in 1934 continued to be used until 1953, by which time their age made maintenance very difficult. They were replaced {{over the next two years}} and scrapped.|$|E
5|$|The Singapore case Chew Kia Ngee v. Singapore Society of Accountants (1988), {{though not}} a {{judicial}} review application, illustrates how a decision-maker acts incorrectly if it fails {{to take into account}} relevant considerations. The Disciplinary Committee of the Singapore Society of Accountants had found the appellant, an auditor, guilty of an act or default discreditable to an accountant within the meaning of section 33(1)(b) of the Accountants Act because an incomplete auditor's report form that he had signed in advance had accidentally been submitted to the Monetary Authority of Singapore. The Committee had ordered that he be suspended from practice for five years. The appellant appealed the decision to the High Court on the basis that the Committee had not taken into account all the relevant considerations of the case in arriving at its decision. The Court concurred, holding that the Committee had not properly considered that the appellant had reviewed the incomplete form with his audit manager and had instructed him how to fill in <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> Therefore, this was not a case of an accountant recklessly signing a blank form without regard to his duties as an auditor. Accordingly, the Court allowed the appeal and set aside the Committee's order.|$|E

25|$|One {{locomotive}} survives in preservation. It {{was originally}} displayed as No.1, but investigations {{over a number}} of years finally identified it as either No. 13 or 14, and suggested that it was more likely to be No. 13 (the number which it now carries). After being displayed in the Science Museum, it was transferred to the Acton store of the London Transport Museum, and then to the newly reopened museum in Covent Garden. No. 36 was displayed on a plinth at Moorgate Metropolitan line station for many years but was damaged beyond repair by a bomb in 1940.
