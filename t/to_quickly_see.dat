50|$|Most basically, {{applications}} use code folding {{to outline}} source code, collapsing each block {{to a single}} line. This can be only top-level blocks like functions and classes, nested blocks like nested functions and methods, or all blocks, notably control-flow blocks. This allows one to get an overview of code, easily navigating and rearranging it, and to drill down into more detail as needed, without being distracted by other code. Viewing-wise, this allows one <b>to</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>see</b> {{a list of all}} functions (without their bodies), while navigation-wise this replaces extensive paging past long functions - or searching for the target - with going directly to the next function.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Interactive interpolating {{crossover}} {{allows a}} user <b>to</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>see</b> {{a large number}} of individuals formed by interactively-controlled interpolation between two or more par-ents. We study it {{here for the first time}} in the context of grammatical evolution (GE). We define methods of quantifying the behaviour of interpolations and use them to compare two methods of performing interpolation and two encodings for GE, one standard and one new. We conclude that a Cartesian interpolation combined with a novel developmental-style GE encoding gives the most usable results. We make connections between our work and broader issues of genotype-phenotype mappings, landscapes, and operators. I...|$|E
50|$|Mizi Xia was {{the favored}} courtier of Duke Ling {{because of his}} beauty. When Mizi Xia got news {{that his mother was}} ill, he forged an order from the Duke to use a ducal {{carriage}} <b>to</b> travel <b>quickly</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> her, and was praised for his filial piety. Another time, Mizi Xia bit into an especially delicious peach and gave the remainder to the Duke as a gift so he could taste it as well. Both acts ingratiated him further with the ruler. However, once Mizi Xia's looks faded, the Duke turned against him, claiming he stole the carriage and then insulted the Duke by offering him a half-eaten peach.|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} a Java graphical gaming framework that enables {{students in an}} introductory artificial intelligence (AI) course to immediately apply and visualize the topics from class. We have used this framework in teaching a mixed undergraduate/graduate AI course for six years. We believe {{that the use of}} games motivates students. The graphical nature of each game enables students <b>to</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>see</b> how well their algorithm works. Because the topics in an introductory AI course vary widely, students apply their algorithms to multiple game environments. A final challenging environment enables them to tie together the concepts for the entire semester...|$|E

40|$|Computational fluid {{dynamics}} (CFD) {{is a method}} of solving and analysing problems that involved fluid flows. In the field of architecture, urban design and urban planning, CFD is useful {{for the analysis of}} ventilation and airflow in the built environment, especially in very dense cities. This paper will look into the possibility of making CFD more accessible to the general design and planning field. A simulation is done on a urban design proposal <b>to</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>see</b> how air flow behaves around it. From there, it looks into the future where technology will make CFD simulation more easily adopted and the possibilities of integrating the ventilation analysis with other environmental analysis results into the urban design arena...|$|E

He seems to have been exposed to Flemish painting at a date earlier than the Florentines, <b>to</b> have <b>quickly</b> <b>seen</b> the potential of oils as a medium and then painted in nothing else. He carried the technique north to Venice with him, where it was soon adopted by Giovanni Bellini and became the favoured medium of the maritime republic where the art of fresco had never been a great success.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{information}} visualization technique for the graphical representation of causal relations, {{that is based}} on the metaphor of color pools spreading over time on a piece of paper. Messages between processes in the system a#ect the colors of their respective pool, making it possible <b>to</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>see</b> the influences each process has received. This technique, called Growing Squares, has been evaluated in a comparative user study and shown to be significantly faster and more e#cient for sparse data sets than the traditional Hasse diagram visualization. Growing Squares were also more e#cient for large data sets, but not significantly so. Test subjects clearly favored Growing Squares over old methods, naming the new technique easier, more e#cient, and much more enjoyable to use...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{framework}} for formulating domain-dependent 3 D search queries suitable for content-based 3 D search over the web. Users are typically not willing to spend much time to create a 3 D query object. They expect <b>to</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>see</b> a result set {{in which they can}} navigate by further differentiating the query object. Our system innovates by using a streamlined parametric 3 D modeling engine on both client and server side. Parametric tools have greater expressiveness, they allow shape manipulation through a few highlevel parameters, as well as incremental assembly of query objects. Short command strings are sent from client to server to keep the query objects on both sides in sync. This reduces turnaround times and allows asynchronous updates of live result sets...|$|E
40|$|Software {{is among}} the most complex human artifacts, and {{visualization}} is widely acknowledged as important to under-standing software. In this paper, we consider the problem of understanding a software system’s architecture through vi-sualization. Whereas traditional visualizations use multiple stakeholder-specific views to present different kinds of task-specific information, we propose an additional visualization technique that unifies the presentation of various kinds of architecture-level information, thereby allowing a variety of stakeholders <b>to</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>see</b> and communicate current devel-opment, quality, and costs of a software system. For future empirical evaluation of multi-aspect, single-view architec-tural visualizations, we have implemented our idea in an existing visualization tool, Vizz 3 D. Our implementation in-cludes techniques, {{such as the use of}} a city metaphor, that reduce visual complexity in order to support single-view vi-sualizations of large-scale programs. 1...|$|E

40|$|Currency of {{information}} in news consumption is an impor-tant facet {{of information}} quality which involves both the journalist providing updated information and the consumer being aware of updates and changes to the news stream. We are addressing information quality and currency in online news articles {{from the viewpoint of}} news consump-tion with the intent of reducing the consumption effort in-volved in getting the most up-to-date information on a breaking news story. The goal of this research is thus to develop a web-based user interface which (1) allows users <b>to</b> easily and <b>quickly</b> <b>see</b> updates <b>to</b> news articles online and (2) blends into existing consumption patterns by inte-grating into news websites.
