5|$|Lines {{of poems}} are often {{organized}} into stanzas, which are denominated {{by the number}} of lines included. Thus a collection of <b>two</b> <b>lines</b> is a couplet (or distich), three lines a triplet (or tercet), four lines a quatrain, and so on. These lines may or may not relate to each other by rhyme or rhythm. For example, a couplet may be <b>two</b> <b>lines</b> with identical meters which rhyme or <b>two</b> <b>lines</b> held together by a common meter alone.|$|E

5|$|The Oslo Metro {{operates}} in all fifteen boroughs of Oslo, {{as well as}} reaching a bit inside the neighbouring municipality of Bærum. There are five lines, numbered 1 through 5, each color-coded. They all pass through the Common Tunnel, serving eight branch lines. In addition <b>two</b> <b>lines</b> operate to the Ring Line. Two branches are served by <b>two</b> <b>lines</b> each: the Grorud branch is served by both lines 4 and 5, while the Lambertseter branch has full-time service by line 4 and limited service by line 1.|$|E

This manuscript contained 41 articles of romance, saints' lives, and various moral and religious pieces. Sir Orfeo was the 39th article in this manuscript. Using Auchnileck as the base text, Ashmole omits 19-22, 39-46, 59-60, 67-68, 92-98, 123-4, 177-8, 299-302, 367-79, 394, 397-400, 402-4, 409-10, 481-2, 591-2.

5|$|The Varanasi Metro is a {{rapid transit}} {{proposed}} for Varanasi. The proposed system consists of <b>two</b> <b>lines,</b> spanning from BHEL to Banaras Hindu University (19.35km) and Benia Bagh to Sarnath (9.885km). The feasibility {{study of the}} project was done by RITES and was completed in June 2015. Metro Rail is likely to be completed around 2020. There will be 26 stations, including 20 underground and six elevated on the <b>two</b> <b>lines,</b> which includes total length of 29.235km consisting of 23.467km underground, while 5.768km will be elevated.|$|E
5|$|The {{most basic}} {{property}} of the Reuleaux triangle {{is that it has}} constant width, meaning that for every pair of parallel supporting lines (<b>two</b> <b>lines</b> of the same slope that both touch the shape without crossing through it) the <b>two</b> <b>lines</b> have the same Euclidean distance from each other, regardless of the orientation of these lines. In any pair of parallel supporting lines, one of the <b>two</b> <b>lines</b> will necessarily touch the triangle at one of its vertices. The other supporting line may touch the triangle at any point on the opposite arc, and their distance (the width of the Reuleaux triangle) equals the radius of this arc.|$|E

Copper coins from Aurangzeb's reign were re-minted with his name.

5|$|Just {{south of}} Oslo Central Station, {{each of the}} two tracks will diverge, and follow {{different}} routes. The inbound track will hook up with the Østfold Line at Sjursøya, while the outbound track will diverge at Loenga. An additional connection to the Østfold Line will be made at Nordstrand. The Østfold Line connects to the Hoved Line and Loenga–Alnabru Line before reaching Oslo Central Station (OsloS). If the Kolbotn-alternative for the Follo Line is chosen, the Østfold Line will be rebuilt to follow a similar path to the Kolbotn station, which will require a new station building to accommodate the <b>two</b> <b>lines.</b> For this alternate route the <b>two</b> <b>lines</b> will enter the Kolbotn station at two levels, with the Follo Line running in a tunnel below, and the Østfold Line running at-grade above.|$|E

5|$|The Archer Avenue Lines are <b>two</b> <b>lines,</b> {{split between}} the BMT and IND, mostly running under Archer Avenue in the Jamaica {{neighborhood}} of Queens. Conceived as part of these 1968 expansion plans, they opened on December 11, 1988. There are stub-end tunnels east of the line's northern terminus, Jamaica Center–Parsons/Archer, on both levels, which extend past the station for possible future extensions.|$|E

Parliament rejected the proposed connection and the changes to the NWLR's route and the company's permissions eventually expired without any construction work being carried out. The Bakerloo Tube bill was withdrawn.|$|E

5|$|The Norwegian State Railways (NSB) {{serves the}} station with express trains to Oslo and Bodø, {{regional}} trains to Røros and Östersund in Sweden, and the Trøndelag Commuter Rail. The Trondheim Bus Station {{located at the}} station serves all long-distance buses, and some city buses. From 1913 to 1968 the station was also the terminus for <b>two</b> <b>lines</b> of the Trondheim Tramway.|$|E
5|$|The system {{initially}} {{had four}} standard gauge, single tracked lines, which had passing loops to allow trams to pass. Three originated at Stortorvet: the Gamlebyen Line, running east to Gamlebyen (now Old Oslo, but then called just Oslo); the Vestbanen Line, which ran west to Vestbanen station (Oslo West station); and the Ullevål Hageby Line, which ran west to Homansbyen, where the depot was located. In addition, {{there was a}} short connecting line between the Ullevål Hageby Line and the Vestbanen Line, but it was closed on 19 October 1875. The <b>two</b> <b>lines</b> that connected to the station only ran services that corresponded with train arrivals and departures; the other <b>two</b> <b>lines</b> had fixed fifteen-minute headway—decreasing to ten minutes from 22 June 1876. During the winter of 1875 and 1876, the company attempted to use sleds instead of wagons. They took delivery of seventeen units, but these were not as suitable as the wagons and the company instead chose to salt the rail tracks.|$|E
5|$|About 40% of {{the subway}} system runs on surface or {{elevated}} tracks, including steel or cast iron elevated structures, concrete viaducts, embankments, open cuts and surface routes. All of these construction methods are completely grade-separated from road and pedestrian crossings, and most crossings of two subway tracks are grade-separated with flying junctions. The sole exceptions of at-grade junctions of <b>two</b> <b>lines</b> in regular service are the 142nd Street junction, the Rogers junction and the Myrtle Avenue junction, whose tracks both intersect at the same level.|$|E

The blue men swim with their torsos raised out of the sea, twisting and diving as porpoises do. They are able to speak, and when a group approaches a ship its chief may shout <b>two</b> <b>lines</b> of poetry to the master of the vessel and challenge him to complete the verse. If the skipper fails in that task then the blue men will attempt to overturn the ship and capsize it.|$|E
5|$|At about noon, {{several hundred}} special constables were led onto the field. They formed <b>two</b> <b>lines</b> {{in the crowd}} a few yards apart, {{in an attempt to}} form a {{corridor}} through the crowd between the house where the magistrates were watching and the hustings, two waggons lashed together. Believing that this might be intended as the route by which the magistrates would later send their representatives to arrest the speakers, some members of the crowd pushed the waggons away from the constables, and pressed around the hustings to form a human barrier.|$|E
5|$|Bryennios {{arranged}} {{his army}} in the typical three divisions, each in <b>two</b> <b>lines,</b> as prescribed by the Byzantine military manuals. The right wing, under his brother John, was 5,000 strong and comprised his Frankish mercenaries, Thessalian cavalry, the Hetaireia, and the Maniakatai regiment (descendants of the veterans of George Maniakes's campaign in Sicily and Italy). His left wing, 3,000 men from Thrace and Macedonia, was placed under Katakalon Tarchaneiotes, and the centre, under Bryennios himself, comprised 3,000–4,000 men from Thessaly, Thrace and Macedonia. Again, according to standard doctrine, on his far left, about half a kilometer ("two stadia") from the main force, he had stationed an outflanking detachment (hyperkerastai) of Pechenegs.|$|E
