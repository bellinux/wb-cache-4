Note that if one has a lengthy sample, then this can be linearly mapped to the Pearson {{correlation}} of the <b>time-series</b> <b>data</b> with its lags. [...] Since d is approximately equal to 2(1−r), where r is the sample autocorrelation of the residuals, d=2 indicates no autocorrelation. The value of d always lies between 0 and 4. If the Durbin–Watson statistic is substantially less than 2, there is evidence of positive serial correlation. As a rough rule of thumb, if Durbin–Watson is less than 1.0, there may be cause for alarm. Small values of d indicate successive error terms are, on average, close in value to one another, or positively correlated. If d>2, successive error terms are, on average, much different in value from one another, i.e., negatively correlated. In regressions, this can imply an underestimation of the level of statistical significance.|$|E

40|$|In {{the era of}} the Internet of Things, {{enormous}} number of sensors have been deployed in different locations, generating massive <b>time-series</b> sensory <b>data</b> with geo-tags. However, such sensory readings are easily missing due to various reasons such as the hardware malfunction, connection errors,and data corruption. This paper focuses on this challenge how to accurately yet efficiently recover the missing values for corrupted <b>time-series</b> sensor <b>data</b> with geo-stamps. In this paper, we formulate the <b>time-series</b> sensor <b>data</b> as a 3 -order tensor that naturally preserves sensors' temporal and spatial dependencies. Then we exploit its low-rank and sparse-noise structures by drawing upon recent advances in Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) and tensor completion theory. The main novelty of this paper lies in that, we design a highly efficient optimization method that combines the alternating direction method of multipliers and accelerated proximal gradient to recover the data tensor. Besides testing our method using the synthetic data, we also design a real-world testbed by passive RFID (Radio- Frequency IDentification) sensors. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of our approach. Wenjie Ruan, Peipei Xu, Quan Z. Sheng, Nguyen Khoi Tran, Xue Li, Wei Emma Zhan...|$|R

Finally, by setting all ∆’s to zero and solving for M, one can derive the long-run steady state relationship for net migration rates. The calculated long-run coefficients are used for the simulations of the expected magnitude of immigration from Croatia and the EaP-countries to the EU- 15 under different policy scenarios.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate effects of varying readout bandwidths on the arterial spin labeling (ASL) -perfusion MRI measurements at a high magnetic field MRI system. Brain perfusion studies were performed on nine volunteers (four males, five females) using flow sensitive alternating inversion recovery (FAIR) ASL single-shot echo-planar imaging (EPI) -MRI. To investigate EPI bandwidth effects on the time-series perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) data, two regions-of-interest (ROI) were placed outside the brain to determine the level of noise and another ROI inside the brain to determine the level of signal. Coefficients of variations (CoV) were calculated for the <b>time-series</b> PWI <b>data.</b> One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to investigate voxel-wise differences in the <b>time-series</b> PWI <b>data</b> between two different bandwidth values. At the level of ROI, there was no significant effect of changing EPI bandwidths on the <b>time-series</b> PWI <b>data</b> in any of the volunteers (P >  0. 031). In contrast, CoV values over the dynamic PWI data varied with depending on selecting EPI bandwidths and voxel-based tests showed that N 2 ghosting, modulated by EPI bandwidth, can appear in some brain regions, especially in areas that overlap with the spatial distribution of N 2 ghosting artifacts. Although N 2 ghosting can be reduced by adjusting the bandwidth of EPI on the <b>time-series</b> of PWI <b>data,</b> the effects cannot be entirely eliminated. In particular, N 2 ghosting can bias CBF quantification if EPI control scans to determine the equilibrium-state signal are confounded by N 2 ghosting. Therefore, careful tuning of the bandwidth of EPI is necessary to avoid artifacts in the ASL signal from N 2 -ghosting...|$|R

However, the efficiency of DBN in inferring GRNs is often hampered by missing values in expression data, and excessive computation time due to the large search space whereby DBN treats all genes as potential regulators for a target gene.
