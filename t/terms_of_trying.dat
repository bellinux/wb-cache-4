50|$|With 11 {{wins and}} 13 losses, the Tigers' season {{came to an}} end with them in 10th place out in the 16-team competition. Despite the result, the Tigers {{performed}} well in small areas of the game, which showed in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> the team's overall statistics {{at the end of the}} season. The error count was one area where they performed well, being ranked second in the league. They also performed strongly in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>tries,</b> scoring 89; only six teams scored more. They lacked penetration, however, ranking close to the bottom in the league in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> line breaks, tackle busts, off loads and metres gained. Defence was also a problem, with the Tigers conceding 45 points more than they scored. The failure of the club's new signings to perform as expected hurt the Tigers, while injuries to several key players, including Robbie Farah and Lote Tuqiri, compounded their situation. Benji Marshall stood in as captain in Farah's absence, and was the team's top scorer, with 167 points, which was fifth overall in the competition. Aaron Woods, who played all 24 games of the season, was named the club's Player of the Year.|$|R

50|$|There are correspondences between certain {{divisions}} {{and the presence}} or absence of medial glides in later dialects, in ways that differ depending on the class of the initial (e.g. velar, labial, retroflex, etc.). There are also clear co-occurrence restrictions between initials and divisions, in that initials from certain of these same classes can occur with finals only from certain divisions. The LMC authors of this system appear to have been aware of these classes of initials, and seem to have determined the separation into divisions partly on the basis of the co-occurrence relationships and partly on the medial glides, although it is debated how the exact classification was made. It is important to remember that the authors of this system were attempting to use LMC phonology to reconstruct EMC phonology (although they probably thought of it more in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>trying</b> to harmonize the way that words were normally pronounced with the rather different system of rhymes and homophones as laid out in the Qieyun).|$|E

Chief TV critic of Indiewire, Ben Travers quipped, [...] "'It all works out' seems to be the main takeaway from the pilot, but where things specifically go from here is one whopping question mark. Perhaps if this was an episodic anthology series with new characters flooding in every week and new arcs every season, This Is Us could repeat the mysterious highs of its subjectively mediocre pilot (depending on how you like that ending)." [...] In a moderate review of Variety, Sonia Saraiya said, [...] "It's deceptively difficult to build a surprising and complete story in just 40 minutes with so many characters. Yet This Is Us manages to both craft an intimate series of portraits and stitch them together. But at the same time, waves of cloying sentiment threaten to submerge everything." ...|$|E

[...] The CMAs then approached Joseph Kahn - after he won the Grammy Award for Best Music Video for Taylor Swift's [...] "Bad Blood" [...] at the 58th Annual Grammy Awards - and solicited his opinion about whether there were any country songs which he would like to do. Kahn began to think about different possible songs but felt that the choices were too limited in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>trying</b> to get the entire history of country music into one song. So he pitched the CMA board the idea of doing a mash-up of three different songs, so that one will get more of a breadth of the history. Kahn then came up with the concept of blending songs together into one song. He told CNN, [...] "I didn't think one song could encapsulate all of country music, so I pitched the idea of doing a mashup of a couple songs and blending them together." [...] But Kahn was told that this would never work and the reaction was the same to whoever he approached.|$|E

Nichols described Scorsese as [...] "a shepherd of this project and wanted to see it made into a narrative film", and later laid out his approach in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>trying</b> to stay with the Lovings as much as possible through the telling of the story, something of which Scorsese was very supportive of.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{submitted}} in partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Arts in English, 2015. Cataloged from PDF version of thesis. Includes bibliographical references (page 50 - 51). The {{purpose of this study}} was to find out the similarities and differences in learning styles between English medium and Bengali medium learners. This study attempted to find whether the learning styles of Bengali medium and English medium students’ are same or different. To find the similarities and differences the researcher did surveys in English medium and Bengali medium schools. It has analyzed the surveys or the answers or responds of questionnaires by using bar charts and following quantitative method. This research also provided the recommendation which can help teachers in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>trying</b> different learning styles in their teaching, so that students can discover and be introduced with different learning styles. There is no research which is free from limitations; similarly this research also faced limitations. By overcoming obstacles and limitations, this study finally became capable to find out the answers of research question. Tahmina TuliB. A. in Englis...|$|E

In <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> robustness, we <b>try</b> using different types of external data to increase lexical coverage, and find that simple POS tags have the most effect, increasing coverage on unseen data by up to 45 %.

Even using vanilla POS tags we achieve some efficiency gains, but when using detailed lexical types as supertags we manage to halve parsing time with minimal loss of coverage or precision. ...|$|R
