Odd goes {{to visit his}} mother at the retirement home, which only makes him more unhappy: his mother is senile and spends her days staring emptily out <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> visit reminds him of his own impending old age. While Odd is at a restaurant, police come in and arrest the cook. At the shop where he normally buys his pipe tobacco, he learns that the owner has died. He decides to sell his boat, leading to misadventures when the buyer, who works at an airport, asks Odd to meet him there inside the secure zone. Odd goes to the local swimming pool, but his shoes were removed when the facility closed; as he is leaving, he finds a pair of red high-heeled boots and walks away in them.|$|E

25|$|The {{windows of}} the photomultipliers act as {{wavelength}} filters; this may be irrelevant if the cutoff wavelengths are outside of the application range or outside of the photocathode sensitivity range, but special care {{has to be taken}} for uncommon wavelengths. Borosilicate glass is commonly used for near-infrared to about 300nm. High borate borosilicate glasses exist also in high UV transmission versions with high transmission also at 254 nm. Glass with very low content of potassium can be used with bialkali photocathodes to lower the background radiation from the potassium-40 isotope. Ultraviolet glass transmits visible and ultraviolet down to 185nm. Used in spectroscopy. Synthetic silica transmits down to 160nm, absorbs less UV than fused silica. Different thermal expansion than kovar (and than borosilicate glass that's expansion-matched to kovar), a graded seal needed between <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> rest of the tube. The seal is vulnerable to mechanical shocks. Magnesium fluoride transmits ultraviolet down to 115nm. Hygroscopic, though less than other alkali halides usable for UV windows.|$|E

500|$|Darwin {{described}} [...] "the {{most remarkable}} of all Orchids", Catasetum, and showed how in these flowers, [...] "as throughout nature, pre-existing structures and capacities [...] utilised for new purposes". He explained the mechanism {{in which the}} pollen masses of the pollinium were connected by a bent stalk or pedicel to a sticky disc kept moist {{at the back of}} the flower. When an insect touched an [...] "antenna" [...] projecting from the back of the flower, this released the bent pedicel which sprang straight and fired the pollinium, sticky disc first, at the insect. In experiments, Darwin had imitated this action using a whalebone spring. He vividly illustrated how the flower ejected the pollinium with considerable force: [...] "I touched the antennæ of C. callosum whilst holding the flower at about a yard's distance from <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> pollinium hit the pane of glass, and adhered to the smooth vertical surface by its adhesive disc." ...|$|E

500|$|This album {{included}} three new songs. [...] "Quién" [...] {{was written by}} Arjona, who co-produced it with Tommy Torres. It was released as the lead single from the album on 19 June 2007. Arjona commented that [...] "'Quién' is the world out of <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> prison built by ourselves. It's {{the freedom to choose}} the path or to prefer loneliness as an argument of nostalgia. 'Quién' is a story with the hurry of the desperate, is the flashback of those who end up loving alone." [...] "Quiero", also written by Arjona, was released as the second single in November 2007. Website ADN Mundo called the song bohemian and hippie, and that it was [...] "a love story that doesn't speak about love, but instead about the recent events on the world we live [...] and finally comes to the search of an individual who challenges nostalgia finding entertainment on the impossible." [...] In 2009, [...] "Quiero" [...] was awarded the Pop/Ballad Songs of the Year award by the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers. The third new song on the album was [...] "Espantapájaros", which was written by Arjona and Miguel Luna.|$|E

The song's lyrics were written by Ricardo Arjona and the music was composed by Tommy Torres, who also worked with Arjona on his tenth studio album, Adentro. The song was produced by Lee Levin, Dan Warner and Torres with additional help from Arjona. Warner also played the electric and acoustic guitars and the bass; Levin handled the drum and percussion instruments, and Matt Rollings played the piano. [...] "Quién" [...] is performed by Arjona with additional background vocals from Tommy Torres. The song was recorded between five studios in Miami: The Tiki Room, Picks & Hammers, Jet Wash Studio, The Hit Factory Criteria and Hit Masters; and in Jocoteco Studios in Mexico City. [...] "Quién" [...] was mixed in Barking Doctor Studios in New York City by Mick Guzauski, and mastered by Vlado Meller at the Sony Music Studios on that city.
