5|$|Another {{unsuccessful}} {{assassination attempt}} {{took place on}} 25 October, when Lugovoy and Kovtun flew to London again. They left radioactive traces again in their hotel prior to meeting Litvinenko, but did not administer <b>the</b> <b>poison,</b> perhaps due to security cameras in the meeting room. They again disposed of <b>the</b> <b>poison</b> via their room's toilet, and left London.|$|E
5|$|The natural poison fluoroacetate (Compound 1080) is {{commonly}} used in Australia to control introduced pests such as European rabbits, foxes, feral predators, and wild dogs such as dingoes. <b>The</b> <b>poison</b> is extremely toxic to introduced pests, but less so to native animals as it is found naturally in many Australian plants. However, juvenile quolls may be susceptible to <b>the</b> <b>poison.</b> Research is underway {{to determine whether the}} number of quolls protected from predators may be less than those killed by <b>the</b> <b>poison.</b>|$|E
5|$|Different tammar {{populations have}} {{varying levels of}} {{resistance}} to sodium fluoroacetate. Mainland Western tammars {{appear to be the}} most resistant, while those on Kangaroo Island are much more vulnerable. Tammars from New Zealand are also vulnerable, as <b>the</b> <b>poison</b> has been successfully used to control their populations. Tammars from East and West Wallabi Islands and Garden Island, which do not have plants containing sodium fluoroacetate, are less resistant than mainland Western tammars but are more resistant than those from Kangaroo Island. This suggests that tammars originated in South Australia and developed a resistance to sodium fluoroacetate when they reached Western Australia, where <b>the</b> <b>poison</b> is found in plants.|$|E

5|$|In 1999, Carpenter {{and colleagues}} {{described}} material {{of a large}} nodosaurid from Utah, discovered in {{a member of the}} Cedar Mountain Formation called <b>the</b> <b>Poison</b> Strip Sandstone, which is contemporaneous with the Cloverly Formation. He originally referred it to Sauropelta as a possible new species, but it was never named.

5|$|According {{to another}} urban legend, daddy long legs (Pholcidae) have potent venom, but their fangs are {{too short to}} deliver <b>the</b> <b>poison.</b> This myth might have arisen due to its {{similarity}} in appearance with the Brown recluse spider.

5|$|One of {{the chief}} {{measures}} by which Ranavalona maintained order within her realm was through the traditional practice of trial by the ordeal of tangena. A poison was extracted from the nut of the native tangena (Tanghinia venenifera) shrub and ingested, with the outcome determining innocence or guilt. If nobles or freemen were compelled to undergo the ordeal, <b>the</b> <b>poison</b> was typically administered to the accused only after dog and rooster stand-ins had already died from the poison's effects, while {{among members of the}} slave class (andevo), the ordeal required them to immediately ingest <b>the</b> <b>poison</b> themselves. The accused would be fed <b>the</b> <b>poison</b> along with three pieces of chicken skin: if all three pieces of skin were vomited up then innocence was declared, but death or a failure to regurgitate all three pieces of skin indicated guilt. According to 19th-century Malagasy historian Raombana, {{in the eyes of the}} greater populace, the tangena ordeal was believed to represent a sort of celestial justice in which the public placed their unquestioning faith, even to the point of accepting a verdict of guilt in a case of innocence as a just but unknowable divine mystery.|$|E

50|$|Some {{members of}} Smith's party later testified that during their encampment they saw <b>the</b> Baker-Fancher party <b>poison</b> a spring and a dead ox, with the {{expectation}} that Native Americans would be poisoned. Silas S. Smith, the cousin of George A., testified that the Baker-Fancher party suspiciously asked whether the Native Americans would eat a dead ox. Although <b>the</b> <b>poisoning</b> story supported <b>the</b> Mormon theory that Native Americans had been poisoned and therefore conducted a massacre on their own, Modern historians generally discount the testimony and rumors about <b>the</b> <b>poisoned</b> ox and spring as false. Nevertheless, <b>the</b> <b>poisoning</b> story preceded <b>the</b> Fanchers on their trip southward.|$|R
5|$|Predators {{including}} Cactoblastis cactorum (mentioned above) {{can also}} be used to destroy invasive plant species. As another example, <b>the</b> <b>poison</b> hemlock moth (Agonopterix alstroemeriana) can be used to control poison hemlock (Conium maculatum). During its larval stage, the moth strictly consumes its host plant, poison hemlock, and can exist at hundreds of larvae per individual host plant, destroying large swathes of the hemlock.|$|E

5|$|The Master {{spends most}} of his time {{drinking}} alcohol, and people begin trying to convince him to move into a nursing home, where no dogs are allowed. One summer, an outbreak of rabies spreads through the fox population. After one infected fox attacks a group of human children, the same people approach the Master and ask his help in killing the foxes. He uses traps and poison to try to kill as many foxes as possible; however, <b>the</b> <b>poison</b> also kills domestic animals. After a human child dies from eating it, the humans remove all of <b>the</b> <b>poison,</b> then the Master organizes a hunt in which large numbers of people line up and walk straight into the woods, flushing out foxes to be shot. The aging Tod escapes all three events, as well as an attempt at coursing him with greyhounds.|$|E
5|$|Lugovoy and Kovtun met Litvinenko in the Millennium {{hotel bar}} twice, on 1 November (when <b>the</b> <b>poisoning</b> took place), and earlier, on 16 October.

This {{leads to a}} few characteristic behaviors and traits found in organisms with an uneven sex ratio. In general, females {{have a choice of}} mate.

However, the secretions of these glands could also be used for nest construction.|$|E
