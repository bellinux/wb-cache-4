5|$|Between 1904 and 1906 {{the castle}} was rented by the Morell family, after {{which it was}} {{occupied}} by the Dowager Lady Glanusk. The architect W. D. Caroe was employed to restore the house in 1910 and it was sold to the banker Benjamin Guiness in 1937. A major fire then destroyed <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{eastern side of the}} castle in 1939. Around 1961, the castle was acquired by Richard Booth who used it as a bookstore and as a location for parties, with a holiday cottage in the grounds. Much of the walled garden was sold for development in 1975, and another fire in 1977 destroyed <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> western half of the castle: repairs were carried out from the 1980s onwards.|$|E

5|$|Results from a {{histological}} {{analysis performed}} on a rib from specimen FMNH PR 3847 were reported by McDonald and colleagues in 2017. Extensive bone remodeling {{has occurred in the}} internal matrix of the rib. The medullary cavity, which houses the marrow, is marked by the presence of many cavities, or lacunae. On the outer surface of the bone, osteons have almost completely replaced <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bone; the layered growth of the bone is more visible on <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bone, where five lines of arrested growth (LAGs) are visible. A sixth LAG is possibly present within the medullary region, but is relatively limited in extent, which makes this identification questionable.|$|E
