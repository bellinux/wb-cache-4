Keldric is thrown off of Stroud's airship, and the Lorimarians invade Illusia again. Stroud opens the portal, and a wave of dark energy is released, transforming the Tree, turning the people of Illusia into monsters called Grimlies, and releasing dark monsters from Mavolia. Keldric and Faye flee, and head for Fa'Diel.|$|E
5|$|The Smart Street Initiative, a 20-year plan to {{make the}} city safer for pedestrians, bicyclists, and motorists, began in 2013 with the {{conversion}} of one-way streets to two-way streets.

25|$|The Main South Line, {{sometimes}} referred to as part of the South Island Main Trunk Railway, is a railroad line that runs north and south from Lyttelton in New Zealand through Christchurch and along the east coast of the South Island to Invercargill via Dunedin. It {{is one of the most}} important railway lines in New Zealand and was one of the first to be built, with construction commencing in the 1860s.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{main line}} was the Albany and Susquehanna Railroad, which the D leased on February 24, 1870. The Delaware and Hudson {{already had a}} history of working with the Albany and Susquehanna, agreeing in 1866 to jointly build an {{extension}} to Nineveh and subsequently ship coal across the entire line. The two companies then entered into an arrangement whereby the Delaware and Hudson perpetually leased the Albany and Susquehanna for $490,000 per year. The connecting Lackawanna and Susquehanna Railroad, chartered in 1867 and opened in 1872, was also absorbed. The Albany and Susquehanna provided a line from Albany southwest to Binghamton, while the Lackawanna and Susquehanna split from that line at Nineveh, running south to the Jefferson Railroad at Lanesboro. Also leased in 1870 was the Schenectady and Susquehanna Railroad, connecting the Albany and Susquehanna at Duanesburg to Schenectady, opened in 1872 (reorganized as the Schenectady and Duanesburg Railroad in 1873).|$|E
25|$|Findings {{indicate}} that the Denisovan gene flow event happened to the common ancestors of Aboriginal Filipinos, Aboriginal Australians, and New Guineans. New Guineans and Australians have similar rates of Denisovan admixture, indicating that interbreeding took place prior to their common ancestors' entry into Sahul (Pleistocene New Guinea and Australia), at least 44,000 years ago. It has also been observed that the fraction of Near Oceanian ancestry in Southeast Asians {{is proportional to the}} Denisovan admixture, except in the Philippines where there is a higher proportional Denisovan admixture to Near Oceanian ancestry. Reich et al. (2011) suggested a possible model of an early eastward migration wave of modern humans, some who were Philippine/New Guinean/Australian common ancestors that interbred with Denisovans, respectively followed by divergence of the Philippine early ancestors, interbreeding between the New Guinean and Australian early ancestors with a part of the same early-migration population that did not experience Denisovan gene flow, and interbreeding between the Philippine early ancestors with a part of the population from a much-later eastward migration wave (<b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> migrating population would become East Asians).|$|E

25|$|In early 1591 an English fleet {{had been}} {{organised}} for a raiding {{expedition to the}} Spanish West Indies. The expedition had been financed in a joint stock venture and was organised into three fleets. The first and main fleet was financed largely by John Watts but also had investment from Walter Raleigh, Paul Bayning and Sir Francis Drake. The expeditions captain was William Lane of the 120-ton Centaur, while second in command was Captain Michael Geare in the 150-ton Little John and the 80-ton Pegasus under Captain Stephen Michell and the pinnace Fifth Part. The back up fleet was composed of two ships – Margaret of 60 tons under Captain Christopher Newport and the 50-ton Prudence under Captain John Burough. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fleet had been financed largely by Sir George Carew – the 200-ton Hopewell (alias Harry and John) of Captain William Craston, the 130-ton bark Burr of under Captain William Irish, the 35-ton Swallow under Ralph Lee and the 30-ton Content under Captain Nicholas Lisle. They were to attack and raid any Spanish or Portuguese shipping {{in the area of}} Hispaniola and Cuba with the aim of making a profit.|$|E
25|$|In the Spring of 1864, Churchill's Division, with Hawthorn's Brigade moved {{south to}} oppose Union General Nathaniel Bank's Red River Campaign in north-central Louisiana in March and early April 1864, {{defeating}} {{him at the}} Battle of Pleasant Hill, Louisiana, on April 10, 1864. Hawthorn's Brigade was initially left behind at Camden {{when the rest of}} the army went to join General Taylor. They were eventually called upon as well, and left Camden for Louisiana on April 5. They reached Shreveport around April 14 or 15 when they got news about the Confederate victories at Mansfield and Pleasant Hill.

25|$|LeuT {{has been}} co-crystallised with {{sertraline}} and (R)- and (S)-fluoxetine where the SSRIs {{have been found}} to bind as non-competitive inhibitors in a vestibule binding site (can be looked at as a second binding site), which is separated from the drugs binding site by the site chains of the two aromatic amino acids of the extracellular gate of the transport protein. The halogens on the SSRIs chemical structure all bind to the same HBP within LeuT and interact with similar amino acids, but the amino acid sequence in the HBP is highly preserved between LeuT and SERT. That suggest that in the human SERT the SSRIs also bind both at the same position and with similar manner, which is a key feature making the SSRIs selective for SERT. Conversely, there could be differences in their binding where <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drug molecule will likely bind to SERT in a different way, given the diversity in their structure. The localisation of the vestibular binding site, as the primary SSRI binding site in SERT is, is however controversial since some research has shown that the SSRIs work in competitive manner by binding to the drugs binding site, not to the second binding site.|$|E
25|$|Recall {{memory is}} linked with {{instincts}} and mechanisms {{in order to}} remember how an event happened to learn from it or avoid the agitator, connections are made with emotions. For instance, if a speaker is very calm and neutral, the effectiveness of encoding memory is very low and listeners get the gist of what the speaker is discussing. On the other hand, if a speaker is shouting and/or using emotionally driven words, listeners tend to remember key phrases {{and the meaning of}} the speech. This is full access of the fight or flight mechanism all people have functioning in the brain, but based on what triggers this mechanism will lead to better recall of it. People tend to focus their attention on cues that are loud, very soft, or something unusual. This makes the auditory system pick up the differences in regular speaking and meaningful speech, when something significant is spoken in the discussion people home in on the message at that part of the speech but tend to lose <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> discussion. Our brains sense differences in speech and when those differences occur the brain encodes that part of speech into memory and the information can be recalled for future reference.|$|E
25|$|The most {{difficult}} {{task for the}} special effects artists to achieve was to make live-action footage interact with separately filmed stop-motion animation - to make {{the interaction between the}} humans and the creatures of the island seem believable. The most simple of these effects were accomplished by exposing part of the frame, than running the same piece of the film through the camera again by exposing <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> frame with a different image. The most complex shots, where the live-action actors interacted with the stop-motion animation, were achieved via two different techniques, the Dunning process and the Williams process, in order to produce the effect of a travelling matte. The Dunning process, invented by cinematographer Carroll H. Dunning, employed the use of blue and yellow lighting, filtered and photographed into black-and-white film. Bi packing of the camera was used for these types of effects. With it, the special effects crew could combine two strips of different film at the same time, creating the final composite shot in the camera. It was used in the climactic scene where one of the Curtiss Helldiver planes attacking Kong crashes {{from the top of the}} Empire State Building, and in the scene where natives are running through the foreground, while Kong is fighting other natives at the wall.|$|E
