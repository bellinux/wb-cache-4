This environment is based upon a data-flow language and a synchronous model; the composition of interacting sub-systems and tasking of data-flow processes do not introduce unpredictability.

40|$|The {{parasitoid}} wasp Nasonia vitripennis reproduces by haplodiploidy; {{males are}} haploid and females are diploid. Sex determination in Nasonia is not governed by complementary alleles at {{one or more}} sex loci. As in most other insects, the sex-determining pathway consists of the basal switch doublesex that is sex-specifically regulated by transformer. Analysis of a polyploid and a mutant gynandromorphic strain, suggested a parent-specific effect (imprinting) on sex determination in Nasonia. Zygotic activity of transformer is autoregulated and depends {{on a combination of}} maternal provision of tra mRNA and a paternal genome set. This constitutes a novel way of <b>transformer</b> <b>control</b> in insect sex determination implying maternal imprinting. The nature of the maternal imprint is not yet known and it remains to be determined how broadly the Nasonia sex-determining mechanism applies to other haplodiploids. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: As an {{integral}} part of the Smart Grid, smart transformers both work independently to constantly regulate voltage and maintain contact with the smart grid in order to allow remote administration if needed and to provide information and feedback about the power supply and the transformers themselves. Through a process known as voltage optimization, a smart transformer provides the exact amount of power that is needed, and responds instantly to fluctuations within the power grid, acting as a voltage regulator to ensure that the optimized voltage is undisturbed. Because they directly reduce energy consumption, smart transformers therefore directly reduce greenhouse gas emissions as well. As a recognized Smart transformer are a ready and significant source of LEED Points for any business or organization in pursuit of LEED certification. This makes them an important part of any energy retrofit or lighting retrofit. While smart transformers immediately reduce power consumption by providing a stable, optimal power supply that supplies electrical equipment with its ideal voltage, they also protect electrical equipment from power fluctuations – thereby helping electrical equipment last longer. In this paper we discuss on a continuous and discrete smart transformer which is accurate and fast respectively. The continuous smart transformer has a continuous turn ratio and it controls the microgrid side voltage without voltage steps, there for it increases the system accuracy and on another side discrete smart transformer has discrete turn ratio, the output is regulated between several discrete values and discrete smart transformer is less accurate.
