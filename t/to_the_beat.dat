5|$|Cockatoos {{often have}} {{pronounced}} responses to musical sounds and numerous videos exist showing the birds dancing to popular music. Research conducted in 2008 with an Eleonora cockatoo named Snowball had {{indicated that this}} particular individual is indeed capable of beat induction—perceiving human-created music and synchronizing his body movements <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beat.</b>|$|E
5|$|Tristan Tzara was an {{influential}} author and performer, whose contribution {{is credited with}} having created a connection from Cubism and Futurism <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Beat</b> Generation, Situationism and various currents in rock music. The friend and collaborator of many modernist figures, he was the lover of dancer Maja Kruscek in his early youth and was later married to Swedish artist and poet Greta Knutson.|$|E

5|$|The Karashishi is {{most notably}} found in Japan at the {{entrance}} of Shinto Shrines and are used to either ward-off bad spirits or welcome good spirits. The Karashishi dance in Ikata involves two persons dancing under a single guardian lion costume <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beat</b> of the drum of a young boy. Ikata's performers are especially well-known throughout most of the prefecture for their dedication to the dance.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} a blonde Spears sitting and {{laughing}} in a bar with two female friends, but stops {{to look at a}} brunette Spears calling out to her on a small stage in front of them, wearing a leather vest, a studded belt, panties and fishnet stockings while sporting a tattoo on her biceps. She dances erotically around a pole and up against a mirror. Throughout the video, she continues to dance and flip her hair while special effects lights flash around her as the camera moves slightly in and out of focus <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beat</b> of the song. The video's light systems change from black and white with aura-like blue and pink hues to full blown color. Around the middle of the video, she is joined by two alter egos of her female friends, who also dance around the pole. The blonde Spears and her friends, while watching the dancing, later draw their attention to an attractive man sitting with his friends at a table across the bar.|$|E
25|$|A B multi-camera {{recording}} of Blondie in 1979, {{just prior to}} the release of their fourth album, Eat <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Beat,</b> was taped at the Asbury Park Convention Hall on July 7, a home-state crowd for Jersey girl Debbie Harry, who was raised in Hawthorne.|$|E
50|$|The {{organism}} is {{aptly named}} “Vorticella” due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beating</b> cilia creating whirlpools, or vortices.  It {{is also known}} as the “Bell Animalcule” due to its bell-shaped body.|$|R

25|$|The skaters then gyrated to the pulsing rhythm {{forming a}} {{familiar}} heart shape pumping <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beat.</b> The formation was soon shattered when a lone skater symbolising {{a spark of}} passion shot through the beating heart.

25|$|Bariw Festival is {{a unique}} festival {{showcasing}} the skills of every Nabasnon in weaving bags, mats and hats made of bariw leaves - the prospering livelihood in the municipality.

25|$|Arguably, {{there are}} many USB-based decorations {{embedded}} in existing productskeyboards with impractical backlighting (such as ones that only turn on while pressing a key, and ones that flash <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beat</b> of a song), mice that (when the computer is turned off) turn on/off their light to a pre-programmed beat, or printers that show random quotations on LCD screens when not in use.|$|E

60|$|We pitched tent {{at night}} {{just below the}} ford, and {{opposite}} another Indian village in which a most mournful medicine song was going on, timed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beating</b> of drums. Dogs joined with the mourning of the people with cries of almost human anguish, <b>to</b> which <b>the</b> <b>beat</b> of <b>the</b> passionless drum added solemnity, and a sort of inexorable marching rhythm. It seemed to announce pestilence and flood, and made the beautiful earth a place of hunger and despair.|$|R
50|$|Kachchhi Ghodi dance {{dance is}} {{performed}} on dummy horses where men in elaborate costumes ride the equally well decorated dummy horses. Holding naked swords, these dancers move rhythmically <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beating</b> of drums and fifes.|$|R
25|$|In 2002, X-Squad, the school's cheering team, came up {{with the}} Xavier Rap, the school song in rap format, and {{allowing}} people to dance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beat.</b> In the same year, a violin and acoustic guitar version was produced as well. These two instrumental versions provide an atmosphere for reflection – a common Jesuit trait and activity – derived from the Examen.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{this dance}} {{does not have}} any songs but only danced <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beat</b> of Urumi Melam, Thappu Melam and sometimes, a long flute. The dancers hold a kerchief in each hand and swing them as they dance. The person leading the dance wears false beard and a mask {{decorated}} with shells to look like teeth. He dances the first step, which others follow.|$|E
25|$|There are two {{distinct}} applications of this technique. One is the optical clock, where an optical frequency is overlapped {{with a single}} tooth of the comb on a photodiode, and a radio frequency is compared <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beat</b> signal, the repetition rate, and the CEO-frequency. Applications for the frequency-comb technique include optical metrology, frequency-chain generation, optical atomic clocks, high-precision spectroscopy, and more precise GPS technology.|$|E
50|$|Pulikali, {{also known}} as Kaduvakali is a common sight during Onam season. This dance showcases {{performers}} painted like tigers in bright yellow, red and black, who dance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beats</b> of instruments like Chenda and thakil.|$|R

25|$|Over {{the last}} 100 years, the East Village and the Lower East Side have contributed {{significantly}} to American arts and culture in New York. The neighborhood has been the birthplace of cultural icons and movements from the American gangster to the Warhol Superstars, folk music to punk rock, anti-folk to hip-hop, advanced education to organized activism, experimental theater <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Beat</b> Generation and the community of experimental musicians, composers and improvisers now loosely known as the Downtown Scene.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{members of}} the Beat Generation used {{a number of different}} drugs, including alcohol, marijuana, benzedrine, morphine, and later psychedelic drugs such as peyote, Ayahuasca, and LSD. They often approached drugs experimentally, initially being unfamiliar with their effects; their drug use was broadly inspired by intellectual interest and many Beat writers felt their drug experiences enhanced creativity, insight or productivity. The use of drugs was a key influence on many of the social events of the time that were personal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Beat</b> generation.|$|E
25|$|In September 2011, anti-nuclear protesters, marching <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beat</b> of drums, “took to {{the streets}} of Tokyo and other cities to mark six months since the March {{earthquake}} and tsunami and vent their anger at the government's handling of the nuclear crisis set off by meltdowns at the Fukushima power plant”. Protesters called for a complete shutdown of Japanese nuclear power plants and demanded a shift in government policy toward alternative sources of energy. Among the protestors were four young men who started a 10-day hunger strike to bring about change in Japan's nuclear policy.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an improved method for simulating and modifying <b>the</b> <b>beating</b> effect in piano tones. <b>The</b> <b>beating</b> effect is an audible phenomenon, which is characteristic <b>to</b> <b>the</b> piano, and, hence, {{it should be}} accounted for in realistic piano synthesis. The proposed method, which is independent of the synthesis technique, contains a cascade of second-order equalizing filters, where each filter produces <b>the</b> <b>beating</b> effect for a single partial by modulating the peak gain. Moreover, the method offers a way <b>to</b> control <b>the</b> <b>beating</b> frequency and <b>the</b> <b>beating</b> depth, {{and it can be}} used <b>to</b> modify <b>the</b> <b>beating</b> envelope in existing tones. The results show that the proposed method is able <b>to</b> simulate <b>the</b> desired <b>beating</b> effect. 1...|$|R

50|$|For the kudamattom, thirty {{elephants}} {{are split}} into two groups of fifteen representing the Thamarakulam Sri Mahaganapathy Temple and the Puthiyakavu Bhagawathy Temple.

25|$|After {{singing the}} opening kriti, usually, the {{performer}} sings the kalpanaswaram of the raga <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beat.</b> The performer must improvise {{a string of}} swaras in any octave {{according to the rules}} of the raga and return to beginning of the cycle of beats smoothly, joining the swaras with a phrase selected from the kriti. The violin performs these alternately with the main performer. In very long strings of swara, the performers must calculate their notes accurately to ensure that they stick to the raga, have no awkward pauses or lapses in the beat of the song, and create a complex pattern of notes that a knowledgeable audience can follow.|$|E
25|$|In {{many forms}} of music, the bass drum is used to mark or keep time. The bass drum makes a low, boom sound when the mallet hits the drumhead. In marches {{it is used to}} project tempo (marching bands {{historically}} march <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beat</b> of the bass). A basic beat for rock and roll has the bass drum played on the first and third beats of a bars of common time, with the snare drum on the second and fourth beats, called back beats. In jazz, the bass drum can vary from almost entirely being a timekeeping medium to being a melodic voice in conjunction with the other parts of the set.|$|E
25|$|The {{music video}} {{features}} {{the members of}} Sakanaction in traditional Japanese clothing and gaudy make-up, {{at the foot of}} Mount Fuji alongside two traditional Japanese dancers. The video is composed of several scenes where the camera's distance grows closer to the performers, showing scenes sequentially closer in time <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beat</b> of the song. While some of these takes were shot in daylight, others were taken in darkness, while the band or Yamaguchi were lit by colored lights. In {{the latter part of the}} video, it is revealed that the view of the band is from the perspective of a high school girl (played by actress and model Yui Miura), who wears binoculars to view the band. The camera then focuses on the girl using the same technique that the band was shot in. The girl finds Yamaguchi performing the song directly in front of her, and finally decides to run away.|$|E
