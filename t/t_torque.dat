The four-bladed ship propeller tested had an overall diameter of 800 mm and maximum hub diameter of 200 mm and profile and sections based on the Wageningen B 4. 40 series. The ability to vary pitch setting was incorporated in the design. The performance tests were conducted at a range of windspeeds between 5 m/s and 20 m/s and propeller revolutions between 600 and 3, 000 rpm. Results are presented in terms of Thrust coefficient(K subscript <b>T),</b> <b>Torque</b> coefficient (K subscript Q) and Efficiency (?) against advance ratio J.

40|$|The {{propeller}} is {{the predominant}} propulsion device used in ships. The performance of propeller is conventionally represented {{in terms of}} non-dimensional coefficients, i. e., thrust coefficient (K <b>T),</b> <b>torque</b> coefficient (K Q) and efficiency and their variation with advance coefficients (J). It {{is difficult to determine}} the characteristics of a full-size propeller in open water by varying the speed of the advance and the revolution rate over a range and measuring the thrust and torque of the propeller. Therefore, recourse is made to experiments with models of the propeller and the ship in which the thrust and torque of the model propeller can be conveniently measured over a range of speed of advance and revolution rate. Experiments are very expensive and time consuming, so the present paper deals with a complete computational solution for the flow using Fluent 6. 3 software. When the operating pressure was lowered below the vapor pressure of surrounding liquid it simulates cavitating condition. In the present work, Fluent 6. 3 software is also used to solve advanced phenomena like cavitation of propeller. The simulation results of cavitation and open water characteristics of propeller are compared with experimental predictions, as obtained from literature [1]...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a systematic design methodology for split hybrid vehicles using a single planetary gearset (PG) as the transmission. The design methodology {{consists of four}} steps: 1) analyze clutch locations on the PG and operation modes, 2) generate dynamic models, 3) evaluate drivability (acceleration performance) via forward simulations, and 4) optimize the fuel economy using the dynamic programming technique. The 1 -PG split hybrid transmission can have 12 configurations, and each configuration can have four operation modes when three clutches are added. This methodology systematically evaluates all configuration candidates and identifies the optimal design, and we demonstrate how it helps to identify a simplified design based in the output-split configuration used by the Chevy Volt. The simplified design, named the Volt-, has {{only two of the}} four operation modes of the original Volt. The Volt- achieves the same fuel economy as the original Volt in the FUDS cycle, and has only slightly reduced drivability and fuel economy in the HWFET cycle. In addition, an improved design based on the input-split configuration used by the Toyota Prius is also identified, named the Prius+, which has one additional mode than the original Prius. The Prius+ outperforms the Prius in both drivability and fuel economy.

Advanced control design can increase the transparency of the haptic device at the haptic interface thereby increasing the realism of the simulation.

The quality of the haptic interface is &quot;rst quanti&quot;ed, and the standard open-loop impedance approach to haptic control is reviewed.
