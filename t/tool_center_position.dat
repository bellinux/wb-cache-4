Two different approaches are described and investigated. The first approach {{is based on the}} model of compliant mechanism of PKM. The second approach is based on the redundant measurement that can replace the stiffness knowledge and force balance computation by pure geometric consideration. These procedures are described on PKM Sliding Star...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Thermal distortions are {{regarded}} as one of major error factors in a machine tool. ISO 230 - 3 describes tests to evaluate the influence of thermal distortions caused by linear motion and spindle rotation on the <b>tool</b> <b>center</b> <b>position</b> (TCP). No test is described in these standards on the thermal influence of a rotary axis. Furthermore, conventional thermal tests only measure thermal influence on the positioning error at a single point, not error motions of an axis. This paper proposes a method to calibrate thermal influence on error motions of rotary axes in five-axis kinematics by the static R-test. The R-test measurement clarifies how error motions of a rotary table changes with the rotation of a swiveling axis, and how error motions are influenced by thermal changes. Experimental demonstration will be presented...|$|E

To {{solve the}} five-axis {{machining}} accuracy problems that caused by assembly precision and direction error of rotary axes of inclinable head in high precision five axis machine tool. By selecting the five axis machine tool with inclinable head AB, GMC 1230 u, as the research object and analyzing {{the causes of}} the inclinable head error, the kinematics relationship of the rotation <b>center</b> <b>position</b> error and axis tilt error is established. By that, the direction vectors of each rotation axis and the position vector of rotation center are calculated based on the regression analysis of on-line measurement of the <b>tool</b> <b>center</b> point <b>position</b> and the calibration of five-axis RTCP function parameters is also accomplished. Finally, the compensation for inclinable head error in five-axis machine tools is fulfilled efficiently and remarkable improvement of RTCP machining accuracy is achieved...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe paper {{presents}} {{a method to}} evaluate the effect of servo-error, quasi-static geometric error and dynamic geometric error on volumetric errors at the <b>tool</b> <b>center</b> point under high speed and high dynamic load. The interpolator output signals and the machine encoder signals are recorded and compared to evaluate the contouring errors resulting from each axis follow-up error. The machine encoder signals are also compared to the actual <b>tool</b> <b>center</b> point <b>position</b> as recorded with an in-house non-contact measuring instrument to evaluate the total geometric errors. A method is proposed to decompose the geometric errors in two categories: the quasi-static geometric errors independent from the speed and the dynamic geometric errors, dependent on the programmed feed rate and resulting from the machine structure deflection during the acceleration of its axes. The evolution of the respective contributions of contouring error, quasi-static geometric error and dynamic geometric error is evaluated and a relation between programmed feed rate and dynamic error is highlighted...|$|R

40|$|Novel {{functional}} {{materials in}} the field of machine tools such as shape memory alloys are capable to convert thermal energy into mechanical energy by generating work. Besides, their self-sensing properties and high energy density make them suitable to compensate thermal deformations. Manufacturing requirements concerning machine <b>tools</b> and machining <b>centers</b> can be summarized in a high productivity, a high reliability (low-maintenance) and a high accuracy/precision. The latter machine design parameter depends almost on linear drive systems, which are responsible for the relative distance between workpiece and <b>tool</b> <b>center</b> point. Their <b>positioning</b> performance is limited, among others, to changes in thermal conditions; even with cooling systems that represent about 90 % of the overall energy consumption of the machine. Therefore, thermal errors in machine tools are currently an issue to overcome. Within the scope of this work, shape memory alloys have been integrated in ball screw drives in order to achieve a thermal stable machine transmission component...|$|R
40|$|Many {{industrial}} robot applications require fewer task constraints than the robot’s degrees of freedom. For welding robots, for example, rotations of the welding torch around its axis do not negatively impact welding quality. Furthermore, the <b>tool</b> <b>center</b> point’s Cartesian <b>position</b> and desired orientation {{as a function}} of time is often determined by the (manufacturing) process. Nevertheless, programming these robots can be time consuming. Reducing or eliminating this programming cost will allow robots to be used for producing small series. Recently, a promising software package for Cartesian path planning with the name Descartes was released by the ROS-Industrial community. To the authors’ knowledge, an in-depth description of this algorithm and an experimental evaluation is lacking in literature. This paper describes the path planning approach used by the Descartes package. Moreover, the software’s performance is evaluated for several robot welding tasks and the encountered limitations are discussed. In addition, we showed that the planner’s performance can be improved by changing the cost function that the planner’s graph search algorithm minimises. status: accepte...|$|R
