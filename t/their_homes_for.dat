5|$|In Mexico, {{effects were}} mostly related to rainfall; up to 16inches (400mm) fell in some areas. When Fay flooded {{areas such as}} Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas, 100families were {{evacuated}} from their homes, and 120people were stranded in hotels. It is reported that in that town, 10trees fell causing little or no damage. Also, the Rio Grande flooded its banks to 3.3meters (10ft) above flood stage. It is reported that 300families {{were not able to}} return to <b>their</b> <b>homes</b> <b>for</b> several weeks {{as a result of the}} flooding.|$|E
5|$|Tamarod is {{reported}} to have gained popularity among the opposition since mid-July, prompting the United States Embassy in Manama to eventually issue a warning for U.S. citizens to avoid certain areas in Bahrain on 14 August. The selected areas were mostly opposition strongholds. For weeks, the government was reported to have intensified its house raids and arrests against over five hundred wanted activists, many of them sleeping outside <b>their</b> <b>homes</b> <b>for</b> months in anticipation of such raids.|$|E
5|$|In Tampico, {{near the}} {{location}} of the storm's second landfall, the streets were littered with fallen trees branches, utility poles, and billboards. Additionally, many roads were inundated with water, leaving some impassable. Nearby, over 700people fled <b>their</b> <b>homes</b> <b>for</b> shelter due to flooding in Ciudad Madero. One death occurred in Pueblo Viejo when a woman was crushed by a tree that fell on her house. Six other deaths occurred in Veracruz, five from a ship capsizing near Boca del Río and another after a person was caught in an undertow offshore Úrsulo Galván. Two landslides in northern Puebla left roads impassable, isolating some communities such as Tlatlauquitepec. Hundreds of homes were destroyed leaving 35,000people homeless and there was severe damage in Tuxpan, Tamiahua, Pueblo Viejo, Platon, Pánuco, Tampico Alto, and elsewhere along the coast of northeast Mexico.|$|E

5|$|The IMD issued {{warnings}} {{related to}} the cyclone that were distributed to the public by television, telegraph, news outlets, and other government departments. The All India Radio broadcast warnings beginning on November5, the day before landfall. Train service was disrupted throughout Andhra Pradesh, stranding thousands of travelers. India's Oil and Natural Gas Corporation suspended operations during the storm. The storm caused local Diwali festivities to be canceled. It ultimately struck about 50km (30mi) north of where it was expected, in a region farther away from state shelters. About 225,000families evacuated due to the storm. However, about 30% of the towns in the region lacked a storm shelter, and the existing shelters were generally in poor shape. Some residents avoided the shelters due to their state of disrepair, or stayed in <b>their</b> <b>homes</b> <b>for</b> fear they would be robbed. In addition, storm emergency plans enacted after a cyclone in 1977 that struck Andhra Pradesh had not been used since 1986. Roads and shelters built following a cyclone in 1990 fared the storm better than older structures.|$|E
5|$|The {{settlement}} at {{the mouth}} of the Plum River was established in 1827 when copper was discovered near the Mississippi River. When the Black Hawk War erupted in 1832, the settlement at Plum River consisted of 25 people. When the settlers were informed of Black Hawk's invasion they were undecided about whether or not to abandon <b>their</b> <b>homes</b> <b>for</b> safer grounds in Galena, Illinois. In the end, while nearby towns such as Hanover emptied of their residents, the citizens at Plum River decided to send the women and children to Galena and leave the men to stick it out on the frontier. They partially disassembled two of the settlement's homes and constructed a blockhouse for protection. Left to defend the impromptu fortifications were Aaron Pierce, Vance Davidson, Robert Upton, William Blundell, Leonard Goss and a man known as Hays. On May 19 another group of militia volunteers were ambushed at Buffalo Grove and two days later the more famous Indian Creek massacre occurred (on the same day as the raid at Plum River).|$|E
5|$|Upon {{news of the}} storm, {{businesses}} in West Palm Beach boarded up vulnerable, expensive plate glass windows. Fearing flooding, authorities were empowered by Florida governor David Sholtz to evacuate over 4,200–5,000 residents, {{most of whom were}} black farm workers, from low-lying areas around Lake Okeechobee to elevated locations. Most of the evacuees left by train, prompted by fears of washouts on the track beds. Aday before the storm, the lake level reached , heightening officials' concerns about flooding and spurring the evacuations. Several railway companies lent free transport to their passengers, and trains were conveniently stationed around the lake. The evacuations took place in the communities of Belle Glade, Pahokee, Canal Point, Okeechobee, and Clewiston. Relief organizations and local mayors distributed milk, biscuits, and coffee to evacuees. On the west coast of the state, some residents covered their windows, but many others did not, anticipating little damage from the weak storm. Citizens received radio updates from the Weather Bureau, which gave the position and movement of the storm. Some beachfront residents, such as in Sarasota, left <b>their</b> <b>homes</b> <b>for</b> safety, while boaters secured their vessels.|$|E

25|$|A {{smallpox}} {{epidemic in}} 1762 caused {{the deaths of}} 5,300 and depopulated some of the mission communities. After the missions were handed over to regular clergy in 1771, the indigenous population of five communities abandoned <b>their</b> <b>homes</b> <b>for</b> the mountains because of abuses and inability to understand the new priests.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of the flood, the {{population}} of Vanport was down to about 18,500people. Because of the holiday, many residents were away from <b>their</b> <b>homes</b> <b>for</b> the day.

25|$|Because {{the storm}} {{regenerated}} shortly {{before it was}} predicted to make landfall, few advanced preparations for the storm were taken in Honduras. However, constant rainfall {{for well over a}} day as Gamma wandered offshore caused floods that forced over 30,000 people to abandon <b>their</b> <b>homes</b> <b>for</b> state-run shelters.|$|E
25|$|In Singapore, {{people would}} pray to ghosts/Spirits or {{ancestors}} with offerings and fruits outside <b>their</b> <b>homes</b> <b>for</b> {{the start of}} the 7th month. Most patriotic events were held on 7th Month for Singapore, which includes general and presidential elections, the Olympics and the National Day Parade. This is where the number of outings were minimised.|$|E
25|$|Moreover, {{evidence}} shows that because homeowners would allegedly keep <b>their</b> <b>homes</b> <b>for</b> longer, young households often rent for longer before buying a house. Because Proposition 13 could be a disincentive to sell, there is less turnover among owners near the older downtown areas, resulting in an upward pressure on price appreciation in these areas.|$|E

The legislation would grant the Federal Communications Commission the authority to authorize a technology known as the broadcast flag.

25|$|Greenwood Furnace {{became a}} ghost town in the early 20th century. Changes in the iron {{industry}} lead to {{the closing of the}} now obsolete furnaces.

At that time they visited the Europeans at Columbus, Mississippi; Macon, Brooksville, and Crawford, and the region where Yazoo City now is located.|$|E
25|$|In {{the setting}} up of creameries the {{cooperative}} movement experienced its greatest success. Plunkett got farmers to join together to establish units to process and market their own butter, milk and cheese to standards {{suitable for the}} profitable British market, rather than producing unhygienic, poor-quality output in <b>their</b> <b>homes</b> <b>for</b> local traders. This enabled farmers to deal directly with companies established by themselves, which guaranteed fair prices without middlemen absorbing the profits.|$|E
25|$|Also, as {{real estate}} prices and {{neighborhood}} pressure increased to move these {{people out of their}} areas, the SROs diminished in number, putting most of their residents in the streets. Other populations were mixed in later, such as people losing <b>their</b> <b>homes</b> <b>for</b> economic reasons, and those with addictions, the elderly, and others. Trends in homelessness are closely tied to neighborhood conditions {{according to a report by}} the Edna McConnell Clark Foundation in 1990.|$|E
