40|$|This article shows which {{additional}} analysis {{options are}} available {{within the framework}} of model-based macroeconomic analyses using structural information provided <b>by</b> <b>tourism</b> <b>satellite</b> accounts (TSAs). Based on their modular, product-spe-cific documentation of results, TSAs provide optimal linkages to input–output models. In addition {{to the use of the}} simple input–output approaches, dynamically formulated macroeconomic structural models should be considered. After a brief characterization of the main demands placed on a macroeconomic model, the dynamic macroeconomic forecasting and sim-ulation model for the German economy, Interindustry Forecasting Germany (INFORGE), is presented. Against the back-ground of Germany being able to increase its market share in international tourism over the next several years, the corresponding scenario is elaborated in more specific terms using TSA results.
