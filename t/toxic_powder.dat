50|$|Ebony, when {{ground into}} fine dust (for example, during sawing), {{results in a}} {{flammable}} and <b>toxic</b> <b>powder</b> which can float about in air for several days. Due to the high toxicity of ebony in powdered form, its use in construction work requires government certification in several South Asian countries.|$|E
40|$|The {{standards}} for the determination of safety characteristics of powders have been defined more than 30 years ago. Today, they are well established and have proven their feasibility and practical applicability in industrial practice. However {{with the appearance of}} an increasing number of powders with high physiological activities (e. g. from pharmaceutical production) and with the development of nano-powders with yet unknown health hazards, the traditional testing methods have to be modified to meet the increasing requirements of industrial hygiene, because these testing methods often involve open handling of the test items. Within the EU project NANOSAFE the Swiss Safety Institute in Basel has developed a number of such new test procedures and has validated them against the existing standards. 1. Basic Principle The following basic principle is applied to achieve a high degree of protection of lab technicians against exposure to potentially <b>toxic</b> <b>powder.</b> Open handling of the powders is limited to the transfer of the powder from the shipping container (e. g. the powder flask) either to- the container, in which the test is carried out later or- an intermediate container, from which the sample can be transferred into the tes...|$|E
50|$|To {{facilitate}} donning of gloves, powders {{have been}} used as lubricants. Early powders derived from pines or club moss were found to be <b>toxic.</b> Talcum <b>powder</b> was used for decades but linked to postoperative granuloma and scar formation. Corn starch, another agent used as lubricant, was also found to have potential side effects such as inflammatory reactions and granuloma and scar formation.|$|R
40|$|The Powdered Activated Carbon TreatmentTM (PACTTM) process {{consists}} of powdered activated carbon {{addition to the}} activated sludge treatment process. Objectives were (1) to compare treatment of kraft pulp mill wastewater using activated sludge versus PACTTM, by measuring toxicity, organic load, adsorbable organic halides (AOX) and metals and (2) to assess how three operating conditions: (1) carbon dose; (2) hydraulic retention time; (3) solids retention time, affected performance. Findings were: (1) Lengthy hydraulic retention times are unnecessary. Short hydraulic retention times (4 h) provide adequate treatment. (2) Activated sludge treatment alone removes most biochemical oxygen demand, PACTTM offers no improvement. PACTTM improves removal of soluble chemical oxygen demand. PACTTM improves removal of AOX. Powdered activated carbon dose is the sole determinant of this increased removal. (3) Activated sludge treatment alone removes MicrotoxTM toxicity. PACTTM slightly improves treatment of highly toxic wastewaters. Significant chronic toxicity towards Ceriodaphnia remains in effluents from both activated sludge and PACTTM. Both treatments remove toxicity to Ceriodaphnia, but PACTTM effluents are more <b>toxic.</b> <b>Powdered</b> activated carbon alone exhibits toxicity to Ceriodaphnia. (4) The effect of PACTTM on removal of metals is inconclusive. (5) PACTTM treatment of kraft mill wastewater would be very expensive. (6) PACTTM has limited benefits over activated sludge {{for the treatment of}} kraft mill wastewater, therefore PACTTM is not recommended for treatment of kraft mill wastewater...|$|R
50|$|Mercury(II) cyanide, {{also known}} as mercuric cyanide, is a {{coordination}} compound of nitrogen, carbon and mercury. It is a colorless, odorless, <b>toxic</b> white <b>powder</b> with a bitter metallic taste. It has a melting point of , at which it decomposes and releases toxic mercury fumes. It is highly soluble in polar solvents such as water, alcohol, and ammonia; slightly soluble in ether; and insoluble in benzene and other hydrophobic solvents. It rapidly decomposes in acid to give off hydrogen cyanide. Samples also decompose when exposed to light, becoming darker in color. It reacts vigorously with oxidizing agents; fusion with metal chlorates, perchlorates, nitrates, or nitrites can cause a violent explosion.|$|R
50|$|In 1970 Pietro Annigoni (Florence) Italy {{showed her}} ancient {{techniques}} in oil painting like {{the preparation of}} egg tempera, and explained the use of flake white, even when this is a toxic material, but because, he said, it would strengthen underlying first coats of her paint. His recipes including the white <b>toxic</b> lead <b>powder</b> improved the adherence of her paint and reduced the process of darkening and getting yellow with time. In the 90s Jesus Peñarreal equally showed the value of thin layers of glaze, which flake white allowed to paint. Peñarreal then sent Heijermans to study the Spanish impressionist painter Joaquín Sorolla y Bastida in the Museu de Belles Arts de València where students can draw.|$|R
25|$|Paris green (copper(II) acetate triarsenite or copper(II) acetoarsenite) is an {{inorganic}} compound. It is {{a highly}} <b>toxic</b> emerald-green crystalline <b>powder</b> {{that has been used}} as a rodenticide and insecticide, and also as a pigment, despite its toxicity. It is also used as a blue colorant for fireworks. The color of Paris green is said to range from a pale blue green when very finely ground, to a deeper green when coarsely ground.|$|R
40|$|Nanomaterials have {{properties}} {{that are often}} very different from normal materials made of the same substance, {{which can be used}} to create novel products with exciting properties. However, the health and environmental impact of these nanomaterials is also changed and their potential risk needs to be studied. There is evidence that some nanomaterials can pass through tissue barriers (including the blood-brain barrier) and cell membranes. This is interesting for medical applications, but it raises concerns about the impact of non-medical nanomaterials. Current research aims at better coordinating research efforts and at better communication between researchers and involved stakeholders. Many research labs and production sites currently follow strategies that were established for dealing with very <b>toxic</b> chemicals and <b>powders,</b> until future research in this field helps identify the appropriate level of protection. All these efforts will ultimately ensure a safe, healthy and environmental friendly production, use and disposal of nanomaterials...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study, <b>toxic</b> effects of <b>powder</b> of seeds of Butea monosperma (Linn.) Kuntze were {{evaluated}} {{for a period}} of 3 months in albino rats. Control group received distilled water. The powder suspension was orally given to the treated group at a dose of 800 mg/kg/day for 90 days. Parameters like body weight, weight of important organs, biochemical, hematological parameters, bone marrow cytology and histopathology of vital organs were studied. Test drug administration did not affect the body weight, organ weight and bone marrow cytology to a significant extent. Among the 18 hematological parameters studied, significant changes were observed in three parameters, namely, significant decrease in hemoglobin content, red blood cell count and hematocrit. Of 16 biochemical parameters studied, significant changes were observed in 5 parameters, namely, decrease in total protein, albumin, bilirubin and significant increase in very low density lipoprotein and triglyceride. The histopathology of 18 organs revealed changes such as fatty changes, glomerular congestion and tubular hemorrhage in the kidneys, decrease in the cellularity of the spleen, epithelial disruption in jejunum, decrease in spermatogenesis in the testis, epithelial proliferation in ventral prostate and decrease in epithelial proliferation in the uterus. Thus, toxicity profile obtained from the present study shows that B. monosperma seeds are likely to produce toxic effect when administered in a powder form...|$|R
40|$|Microbial {{biosynthesis}} {{of metal}} nanoparticles as needed in catalysis has shown its theoretical ability as an extremely environmentally friendly production method {{in the last}} few years, even though the separation of the nanoparticles is challenging. Biosynthesis, summing up biosorption and bioreduction of diluted metal ions to zero valent metals, is especially ecofriendly, when the bioreactor itself is harmless and needs no further harmful reagents. The cyanobacterium Anabaena cylindrica (SAG 1403. 2) is able to form crystalline Au 0 -nanoparticles from Au 3 + ions and does not release <b>toxic</b> anatoxin-a. X-ray <b>powder</b> diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) are applied to monitor the time-dependent development of gold nanoparticles for up to 40 hours. Some vegetative cells (VC) are filled with nanoparticles within minutes, while the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) of vegetative cells and the heterocyst polysaccharide layer (HEP) are the regions, where the first nanoparticles are detected on most other cells. The uptake of gold starts immediately after incubation and within four hours the average size remains constant around 10 nm. Analyzing the TEM images with an image processing program reveals a wide distribution for the diameter of the nanoparticles at all times and in all regions of the cyanobacteria. Finally, the nanoparticle concentration in vegetative cells of Anabaena cylindrica is about 50 % higher than in heterocysts (HC). These nanoparticles are found to be located along the thylakoid membranes...|$|R
40|$|DISTRIBUTION: G. burchelli occurs {{more or less}} in {{the eastern}} half of the country and in the Western Cape, while G. polycephala {{is to be found in}} the drier parts of the Karoo and the Northern Cape province. BOTANICAL DESCRIPTION: Gnidia burchellii: A woody, much-branched shrublet ± 1 m high. The {{branches}} have a reddish-brown bark. Just under the bark are some fine silvery silky threads, which are exposed when a twig is snapped and the bark pulled away from the wood. This helps to identify the plant. The leaves are carried mainly at the upper ends of the branch and distinct scars remain when they drop. The flowers are yellow, tubular and carried in dense clusters at the ends of the branches. The fruit is small, 1 -chambered and contains a single seed. Gnidia polycephala: A perennial with a strong taproot. Much-branched from the base and forms a densely tufted bush ± 50 cm high. The grey-green stems have few side branches and bear leaves only in the young stages. Small, dense heads of flowers subtended by broad papery bracts are borne at the ends of the branches. The flowers are tubular, yellow and hairy on the outside. The fruit is covered with plumes of long, silvery hairs, is 1 -chambered and contains a single seed. TOXIC PRINCIPLE: Esters of the diterpenoid phorbol, similar to daphnetoxin. TOXICITY: • Relatively <b>toxic.</b> • <b>Powdered</b> plant irritating on skin and mucous membranes.

40|$|Forget {{about any}} barbequing. Taiwan is just {{beginning}} to recover from one of the worst typhoons in recent memory. Super Typhoon Sinlaku spent the entire weekend over the island, meandering up the east coast, doing a loop-de-loop around Yilan, moving northwest and doing a second loop-de-loop around Danshui, before taking another jaunt to the west and finally traipsing off to the northeast. Mountain areas have been inundated with between 3 AND 5 FEET OF RAIN, resulting in numerous casualties (7 dead and 14 missing so far) and catastrophic damage (bridges washed out, riverside hotels toppled or swept away, crops destroyed, etc.) And, as if that weren’t bad enough, there is also the possibility that some of ourmooncakes may have been contaminated with melamine (三聚氰胺). While the typhoon was wreaking its dreadful havoc, Department of Health inspectors were launching a frantic search among retailers whose operations spanned nine cities and counties, due to fears that a total of 1, 000 25 -kilogram sacks of potentially <b>toxic</b> milk <b>powder</b> imported from China’s Sanlu Group may have been used in locally processed or packaged foods. According to Chinese health ministry officials, while none of the contaminated milk powder was “exported to other countries or regions”, some was sold to Taiwan (referred to by the aforementioned officials as “a region of China” or 我國台灣地區). To make matters worse, the Taiwan government does not test Chinese food imports for melamine, and current estimates indicate that over 1, 200 kilograms of the stuff has already found its way into consumers’ bellies. The government has now banned all imports of Sanlu dairy products. Taiwan’s food scare is nothing compared to the terrors Chinese parents are facing, however. Melamine-tainted infant formula produced by Sanlu has already been blamed for the deaths of at least two infants, and over 1, 200 children have fallen ill; some 340 are still hospitalized, with 53 listed in serious condition. To make matters worse, the company may have known of these problems many months ago, with New Zealand dairy giant Fonterra (which owns a 43 % stake in Sanlu) claiming that it had called on its joint venture partner to recall its tainted productweeks before adequate action was taken. Some newspapers (including The China Times 中國時報) are even claiming that the story was kept under wraps in order toavoid a loss of face during the Olympics. The facts have yet to be determined, but it is absolutely gut wrenching to watch suffering babies and their heartbroken parents. Be it the financial crisis in the U. S., or the food products scandals in China, once the government gives the wolves responsibility for protecting the flock, it is always the innocent lambs who suffer...|$|R
