25|$|Southover Grange is a grade II* listed Tudor {{manor house}} built in 1572 with Caen {{limestone}} {{taken from the}} ruins of Lewes Priory. The house and its gardens were bought by Lewes District Council and {{opened to the public}} in 1945. The house is now owned by East Sussex County Council, and it is currently being refurbished into a wedding venue, registry office and community facility. The east wing is leased to an art shop and The Window café (open in spring and summer). The Grange gardens are divided by the Winterbourne stream and contain formal bedding displays, a wildflower area, a knot garden and some notable trees, including a large Magnolia grandiflora, a mulberry tree dating perhaps to the seventeenth century and a <b>tulip</b> <b>tree</b> planted by Queen Elizabeth II. The gardens {{are open to the public}} during daylight hours all year round.|$|E
25|$|The same goes, mutatis mutandis, for the (former) genera Talauma and Dugandiodendron, {{which are}} then placed in {{subgenus}} Magnolia, and genus Manglietia, which could be joined with subgenus Magnolia or may even earn the status of an extra subgenus. Elmerrillia seems to be closely related to Michelia and Yulania, in which case it {{will most likely be}} treated {{in the same way as}} Michelia is now. The precise nomenclatural status of small or monospecific genera like Kmeria, Parakmeria, Pachylarnax, Manglietiastrum, Aromadendron, Woonyoungia, Alcimandra, Paramichelia and Tsoongiodendron remains uncertain. Taxonomists who merge Michelia into Magnolia tend to merge these small genera into Magnolia s.l. as well. Botanists do not yet agree on whether to recognize a big Magnolia genus or the different small genera. For example, Flora of China offers two choices: a large Magnolia which includes about 300 species, everything in the Magnoliaceae except Liriodendron (<b>tulip</b> <b>tree),</b> or 16 different genera, some of them recently split out or re-recognized, each of which contains up to 50 species. The western co-author favors the big Magnolia genus, whereas the Chinese recognize the different small genera.|$|E

5000|$|The Magnoliaceae [...] are a {{flowering}} plant family, the magnolia family, {{in the order}} Magnoliales.

2500|$|Liriodendron tulipifera—known as the <b>tulip</b> <b>tree,</b> American <b>tulip</b> <b>tree,</b> tuliptree, tulip poplar, whitewood, fiddletree, and yellow-poplar—is the Western Hemisphere {{representative}} of the two-species genus Liriodendron, and the tallest eastern hardwood. It is native to eastern North America from Southern Ontario and Illinois eastward to southeastern Massachusetts and Rhode Island, and south to central Florida and Louisiana. It can grow to more than [...] in virgin cove forests of the Appalachian Mountains, often with no limbs until it reaches [...] in height, making it a very valuable timber tree. It is fast-growing, without the common problems of weak wood strength and short lifespan often seen in fast-growing species. April marks {{the start of the}} flowering period in the southern USA (except as noted below); trees at the northern limit of cultivation begin to flower in June. The flowers are pale green or yellow (rarely white), with an orange band on the tepals; they yield large quantities of nectar.

2500|$|<b>Tulip</b> <b>trees</b> make magnificently shaped {{specimen}} trees, and {{are very}} large, growing to about [...] in good soil. They grow best in deep well-drained loam which has thick dark topsoil. They show stronger response to fertilizer compounds (those with low salt index are preferred) than most other trees, but soil structure and organic matter content are more important. In the wild it is occasionally seen around serpentine outcrops. The southeastern coastal plain and east central Florida ecotypes occur in wet but not stagnant soils which are high in organic matter. All <b>tulip</b> <b>trees</b> are unreliable in clay flats which are subject to ponding and flooding. Like {{other members of the}} Magnolia family, they have fleshy roots that are easily broken if handled roughly. Transplanting should be done in early spring, before leaf-out; this timing is especially important in the more northern areas. Fall planting is often successful in Florida. The east central Florida ecotype may be more easily moved than other strains because its roots grow over nine or ten months every year—several months longer than other ecotypes. Most <b>tulip</b> <b>trees</b> have low tolerance of drought, although Florida natives (especially the east central ecotype) fare better than southeastern coastal plain or northern inland specimens.|$|R
