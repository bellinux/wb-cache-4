40|$|In current times, with {{business}} as {{the focal point}} of society in which economic strain is prevalent, {{it is important to be}} able to investigate the dysfunction and deviance that can arise as a result, since their effects will be felt in all aspects of modern social life. Upon this assumption, the current research investigates the influence of business crime, with a specific focus on the offences committed by businesses against their workforce over employment legislation. <b>This</b> <b>research</b> <b>is</b> <b>delimited</b> to companies of the third sector of the economy, commerce and financial services in particular. Entrepreneurship, business practice, employment legislation, the regulatory system and economic strain and crisis are all examined in order to investigate the phenomenon in Greece. The fieldwork consists of secondary statistical analysis of reports from the relevant regulatory offices and qualitative interviews with four target groups: employees who are victims of business crime at the work place, inspectors, trade union members and business managers and owners. The analysis follows a macro-meso-micro focus of analysis in order to provide a spherical illustration of all factors influencing deviance. Power imbalances within the capitalist system of production influencing social structures and imbalances in relevant relations of agency agents and the state, community and society are significant analytical elements of business deviance. Unpaid enforced overtime and illegal employment constitute the two prevailing offences and create a work environment of insecurity and informality. Structural factors like state-promoted entrepreneurship, changes in legislation, decreased collectivity and economic strain play an important role as do low reporting and conviction rates. The role of the state is a key element linking the levels of analysis and its further functions are instrumental in shaping legislation, systems of control, and perceptions of harm and impact of crime. Additionally, the state can act as a facilitator to deviance by participation in criminality for profit. The conclusions of this study can enhance an interest in business crime, modern criminological research in Greece and can additionally inform policy and practice.

O foco escolhido para an?lise foi uma escola da Secretaria Municipal de Educa??o de Manaus, no Estado do Amazonas. O contexto desta pesquisa est? delimitado pelas a??es da pol?tica p?blica de educa??o brasileira, influenciadas/acordadas pelas pol?ticas neoliberais na escola comum. A Pol?tica Nacional de Educa??o Especial na Perspectiva Inclusiva de 2008, pelo Decreto n? 6. 571 / 08 e a Resolu??o n? 04 / 2009, efetivou o Atendimento Educacional Especializado na Sala de Recurso Multifuncional da escola comum. Sua implementa??o suscitou o interesse nesta pesquisa, com maior especificidade em identificar de que maneira ? desenvolvido o Atendimento Educacional Especializado na Sala de Recurso Multifuncional, com vistas ? autonomia e independ?ncia do aluno. Buscou-se verificar se os recursos pedag?gicos e de acessibilidade da escola est?o articulados com as Diretrizes da Pol?tica Nacional Inclusiva. Nesta pesquisa social, de abordagem te?rico-pr?tica, com base no estudo de v?rios autores, como Bauman (2007), Kumar (1997), Carvalho (1999, 2007), Mantoan (2006, 2010), Manzini (2008), Wallon (1968) e outros, optou-se pelo m?todo dial?tico de estudo de caso com abordagem qualitativa, classificada em explorat?ria e descritiva. Os procedimentos se constitu?ram em pesquisa bibliogr?fica, documental e de campo. Os instrumentos de coleta de dados foram: entrevista despadronizada e observa??o de campo. A partir da an?lise dos dados, concluiu-se que o Atendimento Educacional Especializado j? come?ou a acontecer na escola comum como direito, por meio da determina??o de alguns professores, gestores e coordenadores que acreditam na possibilidade de a concep??o inclusiva educacional vir a se efetivar no munic?pio de Manaus. Nesse cen?rio de globaliza??o econ?mica, o Estado n?o tem assegurado o direito ao Atendimento Educacional Especializado, concretizado nas muitas dificuldades pedag?gicas, de acessibilidade e de recursos pedag?gicos encontradas in loco. Assim, mostram-se necess?rias novas discuss?es, pesquisas, press?es sociais e educacionais ao pr?prio Estado para que o direito ao atendimento educacional se solidifique no Munic?pio de Manaus. The {{object of}} this {{investigation}} is to study Education Public Policy in the Municipality of Manaus: the special classes in school organization. The focus selected for analysis was a school of the City Department of Education of Manaus, in Amazonas state. The context of <b>this</b> <b>research</b> <b>is</b> <b>delimited</b> {{by the actions of}} public education policy in Brazil, influenced/agreed by neoliberal policies in regular schools. The National Policy on Special Education in an Inclusive Perspective of 2008, established by the Decree No. 6. 571 / 08 and the Resolution No. 04 / 09, effected the specialized education in the Multifunctional Resource Room of common schools. This implementation evoked the interest of this research, specifically to identify how specialized educational services are developed in the resource room, aiming at students autonomy and independence. The study sought to ensure whether the school s accessibility and learning resources are articulated with the Inclusive National Policy Guidelines. In this social research, with theoretical and practical approach, based on the study of several authors, such as Bauman (2007), Kumar (1997), Carvalho (1999, 2007), Mantoan (2006, 2010), Manzini (2008), Wallonia (1968) and others, we chose the dialectical method and case study with a qualitative approach, classified as exploratory and descriptive. The procedures constituted bibliographical, documental and field researches. The instruments of data collection were: patternless interview and field observation. From the data analysis, we have concluded that the specialized educational services have begun to happen in regular schools as a right, through the determination of some teachers, managers and engineers who believe in the possibility of designing inclusive education to be effective in the city of Manaus. In this economic globalization scenario, the State has not guaranteed the right to specialized educational services, present in the many pedagogical, accessibility and educational resources difficulties found in loco. Thus, further discussions, researches, educational and social pressures are necessary, in order to the right to educational services to be solidified by the State in the city of Manaus...|$|E

The majority of subjects were tested to enter the Ball State University Adult Physical Fitness Program. These subjects were tested using the BSU/Bruce Ramp protocol between 1992 and 1998. Multiple regression showed gender had a positive association upon submaximal SBP values. Gender's association with heart rate was negative between minute 3 - 6 and positive between minute 6 - 9. Age only had an association upon submaximal heart rate, which was negative. Cardiorespiratory fitness had a negative association upon SBP between minute 6 - 9 and a negative association with heart rate between minute 3 - 6. SBP increased 6. 6 ± 4. 4 and 6. 0 ± 4. 2 mmHg/MET between minute 3 - 6 for men and women, respectively. Analysis of variance demonstrated gender was not statistically significant between minute 3 - 6. SBP increased 4. 7 ± 3. 1 and 3. 8 + 2. 7 mmHg/MET between minute 6 - 9 for men and women, respectively. Gender was statisticallysignificant between minute 6 - 9 (p<. 05). Heart rate increased 8. 5 + 2. 3 and 10. 7 + 3. 3 bpm/MET between minute 3 - 6 for men and women, respectively. Analysis of variance demonstrated gender was statistically significant between minute 3 - 6 (p<. 05). The increase was 9. 5 + 2. 3 and 9. 2 + 2. 7 bpm/MET between minute 6 - 9 for men and women, respectively. Gender was not statistically significant between minute 6 - 9.

Adotamos a perspectiva teÃrica de que o fenÃmeno pesquisado situa-se na atividade discursiva de referenciaÃÃo, concebida como uma (re) construÃÃo do real, advinda da interaÃÃo entre os falantes, de forma intersubjetiva. Propomos uma classificaÃÃo das possÃveis funÃÃes assumidas pelas recategorizaÃÃes nos diferentes contextos discursivos. Para tal fim, abordamos, inicialmente, a proposta classificatÃria de Cavalcante (2003) dos processos referenciais, entre os quais estÃo inseridas as recategorizaÃÃes. A partir disso, retomamos a anÃlise pioneira de ApothÃloz e Reichler-BÃguelin (1995) sobre as recategorizaÃÃes, bem como discutimos os trabalhos de Tavares (2003) e de Lima (2003), que se baseiam nos dois autores.

40|$|The aims of <b>this</b> <b>research</b> project {{address the}} question: Is there any harm in looking? As {{the author and}} viewer, I am {{interested}} in {{what happens to the}} subject as other through the production of imagery. With a background in documentary and television post-production my working life involves the looking at imagery, my lens-based research practice, however, explores {{the question of how to}} look at imagery, both ethically and ontologically. The locus of <b>this</b> <b>research</b> project <b>is</b> <b>delimited</b> by a close consideration of the zoo as enclosure. The zoo is a human-designed looking institution where the animal is confined and put on view. Through examining the zoo as an institution of looking I have produced an analysis of the anthropocentric hegemony in authoring the story of the animal. <b>This</b> <b>research</b> into the human and non-human animal relationship has provided me with a microcosm of my interest in the dynamics of the author/viewer and the subject/other in film and video practice. The preliminary frame of the research draws on Susan Sontag’s Regarding the Pain of Others (2004) in order to address to the ethics of representation and provide an understanding of how a power dynamic forms in the act of looking. As my research developed the zoo’s barriers began to provide pertinent metaphors for discussing the ambivalence of the human’s ontology in relation to the non-human animal. In On Touching − The Inhuman That Therefore I am (2012) Karen Barad relates the act of touching to quantum field theory. She explores the interstitial space between the self and the other in her analysis of the self-touching electrons. Barad’s troubling in the interstitial space of human ontology enables a questioning of the barrier that delimits the human/animal binary. I then applied these questions through a consideration of Jacques Derrida’s The Animal That Therefore I am (2008) in which Derrida deconstructs the ontological limits that define the human and the non-human animal.

Growing evidence suggests a likely trend that residents living in high walkable neighbourhoods tend to accumulate more physical activity and may have lower obesity levels than those living in low walkable areas, although much of <b>this</b> <b>research</b> has <b>been</b> <b>delimited</b> to Western populations, predominantly on adults, and from low or medium density cities. The influence of neighborhood walkability on Asian adolescents, especially in ultra-high density cities is largely unknown. The main aims of this study were to examine if neighborhood walkability is associated with i) various levels of objectively-measured PA, ii) different patterns of how PA is accrued, and iii) if body fat is associated with these levels of PA. METHODS: A convenience sample of 188 adolescents (mean= 15. 3 ± 2. 2 SD years) was recruited using an intercept method from 32 neighbourhoods in Hong Kong that varied in socio-economic status (High v Low mean household income) and objectively-measured walkability (High v Low street connectivity and dwelling density). Actigraph accelerometers were used to measure daily PA (at least 5 days with > 10 hr/d); body fat was estimated from triceps skinfold thickness, waist circumference, as well as a validated portable bio-electrical impedance analysis (BIA, Tanita) system. A total of 69 adolescents provided complete data for the final analysis. RESULTS: No significant difference was found in total PA between adolescents living in High v Low Walkable areas (246 v 263 min/d; effect size= 0. 27); yet those living in Low Walkable areas accrued significantly more light activity (238 v 209 min/d: effect size= 0. 49), whilst those living in High Walkable areas accrued significantly more moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA: 37 v 25 min/d; effect size= 0. 71). These differences mainly occurred in the short 1 – 4 and 5 – 9 min bouts of PA. Only the triceps skinfold was significantly associated (negatively) with levels of MVPA. DISCUSSION: Adolescents living in high- and low-walkable neighbourhoods in an ultra-high density Asian city do not conform to the PA habits often seen in Western adults. A larger and more representative study that includes the influence of confounders is justified...|$|R
40|$|Resumo: Os objetivos desta pesquisa estão delimitados pela compreensão da dinâmica {{cultural}} dos alunos que se situam à margem das aulas de Educação Física - na "periferia" da quadra -, análise da participação e apropriação das aulas de Educação Física por estes alunos, bem como a investigação dos fatores que permitem a existência do fenômeno da "periferia" da quadra. Para isso, o conceito de "periferia" da quadra não se restringiu somente ao significado de espaço físico dos arredores da quadra ou seus "cantos", mas também como uma referência subjetiva aos tempos da aula de Educação Física vivenciados pelos alunos que se distanciaram da proposta inicial do professor. O método de pesquisa centrou-se na etnografia, sendo o trabalho de campo desenvolvido por 6 (seis) meses com uma turma de 7 º ano de uma escola pública em suas aulas de Educação Física. Em termos de procedimentos metodológicos foram utilizados entrevistas semi-estruturadas, análise de documentos e, principalmente, a observação das aulas de Educação Física. O referencial teórico desta pesquisa está calcado nas Ciências Humanas, principalmente em autores e obras que dialogam com a Antropologia e com a Educação. A partir desse escopo, pode-se chegar à compreensão de que o fenômeno da "periferia" da quadra não foi exclusivo de alguns alunos ou grupos de alunos, mas vivenciado por toda a turma. Tal quadro se desenhou não por opção dos alunos, mas pela existência de três fatores que determinaram a "periferia" da quadra: prática pedagógica esportiva e, predominantemente, não-diretiva do professor de Educação Física, compreensão de que a Educação Física era um tempo e espaço menos rígido do processo educacional e a tradicional rigidez escolar. Assim, a "periferia" da quadra configurou-se como um pedaço (Magnani, 1984, 2002) situado entre os ditames escolares e o convívio social mais amplo do aluno na escola. Ante o exposto, a "periferia" da quadra permitiu a existência de uma rede de sociabilidade nas aulas de Educação Física, vivenciada a partir de três modelos de participação: pedacinho (im) praticante, pedacinho ativo e pedacinho flutuante. A sociabilidade vivenciada pelos alunos a partir desses pedacinhos, apesar de possibilitar a vivência de outras relações na escola, deu-se no limite do conformismo declarado, esboçado em conflitos de gênero, prática irrefletida do esporte e na compreensão da Educação Física como um momento de sair da rotina rígida da escola. Dessa forma, houve, por parte dos alunos, uma apropriação limitada, para não dizer ausente, dos conhecimentos da cultura corporal. Entretanto, mesmo inseridos num horizonte limitador de ensino-aprendizagem da Educação Física - na "periferia" da quadra -, os alunos esboçaram críticas às aulas de Educação Física, ao professor e a escola, além de apontarem algumas alternativas. Por fim, conclui-se que a intervenção docente é significativa para a superação da "periferia" da quadra, pois, ao professor, cabe a responsabilidade de provocar novos arranjos frente ao conhecimento dos alunos, para que estes, mais instrumentalizados, possam inserir-se no mundo de forma mais livre e autônomaAbstract: The {{objectives of}} <b>this</b> <b>research</b> <b>are</b> <b>delimited</b> by the {{comprehension of the}} cultural dynamics {{of students who are}} placed at margins in the Physical Education classes - at the "periphery" of the sports' court -, the analysis of the participation and acquisition of Physical Education classes by these students, as well as the investigation on the factors allowing the existence of the "court's periphery" phenomenon. To that end, the concept of the court's "periphery" was not restricted to the mere meaning of physical space around the court or its "corners", but was also taken as a subjective reference to the periods of Physical Education classes as lived by the students who distanced themselves from the initial proposal by the teacher. The <b>research</b> method <b>was</b> centred in ethnography, its fieldwork having been carried on during 6 months with a group of 7 th grade students in a public school, during their Physical Education classes. As for methodological procedures, there was the use of semi-structured interviews, document analysis and, mainly, the observation of the Physical Education classes. <b>This</b> <b>research's</b> theoretical frame-of-reference <b>is</b> based on the Human Sciences, specially on authors and works who dialogue with Anthropology and with Education. From this universe, one may reach the understanding that the phenomenon of the court's "periphery" was not an exclusivity of a few students or groups of students, but rather experienced by the entire group. Such a situation was established not as a students' option, but by the existence of three factors which determined the court's "periphery": sportive pedagogical practice and, mostly, non-directive by the Physical Education teacher; the understanding that the Physical Education was a time and a space less rigid within the educational process, and the traditional school rigidity. Thus, the court's "periphery" was configured as a piece (Magnani, 1984, 2002) located between the school rules and the student's wider social interaction at school. From what was exposed, the court's "periphery" has allowed the existence of a social network in the Physical Education classes, experienced from three models of participation: (non) practising little piece; active little piece and fluctuating little piece. The sociability experienced by the students from these little pieces, however propitiating the experience of other relations at school, took place within the declared conformism, sketched in gender conflicts, the rashly sportive practice, and the understanding of Physical Education as a moment to escape the school's rigid routines. Thus, there was, {{on the part of the}} students, a limited - if not absent - acquisition of the knowledge on bodily culture. However, even though they were located within limiting horizons of the teaching-learning of Physical Education - at the court's "periphery" -, the students drew up criticism towards the Physical Education classes; towards the teacher and the school, while indicating some alternatives. Finally, it was concluded that the teacher's intervention is substantial for the overcoming of the court's "periphery", since it is on the teacher that lies the responsibility of stimulating new arrangements on the students' knowledge, so that they, once having acquired more instruments, may enter the world in a freer, more autonomous wa...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The first {{purpose of}} the study was to {{formulate}} a holistic value proposition framework in connection with value creation concept with an entrepreneurial marketing approach. Meanwhile, the second purpose was to reveal the way of creating value through EM. Whereby, the practical application after the purpose being fulfilled was to identify new pattern of selling and add value to existent milk product in Sweden. Design/methodology/approach – the thesis has adapted an abductive and qualitative approach. A single embedded case study has been conducted based on the Swedish milk industry. In addition, data of the <b>research</b> have <b>been</b> collected by mostly utilizing qualitative interview with various people in different stances. Meanwhile, some principles of observation method of data collection have been employed. Participants of the <b>research</b> have <b>been</b> selected based on purposive sampling and convenience sampling techniques. Moreover, a template analysis adhering with the principle of grounded theory has been applied in the study. Finding – The findings of the research contained two aspects in correspondence with the two research questions the research enquired. The first finding of the <b>research</b> <b>was</b> that a holistic value proposition framework as the source of value creation could reveal the specific strategy on value creation for entrepreneur or company who intends to act entrepreneurially. Whilst, the second finding was that value could be created though entrepreneurial marketing with value proposition as medium in between; in other words, the value creation activity can be realized by resorting to value proposition framework in entrepreneurial marketing. Every value proposition can serve as essential elements for constructing entrepreneurial marketing mix (8 Ps). Accordingly, the identifying of EM STP (segmentation, targeting, and positioning) is the precedence when creating value through entrepreneurial marketing. <b>Research</b> limitation – <b>this</b> <b>research</b> has <b>been</b> primarily <b>delimited</b> to examine one industry (milk industry) in Sweden and conducted under an entrepreneurial marketing approach. In addition, it has been limited to include all value proposition aspects as well as covering all the relevant customer or stakeholder. Practical implication – An entrepreneurial implementation of an entrepreneur or a company that intends to grow entrepreneurially can support their value creation activity in accordance to a holistic value proposition framework as checklist. Originality/value – this paper was an original study to research on an innovative and entrepreneurial business that is not yet in existence.
