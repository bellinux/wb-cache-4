5|$|The book {{is divided}} into two parts. The first part, Epiphany, {{consists}} of eight chapters and focuses on the roots, development, and impact of the Scottish Enlightenment on Scotland and Great Britain. The roots come from an appreciation for democracy and literacy that developed from the Scottish Reformation, when John Knox brought Calvinist Presbyterianism to Scotland. He preached that God ordained power into the people and that it was for the people to administer and enforce God's laws, not the monarchy. For common people to understand God's laws they had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> the Bible, so schools were built in every parish and literacy rates grew rapidly, creating a Scottish-oriented market for books and writers.|$|E
5|$|After {{repairs to}} the college were {{completed}} in mid-1656, the first admissions were made. The first headmaster, Richard Dutton, was appointed in 1655, and in 1665 the institution became an incorporated charity. The number of pupils grew, with admissions rising to 100 by the 1870s. Boys were admitted based on the parish they lived in, and on need, health and background of the family. Illegitimate boys were not admitted, and all boys had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> to a certain standard that meant they were not hard to teach. In 1878, a new schoolroom designed by architect Alfred Waterhouse (who designed Manchester Town Hall) was built in a Tudor style. The number of boys admitted was reduced to 75 in 1908 to save money, though three years later admissions increased again to 99. In 1916, no boys were admitted {{due to lack of}} funding caused by World War I, and in 1918 the number was limited to 70. Successful public appeals resulted in the numbers rising to 97 in 1929. In 1926 a scheme was set up which allowed boys to apply for scholarships to join a grammar school, which meant that while they lived at Chetham's, they were educated elsewhere during the day. Further, they would stay at grammar school until at least the age of 16 and sometimes 18.|$|E

25|$|These clauses could {{potentially}} outlaw any free software capable of reading DRM-using formats (music, video, or even text content); the {{fear was that}} free software implementing DRM would be construed as facilitating circumvention. Designers of software knowingly facilitating circumvention would, with the initial draft, face felony charges of counterfeiting with a maximum penalty of a €300,000 fine and/or three years in prison. Free software advocates thus concluded that the law would have {{a chilling effect on}} the development of free software in France, since any modern desktop system is supposed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> music and video content, and their designers could not be sure whether they would face felony charges.|$|E

25|$|Since Reformers {{wanted all}} members of the church <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> and study the Bible and catechisms, support for {{education}} at all levels increased over time in Europe, the Americas, and {{in other parts of the}} world that were influenced by contact with European educators and missionaries.

25|$|The next psychic claimed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> auras around people. He {{claimed that}} auras were visible {{at least five}} inches above each of them. He {{selected}} ten people who he said had clearly visible auras. They were to stand behind screens and he claimed that their auras would be visible above the screens, which were numbered 1 through 10, and the subjects were told by the astrologer behind which screen to stand. He was to tell {{whether or not a}} person was standing behind each screen, by seeing their aura above. Since random guessing would be expected to get about five correct, the psychic needed to get eight of the ten right. The psychic stated that he saw an aura over all ten screens, but people were behind only four of the screens.|$|E
25|$|Iffat Ara {{was born}} to Maulavi Quazi Abdul Hakim and Mosammat Hajera Khatun in Mymensingh town in 1939. She {{struggled}} hard for formal education, first learning Arabic at home <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> the Quran. She then went to Muslim Girls' School for primary education. After her primary education was over, her father withdrew her from the school since, at that time, higher education for girls was not considered necessary. Desperate to continue education, she threatened to commit suicide and was subsequently admitted to the Vidyamoyee Govt. Girls' High School of the town. But before she could complete the high school {{she was married to}} Abdul Latif Talukder, a young lawyer and politician. Luckily it was a short interruption and she could appear in the Matriculate examination the next year. Later, she passed Intermediate from the Muminunnesa Women's College. In 1966 she graduated from the same college and proceeded to study for B. Ed. at the Mymensingh Women's Teachers Training College. When Ananda Mohan College was upgraded to a university-college, Iffat Ara lost no time to get admitted for her Masters in Bengali language and literature.|$|E

500|$|The {{curriculum}} {{during the}} 17th and 18th centuries {{is not known}} for certain. In 1714 the trustees agreed that the pupils should attend church services at St Denys' Church six days a week; whether this was adhered to is not clear. Religious practice was a stipulation in the 1835 decree, which required pupils to pray at the start and end of each day and engage in daily readings of holy scriptures. However, the emphasis was always on classical education, which likely required instruction in Latin from the earliest times; in 1835, learning the classics was enshrined as the school's primary purpose. In the mid-19th century, Carre's offered this classical education for free, but arithmetic, geometry and algebra were taught as extras {{at a rate of}} two guineas per term. Students were enrolled from the age of eight, and were expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>read,</b> write, recite the Lord's Prayer, the Apostles' Creed and the Ten Commandments, and [...] "be qualified to begin Latin grammar". Students had to supply their own equipment, except pens and ink, which were covered by a 10 shilling payment made each term to the school. The school's inspection in 1865 mentions geography and history teaching, although the general standard of attainment was low.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile [...] Mitford had {{completed}} her latest book, [...] Voltaire in Love, {{an account of}} the love affair between Voltaire and the Marquise du Châtelet. [...] She considered it her first truly grown-up work, and her best. Published in 1957, it sold well, was taken seriously by the critics and [...] was warmly praised by Mitford's friends. Its writing had been hampered by painful headaches arising from her apparently failing eyesight and [...] worries that she might be going blind. The problem was resolved after a visit to the ophthalmic surgeon Patrick Trevor-Roper, who gave her new spectacles: [...] "It is heavenly <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> for a long time on end & now I see how handicapped I was when doing Voltaire". She then returned to writing [...] fiction, with Don't Tell Alfred, in which she revived Fanny Wincham, the narrator of The Pursuit of Love and Love in a Cold Climate, and placed her in a Paris setting as wife of the British ambassador. Several characters familiar from the earlier novels appear in minor roles. The book, published in October 1960, was popular with the public, but received indifferent reviews. Some of Mitford's friends disliked it, and she decided she would write no more fiction.|$|E
