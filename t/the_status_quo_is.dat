Quite simply, the Scottish people want to be more {{directly}} and deeply involved in the decisions that affect them and the generations to come. It is with this uppermost in mind that today we launch The National, a daily newspaper that will fly a vibrant flag for independence and the right for Scots to govern themselves.|$|E

Mega Man then discovers that Wily was responsible for arresting Dr. Light, and that Light has fallen ill. Afterward, Mega Man's ally Proto Man comes in and warns the hero {{that it is a}} trap, stating that the seemingly ill scientist is an impostor used by Wily to make the initial news video. Mega Man then takes his chances with Wily, and while he is disabled when Wily's fortress comes down on him, Proto Man returns quickly to save him. In the end, Dr. Wily escapes, Dr. Light is freed, and <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>quo</b> <b>is</b> restored.

There is a global anxiety about how fragile <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>quo</b> <b>is</b> {{and the safety of}} citizens, but in my mind—honestly—this film is in another realm. There is no {{correlation}} to the real world. There is no fear of a copycat Kaiju attack because a Kaiju saw it on the news and said, [...] "I'm going to destroy Seattle." [...] In my case, I'm picking up a tradition. One that started right after World War II and was a coping mechanism, in a way, for Japan to heal the wounds of that war.

2500|$|In addition, the {{situation}} can be confusing {{because of the}} different parties and the effort by many groups {{to deal with the}} controversy through a policy of deliberate ambiguity. [...] The political solution that is accepted by many of the current groups is the perspective of the status quo: to unofficially treat Taiwan as a state and at a minimum, to officially declare no support for the government of this state making a formal declaration of independence. What a formal declaration of independence would consist of is not clear. <b>The</b> <b>status</b> <b>quo</b> <b>is</b> accepted in large part because it does not define the legal or future status of Taiwan, leaving each group to interpret {{the situation}} {{in a way that is}} politically acceptable to its members. [...] At the same time, a policy of status quo has been criticized as being dangerous precisely because different sides have different interpretations of what <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>quo</b> <b>is,</b> leading to the possibility of war through brinkmanship or miscalculation.|$|E

2500|$|The castle {{gatehouse}} is in poor {{condition and}} {{has been added to}} English Heritage's Heritage at Risk register. The building has repeatedly been vandalised and is suffering the effects of the weather. The site is within the boundaries of the North York Moors National Park, and the National Park Authority, English Heritage and the site owner have collaborated to develop a plan to conserve the site. A report produced for the park authority in 2005 examined several options, including retaining the building as ruins but improving security by employing a custodian, converting the gatehouse into a liveable property for use as a house or holiday home, or establishing a local community group to help manage and maintain the site. The option of converting the gatehouse was recommended. The report concluded that [...] "retention of <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>quo</b> <b>is</b> not felt to be an acceptable option, due to continuing damage through vandalism to the historic fabric and archaeology, together with the impaired public enjoyment and the uneconomic nature of future repairs and maintenance to the site." [...] English Heritage part-funded a feasibility study to assess the prospects of turning the gatehouse into a home. However, these plans fell through due to the collapse into administration of the Vivat Trust, which had proposed the conversion.|$|E
2500|$|Defenses of wage {{labor and}} chattel {{slavery in the}} {{literature}} have linked the subjection of man to man with the subjection of man to nature; arguing that hierarchy and a social system's particular relations of production represent human nature and are no more coercive than the reality of life itself. According to this narrative, any well-intentioned attempt to fundamentally change <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>quo</b> <b>is</b> naively utopian and will result in more oppressive conditions. Bosses {{in both of these}} long-lasting systems argued that their system created a lot of wealth and prosperity. In some sense, both did create jobs and their investment entailed risk. For example, slave owners risked losing money by buying chattel slaves who later became ill or died; while bosses risked losing money by hiring workers (wage slaves) to make products that didn't sell well on the market. Marginally, both chattel and wage slaves may become bosses; sometimes by working hard. It may be the [...] "rags to riches" [...] story which occasionally occurs in capitalism, or the [...] "slave to master" [...] story that occurred in places like colonial Brazil, where slaves could buy their own freedom and become business owners, self-employed, or slave owners themselves. Social mobility, or the hard work and risk that it may entail, are thus not considered to be a redeeming factor by critics of the concept of wage slavery.|$|E
2500|$|Reflecting on {{not just}} the {{situation}} in Tunisia and Egypt {{but also on the}} 2011 Yemeni protests, and the 2011 Jordanian protests, Clinton said at a February 5 meeting of the Quartet on the Middle East, [...] "The region is being battered by a perfect storm of powerful trends. ... This is what has driven demonstrators into the streets of ... cities throughout the region. <b>The</b> <b>status</b> <b>quo</b> <b>is</b> simply not sustainable." [...] She said that while transition to democracy could be chaotic – and free elections had to be accompanied by free speech, a free judiciary, {{and the rule of law}} in order to be effective – in the end [...] "free people govern themselves best". The transformations highlighted that traditional U.S. foreign policy in the region had sided with rulers who suppressed internal dissent but provided stability and generally supported U.S. goals in the region. When the monarchy's response to the 2011 Bahraini protests turned violent, Clinton urged a return to the path of reform, saying that violence against the protesters [...] "is absolutely unacceptable ... We very much want to see the human rights of the people protected, including right to assemble, right to express themselves, and we want to see reform." [...] At the same time, she said that the U.S. [...] "cannot tell countries what they are going to do [...] cannot dictate the outcomes." [...] As the situation in Bahrain lingered on and continued to have episodes of violence against protesters, Clinton said in mid-March, [...] "Our goal is a credible political process that can address the legitimate aspirations of all the people of Bahrain ... Violence is not and cannot be the answer. A political process is. We have raised our concerns about the current measures directly with Bahraini officials and will continue to do so." ...|$|E

60|$|There is, however, {{very little}} {{hope that the}} {{decisions}} reached by the Washington Conference will permanently benefit China, and a considerable chance that they may do quite the reverse. In Manchuria <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>quo</b> <b>is</b> to be maintained, while in Shantung the Japanese have made concessions, the value of which only time can show. The Four Powers--America, Great Britain, France, and Japan--have agreed to exploit China in combination, not competitively. There is a consortium as regards loans, which will have {{the power of the}} purse and will therefore be the real Government of China. As the Americans are the only people who have much spare capital, they will control the consortium. As they consider their civilization the finest in the world, they will set to work to turn the Chinese into muscular Christians. As the financiers are the most splendid feature of the American civilization, China must be so governed as to enrich the financiers, who will in return establish colleges and hospitals and Y.M.C.A.'s throughout the length and breadth of the land, and employ agents to buy up the artistic treasures of China for sepulture in their mansions. Chinese intellect, like that of America, will be, directly or indirectly, in the pay of the Trust magnates, and therefore no effective voice will be, raised in favour of radical reform. The inauguration of this system will be welcomed even by some Socialists in the West as a great victory for peace and freedom.|$|E
60|$|Glaring as {{were the}} {{intellectual}} faults of the Oxford movement, it was at any rate a recognition in a very forcible way of the doctrine that spiritual matters {{are not to be}} settled by the dicta of a political council. It acknowledged that a man is answerable at his own peril for having found or lost the truth. It was a warning that he must reckon with a judge who will not account the status quo, nor the convenience of a cabinet, a good plea for indolent acquiescence in theological error. It ended, in the case of its most vigorous champions, in a final and deliberate putting out of the eyes of the understanding. The last act of assertion of personal responsibility was a headlong acceptance of the responsibility of tradition and the Church. This was deplorable enough. But apart from other advantages incidental to the tractarian movement, such as the attention which it was the means of drawing to history and the organic connection between present and past, it had, we repeat, the merit of being an effective protest against what may be called the House of Commons' view of human life--a view excellent in its place, but most blighting and dwarfing out of it. It was, what every sincere uprising of the better spirit in men and women must always be, an effective protest against the leaden tyranny of the man {{of the world and the}} so-called practical person. The man of the world despises catholics for taking their religious opinions on trust and being the slaves of tradition. As if he had himself formed his own most important opinions either in religion or anything else. He laughs at them for their superstitious awe of the Church. As if his own inward awe of the Greater Number were one whit less of a superstition. He mocks their deference for the past. As if his own absorbing deference to the present were one tittle better bottomed or a jot more respectable. The modern emancipation will profit us very little if <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>quo</b> <b>is</b> to be fastened round our necks with the despotic authority of a heavenly dispensation, and if in the stead of ancient Scriptures we are to accept the plenary inspiration of Majorities.|$|E
