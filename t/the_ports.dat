In this paper, the concept and characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>port</b> service ecosystem is discussed, a hierarchical model of <b>the</b> <b>port</b> service ecosystem is constructed. As an extended logistic model, Lotka-Volterra model is applied to study the competitive co-evolution and mutually beneficial co-evolution of enterprises in <b>the</b> <b>port</b> service ecosystem. This paper simulates the co-evolution of enterprises in <b>the</b> <b>port</b> service ecosystem by using MATLAB programming. The simulation results show that the breadth of the niche of the enterprises is changing with the change of the competition coefficient and the coefficient of mutual benefit in <b>the</b> <b>port</b> service ecosystem. Based on that, some proposals are put forward to ensure the healthy and orderly development of <b>the</b> <b>port</b> service ecosystem...|$|R
