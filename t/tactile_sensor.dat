50|$|The first {{description}} of a technical implementation related to Tactile Imaging was given in the late 1970s by Frei et al. who proposed an instrument for breast palpation that used a plurality of spaced piezoelectric force sensors. The sensors were pressed against the breast tissue by a pressure member which applied a given periodic or steady stress to the tissue. A different principle for evaluating the pattern of pressure distribution over a compressed breast was proposed by Gentle in 1980s. The pressure distribution was monitored optically by using the principle of frustrated total internal reflection to generate a brightness distribution. Then, Sabatini et al. built a robotic system for discriminating mechanical inhomogeneities in a soft tissue using a finger-like palpation device equipped with a fingertip piezoelectric polymer film <b>tactile</b> <b>sensor.</b> The first review about the <b>tactile</b> <b>sensor</b> development for robots is dated by 1986.|$|E

40|$|Recently, <b>tactile</b> <b>sensors</b> {{mounted on}} robot fingers have been {{identified}} as essential sensory devices for the control of multifingered robotic hands. A basic tactile sensing task is to determine the force distribution on the contact area between the fingers and grasped object.
