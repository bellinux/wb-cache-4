5|$|Born in Tasmania, Whittle {{completed}} {{twelve months}} active service during the Second Boer War, {{before returning to}} Australia and enlisting in the Royal Navy where he served for five years as a stoker. Re-enlisting in the army, he was posted to the Army Service Corps, artillery, and Tasmanian Rifle Regiment prior to {{the outbreak of the}} First World War. Transferring to the Australian Imperial Force in 1915, Whittle joined the 12th Battalion in Egypt and embarked for the Western Front the following year. During an attack on the village of La Barque, Whittle rushed a German trench and forced <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> position; he was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal as a result.|$|E
5|$|Gibson's Brigade {{continued}} south, waking the 37th Battalion, Virginia Cavalry. This unit fled in all directions, and Gibson's men did {{not need}} to shoot. This left the 36th Battalion, Virginia Cavalry, between Gibson's Brigade and General Johnson's headquarters at the McNeill house. The 36th offered the best resistance Gibson had faced so far, but the surprised Confederates were forced to retreat toward the McNeill farm. Near the McNeill house <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Confederate Baltimore Battery attempted to fire canister from their two guns, but the unit and guns were captured by the 8th Ohio Cavalry before they could be fired. General Johnson was nearly captured when his headquarters was partially surrounded by Union cavalry. He escaped out the back door and jumped on a horse—racing south to the 8th Virginia Cavalry.|$|E

He plots to dye Lad's coat red to embarrass the Master for the earlier incident, but accidentally dyes Lochaber King's coat instead, after the two dogs change locations. He is left having to answer for the dog's ruined coat while Lad wins the silver trophy.|$|E

5|$|Unknown to the brigade, {{units of}} the German 1st Parachute Division had parachuted onto Catania {{airfield}} to reinforce the Italians guarding the bridge and quickly moved to regain the crossing. The German paratroops attacked at dawn. The defenders at the bridge held out all day against infantry, armour and attacks by aircraft. South of the bridge, the 2nd Parachute Battalion also under attack, were able to call on naval gunfire support from the 6inch guns of the British cruiser , which stopped an assault {{that was about to}} overrun their position. <b>The</b> <b>men</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 1st and 3rd Battalions, although initially forced across the river, still held the southern bank until dark when they withdrew to the 2nd Battalion's position.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{arrival at}} Auschwitz, the SS {{forcibly}} separated <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> women and children, and Otto Frank was wrenched from his family. Those deemed {{able to work}} were admitted into the camp, and those deemed unfit for labour were immediately killed. Of the 1,019 passengers, 549—including all children younger than 15—were sent directly to the gas chambers. Anne Frank, who had turned 15 three months earlier, {{was one of the}} youngest people spared from her transport. She was soon made aware that most people were gassed upon arrival and never learned that the entire group from the Achterhuis had survived this selection. She reasoned that her father, in his mid-fifties and not particularly robust, had been killed immediately after they were separated.|$|E
5|$|A second {{senior officer}} {{was killed in}} action, when Brigadier-General Arthur Lowe, {{commanding}} the divisional artillery, was killed near Ypres on 24 November. In late December 1917, a new commanding officer, Major-General Neill Malcolm {{was appointed to the}} 66th Division. Malcolm was a decorated veteran of several colonial wars, who had served in staff posts since being wounded in the Second Boer War and had most recently served as {{chief of staff of the}} Fifth Army. The division was reorganised over the winter, with the brigade machine-gun companies being consolidated into a battalion and a pioneer battalion, the 1/5th Border Regiment joining the division. The most substantial change was the loss of three battalions, the 3/5th Lancashire Fusiliers and 2/8th and 2/10th Manchester Regiment, one from each brigade. This was a change made in all British divisions, to bring the remaining battalions in France up to strength and to increase the ratio of artillery to infantry. At this point, there was a general exchange of men between the 42nd and 66th Divisions; the core of the 1/6th Lancashire Fusiliers, 1/4th East Lancashires, and 1/9th Manchesters were transferred to the 66th Division, where they amalgamated with their second-line counterparts, while the 42nd Division received <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> disbanded battalions in the 66th Division. The division remained in the Passchendaele area until February 1918.|$|E

5|$|At 8:00pm the Japanese {{sent two}} Type 95 tanks with bright {{headlights}} into the plantation. <b>The</b> <b>men</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 2/10th tried to disable them with sticky bombs, {{but due to}} the humid conditions the bombs failed {{to adhere to the}} Japanese armour. In the fighting that followed over the course of two and a half hours, the Australians suffered heavy casualties. Receiving indirect fire support from the 2/5th Field Regiment's 25 pounder guns situated near Gili Gili, they repelled four frontal attacks. However, by midnight the Japanese were inside the Australian position and in the confusion the 2/10th withdrew in some disorder to a number of scattered positions on {{the west bank of the}} Gama, which they reached by about 2:00am on 28 August. A further assault, however, by tank-mounted infantry forced them back further, moving back through the 61st and 25th Infantry Battalions towards No. 3 Airstrip, which was still under construction, south of Kilarbo. During the brief engagement around KB Mission, they had lost 43 men killed and another 26 wounded.|$|E
5|$|During the fighting, {{out of a}} {{total of}} 976 men deployed, the {{battalion}} lost 137 men killed in action and 106 wounded, while a further 24 suffered from shell shock. A total of 808 men were taken into captivity, including most of the wounded. Four men managed to escape to Australia but of the remaining men, 263 died while prisoners of war. Following their capture, <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 2/4th in Singapore were concentrated in Changi prison, before being split up and sent to various prison camps around the Pacific, including Borneo, Burma, Thailand, Java, Sumatra, Japan and Formosa. There they were used as slave labour on the Burma–Thai Railway, in coal mines and on wharves, during which they were subjected to harsh treatment, starvation, disease and extreme brutality, which took a heavy toll. Many soldiers from the 2/4th were also killed while being taken to Japan, when the ships were sunk by Allied submarines.|$|E
5|$|The clip {{opens with}} Lopez and her love {{interest}} conversing {{on the side}} walk {{in front of a}} shop window. These scenes are intercut with that of suspicious men in a van, observing Lopez and her lover. Later, Lopez and her lover split and she starts singing as she walks down the street. She goes inside a boutique and enters through at a secret door. As she enters, she takes off a wig and changes her clothing. She enters in a room where there are pictures of her lover scattered across a table. These scenes are intercut with scenes of Lopez and her lover laying in a grass. As the video progresses, Lopez is seen sad, accompanied with her love interest and his friend in an apartment; they are observing from a window with binoculars. It is revealed that <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> beginning of the video are FBI officers and they are entering the building abruptly. They break into Lopez and her lover's apartment and arrest him. In the end, it is revealed that Lopez is an undercover FBI agent who surrenders her boyfriend.|$|E

5|$|The first glider {{casualties}} {{had occurred}} on take off, when two aircraft towing Waco gliders crashed. While on route, {{one of the}} gliders was released early by its towing aircraft, and crashed into the sea. When they did arrive over Sicily, {{the element of surprise}} was gone, and four gliders were shot down by the coastal anti-aircraft batteries. By the time the gliders arrived at their landing zones, two hours had lapsed since the parachute landings had started. One glider pilot later commented that they did not need the pathfinders, as the tracer and lights from explosions were brighter than any of the landing markers. Of the surviving glider force, only four gliders managed to land relatively unscathed, all the others being caught by the Fallschirmjäger machine gun fire and destroyed on their approach. The four intact gliders had been carrying three of the anti-tank guns, which were now included in the bridge's defences. Including <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> gliders, the 1st Parachute Brigade had 295men at the bridge. Shortage of manpower was not their only problem; their only support weapons were the anti-tank guns, two 3-inch mortars and a Vickers machine gun.|$|E
5|$|The second assault proved no more successful. The red-coated English and the blue-coated Dutch {{advanced}} {{side by side}} {{in perfect}} order for a second attempt. Requiring from them another concerted effort their general officers personally led <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> front into a second torrent of musket-shot and grenades. Again the Allies left many dead and wounded at the enemy palisade including Marshal Count von Limburg Styrum who had led the second assault. With broken ranks, and in confusion, the attacking troops fell once more back down the hill. With the Allies repulsed for a second time the exultant Bavarian grenadiers, with bayonets fixed, poured over their breastworks to pursue the attackers and drive them to defeat. But English guardsmen, aided by Lumley's dismounted cavalrymen, prevented a total rout, compelling the Bavarians back behind their defences.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} these rifle units during the skirmishing period, coupled {{with the arrival of}} large numbers of new army recruits, led Washington to create {{additional}} provisional rifle companies. He placed them under the command of Daniel Morgan in early June 1777, calling the unit the Provisional Rifle Corps, although it was most commonly known as Morgan's Rifle Corps in period documents. Morgan then simultaneously led the 11th Virginia Regiment, his permanent unit, and this provisional unit. Thirty-five officers and enlisted men in Smith's and Long's composite companies, as well as others selected from their regular musket regiments, were detached from their permanent units to form this elite regiment-sized force. <b>The</b> <b>men</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment all served in one of the Rifle Corps' eight companies, Capt. Gabriel Long's Provisional Rifle Company; {{with the exception of a}} single man, all other members of the company came from the 11th Virginia Regiment. Like Morgan, Long was now technically in command of two Continental Army units, one permanent and one provisional. Long served in the Rifle Corps until his resignation in May 1779, at which time command of his company passed to Marylander Lt. Elijah Evans, also one of the original officers of the Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment. Evans returned to Rawlings' regiment, his permanent unit, when his detached duty in the Rifle Corps ended with its formal disbanding in early November 1779. The Rifle Corps is most notable for the major role it played in the Battles of Saratoga.|$|E

25|$|On a small terrace {{overlooking}} the tryworks was a substantial tile-roofed building, the cooperage.
