40|$|Since taking {{power in}} 2009, the Alliance for European Integration (AIE) {{has been trying}} to end Moldova’s {{dependence}} on Russian gas. Currently, natural gas accounts for about 50 % of the country’s energy balance (excluding Transnistria), and Gazprom has a monopoly on the supply of gas to the republic. The key element of Chișinău’s diversification project is the construction of the Iasi-Ungheni pipeline, which is designed to link the Moldovan and Romanian gas transmission networks, and consequently make it possible for Moldova to purchase gas from countries other than Russia. Despite significant delays, construction work on the interconnector began in August 2013. The Moldovan government sees ensuring energy independence from Russia as its top priority. The significance and urgency of the project reflect Chișinău’s frustration at Moscow’s continued attempts to use its monopoly of Moldova’s energy sector to exert political pressure on the republic. Nonetheless, despite numerous declarations by Moldovan and Romanian politicians, the Iasi- -Ungheni pipeline will not end Moldova’s dependence on Russian gas before the end of <b>the</b> <b>current</b> decade. This <b>timeframe</b> is unrealistic for two reasons: first, because an additional gas pipeline from Ungheni to Chisinau and a compression station must be constructed, which will take at least five years and will require significant investment; and second, because of the unrelenting opposition to the project coming from Gazprom, which currently controls Moldova’s pipelines and will likely try to torpedo any energy diversification attempts. Independence from Russian gas will only be possible after the the Gazprom-controlled Moldova-GAZ, the operator of the Moldovan transmission network and the country’s importer of natural gas, is divided.

40|$|The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) {{manages a}} vast array of {{infrastructure}} assets across ten National Centers with a worth of at least 30 billion dollars. Eighty percent of this infrastructure is greater than 40 years old and is in degraded condition. Maintenance budgets are typically {{less than one percent of}} current replacement value (CRV), much less than the 2 - 4 % recommended by the National Research Council. The maintenance backlog was 2. 55 billion dollars in FY 10 and growing. NASA s annual budgets have flattened and are at risk of being reduced, so the problem is becoming even more difficult. NASA Centers utilize various means to prioritize and accomplish maintenance within available budgets, though data is suspect and processes are variable. This paper offers a structured means to prioritize maintenance based on mission criticality and facility performance (ability of the facility to deliver on its purpose). Mission alignment is assessed using <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>timeframe</b> Mission Dependence Index and a measure of facility alignment with the 2011 NASA Strategic Plan for the long-term perspective. Facility performance is assessed by combining specific findings from a structured facility condition assessment and an assessment of actual functional output.

The purpose of this approach is to provide the best benefits for the available funding. Additionally, this rationale can also be applied to the prioritization of investment (recapitalization) projects so that the ultimate customers of this paper, the senior infrastructure managers at each NASA Center, are better able to strategically manage their capabilities...|$|E
40|$|In <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>timeframe,</b> the {{relevance}} of discussions on the existing use of space for national security purposes and the potential of it {{to be used for}} non-peaceful purposes are clearly increasing. As a consequence, it becomes more important to address the role of Europe as a geopolitical, albeit far from monolithic, entity in this context. From this perspective, the present paper analyzes some of the fundamental institutional parameters shaping the European presence in the space security domain, focusing on the two key players in space, which are truly European, the European Space Agency (ESA) and the European Union (EU). Interestingly, the starting point for both entities was that the security domain was a “no-go” area, a starting point that only {{over the last two decades}} has begun to erode. That is why, in addition the Western European Union (WEU), Europe has a certain role in this context, precisely fromthe security perspective rather than from the space perspective. Even the European Community, as the most tightly developed “pillar” of the EU, could not be considered a supranational entity let alone a federal state. In all cases therefore, the individual member states of those organizations are still relevant as players in their own right. These states continue to be essential to determining the shape of European actions and approaches in the field of space issues, and this is even truer for the security domain. The resulting complicated institutional landscape represents the backdrop against which, as well as a set of crucial parameters within which, European policies in the area of space are developed. This applies to the space security domain, whether one takes a broad approach as with Space Situational Awareness (SSA) and the handling of space debris, or a more limited one, focusing on international terrorism or the handling of export controls over dual-use sensitive goods...|$|E

40|$|In South Africa, {{the current}} {{movement}} towards {{the inclusion of}} children with disabilities, including children with hearing loss, {{is likely to have}} far-reaching consequences for both teachers and learners. Undoubtedly, needs will arise from teachers during the transition, especially in the areas pertaining to the audiological and educational management of children with hearing loss. A hearing loss often negatively impacts {{on the development of the}} child’s auditory, language, speech, communication, literacy, academic, and psychosocial skills. The educational audiologist is uniquely skilled in managing the effects of hearing loss on the child’s educational development, and is a crucial member on the educational team. The educational audiologist as specialist in the management of children with hearing loss, is able to offer a wide range of support and assistance to teachers as well as children with hearing loss in the inclusive educational system. When teachers receive appropriate educational audiology services, they are enabled to provide quality education that strives to reach the full potential of every child with hearing loss. Therefore, an urgent need existed to determine the needs of teachers of children with hearing loss regarding an educational audiology service delivery model for use within the inclusive educational system. In order to comply with this need, a descriptive research design was developed comprising of a questionnaire survey followed by focus group interviews. The questionnaire survey explored the needs of 664 teachers of children with hearing loss. Focus group interviews were conducted with 19 teachers of children with hearing loss and these results were used to substantiate findings from the questionnaire survey. The results of the study indicated that the needs of teachers differ according to the sub-groups found among teachers, namely those teachers who mainly promote the use of spoken language and those who mainly promote Sign Language. Findings revealed that, although participants realised the importance of various aspects of development of the child with hearing loss, they generally did not realise the importance of receiving support from an educational audiologist. With respect to specifics in term of support, participants strongly recommended that teachers receive support in the acquisition of knowledge re the trouble-shooting of hearing aids, advocacy for the implementation of FM systems in inclusive classrooms and the development of speech production skills of the child with hearing loss in the inclusive environment. In addition, various suggestions were made regarding the structure of services rendered within the educational context.

40|$|Worldwide, {{ecosystems}} {{have demonstrated}} the potential for dramatic shifts to an alternative persistent state under gradual long-term environmental changes or following sudden short-term perturbations. Such shifts are documented for numerous marine examples from coral reef to pelagic communities and may become more common as ecological dynamics adjust to climate-driven changes. These shifts are often sudden, challenging to predict and can have disastrous and unpredictable consequences on both ecosystem functioning and the human activities that rely on the associated natural resources. They often result in irreversible dramatic changes in community structure and productivity and represent {{a growing concern for}} managers of natural systems. In ecosystems where the presence of an alternative persistent state is well documented, the drivers of these shifts (e. g. anthropogenic stressors or changes in environmental conditions) can be analysed retrospectively so as to address key management questions, as has occurred in several applications on coral reefs. However, phase shifts are often swift and observed a posteriori, i. e. after the ecosystem has shifted to the alternative state. Thus, thresholds in ecosystem dynamics are difficult to identify empirically despite that this is crucial for sound management of marine resources. Additionally, controlled experimental assessment of the effects of alternative management scenarios on community state is hardly ever achievable in marine ecosystems. When they occur, phase shifts are unique to each ecosystem, hence case-specific simulation models present a valuable tool to explore ecological dynamics with alternative persistent community states, test the effects of management scenarios and inform decision-making. On the east coast of Tasmania, shallow rocky reef communities on the exposed coast mainly occur in two alternative persistent states: (1) the seaweed bed state characterised by a dense productive canopy of macroalgae; or, (2) the sea urchin ‘barren’ state characterised by a poorly productive rocky habitat largely bare of seaweeds as a result of destructive grazing by the long-spined sea urchin (Centrostephanus rodgersii). The establishment of these widespread sea urchin barrens result from a combination of both: (1) the climatedriven range extension of the long-spined sea urchin C. rodgersii from Australia’s mainland to Tasmania; and (2) depletion of key reef predators by fishing. Large southern rock lobster (Jasus edwardsii) individuals constitute the main predator of the long-spined sea urchin in Tasmania. Relative to the seaweed bed state, C. rodgersii barrens represent dramatic losses of habitat, species diversity and productivity, including commercial species such as blacklip abalone (Haliotis rubra) and southern rock lobster, the two most valuable fisheries in Tasmania. Thus, the spread of sea urchin barrens presents a major and pressing threat for the lobster and abalone fishing industries. This thesis presents a suite of models specifically developed to better understand the dynamics of Tasmanian rocky reef communities and inform management interventions to mitigate destructive grazing of seaweed beds by the invasive long-spined sea urchin. Chapter 2 investigates the causal relationships between positive feedback and the occurrence of alternative states in community dynamics. Modelling of community feedback informed by available qualitative knowledge about ecosystem structure constitutes a valuable framework to detect the potential for alternative states in ecological dynamics as illustrated with some examples from Tasmanian rocky reef communities. Qualitative modelling assists to understand the essential features of temperate reef dynamics around Tasmania, and provides a useful first step towards quantitative modelling of rocky reef dynamics. The approach provides an ideal framework to (i) collate all available information about rocky reef ecology, (ii) test model structure uncertainty, and (iii) identify key drivers of alternative states in ecosystem dynamics. The quantitative model presented in the subsequent chapters captures the dynamics of the three key groups or species (i. e. the rock lobster, sea urchin, and seaweed assemblage) directly involved in the positive feedback that drives the shift between alternative states on Tasmanian rocky reef. Chapter 3 describes the development, parameterisation and calibration of a mean field model of the local dynamics (reef area of 100 m 2 - 10 ha) of a reef community. The model’s ability to capture the potential for phase shifts, from dense seaweed bed to sea urchin barrens habitat and back, is validated against largescale patterns observed on rocky reefs where C. rodgersii occurs. In the simulations, the time for extensive sea urchin barrens to form is of the order of two decades, while restoration of seaweed cover from the sea urchin barrens habitat takes about three decades if relying on management interventions that cannot effectively reduce urchin density to zero. Thus, restoration of seaweed beds seems unrealistic to implement within <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>timeframe</b> of management plans. Comprehensive model-independent sensitivity analysis of model behaviour to parameter estimates also suggests that, in addition to lobster fishing mortality, recruitment rates of sea urchins and rock lobsters, which are strongly influenced by large scale oceanographic features and highly variable in eastern Tasmania, are key factors in determining the potential for sea urchin barren formation in the model. In Chapter 4, sets of Monte-Carlo simulations with this model are used to address three sets of questions related to management for mitigation of sea urchin destructive grazing of Tasmanian seaweed beds. Model behaviour suggests that thresholds in shifting from seaweed bed to sea urchin barren and restoration of seaweed cover reveal the existence of a hysteresis in model dynamics. The hysteresis implies that the establishment of sea urchin barrens cannot be reversed easily. These thresholds provide valuable ecological reference points to prevent the establishment of sea urchin barrens. The model indicates that culling of sea urchins appears as the most effective management strategy to minimise the ecological impact of C. rodgersii on Tasmanian reef communities. Indirect interventions relying solely on the rebuilding of rock lobster population (through reduction in fishing or implementation of a maximum legal catch size) perform poorly but, when combined with direct control of the sea urchin population, they can provide optimal outcomes both in terms of minimising barren formation and fishery performance. Finally, the model shows that to allow lobsters to play their critical ecological ‘service’ role in preventing sea urchin barrens formation, a reduction in lobster fishing mortality from current levels is required. A maximum sustainable yield as estimated from the single species stock assessment model does not account for the ecosystem service delivered by larger lobsters, and the models emphasise the need for an ecosystem-based fishery management approach. This suite of models contributes to the general understanding of mechanisms and drivers that can facilitate shift between alternative states in ecological dynamics. The quantitative simulation model provides specific information to managers about the drivers of shifts between the seaweed bed and the sea urchin barren state in the dynamics of Tasmanian rocky reefs. In particular, the presence of a hysteresis in reef community dynamics means that effort to prevent barrens formation constitutes a more viable and cost effective management strategy than the restoration of seaweed beds once extensive barrens habitat has developed. The commercially-fished rock lobster is an essential reef predator delivering key ecosystem services to Tasmanian rocky reefs and model simulations highlight the necessity for fisheries management to move away from a single species focus and account for the ecological role of targeted commercial species. The tools implemented here to inform an ecosystem-based management of Tasmanian rocky reefs are generic and ‘transportable’ to other ecosystems with alternative states. While C. rodgersii barrens currently constitute a pressing concern for managers of reef communities and fisheries in Tasmania, the longspined sea urchin is only one example of a species that is dramatically restructuring Tasmanian reef communities. There are many other ‘natural’ invaders, whose ecosystem roles and impacts are unknown, currently extending their distribution from Australia’s mainland to the warming Tasmanian waters. In the coming decades, climate-driven changes are likely to bring more surprises to Tasmanian rocky reefs, and just as many challenges for the associated fisheries and their managers...|$|E
