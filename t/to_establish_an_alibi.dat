5|$|Aboriginal {{versions}} of the story also exist. In 1987, an elderly Aboriginal man from nearby Kingston related {{a version of the}} story, in which Brown shot some Aboriginal people and poisoned others because they were stealing his sheep. Brown then established his alibi by riding to Adelaide. In the same year Hastings' account was reproduced verbatim in Tom McCourt and Hans Mincham's The Coorong and Lakes of the Lower Murray. Three years later, the South Australian Education Department published an Aboriginal studies book for secondary students. It repeated Hastings' version, and followed it with an Aboriginal version told by a Ngarrindjeri man, George Trevorrow, whose family were from the Guichen Bay area. Trevorrow described the exploitation of Aboriginal workers by white settlers, and stated that when times were lean, Aboriginal people would steal flour from landowners. He did not name Brown, but stated that a settler poisoned some flour and rode for Adelaide <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> <b>an</b> <b>alibi.</b> Foster et al. note that while these two accounts were similar, the difference was that Hastings portrayed Brown as a victim of Aboriginal attacks, while Trevorrow emphasised white exploitation of Aboriginal people.|$|E
500|$|Five years later, a local historian, J.G.Hastings, wrote a manuscript, {{entitled}} The History of the Coorong, {{which proved}} {{influential in the}} development of the legend of James Brown. In it, Hastings elaborated on the poisoning incident in which Brown had supposedly been involved. By this account, Brown, responding to repeated attacks on his livestock, poisoned some flour and left it accessible to local Aboriginal people, who subsequently stole the flour and ate it, with many dying as a result. Having set the trap, Brown then rode for Adelaide <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> <b>an</b> <b>alibi,</b> swimming across the Murray mouth on his way. According to Hastings, when the case was investigated by the police, Brown's ride to Adelaide [...] "set him in good stead". Hastings wrote that at Brown's trial, it was claimed that it was impossible that Brown had poisoned the flour and appeared in Adelaide immediately thereafter.|$|E
500|$|Ainsworth's tale of Turpin's {{overnight}} {{journey from}} London to York on his mare Black Bess has {{its origins in}} an episode recorded by Daniel Defoe, in his 1727 work A tour thro' the whole island of Great Britain. [...] After committing a robbery in Kent in 1676, William Nevison apparently rode to York <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> <b>an</b> <b>alibi,</b> and Defoe's account of that journey became part of folk legend. [...] A similar ride was attributed to Turpin as early as 1808, and was being performed on stage by 1819, but the feat as imagined by Ainsworth (about 200miles {{in less than a}} day) is impossible. [...] Nevertheless, Ainsworth's legend of Black Bess was repeated in works such as Black Bess or the Knight of the Road, a 254-part penny dreadful published in 1867–68. [...] In these tales, Turpin was the hero, accompanied by his trusty colleagues Claude Duval, Tom King, and Jack Rann. [...] These narratives, which transformed Turpin from a pockmarked thug and murderer into [...] "a gentleman of the road [...] a protector of the weak", followed a popular cultural tradition of romanticising English criminals. [...] This practice is reflected in the ballads written about Turpin, the earliest of which, Dick Turpin, would appear to have been published in 1737. [...] Later ballads presented Turpin as an 18th-century Robin Hood figure: [...] "Turpin was caught and his trial was passed, and for a game cock he died at last. [...] Five hundred pounds he gave so free, all to Jack Ketch as a small legacy." ...|$|E

It was Garcia, then, who had an enterprise, and apparently a criminal enterprise, in hand that night in the course of which he met his death. I say 'criminal' because only a man with a criminal enterprise desires <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> <b>an</b> <b>alibi.</b> Who, then, is most likely to have taken his life?

60|$|It is {{probable}} that the young child of Israel, {{if he had been}} attempting any mischief, did not succeed in it. Had there been any trouble, it is likely enough that he would have involved Allen in the grief. Then Allen would have been in a, perhaps, unprecedented position. He could have <b>established</b> <b>an</b> <b>alibi,</b> as far as the Jew's affairs went, by proving that he had been at Blocksby's at the hour when the boy would truthfully have sworn that he had let him into Isaacs' chambers. And, as far as the charge against him at Blocksby's went, the evidence of the young Jew would have gone to prove that he was at Isaacs', where he had no business to be, when we saw him at Blocksby's. But, unhappily, each alibi would have been almost equally compromising. The difficulty never arose, but the reason why Allen refused to give any account of what he had been doing, and where he had been, at four o'clock on that Saturday afternoon--a refusal that told so heavily against him--is now sufficiently clear. His statement would, we may believe, never have been corroborated by the youthful Hebrew, who certainly had his own excellent reasons for silence, and who probably had carefully <b>established</b> <b>an</b> <b>alibi</b> of his own elsewhere.|$|R
