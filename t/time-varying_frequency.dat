30|$|We {{illustrate}} the mathematical background and musical {{use of a}} class of audio effects based on frequency warping. These effects alter the frequency content of a signal via spectral mapping. They can be implemented in dispersive tapped delay lines based on a chain of all-pass filters. In a homogeneous line with first-order all-pass sections, the signal formed by the output samples {{at a given time}} is related to the input via the Laguerre transform. However, most musical signals require a <b>time-varying</b> <b>frequency</b> modification in order to be properly processed. Vibrato in musical instruments or voice intonation in the case of vocal sounds may be modeled as small and slow pitch variations. Simulation of these effects requires techniques for time-varying pitch and/or brightness modification that are very useful for sound processing. The basis for <b>time-varying</b> <b>frequency</b> warping is a time-varying version of the Laguerre transformation. The corresponding implementation structure is obtained as a dispersive tapped delay line, where each of the frequency dependent delay element has its own phase response. Thus, time-varying warping results in a space-varying, inhomogeneous, propagation structure. We show that <b>time-varying</b> <b>frequency</b> warping is associated to an expansion over biorthogonal sets generalizing the discrete Laguerre basis. Slow time-varying characteristics lead to slowly varying parameter sequences. The corresponding sound transformation does not suffer from discontinuities typical of delay lines based on unit delays.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{conventional}} time–frequency analysis (TFA) methods, including continuous wavelet transform, short-time Fourier transform, and Wigner–Ville distribution, {{have played}} {{important roles in}} analyzing nonstationary signals. However, they often show less capability in dealing with nonstationary signals with <b>time-varying</b> <b>frequency</b> due to the bad energy concentration in the time–frequency plane.

Successful classification of SCG signals in health and disease depends on accurate signal characterization and feature extraction. One approach of determining signal features is to estimate its time-frequency characteristics. In this regard, four different time-frequency distribution (TFD) approaches were used including short-time Fourier transform (STFT), polynomial chirplet transform (PCT), Wigner-Ville distribution (WVD), and smoothed pseudo Wigner-Ville distribution (SPWVD). Synthetic SCG signals with known time-frequency properties were generated and {{used to evaluate the}} accuracy of the different TFDs in extracting SCG spectral characteristics. Using different TFDs, the instantaneous frequency (IF) of each synthetic signal was determined and the error (NRMSE) in estimating IF was calculated.
