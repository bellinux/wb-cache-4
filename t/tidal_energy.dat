5|$|Most of {{the islands}} have a bedrock formed from Old Red Sandstone, which is about 400 million years old, and was laid down in the Devonian period.

25|$|The main {{environmental}} concern with <b>tidal</b> <b>energy</b> {{is associated with}} blade strike and entanglement of marine organisms as high speed water {{increases the risk of}} organisms being pushed near or through these devices. As with all offshore renewable energies, there is also a concern about how the creation of EMF and acoustic outputs may affect marine organisms. It should be noted that because these devices are in the water, the acoustic output can be greater than those created with offshore wind energy. Depending on the frequency and amplitude of sound generated by the <b>tidal</b> <b>energy</b> devices, this acoustic output can have varying effects on marine mammals (particularly those who echolocate to communicate and navigate in the marine environment, such as dolphins and whales). <b>Tidal</b> <b>energy</b> removal can also cause {{environmental concern}}s such as degrading farfield water quality and disrupting sediment processes.

25|$|Although not yet widely used, <b>tidal</b> <b>energy</b> has {{potential}} for future electricity generation. Tides are more predictable than {{the wind and}} the sun. Among sources of renewable energy, <b>tidal</b> <b>energy</b> has traditionally suffered from relatively high cost and limited availability of sites with sufficiently high tidal ranges or flow velocities, thus constricting its total availability. However, many recent technological developments and improvements, both in design (e.g. dynamic tidal power, tidal lagoons) and turbine technology (e.g. new axial turbines, cross flow turbines), indicate that the total availability of tidal power may be much higher than previously assumed, and that economic and environmental costs may be brought down to competitive levels.|$|E

40|$|<b>Tidal</b> current <b>energy</b> has {{attracted}} {{more and more}} attentions of coastal engineers in recent years, mainly due to its advantages of low environmental impact, long-term predictability, and large energy potential. In this study, a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model is applied to predict the distribution of mean density of <b>tidal</b> current <b>energy</b> and to determine a suitable site for energy exploitation in Jiangsu Coast. The simulation results including water elevation and tidal current (speed and direction) were validated with measured data, showing a reasonable agreement. Then, the model {{was used to evaluate}} the distribution of mean density of <b>tidal</b> current <b>energy</b> during springtide and neap tide in Jiangsu Coast. Considering the discontinuous performance of tidal current turbine, a new concept for assessing <b>tidal</b> current <b>energy</b> is introduced with three parameters: total operating time, dispersion of operating time, and mean operating time of tidal current turbine.

In order to explore the influences from the runner’s blade airfoil towards its hydrodynamic performance, three-dimensional unsteady flow numerical simulation on four airfoils of straight blade H type of <b>tidal</b> current <b>energy</b> turbines was carried out, under the precondition of same turbine compactness. Through investigating the influences from the four different airfoils of H blade towards the runner {{in terms of its}} dynamic torque feature and hydropower utilization coefficient, this research has analyzed the hydrodynamic performance of the <b>tidal</b> current <b>energy</b> turbine. As the research result indicates, the maximum dynamic torque value of the single-blade turbine with NACA 0015 airfoil is significantly higher than that of the other three airfoils; while the maximum value of the overall runner torque is determined by the operating conditions such as different stream speed etc. As a whole, hydropower utilization coefficient of the turbine with asymmetric airfoil NACA 4415 is better than that of the other three airfoils.

40|$|Interest in {{renewable}} energy in Ireland has increased continually {{over the past}} decade. This interest is due primarily to security of supply issues {{and the effects of}} climate change. Ireland imports over 90 % of its primary energy consumption, mostly in the form of fossil fuels. The exploitation of Ireland’s vast indigenous {{renewable energy}} resources is required in order to reduce this over dependence on fossil fuel imports to meet energy demand. Various targets have been set by the Irish government to incorporate renewable energy technologies into Ireland’s energy market. As a result of these targets, the development in wind energy has increased substantially over the past decade; however this method of energy extraction is intermittent and unpredictable. Ireland has an excellent <b>tidal</b> current <b>energy</b> resource and the use of this resource will assist {{in the development of a}} sustainable energy future. <b>Energy</b> extraction using <b>tidal</b> current <b>energy</b> technologies offers a vast and predictable energy resource. This paper reviews the currently-accepted <b>tidal</b> current <b>energy</b> resource assessment for Ireland. This assessment was compiled by Sustainable Energy Ireland in a report in 2004. The assessment employed a 2 -dimensional numerical model of the tidal current velocities around Ireland, and from this numerical model the theoretical <b>tidal</b> current <b>energy</b> resource was identified. With the introduction of constraints and limitations, the technical, practical, accessible and viable <b>tidal</b> current <b>energy</b> resources were obtained.

40|$|The thesis {{discusses}} {{the environmental impacts}} and developmental constraints of <b>tidal</b> current <b>energy.</b> Using an iterative approach and drawing upon {{a number of different}} methodologies the thesis attempts to evaluate the development potential of <b>tidal</b> current <b>energy</b> in terms of the resource and identify the potential environmental impacts. In addition, it attempts to identify the barriers to development that may be preventing the growth of the industry. The thesis also assesses further research requirements in terms of environmental and social barriers to development, focusing on an environmental impact methodology and its importance in <b>tidal</b> current <b>energy</b> development. Over recent years there has been a significant acceleration in <b>tidal</b> current <b>energy</b> research and development. The key challenge is for technologies to reach full commercialisation. The thesis investigates present market and industrial accessibility and due to institutional and environmental barriers, concludes that commerciality will be hard to achieve if such 'barriers' are not broken. However, the skills and capability base in the UK offshore industry and indeed the renewable energy sector is significant and this should be utilised accordingly. This vision of commercialisation needs to be sustained and a culture of forward thinking needs to be continuously cultivated. In essence, the UK cannot afford to miss this opportunity, both in terms of R&D status, economic stability, energy diversity and security of supply and in time export potential. The thesis identifies key environmental issues concerning <b>tidal</b> current <b>energy</b> development using a site-specific case study and highlights the misconception that renewable energies are without environmental impact. It is clear that some are well understood within the realm of other offshore industries, however, some are relatively unique to this type of development and the need for further research is evident in these areas, in order to dispel the environmental impact uncertainties that exist. The thesis also demonstrates that there are 'process gaps' within Environmental Impact Assessment and attempts to develop an environmental impact assessment framework to aid the <b>tidal</b> current <b>energy</b> development process.

In the second, the impoundment dams are expensive to construct, natural water cycles are completely disrupted, ship navigation is disrupted. However, with multiple ponds, power can be generated at chosen times. So far, there are few installed systems for tidal power generation (most famously, La Rance at Saint Malo, France) which face many difficulties.

The <b>tidal</b> current <b>energy</b> resources off southern and western Korea were calculated using 29 -day in situ observation data from 264 stations. The resultant annual energy densities found at each station were categorized into six groups, with a greater percentage of sites falling into the lower-energy groups: 1. 1 % for &gt; 10 MWh·m− 2; 2. 7 % for 5 to 10 MWh·m− 2; 6. 8 % for 3 to 5 MWh·m− 2; 9. 1 % for 2 to 3 MWh·m− 2 and 80. 3 % for &lt; 2 MWh·m− 2. Analysis shows that the greatest concentration of high annual energy densities occurs in the Jeonnam Province coastal region on the western tip of southwest Korea: 23 MWh·m− 2 at Uldolmok, 15 MWh·m− 2 at Maenggol Sudo, 9. 2  MWh·m− 2 at Geocha Sudo and 8. 8 MWh·m− 2 at Jaingjuk Sudo. The second highest annual energy density concentration, with 16 MWh·m− 2, was found in Gyudong Suro, in Gyeonggi Province’s Gyeonggi Bay. We then used data from the 264 stations to examine the effect of perigean and apogean influences on <b>tidal</b> current <b>energy</b> density evaluations. Compared to derivations using month-long records, mean annual energy densities derived using 15 -day perigean spring-neap current records alone overestimate the annual mean energy by around 10 % whereas those derived using only the apogean records underestimate energy by around 12 %. In particular, accuracy of the S 2 contribution to the energy density calculations is significantly affected by use of the 15 -day data sets, compared to the M 2 component, which is relatively consistent. Further, annual energy density estimates derived from 29 -day records but excluding the N 2 constituent underestimate the potential resource by about 5. 4 %. Results indicate that one month of data is required to accurately estimate <b>tidal</b> current <b>energy</b> in regimes showing pronounced perigean and apogean differences in spring-neap tidal current patterns and that inclusion of the N 2 constituent in calculations is preferable.
