5|$|The whole {{dramatic}} {{moral of}} Coriolanus {{is that those}} who have little shall have less, and {{that those who have}} much shall take all that others have left. The people are poor; <b>therefore</b> <b>they</b> ought to be starved. They are slaves; <b>therefore</b> <b>they</b> ought to be beaten. They work hard; <b>therefore</b> <b>they</b> ought to be treated like beasts of burden. They are ignorant; <b>therefore</b> <b>they</b> ought not to be allowed to feel that they want food, or clothing, or rest, that they are enslaved, oppressed, and miserable. This is the logic of the imagination and the passions; which seek to aggrandise what excites admiration and to heap contempt on misery, to raise power into tyranny, and to make tyranny absolute; to thrust down that which is low still lower, and to make wretches desperate: to exalt magistrates into kings, kings into gods; to degrade subjects to the rank of slaves, and slaves to the condition of brutes. The history of mankind is a romance, a mask, a tragedy, constructed upon the principles of poetical justice; it is a noble or royal hunt, in which what is sport to the few is death to the many, and in which the spectators halloo and encourage the strong to set upon the weak, and cry havoc in the chase though they do not share in the spoil. We may depend upon it that what men delight to read in books, they will put in practice in reality.|$|E
5|$|Arguably {{the first}} {{exposition}} of empirical materialism {{in the history}} of philosophy is in the Cārvāka school (also called Lokāyata). The Cārvāka school rejected the existence of anything but matter (which they defined as being made up of the four elements), including God and the soul. <b>Therefore,</b> <b>they</b> held that even consciousness was nothing but a construct made up of atoms. A section of the Cārvāka school believed in a material soul made up of air or breath, but since this also was a form of matter, it was not said to survive death.|$|E

5|$|Dendritic cells (DC) are phagocytes in tissues {{that are}} {{in contact with the}} {{external}} environment; <b>therefore,</b> <b>they</b> are located mainly in the skin, nose, lungs, stomach, and intestines. They are named for their resemblance to neuronal dendrites, as both have many spine-like projections, but dendritic cells are in no way connected to the nervous system. Dendritic cells serve as a link between the bodily tissues and the innate and adaptive immune systems, as they present antigens to T cells, one of the key cell types of the adaptive immune system.|$|E
5|$|Nanofibers of {{dysprosium}} compounds {{have high}} strength {{and a large}} surface area. <b>Therefore,</b> <b>they</b> {{can be used to}} reinforce other materials and act as a catalyst. Fibers of dysprosium oxide fluoride can be produced by heating an aqueous solution of DyBr3 and NaF to 450°C at 450 bars for 17 hours. This material is remarkably robust, surviving over 100 hours in various aqueous solutions at temperatures exceeding 400°C without redissolving or aggregating.|$|E
60|$|The Princess {{thought this}} sounded like good reasoning, and consented to set out. There were some {{beautiful}} {{mountains to the}} south-east; and among these, the Absolute Fool declared, a prince of good taste would be very apt to dwell. <b>They,</b> <b>therefore,</b> took this direction. But when they had travelled an hour or more, the mountains began to look bare and bleak, and the Absolute Fool declared {{that he did not}} believe any prince would live there. He <b>therefore</b> advised that <b>they</b> turn into a road that led to the north-east. It was a good road; and therefore he thought it led to a good place, where a person of good sense would be likely to reside. Along this road <b>they</b> <b>therefore</b> travelled. <b>They</b> had ridden but a few miles when they met three men, well armed and mounted. These men drew up their horses, and respectfully saluted the Princess.|$|R

5|$|PEV is a {{subcategory}} {{of electric}} vehicles that includes battery electric vehicles (BEVs), plug-in hybrid vehicles, (PHEVs), and electric vehicle conversions of hybrid electric vehicles and conventional {{internal combustion engine}} vehicles. Even though conventional hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) have a battery that is continually recharged with power from {{the internal combustion engine}} and regenerative braking, they can not be recharged from an off-vehicle electric energy source, and <b>therefore,</b> <b>they</b> do not belong to the category of plug-in electric vehicles.|$|E
5|$|People who owe 3,800,000 Lebanese Pounds ($2,500) or more {{in child}} support, are not {{eligible}} to receive a Lebanese passport. <b>Therefore,</b> <b>they</b> should make arrangements to pay the agency where child support is owed before they submit their application for a Lebanese passport.

5|$|Several egg {{clutches}} of C. dughii are known, containing {{as many as}} 25 fossilized eggs. Unfortunately, taphonomical alterations (changes during the fossilization process) {{make it difficult to}} determine the original structure of the nest. Cousin (2002) hypothesized that Cairanoolithus eggs were laid {{on the surface of the}} ground, possibly buried beneath a mound of plant matter. Tanaka et al. (2015) noted that the shell had a high rate of water vapor conductance. <b>Therefore,</b> <b>they</b> concluded that Cairanoolithus nests were covered by organic or inorganic material, similar to modern eggs with high vapor conductance.|$|E

5000|$|The term [...] "Continuing Anglicanism" [...] {{refers to}} a number of church bodies which have formed outside of the Anglican Communion in the belief that {{traditional}} forms of Anglican faith, worship and order have been unacceptably revised or abandoned within some Anglican Communion churches in recent decades. <b>They</b> <b>therefore</b> claim that <b>they</b> are [...] "continuing" [...] traditional Anglicanism.|$|R

5|$|The family Columbidae {{previously}} {{also contained}} the family Raphidae, {{consisting of the}} extinct Rodrigues solitaire and the dodo. These species are in all likelihood part of the Indo-Australian radiation that produced the three small subfamilies mentioned above, with the fruit doves and pigeons (including the Nicobar pigeon). <b>Therefore,</b> <b>they</b> are here included as a subfamily Raphinae, pending better material evidence of their exact relationships.|$|E
5|$|Valve {{considered}} {{adding a}} competitive mode to Portal 2. According to Wolpaw, the mode {{was similar to}} the video game Speedball; one team would try to transport a ball {{from one side of the}} playing field to the other using portals, while the other team would attempt to stop them with their own use of portals. Matches would commence with this objective in mind, but quickly descended into chaos. Valve realized that people enjoyed solving puzzles with portals more and <b>therefore</b> <b>they</b> focused on the cooperative mode.|$|E

5|$|While the {{development}} of wings in insects is clearly defined in those {{who are members of}} Endopterygota, which undergo complete metamorphosis; in these species, the wing develops while in the pupal stage of the insects life cycle. However, insects that undergo incomplete metamorphosis do not have a pupal stage, <b>therefore</b> <b>they</b> must have a different wing morphogenesis. Insects such as those that are hemimetabolic have wings that start out as buds, which are found underneath the exoskeleton, and do not become exposed until the last instar of the nymph.|$|E
5|$|A 2002 study {{conducted}} by CARE International across three districts in the Central Region of Malawi considers how HIV/AIDS has affected economic well-being in rural Malawi. When skilled laborers are infected with HIV, they are usually unable to work; <b>therefore,</b> <b>they</b> often shift agricultural production on their land to less labor-intensive crops, sacrificing the opportunity to grow more profitable, labor-intensive crops such as tobacco. When family members fall ill with HIV/AIDS, their relatives invest time in their treatment and care, further reducing household productivity. In addition, when family members are infected with HIV, households often use the money they would normally invest in agriculture to cover medical expenses, further decreasing economic stability at the household level. Finally, when adults contract HIV, their children often remain home from school {{to work in the}} fields, threatening long-term productivity and economic advancement in Malawi.|$|E
5|$|A {{natural setting}} for problem of Apollonius is inversive geometry. The basic {{strategy}} of inversive methods is to transform a given Apollonius problem into another Apollonius {{problem that is}} simpler to solve; the solutions to the original problem are found from the solutions of the transformed problem by undoing the transformation. Candidate transformations must change one Apollonius problem into another; <b>therefore,</b> <b>they</b> must transform the given points, circles and lines to other points, circles and lines, and no other shapes. Circle inversion has this property and allows the center and radius of the inversion circle to be chosen judiciously. Other candidates include the Euclidean plane isometries; however, they do not simplify the problem, since they merely shift, rotate, and mirror the original problem.|$|E
