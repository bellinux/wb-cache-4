5|$|Justice Stevens wrote a brief {{dissenting opinion}} {{arguing that the}} case should have been {{dismissed}} because the Illinois legislature has largely reduced penalties for marijuana possession, which made it ridiculous for the officers <b>to</b> <b>rush</b> <b>to</b> get a warrant. He said {{that even if he}} reached the merits of the question, he would affirm and hold the search unconstitutional because the majority misapplied a balancing of “privacy-related and law enforcement-related concerns". He wanted to give broader protection to the idea of the home as a place for protection, even if the home in this case was a trailer.|$|E
5|$|Stone {{enters the}} space station via an airlock. She cannot re-establish {{communication}} with Kowalski and concludes that she is now the sole survivor. Inside the station, a fire breaks out, forcing her <b>to</b> <b>rush</b> <b>to</b> the Soyuz. As she maneuvers the capsule away from the ISS, the tangled parachute tethers prevent it from separating from the station. Stone performs a spacewalk in order to release the cables, succeeding just as the debris field completes its orbit and destroys the station. Stone aligns the Soyuz with Tiangong, but discovers that Soyuz's engine has no fuel.|$|E

5|$|The {{first people}} <b>to</b> <b>rush</b> <b>to</b> the goldfields, {{beginning}} {{in the spring of}} 1848, were the residents of California themselves—primarily agriculturally oriented Americans and Europeans living in Northern California, along with Native Americans and some Californios (Spanish-speaking Californians). These first miners tended to be families in which everyone helped in the effort. Women and children of all ethnicities were often found panning next to the men. Some enterprising families set up boarding houses to accommodate the influx of men; in such cases, the women often brought in steady income while their husbands searched for gold.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the conclave, Alessandro Farnese, the cardinal-nephew of Paul III, and his faction of four or five {{cardinals}} (including Ranuccio Farnese and Guido Ascanio Sforza), whom Guise had counted among the French faction, began supporting the second choice of the Holy Roman Emperor, Reginald Pole, apparently having received assurances that Ottavio Farnese's claim to the Duchy of Parma would be supported by Charles V. On December 5, Pole received twenty-six votes, only two short of the requisite two-thirds majority, prompting French ambassador Claude d'Urfé <b>to</b> <b>rush</b> <b>to</b> the door of the conclave, demanding that the conclave wait for the French cardinals, whom he claimed were in Corsica, and threatening that the election of a pope in their absence would be likely to cause a schism.|$|E
5|$|Rossi {{struggled}} with severe tyre degradation and increasingly locked and flat-spotted his tyres. Vandoorne had reduced Rossi's lead by the penultimate lap. He chose not <b>to</b> <b>rush</b> <b>to</b> avoid damaging his car. He {{moved into the}} lead after leaving the back straight when Rossi ran wide at the first hairpin. Haryanto made a similar strategy call as Vandoorne and passed King and Rossi to move into second position. Vandoorne maintained the lead {{for the remainder of}} the race and crossed the start/finish line after 32 laps to win the race. Haryanto finished second, with Rossi in third. King took fourth, ahead of Visoiu and Evans. Berthon, Leal, Negrão, and Matsushita rounded out the top-ten finishers. Eleventh-place finisher Stöckinger became the first driver from the Philippines to complete a GP2 Series race. He was ahead of Sirotkin, Markelov, Canamasas, and Stanaway. Amberg, Binder, de Jong and Lynn were the last of the classified finishers.|$|E

5|$|The Rhine Campaign of 1796 saw Moreau's army {{facing the}} Austrian Army of the Upper Rhine under Maximilian Anton Karl, Count Baillet de Latour in the south. Meanwhile, Jean-Baptiste Jourdan's French Army of Sambre-et-Meuse opposed the Army of the Lower Rhine under Archduke Charles in the north. Jourdan drubbed Duke Ferdinand Frederick Augustus of Württemberg at Altenkirchen on 4 June, {{compelling}} Archduke Charles <b>to</b> <b>rush</b> <b>to</b> the rescue with reinforcements. Charles defeated Jourdan at Wetzlar on the 15th, {{forcing him to}} pull back {{to the west bank}} of the Rhine. At this time there was a shake up in the high command and the archduke was put in control of both Austrian armies. In Charles' absence, Moreau successfully crossed the Rhine at Kehl on the night of 23–24 June and beat Latour at Rastatt on 5 July. Leaving Wilhelm von Wartensleben in charge in the north, Charles rushed south to confront Moreau along the Alb River near Ettlingen. After an all-day combat, the Austrians held the advantage on their right wing near Malsch, but the French had defeated their left wing in the Black Forest.|$|E
5|$|There were {{numerous}} reports in southern Mississippi of embedded tornadoes that exacerbated the hurricane's effects. Reports in Gulfport indicated that three schools actively {{being used as}} hurricane shelters were struck and damaged by tornadoes. At one location, almost 400 people being housed in a school had <b>to</b> <b>rush</b> <b>to</b> safety before part of its roof collapsed. Another apparent tornado sideswiped a senior citizens' center, endangering nearly 200 people in a structure that sustained damage to windows, doors, and part of its roof; about 20 people required rescue by paramedics. Only minor injuries occurred {{in association with the}} possible tornadoes. Teams of experts tasked with reviewing the validity of tornado reports were largely unable to prove that {{a significant portion of the}} damage in southern Mississippi had been done by tornadoes. As a result, few tornadoes were confirmed, and it is likely that most of the damage in the region resulted from squall-like winds that are part of an intense hurricane's nature, or potentially localized microbursts. Any unconfirmed tornadoes would have been no stronger than the hurricane's synoptic winds.|$|E

25|$|Being {{suspended}} {{upside down}} {{can be a}} very hard position to maintain {{as a result of the}} position causing the blood <b>to</b> <b>rush</b> <b>to</b> the head. This means that this position probably cannot be maintained for any length of time and can even lead to the person blacking out. To be suspended in this position, ropes or suspension cuffs are used to lift the person into the air by their ankles.|$|E
25|$|The War Office {{contacted}} Matthews in February 1924 {{to request}} a demonstration of his ray. Matthews did not reply to them but spoke to journalists and demonstrated the ray to a Star reporter by igniting gunpowder from a distance. He still refused to say how the ray actually worked, just insisted that it did. When the British government still refused <b>to</b> <b>rush</b> <b>to</b> buy his ideas, {{he announced that he}} had an offer from France.|$|E
25|$|At UMNO's general {{assembly}} in 2002, Mahathir {{announced that he}} would resign as prime minister, only for supporters <b>to</b> <b>rush</b> <b>to</b> the stage and convince him tearfully to remain. He subsequently fixed his retirement for October 2003, giving him time to ensure an orderly and uncontroversial transition to his anointed successor, Abdullah Badawi. Having spent over 22 years in office, Mahathir was the world's longest-serving elected leader when he retired. He remains Malaysia's longest-serving prime minister.|$|E

25|$|Mạc Đăng Dung's {{seizure of}} the throne {{prompted}} other {{families of the}} aristocracy, notably the Nguyễn and Trinh, <b>to</b> <b>rush</b> <b>to</b> {{the support of the}} Le. With the usurpation of the throne, the civil war broke out anew. Again the Nguyễn and the Trịnh gathered an army and fought against Mạc Đăng Dung, this time under the leadership of Nguyễn Kim and Trịnh Kiểm. The Trịnh and the Nguyễn were nominally fighting on behalf of the Lê emperor but in reality, for their own power.|$|E
25|$|Adrian VI {{experienced}} {{ill health}} {{during the final}} months of his life, inspiring the cardinals to begin politicking. Francis I of France had just dispatched a large army into northern Italy in 1522, and expecting to leverage this force to effect the election of French cardinal Jean de Lorraine, or more likely a pro-French Italian cardinal such as Niccolò Fieschi. However, his army experienced a major defeat at the Battle of Bicocca prior to the conclave. In any case, the three French cardinals were ordered by Francis I <b>to</b> <b>rush</b> <b>to</b> Rome.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the winter}} of 1939–1940, Gamelin altered Plan D with the Breda variant, an advance into the Netherlands to Breda in North Brabant. The Seventh Army, the most {{powerful}} element of the French strategic reserve, {{was added to the}} 1st Army Group close to the coast, <b>to</b> <b>rush</b> <b>to</b> the Scheldt Estuary and Holland, link with the Dutch army at Tilburg or Breda if that were not possible. Some of the best divisions of the French army were moved north, when elite units of the German army transferred south for the new version of Fall Gelb, an invasion through the Ardennes.|$|E

25|$|Over the {{following}} week, Napoleon won all the {{battles of the}} Six Days' Campaign, inflicting very heavy casualties on Blücher's army. After his victories, the French emperor had <b>to</b> <b>rush</b> <b>to</b> {{the help of his}} forces defending the Seine River. These troops had been pushed back by a second Allied army led by Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg. Already, Napoleon ordered MacDonald to Guignes where he arrived on the evening of 14 February with 12,000 troops, including reinforcements. Trelliard's division arrived at Guignes on 16 February, fresh from the Spanish front. At this time, Kellermann's corps was not yet fully formed. Altogether there would be 4,200 horsemen in the divisions of Jacquinot, Trelliard and Roussel.|$|E
25|$|On December 14, 1893, Albert Willis {{arrived in}} Honolulu aboard the USRC Corwin unannounced, {{bringing}} an anticipation of an American invasion {{to restore the}} monarchy, which {{became known as the}} Black Week. Willis was the successor to James Blount as United States Minister to Hawaii. With the hysteria of a military assault, he staged a mock invasion with the USS Adams and USS Philadelphia, directing their guns toward the capital. He also ordered rear admiral John Irwin to organize a landing operation using troops on the two American ships, which was joined by the Japanese Naniwa and the British HMS Champion. After the arrival of the Corwin, the provisional government and citizens of Hawaii were ready <b>to</b> <b>rush</b> <b>to</b> arms if necessary, but it was widely believed that Willis' threat of force was a bluff.|$|E
25|$|Darwin {{returned}} from Malvern {{at the end}} of June 1850 to a reawakening of his fears that his illness might be hereditary. His bright nine-year-old daughter Anne who had become a particular favourite and comfort to him fell sick. She was miserable for weeks on end, then became feverish. Their doctor could do nothing and thought it might be inherited. She had recovered to some extent by March 1851, but then she and her father were both laid low by influenza. Darwin recovered but Annie was still ill, and on 24 March he took her to Malvern, leaving her there for the best treatment he knew of, and returning to Downe where Emma had stayed as she was pregnant. With his first paper on barnacles printed and Hooker safely returned to Britain laden with specimens, things were looking up, but then on 15 April Annie suffered a serious relapse and Darwin had <b>to</b> <b>rush</b> <b>to</b> her side.|$|E
