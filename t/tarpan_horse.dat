5|$|Remains {{of prehistoric}} horses {{have been found}} in the Poitou region, with Mesolithic remains (20,000 to 5,000 BC) located near Surgères and Échiré. Some enthusiasts claim that the Poitevin horse is descended {{directly}} from these horses, based on physical similarities, and claim a common origin with the <b>Tarpan</b> <b>horse</b> painted on the Lascaux cave walls. However, this has not been confirmed by scientific studies, and numerous claims by other horse breeds of this same relationship have been invalidated by further research. Other horses were probably brought to the area by migrating Celts, and there is a record from the 10th century of a bishop from Rome asking the Count of Poitou for a mare from the region. These horses, like mules, were a favorite among the magistrates and ecclesiastical personnel in the medieval era, and were sold around Niort, Saint-Maixent, Auvergne, Dauphiné, Languedoc and in Spain. The number of horses in the area, however, was not well known before the 17th century.|$|E
2500|$|The human-caused {{extinction}} of the tarpan began in Southern Europe, possibly in antiquity. [...] While humans had been hunting wild horses since the Paleolithic, during historic times horse meat {{was an important}} source of protein for many cultures. As large herbivores, the range of the tarpan was continuously decreased by the increasing civilization of the Eurasian continent. Wild horses were further persecuted because they caused damage to hay storages and often took domestic mares from pastures.

50|$|Besides genetic differences, osteological {{evidence}} {{from across the}} Eurasian wild horse range, based on cranial and metacarpal differences, indicates the presence of only two subspecies in postglacial times, the <b>tarpan</b> and Przewalski's <b>horse.</b>|$|R
40|$|Physical {{disposition}} determine horse´s {{capabilities of}} performance. Mental {{character of a}} horse basically controls his behaviour through instincts, which were obtained during {{millions of years of}} evolution. Effects of instincts can be enhanced or softened by highly developed senses. Thanks to this special combination, mankind tends to give horse an unique approach. Every individual is different and the temper may vary, it also depends on a breed. Temper determines his behaviour towards other horses and people as well, it sets prerequisitions for further use of a horse, f. e. active horses of breed A 1 / 1 (Thoroughbred) {{are much more likely to}} be used as a racehorse than the phlegmatic ones. Horses can be divided by geografic origin into 4 groups: A group of Mongolian horses (prairie) A group of horses Eastern (Oriental), the ancestor of the <b>tarpan</b> a) subgroup <b>horses</b> Iran b) subgroup <b>horses</b> <b>tarpans</b> c) Arabian <b>horses</b> subgroup of type d) subset horses English Group of western horses, their ancestor's western type horse (now extinct) A group of horses Nordic (Nordic) Other division can be made by temper: Coldblooded horses, Equus robustus is the ancestor, neco, calm, obedient, mostly used for work. Hotblooded horses, Equus ferus is the ancestor, neco, vital, used as a sport horses. Can be purebred or crossbred. (in this context, crossbred only with certain allowed breeds...|$|R
5000|$|Before {{they were}} driven to extinction, large herbivores {{in this part}} of Europe {{included}} the <b>tarpan</b> (wild <b>horse),</b> wisent (European bison), red deer (elk or wapiti in North America) and aurochs (wild cattle). The tarpan and aurochs are extinct, but Konik ponies and Heck cattle are able to act as functional equivalents, occupying a similar ecological niche. The only native large herbivores now missing from Oostvaardersplassen are the elk (moose in North America), the wild boar and the wisent. [...] There is a chance that the wild boar will find its way naturally from the Veluwe.|$|R

50|$|Present-day {{fallow deer}} populations in Europe {{are a result}} of {{historic}} man-made introductions of this species, first to the Mediterranean regions of Europe, then eventually to the rest of Europe. They were initially park animals that later escaped and reestablished themselves in the wild. Historically, Europe's deer species shared their deciduous forest habitat with other herbivores, such as the extinct <b>tarpan</b> (forest <b>horse),</b> extinct aurochs (forest ox), and the endangered wisent (European bison). Good places to see deer in Europe include the Scottish Highlands, the Austrian Alps, the wetlands between Austria, Hungary, and the Czech Republic and some fine National Parks, including Doñana National Park in Spain, the Veluwe in the Netherlands, the Ardennes in Belgium, and Białowieża National Park of Poland. Spain, Eastern Europe, and the Caucasus Mountains still have virgin forest areas that are not only home to sizable deer populations but also for other animals that were once abundant such as the wisent, Eurasian lynx, Iberian lynx, wolves, and brown bears.|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] l. Genetic {{variants}} {{at eight}} blood loci were analysed, isclosing in Andalusian breed six rare markers: variants J of transferrin, H of esterase, D and S of Xk, M and W of prealbumin. 2. Two of these, Tf J and Pr M appear as characteristic markers of Andalusian breed. 3. Allelic frequencies showed minor differences between Spanish (300 horses) and Lusitanian (100 horses) populations. 4. Comparison was established with historically related breeds, Thoroughbreds or Connemara, nd with Arab horses {{because of a}} presumed relationship. 5. No visible similarities ingenetic profiles were found with two former breeds, nor with Arab horses. 6. Unpredicted similarities were found however between <b>Tarpans</b> and Andalusian <b>horses,</b> appearing rather as convergences than witnessing a common ancestry...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{investigates the}} bio-geographical imaginations behind the animal 'back-breeding' {{programs}} {{carried out by}} Lutz and Heinz Heck - two influential German zoologists who ran Berlin and Munich zoos. Partly with close connections to and patronage from the National Socialist elite, the Heck brothers sought to resurrect the wild cow (aurochs) and <b>horse</b> (<b>tarpan)</b> by breeding out the degeneration they associated with domestication. These back-bred animals were released during the war to roam the expanding territory of the Third Reich, and figured in propaganda films and newspaper articles legitimating that expansion. Drawing on archive material, this chapter situates these back-breeding initiatives {{in relation to the}} emerging field of geopolitics. It traces how the project to recreate extinct primordial wildlife functioned as part of discourses and practices of nature conservation that emphasized the ideal Germanic character of the European landscape and required ethnic cleansing as a form of ecological restoration. The chapter describes how back breeding of primordial wildlife was part of a legitimation of the violent Eastern expansion, emanating from a particular combination of mythological, geographic and ecological imaginations, not merely aiming for industrial and agricultural autarky but also to extend the Nazi governance of landscape conservation...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the genetic variability within Cylicocyclus nassatus (Nematoda, Strongylida, Cyathostominae) collected from different domestic and wild hosts (i. e. horse, donkey, Przewalskii <b>horse,</b> <b>tarpan</b> and Turkmen kulan) and localities in Europe and/or USA. The ribosomal Internal Transcribed Spacer 2 (ITS 2) and the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox 1) gene were PCR-amplified and sequences characterized from seventy individual parasitic specimens. While ITS 2 displayed 0 - 0. 6 % variation rate among all individual adult specimens of C. nassatus examined, 22 different sequence variants (haplotypes) of cox 1 were detected. Nucleotide variation was detected at 75 of the total 689 positions (overall 10. 8 % rate of intraspecific nucletidic difference) in the cox 1, with the absence of invariable positions among specimens collected from each equid species or country. Conversely, two haplotypes were detected in horses from USA and in donkeys of Italy and Ukraine, respectively. The absence of haplotypes shared by the equid species suggests an affiliation of C. nassatus populations to their specific host. The {{results of the present}} study demonstrated that the characterization of mitochondrial regions may have important implications for studying the genetic structure and biology of equine cyathostomes, and to exploit taxonomic issues and practical implications related to the spread of anthelmintic resistance...|$|R
