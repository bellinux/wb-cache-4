There has been some debate as to the intention of the park and whether it was a dedication to the slaves that were thrown overboard during the journey through the Middle Passage from West Africa to the Americas. In response the artist says “It was never my intention to have any connection to the Middle passage. Although it was not my intention from the outset I am very encouraged how it has resonated differently within various communities and feel it is working as an art piece by questioning our identity, history and stimulating debate.”- Jason de Caires Taylor.|$|E

40|$|The {{study was}} carried out to of {{determine}} the extent to which <b>total</b> <b>weigh</b> of broiler birds is explained by feed intake, mortality rate and floor space during the first four weeks, second four weeks and the eight weeks of rearing. Twenty-nine farms were purposively selected for the study. Relevant information in feed intake, feed price, mortality rate, floor space and price of live broiler were obtained. Data were collected from market surveys, farm records and direct measurements of weight and floor space using weighing balance and measuring tapes. Data analysis involved the use if descriptive statistics and ordinary least squares method. The linear models provided the lead equations for the first four and second four weeks of rearing while the double-log model provided the lead equation for the entire eight weeks of rearing. The variation explained 97, 92 and 98 % of total variation in broiler weight gain during the first and second weeks and eight weeks of rearing respectively. Findings show that feed intake and floor space affected weight gain positively while mortality rate affected it negatively. The results further showed that the farms were not efficient in their production with regards to the amount of feed given to the broilers. The study recommends that, farms should increase the amount of feed given to broiler to maximize weight gain...|$|E
40|$|Physical and {{chemical}} characterization of several {{sizes and shapes}} of alkaline and saline spent Zn–MnO 2 batteries was carried out, aiming at contributing for a better definition of the applicable recycling processes. The characterization essays included the mass balance of the components, cathode and anode elemental analysis, the identification of zinc and manganese bearing phases and the morphology analysis of the electrode particles. The electrode materials correspond to 64 – 79 % of the <b>total</b> <b>weigh</b> of the batteries, with the cathodes having clearly the highest contribution (usually more than 50 %). The steel components, mainly from the cases, are also important (17 – 30 %). Elemental analysis showed that the electrodes are highly concentrated in zinc (from 48 – 87 % in anodes) and manganese (from 35 – 50 % in cathodes). X-Ray powder diffraction allowed for identifying several phases in the electrodes, namely zinc oxide, in the anodes of all the types of saline and alkaline batteries tested, while zinc hydroxide chloride and ammine zinc chloride only appear in some types of saline batteries. The manganese found in the cathode materials is present as two main phases, MnO·Mn 2 O 3 and ZnO·Mn 2 O 3, the latter corroborating that zinc migration from anode to cathode occurs during the batteries lifespan. A unreacted MnO 2 phase was also found presenting a low crystalline level. Leaching trials with diluted HCl solutions of alkaline and saline battery samples showed that all zinc species are reactive attaining easily over than 90 % leaching yields, and about 30 % of manganese, present as Mn(ii/iii) forms. The MnO 2 phase is less reactive and requires higher temperatures to achieve a more efficient solubilization...|$|E

30|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{successfully}} demonstrated the in situ synthesis of AgNPs on the PDMS film {{for use as}} an antibacterial surface. The AgNP–PDMS composite showed high antibacterial activity against representative infectious bacterial growth. Of the total weight of the film, a small amount was represented by silver. Since all of the AgNPs {{were placed on the}} surface of PDMS film, they (~ only 0.048 % of the <b>total</b> <b>weigh</b> of the PDMS film) could act to prevent bacterial growth, resulting in effective antibacterial activity. The oxidative release of Ag+ from Ag 0 NP is known to drive antibacterial actions, such as binding {{to a wide variety of}} targets that contain organic amines, phosphates, thiol-containing proteins, and DNA, and can increase reactive oxygen species and simultaneously perturb many aspects of the cell metabolism [6]. Thus, the release of silver ions can negatively impact the surrounding cells via similar antibacterial actions. Therefore, it is crucial to minimize the cytotoxicity of the antibacterial surface while maintaining its bacterial killing activity. There are several ways to avoid the side effects of AgNPs for uses in medical applications, such as the layer-by-layer technique [22] and plasma immersion ion implantation [23], to prepare AgNP-containing antibacterial polymer films. In a comparison of these methods, the in situ synthesis of AgNPs on the PDMS film presented herein is straightforward and less dependent on instruments. Consequently, it could be easily integrated in the existing manufacturing process of PDMS-based medical devices. Goyal et al. reported an in situ synthesis of AgNP inside of the PDMS film by mixing silver precursors with elastomers and then reducing them [13]. Since most AgNPs were embedded in the film, only 80 and 52 % reduction growth of E. coli and B. subtilis, respectively, was reported. By contrast, we achieved more than a five log 10 reduction of bacteria with a small amount of AgNPs because all AgNPs synthesized in present study were located on the film surface. We believe that our finding could be useful for manufacturing a silicone-based implanting device with antibacterial activity by proving the straightforward and price economically competitive method.|$|E
40|$|O selênio (Se) é um mineral essencial para o bom desempenho zootécnico dos peixes. É poderoso antioxidante, auxilia a homeostase do hormônio da tireoide e potencializa a imunidade e a fertilidade. A digestibilidade e metabolismo do selênio variam {{conforme}} a fonte ingerido. Desta forma, o objetivo deste estudo foi avaliar os efeitos de fontes e níveis de selênio dietário para alevinos e juvenis da tilápia-do-nilo. Usaram-se 36 aquários com 160 litros de água, distribuindo 90 peixes de 0, 135 ± 0, 001 g por aquário. Após 28 dias, reduziu-se a densidade para 15 peixes por aquário. O delineamento foi o inteiramente casualizado, com tratamentos em esquema fatorial (4 x 2) + 1 (quatro níveis e duas fontes de selênio mais um controle), e quatro repetições. Os tratamentos avaliados foram dieta sem suplementação (controle), com suplementação por Se-levedura (0, 25; 0, 50; 0, 75 e 1, 00 mg Se kg- 1 da dieta) e com suplementação de selenito de sódio (Na 2 SeO 3) (0, 25; 0, 50; 0, 75 e 1, 00 mg Se kg- 1 da dieta). Analisaram-se a sobrevivência, o peso, o comprimento, a conversão alimentar aparente, o índice hepatossomático, a uniformidade do lote e a atividade da glutationa peroxidase. Aos 28 dias, o comprimento total foi maior para grupos suplementados com selênio, independentemente do nível. Na suplementação com 0, 25 mg Se kg- 1 dieta, Se-levedura foi mais bem comparado ao selenito de sódio. Aos 84 dias, o peso e o comprimento total dos grupos que receberam dietas suplementadas com o mineral foram estatisticamente melhores (15, 5 ± 2, 3 g e 9, 0 ± 0, 4 cm), comparados ao grupo-controle (12, 7 ± 1, 2 g e 8, 3 ± 0, 2 cm), independentemente do nível avaliado.

It was used 36 aquariums, 160 litters each, with 90 fishes of 0. 135 ± 0. 001 g per aquarium. 28 days later the density was reduced to 15 fishes per aquarium. The statistical design was completely randomized, in which the treatments were into a factorial scheme (4 x 2) + 1 (four levels, two sources of selenium, and one control) with four replications. The evaluated treatments were: diet without supplementation (control); diet with Se-yeast and supplementation (0. 25, 0. 50, 0. 75, and 1. 00 mg of Se kg- 1 into the diet) and diet with sodium selenite (Na 2 SeO 3) supplementation (0. 25, 0. 50, 0. 75, and 1. 00 mg of Se kg- 1 into the diet). Surviving, weigh, length, apparent alimentary conversion, hepatosomatic index, lot homogeneity, and the glutathione peroxidase activity were analyzed. At 28 days the total length was higher to the groups supplemented with Se, regardless the Se level.
