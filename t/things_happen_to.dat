25|$|The {{origins of}} Hadaka Matsuri date back 500 years when worshippers competed to receive paper talismans called Go-o thrown by the priest. These paper talismans were tokens of the {{completion}} of New Year ascetic training by the priests. As those people receiving these paper talismans had good <b>things</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> them, {{the number of people}} requesting them increased year by year. However, as paper is easily destroyed, the talismans were changed to the wooden ofuda that we know today.|$|E
25|$|When Mister refuses {{and tries}} to beat her, Celie stands firm and curses him ("I Curse You, Mister"). Harpo then invites Sofia {{to come back and}} live at the Juke Joint, {{reconciling}} with her in the process. Eventually, Mister begins to feel the effect of Celie's curse. Harpo challenges his father to make things right after a bunch of terrible <b>things</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> Mister, which force Mister to try to understand the meaning of Celie's curse and the meaning of life other than his tough childhood. ("Mister's Song/Celie's Curse").|$|E

25|$|The {{problem of}} evil is often phrased in the form: Why do bad <b>things</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> good people?. Christianity teach {{that all people}} are {{inherently}} sinful due to the fall of man and original sin; for example, Calvinist theology follows a doctrine called federal headship, which argues that the first man, Adam, was the legal representative of the entire human race. A counterargument to the basic version of this principle is that an omniscient God would have predicted this, when he created the world, and an omnipotent God could have prevented it.|$|E
500|$|In December 2002, [...] "When Flanders Failed" [...] was {{utilized}} in a Roanoke Presbyterian Church Sunday School class, to stimulate a discussion among {{both children and}} adults, about why unfortunate <b>things</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> good people. Phil Brown, the teacher of the class, said the reason they used episodes of The Simpsons was [...] "to get something that would get the kids excited and {{be more than just}} a traditional Sunday School lecture series." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{cast and}} crew of the episode enjoyed the [...] "amusement park" [...] feel of the story. Gillian Anderson later noted, [...] "Because of all the magic, I was {{constantly}} being entertained. The difficulty with something like this is you have tendency to forget that people are still having bad <b>things</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> them." [...] Anderson later stated that, {{because many of the}} lines were written in a tongue-in-cheek style, she and David Duchovny said them in a humorous style; the two had to keep reminding themselves that the story revolved around a murder.|$|E

500|$|Winsor McCay first {{produced}} Dream of the Rarebit Fiend in 1904, a {{year before}} the dream romps of his Little Nemo and a full generation before the artists of the Surrealist movement unleashed the unconscious on the public. [...] The strip had no recurring characters, but followed a theme: after eating a Welsh rarebit, the day's protagonist would be subject to the darker side of his or her psyche. [...] Typically, the strip would begin with an absurd situation which became more and more absurd until the Fiend—the dreamer—awakened in the final panel. [...] Some situations were merely silly: elephants falling from the ceiling, or two women's mink coats having a fight. [...] Other times, they could be more disturbing: characters finding themselves dismembered, buried alive from a first-person perspective or a child's mother being planted and becoming a tree. [...] In some strips the Fiend was a spectator watching fantastic or horrible <b>things</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> someone close to [...] [...] The protagonists are typically urban bourgeoisie whom McCay subjects to fears of public humiliation or loss of social esteem or respectability.|$|E
500|$|Several {{established}} {{actors were}} {{considered for the}} leading role of Rusty Sabich. Kevin Costner turned down the role, and Robert Redford was vetoed by Pollack due to his age. When he was hired to direct the film, Pakula only offered the role to Harrison Ford, believing that the actor possessed an [...] "Everyman quality" [...] that best suited the character. [...] Ford's casting was confirmed in March 1989. He received a $7 million salary for the role. Turow was initially uncertain of Ford portraying Rusty but relented after seeing {{a few of the}} actor's films. Ford said, [...] "Friends warned me this was a tough role because Rusty is such a passive, interior character. Though Rusty's in every scene, all the action takes place around him. <b>Things</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> him." [...] Upon being cast, Ford read the novel to avoid arguments over events and details that were left out in the book. Ford also suggested to Pakula that Rusty have a buzz cut. He explained, [...] "There are many things I found I could express with that short haircut. Simplest of all, I wanted to tell the audience to leave their baggage at home — not to expect the Harrison Ford they've seen before." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1993, Brown {{decided to}} quit EastEnders after {{becoming}} [...] "discontented" [...] {{with the way}} Dot was portrayed. In 1997 she revealed to the Daily Mirror: [...] "I always felt Dot {{was one of those}} characters who should stay the same. She's a simple creature. There are some people who the same <b>things</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> them again and again. They never learn [...] When I left, there was all that rubbish about it getting too much for me [...] I stopped because I wasn't being used very much. I thought, 'It's a part-time job'. It wasn't being written properly. Instead of finding the gossip and passing it on, [...] [...] was living on a reputation. [...] said to me, 'I loved it when [...] had [...] varicose veins.' I thought: 'What?! That was in 1985, it's 1993!'. I was getting so tetchy, so I thought I'd go. I'd had enough. They were a bit shocked, because apparently there were some good stories coming up." [...] Expanding on this in 2008, Brown stated that she [...] "didn’t like what they were doing with Dot– she was meant to spread the gossip. Originally she was a fountain of knowledge then next thing I know, people are telling Dot what had been happening and I thought, ‘No, this just won’t do’. I was very annoyed, I felt like they had completely changed my character." [...] The character departed on-screen in August 1993, when Dot moved away from the soap's setting to live with her son Nick and his family in Gravesend, Kent.|$|E

500|$|In {{writing for}} Batman, Hill {{considered}} that a fundamental {{aspect of the}} character was how he interacts with his villains, allies, and the city around him. Hill said: [...] "You know, {{what does it mean}} to be Batman? ...How does it affect Batman when <b>things</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> him? What is his psychological make up? Those are the influences behind the game... you actually delve into the psyche of what makes him what he is, which is where I think so much of the interest in Batman is." [...] Batman's armor was redesigned to match that of the Batmobile to make them appear visually similar—featuring the same shapes and material textures—and appear functionally compatible with the high-speed methods in which the character enters and exits the vehicle. The design also added armor over Batman's shoulders, covering the previously exposed cape, to make it appear more feasible that it could hold Batman's weight without failing during gliding. For other returning characters, art director David Hego said that the designs were conceived to keep them interesting after players had seen them several times before in previous games, while the game's autumnal setting also necessitated a change in character clothing over the winter setting of Arkham City. The Penguin lost his long coat, and was made to look dirtier, his clothing showing signs of sweat and food stains, and his head was shaved. For Two-Face, the designers felt the character did not require changing significantly, and instead emphasized existing character traits, particularly his disfigured flesh, using references of burnt flesh as inspiration. Similarly, they wanted to retain the typical Riddler characterizations like green shirts emblazoned with question marks, but instead had the character design evolve throughout the game, modifying his own costume in response to the events of the plot.|$|E

2500|$|Before marrying Rita Wilson, Hanks {{converted}} to the Greek Orthodox Church, {{the religion of}} Wilson and her family. Hanks said, [...] "I must say that when I go to church—and I do go to church—I ponder the mystery. I meditate on the 'why?' of 'why people are as they are' and 'why bad <b>things</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> good people,' and 'why good <b>things</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> bad people'... The mystery is what I think is, almost, the grand unifying theory of all mankind." ...|$|E

2500|$|Her speech {{also sought}} to express the idea that really terrible <b>things</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> good people: [...] "I would call it, in terms of writing, in terms of poetry, it's a laundry list. Because all you're doing is: This is who we are, {{and this is what}} we think, {{and this is what we}} feel, and this is why - you know?... I just wanted to admit, you know, that we didn't deserve this, and nobody does. And so I wanted to link our tragedy, in every sense, you know - we're no {{different}} from anything else that has hurt...." ...|$|E
2500|$|The novel {{extensively}} {{focuses on}} the effects of losses during wartime. As The Guardian noted when discussing her awards for The Ghost Road, the series gave her the reputation as [...] "The woman who understood war". Barker stated in an interview with Wera Reusch that [...] "The trilogy is trying to tell something about the parts of war that don't get into the official accounts". She goes on to state that [...] "One of the things that impresses me is that two <b>things</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> soldiers in war: a) they get killed or b) they come back more or less alright. It's really focusing on the people who do come back but don't come back alright, they are either physically disabled or mentally traumatised." ...|$|E
2500|$|David Chapman, {{reviewing}} {{the book for}} the Newsquest Media Group Newspapers, concluded, [...] "This is a decidedly funny memoir that includes the scrapes and japes of nob culture." [...] Lorne Jackson of the Sunday Mercury was totally dismissive {{of what he called}} [...] "a dull memoir", stating: [...] "This could have all been explained in one page, possibly two if the type was particularly large." [...] The Sunday Times commented that, [...] "Annabel comes across as a decent woman ... but her writing is flat, with a few too many clumsy constructions, and her story lacks drama, even when terrible <b>things</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> her." [...] Biographer Selena Hastings called it [...] "a well-ordered, decently written book," [...] while the Evening Standard wrote, [...] "Goldsmith herself comes across as fun and warm, a good sport, if sometimes strangely submissive and a little overfond of her own breasts." [...] Annabel became a No.1 London best-seller for non-fiction. Nationally, the memoirs reached the top ten non-fiction best-sellers in England, fluctuating from No. 7 to No. 4 and then No. 6.|$|E

2500|$|Hilarie Burton portrays Peyton Sawyer, whose two {{greatest}} passions in {{life are}} music and art; she uses her art to express the issues that play out in her life. After Burton auditioned unsuccessfully for the part of Ed Harris's daughter in the film Radio, the casting department remembered her {{and asked her to}} audition for One Tree Hill. Schwahn said, [...] " [...] is an old soul. She's great. She's always just thrilled to do the job, even though she's kind of new to acting. She's just a joy to be around." [...] When talking about casting the role of Peyton, 'Mark Schwann (I)' said: [...] "They asked why I wanted Hilarie Burton, and my answer was, 'She has a lot of pain in her eyes. And I want that pain in Peyton's eyes'. We always laugh about it, because Hilarie is like, 'It's a good thing a lot of crummy <b>things</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> me in my life'." [...] Peyton's best friend is Brooke Davis, and she is close friends with Haley as well. In season 1, Peyton is a cheerleader and dates Nathan, the most popular basketball star in Tree Hill High. She becomes attracted to Lucas after meeting him and soon falls in love with him. Throughout the series, Peyton is met with one tragedy after another. She is deeply in love with Lucas, who always supports her, whether things are good or bad.|$|E
2500|$|The di Marcos {{have been}} {{dismissed}} as [...] "unconvincing characters", and Bruno and Luisa were ridiculed, with Baylis suggesting that their [...] "foreign mannerisms would have gone down great in any production of Fiddler On The Roof". Baylis goes on to highlight a problem that he feels [...] "dogged the whole family", their occupation as restaurateurs. Baylis believes this kept them [...] "self-contained", and prevented them from establishing meaningful links with other characters. He explains: [...] " [...] had an ambiguity, heightened by the job they did. Soapland has no place for grey areas. Bad <b>things</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> bad people. They also happen to good people, of course, but not for very long. To make this predictable universe work on the screen, you need characters who are relatively stable (even if they are unstable). The writers and the viewers buy into a myth that people aren't particularly complex, that {{the full range of}} their feelings and actions can be revealed in a few hours on the TV. And a quick, visible way of revealing characters is to mirror them in their occupation. Thus we have Pauline Fowler, long-suffering drudge and matriarch. What better job than folding pants all day in the launderette? Or Peggy Butcher - tough but fun-loving and gregarious. So she runs the pub. But what attributes spring to mind when we think of Italian restaurants? Fond of pasta, perhaps? Permanently overworked?

If any di Marco wanted a night out, a pint in the Vic, a clandestine liaison, then an excuse had to be found as to why they weren't working.
