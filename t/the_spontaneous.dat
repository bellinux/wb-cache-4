5|$|In 1943, {{development}} efforts {{were directed to}} a gun-type fission weapon with plutonium called Thin Man. Initial research on the properties of plutonium was done using cyclotron-generated plutonium-239, which was extremely pure, but could only be created in very small amounts. Los Alamos received the first sample of plutonium from the Clinton X-10 reactor in April 1944 and within days Emilio Segrè discovered a problem: the reactor-bred plutonium had a higher concentration of plutonium-240, resulting in up to five times <b>the</b> <b>spontaneous</b> fission rate of cyclotron plutonium. Seaborg had correctly predicted in March 1943 {{that some of the}} plutonium-239 would absorb a neutron and become plutonium-240.|$|E
5|$|In April 1944, {{experiments}} by Emilio G. Segrè and his P-5 Group at Los Alamos on {{the newly}} reactor-produced plutonium from Oak Ridge and the Hanford site {{showed that it}} contained impurities {{in the form of}} the isotope plutonium-240. This has a far higher spontaneous fission rate than plutonium-239. The cyclotron-produced material on which the original measurements had been made had much lower traces of plutonium-240. Its inclusion in reactor-bred plutonium appeared unavoidable. This meant that <b>the</b> <b>spontaneous</b> fission rate of the reactor plutonium was so high that it would be highly likely that it would predetonate and blow itself apart during the initial formation of a critical mass. The distance required to accelerate the plutonium to speeds where predetonation would be less likely would need a gun barrel too long for any existing or planned bomber. The only way to use plutonium in a workable bomb was thus implosion — a far more difficult engineering task.|$|E
40|$|AbstractUnder normal conditions, {{excess water}} dispersions of liquid {{crystalline}} 1, 2 -dielaidoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphoethanolamine (DEPE) {{are known to}} convert from a liquid crystalline lamellar (Lα) to inverse hexagonal (HII) phase at about 60 °C. The nonlamellar phase behavior of lipid systems is also known to depend on <b>the</b> monolayer <b>spontaneous</b> curvature. <b>The</b> single-channel activity of alamethicin in black lipid bilayer membranes {{has been shown to}} be dependent upon the lipid composition of the membrane. Since <b>the</b> monolayer <b>spontaneous</b> curvature properties (e. g., <b>the</b> monolayer <b>spontaneous</b> curvature, curvature coefficients and bilayer thickness) vary with lipid composition, the single-channel activity of alamethicin presumably also correlates with <b>the</b> monolayer <b>spontaneous</b> curvature properties. Accordingly, we reasoned that if alamethicin couples to the curvature properties of a lipid film, then the curvature properties must, in turn, be perturbed by the presence of alamethicin and that this perturbation should be observable in the lipid phase behavior. Here X-ray diffraction and NMR are used to show that the presence of as little as 1 % alamethicin introduces a large region of cubic phase into the thermal phase diagram. This suggests that perturbation of the nonlamellar phase behavior of a lipid system may be a method to survey different channel-forming molecules for possible behavior that indicates that the ion channel is sensitive to <b>the</b> monolayer <b>spontaneous</b> curvature properties...|$|R

5|$|Living organisms must {{obey the}} laws of thermodynamics, which {{describe}} the transfer of heat and work. The second law of thermodynamics states that in any closed system, the amount of entropy (disorder) cannot decrease. Although living organisms' amazing complexity appears to contradict this law, life is possible as all organisms are open systems that exchange matter and energy with their surroundings. Thus living systems are not in equilibrium, but instead are dissipative systems that maintain their state of high complexity by causing a larger increase in the entropy of their environments. The metabolism of a cell achieves this by coupling <b>the</b> <b>spontaneous</b> processes of catabolism to the non-spontaneous processes of anabolism. In thermodynamic terms, metabolism maintains order by creating disorder.|$|E
5|$|Maben was {{concerned}} {{that one of the}} problems with the film was that it was too short. In early 1973, Maben was fly fishing with Waters, and suggested the possibility of improving the film by watching them at work in a recording studio. Subsequently, Maben was invited with a small crew using a single 35mm camera to Abbey Road Studios to film supposed recording sessions of The Dark Side of the Moon, as well as interviews conducted off-camera by Maben, and footage of the band eating and talking at the studio cafeteria. Maben was particularly happy about this footage, feeling it captured <b>the</b> <b>spontaneous</b> humour of the band. This version premiered on 21 August 1974, and ran for 80 minutes.|$|E

A larger group sent from Warsaw under Walery Sławek never made it in time to take control or affect the uprising; it was, in the end, an anarchic and unorganized violent protest against the Russian government.|$|E

5|$|The {{location}} of micronuclei or where bubbles initially form is not known. The most likely mechanisms for bubble formation are tribonucleation, when two surfaces {{make and break}} contact (such as in joints), and heterogeneous nucleation, where bubbles are created at a site based on a surface {{in contact with the}} liquid. Homogeneous nucleation, where bubbles form within the liquid itself is less likely because it requires much greater pressure differences than experienced in decompression. <b>The</b> <b>spontaneous</b> formation of nanobubbles on hydrophobic surfaces is a possible source of micronuclei, but it is not yet clear if these can grow large enough to cause symptoms as they are very stable.|$|E
5|$|The {{radicals}} refused, however, {{to recognize}} {{themselves in the}} novel's pages (Dimitri Pisarev ridiculed the notion that Raskolnikov's ideas could be identified {{with those of the}} radicals of his time), since Dostoyevsky pursued nihilistic ideas to their most extreme consequences. The aim of these ideas was altruistic and humanitarian, but these aims were to be achieved by relying on reason and suppressing entirely <b>the</b> <b>spontaneous</b> outflow of Christian pity and compassion. Chernyshevsky's utilitarian ethic proposed that thought and will in Man were subject to the laws of physical science.* Hudspith (2003), 95 Dostoyevsky believed that such ideas limited man to a product of physics, chemistry and biology, negating spontaneous emotional responses. In its latest variety of Bazarovism, Russian nihilism encouraged the creation of an élite of superior individuals to whom the hopes of the future were to be entrusted.|$|E
5|$|The {{relativistic}} Dirac equation {{has problems}} for elements {{with more than}} 137 protons. For such elements, the wave function of the Dirac ground state is oscillatory rather than bound, {{and there is no}} gap between the positive and negative energy spectra, as in the Klein paradox. More accurate calculations taking into account the effects of the finite size of the nucleus indicate that the binding energy first exceeds the limit for elements with more than 173 protons. For heavier elements, if the innermost orbital (1s) is not filled, the electric field of the nucleus will pull an electron out of the vacuum, resulting in <b>the</b> <b>spontaneous</b> emission of a positron; however, this does not happen if the innermost orbital is filled, so that element 173 is not necessarily the end of the periodic table.|$|E

5|$|Two groups claimed {{discovery}} of the element. Evidence of element 106 was first reported in 1974 by a Russian research team in Dubna led by Yuri Oganessian, in which targets of lead-208 and lead-207 were bombarded with accelerated ions of chromium-54. In total, fifty-one spontaneous fission events were observed with a half-life between four and ten milliseconds. After having ruled out nucleon transfer reactions as a cause for these activities, the team concluded that the most likely cause of the activities was <b>the</b> <b>spontaneous</b> fission of isotopes of element 106. The isotope in question was first suggested to be seaborgium-259, but was later corrected to seaborgium-260.|$|E
5|$|Hoping to {{capitalise}} on <b>the</b> <b>spontaneous</b> uprising that spread across Ireland in May 1798, Commodore Daniel Savary led a third, and more successful, effort. He {{took a small}} frigate squadron flying false British colours to Killala, and in August landed 1,150 French troops under General Humbert. A larger force would have been despatched, but the French had been caught unprepared—the Irish rebellion had originally been planned to coincide with a later French landing, but British intelligence operations had infiltrated the United Irishmen and arrested much of its leadership, prompting a precipitate revolt. Although the uprising achieved some early successes, by the time Humbert arrived its outcome had already been decided with the defeat of successive rebel armies by British troops. Humbert's force was joined by many United Irishmen and had some initial success, {{but was unable to}} face superior British numbers at the Battle of Ballinamuck, and surrendered on 8 September. Although its small size allowed it to reach Ireland unobserved, neither Savary's frigate squadron nor the army it carried were large enough to {{have a significant impact on}} the campaign.|$|E
5|$|The basal ganglia—the part of {{the brain}} most {{prominently}} affected in early HD—play a key role in movement and behavior control. Their functions are not fully understood, but current theories propose that they are {{part of the}} cognitive executive system and the motor circuit. The basal ganglia ordinarily inhibit a large number of circuits that generate specific movements. To initiate a particular movement, the cerebral cortex sends a signal to the basal ganglia that causes the inhibition to be released. Damage to the basal ganglia can cause the release or reinstatement of the inhibitions to be erratic and uncontrolled, which results in an awkward start to motion or motions to be unintentionally initiated, or a motion to be halted before, or beyond, its intended completion. The accumulating damage to this area causes the characteristic erratic movements associated with HD. <b>The</b> <b>spontaneous</b> and erratic physical movements associated with HD are classified as a type of hyperkinetic dysarthria. Because of the basal ganglia's inability to inhibit movements, individuals affected by it will inevitably experience a reduced ability to produce speech and swallow foods and liquids (dysphagia).|$|E
