5|$|In {{the ensuing}} inquiry, chaired by Rear Admiral Reinhold von Werner, Monts {{testified that he}} had not been given {{sufficient}} time <b>to</b> <b>familiarize</b> himself with the ship and its crew, who were themselves unfamiliar with the vessel. Monts argued that the mobilization process for the newly commissioned ship should have lasted four to six weeks, rather than the three he had been given. The day before the squadron left Wilhelmshaven, Batsch complained to General Albrecht von Stosch, the chief of the Kaiserliche Marine, that a significant number of dockyard workers were still finishing work on Grosser Kurf√ºrst. Werner and the board determined that Admiral Batsch was at fault and exonerated Monts.|$|E
5|$|Researchers have {{identified}} {{factors contributing to}} the relatively rapid fall of the fortress. It had not been completely renovated; its defenders were inexperienced; the crew had been frequently rotated, and {{had not been able}} <b>to</b> <b>familiarize</b> themselves with the surrounding area and with the fortress. Although most of their experience lay in the defense of the fortress' interior, they were dispatched to fight on open ground. When the combat moved outside the fortress, communication lines were disrupted by the German bombardment, and the fortress defense was unable to restore complete communication with the command center or with other forts. The absence of external support was a crucial factor in its fall.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Navy assumed {{control of}} her the {{following}} day and sailed her to Wilhelmshaven where she waited while the Allies decided on the disposition of the captured ships. She was allocated to Britain {{at the end of}} 1945 and arrived at Portsmouth on 7 January 1946 where she was allocated the pennant number of R38, later H40. The ship was initially used <b>to</b> <b>familiarize</b> the British on her high-pressure boilers until October when she was used as accommodation ship in Southampton.

Starting at 01:00 on 11March, the North Vietnamese moved into their assigned positions in order to launch their attack. About 02:00, a U.S. adviser at the airstrip reported to Secord and CIA officers at Udorn that he heard gunfire on top of Phou Pha Thi, and communication with U.S. technicians at Lima Site 85 was completely cut off. Afterwards, Secord briefed U.S. A-1 Skyraider pilots in Thailand on the situation at Lima Site 85, <b>to</b> <b>familiarize</b> them with friendly positions around the facility, so they could cover the evacuation of U.S. personnel and support the Hmong counterattack.|$|E
5|$|In Episode One players {{make their}} way through a linear series of levels and {{encounter}} various enemies and allies. The gameplay is broken up between combat-oriented challenges and physics-based puzzles.

A head-up display appears on the screen to display the character's health, energy, and ammunition. Throughout the course of the game, the player accesses new weapons and ammunition that are used to defend the character from enemy forces. Unlike in Half-Life 2, where Gordon's initial weapon is the crowbar, Gordon first acquires the Gravity Gun, which plays {{a crucial role in the}} game by allowing the player to use physics to manipulate objects at a distance in both combat and puzzle-solving scenarios.|$|E
5|$|The Five Nights at Freddy's: Survival Logbook is the series's second guidebook. It {{was first}} {{discovered}} on Amazon on mid 2017. Although {{it has never}} been confirmed by Cawthon himself, several suggestions have stated that the guidebook will explore simple activities for children as they play the video games, or <b>to</b> <b>familiarize</b> new players to the game play of Five Nights at Freddy's. This new title is surmised to have crossword puzzles and word searches, instead of hidden lore or narrative hints about the Five Nights at Freddy's franchise. Unlike most of the previous book releases, the Survival Logbook has no listed Amazon Kindle editions, implying that it will have pages designed for physical writing as opposed to simply reading from a device.

5|$|The {{selected}} {{project was}} a spin-off {{that was being}} developed by an inexperienced team under director Kazuhiro Aoyama. The spin-off was originally intended to introduce a new character {{who would have to}} escape from an infected Raccoon City. However, after the promotion, Capcom decided that Resident Evil protagonist Jill Valentine would be the main character and Raccoon City would be destroyed. Unlike the majority of the early scripts in the series, the scenario of the game was not created by Capcom's Flagship studio but by internal Capcom writer Yasuhisa Kawamura, who had very little experience with the Resident Evil series at the time. Kawamura noted that he had to play the original game <b>to</b> <b>familiarize</b> himself with the series' fictional universe immediately. Nevertheless, the story was proofread and sanctioned by Flagship to avoid continuity errors with other installments in the series, an issue that was also given attention in monthly meetings between all directors and producers.|$|E
5|$|Being Naughty Dog's first PlayStation 3 game, {{the project}} {{required}} the company <b>to</b> <b>familiarize</b> {{themselves with the}} new hardware, and resulted in several development mistakes. The switch from developing for the PlayStation 2 to the PlayStation 3 prompted the staff to implement changes to their development technology. Naughty Dog switched to the industry standard language C++ in order to participate in technology sharing among Sony's first-party developers‚Äîthe company had previously used their own proprietary programming language GOAL, a Lisp-based language. In rewriting their game code, they decided to create new programming tools as well. This switch, however, delayed the team's progress in developing a prototype, as the new tools proved to be unreliable and too difficult to use. Ten months into full production, the team decided to recreate the game's pipeline, the chain of processing elements designed to progress data through a system. In retrospect, Naughty Dog's Co-President Evan Wells considered this the greatest improvement to the project. Additionally, the animation blending system was rewritten several times to obtain the desired character animations.|$|E
5|$|In January 1994, Sega {{began to}} develop an add-on for the Genesis, the Sega 32X, which {{would serve as a}} less-expensive entry into the 32-bit era. The {{decision}} to create the add-on was made by Nakayama and widely supported by Sega of America employees. According to former Sega of America producer Scot Bayless, Nakayama was worried that the Saturn would not be available until after 1994 and that the recently released Atari Jaguar would reduce Sega's hardware sales. As a result, Nakayama ordered his engineers to have the system ready for launch {{by the end of the}} year. The 32X would not be compatible with the Saturn, but Sega executive Richard Brudvik-Lindner pointed out that the 32X would play Genesis titles, and had the same system architecture as the Saturn. This was justified by Sega's statement that both platforms would run at the same time, and that the 32X would be aimed at players who could not afford the more expensive Saturn. According to Sega of America research and development head Joe Miller, the 32X served a role in assisting development teams <b>to</b> <b>familiarize</b> themselves with the dual SH-2 architecture also used in the Saturn. Because both machines shared many of the same parts and were preparing to launch around the same time, tensions emerged between Sega of America and Sega of Japan when the Saturn was given priority.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{reports the}} effect of pre-operation {{intended}} <b>to</b> <b>familiarizing</b> oneself with vicarious experiences of different-sized hands. To measure this effect, the index of degree of immersion (DOI) is pro-posed, which represents whether observed behavior is appropriate for the presented hand size. The DOI is measured for various sizes of hands when changing type of pre-operation which is classified based on relationship between hands and objects. The experimental {{results show that the}} pre-operation is effective for familiarizing the presented sized hand, especially in larger sized hands, and that behavior of touching and controlling an object in position is important for effective pre-operation. ...|$|R

5|$|She {{moved to}} BAM Racing in October 2001 and drove her first (and only) {{race in the}} NASCAR Winston West Series (now called K Pro Series West) at Las Vegas Motor Speedway that same month. Robinson {{was sent to a}} driving school <b>to</b> <b>familiarize</b> herself with the track, and Kranefuss granted her {{permission}} to race. She retired due to a car failure while running in third position. Team owner Tony Morgenthau first noticed Robinson at an ARCA race at Pocono Raceway the previous year when she made contact with his driver Matty Mullins who was sent into the wall. He had been impressed with her pace at Las Vegas. He spoke to Robinson after the race and asked her why she had not competed in more events. He later offered her a multi-year contract which she signed in December 2001. Her crew chief was former Busch Series driver Eddie Sharp. She attempted to qualify for 24-races during the 2002 season since her team had no owner points because they were a new operation. Robinson went to Kranefuss to terminate her contract with his team. She ran for the Rookie of the Year award, but was seen by the Chicago Tribune as having little chance of securing the honor.|$|E
5|$|Square {{released}} an enhanced port of Chrono Trigger developed by Tose in Japan for the Sony PlayStation in 1999. Square timed its release before that of Chrono Cross, the 1999 sequel to Chrono Trigger, <b>to</b> <b>familiarize</b> new players with story {{leading up to}} it. This version included anime cut scenes created by original character designer Akira Toriyama's Bird Studio and animated by Toei Animation, {{as well as several}} bonus features, accessible after achieving various endings in the game. Scenarist Masato Kato attended planning meetings at Bird Studio to discuss how the ending cut scenes would illustrate subtle ties to Chrono Cross. The port was later released in North America in 2001‚Äîalong with a newly translated version of Final Fantasy IV‚Äîunder the package title Final Fantasy Chronicles. Reviewers criticized Chronicles for its lengthy load times and an absence of new in-game features. This same iteration was also re-released as a downloadable game on the Playstation Network on October 4, 2011, for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita, and PlayStation Portable.|$|E
5|$|The {{squadron}} {{was transferred}} to the division with which it would {{spend the rest of the}} war; the 6th Airborne Division, raised in April 1943. The squadron continued to train as an air-portable unit and participated in a number of exercises intended <b>to</b> <b>familiarize</b> it with the duties it would perform, including reconnaissance of enemy positions and performing counter-attacks against enemy infantry and armor. In mid-July an American pilot was sent to Britain to illustrate that the tank could fit inside a Hamilcar and be landed, and then on October 25 the Light Tank Squadron received a shipment of seventeen Locusts. During November the new tanks were issued to the squadron, replacing a majority of the Tetrarchs; however a small number of Tetrarchs fitted with a 3 inch (76.2 mm) infantry support howitzer, which were designated as Tetrarch 1 CS (Close Support), were retained. Several of the Locusts also were fitted with Littlejohn adaptors to increase the range and penetration power of their main armament, although it is not clear how many were fitted or if they were fitted at manufacture or after they reached the squadron. The squadron was expanded into the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment in December 1943, and as late as March 1944, plans were made for the regiment to be equipped with seventeen Locusts and three Tetrarchs when it took part in Operation Tonga, the British airborne landings in Normandy. However, records indicate that by April the Hamilcar gliders of the regiment were being refitted to only carry Tetrarchs, and by late March the Locusts appear to have been completely replaced. This seems to have been due to mechanical and gunnery problems with the Locusts, as well as specific problems with the design of the Locust's gearbox.|$|E
