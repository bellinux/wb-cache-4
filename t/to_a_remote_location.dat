Reyes helped deliver the child, and made a permanent move soon afterwards, becoming Doggett's partner on The X-Files.|$|E
5|$|The three Scottish soldiers' killings was an {{incident}} {{that took place in}} Northern Ireland during the Troubles. It happened on 10 March 1971, when the Provisional Irish Republican Army shot dead three unarmed British Army soldiers of the 1st Battalion, Royal Highland Fusiliers. Two of the three were teenage brothers; all three were from Scotland. They were killed off-duty and in civilian clothes, having been lured from a city-centre bar in Belfast, driven <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>remote</b> <b>location</b> and shot whilst relieving themselves by the roadside. Three British soldiers had been killed prior to this event; all had been on duty and killed during rioting.|$|E
5|$|Mandela {{obtained}} work as {{an attorney}} for the firm Terblanche and Briggish, before moving to the liberal-run Helman and Michel, passing qualification exams to become a full-fledged attorney. In August 1953, Mandela and Tambo opened their own law firm, Mandela and Tambo, operating in downtown Johannesburg. The only African-run law firm in the country, it was popular with aggrieved blacks, often dealing with cases of police brutality. Disliked by the authorities, the firm was forced to relocate <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>remote</b> <b>location</b> after their office permit was removed under the Group Areas Act; as a result, their clientele dwindled. As a lawyer of aristocratic heritage, Mandela was part of Johannesburg's elite black middle-class, and accorded much respect from the black community. Although a second daughter, Makaziwe Phumia, was born in May 1954, Mandela's relationship with Evelyn became strained, and she accused him of adultery. He may have had affairs with ANC member Lillian Ngoyi and secretary Ruth Mompati; various individuals close to Mandela in this period have stated that the latter bore him a child. Disgusted by her son's behaviour, Nosekeni returned to Transkei, while Evelyn embraced the Jehovah's Witnesses and rejected Mandela's preoccupation with politics.|$|E

25|$|Keystroke logging can be {{achieved}} by both hardware and software means. Hardware key loggers are attached to the keyboard cable or installed inside standard keyboards. Software keyloggers work on the target computer's operating system and gain unauthorized access to the hardware, hook into the keyboard with functions provided by the OS, or use remote access software to transmit recorded data out of the target computer <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>remote</b> <b>location.</b> Some hackers also use wireless keylogger sniffers to collect packets of data being transferred from a wireless keyboard and its receiver, and then they crack the encryption key being used to secure wireless communications between the two devices.|$|E

Before Gregor can elaborate further, fake FBI agents kill him and kidnap Martin <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>remote</b> <b>location</b> where he's reunited with Cosmo, who Martin thought had died in prison. While in prison, Cosmo developed ties with organized crime, allowing him to escape and become wealthy. He explains his plan to use Janek's box to destabilize the world economy, and offers Martin the chance to join him. Martin refuses, whereupon Cosmo uses {{the box to}} break into the FBI and connect Martin's current identity with his former name. Cosmo has Martin knocked out and taken back to the city.|$|E

Templar is taken <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>remote</b> <b>location</b> in New Jersey but manages to escape his fate thanks to the intervention of Fay Edwards, a beautiful young woman who happens to be a cold-blooded killer, and who claims to be working for The Big Fellow. Simon Templar and Fay Edwards fall in love with each other, in a completely Platonic way (they exchange only two kisses and exchange only a few words) which seems nevertheless very deep and poignantly emotional. (On his return to London, in the last page of the book, Templar would refuse to tell Patricia Holm about his American experiences.) ...|$|E

2500|$|On 6 May 1947, 16-year-old Alexander Rubowitz {{disappeared}} while {{putting up}} posters for Jewish paramilitary group Lehi. Palestine police CID {{believed he had}} been caught and killed by Farran's squad; Gurney ordered them [...] "to proceed with the case as an ordinary criminal offence with the object of bringing Farran and any other accused to trial". According to an account ruled inadmissible at Farran's trial, Rubowitz was taken <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>remote</b> <b>location</b> where, after brutal attempts to extract information, {{he was killed by}} Farran with a rock and the body given to an Arab for disposal. His body was never found. Suspicions of Farran's involvement were first raised after a grey trilby hat, bearing worn lettering compatible with his name, was found near the street corner where a struggling Rubowitz was seen being pushed into a car. Farran claimed he was being framed and fled to Syria. Colonel Bernard Fergusson persuaded Farran to return voluntarily. However, when, contrary to Fergusson's assurances, he was arrested, Farran escaped to Jordan, finally returning when he heard of reprisals being planned against British officers. He was brought to trial in a British military court in Jerusalem.|$|E
2500|$|Sometimes {{the crew}} cannot {{get around the}} {{creation}} of a new set, or traveling <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>remote</b> <b>location</b> to film scenes for an episode. For instance, the Luthor mansion set was expanded this season. The production crew first began by expanding the second level in Lex’s office, and then exposed the staircase leading up to the second level – it had originally been hidden by a wall. They also added a skylight and inserted lights in the background, giving the room a larger appearance. For scenes in [...] "Legacy" [...] that involved Dr. Swann, the crew traveled with Christopher Reeve to the New York Public Library to film, which was easier for him to journey to. Reeve’s schedule forced the production crew to shoot his scenes a month before the script for the episode was finalized. In season two, the crew was able to use the set of NBC's Third Watch, courtesy of John Wells, to film Reeve’s scenes. The opening segment for [...] "Truth" [...] where Chloe questions a former co-worker of her father’s about why her father was blacklisted by Lionel Luthor, had to be filmed over two nights; the crew ran out of time the first night because of the weather, so they filmed Mack’s scenes in front of the studio.|$|E
