5|$|By 1942, the M-10 {{designation}} in Flint was renumbered Bus. US10, {{eliminating the}} second M-10 designation from the maps. The last segments of US10 that were gravel-surfaced were paved by 1948. <b>The</b> <b>last</b> <b>section</b> paved was between Chase and Reed City.|$|E
5|$|Dating back to 1919, M-89 was {{originally}} just {{a segment of}} the current highway between the Ganges area and Martin. Changes through the 1920s and 1930s moved the eastern end to Calhoun County. <b>The</b> <b>last</b> <b>section</b> was paved in the 1950s before the highway was rerouted in the Allegan, Michigan area. The last extensions into Battle Creek came in the 1960s and 1998.|$|E
5|$|In late 1951 {{or early}} 1952, <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>section</b> of M-89 was paved, a segment {{south and east}} of Fennville in Allegan County. Just months later, the {{highways}} was realigned to run east from Fennville, rather than south to Pearl, to intersect M-40. From there it was rerouted to run concurrently into Allegan.|$|E

5|$|In {{the latter}} half of 1929, the highway was rerouted between Saginaw and Reese, using a set of {{parallel}} roadways to the south of the previous routing; this change was reversed in 1933. M-81 was fully paved when <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>section</b> between Ellington and Elmwood in Tuscola County was finished in late 1946 or early 1947.|$|E
5|$|On July 13, 2012, Cedar Point {{announced}} that Disaster Transport would close on July 29, 2012. It {{was the second}} roller coaster at Cedar Point to close in 2012. A charity auction was held for the final riders, benefiting the Give Kids the World charity foundation. The last ride was given at 11:53 PM on July 29, with the lights turned on. The ride started demolition on August 6, using about 380 trucks to transport scrap materials. A portion of track, two cars and the main entrance sign will be donated to the National Roller Coaster Museum. Less than a month later on August 29 at around 9:30 AM, <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>section</b> of Disaster Transport was demolished. The 12E {{part of the building}} was <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>section</b> left standing.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>last</b> <b>section</b> {{provides}} {{access to}} TuneUp Styler and TuneUp System Control. TuneUp System Control is a program that allows access {{to some of the}} obscure or harder-to-access settings of Microsoft Windows, similar to Tweak UI. TuneUp Styler allows for customization of the Windows user interface by changing the desktop appearance, icons, and the logon and startup screens.|$|E
50|$|The {{airfield}} {{was passed}} on to RAF Maintenance Command in 1947. By 1948, the station was closed and <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>sections</b> were sold off for agricultural use in 1961.|$|R
50|$|In 1991, {{the section}} between Lassen Street and Parthenia Street {{was one of}} <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>sections</b> of natural stream beds in the San Fernando Valley to be made a {{concrete}} channel.|$|R

5|$|By {{the end of}} 1936, <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>section</b> of US31 in {{the state}} was paved near Charlevoix, making the entire highway in Michigan a hard-surfaced road. Early the next year, the route of US2 was realigned to run into St. Ignace; after the change, US2 and US31 ran concurrently. Later that year, a set of curves were {{straightened}} out south of Ludington and the routes of US31 and a US31A between Saugatuck and Holland were switched, and US31 was realigned to bypass downtown Ludington.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1950s, the routing through Muskegon was altered. Instead of {{terminating}} in {{the park}} at the outlet of Muskegon Lake into Lake Michigan, M-46 was routed to follow US16 to the car ferry docks. <b>The</b> <b>last</b> <b>section</b> of gravel highway was also paved in Newaygo County near the Montcalm County line. The routing of M-46 between Casnovia and Howard City was altered in 1973 when the US131 freeway was opened north of Cedar Springs by then-Congressman Gerald R. Ford. M-46 was restored to the Kent City–Cedar Springs roadway it used in the 1930s and routed concurrently along US131 again.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} debut of the U.S. Highway System in 1926, M-11 was {{designated}} from M-50 at Napoleon to US112 in Saline. <b>The</b> <b>last</b> <b>section</b> of this highway was fully paved between Bridgewater and Saline in late 1948 or early 1949. In the middle of 1954, M-92 was extended southward from Chelsea to Manchester. From there, that highway replaced M-11 west to Bridgewater before turning south to Clinton; at the same time, the remainder of M-11 {{was removed from the}} state highway system and the designation was decommissioned.|$|E

5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>section</b> in {{spirited}} 3/8 time, {{the predominant}} mood is of joyous exaltation reflecting the text from Isaiah. The {{structure of the}} choral material in this final section complements that of the first section; there a fugal passage was enclosed between two homophonic episodes; here a homophonic episode is preceded and followed by fugal passages. While the first section is preceded by the lengthy orchestral sinfonia, the final section ends with a short coda for full chorus and orchestra.|$|E
5|$|Le Carrefour de l'Arbre (or Pavé de Luchin) is <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>section</b> of pavé of {{the hardest}} level of difficulty, five stars. The {{crossroads}} (carrefour) is on open land between Gruson and Camphin-en-Pévèle. The route departs westward from Camphin-en-Pévèle along the rue de Cysoing towards Camphin de l'Arbre. The first half {{is a series of}} corners, then along irregular pavé towards Luchin. The second half finishes at the Café de l'Arbre restaurant and has more even pavé. This 2.1km sector has often proved decisive due to its proximity to Roubaix (15km) and cumulative difficulty.|$|E
5|$|The Michigan State Highway Department rerouted M-33/M-72 near Fairview in late 1951 {{or early}} 1952, turning the former route back to local control. <b>The</b> <b>last</b> <b>section</b> of M-33 was paved in {{southern}} Cheboygan County {{in the late}} 1950s. The southern end was extended slightly to end at the M-76 freeway that opened between Alger and Standish; that freeway was redesignated as part of I-75 in 1974. A minor realignment of M-32/M-33 east of Atlanta smoothed out some curves in the road in 1996.|$|E

50|$|New York Route 17 {{crosses the}} town. New York State Route 41 intersects NY-17 west of McClure. The part of NY-17 near Deposit {{was one of}} <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>sections</b> to be {{completed}} in this part of New York, forcing travelers to exit at Deposit.|$|R
5|$|The {{first section}} of I-380 opened to traffic on September 19, 1973. That section {{connected}} The Eastern Iowa Airport to I-80 at Coralville. Within three years, the interstate had been extended into Cedar Rapids at the Cedar River. The bridge which crossed the river would not open until June 1979. By the end of 1981, I-380 was a continuous road to the Coldstream Avenue/Glass Road interchange. The interstate was originally scheduled to be open by Christmas 1984, but weather delays pushed back the construction timetable. <b>The</b> <b>last</b> <b>section</b> of I-380 to be completed opened on September 12, 1985.|$|E
5|$|The {{first section}} of tunnel was {{completed}} in September 1998, and the TBMs moved to Havnegade. By December 1998, work had started on the initial nine stations. Plans for M2 were presented {{to the public in}} April 1999, with a debate emerging if the proposed elevated solution was the best. In May, the first trains were delivered, and trial runs began at the depot. In December, the tunnels were completed to Strandlodsvej, and the TBMs were moved to Havnegade, where they started to grind towards Frederiksberg. From 1 January 2000, the S-train service from Solbjerg to Vanløse was terminated, and work commenced to rebuild the section to metro. <b>The</b> <b>last</b> <b>section</b> of tunnel was completed in February 2001.|$|E
5|$|The section {{through the}} Naomikong Point area was built {{starting}} in 1967 by the Michigan State Highway Department {{under contract to}} the USFS. The road, at the time, {{was intended to be}} part of a longer scenic highway that would connect a proposed lakeshore road through the Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore with roads running along Whitefish Bay and the St. Marys River south of Sault Ste. Marie. The western end was realigned and paved in the late 1970s, moving the roadway closer to Tahquamenon Bay west of Naomikong Point. The former roadway was removed in the process. <b>The</b> <b>last</b> <b>section</b> was paved in 1987 between the two paved sections at Naomikong and Iroquois points.|$|E

5|$|Corythosaurus {{is known}} from many {{complete}} specimens, including the nearly complete holotype found by Brown in 1911. The holotype skeleton is only missing <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>section</b> of the tail, {{and part of}} the forelimbs, but was preserved with impressions of polygonal scales. Corythosaurus is known from many skulls with tall crests. The crests resemble the crests of the cassowary and a Corinthian helmet. The most likely function of the crest is thought to be vocalization. As in a trombone, sound waves would travel through many chambers in the crest, and then get amplified when Corythosaurus exhaled. A Corythosaurus specimen has been preserved with its last meal in its chest cavity. Inside the cavity were remains of conifer needles, seeds, twigs, and fruits: Corythosaurus probably fed on all of these.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, at {{the same}} time all single-digit highway numbers were renumbered in the state, the M-86 {{designation}} replaced M-7. This incarnation of M-86 followed its present-day routing. Near Nottawa, M-86 ran concurrently with the contemporary M-78 north and east to Colon. In late 1948 or early 1949, <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>section</b> of highway was paved in Branch County, hard-surfacing all of M-86 for the first time. A change related to M-66 and M-78 altered M-86 in 1965. South of Battle Creek, M-66 replaced M-78. Rather than follow M-78 between Colon and Athens, M-66 used a different series of roads. The net result was that along M-86, the M-78 concurrency was replaced by a shorter M-66 concurrency. The routing has remain unchanged since.|$|E
5|$|Sorabji's fugues, {{the most}} atonal of his works, {{generally}} follow traditional methods. After a subject and {{between one and}} four countersubjects have been presented in an exposition, there follows a development section in which the subject (and countersubjects, particularly in the earlier fugues) are usually developed in their original form and in inversion, retrograde and retrograde inversion. The movement continues with a stretto and concludes with a section featuring augmentation and a thickening of lines into chords. His multi-subject fugues repeat this pattern for each subject, and combine thematic material from all expositions in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>section.</b> The fugues are more conservative than most of his output, in that they rarely use polyrhythms. They can contain up to six subjects, and it is these that mark Sorabji's fugues as different from most others. Some of the subjects are among his most unconventional melodic creations, lacking the frequent changes of direction that characterise most melodies; other subjects are possibly the longest ever conceived. This has led some people either to treat them with suspicion or to criticise them.|$|E
