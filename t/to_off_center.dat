50|$|There {{are three}} iodine (I) {{sites that are}} coordinated by three oxygen (O) atoms {{arranged}} in a triangle {{to one side of}} the cation. The distances of the bonds between the I and O atoms is 1.81 Å. This results in the IO3 group forming a triangular pyramid with the I site at the top of the pyramid. At each I sites there are also three additional ligands that causes the iodine atoms to have a distorted octahedral coordination. This also causes the I atom <b>to</b> occupy <b>off</b> <b>centered</b> positions within each octahedron. The long bonds between the atoms at the I sites contributes significant bond valence to the bonded anions.|$|R
2500|$|The MHV {{guidance}} system solely tracked {{targets in the}} field of view of the infrared sensor, but did not determine altitude, attitude, or range to the target. Direct Proportional Line of Sight guidance used information from the detector to maneuver and null out any line-of-sight change. A Bang-bang control system was used to fire 56 full charge [...] "divert" [...] and lower thrust 8 half charge [...] "end-game" [...] solid rocket motors arranged around the circumference of the MHV. The half charge 8 [...] "end-game" [...] motors were used to perform finer trajectory adjustments just prior to intercepting the target satellite. Four pods {{at the rear of the}} MHV contained small attitude control rocket motors. These motors were used <b>to</b> damp <b>off</b> <b>center</b> rotation by the MHV.|$|R

40|$|AIM: To {{determine}} the influence of anthropomorphic parameters on the relationship between patient centering, mean computed tomography (CT) numbers and quantitative image noise in abdominal CT. METHODS: Our Institutional Review Board approved study included 395 patients (age range 21 - 108, years; male:female = 195 : 200) who underwent contrast-enhanced abdominal CT on a 16 -section multi-detector row scanner (GE LightSpeed 16). Patient centering in the gantry isocenter was measured from the lateral localizer radiograph (<b>off</b> <b>center</b> S = patient <b>off</b> <b>centered</b> superior <b>to</b> isocenter; <b>off</b> <b>center</b> I = patient <b>off</b> <b>centered</b> inferior <b>to</b> isocenter). Mean CT numbers (Hounsfield Units: HU) and noise (standard deviation of CT numbers: SD) were measured in the anterior (aHU, aSD) and posterior (pHU, pSD) abdominal wall subcutaneous fat and liver parenchyma (LivHU, LivSD) {{at the level of the}} porta hepatis. Patients&#x 2019; age, gender, weight, body mass index and maximal anteroposterior diameter were recorded. The data were analyzed using linear regression analysis. RESULTS: Most patients (81 %; 320 / 395) were not correctly centered in the gantry isocenter for abdominal CT scanning. Mean CT numbers in the abdominal wall increased significantly with an increase in the off-centering distance, regardless of the direction of the off-center (P < 0. 05). There was a substantial increase in pSD (P = 0. 01) and LivSD (P = 0. 017) with off-centering. Change in mean CT numbers and image noise along the off-center distance was influenced by the patient size (P < 0. 01). CONCLUSION: Inappropriate patient centering for CT scanning adversely affects the reliability of mean CT numbers and image noise...|$|R
5000|$|The {{expense of}} {{refrigeration}} {{led to the}} early dismissal of low-temperature superconductors for use in magnetic bearings. However, high-temperature superconductor (HTSC) bearings may be economical and could possibly extend the time energy could be stored economically. [...] Hybrid bearing systems {{are most likely to}} see use first. High-temperature superconductor bearings have historically had problems providing the lifting forces necessary for the larger designs, but can easily provide a stabilizing force. Therefore, in hybrid bearings, permanent magnets support the load and high-temperature superconductors are used to stabilize it. The reason superconductors can work well stabilizing the load is because they are perfect diamagnets. If the rotor tries <b>to</b> drift <b>off</b> <b>center,</b> a restoring force due to flux pinning restores it. This is known as the magnetic stiffness of the bearing. Rotational axis vibration can occur due to low stiffness and damping, which are inherent problems of superconducting magnets, preventing the use of completely superconducting magnetic bearings for flywheel applications.|$|R
40|$|We present {{integral}} field spectroscopy of NGC 5033, a low luminosity Seyfert galaxy. The {{observations were}} made with INTEGRAL, a fiber based system operating at the WHT. The intensity map of the H emission line represents a spiral or ring-like pattern of HII regions. On the contrary, the [OIII] intensity map morphology is markedly anisotropic. The strong morphological differences imply that the [OIII] emitters represent highly ionized gas illuminated by the central source. The [OIII] map morphology is compatible with a biconical structure of ionization induced by strong extinction in the galaxy disc that also obscures half of the spheroidal stellar bulge. We identify the spectrum corresponding to the Seyfert 1 nucleus from the presence of H broad emission lines. This spectrum {{is located in a}} region where strong extinction is expected but exhibits the bluest spectral energy distribution. The Seyfert 1 nucleus seems <b>to</b> be <b>off</b> <b>center</b> with respect <b>to</b> the stellar rotation center. This result has been also found in other Seyfert galaxies and interpreted in terms of a past merger. The <b>off</b> <b>centering</b> could indicate the presence of nonsymmetric departures in the gravitational potential which could be fueling the active nucleus. The kinematics of the [OIII] emitters show important deviations at a kpc scale with respect to the stellar velocity field and show features related to the asymmetrical morphology of the high ionization region...|$|R
40|$|We present {{here the}} {{observation}} of the Cygnus Superbubble (CSB) using the Solid-state slit camera (SSC) aboard the Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image. The CSB is a large diffuse structure in the Cygnus region with enhanced soft X-ray emission. By utilizing the CCD spectral resolution of the SSC, we detect Fe, Ne, Mg emission lines from the CSB for the first time. The best fit model implies thin hot plasma of kT ~ 0. 3 keV with depleted abundance of 0. 26 +/- 0. 1 solar. Joint spectrum fitting of the ROSAT PSPC data and MAXI/SSC data enables us to measure precise values of NH and temperature inside the CSB. The results show {{that all of the}} regions in the CSB have similar NH and temperature, indicating that the CSB is single unity. The energy budgets calculation suggests that 2 - 3 Myrs of stellar wind from the Cyg OB 2 is enough to power up the CSB, whereas due <b>to</b> its <b>off</b> <b>center</b> position, the origin of the CSB is most likely a Hypernova.

25|$|The state {{legislature}} added SR-48 {{to the state}} highway system in 1927, connecting Bingham with SR-1 (US-91, now US-89) at Midvale Junction. In order to serve the planned I-15 interchange at 7200 South, SR-48 was moved in 1965 <b>to</b> turn north <b>off</b> <b>Center</b> Street onto Holden and Main Streets in Midvale and then east on 7200 South to US-89. As the city of Bingham de-annexed land, a short extension was made at the west end to the new city limits in 1968, but this and more was abandoned in 1973 to allow the Kennecott Copper Corporation to relocate its guard station. An overlap with SR-68 in West Jordan was added in 2000, rerouting SR-48 to turn north at SR-68 and then east on 7000 South to the former alignment at Main Street in Midvale.|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the emergence of}} strange baryons in the dynamical collapse of a non-rotating massive star to a black hole by the neutrino-radiation hydrodynamical simulations in general relativity. By following the dynamical formation and collapse of nascent proto-neutron star from the gravitational collapse of a 40 Msun star adopting a new hyperonic EOS table, we show that the hyperons do not appear at the core bounce but populate quickly at ~ 0. 5 - 0. 7 s after the bounce to trigger the re-collapse to a black hole. They start <b>to</b> show up <b>off</b> <b>center</b> owing <b>to</b> high temperatures and later prevail at center when the central density becomes high enough. The neutrino emission from the accreting proto-neutron star with the hyperonic EOS stops much earlier than the corresponding case with a nucleonic EOS while the average energies and luminosities are quite similar between them. These features of neutrino signal are a potential probe {{of the emergence of}} new degrees of freedom inside the black hole forming collapse.

5000|$|Two {{parallel}} {{tracks of}} [...] were set approximately 9 ft apart. Between these two tracks, the standard and narrow gauge tracks descended into a pit, one from {{each end of}} the pit, overlapping in the center and having a common center line.

40|$|We present {{experimental}} results for Rayleigh-Benard convection patterns in a cylindrical container with static side-wall forcing induced by a heater. This forcing stabilized {{a pattern of}} concentric rolls (a target pattern) with the central roll (the umbilicus) {{at the center of}} the cell after a jump from the conduction to the convection state. A quasi-static increase of the control parameter (epsilon) beyond 0. 8 caused the umbilicus of the pattern <b>to</b> move <b>off</b> <b>center.</b> As observed by others, a further quasi-static increase of epsilon up to 15. 6 caused a sequence of transitions. Each transition began with the displacement of the umbilicus and then proceeded with the loss of one convection roll at the umbilicus and the return of the umbilicus to a location near the center of the cell. Alternatively, with decreasing epsilon new rolls formed at the umbilicus but large umbilicus displacements did not occur. In addition to quantitative measurements of the umbilicus displacement, we determined and analyzed the entire wave-director field of each image. The wave numbers varied in the axial direction, with minima at the umbilicus and at the cell wall and a maximum at a radial position close to 2 / 3 Gamma. The wave numbers at the maximum showed hysteretic jumps at the transitions, but on average agreed well with the theoretical predictions for the wave numbers selected in the far field of an infinitely extended target pattern.
