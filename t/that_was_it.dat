5|$|When {{asked in}} an {{interview}} with Robert Canning of IGN about how she felt about being asked to come on to Angel after previously being killed off, Benz commented: I was shocked. I just thought once you poof'd, you poof'd! I thought <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>it.</b> So when they threw it out to me that I was coming back... They didn't tell me they were bringing her back to life. They just sent me the script for the season finale for season one of Angel, when they rose me from the dead. I was reading the script, and half way through, Darla still hadn't shown up. Benz went on to add, I was like, 'Alright...' I get three quarters of the way through and I think, 'Maybe they sent me the wrong script...?' And then I get to the last page, and I was like, 'Oh my god! I can't believe this! This is so cool!' At that time I'd been committed to another project too. We didn't even know if I was going to be available or not. But it all ended up working out.|$|E

And <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>it.</b> It {{would be just as}} accurate and misleading to say that Courtney Love wrote most of Nirvana's third album, In Utero: you can certainly see her influence in Kurt's lyrics. Before the pair met, it was often guesswork as to his intentions. Afterwards, his lyrics were far more direct.|$|E
25|$|At {{the turn}} of the century the chances of the College gaining a royal charter seemed a distant prospect. Many on the College Council were aware of the need to {{progress}} and achieve greater financial support including Lewis Fry. They were aware <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> not for the anonymous donations made to the College (by a Mr Fenwick Richards) during the last century there would have been bankruptcy. The establishment of the University Colston Society (named after one of Bristol's great benefactors Edward Colston) was the impetus for the campaign to create a University for Bristol and the West of England. It was non-political and was aimed at shaking off the image that the College was a Liberal institution as it was recognised broad political support needed to be generated in order for the plan to become a University to succeed. The first Society Dinner was held on 7 December 1899 with the guest speaker James Byrce (later Viscount Bryce).|$|E

500|$|For the exteriors of {{the capital}} city of King's Landing, that had been doubled for Malta for the entire season 1, now the {{production}} flew to the Croatian city of Dubrovnik. Known as The Pearl of the Adriatic, the city proved to be a good representation of King's Landing since it shared many characteristics with the fictional capital: it had a well-preserved medieval look, with high walls and the sea at its side. According to David Benioff, executive producer of the show, [...] "The minute we started walking around the city walls we knew <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>it.</b> You read the descriptions in the book and you come to Dubrovnik and that's what the actual city is.

500|$|In {{response}} to this revelation, Herc developed the Merry-Go-Round technique to extend the breaks—the percussion interludes or instrumental solos within a longer work of music. When he played a break on one turntable, he repeated the same break on the second turntable {{as soon as the}} first was finished. He then looped these records one after the other in order to extend the break as long as he wanted: [...] "And once they heard that, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>it,</b> wasn't no turning back," [...] Herc told Chang. [...] "They always wanted to hear breaks after breaks after breaks after breaks." [...] It was during these times that the dancers, later known as break-boys or b-boys, would perform what is known as breaking.|$|E

500|$|In {{the words}} of Robert Smith, {{regarding}} the album's conception, [...] "I had two choices at the time, which were either completely giving in [...] or making a record of it and getting it out of me". He also claims he [...] "really thought <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> for the group. I had every intention of signing off. I {{wanted to make the}} ultimate 'fuck off' record, and then sign off [...] ". Smith was mentally exhausted during that period of time: [...] "I was in a really depressed frame of mind between 1981 and 1982". The band [...] "had been touring for about 200 days a year and it all got a bit too much because there was never any time to do anything else".|$|E

[...] Halfway through Cream's set, Hendrix took the stage and performed a frantic version of the Howlin' Wolf song [...] "Killing Floor". In 1989, Clapton described the performance: [...] "He played just about every style you could think of, and not in a flashy way.

500|$|To {{capitalise}} on their chart {{success in the}} US, the band returned to the studio in June 1970, just four months after Black Sabbath was released. The new album was initially set to be named War Pigs after the song [...] "War Pigs", which was critical of the Vietnam War; however, Warner changed {{the title of the}} album to Paranoid. The album's lead-off single, [...] "Paranoid", was written in the studio at the last minute. Ward explains: [...] "We didn't have enough songs for the album, and Tony just played the [...] guitar lick and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>it.</b> It took twenty, twenty-five minutes from top to bottom." [...] The single was released in September 1970 and reached number four on the UK charts, remaining Black Sabbath's only top ten hit. The album followed in the UK in October 1970, where, pushed by the success of the [...] "Paranoid" [...] single, it made number one in the charts.|$|E

O'Connor had visited her {{personal}} friend and Boogeymans producer Rob Tapert on the New Zealand set, {{where she had}} had a discussion with him about [...] "the differences of having a supernatural demon versus a real person that can come in and be a threat." [...] She concluded the former was scarier. On getting cast in the film and her approach to the character, she stated:I had a contract with Rob Tapert and I just emailed him and said that I really wanted to play this character. I think she would be interesting because it touches back on some of the things I've played as an actress, and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>it.</b> [...] It was so tight in the dialogue, you just have to play with the relationships and find other things going on with the characters to make it seem like there's more depth to what's going on, that there's more of a history between them.|$|E

He performed his first professional gig at The Troubadour when he was twelve, but was so nervous he played {{with his back to the}} audience. Throughout his childhood, he had a wide range of musical influences, including The Beatles, Fleetwood Mac, The Who, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, and Nirvana, and, in high school, by Bob Marley, Bill Withers, Al Green, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye and Michael Jackson. [...] He has also incorporated elements of The Police and Prince into his music. [...] In an interview with Billboard, he explained the diversity of his influences: [...] "I love every single kind of music ... even the most saccharine, sugary pop song can be the greatest thing ever. But so can a 25-minute crazy avant-garde fusion gnarly Herbie Hancock jam from the '70s".|$|E
500|$|Betty Driver, who {{had been}} {{performing}} since she was 8 years old, retired from acting in her late forties to run hotels in Cheshire and Derbyshire.

The part of Hilda eventually went to Jean Alexander. Driver has commented, [...] "Harry Kershaw, producer of Coronation Street, persuaded me to audition for Hilda Ogden – just think I could have been wearing curlers for 30 years." [...] In 1969, she was cast as the new character, Betty Turpin. Commenting on her casting in 1999, Driver said, [...] " [...] said, 'Betty, {{how would you like to}} pull pints for us on television?', and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>it.</b> I suppose I expected I'd be there for perhaps a few months.

She was raised in Patterson, Georgia, which she said is a [...] "one-stoplight town", {{and she had a}} job picking tobacco on a local farm for eight years. When she was a child, Strickland watched the Woody Allen film Annie Hall (1975) and was, as she put it, [...] "wanting to be in that place, and being completely taken with the energy of those people. I wanted to be in it". During her childhood, she was well known locally {{as a member of the}} Strickland family and for her extracurricular activities and achievements (she was the Homecoming Queen in elementary, middle and high school, the student council president and a cheerleader). She never considered a career in the performing arts until her participation in a one-act play performed by students of her high school: [...] " [...] the minute I set foot on stage, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>it.</b> Destiny took over.

Recognizing that their musical relationship was still intact, the trio began rehearsing with Todd and Nelson, working on material that would become [...] "Dirty Little Thing", but eventually decided against forming a group with them. During a Loaded show at West Hollywood's Viper Room, McKagan introduced Kushner to Slash, who were previously friends in {{junior high and high}} school. Kushner was invited to jam with the group and was soon invited to join with Slash, stating that [...] "Dave brought a cool vibe to what [...] were doing. There was no deliberation; <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>it,</b> it was a perfect fit." [...] Their former Guns N' Roses band mate Izzy Stradlin also joined them for two weeks, eventually suggesting that [...] "Duff and [...] will sing and [...] will just do a club tour in a van."
