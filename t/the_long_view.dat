2500|$|Typical for {{the period}} was an {{exchange}} that occurred between Halsey {{and one of his}} staff officers in June 1943. South Pacific Command was expecting the arrival of an additional air group to support their next offensive. As a part of <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>view</b> of winning the war taken by Nimitz, upon its arrival at Fiji the group was given new orders to return stateside and be broken up, its pilots to be used as instructors for pilot training. South Pacific command had been counting on the air group for their operations up the Solomon chain. The staff officer who brought the dispatch to Halsey remarked [...] "If they do that to us we will have to go on the defensive." [...] The admiral turned to the speaker and replied: [...] "As long as I have one plane and one pilot, I will stay on the offensive." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1619, the Virginia Company of London {{under a new}} leader, Sir Edwin Sandys, {{instituted a}} number of changes, to help stimulate more {{investment}} and attract settlers from England. In <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>view,</b> foremost among these was the establishment of what became the House of Burgesses, the first representative legislative body in the European settlement of North America, predecessor of today's Virginia General Assembly, first convened by a Royal Governor, Sir George Yeardley, of Flowerdew Hundred Plantation. Also in 1619, the plantations and developed portions of the Colony were divided into four [...] "incorporations" [...] or [...] "citties," [...] as they were then called. These were (east to west) Elizabeth Cittie (initially known as Kecoughtan), James Cittie, Charles Cittie, and Henrico Cittie. Each cittie covered a very large area. Elizabeth Cittie not only included land on both side of the James River, but {{most of what we}} now know as South Hampton Roads and also included Virginia's Eastern Shore.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Hindfoot {{malalignment}} is {{a recognized}} cause of foot and ankle disability. For preoperative planning and clinical follow-up, reliable radiographic assessment of hindfoot alignment is important. <b>The</b> <b>long</b> axial radiographic <b>view</b> and the hindfoot alignment view {{are commonly used}} for this purpose. However, their comparative reliabilities are unknown. As hindfoot varus or valgus malalignment is most pronounced during mid-stance of gait, a unilateral weight-bearing stance, in comparison with a bilateral stance, could increase measurement reliability. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare the intra- and interobserver reliability of hindfoot alignment measurements of both radiographic views in bilateral and unilateral stance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A hindfoot alignment <b>view</b> and a <b>long</b> axial <b>view</b> were acquired from 18 healthy volunteers in bilateral and unilateral weight-bearing stances. Hindfoot alignment was defined as the angular deviation between the tibial anatomical axis and the calcaneus longitudinal axis from the radiographs. Repeat measurements of hindfoot alignment were performed by nine orthopaedic examiners. RESULTS: Measurements from the hindfoot alignment view gave intra- and interclass correlation coefficients (CCs) of 0. 72 and 0. 58, respectively, for bilateral stance and 0. 91 and 0. 49, respectively, for unilateral stance. <b>The</b> <b>long</b> axial <b>view</b> showed, respectively, intra- and interclass CCs of 0. 93 and 0. 79 for bilateral stance and 0. 91 and 0. 58 for unilateral stance. CONCLUSION: <b>The</b> <b>long</b> axial <b>view</b> is more reliable than the hindfoot alignment view or the angular measurement of hindfoot alignment. Although intra-observer reliability is good/excellent for both methods, only <b>the</b> <b>long</b> axial <b>view</b> leads to good interobserver reliability. A unilateral weight-bearing stance does not lead to greater reliability of measuremen...|$|R
40|$|Attending {{the opera}} in <b>the</b> <b>long</b> 18 th century was an {{experience}} quite unlike our own theatrical experience. The streets {{on the way}} to the building were dim (even if brighter than elsewhere in Europe), the auditorium was contrastingly bright, the theatre buildings smelt of damp, body odour, and urine, and the audiences were noisy. There were obvious differences, of course; changing fashions in clothes, interior decoration, and staging, coupled with changes in musical styles, altered aspects of the visual and aural experience. One of these changes - the changing curtain time - influenced not only when people eat but what they dined and supped. This paper will document the changes both in curtain times and menus, in <b>the</b> <b>longest</b> <b>view</b> of <b>the</b> 18 th century...|$|R
