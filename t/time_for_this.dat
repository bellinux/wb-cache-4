5|$|After filming was complete, test {{screenings}} were held, and {{the production}} team became aware of {{a problem with the}} ending. In the original ending, Ru'afo is ejected into space from the Son'a collector ship and de-ages rapidly as he floats amongst the rings of the planet Ba'ku. The revised ending saw the Enterprise swoop in at the last minute to save Picard and destroy the collector ship with Ru'afo aboard. The studio liked the new ending but wanted a bigger space battle. The production team agreed providing they could postpone the release to allow enough <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>this.</b> Because the studio wanted Insurrection to be released in time for Christmas, no further revisions were made to the ending.|$|E
5|$|During warmer weather, {{the wood}} turtle {{stays in the}} water for a larger {{percentage}} of the <b>time.</b> <b>For</b> <b>this</b> reason, during the winter months (and the late fall and early spring) it is considered an aquatic turtle. November through February or March is spent in hibernation {{at the bottom of a}} small, flowing river. The wood turtle may hibernate alone or in large groups. During this period, individuals bury themselves in the thick mud at the bottom of the river and rarely move. During hibernation, it is vulnerable to flash floods. Emergence does not occur until March or sometimes April, months that mark the beginning of its activation period (males are typically more active than females at this time).|$|E
5|$|Moving {{from the}} PlayStation Portable to the PlayStation 3 allowed the {{development}} team {{to add more}} details to the character designs, additional atmospheric sounds, as well as slightly tweak the gameplay system, now allowing camera control with the right analog stick. In addition, the Mirage Arena (a multiplayer component from the original game) has been reworked to only be a single-player experience. Yasue said enemy strengths and AI in the arena were adjusted to account for this. The inclusion of the Final Mix version in the collection marked the first <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> version to be released outside Japan.|$|E

30|$|Regarding the {{complexity}} of our model, simple models would take big computational <b>times.</b> <b>For</b> <b>this</b> reason, we proposed a two-phased algorithm.|$|R
25|$|In blindfolded solving, the {{contestant}} first {{studies the}} scrambled cube (i.e., {{looking at it}} normally with no blindfold), and is then blindfolded before beginning to turn the cube's faces. Their recorded <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> event includes both the time spent examining the cube and the time spent manipulating it.|$|E
25|$|The {{most direct}} {{solution}} would be to try all permutations (ordered combinations) and see which one is cheapest (using brute force search). The running <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> approach lies within a polynomial factor of , the factorial {{of the number of}} cities, so this solution becomes impractical even for only 20 cities.|$|E
25|$|Single-source inter-part {{boundary}} distances: A {{shortest path}} in G passes {{back and forth}} between G0nbsp& and G1nbsp& to compute the distances in G from r to all the boundary nodes. Alternating iterations use the all-boundary-distances in $G0nbsp& and $G1nbsp&. The number of iterations is O(√n), so the overall <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> stage is O(n α(n)) where α(n) is the inverse Ackermann function.|$|E
50|$|Broadcast <b>times</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> version are <b>for</b> the Eastern <b>Time</b> Zone. The show aired {{one hour}} {{earlier in the}} Central, Mountain and Pacific Time Zones.|$|R

50|$|Donnellan closed Michael of Carlos Place in 1971; his {{obituary}} {{notes that}} he didn't blame the market or the <b>times</b> <b>for</b> <b>this,</b> instead citing the shortage of skilled tailors available to British couturiers.|$|R
25|$|On 27 April 1943 Lush accidentally pricked {{her finger}} {{with a needle}} {{containing}} scrub typhus while inoculating a mouse. There was no effective treatment at the <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> often fatal disease. She died four weeks later, on 20 May 1943. Before her death she insisted that blood samples be taken from her to aid research. Unfortunately, the researchers were ultimately unable to develop a satisfactory vaccine.|$|E
25|$|Odd cycle {{transversal}} is an NP-complete algorithmic {{problem that}} asks, given a graphG=(V,E) and a numberk, whether {{there exists a}} set ofk vertices whose removal fromG would cause the resulting graph to be bipartite. The problem is fixed-parameter tractable, meaning {{that there is an}} algorithm whose running time can be bounded by a polynomial function {{of the size of the}} graph multiplied by a larger function of k. More specifically, the <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> algorithm is O(3k'mn), although this was not stated in that paper.|$|E
25|$|Instead, {{typically}} a dedicated machine tool is used. It has {{four to eight}} spindles and usually a rotary table. The cycle <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> type of setup {{is determined by the}} longest individual operation, which in this situation is determined by {{how long it takes to}} plunge and retract the tool through the bore. Throughput can be increased by completing two workpieces on each cycle; this is achieved by having two identical stations for each tool size so that two workpieces can be operated on concurrently.|$|E
2500|$|Houston won {{her first}} [...] "Best Female R Vocal Performance" [...] award through her career. She had been {{nominated}} six <b>times</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> category but not won. This was her sixth and final Grammy Award.|$|R
30|$|The {{results of}} this current study are {{comparable}} to those obtained previously, and demonstrate that the addition of an APP triage clinic significantly reduced waiting <b>times</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> patient cohort while managing the majority of patients autonomously.|$|R
50|$|Despite its name, {{an urban}} legend does not {{necessarily}} originate in an urban area. Rather, the term is used to differentiate modern legend from traditional folklore in pre-industrial <b>times.</b> <b>For</b> <b>this</b> reason, sociologists and folklorists prefer the term contemporary legend.|$|R
25|$|From {{this date}} on Vila do Desterro and mainly the port {{began to have}} a {{strategic}} function because it was situated halfway between Rio de Janeiro and Buenos Aires, possibly two of the largest seaside cities of South America at that <b>time.</b> <b>For</b> <b>this</b> reason in 1739 the Capitania da Ilha de Santa Catarina was created and Desterro became its capital. Soon the most expressive seaside defensive ring of Southern Brazil started to be built: Santa Cruz, São José da Ponta Grossa, Santo Antonio and Nossa Senhora da Conceição da Barra do Sul fortresses.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of time-sharing systems {{led to a}} number of problems. One was that users, particularly at universities where the systems were being developed, seemed to want to hack the system to get more CPU <b>time.</b> <b>For</b> <b>this</b> reason, security and access control became a major focus of the Multics project in 1965. Another ongoing issue was properly handling computing resources: users spent most of their time staring at the terminal and thinking about what to input instead of actually using the resources of the computer, and a time-sharing system should give the CPU time to an active user during these periods. Finally, the systems typically offered a memory hierarchy several layers deep, and partitioning this expensive resource led to major developments in virtual memory systems.|$|E
25|$|The riders {{of early}} domesticated horses {{probably}} used {{some type of}} bitless headgear made of sinew, leather, or rope. Components of the earliest headgear {{may be difficult to}} determine, as the materials would not have held up over <b>time.</b> <b>For</b> <b>this</b> reason, no one can say with certainty which came first, the bitted or the bitless bridle. There is evidence of the use of bits, located in two sites of the Botai in ancient Kazakhstan, dated about 3500-3000 BC. Nose rings appear on the equids portrayed on the Standard of Ur, circa 2600 BC - 2400 BC. To date, the earliest known artistic evidence of use of some form of bitless bridle comes in illustrations of Synian horseman, dated approximately 1400 BC.|$|E
50|$|There are {{no records}} {{indicating}} {{the history of}} pre-Hispanic <b>times</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> area. After the conquest the area {{became part of the}} encomienda system. Doña Angela de la Fleguera Castillo was the encomendera in 1722 and was in charge of 269 native inhabitants.|$|R
50|$|While {{developing}} the Pterodactyl Pfledge flying wing ultralight {{in the late}} 1970s, designer Jack McCornack experimented {{with a number of}} possible engines. Early flights used a German-made Sachs engine, but the high exchange rate and long lead <b>times</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> engine convinced him to try other options.|$|R
50|$|One source {{reports that}} Quartz Mountain {{climbing}} is very strenuous {{and that this}} mountain is not recommended for beginners. It {{has been compared to}} climbing at Joshua Tree National Park. Most of the climbing is done on the south face of the mountain, so summer is not a recommended <b>time</b> <b>for</b> climbing. Spring and fall are the best <b>times</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> activity.|$|R
25|$|It is {{straightforward}} {{to verify that}} a given graph with n vertices and m edges is claw-free in time O(n4), by testing each 4-tuple of vertices {{to determine whether they}} induce a claw. With more efficiency, and greater complication, one can test whether a graph is claw-free by checking, for each vertex of the graph, that the complement graph of its neighbors does not contain a triangle. A graph contains a triangle if and only if the cube of its adjacency matrix contains a nonzero diagonal element, so finding a triangle may be performed in the same asymptotic time bound as n'n matrix multiplication. Therefore, using the Coppersmith–Winograd algorithm, the total <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> claw-free recognition algorithm would be O(n3.376).|$|E
25|$|The {{band had}} {{originally}} planned to self-title their previous album, Documentaly (2011), {{due to the}} album's documentary theme. However, as {{the events of the}} 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami affecting the album's recording so much, as this did not reflect their attempt to express everything that was happening in 2011, as opposed to just what happened to the band. For their next album, they decided to revisit this idea. This was due to the band's greater exposure in Japan through their commercial tie-ups, which would mean a great number of people would be listening to Sakanaction for the first <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> album. Yamaguchi described making music for this new audience as feeling like the band were releasing their first album again, which strengthened their desire to self-title this release.|$|E
25|$|At {{the conference}} on 6 June, Gough took the view that if the Germans were {{thoroughly}} demoralised, {{it might be possible}} to advance to parts of the red line on the first day. Maxse and Rudolph Cavan (XIV Corps), felt that the range of their artillery would determine the extent of their advance and that it would need to be moved forward for the next attack. Gough drew a distinction between advancing against disorganised enemy forces, which required bold action and attacks on organised forces, which needed careful preparation, particularly of the artillery which would take three to seven days. Maxse's preference for a later beginning for the attack was agreed, except by Lieutenant-General Herbert Watts, the XIX Corps commander. A memorandum was issued summarising the conference, in which Gough stressed his belief in the need for front-line commanders to use initiative and advance into vacant or lightly-occupied ground beyond the objectives laid down, without waiting for orders. Relieving tired troops, gave time to the enemy, so a return to deliberate methods would be necessary afterwards. Judging the <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> was reserved for the army commander, who would rely on the reports of subordinates.|$|E
50|$|The Pussycat Dolls and Calvin Harris are the category's biggest winners, {{with each}} having won it twice. Madonna and Janet Jackson, {{on the other}} hand, {{are the two most}} {{nominated}} artists, each having been nominated six <b>times</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> category; followed by Jennifer Lopez, who has been nominated five times.|$|R
50|$|The {{area has}} been {{continually}} occupied since the prehistoric <b>times.</b> <b>For</b> <b>this</b> reason, many fruitful archaeological digs {{have been made in}} the area, unearthing mainly prehistoric findings. Velventos contains also many late Byzantine and post-Byzantine monuments and temples, among them the 12th-century church of Saint Minas and the 14th-century church of Saint Paraskevi.|$|R
50|$|L. minor is {{a solitary}} species {{and like most}} other praying mantises will only come {{together}} to mate. Mating <b>times</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> species are highly dependent upon weather conditions and prey availability. Typically females {{are most likely to}} accept a mate and have a successful clutch two weeks after their last molt.|$|R
25|$|One {{of the big}} {{activities}} is trips to base camp (aka trekking), which can be higher {{than some of the}} highest mountains. The other big activity is serious attempts {{to make it to the}} top of Everest, and those in support of those attempts. The peak <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> is late May, because that is when the monsoons push the jet stream away, there is another time later in the year when the monsoon ends yielding another break in the weather, but there is more snow then. Some technology for climbing include crampons, fixed ropes, various cold-weather gear, bottled oxygen, and weather prediction. Predicting the weather is critical, one of the big disasters came in 1996 when a storm hit during a summit bid. In modern times, there is greater on-demand logistical support available such as internet access, but also some new challenges like not offending the locals and watching out for oxygen-bottle thefts. Helicopter support has grown and the availability of helicopter rescues increased, but there are limits on how high and in what weather they are able to fly. Modern dangers remain unexpected avalanches (this claimed many in 2014 and 2015), sudden onset of altitude sickness, and that classic climbing danger- falling. For a price, permits are available from China in the Tibet region and from Nepal and there is a multitude of mountaineering firms world over operating on the mountain.|$|E

30|$|This study {{demonstrates}} that routine elective paediatric orthopaedic referrals can be successfully managed by an APP without recourse to consultant intervention. Waiting <b>times</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> patient cohort were reduced significantly while {{the capacity to}} see new elective patients was increased. These results firmly support the extended scope physiotherapist role in paediatric orthopaedics {{as an adjunct to}} paediatric orthopaedic services.|$|R
