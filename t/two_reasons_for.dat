5|$|The Supreme Court of the United States issued {{almost no}} {{constitutional}} criminal procedure decisions {{for its first}} century of existence. Professor Akhil Amar highlights <b>two</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> this. First, the Court's decision in Barron v. Baltimore (1833) meant that the federal constitution did not apply in state proceedings until the incorporation of the Bill of Rights after the Fourteenth Amendment. Second, the Court lacked general appellate jurisdiction over federal criminal cases until 1891.|$|E
5|$|There were <b>two</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> showing Oscar's {{head and}} {{shoulders}} within the frame during the flashback scenes, rather than letting the camera be the character's eyes. The first was {{that this is the}} way Noé usually sees himself in dreams and when recalling past events. He also thought it would be easier for the viewer to care about a character who is visible, as many point-of-view films, in his opinion, look unintentionally funny.|$|E
5|$|Augustine {{believed}} that a physical Hell exists, but that physical punishment is secondary to the punishment of being separated from God. He proposed <b>two</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> this: Firstly, humans have free will, and only those who choose to follow God will be forgiven and able to avoid Hell. Secondly, he {{believed that}} Adam and Eve's choice to sin affected our free choice, and that humans are left unable to resist sin. Augustine proposed that the grace of Jesus Christ freed humans from original sin, but he maintained that humans can only be saved {{if they choose to}} receive grace, and that this choice is formed by the character of individual humans. Accepting that even those who will be saved continue to sin, Augustine proposed that those who choose God's grace will still go to Hell for a time to purge them of their sin, before going to Heaven.|$|E

5|$|For {{the first}} {{twenty years of}} its existence, the only staged {{performances}} of Parsifal {{took place in the}} Bayreuth Festspielhaus, the venue for which Wagner conceived the work (except eight private performances for Ludwig II at Munich in 1884 and 1885). Wagner had <b>two</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> wanting to keep Parsifal exclusively for the Bayreuth stage. Firstly, he wanted to prevent it from degenerating into 'mere amusement' for an opera-going public. Only at Bayreuth could his last work be presented in the way envisaged by him – a tradition maintained by his wife, Cosima, long after his death. Secondly, he thought that the opera would provide an income for his family after his death if Bayreuth had the monopoly on its performance.|$|E
25|$|There were <b>two</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> {{this shift}} in {{preferred}} subject. The first was that Mexican society denigrated colonial culture—the indigenous past was seen as more truly Mexican. The other factor was a worldwide movement among artists to confront society, which began around 1830. In Mexico, this anti-establishment sentiment was directed at the Academy of San Carlos and its European focus.|$|E

25|$|In Spain, {{thalidomide}} {{was widely}} available throughout the 1970s, perhaps {{even into the}} 1980s. There were <b>two</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> this. First, state controls and safeguarding were poor; indeed, {{it was not until}} 2008 that the government even admitted the country had ever imported thalidomide. Second, Grünenthal failed to insist that its sister company in Madrid warn Spanish doctors, and permitted it to not warn them. The Spanish advocacy group for victims of thalidomide estimates that in 2015, there were 250–300 living victims of thalidomide in Spain.|$|E
25|$|Speaking {{about his}} {{activities}} in popularizing science, Sagan {{said that there}} were at least <b>two</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> scientists to share the purposes of science and its contemporary state. Simple self-interest was one: much of the funding for science came from the public, and the public therefore had the right to know how the money was being spent. If scientists increased public admiration for science, there was a good chance of having more public supporters. The other reason was the excitement of communicating one's own excitement about science to others.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} {{development}} of many organisms, the action potential is actually initially carried by calcium current rather than sodium current. The {{opening and closing}} kinetics of calcium channels during development are slower {{than those of the}} voltage-gated sodium channels that will carry the action potential in the mature neurons. The longer opening times for the calcium channels can lead to action potentials that are considerably slower than those of mature neurons. Xenopus neurons initially have action potentials that take 60–90 ms. During development, this time decreases to 1 ms. There are <b>two</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> this drastic decrease. First, the inward current becomes primarily carried by sodium channels. Second, the delayed rectifier, a potassium channel current, increases to 3.5 times its initial strength.|$|E
25|$|Chemical {{recycling}} of PET will become cost-efficient only applying high capacity recycling lines {{of more than}} 50,000 tons/year. Such lines could only be seen, if at all, within the production sites of very large polyester producers. Several attempts of industrial magnitude to establish such chemical recycling plants {{have been made in}} the past but without resounding success. Even the promising chemical recycling in Japan has not become an industrial breakthrough so far. The <b>two</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> this are: at first, the difficulty of consistent and continuous waste bottles sourcing in such a huge amount at one single site, and, at second, the steadily increased prices and price volatility of collected bottles. The prices of baled bottles increased for instance between the years 2000 and 2008 from about 50 Euro/ton to over 500 Euro/ton in 2008.|$|E
25|$|Viruses in the Paramyxoviridae {{family are}} also antigenically stable, {{meaning that the}} glycoproteins on the viruses are {{consistent}} between different strains of the same type. There are <b>two</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> this phenomenon. The first is that the genome is non-segmented and thus cannot undergo genetic reassortment. In order for this process to occur, segments are needed as reassortment happens when segments from different strains are mixed {{together to create a}} new strain. With no segments, nothing can be mixed with one another and so there is no antigenic shift. The second reason relates to the idea of antigenic drift. Since RNA dependent RNA polymerase does not have an error checking function, many mutations are made when the RNA is processed. These mutations build up and eventually new strains are created. Due to this concept, one would expect that paramyxoviruses should not be antigenically stable; however, the opposite is seen to be true. The main hypothesis behind why the viruses are antigenically stable is that each protein and amino acid has an important function. Thus, any mutation would lead to a decrease or total loss of function, which would in turn cause the new virus to be less efficient. These viruses {{would not be able to}} survive as long compared to the more virulent strains, and so would die out.|$|E

25|$|Mature axon tracts {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} to experience growth when mechanically stretched at the central portion of the axon cylinder. Such mechanical stretch was applied by a custom axon stretch-growth bioreactor composed of four main components: custom-designed axon expansion chamber, linear motion table, stepper motor and controller. The nerve tissue culture is placed within the expansion chamber with a port for gas exchange and a removable stretching frame, which is able to separate two groups of somas (neuron cell bodies) and thus stretch their axons. Collagen gel was used to promote the growth of larger stretch-grown axon tracts that were visible to the unaided eye. There are <b>two</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> the growth enhancement due to the collagen coating: 1) the culture became hydrophobic after the collagen dried, which permitted a denser concentration of neurons to grow, and 2) the collagen coating created an unobstructed coating across the two elongation substrates. Examination by scanning electron microscope and TEM {{showed no signs of}} axon thinning due to stretch, and the cytoskeleton appeared to be normal and intact. The stretch-grown axon tracts were cultured on a biocompatible membrane, which could be directly formed into a cylindrical structure for transplantation, eliminating the need to transfer axons to a scaffold after growth was complete. The stretch-grown axons were able to grow at an unprecedented rate of 1cm/day after only 8 days of acclimation, which is much greater than the 1mm/day maximal growth rate as measured for growth cone extension. The rate of 1mm/day is also the average transport speed for structural elements such as neurofilaments.|$|E

When introducing Follmer to the show, they wanted to strengthen John Doggett's (Robert Patrick) and Reyes relationship. The second reason was {{that they wanted to}} create a character different from Doggett; according to John Shiban, they wanted from the start to have a character who was basically [...] "anti-Doggett".|$|E
500|$|Although {{the central}} square mile of the City of Adelaide is {{designed}} to the points of the compass, the monument sits at a 45 degree angle to North Terrace. The architects provided <b>two</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> this. First, {{it was observed that}} [...] "monuments suffer materially from monotonous lighting" [...] when they face to the south; and second, the placing of the monument to face a north-west direction allows it to be in line with both the Cross of Sacrifice and St. Peter's Cathedral. In addition to these two arguments, Richardson also notes that the diagonal positioning of the memorial permits the dawn sun to fall on the facade.|$|E

500|$|Abbott {{stated that}} there were <b>two</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> what he {{considered}} to be the show's failure.

The other was the play-within-the-play, which had not been thoroughly thought out by anyone. According to Abbott, Hammerstein remained [...] "positively Sphinx-like" [...] on the subject. At a loss to understand the characters of the play-within-the play, Alton came up with nothing more than routine song-and-dance numbers. During the run, the duo approached choreographer Jerome Robbins and asked him if he could fix the dances. Robbins said that he could, but he would not, as [...] "it would kill Bob Alton". According to Hammerstein biographer Hugh Fordin, [...] " [...] intended contrast between onstage and backstage life was never achieved because the onstage show was so tepid and confusing." ...|$|E
500|$|Chapter four {{considers}} liberalism, {{a political}} theory which, according to Cochrane, {{has as its}} defining feature a valuation of [...] "the free and equal individual person". Cochrane focuses primarily upon John Rawls, whose social contract account offers <b>two</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> the rejection of animals from issues of basic justice: questions of reciprocity, for which animals are ill-suited, and questions of personhood, as all parties to the contract must be moral persons. Cochrane criticises Rawls's exclusion of animals, before identifying the risks to animals inherent within liberal pluralism. The possibility of a Rawlsian account including animals, such as those offered by Donald VanDeVeer and Mark Rowlands, is considered and rejected; Cochrane outlines problems with placing questions of species membership behind the veil of ignorance and outlines Garner's fundamental criticisms of Rawls. Modified versions of personhood that include animals are discussed. Cochrane closes the chapter by arguing that personhood and welfare should both be considered important; in so doing, he points towards his own conception of justice for animals.|$|E
