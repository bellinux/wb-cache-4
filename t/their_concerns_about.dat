Managers however have voiced <b>their</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>about</b> the latter and the excessive cost of live rights is partly a reason why top-flight football has not returned to the BBC or ITV. In 2005 BSkyB's monopoly on live rights ended after the European Commission ruled that the Premier League needed to have more than one holder.|$|E
5|$|In 1926, a {{delegation}} of Supreme Council officers met with President Calvin Coolidge to share with him <b>their</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>about</b> the persecution of Catholics in Mexico during its revolution, which had considered the Church part of a corrupt establishment to be overthrown.

5|$|The Afghan Emir {{was warned}} by New Delhi of the {{approach}} of the expedition even while efforts were underway to intercept it in the Persian desert. After it crossed into Afghanistan, the Emir was asked to arrest the members. However, Habibullah humoured the British without obeying the Viceroy's requests. He told the Viceroy that he intended to remain neutral and could not take any actions that were overtly pro-British. Indian intelligence became aware—after the expedition had already been Kabul for some time—that they carried with them highly inflammatory letters from the Kaiser and the Turkish Sultan. Through British channels, the Russians voiced <b>their</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>about</b> the Emir's tolerance of the German presence and their intrigues with Pro-German Afghan counsellors.|$|E

5|$|The anti-Hindi activists from Madras State {{were not}} {{satisfied}} with the 1967 Amendment, as it did not address <b>their</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>about</b> the three language formula. However, with DMK in power, they hesitated to restart the agitation. The Tamil Nadu Students' Anti-Hindi imposition Agitation council split into several factions. The moderate factions favored letting Annadurai and the government to deal with the situation. The extremist factions restarted the agitations. They demanded scrapping of the three language formula and an end to teaching of Hindi, abolishing the use of Hindi commands in the National Cadet Corps (NCC), banning of Hindi films and songs and closure of the Dakshina Bharat Hindi Prachara Sabha (Institution for Propagation of Hindi in South India).|$|E
5|$|While {{the other}} Visegrád members {{were invited to}} join NATO at its 1997 Madrid summit, Slovakia was {{excluded}} based on what several members considered undemocratic actions by nationalist Prime Minister Vladimír Mečiar.

In {{an open letter to}} US President Bill Clinton, more than forty foreign policy experts including Bill Bradley, Sam Nunn, Gary Hart, Paul Nitze, and Robert McNamara expressed <b>their</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>about</b> NATO expansion as both expensive and unnecessary given the lack of an external threat from Russia at that time.|$|E
5|$|In {{the middle}} of the 2012–13 posting season, MLB {{approached}} NPB seeking to change the way MLB teams bid for the right to negotiate with NPB players. Instead of using a silent auction in which teams bid blindly, MLB would prefer its teams to participate in a traditional, open auction where the bids are known and teams can knowingly outbid each other. Such a change would likely lower the price of the transfer fees paid to NPB teams. MLB and the players' unions agree that they'd prefer to see the players receive more money for the transfer rather than the teams. The Japan Times columnist Jason Coskrey also believed that these talks provided the JPBPA an opportunity to voice <b>their</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>about</b> the posting system and attempt to gain more leverage for themselves during the posting process. The new agreement, as noted, was announced on December 16, 2013, with most of the changes desired by MLB and players from both leagues.|$|E
