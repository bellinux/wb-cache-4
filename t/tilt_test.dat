40|$|Background: A {{systematic}} evaluation {{focused on}} {{sensitivity and specificity}} of head-up <b>tilt</b> <b>testing</b> (HUT) for diagnosing vasovagal syncope has not been previously performed. We conducted a meta-analysis of studies comparing HUT outcome between patients with syncope of unknown origin and control subjects without previous syncope. Methods: We searched Pubmed and Embase databases for all English-only articles concerning case-control studies estimating the diagnostic yield of HUT, and selected 55 articles, published before March 2012, including 4361 patients and 1791 controls. The influence of age, <b>test</b> duration, <b>tilt</b> angle, and nitroglycerine or isoproterenol stimulation on <b>tilt</b> <b>testing</b> outcome was analyzed. Results: Head-up <b>tilt</b> <b>testing</b> demonstrated {{to have a good}} overall ability to discriminate between symptomatic patients and asymptomatic controls with an area under the summary receiver-operating characteristics curve of 0. 84 and an adjusted diagnostic odds ratio of 12. 15 (p < 0. 001). A significant inverse relationship between sensitivity and specificity of <b>tilt</b> <b>testing</b> for each study was observed (p < 0. 001). At multivariate analysis, advancing age and a 60 ° tilt angle showed a significant effect in reducing sensitivity and increasing specificity of the test. Nitroglycerine significantly raised <b>tilt</b> <b>testing</b> sensitivity by maintaining a similar specificity in comparison to isoproterenol. Conclusions: The results from this meta-analysis show the high overall performance of HUT for diagnosing vasovagal syncope. Our findings provide useful information for evaluating clinical and instrumental parameters together with pharmacological stressors influencing HUT accuracy. This could allow the drawing of <b>tilt</b> <b>testing</b> protocols tailored on the diagnostic needs of each patient with unexplained syncope...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} the clinical characteristics of subgroups {{of patients with}} unexplained syncope having electrophysiologic studies and head-up <b>tilt</b> <b>testing</b> and to assess the efficacy of various therapies. Design: Retrospective study. Setting: Inpatient services of a tertiary referral center. Patients: Eighty-six consecutively referred patients with unex-plained syncope. Measurements: All patients had electrophysiologic examinations. Patients with negative results subsequently had head-up <b>tilt</b> <b>testing.</b> Main Results: Twenty-nine (34 %) patients (group 1) had abnor-mal electrophysiologic results, with sustained monomorphic ven-tricular tachycardia induced in 72 %. Thirty-four (40 %) patients (group 2) had syncope provoked by head-up <b>tilt</b> <b>testing.</b> The cause of syncope remained unexplained in 23 (26 %) patients (group 3). Structural heart disease was present in 76 %, 6 %, and 30 % of groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. In group 1, pharmacologic or nonpharmacologic therapy was recommended based on electro-physiologic evaluation. All group 2 patients had negative results on head-up <b>tilt</b> <b>testing</b> while receiving oral beta blockers (27 patients) or disopyramide (7 patients). Group 3 patients did not receive any specific therapy. During a median follow-up period of 18. 5 months, syncope recurred in 9 (10 %) patients. Conclusions: The combination of electrophysiologic evaluation and head-up <b>tilt</b> <b>testing</b> can identify the underlying cause of syncope {{in as many as}} 74 % of patients presenting with unexplained syncope. Therapeutic strategies formulated according to the results of these diagnostic tests appear to prevent syncope effectively in most patients...|$|R

40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESThis {{study was}} {{conducted}} to develop a time-efficient <b>tilt</b> table <b>test.</b> BACKGROUNDCurrent protocols of <b>tilt</b> table <b>testing</b> are quite time-consuming. This study was designed to assess the diagnostic value, tolerance and procedural time of a single-stage isoproterenol tilt table protocol. METHODSA single-stage isoproterenol <b>tilt</b> table <b>test</b> was compared with the passive <b>tilt</b> table <b>test.</b> The study was prospectively designed in a randomized and crossover fashion. RESULTSThe study population consisted of 111 patients with a history of syncope (mean age 55 ± 20 years). Of the total, 62 patients (56 %; 95 % confidence interval, 46 % to 65 %) had a positive vasovagal response during isoproterenol <b>tilt</b> table <b>testing</b> and 35 (32 %; 23 % to 41 %) during passive <b>tilt</b> table <b>testing</b> (p = 0. 002). The mean procedural times of the study population were 11. 7 ± 3. 6 min and 36. 9 ± 13. 3 min for isoproterenol and passive <b>tilt</b> table <b>testing,</b> respectively (p < 0. 001). All patients tolerated single-stage isoproterenol testing. In the 23 control subjects (mean age 34 ± 11 years), the apparent specificities were 91 % (72 % to 99 %) and 83 % (61 % to 99 %) for passive and single-stage <b>tilt</b> table <b>testing,</b> respectively. CONCLUSIONSThe single-stage isoproterenol <b>tilt</b> table <b>test</b> was more effective in inducing a positive vasovagal response in an adult population than the standard passive <b>tilt</b> table <b>test,</b> and it significantly reduced the procedural time. The increase in positive yield was associated with a moderate decrease in apparent specificity. These observations support the conclusion that single-stage <b>tilt</b> table <b>testing</b> could be a reasonable diagnostic option in patients undergoing syncope evaluation...|$|R
40|$|The {{control of}} upper body (UB) {{orientation}} {{relative to the}} pelvis in the frontal plane was characterized by analyzing responses to external perturbations consisting of continuous pelvis tilts (eyes open [EO] and eyes closed [EC]) and visual surround tilts (EO) at various amplitudes. Lateral sway of the lower body was prevented on all tests. UB sway was analyzed by calculating impulse–response functions (IRFs) and frequency–response functions (FRFs) from 0. 023 to 10. 3 Hz for pelvis <b>tilt</b> <b>tests</b> and FRFs from 0. 041 to 1. 5 Hz for visual <b>tests.</b> For pelvis <b>tilt</b> <b>tests,</b> differences between FRFs were limited to frequencies < 3 Hz and were dependent on stimulus amplitude. IRFs were nearly identical across all pelvis <b>tilt</b> <b>tests</b> for the first 0. 2 s, but showed amplitude-dependent changes in their time course at longer time lags. The availability of visual orientation cues (EO vs. EC) had only a small effect on the UB sway during pelvis <b>tilt</b> <b>tests.</b> This small effect of vision {{was consistent with the}} small UB sway evoked on visual <b>tilt</b> <b>tests.</b> Experimental results were interpreted using a feedback model of UB orientation control that included time-delayed sensory integration, short-latency reflexive mechanisms, and intrinsic biomechanical properties of the UB. Variation in model parameters indicated that subjects shifted toward reliance on vestibular information and away from proprioceptive information as pelvis tilt amplitudes increased. For visual tilt stimuli, model parameters indicated that subjects shifted toward reliance on vestibular and proprioceptive information and away from visual information as the stimulus amplitude increased...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{usefulness}} of esmolol {{in predicting the}} efficacy of treatment with an oral beta-adrenergic blocking agent was evaluated in 27 consecutive patients with neurocardiogenic syncope. Seventeen patients had a positive head-up <b>tilt</b> <b>test</b> response at baseline and 10 patients required intravenous isoproterenol for provocation of hypotension. All patients were then given a continuous esmolol infusion (500 μg/kg per min loading dose for 3 min followed by 300 μg/kg per min maintenance dose) and rechallenged with a head-up <b>tilt</b> <b>test</b> at baseline or with isoproterenol. Of the 17 patients with a positive baseline <b>tilt</b> <b>test</b> response, 11 continued {{to have a positive}} response to esmolol challenge. Sixteen patients (including all 10 patients with a positive <b>tilt</b> <b>test</b> response with isoproterenol) exhibited a negative response to upright tilt during esmolol infusion. Irrespective of their response to esmolol infusion, all patients had a follow-up <b>tilt</b> <b>test</b> with oral metoprolol after an interval of ≥ 5 half-lives of the drug. All 16 patients (100 %) with a negative <b>tilt</b> <b>test</b> response during esmolol infusion had a negative <b>tilt</b> <b>test</b> response with oral metoprolol. Of the 11 patients with a positive <b>tilt</b> <b>test</b> response during esmolol infusion, 10 (90 %) continued to have a positive response with oral metoprolol. It is concluded that in the electrophysiology laboratory, esmolol can accurately predict the outcome of a head-up tilt response to oral metoprolol.

40|$|Background: Syncope is an {{important}} and common clinical condition, and the neurally mediated syncope is the most frequent type of syncope. Tilt testing is considered as a first-line diagnostic test. Materials and Methods: We conducted the conventional and modified <b>tilt</b> <b>test</b> on 200 subjects in the age range of 5 - 20 years. In conventional protocol, the patient was tilted for up to 15 min without medication. If syncope did not develop, the patient received 0. 1 mg/kg sublingual isosorbide dinitrate. Then, the patient was continued to be tilted for another 15 min. In modified <b>tilt</b> <b>test,</b> before starting the test, the patient received 0. 1 mg/kg isosorbide dinitrate sublingually in supine position. Then, the table was tilted for a maximum of 25 min or until the test became positive. Results: In conventional <b>tilt</b> <b>test</b> group 79. 13 % and in modified <b>tilt</b> <b>test</b> group 87. 06 % of subjects showed positive results. In conventional <b>tilt</b> <b>test,</b> the mean of response time was 17. 67 ± 4. 74 min. The mean of the total time of conventional <b>tilt</b> <b>test</b> was 49. 81 ± 5. 57 min.

40|$|Studies into {{rockfill}} {{have advocated}} {{the use of}} a <b>tilt</b> <b>test</b> to characterise the shear strength of coarse granular materials. The <b>tilt</b> <b>test</b> employs a simple split box, which is filled with rubble and then tilted until the upper box half slides off the lower box half. The angle at which this occurs is related to strength characteristics of the tested material, but the interpretation of this result is less than straight forward. This paper describes a systematic study of the <b>tilt</b> <b>test</b> on a series of gravels and mine wastes. The research shows that the tilt angle is sensitive to the tilt rate and the water content of the spoil, but that if the test is carried out in a systematic way, consistent results can be achieved. The results show that the <b>tilt</b> <b>test</b> is not a good discriminator of shear strength in waste rock materials. The <b>tilt</b> <b>test</b> is very sensitive to particle size, particle shape and relative density, but because of its very low confining stress, it is insensitive to the physical strength of particles.

In the control group, positive responses during the passive, glyceryl trinitrate, and isoprenaline phases occurred in one, one, and two cases, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of the protocols were 55 % and 94. 7 %, respectively, for glyceryl trinitrate v 58 % and 89. 4 % for isoprenaline. Owing to discordant responses in 75 % of the cases, the sequential use of the tests (if one was negative) would increase the sensitivity to 84 % while decreasing the specificity slightly (to 84 %). Side effects were less frequent with glyceryl trinitrate.  CONCLUSIONS—Sublingual glyceryl trinitrate <b>tilt</b> <b>testing</b> is an effective and safe alternative to the isoprenaline infusion test {{and can be used}} as a complementary <b>test.</b>    Keywords: syncope; <b>tilt</b> table test; isoprenaline; glyceryl trinitrat...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{define the}} {{responses}} to head up tilt in {{a large group of}} normal adult subjects using the most widely employed protocol for <b>tilt</b> <b>testing.</b>  METHODS— 127 normal subjects aged 19 - 88 years (mean (SD), 49  (20) years) without a previous history of syncope underwent <b>tilt</b> <b>testing</b> at 60 ° for 45  minutes or until syncope intervened. Blood pressure monitoring was performed with digital photoplethysmography, providing continuous, non-invasive, beat to beat heart rate and pressure measurements.  RESULTS— 13 % of subjects developed vasovagal syncope after a mean (SD) tilt time of 31. 7  (12. 4) minutes (range 8. 5 - 44. 9 minutes). Severe cardioinhibition during syncope was observed less often than is reported in patients investigated for syncope. There were no differences in the age or sex distributions of subjects with positive or negative outcomes, or in the proportions with cardioinhibitory and vasodepressor vasovagal syncope compared with previously reported patient populations. Subjects with negative outcomes showed age related differences in heart rate and blood pressure behaviour throughout tilt.  CONCLUSIONS—False positive results with tilting appear to be common. This has important implications for the use of diagnostic <b>tilt</b> <b>testing.</b> The magnitude of the heart rate and blood pressure changes observed during negative tilts largely invalidates previously suggested criteria for abnormal non-syncopal outcomes.    Keywords: syncope; head up tilt; postural hypotensio...|$|R
