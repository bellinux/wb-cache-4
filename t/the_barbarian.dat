5|$|Thrud <b>the</b> <b>Barbarian</b> is a comics {{character}} {{created by}} Carl Critchlow in 1981. Although Thrud himself is {{a parody of}} Conan <b>the</b> <b>Barbarian,</b> particularly as depicted in the Arnold Schwarzenegger films, inspiration for the character's adventures and adversaries has been drawn from several fantasy sources.|$|E
5|$|Characters, place names, and {{titles in}} Pratchett's books often contain puns, allusions and culture references.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Barbarian</b> and Haku began teaming in the WWF {{as early}} as 1990, as they were both managed by Bobby Heenan. They feuded with The Big Bossman, interfering in several of his matches to attack him. They made their only {{pay-per-view}} appearance with the WWF at WrestleMania VII, where they lost to The Rockers. They also appeared on several episodes of WWF Prime Time Wrestling in 1991. They faced the Legion of Doom on April 15 but lost when Haku accidentally kicked <b>The</b> <b>Barbarian.</b> The team's miscommunication was a problem again on the July 22 episode when <b>The</b> <b>Barbarian</b> accidentally kicked Haku in a match against The Bushwhackers, causing Haku to get pinned. <b>The</b> <b>Barbarian</b> and Haku were successful the following week, however, when they defeated Sato and Mr. Fuji. The pair left the WWF, but they later teamed in New Japan Pro Wrestling. They challenged The Hell Raisers for the IWGP Tag Team Championship but were unable to win the belts.|$|E
5|$|The Faces of Fear {{eventually}} split up, as Meng turned face. The former partners {{faced each}} other at Road Wild 1998; <b>The</b> <b>Barbarian</b> had heel manager Jimmy Hart in his corner. Meng won the match, but <b>The</b> <b>Barbarian,</b> Hugh Morrus and Hart attacked him after the match. Hart later convinced <b>The</b> <b>Barbarian</b> and Meng to reconcile, however, and they wrestled as a tag team again as part of Hart's First Family stable. The Faces of Fear entered a tournament for the WCW World Tag Team Championship in early 1999 after an injury to co-champion Rick Steiner caused the belts to be vacated. According {{to the rules of}} the tournament, teams had to lose two matches before they were eliminated. The Faces of Fear won one match in the tournament, defeating the team of David Taylor and Fit Finlay on the January 25 episode of WCW Monday Nitro. However, they were eliminated after losses to the team of Mike Enos and Bobby Duncum, Jr. and the team of Horace Hogan and Brian Adams. In the latter match, <b>The</b> <b>Barbarian</b> attacked Meng, which caused the loss and led to the team splitting up for good.|$|E
5|$|At SuperBrawl VII on February 23, 1997, the Faces of Fear {{competed in}} a Three Way match. They faced The Public Enemy and Harlem Heat but lost when Rocco Rock from The Public Enemy pinned <b>The</b> <b>Barbarian.</b> At Fall Brawl 1997, <b>The</b> <b>Barbarian</b> and Meng faced Wrath and Mortis. Because Wrath and Mortis {{were part of}} a heel group, WCW had the Faces of Fear compete as faces during the match. Wrath and Mortis won the match, as Wrath pinned Meng for the victory. The Faces of Fear were {{successful}} at World War 3 1997, however, when they defeated the team of Glacier and Ernest Miller.|$|E

5|$|Players control Conan <b>the</b> <b>Barbarian</b> from a third-person {{perspective}} {{while attempting}} to advance through the series of levels that subdivide the game. The gameplay {{is the same for}} each level: Conan moves from area to area, fighting groups of enemies until he reaches the end. At the end of certain levels, <b>the</b> <b>barbarian</b> has to fight a more powerful opponent called a boss. Defeating a boss involves a two-stage process: Conan has to inflict heavy damage on the creature and thus trigger an interactive button-pressing sequence that players have to complete to kill the boss. Several cycles of this process are required to defeat most bosses. Besides combat, button-pressing sequences are also used to interact with the environment, such as knocking down obstacles to create passageways, or as parts of platforming sequences in which Conan climbs walls and jumps from ledge to ledge. Players can save their progress by using special stones that are placed throughout the game.|$|E

5|$|The Faces of Fear was the {{professional}} wrestling tag team of <b>The</b> <b>Barbarian</b> and Meng in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) that existed between 1996 and 1999. The two were first paired {{together in the}} World Wrestling Federation (WWF) as part of The Heenan Family, a villainous faction, where Meng was known as Haku. In WCW, they teamed together regularly {{as members of the}} Dungeon of Doom. They appeared on several WCW pay-per-view events but did not receive a push from the promotion and were unsuccessful in their matches for the World Tag Team Championship. The team split up after <b>The</b> <b>Barbarian</b> turned on Meng in 1998 and they feuded with each other throughout the year. They briefly reunited in 1999 before Barbarian turned on Meng again and the team dissolved.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} between the Dungeon of Doom and the Four Horsemen broke down {{as a result of}} Kevin Sullivan's feud with Horsemen member Chris Benoit.

Benoit pinned Meng to win the match for the Horsemen team. <b>The</b> <b>Barbarian</b> and Meng's next major appearance was at Starrcade 1996, when they faced Scott Hall and Kevin Nash, who were members of another rival heel stable known as the New World Order.

5|$|According to this view, <b>the</b> <b>barbarian</b> {{officers}} and men {{recruited by the}} late army, coming from tribes that were traditional enemies of Rome, had no real loyalty to Rome and often betrayed her interests, colluding with invading barbarian tribes, especially if those tribes were their own. At the same time, the spread of barbarian customs and culture led {{to a decline in}} traditional military discipline, and internal army disunity due to friction between Romans and barbarians. Ultimately, the army degenerated into just a collection of foreign mercenary bands that were incapable of defending the empire effectively.|$|E
