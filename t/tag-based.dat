25|$|Although {{the early}} word {{processors}} evolved to use <b>tag-based</b> markup for document formatting, most modern word processors {{take advantage of}} a graphical user interface providing some form of what-you-see-is-what-you-get ("WYSIWYG") editing. Most are powerful systems consisting of one or more programs that can produce a combination of images, graphics and text, the latter handled with type-setting capability. Typical features of a modern word processor include multiple font sets, spell checking, grammar checking, a built-in thesaurus, automatic text correction, web integration, HTML conversion, pre-formatted publication projects such as newsletters and to-do lists, and much more.|$|E
25|$|Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite is a {{fighting}} video game developed {{and published by}} Capcom. It is the sixth main entry in the Marvel vs. Capcom series of crossover games. Like previous installments, players control characters from both the Marvel Comics and Capcom universes to compete in tag team battles. Infinite features two-on-two fights, {{as opposed to the}} three-on-three format used in its preceding titles. The series' traditional character assists have been removed; instead, the game incorporates a <b>tag-based</b> combo system, which allows players to instantly switch between their two characters to form continuous combos. It also introduces a new gameplay mechanic {{in the form of the}} Infinity Stones, which temporarily bestow players with unique abilities and stat boosts depending on the type of stone selected.|$|E
500|$|Skullgirls {{received}} {{its share of}} criticism. IGN's Ryan Clements criticized the small selection of gameplay modes, missing character move lists, and overly aggressive AI. GameTrailers criticized the limited roster size, stating that the <b>tag-based</b> battling felt underdeveloped as a result. Simon Parkin of Eurogamer pointed out the lack of online features, such as a spectator mode, replays, and endless lobbies. Jordan Mallory of Joystiq reprimanded the game for its [...] "goofy and immature" [...] premise, sexualized art style, and unoriginal character movesets. Mallory concluded that the series {{would have been better}} off spending another year in development.|$|E
2500|$|For {{expression}} profiling, or high-throughput {{analysis of}} many genes within a sample, quantitative PCR may be performed {{for hundreds of}} genes simultaneously {{in the case of}} low-density arrays. A second approach is the hybridization microarray. A single array or [...] "chip" [...] may contain probes to determine transcript levels for every known gene in the genome of one or more organisms. Alternatively, [...] "tag based" [...] technologies like Serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) and RNA-Seq, which can provide a relative measure of the cellular concentration of different mRNAs, can be used. An advantage of <b>tag-based</b> methods is the [...] "open architecture", allowing for the exact measurement of any transcript, with a known or unknown sequence. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) such as RNA-Seq is another approach, producing vast quantities of sequence data that can be matched to a reference genome. Although NGS is comparatively time-consuming, expensive, and resource-intensive, it can identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms, splice-variants, and novel genes, and {{can also be used to}} profile expression in organisms for which little or no sequence information is available.|$|E

5000|$|In {{order to}} {{properly}} understand {{the operation of}} a programmable logic controller (PLC), {{it is necessary to}} spend considerable time programming, testing, and debugging PLC programs. PLC systems are inherently expensive, and down-time is often very costly. In addition, if a PLC is programmed incorrectly it can result in lost productivity and dangerous conditions. PLC simulation software is a valuable tool in the understanding and learning of PLCs and to keep this knowledge refreshed and up to date. PLC simulation provides users with the ability to write, edit and debug programs written using a <b>tag-based</b> format. Many of the most popular PLCs use tags, which are a powerful method of programming PLCs but also more complex. PLC simulation integrates <b>tag-based</b> ladder logic programs with 3D interactive animations to enhance the user’s learning experience. [...] These interactive animations include traffic lights, batch processing, and bottling lines.|$|E

5000|$|Descriptors are an {{architectural}} feature of Burroughs large systems, including the current (as of 2006) Unisys Clearpath/MCP systems. Apart from being stack- and <b>tag-based,</b> a notable architectural feature {{of these systems}} {{is that it is}} descriptor-based. Descriptors are the means of having data that does not reside on the stack as for arrays and objects. Descriptors are also used for string data as in compilers and commercial applications.|$|E
50|$|Prior to RNA-Seq, gene {{expression}} studies {{were done with}} hybridization-based microarrays. Issues with microarrays include cross-hybridization artifacts, poor quantification of lowly and highly expressed genes, and needing to know the sequence a priori. Because of these technical issues, transcriptomics transitioned to sequencing-based methods. These progressed from Sanger sequencing of Expressed Sequence Tag libraries, to chemical <b>tag-based</b> methods (e.g., serial analysis of {{gene expression}}), and finally to the current technology, next-gen sequencing of cDNA (notably RNA-Seq).|$|E
50|$|One type of {{generator}} is an XML Server Page (XSP http://cocoon.apache.org/1.x/xsp.html), an XML document containing <b>tag-based</b> directives that specify how {{to generate}} dynamic content at request time. Upon Cocoon processing, these directives {{are replaced by}} generated content so that the resulting, augmented XML document can be subject to further processing (typically an XSLT transformation). XSPs are transformed into Cocoon producers, typically as Java classes, though any scripting language for which a Java-based processor exists could also be used.|$|E
5000|$|The LiftDNA core {{technology}} solution enabled accurate impression and {{user level}} pricing for blind <b>tag-based</b> network demand which fed RTB / exchanges to bid accurately in the adserver. [...] "Predictive Pricing" [...] was a breakthrough that enabled publishers to host super auctions within their ad servers, with real-time bidders and traditional ad networks competing simultaneously for impressions the moment an ad call occurs. All of LiftDNA publisher clients came from existing SSP, where they subsequently saw revenue increases ranging from 50-150%.|$|E
5000|$|Like in the {{original}} SAGE protocol, so-called ditags are formed, using blunt-ended tags. However, SuperSAGE avoids the bias observed during the less random LongSAGE 20 bp ditag-ligation. By direct sequencing with high-throughput sequencing techniques (next-generation sequencing, i.e. pyrosequencing), hundred thousands or millions of tags can be analyzed simultaneously, producing very precise and quantitative gene expression profiles. Therefore, <b>tag-based</b> gene expression profiling also called [...] "digital gene expression profiling" [...] (DGE) can today provide most accurate transcription profiles that overcome the limitations of microarrays.|$|E
50|$|Semantic file {{systems are}} file systems used for {{information}} persistence which structure the data {{according to their}} semantics and intent, rather than the location as with current file systems. It allows the data {{to be addressed by}} their content (associative access). Traditional hierarchical file-systems tend to impose a burden, for example when a sub-directory layout is contradicting a user's perception of where files would be stored. Having a <b>tag-based</b> interface alleviates this hierarchy problem and enables users to query for data in an intuitive fashion.|$|E
50|$|An {{annotated}} peptide spectral library {{can also}} be used as a reference for protein/peptide identification. It offers the unique strength of reduced search space and increased specificity. The limitations include spectra not included in the library will not be identified, spectra collected from different types of mass spectrometers can have quite distinct features, and reference spectra in the library may contain noise peaks, which may lead to false positive identifications. A number of different algorithmic approaches have been described to identify peptides and proteins from tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), peptide de novo sequencing and sequence <b>tag-based</b> searching.|$|E
