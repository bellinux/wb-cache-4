Kagame strove to portray the government as inclusive and not Tutsi dominated. He directed removal of ethnicity from citizens' national identity cards, and the government began a policy of downplaying the distinctions among Hutu, Tutsi, and Twa.|$|E

Since Russia announced an embargo on imports of foodstuffs in <b>the</b> EU <b>countries,</b> <b>the</b> exports of food products to Russia has significantly decreased in <b>the</b> EU <b>countries.</b> This decrease in exports has had a negative impact {{not only to the}} relations between <b>the</b> <b>countries</b> <b>but</b> also to <b>the</b> economies of <b>the</b> <b>countries...</b>|$|R
