50|$|The {{precedence}} diagram method (PDM) is a tool for scheduling activities in a project plan. It is a method of constructing a project <b>schedule</b> <b>network</b> <b>diagram</b> that uses boxes, referred to as nodes, to represent activities and connects them with arrows that show the dependencies. It is also called the activity-on-node (AON) method.|$|R

Airlines make a rational organization of surplus aircraft {{to generate the}} best scheduling solution. The present research constructs an aircraft dynamic <b>scheduling</b> <b>network</b> <b>diagram,</b> define the surplus aircrafts’ available routings and create aircraft dynamic scheduling mathematical model. Through a mixture column generation algorithm with heuristic methods, the research find the routings in the optimal aircraft dynamic scheduling program.

40|$|Quality <b>schedule</b> <b>network</b> <b>diagrams</b> are {{characterized}} by containing the entire time and logic information of the schedule in a highly legible format. This working paper presents an algorithm with which schedulers can improve {{the clarity of the}} graphical representations of <b>schedule</b> <b>networks</b> that they create. The algorithm has been designed to emulate the approach that a human scheduler takes when being asked to prepare a manually drawn activity-on-the-node diagram. Activities are automatically placed into a grid so that closely dependent activities are located near each other and the number of logic link crossings within the <b>schedule</b> <b>network</b> is kept low. An illustrated step-by-step example assists with using the algorithm, which itself is written in intuitive pseudo-code. Various considerations for good graphics design of schedule are provided. Under ongoing research into <b>schedule</b> <b>network</b> analysis and optimization it is planned to investigate more powerful arranging algorithms and to develop a software implementation...|$|R
40|$|Summary. The {{concept of}} {{algorithmic}} models appeared from the algorithmic approach {{in which the}} simulated object, the phenomenon appears {{in the form of}} process, subject to strict rules of the algorithm, which placed the process of operation of the facility. Under the algorithmic model is the formalized description of the scenario subject specialist for the simulated process, the structure of which is comparable with the structure of the causal and temporal relationships between events of the process being modeled, together with all information necessary for its software implementation. To represent the structure of algorithmic models used algorithmic network. Normally, they were defined as loaded finite directed graph, the vertices which are mapped to operators and arcs are variables, bound by operators. The language of algorithmic networks has great features, the algorithms that it can display indifference the class of all random algorithms. In existing systems, automation modeling based on algorithmic nets, mainly used by operators working with real numbers. Although this reduces their ability, but enough for modeling a wide class of problems related to economy, environment, transport, technical processes. The task of modeling the execution of <b>schedules</b> and <b>network</b> <b>diagrams</b> is relevant and useful. There are many counting systems, network graphs, however, the monitoring process based analysis of gaps and terms of graphs, no analysis of prediction execution schedule or schedules. The library is designed to build similar predictive models. Specifying source data to obtain a set of projections from which to choose one and take it for a new plan...|$|R

50|$|In {{the network}} stage {{a model of}} the system as a whole is {{developed}} and represented as a system specification diagram (SSD) (also known as a <b>network</b> <b>diagram).</b> <b>Network</b> <b>diagrams</b> show processes (rectangles) and how they communicate with each other, either via state vector connections (diamonds) or via datastream connections (circles). In this stage is the functionality of the system defined. Each entity becomes a process or program in the <b>network</b> <b>diagram.</b> External programs are later added to the <b>network</b> <b>diagrams.</b> The purpose of these programs is to process input, calculate output and to keep the entity processes up-to-date.

40|$|We {{propose a}} “layered {{structured}} network diagram,” {{which consists of}} layers of time differences. We have implemented a tool called “NeL 2 ” for handling layered structured <b>network</b> <b>diagrams.</b> Layered structured <b>network</b> <b>diagrams</b> have multiple accumulated layers and are not single diagrams. Using this layered structure, time differences can be included in one diagram. In addition, various type of information, such as the overall tendency in a diagram during a specific period of time, can be visualized. We used layered structured <b>network</b> <b>diagrams</b> to show the co-authorship network of academic literature. Changes in the co-authorship network become visible using the layered structured <b>network</b> <b>diagram.</b> We can read various information such as changes of active research communities and other phenomena.
