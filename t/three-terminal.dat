500|$|Y and Δ are {{important}} topologies in linear network analysis due to these being the simplest possible <b>three-terminal</b> networks. A Y-Δ transform {{is available for}} linear circuits. [...] This transform is important {{because there are some}} networks that cannot be analysed in terms of series and parallel combinations. An example of this is the network of figure 1.6, consisting of a Y network connected in parallel with a Δ network. [...] Say it is desired to calculate the impedance between two nodes of the network. [...] In many networks this can be done by successive applications of the rules for combination of series or parallel impedances. [...] This is not, however, possible in this case where the Y-Δ transform is needed in addition to the series and parallel rules.Redifon, p.22 ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{potentiometer}} or pot is a <b>three-terminal</b> resistor with a {{continuously adjustable}} tapping point controlled by rotation of a shaft or knob or by a linear slider. [...] It {{is called a}} potentiometer {{because it can be}} connected as an adjustable voltage divider to provide a variable potential at the terminal connected to the tapping point. A volume control for an audio device is a common use of a potentiometer. [...] A typical low power potentiometer (see drawing) is constructed of a flat resistance element (B) of carbon composition, metal film, or conductive plastic, with a springy phosphor bronze wiper contact (C) which moves along the surface. [...] An alternate construction is resistance wire wound on a form, with the wiper sliding axially along the coil. [...] These have lower resolution, since as the wiper moves the resistance changes in steps equal to the resistance of a single turn.|$|E

The LM317 series (+1.25 V) regulates positive voltages while the LM337 series (−1.25 V) regulates negative voltages. The adjustment is performed by constructing a potential divider with its ends between the regulator output and ground, and its centre-tap connected to the 'adjust' terminal of the regulator. The ratio of resistances determines the output voltage using the same feedback mechanisms described earlier.|$|E

5000|$|The {{most common}} way to vary the {{resistance}} in a circuit {{is to use}} a rheostat.

5000|$|... "When {{trying to}} solve a {{seemingly}} difficult problem, Sam said {{to concentrate on the}} easier ones first; the rest, including the hardest ones, will follow," [...] recalled Andrew Viterbi, co-founder and former vice-president of Qualcomm. He had been a thesis advisee under Samuel Mason at MIT, and this was one lesson he especially remembered from his professor. A few years earlier, Mason had heeded his own advice when he defined a unilateral power gain for a linear two-port device, or U. After concentrating on easier problems with power gain in feedback amplifiers, a figure of merit for all <b>three-terminal</b> devices followed that is still used today as Mason's Invariant.|$|E
50|$|Potentiometers and {{trimmers}} are <b>three-terminal</b> electromechanical parts, {{containing a}} resistive path with an adjustable wiper contact. Along with the failure modes for normal resistors, mechanical wear on the wiper and the resistive layer, corrosion, surface contamination, and mechanical deformations {{may lead to}} intermittent path-wiper resistance changes, which are a problem with audio amplifiers. Many types are not perfectly sealed, with contaminants and moisture entering the part; an especially common contaminant is the solder flux. Mechanical deformations (like an impaired wiper-path contact) can occur by housing warpage during soldering or mechanical stress during mounting. Excess stress on leads can cause substrate cracking and open failure when the crack penetrates the resistive path.|$|E
50|$|<b>Three-terminal</b> {{devices such}} as {{transistors}} and FETs also use {{a connection to the}} control terminal of the device being tested such as the Base or Gate terminal. For transistors and other current based devices, the base or other control terminal current is stepped. For field effect transistors, a stepped voltage is used instead. By sweeping the voltage through the configured range of main terminal voltages, for each voltage step of the control signal, a group of V-I curves is generated automatically. This group of curves makes it very easy to determine the gain of a transistor, or the trigger voltage of a thyristor or TRIAC.|$|E
