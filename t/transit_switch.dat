50|$|With the {{firmware}} upgrade announced in December 2011, the M8024-k {{is also an}} Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) <b>transit</b> <b>switch</b> that can extend an available FCoE fabric. The M8024-k uses FCoE Initialization Protocol (FIP) to perform functions of FC_BB_E device discovery, initialization and maintenance. The FIP snooping feature enables the M8024-k to link Dell M-Series blades to an external top-of-rack or end-of-row FCoE forwarding switch and provides FCoE connectivity to the servers. This feature, along with Internet SCSI optimization, iSCSI TLV, and DCBx discovery and monitoring, enables seamless 10GbE performance in an end-to-end data center solution. In addition, with the recent firmware release, up to 6 M8024-k switches can now be stacked and managed through a single IP. Stacking is done by assigning (multiple) 10Gb Ethernet ports as stacking-ports.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{high-speed}} network architecture called Dynamic Transfer Mode, DTM. At {{the entrance of}} the DTM network, destination addresses such as IP addresses are converted into DTM routing information and attached to the packet header. In a DTM network, a connection is set up on-the-fly by sending a series of routing link identifiers to the destination, so burst data transfers like WWW tra#c are efficiently carried. A connection between adjacent nodes is created and released dynamically within the burst transfer period. This yields higher statistical multiplexing gain and improved bandwidth e#ciency compared to with conventional STM. Time division multiplexing is utilized so delay jitter or cell loss, the major drawbacks of Asynchronous Transfer Mode, are avoided. This paper analyzes the performance of a DTM network and describes an implemented switching system. Because a DTM network uses source-routing and passive STM switching, it simplifies the core <b>transit</b> <b>switch</b> while localizing intelligence to edge nodes. A simplified core <b>transit</b> <b>switch</b> is well suited for future high-speed backbone networks...|$|E

50|$|Both {{games were}} repackaged {{featuring}} colorful, illustrated manuals that were as educational {{as they were}} informative. Additional game content was added to both Wilderness and Tranquility Base, the latter of which was rechristened Lunar Explorer: A Spaceflight Simulator. The games were distributed through Electronic Arts' new affiliated label program. Although both games were well-reviewed—especially Wilderness—neither sold well enough to make much profit. Electric <b>Transit</b> later <b>switched</b> to a new distributor, Spectrum Holobyte, but the products were {{near the end of}} their life cycle. With two of the principles, Ford and Huntress, having full-time careers elsewhere, and no profits to fund new development, the company folded after two years of operation.|$|R

40|$|In {{the recent}} decade, global {{backbone}} providers have emerged to link dispersed networks. Local networks obtain global connectivity through <b>transit</b> contracts with <b>switching</b> hubs. Using the Shapley value, the paper {{shows that the}} bargaining position of the local network depends upon the quality adjusted volume of net traffic, and that the rent to the hub depends on the volume of traffic between local networks. When there are two competing switching hubs, the larger hub can appropriate most of the rent. Anticipating this, the hubs tend to expand their capacity to preempt the market like in the prisoners¡¯ dilemma. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{heuristic}} {{procedure is}} developed to assign buses to transit centers (garages) {{in such a}} way that all the buses on a particular route are assigned to a single transit center. This research builds on an optimal mixed integer programming location/allocation model that splits the bus assignments when capacity limitations were reached at a transit center. The heuristic procedure adopts a two-step process: namely, assignment of all buses of a route to a unique <b>transit</b> center, then <b>switching</b> of routes to alternative transit centers to enforce capacity limitations. The procedure is shown to still provide cost savings over current locations and allocations for the Vancouver Regional Transit System (VRTS), Canada’s largest urban transit net...|$|R
40|$|This {{presentation}} is about young migrants’ journeys with low chances of receiving asylum {{or any other}} type of residence in Europe. These migrants exhibit a highly complex migration pattern. First, these migrants are frequently in durable “transit” across Europe, moving back and forth between different states. Second, transit migrants must exhibit a high degree of flexibility, as they have to respond to suddenly changing conditions, such as work opportunities, rejection of asylum claims, detention or deportation. Third, <b>transit</b> migrants often <b>switch</b> between different legal statuses, such as asylum seeker, rejected asylum seeker, illegal worker or detainee. This throws them into a general state of uncertainty and psychological distress. The experience of these young adults shows a deep ambivalence between a sense of autonomy, on the one hand, and of profound hope- and powerlessness, on the other. This presentation explores the “fragmented journeys” of these migrants, by way of a multi-sited ethnographic approach and biographical interviews. It focuses on the lived experiences and the strategies of irregular migrants {{to find a way to}} reside in Europe in the context of an increasingly restrictive migration management...|$|R
50|$|Rail {{and road}} links {{connecting}} North East India {{to the rest}} of the country passed through East Bengal territory. The lines connecting Siliguri in North Bengal to Kolkata and Assam to Chittagong were severed. The whole Assam Railway was cut off from the rest of the Indian system. These lines carried almost all freight traffic from these regions. The most important commodities were tea and timber. The tea industry in Assam depended on the Chittagong port to export its produce and import raw materials for the industry such as coal which was used as the fuel to dry the tea leaves. The industry was severely hit as Chittagong port went to Pakistan. Initially India and Pakistan reached an agreement to allow cross border transit traffic but now India had to pay a tariff. By 1950, India reconnected Assam {{to the rest of}} the country's rail network by building a 229 km meter gauge rail link through the Siliguri Corridor. But now the Tea chests from Assam's gardens would have to be carried over a much longer distance to reach the Kolkata port. Exporting tea via the nearby Chittagong port was still an option but after 1965's war all <b>transit</b> traffic was <b>switched</b> off by Pakistan.|$|R
50|$|In 1948, {{the city}} Board of Transportation took {{over all of}} the bus lines on Staten Island, and on July 1, 1948 the bus fare on Staten Island dropped from 5 cents per zone (20 cents Tottenville to the ferry) to 7 cents for the whole island, or 12 cents {{including}} a Manhattan subway ride. In 1947, the SIRT carried 12.3 million passengers and the number started decreasing with 8.7 million in 1948 and 4.4 million in 1949, {{as a result of}} rapid <b>transit</b> customers <b>switching</b> from the SIRT to the buses. As a result of the 7 cent fare, the SIRT announced on August 28, 1948, that it would reduce service on all three branches on September 5, 1948. Service would be reduced from 15 minute intervals in non-rush hours to 30 minutes during that time, and from 5 to 10 minutes in rush hours to 10 to 15 minutes during rush hours. The reduction of the bus fare meant that passenger traffic dropped 32% on the Tottenville Division and 40% on the other two divisions in July. The day afterwards, Richmond Borough President Cornelius A. Hall and Staten Island civic organizations announced that they would oppose the cuts that were proposed in service. On September 2, 1948, the PSC failed to prevent the cut in SIRT service. 237 of its present 492 weekday trains would be cut and the schedule of its expresses would be reduced during rush hours. Thirty percent of the company's personnel were laid off. The cuts became effective at 3:01 A. M. on September 5, 1948, and at the same hour schedules calling for a reduction in rush hour service and the cancellation of all night trains after 1:29 A. M. On September 7, 1948, Borough President Hall of Richmond continued to rally against the cuts made by the SIRT at a Public Service Commission (PSC) hearing in Manhattan. Commuters testified that trains were missing connections to ferry boats and that some trains were being held at the Saint George Terminal in the rush hour to wait for two boatloads of passengers. Previously, they said, the trains pulled out with only one boatload of passengers. On September 13, 1948, the SIRT agreed to add four trains, and to extend the schedule of four others. Bus riders were up 25% after fare cut, and passengers on the SIRT dropped.|$|R
40|$|Honesty {{is vital}} to {{scientific}} work and, clearly, most scientists are honest. However, recent publicity about cases involving cheating, including cases of falsification of data and plagiarism, raises some questions: Is cheating a problem? Does it affect management science? Should anything be done? My interest in scientific cheating began years ago, when I {{was responsible for the}} marketing research on a government-sponsored research contract. The purpose of the project was to examine an approach to urban transportation, which I will call the Urban Transit Plan (UTP). The government supported this research because of the potential social benefits if commuters were to switch from their automobiles to the UTP. My initial studies showed that more commuters would switch to the UTP from the existing mass <b>transit</b> than would <b>switch</b> from au-tomobiles. Thus, instead of producing social benefits, the UTP would increase social costs. So what happened? First, I was asked by the project leader to “check ” my results. What 1 inferred from this request was that 1 should not report these results, but should do studies until I obtained the desired results. I commissioned additional independent studies, but these supported the initial findings. Subsequently, I learned from informal sources that my reports were “lost ” when the project leader reported to the government agency. Despite my objections to the project leader, additional reports were also lost. Therefore, I took action to ensure that the government received the reports. My action led to “peer review ” whereby the 15 members of the project team, mostly university faculty, were asked b...|$|R
40|$|This thesis explores and {{evaluates the}} {{essential}} strategies needed for <b>transit</b> agencies to <b>switch</b> from traditional fare collection systems to smart cards. More transit agencies today {{are investing in}} smart card technology {{as part of their}} new automated fare collection (AFC) systems. Although the benefits of switching to smart card systems have been well-researched and acknowledged by transit agencies, it is unclear how a transit agency should go about implementing a smart card system in order to achieve optimum customer acceptance and to reap maximum benefits from the system. Recent experience has shown that a range of implementation policy decisions {{can go a long way}} towards speeding or slowing down the adoption of the technology by customers. A case study approach is used here to identify and evaluate the effectiveness and impacts of policies used by five transit agencies that currently employ smart cards. These policies fall into two categories: 1) distribution, operational and usage policies, and 2) fare policies. Distribution, operational and usage policies must be designed to facilitate and enhance customer adoption of smart cards, especially in the case where alternative fare media will co-exist. (cont.) Fare policies are designed to differentiate smart cards from other fare media through differential pricing strategies, frequent-use bonuses and low price guarantees. The thesis also examines the use of fare models in assisting transit agencies to predict ridership and revenue, especially focusing on the features needed in these models to predict the usage rates of smart cards and their associated unique fare options. Finally, the findings from the research are integrated and used to develop a set of guidelines for use by a transit agency that is switching to a smart card fare payment system. The main topics of these guidelines were identified as: 1) the use of fare policy incentives, 2) balance between restrictions and alternatives with respect to co-existing fare media, 3) accessibility to smart card support services, 4) capitalizing on the superiority of smart card technology, and 5) the use of a single card. To illustrate the usefulness of the guidelines, they were applied to a case study of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) 's new AFC program, the CharlieCard. by Yi Hong. Thesis (S.
