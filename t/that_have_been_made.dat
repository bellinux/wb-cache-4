5|$|Whoever {{looks in}} the past and thinks about the time of 1919 to 1932 will be {{overpowered}} by great pain {{in the face of the}} mistakes <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>made.</b> When Hitler published his book Mein Kampf, it was time to begin the most stringent battle against the theories proposed in that book. Hitler proposed to do away with all present parties and institutions, even those brought about after centuries of sacrifices and great exertion. What would a man do if a thief announced a proposed break-in? Anybody would make security arrangements. And what did the government and the representatives of the people do? As much as nothing. A tired, weak and sick population, as well as a weak government, let a charlatan of the worst sort promise them healing. For every problem this quack had the only right medicine. He alone possessed the magic wand that would uproot human weakness and produce angels.|$|E
5|$|Book Seven, The Age of Great Progress, is set {{during the}} 19th century and begins during {{a war between}} the Ottoman Empire and the Indian state of Travancore. The Indians have {{previously}} defeated the Mughals and the Safavids and have developed more modern forms of warfare, emphasising surprise and mobility, they have also invented Steam engines and Ironclad warships which they sail straight {{to the city of}} Konstantiniyye and capture it with the aid of military balloons. The Ottomans are defeated easily. A Muslim Armenian doctor named Ismail ibn Mani al-Dir, who had served the Ottoman Sultan, is captured and sent to Travancore where he learns of the amazing advancements <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> on the sub-continent such as railways and factories. He happily joins the hospital of Travancore and begins work in anatomy and physiology. Ismail eventually meets their ruler, the Kerala of Travancore, who pursues scientific and philosophical advancement (a kind of Enlightened Despot). The Kerala's aim is to drive the Muslim invaders away and peacefully unify India into a kind of democratic confederation. Later, during the Xianfeng Emperor's reign, in the Chinese colony known as Gold Mountain, major flooding in the Central Valley of California forces the evacuation of Chinese colonial towns and Japanese settlers alike. The Japanese had originally fled to the new world to escape Chinese oppression in their homeland, but find themselves once again under the Chinese yoke. A displaced Japanese slave, Kiyoaki, and a pregnant Chinese refugee, Peng-ti, manage to flee to the great coastal city of Fangzhang. There Kiyoaki joins a secret Japanese freedom movement which is being aided by Travancore, with Ismail acting as a go-between agent.|$|E

25|$|For civil matters, {{the repeal}} of section56A means that the Subordinate Courts Act no longer {{stipulates}} that constitutional questions must be referred to the High Court. However, this continues to be necessary in Magistrate's Court proceedings because these courts lack jurisdiction to deal with constitutional questions, as mentioned above. Assuming that declarations can be sought from District Courts, decisions <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> by these courts may be appealed to the High Court and the Court of Appeal in the usual manner. Alternatively, a party apply to the High Court for the constitutional question {{to be heard in}} a separate action.|$|E
25|$|A {{resolution}} to impeach the President {{has to be}} passed by a two-third majority {{of the total number}} of members of the originating house. It is then sent to the other house. The other house investigates the charges <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>made.</b> During this process, the President has the right to defend oneself through an authorised counsel. If the second house also approves the charges made by special majority again, the President stands impeached and is deemed to have vacated their office from the date when such a resolution stands passed. No president has faced impeachment proceedings so the above provisions have never been used.|$|E

25|$|Martin Hall {{writes that}} the history of Iron Age {{research}} south of the Zambezi shows the prevalent influence of colonial ideologies, both in the earliest speculations {{about the nature of the}} African past and in the adaptations <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> to contemporary archaeological methodologies. Preben Kaarsholm writes that both colonial and black nationalist groups invoked Great Zimbabwe's past to support their vision of the country's present, through the media of popular history and of fiction. Examples of such popular history include Alexander Wilmot's Monomotapa (Rhodesia) and Ken Mufuka's Dzimbahwe: Life and Politics in the Golden Age; examples from fiction include Wilbur Smith's The Sunbird and Stanlake Samkange's Year of the Uprising.|$|E
25|$|Taking {{any of the}} tree-lined {{staircases}} to {{the next}} level of campus leads to the ITE, Engineering, and Fine Arts buildings, all of which can also be accessed though shortcuts from any of the multitude of buildings on Academic Row.

New lots have also been constructed outside of the Performing Arts and Humanities building in order to accommodate more commuter students and faculty. Fall of 2015 brings with it two new roundabouts <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>made</b> at the intersection of Administration Drive and Research Park Drive and between Research Park Drive and the entrance ramp on to I-95.|$|E
25|$|The Grade II listed Anglican parish {{church of}} All Saints {{is located at}} the west end of Carshalton High Street, {{opposite}} Carshalton Ponds. A church has stood on this site since at least Norman times and probably much longer. The current church contains 12th century work; the tower is the oldest part of the building and is thought to date back to before the Norman Conquest. The church has been much extended over the centuries: the north side, which most visitors see first, is a Victorian facade constructed mostly of dark flint; but the south side is earlier, and shows signs of the many alterations <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>made.</b> The most significant change to the building was in 1891 when a new nave and north aisle were added. The dramatic west end gallery, which accommodates the large three manual Willis Organ, was designed by the Anglo-catholic architect Ninian Comper.|$|E
