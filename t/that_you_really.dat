25|$|The {{execution}} {{by lethal}} injection began at 10:53pm EDT. In his final words, Davis maintained his innocence, saying:Well, first of all I'd like to address the MacPhail family. I'd like to let you all know, despite the situation – I know {{all of you are}} still convinced that I'm the person that killed your father, your son and your brother, but I am innocent. The incident that happened that night was not my fault. I did not have a gun that night. I did not shoot your family member. But I am so sorry for your loss. I really am – sincerely. All I can ask is that each of you look deeper into this case, so <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> will finally see the truth. I ask my family and friends that you all continue to pray, that you all continue to forgive. Continue to fight this fight. For those about to take my life, may God have mercy on all of your souls. God bless you all. He was declared dead at 11:08pm EDT.|$|E
500|$|Despite being {{presented}} as a [...] "polished commercial group" [...] in their radio appearances, Deep Purple's stage excesses and success in the US {{did not make a}} good impression on British audiences. The Deviants frontman and later journalist Mick Farren described Deep Purple's music as [...] "a slow and pompous din, somewhere between bad Tchaikovsky and a B-52 taking off on a bombing run." [...] They were also criticised for being too American and the [...] "poor man's Vanilla Fudge". As Brian Connolly of Sweet recalled, [...] "they were so out of place <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> felt sorry for them." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} the year, {{the album}} {{received}} one vote in the Village Voice Pazz & Jop music critics poll. Rob Sevier, co-founder of the label The Numero Group, and Games, a collaboration between Daniel Lopatin (Oneohtrix Point Never) and Joel Ford, named Rain in England one of their favorite albums of the year. Dean Blunt of the electronic duo Hype Williams admired the album and said, [...] "it was artistic, it was the merit. ... Part of the reason it's so interesting, {{part of the reason why}} I think this is so good, it's a juxtaposition of two things <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> don't think are meant to be together." [...] Oakland, California rapper Kreayshawn said Lil B [...] "was an influence on me. I was starting to listen to his music and hanging out with him a lot when he was working on Rain in England." [...] Cloud rap duo Main Attrakionz has been compared to the style of Rain in England.|$|E

500|$|It {{was always}} the same sort of system with us. We would write the nucleus of the song, the melody primary music, and then some of the words were there as we {{finished}} writing it. I started playing some rock 'n' roll piano and started boogie woogie-ing my left hand, and that inspired Mariah {{to come up with the}} melodic [...] 'I don't want a lot for Christmas.' And then we started singing and playing around with this rock 'n' roll boogie song, which immediately came out to be the nucleus of what would end up being 'All I Want For Christmas Is You.' That one went very quickly: It was an easier song to write than some of the other ones. It was very formulaic, not a lot of chord changes. I tried to make it a little more unique, putting in some special chords <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> don't hear a lot of, which made it unique and special.|$|E
500|$|Stengel {{has been}} praised {{for his role}} in {{successfully}} launching the Mets. Appel deemed the Mets' beginnings unique, as later expansion teams have been given better players to begin with, [...] "few expansion teams in any sport have tried the formula—a quotable, fan-popular man who would charm the press and deflect attention away from ineptness on the field." [...] Arthur Daley of The New York Times wrote, [...] "he gave the Mets the momentum they needed when they needed it most. He was the booster that got them off the ground and on their journey. The smoke screen he generated to accompany the blast-off obscured the flaws and gave the Mets an acceptance and a following they could not have obtained without him." [...] James wrote, [...] "Stengel became such a giant character <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> can't talk about him in the past. He became an enduring part of the game." [...] Commissioner William Eckert said of Stengel, [...] "he's probably done more for baseball than anyone." ...|$|E
500|$|Recording of Satisfied {{began in}} September 2007 at Southern Tracks Recording in Atlanta, Georgia. [...] As with DecembeRadio's {{previous}} album, Scotty Wilbanks {{was hired as}} the producer. [...] Said Reedy of Wilbanks, [...] "We just have a kindredship as musicians and as players.... There's {{a lot of excitement}} and passion that comes from his end.... big thing for us is having a really good time. [...] If we're not having a good time making a record, it's gonna show and you're gonna hear it." [...] To capture the excitement of their live shows, DecembeRadio recorded basic tracks live in the studio. [...] Reedy said recording live is particularly useful for capturing energetic performances from drummer Boone Daughdrill. [...] "It's definitely very critical for him to be on top of his game and feeling like it's a unit, because you play off of each other. [...] It's a real push and pull thing that happens in rock and roll music <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> can't sometimes capture by just doing it track by track by track", said Reedy. [...] Miker said the band recorded a handful of songs that were [...] "out of the box of where CCM music is", and Reedy noted that some tracks [...] "stretched what we're doing ... with production." [...] "Gasoline", for example, includes a [...] "Beatlesque" [...] section with a children's choir, string section and piccolo trumpet, and [...] "Falling for You" [...] begins and ends with some guitar [...] "shred licks" [...] that started as a joke in the writing process.|$|E
6000|$|... "And your {{connexion}} with Courcy Castle," [...] {{continued the}} countess, now carrying up {{the list of}} Frank's advantages to its great climax, [...] "will make the matter so easy for <b>you,</b> <b>that</b> <b>really,</b> <b>you</b> will hardly have any difficulty." ...|$|R

2500|$|She {{spent much}} of her {{childhood}} apart from other children, although she devoted much time to her pets, whom she adored. She eventually made friends with a group of other girls in Torquay, and she noted that [...] "one of the highlights of my existence" [...] was her appearance with them in a youth production of Gilbert and Sullivan's The Yeomen of the Guard, in which she played the hero, Colonel Fairfax. This was her last operatic role for, as she later wrote, [...] "an experience <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> enjoyed should never be repeated." ...|$|E
2500|$|Motoring {{journalist}} Jeremy Clarkson, {{a famous}} critic of hybrid vehicles and the Toyota Prius especially, admitted {{he loved the}} GS 450h. After claiming that you {{spent most of the}} time on the Prius [...] "chewing a lot of fuel" [...] and [...] "making a green statement," [...] he described [...] "with the Lexus I drove up and down Piccadilly all day. It was great." [...] He also felt that the GS 450h was [...] "balanced nicely by the styling, the quality and the sense <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> are in something a little bit different." [...] Clarkson also positively referred to the benefit of a hybrid car being exempt from the London congestion charge (for a £10 one off administration fee to register it). In 2009, the GS 450h received a new hybrid-only grille and refreshing.|$|E

2500|$|I {{think we}} were fairly smart with [...] "Spoonman" [...] in <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> don't see us that much in the video. You see various {{pictures}} of us, but it's {{not quite the same}} as having us in your living room all the time. We're trying to maintain some degree of mystique about Soundgarden, I guess. I remember back when I was a kid, long before MTV, {{and the only way to}} see my favorite bands was to go to their concerts. It was an incredible experience. MTV has helped a lot of bands, but they've also helped rob a lot of groups of that special mystique. It's tough when you can see a great rock band on TV one second, then hit the clicker and be watching a soap opera or a sitcom the next. That's what rock and roll has become for some people.|$|E
2500|$|Classical Presbyterianism held Calvin's view of [...] "pneumatic {{presence}}" [...] or [...] "spiritual feeding", a real presence by the Spirit {{for those}} who have faith. John Calvin [...] "can be regarded as occupying a position roughly midway between" [...] the doctrines of Martin Luther on one hand and Huldrych Zwingli on the other. He taught that [...] "the thing that is signified is effected by its sign", declaring: [...] "Believers ought always to live by this rule: whenever they see symbols appointed by the Lord, to think and be convinced that the truth of the thing signified is surely present there. For why should the Lord put in your hand the symbol of his body, unless it was to assure you <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> participate in it? And {{if it is true that}} a visible sign is given to us to seal the gift of an invisible thing, when we have received the symbol of the body, let us rest assured that the body itself is also given to us." ...|$|E
2500|$|Complexity. Doubts were {{expressed}} as to workability of FATCA {{due to its}} complexity, and the legislative timetable for implementation was pushed back multiple times. According to U.S. national taxpayer advocate Nina Olsen in regards to FATCA: [...] "This {{is a piece of}} legislation that is so big and so far-reaching, and [...] so many different moving pieces, and is rolling out in an incremental fashion (...) <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> won’t be able to know what its consequences are, intended or otherwise,’ Olson said. [...] "I don’t think we’ll know that for years. And by that point we’ll actually be a little too late to go, [...] "Oops, my bad, we shouldn’t have done this,’ and then try to unwind it." [...] Bloomberg reported in 2015 that the IRS help center is not able to provide adequate taxpayer customer service. In 2016, the Taxpayer Advocate reported that [...] "FATCA implementation has created significant compliance burdens and risk exposures" [...] for overseas Americans, and its [...] "heavy-handed approach, especially when combined with the complexity surrounding IRS requirements, has negative consequences, both for FFIs and the IRS".|$|E

2500|$|Unlike the {{previous}} albums where the band felt their lyrics were obtuse {{they wanted to}} be direct with the song meaning and based the song's lyrics on love and their relationships. Taylor described [...] "Alley Cats" [...] as one of Goddard's more private songs and speculated that the song seemed [...] "to partly be about his mother and wishing that she was alive to hear this song that he's singing". Taylor stated that the words of the chorus [...] "relate to when you're feeling something <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> love is coming to an end, and saying that's not really possible". The song [...] "I Feel Better" [...] was described by Taylor as a song [...] "trying to reach a kind of positive conclusion and positive state of mind whilst also trying to think about the terrible state the world is in". Doyle explained that the lyrics were about [...] "the malaise of living in a world where there's climate change and finding solace in the arms of your partner".|$|E
2500|$|In July, Feige {{discussed}} specific {{moments in}} the film, including an homage to The Amazing Spider-Man issue 33 where Parker is trapped underneath rubble, something Feige [...] "wanted {{to see in a}} movie for a long, long time". Daley said that they added the scene to the script because of how much Feige wanted it, and explained, [...] "We have [...] starting the scene with such self-doubt and helplessness, in a way <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> see the kid. You feel for him. He's screaming for help, because he doesn't think he can do it, and then ... he kind of realizes that that's been his biggest problem." [...] Feige compared the film's final scene, where Parker accidentally reveals that he is Spider-Man to his Aunt May, to the ending of Iron Man when Stark reveals that he is Iron Man to the world, saying, [...] "what does that mean for the next movie? I don't know, but it will force us to do something unique." [...] Goldstein added that it [...] "diminishes what is often the most trivial part of superhero worlds, which is finding your secret. It takes the emphasis off that [...] lets her become part of what's really his life". Feige also talked about the film's revelation that the Vulture is the father of Parker's love interest, saying, [...] "If that didn't work, the movie didn't work. We worked backwards and forwards from that moment. It was like two movies—it was the movie up until then and the movie after that moment. Because it had to surprise you, but it had to be true, also. You had to believe that we had set it up so that you would buy it [...] doesn't seem like something out of left field. That's a pretty great moment and we didn't know until we showed it to audiences" [...] that it would work. Watts said the revelation scene and the following interactions between the Vulture and Parker were, [...] "more than anything else, [...] I was looking forward to, and I got {{to have a lot of}} fun shooting that stuff." [...] Goldstein said the scene after the reveal, where Vulture realizes that Parker is Spider-Man while driving him to the school dance, was the moment he was most proud of in the film, and Daley said that scene's effect on audiences was the dramatic equivalent of an audience laughing at a joke they had written. He added that the writers were [...] "giddy when we first came up with , because it's taking the obvious tension of meeting the father of the girl that you have a crush on, and multiplying it by 1,000, when you also realize he's the guy you've been trying to stop the whole time." ...|$|E
