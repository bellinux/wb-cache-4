5|$|In 2007, for {{the first}} time, Justice Commissioner Franco Frattini {{included}} Parliament in <b>talks</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> second Schengen Information System even though MEPs only needed to be consulted on parts of the package. After that experiment, Frattini indicated {{he would like to}} include Parliament in all justice and criminal matters, informally pre-empting the new powers they could gain as part of the Treaty of Lisbon. Between 2007 and 2009, a special working group on parliamentary reform implemented a series of changes to modernise the institution such as more speaking time for rapporteurs, increase committee co-operation and other efficiency reforms.|$|E
5|$|Early during Kosygin's tenure, the Brezhnev–Kosygin {{attempt to}} create {{stability}} was failing on various fronts. From 1969 to 1970 discontent within the Soviet leadership had grown {{to such an extent}} that some started to doubt both former and current Soviet policies. Examples include the handling of the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia (which Kosygin initially resisted), the decline in agriculture production, the Sino–Soviet border conflict (he advocated restraint), the Vietnam War, and the Soviet–American <b>talks</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> limitation of strategic missiles. Two summit conferences between the US and the USSR were held: the Warsaw Pact Summit Conference and the Moscow Summit Conference; both failed to gain support for Soviet policies.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1990s, Brazilian and Russian {{authorities}} conducted <b>talks</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> possible {{acquisition of}} the Su-27M. In 2001, the Brazilian government launched the F-X tender, the objective of which was to procure at least twelve aircraft to replace the Brazilian Air Force's ageing aircraft, primarily the Mirage IIIs. Since the Brazilian government was also looking to develop the country's aerospace and defence industries, Sukhoi partnered with the Brazilian defence contractor Avibras during the tender. The two companies submitted the Su-27M to the US$700-million tender, and included an offset agreement wherein the Brazilian industry would participate in the manufacturing of certain aircraft equipment. The tender was suspended in 2003 because of domestic political issues and then scrapped in 2005, pending the availability of new fighters. The Su-27M was preferred over the next favourite, the Mirage 2000BR; had the aircraft been purchased, {{it would have been}} the first heavy fighter delivered to Latin America.|$|E
