25|$|In the {{era when}} long {{distance}} trips took several days, sleeping accommodations were {{an essential part}} of transportation. (On land, the lodging involved was often part of the infrastructure: the inn or ryokan, which did not move, sheltered travellers. People also slept on ships at sea.) Today, most airlines, inter-city trains and coaches offer reclining seats and many provide pillows and blankets for overnight travellers. Better sleeping arrangements are commonly offered for a premium fare and include sleeping cars on overnight trains, larger private cabins on ships and aircraft seats that convert into beds. Budget-conscious tourists sometimes plan their trips using overnight train or bus journeys in lieu of paying for a hotel. The ability to get additional sleep on <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> is attractive to many commuters using public transport.|$|E

2500|$|Sircello distinguishes {{pleasure}} from enjoyment. He uses propositional pleasure {{as an example}} of a particular type of pleasure distinct from enjoyment. [...] Propositional pleasure is characterized as a pleasure taken in the occurrence of a fact, event, state or the like. [...] Such pleasure is relatively passive. [...] We may take pleasure in the outcome of a ball game or in the fact that traffic is light on <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> but the pleasure itself resulting from this satisfaction is something that happens to the subject rather than something they effect. [...] Enjoyment is constituted by the active role played by the subject. [...] Enjoyment can be obtained from experiences that are not entirely pleasant in all their parts via effort or resolve on the part of the subject. [...] For instance, a strenuous hike can be enjoyable even though parts of it may be difficult and painful. [...] The subject’s resolve and ability to overcome difficulties can make the hike enjoyable despite these troubles. [...] Enjoyment involves a complex relationship to desire in that enjoyment tends to fuel further desires for its continuation. [...] As such enjoyment of experience is fundamental in Sircello’s theory of love.|$|E
2500|$|Suddenly, Sisko {{transitions}} entirely {{into his}} vision, becoming Benny Russell, an African-American science fiction writer in 1950s New York City. Russell {{writes for the}} science fiction magazine Incredible Tales, {{and most of the}} people he encounters bear the likeness of people from Sisko's life on the station. On <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> Russell buys the latest edition of Galaxy, their competitor, from a local newsboy (Aron Eisenberg/Nog). He then runs into his coworker Albert Macklin (Colm Meaney/O'Brien), and the two walk to work together. There, short-tempered liberal writer Herbert Rossoff (Armin Shimerman/Quark) argues with magazine editor Douglas Pabst (René Auberjonois/Odo) over donuts, while writers Kay Eaton, a.k.a. K.C. Hunter, (Nana Visitor/Kira) and Julius Eaton (Alexander Siddig/Bashir) banter in the background. The magazine's illustrator Roy Ritterhouse (J. G. Hertzler/Martok) then arrives with a stack of sketches for the next edition. Russell is particularly drawn to a sketch of a space station much like Deep Space 9, and decides to write a story for it. When Pabst announces the next edition will include photos of the staff, he suggests Kay [...] "sleep late" [...] that morning, as the public would not respond well to the revelation she is a woman. Russell realizes he also will not be included, which Pabst confirms. Rossoff objects, but Pabst stands firm, choosing to conform to the prevailing public opinion.|$|E
2500|$|In 1883, Luther Standing Bear {{was sent}} to Philadelphia to work as an intern for John Wanamaker. Wanamaker's was the first {{department}} store in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, {{and one of the}} first department stores in the United States. Luther was told by Pratt: [...] "My boy you are going away from us to work for this school. Go and do your best. The majority of white people think the Indian is a lazy good-for-nothing. They think he can neither work nor learn anything; that he is very dirty. Now you are going to prove that the red man can learn and work as well as the white man. If John Wanamaker gives you he job of blacking his shoes, see that you make them shine. Then he will give you a better job. If you are put into the office to clean, don’t forget to sweep up under the chairs and in the corners. If you do this well, he will give you better work to do." [...] While riding on street cars in Philadelphia, Luther did not care to listen to the vulgar language used by white boys on <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> At the end of his internship, the entire Carlisle school students and faculty traveled to a large meeting hall in Philadelphia where Pratt and Wanamaker spoke. Luther was asked to come to the stage, and Wanamaker told the students that Luther had been promoted from one department to another every month getting better work and better money and in spite of the fact that he employed over one thousand people, he never promoted anyone as rapidly as Luther.|$|E

6000|$|Early in the morning, {{along the}} streets frequented by workmen on <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> many women sit on the {{sidewalk}} with sacks of bread beside them.

[...] Of course, Mr. Verney says [...] "Yes." [...] Then we go on to Mr. Le Breton and say, [...] "A young artist of my acquaintance is making a pilgrimage into the East End to see for himself how the people live, and to make pictures of them to stir up the sluggish consciences of the lazy aristocrats"--that's me and my people, of course: that'll be <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> it. Play upon Mr. Le Breton's tenderest feelings. Make him feel he's fighting for the Cause; and he'll be ready to throw himself, heart and soul, into the spirit of the project. I don't care twopence about the Cause myself, of course, so that's flat, and I don't pretend to, either, Mr. Berkeley; but I care a great deal for the misery of that poor, dear, pale little woman, sitting there with me this morning and regularly sobbing her heart out; and if I can do anything to help her, why, I shall be only too delighted.' ...|$|E
6000|$|LEO BELGICUS.--Perhaps {{you will}} say after this I am a prejudiced critic. I see the {{pictures}} in the cathedral fuming under the rudeness of that beadle, or at the lawful hours and prices, pestered by a swarm of shabby touters, who come behind me chattering in bad English, and who would have me see the sights through their mean, greedy eyes. Better see Rubens any where than in a church. At the Academy, for example, where you may study him at your leisure. But at church?--I would as soon ask Alexandre Dumas for a sermon. Either would paint you a martyrdom very fiercely and picturesquely--writhing muscles, flaming coals, scowling captains and executioners, swarming groups, and light, shade, color most dexterously brilliant or dark; but in Rubens I am admiring the performer rather than the piece. With what astonishing rapidity he travels over his canvas; how tellingly the cool lights and warm shadows are made to contrast and relieve each other; how that blazing, blowsy penitent in yellow satin and glittering hair carries down the stream of light across the picture! This is <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> my boys, and earn a hundred florins a day. See! I am as sure of my line as a skater of making his figure of eight! and down with a sweep goes a brawny arm or a flowing curl of drapery. The figures arrange themselves as if by magic. The paint-pots are exhausted in furnishing brown shadows. The pupils look wondering on, as the master careers over the canvas. Isabel or Helena, wife No. 1 or No. 2, are sitting by, buxom, exuberant, ready to be painted; and the children are boxing in the corner, waiting till they are wanted to figure as cherubs in the picture. Grave burghers and gentlefolks come in on a visit. There are oysters and Rhenish always ready on yonder table. Was there ever such a painter? He has been an ambassador, an actual Excellency, and what better man could be chosen? He speaks all the languages. He earns a hundred florins a day. Prodigious! Thirty-six thousand five hundred florins a year. Enormous! He rides out to his castle with a score of gentlemen after him, like the Governor. That is his own portrait as St. George. You know he is an English knight? Those are his two wives as the two Maries. He chooses the handsomest wives. He rides the handsomest horses. He paints the handsomest pictures. He gets the handsomest prices for them. That slim young Van Dyck, who was his pupil, has genius too, and is painting all the noble ladies in England, and turning the heads of some of them. And Jordaens--what a droll dog and clever fellow! Have you seen his fat Silenus? The master himself could not paint better. And his altar-piece at St. Bavon's? He can paint you anything, that Jordaens can--a drunken jollification of boors and doxies, or a martyr howling with half his skin off. What a knowledge of anatomy! But {{there is nothing like}} the master--nothing. He can paint you his thirty-six thousand five hundred florins' worth a year. Have you heard of what he has done for the French Court? Prodigious! I can't look at Rubens's pictures without fancying I see that handsome figure swaggering before the canvas. And Hans Hemmelinck at Bruges? Have you never seen that dear old hospital of St. John, on passing the gate of which you enter into the fifteenth century? I see the wounded soldier still lingering in the house, and tended by the kind gray sisters. His little panel on its easel is placed at the light. He covers his board with the most wondrous, beautiful little figures, in robes as bright as rubies and amethysts. I think he must have a magic glass, in which he catches the reflection of little cherubs with many-colored wings, very little and bright. Angels, in long crisp robes of white, surrounded with halos of gold, come and flutter across the mirror, and he draws them. He hears mass every day. He fasts through Lent. No monk is more austere and holy than Hans. Which do you love best to behold, the lamb or the lion? the eagle rushing through the storm, and pouncing mayhap on carrion; or the linnet warbling on the spray? ...|$|E
