5|$|Burne-Jones's {{paintings}} were one strand in the evolving <b>tapestry</b> <b>of</b> Aestheticism from the 1860s through the 1880s, which considered that art should be valued {{as an object}} of beauty engendering a sensual response, rather than for the story or moral implicit in the subject matter. In many ways this was antithetical to the ideals of Ruskin and the early Pre-Raphaelites.|$|E
5|$|Paintings {{and other}} {{pictures}} of the Adoration of the Magi may include a depiction of the star in some form. In the fresco by Giotto di Bondone, it is depicted as a comet. In the <b>tapestry</b> <b>of</b> the subject designed by Edward Burne-Jones (and in the related watercolour), the star is held by an angel.|$|E

Penman places the characters against a tightly woven <b>tapestry</b> <b>of</b> medieval life, personal conflict, and dramatic characters.|$|E
5|$|Ilaiyaraaja {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} Indian film composers to use Western classical music harmonies and string arrangements in Indian film music. This allowed him to craft a rich <b>tapestry</b> <b>of</b> sounds for films, and his themes and background score gained notice and appreciation among Indian film audiences. The range of expressive possibilities in Indian film music was broadened by Ilaiyaraaja's methodical approach to arranging, recording technique, and his drawing of ideas from a diversity of musical styles.|$|E
5|$|Between {{the second}} and third Macedonian wars Rome faced further {{conflict}} in the region due to a <b>tapestry</b> <b>of</b> shifting rivalries, alliances and leagues all seeking to gain greater influence. After the Macedonians had been defeated in the Second Macedonian War in 197 BC, the Greek city-state of Sparta stepped into the partial power vacuum in Greece. Fearing the Spartans would take increasing control of the region, the Romans drew on help from allies to prosecute the Roman-Spartan War, defeating a Spartan army at the Battle of Gythium in 195 BC. They also fought their former allies the Aetolian League in the Aetolian War, against the Istrians in the Istrian War, against the Illyrians in the Illyrian War, and against Achaia in the Achaean War.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} 16th century, horse teams were {{beginning}} to replace ox teams in ploughing work in Britain because of their greater speed, strength and agility, particularly on lighter soils; in heavier soils ox teams retained an advantage, both because they pulled more steadily, albeit more slowly, and because they could work despite being fed by grazing alone. While the horse collar, which allows a horse greater freedom to pull heavy loads, {{had been used in}} western Europe by the 10th century, and may be shown in the Bayeux <b>Tapestry</b> <b>of</b> the 11th or 12th century, the use of horse teams in Britain was made possible in part because of an increase in the farming of oats, a staple food for hard-working horses.|$|E

50|$|Antoon Sallaert was a {{prominent}} designer <b>of</b> <b>tapestries.</b> Some <b>of</b> the <b>tapestry</b> series he worked on were The sufferings of Cupid, The life of Man and the Sapientia or the Powers that rule the World, which had a moralising intent. The cartoons for the Cupid series can be dated approximately between 1628 and 1639. The series <b>of</b> seven <b>tapestries</b> <b>of</b> the Life of Man were a reflection on the ages of man and were inspired by Otto van Veen's 1607 Emblemata Horatiana. King Philip II of Spain acquired in 1636 a set <b>of</b> <b>tapestries</b> <b>of</b> the Life of Man and the Life of Theseus after designs by Sallaert.|$|R

25|$|The {{religious}} {{festival of}} Corpus Christi is particularly important, and is traditionally celebrated with floral carpets {{laid in the}} streets. Particularly noteworthy are the celebrations in La Orotava where a very large carpet, or <b>tapestry,</b> <b>of</b> different coloured volcanic soils, covers the Plaza del Ayuntamiento (town square). These soils are taken from the Parque Nacional del Teide, and after the celebration, are returned, to preserve the National Park. The celebration of Corpus Christi in Orotava has been declared of Important Cultural Interest among the official Traditional Activities of the Island.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} her 2005 world cruise, {{some pieces}} of her artwork were damaged when some crew members who had become inebriated at an {{on-board}} crew party, went on a vandalism rampage through the public areas of the ship. A unique <b>tapestry</b> <b>of</b> the QE2, commissioned for the launch of the ship, was thrown overboard by a drunken crewman. An oil painting of Queen Elizabeth II and two other tapestries were damaged, along with a part of the entertainment area and a lifeboat. The crew members involved were dismissed from service, with charges pending.|$|E
25|$|Willy DeVille's Backstreets of Desire stands tall as his {{masterpiece}} as both {{a singer}} and a songwriter. DeVille's considerable reputation in Paris buoyed him up to make this disc... With guest spots by Dr. John, Zachary Richard, and David Hidalgo, DeVille creates a <b>tapestry</b> <b>of</b> roots rock and Crescent City second line, traces of 1950s doo-wop, and elegant sweeping vistas of Spanish soul balladry, combined with lyrics full of busted-down heroes, hungry lovers, and wise men trying {{to get off the}} street. The sound of the album balances Creole soul and pure rock pyrotechnics. DeVille sounds like a man resurrected, digging as deep as the cavernous recesses of the human heart.|$|E

25|$|The album {{benefits}} from lavish investment in production, although this {{puts it in}} a similar position to The Sound's Heads and Hearts album {{in that it is}} much more polished than Borland's other solo material. Critical reception ranged from the noncomittal to welcoming; Allmusic described it as 'one hour of finely woven <b>tapestry,</b> <b>of</b> gorgeous music', albeit 'Not quite as good as 1989's Alexandria, handing it three stars out of five, while David Cavanagh gave it four, praising the atmosphere of 'a strange, dizzy optimism' pervading the album. As one critic argued: ' reflective writing remains as good as ever', and The Big Takeover went further, proclaiming it 'inspired'.|$|E
25|$|Trinidad has a rich <b>tapestry</b> <b>of</b> {{cultures}} which create {{occasions for}} celebrations beyond many's expectations {{for a small}} Caribbean island; thus {{there is much to}} see and do after work hours in Port of Spain, even long after the annual Carnival celebration. While the popularity of the major shopping area around Frederick Street as a nightspot centre has remained steady or declined, expansion of entertainment venues into the malls and outlying towns has occurred. St. James, 'uptown' Port of Spain (St. Clair and Woodbrook) have seen a boom in nightclubs, sports bars and fine dining restaurants as workers from government offices and large corporations disgorge on evenings from high-rise headquarters built in newly commercialized formerly upscale neighbourhoods.|$|E
25|$|This service {{begins with}} the Barechu, the formal public call to prayer, and Shema Yisrael embraced by two benedictions before and two after. Ashkenazim outside of Israel (except Chabad-Lubavitch and {{followers}} of the Vilna Gaon) then add another blessing (Baruch Adonai le-Olam), which is made from a <b>tapestry</b> <b>of</b> biblical verses. (This prayer is also said by Baladi Temanim {{in and out of}} Israel.) This is followed by the Half-Kaddish, and the Shemoneh Esreh (Amidah), bracketed with the full Kaddish. Sephardim then say Psalm 121, say the Mourner's Kaddish, and repeat Barechu before concluding with the Aleinu. Ashkenazim, in the diaspora, do neither say Psalm 121 nor repeat Barechu, but conclude with Aleinu followed by the Mourner's Kaddish (in Israel, Ashkenazim do repeat Barcheu after mourner's Kaddish).|$|E
