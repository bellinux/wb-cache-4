60|$|DEAR SPEED:--We {{have had}} the highest state of {{excitement}} here for a week past that our community has ever witnessed; and, although the public feeling is somewhat allayed, the curious affair which aroused it is very far from being even yet cleared of mystery. It would take a quire of paper to give you anything like a full account of it, and I therefore only propose a brief outline. The chief personages in the drama are Archibald Fisher, supposed to be murdered, and Archibald <b>Trailor,</b> Henry <b>Trailor,</b> and William <b>Trailor,</b> supposed to have murdered him. The three Trailors are brothers: the first, Arch., as you know, lives in town; the second, Henry, in Clary's Grove; and the third, William, in Warren County; and Fisher, the supposed murdered, being without a family, had made his home with William. On Saturday evening, being the 29th of May, Fisher and William came to Henry's in a one-horse dearborn, and there stayed over Sunday; and on Monday all three came to Springfield (Henry on horseback) and joined Archibald at Myers's, the Dutch carpenter. That evening at supper Fisher was missing, and so next morning some ineffectual search was made for him; and on Tuesday, at one o'clock P.M., William and Henry started home without him. In {{a day or two}} Henry and one or two of his Clary-Grove neighbors came back for him again, and advertised his disappearance in the papers. The knowledge of the matter thus far had not been general, and here it dropped entirely, till about the 10th instant, when Keys received a letter from the postmaster in Warren County, that William had arrived at home, and was telling a very mysterious and improbable story about the disappearance of Fisher, which induced the community there to suppose he had been disposed of unfairly. Keys made this letter public, which immediately set the whole town and adjoining county agog. And so it has continued until yesterday. The mass of the people commenced a systematic search for the dead body, while Wickersham was despatched to arrest Henry <b>Trailor</b> at the Grove, and Jim Maxcy to Warren to arrest William. On Monday last, Henry was brought in, and showed an evident inclination to insinuate that he knew Fisher to be dead, and that Arch. and William had killed him. He said he guessed the body could be found in Spring Creek, between the Beardstown road and Hickox's mill. Away the people swept like a herd of buffalo, and cut down Hickox's mill-dam nolens volens, to draw the water out of the pond, and then went up and down and down and up the creek, fishing and raking, and raking and ducking and diving for two days, and, after all, no dead body found.|$|E
60|$|An old {{man from}} Warren, called Dr. Gilmore, was then {{introduced}} {{on the part}} of the defense. He swore that he had known Fisher for several years; that Fisher had resided at his house a long time at each of two different spells--once while he built a barn for him, and once while he was doctored for some chronic disease; that two or three years ago Fisher had a serious hurt in his head by the bursting of a gun, since which he had been subject to continued bad health and occasional aberration of mind. He also stated that on last Tuesday, being the same day that Maxcy arrested William <b>Trailor,</b> he (the doctor) was from home in the early part of the day, and on his return, about eleven o'clock, found Fisher at his house in bed, and apparently very unwell; that he asked him how he came from Springfield; that Fisher said he had come by Peoria, and also told of several other places he had been at more in the direction of Peoria, which showed that he at the time of speaking did not know where he had been wandering about in a state of derangement. He further stated that in about two hours he received a note from one of Trailor's friends, advising him of his arrest, and requesting him to go on to Springfield as a witness, to testify as to the state of Fisher's health in former times; that he immediately set off, calling up two of his neighbors as company, and, riding all evening and all night, overtook Maxcy and William at Lewiston in Fulton County; that Maxcy refusing to discharge <b>Trailor</b> upon his statement, his two neighbors returned and he came on to Springfield. Some question being made as to whether the doctor's story was not a fabrication, several acquaintances of his (among whom was the same postmaster who wrote Keys, as before mentioned) were introduced as sort of compurgators, who swore that they knew the doctor to be of good character for truth and veracity, and generally of good character in every way.|$|E

60|$|In the {{meantime}} {{a sort of}} scuffling-ground {{had been found in}} the brush in the angle, or point, where the road leading into the woods past the brewery and the one leading in past the brick-yard meet. From the scuffle-ground was the sign of something {{about the size of a}} man having been dragged to the edge of the thicket, where it joined the track of some small-wheeled carriage drawn by one horse, as shown by the road-tracks. The carriage-track led off toward Spring Creek. Near this drag-trail Dr. Merryman found two hairs, which, after a long scientific examination, he pronounced to be triangular human hairs, which term, he says, includes within it the whiskers, the hair growing under the arms and on other parts of the body; and he judged that these two were of the whiskers, because the ends were cut, showing that they had flourished in the neighborhood of the razor's operations. On Thursday last Jim Maxcy brought in William <b>Trailor</b> from Warren. On the same day Arch. was arrested and put in jail. Yesterday (Friday) William was put upon his examining trial before May and Lovely. Archibald and Henry were both present. Lamborn prosecuted, and Logan, Baker, and your humble servant defended. A great many witnesses were introduced and examined, but I shall only mention those whose testimony seemed most important. The first of these was Captain Ransdell. He swore that when William and Henry left Springfield for home on Tuesday before mentioned they did not take the direct route,--which, you know, leads by the butcher shop,--but that they followed the street north until they got opposite, or nearly opposite, May's new house, after which he could not see them from where he stood; and it was afterwards proved that in about an hour after they started, they came into the street by the butcher shop from toward the brickyard. Dr. Merryman and others swore to what is stated about the scuffle-ground, drag-trail, whiskers, and carriage tracks. Henry was then introduced by the prosecution. He swore that when they started for home they went out north, as Ransdell stated, and turned down west by the brick-yard into the woods, and there met Archibald; that they proceeded a small distance farther, when he was placed as a sentinel to watch for and announce the approach of any one that might happen that way; that William and Arch. took the dearborn out of the road a small distance to the edge of the thicket, where they stopped, and he saw them lift the body of a man into it; that they then moved off with the carriage in the direction of Hickox's mill, and he loitered about for something like an hour, when William returned with the carriage, but without Arch., and said they had put him in a safe place; that they went somehow he did not know exactly how--into the road close to the brewery, and proceeded on to Clary's Grove. He also stated that some time during the day William told him that he and Arch. had killed Fisher the evening before; that the way they did it was by him William knocking him down with a club, and Arch. then choking him to death.|$|E

6000|$|Here the {{testimony}} ended, and the <b>Trailors</b> were discharged, Arch. and William expressing both in word and manner their entire confidence that Fisher {{would be found}} alive at the doctor's by Galloway, Mallory, and Myers, who a day before had been despatched for that purpose; which Henry still protested that no power on earth could ever show Fisher alive. Thus stands this curious affair. When the doctor's story was first made public, it was amusing to scan and contemplate the countenances and hear the remarks {{of those who had}} been actively in search for the dead body: some looked quizzical, some melancholy, and some furiously angry. Porter, who had been very active, swore he always knew the man was not dead, and that he had not stirred an inch to hunt for him; Langford, who had taken the lead in cutting down Hickox's mill-dam, and wanted to hang Hickox for objecting, looked most awfully woebegone: he seemed the [...] "victim of unrequited affection," [...] as represented in the comic almanacs we used to laugh over; and Hart, the little drayman that hauled Molly home once, said it was too damned bad to have so much trouble, and no hanging after all.|$|R

40|$|The Space Physics Research Laboratory at the University of Michigan {{has been}} {{operating}} a direct detection, high resolution Doppler Lidar (HRDL) to measure winds in the boundary layer, free troposphere and lower stratosphere. A direct detection Doppler lidar measures the Doppler shift of the aerosol or Rayleigh backscattered signal, from which the wind velocity vector can be retrieved (Benedetti-Michelangeli et al, 1972, 1974; Chanin et al., 1989; Abreu et al., 1992). The system components are shown. The transmitting system is a Continuum NY- 60 Nd:YAG laser frequency doubled to a wavelength of 532 nm. The laser is injection seeded for single line mode operation yielding a linewidth of 0. 0045 cm(exp - 1) (135 MHz) with excellent shot-to-shot frequency stability. The laser produces 60 mJ pulses and operates at a 50 Hz repetition rate for an effective output power of 3. 0 W. A description of the University of Michigan's Doppler lidar is given with examples of wind profiles for the boundary layer, free troposphere, and for the lower stratosphere. The system provides a reliable method of remotely measuring the wind. The wind error is smallest in regions of high aerosols. The system also produces aerosol extinction profiles versus altitude which can {{be determined by the}} shape of the spectra. The system has been installed in a <b>trailor</b> so that measurements can be made for field campaigns. Winds and aerosol data are available immediately at the site for use in forecasting...|$|E
40|$|Cells are {{composed}} of several RNAs such as messenger RNA (mRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA), small nuclear and small nucleolar RNAs (sn and snoRNAs) and ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) that perform various cellular activities such as protein synthesis. tRNA serves as an adaptor in protein synthesis as it transfers a specific amino acid {{to the site of}} protein synthesis. A newly synthesized tRNA consists of a 52 ̆ 7 leader and 32 ̆ 7 <b>trailor</b> which are removed to generate mature tRNA. During biogenesis, aberrant tRNAs might be produced due to processing errors and if not degraded they might get incorporated in to the protein synthesis machinery forming abnormal proteins. Thus degradation mechanisms for RNAs have evolved to ensure normal functioning of cells. One of the striking features of a tRNA molecule is the presence of numerous post transcriptional modifications one of which is Methylation of adenosine at position 58 of tRNA catalyzed by the enzyme complex Trm 6 p/Trm 61 p in yeast, Saccharomyces cereviseae. In TRM 6 and TRM 61 mutants, tRNAs lack m 1 A modification and this results in the degradation of a unique tRNA, Initiator tRNAMet (tRNA iMet). I have characterized the molecular details of this novel degradation pathway of hypomethylated tRNAiMet. Genetic suppressor analysis of a trm 6 - 504 mutant showed that RRP 44, a subunit of a multiprotein RNA processing and degradation complex, the exosome and TRF 4, a member of polβ nucleotidyl transferase family of proteins are required for the degradation of hypomethylated tRNAiMet which occurs in the nucleus. The in vivo substrate for polyadenylation and degradation is the precursor form of hypomethylated tRNAi Met which possesses the unprocessed 52 ̆ 7 and 32 ̆ 7 extensions, demonstrating that the integrity of tRNA is tested early during its biogenesis. Interestingly, Trf 5 p, homolog of Trf 4 p is required for efficient degradation of tRNA iMet. Nuclear tRNA surveillance is a global mechanism to degrade aberrant RNAs as mutant U 6 SnRNA and 5 S rRNA are polyadenylated and degraded by Trf 4 p and the exosome similar to hypomethylated tRNA iMet. This study has initiated a new area of study, RNA surveillance that involves polyadenylation by Trf 4 p and degradation by the exosome...|$|E
