5|$|It was {{not until}} after 9,500 BC that the eight {{so-called}} founder crops of agriculture appear: first emmer and einkorn wheat, then hulled barley, peas, lentils, bitter vetch, chick peas and flax. <b>These</b> <b>eight</b> crops occur more or less simultaneously on Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB) sites in the Levant, although wheat {{was the first to}} be grown and harvested on a significant scale. At around the same time (9400 BC), parthenocarpic fig trees were domesticated.|$|E
5|$|The 1928 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season featured the Okeechobee hurricane, which was second deadliest tropical cyclone {{in the history}} of the United States. Only eight tropical cyclones developed during the season. Of <b>these</b> <b>eight</b> tropical systems, seven of them intensified into a tropical storm and four further strengthened into hurricanes. One hurricane deepened into a major hurricane, which is Category3 or higher on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. The first system, the Fort Pierce hurricane, developed near the Lesser Antilles on August3. The storm crossed the Bahamas and made landfall in Florida. Two fatalities and approximately $235,000 in damage was reported. A few days after the first storm developed, the Haiti hurricane, formed near the southern Windward Islands on August7. The storm went on to strike Haiti, Cuba, and Florida. This storm left about $2million in damage and at least 210deaths. Impacts from the third system are unknown.|$|E

5|$|The 1997 Pacific {{hurricane}} season was fairly active, {{due to the}} strong El Niño that was occurring at the time. El Niño causes wind shear to be reduced and water temperatures to increase, resulting in conditions more conductive for tropical cyclones in the East Pacific. There were 24 cyclones in total, including five unnamed tropical depressions. Of these, 19 were in the east Pacific (east of 140°W). Of <b>these,</b> <b>eight</b> peaked at tropical storm intensity, while ten reached hurricane status. Seven of these reached Category3 intensity or higher on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale, including central Pacific cyclones Super Typhoons Oliwa and Paka, which became typhoons after crossing into the western Pacific. The first hurricane {{of the year was}} Hurricane Dolores, and the first major hurricane was Hurricane Enrique. Most months during the year had several storms, but no records were set for storms in any particular month.|$|E
5|$|The city {{opened up}} bidding for the {{construction}} of the network in 2005, eventually receiving bids from eight different internet service providers. Of <b>these</b> <b>eight,</b> Atlanta-based EarthLink and Minnetonka-based US Internet were selected as semifinalists, and each company set up a trial program in Minneapolis before the final decision was made. During this process, outcry arose from both members of the Institute for Local Self Reliance about the lack of public hearings {{on the subject of the}} network, and from Qwest, another internet service provider who had placed a bid to build and run the network, about the city's plan to be involved in the wireless internet business at all. The deputy chief information officer of Minneapolis, Bill Beck, stated that the city was worried about legal restrictions and lawsuits, which were key reasons for the lack of transparency in the process.|$|E
5|$|There are {{currently}} eight business routes of Interstate 94 (I-94) in the US state of Michigan. These business routes connect I-94 to the downtown business districts of neighboring cities. <b>These</b> <b>eight</b> routes are all business loops which bear the Business Loop I-94 (BL I-94) designation. These loops are former routings of I-94's two predecessors in Michigan: US Highway12 (US12) or US25. The westernmost BL I-94 {{runs through the}} twin cities of Benton Harbor and St. Joseph along the former routing of US12 and US31/US33 that now includes {{a section of the}} Lake Michigan Circle Tour in the state. The loops in Kalamazoo, Battle Creek, Marshall, Albion, and Jackson were also formerly segments of US12 which were later designated as separate version of Business US Highway12 (Bus. US12) through their respective cities before becoming BL I-94s in 1960. The route of the business loop through Ann Arbor was previously US12 and then later M-14 before receiving its current moniker. The BL I-94 through Port Huron was previously US25 and then Business US Highway 25 (Bus. US25).|$|E

Haneda saw less than 2,400 business jet operations in 2013 and 2014; the operator of its sole business jet hangar, Wings of Life, became engulfed in scandal in 2015 after allegedly bribing a Japan Civil Aviation Bureau official to overlook its non-payment of rent.|$|R
5|$|Today, eight stallions are {{recognized}} as the foundation bloodstock of the breed, all foaled the late 18th and early 19th centuries. All modern Lipizzans trace their bloodlines to <b>these</b> <b>eight</b> stallions, and all breeding stallions have included in their name {{the name of the}} foundation sire of their bloodline. There are also classic mare lines, with up to 35 recognized by various breed registries. The majority of horses are registered through the member organizations of the Lipizzan International Federation, which covers almost 11,000 horses in 19 countries and at 9 state studs in Europe. The majority of Lipizzans reside in Europe, with smaller numbers in the Americas, Africa and Australia. Generally gray in color, the Lipizzan is a muscular breed that matures slowly and is long-lived.|$|E
5|$|In the club's {{early history}} the {{appearance}} record {{was held by}} goalkeeper Arthur Cartlidge, who played in 258 Southern League games between 1901 and 1909. His record stood until it was broken by another goalkeeper, Jesse Whatley, who played 14 times in the Southern League and a further 372 in The Football League, making a total of 386 overall. Following the Second World War the Bristol Rovers board introduced a no-buy/no-sell policy, which remained in force until {{the abolition of the}} maximum wage in football in 1961; as a result some players in that era had a high number of appearances for the club. Eight of the top nine most-used players played during this time, each making over 400 appearances. <b>These</b> <b>eight</b> were Bobby Jones (421 appearances), Alfie Biggs (424), Ray Warren (450), Harold Jarman (452), George Petherbridge (457), Geoff Bradford (462), Jack Pitt (466), and Harry Bamford (486). The club's all-time leading appearance maker, Stuart Taylor, played in 546 League games between 1965 and 1980. The club's highest scorer by a wide margin is Geoff Bradford, who scored 242 times in The Football League, exceeding the next-highest scorer Alfie Biggs by 64 goals.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} Mega Man {{series on}} the NES has generally consisted of 2D platform games that focus on run-and-gun gameplay. Mega Man X uses the same basic principles as its precursors but with many added options. The player takes control of the protagonist X, and, after completing an introductory stage, is presented with a stage selection screen that depicts eight boss characters. Each stage is littered with various enemies and hazards and ends with a boss battle against its respective Maverick. Completing a stage rewards the player with a new weapon. The player may attempt <b>these</b> <b>eight</b> levels in any order, using weapons gained in one level to overcome challenges in the others. The player can return to the game at a later point using a password system; the password will retain any number of the eight stages cleared and most power-ups. Completing some stages will subtly affect the landscape of others. For example, clearing Storm Eagle's aircraft carrier stage will cause electrical outages in Spark Mandrill's power plant stage. In certain stages, X can hop inside Ride Armors to fight enemies. Ride Armors are bipedal tanks capable of powerful punches.|$|E
