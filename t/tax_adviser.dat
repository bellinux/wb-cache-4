50|$|The Chamber is an {{independent}} professional organization of <b>tax</b> <b>advisers.</b> Its existence is given by the Tax Advisory Services and the Chamber of <b>Tax</b> <b>Advisers</b> of the Czech Republic Act no. 523/1992 Coll., which came into effect on 1 December 1992. This act regulates both the position and activities of <b>tax</b> <b>advisers</b> and {{the activity of the}} Chamber itself. The Tax Advisory Services Act guarantees demanded professional standards of the profession, regulates the position of the Chamber of <b>Tax</b> <b>Advisers,</b> rights and duties of <b>tax</b> <b>advisers</b> and defines <b>tax</b> advisory services themselves as provision of legal help and financial-economic advice concerning taxes, tax payments, duties and other payments as well as concerning things associated directly with taxes.Pursuant to this act, only those individuals who are listed on the list of the Chamber of <b>Tax</b> <b>Advisers</b> of the Czech Republic can be considered as <b>tax</b> <b>advisers.</b> <b>Tax</b> <b>advisers</b> are compulsory members of the Chamber by law.|$|R

40|$|This report {{investigates the}} role of <b>tax</b> <b>advisers</b> in large {{business}} tax compliance. The report compares the tax advisory industries in four EU Member States, the United Kingdom (UK), the Republic of Ireland (Ireland), the Netherlands and Germany. The {{focus is on the}} professional background of <b>tax</b> <b>advisers</b> and the regulatory frameworks in which advisers operate. In the UK, Ireland and the Netherlands, tax advice is provided by different types of professionals – exclusive <b>tax</b> <b>advisers,</b> lawyers, accountants and others. The German system stands out as all tax related work is reserved to a strongly protected tax advisory profession. Due to high entrance criteria to the profession, as well as strict professional duties, German <b>tax</b> <b>advisers</b> enjoy a strong reputation. The non-protected status of the British, Irish and Dutch tax professions has resulted in a more dynamic and client oriented approach of <b>tax</b> <b>advisers.</b> In addition, the number of exclusive <b>tax</b> <b>advisers</b> the UK, Ireland, and the Netherlands is smaller than in Germany, and, in contrast to the German situation, {{it is not so much}} tax advisory work that leads to access to non-tax work, but non-tax work leading to tax advisory assignments. <b>Tax</b> <b>advisers</b> in Europe are subject to  highly  different  regulatory  frameworks.  Two  main types of regulation can be distinguished. First, there are rules aimed at the tax profession directly, which are mostly documented in laws, codes, standards, or a combination thereof. Direct regulations are most strongly developed in Germany, and, with the exception of anti- terrorism financing regulations, virtually absent in the British, Irish and Dutch tax systems. Second, the regulatory framework provides indirect forms of regulation by setting out how services provided by <b>tax</b> <b>advisers</b> should be organised. These regulations are scarce in the German system, but prevalent in the British, Irish and Dutch tax systems. Hence, the report demonstrates that a low degree of regulation of the tax advisory profession goes together with a high degree of regulation and supervision of the work in which <b>tax</b> <b>advisers</b>  are involved. The role of <b>tax</b> <b>advisers</b> in the British, German, and Dutch tax system has been eroded in recent years. The position of <b>tax</b> <b>advisers</b> has been affected most strongly in the Netherlands with the introduction of horizontal monitoring. A main conclusion of the report is that in order to adequately identify the  relationship between <b>tax</b> <b>advisers</b> and taxpayers’ compliance, a multidimensional analysis is required of the advisory profession within the wider regulatory landscape, not limited to regulations that directly apply to the tax profession but comprise all regulations that affect tax advisory work. What initially appear to be very heterogeneous European regulatory frameworks for <b>tax</b> <b>advisers,</b> are in practice systems that are much more convergent in terms of the regulatory output they produce regarding tax advisory work.
