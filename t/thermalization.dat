25|$|Light-water-moderated {{reactors}} (LWRs). Light-water reactors (the {{most common}} type of thermal reactor) use ordinary water to moderate and cool the reactors. When at operating temperature, if the temperature of the water increases, its density drops, and fewer neutrons passing through it are slowed enough to trigger further reactions. That negative feedback stabilizes the reaction rate. Graphite and heavy-water reactors tend to be more thoroughly thermalized than light water reactors. Due to the extra <b>thermalization,</b> these types can use natural uranium/unenriched fuel.|$|E
25|$|By contrast, Bussard {{argued that}} the plasma had a {{different}} structure, temperature distribution and well profile. These characteristics have not been fully measured and {{are central to the}} device's feasibility. Bussard's calculations indicated that the bremsstrahlung losses would be much smaller. According to Bussard the high speed and therefore low cross section for Coulomb collisions of the ions in the core makes thermalizing collisions very unlikely, while the low speed at the rim means that <b>thermalization</b> there has almost no impact on ion velocity in the core. Bussard calculated that a polywell reactor with a radius of 1.5 meters would produce net power fusing deuterium.|$|E
500|$|Pure {{silicon carbide}} {{can be made}} by the {{so-called}} Lely process, in which SiC powder is sublimated into high-temperature species of silicon, carbon, silicon dicarbide (SiC2), and [...] disilicon carbide (Si2C) in an argon gas ambient at 2500°C and redeposited into flake-like single crystals, sized up to 2×2cm, at a slightly colder substrate. This process yields high-quality single crystals, mostly of 6H-SiC phase (because of high growth temperature). A modified Lely process involving induction heating in graphite crucibles yields even larger single crystals of 4inches (10cm) in diameter, having a section 81 times larger compared to the conventional Lely process. Cubic SiC is usually grown by the more expensive process of chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Homoepitaxial and heteroepitaxial SiC layers can be grown employing both gas and liquid phase approaches. Pure silicon carbide can also be prepared by the thermal decomposition of a polymer, poly(methylsilyne), under an inert atmosphere at low temperatures. Relative to the CVD process, the pyrolysis method is advantageous because the polymer can be formed into various shapes prior to <b>thermalization</b> into the ceramic.|$|E

2500|$|At {{any given}} time the {{radiation}} in the cavity {{may not be in}} thermal equilibrium, but the second law of thermodynamics states that if left undisturbed it will eventually reach equilibrium, although {{the time it takes to}} do so may be very long. Typically, equilibrium is reached by continual absorption and emission of radiation by material in the cavity or its walls. Radiation entering the cavity will be [...] "thermalized"; by this mechanism: the energy will be redistributed until the ensemble of photons achieves a Planck distribution. The time taken for <b>thermalization</b> is much faster with condensed matter present than with rarefied matter such as a dilute gas. [...] At temperatures below billions of Kelvin, direct photon–photon interactions are usually negligible compared to interactions with matter. Photons are an example of an interacting boson gas, and as described by the H-theorem, under very general conditions any interacting boson gas will approach thermal equilibrium.|$|E

5000|$|In {{order to}} work, and {{as pointed out}} by Roger Penrose from 1986 on, {{inflation}} requires extremely specific initial conditions of its own, so that the problem (or pseudo-problem) of initial conditions is not solved: [...] "There is something fundamentally misconceived about trying to explain the uniformity of the early universe as resulting from a <b>thermalization</b> process. ... For, if the <b>thermalization</b> is actually doing anything ... then it represents a definite increasing of the entropy. Thus, the universe {{would have been even}} more special before the <b>thermalization</b> than after." [...] The problem of specific or [...] "fine-tuned" [...] initial conditions would not have been solved; it would have gotten worse.

5000|$|This {{work was}} partly {{motivated}} by the near-recurrence paradox that had been observed in a very early computer simulation [...] of a nonlinear lattice by Enrico Fermi, John Pasta, and Stanislaw Ulam, at Los Alamos in 1955. Those authors had observed long-time nearly recurrent behavior of a one-dimensional chain of anharmonic oscillators, {{in contrast to the}} rapid <b>thermalization</b> that had been expected. Kruskal and Zabusky simulated the KdV equation, which Kruskal had obtained as a continuum limit of that one-dimensional chain, and found solitonic behavior, which is the opposite of <b>thermalization.</b> That {{turned out to be the}} heart of the phenomenon.|$|E

5000|$|The Eigenstate <b>Thermalization</b> Hypothesis (or ETH) {{is a set}} {{of ideas}} which purports to explain when and why an {{isolated}} quantum mechanical system can be accurately described using equilibrium statistical mechanics. In particular, it is devoted to understanding how systems which are initially prepared in far-from-equilibrium states can evolve in time to a state which appears to be in thermal equilibrium. The phrase [...] "eigenstate thermalization" [...] was first coined by Mark Srednicki in 1994, after similar ideas had been introduced by Josh Deutsch in 1991. The principal philosophy underlying the eigenstate <b>thermalization</b> hypothesis is that instead of explaining the ergodicity of a thermodynamic system through the mechanism of dynamical chaos, as is done in classical mechanics, one should instead examine the properties of matrix elements of observable quantities in individual energy eigenstates of the system.|$|E

5000|$|Currently, {{there is}} no known {{analytical}} derivation of the Eigenstate <b>Thermalization</b> Hypothesis for general interacting systems. However, it has been verified to be true {{for a wide variety}} of interacting systems using numerical exact diagonalization techniques, to within the uncertainty of these methods. It has also been proven to be true in certain special cases in the semi-classical limit, where the validity of the ETH rests on the validity of Shnirelman's theorem, which states that in a system which is classically chaotic, the expectation value of an operator [...] in an energy eigenstate is equal to its classical, microcanonical average at the appropriate energy. Whether or not it can be shown to be true more generally in interacting quantum systems remains an open question. It is also known to explicitly fail in certain integrable systems, in which the presence of a large number of constants of motion prevent <b>thermalization.</b>|$|E

5000|$|This {{constancy}} of {{the values}} of [...] over small energy windows is the primary idea underlying the Eigenstate <b>Thermalization</b> Hypothesis.

This constitutes a foundation for quantum statistical mechanics which is radically different from the one built upon the notions of dynamical ergodicity.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{problem that}} Rider has raised is the <b>thermalization</b> of ions. Rider argued that, in a quasineutral plasma {{where all the}} positives and negatives are {{distributed}} equally, the ions will interact. As they do, they exchange energy, causing their energy to spread out (in a Wiener process) heading to a bell curve (or Gaussian function) of energy. Rider focused his arguments within the ion population and did not address electron-to-ion energy exchange or non-thermal plasmas.|$|E
5000|$|The {{limitations}} of photovoltaic cells create issues {{not only with}} the PCE but creates issues with cost and feasibility of manufacturing this type of solar technology to the industrial scale. These limitations include: 1) the incomplete absorption of the entire light spectrum, 2) <b>thermalization</b> of hot carriers in the form of excess heat, 3) chemical potential (thermodynamic) losses, and 4) radiative recombination. [...] Reducing the effects of these limitations allows for a better PCE and lower cost.|$|E

Serpentine can also be added as aggregate to special concrete used in nuclear reactor shielding to increase the concrete density (2.6 g/cm3) and its neutron capture cross section.|$|E
50|$|The {{magnetosheath}} is {{the region}} of the magnetosphere between the bow shock and the magnetopause. It is formed mainly from shocked solar wind, though it contains a small amount of plasma from the magnetosphere. It is an area exhibiting high particle energy flux, where the direction and magnitude of the magnetic field varies erratically. This is caused by the collection of solar wind gas that has effectively undergone <b>thermalization.</b> It acts as a cushion that transmits the pressure from the flow of the solar wind and the barrier of the magnetic field from the object.|$|E
50|$|Typically positrons will thermalize, slow down, {{very quickly}} in a material. This {{means that they}} barely {{penetrate}} the surface of most materials. After <b>thermalization,</b> the positron will diffuse around the material, interacting with any defects, electromagnetic distortions or potential wells, they encounter. This {{may result in a}} change of the positron's state, collapsing its wave function and reducing the instantaneous chance of electron-positron annihilation.

Maximum efficiency presumes no entropy change, which is only possible if the emitter and cell are at the same temperature. More accurate models are quite complicated.|$|E
