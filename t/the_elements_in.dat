5|$|Around 1865 John Newlands {{produced}} {{a series of}} papers where he listed <b>the</b> <b>elements</b> <b>in</b> order of increasing atomic weight and similar {{physical and chemical properties}} that recurred at intervals of eight; he likened such periodicity to the octaves of music, where notes an octave apart have similar musical functions. His version put all the alkali metals then known (lithium to caesium), as well as copper, silver, and thallium (which show the +1 oxidation state characteristic of the alkali metals), together into a group. His table placed hydrogen with the halogens.|$|E

5|$|As {{tetravalent}} transition metals, {{all three}} elements form various inorganic compounds, generally in the oxidation state of +4. For {{the first three}} metals, {{it has been shown}} that they are resistant to concentrated alkalis, but halogens react with them to form tetrahalides. At higher temperatures, all three metals react with oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, boron, sulfur, and silicon. Because of the lanthanide contraction of <b>the</b> <b>elements</b> <b>in</b> the fifth period, zirconium and hafnium have nearly identical ionic radii.

5|$|Russian {{chemistry}} professor Dmitri Mendeleev and German chemist Julius Lothar Meyer independently published their periodic {{tables in}} 1869 and 1870, respectively. Mendeleev's table {{was his first}} published version; that of Meyer was an expanded version of his (Meyer's) table of 1864. They both constructed their tables by listing <b>the</b> <b>elements</b> <b>in</b> rows or columns in order of atomic weight and starting a new row or column when {{the characteristics of the}} elements began to repeat.|$|E
5|$|The Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev {{published}} the first widely recognized periodic table in 1869. He developed his table to illustrate periodic {{trends in the}} properties of the then-known elements. Mendeleev also predicted some properties of then-unknown elements that would be expected to fill gaps in this table. Most of his predictions were proved correct when <b>the</b> <b>elements</b> <b>in</b> question were subsequently discovered. Mendeleev's periodic table has since been expanded and refined with the discovery or synthesis of further new elements and the development of new theoretical models to explain chemical behaviour.|$|E

5|$|Because it seldom {{appears in}} high concentration, {{germanium}} was discovered comparatively {{late in the}} history of chemistry. Germanium ranks near fiftieth in relative abundance of <b>the</b> <b>elements</b> <b>in</b> the Earth's crust. In 1869, Dmitri Mendeleev predicted its existence and some of its properties from its position on his periodic table, and called the element ekasilicon. Nearly two decades later, in 1886, Clemens Winkler found the new element along with silver and sulfur, in a rare mineral called argyrodite. Although the new element somewhat resembled arsenic and antimony in appearance, the combining ratios in compounds agreed with Mendeleev's predictions for a relative of silicon. Winkler named the element after his country, Germany. Today, germanium is mined primarily from sphalerite (the primary ore of zinc), though germanium is also recovered commercially from silver, lead, and copper ores.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) and the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP) {{formed a}} Joint Working Party (JWP) aimed at {{assessing}} discoveries and establishing final names for <b>the</b> <b>elements</b> <b>in</b> question. The party held numerous meetings with delegates {{from the three}} competing institutes; in 1990, they established criteria on recognizing an element and in 1991, they completed the work on assessing discoverer statuses and the party was disbanded. These results were published in 1993. According to the report, the first definitely successful experiment was the April 1970 experiment in Berkeley, followed closely by the June 1970 Dubna experiment; thus, credit for discovery of the element should be shared between the two competing teams.|$|E
5|$|In the {{standard}} periodic table, the elements {{are listed in}} order of increasing atomic number Z (the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom). A new row (period) is started when a new electron shell has its first electron. Columns (groups) {{are determined by the}} electron configuration of the atom; elements with the same number of electrons in a particular subshell fall into the same columns (e.g. oxygen and selenium are in the same column because they both have four electrons in the outermost p-subshell). Elements with similar chemical properties generally fall into the same group in the periodic table, although in the f-block, and to some respect in the d-block, <b>the</b> <b>elements</b> <b>in</b> the same period tend to have similar properties, as well. Thus, it is relatively easy to predict the chemical properties of an element if one knows the properties of the elements around it.|$|E

The ship had three full gundecks with guns from bow to stern. Altogether there were seven separate levels, divided by six decks. Furthest down in the ship, above the keel, was the hold, and immediately above it, but still below the waterline, lay the orlop; both were used primarily for storage. Above the orlop were the three gundecks, two of them covered, while about half of the topmost gundeck was open to <b>the</b> <b>elements</b> <b>in</b> the ship's middle, or waist. The bow had one deck, making up the forecastle, and the stern had two decks, including a poop deck.|$|E
5|$|Placing the {{elements}} into categories and subcategories based on shared properties is imperfect. There is {{a spectrum of}} properties within each category {{and it is not}} hard to find overlaps at the boundaries, as is the case with most classification schemes. Beryllium, for example, is classified as an alkaline earth metal although its amphoteric chemistry and tendency to mostly form covalent compounds are both attributes of a chemically weak or post-transition metal. Radon is classified as a nonmetal and a noble gas yet has some cationic chemistry that is more characteristic of a metal. Other classification schemes are possible such as the division of {{the elements}} into mineralogical occurrence categories, or crystalline structures. Categorizing <b>the</b> <b>elements</b> <b>in</b> this fashion dates back to at least 1869 when Hinrichs wrote that simple boundary lines could be drawn on the periodic table to show elements having like properties, such as the metals and the nonmetals, or the gaseous elements.|$|E

5|$|Silver also forms alloys {{with most}} other {{elements}} on the periodic table.

By far the most important such alloys are those with copper: most silver used for coinage and jewellery is in reality a silver–copper alloy, and the eutectic mixture is used in vacuum brazing. The two metals are completely miscible as liquids but not as solids; their importance in industry {{comes from the fact}} that their properties tend to be suitable over a wide range of variation in silver and copper concentration, although most useful alloys tend to be richer in silver than the eutectic mixture (71.9% silver and 28.1% copper by weight, and 60.1% silver and 28.1% copper by atom).|$|E
5|$|The {{alkali metals}} are {{more similar to}} each other than <b>the</b> <b>elements</b> <b>in</b> any other group are to each other. Indeed, the {{similarity}} {{is so great that}} it is quite difficult to separate potassium, rubidium, and caesium, due to their similar ionic radii; lithium and sodium are more distinct. For instance, when moving down the table, all known alkali metals show increasing atomic radius, decreasing electronegativity, increasing reactivity, and decreasing melting and boiling points as well as heats of fusion and vaporisation. In general, their densities increase when moving down the table, with the exception that potassium is less dense than sodium. One of the very few properties of the alkali metals that does not display a very smooth trend is their reduction potentials: lithium's value is anomalous, being more negative than the others. This is because the Li+ ion has a very high hydration energy in the gas phase: though the lithium ion disrupts the structure of water significantly, causing a higher change in entropy, this high hydration energy is enough to make the reduction potentials indicate it as being the most electropositive alkali metal, despite the difficulty of ionising it in the gas phase.|$|E
5|$|The {{intermetallic}} compounds of the alkali metals with the heavier group 13 elements (aluminium, gallium, indium, and thallium), such as NaTl, are poor conductors or semiconductors, unlike the normal alloys with the preceding elements, {{implying that the}} alkali metal involved has lost an electron to the Zintl anions involved. Nevertheless, while <b>the</b> <b>elements</b> <b>in</b> group 14 and beyond tend to form discrete anionic clusters, group 13 elements tend to form polymeric ions with the alkali metal cations located between the giant ionic lattice. For example, NaTl consists of a polymeric anion (—Tl−—)n with a covalent diamond cubic structure with Na+ ions located between the anionic lattice. The larger alkali metals cannot fit similarly into an anionic lattice and tend to force the heavier group 13 elements to form anionic clusters.|$|E
