It was generally assumed that Nichols would become the AEC's Director of Military Application, but while Nichol's relationship with <b>the</b> <b>AEC</b> was cordial and the commissioners were impressed with his administrative skills, it also became clear that Nichols did not agree with the commissioners' concept of the Director of Military Application as a staff rather than a line function.|$|E

5|$|At this point, McCormack {{had become}} {{apprehensive}} about his career, but in early 1947 {{a new and}} exciting opportunity opened up. The Atomic Energy Act of 1946 had created the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) to oversee {{research and development of}} nuclear power and nuclear weapons. The Act had created a statutory position inside <b>the</b> <b>AEC</b> called the Director of Military Applications, which <b>the</b> <b>AEC</b> commissioners envisaged as a staff post responsible for military planning and policy formulation. By law, the Director of Military Applications had to be a serving armed forces officer.|$|E

5|$|The frontrunner for {{the post}} was the wartime {{commander}} of the Manhattan District, Brigadier General Kenneth Nichols. Indeed, Nichols was the War Department's only nominee. However, <b>the</b> <b>AEC</b> commissioners had different ideas. Nichols was seen as too closely identified with the wartime Manhattan Project; he had opinions at variance with the commissioners on whether the Director of Military Applications was a staff or a line position; {{and he had a}} strong disagreement with the commissioners over the vexing issue of which agency should hold custody of the nuclear weapons stockpile. Accordingly, <b>the</b> <b>AEC</b> commissioners decided to find another candidate.|$|E

Due to <b>the</b> <b>AEC's</b> practice of giving preference to the names of the so-called 'Federation divisions'—those contested at the first federal election in 1901—Charlton was to have been renamed Hunter.|$|R
5|$|The {{hearing was}} held at a {{temporary}} building near the Washington Monument housing offices of <b>the</b> <b>AEC.</b> It began on April 12, 1954, and lasted four weeks. <b>The</b> <b>AEC</b> was represented by Roger Robb, an experienced prosecutor in Washington, and Arthur Rolander, while Oppenheimer's legal team was headed by Lloyd K.

5|$|During the 1960s {{and early}} 1970s, the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) {{executed}} {{a number of}} nuclear tests {{on the island of}} Amchitka in the face of vehement opposition from environmental and local indigenous groups. The first test, conducted in 1965, caused significant damage to the surrounding area, although the details of this damage were not released to the public until 1969. In 1969, <b>the</b> <b>AEC</b> executed a 'calibration shot' to determine whether Amchitka would be suitable for future tests. In 1970, <b>the</b> <b>AEC</b> announced plans to detonate a bomb named 'Cannikin', set to release a blast 385 times that released by the dropping of an atomic bomb on Hiroshima in 1945. After a United States Supreme Court challenge to the testing failed by one vote, the testing proceeded as scheduled in November 1971.|$|E
5|$|During the 1960s, the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) {{conducted}} {{nuclear tests}} on Amchitka. Despite being {{designated as a}} national wildlife refuge by President William Taft in 1913, Amchitka was chosen as a nuclear testing site by <b>the</b> <b>AEC.</b> There were several reasons for this decision. Firstly, Amchitka {{was close to the}} former Soviet Union, making it an ideal location for a nuclear test to intimidate the latter. However, the public reason given by <b>the</b> <b>AEC</b> was the island's remoteness. Forceful objections were raised against the testing by a number of organisations and groups, most notably the Aleut people, who, although they vacated the island in the 19th century after Russian fur traders reduced sea otter numbers in the area, are resident on nearby islands, and were concerned about radiation leaks as well as potential physical damage resulting from the nuclear tests.|$|E
50|$|In 1949, Smith at Oak Ridge {{conducted}} a study sponsored by <b>the</b> <b>A.E.C.’s</b> Division of Biology and Medicine, and performed calculations to determine the theoretical number of atomic bomb detonations necessary to achieve significant radiation exposure and radioactive material fallout. In 1951 after the Ranger and Greenhouse tests, Smith reassessed the earlier calculations and estimates. He determined that detonation of 100,000 Nagasaki type bombs would be sufficient to achieve the doomsday effect. With this information, <b>the</b> <b>A.E.C.’s</b> staff of <b>the</b> Division of Biology and Medicine concluded this to be extremely remote and dubbed the study as Project GABRIEL.|$|R
30|$|To {{assess the}} effects of the BMSCs on {{surfactant}} synthesis, phospholipid production by <b>the</b> primary rat <b>AECs</b> co-cultured with BMSCs was measured using a LipidTOX phospholipidosis detection reagent (Invitrogen).

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>AEC</b> commissioners {{asked for}} Major General Lauris Norstad, {{the head of}} the Operations and Plans Division, but neither the Chief of Staff of the Army, General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower, nor the Secretary of War, Robert P. Patterson, was willing to release him. The commissioners then {{selected}} McCormack. The job came with a promotion to brigadier general. The commissioners got the kind of officer that they wanted. McCormack was willing to accept the post as a staff job, and took a pragmatic approach to the custody issue. Like most military officers, he was convinced that the men who had to use the nuclear weapons in battle needed to have experience in their proper maintenance, storage and handling. However, he was also aware of the sensitivity of the issue of custody, which Congress had assigned to <b>the</b> <b>AEC.</b> Rather than continue to press for changes in the law, he accepted the situation as it was, and strove {{to make the best of}} it, working within the existing framework.|$|E

30|$|On the {{day before}} <b>the</b> <b>AECs</b> were prepared, rat BMSCs were plated at a density of 5 [*]×[*] 103 cells/cm 2 onto {{the base of the}} well.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>AEC</b> would {{eventually}} concede, as well, that even {{low levels of}} radiation were harmful.

5|$|The Polish {{mathematician}} Stanislaw Ulam, {{his wife}} Francoise Ulam, who performed the calculations, and their collaborator, Cornelius Everett, {{worked on the}} Super design through 1949. There was no push from the military for the weapon, because <b>the</b> <b>AEC</b> regarded it as too secret to inform either its own Military Liaison Committee or the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project about it. In September 1949, the Soviet Union detonated a nuclear device. It fell to Oppenheimer, as chairman of <b>the</b> <b>AEC</b> General Advisory Committee (GAC), {{to decide whether the}} United States should develop the Super in response. The Super design used large quantities of tritium, which could only be manufactured in a reactor, and therefore at the expense of plutonium production for smaller weapons, so the GAC advised against it. Nonetheless, Truman approved the Super on January 31, 1950. Because of the secrecy surrounding the decision, accounts published in the 1950s incorrectly portrayed Oppenheimer as obstructing its development on political grounds, and this was a factor in the Oppenheimer security hearing in 1954.|$|E
5|$|The project {{expenditure}} through 1 October 1945 was $1.845billion, {{equivalent to}} less than nine days of wartime spending, and was $2.191billion when <b>the</b> <b>AEC</b> assumed control on 1 January 1947. Total allocation was $2.4billion. Over 90% of the cost was for building plants and producing the fissionable materials, and less than 10% for development and production of the weapons.|$|E
5|$|The tournament {{generated}} {{a profit of}} £10 and the pony roller stayed in use. When the tournament was finished, Henry Jones gathered all the score cards to analyse the results and found that, of the 601 games played during the tournament, 376 were won by the server ("striker-in") and 225 by the receiver ("striker-out"). At {{a time when the}} service was either made underarm or, usually, at shoulder height, this was seen as a serving dominance and resulted in a modification of the rules for the 1878 Championship. To decrease the target area for the server, the length of the service court was reduced from 26 to 22ft (7.92 to 6.71m) and to make passing shots easier against volleyers the height of the net was reduced to 4ft 9 in (1.45m) at the posts and 3 feet (0.91m) at the centre. These rules were published jointly by <b>the</b> <b>AEC</b> & LTC and the MCC, giving <b>the</b> <b>AEC</b> & LTC an official rule-making authority and in effect retroactively sanctioning its 1877 rules. It marked the moment when <b>the</b> <b>AEC</b> & LTC effectively usurped the rule-making initiative from the MCC although the latter would still ratify rule changes until 1882. In recognition of the importance and popularity of lawn tennis, the club was renamed in 1882 to All England Lawn Tennis Club (AELTC).|$|E

50|$|An {{increasing}} number of critics during the 1960s charged that <b>the</b> <b>AEC's</b> regulations were insufficiently rigorous in several important areas, including radiation protection standards, nuclear reactor safety, plant siting, and environmental protection. By 1974, <b>the</b> <b>AEC's</b> regulatory programs had come under such strong attack that Congress decided to abolish the agency. The agency was abolished by the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, which assigned its functions to two new agencies: the Energy Research and Development Administration and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. On August 4, 1977, President Jimmy Carter signed into law The Department of Energy Organization Act of 1977, which created the Department of Energy.
