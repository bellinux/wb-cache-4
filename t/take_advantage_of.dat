5|$|Because the {{aviation}} industry is especially {{sensitive to the}} weather, accurate weather forecasting is essential. Fog or exceptionally low ceilings can prevent many aircraft from landing and taking off. Turbulence and icing are also significant in-flight hazards. Thunderstorms are a problem for all aircraft because of severe turbulence due to their updrafts and outflow boundaries, icing due to the heavy precipitation, as well as large hail, strong winds, and lightning, {{all of which can}} cause severe damage to an aircraft in flight. Volcanic ash is also a significant problem for aviation, as aircraft can lose engine power within ash clouds. On a day-to-day basis airliners are routed to <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> the jet stream tailwind to improve fuel efficiency. Aircrews are briefed prior to takeoff on the conditions to expect en route and at their destination. Additionally, airports often change which runway is being used to <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> a headwind. This reduces the distance required for takeoff, and eliminates potential crosswinds.|$|E

Roberts had grown weary of battling over the direction he felt the Yamaha team needed to pursue. Basing his new company in England to <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> the Formula 1 industry, Roberts built a three-cylinder, two-stroke engine with the engineering assistance of Tom Walkinshaw Racing. He decided to <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> rules allowing lighter weights for three-cylinder motorcycles after observing the agility and handling advantage of Spencer's Honda NS500 during the 1983 season. Unfortunately, by the time the motorcycle had been developed, tire technology had improved to the point where any advantage over four-cylinder bikes had been negated.
