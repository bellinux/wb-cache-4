50|$|Emperor Lalibela of Ethiopia {{built the}} city of Lalibela as a new reconstructed Jerusalem in {{response}} to the Muslim capture of Jerusalem by Saladin's forces in 1187. The Eastern Orthodox Church teaches that <b>the</b> New <b>Jerusalem</b> is <b>the</b> City of God that will come down from heaven in the manner described in the Book of the Apocalypse (Revelation). The Church is an icon of <b>the</b> heavenly <b>Jerusalem.</b> <b>The</b> New <b>Jerusalem</b> Monastery in Russia takes its name from <b>the</b> heavenly <b>Jerusalem.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Based on the Book of Revelation, premillennialism holds that, {{following}} the end {{times and the}} second creation of heaven and earth (see The New Earth), <b>the</b> New <b>Jerusalem</b> will be <b>the</b> earthly location where all true believers will spend eternity with God. <b>The</b> New <b>Jerusalem</b> {{is not limited to}} eschatology, however. Many Christians view <b>the</b> New <b>Jerusalem</b> as a current reality, that <b>the</b> New <b>Jerusalem</b> is <b>the</b> consummation of the Body of Christ, the Church and that Christians already take part in membership of both <b>the</b> heavenly <b>Jerusalem</b> and <b>the</b> earthly Church in a kind of dual citizenship. In this way, <b>the</b> New <b>Jerusalem</b> represents to Christians the final and everlasting reconciliation of God and His chosen people, [...] "the end of the Christian pilgrimage." [...] As such, <b>the</b> New <b>Jerusalem</b> is a conception of Heaven, see also Heaven (Christianity).|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> New <b>Jerusalem</b> was an {{important}} theme in the Puritan colonization of New England in the 17th century.

5|$|While {{the plan}} was {{approved}} by the city in 1972, it aroused keen opposition from preservationist, environmentalist, and religious groups. In response to the outcry, the city department of town planning submitted a scaled-back design calling for an above-ground traffic system, a pedestrian plaza fronting Jaffa Gate, the retention of facades along Mamilla and King Solomon Streets, and the demolition of historic buildings only {{in the heart of the}} Mamilla valley. Though Safdie incorporated these suggestions into a new plan submitted in 1976, opposition continued unabated by such bodies as <b>the</b> <b>Jerusalem</b> District Planning Commission, <b>the</b> <b>Jerusalem</b> Merchants Association, and the Council for a Beautiful Israel. Nevertheless, in the 1970s, the city spent NIS 130 million to move over 700 families out of Mamilla to the Neve Yaakov, Pisgat Ze'ev, Katamon, and Baka neighborhoods. Workshops and garages were relocated to Talpiot, where they formed the core of the nascent Talpiot industrial zone.|$|E
5|$|According to Theissen and Merz, it {{is common}} for {{extraordinary}} charismatic leaders, such as Jesus, to come into conflict with their ordinary families. In Mark, Jesus' family comes to get him, fearing that he is mad (Mark 3:20–34), and this account is likely historical because early Christians would not have invented it. After Jesus' death, many members of his family joined the Christian movement. Jesus' brother James became a leader of <b>the</b> <b>Jerusalem</b> Church.|$|E
