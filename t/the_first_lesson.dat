At the Jubilee service, the Chief Justice of New South Wales, Tom Bathurst, read <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>lesson</b> and the service concluded with the Australian National Anthem and an organ postlude of Edward Elgar's Pomp and Circumstance March No. 4.

500|$|By 1870 {{three of}} the {{important}} lessons of the Austro-Prussian war had become apparent. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>lesson</b> was that, through force of arms, a powerful state could challenge the old alliances and spheres of influence established in 1815. Second, through diplomatic maneuvering, a skillful leader could create {{an environment in which}} a rival state would declare war first, thus forcing states allied with the [...] "victim" [...] of external aggression to come to the leader's aid. Finally, as Prussian military capacity far exceeded that of Austria, Prussia was clearly the only state within the Confederation (or among the German states generally) capable of protecting all of them from potential interference or aggression. In 1866, most mid-sized German states had opposed Prussia, but by 1870 these states had been coerced and coaxed into mutually protective alliances with Prussia. In the event that a European state declared war on one of their members, they all would come to the defense of the attacked state. With skillful manipulation of European politics, Bismarck created a situation in which France would play the role of aggressor in German affairs, while Prussia would play that of the protector of German rights and liberties.|$|E
500|$|The Order of Service for Royal Maundy is {{a simple}} one. [...] It begins with the reading of John 13:34, which {{contains}} the mandatum from which Royal Maundy evolved. It contains two lessons, {{the first of which}} (John 13) also recalls the mandatum. [...] The second reading contains that portion of Matthew 25 which describes the Last Judgment. [...] The Queen makes half of the presentations after <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>lesson,</b> and half after the second. [...] Anthems, led by the Chapel Royal choir and the local choir, are sung while the distribution is going on, concluding with George Frideric Handel's coronation anthem Zadok the Priest. [...] The Royal Maundy service concludes with prayers, [...] "God Save the Queen" [...] and the blessing. [...] Two hymns are sung; there is no address. [...] Six silver dishes are used to hold the gifts; one, the traditional Maundy Dish, forms part of the Royal Regalia and is held at the Tower of London when not in use. [...] All six dishes date from the reign of Charles II; five of the six {{have been added to the}} service since 1971. They are held by the Yeomen as the Queen walks about, greeting recipients and giving them their gifts. [...] The Lord High Almoner receives his only recompense for his position if he attends the Royal Maundy service—a small fee, though payable in Maundy money.|$|E

500|$|Ned meets up {{with the}} church council to suggest {{promotion}} of creationism. The next day, he and Reverend Lovejoy blackmail Principal Skinner into introducing creationism in the school. Lisa is perturbed by this, and at a town meeting asks everyone {{to make a choice}} between creationism and Darwinism, as there is only one truth. The townspeople vote for creationism, much to her chagrin, and the act of teaching or learning Darwinism and evolution is made illegal. Lisa therefore decides to start holding secret classes for people interested in evolution. However, just as <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>lesson</b> is about to begin, she is arrested by Chief Wiggum. She asks why she's being arrested when there are far worse crimes out there, and embarrassed he tells her they only have enough manpower to enforce the last three laws passed, even stating that it's the worst law system there is. Lisa is brought to trial, which is dubbed Lisa Simpson v. God. Representing her is Clarice Drummond, a despised American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) lawyer, while on God’s (i.e., Ned's) side is Wallace Brady, a beloved, overweight, southern lawyer. The trial does not go smoothly for Lisa, as Professor Frink (called by Clarice) gives ambiguous answers regarding God's existence, while a creationist scientist says that evolution cannot be real, as there is no proof of a [...] "missing link" [...] (depicted in a picture as a savage hominid, holding a rock over his head).|$|E

Lady Carlotta decides not to correct the mistake, acknowledges herself as Miss Hope, a proponent of [...] "the Schartz-Metterklume method" [...] of making children understand history by acting it out themselves, and chooses the Rape of the Sabine Women (exemplified by a washerwoman's two girls) as <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>lesson.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Indeed, Bourguiba {{developed}} a great consideration for mathematics {{because of the}} attention that dedicated his new teacher, Mr. Perrachon to his students. However, he was never present during French lessons, taught by an old regularly heckled professor: [...] "Our timetable scheduled, for Friday afternoon, a history-geography lesson, from 2pm to 3pm and a french lesson from 3pm to 4pm. I was present during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>lesson</b> then left high school at 3pm {{in order to go}} to the theatre where an Arab play was held, in Friday afternoon [...] I was very keen on drama. I thought, moreover, that in matters of French, I really did not need to provide additional efforts, being taught by Mr. Collières at Sadiki". Indeed, he was ranked first in quarterly exams of French, despite these repeated absences. The reason was mere according to Bourguiba who explained it: [...] "Every Friday afternoon, a supervisor came to our history class at 2p.m. He checked the presents and wrote the names of those who were absent. Thus supervisor, who by the way was Tunisian, came back the next hour in french classes. The professor, whose dignity forbade him to suffer a native heckling, hastened to mention the same names written on the notebook and sign. Thus, I had never attended French classes and my absences were regularly unnoticed". Nevertheless, during quarterly exams, Bourguiba was ranked first of second in French.|$|E
