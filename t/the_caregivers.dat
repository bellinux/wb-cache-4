5|$|During {{the early}} and {{moderate}} stages, modifications to the living environment and lifestyle can increase patient safety and reduce caretaker burden. Examples of such modifications are the adherence to simplified routines, the placing of safety locks, the labelling of household items to cue {{the person with the}} disease or the use of modified daily life objects. If eating becomes problematic, food will need to be prepared in smaller pieces or even pureed. When swallowing difficulties arise, the use of feeding tubes may be required. In such cases, the medical efficacy and ethics of continuing feeding is an important consideration of <b>the</b> <b>caregivers</b> and family members. The use of physical restraints is rarely indicated in any stage of the disease, although there are situations when they are necessary to prevent harm to the person with AD or their caregivers.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} how supporting {{a child with}} autistic spectrum disorder to learn the routine tasks of eating {{and going to the}} bathroom would be influenced by a caregiver's understanding of a child with autistic spectrum disorder. <b>The</b> <b>caregiver</b> observes <b>the</b> child carefully, and as <b>the</b> <b>caregiver's</b> concern of meta-level progresses, <b>the</b> <b>caregiver's</b> understanding of <b>the</b> child is also greatly improved.

50|$|To have a {{caregiver}} {{a person may}} have to decide on changes on where they live and with whom they live. When someone needs a <b>caregiver,</b> <b>the</b> two must meet, and this typically happens either in the person's own home or <b>the</b> <b>caregiver's</b> home. Consequently, this could mean that a person moves to live with <b>the</b> <b>caregiver,</b> or <b>the</b> <b>caregiver</b> moves {{to live with the}} person. It is also possible that <b>the</b> <b>caregiver</b> only visits occasionally or is able to provide support remotely, or that the person who needs care is able to travel to <b>the</b> <b>caregiver</b> to get it.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{validate}} <b>the</b> <b>Caregiver</b> Mastery Scale for {{partners of}} patients with acquired brain injury. DESIGN: The score distributions, internal consistency and convergent validity of <b>the</b> <b>Caregiver</b> Mastery Scale were determined. SUBJECTS: A total of 92 partners (53 % male, age 62 years) {{of patients with}} acquired brain injury (91 % stroke) discharged from inpatient rehabilitation (time since injury 32 months). MAIN MEASURES: Outcome measure: Caregiver Mastery Scale. Reference measures: Caregiver Strain Index, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and CarerQoL. RESULTS: <b>The</b> <b>Caregiver</b> Mastery Scale has a normal distribution, with no floor or ceiling effects. Its internal consistency is acceptable (Cronbach's alpha: 0. 75). The convergent validity analyses confirmed our hypothesis that higher scores on <b>the</b> <b>Caregiver</b> Mastery Scale correlate with less burden, lower levels of anxiety and depression and greater well-being. Furthermore, partners scoring high on <b>the</b> <b>Caregiver</b> Mastery Scale mostly scored below the clinical cut-off scores on <b>the</b> <b>Caregiver</b> Strain Index and the anxiety and depression subscales of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, whereas partners scoring low on <b>the</b> <b>Caregiver</b> Mastery Scale {{were more likely to}} score above the cut-off points.

25|$|Victims {{have the}} right to refuse any {{evidence}} collection. Victims advocates ensure the victims' wishes are respected by hospital staff. After the physical injuries are addressed and treatment has begun, then forensic examination proceeds along with the gathering of evidence {{that can be used to}} identify and document the injuries. Such evidence-gathering is only done with the complete consent of the patient or <b>the</b> <b>caregivers</b> of the patient. Photographs of the injuries may be requested by staff. At this point in the treatment, if a victims' advocate had not been requested earlier, experienced social support staff are made available to the patient and family.|$|E
25|$|The APSAC Task Force {{describes}} how the conceptual focus of these treatments is the child's individual internal pathology and past caregivers rather than current parent-child relationships or current environment. If the child is well-behaved outside the home this is seen as successful manipulation of outsiders, rather than as evidence of {{a problem in the}} current home or current parent-child relationship. The APSAC Task Force noted that this perspective has its attractions because it relieves <b>the</b> <b>caregivers</b> of responsibility to change aspects of their own behavior and aspirations. Proponents believe that traditional therapies fail to help children with attachment problems because it is impossible to establish a trusting relationship with them. They believe this is because children with attachment problems actively avoid forming genuine relationships. Proponents emphasize the child's resistance to attachment and the need to break it down. In rebirthing and similar approaches, protests of distress from the child are considered to be resistance that must be overcome by more coercion.|$|E
25|$|In 1969, Gerwitz {{discussed}} how {{mother and child}} could provide each other with positive reinforcement experiences through their mutual attention and therefore learn to stay close together; this explanation would make it unnecessary to posit innate human characteristics fostering attachment. Learning theory saw attachment as a remnant of dependency {{and the quality of}} attachment as merely a response to <b>the</b> <b>caregivers</b> cues. Behaviourists saw behaviours such as crying as a random activity that meant nothing until reinforced by a caregivers response therefore frequent responses would result in more crying. To attachment theorists, crying is an inborn attachment behaviour to which the caregiver must respond if the infant is to develop emotional security. Conscientious responses produce security which enhances autonomy and results in less crying. Ainsworth's research in Baltimore supported the attachment theorists view. In the last decade, behaviour analysts have constructed models of attachment based on the importance of contingent relationships. These behaviour analytic models have received some support from research and meta-analytic reviews.|$|E
5|$|A {{securely}} attached toddler will explore freely while <b>the</b> <b>caregiver</b> is present, engage with strangers, be visibly upset when <b>the</b> <b>caregiver</b> departs, and {{happy to see}} <b>the</b> <b>caregiver</b> return. <b>The</b> anxious-ambivalent toddler is anxious of exploration, extremely distressed when <b>the</b> <b>caregiver</b> departs but ambivalent when <b>the</b> <b>caregiver</b> returns. <b>The</b> anxious-avoidant toddler will not explore much, avoid or ignore the parent—showing little emotion when the parent departs or returns—and treat strangers much <b>the</b> same as <b>caregivers</b> with little emotional range shown. The disorganized/disoriented toddler shows a lack of a coherent style or pattern for coping. Evidence suggests this occurs when the caregiving figure is also an object of fear, thus putting the child in an irresolvable situation regarding approach and avoidance. On reunion with <b>the</b> <b>caregiver,</b> these children can look dazed or frightened, freezing in place, backing toward <b>the</b> <b>caregiver</b> or approaching with head sharply averted, or showing other behaviors implying fear {{of the person who}} is being sought. It is thought to represent a breakdown of an inchoate attachment strategy and it appears to affect the capacity to regulate emotions.|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} psychometric {{properties}} of <b>the</b> <b>Caregiver</b> Strain Index Expanded with those of <b>the</b> original <b>Caregiver</b> Strain Index among partners of stroke patients. Design and subjects: Cross-sectional validation study among 173 caregivers of stroke patients six months post-stroke. Main measures: Outcome measure: Caregiver Strain Index Expanded. Reference measures: Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, two questions on life satisfaction, Barthel Index and Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Additionally, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale. Results: Neither <b>the</b> <b>Caregiver</b> Strain Index Expanded nor <b>the</b> original <b>Caregiver</b> Strain Index showed floor or ceiling effects. The sum score of the positive items showed a ceiling effect and was skewed to the right (2. 20). Principal component analysis revealed no clear underlying item clustering. Alpha values of <b>the</b> <b>Caregiver</b> Strain Index Expanded and <b>the</b> original <b>Caregiver</b> Strain Index were good (0. 82 and 0. 83), but the alpha value of the positive subscale of <b>the</b> <b>Caregiver</b> Strain Index Expanded was too low (0. 51).

25|$|Anxious-resistant {{insecure}} attachment is {{also called}} ambivalent attachment.

When <b>the</b> <b>caregiver</b> departs, <b>the</b> child is often highly distressed. The child is generally ambivalent when they return. The Anxious-Ambivalent/Resistant strategy {{is a response to}} unpredictably responsive caregiving, and that the displays of anger or helplessness towards <b>the</b> <b>caregiver</b> on reunion can be regarded as a conditional strategy for maintaining the availability of <b>the</b> <b>caregiver</b> by preemptively taking control of the interaction.|$|R
