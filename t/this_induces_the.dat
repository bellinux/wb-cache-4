25|$|Checkpoint {{regulation}} {{plays an}} important role in an organism's development. In sexual reproduction, when egg fertilization occurs, when the sperm binds to the egg, it releases signalling factors that notify the egg that it has been fertilized. Among other things, <b>this</b> <b>induces</b> <b>the</b> now fertilized oocyte to return from its previously dormant, G0, state back into the cell cycle and on to mitotic replication and division.|$|E
500|$|Condors {{begin to}} look for a mate when they reach sexual {{maturity}} at the age of six. To attract a prospective mate, the male condor performs a display, in which the male turns his head red and puffs out his neck feathers. He then spreads his wings and slowly approaches the female. If the female lowers her head to accept the male, the condors become mates for life. The pair makes a simple nest in caves or on cliff clefts, especially ones with nearby roosting trees and open spaces for landing. A mated female lays one bluish-white egg every other year. Eggs are laid as early as January to as late as April. The egg weighs about [...] and measures from [...] in length and about [...] in width. If the chick or egg is lost or removed, the parents [...] "double clutch", or lay another egg to take the lost one's place. Researchers and breeders take advantage of this behavior to double the reproductive rate by taking the first egg away for puppet-rearing; <b>this</b> <b>induces</b> <b>the</b> parents to lay a second egg, which the condors are sometimes allowed to raise.|$|E

2500|$|Each pixel of an LCD {{typically}} {{consists of}} a layer of molecules aligned between two transparent electrodes, and two polarizing filters (parallel and perpendicular), the axes of transmission of which are (in most of the cases) perpendicular to each other. Without the [...] liquid crystal between the polarizing filters, light passing through the first filter would be blocked by the second (crossed) polarizer. Before an electric field is applied, {{the orientation of the}} liquid-crystal molecules is determined by the alignment at the surfaces of electrodes. In a twisted nematic (TN) device, the surface alignment directions at the two electrodes are perpendicular to each other, and so the molecules arrange themselves in a helical structure, or twist. <b>This</b> <b>induces</b> <b>the</b> rotation of the polarization of the incident light, and the device appears gray. If the applied voltage is large enough, the liquid crystal molecules {{in the center of the}} layer are almost completely untwisted and the polarization of the incident light is not rotated as it passes through the liquid crystal layer. This light will then be mainly polarized perpendicular to the second filter, and thus be blocked and the pixel will appear black. By controlling the voltage applied across the liquid crystal layer in each pixel, light can be allowed to pass through in varying amounts thus constituting different levels of gray. [...] Color LCD systems use the same technique, with color filters used to generate red, green, and blue pixels.|$|E

50|$|Inoculation is {{performed}} on a suitable mammal, {{such as a}} mouse, rabbit or goat.Larger mammals are often preferred {{as the amount of}} serum that can be collected is greater.

50|$|Isocyanide based MCRs {{are most}} {{frequently}} exploited because the isocyanide is an extraordinary functional group. It is believed to exhibit resonance between its tetravalent and divalent carbon forms. <b>This</b> <b>induces</b> <b>the</b> isocyanide group to undergo both electrophilic and nucleophilic reactions at the CII atom, which then converts to the CIV form in an exothermic reaction. The occurrence of isocyanides in natural products has also made it a useful functional group. The two most important isocyanide-based multicomponent reactions are the Passerini 3-component reaction to produce α-acyloxy carboxamides and the Ugi 4-component reaction, which yields the α-acylamino carboxamides.|$|E
5000|$|For a {{complete}} {{recovery of the}} reproductive tract, the hen's body weight must drop by 30 to 35 percent during the forced molt. This is typically achieved by withdrawing the hen's feed for 7-14 days, sometimes up to 28 days. [...] <b>This</b> <b>induces</b> <b>the</b> birds to lose their feathers, cease to lay eggs and lose body-weight. [...] Some programs combine feed withdrawal with a period of water withdrawal. Most programs also restrict the amount of lighting to provide a daylight period that is too short to stimulate egg production, providing a simulated autumn, the natural time of molt and minimum egg production.|$|E
50|$|The {{discovery}} of the massacre {{seems to have been}} by chance. The consensus account is that American Lieutenant Emerson Hunt, a liaison officer between Ozark HQ and the 701st Tank Battalion, was captured by German forces on April 14, 1945, that he bluffed the German forces defending the town of Gardelegen into believing that American tanks were approaching the city, and that <b>this</b> <b>induced</b> <b>the</b> German commander to surrender to the American forces.

50|$|In 435 BC, a {{force of}} Fidenates, with re-inforcements from Veii, took {{advantage}} of a pestilence at Rome.

50|$|The macaques' {{contact with}} large numbers of {{tourists}} was causing the integrity of their social groups to break down, as they began to become dependent on humans. <b>This</b> <b>induced</b> <b>the</b> monkeys to forage in the town, resulting in damage to buildings, clothing, and vehicles. Close contact with humans has also led to the macaques learning how to open pockets and unzip handbags and rucksacks in order to steal food from humans. For these reasons, deliberately feeding the macaques in Gibraltar is now an offence punishable by law. Anyone caught feeding the monkeys is liable to be fined up to £4,000.|$|R

50|$|Administering {{monoclonal}} antibodies (mAbs) {{is a form}} {{of passive}} immunotherapy. MAbs facilitate destruction of tumor cells by complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). In CDC, mAbs bind to specific antigen, leading to activation of the complement cascade, which in turn leads to formation of pores in tumor cells. In ADCC, the Fab domain of a mAb binds to a tumor antigen, and Fc domain binds to Fc receptors present on effector cells (phagocytes and NK cells), thus forming a bridge between an effector and a target cells. <b>This</b> <b>induces</b> <b>the</b> effector cell activation, leading to phagocytosis of the tumor cell by neutrophils and macrophages. Furthermore, NK cells release cytotoxic molecules, which lyse tumor cells.|$|E
