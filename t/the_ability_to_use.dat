5|$|Guitar Hero 5 {{was seen}} by Pocket Gamer UK to be yet another {{iteration}} of the series on mobile platforms, though the game still stands on its own given the numerous other music-based games for mobile phones.

5|$|Many of Canada's {{top players}} were NHL {{professional}}s, so the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) pushed for <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> professional and amateur players. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) voted to allow all athletes {{to compete in}} Olympic Games held after 1988. The NHL was initially reluctant to allow its players to compete because the Olympics are held {{in the middle of}} the NHL season. An agreement was later reached and NHL players began competing in 1998.|$|E
5|$|The E {{class were}} ordered {{as part of}} the 1931 Naval Construction Programme, the F class {{following}} in 1932. These ships were based on the preceding D class with minor changes to the hull and armament. Two of the ships were modified to accommodate 60 mines. The F class were repeats of the E's with some minor differences. All of the destroyers were fitted with ASDIC (sonar) and <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the Two-Speed Destroyer Sweep (TSDS) minesweeping gear.|$|E
5|$|The G {{class were}} ordered {{as part of}} the 1933 Naval Construction Programme, the H class {{following}} in 1934. These ships were based on the preceding F class, but the elimination of cruising turbines and the development of more compact machinery allowed their dimensions and displacement to be slightly reduced. The H class were repeats of the G's with some minor differences. All of the destroyers were fitted with ASDIC (sonar) and <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the Two-Speed Destroyer Sweep (TSDS) minesweeping gear.|$|E

5|$|To {{offset the}} {{difficulty}} of having things forbidden for use, {{there are certain things}} that are recommended by the Judges, and therefore grant Judge Points if used. Judge Points (JP) are used to carry out combos with nearby allies or to summon a Totema. JP are also received upon knocking out an opponent. Later in the game, the player gains <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> law cards, which can add laws, and anti-law cards, which can nullify laws that are already in effect.|$|E
5|$|Trapper: The Trapper-class {{characters}} can {{use their}} gear to track the Monster's movements. As the Monster occasionally scatters local wildlife, such as birds, the trapper can use these 'signs' to find {{the location of the}} monster. Trappers also have other abilities and tools that can slow the movements of the Monster. Following the release of the Stage 2 alpha, all hunters gained <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the mobile arena and the trappers gained the plant scanner ability, similar to the monster's smell.|$|E

5|$|Windows RT was {{released}} to mixed reviews from various outlets and critics. Some felt that Windows RT devices had advantages over other mobile platforms (such as iOS or Android) {{because of its}} bundled software and <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> {{a wider variety of}} USB peripherals and accessories, but the platform was criticized for its poor software ecosystem, citing the early state of Windows Store and its incompatibility with existing Windows software, and other limitations over Windows 8.|$|E
5|$|A strain is a {{subgroup}} {{within the}} species that has unique characteristics that distinguish it from other strains. These differences are often detectable only at the molecular level; however, they may result in changes to the physiology or lifecycle of the bacterium. For example, a strain may gain pathogenic capacity, <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> a unique carbon source, {{the ability to take}} upon a particular ecological niche, or the ability to resist antimicrobial agents. Different strains of E. coli are often host-specific, making it possible to determine the source of fecal contamination in environmental samples. For example, knowing which E. coli strains are present in a water sample allows researchers to make assumptions about whether the contamination originated from a human, another mammal, or a bird.|$|E
5|$|Each of {{the five}} band members has a unique {{character}} class, which vary from one another mainly by the special magical attacks, called Anar-chi, that they can use. Anar-chi attacks include Tommy Homicide's ability to summon acid-coated buzzsaws and The Rexecutioner's ability to summon and use a debris-spitting drum kit. Players are able to use new abilities by visiting an in-game tattoo parlor. Tattoos, and the special abilities that they unlock, are character-specific. Players can also unlock new abilities, including additional combination attacks, group attacks, and <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> two weapons at once, by leveling up.|$|E

5|$|Folding@home {{can use the}} {{parallel}} computing abilities of modern multi-core processors. <b>The</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> several CPU cores simultaneously allows completing the full simulation far faster. Working together, these CPU cores complete single work units proportionately faster than the standard uniprocessor client. This method is scientifically valuable because it enables much longer simulation trajectories to be performed in {{the same amount of}} time, and reduces the traditional difficulties of scaling a large simulation to many separate processors. A 2007 publication in the Journal of Molecular Biology relied on multi-core processing to simulate the folding of part of the villin protein approximately 10 times longer than was possible with a single-processor client, in agreement with experimental folding rates.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the success}} of the GR1B/T2B upgrade, the RAF {{launched}} a plan to upgrade its Jaguar fleet to a common standard, incorporating improvements introduced to some aircraft during the Gulf War, together with adding <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> TIALD and new reconnaissance pods. The upgrade came in two parts; the interim GR3 (Jaguar 96) upgrade added a new HUD, a new hand controller and stick top, integrated GPS and TERPROM Terrain Referenced Navigation. It was delivered in two standards, for recce and TIALD. The further upgraded Jaguar GR3A (also known as Jaguar 97) introduced fleet-wide compatibility with TIALD and the new EO GP1 (JRP) digital reconnaissance pod, a helmet mounted sight, improved cockpit displays, a datalink, and improved Night vision goggles compatibility. All GR3As were subsequently re-engined with the new Adour 106 turbofan.|$|E
5|$|Free updates to {{the game}} were {{released}} to provide fixes and updates {{to the game}}, some based on community feedback. These included: a Big Head mode, which makes all characters in the game have disproportionate heads; a photo mode, which allows players to edit photos taken during gameplay; <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the original voice cast, with localized subtitles; and updates to the game's AR challenges. These included the ability to select all playable characters from the game and its downloadable content (DLC) {{to be used in}} all combat and predator challenge maps. Previously, each map had predefined character selection; the addition of a harder difficulty setting on combat challenges; more round-based challenges as well as interior map locations; and the removal of the blue wall around the challenges, which players found distracting.|$|E
