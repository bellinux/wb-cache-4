25|$|Immigrant {{children}}—defined {{as those}} {{children under age}} eighteen who are either foreign-born or U.S.-born to immigrant parents—now account for one-fourth of the nation’s 75 million children. By 2050 they are projected to make up one-third of more than 100 million U.S. children. This highlights that children of immigrants in mixed status families are growing in the United States. Therefore, it is of high importance to understand their experiences {{in this country and}} the impact that a mixed status has on the children growing up in these families facing unique needs and challenges. Mixed immigrant families’ rights are being violated. When there is family separation through immigration practices, children in mixed status household are denied the right <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> their families. They are dehumanized, based on status of their parents.|$|E

Akira was the eighth and youngest child of the moderately wealthy family, with two of his siblings already grown up at the time of his birth and one deceased, leaving Kurosawa <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> three sisters and a brother.|$|E
500|$|A survey {{conducted}} by Minnesota's Department for Families and Children's Services shows that men consider child care {{to be far more}} important than a paycheck. Of 600 dads surveyed, a majority said their most important role was to [...] "show love and affection" [...] to kids. [...] "Safety and protection" [...] came next, followed by [...] "moral guidance," [...] "taking time to play," [...] and [...] "teaching and encouraging." [...] "Financial care" [...] finished last. [...] Many men are now becoming more involved in their children's lives, and because of that many men now {{have a better understanding of}} what life is like for their child growing up in modern society. [...] Because fathers are immersed in their children's lives, many of the stereotypically [...] "manly" [...] attitudes and activities historically prescribed for children may be circumscribed due to a more gender-neutral parenting approach that focuses on promoting independence and emotional well being. This allows children, especially male children, <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a greater capacity for empathy and less rigidity in attitudes pertaining to gender roles than would perhaps be the case in more traditionally-structured households.|$|E
5000|$|Archambeau <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> as {{the oldest}} of four children. Her parents had four kids in five years, {{attributing}} her competitive nature <b>to</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> siblings so close in age. In grade school, Archambeau was heavily involved in sports, but her growth spurt (being 5'10" [...] by ninth grade) kept her from high school sports, causing her to focus on clubs and organizations. Archambeau attended the Wharton School of Business in Pennsylvania. She worked as a sales assistant for IBM {{when she was in}} college, later taking a full-time job in sales after learning that many CEOs had also previously worked in sales.|$|R

2500|$|It {{had always}} been the {{intention}} to have a clean break in the series after Gross' first 25 issues to allow the character time <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up,</b> <b>with</b> Gross having some ideas about where he would take the character next. [...] When the time came, however, DC opted to relaunch the series as [...] with writer Dylan Horrocks. [...] Horrocks introduced the series with a five-issue miniseries, The Names of Magic, that ended with the character learning his true heritage and names and enrolling in a school of magic: this allowed Horrocks to show a more mature version of Tim in the ongoing series, set after Tim's graduation from the school, and deal with real-life issues that hadn't been previously covered in The Books of Magic like bills and hangovers.|$|E
2500|$|As of 2008, {{the infant}} {{mortality}} rate stood at 17 per 1,000, the highest in Russia; There are reports of growing a number of genetic disorders in babies and unexplained illnesses among school children. One child in 10 is born {{with some kind of}} anomaly that requires treatment. Some children whose parents can afford it are sent to the neighbouring republic of Dagestan, where treatment is better; Chechnya lacks sufficient medical equipment in most of its medical facilities. According to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), since 1994 to 2008 about 25,000 children in Chechnya have lost one or both parents. A whole generation of Chechen children is showing symptoms of psychological trauma. In 2006, Chechnya's pro-Moscow deputy health minister, said the Chechen children had become [...] "living specimens" [...] of what it means <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the constant threat of violence and chronic poverty. In 2007, the Chechen interior ministry has identified 1,000 street children involved in vagrancy; the number was increasing.|$|E
2500|$|On Thursday, March 6, 2014 it was {{announced}} that a Vatican panel of medical experts could not determine a natural cause to a miracle attributed to Sheen; this is a major step on the road to beatification. [...] The miracle: the reviving of the stillborn baby mentioned above who survived intact, so far, without having a detectable pulse at his birth for a lengthy period without explanation. For 61 minutes, while his mother prayed for Fulton Sheen's intercession, the child did not breathe and only took his first breaths as doctors were calling his time of death. Doctors predicted the child <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> terrifying effects like organ failure and cerebral palsy. After the child's first 5 months, he was considered to be a normally healthy child. The case will now go on to the Congregation for the Causes of the Saints, for further review. [...] If the Congregation approves the miracle, then the cause will be passed on to Pope Francis, who will ultimately decide and sign and publish documentation on whether or not to beatify Archbishop Sheen, granting him the title of [...] "Blessed".|$|E

2500|$|Toole was in {{constant}} demand {{and went to}} all the parties where it was said [...] "he was encouraged and sometimes forced to perform, Ken would enter a room armed with quiver full of sharp stories and barbed one-liners. He would zing these out until his audience was weak with laughter, though he hadn't cracked a smile." [...] Because he was saving {{for a return to}} Columbia to get his Ph.D., Toole was a notorious skinflint during his year at USL. His friends noticed this and forced him to pay for and throw a party at his home. The party was a success and generally considered the best party thrown that year. In contrast to this image of an outgoing, lively young man, when Toole's mother came to visit, friends noticed that he became sullen and withdrawn. His friend Pat Rickels commented that Thelma [...] "was absolutely convinced that he was without flaw and that all the hopes of the world lay in him. It was an extreme form of maternalism, where all your pride and all your hopes are in one person. He had <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> that burden.

50|$|Most Israelis can {{converse}} in English on {{at least}} a basic level, and secular Israelis who are of a high social and economic status usually possess greater capabilities in English {{than those who are}} of a lower social and economic status (this is mostly due to differing levels of state-sponsored education, as well as variation in cultural exposure to the language). Israelis born from the 1980s onwards generally have better English language skills than their parents and grandparents due <b>to</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a higher level of exposure to the language in the media. Proper usage of the English language is considered a mark of good education among Israelis. In the past, several politicians, including David Levy and Amir Peretz, were mocked openly in the media and in public for their poor English skills.|$|R

50|$|The motivational {{basis for}} this {{behavior}} is varied, starting from socialization, private philosophy, to, Sexual orientation, biological (phenomenal). Throughout history, there have been mixed marriages, and unions, occurring between different racial and ethnic groups. Before 1970, it was less likely for interracial marriages to occur and most people wanted to marry within their group. However miscegenation has long occurred within the individual races due to slavery, the inadequacy of race labels applied by the United States Census and covert common law marriages. Throughout the past thirty years, interracial marriages have tripled. There are many advantages and disadvantages <b>to</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a multiracial background. Children <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> in a multiracial family can sometimes face issues with identity formulation and classification. An important aspect {{in the lives of}} multiracial children is the way they are labeled by themselves, their families, and society. By being classified and labeled, this provides children with a sense of self-empowerment and self-determination.|$|R

Anyway, the American defaulter who goes to Canada never makes any effort <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the country.

No, sir; there's something in defalcation that saps a man's business energies, and I don't suppose that old fellow would have been able to invest in Oiseau's gold mine if it had opened at his feet, and he could have seen the sovereigns ready coined in it. He just couldn't. I can understand that state of mind, though I don't pretend to respect it. I can imagine just how the man trembled to go into some speculation, and didn't dare to. Must have been an old hand at it, too. But it seems as if the money he steals becomes sacred to a man when he gets away with it, and he can't risk it." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{had made}} up my mind that when the time came to {{describe}} Grizel's mere outward appearance I should refuse her that word [...] "beautiful" [...] because of her tilted nose; but now that the time has come, I wonder at myself. Probably when I am chapters ahead I shall return to this one and strike out the word [...] "beautiful," [...] and then, as likely as not, I shall come back afterwards and put it in again. Whether it will be there at the end, God knows. Her eyes, at least, were beautiful. They were unusually far apart, and let you look straight into them, and never quivered; they were such clear, gray, searching eyes, they seemed always to be asking for the truth. And she had an adorable mouth. In repose it was, perhaps, hard, because it shut so decisively; but often it screwed up provokingly at one side, as when she smiled, or was sorry, or for no particular reason; for she seemed unable to control this vagary, which was perhaps a little bit of babyhood that had forgotten <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the rest of her. At those moments the essence of all that was characteristic and delicious about her seemed to have run to her mouth; so that to kiss Grizel on her crooked smile would have been to kiss the whole of her at once. She had a quaint way of nodding her head at you when she was talking. It made you forget what she was saying, though it was really meant to have precisely the opposite effect. Her voice was rich, with many inflections. When she had much to say it gurgled like a stream in a hurry; but its cooing note was best worth remembering {{at the end of the}} day. There were times when she looked like a boy. Her almost gallant bearing, the poise of her head, her noble frankness--they all had something in them of a princely boy who had never known fear.|$|E
