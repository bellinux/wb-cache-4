5|$|As {{the maids}} of honour are {{reflected}} in each other, so too do {{the king and queen}} have their doubles within the painting, in <b>the</b> <b>dimly</b> <b>lit</b> forms of the chaperone and guard, the two who serve and care for their daughter. The positioning of these figures sets up a pattern, one man, a couple, one man, a couple, and while the outer figures are nearer the viewer than the others, they all occupy the same horizontal band on the picture's surface.|$|E
5|$|After {{recording}} sessions, Lennon, Harrison and Starr {{would be}} chauffeured {{back to their}} houses in the 'stockbroker belt' of Southern England, but Aspinall would often drive McCartney and Evans in an Austin Princess limousine to a late-night club to eat. The Bag O'Nails nightclub {{was one of their}} favourites, at 8 Kingly Street in Soho, London, as it also presented live music. They would eat steak, chips and mushy peas, but Aspinall would always take out a torch from his pocket (in <b>the</b> <b>dimly</b> <b>lit</b> club) to inspect the portions on each of their plates. This was {{to make sure that the}} portions were exactly as they had ordered, which McCartney always found amusing. While Harrison, McCartney and Starr passed their driving tests, Lennon didn't pass his driving test until 1965; however, he rarely drove himself due to being a notoriously bad driver by poorly navigating roads and failing to notice other traffic, and as a result, he was usually chauffeured to and from recording sessions and appointments by his own personal chauffeur.|$|E
25|$|Programmed from {{a desktop}} {{computer}} with a wireless network interface controller in Burlington, Ontario, the LEDs use less energy to light than the previous incandescent lights (10% less energy than <b>the</b> <b>dimly</b> <b>lit</b> version and 60% less than the brightly lit version). The estimated cost to use the LEDs is $1,000 per month.|$|E

60|$|Arnold Chetwode {{was young}} and {{his sense of humor}} triumphant. He turned on the {{threshold}} and looked into <b>the</b> shadowy room, <b>dimly</b> <b>lit</b> with its cheap lamp. He kissed his hands to Ruth.|$|R
6000|$|Clement {{nodded at}} him, but said [...] "Hello" [...] to Dan and [...] "Good-evening" [...] to Biddy. Conly, his trusted, {{discreet}} cashier, {{was at his}} desk, and <b>the</b> office was <b>dimly</b> <b>lit</b> with a single electric bulb.|$|R
2500|$|Forming {{the western}} {{antechamber}} {{is an impressive}} gavit of 1261, decorated with splendid khachkars and {{with a series of}} inscribed gravestones in the floor. Note the famous carvings over the outside lintel. [...] The church houses Prince Smbat Orbelian's mausoleum. [...] The gavit was probably a four-pillar one. In 1321 the building, probably destroyed by an earthquake, was covered with a new roof in the shape of an enormous stone tent with horizontal divisions, imitating the wooden roof of the hazarashen—type peasant home. This made the structure quite different from other Armenian monuments of the same kind. The ceiling has four rows of brackets forming stalactite vaulting with a square lighting aperture at the top. A broad protruding girth over the half-columns, the deep niches with khachkars and the low tent-like ceiling almost devoid of decoration give <b>the</b> <b>dimly</b> <b>lit</b> interior a gloomy look.|$|E
6000|$|... "I've {{heard that}} voice before," [...] said Holmes, staring down <b>the</b> <b>dimly</b> <b>lit</b> street. [...] "Now, I wonder who the deuce {{that could have}} been." ...|$|E
60|$|She was silent, and in {{the gloom}} of <b>the</b> <b>dimly</b> <b>lit</b> {{apartment}} {{he could not see}} her face. He drew a little breath of relief. The worst was over now. He continued tenderly, almost affectionately.|$|E
60|$|Walking away {{rapidly to}} {{overtake}} Mr. Keller, he looked behind him once or twice. <b>The</b> street was <b>dimly</b> <b>lit,</b> in those days, {{by a few}} oil lamps. He might be mistaken--but he thought that Madame Fontaine was following him.|$|R
5000|$|Hermandad de Penitencia del Stmo. Cristo del Amparo or ``Las capas pardas´´ (The brown capes) Another {{remarkable}} parades {{the streets}} later on Wednesday of Holy Week. Its 150 members, {{dressed in the}} traditionals brown capes from the nearby village of Aliste (Spanish: capa alistana) walk the streets {{to the sound of}} traditional instruments such as <b>the</b> euphonium, <b>dimly</b> <b>lit</b> by their lanterns. Created in 1956.|$|R
5000|$|There was no {{emergency}} lighting. The {{main auditorium}} lights were never switched on, so <b>the</b> theater remained <b>dimly</b> <b>lit,</b> as during a performance. When tons of burning scenery collapsed onto the stage, the electrical switchboard was destroyed and all electric lights went out.|$|R
60|$|It {{was past}} one {{o'clock in the}} morning when I {{returned}} to the hotel, yet the porter who admitted me pointed toward the figure of a man who stood waiting in <b>the</b> <b>dimly</b> <b>lit</b> hall.|$|E
6000|$|... "I want to {{know what}} the meaning is of the noise in here?" [...] said George Strong severely, as he gazed around <b>the</b> <b>dimly</b> <b>lit</b> apartment, for the lamp was turned low. [...] "You boys are--gracious me! What's this?" ...|$|E
60|$|They stood {{together}} on <b>the</b> <b>dimly</b> <b>lit</b> landing; {{holding his breath}} and listening intently, Wolfenden was at once aware of faint, distant sounds. They came from the ground floor almost immediately below them. His father laid his hand heavily upon Wolfenden's shoulder.|$|E
60|$|It was {{something}} for Michael, who {{on his birthday}} was getting into shirts. The fire was warm, however, and <b>the</b> nursery <b>dimly</b> <b>lit</b> by three night-lights, and presently the sewing lay on Mrs. Darling's lap. Then her head nodded, oh, so gracefully. She was asleep. Look at the four of them, Wendy and Michael over there, John here, and Mrs. Darling by the fire. There {{should have been a}} fourth night-light.|$|R
30|$|When {{looking at}} the {{historical}} evolution of the spatial light Gini coefficients, we saw a gradual increase over the time span of our observations, which is the past 17 years. This is indicative of a centralization of light. A detailed analysis revealed that, between 1992 and 2009, <b>the</b> worldwide <b>dimly</b> <b>lit</b> surface grew 49 %, whereas the bright area expanded 19 %. The total area of <b>dimly</b> <b>lit</b> settlements has, both in relative as in absolute terms, increased more than {{the area of the}} bright cities. It may be counter-intuitive, but this is the major driver behind the observed increase in spatial light Gini coefficients over that period.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> album <b>Dimly</b> <b>Lit</b> was {{recorded}} {{within two weeks}} with engineers John-Michel Cros and Ayumu Matsuo, and was mixed back in London by Factory Floor and These New Puritans collaborator James Aparicio. The artwork was created by long-term friend and The Horrors graphic designer Ciaran O'Shea aka. Discordo. The album also features Amy Turnnidge of Theoretical Girl and Bonnie Carr of Electricity In Our Homes on vocals on [...] "Edward the Confessor" [...] and [...] "The Beat of the Boulevard" [...] respectively.|$|R
60|$|Soon it {{came time}} for Sam to do his turn at guarding, and {{stuffing}} a big bit of candy in his mouth, the youngest Rover stepped out into <b>the</b> <b>dimly</b> <b>lit</b> hallway and sat down on a low stool which one of the guards had placed there.|$|E
60|$|Louise, self-engrossed, {{and with}} a {{pleasant}} sense of detachment from the prospective inconveniences of the moment, was leaning back among the cushions of the motionless car. Her eyes, lifted upward, traveled past <b>the</b> <b>dimly</b> <b>lit</b> hillside, with its patchwork of wall-enclosed fields, up to where the leaning clouds and the unseen heights met in a misty sea of obscurity.|$|E
60|$|In <b>the</b> <b>dimly</b> <b>lit</b> room Nostromo {{rolled his}} head slowly on the pillow and opened his eyes, {{directing}} at the weird figure perched by his bedside a glance of enigmatic and profound inquiry. Then his head rolled back, his eyelids fell, and the Capataz de Cargadores died without a word or moan {{after an hour of}} immobility, broken by short shudders testifying to the most atrocious sufferings.|$|E
60|$|It {{was raining}} heavily. I {{looked up at}} her window, through the {{drifting}} shower. The curtains were parted: she was standing in <b>the</b> gap, <b>dimly</b> <b>lit</b> by <b>the</b> lamp on the table behind her, waiting for our last look at each other. Slowly lifting her hand, she waved her farewell at the window, with the unsought native grace which had charmed me on the night when we first met. The curtain fell again--she disappeared--nothing was before me, nothing was round me, but the darkness and the night.|$|R
2500|$|The Whipping Tom of 1681 {{was active}} in the warren of small courtyards between Fleet Street, Strand and Holborn. He would wait in <b>the</b> narrow and <b>dimly</b> <b>lit</b> alleys and courtyards. On seeing an unaccompanied woman, he would grab her, lift her dress, and slap her {{buttocks}} repeatedly before fleeing. He would sometimes accompany his attacks by shouting [...] "Spanko!" ...|$|R
40|$|I N THE {{blackness}} of <b>the</b> sidesiiect. a <b>dimly</b> <b>lit</b> sign danced {{over an open}} door. Skewing his eyes and cocking his head backwards, Billy {{could just make out}} the words in the bluish glow—The Blue Fox. Now. to him. thai seemed a hilariously funny name and he let out a whoop of uncontrollable laughter as Al and Tom half-carried, half-dragged him inside. ...|$|R
60|$|Nobody spoke or moved. It {{was an odd}} little tableau, grouped {{together}} in <b>the</b> <b>dimly</b> <b>lit</b> room. The footsteps had reached the last flight of stairs now. They came slowly across the landing, then paused, as though the person who approached could see the light shining through the partly open door. They heard a voice, a voice almost unrecognizable, a voice hoarse and tremulous with fear, {{the voice of a}} hunted man.|$|E
60|$|Young Powell {{had settled}} down to the regular officer-of-the-watch tramp in the dense shadow of the world {{decorated}} with stars high above his head, and on earth only a few gleams of light about the ship. The lamp in the after skylight was kept burning through the night. There were also the dead-lights of the stern-cabins glimmering dully in the deck far aft, catching his eye {{when he turned to}} walk that way. The brasses of the wheel glittered too, with <b>the</b> <b>dimly</b> <b>lit</b> figure of the man detached, as if phosphorescent, against the black and spangled background of the horizon.|$|E
60|$|It was {{not often}} we {{permitted}} ourselves such luxuries, {{but as we}} left the theatre I caught a glimpse of Isobel's white face, more clearly visible now than in <b>the</b> <b>dimly</b> <b>lit</b> box, and I knew that, bravely though she had carried herself through the whole of that trying evening, she was not far from breaking down. So I called a hansom, and she sank back in a corner with a little sigh of relief. I lit a cigarette, and suddenly I felt a cold little hand steal into mine. I set my teeth and held it firmly.|$|E
60|$|I {{opened the}} door. <b>The</b> landing was <b>dimly</b> <b>lit,</b> and I could see little else except {{the figure of}} the woman who stood there. With one hand she was leaning against the wall, her face was as white as a sheet; she wore a hastily thrown on dressing-gown of dingy red. Her whole {{appearance}} was that of a person convulsed with fright.|$|R
60|$|Egbert {{came into}} <b>the</b> large, <b>dimly</b> <b>lit</b> drawing-room with <b>the</b> {{air of a}} man who is not certain whether he is {{entering}} a dovecote or a bomb factory, and is prepared for either eventuality. The little domestic quarrel over the luncheon-table had not been fought to a definite finish, and the question was how far Lady Anne was in a mood to renew or forgo hostilities. Her pose in the arm-chair by the tea-table was rather elaborately rigid; in the gloom of a December afternoon Egbert’s pince-nez did not materially help him to discern the expression of her face.|$|R
50|$|An {{elevated}} entrance fulfilled two functions: firstly, it {{protected the}} building's occupants and, secondly, the castellan could invite visitors into the domestic {{area of the}} castle. In <b>the</b> lower, often <b>dimly</b> <b>lit</b> floor, supplies, equipment and materiel were often stored. Ground-level openings in ruins that may be seen here and there today were, in many cases, where the lower floor was subsequently broken into but were not there originally.|$|R
60|$|In {{contrast}} with the white glaring room <b>the</b> <b>dimly</b> <b>lit</b> corredor had a restful mysteriousness of a forest glade, suggested by the stems and {{the leaves of the}} plants ranged along the balustrade of the open side. In the streaks of light falling through the open doors of the reception-rooms, the blossoms, white and red and pale lilac, came out vivid with the brilliance of flowers in a stream of sunshine; and Mrs. Gould, passing on, had the vividness of a figure seen in the clear patches of sun that chequer the gloom of open glades in the woods. The stones in the rings upon her hand pressed to her forehead glittered in the lamplight abreast of the door of the sala.|$|E
60|$|The Assistant Commissioner, {{reaching}} this conclusion, {{entered the}} street in his turn, and came upon a large van arrested in front of <b>the</b> <b>dimly</b> <b>lit</b> window-panes of a carter’s eating-house. The man was refreshing himself inside, and the horses, their big heads lowered to the ground, fed out of nose-bags steadily. Farther on, {{on the opposite side}} of the street, another suspect patch of dim light issued from Mr Verloc’s shop front, hung with papers, heaving with vague piles of cardboard boxes and the shapes of books. The Assistant Commissioner stood observing it across the roadway. There could be no mistake. By the side of the front window, encumbered by the shadows of nondescript things, the door, standing ajar, let escape on the pavement a narrow, clear streak of gas-light within.|$|E
60|$|We {{entered the}} street of an old-fashioned, straggling town, the glimmering lights {{of which had}} been in sight for some time. De Cartienne, sitting forward a little, devoted his whole {{attention}} to the horses, for the stones were wet and slippery, and Brandy seemed to shy at everything and anything which presented itself, from the little pools of water glistening in the lamplight, which lay in the hollows of the road, down to his own shadow. I looked round curiously. The old-fashioned market-place, the quaintly built houses, <b>the</b> <b>dimly</b> <b>lit</b> shops, and little knots of gaping rustics, whom our rapid approach scattered right and left, were, at any rate, more interesting and pleasanter to look upon than the damp, miserable country outside. Suddenly we pulled up with a jerk outside a small, but clean-looking inn, and the groom leaped down from behind and {{made his way to the}} horses' heads.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{interior}} is <b>dimly</b> <b>lit</b> through domestic scaled casement windows with diamond patterned glazing bars and green glass. The only natural light that falls from above, illuminating the ceiling space, {{is through the}} stained glass windows behind the altar. The altar and altar screen positioned against the rear wall of the chancel are on a raised floor behind an ornamental timber rail. Rooms in the transepts contain disused rainwater tanks.|$|R
60|$|My {{interview}} {{with him was}} a very short one indeed. He led {{the way into the}} study in which I had first seen him and, closing the door, turned round and faced me upon the hearthrug. <b>The</b> room was <b>dimly</b> <b>lit,</b> but where he stood the fast-dying fire cast a faint glow around his tall, straight figure, and showed me a face cold and resolute as marble, but not unkind.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of {{a view of}} the cloister of Mission San Fernando looking west, ca. 1900. The {{colonnade}} of the cloister {{is shown}} to the left, with the doors to the monks' quarters shown at right. Each door is arched and cut into the adobe walls of the facility, as well as flanked by two bar-protected windows. What appears to be an amassment of furniture or machinery is seen at the end of <b>the</b> corridor, <b>dimly</b> <b>lit</b> just before <b>the</b> terminal arch opens out {{to the rest of the}} mission. A winding dirt path can be seen cutting its way through grass just outside the colonnade...|$|R
