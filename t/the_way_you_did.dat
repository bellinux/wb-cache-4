I wanted you to behave nicely to Mrs. Lynde, and instead of that you have disgraced me. I'm sure I don't know why you should lose your temper like that just because Mrs. Lynde said you were red-haired and homely. You say it {{yourself}} often enough." ...|$|E

[...] "Though they don't seem to have done so bad by you," [...] he added, in recognition of Marcia's merit. [...] "I should say that was the biggest part of your luck She's a lady, sir, every inch of her. Mighty different stripe from that Montreal woman that cut up so that night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never ye mind, pard," [...] said Allen confidentially. [...] "I'll set 'em both right.

But I reckon I won't be keepin' YOU from your work any longer. And look yar!--I say, pard!--this is seein' life in 'Frisco--ain't it? Gosh! I've had more high times in this very shop in two days, than I've had in two years of St. Jo. So long, Mr. Kane!" [...] He waved his hand, lounged slowly out of the shop, gave a parting glance up the street, passed the window, and was gone.|$|E
6000|$|... "Everybody {{who sees}} you falls a victim, Cynthia," [...] he went on; [...] "Mrs. Duncan and Janet lost their hearts. You {{ought to have}} heard them praising you at breakfast." [...] He paused abruptly, {{thinking}} {{of the rest of}} that conversation, and laughed. Bob seemed fated to commit himself that day.
