She was not yet out of her teens. After seeing her perform in their Galaţi premiere, her mother objected to her unmarried daughter cavorting on a stage like that. Goldstein who, unlike Goldfaden and Grodner, was single promptly married her and she remained with the troupe. (Besides being known as Sara Segal and Sofia Goldstein, she became best known as Sofia Karp, after a second marriage to actor Max Karp.) ...|$|E

Elizabeth Peale died when Franklin was eight years old, but his father soon remarried, and the child was thereafter cared for by his stepmother. [...] He was given little classroom education, though he did spend some time at a local school in nearby Bucks County, {{as well as at}} Germantown Academy and the University of Pennsylvania. [...] For the most part, his education was informal, as was usual in the Peale family, with the student given the means to study what interested him, or what he appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>at.</b> [...] In Franklin Peale's case, he made toys as a boy, and surveyed his father's farm near Germantown. Although he lacked the artistic talent of some of his brothers, such as Titian Peale, he proved mechanically inclined.|$|E

It is often said that a match is won or lost in midfield, meaning that whichever team dominates the middle area of the pitch is able to dictate the game. A central midfielder {{is expected to have}} good vision, be adept at long and short passing and have great stamina because of the ground they cover in a game.

Entrepreneurs tend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> perceiving new business opportunities and they often exhibit positive biases in their perception (i.e., a bias towards finding new possibilities and seeing unmet market needs) and a pro-risk-taking attitude that makes them more likely to exploit the opportunity.

Entrepreneurs act as managers and oversee the launch and growth of an enterprise.
