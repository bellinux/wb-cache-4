5|$|After this experience, Commissioner Gary Bettman stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>League</b> {{would like}} {{more time to}} prepare {{the site for the}} next outdoor game. He also wanted to ensure that not too many outdoor games are held so the event can remain special.|$|E
5|$|The League hereby {{acknowledges}} {{itself to}} be bound to the Trustees in the sum of One Thousand Dollars, which bond is conditioned upon the safe return of the Stanley Cup to the Trustees {{in accordance with the}} terms of this Agreement, and it is agreed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>League</b> shall have the right to return the trophy to the Trustees at any time.|$|E
5|$|The {{onset of}} the Second World War {{demonstrated}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>League</b> had failed in its primary purpose, the prevention of another world war. There were {{a variety of reasons}} for this failure, many connected to general weaknesses within the organisation. Additionally, the power of the League was limited by the United States' refusal to join.|$|E
50|$|These seven Clubs can be {{considered}} as the founder members of <b>the</b> <b>League</b> and games commenced {{at the outset of the}} 1894-95 season. It was not until 1906 <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>League's</b> current name first appeared.|$|R
50|$|The 2017 {{season was}} the last one headed by {{commissioner}} David Gross. It was announced on December 23, 2016 <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>league's</b> commissioner since 2004 would be stepping down.|$|R
50|$|In November 2016, NEO Roller Derby and Rubber City Rollergirls {{announced}} on their social media pages, {{in a statement}} confirmed by a new, mutual website, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>leagues</b> had merged to become Akron Roller Derby.|$|R
5|$|After {{some notable}} successes and some early {{failures}} in the 1920s, the League ultimately proved incapable of preventing aggression by the Axis powers in the 1930s. The credibility of the organization was somewhat weakened {{by the fact that}} the United States never officially joined the League and the Soviet Union joined late and only briefly. Germany withdrew from the League, as did Japan, Italy, Spain, and others. The onset of the Second World War showed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>League</b> had failed its primary purpose, which was to prevent any future world war. The League lasted for 26 years; the United Nations (UN) replaced it after the end of the Second World War and inherited several agencies and organisations founded by the League.|$|E
5|$|Aratus took {{advantage}} of this incident, and began plotting against Cleomenes with King Antigonus III Doson of Macedon. Previously, in 227 BC, two ambassadors from Megalopolis {{had been sent to}} Macedon to request help. Antigonus showed little interest at the time, and these efforts failed. Aratus wanted the Macedonian king to come to the Peloponnese and defeat Cleomenes, but Antigonus asked control of Acrocorinth in return. This was a sacrifice <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>League</b> was not willing to make, however, and they declined to seek help from Macedon.|$|E
5|$|Corporate {{support for}} the Heritage Classic {{exceeded}} expectations; Chief Operating Officer John Collins announced <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>league</b> had gained more sponsorship revenue for Calgary's game than it had the Winter Classic. While the league would not commit to holding a third Heritage Classic, Collins admitted that nearly every team had expressed interest in holding their own game and that title sponsor Tim Hortons had signed a multi-year deal with the league.|$|E
5000|$|It was {{the first}} and only time until Super Bowl XLVIII in Super Bowl history <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>league's</b> number one-ranked offense (Raiders) was pitted against <b>the</b> <b>league's</b> number one-ranked defense (Buccaneers). Super Bowl XXXVII is also {{referred}} to as the [...] "Pirate Bowl", due to both teams' pirate-themed names.|$|R
50|$|On 24 May 2013, the six PBL teams {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> two <b>leagues</b> {{would cease}} interleague play, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>leagues</b> would hold separate playoffs. In {{the first round}} of the PBL playoffs, the Bloomington Flex beat the Indiana Diesels two games to none, and the Rochester RazorSharks beat the Sauk Valley Predators two games to none. In the finals, the Flex beat the RazorSharks two games to none to win their second consecutive title.|$|R
25|$|Pappas wrote prolifically about {{baseball}} economics, analyzing and debunking what he perceived as false information spread by Major League Baseball and sympathetic media outlets. He railed against claims by Commissioner Bud Selig <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>league's</b> teams were in dire financial straits, using <b>the</b> <b>league's</b> own data to refute the claims.|$|R
5|$|Gil Stein, {{president}} of the NHL, indicated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>league</b> would not take disciplinary action against Aubut, and the Rangers did not challenge the arbitrator's decision. Stein further stated that as of August 1, all trades needed to be confirmed with the league office by all involved parties before they would be considered consummated. Lindros signed a five-year contract with the Flyers worth an estimated $24million. As a rookie, he earned $2million, while Gretzky, with the largest NHL contract, earned $3million. Lindros did not accompany the Flyers to Quebec for an exhibition game prior to the 1992–93 season due to concern about the reception he would receive. Hextall and Ricci initially {{did not want to}} report to Quebec, but relented.|$|E
5|$|In September 2013, Sayers {{reportedly}} {{sued the}} NFL, claiming the league negligently handled his repeated head injuries during his career. The lawsuit claimed Sayers suffered headaches and short-term memory loss since retirement. It stated he was sometimes sent back into games after suffering concussions, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>league</b> {{did not do}} enough to protect him. The case was withdrawn after Sayers claimed it was filed without his permission, but he filed a new lawsuit in January 2014 along with six other former players.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} two years, Jinnah worked to build support among Muslims for the League. He secured {{the right to speak}} for the Muslim-led Bengali and Punjabi provincial {{government}}s in the central government in New Delhi ("the centre"). He worked to expand the League, reducing the cost of membership to two annas (⅛ of a rupee), half of what it cost to join the Congress. He restructured the League {{along the lines of the}} Congress, putting most power in a Working Committee, which he appointed. By December 1939, Liaquat estimated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>League</b> had three million two-anna members.|$|E
5000|$|For {{this year}} only, the Super Bowl {{decided not to}} use a Roman numeral ("L") and instead used the {{standard}} numeral [...] "50". According to Jaime Weston, <b>the</b> <b>league's</b> vice president of brand and creative, the primary reason was <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>league's</b> graphic designers had difficulty designing a suitable, aesthetically pleasing logo with only the Roman numeral [...] "L".|$|R
5000|$|The Trouser Press Record Guide {{described}} <b>the</b> <b>League</b> of Gentlemen's {{music as}} typically taking [...] "a simple medium-to-fast backbeat over which Fripp and Andrews locked horns, with melodic development emerging slowly, surely, subtly." [...] Trouser Press also suggests <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>League's</b> foray into dance oriented rock was {{a precursor to}} Fripp's reformed King Crimson in the early 1980s.|$|R
50|$|There was no {{umbrella}} {{campaign in}} 2001, no season launch gala ad. NRL Marketing Director, Mark Wallace insisted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>League's</b> marketing budget {{remained the same}} as in prior years but <b>that</b> <b>the</b> focus was to be on promoting individual games and complementing the clubs' own marketing activities.|$|R
5|$|Liverpool and Chelsea {{had faced}} each other twice during the season, with Liverpool winning on both occasions. Liverpool won the first meeting in the 2011–12 Premier League 2–1, they won their second meeting in the 2011–12 Football League Cup 2–0, before winning the final against Cardiff City. As Liverpool and Chelsea had been due to play {{one another in the}} Premier League at Anfield on 5 May 2012, the same day as the final, the FA {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>league</b> game would be postponed until Tuesday 8 May, meaning that the two sides would play each other twice in four days.|$|E
5|$|On 10 December 1936, Álvarez put the Republic's {{case to the}} League of Nations, further {{demanding}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>League</b> condemn Italy's and Germany's {{decision to}} recognise the Nationalists. He pointed {{to the risk of}} the Spanish war spreading, and suggested that the Non-Intervention Committee was ineffective. This charge was denied by Lord Cranborne and Édouard Viénot, the British and French representatives respectively, who appealed to the League to endorse the mediation plan. The League condemned intervention, urged its council's members to support non-intervention, and commended mediation. It then closed discussion on Spain, leaving it to the Committee. The mediation plan, however, was soon dropped. Britain and France continued to consider, and put forward, plans to prevent foreign volunteers, outside of the Committee.|$|E
5|$|The Flames were {{inundated}} with complaints from season ticket holders upset by their seat assignments {{and the cost}} of tickets. King responded to the concerns by noting <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>league</b> had purchased the game from the Flames, and the team was given a limited allotment of seats for its ticket holders. He also noted that it was possible that the event would lose money, even at ticket prices ranging between $49 and $249, but that the team brought the Heritage Classic to Calgary because the fans wanted the game to return to Canada. The Pittsburgh Penguins and Buffalo Sabres encountered similar issues allocating tickets for the Winter Classic.|$|E
50|$|The new {{influx of}} talented young players showed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>league's</b> {{longevity}} gave young girls something to aspire to. Rookies coming into <b>the</b> <b>league</b> had <b>the</b> luxury {{of growing up}} watching veterans like Cynthia Cooper, Lisa Leslie and Teresa Weatherspoon. For the first time ever, young girls could now look at the WNBA {{as an opportunity for}} basketball to continue after college.|$|R
50|$|Barclay {{and other}} members of his cabinet objected to the {{proposed}} conditions on <b>the</b> grounds <b>that</b> they would infringe upon the sovereignty of Liberia. For example, one of the conditions would have required <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>League's</b> delegates be placed in key positions within the Liberian government.|$|R
5000|$|With {{a strong}} Christian {{expression}} in its beginnings, <b>the</b> <b>leagues</b> grew as {{an answer to}} the old problem of the land and its exploitation. <b>The</b> activities <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>leagues</b> were linked to centered in the communitarian work like [...] "mingas" [...] and in the instruction and formation of the agrarian workers. They also had [...] "communitarian schools" [...] <b>that</b> used <b>the</b> popular education method of Paulo Freire.|$|R
5|$|The Heritage Classic {{was played}} {{two months after}} the 2011 Winter Classic. NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman stated the Winter Classic is {{designed}} for American television and to promote the game in the United States, but <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>league</b> sought to hold another game for its Canadian partners. He said the league delayed on hosting a second outdoor game until it felt it was capable of holding three significant events in a two-month span, including the All-Star Game.|$|E
5|$|The main {{criticism}} levelled at the EIHL is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>league</b> is too expensive, {{an accusation}} given credence {{by the collapse}} of the London Racers mid season in 2005, and the continued financial problems experienced by a number of other member clubs (most notably Basingstoke Bison and Manchester Phoenix in 2008–09). Both the Edinburgh Capitals and Newcastle Vipers made public statements about their potentially perilous financial situations, casting further doubt over both their own, and the league's sustained viability.|$|E
5|$|When the Columbian Baseball League was {{forming in}} 1912, The New York Times named Shay {{as one of}} two {{candidates}} to manage the league's Kansas City team. The {{president of the new}} league, John T. Powers, said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>league</b> would not serve as a third major league, but he noted that many players were eager to sign with the league after their contracts had expired in 1911. The league never materialized. One of its main investors, brewer Otto Stifel, withdrew his support of the league before play began.|$|E
50|$|In {{the second}} half of 1978 suspicions were raised <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Waz <b>League</b> had {{infiltrated}} Seded and come to occupy leading posts in Seded, leading to a break with <b>the</b> Waz <b>League</b> as well. It was, however, unlikely <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Waz <b>League</b> {{would have been able to}} penetrate the inner circle of military leaders of Seded. In 1979, Seded was legally disbanded.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>League</b> App, Inc. {{was founded}} in 2014 by Amanda Bradford, who also serves as its CEO. She {{conceived}} this an exclusive dating app after growing frustrated with her own online dating experience. Bradford has stated <b>that</b> <b>The</b> <b>League's</b> market lies between traditional, marriage-focused dating apps like eHarmony and simple location-aware apps like Tinder. A primary focus of <b>The</b> <b>League</b> app is helping women find partners who are compatible with their professional goals.|$|R
50|$|In 2012 it was {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> FFSA Super <b>League</b> would become defunct and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> second tier <b>league</b> named FFSA Premier <b>League</b> would become <b>the</b> top tier of South Australian football. It was decided <b>that</b> <b>the</b> new Premier <b>League</b> would consist of 14 teams. All 10 clubs from <b>the</b> Super <b>League</b> and <b>the</b> 4 top placed sides from <b>the</b> 2012 Premier <b>League</b> table would make up the new competition.|$|R
5|$|By 2004, {{the owners}} were {{claiming}} that player salaries had grown far faster than revenues, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>league</b> {{as a whole}} lost over US$300 million in 2002–03. As a result, on September 15, 2004 Gary Bettman announced that the owners again locked the players out {{before the start of}} the 2004–05 season. On February 16, 2005, Bettman announced the cancellation of the entire season. As with the 1994–95 lockout, the owners were again demanding a salary cap, which the players were unwilling to consider until the season was on the verge of being lost. The season's cancellation led to a revolt within the union. NHLPA president Trevor Linden and senior director Ted Saskin took charge of negotiations from executive director Bob Goodenow. By early July, the two sides had agreed to a new collective bargaining agreement. The deal featured a hard salary cap, linked to a fixed percentage of league revenues and a 24% rollback on salaries.|$|E
5|$|Derek Fisher succeeded Ewing as NBPA {{president}} in 2006. In early 2011, negotiations {{on a new}} CBA began. The league claimed that it was losing $300 million a year (22 out of 30 teams were losing money last season) and proposed to reduce 40% of players' salary (about $800 million) and institute a hard salary cap (at $45 million per team) {{as opposed to a}} soft cap (at $58 million) currently in use. The union disputed those figures and steadfastly opposed those changes. Hunter said that he was advising players to prepare for a lockout. In May 2011, the NBPA {{filed a complaint with the}} National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), accusing the league of negotiating in bad faith by failing to provide critical financial data to the union and repeatedly threatening to lock out players. The NBA quickly rejected the complaint, saying <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>league</b> complies fully with federal labor laws. The union also considered the option of decertification, which allows players to file an antitrust lawsuit against the NBA.|$|E
5|$|Fourteen years later, Chill is freed in {{exchange}} for testifying against Gotham City mafia boss Carmine Falcone. Bruce intends to murder Chill, but one of Falcone's assassins does so first. Bruce's childhood friend, assistant district attorney Rachel Dawes, berates him for attempting to undermine the justice system, saying that his father would be ashamed. Bruce confronts Falcone, who tells him that real power comes from being feared. Bruce decides to travel the world {{and learn how to}} confront injustice. While serving a prison sentence for theft in Bhutan, he meets Henri Ducard, who trains him {{as a member of the}} League of Shadows, led by Ra's al Ghul. After completing his training and purging his fears, Bruce learns <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>League</b> intends to destroy Gotham, believing it to be corrupt, decadent, hypocritical and beyond saving. Bruce rejects the League's cause and burns down their temple during his escape. Ra's is killed by falling debris, while Bruce saves the unconscious Ducard.|$|E

50|$|Fraser is {{also known}} for his {{involvement}} in a 1997 antitrust lawsuit brought against Major <b>League</b> Soccer. <b>The</b> case alleged <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>league's</b> single entity structure, whereby all players are contracted to <b>the</b> <b>league</b> (and not to individual teams) was in fact an illegal monopoly.
