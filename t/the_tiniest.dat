He {{believed}} that by using horizon astronomy, observers could make estimates of dates in the year to a specific day. The observation required finding a place where on a specific date the sun set into a notch on the horizon. A common theme is a mountain which blocked the Sun, but on the right day would allow <b>the</b> <b>tiniest</b> fraction to re-emerge {{on the other side}} for a 'double sunset'. The animation below shows two sunsets at a hypothetical site, one the day before the summer solstice and one at the summer solstice, which has a double sunset.|$|E

His 41-run partnership with Bell steadied things somewhat, and there were hopes among England fans that Bell would make his first significant score against the tourists.

25|$|For much of history, {{the modern}} {{understanding}} of extinction {{as the end}} of a species was incompatible with the prevailing worldview. Through the 18th century, much of Western society adhered to the belief that the world was created by God and as such was complete and perfect. This concept reached its heyday in the 1700s with the peak popularity of a theological concept called the Great Chain of Being, in which all life on earth, from <b>the</b> <b>tiniest</b> microorganism to God, is linked in a continuous chain. The extinction of a species was impossible under this model, as it would create gaps or missing links in the chain and destroy the natural order. Thomas Jefferson was a firm supporter of the Great Chain of Being and an opponent of extinction, famously denying the extinction of the wooly mammoth on the grounds that nature never allows a race of animals to become extinct.|$|E

500|$|The writing {{staff was}} {{looking for a way to}} end the episode and {{executive}} producer Sam Simon suggested that they watch the film The Quiet Man. The writers came in on a Saturday to watch the film together. They were inspired by the film's fight scene between John Wayne and Victor McLaglen's characters to do a fight scene between Homer and Tom in the episode. The scene was difficult for the producers to sound-mix because they wanted it to be funny but not horrifying. They discovered that the more realistic the effects used sounded, the funnier the scene became. The producers tried all sorts of different sounds for when Homer cracks his back on the fire hydrant and chose <b>the</b> <b>tiniest</b> realistic sound, because they believed that it was the most painful and [...] "hilarious".|$|E

[...] According to Down Beat, the frantic burbles of congas on [...] "Moja" [...] and [...] "Tatu" [...] predated oldschool jungle by 20 years, while Spin journalist Erik Davis found its anguished, ferocious music extremely impressive, especially when listened to loud.

[...] Packaging Girlhood: Rescuing Our Daughters from Marketers' Schemes Sharon Lamb was concerned that younger listeners would not understand the irony intended by the song's lyrics about women and take them seriously.

500|$|Mark Mangini {{served as}} The Voyage Homes sound designer. He {{described}} it as different from working on many other films because Nimoy appreciated the role of sound effects and made sure that they were prominent in the film. Since many sounds familiar to Star Trek had been established—the Bird-of-Prey's cloaking device, the transporter beam, et al.—Mangini focused on making only small changes to them. The most important sounds were those of the whales and the probe. Mangini's brother lived near biologist Roger Payne, who had recordings of whale song. Mangini went through the tapes and chose sounds that could be mixed to suggest conversation and language. The probe's screeching calls were the whale song in distorted form. The humpback's communication with the probe at {{the climax of the}} film contained no dramatic music, meaning that Mangini's sounds had to stand alone. He recalled that he had difficulty with envisioning how the scene would unfold, leading Bennett to perform a puppet show to explain. Nimoy and the other producers were unhappy with Mangini's attempts to create the probe's droning operating noise; after more than a dozen attempts, the sound designer finally asked Nimoy what he thought the probe should sound like. Mangini recorded Nimoy's guttural [...] "wub-wub-wub" [...] response, distorted it with [...] "just <b>the</b> <b>tiniest</b> bit of dressing", and used it as the final sound.|$|E

[...] He also said that [...] "while it lags <b>the</b> <b>tiniest</b> bit {{on its way to the}} conclusion, the script... really delivers; it offers characters to care about, along with some nifty twists and surprises along the way." [...] Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter observed Frozen as a true musical and wrote, [...] "You can practically see the Broadway musical Frozen is destined to become while watching Disney's 3D animated princess tale." [...] McCarthy described the film as [...] "energetic, humorous and not too cloying, as well as the first Hollywood film in many years to warn of global cooling rather than warming, this tuneful toon upgrades what has been a lackluster year for big studio animated fare and, beginning with its Thanksgiving opening, should live up to box office expectations as one of the studio's hoped-for holiday-spanning blockbusters." [...] Kyle Smith of the New York Post awarded the film 3.5 out of 4 stars and praised the film as [...] "a great big snowy pleasure with an emotionally gripping core, brilliant Broadway-style songs and a crafty plot. Its first and third acts are better than the jokey middle, but this is the rare example of a Walt Disney Animation Studios effort that reaches as deep as a Pixar film."

Even the slightest goofiness, <b>the</b> <b>tiniest</b> touch of camp, and the whole thing would blow sky high. But it doesn't." [...] He criticized the aliens, which he said [...] "don't rate as characters", existing as [...] "moving blobs you shoot at in a video game." [...] Varietys Peter Debruge echoed Honeycutt's sentiments that the [...] "potential hamminess" [...] of the premise is offset by the cast, particularly Craig through a [...] "mix of ruthlessness and sensitivity." [...] He considered however, that Wilde had the opposite effect, stating she [...] "appears out of place among her grizzled co-stars". Debruge appreciated the attention paid to the roots of the two genres, saying [...] "beneath all the state-of-the-art special effects beats an old-fashioned heart, one that prizes both of the genres in play" [...] and concluded that [...] "a canny blend of CG and practical effects serve the sci-fi elements well, while location shooting and Mary Zophres' form-fitting period duds make the West look its best."
