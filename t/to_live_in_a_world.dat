5|$|For the actress, having Chloe {{become part}} of the meteor {{infected}} community in season six allowed Mack's character to continue to evolve. Mack views this transition as a means for her character to become more emotionally connected to those people—the meteor infected—she spent five seasons trying to expose to the public. Being infected by the meteors gives Chloe motivation to try to understand them and allows her to grow closer to Clark, as she can better understand what it feels like <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> where you have a special ability. Writer Holly Harold believes that, in addition to being infected by the meteor rocks, bringing Lois into the journalistic field also provides Chloe with a lot of ammunition for growth and development. Lois's presence at the Daily Planet allows Chloe the chance to reflect upon herself, and discover what things are most important to her – her career or her family and friends. The competition that Lois provides is beneficial, as it gives Chloe a chance to {{bring out the best in}} herself.|$|E
5|$|Redfield and Alomar {{board the}} tanker and {{encounter}} Gionne, who escapes after dropping {{a case of}} syringes; Alomar keeps several. When Redfield and Alomar reach the main deck, Wesker announces over the ship's intercom that he has betrayed Gionne and infected her with Uroboros. She mutates into a giant monster, which Redfield and Alomar defeat. Valentine radios in, telling Redfield and Alomar that Wesker must take precise, regular doses of a virus to maintain his strength and speed; a larger or smaller dose would poison him. Alomar realizes that Gionne's syringes are doses of the drug. Redfield and Alomar follow Wesker to a bomber loaded with missiles containing the Uroboros virus, injecting him with the syringes Gionne dropped. Wesker tries to escape on the bomber; Redfield and Alomar disable it, making him crash-land in a volcano. Furious‚ Wesker exposes himself to Uroboros and chases Redfield and Alomar through the volcano. They fight him, and the weakened Wesker falls into the lava before Redfield and Alomar are rescued by a helicopter, which is piloted by Valentine and Stone. As a dying Wesker attempts to drag the helicopter into the volcano, Redfield and Alomar fire rocket-propelled grenades at Wesker, killing him. In the game's final cutscene, Redfield wonders if the world is worth fighting for. Looking at Alomar and Valentine, he decides <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> without fear.|$|E

There are, however, major changes in the ideology of Spira's people. After Sin's defeat came the arrival of an era known as [...] "the Eternal Calm".

500|$|... "At Long Last Leave" [...] has {{received}} generally positive reviews from television critics, [...] particularly for its couch gag in the Simpsons opening sequence. This couch gag features a frame-by-frame montage of previous couch gags that pulls {{back into a}} photomosaic of the number [...] "500". The A.V. Club critic Hayden Childs wrote that the [...] "best thing about the 500th Simpsons episode is the opening couch montage, which hits the nostalgia bullseye almost perfectly." [...] HitFix's Alan Sepinwall praised the couch gag as being [...] "marvelous", noting that it [...] "actually made me choke up a bit." [...] Sepinwall commended [...] "At Long Last Leave", commenting that [...] "like many latter-day Simpsons outings, [...] features a story we've seen variations on several times before (including in The Simpsons Movie), but also features many funny jokes that affirm my belief that I'm happier <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> that keeps giving us new Simpsons episodes [...] than I {{will be in the}} one where that inevitably stops."

While her origins are never elaborated upon of which version she's based on, the show's creators have confirmed she {{is intended to be}} Carol Ferris. In the episode [...] "Injustice For All", Star Sapphire is invited to join Lex Luthor's Injustice Gang to plot the destruction of the Justice League. She is initially repelled by the idea of working with [...] "common criminals" [...] but seems to warm to {{the amount of money that}} Luthor promises each of them (which also keeps her from quitting after their initial plan fails). In the Injustice Gang's final battle with the Justice League, she is defeated by Green Lantern.

[...] While aligned with this Injustice Gang, she successfully tricks Wonder Woman and Hawkgirl into believing that she still wants <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> with men by luring the two women into a trap that subdues both them and Hippolyta. Later on, she and Aresia, along with Tsukuri, flee with Hippolyta aboard Aresia's plane.

2500|$|... (2013), is a {{video game}} and tie-in comic book {{depicting}} {{a world in which}} Superman presides over an authoritarian regime. In an alternate universe Superman is married to Lois Lane, who becomes pregnant with his child. However, the Joker tricks Superman into killing Lois and their unborn son, which leads to the destruction of Metropolis (as there was a nuke located on Lois' heart that went off the moment her heart stopped beating). Driven over the edge by this, Superman kills the Joker in retaliation. Now corrupted, Superman takes drastic measures to [...] "save" [...] the world, forcing people to follow his will and killing those who resist. Many Justice League members join Superman's cause, though a few (such as Shazam and the Flash) are not as easily swayed. Batman sees the tyranny in this and created a group—the Insurgency—that is bent on stopping the new Regime. While Superman is able to achieve peace throughout the planet, he comes across obstacles other than the Insurgency: in Year Two the Green Lantern Corps try to overthrow him, causing him to develop a partnership with Sinestro. He pulls through after acquiring a Qwardian Power Ring to defeat the Corps. In Year Three he faces magic users—-magic being one of his few vulnerabilities. He is put into a magical sleep by Batman that leaves him trapped in a dream world of his own devices: the events that set him on his current path never took place, where he saved Lois and their unborn child. He imagines he and Lois go on to have a daughter named Lara Lane-Kent, a superhero in her own right, but is awoken by Ares, forcing him <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> where he has lost everything. His Regime and the Insurgency have a fight {{near the end of the}} Year, though their fray is put aside when Trigon and Mxyzptlk threaten to engulf them all with their fight. He and the others pull through after they and Doctor Fate are banished to another dimension. During the events of Year Four he finds the Greek Gods do not tolerate his actions, believing Superman is portraying himself as a false god. Superman eventually discovers that Ares and Darkseid are working together, so he confronts the latter and fights him to a standstill. He then goes on to confront Zeus, but the New God Highfather interrupts and convinces the Greek gods to permanently step down. Superman tries to capture Batman once more, but is convinced by Wonder Woman to focus on expanding his influence instead. The annual sees Superman placing the son of Plastic Man in an underwater maximum prison for captured super-villains called the Trench; when Plastic Man tries and fails to convince Superman to be lenient, he goes on to break into the prison and free all the villains and his son, destroying the Trench. The beginning of Year Five sees Superman simultaneously dealing with recapturing the villains and his obsession with finding Batman. He makes the controversial decision to employ villains like Bane and Killer Frost in the Regime for more help, much to the chargin of the others. This coupled with his more demanding personality puts him further at odds. When he discovers a group of people who oppose him and worship the Joker as a symbol, he finds them and kills over 200 innocent people in cold blood. He later sends serial killer Victor Zsasz after Alfred Pennyworth in an attempt to lure Batman out, though the plan fails when the Flash intervenes, causing Superman to lash out. Superman's brutality concerning the Jokers comes back to haunt him when Cyborg is abducted by the Insurgency, but Raven intervenes before the video can be leaked. Near the end of Year Five Catwoman reveals to Superman where the Insurgency is, and he Wonder Woman, and Hal go to confront him. Batman keeps them distracted as Batwoman and Batgirl work to bring over an alternate Justice League, succeeding and transporting the Regime across the world. After being defeated, the fallen Man of Steel is placed in a chamber that radiates red sun energy to negate his powers, though the final scene implies he may still have some degree of them.|$|E
