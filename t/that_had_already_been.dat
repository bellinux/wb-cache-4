5|$|Among {{the many}} {{technical}} {{challenges of the}} ion-deposition apparatus was obtaining a sufficiently high ion current (mass deposition rate) while simultaneously decelerating the ions so they could all deposit onto a target electrode embedded in a balance pan. Experiments with gold showed the ions had to be decelerated to very low energies to avoid sputtering effects—a phenomenon whereby ions <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>already</b> <b>been</b> counted ricochet off the target electrode or even dislodged atoms <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>already</b> <b>been</b> deposited. The deposited mass fraction in the 2003 German experiments only approached very close to 100% at ion energies of less than around 1eV (<1km/s for gold).|$|E

If this could happen, it was also possible that a force might attack where the Japanese were unexpectedly strong. Different levels of command sometimes came up with widely varying estimates of Japanese strength because they used different methods to estimate it.|$|E

5|$|In July 1940, Britain {{offered the}} United States {{access to its}} {{scientific}} research, and Cockcroft briefed American scientists on British nuclear weapons developments. He discovered that the American S-1 Project (later renamed the Manhattan Project) was smaller than the British, and not as far advanced. The two projects exchanged information, but did not initially combine their efforts, ostensibly over concerns about American security. Ironically, it was the British project <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>already</b> <b>been</b> penetrated by atomic spies for the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|Mullen {{is said to}} have a preternatural {{sense of}} rhythm. Brian Eno recounted that while working with Mullen on a U2 album, Mullen kept insisting that the click track was off and lagging behind the tracks <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>already</b> <b>been</b> recorded. Eno {{adjusted}} it, thinking that he was just humouring Mullen, but later found that Mullen was right and the click track had indeed been off by six milliseconds.|$|E

5|$|To {{give the}} series its own {{distinctive}} musical identity, according to Djawadi, the producers asked {{him not to}} use musical elements such as flutes or solo vocals <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>already</b> <b>been</b> successfully used by other major fantasy productions. He mentioned that a challenge in scoring the series was its reliance on dialogue and its sprawling cast: on several occasions already-scored music had to be omitted {{so as not to}} get in the way of dialogue.|$|E
5|$|Although {{named the}} Jersey Act by a {{critical}} foreign press, after Lord Jersey, the new regulation {{did not have}} the force of law as it was promulgated by the registration authorities of the Thoroughbred horse, not by the United Kingdom government. Nor was it promulgated by the Jockey Club, which had no authority over registration, only over racing matters. The regulation required that any horse registered in the General Stud Book trace in every line to a horse <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>already</b> <b>been</b> registered in the General Stud Book, effectively excluding most American-bred Thoroughbreds.|$|E
5|$|Bergonzoli {{knew that}} if Bardia and Tobruk held out, a British advance further into Libya {{eventually}} must falter under the logistical difficulties of maintaining a desert force using an extended overland supply line. Not knowing how long he had to hold out, Bergonzoli was forced to ration his stocks {{of food and water}} so that O'Connor could not simply starve him out. Consequently, hunger and thirst adversely affected the morale of the Italian defenders <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>already</b> <b>been</b> shaken by the defeat at Sidi Barrani. So too did medical conditions undermine morale, particularly lice and dysentery, the results of poor sanitation.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} 1906, most {{leaders from}} Azusa Street had spun off to form other congregations, such as the 51st Street Apostolic Faith Mission, the Spanish AFM, and the Italian Pentecostal Mission. These {{missions}} were largely composed of immigrant or ethnic groups. The Southeast United States was a particularly prolific area of growth for the movement, since Seymour's approach gave a useful explanation for a charismatic spiritual climate <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>already</b> <b>been</b> taking root in those areas. Other new missions were based on preachers who had charisma and energy. Nearly all of these new churches were founded among immigrants and the poor.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Jasmine {{affected}} fivecountries {{during its}} existence. The predecessor to Jasmine brought heavy rainfall to areas of extreme northern Queensland. Jasmine also brought rainfall to {{areas of the}} Solomon Islands. As a result, pest infestations occurred across the region. In Vanuatu, heavy rains and wind from Jasmine destroy numerous crops. Banana trees in particular {{are affected by the}} cyclone. Jasmine inundated areas of Tonga <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>already</b> <b>been</b> affected by Cyclone Cyril just a week prior. Nuku'alofa recorded half of its average monthly rainfall in a 24‑hour span due to rains associated with the cyclone. After the season, the name Jasmine was retired from the Australian list of tropical cyclone names.|$|E
5|$|During the 1950s, {{tensions}} arose {{between the}} ARF and Armenian SSR. The death of Catholicos Garegin of the Holy See of Cilicia prompted {{a struggle for}} succession. The National Ecclesiastic Assembly, which was largely influenced by the ARF, elected Zareh of Aleppo. This decision {{was rejected by the}} Echmiadzin-based Catholicos of All Armenians, the anti-ARF coalition, and Soviet Armenian authorities. Zareh extended his administrative authority over {{a large part of the}} Armenian diaspora, furthering the rift <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>already</b> <b>been</b> created by his election. This event split the large Armenian community of Lebanon, creating sporadic clashes between the supporters of Zareh and those who opposed his election.|$|E

5|$|Having earlier {{been led}} by Wing Commander Blake Pelly, by June 1943 No.73 Wing {{was under the}} command of Group Captain Ian McLachlan. That month, McLachlan {{established}} his headquarters at Goodenough Island, where the wing was reorganised as a fighter formation consisting of No.76 Squadron (flying P-40 Kittyhawks), No.77 Squadron (Kittyhawks) and No.79 Squadron (Supermarine Spitfires). As well as providing local air defence, and fighter escort for Australian bombers, the Kittyhawks were themselves armed with incendiary and general-purpose bombs so that they could engage in ground-attack missions, a practice <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>already</b> <b>been</b> employed by Commonwealth forces in the Mediterranean and Middle East Theatre.|$|E
5|$|However, not {{all forms}} of artwork along the highway were uncontroversial. In 1977, there were several {{complaints}} regarding new billboards that were installed at the northern terminus of the highway, since they blocked {{the view of the}} coast. In 1981, an illegal mural that was determined to be incomplete was discovered at the I-8 interchange; while Caltrans discouraged the painting of such murals, they were impressed with the portion <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>already</b> <b>been</b> completed. Art Cole, the artist, stepped forward to the department, and was allowed to finish the mural of a desert highland sunrise; following this, Caltrans made efforts to have other murals commissioned.|$|E
5|$|The British and Americans {{exchanged}} nuclear information, but did {{not initially}} combine their efforts. British officials did not reply to an August 1941 offer by Bush and Conant to create a combined British and American project. In November 1941, Frederick L. Hovde, {{the head of the}} London liaison office of OSRD, raised the issue of cooperation and exchange of information with Anderson and Lord Cherwell, who demurred, ostensibly over concerns about American security. Ironically, it was the British project <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>already</b> <b>been</b> penetrated by atomic spies for the Soviet Union.|$|E

This move was met with criticism from gaming news outlets, particularly as the advertisements almost doubled the loading time between levels, and while the game content loads at the same speed, the advert must finish playing before the race can begin. The adverts were removed soon after numerous complaints were made by players. In addition to the load time problems, there had been consternation about advertising being retroactively added into a game <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>already</b> <b>been</b> paid for.|$|E
5|$|The war-time {{deployment}} of the Territorial Army envisioned it being deployed piecemeal, to reinforce the regular army <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>already</b> <b>been</b> deployed to the European mainland, as equipment became available. The plan envisioned the {{deployment of}} the whole force in waves, as divisions completed their training, with the final divisions not being deployed until a year had elapsed from the outbreak of war. As a result, the division did not leave the United Kingdom as the British Expeditionary Force was evacuated from France during May and June 1940.|$|E
5|$|When the war ended, {{it was not}} {{expected}} that the inefficient Little Boy design would ever again be required, and many plans and diagrams were destroyed.

Faced {{with the prospect of}} no more plutonium for new cores and no more polonium for the initiators for the cores <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>already</b> <b>been</b> produced, Groves ordered that a number of Little Boys be prepared as an interim measure until a cure could be found. No Little Boy assemblies were available, and no comprehensive set of diagrams of the Little Boy could be found, although there were drawings of the various components, and stocks of spare parts.|$|E
