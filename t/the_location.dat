40|$|Abstract. Participants decided under speed stress {{whether or}} not the {{horizontal}} distances between pairs of frontal locations exceeded a criterion distance. The error rate reflected parallel effects of the horizontal and vertical distance between <b>the</b> <b>locations.</b> Whereas dimensional interaction in perceptual judgment has previously been attributed either to the perception of the stimulus or to the response decision concerning the stimulus, here dimensional interaction was attributed to the process of distance assessment regarding <b>the</b> test <b>locations.</b> Under <b>the</b> proposed account, the horizontal distance between <b>the</b> <b>locations</b> could not be assessed independently of the vertical distance. Only the overall distance between <b>the</b> <b>locations</b> could be assessed. However, because the horizontal and vertical positions of <b>the</b> <b>locations</b> could be independently assessed, the horizontal distance between <b>the</b> <b>locations</b> was available {{to the extent that the}} vertical positions of <b>the</b> <b>locations</b> were weighted so as to minimize vertical distance prior to the assessment of overall distance.
