5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Blossom</b> Festival is {{a summer}} music festival of orchestral music located at <b>the</b> <b>Blossom</b> Music Center in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio.

The festival's first season was in 1968 and it consisted of six weeks of concerts given by the Cleveland Orchestra intermingled with eight individual jazz/folk music concerts. George Szell conducted the first concert on July 19, 1968. [...] Since then the festival has been expanded to include ten weeks of orchestral music, most of which is still performed by the Cleveland Orchestra but also includes concerts by <b>the</b> festival's own <b>Blossom</b> Festival Orchestra. <b>The</b> <b>Blossom</b> Festival Orchestra {{is made up of}} free-lance musicians from the Cleveland area, mostly pulling from musicians of the Cleveland Pops Orchestra, Opera Cleveland Orchestra, or Apollo's Fire.

Plum blossoms were favored during the Nara period (710–794) until the emergence of the Heian period (794–1185) in which the cherry blossoms was preferred.|$|E

Its major fruit intake is from Zyziphus oenoplia, Vitex glabrata, Billy Goat Plum (Terminalia ferdinandiana), and Owenia vernicosa.

25|$|The plum blossom, {{which is}} known as the meihua (梅花), {{is one of the most}} beloved flowers in China and has been {{frequently}} depicted in Chinese art and poetry for centuries. The plum blossom is seen as a symbol of winter and a harbinger of spring. <b>The</b> <b>blossoms</b> are so beloved because they are viewed as blooming most vibrantly amidst the winter snow, exuding an ethereal elegance, while their fragrance is noticed to still subtly pervade the air at even the coldest times of the year. Therefore, the plum blossom came to symbolize perseverance and hope, as well as beauty, purity, and the transitoriness of life. In Confucianism, the plum blossom stands for the principles and values of virtue. More recently, it has also been used as a metaphor to symbolize revolutionary struggle since the turn of the 20th century.|$|E

The miter was the sign of the crown, which exalted the high priest above all earthly kings.|$|E
