40|$|Interest in {{modelling}} {{the total}} Urban Water Cycle is increasing, {{due to the}} realisation {{of the need for}} (high-level) flow integration to address issues of recycling, re-use and ultimately sustainability. Urban Water Cycle models are generally operating on a daily time step due to the inherent strategic/planning nature of such work. However, the choice of time step implies (more or less hidden) assumptions which may influence significantly the model’s performance. One such assumption – the way in which water tanks (e. g. rainwater, greywater, greenwater etc) are operated in terms of the sequence between <b>tank</b> <b>overflow</b> (spill) and water extracted from the tank for use (yield) is investigated in this paper. The two alternative sequences are termed here Yield After Spill (YAS) and Yield Before Spill (YBS). The Urban Water Optioneering Tool was used and advantages and disadvantages of these sequences were examined. The paper reviews the differences under a series of technological configurations and draws recommendations for modelling practice. It is suggested that YAS/YBS schemes have different impacts depending on the technological configuration of the case study under investigation, but that under normal operating conditions, daily time step simulations with YBS schemes tend to result in tank sizes that are (marginally) closer to sizes obtained by hourly time-steps. It is however suggested that YAS schemes should be preferred when the parameter of interest is runoff...|$|E

40|$|Diesel {{fuel oil}} (DFO) spills at fueling {{platforms}} increase railroad operating costs by decreasing the locomotive miles traveled per gallon of DFO dispensed {{and increasing the}} cost of recovering and treating spilled DFO. Pressure fluctuations in the fuel system can trigger inadvertent dispensing nozzle shut off before a locomotive fuel tank is full. Fuel tanks occasionally overflow after the automatic shut-off mechanism on a nozzle is disabled to prevent subsequent inadvertent nozzle shut off. A hydraulic pressure surge analysis of two fueling yards suggests a correlation between the magnitude of these pressure fluctuations {{and the amount of}} DFO lost from fuel tank overflows. For example, at a fueling yard with a history of high DFO spillage, system pressure fluctuations are predicted to be large enough to trigger inadvertent shut off and potential fuel <b>tank</b> <b>overflow</b> following closure of one nozzle. In contrast, at a fueling yard with a history of low DFO spillage, pressure fluctuations insufficient to cause inadvertent shut off and potential overflow are predicted following the simultaneous closure of up to four (4) nozzles.

This paper presents {{a case study of}} rainwater tank evaluation and design for large roof areas, located in Melbourne, Australia, based on observed daily rainfall data representing three different climatic regimes (i. e. dry average, and wet years). With the aim of developing a comprehensive Decision Support Tool for the performance analysis and design of rainwater tanks, a simple spreadsheet based daily water balance model is developed using daily rainfall data, contributing roof area, rainfall loss factor, available storage volume, <b>tank</b> <b>overflow</b> and irrigation water demand. In this case study, two (185 m 3 and 110 m 3) underground rainwater tanks are considered. Using the developed model, effectiveness of each tank under different climatic scenarios are assessed. The analysis shows that both the tanks are quite effective in wet and average years, however less effective in dry years. A payback period analysis of the tanks is preformed which reveals that the total construction cost of the tanks can be recovered within 15 - 21 years time depending on tank size, climatic conditions and future water price increase rates. For the tanks, a relationship between water price increase rates and payback periods is developed.

In order to assess reliability of domestic rainwater tanks in augmenting partial household water demand in Melbourne (Australia) area, the developed water balance model was used for three different climatic conditions (i. e. dry, average, and wet years). Historical daily rainfall data was collected from a rainfall station near Melbourne city central. From historical rainfall data three representative years (driest, average and wettest) were selected for the current analysis. Reliability is defined as percentage of days {{in a year when}} rainwater tank was able to supply the intended partial demand for a particular condition. For the three climatic conditions, several reliability charts are presented for domestic rainwater tanks in relations to tank volume, roof area, number of people in a house (i. e. water demand) and percentage of total water demand to be satisfied by harvested rainwater. In brief, for a two-people household scenario, - 100 % reliability can be achieved with a roof size of 150 - 300 m^ 2 having a tank size of 5000 - 10, 000 L.

Individually tagged vitellogenic females (n = 9 or 10) were treated {{at the beginning of the}} spawning season (March) with 20 μg/kg body weight (bw) GnRHa-loaded microspheres, a single injection of 20 μg/kg bw dissolved in saline, or physio- logical saline (control). Females were placed in tanks (one tank per treatment) connected to overflow egg collectors and monitored for 11 days. In addition to the eggs collected from the <b>tank</b> <b>overflow,</b> eggs were stripped from the fish on a daily basis. Only one spawn was obtained from the control fish, probably from a single female, given the small relative fecundity (700 eggs/kg bw). On the contrary, treatment with a GnRHa injection produced two spawns (9 and 11 days after treatment) and 50 % of the fish ovulated. Treatment with GnRHa microspheres induced seven spawns (3 and 6 - 11 days after treatment) and 100 % of the females ovulated. Females did not spawn all the eggs ovulated on a particular day, evident from the significant number of eggs obtained by manual stripping. Egg quality did not significantly differ among treatments, whereas number of spawned eggs and total relative fecundity were significantly higher in fish treated with GnRHa microspheres (ANOVA, p< 0. 05).

40|$|For the {{performance}} analysis {{and design of}} rainwater tanks, a simple spreadsheet based daily water balance model was developed using daily rainfall data, contributing roof area, rainfall loss factor, available storage volume, <b>tank</b> <b>overflow</b> and rainwater demand. This water balance model was then used to design an optimum size of domestic rainwater tank {{to be used for}} southwest Nigeria. The optimisation criterion was set to provide uninterrupted intended demand from the selected rainwater tank during the critical (dry) months. For the tank water, two demand scenarios were assessed: (i) toilet flushing only; and (ii) toilet flushing and laundry use. Analysis was performed for a typical dry year (1998) in southwest Nigeria. Current analysis outcomes were compared with an earlier analysis using monthly average rainfall data. It is found that analysis using monthly average rainfall data overestimates the required rainwater tank size. In addition, the newly developed model was used to assess the reliability of domestic rainwater tanks in augmenting partial household water demand. This analysis showed that a reliability of 100 % is possible to achieve with a tank size of 7000 L under low demand. However, with higher demand a bigger tank size (&# 8764; 10, 000 L) is required to achieve 100 % reliability even though very high reliability could also be attained with a tank size of 7000 L. From overflow analysis, {{the results of this study}} showed that a large quantity of water is lost as overflow, even in a dry year with a tank size of 10, 000 L. Thus, harvested rainwater could be used for other purposes if larger tanks are used as these would capture more of the excess rainwater which could then be tasked to other purposes without compromising the reliability of water availability for primary uses...|$|E

40|$|Majority of the {{investigations}} on rainwater harvesting focused on sizing and potential water savings including studies proposing different methods of estimating rainwater tank outcomes. Several studies used monthly rainfall data to estimate rainwater tank outcomes. However, quantification using daily rainfall {{data will be}} much more accurate compared to using monthly rainfall data. A vast majority of works using daily rainfall data used daily water balance model for analysis. Again most of the studies using daily water balance model used historical rainfall data, calculated water savings for many years and then presented an average of all the calculated years’ total outcome(s). ‘Raintank Analyser’ is a tool, which uses the same methodology and widely used; used by the South Australian policy makers for producing relevant design charts. In contrast, eTank, a daily water balance model was developed to produce potential rainwater savings, augmented townwater supply, <b>tank</b> <b>overflow,</b> reliability and payback period for three distinct climate conditions (dry, average and wet years). This paper presents comparison of eTank calculated potential water savings with those calculated by ‘Raintank Analyser’ under similar conditions for a rainfall station in central Adelaide. In general, ‘Raintank Analyser’ produced water savings are very close to the eTank calculated water savings in average year. However, through the eTank produced potential water savings in dry and wet years, it is found that significant climatic variations exist. Magnitudes of climatic variations under different scenario are presented. Again, to assess spatial variability, three more rainfall stations from different regions of Adelaide metropolitan were selected. eTank was used to calculated potential water savings in three climatic conditions (dry, average and wet years) for various combinations of roof and tank sizes. Again it is found that depending input variable conditions (tank size, roof area and climate) significant spatial variations exist within some of the regions. Also, it is found that potential water savings not only depends on total rainfall amount of a particular area, but also on other input conditions; i. e. under similar conditions an area with lower annual rainfall may provide higher water savings due to rainfall pattern...|$|E

Finally, semi-structured interviews with eight farmers and a farm advisor and discussions with three CFW designers in Scotland and Ireland allowed collection of technical and economic data on farm practices, CFW construction and maintenance, and helped assess CFW cost-effectiveness and acceptance by farmers. Both CFWs reduced pollutant concentrations between inlet and outlet, with efficiencies at CFW 1 and CFW 2 respectively of 87 % and < 0 % for five-day biochemical oxygen demand, 86 % and 83 % for suspended solids, 68 % and 26 % for nitrate/nitrite, 42 % and 34 % for ammonium, and 12 % and 31 % for reactive phosphorus. Nevertheless, the concentration of all pollutants at the outlet of CFW 1, and concentration of nitrate/nitrite at the outlet of CFW 2 frequently exceeded river water quality standards. Water treatment efficiency varied seasonally, being significantly lower in winter, mainly due to lower temperatures, increased volume of inputs and reduced residence time. The ecological value of the two CFWs differed greatly. At CFW 1 and CFW 2 respectively, 14 and 22 wetland plant species and 24 and 46 aquatic macroinvertebrate species (belonging to 13 and 27 BMWP scoring families respectively) were recorded, illustrating the greater biodiversity conservation value of CFW 2, which was one year older, larger, cleaner, comprised several ponds with a combination of open water and densely vegetated areas, and was subsequently more structurally diverse. The socio-economic study revealed that, despite significant costs associated with their construction (£ 20 000 -£ 50 000 ha- 1) and maintenance (£ 900 -£ 1500 ha- 1 yr- 1), CFWs may still represent a more cost-effective alternative than conventional methods. However, their adoption, implementation and sustainable use by farmers were conditioned by land availability and suitability, existing farm infrastructure, detailed information on limitations and maintenance requirements, and adequate financial support for both construction and aftercare. To ensure a long-term, consistent and efficient water treatment, and to enhance biodiversity and landscape, well-maintained, large, vegetated, multi-cell CFWs with shallow overflows are recommended. Their size should be adapted to local precipitation patterns and catchment characteristics.

30|$|Increasing {{demand for}} fresh potable water leads toward the {{requirement}} of different advance automatic water treatment solutions. Various water treatment solutions such as reverse osmosis (RO), microfiltration (MF), ultra-filtration (UF), nano-filtration (NF) have been explored by different researchers in the past, but RO {{is one of the}} leading water treatment solutions due to its higher water purification capacity, energy efficiency along with the capability to remove almost all toxic metals and bacteria from input water supply. The performance of RO membrane is quite sensitive and highly dependent on the quality of feed and overall plant conditions. So, RO plant needs highly accurate control and monitoring system to monitor the feed water and other plant parameters to maintain its operation close to optimum conditions. Regular maintenance of membrane and monitoring of feed water and plant parameters increase the productivity of RO plant and also reduce the chances of early membrane fouling which prolongs the life of the RO membrane and overall plant (Sobana and Rames 2011). Several control techniques such as PID (Esfahani et al. 2016), fuzzy (Zilouchian and Jafar 2001), ANN (Lee et al. 2009), optimal control (Gambier et al. 2006), predictive control (Abbas 2006) have been explored to control various RO plant parameters and maintain the plant in optimum conditions. Centralized PI controllers scheme for interfacing multivariable process has been also tried by different researchers for RO plant parameters control using synthesis method (Kumar et al. 2012). Selection of different techniques to tune the controller parameters is one of the important and challenging steps and needs to be selected based on the specific application. One of the famous techniques to tune controller parameters is the usage of compensators. Recycle compensator is one of the famous techniques to tune the controller parameters (Armbrust and Sbarbaro 2010). Minimization of RO plant energy consumption using optimal-based control (Bartman et al. 2010) along with alternative energy sources (Chaabene and Sellami 2013) for RO plants also has been introduced by different researchers. In Indian scenario, intelligent monitoring along with event prediction for RO plants is one of the essential needs to increase the life of RO membrane and also to avoid different problems such as over-/undervoltage fluctuations, dry run of high pressure and booster pumps, input water pipeline leakage, empty input water <b>tank,</b> <b>overflow</b> of output water tank. Different monitoring control tools along with efficient control strategy have been introduced for real-time monitoring and control of RO plants, but most of them are costly and bulky and predict only limited parameters such as water quality and flow rate (Torky et al. 2009). Few of the efforts also have been seen in the direction of real-time membrane fouling monitoring and early prediction using different analytical techniques (Hwang et al. 2010). Several efforts have been observed in the direction of RO plant parameters monitoring and control, but still, there are various challenges such as early fault prediction of different events such as overvoltage and undervoltage fluctuations, membrane fouling, membrane scaling, plant efficiency, water quality sensors damage which need to be addressed. Other than early fault prediction, predictive maintenance facility related to the membrane, sensors, filters maintenance for Indian RO plant operators is one of the essential needs to be tackled to increase the life of the overall plant and also maintain optimum operating conditions. The present work introduces an embedded RO plant status monitoring unit to monitor various plant parameters such as water quality (pH, TDS), input and output flow rate, input and output tank level, under- and overvoltage fluctuations along with the facility to predict different maintenance actions such as membrane water wash, membrane chemical wash, sensors calibration and cleaning, operation of RO plant. Other than this, a smartphone-based app interface also has been developed to acquire data from RO plant status monitoring unit using classical Bluetooth module and further transfer it to Google firebase cloud (Taherkordi and Frank 2016). An alternative data transfer scheme also has been implemented using 2 G GSM module during the unavailability of RO plant operator. Day by day RO plant parameters data also store at the local memory of the embedded system and can be collected using any USB drive. The rest of the manuscript is organized as follows. Section II provides a detailed description of the proposed RO plant status monitoring scheme, and section III provides details of the developed embedded system for RO plant status monitoring. Section IV consists of the detailed description of the development procedure of smartphone-based android application along with its features and utility.

Second part presents stormwater tanks and ATV-A 128 directives use for the dimensioning of stormwater <b>tanks</b> with <b>overflow.</b> Directives dictate procedure for determination of stormwater <b>tanks</b> with <b>overflow's</b> necessary storage volume. They {{require a lot of}} initial data which are need to be preliminary analysed. Necessary storage volume is determined by annual loading in overflow discharges into lakes or rivers. Concentracions of pollutants have to be within certain allowable limits. Third part of theme is a practical example. The sewage system of Šalek Valley has 30 stormwater overflows which discharge combined wastewater into lake and rivers. First flush of stormwater which is the most polluted, is need to be retained and fully conveyed to the treatment plant. The aformentioned drainage system does not include any of stormwater tanks which could perform these task. Therefore have I foresaw stormwater tanks in region Velenje – Šoštanj and determined theirs necessary storage volumes with the use of ATV guidelines and SWMM. I have made an outline scheme of stormwater <b>tank</b> with <b>overflow</b> Šalek II which could retain first flush of stormwater from the most part of the Gorica settlement between and after the percipitation event...|$|R
5|$|Two homes {{along the}} Mamee River in Saint Andrew Parish were swept away while other {{residents}} in mountainous {{areas of the}} parish were stranded by landslides. Multiple residents became trapped within Gordon Town and hazardous weather hampered their rescue. A bridge in Mahoneyvale was destroyed. During the pre-dawn hours of July9, the Annotto, Pencar, and Motherford rivers burst their banks in Saint Mary Parish; more than 500people relocated from their homes in Annotto Bay. Flooding took place across much of Saint Catherine Parish with eight people requiring rescue. The Cobrun Gully submerged several homes in Bushy Park. Eastern areas of Clarendon Parish experienced significant flooding, with several communities cut-off or inundated. A sink hole in Halse Hall engulfed 35homes. An oil <b>tank</b> <b>overflowed</b> due to heavy rain at a Petrojam Refinery in Kingston Harbour resulting in a minor oil spill. Petrojam crews cleaned the spill within a day. Some streets in downtown Kingston were flooded. Effects in Trelawny Parish were relatively limited, with J$16million (US$259,000) in agricultural damage.|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} {{rainwater}} systems to emulate pre-urban initial rainfall losses and restore catchment baseflow is investigated in Brisbane, Canberra and Melbourne, using low, medium and high rainwater demand scenarios, and adopting three 5 kL rainwater system configurations of: 1) Conventional; 2) Leaking - a fixed 1. 25 kL leaking compartment; and 3) Adaptive rainwater diversion (ARD) - a variable leaking compartment responding {{to change in}} rainfall and rainwater demand. Baseflow is restored by leaking rainwater {{at the rate of}} 240 L/day. Storm initial loss is the sum of rainfall from the start of an event until the <b>tank</b> <b>overflows.</b> Results show the ARD system provides superior initial loss emulation, reduced mean annual overflow and increased baseflow, under the low demand scenario. Leaking and ARD systems provide similar results under the high demand scenario. However, the ARD system is recommended as rainwater demand can change with occupant water use habits. These stormwater management outcomes can potentially create an avenue for retrofitting WSUD in urban catchments and improving urban stream health, without duplicating or redesigning municipal services, and while maintaining an alternate water supply. ...|$|R

5000|$|It was {{intentionally}} grounded on a sandbar {{to prevent}} further sinking. All passengers were evacuated by crew members and local tender operators. No lives were lost. The grounding breached two of the ships diesel fuel <b>tanks</b> and an <b>overflow</b> <b>tank</b> causing a small fuel spill of approximately 100 gal. There was also severe damage to the ship. A joint investigation by the Norwegian Maritime Investigator and the United States Coast Guard found that the accident was due to [...] "…a myriad of human performance deficiencies." [...] Reports also indicate that navigation out of the port was done visually rather than using of electronic navigation and that the relocation of a vital buoy was not reflected on charts.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} pulsatile {{pulmonary}} flow after the modified Fontan procedure was examined {{in a model}} that simulated the right heart. An inlet <b>overflow</b> <b>tank</b> (preload), axial pulsatile pump, Wind-Kessel model (afterload), and an outlet <b>overflow</b> <b>tank</b> were connected in series. The standard conditions were flow 2. 00 l/min with 12 mm Hg preload pressure, 3. 0 Wood units resistance, and an outlet <b>overflow</b> <b>tank</b> pressure at 6 mm Hg. The pump rate was set at 80 beats/min. The simulated pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary flow waves produced by this model closely resembled those obtained from patients who had undergone the modified Fontan procedure. All variables except the preload were fixed and changes in pulmonary flow were examined at preload pressures of 8, 12, 15, and 17 mm Hg. As the peak pulmonary arterial pressure increased so did pulmonary flow, until it was greater than during the non-pulsatile state. Because the afterload of this model was fixed, this result suggests {{that there was a}} concomitant decrease in resistance. This model indicates that pulsatile pulmonary blood flow is likely to have a beneficial effect on the pulmonary circulation after the modified Fontan procedure...|$|R
50|$|Another clever {{design feature}} of the Type 41 {{was the use of}} a rear {{bulkhead}} as an oil overflow collector. Even the front oil <b>tank</b> had its <b>overflow</b> routed through a labyrinthine path using chassis tubes {{all the way to the}} back.|$|R
25|$|In {{the same}} report, {{it was also}} {{concluded}} that the likely cause for Aiviqs loss of main engine power was sea water in the fuel oil. After the casualty, sea water contamination was found in settling tanks, day tanks, main engine primary filters and main engine injectors. The design of the vessel allowed considerable amount of sea water to enter the stern deck and subsequently to the fuel oil <b>tanks</b> through <b>overflow</b> vents in heavy weather. There were also problems with fuel management practices onboard Aiviq.|$|R
40|$|Cyano{{bacteria}} are {{bacteria that}} grow {{in water and}} are photosynthetic (use sunlight to create food and support life). Cyanobacteria live in terrestrial, fresh, brackish, or marine water. They usually {{are too small to}} be seen, but sometimes can form visible colonies. Cyanobacteria have been found among the oldest fossils on earth and are one of the largest groups of bacteria. Cyanobacteria have been linked to human and animal illnesses around the world, including North and South America, Africa, Australia, Europe, Scandinavia, and China. Cyanobacterial blooms and how they form Cyanobacterial blooms occur when algae that are normally present grow exuberantly. Within a few days, a bloom can cause clear water to become cloudy. The blooms usually float to the surface and can be many inches thick, especially near the shoreline. Cyanobacterial blooms can form in warm, slow-moving waters that are rich in nutrients such as fertilizer runoff or septic <b>tank</b> <b>overflows.</b> Blooms can occur at any time, but most often occur in late summer or early fall. They can occur in marine, estuarine, and fresh waters, but the blooms of greatest concern are the ones that occur in fresh water, such as drinking water reservoirs or recreational waters. What a cyanobacterial bloom looks lik...|$|R
