5|$|Contracting out to {{independent}} studios, Philips subsequently used the characters to create three {{games for the}} CD-i, with Nintendo taking no part in their development except to give input on {{the look of the}} characters based on the artwork from Nintendo's original two titles and that of their respective instruction booklets. Philips insisted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> studios utilize all aspects of the CD-i's capabilities including FMV, high-resolution graphics, and CD-quality music. Because the system had not been designed as a dedicated video game console, there were several technical limitations, such as laggy controls (especially for the standard infrared controller), and numerous problems in streaming-audio, memory, disc access, and graphics.|$|E
5|$|Crytek {{contracted}} Ruffian Games {{to develop}} a competitive multiplayer mode for Ryse, but the feature was later cut from the final game. Despite that, a co-operative multiplayer mode was introduced, and tasked players to fight against waves of increasingly difficult human enemies. The team originally hoped to add sea battles and animals to the game, but after internal testing, these features were removed. A Xbox SmartGlass feature called the Challenge Editor was set to be introduced to the game after its launch. It allowed players to create custom challenges for the game's co-operative multiplayer. However, Crytek announced <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> of this feature had been ceased in February 2014.|$|E

A retort builder like red-rumped swallow starts with an open cup, closes it, and then builds the entrance tunnel. Winkler and Sheldon propose <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> of closed nests reduced competition between males for copulations with the females. Since mating occurs inside the nest, the difficulty of access means other males are excluded. This reduction in competition permits the dense breeding colonies typical of the Delichon martins.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the heavy}} {{promotion}} it received, upon release the game only reached #18 in the Dengeki charts with initial sales of 14,000 units. Its sales continued {{to fall and}} within three weeks the game {{had dropped out of}} the Dengeki Top 50. By the end of the year, Nine had sold just over 30,000. According to Atlus, the game's sales {{by the end of the}} 2002-2003 fiscal year had reached 45,000 units: this fell below their planned sales number of 67,000 units. In May, Atlus announced <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> costs and poor sales of Xbox games, including Nine, had resulted in a financial loss for that year.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the lack}} of direct incentives, many firms applied {{to move to the}} Manor Royal estate: it was {{considered}} such an attractive place to relocate to <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Development</b> Corporation was able to choose between applicants to achieve the ideal mix of firms, and little advertising or promotion had to be undertaken. One year after Manor Royal was opened, eighteen firms were trading there, including four with more than 100 employees and one with more than 1,000. By 1964, businesses which had moved to the town since 1950 employed 16,000 people; the master plan had anticipated between 8,000 and 8,500. In 1978 there were 105 such firms, employing nearly 20,000 people.|$|E

5|$|Haas' early third {{millennium}} dates suggest <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> of coastal and inland sites occurred in parallel. But, from 2500 to 2000 BC, {{during the period}} of greatest expansion, the population and development decisively shifted toward the inland sites. All development apparently occurred at large interior sites such as Caral, though they remained dependent on fish and shellfish from the coast. The peak in dates is in keeping with Shady's dates at Caral, which show habitation from 2627 BC to 2020 BC. That coastal and inland sites developed in tandem remains disputed, however (see next section).|$|E
5|$|However, {{when the}} German coordinators {{discovered}} how extensively the game dealt with Neo-Nazism, they informed LucasArts {{about the difficulty}} of marketing the game in their country. As Germany was an important overseas market for adventure games, LucasArts feared that the lower revenues would not recoup development costs, and subsequently canceled the game. The plot was later adapted into a four-part Dark Horse Comics series by Lee Marrs, published monthly from December 1994 to March 1995. In an interview, Barwood commented <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> team should have thought about the story more thoroughly beforehand, calling it insensitive and not regretting the cancellation of the title.|$|E
5|$|IGN's Chloi Rad commended the game's {{blend of}} drama and action, {{as well as}} the {{realistic}} depiction of violence, and felt that the game's setting and period helped demonstrate the spirit of the revolution. Andrew Todd of Gameplanet praised the game's manner of dealing with issues like inequality, theocracy, and causes of anti-Americanism, and noted that they help create the atmosphere of the story and setting. Eurogamer's Jeffrey Matulef found the narrative's moral ambiguity refreshing, particularly the depiction of corrupting good people. He felt <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> team being primarily Iranian added to the game's authenticity. Kotakus Evan Narcisse similarly appreciated the ambiguity, noting its close imitation to the era. The choices presented in the game split reviewers; some found them important and scary, while others found them ultimately inconsequential.|$|E

He was assisted by Alan Turing, who arrived at Manchester in 1948. The Mark I incorporated innovations such as index registers, and combined CRTs with magnetic drum storage. Nine Mark I computers were sold by between 1951 and 1957.|$|E
5|$|Matsuno, the game's {{producer}} and director, preferred {{to create a}} new game title from scratch and use design ideas from staff collaborations, rather than reusing popular characters and designs that are found in sequels. Vagrant Story is regarded as a mixture of genres, as it contains elements of role-playing in its battles and platform games when in the field map. Matsuno explained <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> team was not eager to place Vagrant Story into a specific genre, preferring to create the game with a genre of its own.|$|E
5|$|Preliminary work on L.A. Noire {{began after}} the {{founding}} of developer Team Bondi in 2003. Though Team Bondi oversaw development, work was shared between the core team and multiple other studios owned by publisher Rockstar Games. Unlike other games published by Rockstar, L.A. Noire uses a custom engine, which includes a combination of facial motion capture and animation software. The game also uses MotionScan to capture actor's facial expressions. BBC News reporter Kev Geoghegan estimated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> budget for the game exceeded US$50 million, making L.A.

He said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> team {{intended to make}} Silent Hill a masterpiece rather than a traditional sales-oriented game, and that they opted for an engaging story, which would persist over time – similar to successful literature. The game debuted at the 1998 Electronic Entertainment Expo in Atlanta, Georgia, United States, where the presentations of movies and in-game scenes garnered applause from the audience. This favorable reception persuaded Konami to allot more personnel and public relation initiatives to the project. Konami later showcased Silent Hill at the European Computer Trade Show in London, and included a demo with its stealth game Metal Gear Solid in Japan.|$|E

They are hotly contested by ecological protesters and local residents on grounds <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> would threaten nearby Bronze Age remains, in particular the Nine Ladies Stone Circle, as well as the natural landscape locally. As of 2007, negotiations are ongoing to shift the development to the nearby Dale View quarry, a less sensitive area.|$|E
