5|$|For {{eight years}} after the fire, One Meridian Plaza sat vacant and damaged—in the center of Philadelphia's {{business}} district. The building was caught in litigation between <b>the</b> <b>owners</b> <b>and</b> the insurance company over how much the insurers would pay <b>the</b> <b>owners</b> <b>and</b> how repairs or demolition would proceed. Businesses near the empty high-rise closed or moved and the city sued the owners {{to do something with}} the building. After lawsuits were settled, the building was declared a total loss and began to be dismantled in 1998. At the time of its demolition in 1999, One Meridian Plaza was the third-tallest destroyed building in the world.|$|E
5|$|A six-page writeup {{about the}} {{building}} appeared in Architect and Engineer in December 1937. The article listed <b>the</b> <b>owners</b> <b>and</b> the structural engineer, {{but did not}} name the architect. In the early 1980s, geologist and architectural historian Gray Brechin discovered that Irvin Goldstine had designed the building; Brechin subsequently interviewed Goldstine regarding his career. An article about the discovery was printed in Metro Magazine, a defunct San Francisco magazine. Until that time, the building {{was thought to be}} designed by the Mallochs.|$|E
5|$|The Philadelphia Phillies are a Major League Baseball team {{based in}} Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. They are {{a member of}} the Eastern Division of Major League Baseball's National League. In the franchise's history, <b>the</b> <b>owners</b> <b>and</b> {{ownership}} syndicates of the team have employed 11general managers (GMs) and appointed 15team presidents. The GM controls player transactions, hiring and firing of the coaching staff, and negotiates with players and agents regarding contracts. The team president is the representative for the owner or the ownership group within the front office and is responsible for overseeing the team's staff, minor league farm system, and scouting.|$|E

5|$|During the Second World War, the Albert Dock was requisitioned by the Admiralty {{serving as}} a base for boats of the British Atlantic Fleet. The complex was damaged during air raids on Liverpool, notably during the May Blitz of 1941. In the {{aftermath}} of the war, the financial problems of <b>the</b> <b>owners</b> <b>and</b> the general decline of docking in the city meant that the future of the Albert Dock was uncertain. Numerous plans were developed for the re-use of the buildings but none came to fruition and in 1972 the dock was finally closed. Having lain derelict for nearly ten years, the redevelopment of the dock began in 1981, when the Merseyside Development Corporation was set up, with the Albert Dock being officially re-opened in 1984.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Geetha starts an {{investigation}} when she realises {{that her son}} has gone missing. After a preliminary investigation, Geetha calls Rambabu and his family in for questioning. Rambabu, predicting that this would happen, coaches his family on how to present their alibi. As a result, when questioned individually, their responses are consistent. They also produce the restaurant receipt, the movie tickets and the tickets of the bus journey as proof of their alibi. The statements {{of the people who}} own the establishments that the family visited in Vizianagaram further solidify Rambabu's alibi. However, after a thorough investigation, Geetha realises that Rambabu had acquired the tickets and the receipt {{on the day of the}} incident, made an acquaintance with <b>the</b> <b>owners,</b> <b>and</b> had only actually taken the trip a day later with his family.|$|E
5|$|Romeo Cormier, the {{youngest}} of the brothers to wrestle professionally, made his debut in 1967. Although he used the name Bobby Kay for the majority of his career, he also used different ring names while teaming with his brother Leonce. While Leonce was competing as Tommy Martin, Romeo took the name Terry Martin; in 1977, when Leonce had returned to the ring name Leo Burke, Romeo competed as Bobby Burke to win the Stampede Wrestling International Tag Team Championship with his brother. The majority of his championships came as part of a tag team, but he also won the NWA Central States Heavyweight Championship in 1974. Late in his career, he became co-owner of the ESA, but the promotion closed due to conflicts between <b>the</b> <b>owners</b> <b>and</b> the rival Atlantic Grand Prix Wrestling's ability to secure an important television contract. Cormier now works for Loblaw Companies but continues to wrestle on occasional shows.|$|E

5|$|Several {{ownership}} schemes {{were considered}} {{in the process of}} building and running the system. One plan, which named city officials as <b>the</b> <b>owners</b> <b>and</b> operators of the network, was scrapped because the city lacked the core competency to do it on its own, as well as the $25–30 million capital investment required for the initial construction. The plan which was ultimately adopted entailed a private company building and running the network. This plan met opposition from the Institute for Local Self Reliance, an organization that stated that it believed that the city should build the network itself, and then contract a private company to maintain it.|$|E
5|$|Slaviša Jokanović left Watford {{at the end}} of his one-year {{contract}} after he, and the club, failed to reach new contractual agreements; he was replaced in June 2015 by the Spaniard Quique Sánchez Flores. Watford's first fixture in their return to the Premier League was a 2–2 draw with Everton. In the 2015–16 season, Watford reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup with a goal by midfielder Adlène Guedioura against Arsenal at Emirates Stadium, ending Arsenal's bid to win the competition for three successive times, and finished 13th in the Premier League, despite the club being, when the season began, a favorite among betting shops to be relegated. Sanchez was sacked in May 2016, a decision that Flores subsequently attributed to the difference between how <b>the</b> <b>owners</b> <b>and</b> himself assessed Watford's ongoing season, and replaced by Italian coach Walter Mazzarri.|$|E
5|$|The dispute {{received}} a tepid response from sports fans, and provoked criticism from media members. It continued into January 1999, threatening {{cancellation of the}} entire season. After division within the players union, however, NBPA executive director Billy Hunter reached an agreement with NBA commissioner David Stern on January 6 to end the work stoppage. Quickly ratified by <b>the</b> <b>owners</b> <b>and</b> players, the deal was signed later in January, ending the lockout after 204 days. The settlement provided for maximum salaries for players and a pay scale for first-year players. In the months after the lockout, television ratings and ticket sales declined during the 50-game season, and both remained below pre-lockout levels in subsequent seasons.|$|E

5|$|The hoard {{was buried}} as an oak box or small chest filled with items in {{precious}} metal, sorted mostly by type with some in smaller wooden boxes {{and others in}} bags or wrapped in fabric. Remnants of the chest, and of fittings such as hinges and locks, were recovered in the excavation. The coins of the hoard date it after AD 407, which coincides {{with the end of}} Britain as a Roman province. <b>The</b> <b>owners</b> <b>and</b> reasons for burial of the hoard are unknown, but it was carefully packed and the contents appear consistent with what a single very wealthy family might have owned. Given the lack of large silver serving vessels and {{of some of the most}} common types of jewellery, it is likely that the hoard represents only a part of the wealth of its owner.|$|E
5|$|David Adler's book {{contains}} {{a detailed account}} of the event that made the Fool's Gold Loaf sandwich famous. On the night of February 1, 1976, Elvis Presley was at his home at Graceland in Memphis, entertaining Capt. Jerry Kennedy of the Denver, Colorado police force, and Ron Pietrafeso of Colorado's Strike Force Against Crime. The three men began discussing the sandwich, and Presley decided he wanted one right then. Presley had been to the restaurant before, while in Denver. Kennedy and Pietrafeso were friends of <b>the</b> <b>owners</b> <b>and</b> hung out there often, so they were driven to the Memphis airport and boarded Presley's private jet, the Lisa Marie, and flew the two hours to Denver. When they arrived at Stapleton International Airport at 1:40 AM, the plane taxied to a special hangar where the passengers were greeted by Buck Scott, the owner of the Colorado Mine Company, and his wife Cindy who had brought 30 fresh Fool's Gold Loaves for the men. They spent two hours in the hangar eating the sandwiches, washing them down with Perrier and champagne. Presley invited the pilots of the plane, Milo High and Elwood Davis, to join them. When they were done, they flew back to Memphis without ever having left the Denver airport.|$|E
5|$|On September 23, 2011, the NBA {{canceled}} training camp, {{which was}} to begin October 3, and {{the first week of}} preseason games, which were to run October 9 through 15. The incident marks {{only the second time in}} league history that games have been lost to a labor stoppage. Both <b>the</b> <b>owners</b> <b>and</b> the union had planned to meet on September 30 in New York and pledged to continue through the weekends if progress was being made. A source close to the situation leaked to ESPN that Stern plans to threaten the cancellation of the season if no deal is made, but the union sees this as a scare tactic and not a serious threat. Commentators speculated that Stern wants to put pressure on the players and prevent negotiation from dragging through the fall. The meeting on September 30 was tense as Dwyane Wade reportedly yelled at Stern after he pointed his finger at Wade. The players nearly stormed out, but they remained in the meeting only after Hunter asked them to. Stern also backed down from his earlier threat that he would cancel the season if there is no deal.|$|E
