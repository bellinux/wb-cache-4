5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the new Congress in 1977, Mathias was in line for several potential committee promotions to ranking member. However, Mathias' outspoken criticism of the party in the previous election cycle aroused enmity amongst his colleagues. On <b>the</b> <b>Judiciary</b> <b>Committee,</b> Mathias had the most seniority of any other member except Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, who already held another ranking membership on the Armed Services Committee. Only one ranking membership was allowed per senator, so Thurmond resigned his ranking membership on the Armed Services Committee to circumvent Mathias serving as ranking member of <b>the</b> <b>Judiciary</b> <b>Committee.</b> Mathias was also prevented from assuming leadership positions on the Government Operations Committee following a power struggle, and on the Judiciary Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights. On the latter subcommittee, Mathias had more seniority than any other member. However, party leaders were uneasy with the idea of allowing Mathias to team up with liberal Democrat and subcommittee chairman Birch Bayh, and voted instead for William L. Scott as ranking member.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his early}} {{resolution}} {{not to allow}} politics to impede upon his legal career, Maxwell's resolute support of the Union during the American Civil War, and of the statehood movement for West Virginia, refocused his priorities. Maxwell's political affiliation had been Republican, and he became {{actively involved in the}} formation of the state of West Virginia in 1863. Just weeks prior to the state's creation on June 20 of that year, he began his political career when he was elected to represent the Third Senatorial District in the inaugural session of the West Virginia Senate in June 1863. During his tenure in the senate, which lasted until 1866, Maxwell served as the chairman of <b>the</b> <b>Judiciary</b> <b>Committee.</b> In his position as the chairman of <b>the</b> <b>Judiciary</b> <b>Committee,</b> he played a prominent role in the passage of the state's earliest legislation.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the 1824 elections, the Relief faction gained a 22–16 {{majority}} in the state Senate and a 61–39 majority in the House. The pro-Relief majority in the state Senate subsequently elected Rowan to the U.S. Senate, which had the inadvertent effect of weakening the faction's cause in the House by removing its leader there. Rowan served in the Senate from March 4, 1825 to March 3, 1831. During the Twenty-first Congress, he was chairman of <b>the</b> <b>Judiciary</b> <b>Committee.</b>|$|E

5|$|His {{confrontations}} with conservatives cost him several leadership {{positions in the}} Senate, including chairmanship of <b>the</b> <b>Judiciary</b> <b>Committee.</b> Despite isolation from his conservative colleagues, Mathias played an influential role in fostering African American civil rights, ending the Vietnam War, preserving the Chesapeake Bay, and constructing the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. He retired from the Senate in 1987, having served in Congress for twenty-six years (eight years in the U.S. House of Representatives and eighteen years in the U.S. Senate).|$|E

5|$|On August 12, 1937, Roosevelt {{nominated}} Black to {{fill the}} vacancy. By tradition, a senator nominated for an executive or judicial office was confirmed immediately and without debate. However, when Black was nominated, the Senate departed from this tradition {{for the first time}} since 1853; instead of confirming him immediately, it referred the nomination to <b>the</b> <b>Judiciary</b> <b>Committee.</b> Black was criticized for his presumed bigotry, his cultural roots, and his Klan membership, when that became public.|$|E
5|$|The adverse results {{momentarily}} {{put a stop}} to Republican {{calls to}} impeach Johnson, who was elated by the elections. Nevertheless, once Congress met in November, <b>the</b> <b>Judiciary</b> <b>Committee</b> reversed itself and passed a resolution of impeachment against Johnson. After much debate about whether anything the President had done was a high crime or misdemeanor, the standard under the Constitution, the resolution was defeated by the House of Representatives on December 7, 1867, by a vote of 57 in favor to 108 opposed.|$|E

5|$|As {{impeachment}} proceedings began against President Johnson, Randall {{became one of}} his leading defenders in the House. Once the House determined to impeach Johnson, Randall worked to direct the investigation to <b>the</b> <b>Judiciary</b> <b>Committee,</b> rather than a special committee convened for the purpose, which he believed would be stacked with pro-impeachment members. His efforts were unsuccessful, as were his speeches {{in favor of the}} president: Johnson was impeached by a vote of 128 to 47. Johnson was not convicted after his Senate trial, and Randall remained on good terms with him after the president left office.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1970s, Bedell {{had decided to}} run for {{political}} office. In 1972, he ran against Wiley Mayne, a Republican incumbent in Iowa's 6th congressional district. Mayne was a staunch supporter of Richard Nixon and secured victory along with the President in a year favorable to the Republicans. Mayne, however, would politically suffer after Watergate (he was one of only a few Republicans to vote against impeaching the President on <b>the</b> <b>judiciary</b> <b>committee.)</b> The damage had already been done, and Bedell defeated Mayne in a 1974 rematch.|$|E
5|$|In 1886, Maxwell {{was elected}} {{a member of}} the West Virginia Senate, {{representing}} the Third Senatorial District, serving until 1893.

5|$|Knott was disbarred {{and briefly}} imprisoned for {{his refusal to}} take the oath of allegiance. He {{returned}} to Kentucky in 1863 and {{was elected to the}} U.S. House of Representatives. In 1871, he made a notable speech ridiculing a bill to subsidize westward expansion of railroads. In the speech, he lampooned the remote town of Duluth, Minnesota. The Duluth speech was eventually reprinted in several publications and brought Knott national acclaim. He did not stand for re-election in 1870, instead making a failed run for the office of governor. In 1875, he returned to the House and served as chair of <b>the</b> <b>judiciary</b> <b>committee.</b>|$|E

In 1982, Mathias chaired a bipartisan Senate inquiry into the methods used by the FBI in the Abscam corruption investigation, which found that dozens of officials had been named for accepting bribes without basis. He also served as co-chair of the Joint Committee on Printing from 1981 to 1983 and 1985 to 1987, and {{as a member of the}} Joint Committee on the Library from 1983 to 1987.|$|E
