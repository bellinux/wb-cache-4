5|$|The {{permissive}} attitude toward business {{did not always}} extend toward large corporations. A lack of venture capital in the state became a significant problem with the early industry. Civic and business leaders, and even ordinary citizens, worried that the influx of capital from outside the state {{would lead to a}} loss of political power, revenue, and business opportunities. This sentiment led to a series of antitrust lawsuits by <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>Attorney</b> <b>General</b> starting in 1906. The lawsuits easily succeeded and limited the ability of outside investors, most notably Standard Oil, to gain control of the state oil companies.|$|E
5|$|The {{constitution}} {{makes no}} mention of a lieutenant governor; if the governorship becomes vacant, the Senate President acts as governor. If more than one year remains in the governor's term at the time of vacancy, a new election is held; otherwise, the Senate President serves the remainder of the term. A bill passed in 2000 grants the Senate President the honorary title of Lieutenant Governor, but this title is rarely used in practice and the terms of the Senate President do not correspond with governorships. The same bill states that the line of succession after the Senate President will be the Speaker of the House of Delegates, followed by <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>attorney</b> <b>general,</b> the state auditor and former governors, in inverse order of term, that are in residence in the state {{at the time of the}} vacancy.|$|E

25|$|In July 2017, the Jewish Daily Forward {{revealed}} that the JNF-USA had loaned its chief executive officer, Russell Robinson, and its chief financial officer, Mitchel Rosenzweig, more than $500,000, in violation of New York State law. New York State forbids charities from lending their officers any money. The New York State attorney general's office opened an investigation and ordered the JNF rescind to rescind the two loans. The JNF said in response that Robinson and Rosenzweig were not officers under {{the meaning of the}} law, but the attorney general's officer rejected that argument. After the publication of the Forwards article, Robinson and Rosenzweig agreed to repay the balance of the loans, as required by <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>attorney</b> <b>general.</b>|$|E
25|$|Elsewhere, Kaiser Permanente {{did not do}} as well, and its {{geographic}} footprint {{changed significantly}} in the 1990s. The organization spun off or closed outposts in Texas, North Carolina, and the Northeast. In 1998, Kaiser Permanente sold its Texas operations, where reported problems had become so severe that the organization directed its lawyers to attempt to block {{the release of a}} Texas Department of Insurance report. This prompted <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>attorney</b> <b>general</b> to threaten to revoke the organization's license. Kaiser Permanente closed health plans in Charlotte and Raleigh-Durham in North Carolina four years later. The organization also sold its unprofitable Northeast division in 2000.

25|$|Colorado District Judge Andrew Hartman's {{decision}} in Colorado ex rel. Suthers v. Hall provided legal {{cover for the}} Boulder County clerk to issue same-sex marriage licenses {{as a form of}} civil disobedience. After Hartman's decision was handed down, the Denver County and Pueblo County clerks began issuing licenses to couples regardless of gender as well, despite Judge Crabtree's stay. When asked to enjoin the Denver County clerk from issuing licenses to same-sex couples, Judge Crabtree refused to take action. On July 14, 2014, Colorado Attorney General Suthers appealed Judge Crabtree's inaction to the Colorado Supreme Court. In a separate filing, and seeking a reversal of Judge Hartman's ruling, <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>attorney</b> <b>general</b> also asked the high court for an emergency injunction to stop all state clerks from issuing licenses.|$|E
25|$|The Boulder County clerk {{had been}} issuing {{licenses}} {{based on her}} own interpretation of the Tenth Circuit ruling in Kitchen soon after that ruling was handed down. <b>The</b> <b>state</b> <b>attorney</b> <b>general</b> filed a motion in the Colorado District Courts {{in an attempt to}} stay the clerk's actions. However, on July 10, 2014, a day after the Brinkman ruling, District Court Judge Andrew Hartman found that while the Boulder clerk violated the law—"There is little argument that Clerk Hall is engaging in a form of civil disobedience. She apparently is taking the position posited by St. Augustine and followed notably by Martin Luther King, Jr. that, 'an unjust law is no law at all.'"—but he refused to impose a restraining order or injunction upon her, as the state did not meet its high burden for a stay.|$|E
25|$|On February 14, two {{same-sex}} couples who were denied marriage licenses in Jefferson County, Timothy Love, Lawrence Ysunza, Maurice Blanchard, and Dominique James, {{asked to be}} allowed to intervene in the suit because their challenge to Kentucky's ban on same-sex marriage within the state raises substantially the same arguments as the original suit. On February 27, 2014, before the final order was issued, <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>attorney</b> <b>general</b> asked Judge Heyburn to stay enforcement of his Bourke order for 90 days, noting that even if the state does not appeal the decision it needs time to implement it. Judge Heyburn issued a final order in Bourke on the same day ordering the state to recognize same-sex marriages from other jurisdictions at once, which created de jure legalization of recognition of out-of-state same-sex marriages; being a final order it was then immediately subject to appeal. He then bifurcated the case and allowed the new plaintiffs to intervene and argue against Kentucky's denial of marriage licenses to in-state {{same-sex couples}}. This portion of the case would remain in district court, retitled as Love v. Beshear. A briefing schedule on the in-state issue was completed by May 28. On February 28, 2014, Judge Heyburn issued a shorter, 21-day stay in Bourke, instead.|$|E

500|$|In 1946, Bomar {{supervised}} the ransacking of African-American {{households in the}} Columbia Race Riot. A February 25 fight between James Stephenson, an African-American Navy veteran, and a white shopkeeper reportedly ignited the unrest. Later that day there was gunfire, fighting and rioting between whites and African Americans in Mink Slide, Columbia's African-American business district. When black citizens shot out the street lights, three officers and a chief responded to the gunfire; all four were shot. Bomar, described by one writer as commanding [...] "the firing line of the State Highway Police," [...] led the team sent in after the shootings with permission from <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>attorney</b> <b>general</b> to search homes and businesses for weapons. None of the accused were granted bail or allowed legal counsel, and 12 were charged with attempted murder.|$|E
500|$|Comer and Edelen {{released}} {{the report on}} their joint probe on April 30, 2012.

Edelen confirmed that his investigation indicated that laws had been broken, and the report {{was turned over to}} <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>attorney</b> <b>general</b> for investigation. Minutes after the report was released, Farmer's lawyer made a public statement in which he opined, [...] "I don't see anything in this audit report that any law-enforcement agency is going to be excited about." [...] He conceded that Farmer had declined to be interviewed during the investigation but felt it was unfair that Farmer was not given a chance to review or comment on the final report prior to its release.|$|E
500|$|In the 1962 U.S. Senate special {{election}} in Massachusetts, Kennedy initially faced a Democratic Party primary challenge from Edward J.

McCormack {{had the support of}} many liberals and intellectuals, who thought Kennedy inexperienced and knew of his suspension from Harvard, a fact which later became public during the race. Kennedy also faced the notion that with one brother President and another U.S. Attorney General, [...] "Don't you think that Teddy is one Kennedy too many?" [...] But Kennedy proved to be an effective street-level campaigner. In a televised debate, McCormack said [...] "The office of United States Senator should be merited, and not inherited," [...] and said that if his opponent's name was Edward Moore, not Edward Moore Kennedy, his candidacy [...] "would be a joke". Voters thought McCormack's performance overbearing, and with the family political machine's finally getting fully behind him, Kennedy won the September 1962 primary by a two-to-one margin. In the November {{special election}}, Kennedy defeated Republican George Cabot Lodge II, product of another noted Massachusetts political family, gaining 55percent of the vote.|$|E
