5|$|Since September 2014, several journalists, {{commentators}} {{and financial}} sector insiders have again raised {{the prospect of}} further currency war. This time, rather than being intended {{as a means to}} boost competitiveness, some states, especially Japan and the Eurozone, may be motivated to devalue their currencies as a means <b>to</b> <b>counter</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> of deflation. ECB President Mario Draghi has however denied any intent to engage in competitive devaluation.|$|E
5|$|Wellington's initial dispositions were {{intended}} <b>to</b> <b>counter</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> of Napoleon enveloping the Coalition armies by moving through Mons to the south-west of Brussels. This would have pushed Wellington closer to Blücher, but may have cut Wellington's communications with his base at Ostend. In order to delay Wellington's deployment, Napoleon spread false intelligence which suggested that Wellington's supply chain from the channel ports would be cut.|$|E

5|$|Henson's {{beliefs on}} {{doctrine}} were still forming, but he inclined to high-churchmanship and {{was influenced by}} Charles Gore and the Puseyites, though he was unattracted by more extreme Anglo-Catholic forms of ritualism. With his suspicion of nonconformism he was a proponent {{of the principle of}} establishment– the maintenance of Anglicanism as the official state religion– and in 1886 he became secretary of the new Oxford Laymen's League for Defence of the National Church, <b>to</b> <b>counter</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> of disestablishment proposed by politicians such as Joseph Chamberlain and Charles Dilke.|$|E
5|$|In 16th century England, Henry VIII began {{building}} Device Forts between 1539 and 1540 as artillery fortresses <b>to</b> <b>counter</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> of invasion from France and Spain. They were {{built by the}} state at strategic points for the first powerful cannon batteries, such as Deal Castle, which was perfectly symmetrical, with a low, circular keep at its centre. Over 200 cannon and gun ports were set within the walls, and the fort was essentially a firing platform, with a shape that allowed many lines of fire; its low curved bastions were designed to deflect cannonballs.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} issues facing digital {{forensics}} in South Africa. It examines particular cyber threats and cyber threat levels for South Africa {{and the challenges}} in addressing the cybercrimes in the country through digital forensics. The paper paints a picture of <b>the</b> cybercrime <b>threats</b> facing South Africa and argues for {{the need to develop}} a skill base in digital forensics in order <b>to</b> <b>counter</b> <b>the</b> <b>threats</b> through detection of cybercrime, by analyzing cybercrime reports, consideration of current legislation, and an analysis of computer forensics course provision in South African universities. The paper argues {{that there is a need}} to develop digital forensics skills in South Africa through university programs, in addition to associated training courses. The intention in this paper is to promote debate and discussion in order to identify <b>the</b> cyber <b>threats</b> to South Africa and to encourage the development of a framework <b>to</b> <b>counter</b> <b>the</b> <b>threats</b> – through legislation, high tech law enforcement structures and protocols, digital forensics education, digital forensics skills development, and a public and business awareness of cybercrime threats...|$|R
5|$|The {{appearance}} of new Soviet tanks {{such as the}} T-80B during the late 1970s and early 1980s demanded {{the development of new}} technologies and weapons <b>to</b> <b>counter</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> posed to Western armor. The T-80B had increased firepower and a new composite ceramic armor. The T-72 also went through a modernization program in an attempt to bring it up to the standards of the T-80B. In 1985 the new T-72B version entered production, with a new laminate armor protection system; its turret armor, designed primarily to defeat anti-tank missiles, surpassed the T-80B's in protection.|$|E
5|$|Also in March 1941, 91 Squadron moved in, {{equipped}} with Spitfires. Additional dispersals and fighter pens {{as well as}} three new blister hangars were built during 1941. Typhoons were based at Lympne from March 1942 to February 1944 <b>to</b> <b>counter</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> posed by the Luftwaffe's newly introduced Focke-Wulf Fw 190s and a runway was extended across Otterpool Lane to accommodate the Typhoons.

5|$|From early 1942, Tirpitz posed a {{significant}} {{threat to the}} Allied convoys transporting supplies through the Norwegian Sea to the Soviet Union. Stationed in fjords on the Norwegian coast, the battleship was capable of overwhelming the close-escort forces assigned to the Arctic convoys or breaking out into the North Atlantic. Due to {{the superiority of the}} Allied navies, Tirpitz rarely put to sea, and only conducted three brief combat operations into the Norwegian Sea during her career. However, the Allies needed to keep a powerful force of warships with the British Home Fleet <b>to</b> <b>counter</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> she posed, and capital ships accompanied most convoys part of the way to the Soviet Union.|$|E

5|$|The Tornado ADV (air defence variant) was an {{interceptor}} {{variant of}} the Tornado, developed for the RAF (designated Tornado F2 or F3) and also operated by Saudi Arabia and Italy. The ADV had inferior agility to fighters like the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle, {{but it was not}} intended as a dog-fighter, instead it was a long-endurance interceptor <b>to</b> <b>counter</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> from Cold War bombers. Although the ADV had 80% parts commonality with the Tornado IDS, the ADV had greater acceleration, improved RB199 Mk.104 engines, a stretched body, greater fuel capacity, the AI.24 Foxhunter radar, and software changes. It had only one cannon to accommodate a retractable inflight refuelling probe.|$|E
5|$|After half an {{hour the}} Russians finally stormed the ramparts of Fort 74 and {{defeated}} the Polish battalion defending it. This forced the Polish mobile artillery in Czyste, until then shelling the advancing Russian columns and their Grand Battery, to fall back. Meanwhile, the Russian right column was approaching Fort 72. Defended by only 200 men, the fort was approached by the Russian spearhead formed by the reinforced Nieśwież Regiment. Seeing this, the Polish commander ordered his cavalry reserve to charge the Russian infantry. Russian grenadiers stormed the ramparts of Fort 72, but were repelled and forced back behind the moat, where the Polish cavalry charged them. The Russians formed infantry squares, but were defeated and forced to retreat. <b>To</b> <b>counter</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> to Russian infantry, General Nostitz charged his own cavalry reserve under General Georg von Sass, and a cavalry battle ensued.|$|E

5|$|As the Operation Papuk-91 completed, the HV units {{subordinated to}} the Pakrac OG {{advanced}} to the villages of Kraguj, Japaga and Šeovica on 26–27 December 1991, outflanking the southern parts of Pakrac held by the JNA and the TO. The JNA employed the reinforcements it received <b>to</b> <b>counter</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat.</b> On 28 December, the JNA recaptured the two villages and threatened the Pakrac–Požega road. The same day, the HV retreated from Kraguj {{to the village of}} Kusonje to defend the road. On 29 December, the 127th Infantry Brigade suffered a loss of 12 killed or captured as it performed reconnaissance of positions held by the JNA and the TO on the Psunj Mountain, in the villages of Brusnik and Lipovac. The unit failed to advance later on.|$|E
5|$|Some of the Device Forts {{worked in}} {{conjunction}} with the volunteer units raised during the wars <b>to</b> <b>counter</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> of a French invasion. Walmer Castle was used by its captain William Pitt the Younger – then both the Prime Minister and the Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports – as the base for volunteer cavalry unit and a fleet of 35 armed fishing boats called luggers. Nearby Deal also had units of infantry and cavalry, called fencibles and in 1802 units of bombardiers recruited by Pitt carried out military exercises at the castle. Calshot was used to store munitions for nearby Sea Fencibles. Pendennis held a new volunteer artillery unit, which was used to train other garrisons across Cornwall.|$|E
5|$|The {{operation}} was hastily prepared {{and did not}} receive a name. Later known as Third Battle of Kharkov, it commenced on 21 February, as 4th Panzer Army under General Hoth launched a counter-attack. The German forces cut off the Soviet mobile spearheads and continued the drive north, retaking Kharkov on 15 March and Belgorod on 18 March. A Soviet offensive launched on 25 February by the Central Front against Army Group Center had to be abandoned by 7 March to allow the attacking formations to disengage and redeploy to the south <b>to</b> <b>counter</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> of the advancing German forces under Manstein. Exhaustion of both the Wehrmacht and the Red Army coupled {{with the loss of}} mobility due to the onset of the spring rasputitsa resulted in the cessation of operations for both sides by mid-March. The counteroffensive left a salient extending into the German area of control, centered on the city of Kursk.|$|E

50|$|During the Cold War, as {{a result}} of Great Britain's {{previous}} experiences of the U-boat blockade during both world wars, and disruption to transport communications {{as a result}} of aerial bombardment during World War II, the government decided to set up a system of food and raw material stockpiles <b>to</b> <b>counter</b> <b>the</b> <b>threats</b> of a nuclear war. These stores were mostly based on the reuse of existing government-owned sites and buildings; and the former M. S. Factory, Valley was adapted to become one of these storage sites.

5|$|Before {{the start}} of the Korean War, the Korean Peninsula was split by an American-backed {{government}} at the south and a Soviet-backed opposing government at the north. Divided by the 38th Parallel, both the United States and the Soviet Union agreed to maintain the division until a mutual decision was made {{about the future of the}} peninsula. On 25 June 1950, North Korean troops crossed the parallel and attacked several key South Korean targets. As the United States prepared military assistance with the South Koreans, the Soviet Union also helped the North Koreans by training pilots and providing MiG-15 aircraft. Jabara arrived in Korea on 13 December 1950 with the 334th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron of the 4th Fighter-Interceptor Wing. The squadron was the first F-86 Sabre unit deployed to the Fifth Air Force <b>to</b> <b>counter</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> by the Soviet MiG-15s. By 2 January 1951, he had flown five combat missions in F-86s and had damaged one MiG-15 Korean jet fighter in air combat. Jabara achieved his first confirmed victory on 3 April 1951 when 12 F-86 Sabres took on 12 MiG-15s in MiG Alley, a region in northwestern North Korea. He was credited with another on 10 April, a third on 12 April, and a fourth on 22 April. Eager to get his fifth victory to be deemed a flying ace, Jabara voluntarily transferred to the 335th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron when the 334th was rotated back to the United States.|$|E
5|$|Development of the {{sandwich}} began in 2001 {{in response to}} several major factors. After an overall sales decline of 17% coupled with a profit decline of 29%, Burger King {{held a series of}} consumer tests that showed the company's customer base was looking for a wider variety of options when making purchases. Additional survey results revealed that a lack of newer products was discouraging consumers from visiting the chain. Furthermore, the company was seeking <b>to</b> <b>counter</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> to its sales by newer fast casual restaurants that had begun to bite into sales. By July 2002, the chain had sold nearly fifty million of {{the sandwich}}es, eventually displacing the BK Broiler's initial launch figures as the company's best selling product introduction. The successful introduction of the Chicken Whopper {{was one of the few}} noted positive highlights of the company during negotiations for the sale of Burger King by its then owner Diageo to a group of investors led by the TPG Capital; Chicago-based consulting firm Technomic Inc. President Ron Paul was quoted that he was encouraged by recent product changes at Burger King such as the new Chicken Whopper, but he said it was too early to tell whether the changes have been successful. Despite the Chicken Whopper's initial success, just over a year after the its introduction, enthusiasm for the product was waning; Burger King's largest franchisee, Carrols Corporation, was complaining that the product line was a failure, describing the sandwich as a pedestrian product with a great name.|$|E

An unarmed expedition made its way back to Alceste to see what could be salvaged, but was forced back {{by the arrival of}} Malay Dyak pirates who plundered the wreck. Maxwell ordered the construction of a stockade and the improvisation of additional weapons <b>to</b> <b>counter</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> of an attack. The digging of a well solved the problem of water. On 22 February, an armed party set out to reclaim the ship but the pirates set fire to Alceste and made off. The fire lasted throughout the night and destroyed the wreck; the following morning Maxwell sent out a boat that managed to retrieve some barrels of flour, cases of wine, and a cask of ale. The pirates returned at dawn on 26 February, entering the cove aboard two proas and two canoes. Second lieutenant Hay led a sortie that boarded one of the proas, killing four pirates and capturing two more. The proa could not be brought to shore and was scuttled. More pirates arrived over the next two days. They made no attempt to land, but behaved aggressively by firing their swivel guns towards the shore. By 1 March there were fourteen pirate proas in the cove, with more arriving on the following night.|$|E
