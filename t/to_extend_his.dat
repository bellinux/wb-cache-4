5|$|Bjaðmunjo was a {{daughter}} of Muirchertach Ua Briain, High King of Ireland (died 1119). In the late eleventh century, {{following the death of}} his father, Muirchertach seized control of the Kingdom of Munster and moved <b>to</b> <b>extend</b> <b>his</b> authority throughout Ireland as High King of Ireland. In so doing, he gained control of the Norse-Gaelic Kingdom of Dublin, and as a result began <b>to</b> <b>extend</b> <b>his</b> influence into the nearby Kingdom of the Isles. There is uncertainty concerning the political situation in the Isles in {{the last decade of the}} eleventh century. What is known for sure is that, before the end of the century, Magnús Óláfsson, King of Norway (died 1103) led a marauding fleet from Scandinavia into the Irish Sea region, where he held power until his death in 1103.|$|E

5|$|A year later, Mechnikov {{studied a}} fresh water {{crustacean}} called Daphnia, a tiny transparent animal {{that can be}} examined directly under a microscope. He discovered that fungal spores that attacked the animal were destroyed by phagocytes. He went on <b>to</b> <b>extend</b> <b>his</b> observations to the white blood cells of mammals and discovered that the bacterium Bacillus anthracis could be engulfed and killed by phagocytes, a process that he called phagocytosis. Mechnikov proposed that phagocytes were a primary defense against invading organisms.|$|E

5|$|Even {{though the}} early church {{settlement}} at Llanbadarn Fawr was comparatively successful and well-endowed, {{it is unlikely that}} significant building work was done. The clas church would continue to reflect a strong Celtic form for many years. But even though St Augustine, first Archbishop of Canterbury, failed <b>to</b> <b>extend</b> <b>his</b> authority to the Christians in Wales and Dumnonia {{at the beginning of the}} seventh century, the influence of the western church was to begin to be gradually felt. However, even then, the tendency in west Wales was to build larger and larger single cell churches, rather than adopt the newly fashionable basilican design.|$|E

50|$|This {{engagement}} {{represents the}} {{high water mark}} of Mahdist activity {{in what is now}} southwestern Ethiopia.

5|$|Rome's {{preoccupation with}} its war with Carthage {{provided}} an opportunity for Philip V {{of the kingdom of}} Macedonia, located in the north of the Greek peninsula, to attempt <b>to</b> <b>extend</b> <b>his</b> power westward. Philip sent ambassadors to Hannibal's camp in Italy, to negotiate an alliance as common enemies of Rome. However, Rome discovered the agreement when Philip's emissaries were captured by a Roman fleet. The First Macedonian War saw the Romans involved directly in only limited land operations, but they ultimately achieved their objective of pre-occupying Philip and preventing him from aiding Hannibal.|$|E
5|$|Since Humphrey (VI) {{was only}} {{sixteen years old}} at the time of his father's death, the Braose lands were taken into the king's custody until 1270.

Humphrey technically regained his lordship from Clare in 1270, but by this time these lands had effectively been taken over by the Welsh prince Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, who had taken advantage of the previous decade's political chaos in England <b>to</b> <b>extend</b> <b>his</b> territory into the Marches.|$|E
5|$|The first Persian {{invasion}} of Greece, during the Persian Wars, began in 492 BC, {{and ended with}} the decisive Athenian victory at the Battle of Marathon in 490 BC.

These cities had supported the cities of Ionia during their revolt against Persian rule, thus incurring the wrath of Darius. Darius also saw the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>extend</b> <b>his</b> empire into Europe, and to secure its western frontier.|$|E

However, this turns out to be his only appearance in the League Cup, before returning to Crawley in September on loan. He was linked with a loan move to Notts County and Crewe Alexandra. Sadler then had a run in the first team, which lead <b>to</b> <b>extending</b> <b>his</b> loan spell for another month. After <b>extending</b> <b>his</b> loan spell, Sadler continued to remain in the first team before returning to his parent club on 13 November 2015.|$|R

50|$|Another view {{contends that}} Pakistani General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani {{is using the}} series of Taliban arrests <b>to</b> help <b>extend</b> <b>his</b> own career beyond his slated November {{retirement}} date, the theory being that this would raise his standing among American policymakers and thus press the Pakistani government to retain him.|$|R
