For some days after spleen extirpation, the increase of <b>red</b> <b>corpuscles</b> at low pressure is not to be seen or very slight but on 49 th day <b>red</b> <b>corpuscles</b> increase under low pressure as much as normal rabbit. 7) Injektion of pilocarpin. into vein increases the number of <b>red</b> <b>corpuscles,</b> and injektion of adrenalin and atropin decreases of it. From the above mentioned facts the auther recognized as principal cause the change of distribution of <b>red</b> <b>corpuscles</b> following the dilatation of peripheral blood vessels under low pressure...|$|R
40|$|In {{hanging drop}} {{preparations}} of normal blood from various species of animals including man, the following processes were directly observed {{for the first}} time: 1. The process of fusion between two <b>red</b> <b>corpuscles</b> so as to form a round or slightly oval macrocyte with normal hemoglobin content, a diameter of 10 µ± and no delle. These macrocytes appear to be slightly thicker in the centre than at the periphery. No thickness measurements could be made. 2. The process of fusion between two microcytes each 5 µ± in diameter, so as to form a <b>red</b> <b>corpuscle</b> of approximately normal size but with dense hemoglobin and no delle. 3. The process of fusion between a <b>red</b> <b>corpuscle</b> and a microcyte, forming a macrocyte slightly larger than a normal <b>red</b> <b>corpuscle</b> and exhibiting a normal hemoglobin tint but no delle. 4. The process of microcyte formation from <b>red</b> <b>corpuscles</b> was seen occurring in four different ways: (a) By the intermittent compression of a single <b>red</b> <b>corpuscle</b> by the pull of three or more fibrin threads attached to the corpuscle. (b) By the steady, continuous compression of a single <b>red</b> <b>corpuscle</b> by the pull of two polar fibrin threads, (c) By intermittent rises of intracorpuscular pressure in a <b>red</b> <b>corpuscle</b> due to trauma, (d) By avulsion and retraction or contraction of the hemoglobin stroma from the intact surface layer of a <b>red</b> <b>corpuscle.</b> Thickness measurements in single microcytes were made in rabbit blood. 5. The process of a typical microcyte with dense hemoglobin and no delle changing back to a fairly large <b>red</b> <b>corpuscle</b> with practically normal hemoglobin tint and with a delle. 6. Macrocytes were seen expelling their hemoglobin in {{a fraction of a}} second and turning into shadows which were often paler than the background, but without any decrease in the visible surface area or change in the contour. 7. Extensibility and retractibility (or perhaps relaxation and contraction) may be exhibited by the corpuscle as a whole, by local sections of both surface layer and stroma, or retractility (contractility (?)) may be shown by the hemoglobin stroma alone. On the basis of observational evidence it is inferred that: 1. The surface layer of a <b>red</b> <b>corpuscle</b> is probably a condensed stroma rather than an anatomically defined membrane. 2. A pigment, probably hemoglobin, is present in the surface layer. 3. The surface layer of <b>red</b> <b>corpuscles</b> becomes rigid before or during spontaneous hemolysis. 4. Hemoglobin exists in an undissolved form in the intact <b>red</b> <b>corpuscle.</b> 5. The transverse diameter of microcytes (5 µ±) represents the maximal shortening of which this diameter is capable in normal <b>red</b> <b>corpuscles</b> of man, rabbit and guinea pig under the conditions studied. 6. Fusing <b>red</b> <b>corpuscle</b> are destroyed by repeated washings with Ringer solution. 7. In stagnating blood there is no increase in fusion forms, nor in the production of microcytes...|$|R

40|$|The anemia in malarial infections is {{explained}} by the fact that each parasite destroys several <b>red</b> <b>corpuscles.</b> Reduction of hemoglobin out of proportion to the loss of <b>red</b> <b>corpuscles</b> {{is explained}} by the fact that there is always a partial loss of hemoglobin in certain of the surviving corpuscles due to parasitic action.

40|$|The {{phagocytosis}} of <b>red</b> <b>corpuscles,</b> while frequent in {{the normal}} dog, rat, and guinea pig, is slight in man, the rhesus monkey, and many rabbits. In cats it is always negligible in amount and frequently absent. Phagocytosis will not suffice as a general explanation of normal blood destruction. When the liver, spleen, and bone marrow of the cat, dog, rabbit, or monkey are slowly perfused with defibrinated blood or Locke"s solution, bodies are given off into the fluid which have the appearance of <b>red</b> <b>corpuscles</b> that have lost their hemoglobin but retained {{the rest of their}} cell substance. These bodies possess many of the properties supposedly distinctive of <b>red</b> <b>corpuscles.</b> They are the product of disordered parenchymal cells. By a special method, it has proved possible to search the body, organ by organ, and the circulating blood also, for disintegrating <b>red</b> <b>corpuscles.</b> Shadows of <b>red</b> cells are not present anywhere, nor are hemolyzing red cells found. A hemolytic process, in the ordinary sense of the term, can scarcely play an. important part in normal blood destruction. Instead, it is certain that some <b>red</b> <b>corpuscles,</b> at least, are destroyed in another way; namely, by fragmentation. Normal blood regularly contains small numbers of fragmentation forms—microcytes and poikilocytes—and accumulations of them are regularly present in the spleen, but are found only inconstantly in the other organs. The fragments are in evident process of further subdivision. They occur not only in species in which phagocytosis as a means of cell destruction is negligible (cats), but also in animals in which it is an important process (dogs, some rabbits). The method of study that we have employed is well suited to disclose how the blood is destroyed. The importance of cell fragmentation in this connection is indicated by our failure to find any other means of destruction, save only the phagocytosis already known. Further facts indicating the importance of fragmentation are presented in our second paper, where a general discussion will also be found...|$|R

Hippocrates, too, endowed this fluid with special properties; however, he considered it little more important than other fluids in the body. In the first century B. C., Aristotle viewed the blood with some scientific interest; he {{used it as a}} basis for classifying animals into sanguineous and bloodless. Galen's humoral concept of physiology, with the blood as one of the controlling factors in the nature of man, was retained {{along with the rest of}} his medical philosophy; indeed, we are prone even today to speak of a person as of a "sanguine" temperament. The alchemists, in their fumbling search for the philosopher's stone, examined the blood, but their results had little lasting import. Though the blood as the stream of life had thus long been an object of interest and speculation, not until the late seventeenth century was it examined by discerning eyes and its structure seen to be not a homogeneous red liquid, but a clear fluid containing myriads of pale yellow discs. It was in 1658 that Swammerdam' 32, then just twenty-one years old, first observed and described the <b>red</b> <b>corpuscles.</b> Unfortunately, a few years later he joined a religious cult which considered scientific inquiry vain and fruitless; therefore, much of his work was not published until after his death.
