5|$|White {{settlers}} who {{had traveled}} to Oregon along the Oregon Trail began to live in <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>desert</b> region in the 1850s and the 1860s, after they had begun farming and logging in the Willamette Valley and other lands in western Oregon. Thousands of these emigrants reached the area from the west, crossing the Cascade Range to make land claims in eastern Oregon. <b>The</b> <b>high</b> <b>desert</b> area was settled by whites later than western Oregon {{in part because of}} Elijah White's failure to find a pass east through the Cascades. Once they had claimed more land, pioneers and members of the American government negotiated treaties with natives in <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>desert</b> and elsewhere in Oregon, often forcing them off their native lands and on to reservations.|$|E

5|$|The {{indigenous}} people of <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>desert</b> region are the Northern Paiute people.

They make sandals, traps, and fishing nets, and weave baskets. Made out of sagebrush, willow, tule plant, Indian hemp, and sumac fibers, the baskets are tight enough to carry water. Archaeological evidence from near Fort Rock has shown that people wove baskets in the area at least 9,000years ago.|$|E
