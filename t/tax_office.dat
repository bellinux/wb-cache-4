Corrupt practices such as bribery often took place during tender processes, and whistleblower protection and national ombudsman are lacking in Belarus's anti-corruption system. However, there is a political will to fight against corruption in the government, {{and the government has}} made some progress in combating corruption, such as minimizing tax regulations in order to improve transparency in the <b>tax</b> <b>office.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Altes Stadthaus is {{arranged}} around two rectangular internal courtyards. The main section, which faces Mühlheimer Platz, has a mansard roof and is framed by four-storey turrets. The main entrance {{is at the}} southwest corner of Bottlerplatz, and the building bridges Windeckstraße, with two low arched openings. Bestelmayer's building was intended to be the nucleus of future development in the centre of Bonn. However, the only other construction there was the <b>tax</b> <b>office</b> on the corner of Mülheimer Platz and Münsterstraße, built in 1937, and some further building on Bottlerplatz. After the Neues Stadthaus—the new city administration building—was built, the main floor of the section of Altes Stadthaus facing Mühlheimer Platz was rebuilt to house the library. In the course of this restructuring, the two courtyards were roofed over and several interior walls replaced with columns. The east wing of the building was demolished {{to make way for a}} C department store.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The aim of {{this paper}} is to call the {{attention}} of public entities for the econometric frontier models which allows benchmarking the <b>tax</b> <b>offices</b> accurately. In the context of the European Maastricht, the European countries face public receipts shortage and to focus in the management of the tax agencies in order to maximize receipts. The procedure adopted in this paper allows benchmarking the tax agencies accurately. Design/methodology/approach – The paper adopts the stochastic frontier model to benchmark the <b>tax</b> <b>offices.</b> This model is presently very popular in benchmarking exercises, based on its statistical framework. Findings – The paper finds that the <b>tax</b> <b>offices</b> analysed vary along the sample and along the period. Research limitations/implications – The homogeneity of the <b>tax</b> <b>offices</b> and the short data set are the main limitations of the paper. Relative to the first, since they are managed by the same entity and perform the same task we can claim that they are similar, relative to the second critic, we cannot overcome it because of the secrecy related to this units. Practical implication – The efficiency rankings are due to the way the <b>tax</b> <b>offices</b> handle costs and outputs. The way they handle the combination of output and inputs is explained in the literature by the principal-agent relationship, by collective-action problem, due to asymmetric information between different <b>tax</b> <b>offices</b> and X-inefficiency. The public policy has to address these problems in order to upgrade the efficiency of the <b>tax</b> <b>offices.</b> Originality/value – This is the first paper adopting the stochastic frontier model in <b>tax</b> <b>offices.</b> Decision making, Portugal, Resource efficiency, Stochastic modelling, Taxation...|$|R

5|$|A major {{influence}} on Ueshiba's early education was his elementary schoolteacher Tasaburo Nasu, {{who was a}} Shinto priest and who introduced Ueshiba to the religion. At {{the age of six}} Ueshiba was sent to study at the Jizōderu Temple, but had little interest in the rote learning of Confucian education. However, his schoolmaster Mitsujo Fujimoto was also a priest of Shingon Buddhism, and taught the young Ueshiba some of the esoteric chants and ritual observances of the sect, which Ueshiba found intriguing. His interest in Buddhism was sufficiently great that his mother considered enrolling him in the priesthood, but his father Yoroku vetoed the idea. Ueshiba went to Tanage Higher Elementary School and then to Tanabe Prefectural Middle School, but left formal education in his early teens, enrolling instead at a private abacus academy, the Yoshida Institute, to study accountancy. On graduating from the academy, he worked at a local <b>tax</b> <b>office</b> for a few months, but the job did not suit him and in 1901 he left for Tokyo, funded by his father. Ueshiba Trading, the stationery business which he opened there, was short-lived; unhappy with life in the capital, he returned to Tanabe {{less than a year later}} after suffering a bout of beri-beri. Shortly thereafter he married his childhood acquaintance Hatsu Itokawa.|$|E
