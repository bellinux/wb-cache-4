40|$|The {{accounting}} standardization {{process is}} in progress at international regional level, more and more countries have reached the same conclusion of enforcing high quality accounting standards like IAS/IFRS. At international level, on one hand it is thought to implement IASB's international standards {{and on the other}} hand, to converge American standards with IASB standards. There are various reasons for Romania adopting the IASB reference system, but most of them are subordinated to the central aim, respectively EU accession. There are also some secondary reasons required by the IAS/IFRS transition, which in our country is less present than in more economic developed countries. In our country accountancy is subordinated to the taxation system, financing still comes prevalent from banks and very few Romanian companies are listed on foreign capital markets. According to this, starting with 2006 the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as presented and published by the International Accounting Standards Board, shall be applied in Romania by the following categories of companies: trade companies applying OMF no. 94 / 2001, loan institutions, assurance and reassurance companies, institutions supervised by the National Commission for Movable Assets, independent public companies and other state owned companies, companies to be consolidated by a company applying IFRS standards, companies, which {{at the end of the}} previous year fulfilled two of the following three criteria: turnover exceeding EUR 7. 3 Million, <b>total</b> <b>assets</b> over <b>EUR</b> 3. 65 Million, average number of employees over 50, as well as other companies subject to the Finance Ministry’s approval. ...|$|R

In addition to higher economic growth, the low degree of bank intermediation (about a third of its Western European equivalent) suggests strong growth potential for banks in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) in the coming years. Above-average growth potential, higher interest margins than in Western Europe and restructuring potential have led Western European banks to invest heavily in the CEE banking sector. Approximately 70 % of the CEE banking market is currently controlled by Western European banking groups. Austrian banks {{were among the first to}} invest in Central and Eastern European countries and are now some of the best-known Western European banks in the region (market share in the region: about 22 %). As early as 2002 and 2003, steady expansion in the CEE region had a positive impact on the profitability of Austria's consolidated banking sector. Favorable reports on the CEE banking market, however, often ignore potential risks. Key sources of risk in the Central and Eastern European banking market are macroeconomic imbalances, the risk of growing exchange rate volatility, credit risk, increasingly fierce competition and political risks.

40|$|Motivated by {{the recent}} {{discussion}} of the declining importance of deposits as banks' major source of funding we investigate which factors determine funding costs at local banks. Using a panel data set of more than 800 German local savings and cooperative banks for the period from 1998 to 2004 we show that funding costs are not only driven by the relative share of comparatively cheap deposits of bank's liabilities but among other factors especially {{by the size of}} the bank. In our empirical analysis we find strong and robust evidence that, ceteris paribus, smaller banks exhibit lower funding costs than larger banks suggesting that small banks are able to attract deposits more cheaply than their larger counterparts. We argue that this is the case because smaller banks interact more personally with customers, operate in customers' geographic proximity and have longer and stronger relationships than larger banks and, hence, are able to charge higher prices for their services. Our finding of a strong influence of bank size on funding costs is also in an in international context of great interest as mergers among small local banks - the key driver of bank growth - are a recent phenomenon not only in European banking that is expected to continue in the future. At the same time, net interest income remains by far the most important source of revenue for most local banks, accounting for approximately 70 % of total operating revenues in the case of German local banks. The influence of size on funding costs is of strong economic relevance: our results suggest that an increase in size by 50 %, for example, from EUR 500 million in <b>total</b> <b>assets</b> to <b>EUR</b> 750 million (exemplary for M&A transactions among local banks) increases funding costs, ceteris paribus, by approximately 18 basis points which relates to approx. 7 % of banks' average net interest margin...|$|R
