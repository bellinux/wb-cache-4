5|$|Blocky (dotted {{with flat}} blocks of {{minerals}} and crystals) lava flows stream from its summit to its flanks. Three historical eruptions {{have taken place}} – two within the 18th century, the first from 1700–1710, and the latter in 1796. The earliest prehistoric eruption was believed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>place</b> between 3050 and 2050BCE.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Raith in AD 596 is {{believed}} <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>place</b> {{to the west}} of the town's site. The battle was fought between the Angles and an alliance, led by King Áedán mac Gabráin of Dál Riata, of Scots, Picts and Britons.|$|E
5|$|The {{transition}} to a more radical form of poetry seems <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>place</b> in 1913-1915, during the periods when Tzara and Vinea were vacationing together. The pieces share a number of characteristics and subjects, and the two poets even use them to allude to one another (or, in one case, to Tzara's sister).|$|E

5|$|Although Fleming did not {{date the}} event within his novels, John Griswold and Henry Chancellor—both of whom wrote books for Ian Fleming Publications—have {{identified}} different timelines based on events and situations within the novel series as a whole. Chancellor put {{the events of}} Dr. No in 1956; Griswold is more precise, and considers the story <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>place</b> in February and March of that year.|$|E
5|$|Although Fleming {{provides}} no dates within his novels, John Griswold and Henry Chancellor—both {{of whom have}} written books on behalf of Ian Fleming Publications—have identified different timelines based on events and situations within the novel series as a whole. Chancellor put the events of Diamonds Are Forever in 1954; Griswold is more precise, and considers the story <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>place</b> in July and August 1953.|$|E
5|$|Substantial {{alterations}} appear <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>place</b> {{during the}} early years of Samuel Egerton's ownership in the mid-18th century. The canopy at the dais end of the Great Hall was destroyed– although part of it can still be seen in the north wall– when a floor was inserted and new rooms were formed with lath and plaster partitions. The east wing of the hall was probably demolished at about the same time, but certainly before 1812, the date of the earliest estate map.|$|E

5|$|The K'iche' conquest appears <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>place</b> around AD1000, {{some four}} centuries earlier {{than had been}} {{supposed}} using calculations based on the indigenous accounts. After the initial arrival of the K'iche' activity continued at the site without pause, and the local styles were simply replaced by styles associated with the conquerors. This suggests that the original inhabitants abandoned the city they had occupied for almost two millennia.|$|E
5|$|Aldermaston {{is under}} the {{catchment}} of Thames Valley Police and is covered by the Brimpton Neighbourhood Policing Team. In a meeting with Aldermaston Parish Council, the police reported that 57 criminal offences were reported <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>place</b> in the parish between 2009 and 2010. Of this, the majority was theft from non-dwelling properties. Vehicle crime had dropped by 57% on the previous year but violent crime had risen from four to six incidents. Five of these crimes were reported to be domestic violence. There have been no reported cases of robbery in Aldermaston since 2006.|$|E
5|$|Although Bach's {{manuscript}} is lost, {{the work}} is agreed {{to be one of}} the earliest Bach cantatas, probably composed during the year he spent in Mühlhausen 1707/1708 as organist of the Divi Blasii church, at the age of 22. Various funerals known <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>place</b> at this time have been proposed as the occasion for the composition, for example that of his uncle Tobias Lämmerhirt from his mother's family, who died in Erfurt on 10 August 1707, and that of Adolph Strecker, a former mayor of Mühlhausen, whose funeral was 16 September 1708.|$|E

25|$|Series Four of The Apprentice (UK), a British reality {{television}} series, {{was broadcast}} in the UK during 2008 from 26 March to 11 June on BBC One. Production {{of the series}} <b>took</b> <b>place</b> the previous year between September and October, with auditions and interviews reported <b>to</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>place</b> in London, Glasgow, Manchester and Bristol {{during the first two}} weeks of July 2007, with a record of 20,000 applications made for participation on the show to be on the show that year. Sixteen candidates took part, and the two teams were named Alpha and Renaissance throughout its run, with Lee McQueen winning the series.|$|R
5|$|Calgacus' fate {{is unknown}} but, {{according}} to Tacitus, {{after the battle}} Agricola ordered the prefect of the fleet to sail around the north of Scotland to confirm that Britain was an island and to receive the surrender of the Orcadians. It was proclaimed that Agricola had finally subdued all the tribes of Britain. However, the Roman historian Cassius Dio reports that this circumnavigation resulted in Titus receiving his 15th acclamation as emperor in 79. This is five years before Mons Graupius is believed by most historians <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>place.</b>|$|E
5|$|Capella A {{consists}} of two yellow evolved stars that have been calculated to orbit each other every 104 days with a separation of around 100 million km. The pair is a non-eclipsing binary—that is, as seen from Earth, neither star passes {{in front of the}} other. The orbit is known extremely accurately and can be used to derive an orbital parallax with far better precision than the one measured directly. The stars are not near enough to each other for the Roche lobe of either star to have been filled and any significant mass transfer <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>place,</b> even during the red giant stage of the primary star.|$|E
5|$|Fossil caddisflies {{have been}} found in rocks dating back to the Triassic. The largest numbers of fossilised remains are those of larval cases, which are made of durable {{materials}} that preserve well. Body fossils of caddisflies are extremely rare, the oldest being from the Early and Middle Triassic, some 230 million years ago, and wings are another source of fossils. The evolution of the group to one with fully aquatic larvae seems <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>place</b> some time during the Triassic. The finding of fossils resembling caddisfly larval cases in marine deposits in Brazil may push back the origins of the order to the early Permian period.|$|E
5000|$|On October 3, 2016 {{the team}} {{announced}} they had released WR Gurley, Elliott and Hazelton, along with Phil Bates. [...] The move {{was considered a}} shock by most, but post-game comments by Coach Milanovic in Montreal on October 2, 2016 following a loss to the Als revealed the move which was about to <b>take</b> <b>place</b> was {{about more than just}} on-field issues. [...] "We've got some good football players here that I'm not sure are real committed to what we need <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>take</b> <b>place,</b> and it's little things; being late, not showing up prepared, screwing around and that's where we're at right now, it's not going to stay that way." ...|$|R
50|$|The Accra Sport Stadium {{disaster}} {{occurred at}} the Ohene Djan Stadium, Accra, Ghana on May 9, 2001. It took the lives of 127 people, making it the worst stadium disaster <b>to</b> <b>have</b> ever <b>taken</b> <b>place</b> in Africa.|$|R
50|$|Their {{religious}} rites are said <b>to</b> <b>have</b> invariably <b>taken</b> <b>place</b> at sunrise, usually on rock outcrops. Some involved animal sacrifices. Some were reserved for elders, {{while others were}} open to all. Ritual feasts were held at stone circles.|$|R
5|$|In May 1874, {{soon after}} taking over Minister of Education in the Conservative Party cabinet of Lascăr Catargiu, his friend Maiorescu granted Creangă the {{position}} of schoolteacher in the Iași area of Păcurari. During the same period, Ion Creangă met and became best friends with Mihai Eminescu, posthumously celebrated as Romania's national poet. This is said <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>place</b> in summer 1875, when Eminescu was working as an inspector for Maiorescu's Education Ministry, overseeing schools in Iași County: reportedly, Eminescu was fascinated with Creangă's talents as a raconteur, while the latter admired Eminescu for his erudition.|$|E
5|$|Janet's {{landfall}} as a Category5 hurricane on the Yucatán Peninsula was {{the first}} recorded instance that a storm of such intensity in the Atlantic made landfall on a continental mainland; prior to Janet, landfalls of Category5 intensity were only known <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>place</b> on islands. Janet's minimum barometric pressure, recorded in Chetumal, {{was at the time}} the second lowest recorded pressure on land associated with a tropical cyclone in the Atlantic, behind the 1935 Labor Day Hurricane. At least 1,023deaths were attributed to Hurricane Janet, as well as $65.8million in damages. The name Janet was later retired from the Atlantic list of tropical cyclone names due to its significance to the scientific research community.|$|E
5|$|Khánh held {{a number}} of {{meetings}} with American officers in Huế {{during the first two}} weeks of January. In addition to routine military matters, coup discussions were also reported <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>place.</b> Khánh also regularly flew down to Saigon to take part in plotting with his colleagues. These usually took place in the secluded house of a colonel who was a nearby province chief. Meetings were also held at Khánh's headquarters in Huế. Khánh began growing a small goatee, which he customarily grew when he was attempting a new project and would only shave once the job had been completed.|$|E
50|$|Beginning {{early in}} the 20th century, a {{different}} sort of Canarian emigration <b>to</b> America <b>has</b> <b>taken</b> <b>place,</b> primarily <b>to</b> Florida, of migrants not officially sanctioned or subsidized, but coming by their own means. Many Canarians live in the United States temporarily as migrant workers.|$|R

50|$|A {{floating}} timeline (also {{known as}} a sliding timescale) is a device used in fiction, particularly in comics and animation, to explain why characters age little {{or not at all}} {{over a period of time}} — despite real-world markers like notable events, people and technology appearing in the works and correlating with the real world. A floating timeline is a subtle form of retroactive continuity. This is seen most clearly in the case of comic book characters who debuted as teens in the 1940s or the 1960s but who are still relatively young in current comics. Events from the characters' pasts are alluded to, but they are changed from <b>having</b> <b>taken</b> <b>place</b> years ago <b>to</b> <b>having</b> <b>taken</b> <b>place</b> more recently.|$|R
