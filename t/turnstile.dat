5|$|Octopus {{card reader}} {{includes}} a fail-safe that prevents reader from initiating transaction {{when more than}} one card is being detected at the same time. On 11 February 2009, Sing Tao Daily reported that the fail-safe has been abused for fare evasion through the railway station <b>turnstile.</b> A large amount of dishonest passengers at Sheung Shui Station and Lo Wu Station were stacking up 4 or more cards before breaking through the <b>turnstile,</b> pretending their cards have been touched with the reader correctly but triggering the fail-safe deliberately to avoid card value deduction. Because of this, if they get caught by the station staff, they can make an excuse of a hardware malfunction and offer the Octopus card with an unsuccessful transaction.|$|E
5|$|Anfield {{comprises}} 54,074 seats {{split between}} four stands: the Anfield Road end, the Kenny Dalglish Stand, the Kop, and the Main Stand. The Anfield Road end and Kenny Dalglish Stand are two-tiered, while the Kop is a single-tiered and the Main Stand a three-tiered. Entry {{to the stadium}} is gained by radio-frequency identification (RFID) smart cards rather than the traditional manned <b>turnstile.</b> This system, used in all 80turnstiles around Anfield, was introduced in 2005.|$|E

5000|$|... ===Turnstiles=== The New York City Subway {{has four}} basic types of fare control equipment: low <b>turnstiles</b> (including agent-operated special entry <b>turnstiles,</b> SETs), high entrance-exit <b>turnstiles</b> (HEETs), high exit <b>turnstiles</b> (HXTs), and gates (including {{emergency}} exit gates (EXG), agent-operated gates (AOG), and Autonomous Farecard Access System (AFAS) gates for wheelchair access). Passengers enter the subway by swiping farecards {{to unlock the}} <b>turnstiles.</b> Typical control areas feature low <b>turnstiles,</b> one or more EXGs, and a token booth. Unstaffed entrances that were remodeled before the late 2000s featured only HEETs and EXGs. Exit-only locations have only HXTs and EXGs. All control areas must {{have at least one}} EXG, as per State emergency regulations.|$|R
50|$|Manned <b>turnstiles</b> are towards exits 1-4, {{unmanned}} <b>turnstiles</b> are towards exits 6 and 7, while exit 5 is in {{the very}} middle.|$|R
5|$|Cantor Fitzgerald L.P., an {{investment}} bank on the 101st–105th {{floors of the}} North Tower, lost 658 employees, considerably {{more than any other}} employer. Marsh Inc., located immediately below Cantor Fitzgerald on floors 93–100, lost 358 employees, and 175 employees of Aon Corporation were also killed. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) estimated that about 17,400 civilians were in the World Trade Center complex {{at the time of the}} attacks. <b>Turnstile</b> counts from the Port Authority suggest 14,154 people were typically in the Twin Towers by 8:45a.m. Most people below the impact zone safely evacuated the buildings.|$|E
5|$|The Rockaway-bound {{platform}} has two High Entry/Exit Turnstiles and one exit-only <b>turnstile</b> {{leading to}} a short staircase that goes down to the intersection of 159th Road and 103rd Street. The Brooklyn-bound platform has a set of emergency doors leading {{to the parking lot}} just north of the AirTrain JFK station; they are normally locked, but were in use from December 2012 to May 2013 as a connection to a temporary shuttle bus service instituted after Hurricane Sandy. Both platforms have stairs, escalators, and an elevator to the headhouse above the platforms.|$|E
5|$|The stadium {{opens to}} ticket holders {{two hours before}} kick-off. The main club shop, named 'The Armoury', and ticket offices are located near the West Stand, with other an {{additional}} store {{at the base of}} the North Bank Bridge, named 'All Arsenal' and the 'Arsenal Store' next to Finsbury Park station. Arsenal operates an electronic ticketing system where members of 'The Arsenal' (the club's fan membership scheme) use their membership cards to enter the stadium, thus removing the need for <b>turnstile</b> operators. Non-members are issued with one-off paper tickets embedded with an RFID tag allowing them to enter the stadium.|$|E
5000|$|The station made a brief {{appearance}} in the movie Unbreakable as Elijah (Samuel L. Jackson) falls {{down the stairs to}} the platform. It is portrayed as a subway station with <b>turnstiles</b> in the movie, though in reality; the station had no <b>turnstiles</b> at the time of filming, as [...] "Rotogate" [...] <b>turnstiles</b> were installed at the Spruce St. entrance in May 2017 in preparation for SEPTA Key Deployment on Regional Rail. The Convention Avenue Entrance has regular height <b>turnstiles</b> and ADA Gates.|$|R
5000|$|Exits/entrances through <b>turnstiles</b> to Church Street {{are located}} in the {{mezzanine}} of this station, along with a few High Entrance-Exit <b>Turnstiles</b> (HEETs). There are street stairs: ...|$|R
50|$|The only {{active station}} house beneath the {{platforms}} and tracks {{at the east}} end has four staircases: two to the street (one to each western corner of Beach 67th Street and Rockaway Freeway) and one to each platform. The mezzanine layout gives evidence that there were originally separate <b>turnstiles</b> for entry and exit. The entry <b>turnstiles</b> are all {{on one side of}} the booth while the exit <b>turnstiles</b> are on the opposite side. Since the elimination of the double fare, steel gates have replaced the <b>turnstiles.</b>|$|R
5|$|Each {{platform}} has two same-level fare control areas, one {{at either}} end of the station, and there are no crossovers or crossunders. The full-time ones are at the north end and each has a <b>turnstile</b> bank, token booth, and two street stairs. The ones on the Manhattan-bound platform go up to the northeast and southeast corners of Bergen and Smith Streets while those on the Coney Island-bound platform go up to the northwest and southwest corners. The fare control areas on the south end of the platforms are unstaffed, containing full height turnstiles and one street stair to the northeast corner of Warren and Smith Streets on the Manhattan-bound platform and the northwest corner for the Coney Island-bound platform. The south fare control area is more heavily used.|$|E
5|$|In 1989 {{the club}} {{moved to the}} Portway Stadium, {{situated}} in the Portway Industrial Estate on the western outskirts of the town. Built {{at a cost of}} £850,000, the ground has a main stand of brick and concrete construction with bench seating for around 250 people. This stand is set on a bank running along the entire south side of the ground, giving spectators on that side an elevated view of the pitch. The managers' benches are set into this banking in front of the stand at pitch level. The banking slopes down behind each goal until it reaches the same level as the pitch along the north side. There is hard standing around the entire perimeter of pitch, along with a <b>turnstile</b> block and a gate opening out onto the stadium car park for ambulance access.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, a {{temporary}} visitor security screening center {{was added to}} the east entrance of the Washington Monument {{in the wake of the}} September 11 attacks. The one-story facility was designed to reduce the ability of a terrorist attack on the interior of the monument, or an attempt to seize and hold it. Visitors obtained their timed-entry tickets from the Monument Lodge east of the memorial, and passed through metal detectors and bomb-sniffing sensors prior to entering the monument. After exiting the monument, they passed through a <b>turnstile</b> to prevent them from re-entering. This facility, a one-story cube of wood around a metal frame, was intended to be temporary until a new screening facility could be designed.|$|E
50|$|Various <b>turnstiles</b> {{from the}} history of subways are on display at the New York Transit Museum. They date {{as far back as the}} subway's opening in 1904, up through <b>turnstiles</b> that were still in use as {{recently}} as 2003. The exhibit includes many different types of <b>turnstiles,</b> including <b>turnstiles</b> used during the 1939 New York World's Fair that were designed to require passengers to pay a special double fare both upon entering and exiting the World's Fair subway station. The exhibit is designed to be interactive and to be viewed in conjunction with a large board that details the history of fare payment in the subway. Most of the <b>turnstiles</b> can be walked through by visitors wishing to do so.|$|R
40|$|As a {{step toward}} realizing the quantum current standard, single-electron pumping of {{parallel}} SINIS <b>turnstiles</b> was performed. Eleven SINIS <b>turnstiles</b> were fabricated on the same chip, {{and the number of}} operating SINIS <b>turnstiles</b> was increased one by one. As a result, 11 <b>turnstiles</b> were operated simultaneously up to 100 MHz, resulting in a pumped dc of 176. 2 pA. We also did a linearity check toward parallelization. This paper for increasing the pumped current by parallelization will lead to practical use of stable and accurate dc sources with tiny values of the output current and the metrology triangle experiment for SI redefinition...|$|R
50|$|The club {{installed}} {{an electronic}} ticketing system on all <b>turnstiles</b> at Griffin Park {{in the summer}} of 2014. Previously, supporters were able to pay on the <b>turnstiles</b> on match days for non-all-ticket matches.|$|R
5|$|Stanley {{acted upon}} a remark made {{by his father}} in 1854 about the high cost and poor quality of English drawing {{instruments}} compared to those imported from France and Switzerland, and started a business making mathematical and drawing instruments. At first he rented a shop and parlour at 3 Great <b>Turnstile,</b> Holborn, and began the business with £100 capital. He invented a new T-square which improved the standard one and became universally used. A cousin, Henry Robinson, joined him with a capital of £150, but died in 1859. Stanley stopped using the name Robinson and changed his signature {{as a consequence of}} being robbed of his cheque book during the early days of his business.|$|E
5|$|The 2009 Orange Bowl {{kicked off}} at 8:47p.m. Eastern Standard Time (EST) at Dolphin Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida. An {{estimated}} total of 73,602tickets were sold for the game, but bowl officials estimated 15,781sold tickets went unused, giving a <b>turnstile</b> attendance of 57,821. The game was televised on FOX, and the announcers were Thom Brennaman, Charles Davis, and Chris Myers. An estimated 9.3million viewers watched the broadcast, earning it a Nielsen rating of 5.4. Figures {{on the total}} payout vary, but Virginia Tech and Cincinnati each received between $17million and $18million for playing in the Orange Bowl, an amount that was shared with the other teams in each school's athletic conference.|$|E
5|$|The main {{access to}} the station is from Station Road to the east, however {{there is also a}} set of steps and a <b>turnstile</b> into the {{industrial}} estate to the west. Facilities at the station are minimal – there are small brick shelters on each platform, but no facilities for buying tickets. There are customer help points, giving next train information for both platforms, as well as dot-matrix displays showing the next trains on each platform. A pay and display car park with 15 spaces, and racks for four bicycles, are {{on the east side of}} the station on Station Road. CCTV cameras are in operation at the station. Access to the eastern platform is step-free from the car park, however there is no step-free access to trains. The only public {{access to the}} western platform is via the stepped footbridge.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} to relocate the station booth to the 7th Avenue entrance (where 65% of entrances and exits occur), replacing the HEET <b>turnstiles</b> with waist-high <b>turnstiles.</b> Most of the mezzanine would also be closed off.|$|R
25|$|By {{the third}} quarter of 2008, PATH had {{completed}} the inactivation of all <b>turnstiles</b> that accepted cash (in addition to the QuickCard, MetroCard and SmartLink card). These <b>turnstiles</b> will continue to accept the various cards as fare payment.|$|R
25|$|The <b>turnstiles</b> on the {{entrance}} into the SeaBus waiting area are used only for {{counting the number of}} passengers boarding. When the maximum number is reached, the <b>turnstiles</b> lock and no more passengers are allowed on that SeaBus.|$|R
5|$|This {{all changed}} {{when a new}} regime, chaired by David Holmes, took control of Rangers in 1986. Graeme Souness was {{appointed}} player–manager, while several English stars, including Terry Butcher and Chris Woods, were signed. Season ticket sales rose from 7,000 in 1986 to over 30,000 in the 1990s, while commercial income increased from £239,000 in 1986 to over £2 million in 1989. The introduction of computerised ticketing, zonal public address systems and closed-circuit television for monitoring <b>turnstile</b> areas meant that Ibrox was {{at the forefront of}} stadium management. Rangers also adopted the American technique of analysing the types of fans in each area of the stadium and adjusted their food stalls accordingly. Greater success on the pitch meant that Ibrox demonstrated that seated stadiums would be welcomed by most fans, if designed and fitted well.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1951–52 season, Barnes returned to the New South Wales team in a bid to regain his Test position, and performed well. He was chosen by the selectors but the board disallowed his selection for conduct reasons rather than ability. The media figured this out and publicised it, and Barnes was overlooked for the whole season. Speculation abounded as to the nature of his supposed misdeeds. These included jumping the <b>turnstile</b> at a ground when he forgot his player's pass, insulting the royal family, theft from team-mates, drunkenness, stealing a car, parking his car in someone else's space, or that Barnes had lampooned the board in the narration accompanying the home movies he made of the 1948 tour. In later years, a file of unknown authorship was found; it accused Barnes of allowing young spectators to enter the playing arena to field the ball instead of doing so himself, and of denigrating umpires by making gestures implying they were blind.|$|E
5|$|During {{his absence}} from the Test team, the Australian {{selectors}} had been unsuccessful {{in their attempts to}} find a reliable partner for Arthur Morris to open the batting. Barnes started the season solidly and, in the last match before the team for the third Test against the West Indies was chosen, he hit 107 against Victoria. The selectors duly picked him for the match, then passed the team list to the Board of Control for ratification. The Board vetoed the inclusion of Barnes and requested the nomination of a replacement player. Unwilling to accept the blame for Barnes's omission, the selectors deliberately deferred their decision on the replacement. When the team was not announced at the scheduled time, journalists uncovered the story and Barnes became a cause célèbre for many weeks, missing all of the remaining Tests. Speculation abounded as to the nature of his supposed misdeeds. These included jumping the <b>turnstile</b> at a ground when he forgot his player's pass; insulting the Royal Family; theft from team-mates; drunkenness; and stealing a car.|$|E

25|$|A new stationhouse at Tompkinsville {{opened on}} January 20, 2010, with <b>turnstiles</b> {{installed}} {{for the first}} time. The <b>turnstiles</b> were installed because passengers often avoided paying the fare by exiting at Tompkinsville, and taking a short walk to the St. George ferry terminal.|$|R
5|$|In the meantime, {{the team}} was not {{announced}} at the scheduled time due to the delay caused by the veto. Journalists deduced the story and Barnes became a cause célèbre for many weeks, missing all the remaining Tests. Speculation abounded as {{to the nature of}} his supposed misdeeds. These included jumping the <b>turnstile</b> at a ground when he forgot his player's pass, insulting the royal family, theft from team-mates, drunkenness, stealing a car, parking his car in someone else's space, or that Barnes had lampooned the board in the narration accompanying the home movies he made of the 1948 tour. In later years, a file of unknown authorship regarding Barnes's behaviour was deposited in the NSWCA library. It accused Barnes of allowing young spectators to enter the playing arena to field the ball instead of doing so himself, and of denigrating umpires by cupping his hands over his eyes and showing dissent by implying that they were blind.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the library}} had {{a cache of}} books waiting for the {{completion}} and grand opening that was provided by local residents and schools, as Carnegie's gift for the construction did not cover the initial costs of new books. A call was also put out for citizens to donate books to the new facility to expand the collection. In 1907, the Seattle Public Library {{took control of the}} Carnegie library, when Ballard was annexed by the neighboring City of Seattle government. Early Scandinavian immigrants to Ballard and the Pacific Northwest in particular made use of the new facility; Ballard as an area has a strong historical presence of Scandinavian people. Early in the library's existence, it had a <b>turnstile</b> at the entrance to its book stacks, to count the number of book borrowers that passed through. With the arrival of World War I, the Carnegie Library became home to various community activities, such as dispensing information on the war, and also provided Red Cross and English language classes. In 1942, during World War II, one of the first African American librarians in Seattle, Lucille Smith, was assigned to the Carnegie library.|$|E
5|$|The 2009 Chick-fil-A Bowl {{kicked off}} at 7:37 p.m. EST on December 31, 2009, in the Georgia Dome, Atlanta, Georgia. Bowl {{officials}} announced 73,777 people attended the game, but that figure {{was based on}} the number of tickets sold rather than actual <b>turnstile</b> attendance. That attendance figure was the fourth-largest in Chick-fil-A Bowl history, including when the game was known as the Peach Bowl, and it was the 13th consecutive sellout for the game. The game was broadcast in the United States by ESPN, and was watched by an estimated 4.87 million people, earning it a Nielsen Rating of 4.2. That figure was the 10th highest among bowl games that season, and was a 36 percent increase from the previous year's rating. The sportscasters for the broadcast were Sean McDonough, Matt Millen, and Holly Rowe. Because the game was played indoors, weather was not a factor.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Turnstiles</b> {{are used}} to obstruct invalid access. Since most fare-dodgers know how to pass a gate without paying, <b>turnstiles</b> may be {{replaced}} with ticket barriers in a less easily transversed form, or may be integrated more closely with an electronic ticket system.|$|R
40|$|We present {{measurements}} on hybrid single-electron <b>turnstiles</b> with superconducting leads contacting a normal island (SINIS).

50|$|The {{next two}} {{staircases}} {{go up to}} a mezzanine leading to fare control that has a powder blue and state blue trim line. A bank of three regular <b>turnstiles</b> and two high entry/exit <b>turnstiles</b> provide entrance/exit from the station {{and there is no}} token booth. Two staircases go up to either eastern corners of 14th Street and Sixth Avenue. Another unstaffed bank of <b>turnstiles</b> by the northeast staircase leads to the mezzanine above the Queens-bound platform of 14th Street on the IND.|$|R
