5|$|In Liverpool, at 8:30 am on 17 May, Saturday, {{the twins}} went into St Anne Street Police Station to report {{concerns}} over Sabina's children. At midday the pair boarded a National Express coach to London. A police report {{stated that the}} twins suddenly disembarked from the coach at Keele services, a motorway service station, as they were not feeling well. The driver of the coach, however, said he left them at Keele services after becoming suspicious of their behaviour. He noticed the twins clinging tightly to their bags and did not let them re-board because they refused to let him search their bags for illegal items. The manager of the service station was informed and, also feeling suspicious of the pair, called the police. Officers arrived to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> but left after deeming the women harmless.|$|E
5|$|The B-class {{boats were}} deemed {{redundant}} once more capable submarines arrived in early 1915 and most returned to Malta. B6 and B11, however, {{were sent to}} Alexandria where they conducted patrols along the Libyan coast to prevent arms deliveries to rebellious tribesmen. During one incident on 16 August 1915 a party of Arabs and officers in European uniforms were spotted displaying a flag of truce. The two submarines anchored and Lieutenant Holbrook was rowed ashore to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> They opened fire, killing one man and wounding three, including Holbrook. The submarines were soon withdrawn from this task as they were totally unsuitable for this duty, lacking any deck armament at all.|$|E
5|$|Jack Donaghy, who is Vice President of East Coast Television and Microwave Oven Programming for General Electric, {{makes an}} {{appearance}} on the fictional CNBC show The Hot Box. During the appearance, Jack interacts with the show's host, Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks), with the two flirting during the broadcast. Avery and Jack share Republican viewpoints, and she asks him out for a drink after the show, which he accepts. They eventually embark {{on a number of}} both successful and unsuccessful dates. During one of those dates, Jack invites her to a TGS VIP party he has hastily staged, whereupon he enlists the help of Jon Bon Jovi—at the time NBC's real-life Artist in Residence—to come over and <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> in an effort to impress the successful Avery. When Bon Jovi approaches them, though, Jack disregards him due to his own intriguing conversation with Avery, which impresses her even more. After the TGS party, the two go back to Jack's apartment and end up sleeping together.|$|E

25|$|The Buddha lived not in seclusion, {{but among}} people. Every day he walked barefoot to villages {{to beg for}} food. When he met a farmer, he used {{examples}} from farming {{to talk about the}} meaning of life. No matter who he met—a butcher, a prostitute, a bandit, a slave, a scholar, or a child---he would <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> according to their temperament and intellectual faculty, to inspire them a little and alleviate their suffering.|$|E

Barton, along with several other women, personally provided clothing, food, and supplies for the sick and wounded soldiers. She learned how to store and distribute medical supplies and offered emotional support to the soldiers by keeping their spirits high. She would read books to them, write letters to their families for them, <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> and support them.|$|E
25|$|He {{developed}} a reputation as being very friendly with children. He carried candy in his pockets for the street urchins in Mantua and Venice, and taught catechism to them. During papal audiences, he would gather children around him and <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> about things that interested them. His weekly catechism lessons {{in the courtyard of}} San Damaso in the Vatican always included a special place for children, and his decision to require the Confraternity of Christian Doctrine in every parish was partly motivated by a desire to reclaim children from religious ignorance.|$|E
25|$|In 1929 the English Folk Dance Society {{held its}} Easter Vacation School on the Isle of Man. Assuming that no Manx folk dance had survived {{into the modern}} day, the Society asked Douglas instead to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> on local folk song. However, Douglas was able to pull {{together}} various notes on Manx dance into a form fit to {{be presented to the}} Society. Through the assistance of teachers and pupils at Albert Road School in Ramsey, Douglas was able to have three of these reconstructed dances performed: 'The Manx Dirk Dance', 'Hyndaa yn Bwoailley' and 'Eunyssagh Vona'.|$|E

25|$|When evening comes, I go back home, {{and go to}} my study. On the threshold, I {{take off}} my work clothes, covered in mud and filth, and I put on the clothes an {{ambassador}} would wear. Decently dressed, I enter the ancient courts of rulers who have long since died. There, I am warmly welcomed, and I feed on the only food I find nourishing and was born to savour. I am not ashamed to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> {{and ask them to}} explain their actions and they, out of kindness, answer me. Four hours go by without my feeling any anxiety. I forget every worry. I am no longer afraid of poverty or frightened of death. I live entirely through them.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have tested}} the {{difference}} between what men and women can recall after a presentation. Three speakers were involved, one being female and two being male. Men and women were put into the same lecture hall and had the same speaker <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> The results suggested that information presented by the women speaker was more easily recalled by {{all the members of the}} study. Researchers believe this to be a significant difference between genders because women's voices have better acoustics, ranging from low tones to high tones. Since their voices have this range, semantic encoding is increased for the pitches that stimulate the auditory component of the brain; this resonates better in the ear function. Since pitch ranges from low tones to high tones, it draws people's attention to the words attributed with the tone. As the tone changes, words stand out and from these differences memories can be stored. Recall is made easier since the association the brain can make is between words and sounds spoken.|$|E
500|$|Several {{journalists have}} {{commented on the}} {{apparent}} conflict between the group's sexualized and often violent lyrics and their stated spiritual message. In a June 2010 interview with The Columbians Alan Sculley, Bruce explained, [...] " [...] the stuff that {{people are talking about}} on the streets...to get attention, you have to speak their language. You have to interest them, gain their trust, <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> and show you're one of them. You're a person from the street and speak of your experiences. Then at the end you can tell them God has helped me out like this and it might transfer over instead of just come straight out and just speak straight out of religion".|$|E

500|$|Obviously we knew {{people were}} going to totally sensationalize it. They're {{beautiful}} girls, the scene is hot—I'm not afraid to say that. There is a sexual energy between the girls which is kind of authentic, because I know when I was a teen-aged girl, the friendships that I had with other girls were almost romantic, they were so intense. I wanted to sleep at my friend's house every night, I wanted to wear her clothes, we would talk on the phone until our ears ached. I wanted to capture that heightened feeling you get as an adolescent that you don't really feel as a grownup. (laughs) You like [...] friends when you're a grownup, but you don't need to sleep in the same bed with them and <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> on the phone until 5 a.m. every night.|$|E
500|$|Young Richard {{attended}} East Whittier Elementary School, {{where he}} was president of his eighth-grade class. His parents believed that attending Whittier High School had caused Richard's older brother Harold to live a dissolute lifestyle before he fell ill of tuberculosis (he died of the disease in 1933), and so they sent Richard to the larger Fullerton Union High School. He had to ride a school bus for an hour each way during his freshman year, and he received excellent grades. Later, he lived with an aunt in Fullerton during the week. He played junior varsity football, and seldom missed a practice, even though he was rarely used in games. He had greater success as a debater, winning a number of championships and taking his only formal tutelage in public speaking from Fullerton's Head of English, H. Lynn Sheller. Nixon later remembered Sheller's words, [...] "Remember, speaking is conversation... don't shout at people. <b>Talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> Converse with them." [...] Nixon stated that he tried to use the conversational tone as much as possible.|$|E
500|$|Zack Handlen, {{who watched}} the episode for The A.V. Club, thought that the [...] "hard sci-fi" [...] worked well as it was an area that The Original Series never went near. He thought that the story was {{different}} enough from [...] "The Devil in the Dark"—although the Horta was silicon based, {{it was at least}} easily recognisable as an alien creature. [...] "This makes it less exciting as a creature, but more intriguing as an idea," [...] Handlen argues. While he felt that the episode was a [...] "winner", he conceded that it was [...] "a bit on the dry side". James Hunt, whilst writing for the website Den of Geek, noted that the Enterprise fought a space-bound crystalline entity several episodes earlier in [...] "Datalore", which he considered [...] "a lot more impressive than these crystal microbrains...Okay, it wouldn't <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> but nor did it die the moment someone switched the frickin' lights off." [...] He felt that [...] "Home Soil" [...] was a generic Star Trek episode and thought that it was similar to The Original Series in tone.|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, Ron (Nick Offerman) {{deals with}} {{complaints}} from local residents {{due to a}} new town policy requiring public officials to deal more directly to the public. Ron calls the policy [...] "my hell", and seeks a new assistant {{to protect him from}} the citizens. Tom (Aziz Ansari) volunteers to find Ron an assistant, but during job interviews he asks questions about [...] "real-world expertise", such as what tie he should wear to the club and what to text girls after a party. Tom brings forward a fast-talking candidate named Jean-Ralphio (Ben Schwartz), whose personality closely resembles Tom's. Ron hates him right away. April (Aubrey Plaza) draws attention around the office for showing up late and slacking off at work. Bored with her internship, April insists she cannot wait to leave the parks department. However, after spending time with Andy at the town hall shoeshine stand where he works, April decides she wants to stay closer to him and volunteers to be Ron's assistant. She also convinces Andy to sell his band's CDs at the hall, which proves successful. When she slams the door on Tom while he tries to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> Ron immediately hires her.|$|E
500|$|According to John Brousseau, the bad {{publicity}} led to {{reforms of the}} Hole. Its inmates were allowed to sleep in proper beds in the [...] "Berthing" [...] quarters elsewhere in the compound. Brousseau describes their new seven-days-a-week routine starting when [...] "they got up, showered, {{then went to the}} dining hall at 9:30. They had 30 minutes for breakfast. Then they walked up to the Hole. They sat down at desks. I have no clue what work they did. They worked until 12:30 or 1 pm. Then they were marched back to the dining hall and had 30 minutes for lunch. Then they were marched back to the Hole and were there until 6 pm." [...] After a 30-minute dinner, they were taken to the study hall and stayed there [...] "for two and a half hours, until about 9:30. Then they went to the Hole again to wrap up their day. At 11 or midnight, they'd get marched back to Berthing." [...] Some of the restrictions on contacting people outside the Hole were also said to have been eased. However, other Church staff were still encouraged to avoid contact with the inmates: [...] "You didn't <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> you looked the other way, you'd leave the area if you saw them, it's like the black plague." [...] Brousseau commented: [...] "You stayed away from these people. They're considered the worst of the worst." ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{the film}} is not {{essentially}} experimental, at several points it undermines the narrative reality. James Bernardoni notes Allen's way of opening the film by facing the camera, which immediately intrudes upon audience involvement in the film. In one famous scene, Allen's character, in line {{to see a movie}} with Annie, listens to a man behind him deliver misinformed pontifications on the significance of Fellini's and Marshall McLuhan's work. Allen pulls McLuhan himself from just off camera to personally correct the man's errors. Later in the film, when we see Annie and Alvy in their first extended talk, [...] "mental subtitles" [...] convey to the audience the characters' nervous inner doubts. An animated scene—with artwork based on the comic strip Inside Woody Allen—depicts Alvy and Annie in the guise of the Wicked Queen from Snow White. Although Allen uses each of these techniques only once, the [...] "fourth wall" [...] is broken several other times when characters address the camera directly. In one, Alvy stops several passers-by to ask questions about love, and in another he shrugs off writing a happy ending to his relationship with Annie in his autobiographical first play as forgivable [...] "wish-fulfillment." [...] Allen chose to have Alvy break the fourth wall, he explained, [...] "because I felt many {{of the people in the}} audience had the same feelings and the same problems. I wanted to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> directly and confront them." ...|$|E
