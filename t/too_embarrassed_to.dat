5|$|Hippopotamuses {{have been}} the {{subjects}} of various African folktales. According to a San story; when the Creator assigned each animal its place in nature, the hippos {{wanted to live in}} the water, but were refused out of fear that they might eat all the fish. After begging and pleading, the hippos were finally allowed to live in the water on the conditions that they would eat grass instead of fish and would fling their dung {{so that it can be}} inspected for fish bones. In a Ndebele tale, the hippo originally had long, beautiful hair, but was set on fire by a jealous hare and had to jump into a nearby pool. The hippo lost most of his hair and was <b>too</b> <b>embarrassed</b> <b>to</b> leave the water.|$|E
5|$|One {{scene that}} von Stroheim re-shot at the studio's insistence {{depicted}} a younger McTeague in his apprenticeship with Potter. In the scene McTeague is <b>too</b> <b>embarrassed</b> <b>to</b> examine {{the teeth of}} a young woman and Potter has to take over. A thinly disguised ZaSu Pitts portrayed the woman so that the audience would see a resemblance to Trina, but the studio insisted that the scene was confusing and von Stroheim agreed to re-shoot it. Von Stroheim also conceded his original vision when shooting the bar confrontation between McTeague and Schouler. The director wanted to have a knife thrower actually throw a real knife at Gibson Gowland's head. Von Stroheim was overruled by Gowland himself, who refused to allow such a dangerous stunt. A special-effect shot was used instead.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the overall}} Vietnamese {{military}} performance {{was not as}} successful as Định's guerrilla activities. On June 5, 1862, Định broke with the Nguyễn army after the court's plenipotentiary Phan Thanh Giản and another official, Lam Duy Hiep, signed the Treaty of Saigon. This agreement ceded the three southern provinces of Gia Định, Định Tường and Biên Hòa to France; they became the colony of Cochinchina. The treaty was accompanied by financial payments to France, religious concessions to missionaries and commercial opportunities for European merchants. Militarily, {{the withdrawal of the}} Nguyễn army deprived the resistance of the logistical support that could be provided by a regular force. It also permitted the French to concentrate their efforts against a single antagonist. Politically, the treaty provided, for those Vietnamese who needed one, a legal basis to collaborate with the French on Cochinchinese soil. As a result, the colonial forces found it easier to recruit militia and administrative personnel among Vietnamese who had been too afraid or <b>too</b> <b>embarrassed</b> <b>to</b> serve the French openly before the 1862 treaty. Định then allied himself with Võ Duy Dương to form the Movement of Popular Self Defense (Phong Trao Nhan Dan Tu Ve), creating an operations base in Đồng Tháp.|$|E

50|$|In Egypt, {{adolescent}} SRH {{education is}} controversial and is opposed by some parents, religious and community leaders, policymakers, service providers, {{and young people}} due to social taboos {{and the belief that}} these issues are <b>too</b> <b>embarrassing</b> <b>to</b> discuss in public. The lack of continuity within the society leads to school-based or home-based SRH education to be insufficient in either the amount of information and/or the accuracy of that information. This obviously creates a challenge for young Egyptians, ages 10-29 which compose 40 percent of the Egyptian population, to attain important and accurate SRH information to stay healthy and safe.|$|R
5000|$|The 10-item Self-Concealment Scale (SCS) {{measures}} {{the degree to}} which a person tends to conceal personal information perceived as negative or distressing. The SCS has proven to have excellent psychometric properties (internal consistency and test-retest reliability) and unidimensionality. Representative items include: [...] "I have an important secret that I haven't shared with anyone", [...] "There are lots of things about me that I keep to myself", [...] "Some of my secrets have really tormented me", [...] "When something bad happens to me, I tend to keep it to myself", and [...] "My secrets are <b>too</b> <b>embarrassing</b> <b>to</b> share with others".|$|R

Determined to win and retire with his title intact, Louis signed on for a rematch. On June 25, 1948, about 42,000 people came to Yankee Stadium to see the aging champion, who weighed 213½, the heaviest of his career to date. Walcott knocked Louis down in the third round, but Louis survived to knock out Walcott in the eleventh.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of Ghanaian women deliver {{at home with}} a traditional birth attendant and are referred to the hospital in cases of complicated labor. Although most deliveries are attended by a traditional birth attendant, most women prefer to deliver with a health professional. Barriers to obtaining professional health care include high costs, inadequate transportation, long distances to health care facilities, and poor road conditions. Some women were also <b>too</b> <b>embarrassed</b> <b>to</b> go to a hospital because they did not have nice clothes and preferred to deliver at home where no one could see that they were poor.|$|E

5000|$|... === u+me=we === u+me=we was an {{education}} and awareness programme that empowered children and youth to actively engage in the issues surrounding HIV and AIDS. It included 3 specifically tailored workshops and used art to allow participants to creatively learn and express their ideas and reactions. Working through schools, community centres and other groups serving vulnerable children, AC-AF provided a safe environment where children could ask the questions that they otherwise found <b>too</b> <b>embarrassing</b> <b>to</b> ask. In Tanzania, Workshop 1 & 2 involved two intensive workshops that provided information about HIV and AIDS.

25|$|Many {{respondents}} who {{never used the}} library cited embarrassment or {{lack of knowledge about}} available information as reasons. Even those that did frequent the library often said that they were <b>too</b> <b>embarrassed</b> <b>to</b> ask for help; many expected shocked reactions or outright homophobia from librarians. Some common complaints about library collections from those who did use them were that information was negative, outdated or difficult to find. Whitt concluded that more staff training was needed to address these perceptions. She also found that those {{respondents who}} regularly used a college or university library had a more positive experience finding needed information than those who used only the public library.|$|E
25|$|Yonakor {{grew up in}} the Dorchester {{neighborhood}} of Boston, Massachusetts, the youngest son of immigrants from lithuania. At the age of 10, he came down with a leg infection after cutting himself while ice skating. He was <b>too</b> <b>embarrassed</b> <b>to</b> tell his mother about the injury and hoped it would go away, but it worsened {{to the point where he}} could no longer walk. Doctors drained fluid from his body by puncturing his toe, and Yonakor spent a year as an invalid; doctors told him he may never walk again. Starting out by crawling, however, Yonakor gradually regained his strength and his health. He went on to play three seasons of football at Mechanic Arts High School, and spent one year at Marianapolis Preparatory School in Thompson, Connecticut at the prompting of Frank Leahy, then the head football coach at Boston College. Yonakor was set to go to Boston College, but chose the University of Notre Dame instead when Leahy became head football coach there in 1941.|$|E

40|$|Interaction {{techniques}} that require users to adopt new behaviors mean that designers {{must take into}} account social acceptability and user experience otherwise the techniques may be rejected by users as they are <b>too</b> <b>embarrassing</b> <b>to</b> do in public. This research uses a set of low cost prototypes to study social acceptability and user perceptions of multimodal mobile interaction techniques early on in the design process. We describe 4 prototypes that were used with 8 focus groups to evaluate user perceptions of novel multimodal interactions using gesture, speech and nonspeech sounds, and gain feedback about the usefulness of the prototypes for studying social acceptability. The results of this research describe user perceptions of social acceptability and the realities of using multimodal interaction techniques in daily life. The results also describe key differences between young users (18 - 29) and older users (70 - 95) with respect to approach to understanding and preference of these interaction techniques...|$|R
60|$|To a {{man like}} Hilary-for whom running after women had been about the last {{occupation}} in the world, who had, in fact, always fought shy of them and imagined that they would always fight shy of him--there was an unusual enticement and dismay in the feeling that a young girl really was pursuing him. It was at once too good, too unlikely, and <b>too</b> <b>embarrassing</b> <b>to</b> be true. His sudden feeling for her was the painful sensation of one who sees a ripe nectarine hanging within reach. He dreamed continually of stretching out his hand, {{and so he did}} not dare, or thought he did not dare, to pass that way. All this did not favour the tenor of a studious, introspective life; it also brought a sense of unreality which made him avoid his best friends. This, partly, was why Stephen came to see him one Sunday, his other reason for the visit being the calculation that Hughs would be released on the following Wednesday.|$|R

40|$|Twitter is {{a popular}} microblogging service where users create status {{messages}} (called “tweets”). These tweets sometimes express opinions about different topics; and are presented to the user in a chronological order. This format of presentation is useful to the user since the latest tweets from are rich on recent news which is generally more interesting than tweets about an event that occurred long time back. Merely, presenting tweets in a chronological order may be <b>too</b> <b>embarrassing</b> <b>to</b> the user, especially if he has many followers. Therefore, {{there is a need}} to separate the tweets into different categories and then present the categories to the user. Nowadays Text Categorization (TC) becomes more significant especially for the Arabic language which is one of the most complex languages. In this paper, in order to improve the accuracy of tweets categorization a system based on Rough Set Theory is proposed for enrichment the document’s representation.

50|$|Adolescents {{may lack}} {{knowledge}} of, or access to, conventional methods of preventing pregnancy, {{as they may}} be <b>too</b> <b>embarrassed</b> or frightened <b>to</b> seek such information. Contraception for teenagers presents a huge challenge for the clinician. In 1998, the government of the United Kingdom set a target to halve the under-18 pregnancy rate by 2010. The Teenage Pregnancy Strategy (TPS) was established to achieve this. The pregnancy rate in this group, although falling, rose slightly in 2007, to 41.7 per 1000 women. Young women often think of contraception either as 'the pill' or condoms and have little knowledge about other methods. They are heavily influenced by negative, second-hand stories about methods of contraception from their friends and the media. Prejudices are extremely difficult to overcome. Over concern about side-effects, for example weight gain and acne, often affect choice. Missing up to three pills a month is common, and in this age group the figure is likely to be higher. Restarting after the pill-free week, having to hide pills, drug interactions and difficulty getting repeat prescriptions can all lead to method failure.|$|R
2500|$|Fecal {{incontinence}} {{has three}} main consequences: [...] local {{reactions of the}} perianal skin and urinary tract, including maceration (softening and whitening of skin due to continuous moisture), urinary tract infections, or decubitus ulcers (pressure sores); a financial expense for individuals (due to cost of medication and incontinence products, and loss of productivity), employers (days off), and medical insurers and society generally (health care costs, unemployment); and an associated decrease in quality of life. There is often reduced self-esteem, shame, humiliation, depression, a need to organize life around easy access to bathroom and avoidance of enjoyable activities. FI {{is an example of}} a stigmatized medical condition, which creates barriers to successful management.

In other experiments where people were given LSD without their knowledge, they were interrogated under bright lights with doctors in the background taking notes. The subjects were told that their [...] "trips" [...] would be extended indefinitely if they refused to reveal their secrets. The people being interrogated this way were CIA employees, U.S. military personnel, and agents suspected of working {{for the other side}} in the Cold War. Long-term debilitation and several deaths reportedly resulted from this. Heroin addicts were bribed into taking LSD with offers of more heroin.|$|E

25|$|The last {{murder to}} involve Gravano was {{the murder of}} Louie DiBono, the made man Gravano had {{threatened}} to kill earlier. Gravano described {{the reasons for the}} murder in Underboss: He was still robbing the family and I asked for permission to take him out. But John had a meeting with DiBono, and DiBono told John that he had a billion dollars of drywall work that was coming out of the World Trade Center. John bit, hook, line and sinker, and refused my request. John said he would handle DiBono personally and become his partner. But DiBono was up to his old tricks double-dealing. He had obviously been bullshitting John. So when John called Louie in for meetings to discuss their new partnership, DiBono didn't show up. John was humiliated. This meant an automatic death penalty. John gave the contract to DiBono's captain, Pat Conte. Conte botched an ideal opportunity to kill DiBono. Then, as Gotti grew increasingly impatient, Conte explained that the problem now was trying to corner DiBono again. Whenever a meeting with him was arranged, DiBono never appeared. It was a joke, what was going on. I couldn't help laughing to myself. I told John why didn't Pat simplify everything. Just call Louie up and tell him to hang himself. Ten months went by. John looks like an asshole. He was <b>too</b> <b>embarrassed</b> even <b>to</b> ask me for help.|$|R
40|$|Abstract−To solve crimes, {{investigators}} often rely {{on interviews}} with witnesses, victims, or criminals themselves. The interviews are transcribed and the pertinent data is contained in narrative form. To solve one crime, investigators may need to interview multiple people and then analyze the narrative reports. There are several difficulties with this process: interviewing people is time consuming, the interviews – sometimes conducted by multiple officers – need to be combined, and the resulting information may still be incomplete. For example, victims or witnesses are often <b>too</b> scared or <b>embarrassed</b> <b>to</b> report or prefer to remain anonymous. We are developing an online reporting system that combines natural language processing with insights from the cognitive interview approach to obtain more information from witnesses and victims. We report here on information extraction from police and witness narratives. We achieved high precision, 94 % and 96 %, and recall, 85 % and 90 %, for both narrative types...|$|R
40|$|Questions {{people ask}} reveal {{not only the}} gaps of knowledge, but also reveal their {{existing}} attitudes and ideas and personal problems (Arya and Bennett 1973). This study examined health care questions from an unusual data set: 1252 unsolicited letters written over a three–year period to an advice column in an East African newspaper. Analysis of the letters was a non-intrusive method of ascertaining prevalent health questions and opinions. People wrote seeking information, advice, solutions, and reassurance about health problems. Emotions expressed in the letters ranged from hope to fear and frustration. The written format allowed questions which are generally <b>too</b> <b>embarrassing</b> or stigmatized <b>to</b> present in other public or interpersonal settings. More than half the total letters raised questions about sexual behaviour, sexually transmitted diseases, and HIV/AIDS. The letters present not only personal health concerns, but also expectations of health-care quality and reflections on the medical options presently available in Uganda. As a whole, the letters express dissatisfaction {{not only with the}} outcomes of health encounters, but with the process. Of the letter writers with specific physical complaints, more than one-third had already sought medical care and were dissatisfied with th...|$|R
