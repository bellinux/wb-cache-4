5|$|Overseeing {{the visual}} effects {{department}} for New Moon was Susan MacLeod, {{who had previously}} worked with Weitz during the production of The Golden Compass. MacLeod enlisted Tippett Studio to create the computer generated wolves, while Prime Focus of Vancouver handled {{the effects of the}} vampires. To prepare for the aggressive task of making the wolves look real, <b>Tippet</b> artists studied wolf culture. They also were able to reflect leadership and human muscle size by adjusting certain features of the wolves, such as their fat and tallness. In February 2009, a group of artists were able to travel to Wolf Mountain Sanctuary, outside of Los Angeles, and see real wolves. The artists were able to observe the behavior of both the timber and arctic wolves, who ran in packs of three to five. The idea was to give everyone a deeper feeling of the creature that they were creating.|$|E

25|$|Historically, Anglican clergy have {{vested in}} cassock, {{surplice}} and <b>tippet</b> for Morning and Evening Prayer, while bishops wear the rochet and chimere. In some monastic communities and Anglo-Catholic parishes, the officiant wears surplice or alb, stole and cope when Evensong is celebrated solemnly.|$|E

25|$|These rods {{are used}} to fish for smaller species, they provide more sport with larger fish, or to enable fishing with lighter line and smaller lures. Though the term is {{commonly}} {{used to refer to}} spinning or spin-cast rods and tackle, fly rods in smaller line weights (size #0–#3) have also long been utilized for ultra-light fishing, as well as to protect the thin-diameter, lightweight end section of leader, or <b>tippet,</b> used in this type of angling.|$|E
25|$|These {{problems}} came in {{the midst}} of a transfer of power at AMC from Paul <b>Tippet</b> to a French executive, Pierre Semerena. The new management responded with tactical moves by selling the lawn care Wheel Horse Products Division and signing an agreement to build Jeeps in the People's Republic of China. The Pentagon had problems with AM General, a significant defense contractor, being managed by a partially French-government-owned firm. The U.S. government would not allow a foreign government to own a significant portion of an important defense supplier. As a result, the profitable AM General Division was sold. Another milestone was the departure of Dick Teague: AMC's design vice president for 26 years, he was responsible for many Jeep and AMC designs including the Rambler American, Javelin, Hornet, Gremlin, Pacer, and Matador coupe.|$|E

The catch exceeded the then-previous record of three pounds, six ounces made on the same size <b>tippet</b> back in 1986.

2500|$|Readers when officiating often wear a blue <b>tippet,</b> or, in the United States, a black <b>tippet</b> {{displaying}} {{the arms of}} the diocese. At the Eucharist, it may be more fitting for readers of Scripture to wear street clothing to emphasize the role of the laity in recent versions of the Prayer Book. However, in some parishes readers wear the traditional vestments of the subdeacon at High Mass: alb fastened with a white cincture and a tunicle. [...] In other parishes they wear the cassock and surplice, as do members of the choir.|$|E

2500|$|Chaplains in the Armed Forces wear tippets with officially sanctioned badges and any medals {{they have}} achieved. A bishop or priest may wear a <b>tippet</b> with {{the arms of}} the seminary from which he or she {{received}} their degree. In England some cathedral clergy wear tippets on which is embroidered the distinctive symbol or cathedral coat of arms. [...] Members of the high church or Anglo-Catholic parts of the church sometimes wear choir dress of a more Roman Catholic style, including a shorter surplice (or cotta), a stole (and sometimes a biretta), excluding hood and <b>tippet.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The cassock {{is almost}} {{invariably}} black for priests and deacons. A traditional Anglican cassock is double-breasted, being buttoned {{on the shoulder}} rather than up the front (there may be a single button sewn {{to the center of}} the chest used to fasten the academic hood if worn). Many Anglican clergy, especially (though not exclusively) those within the catholic tradition of Anglicanism, prefer to wear the Latin single-breasted cassock. The cassock is worn with a cincture, which may take the form of a cloth sash resembling a fascia, or a simple rope girdle or leather belt. Over this is worn the surplice, which is longer and fuller than that worn by Roman Catholic clergy, sometimes reaching well below the knees. Traditionally, an academic hood is worn around the shoulders and down the back, along with a black <b>tippet</b> or scarf worn around the nape and hanging straight down in front. The hood and <b>tippet</b> were once a single garment called an almuce. (The <b>tippet</b> is not to be confused with the stole, which is also worn in a similar manner, but is not part of choir dress, being worn at the Eucharist and other sacramental services.) Some clergy also wear Geneva bands (or [...] "preaching tabs") from their collars. [...] Though not worn at service-time, the Canterbury cap is the traditional headgear of Church of England clergy; some prefer the biretta (see below) or mortar board. [...] Neither is widely worn, although the cap, with cassock, gown and <b>tippet,</b> was specified in English canon law as part of the [...] "outdoor habit" [...] or [...] "house dress" [...] of the clergy until the promulgation of new canons in the 1960s. [...] At some periods of history a black gown, either academic or 'Genevan', was worn for Morning and Evening Prayer instead of the surplice which was reserved for use at the Holy Communion - the cassock, bands, gown, academic hood and <b>tippet</b> still being the normal liturgical costume for ordained minister of the Church of Scotland and other Reformed and Presbyterian churches.|$|E
50|$|Terminal {{fly fishing}} tackle connects the fly {{line to the}} {{artificial}} fly. This is typically a tapered or level ‘’leader’’ with a ‘’tippet’’ section. Other terminal tackle may include small ‘’strike indicators’’ or weights added to the leader to assist in strike detection and presentation. The leader is a section of fishing line that is attached directly {{to the end of}} the fly line. The ‘’tippet’’ section is a section of fishing line attached to the leader to which the artificial fly is attached. Leaders and <b>tippets</b> play a key role in the presentations of the fly to the fish and the subsequent landing of a fish when caught. Leaders and <b>tippets</b> are generally constructed of monofilament or fluorocarbon fishing line. In some fly fishing situations involving toothy fish, <b>tippets</b> are constructed of braided or single strand stainless steel wire.|$|R
