5|$|The RNA genome {{consists}} {{of at least}} seven structural landmarks (LTR, TAR, RRE, PE, SLIP, CRS, and INS), and nine genes (gag, pol, and env, <b>tat,</b> rev, nef, vif, vpr, vpu, and sometimes a tenth tev, which is a fusion of <b>tat</b> env and rev), encoding 19 proteins. Three of these genes, gag, pol, and env, contain information {{needed to make the}} structural proteins for new virus particles. For example, env codes for a protein called gp160 that is cut in two by a cellular protease to form gp120 and gp41. The six remaining genes, <b>tat,</b> rev, nef, vif, vpr, and vpu (or vpx in the case of HIV-2), are regulatory genes for proteins that control the ability of HIV to infect cells, produce new copies of virus (replicate), or cause disease.|$|E
5|$|During {{the evening}} of March 17, General <b>Tat</b> {{organised}} a counter-attack against the enemy's 9th Battalion with support from fighter-bombers, tanks and artillery, but his troops were repeatedly beaten back {{in their attempt to}} keep the road open. By the early hours of March 18, the entire North Vietnamese 64th Regiment had blocked all the routes around Tuna Pass, while the 48th Regiment and elements of the North Vietnamese 968th Infantry Division began closing in on Cheo Reo from three directions. In the afternoon, Phu sent the 25th Ranger Battalion and the 2nd Armoured Cavalry Brigade to reopen Route 7. At the same time the North Vietnamese 675th Artillery Regiment began shelling the main South Vietnamese column in Cheo Reo as three infantry regiments attacked the convoy from all sides. Unfortunately for the South Vietnamese, all their attempts to organise strong resistance were stifled by the chaos created by North Vietnamese artillery bombardments. At 3pm, General <b>Tat</b> was ordered to destroy all heavy weaponry so the North Vietnamese could not make use of it. About 30minutes later, a UH-1 helicopter landed on the grounds of Phu Bon primary school to pick up <b>Tat</b> and flew off to Nha Trang. At 9am on March 19, all South Vietnamese soldiers in the district of Cheo Reo stopped fighting. The 6th Ranger Battalion and the 19th Armoured Cavalry Squadron became the only units to arrive at their destination at Cung Son with only light casualties.|$|E
5|$|The {{body was}} re-cremated during the funeral, but Đức's heart {{remained}} intact {{and did not}} burn. It {{was considered to be}} holy and placed in a glass chalice at Xá Lợi Pagoda. The intact heart relic is regarded as a symbol of compassion. Đức has subsequently been revered by Vietnamese Buddhists as a bodhisattva (Bồ <b>Tát),</b> and accordingly is often referred to in Vietnamese as Bồ <b>Tát</b> Thích Quảng Đức. On 21 August, the ARVN Special Forces of Nhu attacked Xá Lợi and other Buddhist pagodas across Vietnam. The secret police intended to confiscate Đức's ashes, but two monks had escaped with the urn, jumping over the back fence and finding safety at the U.S. Operations Mission next door. Nhu's men managed to confiscate Đức's charred heart.|$|E
50|$|A form of <b>tatting</b> called Takashima <b>Tatting,</b> {{invented by}} Toshiko Takashima, exists in Japan. Takashima <b>Tatting</b> uses a custom needle with a hook on one end.

5000|$|Cro-tatting {{combines}} needle <b>tatting</b> with crochet. The cro-tatting tool is a <b>tatting</b> needle with a {{crochet hook}} at the end. One can also cro-tat with a bullion crochet hook {{or a very}} straight crochet hook. In the 19th century, [...] "crochet tatting" [...] patterns were published which simply called for a crochet hook. One of the earliest patterns is for a crocheted afghan with <b>tatted</b> rings forming a raised design. [...] Patterns are available in English and are equally divided between yarn and thread. In its most basic form, the rings are <b>tatted</b> with a length of plain thread between them, as in single-shuttle <b>tatting.</b> In modern patterns, {{beginning in the early}} 20th century, the rings are <b>tatted</b> and the arches or chains are crocheted. Many people consider cro-tatting more difficult than crochet or needle <b>tatting.</b> Some <b>tatting</b> instructors recommend using a <b>tatting</b> needle and a crochet hook to work cro-tatting patterns. Stitches of cro-tatting (and needle <b>tatting</b> before a ring is closed) unravel easily, unlike <b>tatting</b> made with a shuttle.|$|R
5|$|After the {{briefing}} Phu immediately {{returned to his}} headquarters in Pleiku, where he began planning for the withdrawal with Brigadier Generals Tran Van Cam, Pham Ngoc Sang, Pham Duy <b>Tat,</b> and Colonel Le Khac Ly. To maintain secrecy, Phu ordered his officers to issue orders using only word of mouth instead of written documents, and not to reveal the withdrawal plan to local regional forces. Furthermore, he stated that the abandonment of II Corps Tactical Zone had to be quick, with the army taking only enough military equipment and ammunition to fight one last battle. Generals <b>Tat</b> and Cam were assigned the task of supervising the movements of soldiers and their dependents on the ground. Sang {{was responsible for the}} movement of vital military equipment and supplies via air transport and to sweep Route 7 using air force fighter-bombers. Ly was ordered to lead a group of combat engineers to repair the road and bridges on Route 7, as well as maintain contact with the ARVN 2nd Brigade Headquarters in Nha Trang. The plan was destined to fail, as Phu was unaware that General Ngo Quang Truong, commander of I Corps Tactical Zone, had also received similar orders to evacuate.|$|E
5|$|Commercially, the {{radioactive}} isotope bismuth-213 {{can be produced}} by bombarding radium with bremsstrahlung photons from a linear particle accelerator. In 1997, an antibody conjugate with bismuth-213, which has a 45-minute half-life and decays with the emission of an alpha particle, was used to treat patients with leukemia. This isotope has also been tried in cancer treatment, for example, in the targeted alpha therapy (<b>TAT)</b> program.|$|E
5|$|During viral replication, the {{integrated}} DNA provirus is transcribed into RNA, {{some of which}} then undergo RNA splicing to produce mature mRNAs. These mRNAs are exported from the nucleus into the cytoplasm, where they are translated into the regulatory proteins <b>Tat</b> (which encourages new virus production) and Rev. As the newly produced Rev protein accumulates in the nucleus, it binds to full-length, unspliced copies of virus RNAs and allows them to leave the nucleus. Some of these full-length RNAs function as new copies of the virus genome, while others function as mRNAs that are translated to produce the structural proteins Gag and Env. Gag proteins bind to copies of the virus RNA genome to package them into new virus particles.|$|E

50|$|Traditional shuttle <b>tatting</b> may be {{simulated}} using a <b>tatting</b> needle or doll needle {{instead of}} a shuttle. There are two basic techniques for needle <b>tatting.</b> With the more widely disseminated technique, a double thread passes through the stitches. The result is similar to shuttle <b>tatting</b> but is slightly thicker and looser. The second technique more closely approximates shuttle <b>tatting</b> because a single thread passes through the stitches.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 20th century, <b>tatting</b> needles became commercially {{available}} {{in a variety of}} sizes, from fingering yarn down to size 80 <b>tatting</b> thread.

5|$|Johann Kuhnau, Bach's {{predecessor}} as Thomaskantor, {{composed a}} Latin Magnificat in two versions: one version {{with only the}} Latin text of the Magnificat for Marian feasts such as Visitation, and another version expanded with four German and Latin laudes relating to Christmas. When Bach presented his Latin Magnificat in 1723 (E-flat major version, BWV243a) it had the same expandable format: without laudes for Visitation, and with four laudes, on the same text as Kuhnau's, for Christmas. Another composition presented by Bach at that year's feast of the Visitation was Herz und Mund und <b>Tat</b> und Leben, BWV147, an expanded version of an Advent cantata composed before his Leipzig period (BWV147a).|$|E

50|$|Needle <b>tatting</b> {{originated}} {{in the early twentieth}} century, but did not become popular until much later. A <b>tatting</b> needle is a long, blunt needle that does not change thickness at the eye of the needle. The needle used must match the thickness of the thread chosen for the project. Rather than winding the shuttle, the needle is threaded with a length of thread. To work with a second color, a second needle is used. Although needle <b>tatting</b> looks similar to shuttle <b>tatting,</b> it differs in structure and is slightly thicker and looser because both the needle and the thread must pass through the stitches. However, it may be seen that the Victorian <b>tatting</b> pin would function as a <b>tatting</b> needle. As well, Florence Hartley refers in The Ladies' Hand Book of Fancy and Ornamental Work (1859) {{to the use of the}} <b>tatting</b> needle, so it must have originated prior to the mid-1800s.|$|R

50|$|Some believe <b>tatting</b> {{originated}} over 200 years ago, often citing shuttles seen in 18th-century {{paintings of}} women such as Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, Princess Marie Adélaïde of France, and Anne, Countess of Albemarle. A close inspection of those paintings, however, {{shows that the}} shuttles in question are too large to be <b>tatting</b> shuttles, {{and that they are}} actually knotting shuttles. There is no documentation of or example of <b>tatted</b> lace that dates prior to 1800. All available evidence shows that <b>tatting</b> originated in the early 19th century.|$|R

25|$|<b>Tat</b> protein also {{associates}} with RNA polymerase II complexes during early transcription elongation after the promoter clearance {{and before the}} synthesis of full-length TAR RNA transcript. This interaction of <b>Tat</b> with RNA polymerase II elongation complexes is P-TEFb-independent. There are two <b>Tat</b> binding sites on each transcription elongation complex; one is located on TAR RNA {{and the other one}} on RNA polymerase II near the exit site for nascent mRNA transcripts which suggests that two <b>Tat</b> molecules are involved in performing various functions during a single round of HIV-1 mRNA synthesis.|$|E

25|$|Like other lentiviruses, HIV-1 encodes a trans-activating {{regulatory}} protein (<b>Tat),</b> which {{is essential for}} efficient transcription of the viral genome. <b>Tat</b> acts by binding to an RNA stem-loop structure, the trans-activating response element (TAR), found at the 5′ ends of nascent HIV-1 transcripts.
