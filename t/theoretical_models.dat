5|$|Theoretical {{condensed}} matter physics {{involves the}} use of <b>theoretical</b> <b>models</b> to understand properties of states of matter. These include models to study the electronic properties of solids, such as the Drude model, the Band structure and the density functional theory. <b>Theoretical</b> <b>models</b> have also been developed to study the physics of phase transitions, such as the Ginzburg–Landau theory, critical exponents and the use of mathematical methods of quantum field theory and the renormalization group. Modern theoretical studies involve the use of numerical computation of electronic structure and mathematical tools to understand phenomena such as high-temperature superconductivity, topological phases, and gauge symmetries.|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{main subject}} of this thesis is <b>theoretical</b> <b>modeling</b> of bright and dark {{magneto-optical}} resonances observable on the D 1 spectral line of alkali metals. A <b>theoretical</b> <b>model</b> based on the rate equations for Zeeman coherences is em- ployed in the research. The <b>theoretical</b> <b>model</b> was developed from the optical Bloch equations, applying the rotating wave approximation and the decorrela- tion approach to stochastic dierential equations. In this thesis the <b>theoretical</b> <b>model</b> is adapted to describe magneto-optical resonances observed in alkali metal vapor that is conned in either an ordinary cm-sized cell or an extremely thin cell, whose thickness {{is comparable to the}} ex- citation wavelength. A method for estimating the parameters of the <b>theoretical</b> <b>model</b> for either of the experimental conditions is developed in the paper. The adapted <b>theoretical</b> <b>model</b> is tested by comparing its results to the ex- perimentally registered data. The experimental results are obtained by exciting atoms with laser radiation and observing the dependence of the uorescence sig- nal on a magnetic eld. Atomic vapor of 85 Rb, 87 Rb, and Cs is used. Rubidium atoms are studied in both types of cells, but Cesium atoms only in ordinary cells. Altogether the results of the <b>theoretical</b> <b>model</b> describe the experimental results well. Aside from describing experiments, the <b>theoretical</b> <b>model</b> is employed as an independent tool to study the saturation of the contrast of the dark magneto- optical resonances and the formation of the dark states...|$|R

We first investigate some of the fundamental properties that are re-quired {{in order to allow}} the optimization of parallelism and communication. Next, we explore how a group <b>theoretical</b> <b>model</b> of computations can satisfy these re-quirements. As an application example, we demonstrate how this group <b>theoretical</b> <b>model</b> can uncover new optimization possibilities in the polyhedral model...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to develop a <b>theoretical</b> <b>model</b> for land {{capability}} assessment. The study investigates components and factors, which are required for an effective agricultural management system, and considers relationships, and interactions within and between those components and factors in contributing to the capability of farmland. The <b>theoretical</b> <b>model</b> incorporates theory from a range of disciplines relating to agricultural management and agricultural land, including the bio-physical, technical and management, land development and improvement, land conservation and environmental, socio-economic, and institutional and policy. The contribution of the components and factors, and their interactions are key considerations in analysing the capability of farmland. The <b>theoretical</b> <b>model</b> is tested through undertaking a case study in the Mekong Delta, Viet Nam, based on suitable farming systems. The results from the case study confirm the adaptability, flexibility and applicability of the <b>theoretical</b> <b>model,</b> as well as providing useful feedback for the <b>theoretical</b> <b>model...</b>|$|R

5|$|Since Gliese 581c has {{not been}} {{detected}} directly, there are no measurements of its radius. Furthermore, the radial velocity method used to detect it only puts a lower limit on the planet's mass, which means <b>theoretical</b> <b>models</b> of planetary radius and structure can only be of limited use. However, assuming a random orientation of the planet's orbit, the true mass {{is likely to be}} close to the measured minimum mass.|$|E

Using this technique, ages for the Pleiades of between 75 and 150 million years have been estimated.

The planet orbits its parent star every three and a half days, and each time it passes in front of its parent star, the atmospheric contents can be analyzed by examining how the atmosphere absorbs light passing from the star directly through the atmosphere in the direction of Earth.|$|E
5|$|GRBs {{were first}} {{detected}} in 1967 by the Vela satellites, {{which had been}} designed to detect covert nuclear weapons tests. Following their discovery, hundreds of <b>theoretical</b> <b>models</b> were proposed to explain these bursts, such as collisions between comets and neutron stars. Little information was available to verify these models until the 1997 detection of the first X-ray and optical afterglows and direct measurement of their redshifts using optical spectroscopy, and thus their distances and energy outputs. These discoveries, and subsequent studies of the galaxies and supernovae associated with the bursts, clarified the distance and luminosity of GRBs, definitively placing them in distant galaxies.|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} problem {{addressed in this}} study was to determine what makes a work team successful. To achieve this objective a <b>theoretical</b> <b>model</b> of factors promoting team effectiveness was developed, using relevant literature in which models for team effectiveness are described. The <b>theoretical</b> <b>model</b> consisted of the following factors: Individual background factors; Facilitation; Team Factors; Synergy; Team effectiveness; Organisational factors. Each factor of the model was broken down into dimensions that were then analysed using literature identified during the literature study. The <b>theoretical</b> <b>model</b> was then used to develop a questionnaire to test the degree to which managers working for automotive component manufacturers in the Port Elizabeth /Uitenhage magisterial district and falling under Chapter III of the Bargaining Council for the Motor Industry concur. The empirical results obtained indicate a strong concurrence with the <b>theoretical</b> <b>model</b> of factors promoting team effectiveness that was developed in the study. This resulted in the <b>theoretical</b> <b>model</b> being confirmed and being accepted as a model of factors promoting team effectiveness...|$|R
30|$|After {{identifying}} {{major and}} minor signs and symptoms, the study team met to develop a first draft of the preliminary <b>theoretical</b> <b>model.</b> The purpose of the <b>theoretical</b> <b>model</b> was to hypothesize the relationships among the key concepts and impacts of interest, and to identify potential modifying factors [37]. The <b>theoretical</b> <b>model</b> also helped identify potentially confounding factors {{that need to be}} considered when generating items for the PRO measure and in future studies using the PRO measure. Based on the qualitative analysis, the major signs and symptoms identified, and the preliminary <b>theoretical</b> <b>model,</b> the team then generated the preliminary items to include in the measure and created an item definition table using the language of the participants as closely as possible for each item.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} an {{experimental}} study {{of the way in}} which individuals make inferences from publicly available information. We compare the predictions of a <b>theoretical</b> <b>model</b> of a common knowledge inference process with actual behavior. In the <b>theoretical</b> <b>model,</b> "perfect Bayesians," starting with private information, take actions; an aggregate statistic is made publicly available; the individuals do optimal Bayesian updating and take new actions; and the process continues until there is a common knowledge equilibrium with complete information pooling. We find that the <b>theoretical</b> <b>model</b> roughly predicts the observed behavior, but the actual inference process is clearly less efficient that the standard of the <b>theoretical</b> <b>model,</b> and while there is some pooling, it is incomplete.

5|$|On April 10, 2007, Travis Barman of the Lowell Observatory {{announced}} {{evidence that}} the atmosphere of HD 209458 b contained water vapor. Using a combination of previously published Hubble Space Telescope measurements and new <b>theoretical</b> <b>models,</b> Barman found strong evidence for water absorption in the planet's atmosphere. His method modeled light passing directly through the atmosphere from the planet's star as the planet passed in front of it. However, this hypothesis is still being investigated for confirmation.|$|E

Most of his predictions were proved correct when the elements in question were subsequently discovered. Mendeleev's periodic table has since been expanded and refined with the discovery or synthesis of further new elements and the development of new <b>theoretical</b> <b>models</b> to explain chemical behaviour.|$|E

5|$|It {{is unclear}} whether new {{elements}} will continue {{the pattern of the}} current periodic table as period 8, or require further adaptations or adjustments. Seaborg expected the eighth period to follow the previously established pattern exactly, so that it would include a two-element s-block for elements 119 and 120, a new g-block for the next 18 elements, and 30 additional elements continuing the current f-, d-, and p-blocks, culminating in element 168, the next noble gas. More recently, physicists such as Pekka Pyykkö have theorized that these additional elements do not follow the Madelung rule, which predicts how electron shells are filled and thus affects the appearance of the present periodic table. There are currently several competing <b>theoretical</b> <b>models</b> for the placement of the elements of atomic number {{less than or equal to}} 172.|$|E
5|$|Noether's theorem {{has become}} a {{fundamental}} tool of modern theoretical physics, both because of the insight it gives into conservation laws, and also, as a practical calculation tool. Her theorem allows researchers to determine the conserved quantities from the observed symmetries of a physical system. Conversely, it facilitates the description of a physical system based on classes of hypothetical physical laws. For illustration, suppose that a new physical phenomenon is discovered. Noether's theorem provides a test for <b>theoretical</b> <b>models</b> of the phenomenon: if the theory has a continuous symmetry, then Noether's theorem guarantees that the theory has a conserved quantity, and for the theory to be correct, this conservation must be observable in experiments.|$|E
5|$|The first {{recorded}} experimental work related to decompression {{was conducted by}} Robert Boyle, who subjected experimental animals to reduced ambient pressure by use of a primitive vacuum pump. In the earliest experiments the subjects died from asphyxiation, but in later experiments, signs of what was later to become known as decompression sickness were observed. Later, when technological advances allowed the use of pressurisation of mines and caissons to exclude water ingress, miners were observed to present symptoms of what would become known as caisson disease, the bends, and decompression sickness. Once it was recognized that the symptoms were caused by gas bubbles, and that recompression could relieve the symptoms, further work showed {{that it was possible}} to avoid symptoms by slow decompression, and subsequently various <b>theoretical</b> <b>models</b> have been derived to predict low-risk decompression profiles and treatment of decompression sickness.|$|E

5|$|<b>Theoretical</b> <b>models</b> of the Sun's {{development}} {{suggest that}} 3.8 to 2.5 billion years ago, during the Archean eon, the Sun {{was only about}} 75% as bright as it is today. Such a weak star {{would not have been}} able to sustain liquid water on Earth's surface, and thus life should not have been able to develop. However, the geological record demonstrates that Earth has remained at a fairly constant temperature throughout its history, and that the young Earth was somewhat warmer than it is today. One theory among scientists is that the atmosphere of the young Earth contained much larger quantities of greenhouse gases (such as carbon dioxide, methane) than are present today, which trapped enough heat to compensate for the smaller amount of solar energy reaching it.|$|E
5|$|<b>Theoretical</b> <b>models</b> {{predict that}} {{volatile}} compounds {{such as water}} and carbon dioxide, if present, might evaporate in the scorching heat of the sunward side, migrate to the cooler night side, and condense to form ice caps. Over time, the entire atmosphere might freeze into ice caps on the night side of the planet. However, it remains unknown if water and/or carbon dioxide are even present {{on the surface of}} Gliese 581c. Alternatively, an atmosphere large enough to be stable would circulate the heat more evenly, allowing for a wider habitable area on the surface. For example, although Venus has a small axial inclination, very little sunlight reaches the surface at the poles. A slow rotation rate approximately 117 times slower than Earth's produces prolonged days and nights. Despite the uneven distribution of sunlight cast on Venus at any given time, polar areas and the night side of Venus are kept almost as hot as on the day side by globally circulating winds.|$|E
5|$|X-ray {{crystallography}} {{has led to}} {{a better}} understanding of chemical bonds and non-covalent interactions. The initial studies revealed the typical radii of atoms, and confirmed many <b>theoretical</b> <b>models</b> of chemical bonding, such as the tetrahedral bonding of carbon in the diamond structure, the octahedral bonding of metals observed in ammonium hexachloroplatinate (IV), and the resonance observed in the planar carbonate group and in aromatic molecules. Kathleen Lonsdale's 1928 structure of hexamethylbenzene established the hexagonal symmetry of benzene and showed a clear difference in bond length between the aliphatic C–C bonds and aromatic C–C bonds; this finding led to the idea of resonance between chemical bonds, which had profound consequences for the development of chemistry. Her conclusions were anticipated by William Henry Bragg, who published models of naphthalene and anthracene in 1921 based on other molecules, an early form of molecular replacement.|$|E
