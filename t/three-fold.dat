40|$|We {{systematically}} {{approach the}} construction of heterotic E 8 × E 8 Calabi-Yau models, based on compact Calabi-Yau <b>three-folds</b> arising from toric geometry and vector bundles on these manifolds. We focus on a simple class of 101 such <b>three-folds</b> with smooth ambient spaces, on which we perform an exhaustive scan and find all positive monad bundles with SU(N), N = 3, 4, 5 structure groups, subject to the heterotic anomaly cancellation constraint. We find that anomaly-free positive monads exist on only 11 of these toric <b>three-folds</b> with a total number of bundles of about 2000. Only 21 of these models, all of them on <b>three-folds</b> realizable as hypersurfaces in products of projective spaces, allow for three families of quarks and leptons. We also perform a preliminary scan over the much larger class of semi-positive monads which leads to about 44000 bundles with 280 of them satisfying the three-family constraint. These 280 models provide {{a starting point for}} heterotic model building based on toric <b>three-folds.</b> © SISSA 2010...|$|R

5|$|The clergy {{was divided}} into two types: the secular clergy, who lived out in the world, and the regular clergy, who lived under a {{religious}} rule and were usually monks. Throughout the period monks remained a very small proportion of the population, usually less than one per cent.

The local parish priests were often drawn from the peasant class. Townsmen were in a somewhat unusual position, as they did not fit into the traditional <b>three-fold</b> division of society into nobles, clergy, and peasants. During the 12th and 13th centuries, the ranks of the townsmen expanded greatly as existing towns grew and new population centres were founded. But throughout the Middle Ages the population of the towns probably never exceeded 10 per cent of the total population.|$|E

Properties of the low energy effective actions associated with symmetric vacua are discussed.
