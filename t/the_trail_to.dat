5|$|The {{traditional}} {{starting line}} is in Whitehorse on First Avenue, near the former White Pass and Yukon Route train station, which today houses the Canadian offices of Yukon Quest International. Shortly {{after leaving the}} starting line, racers follow the frozen Yukon River north out of town. Crossing onto the Takhini River, mushers follow it north to the Klondike-era Overland Trail.

5|$|Bond visits Valentin Zukovsky and is {{informed}} that Elektra's head of security, Davidov, is {{in league with}} Renard: Bond kills Davidov and follows <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> <b>to</b> a Russian ICBM base in Kazakhstan. Posing as a Russian nuclear scientist, Bond meets American nuclear physicist Christmas Jones. The two witness Renard stealing the GPS locator card and a half quantity of weapons-grade plutonium from a bomb and set off an explosion, from which Bond and Jones escape. Elektra kidnaps M after she thinks Bond had been killed and Bond establishes that Elektra intends to create a nuclear explosion in a submarine in Istanbul to increase the value of her own oil pipeline.

5|$|Canopy Development, a green {{development}} company from Northampton, Massachusetts, owns {{a portion of}} the former rail bed in Rosendale. It has agreed to establish a right-of-way, rerouting <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> <b>to</b> allow public access. Another obstruction between Rosendale and Ulster is a private swimming pool, which will be bypassed. The Mohonk Preserve and Open Space Conservancy were given a $20,000 state grant in March 2011 to maintain the portion of the trail by Kingston. By the end of summer 2013, the last outstanding trail segment along the Rosendale-Kingston extension was opened to the public, completing the entire 23.7 mile rail trail.|$|E
5|$|In 1856, {{the church}} inaugurated {{a system of}} {{handcart}} companies in order to enable poor European emigrants to make the trek more cheaply. Handcarts, two-wheeled carts that were pulled by emigrants instead of draft animals, were sometimes used as an alternate means of transportation from 1856 to 1860. They were seen as a faster, easier, and cheaper way to bring European converts to Salt Lake City. Almost 3,000 Mormons, with 653 carts and 50 supply wagons, traveling in 10 different companies, made the trip over <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> <b>to</b> Salt Lake City. While {{not the first to}} use handcarts, they were the only group to use them extensively.|$|E
5|$|The final lap of <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> <b>to</b> Saint Paul, {{which had}} {{replaced}} Mendota {{as the principal}} entrepôt for the cart trade, continued along the sandplain on the east bank of the Mississippi. This route ran within {{a few miles of}} the river to Saint Anthony Falls and the community of that name which was growing on the east bank of the Mississippi. The trail then left the river and crossed open country to Saint Paul. The carters camped on the uplands west of the steamboat landing during the interval between their arrival with the furs and their return to the north with supplies and trade goods.|$|E

5|$|SODO Station is {{situated}} along the SODO Busway in the SoDo neighborhood of Seattle. The entrances to its two side platforms {{is located at}} the intersection of the SODO Busway and South Lander Street, adjacent to a United States Postal Service parking garage.

Major employers in the area include Starbucks, who has their headquarters at the Starbucks Center five blocks west of the station, and Seattle Public Schools at the John Stanford Center. The light rail line is paralleled to the east by a mixed-use bicycle trail called the SODO Trail, which connects SODO Station to Stadium station at South Royal Brougham Way. The Seattle Department of Transportation plans to extend <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> <b>to</b> Spokane Street, connecting it to a bike trail on the Spokane Street Viaduct, serving West Seattle; a connector trail on Forest Street to a segregated cycletrack on Airport Way is also being considered.|$|E
