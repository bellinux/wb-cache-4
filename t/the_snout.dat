5|$|Identification of cephalic scales is most {{conveniently}} {{begun with}} reference to the nostril, which is easily identified on a snake. There are two scales enclosing the nostril which are called the nasals. In colubrids, the nostril lies between the nasals, while in vipers it lies in the centre of a single nasal scale. The outer nasal (near <b>the</b> <b>snout)</b> is called the prenasal while the inner nasal (near the eye) is called the postnasal. Along the top of <b>the</b> <b>snout</b> connecting the nasals {{on both sides of the}} head are scales called internasals. Between the two prenasals is a scale at the tip of <b>the</b> <b>snout</b> called the rostral scale.|$|E
5|$|The fish is carnivorous, {{with its}} prey {{consisting}} mainly of benthic invertebrates and fishes. Such food items include polychaetes, gastropods, bivalve mollusks, rock crabs, cancer crabs, spider crabs, lobsters, shrimps, squids, and fishes including spiny dogfish, alewife, Atlantic herring, menhaden, hakes, sculpins, cunner, tautog, sand lance, butterfish, and various flounders. Juveniles primarily subsist on benthic invertebrates such as polychaetes, copepods, amphipods, isopods, crangon shrimp, and euphausiids. Individuals {{have been found}} with the denticles on <b>the</b> <b>snout</b> worn smooth, indicating that <b>the</b> <b>snout</b> is used to dig in the mud or sand to obtain bivalve mollusks.|$|E
5|$|The {{skull of}} Knoetschesuchus is {{relatively}} short, with <b>the</b> <b>snout</b> taking up 47% of skull length in K. langenbergensis and 42% in K. guimarotae, which {{allows them to}} be classified as brevirostrine crocodilians. Along the side of <b>the</b> <b>snout</b> are two undulations, a smaller one on the premaxilla and a larger and broader one on the maxilla. The jagged suture between the premaxilla and maxilla is angled towards {{the front of the}} skull in K. langenbergensis and towards the back in K. guimarotae. Along the midline of <b>the</b> <b>snout</b> are the thin and wedge-like nasals; the nostrils, which face upwards, are clearly separated by the nasals in K. guimarotae, {{but it is not clear}} that this is the case in K. langenbergensis.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>snout</b> of Ankylosaurus was arched and {{truncated}} at the front, and the nostrils were elliptical, {{and they}} were directed downward and outward, unlike in all other known ankylosaurids where they faced obliquely forward or upward. Additionally, the nostrils were not visible from the front, because the sinuses were expanded {{to the sides of}} the premaxilla bone, to a larger extent than seen in other ankylosaurs. Large loreal caputegulae, strap-like, side osteoderms of <b>the</b> <b>snout,</b> completely roofed the enlarged opening of the nostrils. The nostrils also had an intranarial septum, which separated the nasal passage from the sinus. Each side of <b>the</b> <b>snout</b> had five sinuses, four of which expanded into the maxilla bone. The nasal cavities or chambers of Ankylosaurus were elongated and separated by a septum at the midline, which divided the inside of <b>the</b> <b>snout</b> into two mirrored halves. The septum had two openings, including the choanae (internal nostrils).|$|E
5|$|Although skull {{proportions}} varied, abelisaurid skulls {{were generally}} very tall and very short in length. In Carnotaurus, for example, the skull {{was nearly as}} tall as it was long. The premaxilla in abelisaurids was very tall, so the front of <b>the</b> <b>snout</b> was blunt, not tapered as seen in many other theropods.|$|E
5|$|The Pacific {{electric}} ray has a soft, flabby body devoid of dermal denticles. It has an oval pectoral fin disc about 1.2 times {{as wide as}} long, with a nearly straight front margin {{and a pair of}} kidney-shaped electric organs visible beneath the skin. The eyes are small and followed by smooth-rimmed spiracles; the space from the spiracles to <b>the</b> <b>snout</b> tip is about 1.8 times the distance between the spiracles. There is a curtain of skin between the nostrils that almost reaches the mouth, which is arched with deep furrows at the corners. The distance between the mouth and <b>the</b> <b>snout</b> tip is about equal to the mouth width, and three times that of the distance between the nostrils. There are 25–28 upper tooth rows and 19–26 lower tooth rows; each tooth is tiny and smooth, with a single sharp cusp.|$|E

5|$|There are {{indications}} of D. horneri possessing integumentary sensory organs, possibly used in touch, modulation of precise jaw movements, temperature reading, and prey detection.

5|$|Acrocanthosaurus is {{classified}} in the superfamily Allosauroidea within the infraorder Tetanurae. This superfamily is characterized by paired ridges on the nasal and lacrimal bones on top of <b>the</b> <b>snout</b> and tall neural spines on the neck vertebrae, among other features. It was originally placed in the family Allosauridae with Allosaurus, an arrangement also supported by studies as late as 2000. Most studies have {{found it to be}} a member of the related family Carcharodontosauridae.|$|E
5|$|D. lacustris ("of the lake") is a nomen dubium, {{named by}} Marsh in 1884 based on {{specimen}} YPM 1922 found by Arthur Lakes, consisting of <b>the</b> <b>snout</b> and upper jaw of a smaller animal from Morrison, Colorado. These remains are now {{believed to have}} been from an immature animal, rather than from a separate species. In 2015, it was concluded that the specimen actually belonged to Camarasaurus.|$|E

2500|$|Robert T. Bakker {{interpreted}} the [...] "ornamentation" [...] seen on <b>the</b> <b>snouts</b> and around <b>the</b> {{eyes of many}} tyrannosaurs were displays for {{other members of the}} same tyrannosaur species.|$|R
5|$|In 2009, Dal Sasso et al.. {{reported}} {{the results of}} X-ray computed tomography of the MSNM V4047 snout. As the foramina on the outside all communicated with a space {{on the inside of}} <b>the</b> <b>snout,</b> the authors speculated that Spinosaurus had pressure receptors inside the space that allowed it to hold its snout at {{the surface of the water}} to detect swimming prey species without seeing them.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Whitlock et al. {{described}} a juvenile skull {{at the time}} referred to Diplodocus (CM11255) that differed greatly from adult skulls of the same genus: its snout was not blunt, and the teeth were {{not confined to the}} front of <b>the</b> <b>snout.</b> These differences suggest that adults and juveniles were feeding differently. Such an ecological difference between adults and juveniles had not been previously observed in sauropodomorphs.|$|E
5|$|Named in 1976 by Sergei Kurzanov, Alioramus {{is another}} genus of tyrannosaurid from {{slightly}} older sediments in Mongolia. Several analyses have concluded Alioramus was quite {{closely related to}} Tarbosaurus. It was described as an adult, but its long, low skull is characteristic of a juvenile tyrannosaurid. This led Currie to speculate that Alioramus might represent a juvenile Tarbosaurus, but {{he noted that the}} much higher tooth count and row of crests on top of <b>the</b> <b>snout</b> suggested otherwise.|$|E

50|$|Cur/Snout - Children {{captured}} by Sharma's army and gradually brainwashed into serving it {{by a combination}} of drugs and psychological conditioning. Because the Bardic ethos considers child soldiery an abomination, the presence of the Curs weakens the defences of the cities they are sent to invade. This impact is enhanced by the ruthlessness of <b>the</b> <b>snouts,</b> who are trained to be merciless or even sadistic, and sometimes by the presence among <b>the</b> <b>snouts</b> of a defender's own child or relative. Snouts are introduced in the third book, wherein Hem infiltrates their training camp in search of his friend Zelika (see below) and accompanies a troop of Curs to Dén Raven.|$|R
50|$|Characteristics of genus Apristurus {{are mostly}} dark bodies, having a long anal fin that ends {{in front of}} where the lower caudal fin begins. <b>The</b> <b>snouts</b> of <b>the</b> members of Apristurus are flat. They also present upper and lower labial furrows.|$|R
5|$|The {{anatomy of}} 'Pachycephalosaurus' is poorly known, as only skull remains have been described. Pachycephalosaurus {{is famous for}} having a large, bony dome atop its skull, up to 25cm (10in) thick, which safely {{cushioned}} its tiny brain. The dome's rear aspect was edged with bony knobs and short bony spikes projected upwards from <b>the</b> <b>snout.</b> The spikes were probably blunt, not sharp.|$|E
5|$|The {{deepwater}} stingray has a flabby body, with enlarged pectoral fins {{forming a}} disc usually {{longer than it}} is wide. The leading margins of the disc converge at a broad angle. <b>The</b> <b>snout</b> is thin and measures over six times {{as long as the}} diameter of the orbit; <b>the</b> <b>snout</b> tip protrudes slightly from the disc. The small eyes are positioned just ahead of the spiracles, which have angular posterior rims. The large, circular nostrils are placed close to the mouth, to which they are connected by a pair of broad grooves. Between the nostrils is a broad curtain of skin with a strongly fringed posterior margin. The wide, straight mouth contains 32–60 tooth rows in either jaw, increasing in number with age. Each tooth is small with a low, blunt cusp; in adult males the teeth at the center are sharp and backward-pointing. The five pairs of gill slits are small and placed beneath the disc.|$|E
5|$|The dogs of {{all these}} islands were short, and their sizes vary {{from that of a}} lap-dog to the largest spaniel. Their head is broad, <b>the</b> <b>snout</b> pointed, the eyes very small, the ears upright, and their hair rather long, lank, hard, and of {{different}} colours, but most commonly white and brown. They seldom if ever barked, but howled sometimes, and were shy of strangers to a degree of aversion.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Snouted</b> {{harvester}} termite, (Trinervitermes biformis), is {{a species}} of mound building termite of the genus Trinervitermes. It is native to India and Sri Lanka. Type species was described from Bandarawela area of Sri Lanka. It is a pest of sugarcane, and brinjal.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> tooth-nosed <b>snout</b> weevils, Rhynchitidae, {{are small}} beetles (1.5 to 6.5 mm) {{that are usually}} found vegetation.

50|$|Porolepiformes was {{established}} by the Swedish paleontologist Erik Jarvik, and were thought to {{have given rise to}} the salamanders and caecilians independently of the other tetrapods. He based this conclusion on the shapes of <b>the</b> <b>snouts</b> of <b>the</b> aforementioned groups. This view is no longer in favour in Paleontology.|$|R
5|$|The goblin shark has a distinctively {{long and}} flat snout, {{resembling}} a sword blade. The proportional length of <b>the</b> <b>snout</b> decreases with age. The eyes {{are small and}} lack protective nictitating membranes; behind the eyes are spiracles. The large mouth is parabolic in shape. The jaws are highly protrusible and can be extended almost {{to the end of}} <b>the</b> <b>snout,</b> though normally they are held flush against the underside of the head. It has 35–53 upper and 31–62 lower tooth rows. The teeth in {{the main part of the}} jaws are long and narrow, particularly those near the symphysis (jaw midpoint), and are finely grooved lengthwise. The rear teeth near the corners of the jaw are small and have a flattened shape for crushing. Much individual variation in tooth length and width occurs, in whether the teeth have a smaller cusplet on each side of the main cusp, and in the presence of toothless gaps at the symphysis or between the main and rear teeth. The five pairs of gill slits are short, with the gill filaments inside partly exposed; the fifth pair is above the origin of the pectoral fins.|$|E
5|$|The head is flattened, triangular, and {{distinct}} from the neck. <b>The</b> <b>snout</b> is blunt, rounded, and raised. The nostrils are large, each {{in the middle of}} a large, single nasal scale. The lower edge of the nasal touches the nasorostral. The supranasal has a strong crescent shape and separates the nasal from the nasorostral anteriorly. The rostral is as broad as it is high.|$|E
5|$|The pallid sturgeon's snout {{and head}} are {{longer than that}} of the shovelnose sturgeon. In both species, the mouth is located well back from the tip of <b>the</b> <b>snout.</b> Lacking teeth, they use their {{extendable}} mouths to suck up small fish, mollusks, and other food sources from river bottoms. Both species also have four barbels which descend from <b>the</b> <b>snout</b> near the front of the mouth. The barbels are believed to be sensory features to locate food sources. On pallid sturgeon, the two inner barbels are about half as long as the outer ones, while on the shovelnose sturgeon, all four barbels are the same length. The inner barbels of the pallid sturgeon are positioned in front of the outer ones, but those on the shovelnose sturgeon are all located in essentially a straight line. The length and positioning of the barbels {{is one of the best}} ways to distinguish the two species.|$|E
5000|$|It has a snout on {{its head}} and thus called <b>the</b> <b>snouted</b> termite. <b>The</b> <b>snouted</b> {{harvester}} termite (Trinervitermes trinervoides) is a mostly nocturnal species local to South Africa. It is widely distributed and common south of the Limpopo River. The species lives in savannah-grassland areas. The species stores grass within its mounds, just beneath the surface. Evidence showed that {{it is likely that}} the species is not polycalic and thus each mound will house only a single colony. [...] The mounding building causes disturbances that build nutritional value as well as improving drainage and fertility. All of these improve vegetation and thus herbivore concentration in an area. Oftentimes these disturbances can be strong enough to switch the ecosystem from a grassy vegetated area to a tree, shrub, and pioneer species landscape.|$|R
