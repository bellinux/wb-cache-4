5|$|All the maqamat of Bani Zeid were {{designed}} differently, with some being rustic tombstones and others built more elaborately. The latter types {{consisted of a}} domed mausoleum known as a qubba, a shelter known as a makan nawm, a garden, a well and either a distinguishable olive or oak tree. Most of the upkeep of the buildings was provided by awqaf ("religious endowments"). One of the shrines was considered by the local peasantry <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> to safeguard firewood and outside the reach of potential thieves. The maqamat were also divided by status, with some bearing significance only to an individual village or clan and some collectively revered by {{the residents of the}} sheikhdom. Of all the sites in the Bani Zeid sheikhdom, the most venerated shrine was that of Nabi Salih, dedicated to the prophet (nabi) Salih, which held special significance beyond Bani Zeid.|$|E
5|$|Stalinist {{officials}} allocated no {{funding for}} the design competition nor for the memorial, and the committee disbanded in 1948; by then many survivors had left the country. In 1949, the town of Sokołów Podlaski protected the camp with a new fence and gate. A work crew with no archaeological experience was sent in to landscape the grounds. In 1958, {{after the end of}} Stalinism in Poland, the Warsaw provincial council declared Treblinka <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> of martyrology. Over the next four years, 127 hectares (318 acres) of land that had formed part of the camp was purchased from 192 farmers in the villages of Prostyń, Grądy, Wólka Okrąglik and Nowa Maliszewa.|$|E
5|$|The {{president}} and general manager of Pacific Northwest Theatres, Inc., Harry C. Arthur, believed Seattle <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> of growing importance in the motion picture industry in the mid-1920s, and consequently as the place to invest for the long term. Arthur's company absorbed a competing chain of 40 theatres by 1926, and sought further expansion. A large holder of the theatre company's stock and debt was C. D. Stimson who sat on the board of directors of both Pacific Northwest Theatres and the Metropolitan Building Company, developer of what became known as the Metropolitan Tract. Stimson promoted the establishment of a theatre district like that which had developed around a theatre he had built in Los Angeles, California. The planned Skinner Building with a theatre owned by Arthur's company would complete the Stimson development of the Metropolitan Tract.|$|E

25|$|A young mouse named Matthias {{dreams of}} times of {{adventure}} {{rather than a}} life of quiet servitude, but he is counselled to patience by his elders. Redwall is a fixture in the local community, set {{in the heart of}} Mossflower Woods, and was designed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> of refuge for the beasts of the forest in times of trouble.|$|E
25|$|Some {{priests in}} some parishes (six out of 80) bless {{permanent}} faithful relationships. Permission is {{granted by the}} bishop only when a priest requests it, and a parish has decided by majority vote, that they want <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> of blessing. Ingham says of the practice: I insist only that those {{on all sides of}} the issue respect one another and that everyone should maintain the order of the church. Our goal in the Anglican Church in the Greater Vancouver area is to be a church that accommodates differences.|$|E
25|$|Throughout its history, {{the hotel}} hosted notable guests {{including}} U.S. Presidents Abraham Lincoln, Ulysses S. Grant, William Howard Taft, Theodore Roosevelt and President of the Confederate States of America Jefferson Davis. Lincoln {{stayed at the}} Nachusa House numerous times and generally occupied the same room. A Lincoln room was established in his honor within the hotel during its later years, the room was furnished {{much as it was}} when Lincoln stayed at the hotel. The balcony outside the room was known <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> where Lincoln would sit and socialize. The room has since been converted into an apartment.|$|E

25|$|Brazil {{continued}} {{to try to}} remain neutral to the United States and Germany because {{it was trying to}} make sure it could continue <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> of interest for both opposing countries. Brazil attended continental meetings in Buenos Aires, Argentina (1936); Lima, Peru (1938); and Havana, Cuba (1940) that obligated them to agree to defend any part of the Americas if they were to be attacked. Eventually Brazil decided to stop trading with Germany once Germany started attacking offshore trading ships resulting in Germany declaring a blockade against the Americas in the Atlantic Ocean. Furthermore, Germany also ensured that they would be attacking the Americas soon.|$|E
25|$|On August 17, 1942, {{the board}} was {{dismissed}} and Yonhi was designated as enemy property, thus was appropriated and further managed directly by an appointee from the governor-general. Yonhi ceased <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> of education and was converted into a tool for assimilation of Koreans and exploitation of manpower. By October 1943, students were practically being conscripted. In 1944, dormitories were converted into barracks and the campus was occupied by the Japanese air force. Finally, on May 10, 1944, Governors-General closed Yonhi {{and replaced it with}} Kyungsung Industrial Management School (경성공업경영학교), the primary purpose of which was to train engineers required to continue the war.|$|E
25|$|Newman {{believed}} {{in a middle}} way between free thinking and moral authority – one that would respect the rights of knowledge {{as well as the}} rights of revelation. His purpose was to build a Catholic university, in a world where the major Catholic universities on the European continent had recently been secularised, and most universities in the English-speaking world were Protestant. For a university to claim legitimacy in the larger world, it would have to support research and publication free from church censorship; however, for a university to be a safe place for the education of Catholic youth, it would have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> in which the teachings of the Catholic church were respected and promoted.|$|E

25|$|As {{the number}} of {{settlers}} in the area grew, so did demand for a local bench of magistrates as the nearest ones were 100–200 miles away in Tumut and Binalong. In April 1847 {{it was announced that}} Wagga Wagga was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> for holding petty sessions, dispensing justice and maintaining law and order over an area up to 100 miles away. The courthouse was located with the beginnings of a village formed near the ford used by most traffic passing through the area. The village included a crude blacksmith's shop and hotel. A post office was established in January 1849 and later that year the town was marked out by surveyor Thomas Townshend and formally gazetted as a village on 23 November 1849.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of her husband, Brian, has {{been subject to}} a similar interpretation: Irene's labeling of him as [...] and his oft-expressed desire to go to Brazil, a country then widely thought to be more tolerant of homosexuality than the United States was, are given as evidence. It is also shown that Brazil is considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> with more relaxed ideas about race.|$|E
500|$|A 2009 {{guide to}} the {{buildings}} of the region notes the [...] "exceptional number of inscribed fragments", showing it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> of early Christian worship, but considers {{that the church is}} [...] "unlovely". Similarly, a 2005 guide to Wales describes St Caffo's as [...] "an uninspiring nineteenth-century church from the outside" [...] but says that it has [...] "a remarkable collection" [...] of memorial stones.|$|E

50|$|Evans (2000) {{considered}} Sactoceras <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> orthocerid, <b>placing</b> {{it in the}} Pseudorthoceratoidea (originally Pseudorthoceratacea) of Flower and Caster, 1935, and in {{the family}} Sactoceratidae of Troedsson, 1926. The Pseudorthocerataceae is now generally regarded as a separate order, the Pseuorthocerida, within the superorder Orthoceratoidea of Wade, 1988.|$|R
500|$|A {{significant}} {{element of}} delusion permeated his thinking: Bundy was always surprised when anyone noticed {{that one of}} his victims was missing, because he imagined America <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> where everyone is invisible except to themselves. And he was always astounded when people testified that they had seen him in incriminating places, because Bundy did not believe people noticed each other. [...] "I don't know why everyone is out to get me", he complained to Lewis. [...] "He really and truly did not have any sense of the enormity of what he had done," [...] she said. [...] "A long-term serial killer erects powerful barriers to his guilt," [...] Keppel wrote, [...] "walls of denial that can sometimes never be breached." [...] Nelson agreed. [...] "Each time he was forced to make an actual confession," [...] she wrote, [...] "he had to leap a steep barrier he had built inside himself long ago." ...|$|E
500|$|Hamilton adapted {{an idea of}} his {{involving}} Bond in Disneyland for Scaramanga's funhouse. The funhouse {{was designed}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> where Scaramanga could get the upper hand by distracting the adversary with obstacles, and was described by Murton as a [...] "melting pot of ideas" [...] which made it [...] "both a funhouse and a horror house". While an actual wax figure of Roger Moore was used, Moore's stunt double Les Crawford was the cowboy figure, and Ray Marione played the Al Capone figure. The canted sets such as the funhouse and the Queen Elizabeth had inspiration from German Expressionism films such as The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. For Scaramanga's solar power plant, Hamilton used both the Pinewood set and a miniature projected by Derek Meddings, often cutting between each other to show there was no discernible difference. The destruction of the facility {{was a combination of}} practical effects on the set and a destruction of the miniature. Meddings based the island blowing up on footage of the Battle of Monte Cassino.|$|E
500|$|The {{writings}} of various travellers in the Holy Land, {{especially in the}} 18th and 19th centuries, tell of how the Wall and its environs continued <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> of devotion for the Jews. Isaac Yahuda, a prominent member of the Sephardic community in Jerusalem recalled how men and women used to gather in a circle at the Wall to hear sermons delivered in Ladino. His great-grandmother, who arrived in Palestine in 1841, [...] "used {{to go to the}} Western Wall every Friday afternoon, winter and summer, and stay there until candle-lighting time, reading the entire Book of Psalms and the Song of Songs...she would sit there by herself for hours." [...] In the past women could be found sitting {{at the entrance to the}} Wall every Sabbath holding fragrant herbs and spices in order to enable worshipers to make additional blessings. In the hot weather they would provide cool water. The women also used to cast lots for the privilege of sweeping and washing the alleyway at the foot of the Wall. Throughout the ages, the Wall is where Jews have gathered to express gratitude to God or to pray for divine mercy. On news of the Normandy landings on June 6, 1944 thousands of Jews went to the Wall to offer prayers for the [...] "success of His Majesty’s and Allied Forces in the liberation of all enemy-occupied territory." [...] On October 13, 1994, 50,000 gathered to pray for the safe return of kidnapped soldier Nachshon Wachsman. August 10, 2005 saw a massive prayer rally at the Wall. Estimates of people protesting Israel's unilateral disengagement plan ranged from 50,000 to 250,000 people. Every year on Tisha B'Av large crowds congregate at the Wall to commemorate the destruction of the Temple. In 2007 over 100,000 gathered. During the month of Tishrei 2009, a record 1.5 million people visited the site.|$|E

25|$|The living {{conditions}} in the camp were extremely poor, it brought infection and illness and, consequently, plagues that killed {{a large number of}} the people in the camp.

50|$|Burials {{began in}} 1810 after {{the land was}} bought by the Rev. Richard Allen for Mother Bethel A.M.E. Church, located about half <b>a</b> mile north, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> resting <b>place</b> for African-Americans. Bills of {{mortality}} and death certificates document 1,716 burials on the 0.28 acre site before 1830.|$|R
500|$|Leaving Oldbridge, the Way {{follows the}} road for {{approximately}} [...] before turning onto a boreen. To {{the left of the}} boreen is Wart Stone Field, so called on account of a bullaun stone that lies in the field, water from which is said to cure warts. The boreen ends at Brusher Gap, reputed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> where locals left food and supplies for Michael Dwyer and his followers when they went on the run after the 1798 Rebellion. The Way enters Drummin forest, a sitka spruce plantation, where it passes an Adirondack shelter, constructed by Mountain , a volunteer group dedicated to trail preservation that has upgraded various sections of the Wicklow Way over the years. The trail climbs Paddock Hill before descending into a plantation of larch trees. The forest floor here is a habitat for spurges, heath bedstraw and fly agaric toadstools. The trail crosses the Military Road, near Laragh, and then a wooden footbridge across the Glenmacnass River. A dense spread of granite boulders litters the riverbed, glacial erratics deposited by melting glaciers {{at the end of the}} last ice age. This stretch of the trail follows an old mass path through a woodland of many native Irish tree species, including oak, rowan, silver birch and willow, carpeted with a forest floor of bilberry, bluebell and hard fern. The Way continues along forest tracks over the shoulder of Brockagh Mountain. At the highest point there is a vista over the Vale of Glendalough with the two lakes nestled in the shelter of Camaderry and Derrybawn Mountains. Exiting the forest, the Way reaches the R756 road and the Glendalough visitor centre. Crossing the Glendasan River, it passes the remains of the Monastic City, founded in the 6th century by Saint Kevin.|$|E
