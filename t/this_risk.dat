5|$|The only {{common side}} effect of {{warfarin}} is bleeding. The risk of severe bleeding is small but definite (a typically yearly rate of 1-3% has been reported) and any benefit needs to outweigh <b>this</b> <b>risk</b> when warfarin is considered. All types of bleeding occur more commonly, but the most severe ones are those involving the brain (intracerebral hemorrhage/hemorrhagic stroke) and the spinal cord. Risk of bleeding is increased if the INR is out of range (due to accidental or deliberate overdose or due to interactions). <b>This</b> <b>risk</b> increases greatly once the INR exceeds 4.5.|$|E

5|$|Blood {{transfusion}} {{was formerly}} the second-most common {{mode of transmission}} for Chagas disease, but {{the development and implementation}} of blood bank screening tests has dramatically reduced <b>this</b> <b>risk</b> in the 21st century. Blood donations in all endemic Latin American countries undergo Chagas screening, and testing is expanding in countries, such as France, Spain and the United States, that have significant or growing populations of immigrants from endemic areas. In Spain, donors are evaluated with a questionnaire to identify individuals at risk of Chagas exposure for screening tests.|$|E
5|$|Combined {{hormonal}} contraceptives {{are associated}} with a slightly increased risk of venous and arterial blood clots. Venous clots, on average, increase from 2.8 to 9.8 per 10,000 women years which is still less than that associated with pregnancy. Due to <b>this</b> <b>risk,</b> they are not recommended in women over 35years of age who continue to smoke. Due to the increased risk they are included in decision tools such as the DASH score and PERC rule used to predict the risk of blood clots.|$|E

5|$|King Edward died in 1553, {{followed}} by the accession of Mary I of England, who opposed the Protestant reformers. Vermigli was placed under house arrest for six months, and his Catholic opponents at Oxford would likely have had him executed, as Cranmer eventually was in 1556. Despite <b>this</b> <b>risk,</b> he agreed to a public disputation with Cranmer against the new Catholic establishment, but this never came to fruition because Cranmer was imprisoned.

5|$|Recent {{focus has}} been to reduce therapy for low and {{intermediate}} risk neuroblastoma while maintaining survival rates at 90%. A study of 467 intermediate risk patients enrolled in A3961 from 1997 to 2005 confirmed the hypothesis that therapy could be successfully reduced for <b>this</b> <b>risk</b> group. Those with favorable characteristics (tumor grade and response) received four cycles of chemotherapy, and those with unfavorable characteristics received eight cycles, with three-year event free survival and overall survival stable at 90% for the entire cohort. Future plans are to intensify treatment for those patients with aberration of 1p36 or 11q23 chromosomes {{as well as for}} those who lack early response to treatment.|$|E
5|$|Screening of donated blood, blood components, {{and solid}} organ donors, {{as well as}} donors of cells, tissues, and cell and tissue {{products}} for T. cruzi is mandated in all Chagas-endemic countries and has been implemented. Approximately 300,000 infected people live in the United States, which is likely the result of immigration from Latin American countries, {{and there have been}} 23 cases acquired from kissing bugs in the United States reported between 1955 and 2014.

5|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that {{hypopituitarism}} is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and some also an increased risk of death of about 50% to 150% the normal population. It has been difficult to establish which hormone deficiency is responsible for <b>this</b> <b>risk,</b> as almost all patients studied had growth hormone deficiency. The studies also do not answer the question as to whether the hypopituitarism itself causes the increased mortality, or whether some of the risk is to be attributed to the treatments, some of which (such as sex hormone supplementation) have a recognized adverse effect on cardiovascular risk.|$|E
5|$|Tentative {{evidence}} supports {{an increased risk}} of lung cancer from indoor air pollution related to the burning of wood, charcoal, dung or crop residue for cooking and heating. Women who are exposed to indoor coal smoke have about twice the risk and a number of the by-products of burning biomass are known or suspected carcinogens. <b>This</b> <b>risk</b> affects about 2.4billion people globally, and is believed to account for 1.5% of lung cancer deaths.|$|E
5|$|The {{absence of}} {{distinct}} currencies also theoretically removes exchange rate risks, although {{the imposition of}} transfer restrictions in 2012–13 Cypriot financial crisis means {{that the situation is}} not quite so simple. The risk of unanticipated exchange rate movement has always added an additional risk or uncertainty for companies or individuals that invest or trade outside their own currency zones.

5|$|Children who {{discontinue}} {{the diet}} after achieving seizure freedom {{have about a}} 20% risk of seizures returning. The length of time until recurrence is highly variable but averages two years. <b>This</b> <b>risk</b> of recurrence compares with 10% for resective surgery (where {{part of the brain}} is removed) and 30–50% for anticonvulsant therapy. Of those that have a recurrence, just over half can regain freedom from seizures either with anticonvulsants or by returning to the ketogenic diet. Recurrence is more likely if, despite seizure freedom, an electroencephalogram (EEG) shows epileptiform spikes, which indicate epileptic activity in the brain but are below the level that will cause a seizure. Recurrence is also likely if an MRI scan shows focal abnormalities (for example, as in children with tuberous sclerosis). Such children may remain on the diet longer than average, and {{it has been suggested that}} children with tuberous sclerosis who achieve seizure freedom could remain on the ketogenic diet indefinitely.|$|E
5|$|Liver {{disease may}} present itself as tiredness, {{increased}} bleeding tendency or confusion (due to hepatic encephalopathy) and portal hypertension. The latter, {{a condition in}} which the pressure in the portal vein is markedly increased, leads to esophageal varices, blood vessels in the esophagus that may bleed in a life-threatening fashion, as well as enlargement of the spleen (splenomegaly) and accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity (ascites). On examination, signs of chronic liver disease such as spider angiomata (small distended blood vessels, usually on the chest) may be observed. Chronic active hepatitis has caused cirrhosis of the liver in most by the time they develop symptoms. While most people with cirrhosis have an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer), <b>this</b> <b>risk</b> is relatively very low in Wilson's disease.|$|E
5|$|People whose CT scan shows a large hematoma, {{depressed}} {{level of}} consciousness, or focal neurologic signs {{may benefit from}} urgent surgical removal of the blood or occlusion of the bleeding site. The remainder are stabilized more extensively and undergo a transfemoral angiogram or CT angiogram later. It is hard to predict who will have a rebleed, yet it may happen {{at any time and}} carries a dismal prognosis. After the first 24hours have passed, rebleeding risk remains around 40 percent over the subsequent fourweeks, suggesting that interventions should be aimed at reducing <b>this</b> <b>risk</b> as soon as possible. Some predictors of early rebleeding are high systolic blood pressure, the presence of a hematoma in the brain or ventricles, poor Hunt-Hess grade (III-IV), aneurysms in the posterior circulation, and an aneurysm >10mm in size.|$|E
