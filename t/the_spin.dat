40|$|<b>The</b> <b>spinning</b> {{triangle}} is {{a critical}} region in <b>the</b> <b>spinning</b> process of yarn. Its geometry influences the fiber tension distribution and thus affects <b>the</b> properties of <b>spun</b> yarns. In conventional ring <b>spinning,</b> on <b>the</b> one hand, <b>the</b> <b>spinning</b> triangles are often asymmetric due to the frictional contacts of fibers with the bottom roller, which interferes with the twist propagation into <b>the</b> <b>spinning</b> triangle zone, and thus leads to the migration of the axis fiber at the front roller nip. On the other hand, <b>the</b> yarn <b>spinning</b> tension has an obvious angle with the vertical axis perpendicular to the nip line. Therefore, in this paper, a theoretical model of the fiber tension distributions in <b>the</b> general <b>spinning</b> triangle has been proposed by considering both the inclination angle of <b>the</b> <b>spinning</b> tension and <b>the</b> migration of the axis fiber at the front roller nip according {{to the principle of}} minimum potential energy. Two shape parameters were introduced to describe the skew level of the geometry of <b>the</b> <b>spinning</b> triangle in <b>the</b> analysis. The effects of shapes of <b>the</b> <b>spinning</b> triangle on <b>the</b> fiber tension distributions were investigated. The results show that the fiber tension distribution at <b>the</b> <b>spinning</b> triangle tends to more non-uniformity with increasing the asymmetry of <b>the</b> <b>spinning</b> triangle. <b>The</b> effects of both shape par-ameters on the fiber tension distributions are similar under the assumption that <b>the</b> <b>spinning</b> triangle height H is constant.

40|$|The {{geometry}} of <b>the</b> <b>spinning</b> triangle influences <b>the</b> distribution of fiber tension in <b>the</b> <b>spinning</b> triangle and fiber tensile stresses within the yarn and, thus, affects the component of yarn torque due to these stresses. In this study, a modified energy approach was adopted {{to study the}} distribution of fiber tension in <b>the</b> staple <b>spinning</b> triangle. <b>The</b> <b>spinning</b> triangle had an asymmetric geometry, unlike that studied by other researchers.

The principle of minimum potential energy was applied to analyze three cases, that is, spinning triangle with uniformly distributed fibers, spinning triangle with fiber substrands and spinning triangle with buckled fibers. The effects of shape of <b>spinning</b> triangle on <b>the</b> fiber tension distribution at <b>the</b> <b>spinning</b> triangle were investigated. The results showed that the tension distribution of fibers at <b>the</b> <b>spinning</b> triangle became more uniform with the increase of the symmetry of <b>the</b> <b>spinning</b> triangle. In addition, as yarn twist increased, more tension of outer fibers was created and more compressive force developed on the central fibers in <b>the</b> <b>spinning</b> triangle. Compared with fiber tension distribution at <b>the</b> <b>spinning</b> triangle without fiber buckling, the fiber tensions distributed at <b>the</b> <b>spinning</b> triangle exhibited different shapes and had lower values with fiber buckling.

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>spinning</b> {{triangle}} is {{a critical}} area in <b>the</b> <b>spinning</b> process of staple yarns. Its geometry influences the distribution of fiber tension in <b>the</b> <b>spinning</b> triangle and <b>the</b> properties of <b>spun</b> yarns. In earlier theoretical models, <b>the</b> <b>spinning</b> tension of <b>the</b> yarn acting on the convergence point {{is assumed to be}} perpendicular to the nip line of front rollers. This assumption is reasonable in the study of <b>the</b> conventional ring <b>spinning</b> triangle, but may not be appropriate for modified ring spinning systems in which <b>the</b> yarn <b>spinning</b> tension has an obvious angle with the vertical axis perpendicular to the nip line. Thus in this paper a new theoretical model is proposed by considering the inclination angle of <b>the</b> <b>spinning</b> tension. Based on the principle of minimum potential energy, the theoretical model quantitatively describes the fiber tension distribution and its relationships with <b>the</b> <b>spinning</b> parameters, shape of <b>the</b> <b>spinning</b> triangle and <b>the</b> inclination angle of yarn spinning tension. As an application of <b>the</b> proposed method, <b>spinning</b> triangles of a modified ring spinning system were investigated under various <b>spinning</b> parameters. <b>The</b> fiber tension distributions in <b>the</b> <b>spinning</b> triangle both with and without fiber buckling were numerically simulated and the results were compared with those from our earlier model.

5|$|This left Australia {{a target}} of 404 runs for victory. At the time, {{this would have been}} the highest ever fourth innings score to result in a Test victory for the batting side.

Morris and Hassett started slowly, with only six runs in the first six overs on a pitch that offered spin and bounce. When Laker was introduced to exploit <b>the</b> <b>spin,</b> 13 runs were taken from his first over, but only 44 runs came in the first hour, leaving 360 runs needed in 285 minutes. Just 13 runs were added in the next 28 minutes before Hassett was dismissed by Compton's left arm unorthodox spin for 17 with the score at 57. Bradman joined Morris with 347 runs needed in 257 minutes. Bradman signalled his intentions on his first ball by driving Laker against <b>the</b> <b>spin</b> for a boundary. Morris promptly joined Bradman in the counter-attack, hitting three consecutive fours off Len Hutton's bowling as Australia reached lunch at 121/1. In the half hour preceding the interval, Australia had added 64 runs. Australia had given chances, but England failed to seize them.
