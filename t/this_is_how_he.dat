It shows a grown, bearded man in court dress but contains no trace of an arrow. The archers and arrows begin to appear by 1000, and ever since have been far more commonly shown than the actual moment of his death by clubbing, {{so that there is}} a popular misperception that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> died.|$|E

In 2003, he worked as a taxi driver and it is now accepted that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> first came into contact with some of his victims. It was erroneously reported that Gator City Taxi Company failed to run a background check on Durousseau; the City of Jacksonville was responsible for the background check, and issued Durousseau's taxi driver permit.|$|E

At the sending station, a key, which completed a circuit with a battery, was connected as required {{to each of the}} line wires. The passage of current caused the acid to decompose chemically, and the message was read by observing at which of the terminals the bubbles of gas appeared. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> was able to send messages, one letter at a time.|$|E

In retrospect, he identified his leadership style with Taylor's. However, Grant also wrote that the Mexican War was wrong and the territorial gains were designed to expand slavery, stating, [...] "I was bitterly opposed to the measure...and to this day, regard the war, which resulted, {{as one of the}} most unjust ever waged by a stronger against a weaker nation." [...] He opined that the Civil War was punishment on the nation for its aggression in Mexico.

500|$|Talking about {{bringing}} {{the character of}} Franklin Hall from the comics to the series, executive producer Jeffrey Bell said that the writers had looked through the comics for a character to fill the episode's role, and felt that Hall had an interesting history. Subsequently, changes were made to fit the comics character into the existing role for the series, and he ultimately appears in an origin story-type role rather than as the fully formed supervillain from the comics. As a hint at his potential to become the villain [...] "Graviton" [...] in the future, the series changed his original scientific interests from matter transportation {{to the study of}} [...] "gravitonium", a substance created for the episode. The episode's ending, which sees Hall fall into some gravitonium, indicates that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> gains his Graviton abilities in the series.|$|E

[...] Strindberg was obviously attracted to Either/Or Part II where Kierkegaard developed his categorical imperative. He wrote the following in Growth of a Soul published posthumously in 1913 about Kierkegaard’s Either—Or: [...] "it was valid only for the priests who called themselves Christians and the seducer and Don Juan were the author himself, who satisfied his desires in imagination". Part II was his [...] "Discourse on Life as a Duty, and when he {{reached the end of the}} work he found the moral philosopher in despair, and that all this teaching about duty had only produced a Philistine." [...] He then states that Kierkegaard's discourses might have led him closer to Christianity but he didn't know if he could come back to something [...] "which had been torn out, and joyfully thrown into the fire". However, after reading the book he [...] "felt sinful". Then another writer began to influence his life. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> described Either/Or: ...|$|E

2500|$|Albert Camus {{wrote about}} the idea of being a {{stranger}} in the world but reversed Kierkegaard's meaning. A stranger for Camus was someone living in the world who is forced to exist in a Christian way even though the individual {{does not want to be}} a Christian. But Kierkegaard was discussing the Christian who wants to be a Christian living in a world that has abandoned Christianity. Both Camus and Kierkegaard had in common an equal distaste for a Christian Democracy where all are forced to take a positive part in Christianity because freedom of choice would be lacking and in a non-Christian Democracy where none are allowed to take an active part in Christianity. Kierkegaard was against voting about Christianity, for him, Christ was the only authority. Camus called [...] "the existential attitude philosophical suicide."

2500|$|The {{premise of}} the series centres on a Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) constable named Benton Fraser (Paul Gross) who travels to Chicago to solve {{the murder of his}} father; <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> meets his soon-to-be partner, Ray Vecchio (David Marciano), a tough, streetwise cop. Accompanied by his deaf {{lip-reading}} half-wolf Diefenbaker (whom Fraser adopted after Diefenbaker saved his life), the investigation leads Fraser to uncover a plot by a company building a dam that is slowly killing the environment. This leads to the dam being shut down and many people losing their jobs. He also implicates corrupt members of the RCMP in the affair. This along with the loss of so many peoples' jobs makes him persona non grata in Canada, and he finds himself stationed in Chicago. This plot line is referred to repeatedly during the series, and from season three on he introduces himself to many by saying: ...|$|E

2500|$|Melchior Wańkowicz, {{a popular}} Polish journalist, met Beck {{in the autumn}} of 1939 during his {{internment}} in Romania. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> described the meeting: [...] "Beck was locked in a golden cage of a luxurious hotel in Brașov, where he and his entourage occupied one floor. He was closely guarded: whenever he went out, hordes of Allied, German and Romanian agents followed him (...) I met him at 5 in the afternoon, and our conversation continued until almost two in the morning, with a dinner break. Beck emphasized achievements of the last month of his post: a military treaty with England, Hungarian refusal to let German troops pass through their territory, droit de residence and droit de passage, granted by Romanian government. Beck believes in a solid coalition, and that we would sit at a negotiating table as partners, while Czechs would remain outside. He does not care about the fact that Lloyd George stated that Poland did not deserve help as a reactionary country. He is not bothered by the fact that Lord Halifax wants to recreate the Curzon Line. Instead, he points out that when British king gave a speech on the radio, only English, French and Polish anthems were played (...) Since I cannot tolerate this kind of wishful thinking, I ask him whether he had ever seriously considered German attack. He keeps saying that he had met Hitler several times, that Hitler backs out of discussions, that he can easily be talked into different things, that he was influenced by von Ribbentrop." ...|$|E
2500|$|Most of Orthodox Judaism {{holds that}} the teachings of Kabbalah were {{transmitted}} from teacher to teacher, in a long and continuous chain, from the Biblical era until its redaction by Shimon ben Yochai. Some fully accept the claims that the Kabbalah's teachings are in essence a revelation from God to the Biblical patriarch Abraham, Moses and other ancient figures, but were never printed and made publicly available until {{the time of the}} Zohar's medieval publication. The greatest acceptance of this sequence of events is held within Haredi Judaism, especially Chasidic groups. R' Yechiel Michel Epstein (d.1908), and R' Yisrael Meir Kagan (d.1933) both believed in the authenticity of the Zohar. Rabbis Eliyahu Dessler (d.1953) and Gedaliah Nadel (d.2004) maintained that it is acceptable to believe that the Zohar was not written by Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai and that it had a late authorship."I approached Rav A [...] with some of the questions on the Zohar, and he responded to me - 'and what about nikud? Nikud is also mentioned in the Zohar {{despite the fact that it}} [...] from Geonic times!' he said. I later found this comment in the Mitpachas Seforim. I would just add that not only is nikud mentioned, but only the Tiberian Nikkud - the norm in Europe of the middle ages - is mentioned and not the Yerushalmi nikud or the Babylonian one — which was used then in the Middle East, and is still used by Yemenites today. Also the Taamay Hamikrah - the trop - are referred to in the Zohar - only by their Sefardi Names.

2500|$|There is dispute among modern Haredim as to {{the status}} of Isaac Luria's, the Arizal's Kabbalistic teachings. While a portion of Modern Orthodox Rabbis, Dor Daim and many {{students}} of the Rambam, completely reject Arizal's Kabbalistic teachings, as well as deny that the Zohar is authoritative, or from Shimon bar Yohai, all three of these groups completely accept the existence and validity of Ma'aseh Merkavah and Ma'aseh B'resheet mysticism. Their only disagreement concerns whether the Kabbalistic teachings promulgated today are accurate representations of those esoteric teachings to which the Talmud refers. Within the Haredi Jewish community one can find both rabbis who sympathise with such a view, while not necessarily agreeing with it,(מעין אומר סימן צג עמ' עדר) available at [...] as well as rabbis who consider such a view absolute heresy.
