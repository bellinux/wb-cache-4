40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The Atkinson Committee for <b>Terotechnology</b> {{found that it was}} hampered in its task of making recommendations to the Secretary of State for Industry {{due to the lack of}} research and information regarding the application, by manufacturing industry, of terotechnological practices. It was this lack of research and information which provided a major justification for pursuing this research work. This research has attempted to provide a contribution to our knowledge in the fields of <b>terotechnology</b> and life-cycle costing. This has been achieved by investigating the historical development of <b>terotechnology,</b> examining the way in which the concept should be interpreted, developing a 'levels-of-care' model and, by industrial field research, examining the extent to which. terotechnological practices, as defined within this dissertation, have been applied by manufacturing industry. The field work was based on a sample of six manufacturing organisations in which detailed research was undertaken. A further sixteen organisations were visited to obtain a more general and wider view of application. The comparative organisational analysis, was based on the differences observed due to differing levels of production system mechanisation. The results of the field research are presented and comparisons made, to the limited extent possible, with the findings of other work. A major part of the terotechnological approach to physical asset life-cycle management is based on the comparative economic evaluation of assets over their life-cycles. Life-cycle costing is a quantitative economic evaluation technique which can be used for such comparisons. The historical development of life-cycle costing has been determined. A postal questionnaire survey,of experienced practitioners in the United States and Sweden, was undertaken to determine the general body of knowledge and experience required to utilise the technique. The results of the survey are presented. One of the major constraints on the application of life-cycle costing has been the lack of any procedural model to facilitate such application within manufacturing industry. This research has conceived and developed such a procedural model. An example of the application of the model,based on real data, is presented. Future developments in the concept and practice of <b>terotechnology</b> and life-cycle costing are postulated. Suggestions for further research work are outlined...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{the concept}} of <b>terotechnology</b> and the {{formulation}} of l$e cycle cost has been takenfiom {{the point of view}} ofthe user as against that of the manufacturer, and the stages of design, development of prototypes, manufacture and testing of the machine have not been considered. This is. felt appropriate since <b>terotechnology</b> has to date found greater application (and will continue to do so, except for military systems and installations wherein it has possibly found the greatest application) in the case of ’ large capital equipment and machines, for example for process plants, integrated iron and steelworks, power plants etc. The hazard curve provides the basis,for the estimation of the time-dependent maintenance cost incurred ouer the life cycle of an equipment. Accordinyly a system study of the hazard rate of power units of a thermal power plant was undertaken and has been presented. Using the mod$ied ‘bath-tub ’ curve obtained from the case study and the Weibull model, an equation of the total life cycle cost has been developed. Thus the model takes into account deterioration of components and system performance over time. The model brings out the efficacy of preventive main-tenance action in the form of condition monitoring and shows that the total life cycle can be increased i f appropriate preventive maintenance actions are taken in the random failure and wear-out failure regions. ...|$|E

40|$|It may be {{well said}} that the most used {{indicator}} {{of the quality of}} any technical system is reliability. Basically, this indicator shows the probability of proper technical system functioning within certain time period and under given operating conditions. To ensure that a system under construction possesses adequate given pre-defined characteristics and reliability indicators, it is necessary to plan the reliability and apply suitable methods when new technical systems are developed. Road represents an elementary traffic subsystem, as well as a technical subsystem, constructed by the society {{in order to meet the}} communication needs. Its purpose is to enable traffic system functioning. If a road is seen as a system, one can observe the features determining the structure and the principal on which its function is based. The road functioning itself is characterized by a variety of features, the most important being the management characteristic and specific social interest, categorization structure, and roadway condition. To enable smooth and safe traffic, roads should be of prescribed technical and usage levels. Reference is made specifically to road maintenance in the Primorje-Gorski Kotar County.

40|$|Despite the {{continuous}} evolving world of technology, maintenance has responded tremendously in meeting this rapid technological change. Nevertheless, inadequate maintenance {{has become one}} of the most issues faced by organizations in developing countries. Maintenance is seen as an unimportant activity in most developing countries thus, it is not given high priority due to insufficient/ minimal knowledge about the concept. Hence, the purpose of this thesis (submitted for Total Quality Maintenance at the Department of <b>Terotechnology)</b> is to enhance the perception and maintenance in developing countries. A case study was performed at Power Holding Company of Nigeria (National Electric Power Authority). The company is responsible for the production, transmission and distribution of electricity in Nigeria. The analysis shows that proper education and training can facilitate or increase the perception of maintenance in developing countries.   However, for the case company, the study shows that not having appropriate maintenance in place is the major problem behind the company’s inability to achieve its objectives. Thus maintenance practice can be improved significantly with proper maintenance education and training. The result from the study shows the concept of maintenance education and training program and who it should address. One major conclusion that can be drawn from the analysis is that major developments in developing countries are associated with modern technology from developed countries. Thus, maintenance should be given a top priority because keeping the proper functioning of the technologies depends greatly on DCs proficiency, in order to ensure viability of the development policies so as to obtain the benefit from modern technologies...|$|E

40|$|Complexity and {{uncertainty}} have impacted wind power systems and their applications. Commercial wind power asset exhibits complex system behaviour due tostochastic loading characteristics of its installation context. However, differentstakeholders’ practices in whole life cycle processes try to treat multi-disciplinarycomplexity issues. Moreover, wind power system failures, stoppages, faults, supportdelays and human/organizational errors provide a clear proof of increasingthe needs for dependability. Therefore, dependability is considered as an aggregatetheory for RAMS (Reliability, Availability, Maintainability, Safety & Supportability) {{in order to}} cope with complex systems (i. e. physical systems and their assetmanagement systems) and their behaviour phenomenon. Consequently, to addresswind power practical problem {{as one of the}} modern complex and interdependentsystems, it is worth to enhance both the way of how we look at dependability andthe method of inquiry. Technical system complexity, system interdependency andsystem learn-ability are the main challenges within system dependability field. Therefore, this research work is done to integrate both <b>terotechnology</b> and systemsengineering methodologies to enhance systems dependability theory and practices. In particular, it focuses on three main aspects within systems dependability engineering:challenges, practitioners’ concepts and system-level methodologies. The research methodology of this thesis has utilised the mixed research approachof qualitative and quantitative methods to extract the empirical findings that arerequired to validate the dependability theory developments. Qualitative survey isused to identify the challenges of dependability theory within wind power applications. Grounded theory is used to define the practical understanding of windpower stakeholders concerning to dependability and asset management concepts. Case study is implemented to validate the systems dependability engineering, ascross edge theory of dependability and systems engineering. Moreover, the phenomenographymethod is used to capture the individual experiences and understandingof purposefully selected stakeholders, due to different site-specific circumstancesfor each wind farm. In general, the thesis contributes to the body of knowledge of five fields: dependability,terotechnology, asset management, systems engineering and wind energy. In particular, the focus of thesis contributes with retrospective review to be as referenceline for system dependability theory. Simultaneously, on basis of empiricalfindings, it contributes to be a pivot point for further enhancements from both theacademic contributions and industrial developments...|$|E
40|$|Administration of {{maintenance}} in developmentSummary Industrial Maintenance has evolved rapidly {{to become an}} important factor in any national economy. In this study Maintenance is looked upon as an administrative problem rather than a technical one. Therefore, it is not the technical department that should be studied in the first place, but the whole integral or overall control of the maintenance process in the factory, in which several departments are involved at the same time. The purpose of the study is then to find an answer to the question, whether there can he designed an effective system or basic pattern of administration, and, if so, under which conditions or circumstances, that can cover the overall control of the maintenance process in a factory. Up to 1970, Maintenance seemed to he regarded in the Netherlands and other industrialised countries as mainly the problem of the technical department, and the well-functioning of this department was to depend on the existence of an appropriate system of specialisation and efficiency. In practice however, it created red-tape and low quality performance {{of maintenance}} work. So, after 1970 the above mentioned idea was gradually abandonned, and the discussions then increasingly focused on the problem of co-ordination or co-operation between the technical department and the other relevant departments. Therefore, {{since the beginning of the}} eventies the growing attention in the industrialised countries was towards integral concepts concerning the control of machinery and buildings. In this context the most important concept seems to be the <b>Terotechnology</b> idea, which is integratedly concerned with the installation, the efficient operation, and the maintenance of equipment and machinery. The need for good management then becomes obvious, and increasingly management is regarded and recognised everywhere as the crucial factor for maintenance control. Decentralisation or delegation of authority bound to clear-cut well-defined policies down from the top of the organisation are seen as ways to improve management for maintenance control. Matrixorganisation and job enlargement, together with computerised information systems, are increasingly becoming very important. Numerous books and writings on maintenance management are mentioning at different places 'tailor-made' organising, but no guiding principles for its practical application can be found to solve maintenance management problems in practice. Nothing important can be said about the development of a Maintenance Theory as such up to the present, while the need for appropriate maintenance technology is apparant as the basis for effective decisions concerning the controlling and optimising of maintenance in general. In this study, a special approach to organisations has been used in the analysis and research of the maintenance problem. The thoughts on organisation theory as have been laid down by Kampfraath in the sixties, focus on the aspect of administrative processes and their results, rather than on organisational structures. In this context, administrative results are kept in so-called'four basic administrative concerns', namely: the strategic, the conditioning, the effectuating, and the operational concern. It is obvious however, that in practice continuous attention should he paid toward each of thew concerns. The performance of the administrative tasks is indirectly influenced by so-called 'administrative conditions'. Four categories of administrative conditions am to be taken into consideration: the administrative personnel, the organisational rules and arrangements, the provision of information, and the administrative means (computers, methods, models). One basic point of view should he born in mind however, namely the fact that there is not one single 'best way of administration' that can be designed which is universally applicable. Every problem, every case or object of concern needs some kind of 'tailor-made' solution. In this matter, the concept of 'level of perfection' can be formulated as to provide for the measurement of administrative processes. Based on the above-mentioned 'administrative concerns', the administration of maintenance can be confined to the following six fields of attention, i. e. (1) maintenance and business strategy, (2) determination of maintenance needs, (3) maintenance strategy, (4) control of the technical department, (5) work preparation and study, and (6) work flow control. Every 'field of attention' as mentioned above has been made measurable according to 'levels of perfection' (using rates 0 - 100). Besides, the most important quantifiable elements of each of the four categories of 'administrative conditions' are grouped and scaled for the purpose of their rating. To determine the most appropriate pattern of administration, several factors of influence are to be recognized, such as: administrative-technical factors, some elements of the business situation directly affecting the company, the maintenance policy, and cost-benefit analysis results of the maintenance. This study is ultimately meant as in attempt to find an answer to the question about wich factors are essential to the choice of a way or pattern of administration, and particularly to arrive at the most appropriate system of administration for maintenance management in a given situation. For this purpose, some 149 big industrial films in the Netherlands have been studied from 1973 to 1977. The investigations have been conducted primarily through the questionnaire method, using forms with a multiple choice to several possible answers. The questionnaire used had first been tested in a specific firm, then applied to five branches of industry, namely: the graphical industry, the chemical, the food processing, the metal works, and the electrical industry, but in addition, also a group of firms working in paper, textiles, tobacco, and building materials. The processing and analysis of the data collected are performed along a standard procedure. High as well as low 'levels of perfection' have been found in practice during the study, depending on certain specific elements in the business situation (particularly concerning the maintenance, being intensive or extensive), and on the maintenance policy. The study revealed that the average 'level of perfection' among the above-mentioned 149 firms was 46 (at the scale of 0 to 100) at a rate or extent of maintenance of about 50 man/years. The study has also found some indicators to determine the desirable or proper level of perfection for each of the six fields of attention, relating to costs and benefits of maintenance. It is surprising, however, to find that in some firms a rather low level of perfection proved to be an appropriate system of administration. In general, it can be said that there should be some kind of balance or constancy in the levels of perfection within each of the six fields of attention. Particular policies on maintenance may lead, however, to deviations. Therefore about ten typical 'perfection patterns' could he identified. The higher the levels of perfection, the more conditions or provisions are required in terms of organisational rules and arrangements, of information, and of administrative means. In the case of administrative personnel as one of the four administrative conditions, for instance, a change of qualitative requirements may occur. The conclusion may be drawn form the study that the organisation of maintenance administration required some kind of tailor-made solutions, which, as the study has inter alia shown, can be found and formulated properly. However, special attention should be given and mention should be made to the fact that the results of this research or study project depend rather largely on: the personality of the researcher, the specific way of looking at organisations, and the methods of study used. The approach toward organisations used in this study can he called 'decision making oriented', in which administrative behaviour is central. The explicit orientation towards 'administrative result' in terms of so-called 'administrative concerns' is the essential difference with any other approaches. As far as the methods of investigation is concerned, they can be stated in terms of inductive, descriptive and problem-oriented, with a rather high level of quantification. The study-project can be characterised as scientific research, and an attempt to provide answers to realistic questions of practical life in firms, so that the result of the investigations may be applicable in many ways. It can be noticed that the most important remarkable developments in maintenance and its related problems are due to the increasingly growing complexity in production machinery set-ups, in the increasing involvement of so many disciplines, in the increasing costs of breakdowns of machinery as one of the hazards of automation, in the growing concern about condition-based maintenance, and finally in the problematic necessity for decentralisation of decision making. These developments naturally lead to changes in the nature or pattern of administrative processes concerned. On the one hand higher levels of perfection are required or necessary in the fields of maintenance related to business policy, and the determination of maintenance needs. On the other hand, however, lower levels of perfection are likely to occur more often in the fields of work preparation and work-flow control. Next more attention should be paid to maintenance studies and analyses. In this matter a number of conditions will especially contribute to the required or desired changes in the administrative processes, of which the most important tendencies arc: management development, co-operation design, decentralisation of authority, goal- or objectiveoriented information systems, and automated or computerised information processing. Specific solutions however should be adapted to the requirements of the specific situation, as made measurable by means of the research findings...|$|E
