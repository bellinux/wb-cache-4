50|$|Thiosulfate-citrate-bile salts-sucrose agar, or TCBS agar, {{is a type}} of {{selective}} agar culture plate that is used in microbiology laboratories to isolate Vibrio secies. TCBS agar is highly selective for the isolation of V. cholerae and V. parahaemolyticus as well as other Vibrio species. TCBS agar contains high concentrations of sodium thiosulfate and sodium citrate to inhibit the growth of Enterobacteriaceae. Inhibition of Gram-positive bacteria is achieved by the incorporation of ox gall, which is a naturally occurring substance containing a mixture of bile salts and sodium cholate, a pure bile salt. Sodium thiosulfate also serves as a sulfur source and its presence, in combination with ferric citrate, allows for the easy detection of hydrogen sulfide production. Saccharose (sucrose) is included as a fermentable carbohydrate for metabolism by Vibrio species. The alkaline pH of the medium enhances the recovery of V. cholerae and inhibits the growth of others. <b>Thymol</b> <b>blue</b> and bromothymol blue are included as indicators of pH changes.|$|E

40|$|A lifetime-based {{optical sensor}} for the {{measurement}} of dissolved and gaseous carbon dioxide has been developed.

In the presence of carbon dioxide <b>thymol</b> <b>blue</b> is protonated and changes its color from blue to yellow resulting in {{a decrease in the}} rate of energy transfer and consequently an increase in decay time.
