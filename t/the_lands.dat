In 1135, Basset's lands totalled 184.25 carucates of land, and were later {{considered}} 15 knight's fees. In Leicestershire, Basset held most of <b>the</b> <b>lands</b> held by Robert de Buci {{at the time of}} the Domesday Survey of 1086. <b>The</b> <b>lands</b> were held by Basset of the king by right of his wife, but how <b>the</b> <b>lands</b> had passed into her family is unclear. In addition, Basset held land in Leicestershire from both King David I of Scotland and from Robert de Beaumont, the Earl of Leicester.|$|E
5|$|Before he {{controlled}} Deddington, Chesney temporarily administered <b>the</b> <b>lands</b> of Robert d'Oilly, who {{had previously}} held Oxford Castle but had defected {{to the side of}} the Empress Matilda in 1141 and died a year later. D'Oilly's heir took refuge with Matilda when Stephen overran his lands two weeks after his father's death, leading to Chesney's control of the d'Oilly lands. Some historians have seen this holding of <b>the</b> <b>lands</b> as Stephen giving Chesney the d'Oilly barony, but the only evidence for this is that Chesney eventually owned a manor previously belonging to d'Oilly which does not necessarily mean that he received the whole barony. It is far more likely that Stephen gave Chesney parts of <b>the</b> <b>lands</b> of William fitzOsbern, which had reverted to the king in 1075. Most of the known lands of fitzOsbern are known to have been owned by Chesney or by tenants who held <b>the</b> <b>lands</b> from him.|$|E

5|$|Scant early records exist of <b>the</b> <b>lands</b> but Alexander Stewart (Alexandro Senescalli), {{the natural}} son of King Robert II of Scotland, {{was given the}} Pitfour lands {{together}} with those of Lunan by his father in 1383.

Transactions show it passed to a burgess of Aberdeen in 1477 from Egidia Stewart; Walter Innes of Invermarkie gained feudal superiority to all Pitfour lands in 1493; and in 1506 the land was purchased by Thomas Innes, who died the following year.

Hemmings' Cartulary mentions not just Azur's lands, but others at Acton Beauchamp, Clopton, and Redmarley as taken from the diocese of Worcester by Urse.
