5|$|Grissom's {{spacecraft}} {{was recovered}} in 1999, but no further evidence was found which could conclusively {{explain how the}} explosive hatch release had occurred. Later, Guenter Wendt, pad leader for the early American manned space launches, wrote that he believed a small cover over the external release actuator was accidentally lost sometime during the flight or splashdown, and the <b>T-handle</b> may have been tugged by a stray parachute suspension line, or was perhaps damaged by the heat of re-entry and, after cooling upon splashdown, contracted and fired.|$|E
2500|$|For 1956, styling {{highlights}} {{included a}} new split grille {{in front and}} revised taillights and deck along with revised side chroming. Horsepower for the 324 Rocket V8 increased to 230 for 88s and 240 for Super 88s. A new four-speed Jetaway Hydra-Matic was introduced this year to replace the original Hydra-Matic transmission that Olds had used since 1940. The new Jetaway Hydra-Matic retained the four forward speeds and fluid coupling unit, but added a new [...] "Park" [...] position to the shift quadrant and no longer required band adjustment as a specified routine maintenance. Inside, an oval speedometer replaced the round unit and a new foot-operated parking brake replaced the previous <b>T-handle</b> unit.|$|E

50|$|Neck knives {{are usually}} single-edged, with blade lengths {{typically}} under four inches, and frequently {{less than three}} inches. They are primarily intended for utilitarian use, although non-utilitarian versions (i.e., daggers and <b>T-handled</b> push daggers) also exist.|$|R
5000|$|British comedian Lee Mack donated a <b>T-handled</b> dibber to the British Lawnmower Museum, Southport, {{and spoke}} {{about it on}} the panel game show Would I Lie to You? (Series six, Episode three, first {{broadcast}} 27 April 2012 [...] ).|$|R
50|$|A dibber or dibble or dibbler is {{a pointed}} wooden stick for making {{holes in the}} ground so that seeds, {{seedlings}} or small bulbs can be planted. Dibbers {{come in a variety}} of designs including the straight dibber, <b>T-handled</b> dibber, trowel dibber, and L-shaped dibber.|$|R
50|$|Apex Tool Group {{currently}} manufactures Allen-branded {{products in}} Dallas, Texas and Shanghai, China. They {{are made in}} L-key, folding, and <b>T-handle</b> styles.|$|E
50|$|H. Julius Smith also {{invented the}} first {{satisfactory}} portable power supply for igniting blasting caps: a high-voltage magneto that {{was driven by}} a rack and pinion, which in turn was driven by a <b>T-handle</b> that was pushed downwards.|$|E
5000|$|The {{push dagger}} {{also was a}} {{favorite}} weapon in 19th-century San Francisco, California. [...] The San Francisco style of push dagger tended to have a slightly longer blade {{than that of the}} gimlet knife and was most often equipped with a <b>T-handle</b> made of walrus ivory.|$|E
50|$|These are {{specialized}} {{torque wrenches}} used by plumbers {{to tighten the}} clamping bands on hubless soil pipe couplings. They are usually <b>T-handled</b> wrenches with a one-way combination ratchet and clutch. They are preset to a fixed torque designed to adequately secure the coupling but insufficient to damage it.|$|R
5000|$|The gun is {{intended}} to be a single-shot weapon held in the palm of the hand with the barrel extending between the fingers. The trigger would be at the top, squeezed by the user's thumb. [...] Carmel stated, [...] "I was sitting in my workshop one day, playing around with a <b>T-handled</b> screwdriver. And I was thinking about the recurring problem I have with the seniors I teach, loading cartridges, locking slides and hand weakness… I was thinking minimalist. If I start with just a cartridge, what is the minimal thing I have to put around it in order to ignite the primer and send this projectile downrange?" [...] The <b>T-handled</b> screwdriver made Carmel realize that all he needed was a barrel, a breech, and a short butt or handle.|$|R
50|$|<b>T-handled</b> {{releases}} are hand-held releases {{that rely}} {{on the strength of}} one's fingers. The release is held in the fist, with the mechanism usually poking out between index and middle finger. A handled release uses one of two different styles of a mechanism either by using a back tension or a thumb switch. These styles of releases are most popular with tournament archers and sometimes in tree stands.|$|R
5000|$|The use of {{the term}} [...] "machine" [...] dates from early designs that used an {{electrical}} generator operated by winding a rotary handle or pushing down a <b>T-handle.</b> Modern blasting machines are battery-powered and operated by key switches and push-buttons, and do not resemble the older designs.|$|E
50|$|The earlier Nova Cruz Xootr {{was made}} with a plastic handle cap which is prone to breakage. This {{is part of the}} {{mechanism}} for clamping the <b>T-Handle</b> at the correct user height. The current version is aluminum and an upgrade kit is available, with downloadable instructions. See the Xootr website.|$|E
50|$|Air Raid is a 1982 shoot 'em up {{published}} for the Atari 2600 by Men-A-Vision, {{the only}} game released by the company. The cartridge is a blue <b>T-handle</b> design {{with a picture of}} flying saucers attacking a futuristic city. It had extremely limited distribution, making it highly sought after by video game collectors.|$|E
5000|$|A {{push dagger}} (alternately known as: push knife, gimlet knife, fist knife, Stoßdolch (German), push dirk, <b>T-handled</b> knife or punch dagger) is a short-bladed dagger with a [...] "T" [...] handle {{designed}} to be grasped in the hand so that the blade protrudes {{from the front of}} one's fist, typically between the index and middle finger. Over the centuries, the push dagger has gone up and down in popularity as a close-combat weapon for civilians and selected military forces.|$|R
50|$|Thumb switch release {{aids are}} the most complicated, with the most moving parts of the three most common releases. They work on the {{depression}} of a thumb switch that is mounted to a <b>T-handle's</b> style of release. The attraction to these release aids are {{that they are a}} good midpoint between a caliper and back tension style of release aids, making the transition {{from one to the other}} a little smoother over a longer period of time.|$|R
50|$|Before boring {{machines}} were invented, carpenters used hand-powered augers to bore holes. Most common were <b>T-handled</b> augers. The {{shape of the}} drill bits changed over time, with the spoon bit and shell bit being common before {{the invention of the}} spiral or twist bit in 1771 which removes the cuttings as it turns. The exact origin of this invention is not known, but the earliest patent is in the United States in 1830 by J. Beckwith and was as tall as a man and operated by a large wheel from the side.|$|R
5000|$|... ==History== The {{push dagger}} {{is thought to}} have {{originated}} from the Indian subcontinent, and is related in principle to the 16th-century Indian katar (कटार), or punching sword. [...] However, the katar is gripped by two close-set vertical bars, while a push dagger uses a <b>T-handle</b> and a blade that protrudes between the fingers when properly gripped.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{satisfactory}} {{magnetic induction}} blasting machine {{was constructed in}} 1878 by Henry Julius Smith of Mountain View, New Jersey. [...] Its mechanism consisted of a <b>T-handle</b> that was pushed down; {{the lower end of}} the handle was a rack that drove a pinion, which in turn drove a high-voltage magneto, which generated the high voltage that is required to detonate the blasting cap.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two main}} types of tap wrenches: double-end {{adjustable}} wrenches and <b>T-handle</b> wrenches. Double-end adjustable wrenches, also known as bar wrenches, have one threaded handle which is attached {{to one of the}} clamps. The clamp is opened to insert the tool and then tightened down against the tool to secure it. This type of tap wrench is used with larger taps and where there is room to turn a larger wrench.|$|E
50|$|Back tension release {{aids are}} the {{simplest}} mechanically, {{with only one}} moving part. However, {{as a result of}} this, they are the hardest style of release to learn how to use. The aid relies on the muscle tension through the forearms and back in order to release the latch {{at the end of the}} <b>T-handle's</b> leg. These releases are known for their accuracy and dependability on the tournament archery scene. They depend on the fulcrum of a lever over a half-moon-shaped piece of metal in order for the release to go off.|$|R
40|$|We report 2 {{cases of}} late {{recurrence}} of osteosarcoma after 6 and 7 years. One patient had pulmonary metastasis, {{and the other}} had soft tissue recurrence. Both patients underwent complete resection and chemotherapy. The first patient achieved complete remission and remained disease-free 47 months later and had no limitation in his daily life. The second patient had a re-recurrence and underwent further resection and chemotherapy. He remained disease-free 35 months later and could walk using a <b>T-handled</b> walking cane. Key words: neoplasm metastasis; neoplasm recurrence, local; osteosarcoma introduction Long-term survival of patients with osteosarcoma is 10 % to 20 % after surgical resection alone.

2500|$|Drummers use a drum key for tuning their {{drums and}} {{adjusting}} some drum hardware. Besides the basic type of drum key (a <b>T-handled</b> wrench) {{there are various}} tuning wrenches and tools. Basic drum keys are divided in three types which allows tuning of three types of tuning screws on drums: square (most used), slotted and hexagonal. Ratchet-type wrenches allow high-tension drums to be tuned easily. Spin keys (utilizing a ball joint) allow rapid head changing. Torque-wrench type keys are available, graphically revealing the torque at each lug. Also, tension gauges, or meters, which are set on the head, aid drummers to achieve a consistent tuning. Drummers can tune drums [...] "by ear" [...] or, in the 2010s, use a digital drum tuner, which [...] "measures tympanic pressure" [...] on the drumhead to provide accurate tuning.|$|R
50|$|Standard {{equipment}} {{included the}} Starfire's 345 hp (257 kW) 394 cubic-inch Rocket V8 engine, but lacked its automatic transmission, power steering, power brakes, leather interior, and distinctive brightwork trim. Included were bucket seats, center console, carpeting, full wheel covers, and padded instrument panel. A three-speed column-shift manual transmission was standard, with a three-speed Roto Hydra-matic automatic with console-mounted <b>T-handle</b> shifter optional. Adding just automatic transmission, power steering, and power brakes brought the 4028 lb Jetstar I's price close to $4,000.|$|E
5000|$|... 1976 was the Dart's {{final year}} in the North American market. The {{rear-view}} mirror was mounted on the windshield {{rather than from the}} roof. Front disc brakes became standard equipment on 1 January 1976 in accord with more stringent U.S. federal brake performance requirements, and a new foot-operated parking brake replaced the under-dash <b>T-handle</b> used since the Dart's 1963 introduction as a compact car. The grille's parking lamps were cast in amber, whereas the previous years had clear lenses with amber-colored bulbs.|$|E

30|$|We {{sought to}} examine {{which of the}} two methods held the half pin better; this was tested in loading similar to those {{encountered}} in clinical practice. Two participants were each asked to secure 5 half pins using grub screws and 5 half pins using standard 10 -mm bolts {{in the same manner as}} the first part of our experiment. The Rancho cubes were released from the rings, and the whole half pin–Rancho cube construct was removed from the saw bone using <b>T-handles.</b> The constructs were then placed on a universal testing machine—UTM (Fig.  1 d), and increasing axial loading was applied to determine loosening points. This was determined as mechanical failure on the load deformation curve and was associated with loosening at the interface between the pin and Rancho cube.|$|R
50|$|During World War I entrenching tools became {{extremely}} important {{with the introduction}} of trench warfare. Entrenching tools designed for the individual infantryman soon appeared with short straight handles, <b>T-handles,</b> D-handles, and other designs. The British entrenching tool of this period was a two part design, with a metal head and a wooden handle, the metal head consisted of an adze/spade blade and a pick spike, used alone the head {{could be used as a}} spade with the pick spike serving as a handle. Between the blade and the spike was a ring into which the handle could be inserted at right angles to the head, with the handle inserted the tool could be used as a pick mattock. Besides being used for digging defensive fighting positions, entrenching tools were used for digging latrines and graves.|$|R

50|$|The Firebird {{remained}} basically unchanged {{from the}} previous model year. All automatic transmission Firebirds now received a <b>T-handle</b> shifter knob, and the shift indicator changed for the Automatic Overdrive 700-R4. Midyear, the L69 high output 305 was introduced. This carbureted 190 hp V8 was virtually identical to the L69 engine in the Camaro Z28, but used a different air cleaner assembly (instead of the Camaro's dual-snorkel air cleaner, the Trans Am received yet another functional cold air intake, designed to utilize the bulged hood).|$|E
50|$|In 1976, the Grabber was dropped, and a Stallion {{package was}} introduced. The Stallion option came with special paint and trim. Like the Sprint package four years earlier, Ford offered the Stallion option on several models, this time {{including}} the Pinto {{and the new}} Mustang II. The Comet GT was also discontinued. Standard Mavericks received another new grille and gained front disc brakes as standard equipment along with a new foot-operated parking brake that replaced the old under-dash <b>T-handle</b> unit. Production continued to drop.|$|E
5000|$|B61 {{administrative}} procedures performed by ground-based personnel are executed via an access panel {{located on the}} side of the bomb, which opens to reveal 9 dials, 2 sockets and a <b>T-handle</b> which manually triggers the [...] "command disable" [...] function. One of the sockets is a MC4142 [...] "strike enable" [...] plug which must be inserted in order to complete critical circuits in the safety/arming and firing mechanisms. The other socket is the PAL connector located in the top right hand corner of the arming panel, which has 23 pins marked with alphabetic letter codes.|$|E
50|$|The 1971 Hurst Jeepster {{built with}} {{modifications}} by Hurst Performance is possibly the scarcest model of all production Jeeps. Standard equipment included a Champagne White exterior {{with red and}} blue stripes, a roof rack, a sports steering wheel, and Goodyear G70 x 15 raised white letter tires mounted on wider steel wheels. Hurst equipment included special exterior insignia, an 8,000-rpm tachometer {{on the back of}} the hood scoop in the driver's line of sight, as well as a Hurst <b>T-handle</b> shifter on manual-transmission cars or a console-mounted Hurst Dual-Gate shifter with the optional automatic transmission.|$|E
5000|$|The New Orleans-style {{push dagger}} {{was known as}} the gimlet knife. [...] The gimlet knife had a short two-inch (50 mm) blade with a [...] "gimlet" [...] or <b>T-handle.</b> [...] It was a common weapon in the city during the 1800s, and was usually slipped into a boot or {{concealed}} inside a coat sleeve, or else hung on a waistcoat button by a strap attached to the knife's leather sheath. [...] The gimlet knife was used in so many riots, fights, and murders in New Orleans that the city passed an ordinance in 1879 prohibiting anyone within city limits from selling, offering or exhibiting such a weapon for sale.|$|E
