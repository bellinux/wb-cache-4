25|$|The {{squadron}} was activated as VMJ-253 in the Western Pacific on March 11, 1942. VMJ-253 pioneered <b>Trans-oceanic</b> <b>transport</b> in the Marine Corps during World War II. It {{also became}} the parent squadron {{for the joint}} air transport organization dubbed the South Pacific Combat Air Transport Command (SCAT). Lieutenant Colonel Perry K. Smith, USMC, became the first Commanding Officer of SCAT. By November 1942, VMJ-253 had supported operations on Guadalcanal and surrounding islands, logging thousands of flight hours.|$|E
40|$|Oceanic rafting {{is thought}} to play a {{fundamental}} role in assembling the biological communities of isolated coastal ecosystems. Direct observations of this key ecological and evolutionary process are, however, critically lacking. The importance of macroalgal rafting as a dispersal mechanism has remained uncertain, largely owing to lack of knowledge about the capacity of fauna to survive long voyages at sea and successfully make landfall and establish. Here, we directly document the rafting of a diverse assemblage of intertidal organisms across several hundred kilometres of open ocean, from the subantarctic to mainland New Zealand. Multispecies analyses using phylogeographic and ecological data indicate that 10 epifaunal invertebrate species rafted on six large bull kelp specimens for several weeks from the subantarctic Auckland and/or Snares Islands to the Otago coast of New Zealand, a minimum distance of some 400 â€“ 600 km. These genetic data are the first to demonstrate that passive rafting can enable simultaneous <b>trans-oceanic</b> <b>transport</b> and landfall of numerous coastal taxa...|$|E
40|$|Crabs of {{the genus}} Plagusia Latreille, 1804 (Crustacea: Brachyura: Plagusiidae) are well known for their habit of {{clinging}} to driftwood or ship hulls and are therefore prone to <b>trans-oceanic</b> <b>transport.</b> One {{of the consequences of}} this large dispersal potential seems to be the circumtropical distribution of one species, Plagusia depressa (Fabricius, 1775). This species comprises two subspecies, the Atlantic P. d. depressa and the Indo-Pacific P. d. squamosa (Herbst, 1790) (=P. d. tuberculata Lamarck, 1818). There are only subtle differences in adult morphology between these subspecies. For further comparison of the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific populations, we describe the morphology of the first zoeal stage of P. d. squamosa and the megalopa of P. d. depressa and present sequence data of the mitochondrial 16 S rRNA gene. The comparison of zoeae, megalopae and mtDNA all provide evidence that the two subspecies of Plagusia depressa are clearly distinct. We therefore propose that Plagusia squamosa deserves species status, that the adult morphology is conserved, and that the major continents represent barriers for dispersal of this rafting tropical crab...|$|E
40|$|With {{increasing}} {{public awareness}} {{and concern for}} the environment, recent fuel spills {{have shown that the}} cost to a company can far outweigh than the downtime and cleanup expenses. As more stringent statutory regulations are introduced in the developed countries, cost effective and reliable leak detection systems are in demand. Pipelines are generally the most economical way of transporting large quantities of oil over land, compared to the cost of shipping by railroad. Although pipelines are also built under the sea, the process is economically and technically demanding, which means that the majority of <b>trans-oceanic</b> oil is <b>transported</b> by oil tanker ships...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{the performances of}} the energy recovery pathway from the residual waste based on {{the production of a}} Solid Recovered Fuel (SRF) to be exploited via co-combustion in a cement kiln. The SRF is produced in a single stream Mechanical-Biological Treatment plant, where bio-drying of the waste is followed by mechanical refining in order to fulfil the quality requirements by the cement kilns. Peculiar of this MBT is the fact that sorting residues are disposed in a nearby landfill, managed according to a bioreactor approach, where landfill gas is collected for electric energy recovery. A detailed mass and energy balance of the system is presented based on one year operational data, followed by its Life Cycle Assessment. Results show that the system is energetically and environmentally effective, with most of the impacts being more than compensated by the savings of materials and energy. Major role in determining such outcome is the displacement of petcoke in the cement kiln, both in terms of its fossil CO 2 emissions and of its life cycle impacts, including the <b>trans-oceanic</b> <b>transport.</b> To check the robustness of the results, two sensitivity analyses are performed on the landfill gas collection efficiency and on the avoided electric energy mix...|$|E
