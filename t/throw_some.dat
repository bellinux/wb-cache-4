5|$|WHEN {{on board}} HMS Beagle, as naturalist, I was much struck with certain {{facts in the}} {{distribution}} of the inhabitants of South America, and in the geological relations of the present to the past inhabitants of that continent. These facts seemed to me to <b>throw</b> <b>some</b> light on the origin of species—that mystery of mysteries, as it has been called by one of our greatest philosophers.|$|E
5|$|This act of submission, {{unique among}} the various rebels of the time, may <b>throw</b> <b>some</b> light on Melissenos's {{motivation}} for his uprising, according to the historian Jean-Claude Cheynet. Cheynet believes that Melissenos was probably more concerned with safeguarding his Asian estates from the depredations of the Turks, and when Alexios granted him Thessalonica and equivalent estates around it – some of which Melissenos later distributed to his clients, like the Bourtzes family – he readily gave up the contest for the Byzantine throne.|$|E
5|$|Vaughan Williams's {{recollections}} <b>throw</b> <b>some</b> {{light on}} Ravel's private life, about which the latter's reserved and secretive personality {{has led to}} much speculation. Vaughan Williams, Rosenthal and Marguerite Long have all recorded that Ravel frequented brothels. Long attributed this to his self-consciousness about his diminutive stature, and consequent lack of confidence with women. By other accounts, none of them first-hand, Ravel {{was in love with}} Misia Edwards, or wanted to marry the violinist Hélène Jourdan-Morhange. Rosenthal records and discounts contemporary speculation that Ravel, a lifelong bachelor, may have been homosexual. Such speculation recurred in a 2000 life of Ravel by Benjamin Ivry; subsequent studies have concluded that Ravel's sexuality and personal life remain a mystery.|$|E

5|$|When {{a chance}} arose {{for him to}} escape to a safe country, Edwin chose to remain at Rædwald's court. He was then visited by a {{stranger}} who was aware of Rædwald's deliberations. The source for this story, written at Whitby, stated that the stranger was Paulinus of York, {{a member of the}} Canterbury mission, who offered Edwin the hope of Rædwald's support and held out the prospect that Edwin might someday attain greater royal power than any previous English king. Paulinus was assured by Edwin that he would accept his religious teaching. His vision of Paulinus was afterwards made the means of his decision to embrace Christianity, on the condition that he survived and achieved power. If, as is supposed by some, Paulinus appeared to him in the flesh, the bishop's presence at Rædwald's court would <b>throw</b> <b>some</b> light on the king's position regarding religion.|$|E
25|$|Many {{hydraulic}} {{disc brakes}} have a self-adjusting mechanism {{so as the}} brake pad wears, the pistons keep {{the distance from the}} pad to the disc consistent to maintain the same brake lever <b>throw.</b> <b>Some</b> hydraulic brakes, especially older ones, and most mechanical discs have manual controls to adjust the pad-to-rotor gap. Several adjustments are often required during the life of the pads.|$|E
25|$|Drums {{players for}} Rock Band 4 {{are able to}} count down to start the song as often done by real-life bands. Rock Band 4 will change how the drummer can trigger overdrive: unlike past titles, where the drummer would gain a free-form section and then strike a {{specific}} pad to activate overdrive, which Harmonix found would <b>throw</b> <b>some</b> players off, Rock Band 4 presents one of a random number of pre-created drum fills that fit {{the timing of the}} song when the drummer player has Overdrive available. This feature is backward compatible with all previous songs in the Rock Band library.|$|E

25|$|Captain John Craig {{was again}} her captain {{when she left}} The Downs on 3 April 1815. A few days before she left a violent gale carried away two anchors and cables. On 27 July she reached Madras, and on 19 August Diamond Harbour. For the return trip she passed Saugor on 11 November. In December she loaded the 59th Regiment of Foot and {{conveyed}} them to Madras. At Madras she grounded on the Pulicat shoal and her crew had to <b>throw</b> <b>some</b> of her cargo overboard to lighten her. She reached Madras on 25 December, Bombay on 1 February 1816, Madras again on 5 April, and St Helena on 20 July. She arrived at The Downs on 12 September.|$|E

He later wrote that such facts [...] "seemed to me to <b>throw</b> <b>some</b> light {{on the origin of}} species".|$|E

500|$|Longtime scout Charlie Metro {{remembered the}} havoc caused by Henderson: '"I {{did a lot}} of study and I found that it's {{impossible}} to throw Rickey Henderson out. I started using stopwatches and everything. I found it was impossible to <b>throw</b> <b>some</b> other guys out also. They can go from first to second in 2.9 seconds; and no pitcher catcher combination in baseball could throw from here to there to tag second in 2.9 seconds, it was always 3, 3.1, 3.2. So actually, the runner that can make the continuous, regular move like Rickey's can't be thrown out, and he's proven it." ...|$|E

Written in {{the same}} postmodern style as Jonathan Strange, the [...] "introduction" [...] to the {{collection}} by fictional Professor Sutherland speculates on the [...] "sources" [...] for the stories. Clarke begins by describing his [...] "two very modest aims": [...] "The first is to <b>throw</b> <b>some</b> sort {{of light on the}} development of magic in the British Isles at different periods; the second is to introduce the reader to some {{of the ways in which}} Faerie can impinge upon our own quotidian world, in other words to create a sort of primer to Faerie and fairies." ...|$|E

500|$|Collingwood {{had died}} in 1781 and the only witness of the {{massacre}} to appear at Westminster Hall was passenger Robert Stubbs, although a written affidavit by first mate James Kelsall was {{made available to the}} lawyers. Stubbs claimed that there was [...] "an absolute Necessity for throwing over the Negroes", because the crew feared all the slaves would die if they did not <b>throw</b> <b>some</b> into the sea. The insurers argued that Collingwood had made [...] "a Blunder and Mistake" [...] in sailing beyond Jamaica and that the slaves had been killed so their owners could claim compensation. They alleged that Collingwood did this because he did not want his first voyage as a slave ship captain to be unprofitable.|$|E
500|$|Keene's {{career as}} the [...] "Eagle Lady" [...] began {{shortly after her}} arrival in Homer, when one morning she noticed two bald eagles on the beach near her motorhome. Keene saw {{offering}} food to the eagles as {{a natural extension of}} her practice of keeping bird feeders filled with sunflower seeds for wild songbirds. She began to bring home surplus fish in a bucket from her job, and each morning would <b>throw</b> <b>some</b> fish to the eagles over the short driftwood fence she had made around her motorhome. By the end of that spring, a half-dozen eagles were showing up for breakfast. The eagles departed with the arrival of summer, when the Spit became more active with human visitors, but they returned in the winter when tourist season had ended, and Keene resumed the daily feeding.|$|E
500|$|Some {{academics}} {{have questioned}} {{the accuracy of the}} Reports. Coke's famous Case of Proclamations, and his speech there, was first brought into the public consciousness through its inclusion in Volume12 of his Reports, and Roland G. Usher, writing in the English Historical Review, notes that [...] "Certain manuscripts at Hatfield House and elsewhere seem to <b>throw</b> <b>some</b> doubt upon this famous account of a famous interview". One of the reasons given for possible inaccuracies in the later volumes of the Reports is that they were published posthumously. In July 1634, officials acting on order of the King had seized Coke's papers, but a 1641 motion in the House of Commons restored the extant papers to Coke's eldest son. [...] The twelfth and thirteenth volumes of the reports were based on fragments of notes several decades old, not on Coke's original manuscript.|$|E

500|$|... "Blow" [...] is a electropop and dance-pop {{song that}} uses a synth infused beat as a backing. [...] The song opens with {{laughing}} followed by a command to dance. As the chorus of the song starts in, Kesha's vocals change into an auto-tuned [...] "stuttering" [...] as she repeats [...] "This place about to blow" [...] four times over an electro beat. During the song's bridge, Kesha's vocals change pace into a rap-sing style as she tells her listeners to [...] "Go insane, go insane / <b>Throw</b> <b>some</b> glitter / Make it rain on 'em / Let me see them Hanes." [...] Kesha uses layered vocals that are enhanced in some parts {{with the use of}} Auto-Tune. Lyrically, [...] "Blow" [...] portrays a simple message, described as a party-anthem, the song speaks of having a desire {{to have a good time}} at the club. According to Robert Cospey from Digital Spy, the track is of similar character to Benny Benassi's track, [...] "Satisfaction" [...] (2002).|$|E
500|$|Kesha uses a rap vocal {{delivery}} {{which was}} influenced by the Beastie Boys. She claims that the track's creation would not have happened if it was not for their influence on her music. While the song was being crafted she took a different vocal approach to the song than in her earlier records, explaining that: [...] "I’ve done the country, done the pop-rock, done the super-hard electro, ... I was like, whatever, <b>throw</b> <b>some</b> rap in there, why not?" [...] According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Kobalt Music Publishing, the song is set in common time with a moderate beat rate of 120 beats per minute. The song is written in the key of D minor. It has the sequence of B–C–Dm as its chord progression and Kesha's vocals in the song span from the note of D3 to the note of D5. Musically, the song has been compared to Lady Gaga's debut single, [...] "Just Dance", for their similar composition and lyrical context and to Fergie for their similar rap style.|$|E
500|$|Shortz was {{the first}} guest star the {{producers}} of The Simpsons approached. Long later asked Reagle to make puzzles for the episode. Reagle recorded his lines in a studio near his home. Reagle told the Arizona Daily Wildcat that [...] "for me, {{to be such a}} total nut for animation since I was a kid, I never even dreamed [...] It's like a dream I never had coming true." [...] He added that [...] "you don't see [...] in the episode for very long, but when crossword fans watch this show, we want them to think that we got it right." [...] Reagle designed every puzzle that appears in the episode, including one that appears in a hopscotch court in Lisa's daydream. There were certain lines in the script that had to be incorporated into Reagle's puzzles, including one where Gil says [...] "I think I'll <b>throw</b> <b>some</b> Q's around,", and he enters a number of Q's onto the grid. Reagle therefore had to create a puzzle which used words that included the letter Q more frequently than would be usual. Reagle said he saw the early script of the episode, [...] "but they change it right up to the last minute. In a lot of ways, I'll be seeing {{it for the first time}} right along with everyone else." [...] Scott Thompson has a cameo in the episode as Grady, a character that he first voiced in the season 14 episode [...] "Three Gays of the Condo".|$|E
