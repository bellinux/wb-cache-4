5|$|A {{number of}} traditions are upheld and {{recognised}} by choristers. Club members snap <b>their</b> <b>fingers</b> instead of clapping at each other's achievements (i.e. {{a good performance}} on a solo) {{because it is more}} difficult to clap with one's music in the other hand. The club hosts a banquet every spring where awards are presented.|$|E
5|$|Early beefsteaks {{were held}} in a relaxed, men-only atmosphere, with diners sitting on crates and eating with <b>their</b> <b>fingers</b> off of rough, improvised tables in saloons, rental halls, or {{residential}} basements. Food and drink were {{the focus of the}} evening, and entertainment often consisted simply of those present telling stories and singing amongst themselves. Brass bands were sometimes hired.|$|E

5|$|The work {{performed}} by breaker boys was hazardous. Breaker boys {{were forced to}} work without gloves {{so that they could}} better handle the slick coal. The slate, however, was sharp, and breaker boys would often leave work with <b>their</b> <b>fingers</b> cut and bleeding. Breaker boys sometimes also had <b>their</b> <b>fingers</b> amputated by the rapidly moving conveyor belts. Others lost feet, hands, arms, and legs as they moved among the machinery and became caught under conveyor belts or in gears. Many were crushed to death, their bodies retrieved from the gears of the machinery by supervisors only {{at the end of the}} working day. Others were caught in the rush of coal, and crushed to death or smothered. Dry coal would kick up so much dust that breaker boys sometimes wore lamps on their heads to see, and asthma and black lung disease were common. Coal was often washed to remove impurities, which created sulfuric acid. The acid burned the hands of the breaker boys.|$|E
5|$|The {{children}} were {{taught how to}} read by a system devised by the school's founder, Valentin Haüy. Not blind himself, Haüy was a philanthropist who {{devoted his life to}} helping the blind. He designed and manufactured a small library of books for the children using a technique of embossing heavy paper with the raised imprints of Latin letters. Readers would trace <b>their</b> <b>fingers</b> over the text, comprehending slowly but in a traditional fashion which Haüy could appreciate.|$|E
5|$|Their feet {{have four}} long toes and an opposable big toe. Orangutans can grasp things with both {{their hands and}} their feet. <b>Their</b> <b>fingers</b> and toes are curved, {{allowing}} them {{to get a better}} grip on branches. Since their hip joints have the same flexibility as their shoulder and arm joints, orangutans have less restriction in the movements of their legs than humans have. Unlike gorillas and chimpanzees, orangutans are not true knuckle-walkers, and are instead fist-walkers.|$|E

30|$|Hand {{position}} and image set order were counterbalanced in a within-participant design. In the Hand Near condition, participants {{were told to}} use a specific strategy. This strategy involved putting the left index finger on the screen. Starting at the upper left-hand corner of the bag, participants were to sweep <b>their</b> <b>finger</b> {{from left to right}} across the bag making a horizontal line, and would then start again below the previously traced line. Participants were instructed to search the area of the bag where <b>their</b> <b>finger</b> was located and to move their attention as <b>their</b> <b>finger</b> moved. They were told the aim of this strategy was to help make sure that all locations in which a target could be located received attention. If a target was found, participants were told to stop scanning the bag with <b>their</b> <b>finger</b> and make a response. A video of the “Finger Sweep” strategy was displayed for the participant and they were told to emulate the video for each image. If a target was present participants responded by pressing the left arrow key and if a target was absent participants responded by pressing the right arrow key (using their right hand).|$|R

5|$|Bradykinesia (slowness of movement) {{is found}} in every case of PD, and is due to {{disturbances}} in motor planning of movement initiation, and associated with difficulties along the whole course of the movement process, from planning to initiation to execution of a movement. Performance of sequential and simultaneous movement is impaired. Bradykinesia is the most handicapping symptom of Parkinson’s disease leading to difficulties with everyday tasks such as dressing, feeding, and bathing. It leads to particular difficulty in carrying out two independent motor activities {{at the same time}} and can be made worse by emotional stress or concurrent illnesses. Paradoxically patients with Parkinson's disease can often ride a bicycle or climb stairs more easily than walk on a level. While most physicians may readily notice bradykinesia, formal assessment requires a patient to do repetitive movements with <b>their</b> <b>fingers</b> and feet.|$|E
5|$|Devil Daggers is a first-person shooter {{video game}} {{developed}} {{and published by}} indie development team Sorath. Players are tasked with surviving {{for as long as}} possible against swarms of demonic enemies on an arena shrouded in darkness. The player character can fire daggers from <b>their</b> <b>fingers</b> to eliminate foes and move about to avoid contact with them. The player dies upon touching an enemy, and as time passes, more threatening creatures begin to appear. Survival times are recorded on a global leaderboard where replays of playthroughs can be accessed and viewed. The deliberate use of unfiltered textures and effects like polygon jitter and texture warping make its visual style reminiscent of early 3D games released in the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Glue binder {{was often}} used as an {{inexpensive}} alternative to oil. Many works using this medium were produced but few survive today because of the delicateness of the linen cloth and the solubility of the hide glue from which the binder was derived. Well known and relatively well preserved – though substantially damaged – examples include Matsys' Virgin and Child with Saints Barbara and Catherine (c.1415–25) and Bouts' Entombment (c.1440–55). The paint was generally applied with brushes or sometimes with thin sticks or brush handles. The artists often softened the contours of shadows with <b>their</b> <b>fingers,</b> at times to blot or reduce the glaze.|$|E

5|$|The {{hands and}} forearms of Triceratops {{retained}} a fairly primitive structure {{compared to other}} quadrupedal dinosaurs such as thyreophorans and many sauropods. In those two groups, the forelimbs of quadrupedal species were usually rotated so that the hands faced forward with palms backward ("pronated") as the animals walked. Triceratops, like other ceratopsians and the related quadrupedal ornithopods, walked with most of <b>their</b> <b>fingers</b> pointing out {{and away from the}} body, the primitive condition for dinosaurs also retained by bipedal forms like the theropods. In Triceratops, the weight of the body was carried by only the first three fingers of the hand, while digits 4 and 5 were vestigial and lacked claws or hooves. The phalangeal formula is 2-3-4-3-1, meaning that the innermost finger of the forelimb has two bones, the next has three, etc.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} {{opens with a}} mysterious man holding a briefcase, walking down a futuristic hallway. As the music starts, the girls start dancing in a dark office with lights {{flashing}} in the background. As the chorus starts, the girls start shooting laser beams from <b>their</b> <b>fingers,</b> and dance to the song. The girls teleport into the futuristic labyrinth, looking for {{the man with the}} briefcase. Inter cut scenes features the group dancing and singing to the song, whilst in several different hallways. During the second chorus, the girls continue to search for him without any luck. The man enters the office, sits down on a sofa, with a helmet piece of shiny–coloured plastic on his head. The girls find the office entrance, with CCTV footage catching them enter the room.|$|E
5|$|The player kills enemies {{by firing}} daggers from <b>their</b> <b>fingers.</b> There are two firing options: {{clicking}} the left-mouse button fires a shotgun-like blast of daggers {{with a wide}} spread, and holding the mouse button down fires a precise, continuous stream of daggers. Some enemies have weak spots indicated by red crystals on their bodies. Once dead, the red crystals are dropped and can be gathered by the player to obtain attack upgrades, such as increased damage and homing daggers. The player dies when coming into physical contact with an enemy or falling off the stage. At {{the top of the}} screen, a timer displays how long the playthrough has lasted. The player's best survival time is published on a global leaderboard. Accessed via the leaderboard, replays of playthroughs can be downloaded and watched from either a first-person view or a top-down perspective.|$|E

5|$|The four {{difficulty}} {{levels for}} each song afford the player a learning curve {{in order to}} help him/her progress in skill. The first difficulty level, Easy, only focuses on the first three fret buttons while displaying a significantly reduced number of notes for the player to play. Medium introduces the fourth (blue) fret button, and Hard includes the final fret button while adding additional notes. The addition of the orange fret button forces players to move <b>their</b> <b>fingers</b> up and down the neck. Expert does not introduce any other frets to learn, but adds more notes in a manner designed to challenge the player and to simulate the player's hands to move in a sequence similar to a real guitar. A difficulty added in World Tour is Beginner, which only requires the player to strum to the basic rhythm; holding the fret buttons becomes unnecessary. Another new difficulty only for drums was added to Metallica known as Expert+, which uses the double bass pedal.|$|E
5|$|As usual, {{the tone}} of the epigram is {{somewhat}} fawning toward his patron, Titus, but it gives more detail than any other account of the games. It seems to imply that a draw was uncommon in gladiatorial combat at this level, but that Titus eventually yielded to the wishes of the crowd, declared the match equal, and granted both men their freedom (with the traditional presentation of the wooden sword). The traditional way of acknowledging defeat was for the yielding gladiator to raise a finger (ad digitum), and it is possible that in this case both men raised <b>their</b> <b>fingers,</b> but Martial's emphasis here is on Titus' even-handedness and generosity in granting a reprieve (missio) to the crowd's two favourites. His reference to this only happening under Titus probably alludes to the declaration of both as victors, as there is evidence that neither ties nor the survival of both gladiators in a contest were uncommon: it was expensive to train and keep a gladiator and they were not despatched lightly. There is some evidence for the existence of both Priscus and Verus, at least as names of gladiators, outside of Martial's account. A first-century graveyard in Smyrna contains the grave of a gladiator named Priscus, and Verus' name is etched on a marble slab from Ferentinum, recording a gladiatorial contest. The details of Verus' fights are unfortunately not legible. While neither of these may be the Priscus and Verus mentioned by Martial they do attest to the use of these names by gladiators.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes, modern beatboxers {{will use}} their hand or {{another part of}} their body to extend the {{spectrum}} of sound effects and rhythm. Some have developed a technique that involves blowing and sucking air around <b>their</b> <b>fingers</b> to produce a very realistic record scratching noise, which {{is commonly known as}} the 'crab scratch'. Another hand technique includes the 'throat tap' which involves the beatboxer tapping <b>their</b> <b>fingers</b> against their throat as they throat sing or hum.|$|E
