5|$|From 2003 to 2008, the {{operations}} were again split. In 2003, <b>the</b> <b>operations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trams and metro trains {{were transferred to}} Oslotrikken (originally named Oslo Sporvognsdrift) and Oslo T-banedrift, respectively. In 2006, Oslo Sporveier was split into the infrastructure company Kollektivtransportproduksjon and a public transport authority, the latter of which kept the Oslo Sporveier name. From 2007, the ownership of the trams and trains was transferred to Oslo Vognselskap. In 2008, Oslo Sporveier merged with its Akershus counterpart, Stor-Oslo Lokaltrafikk, to create Ruter.|$|E

5|$|Loss of {{biodiversity}} stems {{largely from the}} habitat loss and fragmentation produced by the human appropriation of land for development, forestry and agriculture as natural capital is progressively converted to man-made capital. Land use change is fundamental to <b>the</b> <b>operations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> biosphere because alterations in the relative proportions of land dedicated to urbanisation, agriculture, forest, woodland, grassland and pasture have a marked effect on the global water, carbon and nitrogen biogeochemical cycles and this can impact negatively on both natural and human systems. At the local human scale, major sustainability benefits accrue from sustainable parks and gardens and green cities.|$|E

5|$|The {{dynamics}} of the air war changed in June 1941. The German invasion of the Soviet Union, Operation Barbarossa, opened up the Eastern Front. The German bomber force was heavily committed to the theatre. The escalation of the fighting in the Mediterranean and North African theatres also diverted German air strength. <b>The</b> <b>operations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Luftwaffe over Britain changed dramatically. Small numbers of bombers would make hit-and-run attacks on selected targets near the coast {{for the remainder of}} 1941, replacing the mass raids of the preceding autumn and winter. Cunningham used the decline in the pace of operations to train new crews.|$|E
5|$|The {{major problem}} was the weather. The monsoon caused rough seas that precluded {{the use of the}} small Landing Craft, Vehicle, Personnel (LCVPs) and {{restricted}} <b>the</b> <b>operations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> larger LCMs. Because of the extremely rough seas—the most difficult that the 532nd EBSR had ever encountered—most supply missions were by night when tidal conditions were most favourable. Wootten insisted that at least seven days' supplies be available in forward areas in case the weather prevented the LCMs from running. II Corps made available two trawlers, manned by the 1st Water Transport Group, to deliver rations. The Australian Army also moved supplies by DUKWs.|$|E
5|$|A battle {{fought in}} this zone and tragic for the Israelis was {{completely}} eclipsed from their collective memory. On 18 July, a company from the 1st Battalion of Yiftach Brigade received {{the order to}} capture Qirbet Quriqur, an outpost protecting {{the only way for}} the Legion to get to Latrun located several kilometres {{to the north of the}} place. Intelligence services had not informed the responsible officer that nearby there was another outpost, occupied by a reinforced company of the Legion. From there the legionnaires could observe all <b>the</b> <b>operations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Israelis and called for reinforcements, notably armoured vehicles. When they mounted the counter-attack, the Israelis were taken by a lightning strike in an encircling movement. No troops were available there to reinforce them, so they had to retreat in plain daylight. 45 Israeli soldiers, nineteen of them aged 18 or less, lost their lives.|$|E

5|$|Battleship {{doctrine}} emphasised {{the concentration}} of the battlegroup. In order for this concentrated force {{to be able to}} bring its power to bear on a reluctant opponent (or to avoid an encounter with a stronger enemy fleet), battlefleets needed some means of locating enemy ships beyond horizon range. This was provided by scouting forces; at various stages battlecruisers, cruisers, destroyers, airships, submarines and aircraft were all used. (With the development of radio, direction finding and traffic analysis would come into play, as well, so even shore stations, broadly speaking, joined the battlegroup.) So for most of their history, battleships operated surrounded by squadrons of destroyers and cruisers. The North Sea campaign of the First World War illustrates how, despite this support, the threat of mine and torpedo attack, and the failure to integrate or appreciate the capabilities of new techniques, seriously inhibited <b>the</b> <b>operations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Royal Navy Grand Fleet, the greatest battleship fleet of its time.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{accession}} of Henry I's successor, King Stephen, Nigel {{remained as}} treasurer only briefly before {{his family was}} ousted from political office by the new king. Nigel rebelled and deserted to Stephen's rival Matilda, but eventually reconciled with Stephen. Although he subsequently held some minor administrative posts, he never regained high office under Stephen. On the king's death, Nigel was returned to the treasurership by the new king, Henry II. Nigel's second tenure as treasurer saw him return the administration to the practices of Henry I. He withdrew from much of his public work after around 1164, following an attack of paralysis. He was succeeded as treasurer by his son, Richard fitzNeal, whom he had trained in <b>the</b> <b>operations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Exchequer, or Treasury of England. Most historians, then and now, have felt that Nigel's administrative abilities were excellent; he is considered to have been more talented as an administrator than as a religious figure.|$|E
5|$|Gambier {{and pepper}} farming were mainly {{confined}} to the Bintan (formerly spelled as Bentan) and Galang Islands. Similar to the Kangchu system in Johor, gambier and pepper plantations were established on grants of land by the Yamtuan Muda of Riau, who would issue land permits (Surat Sungai) to the Kangchu who would direct <b>the</b> <b>operations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plantation and workers within the settlement. In the early and middle 19th century, many Chinese settlers and merchants from Riau relocated their businesses to Singapore, and established trading links between Riau and Singapore. These settlers and merchants still maintained trading links with Riau, as the Kangchu from Riau often shipped their produce to Singapore for free trade to evade taxes imposed by the Dutch colonial government. Like Singapore, competition for the gambier and pepper trade between the Teochews and Hokkiens in Riau led to communal tensions and sporadic violence in Riau during the 1840s and 1850s. In the early 20th century, the Chinese abandoned gambier and pepper plantations in favour of other agricultural practices, as the worldwide prices for gambier experienced a drastic drop in value and many pepper plants fell prey to a disease plaguing the archipelago.|$|E

5|$|In 1823, the Synod paid a {{significant}} portion of Queen's College's debts in order to place the institution on a secure financial footing and enable it to reopen. With the second reopening, the Synod provided clergymen to serve at the college as theology professors. Livingston had dedicated several years to raising money for the effort but died shortly before Queen's College reopened in 1825. The Rev. Philip Milledoler, a Reformed clergyman from New York City, was appointed to fill the vacancy created by Livingston's death. Milledoler persuaded one of his parishioners, Colonel Henry Rutgers (1745–1830), to support the college. The trustees subsequently renamed it Rutgers College in his honour. At first, the Synod exercised oversight over <b>the</b> <b>operations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> college, but by 1840 directed its attentions solely to the operation of the seminary. During this period Rutgers College, the college's grammar school (now Rutgers Preparatory School), and the seminary shared one building, known as Old Queens (built 1809-1823) until the two schools separated operations entirely in 1856.|$|E
5|$|In March 1997, NSB {{announced}} that they had plans to privatize <b>the</b> <b>operations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> line from 1998. The responsibility for setting the schedule, selling tickets and marketing was transferred to Flåm Utvikling, a newly established company that NSB owned 49 percent of, and Aurland Ressursutvikling 51 percent. The latter was owned by Aurland Municipality, the Industrial Development Corporation of Norway and Aurland Sparebank, a local bank. Flåm Utvikling also took over responsibility for other tourism-related activities in Flåm, such as port facilities. NSB would still operate the trains, and Flåm Utvikling would pay NSB the cost of running the trains, but keep the profits from the ticket sales. The Norwegian National Rail Administration, which had been established in 1996 and {{had taken over the}} responsibility for infrastructure, retained ownership of the line itself. Flåm Utvikling also started building a cruise ship terminal at Flåm, so tourists could walk ashore and directly to the trains.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the Civil War, when hostilities sharply curtailed business on the Old Bay Line, World War I doubled freight and passenger business {{on the line to}} the busy ports of Norfolk and the Hampton Roads area, with 107,664 passengers using the line in 1917. As a result of congestion on the nation's railroads and ports when the U.S. entered the war in April 1917, the Federal government established the wartime U.S. Railroad Administration (USRA) to take charge of railroads and steamship companies, including the Baltimore Steam Packet Company. The USRA directed <b>the</b> <b>operations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Old Bay Line and the rival Chesapeake line {{for the duration of the}} war and more than a year thereafter, until March 1, 1920.|$|E
