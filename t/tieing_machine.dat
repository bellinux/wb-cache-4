The second goal, which relies largely on the first, is developing the needed algorithms for robust textbased applications, such as machine translation, information extraction, text categorization, question answering and many others. In many areas, achieving high performance in realworld applications drives research motivations and serves as a touchstone for the performance of the field as a whole – what can NLP algorithms actually do? The empirical NLP area, in which I focus my research, aims to make robust language processing feasible based on automated learning of knowledge and inferences from corpora (text collections). This is a great challenge, since language exhibits many unique characteristics, such as ambiguity, large variations and sparse data, that are difficult to represent and analyze in a regular manner, let alone learn them in automated ways.

Can she contribute to the reshaping of those that prove harmful?

40|$|Debate {{over the}} meaning, extension, and proper form of {{national}} citizenship {{is central to}} American history. This dissertation considers a fundamental obligation of citizenship, the payment of taxes. Focusing on the ratification by {{the states of the}} 16 th Amendment which made possible the taxation of incomes, it shows how new ideas about the mutual obligations of citizens changed the relationship between Americans and their government with profound consequences {{for the development of the}} American state in the 20 th century. Ideas of national citizenship contributed to an outcome few at the time expected: 42 of 48 states in a nation steeped in libertarian culture since its founding ratified an amendment awarding the federal government broad, new taxing power. In a detailed analysis of the ratification process in three states - Wisconsin, Virginia and New York - this study demonstrates that ideas about national citizenship structured the politics of ratification. Wisconsin's position in the forefront of Progressive reform and its adoption of a state income tax during the period under study demonstrate the strong affinities between a "new citizenship" and the income tax, factors which led to easy ratification. Virginia's rejection of the amendment was exceptional in a region that largely supported the income tax. In Virginia, a plutocratic political <b>machine,</b> <b>tied</b> to Northeastern industrial interests and strengthened by the recent disenfranchisement of the state's poorer residents, weakened reform efforts and enabled local political elites to ignore the state's strong economic interest in a potential federal income tax. New York's first order economic interests suggested that it would be strongly disposed against the amendment. New Yorkers, then 10 percent of the nation's population, would pay more than 30 percent of an income tax. But unlikely bedfellows among New York's political leadership put forward a patriotic vision of national citizenship. This vision attracted segments of the economic elite, middle-class reformers, and working-class voters to support ratification. The surprising ratification of the 16 th Amendment had profound consequences for American federalism. It meant that a minority of wealthy states now owed more to the federal government than their numbers dictated. It enabled a redistribution of income from wealthy states to poorer states that continues to the present day. Ratification also provides a powerful argument against material reductionism in explaining the nature of tax policy and politics in America. It suggests that moral and social considerations - aspects of a nation's political culture, expressed in the American context through evolving ideas of national citizenship - can be critically important in explaining significant changes and movements for tax reform...|$|R
60|$|By {{the side}} of the moat {{at the far end of}} the {{enclosed}} ground there grew a big red willow, the tree already mentioned in a former chapter as the second largest in the plantation. It had a thick round trunk, wide-spreading horizontal branches, and rough bark. In its shape, when the thin foliage was gone, it was more like an old oak than a red willow. This was my favourite tree when I had once mastered the difficult and dangerous art of climbing. It was farthest from the house of all the trees, on a waste weedy spot which no one else visited, and this made it an ideal place for me, and whenever I was in the wild arboreal mood I would climb the willow to find a good stout branch high up on which to spend an hour, with a good view of the wide green plain before me and the sight of grazing flocks and herds, and of houses and poplar groves looking blue in the distance. Here, too, in this tree, I first felt the desire for wings, to dream of the delight it would be to circle upwards to a great height and float on the air without effort, like the gull and buzzard and harrier and other great soaring land and water birds. But from the time this notion and desire began to affect me I envied most the great crested screamer, an inhabitant then of all the marshes in our vicinity. For here was a bird as big or bigger than a goose, as heavy almost as I was myself, who, when he wished to fly, rose off the ground with tremendous labour, and then as he got higher and higher flew more and more easily, until he rose so high that he looked no bigger than a lark or pipit, and at that height he would continue floating round and round in vast circles for hours, pouring out those jubilant cries at intervals which sounded to us so far below like clarion notes in the sky. If I could only get off the ground like that heavy bird and rise as high, then the blue air would make me as buoyant and let me float all day without pain or effort like the bird! This desire has continued with me through my life, yet I have never wished to fly in a balloon or airship, since I should then be <b>tied</b> to a <b>machine</b> and have no will or soul of my own.

40|$|Abstract Background: Surgical site {{infection}} (SSI) in {{the groin}} after vascular surgery is common and deep perivascular infection leads to long periods of hospitalization, sometimes to amputation and/or death. Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is increasingly used for treating wounds such as deep perivascular groin infections after vascular surgery, {{but there is no}} scientific evidence supporting its benefit over traditional wound therapy. Aims: To study the effect of NPWT on wound healing, complications, resource use, quality of life, cost-effectiveness, and to explore the experiences of patients with deep perivascular groin infections after vascular surgery undergoing NPWT at home Methods: A retrospective study was performed on consecutive patients undergoing NPWT between 2004 and 2006, and a randomized controlled trial was conducted between 2007 and 2011, where patients undergoing NPWT were compared to those treated with a traditional alginate dressing. Finally, a qualitative interview study was conducted between 2013 and 2014, in which patients undergoing NPWT in the outpatient setting were interviewed 7 - 14 days after discharge. Results: Twenty-eight patients/ 33 groins were studied in Study I, ten patients in each group in Studies II & III and 15 patients in Study IV. The median wound healing time was 55 days in Study I, 57 days in the NPWT group compared to 104 in the alginate group (p= 0. 026) in Studies II & III and 58 days in Study IV. The graft preservation rate in NPWT patients was 83 %, 86 % and 85 % in Studies I, II/III and IV, respectively. Bacterial clearance from the wound was the same in the NPWT and alginate group in Studies II &III. One patient in the NPWT and one in the alginate group in Studies II &III had a severe bleeding from the femoral artery reconstruction site. Nine (43 %) out of 21 groins with synthetic graft infections in Study I had an infection-related complication, compared to 0 (0 %) out of 12 groins in those that did not have a synthetic graft infection (p= 0. 012), and non-healing wounds were associated with amputation (p= 0. 005) and death (p< 0. 001). A median of 21 (IQR 15 - 30) dressing changes were performed in the NPWT group, compared to 73 (IQR 51 - 98) (p< 0. 001) in the alginate group in Studies II & III. Compared to alginate therapy, NPWT saved the nurses 4. 5 hours of work the first week after surgical revision in Study III. The total costs for the NPWT and alginate group in Study III were the same, of which 87 % and 83 %, respectively, were attributed to in-hospital costs. In Study III, estimation of Euroqol 5 Dimensions instrument and Brief Pain Inventory showed no differences at respective time points between the two groups. In Study IV an overall theme emerged from the descriptions of the experiences of patients with deep perivascular groin infection after vascular surgery undergoing NPWT at home, namely that it meant a transition from being a dependent patient to a person who needs to be involved and have self-care competence. A need to feel prepared for this before discharge from hospital was expressed. Lack of information and feelings of uncertainty prolonged the time before feeling confident in managing the treatment. The informants gradually accepted the need to be <b>tied</b> to a <b>machine,</b> became competent in its management, and found solutions to perform everyday tasks. Overall, {{it was a relief to}} be treated at home. Conclusion: NPWT in patients with deep perivascular SSI after vascular surgery is superior to traditional alginate therapy in terms of wound healing and cost-effectiveness. Patients expressed several benefits of treatment with NPWT at home. However, they experienced unnecessary stress and anxiety due to lack of information on the treatment and instruction concerning the equipment. Therefore, adequate information and education must be provided...|$|R
40|$|As a {{net shape}} process, die casting is {{intrinsically}} efficient {{and improvements in}} energy efficiency are strongly dependent on design and process improvements that reduce scrap rates so that more of the total consumed energy goes into acceptable, usable castings. A casting that is distorted and fails to meet specified dimensional requirements is typically remelted but this still results in a decrease in process yield, lost productivity, and increased energy consumption. This work focuses on developing, and expanding the use of, computer modeling methods {{that can be used}} to improve the dimensional accuracy of die castings and produce die designs and machine/die setups that reduce rejection rates due to dimensional issues. A major factor contributing to the dimensional inaccuracy of the casting is the elastic deformations of the die cavity caused by the thermo mechanical loads the dies are subjected to during normal operation. Although thermal and die cavity filling simulation are widely used in the industry, structural modeling of the die, particularly for managing part distortion, is not yet widely practiced. This may be due in part to the need to have a thorough understanding of the physical phenomenon involved in die distortion and the mathematical theory employed in the numerical models to efficiently model the die distortion phenomenon. Therefore, two of the goals of this work are to assist in efforts to expand the use of structural modeling and related technologies in the die casting industry by 1) providing a detailed modeling guideline and tutorial for those interested in developing the necessary skills and capability and 2) by developing simple metaÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂmodels that capture the results and experience gained from several years of die distortion research and can be used to predict key distortion phenomena of relevance to a die caster with a minimum of background and without the need for simulations. These objectives were met. A detailed modeling tutorial was provided to NADCA for distribution to the industry. Power law based metaÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂmodels for predicting <b>machine</b> <b>tie</b> bar loading and for predicting maximum parting surface separation were successfully developed and tested against simulation results for a wide range of machines and experimental data. The models proved to be remarkably accurate, certainly well within the requirements for practical application. In addition to making die structural modeling more accessible, the work advanced the state-of-the-art by developing improved modeling of cavity pressure effects, which is typically modeled as a hydrostatic boundary condition, and performing a systematic analysis of the influence of ejector die design variables on die deflection and parting plane separation. This cavity pressure modeling objective met with less than complete success due to the limits of current finite element based fluidÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂstructureÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂinteraction analysis methods, but an improved representation of the casting/die interface was accomplished using a combination of solid and shell elements in the finite element model. This approximation enabled good prediction of final part distortion verified with a comprehensive evaluation of the dimensions of test castings produced with a design experiment. An extra deliverable of the experimental work was development of high temperature mechanical properties for the A 380 die casting alloy. The ejector side design objective was met and the results were incorporated into the metamodels described above. This new technology was predicted to result in an average energy savings of 2. 03 trillion BTUÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs/year over a 10 year period. Current (2011) annual energy saving estimates over a ten year period, based on commercial introduction in 2009, a market penetration of 70 % by 2014 is 4. 26 trillion BTUÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs/year by 2019. Along with these energy savings, reduction of scrap and improvement in casting yield will result in a reduction of the environmental emissions associated with the melting and pouring of the metal which will be saved as a result of this technology. The average annual estimate of CO 2 reduction per year through 2020 is 0. 085 Million Metric Tons of Carbon Equivalent (MM TCE) ...|$|R
