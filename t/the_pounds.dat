5|$|Mineral {{resources}} {{near the}} top end of the canal included ironstone, which was normally extracted by scouring. This caused problems for the canal, as silt was deposited in the feeders and the top pounds. The Fox family, who were based at Neath Abbey, but who were scouring ironstone further up the valley, agreed to construct a new feeder in 1807 to mitigate the problem. Protests made to the Tappendens, who were scouring at Pen-rhiw and Cwm Gwrelych, were less successful. As <b>the</b> <b>pounds</b> were silting up, the company took legal action in 1811. The court found in their favour, recognising that the canal would soon be useless unless something was done.|$|E
25|$|A drop lock can {{consist of}} two {{conventional}} lock chambers {{leading to a}} sump pound, or a single long chamber incorporating the sump - although the term properly applies only to the second case. As <b>the</b> <b>pounds</b> {{at either end of}} the structure are at the same height, the lock can only be emptied either by allowing water to run to waste from the sump to a lower stream or drain, or (less wastefully) by pumping water back up to the canal. Particularly in the two-chamber type, there would be a need for a bypass culvert, to allow water to move along the interrupted pound and so supply locks further down the canal. In the case of the single-chamber type, this can be achieved by keeping the lock full and leaving the gates open while not in use.|$|E
25|$|The venture {{was not a}} {{commercial}} success, and it was sold to various millers, who owned watermills along its length. The section above Swafield locks was abandoned in 1893, and from 1922 it was owned by the North Walsham Canal Company, set up by Edward Cubitt and George Walker, who were mill owners. The last commercial use of the canal was in 1934, and it avoided nationalisation in 1948. With the dawning of the leisure age, the canal {{was seen as an}} easy one to restore, but work to do so did not start until 2000, when the East Anglian Waterways Association (EAWA) started to run working parties for volunteers. In 2008 the North Walsham and Dilham Canal Trust was formed, and jointly run working parties with the EAWA. In 2009, part of the canal was sold to the Old Canal Company, who have worked to restore two locks and <b>the</b> <b>pounds</b> in between, in order to run Bacton Wood Mill as a watermill. Rewatering was interrupted by the Environment Agency issuing a stop notice in April 2012, but negotiations continue.|$|E

25|$|To {{participate}} in the ERM, Ireland had to break <b>the</b> Irish <b>pound's</b> parity with <b>the</b> <b>pound</b> sterling in 1979, because <b>the</b> <b>pound</b> sterling, which was not an ERM currency, appreciated against all ERM currencies shortly after {{the launch of the}} ERM. The continued parity between <b>the</b> Irish <b>pound</b> and <b>the</b> <b>pound</b> sterling would have taken <b>the</b> Irish <b>pound</b> outside its agreed band.

50|$|During {{the time}} of Henry III, <b>the</b> <b>pound</b> {{sterling}} equalled <b>the</b> <b>pound</b> weight Tower. In the 28th year of Edward I (around 1300), <b>the</b> Tale <b>Pound,</b> or Pound Sterling, first began to differ from or come short of <b>the</b> <b>Pound</b> weight Tower, from which it originated and to which it had been equal until then, for by indenture of that year <b>the</b> <b>pound</b> weight was to contain 20s. 3d. in Tale. In the 27th year of Edward III (around 1354), <b>the</b> <b>pound</b> sterling was now only 80% of <b>the</b> <b>pound</b> weight, or 9 oz 12 dwt (or 9.6 oz) Tower. By an Act of 13 Henry IV (around 1412), <b>the</b> <b>pound</b> weight of standard silver was to contain thirty shillings in Tale, or {{one and a half}} <b>pounds</b> sterling; thus <b>the</b> <b>pound</b> sterling reduced to two-thirds of a pound weight, or 8 oz Tower. <b>The</b> <b>pound</b> sterling was adjusted in weight several more times thereafter.|$|R
500|$|Ine {{made peace}} with Kent in 694, when its king Wihtred gave Ine a {{substantial}} sum in compensation {{for the death of}} Cædwalla's brother Mul, who had been killed during a Kentish rebellion in 687. The value of the amount offered to Ine by Wihtred is uncertain; most manuscripts of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle record [...] "thirty thousand", and some specify thirty thousand pounds.

500|$|<b>The</b> <b>Pounds</b> {{were unhappy}} in Paris; Dorothy {{complained about the}} winters and Ezra's health was poor. A dinner a guest {{randomly}} tried to stab him; to Pound [...] this underlined that their time in France was over. Hemingway saw how Pound [...] "indulged in a small nervous breakdown", leading to two days in an American hospital. They {{decided to move to}} a quieter place, chosing Rapallo, Italy, a town 15,000. [...] "Italy is my place for starting things", he told a friend. During this period they lived on Dorothy's income, supplemented by dividends from stock she had invested in.|$|E
500|$|It {{was also}} in 694 that Wihtred made peace with the West Saxon king Ine. [...] Ine's predecessor, Cædwalla, had invaded Kent and {{installed}} his brother Mul as king, but the Kentishmen had subsequently revolted and burned Mul. [...] Wihtred agreed compensation for the killing, but the amount paid to Ine is uncertain. [...] Most manuscripts of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle record [...] "thirty thousand", and some specify thirty thousand pounds. If <b>the</b> <b>pounds</b> are equal to sceattas, then this amount is the equal of a king's wergild—that is, the legal valuation of a man's life, according to his rank.

500|$|<b>The</b> <b>Pounds</b> {{settled in}} Paris in January 1921, and {{several months later}} moved into an {{inexpensive}} apartment at 70 bis [...] Pound became friendly with Marcel Duchamp, Tristan Tzara, Fernand Léger and others of the Dada and Surrealist movements, as well as Basil Bunting, Ernest Hemingway and his wife, Hadley Richardson. He {{spent most of his}} time building furniture for his apartment and bookshelves for the bookstore Shakespeare and Company, and in 1921 the volume Poems 1918–1921 was published. In 1922 Eliot sent him the manuscript of The Waste Land, then arrived in Paris to edit it with Pound, who blue-inked the manuscript with comments like [...] "make up yr. mind..." [...] and [...] "georgian". Eliot wrote: [...] "I should like to think that the manuscript, with the suppressed passages, had disappeared irrecoverably; yet, on the other hand, I should wish the blue pencilling on it to be preserved as irrefutable evidence of Pound's critical genius." ...|$|E
500|$|The saddle {{with a solid}} tree {{provided}} a bearing surface to protect the horse from {{the weight of the}} rider. The Romans are credited with the invention of the solid-treed saddle, possibly as early as the 1st century BC, and it was widespread by the 2nd century AD. [...] Early medieval saddles resembled the Roman [...] "four-horn" [...] saddle, and were used without stirrups. The development of the solid saddle tree was significant; it raised the rider above the horse's back, and distributed the rider's weight, reducing <b>the</b> <b>pounds</b> per square inch carried on any one part of the horse's back, thus [...] greatly increasing the comfort of the horse and prolonging its useful life. Horses could carry more weight when distributed across a solid saddle tree. [...] It also allowed a more built up seat to give the rider greater security in the saddle. [...] From the 12th century on, the high war-saddle became more common, providing protection as well as added security. The built up cantle of a solid-treed saddle enabled horsemen to use lance more effectively.|$|E
2500|$|The {{names of}} most derived units of measure in the {{imperial}} and US customary systems are concatenations of the constituent parts of the unit of measure, for example the unit of pressure is <b>the</b> <b>pounds</b> [...] per square inch.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>pound</b> was <b>the</b> {{currency}} of Malawi until 1971.

This {{was replaced by}} <b>the</b> Malawian <b>pound</b> in 1964, following Malawi's independence. <b>The</b> <b>pound</b> was subdivided into 20 shillings, each of 12 pence. <b>The</b> <b>pound</b> {{was replaced by the}} kwacha in 1971, at a rate of 2 kwacha = 1 pound.|$|R
50|$|A lock pound {{lies between}} two locks which {{are only a}} short {{distance}} apart. Water levels in <b>the</b> <b>pound</b> are liable to fluctuate as the locks are used. Boats entering <b>the</b> <b>pound</b> from <b>the</b> lower level remove a lockful of water from <b>the</b> <b>pound,</b> while those using the upper lock add a lockful of water. Because the maximum level in <b>the</b> <b>pound</b> is normally controlled by a bywash weir at the lower lock, some of {{the water from the}} upper lock may be lost over it, and if the lower lock has a deeper fall, there is a net loss of level when a boat passes through <b>the</b> <b>pound.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Tree: {{the base}} {{on which the}} rest of the saddle is built. Usually based on wood or a similar {{synthetic}} material, it is eventually covered in leather or a leatherlike synthetic. The tree's size determines its fit on the horse's back, as well as the size of the seat for the rider. It provides a bearing surface to protect the horse from the weight of the rider. The solid saddle tree raises the rider above the horse's back, and distributes the rider's weight, reducing <b>the</b> <b>pounds</b> per square inch carried on any one part of the horse's back, thus [...] greatly increasing the comfort of the horse and prolonging its useful life.|$|E
2500|$|When Olivia died in 1938 {{she left}} a {{substantial}} income to Dorothy. [...] In 1931 Olivia doubled Dorothy's income, who by that time had additional income {{in the form of}} various family bequests and dividends from investments. With her husband earning as little as ₤50 annually, <b>the</b> <b>Pounds</b> lived on Dorothy's income. Olivia set up a stock account for her which was soon depleted because she followed Pound's advice to invest in Italian stock. She inherited ₤16,000 from her mother, but during the war the money was inaccessible with assets from England prohibited from being sent to an Axis country. [...] As a result, during the war years the couple relied solely on Pound's income, {{for the first time since}} their marriage.|$|E
2500|$|The {{war years}} were {{difficult}} for the couple. After the United States entered the war, Pound and his wife Dorothy became enemy aliens in Italy, an ironic situation in light of Pound's support of Mussolini. Their home in Rapallo was sequestered in 1943 and the couple {{had little choice but}} to move in with Rudge. Thus the ménage à trois for so long a matter of public speculation became a reality. Rudge sent her daughter back to Gais to live with her original peasant guardians, and was forced by necessity to support <b>the</b> <b>Pounds</b> and her daughter by giving language lessons. It was a very difficult time for the trio: while both women adored Pound, they hated each other. Pound's wife later wrote that [...] "hatred and tension permeated the house".|$|E
25|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of the New Zealand dollar in 1967, <b>the</b> New Zealand <b>pound</b> was <b>the</b> currency of New Zealand, which had been distinct from <b>the</b> <b>pound</b> sterling since 1933. <b>The</b> <b>pound</b> used <b>the</b> £sd system, in which <b>the</b> <b>pound</b> was divided into 20 shillings and one shilling was divided into 12 pence, which by the 1950s was considered complicated and cumbersome.|$|R

2500|$|On English canals, these {{reservoirs}} {{are called}} [...] "side ponds". The Droitwich Canal, reopened in 2011, has {{a flight of}} three locks at Hanbury which all have operational side ponds. Side ponds were also installed on the Grand Union Canal and the Coventry Canal, among others. They are now out of use, {{and in some cases}} have been filled in, because British Waterways considered that it was too easy to misuse them and flood the surrounding area. [...] On some flights of locks with short intermediate pounds, <b>the</b> <b>pounds</b> are extended sideways – in effect to provide a reservoir to ensure that the pound does not run dry (in case, for instance, the lock below leaks more than the lock above). These extended intermediate pounds are sometimes confused with side ponds.|$|E
2500|$|Although Dorothy and Ezra {{planned to}} honeymoon in Spain that September, the {{outbreak}} of World War I forced them to postpone. Instead they lived with W.B. Yeats at Stone Cottage for the winter, where Pound worked on proofs for the second issue of BLAST magazine. Of Dorothy, Yeats wrote, [...] "she looks as if her face were made out of Dresden china. I look at her in perpetual wonder. It {{is hard to believe}} she is real; yet she spends all her daylight hours drawing the most monstrous cubist pictures." [...] Poet Iris Barry, writing in the 1930s about <b>the</b> <b>Pounds</b> during this period, describes Dorothy as, [...] "With [...] came Mrs. Pound, carrying herself delicately with the air, always of a young Victorian lady out skating, and a profile as clear and lovely as that as a porcelain Kuan-yin".|$|E
2500|$|The chamber is {{the main}} feature of a lock.
