Descending is more difficult, and barges often needed to start their descent with one tide, lay up before crossing Longney Sands, and finish the descent at the next tide. These inconveniences in accessing Gloucester were overcome when the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal was opened in 1827, bypassing the need for shipping to use the river to reach Gloucester.|$|E
