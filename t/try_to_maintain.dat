However, the expedition the Athenians sent to Euboea to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> their position on the island was a disaster, and the Athenians had to seek peace with Chalcis, thereby effectively losing control of the island. It is possible that Philip actually incited the revolt on Euboea, though it considered more likely that this is a misreading of a speech of the Athenian politician Aeschines.|$|E

25|$|The {{respiratory}} centers <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> an arterial CO2 pressure of 40mm Hg. With intentional hyperventilation, the CO2 content of arterial blood may be lowered to 10–20mm Hg (the oxygen {{content of the}} blood is little affected), and the respiratory drive is diminished. This is why one can hold one's breath longer after hyperventilating than without hyperventilating. This carries the risk that unconsciousness may result before the need to breathe becomes overwhelming, which is why hyperventilation is particularly dangerous before free diving.|$|E

25|$|This basic {{educational}} necessity did {{not disappear}} {{with the advent}} of Protestantism; to the contrary, in Britain the Cathedrals and their schools were inherited by the Church of England, which continued to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> New Latin as the language of the church. In this system the headmasters were denoted by a variety of Latin terms: the custodes, the magistri scholarum, and the scholarum praefecti. The Renaissance and subsequent neoclassicist periods saw a revival of interest in ancient Greek culture, which resulted in a new overlay of Hellenic terms on the Medieval Latin surviving from the empire, recognizable today as the mixed Greek and Latin words of scientific terminology. In the linguistic environment of the cathedral schools, a new term appears: the scholarchus, the headmaster.|$|E
25|$|As an {{organization}} of central banks, the BIS seeks to make monetary policy more predictable and transparent among its 60-member central banks, except {{in the case of}} Eurozone countries which forfeited the right to conduct monetary policy in order to implement the euro. While monetary policy is determined by most sovereign nations, it is subject to central and private banking scrutiny and potentially to speculation that affects foreign exchange rates and especially the fate of export economies. Failures to keep monetary policy in line with reality and make monetary reforms in time, preferably as a simultaneous policy among all 60 member banks and also involving the International Monetary Fund, have historically led to losses in the billions as banks <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> a policy using open market methods that have proven to be based on unrealistic assumptions.|$|E
25|$|The Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), {{the federal}} agency {{responsible}} for funding health research, recommended in 2010 against funding a pan-Canadian trial of liberation therapy {{because there was a}} lack of evidence on the safety or efficacy of the procedure. It suggested a scientific expert working group made up of the principal investigators for the seven MS Society-sponsored studies. The health minister accepted the CIHR recommendation and said that Canada was not going to fund clinical trials. The expert panel was created by the end of 2010 together between the CIHR and the MS Society of Canada. It has been proposed that the creation of this expert panel was partly directed to cope with the high levels of social pressure the CCSVI theory had raised and at the same time <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> a scientific perspective in the funding and investigation of CCSVI. The main task of the panel was to monitor the results of the ongoing studies in the relationship between CCSVI and MS and recommend the funding of a clinical trial in case that there was evidence of a true relationship between the two. In 2011, the Canadian federal government announced that they would fund clinical trials of the procedure to widen the veins since CIHR considered that evidence of venous abnormalities in MS was enough for small treatment trials. It has been proposed that the recommendation to fund phase I and II trials instead of a big study was a compromise between the high levels of social and political pressure and the low level of evidence on the theory.|$|E

500|$|The {{following}} year Palmer switched the magazine's focus to flying saucers. [...] To <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> the existing readership while attracting new readers, Palmer emphasized sf and flying saucers in alternate issues: for example, the June 1957 issue was titled FLYING SAUCERS from Other Worlds, and the July issue was Flying Saucers from OTHER WORLDS. [...] He also hoped that each issue {{would be kept}} longer on newsstands if the distributors thought {{they were dealing with}} two magazines. [...] The experiment did not last; from the July/August 1958 issue the title was shortened to Flying Saucers, and the magazine ceased to carry fiction. [...] Palmer retired to Amherst, Wisconsin, and took over its printing. [...] Bibliographic sources focus on the science fiction issues, and do not index the magazine after 1958, but it continued publication until 1976 as a non-fiction magazine.|$|E
