5|$|Originally {{located in}} {{downtown}} Eugene, the paper moved {{to its current}} location in northeast Eugene in January 1998. The former Register-Guard building was leased by the University of Oregon and renamed <b>the</b> <b>Baker</b> Downtown Center for <b>the</b> <b>Baker</b> family. The building houses the university's printing facility, archives, and continuing education program, {{as well as the}} Oregon Career Information System.|$|E
50|$|For the {{signature}} bake, <b>the</b> <b>bakers</b> were given {{two hours to}} bake an American pie. On the technical bake, <b>the</b> <b>bakers</b> were required to bake a free-standing savory pie using Paul Hollywood's own recipe. The pie would be a hot water crust pastry and <b>the</b> <b>bakers</b> were given two hours. For <b>the</b> showstopper, <b>the</b> <b>bakers</b> needed to make 36 sweet tartlets within three hours.|$|R
50|$|In {{the final}} {{signature}} challenge, <b>the</b> <b>bakers</b> {{had to make}} 16 iced buns, of which there must be two kinds, in three hours. In the technical, the judges decided {{to use one of}} Paul's recipes; <b>the</b> <b>bakers</b> had to bake raspberry-flavoured mille-feuille in two hours. The recipe involved pastry - something all of <b>the</b> <b>bakers</b> had struggled with. In the final Showstopper, <b>the</b> <b>bakers</b> were given four hours to make classic British cakes in a multi-layered presentation.|$|R
5000|$|Before {{the series}} had begun, some viewers complained of the [...] "gendered" [...] icing in preview {{pictures}} of <b>the</b> <b>bakers.</b> In <b>the</b> promo shots of <b>the</b> <b>bakers,</b> <b>the</b> male <b>bakers</b> were given blue icing while <b>the</b> female <b>bakers</b> were given pink icing, whereas the previous year, every <b>baker</b> was given <b>the</b> same colour regardless. As a result, the BBC altered the colouring of the icing.|$|R
5|$|For the 1903 {{parliamentary}} session, the UERL announced {{bills for}} the BS and its other tube railways, seeking permission to merge the three companies by transferring the BS's and CCE's powers to the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (GNP). The BS bill also included requests {{for a further}} extension of time and for powers to compulsorily purchase land for an electrical sub-station at Lambeth. The merger was rejected by Parliament, but the land purchase and extension of time were permitted separately in <b>the</b> <b>Baker</b> Street and Waterloo Railway Act, 1903 and <b>the</b> <b>Baker</b> Street and Waterloo Railway (Extension of Time) Act, 1903, both given royal assent on 11 August 1903.|$|E
5|$|The {{changes were}} {{permitted}} by <b>the</b> <b>Baker</b> Street and Waterloo Railway Act, 1906 on 4 August 1906, but the south-east alignment {{did not represent}} a suitable direction to continue the railway and no {{effort was made to}} construct the extension.|$|E
5|$|The {{newspaper}} {{is owned by}} <b>the</b> <b>Baker</b> family of Eugene, {{and members of the}} family were in charge of nearly all departments within the paper until 2015, when, {{for the first time in}} 88 years, someone who is not a member of <b>the</b> <b>Baker</b> family took the reins as publisher and editor. It is Oregon's second-largest daily newspaper and one of the few medium-sized family newspapers left in the United States.|$|E
50|$|During the 1955-56 season, <b>the</b> Buchan <b>Bakers</b> {{traveled}} to Asia, playing teams from Japan, China and the Philippines. After <b>the</b> season, <b>the</b> <b>Bakers</b> {{traveled to}} Europe {{and were the}} first AAU basketball team to play behind the Iron Curtain. The team played in Poland and Czechoslovakia, in addition to France, Spain, and Italy. But the teams hopes of traveling to Australia {{to play in the}} Olympic Games were swatted away by Bill Russell. As winners of the National AAU Tournament, <b>the</b> <b>Bakers</b> were invited to a four-team round robin tournament to determine the U.S. Olympic Team. <b>The</b> <b>Bakers</b> lost to <b>the</b> Russell-led College All-Stars and dropped a rematch with Phillips 66ers. Although <b>the</b> <b>Bakers</b> beat <b>the</b> Armed Forces All-Stars, <b>the</b> <b>Bakers</b> were shut out of the Olympic selections.|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} challenge, <b>the</b> <b>bakers</b> were {{required}} to make a sweet tea loaf using yeast, either in a tin or free form. They were given 3 hours for the task. For the technical challenge, <b>the</b> <b>bakers</b> baked an apricot couronne using Paul's recipe in two and three-quarter hours. For <b>the</b> showstopper, <b>the</b> <b>bakers</b> needed to make two different varieties of European sweet buns, 12 of each. <b>The</b> <b>bakers</b> were given 30 minutes to start in the first day so that dough may be proofed overnight, to be finished the second day in four hours.|$|R

5|$|In 1906, Gibb was {{appointed}} {{managing director of}} the UERL. At Gibb's invitation, Pick also moved to the UERL to continue working as his assistant. The UERL controlled the District Railway and, during 1906 and 1907, opened three deep-level tube lines – <b>the</b> <b>Baker</b> Street and Waterloo Railway (Bakerloo tube), the Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway (Hampstead tube) and the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (Piccadilly tube).|$|E

According to the real Joughin's testimony, he rode the ship down and stepped into the water without getting his hair wet. He also admitted to hardly feeling the cold, most likely thanks to alcohol.|$|E
50|$|Unable to financially {{care for}} Anna Mae, the Hes {{decided to let}} her remain in the Bakers' custody. <b>The</b> <b>Bakers</b> {{expressed}} interest in adopting Anna Mae but the Hes were unwilling. An agreement was reached that would give <b>the</b> <b>Bakers</b> temporary custody and let the Hes retain parental rights. <b>The</b> <b>Bakers</b> claim {{there was also an}} oral agreement that <b>the</b> <b>Bakers</b> would raise Anna Mae until she is eighteen years old. But the Hes contend that they did not agree to this and that the arrangement was only temporary. A juvenile court officer's testimony supports the Hes' claim.|$|R
50|$|In {{their first}} task, <b>the</b> <b>bakers</b> were set <b>the</b> {{challenge}} of making twelve savoury pastry parcels, {{to be completed}} in an hour and three quarters. The parcels can be of any type of pastries, but should be uniform in size, well-filled, perfectly cooked and well-sealed to prevent leaks. The technical bake was one {{that for the first time}} none of <b>the</b> <b>bakers</b> had heard of, the Breton pastry kouign-amann, using one of Paul's recipes. <b>The</b> <b>bakers</b> should make twelve identical kouign-amanns in three and a half hours. For the final challenge, <b>the</b> <b>bakers</b> were required to make 24 Éclairs of two different flavours (12 of each) in four hours. The éclairs should be made of choux pastry and éclair-shaped, otherwise <b>the</b> <b>bakers</b> were free to do as they wished to produce a showstopper.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the first}} task, <b>the</b> <b>bakers</b> were given {{one and a}} half hour to make two quick bread to be made free-form (i.e. not in a tin). For the second task, Paul set <b>the</b> <b>bakers</b> <b>the</b> {{challenge}} of baking four identical crusty baguettes in two and a half hours. For the final showstopper, <b>the</b> <b>bakers</b> needed to make a 3D bread sculpture in five hours, using three types of dough, and one of them should be filled.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Baker</b> Street and Waterloo Railway (now {{part of the}} Bakerloo line) {{opened on}} 10 March 1906, and was {{initially}} accessed from Waterloo by lifts at the York Road end of the station. The Northern line's station at Waterloo opened on 13 September 1926, {{as part of the}} overall extension from Charing Cross to Kennington. The Jubilee line station opened on 24 September 1999 as part of the eastward extension to Stratford.|$|E
5|$|The Paddington {{extension}} {{was aligned}} {{to allow a}} westward extension to continue to Royal Oak or Willesden, areas already served by the MR, which again opposed the plans. This time, the BS was successful and royal assent for the extensions was granted in <b>the</b> <b>Baker</b> Street and Waterloo Railway Act, 1900 on 6 August 1900.|$|E
5|$|The first {{underground}} railway {{to serve}} Charing Cross was the District Railway (now the District line), which opened on 30 May 1870. <b>The</b> <b>Baker</b> Street and Waterloo Railway (now the Bakerloo line) constructed a line underneath {{the west side}} of the station in the late 19th century, which opened on 10 March 1906.|$|E

50|$|For the {{signature}} bake, <b>the</b> <b>bakers</b> must make 8 individual custards, either sweet like a crème brûlée, or using a more savory recipe. They had 90 minutes {{to finish the}} task. In the technical bake, the challenge was to bake a chocolate soufflé, however. As the soufflé can fall within minutes of {{coming out of the}} oven, the start time for <b>the</b> <b>bakers</b> was staggered so that each bake can be judged immediately after it was baked. <b>The</b> <b>bakers</b> were each given an hour and 45 minutes. For the final challenge, <b>the</b> <b>bakers</b> were required to produce a layered dessert featuring meringue in five hours.|$|R

5|$|Elephant & Castle is a London Underground {{station in}} the London Borough of Southwark in south London. It is on the Bank branch of the Northern line between Kennington and Borough stations, and is the {{southern}} terminus of the Bakerloo line, the next station being Lambeth North. The station is in both Travelcard Zones 1 and 2. The Northern line station was opened in 1890 by the City and South London Railway (C) while the Bakerloo line station was opened sixteen years later by <b>the</b> <b>Baker</b> Street and Waterloo Railway (BS). There is out-of-station interchange with the nearby Elephant & Castle National Rail station.|$|E
5|$|In November 1891, {{a private}} bill was {{presented}} to Parliament {{for the construction of}} <b>the</b> <b>Baker</b> Street and Waterloo Railway (BS). The railway was planned to run entirely underground from Marylebone to Elephant & Castle via Baker Street and Waterloo and was approved in 1900. Construction commenced in August 1898 under the direction of Sir Benjamin Baker, W.R. Galbraith and R.F. Church with building work by Perry & Company of Tredegar Works, Bow. Test trains began running in 1905. The first section of the BS was between Baker Street and Lambeth North. The BS station opened on 5 August 1906, almost five months after the rest of the line.|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} to improve their {{collective}} situations, most of the underground railways in London: the C, the CLR, the Great Northern & City Railway and the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL, which operated <b>the</b> <b>Baker</b> Street & Waterloo Railway (BS), the Great Northern, Piccadilly & Brompton Railway (GNP), the CCE and the DR) began, from 1907, to introduce fare agreements. From 1908, they began to present themselves through common branding as the Underground. The Waterloo & City Railway, operated by the main-line London and South Western Railway, was the only tube railway that {{did not participate in}} the arrangement.|$|E
