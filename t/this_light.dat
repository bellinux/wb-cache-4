5|$|The {{planet was}} {{confirmed}} by the Kepler satellite by the transit method, in which the planet passes {{across the face of}} its star in relation to Earth, dimming that star's light by a small amount; <b>this</b> <b>light</b> difference is then used to determine the planet and several of its characteristics, including size and distance from its home star.|$|E
5|$|A few insects, such {{as members}} of the {{families}} Poduridae and Onychiuridae (Collembola), Mycetophilidae (Diptera) and the beetle families Lampyridae, Phengodidae, Elateridae and Staphylinidae are bioluminescent. The most familiar group are the fireflies, beetles of the family Lampyridae. Some species are able to control <b>this</b> <b>light</b> generation to produce flashes. The function varies with some species using them to attract mates, while others use them to lure prey. Cave dwelling larvae of Arachnocampa (Mycetophilidae, fungus gnats) glow to lure small flying insects into sticky strands of silk.|$|E

5|$|In 1900, {{ownership}} of the gatehouse was transferred from Henry Somerset, 9th Duke of Beaufort to Monmouthshire County Council {{as part of the}} disposal of the entirety of the Somersets' land holdings in Monmouthshire. The gift is recorded on a brass plaque attached to the gatehouse. The local antiquarian Mary Ellen Bagnall-Oakeley wrote the first history of the bridge and gatehouse, Monnow Bridge Tower, which appeared in 1903. In April 1893, the first street light had been erected on the bridge by the town council. In the late 1920s, the top portion of <b>this</b> <b>light</b> was replaced by twin electric lamps. In the 1960s, the lamps were removed completely, and since 1991 the bridge has been floodlit.|$|E
5|$|In other words, column j of A {{expresses the}} image of vj {{in terms of the}} basis vectors wi of W; thus this {{relation}} uniquely determines the entries of the matrix A. The matrix depends on the choice of the bases: different choices of bases give rise to different, but equivalent matrices. Many of the above concrete notions can be reinterpreted in <b>this</b> <b>light,</b> for example, the transpose matrix AT describes the transpose of the linear map given by A, with respect to the dual bases.|$|E
5|$|On 2 June 2009, it was {{announced}} that the new album title would be In <b>This</b> <b>Light</b> and on This Evening and that they would be the first band to play at the new O2 Academy Birmingham. Through producer Flood's heavy usage of synthesisers, the album provided a synthpop/post-punk sound to Editors' production. Flood, who is famous for collaborating with electronic music influenced bands like U2, Depeche Mode, The Killers and Erasure, helped develop synthetic elements on the album, which resulted in a mixed reception from long-term fans as to the group's new direction.|$|E

5|$|The {{construction}} {{of the book and}} {{the subject matter of the}} poem within it share a metaphorical connection in the decay of memory. In <b>this</b> <b>light,</b> critic Peter Schwenger asserts that Agrippa can be understood as organized by two ideas: the death of Gibson's father, and the disappearance or absence of the book itself. In this sense, it instantiates the ephemeral nature of all text.|$|E
5|$|Unlike its sister, {{which was}} {{intended}} for emergency use only, <b>this</b> <b>light</b> was constantly manned by Coast Guard personnel, after the Coast Guard {{took charge of the}} lighthouses in the United States in 1939, who served two-week rotating tours. These men lived in the circular portion of the lighthouse. The dwelling encompassed not only the superstructure, but also part of the foundation, as shown by the ring of portholes in its side.|$|E
5|$|After {{the initial}} {{detection}} of a transit signal by Kepler, follow-up observations {{were taken to}} confirm the planetary nature of the candidate. Speckle imaging by the WIYN Telescope {{was used to determine}} the amount of light from nearby, background stars that was present. If not accounted for, <b>this</b> <b>light</b> would have made Kepler-6 appear brighter than it actually was. Consequently, the size of Kepler-6b would have been underestimated. Radial velocity data was taken by HIRES at the Keck I telescope {{in order to determine the}} mass of the planet. Independently, observations were made with the Spitzer Space Telescope at infrared wavelengths of 3.6 and 4.5 micrometres. Along with additional data taken by Kepler, these observations detected the occultation and phase curves of Kepler-6b behind its star.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the 8th century, sceattas were the primary {{circulating}} coinage. These were small silver pennies, which often did not bear the name of either the moneyer or the king for whom they were produced. To contemporaries these were probably known as pennies, and are the coins referred to in the laws of Ine of Wessex. <b>This</b> <b>light</b> coinage (in contrast to the heavier coins minted later in Offa's reign) can probably be dated to the late 760s and early 770s. A second, medium-weight coinage can be identified before the early 790s. These new medium-weight coins were heavier, broader and thinner than the pennies they replaced, and were prompted by the contemporary Carolingian currency reforms. The new pennies almost invariably carried both Offa's name {{and the name of the}} moneyer from whose mint the coins came. The reform in the coinage appears to have extended beyond Offa's own mints: the kings of East Anglia, Kent and Wessex all produced coins of the new heavier weight in this period.|$|E
5|$|Other {{evidence}} suggests hunting behavior in Tyrannosaurus. The eye-sockets of tyrannosaurs are positioned {{so that the}} eyes would point forward, giving them binocular vision slightly better than that of modern hawks. Tyrannosaur-inflicted damage has been found on skeletons of hadrosaurs and Triceratops {{that seemed to have}} survived initial attacks. Some researchers argue that if Tyrannosaurus were a scavenger, another dinosaur had to be the top predator in the Amerasian Upper Cretaceous. The top prey were the larger marginocephalians and ornithopods. The other tyrannosaurids share so many characteristics with Tyrannosaurus that only small dromaeosaurs remain as feasible top predators. In <b>this</b> <b>light,</b> scavenger hypothesis adherents have suggested that the size and power of tyrannosaurs allowed them to steal kills from smaller predators. Most paleontologists accept that Tyrannosaurus was an active predator that was willing to scavenge if it could.|$|E
5|$|The Presque Isle Light was {{constructed}} in 1872 {{on the north side}} of Presque Isle and was lit on July12, 1873. <b>This</b> <b>light</b> is , with a red brick house that was used as a lighthouse keeper residence, and later a park residence. Today the lighthouse is maintained by the United States Coast Guard and flashes a white light to warn ships of the sandy peninsula that juts into Lake Erie. The light station is open to public tours from Memorial Day through Labor Day on weekends, weather permitting (see presqueislelighthouse.org). A third, smaller lighthouse was built in 1906 by the Erie Waterworks on the Presque Isle Bay side of the peninsula. Today it stands in the ferry landing for the Presque Isle Water Taxi service, south of the former waterworks along the state park's multi-purpose trail on the southeast side of Presque Isle.|$|E

5|$|This {{was one of}} {{the private}} rooms used by Maria I during her time at Queluz. It is {{designed}} {{in the form of a}} , with a trellis pattern on the ceiling which is reflected in the design of the marquetry floor (illustrated below), giving the impression of being in a pergola rather than an interior. The marquetry floors of the private rooms distinguish these smaller more intimate rooms from the larger state rooms where such delicate features would have been damaged by more frequent use. The walls of the boudoir are heavily mirrored and contain overdoor and mirror carouches by José Conrado Rosa. Next to the boudoir is the Queen's bedroom; it was from <b>this</b> <b>light</b> and airy room that the demented shrieks of the Queen were reported by William Beckford, who visited the palace in 1794.|$|E
5|$|Velázquez uses <b>this</b> <b>light</b> {{not only}} to add volume and {{definition}} to each form but also to define the focal points of the painting. As the light streams in from the right it brightly glints on the braid and golden hair of the female dwarf, who is nearest the light source. But because her face is turned from the light, and in shadow, its tonality {{does not make it}} a point of particular interest. Similarly, the light glances obliquely on the cheek of the lady-in-waiting near her, but not on her facial features. Much of her lightly coloured dress is dimmed by shadow. The Infanta, however, stands in full illumination, and with her face turned towards the light source, even though her gaze is not. Her face is framed by the pale gossamer of her hair, setting her apart from everything else in the picture. The light models the volumetric geometry of her form, defining the conic nature of a small torso bound rigidly into a corset and stiffened bodice, and the panniered skirt extending around her like an oval candy-box, casting its own deep shadow which, by its sharp contrast with the bright brocade, both emphasises and locates the small figure as the main point of attention.|$|E
5|$|Wagner {{had been}} greatly {{impressed}} with his reading of Arthur Schopenhauer in 1854, and this deeply affected his thoughts and practice on music and art. Some writers (e.g. Bryan Magee) see Parsifal as Wagner's last great espousal of Schopenhauerian philosophy. Parsifal can heal Amfortas and redeem Kundry because he shows compassion, which Schopenhauer saw as the highest form of human morality. Moreover, he displays compassion {{in the face of}} sexual temptation (act 2, scene 3). Schopenhaurian philosophy also suggests that the only escape from the ever-present temptations of human life is through negation of the Will, and overcoming sexual temptation is in particular a strong form of negation of the Will. When viewed in <b>this</b> <b>light,</b> Parsifal, with its emphasis on Mitleid ("compassion") is a natural follow-on to Tristan und Isolde, where Schopenhauer's influence is perhaps more obvious, with its focus on Sehnen ("yearning"). Indeed, Wagner originally considered including Parsifal as a character in act 3 of Tristan, but later rejected the idea.|$|E

5|$|When {{examining}} Sue, paleontologist Pete Larson found {{a broken}} and healed fibula and tail vertebrae, scarred facial bones and a tooth from another Tyrannosaurus {{embedded in a}} neck vertebra. If correct, these might be strong evidence for aggressive behavior between tyrannosaurs but whether {{it would have been}} competition for food and mates or active cannibalism is unclear. Further recent investigation of these purported wounds has shown that most are infections rather than injuries (or simply damage to the fossil after death) and the few injuries are too general to be indicative of intraspecific conflict. Some researchers argue that if Tyrannosaurus were a scavenger, another dinosaur had to be the top predator in the Amerasian Upper Cretaceous. Top prey were the larger marginocephalians and ornithopods. The other tyrannosaurids share so many characteristics that only small dromaeosaurs and troodontids remain as feasible top predators. In <b>this</b> <b>light,</b> scavenger hypothesis adherents have suggested that the size and power of tyrannosaurs allowed them to steal kills from smaller predators, although they may have had a hard time finding enough meat to scavenge, being outnumbered by smaller theropods. Most paleontologists accept that Tyrannosaurus was both an active predator and a scavenger like most large carnivores.|$|E
