40|$|AbstractThe study {{investigates the}} {{individual}} differences in attitudes <b>to</b> <b>animals,</b> in the attempt at finding a wider predictive model that includes both sociodemographic and psychological variables. The adapted Romanian versions of the Attitudes <b>to</b> <b>Animals</b> Scale (AAS), Empathy <b>to</b> <b>Animals</b> Scale (ETA) and Belief in Animal Mind Questionnaire (BAM) were administered to 2683 participants in an online survey. Significant correlations between anthropomorphic beliefs, animal directed empathy and attitudes <b>to</b> <b>animals</b> were observed. Gender, owning a companion animal, anthropomorphic beliefs, cognitive and affective dimensions of empathy <b>to</b> <b>animals</b> were significant predictors of attitudes <b>to</b> <b>animals.</b> These findings are discussed...|$|R

5|$|Palmer {{does not}} {{explicitly}} connect Environmental Ethics and Process Thought <b>to</b> <b>Animal</b> Ethics in Context, her second monograph; the latter does, however, address environmental ethics, {{insofar as it}} offers an attempt to bridge environmental ethics and animal ethics. In contrast to more typical approaches <b>to</b> <b>animal</b> ethics which focus on the ethics of harming animals, Palmer asks, in Animal Ethics in Context, about the ethics of aiding animals, {{with a focus on}} the distinction between wild and domestic animals. She follows mainstream animal ethics approaches in arguing that humans have a prima facie duty not to harm any animal. However, when it comes to aiding animals, she argues that human obligations differ depending on the context.|$|E

40|$|In Western research, cruelty <b>to</b> <b>animals</b> in {{childhood}} {{has been associated}} with comorbid conduct problems and with interpersonal violence in later life. However, there is little understanding of the etiology of cruelty <b>to</b> <b>animals,</b> and what in the child 2 Ì† 7 s life may require attention if the chain linking animal cruelty and later violence is to be broken. The study reported in this paper investigated the association between parent-reported cruelty <b>to</b> <b>animals,</b> and parent- and self-reported psychological strengths and weaknesses in a sample of 379 elementary school children in an Eastern context, Malaysia. No gender differences were found in relation <b>to</b> cruelty <b>to</b> <b>animals</b> or psychological problems, as assessed with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). However, there were different predictors of cruelty <b>to</b> <b>animals</b> for boys and girls. Regression analyses found that for boys, parent-reported hyperactivity was a unique predictor of Malicious and Total Cruelty <b>to</b> <b>animals.</b> For girls, self-reported conduct problems was a unique predictor of Typical Cruelty <b>to</b> <b>animals.</b> Parent-reported total difficulties were associated with Typical, Malicious, and Total Cruelty <b>to</b> <b>animals.</b> We suggest that routine screening of children with an instrument such as the SDQ may help to detect those children who may need to undergo further assessment and perhaps intervention to break the chain linking childhood cruelty <b>to</b> <b>animals</b> and later conduct problems. <br /...|$|R

5|$|Gary Edward Varner (born March 10, 1957) is an American philosopher specialising in {{environmental}} ethics, philosophical questions related <b>to</b> <b>animal</b> rights and animal welfare, and R.

He was educated at Arizona State University, the University of Georgia and the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison; at Madison, where he was supervised by Jon Morline, he wrote one of the first doctoral theses on environmental ethics. Varner's first monograph was In Nature's Interests?, which was published by Oxford University Press in 1998. In the book, Varner defended a form of biocentric individualism, according to which all living entities have morally considerable interests.|$|E
5|$|Hadley {{is known}} for his account of animal {{property}} rights theory. He proposes that wild animals be offered property rights over their territories, and that guardians be appointed to represent their interests in decision-making procedures. He suggests that this account could be justified directly, {{on the basis of the}} interests of the animals concerned, or indirectly, so that natural environments are protected. The theory has received discussion in popular and academic contexts, with critical responses from farming groups and mixed responses from moral and political theorists. Hadley has also conducted research on normative issues related <b>to</b> <b>animal</b> rights extremism, the aiding of others and utilitarianism.|$|E

5|$|In {{the final}} chapter Cochrane argues that each school has an {{important}} contribution to make <b>to</b> <b>animal</b> justice, particularly liberalism and utilitarianism. He then outlines his own approach. He writes that, while talk of our political and moral obligations to animals is today more prominent than ever, it remains on the periphery of mainstream dialogue in political theory. He closes by arguing that this neglect is a problem for political theory, and that animals are owed justice. If the book's claims are correct, Cochrane concludes, questions concerning the treatment of animals should be considered some of the most pressing political issues today.|$|E
5|$|Palmer {{begins by}} {{defending}} {{the claim that}} animals have moral standing, and then surveys three key approaches <b>to</b> <b>animal</b> ethics; utilitarian approaches, animal rights approaches, and capabilities approaches. All are lacking, she argues, as they are fundamentally capacity-oriented, and thus unable to properly take account of human relationships to animals. However, her approach leans more strongly towards a Regan-inspired rights view. She next identifies different kinds of relations humans may have with animals: affective, contractual and, most significantly, causal.|$|E
