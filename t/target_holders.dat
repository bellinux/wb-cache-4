40|$|Be- 10 {{accelerator}} {{mass spectrometry}} (AMS) is {{an increasingly important}} tool in studies ranging from exposure age dating and palaeo-geomagnetism {{to the impact of}} solar variability on the Earth's climate. High levels of boron in BeO AMS targets can adversely impact the quality of Be- 10 measurements through interference from the isobar B- 10. Numerous methods in chemical sample preparation and AMS measurement have been employed {{in order to reduce the}} impact of excessive boron rates. We present details of a method developed to chemically reprocess a set of forty boron-contaminated BeO targets derived from modern Antarctic ice. Previously, the excessive boron levels in these samples, as measured in an argon-filled absorber cell preceding the ionisation detector, had precluded routine AMS measurement. The procedure involved removing the BeO + Nb mixture from the <b>target</b> <b>holders</b> and dissolving the BeO in hot concentrated H 2 SO 4. The solution was then heated with HF to remove the boron as volatile BF 3 before re-precipitating as Be(OH) (2) and calcining to BeO. This was again mixed with niobium and pressed into fresh <b>target</b> <b>holders.</b> Following reprocessing, the samples gave boron rates reduced by 10 - 100 x, which were sufficiently low and similar to previous successful batches of ice core, snow and associated blank samples, thus allowing a successful Be- 10 measurement in the absence of any boron correction. Overall recovery of the BeO for this process averaged 40 %. Extensive testing of relevant processing equipment and reagents failed to determine the source of the boron. As a precautionary measure, a similar H 2 SO 4 + HF step has been subsequently added to the standard ice processing method. © 2013, Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
40|$|Introduction The {{expansion}} of our PET isotope production {{with a new}} TR- 19 cyclotron necessitated a suitable solid target transport system. None of the known existing and proposed solid target transport systems (STTS) was {{able to meet the}} technical and budget requirements of the MIR cyclotron facility [5]. A unique carrier design allowed us to develop a fully automated 50. 8 mm inner diameter pneumatic tube STTS with an in-hot-cell compact form factor receiving station. The cyclotron or vault side loading station is a mere vertically symmetric version of the in-hot-cell station. The carrier is able to accommodate any of our inhouse developed 86 Y, 64 Cu, 76 Br, 89 Zr and 99 mTc <b>target</b> <b>holders</b> without further modifications. Material and Methods Technical constraints were imposed by the dimensions of the <b>target</b> <b>holders</b> (FIG. 1) and the overall station size (FIG. 3). A receiving station would be inside a hot cell and, up to three sending stations would be located in the confined vault space under the solid target irradiation units. In addition, safety and budget requirements demanded a fully automated, easy to maintain STTS. The <b>target</b> <b>holders</b> are of various geometries with the 99 mTc having the maximum dimension of 46. 65 mm along its diagonal. Pseudo carriers with diameters ranging from 41 to 49. 5 mm (no wear band) and lengths from 50. 8 to 102 mm were tested on 50. 8 mm inner diameter Kuriyama Tigerflex™ and Goodyear Nutriflex™ tubing. Smaller diameter and length test samples became wobbly, slow, and were getting stuck on occasion. Lengths in the upper limits became stuck in turns with radii close to the minimum radius of the tubing. The necessary negative pressure was achieved by employing a 2. 5 pHP Ridgid WD 06250 blower. The transparent Goodyear Nutriflex™ tubing was chosen for the further STTS development. A carrier capable of loading and unloading regardless of its axial orientation was constructed. This novel design allows for a relatively compact station W 112 × H 220 × L 300, which reduce the dependence on the location of the tube openings in the walls of the hot cell (BqSv, Taiwan). As a result the station can be conveniently placed in areas not typically occupied by processing modules or used by chemists, e. g. close to the upper left corner. To avoid reliance on expensive proprietary parts, all components were designed or chosen to insure reliability with minimal maintenance. The enclosure and opening mechanism are 3 D-printable using ABS plastic, and can be made in-house on demand. “Platform sharing” between hot cell and vault stations further simplifies support and maintenance. As with the mechanical hardware, the electronic components and boards were selected to minimize the dependency on a single supplier. The main controller board is based on Atmelś AVR series of microcontrollers, which are known to be largely backward compatible, well documented and have an extensive user support base. A single “brick” controls up to three stations. Bricks can be daisy chained with one functioning as a master. The control software takes advantage of the rapid development capabilities of National Instrumentś LabView graphical language. It is intended to work on Unix-like and Windows operating systems as well as to allow control from hand-held devices. Password security, interlocks and traceability follow the accepted safety standards for radioisotope handling. Results and Conclusion The Symmetric STTS has proven characteristics of reliability, ease of use and safety over hundreds of runs. Given that no convenient carting path exists, it is the ideal means for bringing solid <b>target</b> <b>holders</b> from the underground cyclotron vault to the chemistry processing hot cells at ground level. Transported activities are less than 37. 0 GBq (1. 0 Ci) for 64 Cu and 3. 7 GBq (100 mCi) for 89 Zr. Carrier velocity is about 4. 7 m/s minimizing the time activity is present between cyclotron and hot cell. No human interaction with the irradiated target is needed during transport. The carrier {{does not need to be}} taken out of the STTS. Even though the BqSv hot cells are equipped with teletongs, they are not needed to recover the target when it arrives at the hot cell; the target is directly dropped into the processing module, e. g. the dissolution vessel for 64 Cu processing. The software is engineered in a manner that gives the operator full control of the states of the sending and receiving stations. At the same time, it avoids graphically dense and overloaded GUI in order to reduce the probability of human error. Currently the control program runs on a PC/Laptop and communicates with the controller over USB. LabView provides add-ons that allow control with a tablet or other hand-held (under development). The fully automated symmetric STTS is ideal for isotope production facilities that are being envisioned, conceptualized or are in their planning stage. Its versatility, low initial and operating costs might even justify deployment in facilities which already employ a less optimal solid target transport. Invention application for the Symmetric STTS was filed with the Office of Technology Management of Washington University in Saint Louis, Missouri, USA...|$|E

The target chamber has a volume of 2200 1. The vacuum system allows a total pressure less than 10 high minus 7 mbar. The energy of the implanter is 60 keV (extendable to 160 keV) with ion currents of 0, 01 to 6 mA allowing for implantation doses between 10 high 12 to 10 high 18 cm high minus 2 depending on sample size. The beam is mass analyzed. The mass range for 50 keV ions is 1 to 180 amu. Since the source has an oven which can reach 1200 degrees C, many elements can be directly evaporated and ionizied without the need to use toxic gases.

In addition to serving as a key production site for californium- 252 and other transuranic elements, important examples of therapeutic radioisotopes which are currently routinely produced in the HFIR for distribution include dysprosium- 166 (parent of holmium- 166), rhenium- 186, tin- 117 m and tungsten- 188 (parent of rhenium- 188).

Carbon stripper foils (20, 40, 50 µg/cm 2), temporarily replacing the UNILAC gas stripper, were used at 1. 4 MeV/u to provide for highly charged uranium ions (around 39 +) to be delivered to the SIS 18 for beam life time measurements (low current high duty factor). High current tests to check the durability of the carbon foils (with low duty factor) showed no measurable variation of the stripped beam in the poststripper DTL during the life time of the foils.

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{advantages}} of proton or ion beams, applied in cancer treatment, is their excellent depth-dose profile exhibiting a low dose in the entrance channel and a distinct dose maximum (Bragg peak) {{near the end of}} range in tissue. In the region of the Bragg peak, where the protons or ions are almost stopped, experimental studies with low-energy particle beams and thin biological samples may contribute valuable information on the biological effectiveness in the stopping region. Such experiments, however, require beam optimization and special dosimetry techniques for determining the absolute dose and dose homogeneity for very thin biological samples. At the National Centre of Accelerators in Seville, one of the beam lines at the 3  MV Tandem Accelerator was equipped with a scattering device, a special parallel-plate ionization chamber with very thin electrode foils and <b>target</b> <b>holders</b> for cell cultures. In this work, we present the calibration in absolute dose of EBT 3 films [Gafchromic radiotherapy films, [URL] for proton energies in the region of the Bragg peak, where the linear energy transfer increases and becomes more significant for radiobiology studies, as well as the response of the EBT 3 films for different proton energy values. To irradiate the films in the Bragg peak region, the energy of the beam was degraded passively, by interposing Mylar foils of variable thickness to place the Bragg peak inside the active layer of the film.

The metrics of quality included color, hardness/texture, and appearance (photo and SEM), along with FT-IR, Raman, and powder X-ray diffraction spectra that correlate positively with reliable and intense ion currents and accuracy, precision, and sensitivity of fraction modern (Fm). Our previous method produced AMS targets of gray-colored iron−carbon materials (ICM) 20 % of the time and of graphite-coated iron (GCI) 80 % of the time. The ICM was hard, its FT-IR spectra lacked the sp 2 bond, its Raman spectra had no detectable G′ band at 2700 cm− 1, and it had more iron carbide (Fe 3 C) crystal than nanocrystalline graphite or graphitizable carbon (g-C). ICM produced low and variable ion current whereas the opposite was true for the graphitic GCI. Our optimized method produced AMS targets of graphite-coated iron powder (GCIP) 100 % of the time. The GCIP shared some of the same properties as GCI in that both were black in color, both produced robust ion current consistently, their FT-IR spectra had the sp 2 bond, their Raman spectra had matching D, G, G′, D+G, and D′′ bands, and their XRD spectra showed matching crystal size. GCIP was a powder that was easy to tamp into AMS <b>target</b> <b>holders</b> that also facilitated high throughput. We concluded that AMS targets of GCIP were a mix of graphitizable carbon and Fe 3 C crystal, because none of their spectra, FT-IR, Raman, or XRD, matched exactly those of the graphite standard.

40|$|Forty 10 Be {{samples of}} Antarctic ice (DSS 0506 -pit) along with {{associated}} procedural blanks, {{measured at the}} ANTARES AMS facility at ANSTO {{were found to have}} 10 - 100 times the 10 B levels of routine BeO samples and blanks (full procedural blanks with this beryl carrier are typically 10 Be/ 9 Be < 5 x 10 - 15). These exceptionally high boron rates (measured via an active absorber cell filled with argon gas), coupled with the relatively low 10 Be/ 9 Be ratios of ice samples, made any correction to the raw 10 Be detector count rate highly unreliable and uncertain. As this was a unique sample set, a method for reprocessing the targets to remove the boron was developed and tested. For measurement on ANTARES ~ 0. 5 mg BeO is mixed with ~ 2. 0 mg of niobium powder and rearpressed into an aluminium target holder with a 1. 6 mm diameter recess at 120 kPa. To reprocess the samples, this BeO/Nb mixture was physically removed from the <b>target</b> <b>holders</b> by pushing the sample loading pin forward with a hand press. The beryllium was separated from the niobium by dissolving the BeO in concentrated H 2 SO 4. This solution was then heated with HF to remove the boron as BF 3. The beryllium was then re-precipitated as Be(OH) 2 and calcined to BeO, which was then mixed with new niobium powder before being rear-pressed into a detachable cap target holder with a smaller (1 mm) diameter recess. Overall yields for this process averaged 40 %. Boron levels for all the original samples and blanks returned to acceptable levels, with 10 Be/ 9 Be blanks of ~ 10 x 10 - 15. Extensive testing of the equipment, reagents and laboratory failed to determine the source of the boron. As a precautionary measure, a similar H 2 SO 4 /HF step has been subsequently added to the standard ice processing method, resulting in consistently low boron levels without any decrease in processing yields.

40|$|Impact {{cratering}} and asteroid collisions {{are major}} processes throughout the Solar System. Although previous collision-related impact investigations exist (Flynn et al. 2015, Holsapple et al. 2002 and Burchell et al. 1998 are good examples), {{in the works}} covering this broad range of investigation, the targets are non-rotating (for the purposes of catastrophic disruption) and different temperature conditions are not considered (for impact cratering). Accordingly, I present experimental processes and data, regarding hypervelocity impact experiments into analogues of (1) rotating asteroids and (2) temperature dependant terrestrial planetary rock. During {{the course of this}} work, it was necessary to develop new apparatus and new experimental techniques such as three separate <b>target</b> <b>holders</b> to aid in both catastrophic disruption and heated impact projects, a 3 -dimensional model analysis of craters and a completely new, statistically robust, technique to determine a complete crater profile called the KDM method where KDM is Kinnear-Deller-Morris. The main result from this work showed that during an asteroid impact collision where the asteroid is not rotating, the impact energy density for catastrophic disruption is Q*static = 1442 ± 90 J kg- 1. However, when the target asteroid was rotating, the condition Q*rotation = 1097 ± 296 J kg- 1. The mean value of Q* had thus reduced, but the spread in the data on individual experiments was larger. This leads to two conclusions. The mean value for Q*, based on measurements of many impacts, falls, due to the internal forces acting in the body which are associated with the rotation. This energy term reduction means that the amount of energy to instigate catastrophic disruption is lower and that a rotating asteroid is effectively weaker upon impact than a stationary asteroid. However, the spread in the results indicates {{that this is not a}} uniform process, and an individual result for Q* for a rotating or spinning target may be spread over a large range. For the temperature related impacts, as the targets were heated to approximately 1000 K, the target rocks showed an impact dependence more similar to a plastic phase-state than to solidus, due to being held close to temperatures associated with semi-plastic phases. Basalt impact craters displayed this relationship greatest with crater sizes becoming smaller at the higher temperature ranges but larger in the colder brittle solidus temperatures, partly explained in experiments by increased spallation...|$|E

40|$|Introduction All {{experimental}} studies involving charged particle induced nuclear reactions require a precise knowledge of monitor reactions. A number of well described proton induced monitor reactions {{exist in the}} lower energy range [1], which is covered by most medical cyclotrons. Concerning proton energies above 20 MeV, however, {{the accuracy of the}} monitor reactions declines as cross section data becomes scarcer. Furthermore, the growing interest in precise determination of projectile energies by comparing of ratios of monitor reaction cross sections demands new measurements and evaluations of known data for high threshold monitor radionuclides. In this work cross section measurements on the formation of 61 Cu were done and energy de-pendent radionuclide ratios were calculated. Material and Methods For investigation of the natCu(p,x) 61 Cu reaction copper foils of natural isotopic composition (Goodfellow Ltd.) were irradiated. The targets were of 10 and 20 μm thickness, having a diameter of 15 mm. Proton bombardments up to 45 MeV incident energy were done in the stacked-foil arrangement at the accelerator JULIC of the Nuclear Physics Institute (IKP) of the Forschungszentrum Jülich. In addition to an internal irradiation possibility the cyclotron is equipped with an external target station which was used for most experiments. It can adapt standard and slanting solid <b>target</b> <b>holders</b> and is equipped with a water cooled four sector collimator and additional helium cooling of the entry foil. Several irradiations were executed. In each stack, besides copper samples, aluminium absorbers and additional nickel monitor foils were also placed, the latter for the determination of the respective beam current. The produced radioactivity of 61 Cu was analysed non-destructively using HPGe γ-ray detectors (EG&G Ortec). Results and Conclusion Reaction cross sections of the natCu(p,x) 61 Cu process up to 45 MeV were measured and com-pared with existing data from the literature (FIG. 2). Except for the data of Williams et al. our results are in good agreement, showing a maxi-mum of about 165 mbarn at 37. 5 MeV proton energy. The overall uncertainty of the new cross section data is between 8 and 10 %. In FIG. 3, the excitation functions of the relevant monitor reactions on Cu are shown. In combination with the excitation function of the natCu(p,xn) 62 Zn reaction, isotope ratios were calculated which can be used for determination of the proton energy within a target stack in the energy range of 22 – 40 MeV as described by Piel et al. [3]. FIGURE 4 shows the cross section ratio in dependence of the proton energy. Above this energy, 65 Zn could be used to generate isotope ratios for energy determination, although the long half-life (T½ = 244. 3 d) of that radionuclide may be a problem. Additional cross section measurements are planned in order to further strengthen the data base of this potential monitor reaction.

These use a tube furnace to heat the catalyst to 600 °C and a Peltier-cooled water trap. Samples containing just a few micrograms of carbon can be prepared. We describe progress with a 0. 5 mL laser-heated ‘microfurnace’ we are developing for the rapid and efficient graphitisation of 5 μg samples. Following operating experience with a prototype unit, work has commenced {{on the development of}} a second-generation device with the goal of fully automated operation with minimal introduction of extraneous carbon. Key to development of micro-sample 14 C AMS is the ability to reliably handle the graphite/iron sample and to mount it in the ion source <b>target</b> <b>holder.</b> We have developed a <b>target</b> <b>holder</b> that permits the sample to be loaded in a 1 mm diameter recess and rear pressed, ensuring a high quality surface finish, at a reproducible depth. Additionally we have developed a method for systematically aligning the sample stage with the cesium beam following ion source servicing...|$|R
40|$|The Genesis {{concentrator}} was custom {{designed to}} focus solar wind ions primarily for terrestrial isotopic analysis of O- 17 /O- 16 and O- 18 /O- 16 to +/- 1 %, N- 15 /N- 14 to +/- 1 %, and secondarily to conduct elemental and isotopic analysis of Li, Be, and B. The circular 6. 2 cm diameter concentrator <b>target</b> <b>holder</b> {{was comprised of}} four quadrants of highly pure semiconductor materials that included one amorphous diamond-like carbon, one C- 13 diamond, and two silicon carbide (SiC). The amorphous diamond-like carbon quadrant was fractured upon impact at Utah Test and Training Range (UTTR), but the remaining three quadrants survived fully intact and all four quadrants hold an important collection of solar wind. The quadrants {{were removed from the}} <b>target</b> <b>holder</b> at NASA Johnso n Space Center Genesis Curation Laboratory in April 2005, and have been housed in stainless steel containers under continual nitrogen purge since time of disintegration. In preparation for allocation of a silicon carbide target for oxygen isotope analyses at UCLA, the two SiC targets were photographed for preliminary inspection of macro particle contamination from the hard non-nominal landing as well as characterized by spectroscopic ellipsometry to evaluate thin film contamination. This report is focused on Genesis SiC target sample number 60003...|$|R
30|$|For calibration, the {{instrument}} is laid on its rear side so that certified weights of 1, 2, 5, and 10 mg (± 0.006 mg) {{can be put}} on the target surface. Combinations of up to four of the weights with the total mass m exert the force F=mg on the target, where g= 9.81 ms − 2 is the local gravitational acceleration. For the calibration, the damping unit is removed, because the cantilever is bent almost 3 mm due to the weight of the mirrors and the target holder; the <b>target</b> <b>holder</b> would rest on the damping unit.|$|R

To measure the position and orientation of the robot tool center point, a specific adapter with retro reflective markers is mounted on the spindle. The calculation of the transformation of this <b>target</b> <b>holder</b> to the robot tool {{is part of this}} paper along with the calibration from the robot to the camera system. These datasets serve as the basis of a static pose control, where the robot absolute accuracy errors will be greatly reduced...|$|R
40|$|Influence of {{the manner}} in which the armour plates are held during their {{ballistic}} testing on the armour performance, has been evaluated. One armour plate was clamped rigidly to the test stand while a second plate of identical composition, hardness, and dimensions was hung loosely from the <b>target</b> <b>holder.</b> Both these plates were impacted with the same type of projectiles and over the same impact velocity range. The nature of ballistic damage evaluated indicates that {{the manner in}} which the armour is held during ballistic testing has a negligible influence on its performance at least when the mass of the plate is substantially higher than that of the projectile.

50|$|The shooter has {{the option}} to shoot at 5 Trans-Star II or 5 QIT targets. The shooter can use any {{standard}} issue firearm and any holster that the shooter would carry on, or off duty. The shooter must have a covering garment, such as a vest or jacket, that conceals the firearm and the magazine pouch. A PACT timer or facing <b>targets</b> <b>holders</b> are {{necessary in order to}} ensure that the course is completed within 5 seconds. Course must be shot from left to right on turning targets. Targets must have a minimum of 1.5 feet of space between them, and must be span at least 5 yards from the end to end (first to last target).|$|R
5000|$|Priced {{at about}} £20 when first {{launched}} in 1973, it was BSA's first air pistol. The standard kit included {{a bottle of}} oil, a small tube of pellets, a pressed steel <b>target</b> <b>holder</b> with <b>targets,</b> and a barrel extension to provide extra leverage when cocking. Original packaging was in a polystyrene tray with a printed cardboard outer sleeve. In 2009 a [...]22 Mk2 Scorpion pistol in good order, in its original packaging and accessories, sold for £170 in the UK. Good examples of this pistol are still available, however many have been poorly maintained and although most parts are still available from specialist suppliers, some {{are in short supply}} and restoration is neither straightforward nor cheap.|$|R
40|$|Here {{we present}} a {{next-generation}} experimental setup for high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy of solid and liquid samples in the soft X-ray region to elucidate the complex molecular structures of (bio) chemical systems. The setup consists of a main target chamber, a <b>target</b> <b>holder</b> for either solid samples or a liquid jet delivery system, and a high-resolution soft X-ray grating spectrometer. This setup is in commissioning at PETRA III, presently {{one of the most}} brilliant storage ring based X-ray radiation sources in the world.

5000|$|On {{a handgun}} range, {{shooters}} fire semi-automatic pistols, revolvers, and (sometimes) submachine guns at stationary targets along, {{or at the}} end of, a 15-100 yard (14-91 meter) long lane. Paper or cardboard targets are hung from a dummy or <b>target</b> <b>holder</b> positioned on a slide; this arrangement allows the shooter to control the shooting distance and retrieve targets for inspection. The target is typically hung from a replaceable hanger attached to a mechanized or motorized assembly that can be placed at varying distances from the shooter, {{by means of an}} electrical switch or manual pulley system. Common range shooting distances are 5 yards (4.5 meters) to 33 yards (23-30 meters). Most ranges have minimum shooter-to-target distances, set by the range master, determined by safety considerations.|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} a bachelor thesis in Mechanical Engineering, Product development and design {{and has been}} carried out in collaboration with SAAB Training & Simulation in Huskvarna. The thesis project involved a product development process beginning with establishment of specifications and concept generation through 3 D modelling which then resulted in a complete prototype. The task presented by SAAB Training & Simulation consisted of developing a portable combined <b>target</b> <b>holder</b> and transportation case for their current livescoring projectile monitoring system, the LOMAH 700. A theoretical background was necessary to gain an understanding of the complex nature of a product development process and the stages involved. Different concept generation and evaluation methods were explored, including the Go/No-go and Vendor Evaluation Matrices, as well as engineering practices such as Design for Manufacturing and Design for Assembly. Various materials and production techniques were also investigated to optimize functionality of the product, as well as cost of production. The methods researched in the theoretical background were then applied throughout the development process. Brainstorming was used to generate numerous different ideas which were then evaluated using three different matrices. This resulted in one leading concept which was further developed through detail work and review. The work continued with 3 D-modelling and drawing using SolidWorks to ultimately produce the grounds for manufacturing. The final concept consisted of a transportation case ordered from the case manufacturing company, SKB Cases. Custom-made components included legs with adjustable length and angle and a <b>target</b> <b>holder</b> used for fixing a target and the LOMAH 700 onto the transportation case. The custom-made parts were produced by SAAB, and the prototype was then assembled. The prototype was ultimately tested to ensure the fulfillment of the specifications defined by SAAB Training & Simulation...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of thermal}} {{evolution}} mass spectrometry {{in conjunction with}} the helium probe represents a powerful method of studying the gas-defect interaction processes associated with ion bombardment of single crystal targets. The energy and fluence dependence of the damage build-up processes together with the annealing characteristics of the damage are of considerable importance in view of the widespread use of low energy ion beam and plasma cleaning techniques. The apparatus described comprises a low energy ion gun based on an electron bombardment source and Wien filter and target chamber incorporating a multiple <b>target</b> <b>holder</b> assembly. The design considerations and operating characteristics of the overall system are described and the often used ion bombardment cleaning procedures discussed with reference to experimental thermal evolution measurements of low energy argon and helium trapping...|$|R
