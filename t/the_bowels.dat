5|$|At 06:00, {{a breeze}} pushed Boadicea forward {{and she began}} to close with her former consort, Rowley {{watching}} as all three of Africaines masts gave way and collapsed over the side one by one. By 08:00, Africaine was a dismasted hull and Corbet was dead in <b>the</b> <b>bowels</b> of the ship, although the exact manner of his death was to cause lasting controversy. By 10:00, Boadicea had been joined by Otter and Staunch and bore down on the French ships and their prize, so that by 15:30 Bouvet was persuaded to abandon Africaine and tow the damaged Iphigénie back to Port Napoleon. By 17:00, Boadicea pulled alongside Africaine and the French prize crew surrendered. Rowley later reported that a number of British sailors leaped into the sea at his approach and swam to Boadicea, requesting that they be allowed to pursue the French ships in the hope of capturing one.|$|E
5|$|In a later {{version of}} the film, Auto comes to the docking bay to {{retrieve}} EVE's plant. The film would have its first cutaway to the captain, but Stanton moved that as he found it too early to begin moving away from WALL-E's point-of-view. As an homage to Get Smart, Auto takes the plant and goes into <b>the</b> <b>bowels</b> of the ship into a room resembling a brain where he watches videos of Buy n Large's scheme {{to clean up the}} Earth falling apart through the years. Stanton removed this to keep some mystery as to why the plant is taken from EVE. The captain appears to be unintelligent, but Stanton wanted him to just be unchallenged; otherwise he would have been unempathetic. One example of how unintelligent the captain was depicted initially is that he was seen to wear his hat upside-down, only to fix it before he challenges Auto. In the finished film, he merely wears it casually atop his head, tightening it when he assumes real command of the Axiom.|$|E

30|$|Inflammatory or {{infectious}} diseases of <b>the</b> <b>bowel</b> are usually centred in <b>the</b> <b>bowel</b> wall {{and can cause}} segmental or diffuse wall thickening [17]. However, in a few inflammatory enteric or perienteric conditions, the inflammatory changes are more prominent in the mesentery adjacent to <b>the</b> <b>bowel</b> rather than in <b>the</b> <b>bowel</b> wall itself. In these conditions, <b>the</b> <b>bowel</b> involvement is usually focal and mild, and the fat stranding is disproportionately greater than the degree of wall thickening. This is a helpful clue in narrowing the differential diagnosis to mainly four conditions: diverticulitis, epiploic appendagitis, omental infarction and appendicitis [17].|$|R

Armstrong decides to spare Cate's life, believing {{that she is a}} fellow Scot. Cate awakens and is soon thrown from the plane as it explodes. After surviving the fall via parachute, Cate is later introduced to a new partner, Tom Goodman, a UNITY agent from the American branch. After meeting him in a nightclub in Hamburg, they are ambushed by H.A.R.M. but manage to escape. The nightclub is owned by a German singer named Inge Wagner, whom Cate suspects is connected with H.A.R.M. The two are then tasked to investigate a cargo freighter containing several suspicious chemical containers that UNITY believes are linked to Dr. Schenker. Cate gets in the freighter, and after taking photos of the containers, is knocked unconscious by Armstrong, who spares her life by locking her in a cargo hold, thus ignoring Wagner's insistence that she must be liquidated. As the freighter heads out to sea, it slowly begins to sink, due to a huge explosion. Wagner and Armstrong escape immediately, but Cate has to fight her way out of <b>the</b> <b>bowels</b> of the freighter. Because Cate could not obtain the required information, she and Tom must return to the sunken freighter to finish gathering intelligence aboard. Cate goes scuba diving, and after investigating the shipwreck and obtaining the captain's log and the cargo manifest, she is ambushed by H.A.R.M. divers sent from a submarine commanded by Armstrong and Wagner but manages to escape.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: More {{and more}} {{complicated}} laparoscopic abdominal surgeries {{are now being}} performed across the world. Laparoscopic suturing of <b>the</b> <b>bowel</b> perforations is being performed by experienced surgeons. We have developed our own technique of small <b>bowel</b> anchoring to <b>the</b> abdominal wall before suturing the perforation. Our Modification: A single stitch is taken {{at the corner of}} the perforation. The long end of the suture is retrieved by a suture retrieval needle and <b>the</b> small <b>bowel</b> is anchored to the abdominal wall. Rest of <b>the</b> <b>bowel</b> perforation is suture by the intracorporeal knot-tying technique. Advantages: Anchoring <b>the</b> <b>bowel</b> to <b>the</b> abdominal wall helps in fixation of <b>the</b> <b>bowel</b> to be sutured. This helps specifically for large perforation. Suturing and knot tying is relatively easy by this technique...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackground/PurposeIn fetuses with gastroschisis, toxic {{products}} in the amniotic fluid and constriction at the defect of the abdominal wall are considered causative of damage to <b>the</b> eviscerated <b>bowel.</b> <b>The</b> {{aim of this study}} was to cover <b>the</b> eviscerated <b>bowel</b> in gastroschisis with a collagen scaffold to protect <b>the</b> <b>bowel</b> and induce cell growth into the scaffold, which could lead to skin or abdominal wall formation replacing the scaffold. MethodsIn 12 fetal lambs gastroschisis was surgically created at 79 days gestation. A dual-layer type I collagen scaffold was sutured into the skin of the abdominal wall around the defect covering <b>the</b> eviscerated <b>bowel.</b> Lambs were examined after caesarean section at 140 days' gestation. ResultsSurvival was 67 %. In 7 of 8 surviving lambs <b>the</b> <b>bowel</b> was found to be covered after birth. One scaffold had ruptured. <b>The</b> <b>bowel</b> was found repositioned in the abdominal cavity in 5 lambs. In 2 lambs it was still partially outside. Only minor adherence of bowel loops and no fibrous peel formation were seen. Connective tissue and skin tissue replaced the scaffold. ConclusionsPrenatal coverage of <b>the</b> <b>bowel</b> in experimental gastroschisis with a collagen scaffold is feasible in fetal lambs, significantly diminished damage to <b>the</b> <b>bowel</b> wall, and skin and connective tissue replaced the scaffold. This technique may be promising in the care of fetuses with this congenital anomaly...|$|R
25|$|Acute {{conditions}} affecting <b>the</b> <b>bowels</b> include infectious diarrhoea and mesenteric ischaemia. Causes of constipation {{may include}} faecal impaction and bowel obstruction, which may in turn {{be caused by}} ileus, intussusception, volvulus. Inflammatory bowel disease is a condition of unknown aetiology, classified as either Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, that can affect the intestines {{and other parts of}} the gastrointestinal tract. Other causes of illness include intestinal pseudoobstruction, and necrotizing enterocolitis.|$|E
25|$|One {{example of}} this is necrotizing {{enterocolitis}} (NEC), which is a devastating disease that affects <b>the</b> <b>bowels</b> of premature infants.
