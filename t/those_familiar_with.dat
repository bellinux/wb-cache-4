Although virtually unknown to many voters, Miller was viewed by <b>those</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> him as a wise choice for the vice-presidential nomination, with his supporters arguing that he would {{play a key role in}} waging an aggressive campaign against Lyndon Johnson and the Democrats.|$|E
5|$|Capcom's design {{philosophy}} for Marvel vs. Capcom 3 was {{to maximize}} gameplay depth and minimize complexity. According to Niitsuma, the development team sought {{to create a}} game that would reach out to longtime fans of the series, while simultaneously expanding their user base to <b>those</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> the characters, but perhaps not with fighting games in general. The urge {{to reach out to}} new players also stemmed from Marvel's recent success in the Hollywood film industry. Capcom's global head of production, Keiji Inafune, expressed interest in appealing to a worldwide audience. These ideas drove the decision to retool the fighting system, which was criticized in past iterations for being too complicated for casual players. These changes include the implementation of the three-button attack system from Tatsunoko vs. Capcom and the addition of Simple Mode. Unlike previous titles in the series, Capcom had no plans for an arcade release, and focused only on console versions for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. When asked if Capcom was planning to release the game on other consoles, Niitsuma did not dismiss the possibility for a Nintendo Wii version; however, this ultimately did not come to fruition.|$|E

25|$|The {{characters}} must be legible. As calligraphy is {{the method}} of writing well, a calligraphic work must be recognizable as script, and furthermore be easily legible to <b>those</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> the script style, {{although it may be}} illegible to those unfamiliar with the script style. For example, many people cannot read cursive, but a calligraphic work in cursive can still be considered good if <b>those</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> cursive can read it.|$|E
25|$|German wine {{classification}} {{is sometimes}} {{the source of}} confusion. However, to <b>those</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> the terms used, a German wine label reveals much information about the wine's origin, minimum ripeness of the grapes used for the wine {{as well as the}} dryness/sweetness of the wine.|$|E
25|$|As a result, {{sales of}} all his books suffered, and Cozzens has become {{virtually}} unknown to the general public; he remains, however, fairly well known among <b>those</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> the literary criticism of George Steiner, John Derbyshire, and Matthew Bruccoli, {{all of whom have}} praised his work.|$|E

25|$|Interlingua's {{greatest}} {{advantage is}} that it is the most widely understood international auxiliary language besides Interlingua (IL) de A.p.I. by virtue of its naturalistic (as opposed to schematic) grammar and vocabulary, allowing <b>those</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> a Romance language, and educated speakers of English, to read and understand it without prior study.|$|E
25|$|All Pullen's future {{recordings}} {{under his}} own name were for Blue Note. On 16 December 1988 {{he went into the}} studio with Gary Peacock (bass) and Tony Williams (drums) to make his first trio album New Beginnings, which astonished even <b>those</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> his work and became widely {{regarded as one of the}} finest trio albums ever recorded. He followed this in 1990 with another trio album, Random Thoughts, in somewhat lighter mood, this time with James Genus (bass) and Lewis Nash (drums).|$|E

25|$|The main {{setting of}} The Chronicles of Narnia {{is the world}} of Narnia {{constructed}} by Lewis and, in The Magician's Nephew, the world containing the city of Charn. The Narnian and Charnian worlds are themselves posited as just two in a multiverse of countless worlds that includes our own universe, the main protagonists' world of origin. Passage between these worlds is possible, though rare, and may be accomplished by various means. Narnia itself is described as populated by {{a wide variety of}} creatures, most of which would be recognisable to <b>those</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> European mythologies and British and Irish fairy tales.|$|E
25|$|Interlingua {{gained a}} {{significant}} speaker community, perhaps {{roughly the same}} size as that of Ido (considerably less than the size of Esperanto). Interlingua's success {{can be explained by the}} fact that it is the most widely understood international auxiliary language by virtue of its naturalistic (as opposed to schematic) grammar and vocabulary, allowing <b>those</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> a Romance language, and educated speakers of English, to read and understand it without prior study. Interlingua has some active speakers currently on all continents, and the language is propagated by the Union Mundial pro Interlingua (UMI), and Interlingua is presented on CDs, radio, and television.|$|E
25|$|For <b>those</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> {{the effects}} of special relativity, such as Lorentz {{contraction}} and time dilation, the Alcubierre metric has some apparently peculiar aspects. In particular, Alcubierre has shown that a ship using an Alcubierre drive travels on a free-fall geodesic even while the warp bubble is accelerating: its crew would be in free fall while accelerating without experiencing accelerational g-forces. Enormous tidal forces, however, would be present near {{the edges of the}} flat-space volume because of the large space curvature there, but suitable specification of the metric would keep them very small within the volume occupied by the ship.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} be {{considered}} for use as a diamond simulant, a material must possess certain diamond-like properties. The most advanced artificial simulants have properties which closely approach diamond, but all simulants have one or more features that clearly and (for <b>those</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> diamond) easily differentiate them from diamond. To a gemologist, the most important of differential properties are those that foster non-destructive testing; most of these are visual in nature. Non-destructive testing is preferred because most suspected diamonds are already cut into gemstones and set in jewelry, and if a destructive test (which mostly relies on the relative fragility and softness of non-diamonds) fails, it may damage the simulant—an unacceptable outcome for most jewelry owners, as even if a stone is not a diamond, it may still be of value.|$|E
25|$|Ruby is said {{to follow}} the {{principle}} of least astonishment (POLA), meaning that the language should behave {{in such a way}} as to minimize confusion for experienced users. Matsumoto has said his primary design goal was to make a language that he himself enjoyed using, by minimizing programmer work and possible confusion. He has said that he had not applied the principle of least astonishment to the design of Ruby, but nevertheless the phrase has come to be closely associated with the Ruby programming language. The phrase has itself been a source of surprise, as novice users may take it to mean that Ruby's behaviors try to closely match behaviors familiar from other languages. In a May 2005 discussion on the newsgroup comp.lang.ruby, Matsumoto attempted to distance Ruby from POLA, explaining that because any design choice will be surprising to someone, he uses a personal standard in evaluating surprise. If that personal standard remains consistent, there would be few surprises for <b>those</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> the standard.|$|E
500|$|Engineers Country Club {{was founded}} in 1917 {{by a group of}} {{engineers}} from Manhattan. [...] The club features a bold course with titanic undulating green complexes and wide hole corridors built on terrain that at times slashes upward or cascades sharply downward to greens protected by dramatic bunkers. [...] Within those features are subtle touches that only <b>those</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> the course recognize: the well-placed roll in the fairway or the slight green contouring that sends putts in directions that seemingly defy the law of gravity.|$|E

Reki-jo are female otaku {{who are interested in}} Japanese history. Some terms refer to a location, such as Akiba-kei, a slang term meaning [...] "Akihabara-style" [...] which applies to <b>those</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> Akihabara's culture. Another is , a type of cheering that is part of Akiba-kei.

500|$|Many of <b>those</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> the {{subculture}} she described, {{including her}} own friends, disagreed with her portrayal of it; Romaine Brooks called her [...] "a digger-up of worms with the pretension of a distinguished archaeologist". Hall's correspondence {{shows that the}} negative view of bars like Alec's that she expressed in The Well was sincerely meant, but she also knew that such bars did not represent the only homosexual communities in Paris. It is a commonplace of criticism that her own experience of lesbian life was not as miserable as Stephen's. By focusing on misery and describing its cause as [...] "ceaseless persecution" [...] by [...] "the so-called just and righteous", she intensified the urgency of her plea for change.|$|E

A review in The American Scholar said that McLeod [...] "...delivers a lively, personal account of the ways intellectual property messes with people—and how he messes with intellectual property." [...] American Book Review said the work is [...] "a clever compendium of examples" [...] for <b>those</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> its subject matter. The Journal of Popular Culture called it [...] "an informative, thought-provoking, and occasionally laugh-out-loud funny examination of specific ways the privatization of ideas suppresses creativity in contemporary culture."
