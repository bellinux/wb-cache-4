500|$|During an interrogation, {{it becomes}} obvious that Marty, {{who is being}} uncooperative, {{possesses}} knowledge of the crimes that only the guilty party should know. Mulder decides to administer a polygraph while Scully looks over the crime scene. In the bathroom, Scully [...] discovers a leather glove hidden behind an old razor disposal bin. [...] Mulder, meanwhile, becomes convinced that Marty somehow did observe the murder. Suddenly, Marty experiences another vision: the murderer approaches a woman, Susan Forester, at a bar. In the vision, Marty is {{able to see the}} name of the bar. When her premonition ends, she requests to make a phone call; she calls the bar and warns a man named Gotts (Richard Fitzpatrick) to leave Forester alone. Later, Scully shows the glove to Marty, who informs her that her fingerprints were found on it and that it fits her. Pennock concludes that the evidence is enough to charge Marty, but Mulder still does not <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> it. Scully proposes that Marty may not be blind, and an eye examination is undertaken. During the test, Marty experiences another vision and Mulder points out that the measurement mode screen used to gauge whether Marty can see has a reaction. Despite this, the examiner concludes Marty is truly blind. Mulder, however, believes Marty's ocular reaction is a physical response to an image in her mind's eye. After the district attorney concludes that charging a blind woman solely based on fingerprints would not be enough to convict her, Marty is released.|$|E
2500|$|Two {{additional}} {{plans were}} added to Operation Freakout on April 13, 1976. The fourth plan called for Scientologist agents to gather information from Cooper so {{that the success of}} the first three plans could be assessed. The fifth plan was for a Scientologist to warn an Arab consulate by telephone that Paulette Cooper had been talking about bombing it. A sixth and final plan was added subsequently. It was effectively a re-run of the 1972 plot, requiring Scientologists to obtain Paulette Cooper's fingerprints on a blank piece of paper, type a threatening letter to Kissinger on that paper, and mail it. Guardian's Office staff member Bruce Raymond noted in an internal memo: [...] "This additional channel [...] should really have put her away. Worked with all the other channels. The F.B.I. already <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> the bomb threats on the C of S [...]" ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{regard to}} Callas's {{physical}} acting style, Nicola Rescigno states, [...] "Maria {{had a way}} of even transforming her body for the exigencies of a role, which is a great triumph. In La traviata, everything would slope down; everything indicated sickness, fatigue, softness. Her arms would move as if they had no bones, like the great ballerinas. In Medea, everything was angular. She'd never make a soft gesture; even the walk she used was like a tiger's walk." [...] Sandro Sequi recalls, [...] "She was never in a hurry. Everything was very paced, proportioned, classical, precise... She was extremely powerful but extremely stylized. Her gestures were not many... I don't <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> more than 20 gestures in a performance. But she was capable of standing 10 minutes without moving a hand or finger, compelling everyone to look at her." [...] Edward Downes recalled Callas watching and observing her colleagues with such intensity and concentration as to make it seem that the drama was all unfolding in her head. Sir Rudolf Bing similarly recalled that in Il trovatore in Chicago, [...] "it was Callas's quiet listening, rather than Björling's singing that made the dramatic impact... He didn't know what he was singing, but she knew." ...|$|E

2500|$|Gina Glocksen, a {{contestant}} of {{the sixth}} season of the reality show American Idol performed the song live. Talking about her cover of the song Lee said: [...] "It's such a surreal thing watching other people perform your songs in the first place, but people that you don't even know on TV doing 'American Idol' and Paula Abdul commenting on {{it is just a}} whole other thing. It was pretty hilarious, just 'cause it's our song, but I don't <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> a bad job." [...] Jim Cantiello of MTV News praised Glocksen's performance, saying that Glocksen [...] "could kick Amy Lee's butt in a cage match". DJ Nate, an American disc jockey, made a sped-up remix of the song in 2010 and included it on his album Da Trak Genious. On June 16, 2009, [...] "Bring Me to Life", [...] "Call Me When You're Sober" [...] and [...] "Weight of the World" [...] were included in the video game Rock Band as downloadable songs. The following year, the song was also included on the iOS game Rock Band Reloaded. [...] "Call Me When You're Sober" [...] was also used in the Nintendo DS soundtrack for the game Band Hero (2009).|$|E
