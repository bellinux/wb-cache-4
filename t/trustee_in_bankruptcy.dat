This defense was presented in four forms entitled respectively, demurrer, motion to quash, plea in abatement, and plea in bar. After motion by the Government that the defendant be required to elect which of the four he would stand upon he withdrew the last-mentioned two, and subsequently the court granted what was styled the motion to quash, ordered the indictment quashed and discharged the defendant without day. The Government brings this writ of error treating the so-called motion to quash as a plea in bar, which in substance it was.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the regulation of}} trades in listed securities by external administrators (EAs), such as <b>trustees</b> <b>in</b> <b>bankruptcy,</b> liquidators, receivers, and administrators {{on the basis of}} private information. We consider the economic policy issues associated with such trades. The principal considerations counsel in favour of taking a permissive approach. These are: the difficulties of associating trades with insider information, given the EA's necessarily short expected holding period, the asymmetric application of the insider trading prohibition to sales (rather than decisions not to sell), the market incentives not to misuse private information that apply to EAs, and the unlikelihood that the EA has monopolistic access to the information in question. We consider these considerations by reference to a number of hypothetical scenarios. The paper argues that the law should regulate the subject by coupling a broad exemption for EAs with a "goiod faith" proviso, a continuous disclosure obligation, and a requirement to sell "all or nothing" of a holding of listed securities...|$|R

In the course of his 1972 <b>bankruptcy</b> proceedings, <b>in</b> Wakefield, it emerged that Poulson had used, through one of his companies, the services of Reginald Maudling MP, a former Chancellor of the Exchequer, and at the time of Poulson's bankruptcy Home Secretary and Deputy Prime Minister in Edward Heath's government.
