5|$|Problems rose soon {{already in}} the summer of 1461, when Pavao Špirančić, who governed Croatia as ban on behalf of the Hungarian king and {{frequently}} clashed with King Thomas, seized a border town. By late summer, Stephen and Kosača were preparing to strike him jointly and divide his territory between themselves. Venice objected, fearing that the fortresses Klis and Ostrovica, paramount <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> of Dalmatia, might fall to the Ottomans if first taken over by the Bosnians.|$|E

5|$|The Compulsory Process Clause {{guarantees}} the defendant {{the right to}} obtain favorable witnesses at trial. For example, the Clause prevents a jurisdiction from precluding defendants from calling their codefendants as witnesses. Similarly, the Clause prevents the government from deporting a witness whose testimony would have been both material and favorable <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense.</b> The right does not pre-empt reasonable procedural rules. Thus, the right does not prevent the preclusion of defense witnesses as a discovery sanction.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese High Command {{believed}} that the raid had been conducted in preparation for an invasion of south China. In response, five additional infantry divisions were assigned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> of this area.

5|$|A strong {{relationship}} existed between Zahir and the Shia Muslim peasants of Jabal Amil and their sheikhs. Zahir maintained {{law and order}} in Jabal Amil, while leaving its mostly Shia inhabitants to their own devices. The Shia also benefited economically from Zahir's monopoly of the cotton industry and their sheikhs provided him men of great military skill to support his struggle against the Ottoman authorities. Zahir was a key backer of the Shia in their war with the Druze Jumblatt clan and the Shihab dynasty under Mulhim Shihab, and likewise, Shia forces were critical <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> of Zahir's sheikhdom against expeditions by the Ottoman governor of Damascus in 1771 and 1772.|$|E
5|$|Another blow to Soviet {{communism}} in the First World {{came with the}} establishment of eurocommunism. Eurocommunists espoused and supported the ideals of Soviet communism {{while at the same time}} supporting rights of the individual. The largest obstacle was that it was the largest communist parties, those with highest electoral turnout, which became eurocommunists. Originating with the Prague Spring, this new thinking made the First World more skeptical of Soviet {{communism in}} general. The Italian Communist Party notably declared that should war break out in Europe, they would rally <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> of Italy and resist any Soviet incursion on their nation's soil.|$|E
5|$|At Final Resolution, {{the team}} of Robert Roode and Ms. Brooks fought {{the team of}} Booker T and Sharmell.

After the encounter, Roode accidentally punched Sharmell in the face, resulting in a storyline fractured jaw which sidelined her from appearing for the promotion and upsetting her real-life husband Booker T. Following the event, Roode fired Brooks and higher her replacement Payton Banks on the January 10 episode of Impact!, setting up a match between the two at Against All Odds.

5|$|By {{the time}} of Stanley's {{election}} to the House, the American Tobacco Company had eliminated all its substantial competitors either by acquisition or by driving them out of business. The company worked with British tobacco manufacturers to set tobacco prices worldwide. Congressman Stanley came <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> of the tobacco farmers of his district, making him virtually unbeatable as a congressional candidate. In {{the first of his}} five consecutive terms, he authored a bill that would remove an oppressive national tobacco tax, hoping this would help raise prices for unprocessed tobacco. The bill was defeated by extensive lobbying efforts by the American Tobacco Company. In 1904, he convinced the Ways and Means Committee to hold public hearings on the American Tobacco Company's monopolistic actions, but the hearings did not convince legislators to repeal the tax nor take action against the American Tobacco Company.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the first}} expressways in Michigan predates the Interstate Highway System. During World War II, the Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) built the Willow Run and Detroit Industrial expressways (now part of I-94) to carry workers from Detroit <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> plants at Willow Run Airport. The state created the Michigan Turnpike Authority (MTA) in 1951, which {{proposed}} {{the construction of a}} toll freeway to run north–south in the state. The original termini for the Michigan Turnpike were Bridgeport and Rockwood. Interagency politics stalled progress on any proposed turnpikes while MSHD had three freeways under planning or construction.|$|E
5|$|Despite the pacts, the Soviet Union's fears continued. In {{a stance}} long held by Russian {{military}} theorists, {{control of the}} Baltic Sea was crucial <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> of St. Petersburg, Russia's second-largest city and the Baltic states offered a buffer zone between Russia and Germany. Pursuing this strategy, the Soviet Union initiated the Winter War in Finland after that country rejected a similar Moscow-offered mutual assistance treaty. Stalin was unnerved by German successes in Europe, since they had taken Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg by spring of 1940. According to Nikita Khrushchev, {{after the fall of}} France in May, Joseph Stalin expressed the concern that Adolf Hitler would 'beat our brains in'.|$|E

5|$|On 20 September, the 17th and 122nd French Colonial Divisions {{along with}} the 1st Serbian Army crossed river Crna.

On 21 September, the Allies became aware of the Bulgarian withdrawal after observing a series of fires and munition dump explosions on the Bulgarian positions, a pursuit by the British XII Corps was launched immediately. The Serbian advanced guard approached Krivolak, thus creating a wedge between the 1st Bulgarian and 11th German Armies in an effort to force the latter to retire towards Albania.
