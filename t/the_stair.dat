5|$|The tower, {{which was}} built around 1475, has three stages {{supported}} by diagonal buttresses. Its top is surmounted by a paneled parapet and an ornate crown with an elaborate spirelet over <b>the</b> <b>stair</b> turret, with two tiers of arcading.|$|E

5|$|At {{some point}} in the post-medieval period, the tower was {{deliberately}} damaged to put it beyond military use, a process called slighting. This probably occurred {{towards the end of the}} English Civil War, after the defeat of the Royalist forces in Kent at the Battle of Maidstone. The tower was then owned by Sir John Rayney of Wrotham Place, a Royalist, and would have been an effective lookout tower in any future conflict. There appears to have been an attempt to bring down the whole tower by damaging <b>the</b> <b>stair</b> turret at its base, possibly using gunpowder, which failed due to the spiral staircase's unusually strong design. After this the upper storey of the tower was carefully removed instead, leaving the building roofless.|$|E
5|$|Various {{studies of}} the tower took place from the late 18th century onwards. The {{antiquarian}} Francis Grose noted in 1783 that the tower was then called the Old Jail, recording a local tradition that the abbey had used the basement as a dungeon, and the upper storeys as a prison for lesser offences. During this period, the tower was used for drying and stowing hops, probably in advance of their being taken to local kilns. The artist J. M. W. Turner visited and sketched the tower around 1791. A group of French antiquarians visited in 1840, and commented on the considerable age of the building. Around 1863, {{a hole in the}} west wall, left by the attempted destruction of <b>the</b> <b>stair</b> turret, was filled with a new entrance way.|$|E
5|$|The central {{range was}} begun around 1500, {{possibly}} as a two-storey building containing a great hall, although only fragments {{of this building}} remain. The south entrance to the tower house was blocked up, and replaced with a ground floor entrance from the east. A new stair tower, with a broad spiral stair, was built at the south-east corner. Originally topped by a conical roof, this stair gave access to the upper floors in the tower, and to the central range. Around 1570, the 4th Earl of Morton rebuilt the block, extending it further south to form new apartments. This block, forming the present three-storey central range, includes a vaulted kitchen and cellar in the basement, with suites of rooms above. The two bedrooms {{on the first floor}} each have their own closets and garderobes, or privies. The west apartment is accessed from the terraced garden, via another stair to the south-west, and has a private stair which led up to another chamber above, suggesting that these were the Earl and Countesses apartments. The upper storey, whose timber floor is now missing, comprised three more apartments, including one over <b>the</b> <b>stair.</b> The exterior of the block is decorated with a horizontal decorative strip of masonry known as a string course. One first-floor window is decorated with carved stone pilasters and strapwork, in a similar style to windows at Edinburgh Castle and Drochil Castle, in the Borders, both of which were built under Morton's Regency.|$|E

25|$|The Endless Stair {{rose from}} the lowest dungeon of Moria to Durin's Tower at the summit of Celebdil. The Endless Stair was of such legendary status among Dwarves that some {{considered}} it mythical, but Gandalf confirmed its existence to Gimli when he recounted his battle with Durin's Bane (a balrog). Durin's Tower {{and the top of}} <b>the</b> <b>Stair</b> were destroyed in that struggle. The height of <b>the</b> <b>Stair</b> is not known, but Gandalf said that it climbed many thousands of steps in an unbroken spiral. <b>The</b> <b>Stair</b> was clearly of epic proportions, as it allowed Gandalf and the Balrog to ascend from one of Moria's lowest Deeps to the pinnacle of one of the tallest mountains in Middle-earth.|$|E

25|$|The teacher's {{house had}} three levels {{and apart from}} ornate {{external}} stone carving was similar in size and features to the workmen's cottages. The basement contained a storage cellar, pantry and space for a WC. As with the houses and school building it is not certain that any WC's were actually installed. The ground floor contained two living rooms, one with a sink, range and access to a private yard. An entrance hall opened to <b>the</b> <b>stair</b> hall. At the mezzanine landing of <b>the</b> <b>stair</b> was a door into the school corridor. On the first floor there were two bedrooms, each with a fireplace, and a smaller bedroom in the clock tower. Flues from the four fireplaces were carried to a single central chimney stack supported by an arch (hidden in the roof space) across <b>the</b> <b>stair</b> hall. This was unusual and expensive form of construction, but visually impressive.|$|E

25|$|In {{the final}} design <b>the</b> <b>stair</b> cores were moved {{near to the}} ends of the {{building}} to give views out on both the north and south façades. These, in conjunction with double-height galleries added to the top floor created a vertical rhythm to the façade. The number of recessed storeys was reduced to just one on the ground floor which gave the impression that the whole building was supported on the expressed columns. Verticality was further emphasised with the proportions of the windows which were slender and divided by precast concrete mullions. <b>The</b> <b>stair</b> towers have been compared with those of Charles Rennie Mackintosh at the western end of the Glasgow School of Art.|$|E
