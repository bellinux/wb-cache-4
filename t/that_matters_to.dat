500|$|West {{received}} similar {{approval from}} Lil Wayne and Young Jeezy, {{both of whom}} contributed to the album. During an interview, when asked what music today inspires him, Wayne stated [...] "everybody's doing their thing, but they're not exciting. Everybody {{is doing the same}} thing. That's terrible. Do I love the music that's out right now? I love it with a passion. Does it motivate me? Not one bit. That's because 808s & Heartbreak isn't out yet." [...] Despite the approval from the rap superstars, as well as the record-breaking chart performances of the first two singles, hip hop audiences remained indifferent towards the album, predicting it would flop. Responding to reviews, West stated that he didn't care about sales or getting good ratings, saying that it came from the heart and that's all <b>that</b> <b>matters</b> <b>to</b> him. When asked about the current state of hip hop, West compared it to a high school, stating that hip hop used to be all about being fearless and standing out, and that now it is about being afraid and fitting in. Michael Jackson was an admirer of the album, with his daughter saying he played it for her [...] "all the time".|$|E
500|$|AVCO Embassy Pictures, the film's {{financial}} backer, preferred either Charles Bronson or Tommy Lee Jones to {{play the}} role of Snake Plissken to Carpenter's choice of Kurt Russell, who was trying to overcome the [...] "lightweight" [...] screen image conveyed by his roles in several Disney comedies. Carpenter refused to cast Bronson on the grounds that he was too old, and because he worried that he could lose directorial control over the picture with an experienced actor. At the time, Russell described his character as [...] "a mercenary, and his style of fighting is a combination of Bruce Lee, The Exterminator, and Darth Vader, with Eastwood's vocal-ness." [...] All <b>that</b> <b>matters</b> <b>to</b> Snake, according to the actor, is [...] "the next 60 seconds. Living for exactly that next minute is all there is." [...] Russell used a rigorous diet and exercise program in order to develop a lean and muscular build. He also endeavored to stay in character between takes and throughout the shooting, as he welcomed the opportunity to get away from the Disney comedies he had done previously. He did find it necessary to remove the eyepatch between takes, as wearing it constantly seriously affected his depth perception.|$|E

500|$|The band members' {{main goal}} was to reinvent the group's sound from scratch, {{creating}} what Trohman called a [...] "reimagining of the band," [...] which focuses more on pop. Sessions were not without difficulties, as the band struggled initially to produce new material. Walker had doubts about the band's volatility, feeling the record would not get made following [...] "meltdown after meltdown." [...] The entire album was recorded in secrecy from the music industry, critics, and fans of the band. While specifically denying that the group's announcement was a reunion because [...] " [...] never broke up", the band announced a reunion tour and details of Save Rock and Roll on February 4, 2013. The quartet's announcement included {{a photo of the}} group that had been taken earlier that morning of the band members huddled around a bonfire tossing copies of their back catalog into flames at the original location of Comiskey Park, the location of 1979's Disco Demolition Night, a baseball promotional event which involved destroying disco records. A message on the group's website read [...] "when we were kids the only thing that got us through most days was music. It's why we started Fall Out Boy in the first place. This isn't a reunion because we never broke up. We needed to plug back in and make some music <b>that</b> <b>matters</b> <b>to</b> us. The future of Fall Out Boy starts now. Save rock and roll..." [...] Save Rock and Roll debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart, with first week sales of 154,000 copies in the United States, according to Nielsen SoundScan. The arrival of Save Rock and Roll posted the quartet's third-biggest sales week, and earned the group's second career number one on the chart. The band's chart success was best described as unexpected by music journalists. Rolling Stone called the band's comeback a [...] "rather stunning renaissance", and Entertainment Weekly called the number one a [...] "major accomplishment for a band whom many in the industry had dismissed as kings of a genre whose time had passed." ...|$|E

2500|$|Twisted Pixel {{stated that}} their desire {{was to keep}} the game {{character}} driven. CEO Micheal Wilford stated [...] "Everything is character based. The thing <b>that</b> <b>matters</b> <b>to</b> us is that hopefully there's a memorable character that makes you laugh, cause no one makes games like that anymore. One {{of the ways in which}} they do this is with pop culture references. For example, the controller is kept idle long enough Ms. Splosion Man will do the Macarena, a popular dance from the 1990s. Additionally the character will quote movies and other references as the player navigates through levels.|$|E

Joe Lamond, president of the National Association of Music Manufacturers (NAMM) attributes the increase to a growth of home music-making by adults approaching retirement.

[...] For the scene where Duke hallucinates a lounge full of lizards, the production was supposed to have 25 animatronic reptiles but they only received seven or eight.

2500|$|In {{the winter}} of 1858, Li was reassigned to serve in Zeng Guofan's office, where {{he was in charge}} of {{drafting}} documents. Li led a carefree life, flouted rules and regulations, and often woke up late. Zeng Guofan once chided him, [...] "Shaoquan, now that you're working in my office, I only have this piece of advice for you: 'Commitment' is the only thing <b>that</b> <b>matters</b> <b>to</b> us here." [...] Li was shocked and he improved his behaviour after that. In the same year, Weng Tongshu (翁同書), the xunfu of Anhui, abandoned his post when he came under attack by the Taiping rebels. Zeng Guofan drew from Li's draft when he wrote a memorial to the imperial court to accuse Weng Tongshu of failing in his duty. The lines from Li's draft that were included in Zeng Guofan's actual memorial included: [...] "It is my duty, as Your Majesty's subject, [...] I do not dare to let this pass just because of Weng Tonghe's fame and prestige." [...] Although Li earned Zeng Guofan's praise for drafting the memorial, he also caused Weng Tonghe (Weng Tongshu's brother) to bear a grudge against him for what he wrote. While serving under Zeng Guofan, he was put in charge of Yanjianshao Circuit (延建邵道) in Fujian Province but did not take up his appointment and remained with Zeng.|$|E

In the finale, Laurie and Travis face a breakup after arguing about their future, before Travis confides that the only future <b>that</b> <b>matters</b> <b>to</b> him is one with Laurie in it.
