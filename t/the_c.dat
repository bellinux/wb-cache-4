5|$|Establishment of <b>the</b> <b>C</b> made Everglades National Park {{completely}} {{dependent upon}} another political entity for its survival. One of the C's projects was Levee 29, laid along the Tamiami Trail {{on the northern}} border of the park. Levee 29 featured four flood control gates that controlled all the water entering Everglades National Park; before construction, water flowed in through open drain pipes. The period from 1962 to 1965 was one of drought for the Everglades, and Levee 29 remained closed to allow the Biscayne Aquifer—the fresh water source for South Florida—to stay filled. Animals began to cross Tamiami Trail for the water held in WCA 3, and many were killed by cars. Biologists estimate the population of alligators in Everglades National Park was halved; otters nearly became extinct. The populations of wading birds had been reduced by 90percent from the 1940s. When park management and the U.S. Department of the Interior asked <b>the</b> <b>C</b> for assistance, <b>the</b> <b>C</b> offered to build a levee along the southern border of Everglades National Park to retain waters that historically flowed through the mangroves and into Florida Bay.

The charge transfer from <b>Cs</b> to <b>the</b> InP substrate is observed from <b>the</b> <b>Cs</b> induced In 4 d and P 2 p components, and this charge transfer results in surface dipole formation and lowering {{of the work}} function. <b>The</b> <b>Cs</b> 4 d intensity saturates at coverage of one monolayer (ML). However, a break point is observed at 0. 5 ML, which coincides with {{the achievement of the}} minimum work function. This break point is due to the different vertical placement of the first and the second half monolayer of Cs atoms. Based on this information, a simple bi-layer structure for <b>the</b> <b>Cs</b> layer is presented. This bi-layer structure is consistent with the behavior of the charge transfer from <b>the</b> <b>Cs</b> to <b>the</b> InP substrate at different Cs coverages. This, in turn, explains why the work function decreases to a minimum at 0. 5 ML of Cs and remains almost constant beyond this coverage. The depolarization of the surface dipoles is attributed to the saturation of charge transfer to the surface In atoms and the polarization of <b>the</b> <b>Cs</b> atoms in <b>the</b> second half monolayer induced by <b>the</b> positively charged <b>Cs</b> atoms in <b>the</b> first half monolayer...|$|R
