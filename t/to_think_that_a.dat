25|$|When Louis XVI {{swore to}} observe the {{constitution}} of September 1791, the emperor professed <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> settlement had been reached in France. The attacks {{on the rights of}} the German princes on the left bank of the Rhine, and the increasing violence of the parties in Paris which were agitating to bring about war, soon showed, however, that this hope was vain. Leopold meant to meet the challenge of the revolutionists in France with dignity and temper, however the effect of the Declaration of Pillnitz was to contribute to the radicalization of their political movement.|$|E
25|$|The same {{criticism}} {{is even more}} emphatically applicable {{to the influence of}} a not-self, or world of forces, corresponding to our sensations, and the cause of them. Starting from sensation as our basis, causality could never give us this, even though it be allowed that sensation is impersonal to the extent of being independent of our volition. Causality might tell us that a cause there is of sensation somewhere and of some sort; but that this cause is a force or sum of forces, existing in space, independently of us, and corresponding to our sensations, it could never tell us, {{for the simple reason that}} such a notion is not supposed to exist in our consciousness. Causality cannot add to the number of our notions,--cannot add to the number of realities we know. All it can do is to necessitate us <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> cause there is of a given change, but what that cause is it cannot of itself inform us, or even suggest to us, beyond implying that it must be to the effect. Sensation might arise, for aught we know, so far as causality leads us, not from a world of forces at all, but from a will like our own, though infinitely more powerful, acting upon us, partly furthering and partly thwarting us. And indeed such a supposition is, with the principle of causality at work, within the limits of probability, as we are already supposed to know such a reality—a will—in our own consciousness. When Cousin thus set himself to vindicate those points by reflection, he gave up the obvious advantage of his other position that the realities in question are given us in immediate and spontaneous apprehension. The same criticism applies equally to the inference of an absolute cause from the two limited forces which he names self and not-self. Immediate spontaneous apperception may seize this supreme reality; but to vindicate it by reflection as an inference on the principle of causality is impossible. This is a mere paralogism; we can never infer either absolute or infinite from relative or finite.|$|E
25|$|Paeonia daurica {{was first}} {{described}} by Henry Charles Andrews {{in the seventh}} volume of his Botanist's Repository published in 1807. A yellow flowered Paeonia species from Abkhazia was collected by C.M. Worontzoff, and described in 1846 by John Lindley, who named it P.wittmanniana Lindl.. In 1848 Christian von Steven described another taxon with yellow petals under the same specific name P.wittmanniana Steven. It had been collected at Atskhu, Meskheti Province, in Georgia. Pierre Edmond Boissier made descriptions of three taxa in this complex in 1869: P.corallina and P.corallina var. triternata, and P.wittmanniana Steven. Franz Josef Ruprecht in 1869, distinguished P.triternata f. coriifolia. In 1892 Ernst Huth distinguished between P.corallina var. typica with entire leaflets and red petals, and P.wittmanniana with lobed leaflets and yellow petals. Russian botanist Nikolai Michailowitsch Albow was the first <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> difference only in petal colour does not merit distinguishing species, and he reduced P.wittmanniana to P.corallina var. wittmanniana, under which he described a new form, f. macrophylla. Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Lomakin recognized four species in this group in 1897: P.corallina, P.mlokosewitschii, P.macrophylla, P.wittmanniana, and introduced P.wittmanniana var. tomentosa. In 1899, Vladimir Ippolitovich Lipsky mostly supported the ideas of Lomakin, but distinguished between P.triternata and P.corallina. In 1901, Nikolai Busch recognized P.corallina subsp. triternata, its variety coriifolia (Rupr.), P.wittmanniana f. macrophylla and subsp. tomentosa, and P.mlokosewitschii. Alexander Grossheim distinguished in 1930 seven taxa that differed in the colour of the petals, the shape and number of leaflets, and the hairiness of the leaflets and fruits, so recognizing P.corallina var. caucasica and var. coriifolia, P.mlokosewitschii, P.wittmanniana and its var. macrophylla, P.tomentosa and the new P.abchasica. Nikolai Schipczinsky in the Flora of the USSR (1937) distinguished between P.mlokosewitschii - {{as part of the}} series Obovatae having orbicular, ovate or rarely pointed leaflets - and P.triternata, P.caucasica, P.wittmanniana, P.macrophylla, P.tomentosa and P.abchasica - all having rather wide, pointed leaflets – assigning them to the series Corallinae. Frederick Claude Stern in his book A study of the genus Paeonia recognized in his subsection Foliolatae the species P.daurica, P.mlokosewitschii and P.wittmanniana, the latter with four varieties. In 1950 Grossgeim revised his view from 1930 and recognized P.kavachensis (= P.caucasica), P.mlokosewitschii (including P.tomentosa) and P.wittmanniana (including P.abchasica). P.wittmanniana Steven was renamed to P.steveniana by the Georgian botanist Kemularia-Nathadze in 1961, who recognized all previous taxa except P.abchasica in addition to describing a new species named P.ruprechtiana. In 2010 D.Y. Hong revised the genus Paeonia, recognising seven subspecies in P. daurica, among which the new subsp. velebitensis.|$|E

500|$|The 1850s and 1860s also {{mark the}} line between what some {{scholars}} see as the idealistic, Hegelian young Marx from the more scientifically minded mature Marx writings of the later period. This distinction is usually associated with the structural Marxism school and not all scholars agree that it exists. The years of revolution from 1848 to 1849 had been a grand experience for both Marx and Engels. They both became sure that their economic view of {{the course of history}} was the only valid way that historic events like the revolutionary upsurge of 1848 could be adequately explained. For some time after 1848, Marx and Engels wondered if the entire revolutionary upsurge had completely played out. As time passed, they began <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> new revolutionary upsurge would not occur until there was another economic downturn.

500|$|In the essay, Carr {{introduces}} {{the discussion of}} the scientific support for the idea that the brain's neural circuitry can be rewired with an example in which philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche {{is said to have been}} influenced by technology. According to German scholar Friedrich A. Kittler in his book Gramophone, Film, Typewriter, Nietzsche's writing style became more aphoristic after he started using a typewriter. Nietzsche began using a Malling-Hansen Writing Ball because of his failing eyesight which had disabled his ability to write by hand. The idea that Nietzsche's writing style had changed for better or worse when he adopted the typewriter was disputed by several critics. Kevin Kelly and Scott Esposito each offered alternate explanations for the apparent changes. Esposito believed that [...] "the brain is so huge and amazing and enormously complex that it's far, far off base <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> few years of Internet media or the acquisition of a typewriter can fundamentally rewire it." [...] In a response to Esposito's point, neuroscientist James Olds stated that recent brain research demonstrated that it was [...] "pretty clear that the adult brain can re-wire on the fly". In The New York Times it was reported that several scientists believed that it was certainly plausible that the brain's neural circuitry may be shaped differently by regular Internet usage compared with the reading of printed works.|$|E

Taking inspiration from the more anguished works of Haydn and Mozart, such as Haydn's Sturm und Drang and later Paris Symphonies of 1785–86 and Mozart's Symphony No. 40 (K.550, 1788), it was revived in one of Felix Mendelssohn's concerts with the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra in 1838 and 1846 to an audience including Robert Schumann, who was impressed by the piece. (At the time of writing, only Beethoven's Symphonies No.1 and 2 [...] had been performed in France.) His other symphonies also followed German and Austrian models. Commenting after the premiere of his first symphony, he noted: [...] "I understood all the dangers of my enterprise; I foresaw the cautious welcome that the music-lovers would give my symphonies.
