[...] Alexis Petridis from The Guardian said that the song [...] "seems to be bending over backwards to annoy the listener. Perhaps it's a last desperate tactic to win back some privacy: she's <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>people</b> to leave her alone by making as irritating a noise as possible."

[...] "I still regret we did not succeed", he said in October 2007. In 2007, McCain voted against legislation that would have used a 61-cents-per-pack tax to expand a children's health program, saying that he disagreed with the concept: [...] "We are <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>people</b> not to smoke, and yet we are depending on tobacco to fund a program that's designed for children's health?"

2500|$|Despite the group's successes, {{there has}} been {{criticism}} of PETA from both the conservative and radical ends of the animal rights movement. Michael Specter writes that it provides for {{groups such as the}} Humane Society of the United States the same dynamic that Malcolm X provided for Martin Luther King, or Andrea Dworkin for Gloria Steinem—someone radical to alienate the mainstream and make moderate voices more appealing. The failure to condemn the Animal Liberation Front triggers complaints from the conservatives, while the more radical activists say the group has lost touch with its grassroots, is soft on the idea of animal rights, and that it should stop the media stunts, the pie-throwing, and the use of nudity. [...] "It's hard enough <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>people</b> to take animal rights seriously without PETA out there acting like a bunch of jerks," [...] one activist told writer Norm Phelps. However, Phelps continued: [...] "But it's hard to argue with success, and PETA is far and away the most successful cutting-edge animal rights organization in the world, in terms of both membership and spreading the animal rights message to the public at large." ...|$|E

2500|$|Many {{commentators}} {{have said that}} the harassment associated with Gamergate springs from this existing well of deep-seated misogyny, and that it was merely brought to the fore by the anonymity of the Internet. Regarding the false allegations against Quinn, Amanda Marcotte in an article for The Daily Beast accused the video game world of being [...] "thick with misogynists who are aching to swarm" [...] with hate on any [...] "random woman held up for them to hate, no matter what the pretext". She related these attacks to harassment sent to a woman who criticized a Teen Titans cover and to a community manager of the Mighty No. 9 game because she drew a feminine Mega Man, and virtual rapes committed against women's player avatars in Grand Theft Auto V and DayZ. In an interview with the BBC, Quinn stated that [...] "Before [...] had a name, it was nothing but {{trying to get me to}} kill myself, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>people</b> to hurt me, going after my family. ... There is no mention of ethics in journalism at all outside of making the same accusation everybody makes towards any successful woman; that clearly she got to where she is because she had sex with someone." [...] Danielle Citron of the University of Maryland wrote that the intent of this type of harassment is to demean the victim, make them doubt their own integrity, and to redefine the victim's identity in order to [...] "fundamentally distort who she is".|$|E

The vinyl labels contained only the title and [...] "120 bpm". Two repressings followed in 1987, both having a test tone groove B-side, with copies supplied in either a generic KLF Communications sleeve or a plain black sleeve. The single did not enter the UK Singles Chart, but it reached # 3 in the UK independent chart, prompting the UK television programme [...] "The Chart Show" [...] to request a music video. [...] The JAMs obliged, hiring a video camera and getting a friend to film them driving to [...] "The Chart Show" [...] studio in Cauty's repainted Ford Galaxie American police car. [...] According to Drummond, [...] "When we got there, we took out the cassette, handed it in at the gate and said 'that's your video'! The next day it was on national TV. It cost us £19.96". [...] Flippantly, he concluded [...] "Most record companies spend up to 100 grand on their vids and almost as much on lunches <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>people</b> to screen them." [...] The video was remembered in 1991 by NME, who thought that [...] The KLF's VHS compilation The Stadium House Trilogy would have benefitted from {{the inclusion of the}} [...] "pre-megastardom" [...] video. The song features on neither of The JAMs' studio albums, but is included on the duo's 1988 compilation and remix album Shag Times, where co-authorship credit is given to composers of works sampled in the track. [...] Shag Times also contains an instrumental remix of the song, credited to The KLF.|$|E
2500|$|The {{design was}} {{developed}} for the RNLI by J.A. MacLachlan working for naval architects G.L. Watson of Glasgow. Initially proposed with 'chines' along the hull to disperse the spray and improve stability when underway at speed, this caused a high deck above water which proved difficult when <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>people</b> aboard from the water, so the chines were dispensed with on the second boat and the deck curved down nearer the water. The first three boats were built with wooden hulls and were respectively , [...] and [...] long, the extra length due to a rounded transom. All differed in superstructure design, 52-01 having a raked back superstructure front with the flying bridge at the after end. 52-02 introduced forward raked wheelhouse windscreens, had a unique wheelhouse side window pattern and retained the aft mounted flying bridge. On 52-03, the flying bridge {{was moved to the}} forward end of the wheelhouse, the front of which was rounded. From 54-04, the forward flying bridge was standardised and the forward raked wheelhouse windscreens were reintroduced. The side windows were recessed from the superstructure sides. 54-04 had a Glass Reinforce Plastic hull and this was standardised for future boats. 54-04 to 54-07 retained the rounded transon but from 52-08 a square transom was reintroduced. The final external change came with 52-11 which had flush sided forward wheelhouse windows and this was a feature of all subsequent boats.In 1986 52-030 (ON 1100) became the only steel hulled Arun. It was regarded as the best of the class for seakeeping, although the slowest. The GRP hulls were moulded in blue material in the outer skin. After a while it was found that water was accumulating in the fibreglass which added up to 2 tons to the weight. The boats had the coloured layer stripped off and replaced by a new one made with clear gel which reduced the amount of water absorbed.|$|E

60|$|This was in 361, {{and without}} going to Rome Julian hastened on to Constantinople, where he was {{received}} as Emperor. He no longer pretended to be a Christian, but had all the old heathen temples opened again, and the sacrifices performed as in old times, {{though it was not}} easy to find any one who recollected how they were carried on. He said that all forms of religion should be free to every one, but he himself tried to live like an ancient philosopher, getting rid of all the pomp of jewels, robes, courtiers, and slaves who had attended Constantius, wearing simply the old purple garb of a Roman general, sleeping on a lion's skin, and living on the plainest food. Meantime, he tried to put down the Christian faith by laughing at it, and <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>people</b> to despise it as something low and mean. When this did not succeed, he forbade Christians to be schoolmasters or teachers; and as they declared that the ruin of the Temple of Jerusalem proved our Lord to have been a true Prophet, he commanded that it should be rebuilt. As soon as the foundations were dug, there was an outburst of fiery smoke and balls of flame which forced the workmen to leave off. Such things sometimes happen when long-buried ruins are opened, from the gases that have formed there; but it was no doubt the work of God's providence, and the Christians held it as a miracle.|$|E

60|$|Perhaps {{it would}} take the form of sudden dispersal—a frightened sauve qui peut, a scuttling into selfish corners. Certainly they were less elastic than of yore; they were evidently looking for {{something}} they didn’t find. The Dorringtons hadn’t re-appeared, the princes had scattered; wasn’t that the beginning of the end? Mrs. Moreen had lost her reckoning of the famous “days”; her social calendar was blurred—it had turned its face to the wall. Pemberton suspected that the great, the cruel discomfiture had been the unspeakable behaviour of Mr. Granger, who seemed not to know what he wanted, or, what was much worse, what they wanted. He kept sending flowers, as if to bestrew the path of his retreat, which was never the path of a return. Flowers were all very well, but—Pemberton could complete the proposition. It was now positively conspicuous {{that in the long run}} the Moreens were a social failure; so that the young man was almost grateful the run had not been short. Mr. Moreen indeed was still occasionally able to get away on business and, what was more surprising, was likewise able to get back. Ulick had no club but you couldn’t have discovered it from his appearance, which was as much as ever that of a person looking at life from the window of such an institution; therefore Pemberton was doubly surprised at an answer he once heard him make his mother in the desperate tone of a man familiar with the worst privations. Her question Pemberton had not quite caught; it appeared to be an appeal for a suggestion as to whom they might get to take Amy. “Let the Devil take her!” Ulick snapped; so that Pemberton could see that they had not only lost their amiability but had ceased to believe in themselves. He could also see that if Mrs. Moreen was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>people</b> to take her children she might be regarded as closing the hatches for the storm.
