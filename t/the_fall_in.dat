5|$|By {{the late}} 1940s, demand for pennies was falling in Britain, {{likely due to}} the {{popularity}} of the lighter, more convenient, brass threepence coin. which weighed {{less than a quarter of}} the same value in bronze coins. The immediate aftermath of the war had seen a strong demand for pennies until January 1949, when it dropped off, and in May of that year, the Royal Mint stopped the coin's production. Officials concluded that <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>in</b> demand was permanent due to inflation; its purchasing power was minimal, and many automatic machines no longer took it. The Royal Mint redeemed surplus coppers from the banks for melting beginning in 1951, and by the end of the decade, some £1.2 million worth had been removed from circulation.|$|E
5|$|In HIT, the {{platelet}} {{count in the}} blood falls below the normal range, a condition called thrombocytopenia. However, it is generally not low enough to lead to {{an increased risk of}} bleeding. Most people with HIT will therefore not experience any symptoms. Typically the {{platelet count}} will fall 5–14 days after heparin is first given; if someone has received heparin in the previous three months, <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>in</b> platelet count may occur sooner, sometimes within a day.|$|E
5|$|K'ak' Joplaj Chan K'awiil was {{installed}} as the 14th dynastic ruler of Copán on 7June 738, 39days after {{the execution of}} Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil. Little is known of his reign {{due to the lack}} of monuments raised after Quiriguá's surprise victory. Copán's defeat had wider implications due to the fracturing of the city's domain and the loss of the key Motagua River trade route to Quiriguá. <b>The</b> <b>fall</b> <b>in</b> Copán's income and corresponding increase at Quiriguá is evident from the massive commissioning of new monuments and architecture at the latter city, and Copán may even have been subject to its former vassal. K'ak' Joplaj Chan K'awiil died in January749.|$|E

5|$|The 1637 {{event was}} popularized in 1841 {{by the book}} Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds, written by British {{journalist}} Charles Mackay. At one point 12 acres (5 ha) of land were offered for a Semper Augustus bulb. Mackay claims that many such investors were ruined by <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>in</b> prices, and Dutch commerce suffered a severe shock. Although Mackay's book is a classic, his account is contested. Many modern scholars feel that the mania was not as extraordinary as Mackay described and argue that not enough price data are available to prove that a tulip bulb bubble actually occurred.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} is a table outlining the population change of the town since 1801, which demonstrates a trend of slow population growth in the 19th century and more rapid growth in the 20th century. In particular over the past 40 years, in which the population of Northallerton has more than doubled. <b>The</b> <b>fall</b> <b>in</b> population between 1851 and 1871 {{has been attributed to}} the collapse in coaching as the railways became popular.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of woodpeckers are sedentary {{but there are}} a few examples of migratory species such as the rufous-bellied woodpecker and yellow-bellied sapsucker, and the Eurasian wryneck breeds in Europe and west Asia and migrates to the Sahel in Africa in the winter. More northerly populations of Lewis's woodpecker, northern flicker, Williamson's sapsucker, red-breasted sapsucker and red-naped sapsucker all move southwards in <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>in</b> North America. Most woodpecker movements can be described as dispersive, such as when young birds seek territories after fledging, or eruptive, to escape harsh weather conditions. Several species are altitudinal migrants, for example the grey-capped woodpecker, which moves to lowlands from hills during the winter months. The woodpeckers that do migrate do so during the day.|$|E

5|$|The {{population}} of Ireland collapsed dramatically {{during the second}} half of the 19th century. A {{population of}} over 8 million in 1841 was reduced to slightly more than 4 million by 1921. In part, <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>in</b> population was due to death from the Great Famine of 1845 to 1852, which took about 1 million lives. However, by far the greater cause of population decline was the dire economic state of the country which led to an entrenched culture of emigration lasting until the 21st century.|$|E
5|$|The traffic {{projections}} for the bridge {{at the planning stage}} {{have not been}} achieved. A traffic survey carried out for a week during June 2012 recorded traffic of 29,000 vehicles over the bridge in comparison to a projected 85,000. A survey conducted during the same period in June 2012 indicated a figure of 31,865 vehicles, though it is reported by the concerned traffic and transportation engineer that the rate of increase in traffic has been one percent per year on the basis of traffic surveys carried out from the time of commissioning of the bridge. The reason for <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>in</b> traffic during 2012 is attributed to the peak monsoon effect during the survey period.|$|E
5|$|While {{reduction}} of sodium intake {{to less than}} 2,300mg per day is recommended by developed countries, one review recommended that sodium intake be reduced to at least 1,200mg (contained in 3g of salt) per day, as a further reduction in salt intake the greater <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>in</b> systolic blood pressure for all age groups and ethinicities. Another review indicated that there is inconsistent/insufficient evidence to conclude that reducing sodium intake to lower than 2,300mg per day is either beneficial or harmful.|$|E

5|$|BART {{ridership}} {{has grown}} rapidly since 2010, mirroring strong {{economic growth in}} the Bay Area. In 2015, the system was carrying approximately 100,000 more passengers each day than it had five years earlier. High gasoline prices also contributed to growth, pushing ridership to record levels during 2012, with the system recording five record ridership days in September and October 2012. During the fiscal year ending June 30, 2017, BART recorded an average weekday ridership of 423,395, the second-highest in its history, but a 2.3% drop from 2016. Ridership growth began to slow in late 2016, and dropped by 1.7% in October 2016 from the prior year. The line to the San Francisco International Airport lost riders, while ride-sharing services such as Uber and Lyft grew by a factor of almost six or nearly 500% at the airport during 2014–2016. BART planners believe that competition from Uber and Lyft is reducing overall ridership growth and BART's share of SFO airport transit. Some see the decline in transit use in large U.S. cities as part of a national trend, linked to changes in commute patterns, <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>in</b> gasoline prices since 2014, and competition from the private sector in the form of ride-sharing services.|$|E
5|$|In South America, {{especially}} in Patagonia, {{there is an}} active modern sheep industry. Sheep keeping was largely introduced through immigration to the continent by Spanish and British peoples, for whom sheep were a major industry during the period. South America has {{a large number of}} sheep, but the highest-producing nation (Brazil) kept only just over 15 million head in 2004, far fewer than most centers of sheep husbandry. The primary challenges to the sheep industry in South America are the phenomenal drop in wool prices in the late 20th century and the loss of habitat through logging and overgrazing. The most influential region internationally is that of Patagonia, which has been the first to rebound from <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>in</b> wool prices. With few predators and almost no grazing competition (the only large native grazing mammal is the guanaco), the region is prime land for sheep raising. The most exceptional area of production is surrounding the La Plata river in the Pampas region. Sheep production in Patagonia peaked in 1952 at more than 21 million head, but has steadily fallen to fewer than ten today. Most operations focus on wool production for export from Merino and Corriedale sheep; the economic sustainability of wool flocks has fallen with the drop in prices, while the cattle industry continues to grow.|$|E
5|$|In {{his later}} career, McMahon faced such wrestlers as Sorakichi Matsuda, Captain James C. Daly and Gus Lambert. He also faced William Muldoon, now {{a member of}} the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame. One match between the two, which took place on March 22, 1881, {{featured}} a best-of-three-falls rule, in which the wrestlers competed in Muldoon's favored Greco-Roman style, followed by the collar-and-elbow style preferred by McMahon. Each competitor won <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>in</b> his preferred style, which led to a catch-as-catch-can match to determine the winner. The match did not take place, however, as the men were unable to agree to the outfits that would be worn during the match; as a result, the contest was declared a draw. One of McMahon's final series of matches was against Henry Moses Dufur. Their first match was declared a draw after neither competitor was able to throw the other within six hours. Although the wrestlers were willing to continue, the lease on the hall had expired and the match was ended at 2:45 in the morning. McMahon lost the second contest, but he defeated Dufur for the world collar-and-elbow championship in their final encounter.|$|E

5|$|Odex {{blamed the}} {{approximate}} 70% fall in its Video CD (VCD) and Digital Video Disc (DVD) sales in 2006 and 2007 on illegal downloading. The response of anime fans was that <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>in</b> sales was because Odex's products were inferior, inaccurately translated, and released {{later than the}} online versions. Odex subsequently attributed the inaccurate subtitling on censorship laws against mature themes (such as yaoi) and on fansubbers—anime fans who had translated the Japanese dialogue—whom they had hired. In response, the Board of Film Censors said {{that it did not}} ask for subtitles to be changed, that it merely classified content, and that the onus was on distributors to ensure accurate subtitles. In addition to problems of quality and scheduling, criticisms were directed at Odex's litigious strategy and poor public relations. Odex received support from the Anti Video Piracy Association of Singapore (AVPAS) in making its demands for compensation.|$|E
5|$|The First World War had {{a severe}} effect on Stanford. He was frightened by air-raids, {{and had to}} move from London to Windsor to avoid them. Many of his former pupils were {{casualties}} of the fighting, including Arthur Bliss, wounded, Ivor Gurney, gassed, and George Butterworth, killed. The annual RCM operatic production, which Stanford had supervised and conducted every year since 1885, had to be cancelled. His income declined, as <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>in</b> student numbers at the college reduced the demand for his services. After a serious disagreement {{at the end of}} 1916, his relationship with Parry deteriorated to the point of hostility. Stanford's magnanimity, however, came to the fore when Parry died two years later and Stanford successfully lobbied for him to be buried in St Paul's Cathedral.|$|E
5|$|The {{increases}} of the 1630s corresponded with {{a lull in}} the Thirty Years' War. In 1634/5 the German and Swedish armies lost ground in the South of Germany; then Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand of Austria moved north. After the Peace of Prague (1635) the French (and the Dutch) decided to support the Swedish and German protestants with money and arms against the Habsburg empire, and to occupy the Spanish Netherlands in 1636. Hence market prices (at least initially) were responding rationally to a rise in demand. However, <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>in</b> prices was faster and more dramatic than the rise. Data on sales largely disappeared after the February 1637 collapse in prices, but a few other data points on bulb prices after tulip mania show that bulbs continued to lose value for decades thereafter.|$|E

5|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) celebrates his winning of the Vice President {{position}} on a golf outing with Jim Halpert (John Krasinski), Robert California (James Spader), and Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate). After playing, Robert tells Jim that he dislikes the business plan for the Sabre store, citing the poor quality of the products; he only approved it because Jo Bennett wanted it, but he plans to sandbag it at a high-level meeting, and Jim is stunned when Robert strongly hints {{he is going to}} fire Dwight over it. Jim makes several attempts to stop Dwight from attending the meeting with Robert, but Dwight is heedless and continually insults Jim, who finally decides to leave Dwight to his fate. However, a guilt-inducing phone call to Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) makes Jim decide he has to keep parsing Dwight's insults until he directly tells him {{that he is going to}} lose his job. Dwight ignores the news, thinking Jim is jealous of him, so Jim resorts to wrestling with Dwight outside the conference room. In the meantime, Nellie has Todd Packer (David Koechner) stand in as VP in Dwight's absence. When Dwight makes it into the conference room, he hears Robert planning to fire the VP, so he sneaks out of the conference room and lets Packer take <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>in</b> front of those present. Dwight then silently extends a hand to Jim, and they head back to Scranton with Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker), who has reverted to his old grumpy self over the thought of leaving Florida.|$|E
