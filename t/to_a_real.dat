5|$|Following {{the death}} of Louis in 1979, the Horch family sold the Master Building <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> estate investor, Sol Goldman, {{who was then the}} city's largest private landlord. Goldman {{continued}} to operate the building as rental apartments until 1982 when he formed a company, Manhattan Master Apartment Associates, to convert it to a housing co-operative. The conversion was completed in 1988 when that company transferred control to a new organization, Master Apartments, Inc.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} of the entire municipality grew only 1% between 1981 and 1991, then increased by 15.3% between 1991 and 2001. During that period, the urban population had grown 23%, {{with the number of}} families increasing considerably — by about 44.5%. The quality of living, the infrastructure development such as the light rail metro and a 15 minutes distance from Porto and Braga, prompted new residents originating from near-by cities such as Guimarães, Famalicão, Braga and Porto which led <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> estate development that may double the resident population in the medium term.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Burns falls {{ill with}} hypohemia (a fictional {{condition}} in which the body naturally runs out of blood, though it is akin <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> condition called hypovolemia) and needs a blood transfusion. His blood type, double O negative, is very rare, however, {{and none of the}} employees at Springfield Nuclear Power Plant have it. Homer discovers that Bart has double O negative blood and urges his son to donate, promising that he will be handsomely rewarded. Bart reluctantly agrees and his blood donation saves Mr. Burns' life. Mr. Burns is rejuvenated by the blood and he sends the Simpson family a thank you card. Enraged at Mr. Burns' paltry gesture, Homer writes an insulting reply, but Marge convinces him at the last minute not to send it. The next morning, Homer discovers that the letter is gone as Bart has mailed it.|$|E

5|$|The four {{difficulty}} {{levels for}} each song afford the player a learning curve {{in order to}} help him/her progress in skill. The first difficulty level, Easy, only focuses on the first three fret buttons while displaying a significantly reduced number of notes for the player to play. Medium introduces the fourth (blue) fret button, and Hard includes the final fret button while adding additional notes. The addition of the orange fret button forces players to move their fingers up and down the neck. Expert does not introduce any other frets to learn, but adds more notes in a manner designed to challenge the player and to simulate the player's hands to move in a sequence similar <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> guitar. A difficulty added in World Tour is Beginner, which only requires the player to strum to the basic rhythm; holding the fret buttons becomes unnecessary. Another new difficulty only for drums was added to Metallica known as Expert+, which uses the double bass pedal.|$|E
5|$|The riders {{descend into}} {{a set of}} the Forbidden Forest where they {{encounter}} a figure of Aragog, a large, sentient spider who spits water at them. As Hermione tries to help the riders away from Aragog and towards the castle, encountering many spiders on the way, they encounter an animatronic Whomping Willow which swipes at them, knocking them into the Quidditch pitch. The ride returns to a projection screen as the riders become caught up in Harry's and Ron's game of Quidditch. As Slytherin scores into Gryffindor's goal, Dementors arrive at the Quidditch pitch and Harry attempts to lead the riders away through {{the structure of the}} pitch and back to the school, but their bench falls into the long-abandoned Chamber of Secrets through a cave entrance in a cliff which Harry, Ron, Ginny, Fawkes, and Gilderoy Lockhart departed through from the Chamber in the second Harry Potter installment. The riders return <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> set as the Dementors appear from the pipelines and chase them. The skeleton of the long-deceased Basilisk lies {{on the floor of the}} Chamber, and expels Lord Voldemort's Dark Mark into the air as the benches are drawn into the mouth of Salazar Slytherin's statue.|$|E

25|$|In {{the oldest}} Buddhism this essentialism is not recognizable. According to critics it doesn't really {{contribute}} <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> insight into Buddhism:...most of them labour {{under the old}} cliché {{that the goal of}} Buddhist psychological analysis is to reveal the hidden mysteries in the human mind and thereby facilitate the development of a transcendental state of consciousness beyond the reach of linguistic expression.|$|E

Scenarios depicted in 3-D graphics range from making course corrections in open waters to maneuvering in port, rivers, or other shallow waters. Cost compared <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> vessel is low. Mariners learn responses to dangerous situations, such as steering failure, {{in the safety of}} a virtual environment.|$|E

The effects were matched <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> 747 filmed taxiing at Alpena, Michigan.

25|$|Agostino Russo then refined the loop-installation concept, {{moving from}} a simple loopmounted pre-made image file to an image created on the fly using a {{dynamically}} patched version of the Debian installer, thus providing an experience which was closer <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> installation while addressing several other issues of the early prototypes. Lupin project was thus born and Agostino Russo wrote and implemented most of its code with some contributions from Geza Kovacs.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of this ruling, Overland had been denied the {{opportunity}} to cross-examine Mark Safarik, the last prosecution witness and an FBI expert on burglaries, who had testified that the crime scene suggested a staged burglary, as opposed <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> one that had been interrupted in progress. Since the prosecution had told the court at a sidebar prior to Safarik's testimony that they intended to limit their questioning to supporting this theory, Perry similarly limited the defense on cross. However, Tickle argued, since Safarik's own report had considered the other burglary, testimony about that should have been allowed.|$|E
