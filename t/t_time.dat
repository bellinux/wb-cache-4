2500|$|The Laplace {{transform}} is invertible {{on a large}} {{class of}} functions. [...] The inverse Laplace transform takes a function of a complex variable s (often frequency) and yields a function of a real variable <b>t</b> (<b>time).</b> [...] Given a simple mathematical or functional description of an input or output to a system, the Laplace transform provides an alternative functional description that often simplifies the process of analyzing {{the behavior of the}} system, or in synthesizing a new system based on a set of specifications. [...] So, for example, Laplace transformation from the time domain to the frequency domain transforms differential equations into algebraic equations and convolution into multiplication. [...] It has many applications in the sciences and technology.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the model of Time Petri Nets (TPN) where time is associated with transitions. We also consider Timed Automata (TA) as defined by Alur & Dill, and compare the expressive- ness of the two models w. r. <b>t.</b> <b>timed</b> language acceptance and (weak) timed bisimilarity. We first prove that there exists a TA A s. t. there is no TPN (even unbounded) that is (weakly) timed bisimilar to A. We then propose a structural translation from TA to (1 -safe) TPNs preserv- ing timed language acceptance. Further on, we prove that the previous (slightly extended) translation also preserves weak timed bisimilarity for a syntactical subclass T_Asyn(≤,≥) of TA. For the theory of TPNs, the consequences are: 1) TA, bounded TPNs and 1 -safe TPNs are equally expressive w. r. <b>t.</b> <b>timed</b> language acceptance; 2) TA are strictly more expressive than bounded TPNs w. r. <b>t.</b> <b>timed</b> bisimilarity; 3) The subclass T_Asyn(≤,≥), bounded and 1 -safe TPNs "`a la Merlin" are equally ex- pressive w. r. <b>t.</b> <b>timed</b> bisimilarity...|$|R

2500|$|K (clearance) {{multiplied by}} <b>t</b> (<b>time)</b> is a volume (since mL/min × min = mL, or L/h × h = L), and (K × t) {{can be thought}} of as the mL or L of fluid (blood in this case) cleared of urea (or any other solute) during the course of a single treatment. [...] V also is a volume, {{expressed}} in mL or L. So the ratio of K × t / V is a so-called [...] "dimensionless ratio" [...] and {{can be thought of}} as a multiple of the volume of plasma cleared of urea divided by the distribution volume of urea. When Kt/V = 1.0, a volume of blood equal to the distribution volume of urea has been completely cleared of urea.|$|E
2500|$|The {{position}} of a point particle is defined {{in relation to a}} coordinate system centered on an arbitrary fixed reference point in space called the origin O. A simple coordinate system might describe the {{position of}} a particle P with a vector notated by an arrow labeled r that points from the origin O to point P. In general, the point particle {{does not need to be}} stationary relative to O. [...] In cases where P is moving relative to O, r is defined as a function of <b>t,</b> <b>time.</b> In pre-Einstein relativity (known as Galilean relativity), time is considered an absolute, i.e., the time interval that is observed to elapse between any given pair of events is the same for all observers. In addition to relying on absolute time, classical mechanics assumes Euclidean geometry for the structure of space.|$|E
