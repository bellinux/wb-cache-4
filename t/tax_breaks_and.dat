5|$|On February 17, 2009, Obama {{signed the}} American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, a $787billion {{economic}} stimulus package aimed at helping the economy recover from the deepening worldwide recession. The act includes increased federal spending for health care, infrastructure, education, various <b>tax</b> <b>breaks</b> <b>and</b> incentives, and direct assistance to individuals.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the session, Rice {{prominently}} {{broke with}} Democrats to oppose the removal of capital gains <b>tax</b> <b>breaks</b> <b>and</b> to oppose granting unemployment benefits to locked-out workers. Rice also sponsored legislation backed by the South Metro Denver Chamber of Commerce to create a hybrid public-private health insurance system to cover all Colorado residents; however, these plans were put on hold after proponents of a single payer health care system advanced their competing proposal in the state legislature.|$|E
5|$|One of Fletcher's {{priorities}} {{that was}} not resolved during the session was the correction of unintended tax increases on businesses that resulted from the tax reform plan passed in 2005. Fletcher called a special legislative session for mid-June so that the legislature could amend the plan and also authorize tax breaks designed to lure a proposed FutureGen power plant to Henderson. Republican Senate President David L. Williams asked Fletcher to include tax breaks for other businesses as well, but Fletcher insisted on a sparse legislative agenda. The session convened for five days and passed the <b>tax</b> <b>breaks</b> <b>and</b> amended tax reform plan unanimously in both houses. Fletcher applauded the legislature's efficiency.|$|E

50|$|Voted in in 1988, the loi Coluche ("Coluche law") permits small donors (the largest {{segment of}} funders) {{to benefit from}} the same <b>tax</b> <b>breaks</b> as big donors. A later {{amendment}} permits donors to get a <b>tax</b> <b>break</b> of 75% for donations up to €470. Above that, and within a limit of 20% of income, the <b>tax</b> <b>break</b> is 66%. Each donor receives a tax form on which an accountant confirms all the necessary calculations for the <b>tax</b> <b>break,</b> <b>and</b> a document stating how the money donated will be used by the Restos.|$|R
50|$|The FSC Repeal and Extraterritorial Income Exclusion Act of 2000 {{effectively}} 'repatriated' the FSC <b>tax</b> <b>break</b> <b>and</b> extended it to {{all types}} of entities with qualifying foreign sales, including S corporations and Limited liability companies previously excluded. Foreign companies that are U.S. taxpayers could also use the <b>tax</b> <b>break,</b> which {{was not the case}} previously. There are rules requiring a certain proportion of U.S.-manufactured content and a certain proportion of foreign costs. Foreign tax credits on the goods concerned are not available to a participating entity. Actual manufacture can take place either inside or outside the United States.|$|R
5|$|In {{anticipation}} of an NBA team, {{and led by}} Mayor Mick Cornett, who had successfully lobbied for the previous temporary relocation of the New Orleans Hornets to Oklahoma City, the voters of that city approved a $120 million renovation of the Ford Center on March 3, 2008, including {{construction of a new}} NBA practice facility. After a tour of downtown Oklahoma City, a subcommittee of three NBA owners recommended that the league approve the move. On March 14, Bennett reached a preliminary agreement with Oklahoma City on a 15-year lease of the Ford Center that was finalized by the Oklahoma City Council and the Sonics’ ownership group two weeks later. The Oklahoma State Legislature later approved a bill to provide <b>tax</b> <b>breaks</b> <b>and</b> other incentives if the team relocated.|$|E
5|$|In 2014 Consumer Reports {{published}} {{results from}} a survey conducted with 19 secret shoppers that went to 85 dealerships in four states, making anonymous visits between December 2013 and March 2014. The secret shoppers asked a number of specific questions about cars to test the salespeople’s knowledge about electric cars. The consumer magazine decided to conduct the survey after several consumers who {{wanted to buy a}} plug-in car reported to the organization that some dealerships were steering them toward gasoline-powered models. The survey found that not all sales people seemed enthusiastic about making PEV sales; a few outright discouraged it, and even one dealer was reluctant to even show a plug-in model despite having one in stock. And many sales people seemed not to have a good understanding of electric-car <b>tax</b> <b>breaks</b> <b>and</b> other incentives or of charging needs and costs. Consumer Reports also found that when it came to answering basic questions, sales people at Chevrolet, Ford, and Nissan dealerships tended to be better informed than those at Honda and Toyota. The survey found that most of the Toyota dealerships visited recommended against buying a Prius Plug-in and suggested buying a standard Prius hybrid instead. Overall, the secret shoppers reported that only 13 dealers “discouraged sale of EV,” with seven of them being in New York. However, at 35 of the 85 dealerships visited, the secret shoppers said sales people recommended buying a gasoline-powered car instead.|$|E
5|$|Following the storm, South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun {{declared}} the entire {{of the country}} excluding Seoul and Incheon as special disaster areas, after touring the storm damage in Busan. The government provided <b>tax</b> <b>breaks</b> <b>and</b> allocated ₩1.4trillion (KRW, $1.2billion) in assistance to the affected residents, after an additional budget was passed in late September 2003. This included ₩100billion (KRW, $90million USD) in immediate funds for search and rescue missions. After the storm, residents complained they did not receive adequate warning and not enough coastal areas were evacuated, {{which led to the}} high death toll. Widespread damage and continued flooding caused traffic jams in the days following the storm. A damaged rail line prompted operators to provide alternate bus service. Landslides throughout the country forced travelers to use alternate routes. By three days after the storm, most damaged roads and highways were reopened. About 33,000members of the South Korean Army were deployed to assist in relief efforts, such as clearing roads and delivering aid to storm victims. Workers quickly restored power to 95% of customers within 24hours. The government installed four new cranes for the Busan port, and assisted operators to ensure exports would not be delayed. Heavy crop damage caused fruit and vegetable prices to rise, and fish and crop exports rose 9.2% on average. The rice harvest was the lowest in 23years, due to the storm and a government effort to limit production. To assist farmers, the government increased purchases in federal contracts. Three government-run banks provided low-rate loans for businesses damaged by the storm. Residual flooding from Maemi contributed to an outbreak of conjunctivitis in the southern portion of the country. To prevent additional outbreaks, the Korean National Institute of Health sent 1,000workers to storm-damaged areas. The Korea Stock Exchange fell 1.8% due to fears that storm damage would disrupt exports.|$|E
25|$|As he {{had done}} in first term, Keating sought to grant broad-based tax cuts. To further reduce taxes, Keating won passage of an income <b>tax</b> <b>break</b> <b>and</b> of the {{creation}} of Oklahoma’s earned income credit system to benefit the poor. Also, under Keating’s auspices, both Democratic and Republican leaders in the Legislature launched studies to examine Oklahoma’s tax system, with the purpose of overhauling the entire system. During the study, the complete elimination of Oklahoma’s income tax was proposed.|$|R

The move by Twitter was initially met {{with a great deal}} of controversy, while other businesses such as Zendesk quietly took advantage of the <b>tax</b> <b>break</b> <b>and</b> moved to the area. [...] A number of arts groups, such as the Black Rock Arts Foundation, are working to move to Mid-Market. In October 2013, Square moved its headquarters to the mid-Market area, followed by Uber and Dolby.|$|R

25|$|Beginning with Denmark in 1989, {{civil unions}} under one name or another have been {{established}} by law in several, mostly developed, countries {{in order to provide}} legal recognition of relationships formed by unmarried same-sex couples and to afford them rights, benefits, <b>tax</b> <b>breaks,</b> <b>and</b> responsibilities similar or identical to those of legally married couples. In Brazil, civil unions were first created for opposite-sex couples in 2002, and then expanded to include same-sex unions through judicial decision nine years later.|$|E
25|$|In a shift over a half-century, {{the party}} base has been transplanted from the {{industrial}} Northeast and urban centers to become {{rooted in the}} South and West, in towns and rural areas. In turn, Republicans are electing more populist, antitax and antigovernment conservatives who are less supportive—and even suspicious—of appeals from big business. Big business, many Republicans believe, is often complicit with big government on taxes, spending and even regulations, to protect industry <b>tax</b> <b>breaks</b> <b>and</b> subsidies—'corporate welfare,' in their view.|$|E
25|$|Concerned about {{corruption}} in Chinese science, some Chinese scientists, including Professor Liu Ming 刘明 of Zhejiang University in his 2005 book Critique of the Academic Evaluation System 学术评价制度批判, argue that interference from {{government officials and}} university bureaucrats makes peer review far less effective in China than it could be. The time scientists spend cultivating politically influential people is lost to scientific research. Liu argues that the command economy mentality of measuring everything by the numbers combined with pervasive political interference results in a great waste of money, human talent as well as considerable {{corruption in}} Chinese science. A 2008 investigation into a certification for high-tech enterprises allowing large <b>tax</b> <b>breaks</b> <b>and</b> other advantages {{found that more than}} 70% of the enterprises had gained this under questionable circumstances and an investigation of a sample found that 73% did not pass the requirements.|$|E

25|$|Reagan's {{support for}} an {{increased}} defense budget {{at the height of}} the Cold War was supported by Congressional Democrats and Republicans. However, Congress was reluctant to follow Reagan's proposed cuts in domestic programs. In accordance with Reagan's less-government intervention views, many domestic government programs were cut or experienced periods of reduced funding during his presidency. These included Social Security, Medicaid, Food Stamps, and federal education programs. Though Reagan protected entitlement programs, such as Social Security and Medicare, in one of the most widely criticized actions of the administration, the administration attempted to purge tens of thousands of allegedly disabled people from the Social Security disability roles, who the administration alleged were not truly disabled. Funding for government organizations, including the Environmental Protection Agency, were also reduced. He cut the EPA's budget by 22%, and his director of the EPA, Anne M. Burford, resigned over alleged mismanagement of funds. <b>Tax</b> <b>breaks</b> <b>and</b> increased military spending created a larger budget deficit, which led Reagan to approve two tax increases, aiming to preserve funding for Social Security.|$|E
25|$|This {{socially}} conservative right-wing grouping {{is currently}} {{associated with the}} Cornerstone Group (or Faith, Family, Flag), and is the oldest tradition within the Conservative Party, closely associated with High Toryism. The name stems from its support for three British social institutions (though the Church is an English institution): the Church of England, the unitary British state and the family. To this end, it emphasises the country's Anglican heritage, oppose any transfer of power away from the United Kingdom–either downwards to the nations and regions or upwards to the European Union–and seek to place greater emphasis on traditional family structures to repair what it sees as a broken society in the UK. It is a strong advocate of marriage and believes the Conservative Party should back the institution with <b>tax</b> <b>breaks</b> <b>and</b> have opposed the alleged assaults on both traditional family structures and fatherhood. Most oppose high levels of immigration and support the lowering of the current 24‑week abortion limit. Some members {{in the past have}} expressed support for capital punishment. Prominent MPs from this wing of the party include Andrew Rosindell, Nadine Dorries, Sir Edward Leigh and Jacob Rees-Mogg –the latter two being prominent Roman Catholics, notable in a faction marked out by its support for the established Church of England. The conservative English philosopher Sir Roger Scruton is a representative of the intellectual wing of the traditionalist group: his writings rarely touch on economics and instead focus on conservative perspectives concerning political, social, cultural and moral issues.|$|E
500|$|Huntsman {{has been}} {{described}} as [...] "a conservative technocrat-optimist with moderate positions who was willing to work substantively with President Barack Obama" [...] by Huffington Post political reporter, Jason Linkins. As Governor, Huntsman listed economic development, health-care reform, education, and energy security as his top priorities. Huntsman oversaw large tax cuts and advocated reorganizing the way that services were distributed so that the government would not become overwhelmed by the state's fast growing population. Huntsman also proposed a plan to reform health-care, mainly through the private sector, by using <b>tax</b> <b>breaks</b> <b>and</b> negotiation to keep prices down.|$|E

40|$|Abstract only availableIn {{an attempt}} to boost {{business}} investment, the 2003 Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act gave business owners an income tax deduction of up to $ 100, 000 {{of the purchase price}} of any vehicle greater than 6, 000 pounds used for business purposes. This is a 200 % increase from the previous maximum deduction allowed. This paper estimates the effects of this <b>tax</b> <b>break</b> on the demand for heavy vehicles and attempts to address the efficiency of the policy in terms of both increased business investment and costs imposed by heavier vehicles. The extent to which the policy is successful in increasing business investment depends heavily on whether or not the <b>tax</b> <b>break</b> generated new purchases of heavy vehicles. Policy effectiveness is undermined when business owners already planning to buy a vehicle substitute heavier vehicles covered under the <b>tax</b> <b>break</b> for lighter vehicles not covered under the <b>tax</b> <b>break.</b> Moderate evidence is found of an increase in demand for heavier vehicles. Weak evidence for substitution effects of heavier vehicles covered under the <b>tax</b> <b>break</b> for lighter vehicles not covered by the <b>tax</b> <b>break</b> is found. The overall evidence suggests a slight increase in the demand for larger vehicles, implying minimal both environmental costs and business investment. This counters most arguments of both the automakers who supported the <b>tax</b> <b>break</b> <b>and</b> environmental activists who criticized it. MU Undergraduate Research Scholars Progra...|$|R

500|$|Wise {{approached}} United Artists {{with the}} project, but after much delay they turned him down. Wise's agent then suggested that, since Wise owed Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) a film under an old contract, Wise {{should take the}} project there. MGM agreed, but would only give Wise a $1 million budget. Wise knew he could not do the film at MGM's Culver City Studios (now the Sony Pictures Studios), so took it to England, as the Eady Levy gave <b>tax</b> <b>breaks</b> <b>and</b> financing to films made there {{as a way of}} subsidizing and promoting the British film industry. [...] Someone suggested to Wise that he approach MGM's Borehamwood Studios subsidiary. Wise had been asked to come to the United Kingdom for a Royal Command Performance of West Side Story, and during the trip made the financing pitch to MGM Borehamwood. They offered a budget of $1.050 million. With the Eady Levy support, this allowed the film to go forward with production in the United Kingdom.|$|E
