50|$|Poor take-up {{adjustment}}: this is {{a simple}} adjustment on most systems yet it is often overlooked. The chain <b>take-up</b> <b>device</b> ensures that the chain is pulled tight as it leaves the drive unit. As wear occurs and the chain lengthens, the take-up extends under the force of its springs. As they extend, the spring force becomes less and the take-up has less effect. Simply compress the take-up springs and your problem goes away. Failure to do this can result in chain surging, jamming, and extreme wear on the track and chain. Take-up adjustment is also important for any conveyor using belts {{as a means to}} power rollers, or belts themselves being the mover. With poor-take up on belt-driven rollers, the belt may twist into the drive unit and cause damage, or at the least a noticeable decrease or complete loss of performance may occur. In the case of belt conveyors, a poor take-up may cause drive unit damage or may let the belt slip off of the side of the chassis.|$|E
50|$|Polymer fibers are, in general, {{produced}} on a technical scale by extrusion, i.e., a polymer melt or a polymer solution is pumped through cylindrical dies and spun/drawn by a <b>take-up</b> <b>device.</b> The resulting fibers have diameters typically on the 10-µm scale or above. To {{come down in}} diameter into the range of several hundreds of nanometers or even down to a few nanometers, Electrospinning is today still the leading polymer processing technique available. A strong electric field {{of the order of}} 103 V/cm is applied to the polymer solution droplets emerging from a cylindrical die. The electric charges, which are accumulated {{on the surface of the}} droplet, cause droplet deformation along the field direction, even though the surface tension counteracts droplet evolution. In supercritical electric fields, the field strength overbears the surface tension and a fluid jet emanates from the droplet tip. The jet is accelerated towards the counter electrode. During this transport phase, the jet is subjected to strong electrically driven circular bending motions that cause a strong elongation and thinning of the jet, a solvent evaporation until, finally, the solid nanofibre is deposited on the counter electrode.|$|E

40|$|The {{need for}} {{innovative}} lightweight materials are rapidly {{increased in the}} recent years, owing to their cost-effective, high-strength, environmentally-sound use of materials and process technologies, {{in addition to that}} they reduce the weight of a product. The characteristics of 3 D-spacer fabrics {{as one of the most}} important lightweight materials in future are multifaceted not only owing to its extremely light materials, but also because of exceptionally high stiffness to weight ratio compared to other constructions. It is also one possible method for improving the properties of fabric-reinforced composites. It can enhance the through-the-thickness properties, such as shear strength, dimensional stability, damage, tolerance, and fracture toughness that are critical for many structural applications. Spacer fabric has been employed in high-technology applications because of its critical mechanical properties related to high tensile strength, tear strength and stiffness. Furthermore, its multidirectional structures allow with more reinforcement along the thickness direction leading to an increase in stiffness and strength properties. The fundamental aim of this thesis exists in the development of a new kind of woven spacer fabrics for the light weight composites materials, in an effort to weave spacer fabrics that can not be realized with the old technology which are mentioned above. Therefore, the work in brief focuses on two main goals: 1. Development of a new kind of spacer fabrics for composites in the lightweight constructions. 2. Development of special devices of a narrow weaving machine for standing the process of the new kind of spacer fabrics production. The slippage strength test had to be carried out for the floated warp yarns through the ground fabrics by using different elements of woven fabric structures variables represented in different fabric constructions, different weft densities and different repeats of constructions by using different materials. The importance of this test related to the backward-movement of the floated warp yarns which is the crucial stage in the weaving process of spacer fabrics during the backward-movement. The results of this test determine the required forces for the backward-movement, on the other side it is the best method to observe the behavior of structure elements during the backward movement. The results of the slippage strength had been statistically analyzed, and the weaving process for the spacer fabrics had been achieved. It was concluded that the best properties for the woven spacer fabrics and the optimum case for the weaving process on the test weaving machine had been achieved when the following items are realized: Development of the narrow weaving machine is closed in assisting operations, let-off and take-up and enhancement for take-up processes. Extra let-off and <b>take-up</b> <b>devices</b> must be constructed at the weaving machine. Extra let-off device has to be used for controlling the floated warp yarns of ground fabrics. On the other side, extra take-up and the developed <b>take-up</b> <b>devices</b> have to be used for controlling the woven spacer fabrics. The experimental results give fundamental knowledges for the next steps in research and development of woven spacer fabrics made of high-performance yarns on the wide weaving machine. Die Ziele der Arbeit bestanden in der Entwicklung der Geometrie der Spacer Fabrics und der notwendigen Falteneinrichtung an der Bandwebmaschine. Spacer Fabrics werden ausschließlich aus zwei Deckflächen, die durch eingewebte Stege verbunden sind, gefertigt. Zur Entwicklung der Spacer Fabrics muss eine Doppelnadel-Bandwebmaschine mit zwei Webfächern eingesetzt werden. Für die Faltenwebeinrichtung werden der entwickelte Extra-Kettablass und der Extra-Abzug benötigt. Der Antrieb und die Steuerung des Extra-Abzuges erfolgen durch einen Synchronantrieb und der Antrieb und die Steuerung des Extra-Ablasses durch Pneumatik. Eine frei programmierbare Steuerung der Faltenwebeinrichtung ermöglicht eine sichere und optimierte Synchronisation zwischen Webprozess und Faltenbildung. Im Ergebnis einer systematischen Strukturentwicklung von Spacer Fabrics und der Simulation ihrer günstigen Herstellung mittles eines speziell entwickelten Slippage Strength Tests werden die optimalen Strukturen ermittelt. Die experimentellen Untersuchungen bringen grundlegende Erkenntnisse für die folgenden Forschungsschritte zur Entwicklung von gewebten Spacer Fabrics mit Hochleistungsgarnen auf Doppelgreiferwebmaschinen...|$|R

50|$|Apple {{released}} its first Thunderbolt-equipped computer in early 2011 with the MacBook Pro. The first Thunderbolt peripheral devices appeared in retail stores only in late 2011, with the relatively expensive Pegasus R4 (4-drive) and Pegasus R6 (6-drive) RAID enclosures by Promise Technology {{aimed at the}} prosumer and professional market, initially offering up to 12 TBs of storage, later increased to 18 TBs. Sales of these units were hurt by the 2011 floods in Thailand (who manufacture much of the world's supply of hard-drives) resulting in a cut to worldwide hard-drive production and a subsequent driving-up of storage costs, hence the retail price of these Promise units increased in response, contributing to a slower <b>take-up</b> of the <b>devices.</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{method and}} {{apparatus}} for fabricating straight or curved planar or three-dimensional (C channel, for example) fabric for fabrication into composite structures is presented. In the first embodiment, the fill yarns are inserted between layers of warp yarns, and a canted or curved reed, {{depending on the}} desired orientation of the fill yarns, is used to compact or 'beat-up' the fill yarns. In the second embodiment, the warp yarns of the fabric are curved using a conical {{or a combination of}} conical and cylindrical rollers to effect differential fabric take-up of the warp yarns for obtaining a constant radius of curvature of the warp yarns. In a third embodiment, a clamping bar fabric <b>take-up</b> <b>device</b> is used to effect the differential fabric take-up of the warp yarns for obtaining straight warp yarns, curved warp yarns with a constant radius of curvature, curved warp yarns with a non-contant radius of curvature, or some combinations of straight and curved warp yarns.

40|$|We {{implement}} a gym-attendance incentive intervention and elicit subjects' predictions of their postintervention attendance. We find that subjects greatly overpredict future attendance, which we interpret {{as evidence of}} partial naiveté with respect to present bias. We find a significant postintervention attendance increase, which we interpret as habit formation, and which subjects appear not to predict ex ante. These {{results are consistent with}} a model of projection bias with respect to habit formation. Neither the intervention incentives, nor the small posttreatment incentives involved in our elicitation mechanism, appear to crowd out existing intrinsic motivation. The combination of naiveté and projection bias in gym attendance can help to explain limited <b>take-up</b> of commitment <b>devices</b> by dynamically inconsistent agents, and points to new forms of contracts.

Since then, they have continued our programme of practical experimentation and research, called Destination Local, to develop a strong evidence base. One area of research which Nesta believes is of critical importance to stakeholders concerns the demand for and use of hyperlocal media. This is of particular importance given the rapid <b>take-up</b> of connected <b>devices</b> such as smartphones and tablets, which enable citizens and consumers to consume hyperlocal media in new ways and which may help to drive new business models towards long-term sustainability.
