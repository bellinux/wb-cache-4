25|$|Immediately {{following}} his capture, when his remand was extended, Kuntar {{confessed that he}} had bludgeoned Einat to death with <b>the</b> <b>butt</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> rifle. Later, however, when testifying in court, Kuntar denied the charges. In his testimony, Kuntar asserted that Israeli gunfire had killed Danny Haran as soldiers burst in to free him, {{and that he did}} not see what happened to Einat after passing out from blood lost from five bullet wounds. He explained that the group's goal had been to take hostages back to Lebanon, and that he had taken the 4-year-old to prevent Israeli police from shooting at them.|$|E
25|$|On Tuesday morning, October 8 {{the hijackers}} began to {{separate}} the hostages. They were looking for Jews and Americans asking for the hostages to identify themselves but meeting refusal. They collected the passports of the passengers and pulled aside twelve Americans and six female British dancers who had been hired as entertainers (originally set to perform in the very lounge they were being held hostage in). Looking at the passports of an elderly couple, the hijackers asked if they were Jewish. Upon hearing that they {{were one of the}} terrorists knocked the man to the floor and repeatedly hit him with <b>the</b> <b>butt</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> gun.|$|E
25|$|According to eyewitnesses, when Kuntar's group {{found that}} the rubber boat they'd arrived in was {{disabled}} by gunfire, Kuntar shot Danny at close range in the back, {{in front of his}} daughter, and drowned him in the sea to ensure he was dead. Next, according to forensic evidence and eyewitness court testimony, Kuntar killed the girl by smashing her skull against the rocks with <b>the</b> <b>butt</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> rifle. Smadar Haran accidentally suffocated Yael to death while attempting to quiet her whimpering, which would have revealed their hiding place. A second militant, Mhanna Salim Al-Muayed, was killed in the shootout on the beach. Kuntar and the fourth member of the group, Ahmed Assad Abras, were captured.|$|E

25|$|By {{the spring}} of 1862, Kane had {{partially}} recovered from his wound {{and returned to the}} Bucktails. They served as part of Brig. Gen. George Dashiell Bayard's cavalry in the Shenandoah Valley, fighting against Stonewall Jackson's Valley Campaign. At Harrisonburg, he and 104 picked riflemen were sent to the rescue of a regiment that had fallen into an ambush. Kane encountered three Confederate regiments on June 6, 1862. He was struck by a bullet that split the bone below his right knee and his men left him on the field. When he tried to rise after the fighting was over, a Confederate soldier broke his breastbone with a blow from <b>the</b> <b>butt</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> rifle and Kane, unconscious, was captured. He was exchanged, for Williams C. Wickham, in mid-August. He returned to duty in time for the Northern Virginia Campaign, but was so weakened that another officer led his regiment. He had to be helped onto his horse and was forced to walk using crutches; his Harrisonburg wound would reopen repeatedly for the next two years.|$|E
25|$|Buck's next {{owners are}} {{a trio of}} stampeders (Hal, Charles, and a woman named Mercedes from the United States), who are inexperienced at {{surviving}} in the Northern wilderness. They struggle to control the sled and ignore warnings that the spring melt poses dangers. They overfeed the dogs and then starve them when the food runs out. On their journey they meet John Thornton, an experienced outdoorsman, who notices the dogs have been poorly treated and are in a weakened condition. He warns the trio against crossing the river, but they ignore his advice and order Buck to move on. Exhausted, starving, and sensing the danger ahead, Buck refuses and continues to lie unmoving in the snow. After Buck is beaten by Hal, Thornton recognizes {{him to be a}} remarkable dog. Disgusted by the driver's treatment of Buck, Thornton hits Hal with <b>the</b> <b>butt</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> axe, cuts Buck free from his traces, and tells the trio he is keeping him, much to Hal's displeasure. After some argument, the trio leaves and tries to cross the river, but as Thornton warned, the ice breaks, and the three fall into the river and drown, along with the sled and neglected dogs.|$|E

5000|$|... "Gimpel the Fool" [...] (1953) is a {{short story}} by Isaac Bashevis Singer, {{translated}} into English by Saul Bellow in 1953. It {{tells the story of}} Gimpel, a simple bread maker who is <b>the</b> <b>butt</b> <b>of</b> many <b>of</b> <b>his</b> town's jokes. It also gives its name to the collection first published in 1957. David Roskies has put forward the view that the story constitutes a modernist revision of a story by Nachman of Bratslav.|$|R
2500|$|Nimoy {{also came}} up with the concept of the [...] "Vulcan nerve pinch", which he {{suggested}} as a replacement for the scripted knock out method of using <b>the</b> <b>butt</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> phaser. He wanted a more sophisticated way of rendering a person unconscious. Nimoy explained to the show's director that Spock had, per the story, gone to the Vulcan Institute of Technology and had studied human anatomy. Spock also had the ability to project a unique form of energy through his fingertips. Nimoy explained the idea of putting his hand on his neck and shoulder to Shatner, and they rehearsed it. Nimoy credits Shatner's acting during the [...] "pinch" [...] that sold the idea and made it work on screen.|$|E
2500|$|One {{week after}} the {{surrender}} of Confederate General Robert E. Lee at the Battle of Appomattox Court House, which ended all major engagements of the war, Cosgriff's unit moved towards Columbus, Georgia. Their intention was to capture the city's supply depots, naval yards, and weapons factories. On Easter Sunday, April 16, 1865, the 4th Iowa Cavalry and other regiments attacked a bridge over the Chattahoochee River which led into Columbus. When the Union general, James H. Wilson, called for cavalrymen to charge the covered bridge and capture the soldiers guarding it, Cosgriff volunteered. He and the other volunteers rode past two lines of entrenchments and fought hand-to-hand with the bridge guard. During the struggle, Cosgriff knocked down a Confederate flag bearer with <b>the</b> <b>butt</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> rifle, capturing both the flag and the bearer. The cavalrymen successfully subdued the bridge guard and captured two heavy guns. For these actions, Cosgriff was awarded the Medal of Honor two months later, on June 17. His official Medal of Honor citation reads: [...] "Capture of flag in a personal encounter with its bearer." [...] The flag, from an unknown regiment, is now held by the Museum of the Confederacy in Richmond, Virginia.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his role}} as a college {{professor}} of archaeology, Jones is scholarly and learned in a tweed suit, lecturing on ancient civilizations. At the opportunity to recover important artifacts, Dr. Jones transforms into [...] "Indiana," [...] a [...] "non-superhero superhero" [...] image he has concocted for himself. Producer Frank Marshall said, [...] "Indy [...] a fallible character. He makes mistakes and gets hurt. ... That's the other thing people like: He's a real character, not a character with superpowers." [...] Spielberg said there [...] "was the willingness to allow our leading man to get hurt and to express his pain and to get his mad out and to take pratfalls and sometimes be <b>the</b> <b>butt</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own jokes. I mean, Indiana Jones is not a perfect hero, and his imperfections, I think, make the audience feel that, with a little more exercise and a little more courage, they could be just like him." [...] According to Spielberg biographer Douglas Brode, Indiana created his heroic figure so as to escape the dullness of teaching at a school. Both of Indiana's personas reject one another in philosophy, creating a duality. Harrison Ford said the fun of playing the character was because Indiana is both a romantic and a cynic, while scholars have analyzed Indiana as having traits of a lone wolf; a man on a quest; a noble treasure hunter; a hardboiled detective; a human superhero; and an American patriot.|$|E

2500|$|A {{more serious}} escape attempt {{happened}} in 1908 that left Deputy Warden Robinson dead and Warden Conley severely wounded. It was Conley's habit to hold {{what he called}} a [...] "warden's court" [...] each morning where inmates could air their grievances. At [...] tall and weighing roughly [...], Warden Frank Conley was an imposing man, and he considered himself more than a match for the men he maintained. What his physical bulk could not handle, the [...]41 caliber pistol he habitually carried would. He was shown just how vulnerable he was when, on the morning of 8 March, Deputy John A. Robinson admitted the men lined up to speak with the warden and was rushed by four men, W.A. Hayes, C.B. Young, Oram Stevens, and George Rock. Hayes managed to get past Robinson and burst into Conley's office, waving a knife and threatening the warden. Conley drew his pistol and fired twice, hitting Hayes in the ear. The remaining three inmates rushed in and Conley fired [...] again, hitting George Rock, who retreated from the office. [...] Hayes got back to his feet, and Conley shot him again and threw him into the hall after Rock. [...] Conley then went to help Robinson, who was on the ground under Rock. [...] Rock had already slashed the Deputy's throat and was stabbing him when Conley threw a chair at the assailant, who turned on Conley. [...] The warden fended the armed man off with <b>the</b> <b>butt</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> now empty pistol, and the escape attempt was ended {{at the end of a}} billy-club wielded by Guard E.H. Carver, who had had to break through the locked door to the hallway.|$|E

In one case, {{a group of men}} said that when they were leaving a protest since it turned violent, [...] "soldiers surrounded the car, broke the windows and tossed a tear gas canister inside". A man then said that a soldier [...] "fired a shotgun at him at close range" [...] while in the vehicle. The men were then [...] "pulled from the car and beaten viciously" [...] then one soldier [...] "smashed their hands with <b>the</b> <b>butt</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> shotgun, telling them it was punishment for protesters’ throwing rocks." [...] The vehicle was then set on fire. One protester said that while detained, soldiers [...] "kicked him over and over again." [...] The protesters he was with [...] "were handcuffed together, threatened with an attack dog, made to crouch for long periods, pepper sprayed and beaten." [...] The protester then said that he was [...] "hit so hard on the head with a soldier’s helmet that he heard it crack". A woman also said she was with her daughter when [...] "they were swept up by National Guard soldiers, taken with six other women to a military post and handed over to female soldiers".
