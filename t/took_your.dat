His military service forms a major element of his public persona as portrayed by Scientologists. The Church of Scientology presents {{him as a}} [...] "much-decorated war hero who commanded a corvette and during hostilities was crippled and wounded". Scientology publications say {{he served as a}} [...] "Commodore of Corvette squadrons" [...] in [...] "all five theaters of World War II" [...] and was awarded [...] "twenty-one medals and palms" [...] for his service. He was [...] "severely wounded and was taken crippled and blinded" [...] to a military hospital, where he [...] "worked his way back to fitness, strength and full perception in less than two years, using only what he knew and could determine about Man and his relationship to the universe". He said that he had seen combat repeatedly, telling A. E. van Vogt that he had once sailed his ship [...] "right into the harbor of a Japanese occupied island in the Dutch East Indies. His attitude was that if you <b>took</b> <b>your</b> flag down the Japanese would not know one boat from another, so he tied up at the dock, went ashore and wandered around by himself for three days." ...|$|E

How can you behave so ignorantly as though nothing has happened! You wish to follow us?" [...] Qin Yilu followed Liu Bei and travelled for several li before he regretted and decided to leave. Zhang Fei killed him.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the same}} time, she started an {{on-screen}} relationship with Benoit, {{who at the}} time was involved in a feud with her real-life husband, Kevin Sullivan. On December 7, on WCW Saturday Night, during a post-match interview with Sullivan, a home movie of the couple canoodling in a kitchen was played in front of him. Woman taunted Sullivan by saying, [...] "You can't find me" [...] and [...] "I'm my own woman," [...] while Benoit added: [...] "You consider yourself the master of human chess. Well, my bishop just <b>took</b> <b>your</b> queen". After the video, Sullivan stood there speechless, and his manager Jimmy Hart led him off stage. This feud between Benoit and Sullivan saw Woman clashing with Sullivan's then-valet Jacquelyn at ringside. In one match, the two ladies were strapped together, took shots at each other, and used the strap connecting them as a weapon against the men.|$|E
2500|$|They {{arrived in}} England to find [...] "the {{whole of the}} {{southern}} counties [...] one immense armed camp". Despite the tension over the anticipated invasion of Normandy, the press and officials were eager to hear the Yugoslav story, and Maclean and Velebit had a busy time; even U.S. General Dwight D. Eisenhower wanted to meet them. At Chequers Maclean participated in attempts to build a possible compromise between the Royalist government in exile and the Partisans. As Maclean was preparing {{to go back to}} Bari and Bosnia, he received news that the enemy had made a fierce attack on Partisan headquarters at Drvar, later known as the Knight's Move. [...] "It was the kind of communication that <b>took</b> <b>your</b> breath away." [...] When he got the full story from Vivian Street, he heard how the German bombers had made a full and thorough attack, and, after Tito and the Partisans escaped, revenged themselves on the civilians, massacring almost everyone, men, women, and children. In the week that followed the attack on Drvar, Allied planes flew more than a thousand sorties in support of the Partisans. [...] Tito, harassed and harried through the woods, reached the decision that he needed to leave and establish his headquarters in a place of security. Accordingly, he asked Vivian Street to arrange for the Allies to evacuate him and his staff, which they did. Maclean, on his way back from London, caught up with the Marshal at Bari, and found him proposing to establish his base on Vis. The Royal Navy took him across in fine style, with a memorable wardroom dinner, at which Tito recited, in English, [...] "The Owl and the Pussycat".|$|E
