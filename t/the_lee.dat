5|$|The {{earliest}} recorded {{claim to}} the land {{was made by the}} Doeg. Later <b>the</b> <b>Lee</b> family of Virginia owned the land from 1725 to 1839. Richard Bland Lee did not build the main house until 1794. Following the purchase by William Swartwort in 1838, Sully was used as a home, a working farm, or both by a series of private owners. Then in 1958, Sully was acquired by the federal government {{as a part of the}} area to be used for the construction of Dulles Airport. Today the Fairfax County Park Authority operates the site with a specific focus on <b>the</b> <b>Lee</b> family.|$|E
5|$|The {{third and}} current DeKalb County Courthouse was {{constructed}} in 1905 at an approximate cost of $137,000. The project reignited {{the debate over the}} county courthouse's location and, once again, the debate over which town would hold the coveted title of county seat. The county Board of Supervisors authorized the project in 1901 and appropriated $100,000 for the new building. The idea for a new courthouse originated as early as 1900, when the essential design elements of <b>the</b> <b>Lee</b> County courthouse were chosen as the model for the new DeKalb County Courthouse. Though the courthouse was modeled after <b>the</b> <b>Lee</b> County structure it does differ; <b>the</b> <b>Lee</b> County building, in Dixon, Illinois, has a rooftop dome and also is longer and wider than the DeKalb County building. By 1903, the appropriation had been upped to $140,000 and the battle over the county seat had begun.|$|E
5|$|At {{the extreme}} northwestern edge {{adjacent}} to Skiffe's Creek and {{the border with}} James City County is <b>the</b> <b>Lee</b> Hall community, which retains historical features including the former Chesapeake and Ohio Railway station which served {{tens of thousands of}} soldiers based at what became nearby Fort Eustis during World War I and World War II. The larger-than-normal rural two-story frame depot is highly valued by rail fans and rail preservationists.|$|E

5|$|HISD also {{operates}} Liberty High School, {{a charter}} {{high school for}} recent immigrants. In January 2005, Houston ISD opened Newcomer Charter School on <b>the</b> <b>Lee</b> High School campus. School officials placed fliers in Gulfton-area apartment complexes, churches, flea markets, and washaterias. The school relocated to a shopping center along U.S. Highway 59 (Southwest Freeway) and adopted its current name in June 2007.|$|E
5|$|Highway21 {{is often}} subject to {{closures}} {{at various points}} as it lies on <b>the</b> <b>lee</b> shore of Lake Huron. Lake effect snow squalls frequently subject motorists to poor visibility and slippery conditions, leading to whiteout conditions. Because of this, the Ontario Provincial Police claim that the road is the most often closed in the province.|$|E

It was moved to Walpole, New Hampshire and then, across the Connecticut River, to Bellows Falls, Vermont where it stayed until the Blount collection was relocated to Scranton, Pennsylvania.|$|E

5|$|NESCo {{also argued}} that they had chosen the site to protect the city's amenities, {{in that it was}} outside the city boundary, {{partially}} surrounded by higher ground, and in <b>the</b> <b>lee</b> of prevailing winds.

5|$|What is now MS172 was {{originally}} designated {{as part of}} <b>the</b> <b>Lee</b> Highway auto trail in1920 before becoming part of US72 when the U.S. Highway System was created in1926.

The route was fully paved {{by the end of}} the1930s and served as a part of US72 until1986, when a new divided highway was built to the south. By1998, the former routing of US72 was designated MS172.|$|E

5|$|After her parents' {{separation}} in 1976, Jolie and {{her brother}} lived with their mother, who had abandoned her acting ambitions to focus on raising her children. Her mother raised her Catholic, but did not require {{her to go to}} church. As a child, she often watched films with her mother and it was this, rather than her father's successful career, that inspired her interest in acting, though at age five she had a bit part in Voight's Lookin' to Get Out (1982). When Jolie was six years old, Bertrand and her live-in partner, filmmaker Bill Day, moved the family to Palisades, New York; they returned to Los Angeles five years later. Jolie then decided she wanted to act and enrolled at <b>the</b> <b>Lee</b> Strasberg Theatre Institute, where she trained for two years and appeared in several stage productions.|$|E
5|$|Amongst {{local media}} outlets, only Apple Daily and Ming Pao ran {{coverage}} on their front pages initially, while other local newspapers carried only brief pieces about a missing person. Television viewers remarked that TVB {{did not run}} the story during its prime time news programmes {{for the first few}} days after news of <b>the</b> <b>Lee</b> Bo disappearance broke. Lee Bo's disappearance spurred renewed interest about Lam Wing-kee, and his family received a police visit the same day after chief executive CY Leung spoke publicly on the case.|$|E
5|$|Col. Thomas Lee (c. 1690November 14, 1750) was {{a leading}} {{political}} figure of colonial Virginia. He {{was a member of}} <b>the</b> <b>Lee</b> family, a political dynasty which included many figures from the pre-American Revolutionary War era until the late 20th century. Lee became involved in politics in 1710 and he became the resident manager of the Northern Neck Proprietary for Lady Catherine Fairfax. After his father died, he inherited land in Northumberland and Charles County. Lee later acquired vast holdings in what are now Arlington, Fairfax, Fauquier, Prince William, and Loudoun Counties. These properties were developed as tobacco plantations.|$|E

5|$|High waves caused beach erosion northward through Virginia. At Virginia Beach, {{the waves}} led to minor {{flooding}} along the Sandbridge section; rough surf {{and a strong}} undertow drowned one swimmer there. The storm triggered statewide power outages that affected about 5,000residents, {{as well as the}} Hampton Roads Bridge–Tunnel. In Newport News, lightning set a roof on fire in <b>the</b> <b>Lee</b> Hall section of the city. Emily's light rains in the area were not enough to break a prolonged drought that plagued Virginia. Rough seas and high tides later caused coastal flooding along Fire Island in New York.|$|E
5|$|It is in {{this period}} that the broch was built. Part of the {{structure}} has been lost to coastal erosion, and modern sea defences have been erected. The tower was probably originally 13metres (40feet) or more high and as with many broch sites the position would have commanded fine views of the surrounding seas. During this period archaeological sites in Shetland usually exhibit defensive fortifications of some kind, and Jarlshof is no exception. An outer defensive wall associated with the broch contained a substantial (although rather poorly constructed) house and byre at one time. This wall was utilised at a later stage to build a large roundhouse in <b>the</b> <b>lee</b> of the broch.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unclear}} when the {{individually}} named rivers became known collectively as Bow Back Rivers. Charles Tween, writing {{on behalf of}} <b>the</b> <b>Lee</b> Conservancy, referred to them as both the Stratford Back Rivers and the Stratford Back Streams in 1905. The section {{to the west of}} the more recent City Mills Lock was labelled Bow Back River on a map of 1895, but had previously been part of Pudding Mill River. Powell, writing in 1973, still referred to them as the Stratford Back Rivers.|$|E
