5|$|The {{prints and}} {{drawings}} department encompasses works on paper. The {{origins of the}} collection were the 8,600works in the Royal Collection (Cabinet du Roi), which were increased via state appropriation, purchases such as the 1,200works from Fillipo Baldinucci's collection in 1806, and donations. The department opened on 5 August 1797, with 415pieces displayed in the Galerie d'Apollon. The collection is organized into three sections: the core Cabinet du Roi, 14,000royal copper printing-plates, and the donations of Edmond de Rothschild, which include 40,000prints, 3,000drawings, and 5,000illustrated books. The holdings are displayed in the Pavillon de Flore; due to <b>the</b> <b>fragility</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> paper medium, only a portion are displayed at one time.|$|E
5|$|The year of 1964 {{marked a}} decisive {{turning point in}} the Vietnam War. Following the ousting of President Ngô Đình Diệm in 1963, South Vietnam's top army generals {{continued}} to vie with each other for control of the country’s military-dominated government instead of combating the emerging forces of the National Liberation Front, also known as the Viet Cong. <b>The</b> <b>fragility</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> South Vietnamese government was reflected on the battlefield, where its military experienced great setbacks against the Viet Cong. Taking advantage of Saigon's political instability, Communist leaders in Hanoi began preparing for war. Even though key members of North Vietnam's Politburo disagreed on the best strategy to reunite their country, they ultimately went ahead to prepare for armed struggle against South Vietnam and their American supporters.|$|E
5|$|Despite the Congress of London's {{verdict in}} 1830, the Dutch {{continued}} to resist Belgian independence {{for much of}} Leopold I's early reign. On 2 August 1831, days after Leopold's coronation, the Dutch launched an invasion known as the Ten Days' Campaign. The 50,000-strong Dutch force crossed the border and rapidly pushed the small Belgian army {{back as far as}} Leuven. Faced with a military disaster, the Belgian government appealed to the French for support. Without international support of their own and faced with an entire French army under General Étienne Gérard, the Dutch withdrew on 12 August. In 1832 the French pushed the Dutch out of Antwerp, their final garrison in Belgium. Much of the city was destroyed in the fighting. Sporadic skirmishes along the border continued until 1839, when the Dutch signed the Treaty of London. The Ten Days' Campaign revealed <b>the</b> <b>fragility</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Belgian position, and although the Dutch finally recognized the independence of Belgium, the Belgians were forced to give up some disputed territories, including Zeelandic Flanders and the Duchy of Limburg. Part of Luxembourg, equivalent to the modern state, remained as a semi-independent protectorate of the Dutch until 1890.|$|E
40|$|Osmotic {{fragility}} and erythrocyte dimensions {{were measured}} in 40 normal males between <b>the</b> ages <b>of</b> 18 and 78 years.

40|$|Radioactive iron was {{administered}} to three normal dogs, two of which had previously been bled, in order to tag a group of erythrocytes of approximately known age. <b>The</b> osmotic <b>fragility</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> newly formed tagged cells was significantly greater than that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> general cell population {{during the first few}} days after injection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> iron, while <b>the</b> mechanical <b>fragility</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> young cells was less than that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> general red cell population. As the cells aged and approached <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> their life span, their susceptibility to destruction by trauma inflicted by rolling glass beads exceeded that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> general cell population. <b>The</b> osmotic behavior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old cells was not distinctive. <b>The</b> increased mechanical <b>fragility</b> <b>of</b> senescent cells suggests that <b>the</b> life span <b>of</b> erythrocytes may be limited at least in part by changes within the cell which render it more susceptible to destruction by mechanical wear and tear in the circulation. It is emphasized, however, that the trauma produced by rolling glass beads may be quite unlike that inflicted upon red cells in vivo. A decrease in circulating radioactive iron was observed in each experiment soon after <b>the</b> mechanical <b>fragility</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tagged cells began to exceed that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total cell population. The lowest point on the curve representing circulating radioiron was noted at 119, 119, and 122 days respectively after injection <b>of</b> iron in <b>the</b> three experiments.

40|$|In light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> recent global {{financial}} crisis, <b>the</b> notion <b>of</b> financial <b>fragility</b> {{has become a}} cornerstone in current research programs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dynamics <b>of</b> modern monetary production economies.

Our aim is to extend this literature whereby considerable emphasis has been placed on <b>the</b> <b>fragility</b> <b>of</b> firms, but much less {{attention has been paid to}} <b>the</b> <b>fragility</b> <b>of</b> banks and its impact on macroeconomic performance. The paper develops a simple macroeconomic model that links <b>the</b> <b>fragility</b> <b>of</b> banks with <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> output. We put forward a Minskyan categorization for the economy’s financial structure, which takes into account both <b>the</b> <b>fragility</b> <b>of</b> banks and <b>the</b> <b>fragility</b> <b>of</b> firms. Our analysis intends to illustrate under what conditions the interaction between banks and the real economy is likely to lead to financial structures that are susceptible to financial instability...|$|R
40|$|AbstractHere {{we study}} how {{a traffic jam}} spreads on complex {{networks}} when driven by an increasing flux between certain initial and final points. For that purpose, we developed two new traffic models based on vehicular traffic and applied them on the Apollonian network and the Swiss road network. The first model is an electrical analog, using ohmic and non-ohmic resistors which is a classical approach in Physics while the second one which we call the herding model, is based on human driving behavior. For both models, we study <b>the</b> sequence <b>of</b> clogged roads up to the traffic gridlock and display <b>the</b> <b>fragilities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> network. In the electrical model, by increasing the external potential, resistors burn out, as the voltage drop between the ends increases above a certain threshold. Analyzing both models, we observed some power-law functions that occur only near a traffic gridlock {{as well as the}} dependence on topological features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> network and influence on flux and the robustness in Apollonian networks of different generations...|$|R

A year before STS-1's April 1981 launch, The Washington Monthly accurately forecast many of the Shuttle's issues, including an overambitious launch schedule and the consequently higher-than-expected marginal cost per flight; the risks of depending on the Shuttle for all payloads, civilian and military; the lack of a survivable abort scenario if a Solid Rocket Booster were to fail; and <b>the</b> <b>fragility</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shuttle's thermal protection system.|$|E

25|$|Upon {{his return}} to Lake Temagami, Belaney's fascination with the Anishinaabe people increased. Belaney set about {{studying}} their language and lore while conducting a relationship with Ojibwa co-worker Angele Egwuna. Egwuna furthered Belaney's knowledge of trapping and fish nets, and also provided access to a network of Ojibwe people. Belaney claims he passionately embraced {{the cause of the}} Ojibwe Indians, and that in turn the Ojibwe treated Belaney as one of their own. In 1909, Belaney spent a winter with the Ojibwa trappers, and claimed he had been adopted as an Ojibwa trapper. In Donald B. Smith's From the Land of Shadows, it is said that Belaney's greatest lesson was <b>the</b> <b>fragility</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> environmental ecosystem, which was influential in forming his conservationist views.

25|$|However, {{this success}} rate {{can only be}} {{achieved}} with the institution of optimum care within fifteen {{minutes to an hour}} of the accident. In the case of knocked-out teeth, being prepared and knowing what to do {{can mean the difference between}} a person retaining or losing replanted knocked-out teeth for life. Teeth that have been knocked out when they are fully matured, that is, when the root has completely formed, have a much better prognosis than those teeth that are immature and not fully formed. This is due to <b>the</b> <b>fragility</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> root. When teeth have not fully formed, the walls of the root are thinner and thus more fragile. Another complication for the prognosis is the length of time that the tooth has been out of its socket. Teeth that are replanted within fifteen minutes of the accident have an excellent prognosis. Teeth that have been extra-oral and dry stored for more than one hour have a poor prognosis. Teeth that have been placed in an optimal storage medium within one hour of the accident also have an excellent prognosis. All teeth that have been knocked out should be replanted but watched carefully for the development of root resorption. Teeth that do not have root canal treatment within two weeks of replantation also have a poor prognosis.|$|E
25|$|By long {{tradition}} the Victoria–New South Wales Sheffield Shield match began on Boxing Day at the MCG, {{much to the}} chagin of the NSW players who missed Christmas with their families as a result. But with six Tests {{to fit into the}} season this game was moved and the Third Test was held instead, thus beginning the current tradition of the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne. Australia kept and unchanged team from Perth, but the England team had a few changes. Dennis Amiss and John Edrich had recovered enough to play again after having their hands broken in the First Test at Brisbane, though Edrich's hand was still sore. The out of form Brian Luckhurst and Keith Fletcher were dropped to make room. Geoff Arnold and Chris Old were also dropped as the now fit Mike Hendrick and the spinner Derek Underwood returned to the team, Old somewhat unfairly as he had played well at Perth. This gave England only two fast bowlers, Bob Willis and Arnold, the medium pace and off-cutters of Tony Greig and the spin of Fred Titmus and Underwood. The Melbourne Cricket Ground was slower than it had ever been, with low bounce that would limit the effectiveness of the Australian fast bowling attack. Ian Chappell won the toss {{for the third time in}} a row and became the first captain in history to put the opposition in to bat in successive Tests. The day was overcast and as good for bowling as it would ever be at the MCG and Chappell was confident in the strength of his bowling attack and <b>the</b> <b>fragility</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> English batting.|$|E
