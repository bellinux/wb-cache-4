Zobel coined the term constant k filter (or k-type filter) to distinguish Campbell's filter from later types, notably Zobel's m-derived filter (or m-type filter). The particular problems Zobel was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>address</b> with these new forms were impedance matching into the end terminations and improved steepness of roll-off. These were achieved {{at the cost of}} an increase in filter circuit complexity.|$|E

It became clear to the committee that solving social problems would require involvement from more people and a more representative group of people, but they knew minorities would never participate in an organization controlled by the Chamber of Commerce.|$|E
500|$|Ann Weldy (born September 15, 1932), {{better known}} by her pen name Ann Bannon, is an American author who, from 1957 to 1962, wrote six lesbian pulp fiction novels known as The Beebo Brinker Chronicles. The books' {{enduring}} popularity and impact on lesbian identity has earned her the title [...] "Queen of Lesbian Pulp Fiction". Bannon {{was a young}} housewife <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>address</b> her own issues of sexuality when she was inspired to write her first novel. Her subsequent books featured four characters who reappeared throughout the series, including her eponymous heroine, Beebo Brinker, who came to embody the archetype of a butch lesbian. The majority of her characters mirrored people she knew, but their stories reflected a life she did not feel {{she was able to}} live. Despite her traditional upbringing and role in married life, her novels defied conventions for romance stories and depictions of lesbians by addressing complex homosexual relationships.|$|E

2500|$|Three {{constraints}} on Einstein that the DHS is <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>address</b> are {{the large number}} of access points to U.S. agencies, the low number of agencies participating, and the program's [...] "backward-looking architecture". An OMB [...] "Trusted Internet Connections" [...] initiative was expected to reduce the government's 4,300 access points to 50 or fewer by June 2008. After agencies reduced access points by over 60% and requested more than their target, OMB reset their goal to the latter part of 2009 with the number to be determined.

2500|$|While <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>address</b> both {{internal}} and external attacks, the Congressional Union worked to keep the Anthony amendment afloat in 1914. The Anthony amendment, or Mondell Resolution, was a federal amendment for woman’s suffrage and what would ultimately become the nineteenth amendment. Since their split from NAWSA, Ruth Hanna McCormick had become the chairwoman of NAWSA’s Congressional Committee. Without consulting the NAWSA Board, she had endorsed the alternative Shafroth-Palmer amendment on their behalf. This posed a huge threat to the work of Burns and Paul because the Shafroth amendment, if passed, would make suffrage a states’ rights only issue. [...] While Burns, Paul, and other women from both the Congressional Union and NAWSA met to address this issue, NAWSA ultimately remained in support of the Shafroth amendment, and the Congressional Union continued its campaign for federal suffrage.|$|E

2500|$|The {{electric}} chair {{has been criticized}} because of several instances in which the subjects were killed only after being subjected to multiple electric shocks. This led to a call for ending of the practice, because many see it as cruel and unusual punishment. <b>Trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>address</b> such concerns, Nebraska introduced a new electrocution protocol in 2004, which called for administration of a 15-second-long application of electric current at a potential of 2,450 volts; after a 15-minute wait, an official then checks for signs of life. New concerns raised regarding the 2004 protocol resulted, in April 2007, in the ushering in of the current Nebraska protocol, calling for a 20-second-long application of electric current at a potential of 2,450 volts. (Prior to the 2004 protocol change, an initial eight-second application of current at 2,450 volts was administered, followed by a one-second pause, then a 22-second application at 480 volts. After a 20-second break, the cycle was repeated three more times.) ...|$|E

2500|$|The latest {{suggestion}} for reuse {{is from the}} MTA's Twenty-Year Capital Needs Assessment for 2015-2034, published in October 2013. An issue the MTA is <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>address</b> is to provide transversal routes between the core trunk routes. The report suggests that the cheapest, easiest, and quickest way of doing this is to revitalize existing lines like the freight-only Bay Ridge Branch (for the Triboro RX service) or the Rockaway Beach Branch. No money has been allocated to the project, and MTA spokesperson Kevin Ortiz has said while it is just laying out future options. Assemblyman Phillip Goldfeder, who represents Howard Beach and Rockaway, announced in November 2013 that Queens College would be undertaking a study of all options for the disused line. The study will be done by students, who are local residents of Queens. [...] The state of New York approved a new MTA study to reactivate the Rockaway Beach Branch, with the report due by March 2017. [...] As of January 5, 2017, the MTA and Port Authority are evaluating use of the Rockaway Beach LIRR for an one-seat trip between Penn Station and Grand Central and JFK.|$|E

2500|$|The {{noticeable}} {{disparity between}} the University of Edinburgh's research capacity, endowment and international status on the one hand, and its ranking in national league tables on the other, is largely {{on account of the}} central role which 'student satisfaction' plays in the latter. The University of Edinburgh was ranked bottom in the UK for teaching quality by its students in the 2012 National Student Survey. According to The Times and Sunday Times Good University Guide 2015, [...] "The university is <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>address</b> undergraduates' concerns with a new personal tutor system and a peer support scheme. However, Edinburgh achieved an unwanted clean sweep of rock bottom rankings among universities in this year's National Student Survey (NSS) for questions to do with the promptness, usefulness and extent of academic feedback, suggesting the university {{still has a long way}} to go to turn around a poor position". In the 2017 guide, Edinburgh fell to its worst ever position of joint 37th (placed with local Heriot-Watt University) in a domestic league table. The fall was attributed to lower NSS scores combined with a significant drop (78.6% to 73%) in the prospects of its graduates.|$|E
2500|$|The {{day after}} the September 11 attacks, the duo {{reportedly}} made some political criticism of the United States relation to Israel, claiming that American support for the Jewish nation was why the attacks occurred, and that all Jewish Americans should take a loyalty oath to the United States. The Anti-Defamation League got hundreds of calls about the incident and {{sent a letter to}} WFAN management – the letter was never answered – and New York Post columnist Phil Mushnick was critical of the duo's statements. Francesa later said the comments [...] "weren’t made", prompting further criticism from Mushnick. When questioned about the controversial statements, WFAN management said that the show in question had not been taped, despite the apparent practice of posting audio recordings of the show on WFAN's website in September 2001. As recently as September 2016, Francesa denied they made the statements saying, [...] "anything that was brought up is utter utter nonsense”. In April 2017, Deadspin reported that recordings of the shows from September 11 and 12, 2001 had been located in the 9/11 archives of the Paley Center for Media. Deadspin writers listened to the September 12 episode, and noted that while Francesa and Russo had argued with a caller about loyalty to the United States versus loyalty to Israel, the broadcast [...] "was not quite the Jew-bashing trainwreck that New York Post columnist Phil Mushnick described". A 30 for 30 show in July 2017 addressed the incident, making the case that it was less incendiary than first reported, but also having friends of the hosts strongly implying that the show was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>address</b> a subject they did not know a lot about and veered out of their lane in doing so.|$|E
