25|$|The Melbourne-based Epoch re-ignited {{fears of}} a Russia {{invasion}} when three Russian ships—the Afrika, Vestnik, and Platon—were sighted near Port Phillip in January 1882. Despite the hysteria generated by the media in Melbourne, no invasion ensued. David Syme, the proprietor of The Age, wrote {{in a series of}} editorials that the visit of the three ships was associated with a war that was <b>threatening</b> <b>to</b> <b>engulf</b> Britain and Russia, and that the squadron under the command of Avraamy Aslanbegov was in the Pacific in order to raid British commerce. Newspapers wrote that Admiral Aslanbegov behaved like a varnished barbarian due to his non-acceptance of invitations, and because he preferred to stay at the Menzies Hotel, rather than the Melbourne Club or the Australian Club. Aslanbegov was accused of spying and fraud, leading to the Admiral complaining to the Premier of Victoria Bryan O'Loghlen and threatening legal action against the newspaper. John Wodehouse, 1st Earl of Kimberley, the British Secretary of State for the Colonies, defused the situation when he sent a telegraph to the government stating that relations with Russia are of a friendly character, and such newspaper reports are rendered incredible. Due to the {{fears of a}}n invasion, Fort Scratchley in Newcastle was completed by 1885.|$|E
2500|$|During the 1940s and 1950s, {{the city}} of St. Louis was overcrowded, with housing {{conditions}} in some areas resembling [...] "something out of a Charles Dickens novel." [...] Its housing stock had deteriorated between the 1920s and the 1940s, and more than 85,000 families lived in 19th century tenements. [...] An official survey from 1947 found that 33,000 homes had communal toilets. Middle-class, predominantly white, residents were leaving the city, and their former residences became occupied by low-income families.

2500|$|In {{his later}} years, Madison became highly {{concerned}} about his historic legacy. He resorted to modifying letters and other documents in his possession, changing days and dates, adding and deleting words and sentences, and shifting characters. By {{the time he had}} reached his late seventies, this [...] "straightening out" [...] had become almost an obsession. As an example, he edited a letter written to Jefferson criticizing Lafayette—Madison not only inked out original passages, but even forged Jefferson's handwriting as well. Historian Drew R. McCoy has said, [...] "During the final six years of his life, amid a sea of personal [...] troubles that were <b>threatening</b> <b>to</b> <b>engulf</b> him...At times mental agitation issued in physical collapse.

2500|$|In 1965, the War Lord Tower opened {{as one of}} {{the first}} attractions in the theme park. One of the early struggles for Universal was coming up with things for young {{children}} to do. The existing small Ma & Pa Kettle Petting Zoo was expanded into the Ark Park. This area encompassed the Mt. Ararat petting zoo with over 200 animals and birds representing 30 species and a Noah's Nursery and a Noah's Love Inn playhouse for children and animals. This was followed by the opening of the Animal Actors' School Stage in 1970. In 1968 the Screen Actors Guild enacted a rule prohibiting visitors from most soundstages. This new rule coupled with more productions being shot on location meant the backlot tram tour could not show visitors much in the way of real movie and television production. Jay Stein, President of the Recreation Division championed the idea of creating exciting experiences for visitors in place of viewing actual production. Later that same year, the Flash Flood set was opened and this first special-effects attraction proved to be a hit. 20,000 gallons of water rushed 200 feet down a narrow Mexican village street, uprooting an old tree and <b>threatening</b> <b>to</b> <b>engulf</b> the tram. The Parting of the Red Sea attraction opened in 1973. [...] In 1974, the Rockslide staged event was added to the Studio Tour. The following year The Land of a Thousand Faces opened on the Upper Lot. In 1979, the Battle of Galactica replaced Rockslide as a staged event on the Studio Tour.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to {{helping with the}} Zeitschrift, Adorno {{was expected to be}} the Institute's liaison with Benjamin, who soon passed on to New York the study of Charles Baudelaire he hoped would serve as a model of the larger Arcades Project. In correspondence, the two men discussed the difference in their conceptions of the relationship between critique and artworks which had become manifest through Benjamin's [...] "The Work of Art in the Age of its Technical Reproducibility". At around the same time Adorno and Horkheimer began planning for a joint work on [...] "dialectical logic", which would later become Dialectic of Enlightenment. Alarmed by reports from Europe, where Adorno's parents suffered increasing discrimination and Benjamin was interned in Colombes, their joint study could entertain few delusions about its practical effects. [...] "In view of what is now <b>threatening</b> <b>to</b> <b>engulf</b> Europe," [...] Horkheimer wrote, [...] "our present work is essentially destined to pass things down through the night that is approaching: a kind of message in a bottle." [...] As Adorno continued his work in New York with radio talks on music and a lecture on Søren Kierkegaard's doctrine of love, Benjamin fled Paris and attempted to make an illegal border crossing. After learning that his Spanish visa was invalid and fearing deportation back to France, Benjamin took an overdose of morphine tablets. In light of recent events, the Institute set about formulating a theory of antisemitism and fascism. On one side were those who supported Franz Neumann's thesis according to which National Socialism was a form of [...] "monopoly capital"; on the other were those who supported Friedrich Pollock's [...] "state capitalist theory." [...] Horkheimer's contributions to this debate, {{in the form of the}} essays [...] "The Authoritarian State", [...] "The End of Reason", and [...] "The Jews and Europe" [...] served as a foundation for what he and Adorno planned to do in their book on dialectical logic.|$|E
