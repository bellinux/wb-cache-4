5|$|There {{are several}} {{differences}} between the arcade game and its console adaptation. In the original arcade version, the Sankara Stones were not all found in one location {{at the end of}} a wave. Instead, Jones had to travel through a temple every two rounds. In addition, the entire style of play is different and bestows upon the player more weapons and items for Jones to collect from the slave children he frees. Jones was also unable <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> <b>in</b> previous incarnations of the game.|$|E
5|$|Band Hero has {{received}} mixed to positive reviews from gaming critics. Most recognized {{the game as}} having the same feature sets as Guitar Hero 5, including any benefits or flaws that may come from that. Reviewers praised the reuse of the Guitar Hero 5 features such as the Party Play mode that allows for players <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> <b>in</b> and out, the improved Career mode, and the improved GHTunes. Some identified that the target market of the game appears to be towards teenage girls, such as the featuring of Taylor Swift, the color schemes used in the game, {{and other parts of}} the song selection. Reviewers noted that setlist would be the strongest measure of whether players should purchase the game. The reviewers also commented on the smaller setlist, which contains only 65 songs compared to Guitar Hero 5s 85.|$|E
5|$|Harry, Ron, Ginny, and Lockhart {{return to}} the main castle and reunite with McGonagall, Dumbledore, and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley. Ginny, whose {{possession}} by Voldemort caused all of the petrification and troubles {{over the course of}} the year, is given a reprieve by Dumbledore, who reasons that greater wizards have been duped by Voldemort before and takes great interest in the qualities of the diary, which Harry gives to him. Lucius Malfoy bursts in after this meeting, demanding to know why and how Dumbledore has returned to the school and accompanied by Dobby, revealing the family to whom he is enslaved. The house-elf also provides Harry with unspoken cues regarding the diary’s ownership: While it was Tom Riddle’s, it had been in the Malfoys’ possession, and Harry returns it, devising a scenario involving his own sock that frees Dobby from the Malfoys’ employment, thus provoking an attack on Harry, only for Dobby <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> <b>in</b> and save him. The petrified students are cured, the end-of-year exams are cancelled (much to Hermione’s chagrin), Hagrid comes back in the middle of the final feast, and Harry returns to Privet Drive in higher spirits than he last left it.|$|E

5|$|Notably, KOF 94 innovated {{the genre}} by {{replacing}} a traditional round-based format used in preceding fighting {{games with a}} format consisting of 3-on-3 team based matches dubbed the Team Battle System. Instead of choosing a single character, the player selects from one of eight available teams, each consisting of three members. Before each match, the players choose {{the order in which}} each of their team member enters the battle. When the match begins, the members chosen to go first on their respective teams will fight. When one character is defeated, the following member of the same team will take his or her place, while the character on the other team will have a small portion of their life restored (if energy was lost during the previous round). If a character is losing a match against the opponent, then the player can call one of the remaining teammates standing on the sidelines <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> <b>in</b> and perform a support attack. The match ends when all three members of either team lose.|$|E

25|$|A study {{published}} in June 2016 evaluated {{the status of the}} implementation of Golden Rice, which was first developed in the 1990s to produce higher levels of Vitamin A than its non-GMO counterparts. This strain of rice was designed so that malnourished women and children in third world countries who were more susceptible to deficiencies could easily improve their Vitamin A intake levels and prevent blindness, which is a common result. Golden Rice production was centralized to the Philippines, yet there have been many hurdles <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> <b>in</b> order to get production moving. The study showed that the project is far behind schedule and is not living up to its expectations. Although research on Golden Rice still continues, the country has moved forward with other non-GMO initiatives to address the Vitamin A deficiency problem which is so prevasive in that region.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{attempts}} {{to apply the}} results of martingale theory in probability theory have shown that {{it is first necessary}} to interpret this abstract mathematical theory in more conventional terms. One example of this is the need to obtain a representation of the dual predictable projections (compensators) used in martingale theory in terms of probability distributions. However, up to now a representation of this type has been derived only for one special case. In this paper, the author gives probabilistic representations of the dual predictable projection of integer-valued random measures that correspond <b>to</b> <b>jumps</b> <b>in</b> a semimartingale with respect to the sigma-algebras generated by this process. The results are of practical importance because such dual predictable projections are usually interpreted as random intensities or hazard rates related <b>to</b> <b>jumps</b> <b>in</b> trajectories: applications are found in such fields as mathematical demography and risk analysis...|$|R

Additionally, casual games frequently support the ability <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> <b>in</b> {{and out of}} play on demand. Casual games as a format existed long before the term was coined and include video games such as Solitaire or Minesweeper which can commonly be found pre-installed with many versions of the Microsoft Windows operating system.

25|$|On October 19, 2010, in {{the second}} inning of Game 4 of the American League Championship Series, with no score, Yankees player Robinson Canó hit a fly to the right field wall. Rangers right fielder Nelson Cruz backtracked and {{positioned}} himself <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> <b>in</b> the air and attempt to catch Cano's fly ball at the wall. Jared Macchirole, a 20-year-old spectator seated in the bleachers, reached out to catch the ball, and in doing so, made contact with the glove of Cruz, ending his upward momentum, and ensuring that Cruz would not catch the ball, that did reach the seats. Right Field Umpire Jim Reynolds ruled the play a home run rather than calling for Instant Replay review to determine whether spectator interference had occurred as specified by MLB's new rule regarding Instant Replay. The potential interference and umpire's call resulted in a solo home run for Cano, the Yankees taking a 1–0 lead at the time.|$|E
25|$|The second {{modification}} was {{the requirement}} {{that one of the}} ice giants and Jupiter encounter Jupiter causing its semi-major axis <b>to</b> <b>jump.</b> <b>In</b> this jumping-Jupiter scenario an ice giant encounters Saturn and is scattered inward onto a Jupiter-crossing orbit, causing Saturn's orbit to expand; then encounters Jupiter and is scattered outward, causing Jupiter's orbit to shrink. This results in a step-wise separation of Jupiter's and Saturn's orbits instead of a smooth divergent migration. The step-wise separation of the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn avoids the slow sweeping of secular resonances across the inner solar System that resulted in the excitation of the eccentricities of the terrestrial planets and an asteroid belt with an excessive ratio of high- to low-inclination objects The encounters between the ice giant and Jupiter in this model allow Jupiter to acquire its own irregular satellites. Jupiter trojans are also captured following these encounters when Jupiter's semi-major axis jumps and, if the ice giant passes through one of the libration points scattering trojans, one population is depleted relative to the other. The faster traverse of the secular resonances across the asteroid belt limits the loss of asteroids from its core. Most of the rocky impactors of the Late Heavy Bombardment instead originate from an inner extension that that is disrupted when the giant planets reach their current positions, with a remnant remaining as the Hungaria asteroids. Some D-type asteroids are embedded in inner asteroid belt, within 2.5 AU, during encounters with the ice giant when it is crossing the asteroid belt.|$|E
