5|$|By {{the middle}} of the 2000s (decade), the {{increased}} Indian gaming that McCain had helped bring about was a $23billion industry. He was twice chairman of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, in 1995–1997 and 2005–2007, and his Committee helped expose the Jack Abramoff Indian lobbying scandal. By 2005 and 2006, McCain was pushing for amendments to the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>limit</b> creation of off-reservation casinos, as well as limiting the movement of tribes across state lines to build casinos.|$|E
5|$|A centenary {{celebration of}} Brooke rule in Sarawak {{was held in}} 1941. During the celebration, a new {{constitution}} was introduced <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>limit</b> {{the power of the}} Rajah and granting the Sarawak people a greater role in the functioning of government. However, this constitution was never fully implemented due to the Japanese occupation. That same year saw the British withdrawing its air and marine forces defending Sarawak to Singapore. With Sarawak now unguarded, the Brooke regime adopted a scorched earth policy where oil installations in Miri were to be destroyed and the Kuching airfield held as long as possible before being destroyed. Nevertheless, a Japanese invasion force led by Kiyotake Kawaguchi landed in Miri on 16 December 1941 and conquered Kuching on 24 December 1941, with British ground forces retreating to Singkawang in neighbouring Dutch Borneo. After ten weeks of fighting there, the Allied forces surrendered on 1 April 1942. Charles Vyner Brooke, the last Rajah of Sarawak, had already left for Sydney, Australia; his officers were captured by the Japanese and interned at the Batu Lintang camp.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the tribes}} made {{progress}} {{in implementing the}} Hathaway plans with the paper and timber companies, Krulitz ceased to support the proposal when {{the full extent of}} the required federal appropriations became clear. Krulitz was replaced with Eric Jankelassistant for intergovernmental affairs to Interior Secretary Cecil Andruswith whom Tureen had previously negotiated the settlement to the Narragansett land claim in Rhode Island. Tureen and Jankelalong with Donald Perkins, a lawyer for the paper and timber companiesnegotiated a solution whereby $30 million of the settlement funds would come from various programs in the federal budget. That settlement was presented to the Maine congressional delegation in August 1979, but they refusal to endorse it until the Maine legislature had approved it. Governor Langley, in turn, refused to accept any deal <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>limit</b> the state's jurisdiction over the tribes.|$|E

5|$|Ford often opposed {{governor}} Mark Sanford's political goals, arguing {{his proposed}} reforms were unwanted by the public, and he mostly opposed Sanford's fiscal policy and worked to override budget vetoes by the governor, claiming he {{was removed from}} the interests of citizens. An exception were security measures for the State House complex which Ford agreed were too costly. He also opposed Sanford's goal {{to increase the number of}} roll calls in the State Senate and voted against a 2008 immigration reform bill favored by Sanford, stating it would be an ineffective deterrent and would lead to less driving safety. The reform would have required all employers to use state driver's licenses or a database from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to check the legal status of workers. Ford co-sponsored a bill with Glenn McConnell <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>limit</b> the governor's authority to appoint and remove board members overseeing the Charleston port and increase required qualifications for board members. Ford opposed a bill giving Sanford authority over the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control.|$|E

25|$|In early 1979, Heenan {{left the}} AWA (suspended one year, in storyline) {{to work in}} Georgia Championship Wrestling, a tenure he later {{said he did not}} enjoy due to his dislike of booker Ole Anderson.

In late 1979, Heenan returned to AWA and resumed managing Nick Bockwinkel to renewed championship success, including against Hogan in 1983. During AWA's tour of Japan in 1983, Heenan suffered a neck injury in a match with Atsushi Onita <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>limit</b> his in-ring ability going forward.|$|E
25|$|State Senator Jesse Laslovich, a Democrat from Anaconda, {{sponsored}} a bill <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>limit</b> COPA agreements to 10 years and {{which would make}} this limitation retroactive (so it would apply to the Benefis agreement). Benefis focused its lobbying efforts on prices, and pledged to keep its prices in the lower 50th percentile for large Montana hospitals. At legislative hearings in the state senate, more than 20 individuals testified {{for three and a}} half hours about the merits of the bill. The bill passed the state senate by a vote of 39-to-11.

25|$|In 1962, Great Canadian Oil Sands Limited (GCOS) {{received}} {{approval from}} the Alberta government to build and operate a 10,000 cubic metre per day plant near Fort McMurray. The plant was to produce 240 tonnes of sulfur and 900 tonnes of coke per day as by-products. Because {{at that time the}} industry was having difficulties marketing its oil, the provincial government established a policy <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>limit</b> oil sands production. According to this policy, synthetic oil from the oil sands could supplement conventional oil sales, but could not displace it. Oil from the plant could not exceed 5 per cent of total volumes in markets already supplied by conventional Alberta oil.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, public {{attention}} focused again on Cheney's sexuality, when the Bush administration supported the Federal Marriage Amendment, a proposed {{amendment to the}} United States Constitution <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>limit</b> marriage to heterosexual couples and ban civil unions and domestic partnership benefits. Cheney did not publicly express her opinion of the amendment at the time. In her 2006 autobiography Now It's My Turn, Cheney stated her opposition to the amendment. However, at the time, she remained silent to support Bush's re-election bid. In August 2004, Dick Cheney reiterated the position he took in the 2000 Presidential campaign: that the issue should be handled by individual state governments. He added, though, that President Bush determined his administration's policies, and his policy supported the Federal Marriage Amendment.|$|E
25|$|Harmonix {{developed}} a new game engine called Forge, also used for their remake of Amplitude, {{to take advantage of}} the upgraded hardware of the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, allowing the game to run at 1080p at 60 frames per second; product manager Eric Pope stated that the engine included better lighting, character models, and animation. The game was not released for the Wii U or the personal computer market, with product manager Daniel Sussman stating that two issues <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>limit</b> a personal computer version is existing music availability, and the lack of security for the specific music tracks which the PlayStation and Xbox consoles already possess. Sussman stated that either platform could be possible in the future if there is market demand, but their present focus was the safest route to bringing Rock Band to mass market through the major console platforms.|$|E

25|$|The Lightning {{picked up}} goalscorer Dino Ciccarelli from the Detroit Red Wings during the 1996 off-season, {{and he did}} not disappoint, scoring 35 goals in the 1996–97 season, with Chris Gratton {{notching}} another 30 goals. The team moved into a glittering new arena, the Ice Palace (now the Amalie Arena), and appeared destined for another playoff spot. However, the Lightning suffered a devastating rash of injuries. Puppa developed back trouble that kept him out of all but four games during the season; he would only play a total of 50 games from 1996 until his retirement in 2000. Bradley also lost time to a series of injuries <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>limit</b> him to a total of 49 games from 1996 until his retirement in December 1999. Center John Cullen developed non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and missed the last 12 games of the 1996–97 season; he would eventually be forced to retire in 1999. Decimated by these ailments, the Lightning narrowly missed the playoffs. It would be seven years before the Lightning would even come close to the playoffs again.|$|E
25|$|Preclinical {{studies have}} not {{presented}} any sign that bevirimat might {{be associated with}} any specific safety concerns <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>limit</b> its clinical use. In vitro preclinical studies in human cells propose that bevirimat should have low potential for cytotoxicity. There {{is no evidence of}} any reproductive or developmental toxicity and it is not immunotoxic. Bevirimat was initially evaluated for safety and pharmacokinetics in a single-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase clinical study in healthy volunteers. It was administered as an oral solution in doses of 25, 50, 100, and 250mg. The plasma concentrations were dose-proportional, and the compound was seen to be safe and well tolerated with no dose-limiting toxicities and no serious adverse effects. In one clinical trial, headaches was the most commonly reported side effect of bevirimat, reported by four participants on bevirimat and one on the placebo. The second most common reported side effect was throat discomfort by two participants on bevirimat. No serious adverse effects were reported, all adverse effects reported were mild, and no participants discontinued use of bevirimat because of the adverse effects.|$|E
25|$|By long {{tradition}} the Victoria–New South Wales Sheffield Shield match began on Boxing Day at the MCG, {{much to the}} chagin of the NSW players who missed Christmas with their families as a result. But with six Tests {{to fit into the}} season this game was moved and the Third Test was held instead, thus beginning the current tradition of the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne. Australia kept and unchanged team from Perth, but the England team had a few changes. Dennis Amiss and John Edrich had recovered enough to play again after having their hands broken in the First Test at Brisbane, though Edrich's hand was still sore. The out of form Brian Luckhurst and Keith Fletcher were dropped to make room. Geoff Arnold and Chris Old were also dropped as the now fit Mike Hendrick and the spinner Derek Underwood returned to the team, Old somewhat unfairly as he had played well at Perth. This gave England only two fast bowlers, Bob Willis and Arnold, the medium pace and off-cutters of Tony Greig and the spin of Fred Titmus and Underwood. The Melbourne Cricket Ground was slower than it had ever been, with low bounce <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>limit</b> the effectiveness of the Australian fast bowling attack. Ian Chappell won the toss {{for the third time in}} a row and became the first captain in history to put the opposition in to bat in successive Tests. The day was overcast and as good for bowling as it would ever be at the MCG and Chappell was confident in the strength of his bowling attack and the fragility of the English batting.|$|E
