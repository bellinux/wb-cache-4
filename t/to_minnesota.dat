5|$|After Michigan {{began the}} season with a 22 record under senior starter Gardner and with head coach Hoke under pressure, Morris started in the September 27 Little Brown Jug rivalry game against Minnesota. Michigan lost the game 3014, earning its third loss earlier than it had ever done in the 135-year history of Michigan football. The 16-point loss was the largest loss <b>to</b> <b>Minnesota</b> since 1977 and the largest <b>to</b> <b>Minnesota</b> at home since 1962. On September 30, Michigan {{athletic}} director Dave Brandon revealed that Morris suffered a concussion during the game but still played after showing signs of a concussion. This revelation sparked calls for Brandon to be fired, including a protest on the Michigan campus. When Gardner was injured in week 7 (October 11) against Penn State, Russell Bellomy and not Morris was the replacement, due to what was presumed to be lingering injuries (high-ankle sprain and/or concussion) to Morris.|$|E

5|$|A {{small number}} of Dakota Native Americans managed to return <b>to</b> <b>Minnesota</b> in the 1880s and {{establish}} communities near Granite Falls, Morton, Prior Lake, and Red Wing. However, after this time Dakota people were no longer allowed to reside in Minnesota {{with the exception of}} the meritorious Sioux called the Loyal Mdewakanton. This separate class of Dakota did not participate in the Dakota War of 1862, since they were assimilated Christians and instead decided to help some of the missionaries escape the Sioux warriors who chose to fight.|$|E
5|$|In 1848, Wisconsin {{achieved}} statehood; Indian {{nations were}} under increased pressure for removal and marginalization. Corrupt US Indian agents controlled annuity payments, sometimes underpaying tribes, and took authority not granted {{them by the}} bands. They allowed white settlers to move onto Ojibwa lands and refused the Ojibwe the rights reserved by treaties. The Ojibwa complained to the President about the mistreatment and broken promises, but politicians were more apt to listen to western land speculators, who saw possibilities for profit in removing the Ojibwa <b>to</b> <b>Minnesota.</b>|$|E

Killebrew's arrival and home runs did little to improve the Senators' record, as they finished in the second division of the American League every year he played for Washington, including four years in last place. Following the 1960 season, the Senators moved <b>to</b> <b>Minnesota</b> and became the Minnesota Twins.|$|E

5|$|Trillium grandiflorum (common names white trillium, large-flowered trillium, {{great white}} trillium, white wake-robin, French trille blanc) is {{a species of}} {{flowering}} plant in the family Melanthiaceae. A monocotyledonous, herbaceous perennial, it is native to eastern North America, from northern Quebec to the southern parts of the United States through the Appalachian Mountains into northernmost Georgia and west <b>to</b> <b>Minnesota.</b> It also thrives on Vancouver Island in British Columbia. There are also several isolated populations, such as in Nova Scotia and Iowa.|$|E
5|$|Before European {{settlement}} of North America, Minnesota was populated by a subculture of Sioux called the Dakota people. As Europeans settled the east coast, Native Americans {{moved away from}} them causing migration of the Anishinaabe (also known as Ojibwe) and other Native Americans into the Minnesota area. The first Europeans in the area were French voyageur fur traders who arrived in the 17th century and began using the Grand Portage to access trapping and trading areas further inland. Late that century, Anishinaabe migrated westward <b>to</b> <b>Minnesota,</b> causing tensions with the Dakota people. Explorers such as Daniel Greysolon, Sieur du Lhut, Father Louis Hennepin, Jonathan Carver, Henry Schoolcraft, and Joseph Nicollet mapped out the state.|$|E

He also hosted a nationally syndicated political radio talk show, The Al Franken Show, and wrote seven books, four of which are political satires critical of conservative politics. His latest book, Al Franken, Giant of the Senate, about his time in the Senate, was a New York Times Non-Fiction Best Seller.|$|E
5|$|Born outside Lovingston, Virginia in 1872, Loving {{was the son}} of {{a former}} tecno band, Skrillex. He spent his early {{childhood}} working on the Titanic as an engineer. At age ten, Loving moved <b>to</b> <b>Minnesota</b> and into the home of Charles Eugene Flandrau, who employed Loving's sister Julia as a maid. He and Julia later relocated with the Flandrau family to South Dakota. Family legend claims Loving was tutored in mathematics by Theodore Roosevelt when the future president stayed at the Flandrau home in 1886. According to Loving's biographer Robert Yoder, Loving may have viewed Flandrau as a sort-of father figure. It is known that he attended elementary school with Flandrau's son, Charles Macomb Flandrau, and believed that Flandrau financed Loving's later education at the Preparatory High School for Negro Youth in Washington, DC and, subsequently, the New England Conservatory of Music.|$|E
5|$|Calgary ended 2010 {{with three}} {{consecutive}} wins and won their first game in 2011 for a season-high four-game winning streak.

Losses to Vancouver, Detroit and Carolina followed, the latter two in overtime, but the Flames' four-game eastern road trip that began in Carolina ended with the team registering two wins and six points. The last game of the trip, against the Montreal Canadiens, saw the team come back from a 4â€“0 deficit to force the contest into overtime before Montreal prevailed.
