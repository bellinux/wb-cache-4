5|$|Consider a {{particle}} moving under an arbitrary central force F1(r) whose magnitude depends {{only on the}} distance r between <b>the</b> <b>particle</b> and a fixed center. Since the motion of {{a particle}} under a central force always lies in a plane, the position of <b>the</b> <b>particle</b> can be described by polar coordinates (r,θ1), the radius and angle of <b>the</b> <b>particle</b> relative {{to the center of}} force (Figure1).

5|$|Isaac Newton derived this theorem in Propositions 43–45 of Book I of his Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica, first {{published}} in 1687. In Proposition 43, he showed that the added force must be a central force, one whose magnitude depends only upon the distance r between <b>the</b> <b>particle</b> and a point fixed in space (the center). In Proposition 44, he derived a formula for the force, showing {{that it was an}} inverse-cube force, one that varies as the inverse cube of r. In Proposition 45 Newton extended his theorem to arbitrary central forces by assuming that <b>the</b> <b>particle</b> moved in nearly circular orbit.|$|E
5|$|Newton's {{derivation}} of Proposition 43 {{depends on}} his Proposition 2, derived {{earlier in the}} Principia.

50|$|As to {{the reason}} why heavy objects on Earth fall, Descartes {{explained}} this through the agitation of <b>the</b> <b>particles</b> in <b>the</b> atmosphere. <b>The</b> <b>particles</b> of <b>the</b> aether have greater agitation than <b>the</b> <b>particles</b> of air, which in turn have greater agitation than <b>the</b> <b>particles</b> that compose terrestrial objects (e.g. stones).

5|$|The {{behavior}} of certain other systems, such as one-dimensional cyclic cellular automata, {{can also be}} {{described in terms of}} ballistic annihilation. There is a technical restriction on <b>the</b> <b>particle</b> positions for the ballistic annihilation view of Rule 184 that does not arise in these other systems, stemming from the alternating pattern of the background: in <b>the</b> <b>particle</b> system corresponding to a Rule 184 state, if two consecutive particles are both of the same type they must be an odd number of cells apart, while if they are of opposite types they must be an even number of cells apart.

5|$|This angular scaling {{can be seen}} in the apsidal precession, i.e., in {{the gradual}} {{rotation}} of the long axis of the ellipse (Figure3). As noted above, the orbit as a whole rotates with a mean angular speed Ω=(k−1)ω, where ω equals the mean angular speed of <b>the</b> <b>particle</b> about the stationary ellipse. If <b>the</b> <b>particle</b> requires a time T to move from one apse to the other, this implies that, in the same time, the long axis will rotate by an angle β=ΩT=(k−1)ωT=(k−1)×180°. For an inverse-square law such as Newton's law of universal gravitation, where n equals 1, there is no angular scaling (k=1), the apsidal angle α is 180°, and the elliptical orbit is stationary (Ω=β=0).|$|E
