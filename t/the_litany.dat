5|$|Parliament {{was summoned}} in 1559 to {{consider}} the Reformation Bill {{and to create a}} new church. The Reformation Bill defined the Communion as a consubstantial celebration as opposed to a transubstantial celebration, included abuse of the pope in <b>the</b> <b>litany,</b> and ordered that ministers should not wear the surplice or other Roman Catholic vestments. It allowed ministers to marry, banned images from churches, and confirmed Elizabeth as Supreme Governor of the Church of England.|$|E

5|$|The Act of Uniformity 1558, which forced {{people to}} attend Sunday service in an Anglican church {{with a new}} version of the Book of Common Prayer, passed by only three votes. The Bill of Uniformity was more {{cautious}} than the initial Reformation Bill. It revoked the harsh laws proposed against Roman Catholics, it removed the abuse of the pope from <b>the</b> <b>litany</b> and kept the wording that allowed for both consubstantial and transubstantial beliefs in the presence of Christ in the Eucharist.|$|E
5|$|The Bill met heavy {{resistance}} in the House of Lords, as Roman Catholic bishops {{as well as the}} lay peers voted against it. They reworked much of the Bill, changed <b>the</b> <b>litany</b> to allow for a transubstantial belief in the Communion and refused to grant Elizabeth the title of Supreme Head of the Church. Parliament was prorogued over Easter, and when it resumed, the government entered two new bills into the Houses—the Act of Supremacy and the Act of Uniformity.|$|E
5|$|In 1907, to {{mark the}} seventh centenary {{of the birth of}} King James I, Gaudí {{designed}} a monument in his memory. It would have been situated in the Plaça del Rei, and would have also meant the renovation of the adjacent buildings: new roof for the cathedral, as well as the completion of its towers and cupola; placement of three vases above the buttresses of the Chapel of Santa Àgada, dedicated to <b>the</b> <b>Litany</b> of the Blessed Virgin Mary, as well as the figure of an angel on top of the chapel's tower; finally, the opening of a large square next to the walls (now the Plaça Ramon Berenguer el Grand).

25|$|Lomborg concludes {{his book}} by once again {{reviewing}} <b>the</b> <b>Litany,</b> and {{noting that the}} real {{state of the world}} is much better than <b>the</b> <b>Litany</b> claims. According to Lomborg, this discrepancy poses a problem, as it focuses public attention on relatively unimportant issues, while ignoring those that are paramount. In the worst case, The Skeptical Environmentalist argues, the global community is pressured to adopt inappropriate policies which have adverse effects on humanity, wasting resources that could be put to better use in aiding poor countries or fighting diseases such as AIDS. Lomborg thus urges us to look at what he calls the true problems of the world, since solving those will also solve <b>the</b> <b>Litany.</b>|$|E
25|$|The choir sang <b>the</b> <b>Litany</b> of the Saints; {{the same}} litany was chanted during the {{procession}} that transferred {{the body of}} Pope John Paul II from the Clementine Hall of the Apostolic Palace to St. Peter's Basilica. Breaking with tradition for the sacred prayer, {{the names of the}} saints canonised by Pope John Paul II, such as Faustina Kowalska and Josemaría Escrivá, were allowed to be included in <b>the</b> <b>litany.</b> Names of saints included in the more traditional litany were also included along with the newer saints.|$|E
5000|$|Before going further, {{it may be}} well to say a {{few words}} on the {{composition}} of <b>the</b> <b>litanies</b> we have been considering. With regard to their content, which consists mainly of praises of the Blessed Virgin, it would seem to have been taken not so much from the Scriptures and the Fathers, at least directly, as from popular medieval Latin poetry. To be convinced of this, it suffices to glance through the Daniel and Mone collections, and especially through the [...] "Analectica Hymnica medii ævi" [...] of DrevesBlume. In the earlier and longer litanies whole rhythmic strophes are to be found, taken bodily from such poetry, and employed as praises of the Blessed Virgin. With regard to their form, it is certain that those who first composed <b>the</b> Marian <b>litanies</b> aimed at imitating <b>the</b> <b>litanies</b> of <b>the</b> Saints which had been in use in the Church since the 8th century. During the Middle Ages, as is well known, it was customary to repeat over and over single invocations in <b>the</b> <b>litanies</b> of <b>the</b> saints, and thus we find that the basic principle of <b>the</b> Marian <b>litanies</b> is this constant repetition of the invocation, [...] "Sancta Maria, ora pro nobis." [...] And in order that this repetition might not prove monotonous in the Middle Ages recourse was had to an expedient since then universally used, not only in private devotions but even in liturgical prayer, that of amplifying by means of what are called tropes or farcituræ. They had a model in the Kyrie of the Mass, e.g. [...] "Kyrie, fons bonitatis, pater ingenite, a quo bona cuncta procedunt, eleison." [...] It was an easy matter to improvise between the [...] "Sancta Maria" [...] and the [...] "Ora pro nobis", repeated over and over, a series of tropes consisting of different praises, with an occasional added petition, imitated however broadly from <b>the</b> <b>litanies</b> of <b>the</b> saints. Thus <b>the</b> Marian <b>litany</b> was evolved.|$|R

25|$|A temple that {{maintains}} an Adaran or Behram fire also maintains {{at least one}} Dadgah fire. In contrast to the Adaran and Behram fires, the Dadgah fire is the one at which priests then celebrate the rituals of the faith, and which the public addresses to invoke blessings for a specific individual, a family or an event. Veneration of the greater fires is addressed only to the fire itself – that is, following the consecration of such a fire, only the Atash Nyashes, <b>the</b> <b>litany</b> to the fire in Younger Avestan, is ever recited before it.|$|E
25|$|While Cambridge {{began writing}} in the 1870s to make money to help support her children, her formal {{published}} career spans from 1865 with Hymns on <b>the</b> <b>Litany</b> and The Two Surplices, to 1922 with an article 'Nightfall' in Atlantic Monthly. According to Barton, her early works 'contain the seeds of her lifelong insistence on and pursuit of physical, spiritual and moral integrity {{as well as the}} interweaving of poetry and prose which was to typify her writing career'. Cato writes that 'some of her ideas were considered daring and even a little improper for a clergyman's wife. She touches on extramarital affairs and the physical bondage of wives'.|$|E
25|$|On Holy Saturday morning, {{the three}} city bands again {{take part in}} the Epitaph {{procession}}s of St. Spyridon Cathedral in procession with the Saint's relics. At this point the bands play different funeral marches, with the Mantzaros playing Miccheli's Calde Lacrime, the Palia playing Marcia Funebre from Faccio's Amleto, and the Capodistria playing the Funeral March from Beethoven's Eroica. This custom dates from the 19th century, when colonial administrators banned the participation of the British garrison band in the traditional Holy Friday funeral cortege. The defiant Corfiotes held <b>the</b> <b>litany</b> the following morning, and paraded the relics of St. Spyridon too, so that the administrators would not dare intervene.|$|E

This was not a tariqa in the sense of an organized Sufi order, but rather a spiritual method, consisting of a set of teachings and litanies, aimed at nurturing the spiritual link between the disciple and Muhammad directly.
