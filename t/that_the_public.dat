5|$|After {{the opening}} on Downtown Line, Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan {{announced}} that public transport fare rules will be reviewed {{to allow for}} transfers across MRT lines at different stations as the rail network is getting denser. Currently, commuters are charged a second time when they make such transfers. He added <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Public</b> Transport Council (PTC) will review distance-based fare transfer rules to ensure they continue to facilitate “fast, seamless” public transport journeys. The review of distance-based fare rules on MRT lines {{is expected to be}} completed in the first quarter in 2018.|$|E
5|$|Aware <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> {{appreciated}} {{instrumental music}} with context, Liszt provided written prefaces for nine of his symphonic poems. However, Liszt's {{view of the}} symphonic poem tended to be evocative, using music to create a general mood or atmosphere rather than to illustrate a narrative or describe something literally. In this regard, Liszt authority Humphrey Searle suggests {{that he may have}} been closer to his contemporary Hector Berlioz than to many who would follow him in writing symphonic poems.|$|E

5|$|When released, Raptor Red was {{generally}} praised: Bakker's anthropomorphism {{was seen as}} a unique and positive aspect of the book, and his writing was described as folksy and heartfelt. Criticisms of the novel included a perceived lack of characterization and average writing. Some scientists, such as paleontologist David B. Norman, took issue with the scientific theories portrayed in the novel, fearing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> would accept them as fact, while Discovery Channel host Jay Ingram defended Bakker's creative decisions in an editorial.|$|E
5|$|William Warburton's {{treatise}} The Divine Legation of Moses, published from 1738 to 1741, {{included an}} analysis of ancient mystery rites that drew upon Sethos for much of its evidence. Assuming that all mystery rites derived from Egypt, Warburton argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> face of Egyptian religion was polytheistic, but the Egyptian mysteries were designed to reveal a deeper, monotheistic truth to elite initiates. One of them, Moses, learned this truth during his Egyptian upbringing and developed Judaism to reveal it to the entire Israelite nation.|$|E

5|$|Alternatively, Edward and Gaveston {{may have}} simply been {{friends with a}} close working relationship. Contemporary chronicler {{comments}} are vaguely worded; Orleton's allegations were {{at least in part}} politically motivated, and are very similar to the highly politicised sodomy allegations made against Pope Boniface VIII and the Knights Templar in 1303 and 1308 respectively. Later accounts by chroniclers of Edward's activities may trace back to Orleton's original allegations, and were certainly adversely coloured by the events at the end of Edward's reign. Such historians as Michael Prestwich and Seymour Phillips have argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> nature of the English royal court would have made it unlikely that any homosexual affairs would have remained discreet; neither the contemporary Church, Edward's father nor his father-in-law appear to have made any adverse comments about Edward's sexual behaviour.|$|E
5|$|Belle Vue was {{the first}} privately financed zoo in England, and grew to become the third-largest in the UK.

The initial collection had consisted of domestic birds and a few exotic parrots, but Jennison probably also acquired those animals that could not be sold after the Manchester Zoological Gardens closed in 1842. By 1856, the Jennisons had added kangaroos, rhinos, lions, bears and gazelles.|$|E
5|$|Diệm's {{government}} put Ba Cụt on trial. During the proceedings, Ba Cụt theatrically {{removed his}} shirt so <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> gallery {{could see how}} many scars he had suffered while fighting the communists. This, according to him, demonstrated his devotion to Vietnamese nationalism. He challenged any other man to show as many scars. The Diệmist judge was unimpressed. Ba Cụt {{was found guilty of}} multiple murders and sentenced to death. Diệm's adviser, Colonel Edward Lansdale from the CIA, was one of many who protested against the decision. Lansdale felt that the execution would tarnish Diệm—who had proclaimed the Republic of Vietnam (commonly known as South Vietnam) and declared himself President—and antagonise Ba Cụt's followers. Ngô Đình Nhu, Diệm's younger brother and chief adviser, denied a reprieve as the army, particularly Minh, opposed any clemency. Some sections of the southern public, however, were sympathetic to Ba Cụt.|$|E

5|$|In 2004 the Public Roads Administration {{published}} a report documenting high administration {{costs in the}} 46 toll companies throughout the country. Along with the company for the Osterøy Bridge, SBT received the harshest criticism in the report. Especially a trip made by Chairman Harry Herstad and his wife to San Francisco to participate at a conference was criticized, as it cost the toll company NOK118,000. Also annual board member fees of NOK200,000 and excessive trips for the board were commented as wasted money. The internal audit concluded with that there were costs of NOK300,000 in 2002 and 2003 which were not properly documented or were not used in line with regulations. The report {{was rejected by the}} board, who claimed that several of the issues were misunderstandings and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Public</b> Roads Administration was using the report in a campaign to establish a state-run toll collection agency. Øyvind Halleraker withdrew as managing director of SBT and as chairman of the Norwegian Road Financing Companies Association in January 2005.

5|$|In 2007, the ARF {{announced}} that it would nominate its own candidate to run for president of Armenia in the February 2008 presidential election. In an innovation on November 24–25, 2007, the ARF conducted a non-binding Armenia-wide primary election. They invited the public to vote to advise the party which of two candidates, Vahan Hovhannisyan and Armen Rustamyan, they should formally nominate for president of Armenia in the subsequent official election. What characterized it as a primary instead of a standard opinion poll was <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> knew of the primary in advance, all eligible voters were invited, and the voting was by secret ballot. Nearly 300,000 people voted in makeshift tents and mobile ballot boxes. Vahan Hovhannisyan received the most votes and was subsequently nominated for the presidential election by the ARF Supreme Council in a secret ballot. In the presidential election, Hovhannisyan placed fourth with 6.2% of the vote. In 2008, ARF re-joined the ruling political coalition in Armenia and supported strong police actions during the 2008 Armenian presidential election protests that led to ten deaths.|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom, the House of Lords {{has held}} {{that the nature of}} the {{decision-making}} process <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> authority is required to engage in determines whether a matter falls into the precedent fact category.

On the other hand, where an administrative decision interferes with an individual's liberty, the matter will be considered within the precedent fact category unless Parliament has explicitly excluded judicial review. If Parliament intends to do so, it must make its meaning crystal clear.|$|E
