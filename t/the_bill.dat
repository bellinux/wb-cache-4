5|$|After the Committee's {{first and}} second reports were considered, the Lords passed <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> 221 to 81 on 26 October 1999. During the session, Earl of Burford, son of the Duke of St Albans, {{launched}} a protest at the constitutional implications of <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> from the Woolsack, and was ejected from the chamber. Once the Lords settled the differences between their version of <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> and the Commons version thereof, <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> received Royal Assent on 11 November 1999 and became an Act of parliament. The Act then came into force the same day.|$|E
5|$|As regards a bill {{mentioned}} in paragraph 1, the President, acting {{in accordance with}} the advice of the Cabinet, may refer to a Constitutional Tribunal the question of whether <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> circumvents or curtails the discretionary powers conferred on him or her by the Constitution. If the Tribunal is of the opinion that <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> does not have this effect, the President is deemed to have assented to <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> on the day after the day when the Tribunal's opinion is pronounced in open court. On the other hand, if the Tribunal feels that <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> does have the circumventing or curtailing effect, and the President either has withheld or withholds his assent to <b>the</b> <b>bill,</b> the Prime Minister may direct that <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> be submitted to the electors for a national referendum. In that case, <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> only becomes law if it is supported by not less than two-thirds {{of the total number of}} votes cast at the referendum. If 30 days have expired after a bill has been presented to the President for assent and he or she has neither signified the withholding of assent nor referred <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> to a Constitutional Tribunal, <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> is deemed to have been assented to on the day following the expiry of the 30-day period. The procedure is similar for a bill {{mentioned in}} paragraph 2, except that if the Constitutional Tribunal rules that <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> has a circumventing or curtailing effect, the Prime Minister has no power to put <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> to a referendum. This ensures that changes to the President's discretionary powers can only be made by way of constitutional amendments and not ordinary statutes.|$|E
5|$|Emanuel Celler (D-NY), Chair of the House Judiciary Committee, {{introduced}} the Voting Rights Act in the House of Representatives on March 19, 1965 as H.R. 6400. The House Judiciary Committee {{was the first}} committee to consider <b>the</b> <b>bill.</b> The committee's ranking Republican, William McCulloch (R-OH), generally supported expanding voting rights, but he opposed both the poll tax ban and the coverage formula, and he led opposition to <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> in committee. The committee eventually approved <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> on May 12, {{but it did not}} file its committee report until June 1. <b>The</b> <b>bill</b> included two amendments from subcommittee: a penalty for private persons who interfered with the right to vote, and a prohibition of all poll taxes. The poll tax prohibition gained Speaker of the House John McCormack's support. <b>The</b> <b>bill</b> was next considered by the Rules Committee, whose chair, Howard W. Smith (D-VA), opposed <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> and delayed its consideration until June 24, when Celler initiated proceedings to have <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> discharged from committee. Under pressure from the bill's proponents, Smith allowed <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> to be released a week later, and the full House started debating <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> on July 6.|$|E
50|$|The Patriots stay at {{home for}} a matchup against <b>the</b> Tyrod Taylor-led <b>Bills.</b> On <b>the</b> first play of scrimmage, Brissett hit Edelman on a 90-yard catch-and-run to <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> 1, but <b>the</b> play was nullified by a holding penalty on former Buffalo Bills player, Chris Hogan. The Patriots didnt get a first down and punted. Starting from their own 35, <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> marched 65 yards in over 7 minutes, scoring on a 7-yard {{touchdown}} pass from Taylor to LeSean McCoy. After a Patriots three-and-out, <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> marched to <b>the</b> Patriots 16, but settled for Dan Carpenters 34-yard field goal on the second play of the second quarter, making the score 10-0. After forcing the Patriots to punt, <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> drove 71 yards and Carpenter ended the drive with a 43-yard field goal, extending the lead to 13-0. The Patriots drove {{all the way to}} <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> 18 on their ensuing possession, but Brissett was strip-sacked by Zach Brown with Preston Brown recovering for <b>the</b> <b>Bills.</b> Starting at their own 9, <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> drove to their own 42, but punted. The Patriots punted as well, and <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> led 13-0 at halftime. After forcing <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> to punt on the opening drive, the Patriots drove to <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> 30, but Gostkowski missed a 48-yard field goal. <b>The</b> <b>Bills</b> countered, reaching <b>the</b> Patriots 29, but then Carpenter missed a 47-yard field goal. After yet another Patriots punt, Ben Tate returned the punt 18 yards to <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> 30. <b>The</b> <b>Bills</b> reached <b>the</b> Patriots 26, and Carpenter nailed a 44-yard field goal stretching the score to 16-0. Midway through the fourth quarter, the Patriots drove all the way to <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> 21, but turned the ball over on downs. After a <b>Bills</b> punt, <b>the</b> Patriots reached <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> 44, but <b>the</b> clock ran out. With the loss the Patriots fell to 3-1.|$|R

5|$|If the Council {{does make}} an adverse report, Parliament may amend <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> to rid it of any {{differentiating}} measures before sending {{it back to}} the Council for inspection. The MP having charge of <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> may give two clear days' notice of the amendments he or she proposes to move in Parliament to the provisions of <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> that were adversely reported upon by the Council. <b>The</b> <b>bill</b> then stands recommitted to a committee of the whole Parliament on those provisions, and the proposed amendments are considered. Parliament then resumes, and the MP having charge of <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> reports whether the amendments were agreed to by the committee. If so, the MP moves that the amended bill should be resubmitted to the Council. There is uncertainty as to whether the Council will have to make another report within any time limit, or if <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> will then be directly presented to the President for assent.|$|E
5|$|In 1906, Roosevelt {{backed the}} Hepburn Bill, {{imposing}} railroad regulation. Many Republicans initially {{wanted nothing to}} do with <b>the</b> <b>bill,</b> and Senate Republican leader Nelson Aldrich entrusted management of <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> to Tillman. Aldrich hoped the outspoken South Carolinian would cause the defeat of <b>the</b> <b>bill.</b> To Aldrich's surprise, Tillman soberly and competently conducted <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> through much of the legislative process. Tillman withdrew from <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> (though he voted for it) after Roosevelt got a provision for federal court review of agency decisions included, which Tillman opposed. The president and the southern senator ended on worse terms than before, but there was great public attention on the Hepburn Bill, and Tillman gained considerable respect for his role.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to Majority Leader Gary Hooser's {{statement that he}} intended to bring <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> to a vote before the full Senate, the Hawaii Family Forum stated other issues demanded more attention than civil unions and <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> would create legal challenges for child care and education. The group held demonstrations on Maui and Kauai and stated their intention to hold demonstrations to ask the governor to veto the legislation should <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> advance. Hooser argued for <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> using President Barack Obama's support of civil unions and the support of labor unions and the majority of Hawaii House representatives. The Honolulu Advertiser reported that Senate President Colleen Hanabusa privately told senators <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> could lead to a lawsuit to legalize same-sex marriage. The American Civil Liberties Union of Hawaii and Supreme Court of Hawaii judge Steven H. Levinson told the legislature that a lawsuit would have little chance of success.|$|E
50|$|On November 20, 2010, <b>the</b> Buffalo <b>Bills</b> called Caulcrick up {{from the}} {{practice}} squad.

5|$|Labour again {{brought their}} bill {{before the new}} house on 31 October 2007 but the Government again voted <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> down.

The Government committed itself to introducing its own bill for registered civil partnerships by 31 March 2008, a date it failed to meet.|$|E
5|$|Minton {{was pleased}} with Roosevelt's bill and quickly became its leading {{supporter}} in the Senate. The measure was placed in an omnibus bill designed to reform judicial salaries and districting, among many other measures. Republicans quickly discovered the court-packing provision and targeted <b>the</b> <b>bill.</b> Democrats had overwhelming super-majorities in Congress, and passage of <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> at first seemed assured. Minton's support of <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> helped him earn the position of Senate majority whip, allowing him to more effectively push for its passage. Minton delivered six radio addresses {{on behalf of his}} party in support of <b>the</b> <b>bill,</b> but public opinion could not be swayed in the Democrats' favor.|$|E
5|$|On October 3, 1945, <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> was {{introduced}} in the House of Representatives by Congressman Andrew J.

May immediately had <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> referred to the Military Affairs Committee, which held hearings on October 9. Bush, Conant and Groves all testified before the committee. But in the Senate Military Affairs Committee, <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> was held up by Senator Arthur H. Vandenberg.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Bills</b> drafted future Hall of Fame quarterback Jim Kelly, {{the third}} of a record six quarterbacks taken {{in the first round}} of the 1983 draft.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Bills</b> took <b>the</b> opening kickoff {{and raced}} 80 yards, {{aided by a}} 43-yard pass from Orton to Sammy Watkins, scoring on a 6-yard pass from Orton Robert Woods barely three minutes into the game. After both teams punted, the Patriots {{engineered}} a 13 play, 80-yard drive marching {{all the way to}} <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> 6, but <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> defense held them to a 24-yard field goal from Stephen Gostkowski. <b>The</b> <b>Bills</b> countered with an 80-yard drive, covering 13 plays in seven-and-a-half minutes, scoring on a 1-yard touchdown run from Anthony Dixon a few minutes into the second quarter, extending the lead to 14-3. Following a Patriots three-and-out, Jamie Collins strip-sacked Orton and recovered it at <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> 44. <b>The</b> Patriots drove to <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> 26, and Gostkowski kicked a 44-yard field goal and the score read 14-6. <b>The</b> <b>Bills</b> answered again though. Marcus Thigpen returned the ensuing kickoff 49 yards to the Patriots 47. <b>The</b> <b>Bills</b> only reached <b>the</b> Patriots 30, but Dan Carpenter was good on a 48-yard field goal, increasing <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> lead to 17-6 at halftime. Jimmy Garoppolo took over for Brady in the second half. After the first two drives of the second half ended in punts, the Patriots marched 70 yards, using 11 plays in over 6 minutes to <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> 13, but <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> stuffed Garoppolo for a 1-yard loss on 4th-and-1. The Patriots forced <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> to punt on their next drive, and Amendola returned <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> punt 26 yards to <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> 44. After a 20-yard pass to LaFell the Patriots were unable to get another first down, but Gostkowski hit a 35-yard field goal, trimming the score to 17-9. <b>The</b> <b>Bills</b> drove to <b>the</b> Patriots 43 on their next possession, but punted. The Patriots reached <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> 30, but Brandon Bolden was stuffed for a 1-yard loss and Garoppolo was sacked for a 15-yard loss by Manny Lawson and Jerry Hughes, bringing up a 3rd-and-26. Garoppolo completed an 18-yard pass to Tyms, making it a manageable 4th-and-8, but the catch was nullified by a holding call on Marcus Cannon, making it 3rd-and-36. Garoppolo completed a 15-yard pass to Wright, but the Patriots decided to punt rather than try and convert a 4th-and-21. <b>The</b> <b>Bills</b> drove to <b>the</b> Patriots 41, but the Patriots forced another punt. Back-to-back completions to James White brought up a 3rd-and-2, but back-to-back incompletions resulted in a turnover on downs and two knees gave <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> <b>the</b> win.|$|R

5|$|The Honolulu Advertiser {{reported}} that the Senate Democratic leadership reconsidered their support for <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> {{because of the large}} demonstration of opponents and their pressure on senators to oppose <b>the</b> <b>bill.</b> It found that some senators privately suggested the bill's delay in committee or a proposed amendment to <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> were ways to avoid taking a vote following the controversy.|$|E

In the fourth quarter, <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> drew closer as Lindell kicked a 24-yarder, along with a 33-yard field goal. Later, <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> got into position to kick a 51-yard field goal. They got the kick, but Head Coach Joe Gibbs called timeout. When <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> tried to kick again, Gibbs called timeout again, but unintentionally got his team an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty which not only moved <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> 15 yards closer to their end zone but reduced Lindell's field goal attempt to 36 yards. Afterwards, <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> ended <b>the</b> game with Lindell nailing the game-winning 36-yard field goal.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>bill</b> {{was carried}} over into the 2010 session and Lingle stated in January 2010 that <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> was a {{distraction}} from the budget {{and should not be}} voted on for final passage in the Senate. Senator Brian Taniguchi argued the legislature could work on several issues simultaneously and <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> would pass. If passed, the amended bill would have to be approved by the House of Representatives. Speaker of the House Calvin Say stated that a vote on <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> would depend on whether the Senate passed <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> with enough votes to override a gubernatorial veto, arguing that {{he does not want to}} force a vote on controversial legislation in an election year if the bill's approval was in doubt.

5|$|When Article 5A {{is brought}} into force, the President will {{also be able to}} decline to assent to a bill seeking to amend the Constitution that has a direct or {{indirect}} effect of circumventing or curtailing his discretionary powers.
