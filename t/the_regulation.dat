40|$|Abstract Background In {{order to}} comply with the {{provisions}} of the North American Free Trade Agreement, in 1993 the Canadian federal government introduced the Patented Medicine Notice of Compliance Linkage Regulations. These regulations were meant to achieve a balance between the timely entry of generic medicines and the rights of patent holders. <b>The</b> <b>regulations</b> tied <b>the</b> regulatory approval of generic medicines to the patent status of the original brand-name product. Discussion Since their introduction <b>the</b> <b>regulations</b> have been a source of contention between the generic and the brand-name industry. While <b>the</b> <b>regulations</b> have generated a considerable amount of work for the Federal Court of Canada both sides dispute the interpretation of the "win rate" in the court cases. Similarly, there is no agreement on whether multiple patents on single drugs represent a legitimate activity by the brand-name industry or an "evergreening" tactic. The generic industry's position is that <b>the</b> <b>regulations</b> are being abused leading to the delay in the introduction of lower cost generic products by as much as 8 years. The brand-name companies counter that <b>the</b> <b>regulations</b> are necessary because injunctions against the introduction of generic products are frequently unavailable to them. <b>The</b> <b>regulations</b> were amended in 2006 and again in 2008 but both sides continue to claim that <b>the</b> <b>regulations</b> favour <b>the</b> other party. The battle around <b>the</b> <b>regulations</b> also has an international dimension with interventions by PhRMA, the trade association representing the United States based multinational companies, arguing that <b>the</b> <b>regulations</b> are not stringent enough and that Canada needs to be placed on the U. S. Priority Watch List of countries. Finally, there are multiple costs to Canadian society as a result of <b>the</b> NOC <b>regulations.</b> Summary Despite <b>the</b> rhetoric there has been almost no empiric academic research done into the effect of <b>the</b> <b>regulations.</b> In order to develop rational policy in this area a number of key research questions have been formulated. </p...|$|R
