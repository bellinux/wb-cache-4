5|$|Despite being {{considered}} dissipated, a re-analysis of satellite imagery indicated <b>the</b> <b>circulation</b> <b>of</b> Olaf persisted as {{turned to the}} west toward open waters. Early on September 30, the system reached the Pacific, and it continued westward for about a week, during which it retained some convective activity. On October 5, Olaf turned toward the east, as it interacted with the large circulation of developing Hurricane Pauline. Later that day, the NHC resumed issuing advisories, while it was located about 560 miles (900km) southwest of {{the southern tip of}} the Baja California Peninsula. The system turned to the southeast, and, failing to organize, the NHC discontinued advisories on October 8. Three days later, after the remnants of Olaf turned toward the north, the NHC again resumed advisories, when it was just 70 miles (115km) south-southwest of Tecomán, Colima. Late on October 12, <b>the</b> <b>circulation</b> <b>of</b> Olaf made its final landfall near Manzanillo, Colima, and it quickly dissipated.

5|$|On December 4 Nina {{had reached}} its peak {{intensity}} of 85mph. At this time, a polar high pressure system moved {{off the coast of}} Japan.

5|$|Philippe moved {{farther north}} {{skirting}} the low {{and continued to}} weaken gradually. The official forecast did not predict this, primarily {{as a result of}} some models indicating a reintensification to hurricane status.

5|$|A fairly {{peculiar}} economic phenomenon {{occurred during}} the war in that the Confederate government issued both regular money notes and interest-bearing money, although the United States did issue Interest Bearing Notes during the war that were legal tender for most financial transactions. <b>The</b> <b>circulation</b> <b>of</b> the interest-bearing money and the convertibility of one kind of money into the other was enforced by fiat and Southern banks were threatened with a return to the gold standard if they did not cooperate. Because of the amount of Southern debt held by foreigners, to ease currency convertibility, in 1863 the Confederate Congress decided to adopt the gold standard, although actual convertibility was not to come into effect until 1879 (hence the law never went into effect, being supplanted by the Coinage Act of 1873 {{and the end of the}} Confederacy).|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} {{wave that}} exited {{the coast of}} Africa on August 15, 1964, moved westward, not organizing into a tropical depression until around 890miles (1432.3km) east of Barbados on August 20–as reported by a Navy reconnaissance plane. It continued west-northwestward, quickly strengthening to a hurricane {{the next day with}} a minimum central pressure of 993mb. Early in the afternoon of August 22, Cleo crossed Guadeloupe as a 115mph (185km/h) Category3 hurricane. The hurricane continued to strengthen as it moved through the Caribbean Sea and reached its peak intensity of 155mph (250km/h) on the August 23 while south of the Dominican Republic. It maintained that intensity for a day, bringing heavy rain and winds to Hispaniola. As Cleo passed south of Haiti on August 24, it veered northward momentarily, enough {{to move on to the}} Southwest Peninsula of Haiti. <b>The</b> <b>circulation</b> <b>of</b> the hurricane was greatly disrupted by the mountainous terrain of the island, quickly weakening the hurricane.|$|E
5|$|As Debbie {{approached}} the northern Gulf Coast, {{it failed to}} intensify, despite warm sea surface temperatures, abundant moisture, and an anticyclone aloft. In addition, the storm never developed good outflow, partially due to stable air related to Tropical Storm Hazel in the eastern Pacific Ocean. After maintaining peak winds for about 12hours, Debbie weakened due to cooler, drier air, deteriorating to a tropical depression on September29. That day, it turned to the northwest, passing {{just east of the}} Mississippi Delta. On September30, <b>the</b> <b>circulation</b> <b>of</b> Debbie dissipated just offshore Mississippi. Its remnants made landfall, accelerated northeastward, and were eventually absorbed by an extratropical cyclone.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Lorenzo quickly {{developed}} a closed eyewall, which was observed on radar {{and provided a}} peak intensity estimate of 80mph (130km/h) at 0000UTC on September28. The cyclone maintained vigorous and symmetric convection across the center, although the structure deteriorated slightly before Lorenzo crossed the coast near Tecolutla, Veracruz at 0500UTC that day, with winds estimated around 75mph (120km/h). After making landfall, the hurricane rapidly weakened to tropical depression intensity. Progressing inland, the circulation became difficult to locate as the convection diminished to rainbands along the coast. Within 19hours after moving ashore, <b>the</b> <b>circulation</b> <b>of</b> Lorenzo dissipated, therefore ending its duration as a tropical cyclone.|$|E

5|$|In 1695 Parliament {{failed to}} renew the Licensing Acts, and as a result, the press were free to print {{material}} attacking the government. Although there were eight attempts to force a new Licensing Act through Parliament between 1697 and 1713, none of them succeeded. Despite {{the freedom of the}} press from censorship by the government, the judiciary held a different view; it regularly tried people for seditious libel if they printed material attacking the government. From 21 November 1768, letters written by a man under the pseudonym of Junius were published in the Public Advertiser, a London newspaper run by Henry Sampson Woodfall. In them, Junius attacked many political leaders, including Lord Granby and Mansfield.

5|$|Late on October23, Alpha made {{landfall}} in Hispaniola, quickly decreasing {{in intensity}} {{as it did}} so. After making landfall, the storm weakened, leaving it just between tropical storm and tropical depression status. Because of the weakening, and the strong southerly flow from nearby Hurricane Wilma, {{it was hard to}} determine whether a low-level circulation was present. However, satellite imagery suggested that a new center had developed over open waters to the north of Hispaniola. It was downgraded to a tropical depression early the next day, now re-emerging over open waters. The storm soon developed an elongated center of circulation which indicated that the system was weakening. On October24 the low-level center had completely dissolved, and only a small area of convective activity persisted. Thus the system had dissipated, and was a remnant low pressure system when the National Hurricane Center issued their last advisories of Alpha. Shortly thereafter, the remnant low was absorbed into <b>the</b> <b>circulation</b> <b>of</b> Hurricane Wilma on October25.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo's dissections and {{documentation}} of muscles, nerves, and vessels helped {{to describe the}} physiology and mechanics of movement.

He made the observations that humours were not located in cerebral spaces or ventricles. He documented that the humours were not contained in the heart or the liver, and that it was the heart that defined the circulatory system.

5|$|On September 13, {{despite being}} in an {{extremely}} hostile environment with very high wind shear, convection redeveloped {{near the center of}} Fred, and regeneration into a tropical cyclone was seen as a possibility.

On September16, <b>the</b> <b>circulation</b> <b>of</b> Fred became less defined and only intermittent convection persisted around the system. By September17, the remnant circulation became increasingly disorganized and the system dissipated later that day without regenerating into a tropical cyclone. However, several hours later, a new area of low pressure formed in association with the remnants of Fred roughly 525mi (845km) south of Bermuda. The remnant low finally dissipated on September19, roughly 520mi (835km) southwest of Bermuda.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the food}} is in the {{digestive}} cavity, gland cells in the gastroderm release enzymes that reduce the prey to slurry, usually within a few hours. This circulates through the digestive cavity and, in colonial cnidarians, through the connecting tunnels, so that gastroderm cells can absorb the nutrients. Absorption may take a few hours, and digestion within the cells may take a few days. <b>The</b> <b>circulation</b> <b>of</b> nutrients is driven by water currents produced by cilia in the gastroderm or by muscular movements or both, so that nutrients reach {{all parts of the}} digestive cavity.
