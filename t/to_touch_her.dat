5|$|In {{the waiting}} room outside the morgue, the doctor tells Buffy that Joyce died of an {{aneurysm}} suddenly and painlessly. Left alone with Buffy, Tara tells her that her own mother {{died when she was}} 17 and she went through something similar. Dawn goes alone to the morgue to see Joyce's body. While she is there, one of the bodies, now a vampire, gets up. After noticing Dawn has not come back, Buffy goes to look for her and finds her in the morgue, being attacked by the vampire. As Buffy fights and kills the vampire, the sheet falls from Joyce's face. Looking at her mother, Dawn asks where she went, as she reaches out <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>her</b> cheek.|$|E
5|$|Rose and Pete {{drive to}} the wedding together, and the car that had been meant to kill Pete appears and nearly collides with their car. They join the other guests, {{including}} Jackie who has brought the infant Rose with her. Rose is {{surprised to find that}} Jackie and Pete argue frequently. A young Mickey runs in to warn the guests about the Reapers, who think it is a joke until a Reaper appears above and attacks them. The Doctor runs to the church and directs everyone inside, noting that the age of the church will protect them against the Reapers. The Doctor explains to Rose that her actions have caused a paradox that normally the Time Lords would have prevented. Without them, the Reapers are sterilising the wound in time by consuming everyone within it. The Doctor further warns Rose not <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>her</b> infant self, as it could cause further damage to time and allow the Reapers into the church. Feeling that his TARDIS key is still warm, the Doctor sets it {{up in the middle of}} the church and the TARDIS slowly begins materialising around it.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) {{has started}} {{spending}} more time with Cathy Simms (Lindsey Broad) because Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker) keeps trying to rope Jim into having an affair. During the night at the hotel, Cathy asks to hang out for a while in Jim's room under the pretext that the heat in her room is malfunctioning. She repeatedly makes seductive signals, making Jim uncomfortable, so he calls Dwight saying he has bed bugs. Dwight arrives and forces Cathy off Jim's bed so he can lure out the bed bugs with his nearly naked body. This fails to sufficiently disgust Cathy, who merely steps into the bathroom to take a shower until Dwight leaves. Cathy gets out of the shower wearing only a bath robe. After ordering some desserts from room service and asking Jim <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>her</b> legs, he finally comes out saying that he is happily married, and {{does not want to be}} with her. Cathy gets defensive and insists that she did not have any romantic intentions whatsoever, so Jim relents, but Cathy immediately resumes her seductive technique. After Jim goes to the bathroom, he comes out to find her in only her underwear under his blanket. Fed up, he demands that she leave and lets Dwight, armed with spray chemicals, into the room. Jim claims to see a bed bug near Cathy, making her flee from Dwight's spraying. However, because of the chemicals, Dwight suggests Jim sleep in Cathy's room. Jim instead spends the night with Dwight in his room, eating Cathy's desserts and watching TV, while a drunken Nellie is outside, trying unsuccessfully to get in.|$|E

25|$|In Harlan's model, {{having made}} the holy vow to burn herself {{transforms}} {{the woman to}} a sativrata, a transitional stage between {{the living and the}} dead, before ascending the funeral pyre. Once a woman committed herself to become sati, popular belief thought her to become endowed with many supernatural powers. Lourens P. Van Den Bosch enumerates some of them. The sati would gain the powers of prophecy and clairvoyance, as well as the ability to bless women with sons, who had not borne sons before. The gifts from a sati were venerated as valuable relics, and in her journey to the pyre, people would seek <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>her</b> garments to benefit from her powers.|$|E

25|$|Egg-laying {{is done by}} {{bringing}} the abdomen close to the mouthparts where the pap is being held. The female holds her front legs up and open and appears to use them <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>her</b> abdomen. Her antennae are completely still and her wings are closed during the operation. Then her abdomen begins to vibrate, and her sting is turned inside and out and folded backwards. During this process, the egg is expelled and placed directly on the pap that the female is holding in her mouth. She does not touch it with her legs at all. Then her abdomen relaxes and the female places the egg inside the cell. The average length of the eggs laid by L. vechti is 1.36mm, and ovarian eggs are considered ready to be laid once they reach 1.16mm.|$|E
25|$|From {{the start}} Genie showed {{interest}} in many hospital staff members, often approaching and walking with complete strangers, but Kent {{said she did}} not seem to distinguish between people and showed no signs of attachment to anybody, including her mother and brother. At first she would not allow anyone <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>her,</b> quickly shying away from any physical contact, and while she sat on her mother's lap when requested she remained very tense and got up as quickly as possible; hospital staff wrote that her mother seemed entirely oblivious to Genie's emotions and actions. Genie's behavior was typically highly antisocial, and proved extremely difficult for others to control. Regardless of where she was she constantly salivated and spat, and continually sniffed and blew her nose on anything that happened to be nearby. She had no sense of personal property, frequently pointing to or taking something she wanted from someone else, or situational awareness. Doctors wrote that she acted on impulse irrespective of the setting, especially noting that she frequently engaged in open masturbation and would sometimes attempt to involve older men in it.|$|E

[...] Lulu had Patty Cake in her arms and when Patty reached in between the narrow bars <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>her</b> father, Lulu suddenly pulled her away. [...] But Patty's arm got caught in the narrow bars and broke. [...] It was a freak accident. [...] No one ever realized that those bars were narrow enough to catch that tiny arm.|$|E

[...] Later, he mimics Carey's bridge: [...] "If some honies up in here that want me <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>her</b> body / Touch it / Let me hear you say, 'I-i-i-i do.'"

500|$|The Kedara Khanda {{chapter of}} the Skanda Purana {{presents}} a very different version. In this version, after the burning of Kama, Parvati is worried {{that she could not}} achieve Shiva in absence of Kama. Parvati is consoled by Rati, who asserts that she will revive Kama and starts severe austerities to achieve her goal. Once, the divine sage Narada asks her [...] "whose she was". Agitated, Rati insults Narada. The spiteful Narada provokes the demon Sambara to kidnap Rati. Sambara takes her to his house, but is unable <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>her</b> as the goddess decreed that he would be reduced to ashes if he touches her. There, Rati becomes the [...] "kitchen in-charge" [...] and is known as Mayavati ("mistress of illusion – Maya").|$|E
500|$|In the video, Dev {{is seen in}} a club {{scene with}} intense dancing. The main focus is black-painted hands and arms, which are {{prominent}} in several shots of Dev as she is standing naked while the hands are touching her body. Some of the hands were digitally added, {{but the majority of}} them were real, including the ones touching Dev. She explained, [...] "The extras were amazing, they let me paint their hands and bodies, and they stacked {{on top of each other}} and did that for hours. For takes and takes and takes." [...] The video also includes shots of an albino ball python and a tarantula. Cory Lamz of Westword wrote a positive review of the video: [...] "Watching 'In the Dark' is like dancing under a strobe light on ecstasy. In a sea of hands, literally, Dev manages to tease you, seduce you and entice you. She makes you want <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>her,</b> just like every other hand in the video." [...] Contessa Gayles of AOL Music referred the video to as [...] "freaky" [...] and [...] "funky", writing [...] "Forget 'dancing in the dark,' Dev works it in a sea of dismembered, black-painted hands and arms in this freaky, funky new vid." [...] In contrast, Becky Bain of Idolator called it [...] "somewhat unsettling".|$|E

500|$|As {{shown in}} [...] "The Impossible Astronaut", the Doctor joins his friends at Lake Silencio and then {{approaches}} the astronaut, now {{known to be}} a younger version of River Song, Amy and Rory's daughter, trained to kill the Doctor by the Silence and Madame Kovarian. River does not want to kill him but is unable to fight the suit's control, and the Doctor says he forgives her and reminds her that the event is inevitable. River, despite his warning against interfering with a fixed point, surprises the Doctor by draining the astronaut suit's weapons systems and averting his death. Time becomes [...] "stuck" [...] as a result and begins to disintegrate; all of Earth's history begins to run simultaneously at a fixed moment of 5:02p.m. on 22 April 2011. In London, Holy Roman Emperor Winston Churchill takes the Doctor, his [...] "soothsayer", out from his locked cell to ask him about the condition of time. The Doctor explains the preceding events, as tally marks begin appearing on his arms, indicating the presence of the Silence. After noticing a Silence nest overhead, they are rescued by Amy and a squad of soldiers under her command. Due to the effects of the crack in her bedroom, Amy is cognizant of the altered timeline, though she is unaware that her trusted captain is her husband Rory. Amy takes the Doctor to [...] "Area 52", a hollowed-out Giza pyramid, where they have captured over a hundred Silence and Madame Kovarian. River is also there; aware of the consequences of her actions, she refuses to allow the Doctor <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>her,</b> an event that would [...] "unfreeze" [...] time and allow it to resume. They all wear [...] "eyedrives", external memory eye patches which enable them to avoid the Silence's effect of erasing themselves from memory.|$|E

He also advised women wishing to abort their pregnancies to engage in energetic walking, carrying heavy objects, riding animals, and jumping so that the woman's heels were <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>her</b> buttocks with each jump, which he described as the [...] "Lacedaemonian Leap." [...] He also offered a number of recipes for herbal bathes, rubs, and pessaries. In De Materia Medica Libri Quinque, the Greek pharmacologist Dioscorides listed the ingredients of a draught called [...] "abortion wine"– hellebore, squirting cucumber, and scammony– but failed to provide the precise manner in which it was to be prepared.

[...] These characteristics are used in a courtship [...] "dance" [...] in which the colored or iridescent {{parts of the body}} are displayed. [...] In addition to the display of hairs, jumping spiders perform complex sideling, vibrational, or zigzag movements to attract females. [...] If receptive to the male, the female will assume a passive, crouching position. [...] It has also recently been discovered that many males have auditory signals as well. [...] These amplified sounds presented to the females resemble buzzes or drum rolls. [...] In some species, the female may also vibrate her palps or abdomen.
