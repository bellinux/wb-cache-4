40|$|Increasing {{prominence}} {{is given}} to the role of optimization in engineering. The global optimization problem is in particular frequently studied, since this difficult optimization problem is in general intractable. As a result, many a solution technique have been proposed for the global optimization problem, e. g. random searches, evolutionary computation algorithms, <b>taboo</b> <b>searches,</b> fractional programming, etc. This study is concerned with the recently proposed zero-order evolutionary computation algorithm known as the particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSOA). The following issues are addressed: 1. It is remarked that implementation subtleties due to ambiguous notation have resulted in two distinctly different implementations of the PSOA. While the behavior of the respective implementations is markedly different, they only differ in the formulation of the velocity updating rule. In this thesis, these two implementations are denoted by PSOAF 1 and PSOAF 2 respectively. 2. It is shown that PSOAF 1 is observer independent, but the particle search trajectories collapse to line searches in n-dimensional space. In turn, for PSOAF 2 it is shown that the particle trajectories are space filling in n-dimensional space, but this implementation suffers from observer dependence. It is also shown that some popular heuristics are possibly of less importance than originally thought; their greatest contribution is to prevent the collapse of particle trajectories to line searches. 3. A novel PSOA formulation, denoted PSOAF 1 * is then introduced, in which the particle trajectories do not collapse to line searches, while observer independence is preserved. However, the observer independence is only satisfied in a stochastic sense, i. e. the mean objective function value over a large number of runs is independent of the reference frame. Objectivity and effectiveness of the three different formulations are quantified using a popular unimodal and multimodal test set, of which some of the multimodal functions are decomposable. However, the objective functions are evaluated in both the unrotated, decomposable reference frame, and an arbitrary rotated reference frame. 4. Finally, a practical engineering optimization problem is studied. The PSOA is used to find the optimal shape of a cantilever beam. The objective is to find the minimum vertical displacement at the edge point of the cantilever beam. In order to calculate the objective function the finite element method is used. The meshes needed for the linear elastic finite element analysis are generated using an unstructured remeshing strategy. The remeshing strategy is based on a truss structure analogy.

As an {{adolescent}} child, Topaz {{was found by}} the sorcerer Taboo, who was living in an Indian prison camp at the time. Also living in the prison camp, the locals feared the girl and called her a witch, as {{she was able to}} magically create flowers, move things with her mind and cause things to disappear. Wishing to use her abilities to his own ends, Taboo adopted her and named her Topaz. He used her as a familiar and taught her several magical spells. Years later, Taboo forced Topaz to use her powerful empathic powers to control the werewolf known as Jack Russell for a time. <b>Taboo</b> was <b>searching</b> for the magical Darkhold tome, of which he believed Jack was in possession. Cast out by Taboo after refusing to kill Russell, Topaz chose to help Jack learn to control his werewolf powers, and also became his lover. She assisted Russell many times, including helping him to learn about his family history and even helping him take on Dracula. However, some time later, Topaz was exploited by Dr. Glitternight, who stole a portion of her soul. Jack's grandmother, Maria Russoff, also once used Topaz' power to raise an army of zombies as part of a mad revenge scheme. Topaz was eventually restored to sanity however, and Maria sacrificed her life once she saw that her actions had placed her grandson in danger. Topaz later used her powers to save Jack's sister, Lissa, from the werewolf curse (which was passed from generation to generation within their family). After discovering what Glitternight had done to her, Topaz fought and defeated the villain, regaining her soul in the process.Topaz also temporarily destroyed the villain known as Mephisto, but the demon-lord's minions managed to trap her in another dimension with a spell that would remove another portion of her soul and rob her of her empathic powers if she ever left that realm. Later, Mephisto was revealed to be alive, and after he was once again destroyed by Franklin Richards of the Fantastic Four, Topaz was freed from her imprisonment. Her soul was eventually restored by Doctor Strange and the alien sorcerer known as Urthona).As Topaz reached the age of 21, her powers reached their full potential, and she used them to heal the wounds of Doctor Strange's loyal servant, Wong. She left Strange's side when he briefly turned to the black magics, but later returned to aid him in his fight against Dormammu.|$|R

40|$|During {{the last}} decades, the flowshop {{sequencing}} problem {{has held the}} attention of many researchers. The flowshop sequencing problem is a production scheduling problem in which each one of N jobs must be processed in the same sequence on each one of M machines. Since Johnson proposed optimal two and three-stage production schedules, many heuristics have been suggested to solve this problem. Complete enumeration, branch and bound techniques or integer programming determine the optimal sequence for very small problems, but efficient heuristics are {{necessary in order to}} solve larger ones. In this thesis two cases of the flowshop problem were dealt with. In the first case the objective was to minimize the maximum completion time of the jobs C_max, whereas in the second case each job was assigned a due date and the objective was to minimize primarily the maximum tardiness and secondary the maximum completion time of the jobs. The computational complexity of the flowshop sequencing problem does not allow the development of computationally fast algorithms which could optimally solve it. In this thesis <b>taboo</b> <b>search</b> techniques were studied and heuristic algorithms were developed to suboptimally solve the flowshop sequencing problem. <b>Taboo</b> <b>search</b> is a simple and flexible method for obtaining good solutions quickly and has been successfully applied to NP-complete problems such as the flowshop problem. The efficience of the method depends on the size of neighborhoods in the search space which are iteratively examined in order to obtain local optimums.

The parametric model of NST presented is intended for real-world application, avoiding simplifications of the design details that compromise the applicability.
