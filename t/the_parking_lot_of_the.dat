5|$|Since {{the closure}} of the X-Files, the FBI has reassigned Mulder to a {{low-level}} wiretap while his former partner, Dana Scully, has returned to teaching at the FBI Academy.

5|$|The {{construction}} of the center cost $1.5 million, contained 1,200 parking spaces, and was anchored by a Country Club Market grocery store. For many years, the mall offered a seasonal shuttle that ferried shoppers around the facilities; this service was discontinued in the late 1990s. The mall did not receive any significant remodeling or renovations until 1980, when four outparcels were constructed in <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mall. The outparcels were housed by several restaurants and a Goodyear location.|$|E
5|$|The Mumbai slum set in {{the season}} finale was {{constructed}} on <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> studio, which took {{two to three weeks}} to complete. The finale was filmed during one of the hottest heatwaves to hit British Columbia; Tapping found that the set was hotter than the average temperature of the actual Mumbai. Three main cameras were used, one of which was crane-operated. 60 extras were used, the highest number used in an Sanctuary episode. For the extras to be used in more than one scene, they wore many different costumes. The streeting area was also limited in size, so the streets were recycled frequently with every scene. The practical sets of the Sanctuary offices and corridors were also redesigned to look like the Mumbai Sanctuary.|$|E

5|$|From {{her medical}} findings, Scully discovers that an alien virus {{is keeping the}} abductees alive long enough to cause a radical {{transformation}} to take place, {{similar to the one}} that Miles experienced. After Scully tells Doggett about the genetic transformation, he visits Absalom, who believes that the abductees are being resurrected into aliens who will eventually conquer Earth. Skinner—torn by his decision—decides to euthanize Mulder by pulling him off of life-support so that Krycek does not get his way. Doggett, however, catches Skinner attempting to remove the support. Skinner explains Krycek's demands, but Doggett argues that both options are unreasonable because either Scully's child will die, or Mulder will succumb to the virus. Doggett tries to locate Krycek in <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> FBI building, but Krycek nearly runs him down with a car, and purposely smashes the vaccine on the ground. Doggett tries to stop him but he escapes. Dejected, Doggett returns to the hospital and tells Skinner he was right not to trust Krycek. He finds Scully preparing Mulder for the now-destroyed vaccine; She tells Doggett that keeping Mulder on life-support was incubating the virus and hastening it along, and that Skinner effectively saved Mulder's life by pulling him off life-support, as it made his temperature drop rapidly without affecting his vital signs. She states that she {{will be able to use}} a combination of antiviral drugs to kill the alien virus if they can get him and his temperature to stabilize.|$|E
