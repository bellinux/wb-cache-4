40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{examine the}} extent to which {{management}} of invasive breast cancer reflected consensus guidelines in the Thames regions in 1990. DESIGN [...] Population based study of case notes. SETTING [...] Thames Cancer Registry. SUBJECTS [...] All women with breast cancer diagnosed in early 1990 (417 cases) resident in the four Thames regions. Hospital records were traced for 346 cases, of which 12 were ineligible because of misclassification in initial registration and were excluded from the analysis. 334 cases were analysed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Investigations and treatment in the six months after diagnosis, stage of disease. RESULTS [...] Of the 334 women identified, 86 were aged under 50. Three years after diagnosis, 74 were dead, seven (8 %) aged under 50 and 67 (27 %) aged 50 or over. Axillary surgery was used <b>to</b> <b>stage</b> <b>cancer</b> in only 155 cases (46 %), although this is recommended in the guidelines. Only 79 (24 %) case notes had any information recorded on stage. Stage could be determined reliably for only half of the sample. Treatment varied widely within the same age group and stage of disease. In particular, chemotherapy was not routinely given to patients under 50 with stage II disease. Only 17 records showed evidence that the patient was participating in a clinical trial. CONCLUSIONS [...] There was a lack of consensus on the management of breast cancer among clinicians in 1990. More patients should be included in clinical trials...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Careful re-evaluation of CT-scans {{for cancer}} staging {{frequently}} reveals unsuspected venous thromboembolism (VTE) on CT-scans. However, {{it is unknown}} how often these findings lead to anticoagulant treatment in daily clinical practice. Methods: Reports from thoracic and/or abdominal CT-scans performed in a consecutive series of patients <b>to</b> <b>stage</b> <b>cancer</b> were retrospectively evaluated to determine the prevalence of incidental venous thromboembolism (iVTE). Presence of pre-existing signs of VTE, anticoagulant treatment and 3 -month follow-up were analysed in patients with iVTE. Results: A total of 1466 staging scans (838 patients) from the year 2006 {{were included in the}} analysis. The prevalence of VTE in patients was 2. 5 % (21 / 838 patients, 95 % confidence interval 1. 6 - 3. 8 %); the prevalence of VTE on scans was 1. 4 % (21 / 1466 scans, 95 % CI 0. 9 - 2. 2 %). Incidental PE or deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was observed in 11 (1. 3 %, 0. 7 - 2. 3 %) and abdominal vein thrombosis in 9 patients (1. 1 %, 0. 6 - 2. 0 %; in the portal (5), mesenteric (3) and renal vein (1), respectively). Nine out of eleven patients with PE/DVT were treated with anticoagulants, while none of the patients with thrombosis in other locations received anticoagulants. One of these patients developed symptomatic PE one month later; otherwise, follow up was uneventful in the untreated patients. Conclusion: The prevalence of iVTE in patients with cancer in clinical practice is relatively low and most patients with PE or DVT are treated with anticoagulants. For patients with thrombi in other locations, further research is necessary to understand the natural history of these thrombi in order to develop adequate guidelines. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Abstract Background Microsatellite {{instability}} (MSI) {{occurs in}} 15 % of colorectal cancers (CRC). The genetic targets for mutation in the MSI phenotype include somatic mutations in the transforming growth factor beta receptor typeII (TGFbetaRII), BAX, hMSH 3 and hMSH 6. It {{is not clear}} how mutations of these genes mediate tumor progression in the MSI pathway, and the temporal sequence of these mutations remains uncertain. In this study, early stage CRCs were examined for frameshift mutations in these target genes, and compared with late stage tumors and CRC cell lines. Methods We investigated 6 CRC cell lines and 71 sporadic CRCs, including 61 early <b>stage</b> <b>cancers</b> and 10 late <b>stage</b> <b>cancers.</b> Mutations of repetitive mononucleotide tracts in the coding regions of TGFbetaRII, BAX, hMSH 3, hMSH 6, IGFIIR and Fas antigen were identified by direct sequencing. Results Thirteen (18. 3 %) of 71 CRC, including 9 / 61 (14. 7 %) early <b>stage</b> <b>cancers</b> and 4 / 10 (40 %) late <b>stage</b> <b>cancers,</b> were identified as MSI and analyzed for frameshift mutations. No mutation in the target genes was observed in any of the 9 early stage MSI CRCs. In contrast, frameshift mutations of TGFbetaRII, BAX, hMSH 3 and hMSH 6 were present in 3 / 4 late stage MSI tumors. There is a statistical association (p = 0. 014) between mutation in any one gene and tumor stage. Conclusions TGFbetaRII, BAX, hMSH 3 and hMSH 6 mutations are relatively late events in the genesis of MSI CRCs. The frameshift mutations in these target genes might mediate progression from early <b>to</b> late <b>stage</b> <b>cancer,</b> rather than mediating the adenoma to carcinoma transition. </p...|$|R

40|$|Current {{clinical}} {{methods for}} cancer diagnosis and therapy have limitations, although survival periods are increasing as medical technologies develop.

Methods: Affinity resin purified and isolated Transferrin and associated bound proteins from normal control and breast cancer patient serum samples were analysed by label-free mass spectrometry during the discovery phase.

Prostate MRI is becoming of central importance in the contemporary management of PCa by improving the detection of clinically significant cancer (csPCa) while minimising overdiagnosis and overtreatment of indolent disease [1]. MRI is gaining acceptance in detecting and localising csPCa lesions, triaging biopsy, guiding targeted biopsy or focal therapy, stratifying the risk before treatment, monitoring patients during active surveillance, planning and choosing surgery or radiation therapy techniques, and assessing recurrence [2 – 8].|$|R
