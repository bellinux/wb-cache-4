By May 22, 2011, it had sold 4,313,680 units ($76,413,043). It failed <b>to</b> <b>crack</b> <b>the</b> 2010 top ten DVDs list in terms of units sold, but reached 10th place on that chart in terms of sales revenue.|$|E
5|$|Before the 2004 season began, the Houston Astros signed Andy Pettitte {{to boost}} their {{starting}} rotation. As a result, Robertson found himself battling with Tim Redding, Jared Fernandez, Carlos Hernández and Brandon Duckworth for the final spot in the rotation. After Roger Clemens was signed as well, the Astros decided before spring training began that Robertson would pitch out of the bullpen for the season. By the end of spring training, Robertson failed <b>to</b> <b>crack</b> <b>the</b> bullpen, and was to be demoted to the Zephyrs. On March 31, just before the season started, the Astros traded Robertson to the Cleveland Indians for Luke Scott and Willy Taveras.|$|E
5|$|The New Englanders {{saw that}} the only {{possible}} place <b>to</b> <b>crack</b> <b>the</b> defences was on the city's northeastern side, where the walls were weakest. Their plan was to land their main force on the Beauport shore east of the Saint Charles River, and have it cross the river in the fleet's boats, along with the field guns. When the landing force was on the heights west of Quebec, the fleet would attack the city and land a second force there. Frontenac had expected the land attack to come from Beauport, and {{the banks of the}} river had already been built up with field fortifications on the southwestern side. He proposed to fight only a skirmishing action there, holding his regulars in reserve for a European-style battle on the open ground west of Quebec.|$|E

5|$|The album Nothing was {{released}} in August 2002, selling 6,525 copies during its first week in the US and reaching No.165 on the Billboard 200. With this album, Meshuggah became the first band {{in the history of}} Nuclear Blast Records <b>to</b> <b>crack</b> <b>the</b> Billboard 200 and also became the first band signed to Nuclear Blast to be reviewed in Rolling Stone magazine. Meshuggah's previous two releases, 1998's Chaosphere and 1995's Destroy Erase Improve, have sold 38,773 and 30,712 copies to that date, respectively. The CD booklet of Nothing has no liner notes, lyrics, or credits, only a hint of one word: ingenting, which is Swedish for nothing. All of this information is available on the CD-ROM. At the end of 2002, the band went on another US tour with Tool and a headlining tour of its own.|$|E
5|$|On 24 January 2000, {{the part}} of the {{radiation}} therapy unit containing the radiation source was acquired by two scrap collectors, who claimed to have bought it from some strangers as scrap metal for resale. They took it home, planning to dismantle it later. On 1 February, the two, together with another two associates, attempted to dismantle the metal part (a 97-kilogram, 42-by-20-centimetre lead cylinder held in a stainless steel casing), which was the unit's source drawer. Using a hammer and chisel, they only managed <b>to</b> <b>crack</b> <b>the</b> welded seam. Two of the men then took the metal piece, along with other scrap metal, to a scrapyard on Soi Wat Mahawong in Phra Pradaeng District, Samut Prakan Province. There they asked a worker at the scrapyard to cut open the cylinder using an oxyacetylene torch. As the cylinder was cut open, two smaller cylindrical metal pieces, which had held the source capsule, fell out. The worker retrieved the two pieces and kept them in the scrapyard, but was unaware of the source capsule itself. The lead cylinder was returned to the scrap collectors for them to complete the disassembly.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{an attempt}} to {{simulate}} non-uniform coating delamination, the elasto-static problem of a penny shaped axisymmetric crack embedded in a functionally graded coating bonded to a homogeneous substrate subjected <b>to</b> <b>crack</b> surface tractions is considered. The coating’s material gradient {{is parallel to the}} axisymmetric direction and is orthogonal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> plane. <b>The</b> graded coating is modeled as a non-homogeneous medium with an isotropic constitutive law. Using Hankel transform, the governing equations are converted into coupled singular integral equations, which are solved numerically <b>to</b> yield <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> tip stress intensity factors. The Finite Element Method was additionally used <b>to</b> model <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> problem. <b>The</b> main objective {{of this paper is to}} study the influence of the material non-homogeneity and <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> position on <b>the</b> stress intensity factors for the purpose of gaining better understanding on the behavior of graded coatings...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{inductive}} {{method for}} measuring the critical current density in a high-temperature superconducting (HTS) film has been reproduced numerically.

This result means that the inductive method can be applied <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> detection. However, <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> located near <b>the</b> film edge cannot be detected because <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> is treated <b>the</b> same as the film edge...|$|R

25|$|After the aborted solo effort, Davies' solo {{career was}} not revived until 1980, {{with the release}} of Dave Davies (AFL1-3603), which {{featured}} Davies performing all the instruments by himself.
