5|$|Founded as the Georgia School of Technology, Georgia Tech assumed {{its present}} name in 1948 <b>to</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>a</b> growing focus on {{advanced}} technological and scientific research. Unlike most similarly named universities (such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the California Institute of Technology), the Georgia Institute of Technology {{is a public}} institution.|$|E
5|$|George Washington named President {{in order}} <b>to</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>a</b> {{principle}} of the United States Constitution. In March 1796, before Presidents keel could be laid down, a peace accord was announced between the United States and Algiers. Construction was suspended {{in accordance with the}} Naval Act of 1794. At the onset of the Quasi-War with France in 1798, funds were approved to complete her construction, and her keel was laid at a shipyard in New York City. Her original naval constructor was Forman Cheeseman and the superintendent was Captain Silas Talbot.|$|E
5|$|Kitsune are {{believed}} to possess superior intelligence, long life, and magical powers. They are a type of y≈çkai, or spiritual entity, and the word kitsune is often translated as fox spirit. However, {{this does not mean}} that kitsune are ghosts, nor that they are fundamentally different from regular foxes. Because the word spirit is used <b>to</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>a</b> state of knowledge or enlightenment, all long-lived foxes gain supernatural abilities.|$|E

5|$|After Gasketball 2012 release, Boxleiter and Wohlwend {{planned a}} celebratory road {{trip to a}} game jam in Victoria, British Columbia. The game did not fare as expected, so Boxleiter used the two-day jam to create the core mirror {{reflection}} mechanics of what would become TouchTone, though it would take two years of sporadic work to finalize {{the remainder of the}} game. In TouchTone, the player monitors phone calls as part of a government surveillance program to find public threats. The story is told through a series of reflection puzzles wherein the player swipes the screen <b>to</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>a</b> beam around a room to its intended destination.|$|E
5|$|Created by comedian Bill Cosby, Clair {{is based}} on Cosby's own wife, Camille. Cosby {{originally}} intended for the character to be a plumber, but the producers and Camille ultimately convinced him to rewrite her into a lawyer <b>to</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>a</b> family that closer resembled their own. At one point, Clair had also been envisioned as a Dominican housewife who speaks Spanish when frustrated, inspired by Ricky Ricardo from the sitcom I Love Lucy, but this idea was also abandoned. Rashad, originally credited as Phylicia Ayers-Allen, won the role by exhibiting a subtlety in her audition that other candidates lacked. After marrying husband Ahmad Rashad and adopting his surname, Rashad became pregnant with their child during the show's third season, thus requiring her to conceal her pregnancy during episode tapings.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} early church {{settlement}} at Llanbadarn Fawr was comparatively successful and well-endowed, {{it is unlikely that}} significant building work was done. The clas church would continue <b>to</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>a</b> strong Celtic form for many years. But even though St Augustine, first Archbishop of Canterbury, failed to extend his authority to the Christians in Wales and Dumnonia {{at the beginning of the}} seventh century, the influence of the western church was to begin to be gradually felt. However, even then, the tendency in west Wales was to build larger and larger single cell churches, rather than adopt the newly fashionable basilican design.|$|E

50|$|In September 2012, the {{official}} {{name of the}} education program at PTE was changed to PTE Theatre and Film School, <b>to</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>an</b> increasing roster of film and TV acting classes.|$|R
50|$|The Super Fireball is {{replaced}} with the Spike Bomb which destroys every enemy on screen. The Trolley item {{is replaced}} with the Shield which is used <b>to</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>an</b> enemy's fireballs.|$|R
5|$|In a status-conscious society {{like that}} of the Romans, {{clothing}} and personal adornment gave immediate visual clues about the etiquette of interacting with the wearer. Wearing the correct clothing was supposed <b>to</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>a</b> society in good order. The toga was the distinctive national garment of the Roman male citizen, but it was heavy and impractical, worn mainly for conducting political business and religious rites, and for going to court. The clothing Romans wore ordinarily was dark or colourful, and the most common male attire seen daily throughout the provinces would have been tunics, cloaks, and in some regions trousers. The study of how Romans dressed in daily life is complicated by a lack of direct evidence, since portraiture may show the subject in clothing with symbolic value, and surviving textiles from the period are rare.|$|E
5|$|Miyamoto {{initially}} intended Ocarina of Time to {{be played}} in a first-person perspective to enable players {{to take in the}} vast terrain of Hyrule Field better, as well as to be able to focus more on developing enemies and environments. This concept was overridden once {{the idea of having a}} child Link was introduced, and Miyamoto believed it necessary for Link to be visible on screen. Ocarina of Time originally ran on the same engine as Super Mario 64, but was so heavily modified that designer Shigeru Miyamoto considers the final products entirely different engines. One major difference between the two is camera control; the player has a lot of control over the camera in Super Mario 64, but the camera in Ocarina of Time is largely controlled by the game's AI. Miyamoto says the camera controls for Ocarina of Time are intended <b>to</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>a</b> focus on the game's world, whereas those of Super Mario 64 are centered on the character of Mario.|$|E
5|$|The player's {{character}} gradually loses sanity when {{he looks}} directly at upsetting aspects of the game world. The character's mental degradation can lead him to hearing hallucinations and visions, which manifest as graphical anomalies and sound distortion, and changes in control sensitivity. If the character becomes too unsettled, results may include his permanent insanity or suicide, and a game over. The sanity can be restored through finding areas of sanctuary or defeating enemies. The areas marked with the Elder Signs serve as sanctuaries against the enemies and as save points. To enhance its replayability value, the game features a system whereby players can gain Mythos Points, supposed <b>to</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>a</b> level of gained knowledge. Such points {{can be used to}} unlock in-game bonuses, such as additional information and items.|$|E
25|$|Aiding {{and abetting}} another person's failure to file an {{accurate}} 13d statement with the SEC, since the schedule was not amended <b>to</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>an</b> understanding that any loss {{would be made}} up.|$|R

5|$|USS Congress was a {{nominally}} rated 38-gun wooden-hulled, three-masted heavy frigate of the United States Navy. She {{was named}} by George Washington <b>to</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>a</b> {{principle of the}} United States Constitution. James Hackett built her in Portsmouth New Hampshire and she was launched on 15 August 1799. She {{was one of the}} original six frigates whose construction the Naval Act of 1794 had authorized. Joshua Humphreys designed these frigates to be the young Navy's capital ships, and so Congress and her sisters were larger and more heavily armed and built than the standard frigates of the period.|$|E
5|$|USS President was a wooden-hulled, three-masted heavy frigate of the United States Navy, {{nominally}} {{rated at}} 44 guns. George Washington named her <b>to</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>a</b> {{principle of the}} United States Constitution. She was launched in April 1800 from a shipyard in New York City. President {{was one of the}} original six frigates whose construction the Naval Act of 1794 had authorized, and she was the last to be completed. Joshua Humphreys designed these frigates to be the young Navy's capital ships, and so President and her sisters were larger and more heavily armed and built than standard frigates of the period. Forman Cheeseman, and later Christian Bergh were in charge of her construction. Her first duties with the newly formed United States Navy were to provide protection for American merchant shipping during the Quasi War with France and to engage in a punitive expedition against the Barbary pirates in the First Barbary War.|$|E

25|$|The usual {{translation}} into English is the Red Army Faction; {{however, the}} founders wanted it not <b>to</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>a</b> splinter group {{but rather an}} embryonic militant unit that was embedded in or part of a wider communist workers' movement, i.e. {{a fraction of a}} whole.|$|E
25|$|The {{construction}} of fortified sites is often assumed <b>to</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>a</b> threat of warfare, but such fortified centres were multifunctional; {{they were also}} often the embodiment or material expression of the central places of the territories {{at the same time}} as being monuments glorifying and merging leading power.|$|E

50|$|Yebo Yes United was {{established}} in 1999 as a development and feeder club to Orlando Pirates. The original club name and logo were conceptualised in order <b>to</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>an</b> association with South African telecommunications companies who sponsored the club at the time.|$|R
