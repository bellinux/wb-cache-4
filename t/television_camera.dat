5|$|In October 1966, NASA {{announced}} the flight would carry a small <b>television</b> <b>camera</b> to broadcast {{live from the}} Command Module.

5|$|The Moon landing {{data was}} {{recorded}} {{by a special}} Apollo TV camera which recorded in a format incompatible with broadcast TV. This resulted in lunar footage {{that had to be}} converted for the live television broadcast and stored on magnetic telemetry tapes. During the following years, a magnetic tape shortage prompted NASA to remove massive numbers of magnetic tapes from the National Archives and Records Administration to be recorded over with newer satellite data. Stan Lebar, who led the team that designed and built the lunar <b>television</b> <b>camera</b> at Westinghouse Electric Corporation, also worked with Nafzger to try to locate the missing tapes.|$|E
5|$|On July 17, 1955, Disneyland and the Disneyland Railroad opened, and the {{day began}} with Walt Disney driving the DRR's No. 2 {{locomotive}} and its passenger train into Main Street, U.S.A. Station with California Governor Goodwin J. Knight and AT Railway President Fred G. Gurley riding in the locomotive's cab. They were greeted at the station's platform by the park opening ceremony's host Art Linkletter, actor Ronald Reagan, and several <b>television</b> <b>camera</b> crews broadcasting the festivities nationwide. After exiting the locomotive, Linkletter briefly interviewed Disney, Knight, and Gurley before they walked towards the town square in the Main Street, U.S.A. section where Disney officially dedicated Disneyland. The DRR eventually {{became one of the}} most popular steam-powered railroads in the world with an estimated 6.6 million passengers each year.|$|E

5|$|Although {{nearly the}} entire DuMont film archive was destroyed, several {{surviving}} DuMont shows have been released on DVD. A large number of episodes of Life Is Worth Living have been saved, and they are now aired weekly on Catholic-oriented cable network, the Eternal Word Television Network, which also makes a collection of them available on DVD (in the biographical information about Fulton J. Sheen added {{to the end of}} many episodes, a still image of Bishop Sheen looking into a DuMont <b>Television</b> <b>camera</b> can be seen). Several companies that distribute DVDs over the Internet have released a small number of episodes of Cavalcade of Stars and The Morey Amsterdam Show. Two more DuMont programs, Captain Video and His Video Rangers and Rocky King, Inside Detective, have had a small amount of surviving episodes released commercially by at least one major distributor of public domain programming.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} of the night saw Edge putting his World Heavyweight Championship on the line against The Undertaker. The early going of the match was slow-paced, in which both superstars countered each other's maneuvers. During the match, Undertaker ran and leapt over the top rope from the ring onto Edge on the outside. Then {{throughout}} the match, Edge was able to counter Undertaker's numerous signature moves, including the Chokeslam, Old School and the Last Ride, {{a variation of the}} powerbomb. Near the end, Edge hit Undertaker with a <b>television</b> <b>camera</b> while the referee was knocked down. When he proceeded to deliver a Tombstone Piledriver to Undertaker, Undertaker countered it into his own version and successfully delivered it to Edge for a two-count. Curt Hawkins and Zack Ryder came to the ring for Edge's aid, but Undertaker took them out. Because of their distraction, Edge was able to execute a spear on Undertaker, but was unable to pin him. When Edge delivered another spear to Undertaker, Undertaker applied Hell's Gate and forced Edge to submit to win the World Heavyweight Championship, improving his WrestleMania record to 16–0.|$|E

25|$|The {{ingredients}} for inventing the photomultiplier were coming together during the 1920s as {{the pace of}} vacuum tube technology accelerated. The primary goal for many, if not most, workers was {{the need for a}} practical <b>television</b> <b>camera</b> technology. Television had been pursued with primitive prototypes for decades prior to the 1934 introduction of the first practical camera (the iconoscope). Early prototype television cameras lacked sensitivity. Photomultiplier technology was pursued to enable <b>television</b> <b>camera</b> tubes, such as the iconoscope and (later) the orthicon, to be sensitive enough to be practical. So the stage was set to combine the dual phenomena of photoemission (i.e., the photoelectric effect) with secondary emission, both of which had already been studied and adequately understood, to create a practical photomultiplier.|$|E

The Javelin's manufacturer, Thales Air Defence, claims that their missile is virtually impervious to countermeasures. Even more advanced CLOS versions, such as the British Starburst, use a laser data link in lieu of earlier radio guidance links to fly the missile to the target.|$|E

25|$|In 1939, Hungarian {{engineer}} Peter Carl Goldmark {{introduced an}} electro-mechanical system while at CBS, which contained an Iconoscope sensor. The CBS field-sequential color system was partly mechanical, with a disc made of red, blue, and green filters spinning inside the <b>television</b> <b>camera</b> at 1,200 rpm, {{and a similar}} disc spinning in synchronization {{in front of the}} cathode ray tube inside the receiver set. The system was first demonstrated to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on August 29, 1940, and shown to the press on September 4.|$|E

Skyguard is an all-weather air defense system for the control of aircraft at low altitude and at low and medium altitude range up to 3,000 m. The maximum effective distance is given as 4,000 m. The system takes the air surveillance, target acquisition, calculation of the derivative-action values and the control of two Oerlikon 35mm anti-aircraft guns. Skyguard is served by four people.|$|E

25|$|At Fully Loaded, a First Blood {{match was}} signed with two stipulations. If Undertaker regained the title, Austin could never {{challenge}} for it again. If Austin was to retain, Vince McMahon {{would be forced}} to leave the WWF. Austin won by hitting The Undertaker with a <b>television</b> <b>camera</b> after an assist from X-Pac, thus retaining the title and forcing Vince out of the company. Meanwhile, The Acolytes defeated The Hardy Boyz and their manager Michael Hayes to regain the tag team titles and Triple H defeated The Rock in a leather strap match to become the number one contender for the WWF Championship. Two weeks later, the Acolytes would lose the tag team titles to X-Pac and Kane.|$|E
25|$|The {{other main}} match on the undercard was the Undertaker versus Reigns. The match was made after Reigns {{interfered}} in the Undertaker's match during the Number One Contenders tournament. This interference cost the Undertaker his match, and his opportunity to {{challenge for the}} WWE Championship at WrestleMania. The following week, Reigns cut a promo on the Undertaker, and claimed that he wasn't scared of him. On February 17, the Undertaker faced Reigns' tag team partner, Jindrak, immediately after Reigns had defeated Nunzio and cut another promo on the Undertaker. The Undertaker pinned Jindrak after a Chokeslam and a Tombstone Piledriver. Reigns then hit the Undertaker with a <b>television</b> <b>camera.</b> The Undertaker, however, quickly recovered, sat up in the ring, and then stalked Reigns to the backstage area.|$|E
25|$|There was {{a problem}} facing the crew in the newsroom, however. There was no <b>television</b> <b>camera</b> in the studio {{at the time as}} the {{technical}} crew was working on it. Eventually the camera was retrieved and brought back to the newsroom. Because of the magnitude of the story and the continuous flow of information coming from various sources, time was of the essence and the camera would take at least twenty minutes to become operational under normal circumstances. The decision was made to dispatch Cronkite to the CBS Radio Network booth to report the events and play the audio over the television airwaves while the crew worked on the camera {{to see if they could}} get it set up quicker.|$|E
