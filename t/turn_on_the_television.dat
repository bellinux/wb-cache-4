50|$|Especially in {{societies}} like the United States, where linguistics or ethnic diversity {{are not particularly}} valued, language-minority children encounter powerful forces for language shift or assimilation when they enter the majority-speaking world of the classroom in the society’s schools. Young children are extremely vulnerable to the social pressures exerted by people in their social worlds. But the social pressure they experience are not entirely external. Internal pressure too play a part. Once they <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>television</b> and they can {{see that they are}} different in language, in appearance and in behavior and they come to regard these differences as undesirable. At the same time, they are motivated to stop using their L1, all too often long before they have mastered the second language, all due to the internal and external pressures from their environment.|$|E

40|$|Presented on March 17, 2010 from 9 : 00 - 10 : 30 AM in Room 207 of the Health Systems Institute (HSI) Building. Runtime: 54 : 50 minutesKim McRae has an 11 year {{history as}} a family {{caregiver}} and a consumer of aging services. During a five year period, {{she and her husband}} took care of - and lost - his mother, his father, and her father. When her father died, Kim "inherited" her mother, who had yet undiagnosed Alzheimer’s disease and Lewy Body dementia. Kim’s Mom lived with them for four years, then spent four years in an Alzheimer’s unit of an assisted living facility in Atlanta. Kim has been studying dementia care and long-term care in depth for more than eight years to learn how to help herself help her mother. During this time, it became evident that there is a huge need for products to help both the caregiver and the care receiver. Together with a B. A. in Journalism from The University of NC at Chapel Hill; a background in consumer marketing, PR and advertising; and a deep desire to help others, Kim created the AboutFace remote. It is a result of her frustration and sadness in watching her mother lose her ability to do something as simple as <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>television</b> for herself, and her desire to help her mother have a successful, happy quality of life. About Face Technologies, LLC is focused on providing simple & intuitive assistive technology products for those needing simplicity.

40|$|Popular {{culture is}} all around us, we are {{encountered}} in with it {{in every part of}} our lives. As soon as we wake up, we <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>television</b> or the radio. As we go to work, we see advertisements on the billboards, {{on the side of the}} cars, in our workplaces. Then comes the time when we go home to have some rest. Many people like watching their own TV programs or series, because they serve as a great source of entertainment, so that we can relax. Actually we do not perceive social media with critical eyes. What if we pay a little bit more attention? What if our series are trying to tell something really important to us? In my essay I am targeting three popular animated cartoons: The Simpsons, South Park, and the Family Guy. These series are not only entertaining, but if we take a closer look at them, we might actually realize that they are social commentaries, social satires, and try to handle our problem on an outstanding way. From these issues I would like to focus on drug culture in our present. I would like to elaborate on these series in details in terms of their approach to the drug culture: first I give a short description about the political history of drug legalization in the United States before and at the time of the appearance of the discussed cartoons, and then I will provide some basic information about the cartoons in general. After that the pros and cons of marijuana and medical marijuana will be discussed, and it will be followed by the particular episodes of the series. In the end I will focus on the question which one is more realistic and life-like, and why. MSc/MAAmerikanisztika M...|$|E

40|$|Welcome to {{the first}} in a series of {{research}} reports from Leadership South West, which gives an introduction to some of the key issues in the field of leadership, including what is it, how can it be measured and what impact does it have upon performance? This report does not claim to be the definitive guide to all things leadership, but rather to present some of the most significant concepts and debates to have emerged in recent years. Leadership is currently one of the most talked about issues in business and organisation. It is hard to <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>television,</b> open a newspaper or attend a conference without coming across numerous references to leaders, leadership and leading. A search of the Amazon. com website in Spring 2003 revealed 11, 686 results for the word ‘leadership’ alone and similar searches of the Ebsco business and management publications database reveal an exponential increase in the number of published articles on leadership, from 136 in 1970 - 71, to 258 in 1980 - 81, 1, 105 in 1990 - 91, and a staggering 10, 062 in 2001 - 02 (an average of 419 articles per month) (Storey, 2004). The recent focus on leadership is an international phenomenon, as is increased investment in leadership and management development. In the US, for example, Fulmer (1997) estimated an annual corporate expenditure of $ 45 billion in 1997 (up from $ 10 billion one decade before) and Sorenson (2002) identified 900 college or university leadership programmes (double that of four years earlier), over 100 specialist degrees and a wide range of related activities. Similar trends are occurring in the UK and Europe. Leadership is regarded as the key ‘enabler’ in the European Foundation for Quality Management (EFQM) Business Excellence Model (EFQM, 2000) and has become a central focus for numerous other public, private and voluntary sector development initiatives. Recent years have seen centres of excellence in leadership established for nearly all parts of the public sector, including health, defence, education and police. Leadership, it seems, is increasingly becoming the panacea of the 21 st Century. Amidst this flurry of activity, however, a number of concerns arise. There is no widely accepted definition of leadership, no common consensus on how best to develop leadership and leaders, and remarkably little evidence of the impact of leadership or leadership development on performance and productivity. Indeed, most initiatives appear to actively avoid addressing these issues and simply opt for the feel good factor of doing something about it… whatever ‘it’ may be! Whilst action is frequently preferable to inaction, without at least some understanding of the underlying principles and assumptions about leadership and leadership development, it is likely that action may be misguided – at least reducing its possible effectiveness and at worst damaging what was there in the first place. The intention of this report, therefore, is to challenge some of the more popularist and stereotypical notions of leadership and to offer some insights into alternative ways of conceiving and addressing the issue.

[...] The mobs entered the apartment buildings and seek out Armenians where they lived. Some took shelter among their Azerbaijani and Russian neighbors, who also risked being attacked by <b>the</b> mobs.

5000|$|The song {{talks about}} three {{particular}} {{instances in which}} the narrator realizes [...] "there ain't no rest for the wicked."

The chorus (her response) analyzes the main reasons why individuals follow the paths they follow ("...Money don't grow on trees, I've got bills to pay, I've got mouths to feed..."). The narrator, fifteen minutes later, is mugged by a criminal, whom he asks the same question and from whom he receives the same answer. Finally, upon <b>turning</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>television,</b> <b>the</b> narrator sees a preacher being arrested for stealing the funds of his church.
