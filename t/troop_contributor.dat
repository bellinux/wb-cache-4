40|$|The thesis {{will define}} Italian {{contribution}} to European {{integration in the}} field of Security and Defence Policy. The first objective of this research is to describe how Italy placed itself in the debate on the development of ESDP if compared to the Franco‐German couple and the British approach: two opposing views dominated this debate: Atlanticism and the “autonomous” approach to European Defence. The former has been supported by the UK and other countries; The latter has been supported by the Franco‐German couple and other countries. Italy has often placed in between, by assuring conformity of the European initiatives with NATO, while promoting a stronger cooperation in a European framework. The thesis analyses in depth the Italian defence policy, the contribution to the European military and civilian capabilities and operations, the participation of Italian high brass in ESDP and NATO structures, the industrial interests in European defence industry and in the intergovernmental cooperation in armaments. The research utilise the Foreign Policy Analysis method, by means of a three level: transatlantic level (relations between US and European allies through NATO); European (relation between Anglo‐ Italians and Franco‐German approaches) internal (the interests of main Italian stakeholders: Politicians, Military, Diplomats and Industry). The main findings are that Italy had given to the ESDP a more sound contribution than expected. This is mainly due to the cooperation with the UK and the bureaucratic interests of the internal administrative actors. Italy is together with France is the first <b>troops</b> <b>contributor</b> for the EU military capabilities. The British‐Italian cooperation has led to new concepts for the ESDP, such as the headline goal and has boosted the military operation in the bilateral, NATO, and ESDP framework. Italy has been leading in the civilian capabilities and operations, in particular in Police Missions and Civil Protection. The Italian defence industry is emerging as a key actor in the European and US markets. The lack of a consistent national security and defence policy, because the ruling class is not interested, boosts the bureaucratic interests of the administrative élites that are shaping the role of Italy in the development of ESDP...|$|R
5000|$|On 24 December, {{after the}} UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay {{expressed}} concern about the conflict, the discovery of mass graves and the arrests of hundreds of civilians in the searches of homes and hotels, the UNSC voted to add about 6,000 international troops and 1,323 police officers to the existing over 7,600 UNMISS' personnel, including about 900 police personnel. The resolution was passed under Chapter VII of the UN Charter which authorises the use of force; {{at the same time the}} SC demanded an immediate cessation of hostilities and opening a dialogue between the rival factions. The additional troops would come from other UN missions in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Côte d'Ivoire, Liberia and neighbouring Sudan's Darfur and Abyei regions, where the latter also have an interest in South Sudan.

In a mix of ‘genetic multilateralism’ of Italian society and the ‘institutional multilateralism’ of the Italian Constitution, the UN soon acquired a central position in Italian foreign policy and Italian participation in the UN and its institutions became increasingly active.

The Italian commitment to the UN faced four main turning points: the launch of the UNOSOM II mission in Somalia (1992), the contribution to the UN Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (1999), the involvement in Afghanistan and Iraq (2001 – 05), and the engagement with the UNIFIL II mission (2006).
