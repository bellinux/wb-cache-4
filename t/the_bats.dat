5|$|Bats can be {{a tourist}} attraction. The Congress Avenue Bridge in Austin, Texas is the summer home to North America's largest urban bat colony, an {{estimated}} 1,500,000 Mexican free-tailed bats.

50|$|Rinehart later {{denied that}} <b>The</b> <b>Bat</b> was {{connected}} to The Circular Staircase after the works similarities led to legal troubles over film rights. In 1920, Rineheart bought back The Circular Staircase rights from Selig Polyscope, and hoped to license <b>The</b> <b>Bat</b> for a film. However, Selig re-released the 1915 Circular Staircase under <b>the</b> title <b>The</b> <b>Bat.</b> Rinehart tried to file suit to keep Selig from using <b>the</b> title. <b>The</b> <b>Bat</b> led to several adaptations of its own. In 1926 Rinehart licensed a novelization of <b>The</b> <b>Bat,</b> published under her name but written by Stephen Vincent Benét, partly to distance <b>The</b> <b>Bat</b> from <b>The</b> Circular Staircase. It was filmed three times: as the 1926 silent film <b>The</b> <b>Bat,</b> as <b>the</b> 1930 talking film <b>The</b> <b>Bat</b> Whispers, and as the 1959 horror picture <b>The</b> <b>Bat.</b>|$|R
5|$|Fruit eating, or frugivory, {{is found}} in both major suborders. Bats prefer ripe fruit, pulling it off the trees with their teeth. They fly back to their roosts to eat the fruit, sucking out the juice and {{spitting}} the seeds and pulp out onto the ground. This helps disperse the seeds of these fruit trees, which may take root and grow where <b>the</b> <b>bats</b> have left them, and numerous species of plants depend on bats for seed dispersal. The Jamaican fruit bat (Artibeus jamaicensis) has been recorded carrying fruits weighing 3–14g (0.11–0.49oz) or even as much as 50g (1.8oz).|$|E

50|$|According to Oaxacan mythology, <b>the</b> <b>bat's</b> nocturnal {{nature can}} be traced back to its ancient jealousy of birds' feathers. One day, as the myth goes, <b>the</b> <b>bat</b> felt {{isolated}} and undesirable, and told God that he was cold. God, fair and just, turned to birds in the animal kingdom and asked if they would show compassion and donate a feather to <b>the</b> <b>bat</b> to help him keep warm. The birds all agreed and began to pluck one feather from their bodies to give to <b>the</b> <b>bat.</b> With all of these feathers, <b>the</b> <b>bat</b> became even more magnificent-looking than all birds, and was able to spread color to the night sky. During daylight, <b>the</b> <b>bat</b> created rainbows that reflected vibrant colors from the sun. With his new beauty and abilities, <b>the</b> <b>bat</b> soon became arrogant and conceited. The birds grew tired of <b>the</b> <b>bat's</b> self-glorification and decided to fly up to heaven and ask God to do something. When the birds told God of <b>the</b> <b>bat's</b> behaviour, He was surprised and decided to take a look Himself. When on earth, God called on <b>the</b> <b>bat</b> to show him what he was doing. <b>The</b> <b>bat</b> began to fly across the light blue sky where, one by one, each feather began to fall out, uncovering <b>the</b> <b>bat's</b> natural, ugly-looking body. When all his feathers were gone, <b>the</b> <b>bat</b> became distressed and ashamed of his appearance. He decided to hide in caves during the day and only come out during the night to search for his long-lost feathers.|$|R
5|$|In 1997 an {{outbreak}} of respiratory disease occurred in Malaysian farmers and their pigs. More than 265 cases of encephalitis, of which 105 were fatal, were recorded. A new paramyxovirus was discovered in a victim's brain; it was named Nipah virus, after the village where he had lived. The infection {{was caused by a}} virus from fruit bats, after their colony had been disrupted by deforestation. <b>The</b> <b>bats</b> had moved to trees nearer the pig farm and the pigs caught the virus from their droppings.|$|E
5|$|In 2009 {{the sails}} were {{replaced}} and the mill re-thatched and restored by local craftsmen {{at a cost}} of a £100,000; the mill was re-opened later that year. The work was funded by the Grantscape Community Heritage Fund. Although the sails do not rotate with the wind, they are moved 90 degrees four times per year for maintenance. Before the restoration work was undertaken surveys revealed that the mill was used as a roost for long-eared and lesser horseshoe bats. It was ensured that <b>the</b> <b>bats</b> would still have access after the restoration.|$|E
5|$|A {{range of}} {{important}} small mammals {{are found in}} the area, including the hazel dormouse (Muscardinus avellanarius) and bats. The hazel dormouse is restricted largely to coppice woodland and scrub, while <b>the</b> <b>bats,</b> including the nationally rare lesser (Rhinolophus hipposideros) and greater horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum), have a number of colonies in buildings, caves, and mines in the area. A rare and endangered species, the greater horseshoe bat is protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and is listed in AnnexII of the 1992 European Community Habitats Directive. Amphibians such as the great crested newt (Triturus cristatus) have a wide distribution across the Mendips and are often found in flooded disused quarries.|$|E
2500|$|The {{trampoline}} effect, {{which is}} common terminology for baseball players, is the phenomenon when the baseball [...] "jumps" [...] off <b>the</b> <b>bat</b> at contact. <b>The</b> bat-ball collision {{can be demonstrated}} from the physics of elastic collisions. The stiffer the barrel of <b>the</b> <b>bat,</b> <b>the</b> slower the baseball comes off <b>the</b> <b>bat</b> because it loses energy in the collision. The softer the barrel of <b>the</b> <b>bat,</b> <b>the</b> faster the baseball comes off <b>the</b> <b>bat</b> because it retains its energy applied by the pitcher. The trampoline effect has been experimentally tested, and results show that composite bats outperform all-aluminum <b>bats.</b> <b>The</b> reason why composite bats outperform other aluminum <b>bats</b> is that <b>the</b> trampoline effect can essentially be [...] "tuned." [...] Composite materials have properties that are different in all directions, or anisotropy, which allows <b>the</b> <b>bat</b> manufacturer to design <b>the</b> <b>bat</b> stiff longitudinally (along the handle) and softer circumferentially (around the barrel). This softer barrel allows the ball to come off with less energy loss while maintaining the stiffness of <b>the</b> <b>bat</b> in <b>the</b> handle.|$|R

50|$|According to a {{particular}} East Nigerian tale, <b>the</b> <b>bat</b> developed its nocturnal habits after causing {{the death of his}} partner, <b>the</b> bush-rat. <b>The</b> <b>bat</b> and <b>the</b> bush-rat would share activities, such as rummaging through the grass and trees, hunting, talking and bonding during the day. When at night, <b>the</b> <b>bat</b> and <b>the</b> bush-rat would alternate in cooking duties, cooking what was caught, and eat together. It appeared to be a dedicated partnership, but <b>the</b> <b>bat</b> hated <b>the</b> bush-rat immensely. The bush-rat always found <b>the</b> <b>bat's</b> soup more appetising, so when eating dinner one night, asked <b>the</b> <b>bat</b> why <b>the</b> soup tasted better than his own and also asked how it was made. <b>The</b> <b>bat</b> agreed to show him how to make it the next day, but instead was forming a malicious plan.|$|R
5|$|According {{to damage}} surveys, 13 of the country's islands {{sustained}} damage; 470 homes and 6 schools were destroyed and hundreds more damaged. Damage throughout Tonga amounted to 104.2million paʻanga ($51.3million USD). In addition to infrastructural and public damage, the environment sustained catastrophic losses on Tonga. The Insular Flying Fox (Pteropus tonganus), a native species of bat, suffered great losses from Waka. Compared to pre-cyclone population levels, 79.8% (±9.9%) {{of the species}} was killed across six islands. This was due to widespread destruction of their natural food source, which decreased by 85% (±11.8%) following Waka. Trees across Vava'u were completely defoliated, although only 6.6% were killed, leaving no food for <b>the</b> <b>bats.</b> The greatest decline in bats was on Utula'aina Island at 95.7%; A'a Island sustained a complete loss of food-bearing plants. Six months after the storm, the bat population in Vava'u was still only 20% of the pre-storm level.|$|E
5|$|Fenton and Licht {{note that}} the effect of a rattlesnake's {{rattling}} could be deimatic (startle) in inexperienced animals, whether predators or large animals that might injure the snake by stepping on it, but aposematic (a warning signal) in animals that are aware of the rattle's meaning. They refer to the work of Fenton and his colleague David Bates on the responses of the big brown bat, Eptesicus fuscus, to the defensive clicks made by moths in the family Arctiidae, which includes the garden tiger moth, Arctia caja. This family includes large, furry, bitter-tasting or poisonous moths. They found that while sounds can startle inexperienced bats, after a few trials <b>the</b> <b>bats</b> ignored the sounds if the prey was edible; but the same sounds can warn experienced bats of bitter-tasting prey (an honest signal).|$|E
5|$|In 1996, a {{team led}} by David Burney {{collected}} breccias containing remains of bats and other animals from the cave of Anjohibe in northwestern Madagascar. <b>The</b> <b>bats</b> in the sample were described by Karen Samonds (previously Irwin) in her 2006 Ph.D. dissertation and a 2007 paper. She found several living species in addition to two extinct ones that she described as new, Triaenops goodmani and Hipposideros besaoka. At the time, the genus Triaenops was thought to include three species on Madagascar–Triaenops auritus, Triaenops furculus, and Triaenops rufus. Since then, Steven Goodman and Julie Ranivo have discovered that the name rufus is not in fact applicable to the Madagascar species and proposed the name Triaenops menamena for the Madagascan bats previously known as Triaenops rufus.|$|E

5|$|Miniopterus, a {{widespread}} genus of bats in Africa, southern Eurasia, and Australia, was first recorded from Madagascar by George Edward Dobson, who mentioned the larger Miniopterus schreibersii {{and the smaller}} M.scotinus (currently M.natalensis) in his 1878 catalog of <b>the</b> <b>bats</b> in the British Museum. In 1906, Oldfield Thomas named the larger species M.majori and the smaller M.manavi. He regarded M.manavi {{as close to the}} mainland African M.minor, and in 1971, R.W. Hayman and J.E. Hill placed it as a subspecies of that species. In their 1995 Faune de Madagascar review of Malagasy bats, however, Randolph Peterson and colleagues again separated M.manavi as a species, with M.manavi griveaudi (currently Miniopterus griveaudi) from Grande Comore as a subspecies. Peterson, who died before the review was completed, had originally divided M.manavi into several species occurring in different areas, but his collaborators decided conservatively to keep M.manavi as a single species, recommending reassessment of the status of those forms as new material would become available.|$|E

5|$|The bristle-faced free-tailed bat {{appears to}} be {{extremely}} rare across its range.

In NSW it has only been recorded at a small number of locations despite recent extensive surveys at over 300 sites in suitable habitat. Its preferred mode of foraging by flying at low levels along stream corridors suggests that the low numbers captured in surveys using mist nets and harp traps are an indication of rarity and are not an artifact of the survey methodology. Long-term monitoring of known populations is required to determine changes in population status of the bristle-faced free-tailed bat.|$|E

5|$|The main {{threat to}} this species is habitat disturbance, {{both natural and}} human caused. They are also under great threat of white nosed syndrome, {{pollution}} (especially water pollution) and human disturbance during hibernation. Very low levels of light, noise and heat are sufficient enough to wake hibernating bats. Once awoke <b>the</b> <b>bats</b> begin to expend energy and deplete critical fat reserves. If these disturbances are repeated bats, especially juveniles become very susceptible to death. White nosed syndrome is a fungal infection that attacks bats while they hibernate. 7 million bats of 6 different species are estimated to have been killed since 2006. There has been a 12 percent decline in eastern small-footed bats from white nosed syndrome alone. Due to their dependency on rare ecological features where they nest they are at particularly high risk from mining, quarrying, oil and gas drilling and other mineral extraction, as well as logging, highway construction, wind energy {{and other forms of}} agricultural industrial and residential development.|$|E
5|$|The {{three species}} of vampire bats are all endemic to Latin America, {{and there is}} no {{evidence}} to suggest that they had any Old World relatives within human memory.

5|$|As it is {{separated}} from the mainland by 3miles (4.8km) of water, few large mammals inhabit the island, except those that traverse the ice during the winter months. Rabbits, fox, raccoons, otters, mink, gray and red squirrels, and chipmunks are all common as is the occasional beaver and coyote. Bats are the most abundant migratory mammals as crossing the water is no obstacle for them. There are many limestone caves serving as homes for <b>the</b> <b>bats</b> and many insects on the island for the bat to prey on. The island is frequented by migratory birds on their trips between their summer and winter habitats. Eagles and hawks are abundant in April and May, while smaller birds such as yellow warblers, American redstart, and indigo bunting are more common in early summer. Near the shoreline, gulls, herons, geese, and loons are common. Owls, including snowy owls and great grey owls, come to the island from the Arctic to hunt in the warmer climate. Other birds, such as chickadees, cardinals, blue jays, and woodpeckers, live on the island year-round. Toads have also been found.|$|E
