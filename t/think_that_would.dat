Newfoundland would be like Alaska and I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> also go for Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and B.C. We'd be buying our oil from the United States. It would diminish our {{quality of life and}} range of careers, and our role in the world would have been substantially reduced." [...] Macdonald's biographers note his contribution to establishing Canada as a nation. Swainson suggests that Macdonald's desire for a free and tolerant Canada became part of its national outlook: [...] "He not only helped to create Canada, but contributed immeasurably to its character."

500|$|... "SMS (Bangerz)" [...] is {{the third}} track on Miley Cyrus's fourth studio album Bangerz, which was {{released}} in October 2013. Although the song never entered the Billboard Hot 100, the album's strong digital downloads helped it reach number 10 on Billboards Bubbling Under the Hot 100 chart, as well as number 157 on the UK Singles Chart. The song is marked as explicit by the RIAA due to its explicit language. Although in October 2013 Cyrus claimed she wanted the song to be the third single off Bangerz, [...] "Adore You" [...] was the album's third single release instead. Talking about plans for a music video, Cyrus hoped [...] "that the video will be as epic as the 'Work Bitch' one, so I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> be the smartest choice." ...|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, {{director}} Sam Mendes {{had been}} working on a film version of the story for several years, and in June 2003 Sondheim was approached to write the script. Although he turned down the offer, Mendes and producer Walter F. Parkes obtained his approval to use writer John Logan instead. Logan had previously collaborated with Parkes on Gladiator, and claimed his biggest challenge in adapting the Sondheim stage play [...] "was taking a sprawling, magnificent Broadway musical and making it cinematic, and an emotionally honest film. Onstage, you can have a chorus sing as the people of London, but I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> be alienating in a movie." [...] Mendes left to direct the 2005 film Jarhead, and Burton leaped at taking over the direction after his project, Ripley's Believe It or Not!, fell apart due to its excessive budget.|$|E

She has discussed her intent to return to college in the media, but announced in August 2009 {{that she was not}} intending to return to Brown University. [...] "I plan to continue school, [...] I’m looking into transferring somewhere in Boston,” {{she said in an interview}} with Inside Gymnastics magazine. “Brown is a great school and I loved it, but it was just not the best atmosphere for me; maybe a little too liberal. It was a great two years, and I learned a lot about myself and from the professors and coaches there. I’m looking at Boston University, Boston College and Harvard. I want to weigh my options before I make an ultimate decision, but I would love to transfer to Harvard. I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> be pretty much ideal." ...|$|E
500|$|The game's lead {{designer}} and writer Paul O'Connor {{said that the}} original 'high concept' for Darkwatch was [...] "Blade meets Men in Black in the Old West," [...] but [...] "in the two years that the property has been in development, it has grown in other directions and taken {{on a life of}} its own. The game is quite a bit darker than Blade, and we’ve completely lost the tongue-in-cheek feeling of Men in Black." [...] He added it [...] "leans toward the Army of Darkness side of things, though without the slapstick," [...] and [...] "with the accessibility of Raiders of the Lost Ark." [...] The turning point for setting a much darker and mature tone was the final iteration of Jericho's character design. Tala was originally intended to also be a player character, but the studio's marketing department [...] "didn’t <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> fly." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{birth of}} the Federation was first hinted at during part two of [...] "Shockwave", which opened the second season. When Manny Coto was made show runner for the fourth season, he decided that {{the focus of the}} series should be to link to that event. With this in mind, his {{intention}} was for this season to move towards that goal. Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens were hired as writers on Enterprise because they wrote the non-canon novel Federation and after it was suggested by producer Mike Sussman. The episodes for the fourth season were intended to lay the framework for the later creation of the Federation. This was something that the cast said that they would have liked to see more of, with Scott Bakula later saying [...] "I {{would have loved to have}} been able to explore that journey to the Federation and their creation of it... to a greater extent. And I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> have been, um, just more fun for the audience... just better, longer storytelling." ...|$|E

He credited Peter Berg with {{coming up with the}} Saracen character, and said he was grateful to [...] "have some of the most realistic and heartfelt storylines." [...] When asked which of the actors would have been drafted highest by the NFL, he replied [...] "Probably Taylor [...] He's a good athlete, but Scott will kill me for saying that. Scott played football growing up and he has a good arm, but Taylor is faster and I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> help his draft status." [...] Gaius Charles, who plays [...] "Smash" [...] Williams, graduated from the Carnegie Mellon School of Drama in 2005, determined to find a job within a year, which he did with Friday Night Lights. He describes himself as [...] "all right" [...] at football, but says that he was taken aback by the intensity of the plays on the set.|$|E

However, after evidence from the Dictabelt recording was made available, the HSCA quickly reversed its conclusion and declared that a second gunman had fired the third of four shots heard. HSCA chef counsel G. Robert Blakey later said, [...] "If the acoustics come out that {{we made a mistake}} somewhere, I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> end it." [...] Despite serious criticism of the scientific evidence and the HSCA's conclusions, speculation regarding the Dictabelt and the possibility of a second gunman persisted.|$|E
2500|$|All {{kinds of}} women's groups {{all over the}} country will be using this week on August 26 particularly, to point out those areas in women's life which are still not addressed.

Responding to a female journalist who asked him if this tenfold increase in patrolling soldiers would be enough to secure Italian women from being raped, he said: [...] "We could not field a big enough force to avoid this risk [...] We would need as many soldiers as beautiful women and I don't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> be possible, because our women are so beautiful." [...] Opposition leaders called the remarks insensitive and in bad taste. Berlusconi retorted that he had merely wanted to compliment Italian women.

[...] It {{guaranteed}} that Will Wolford, left tackle, would remain the highest paid player on the Colts’ offense {{for as long as he}} played on it. [...] Better paid than the Colts’ running backs, the Colts’ wide receivers, or any of the other acknowledged stars. [...] Even if the Colts went out and got themselves the NFL’s most expensive quarterback, Wolford’s salary would rise to eclipse his, too. [...] “I thought linemen would get a little more money from free agency,” said Wolford later. [...] “But I didn’t <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> happen. [...] I was numb.” ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Ratcliff, Sue getting {{pregnant}} {{put her in}} a dilemma because she worried that happiness for the Osmans would need to be curtailed if she decided to leave the programme; she felt this would be unfair on viewers because of all the misery Sue had been put through on-screen already. Discussing this in 1987, Ratcliff said, [...] "I knew nothing about the baby plans until a few weeks ago when I came back from my holidays and was told that Sue was pregnant again. Sue has gone through enough {{in the last couple of}} years. I'm glad she's got her dearest wish [...] I think she'll make a great mum and I'm sure Ali will be supportive. Hopefully, the storylines will open up for me, but it also means that if the pregnancy goes well and the baby is fine, it would be very difficult for me to leave without there being another tragedy in the Osman family. I don't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> be fair on the show or the viewers." ...|$|E

In an interview with Rap-Up, Tricky Stewart announced that he had collaborated with The-Dream on the project. He described the album as a whole as [...] "uptempo and edgy", stating that the album is different from her past works. In February 2010, Rihanna expressed a positive opinion on the album, but commented that her future work would be less intense. She asserted, [...] "I really like the bottom, the grime of it. But if I were to combine that with more energetic, up-tempo pop records, then I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> be a happy marriage. And that's where we'll probably go next". When asked what the most important song to her was, she stated that she doesn't have one, however, [...] "Fire Bomb" [...] and [...] "Cold Case Love" [...] were cited as her favorites.|$|E

2500|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} by the Sunday Times on 23 July 1989, Allan recalled a significant episode when Terre'Blanche had drunkenly hammered on her flat door and eventually slept on the doorstep {{and that she had}} to step over him the next morning. Despite her objections, her editor, Myburgh, insisted on publishing answering machine messages allegedly by Terre'Blanche, accompanied by a denial by Allan of counter claims that he had made against her. Allan recounted conversations with her editor [...] "After the bomb he said, 'Right, we'll publish the tapes.' I said I didn't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> be wise, as the security police had told me my life would be in danger. He said, 'We're going to blow them out of the water.'" [...] She had just emerged from a course of traction for her seized back, and was then rushed to hospital with a bleeding ulcer because of the stress. Allan fled to Britain permanently for security reasons in the same week that the transcripts were published. The tapes were the Sunday Times lead story published on 30 July 1989 with the front-page headline 'JANI: MY ET TAPES'.|$|E
2500|$|The press duly {{built the}} series up as a must-see, but {{the players were}} far more reticent {{than they had been}} during the {{adjacent}} encounter three years before. [...] Early in December, however, Australian captain Ricky Ponting drew considerable criticism for his comments about the ICC's wines and spirits. [...] "It has taken us a long time and a lot of great wins in different conditions around the world to get us to that number-one spot", Ponting declared, speaking to the Associated Press. [...] "If South Africa beat us three-nil I don't know if that gives them enough points to get over us. [...] But if they won the series one-nil or two-one, I don't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> mean that they deserve to take over that mantle. [...] It's a bit the same with India last series. [...] Just because they beat us, the number-one team, doesn't necessarily mean they go from the number four or number five in the world to number one in the world, because it's something that's accrued {{over a long period of}} time." [...] The remark was seen as fatalist and trivialising, suggesting that the rubber hardly mattered and, in the eyes of many, that Ponting's hopes of securing a series victory were low.|$|E

[...] Even if unemployment were [...] "unacceptably high," [...] he suggested that he would vote against the program continuing if inflation inched up a bit: [...] "if inflation were to move up and were to be broadly consistent with the implicit inflation target [...] in different people's minds around this room, even if unemployment were unacceptably high, I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> be time to stop this program. If inflation expectations were {{to move out of the}} range that they have been in for a long time, that would be a reason to end this program, even if unemployment were exceptionally high and GDP were well below what we think the economy is ultimately capable of."
