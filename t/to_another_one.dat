5|$|The earthly authority, whose {{words and}} actions should be cleaved to both in life (agriculture) and death (funerals), is called to minaa (an aluk priest). Aluk {{is not just a}} belief system; it is a {{combination}} of law, religion, and habit. Aluk governs social life, agricultural practices, and ancestral rituals. The details of aluk may vary from one village <b>to</b> <b>another.</b> <b>One</b> common law is the requirement that death and life rituals be separated. Torajans believe that performing death rituals might ruin their corpses if combined with life rituals. The two rituals are equally important. During the time of the Dutch missionaries, Christian Torajans were prohibited from attending or performing life rituals, but were allowed to perform death rituals. Consequently, Toraja's death rituals are still practised today, while life rituals have diminished.|$|E

25|$|An extra {{thermodynamic}} curiosity {{arises from}} the definition that memristors/memristive devices should energetically act like resistors. The instantaneous electrical power entering such a device is completely dissipated as Joule heat to the surrounding, viz. no extra energy remains in the system {{after it has been}} brought from one resistance state xi <b>to</b> <b>another</b> <b>one</b> xj. Thus, the internal energy of the memristor device in state xi, U(V, T, xi), would be the same as in state xj, U(V, T, xj), even though these different states would give rise to different device’s resistances which itself must be caused by physical alterations of the device's material.|$|E

25|$|Many {{countries}} and major metro centers are experiencing a continuous increase in urbanization and Bogotá is no exception. The population {{has increased from}} 4million in 1973 to 6.8million in 2006. The population {{is expected to reach}} 8.4million by 2020. This predicted urbanization will continue to exert pressure on the infrastructures, institutions, and water resource management mechanisms that are in place. Furthermore, increased urbanization implies that the construction of more drainage, WWTP, conveyance, and flood control infrastructure will be necessary. All of the housing built by new residents and the subsequent water infrastructure to support a growing population has the effect of reducing impermeable surfaces, thus adding <b>to</b> <b>another</b> <b>one</b> the challenges Bogotá is facing, flood and stormwater control.|$|E
25|$|For example, {{the group}} of {{projective}} geometry in n real-valued dimensions is the symmetry group of n-dimensional real projective space (the general linear group of degree , quotiented by scalar matrices). The affine group will be the subgroup respecting (mapping to itself, not fixing pointwise) the chosen hyperplane at infinity. This subgroup has a known structure (semidirect product of the general linear group of degree n with the subgroup of translations). This description then tells us which properties are 'affine'. In Euclidean plane geometry terms, being a parallelogram is affine since affine transformations always take one parallelogram <b>to</b> <b>another</b> <b>one.</b> Being a circle is not affine since an affine shear will take a circle into an ellipse.|$|E
25|$|Broadcast 11 January 1995, {{the first}} episode looks at how plants are able to move. The bramble is an {{aggressive}} example: it advances forcefully {{from side to side}} and, once settled on its course, there is little that can stand in its way. An altogether faster species is the birdcage plant, which inhabits Californian sand dunes. When its location becomes exposed, it shifts at great speed <b>to</b> <b>another</b> <b>one</b> with the assistance of wind — and it is this that allows many forms of vegetation to distribute their seeds. While not a plant, the spores of fungi are also spread in a similar fashion. One of the most successful (and intricate) flowers to use the wind is the dandelion, whose seeds travel with the aid of 'parachutes'. They are needed to travel miles away from their parents, who are too densely packed to allow any new arrivals. Trees have the advantage of height to send their seeds further, and the cottonwood is shown as a specialist in this regard. The humidity of the tropical rainforest creates transportation problems, and the liana-species Alsomitra macrocarpa is one plant whose seeds are aerodynamic 'gliders'. Some, such as those of the sycamore, take the form of 'helicopters', while others, such as the squirting cucumber release their seeds by 'exploding'. Water is also a widely used method of propulsion. The tropical sea bean Entada gigas has one of the biggest fruits of all plants and is dispersed by water streams. However, most plants use living couriers, whether they be dogs, humans and other primates, ants or birds, etc., and to that end, they use colour and smell to signify when they are ripe for picking.|$|E

500|$|Sgt. Pepper was {{recorded}} using four-track equipment. Although eight-track tape recorders {{were available in}} the US, the first units were not operational in commercial studios in London until late 1967. As with previous Beatles albums, the Sgt. Pepper recordings made extensive use of the technique known as reduction mixing, in which one to four tracks from one recorder are mixed and dubbed down onto a master four-track machine, enabling the Abbey Road engineers to give the group a virtual multitrack studio. EMI's Studer J37 four-track machines were well suited to reduction mixing, as the high quality of the recordings that they produced minimised the increased noise associated with the process. Preferring to overdub his bass part last, McCartney tended to play other instruments when recording a song's backing track. This approach afforded him the extra time required to write and record melodic basslines that complemented the song's final arrangement. When recording the orchestra for [...] "A Day in the Life", Martin synchronised a four-track recorder playing the Beatles' backing track <b>to</b> <b>another</b> <b>one</b> taping the orchestral overdub. The engineer Ken Townsend devised a method for accomplishing this by using a 50Hz control signal between the two machines.|$|E
500|$|After this letter, Williams {{complained about}} Müller {{conducting}} his {{campaign in the}} newspapers and misrepresenting what Williams was saying.

In Beckerlegge's view, all these replies and counter-replies did was [...] "illustrate the increasingly heated tone of the exchanges" [...] {{between the two men}} and their supporters. It was [...] "as if the protagonists were prospective members of Parliament", {{in the words of one}} modern scholar. Terence Thomas, a British lecturer in religious studies, records [...] "insults regarding the nationality of Max Müller and the proficiency of Monier Williams as a Sanskritist being bandied back and forth by their supporters." [...] For example, one of the Boden scholars at Oxford, Robinson Ellis, claimed that Williams had not been able to prove that he could read a Sanskrit text. When challenged, he later amended this to a claim that Williams could only read a text when he could compare it <b>to</b> <b>another</b> <b>one,</b> describing this as [...] "mechanical labour which is paid for at the public libraries at Paris and Berlin at the rate of half a crown a year." ...|$|E

Too bad then that it was so underwhelming." [...] The Guardian writer Stuart Heritage stated; [...] "Last night's Hounds of Baskervilles wasn't quite as rapturously received as other adventures, perhaps because of {{the amount of time that}} Cumberbatch and Freeman spent apart. The whole middle section, where Watson stormed off in a huff after being subjected <b>to</b> <b>another</b> <b>one</b> of Sherlock's baroque [...] "that man is left-handed and also has dog hair on one of his socks" [...] monologues, felt slow and flat precisely because there was none of the chemistry between the two leads that we've come to expect from Sherlock."
