Historically, many designs of blower have been used, from separate pumping cylinders, 'top hat' pistons combining two pistons of different diameter the larger one being used for scavenging, various rotary blowers and centrifugal <b>turbo-compressors,</b> including turbochargers. Turbocharging two-stroke engines is difficult, but not impossible, as a turbocharger does not provide any boost until it has had time to spin up to speed. Purely turbocharged two stroke engines may thus have difficulty when starting, with poor combustion and dirty exhausts, possibly even four-stroking. Some two-stroke turbochargers, notably those used on Electro-Motive Diesel locomotive engines, are mechanically driven at lower engine speeds through an overrunning clutch to provide adequate scavenging air. As engine speed and exhaust gas volume increase, the turbocharger no longer is dependent on mechanical drive and the overrunning clutch disengages.|$|E

40|$|Often <b>turbo-compressors</b> {{exhibit the}} maximum {{efficiency}} condition {{very close to}} the stall limit, so that it would be highly interesting to have a deep comprehension of this phenomenon. Despite the large diffusion of the multi-stage centrifugal compressors in different fields of the technology, such as natural gas pipe-lines or chemical factories, at the best authors’ knowledge, to date no theoretical model exists for rotating stall in these machines. This paper deals with a model for simulating multi-stage centrifugal compressor flow pattern during rotating stall. The model is not able to capture the stall inception, so the velocity and pressure fields are calculated throughout the machine once rotating stall has developed. The model consists of an implementation of that proposed by Moore for single-stage centrifugal compressors, so the simplifying hypotheses are: irrotational upstream fluid flow, inviscid and incompressible flow, stationary flow in the frame rotating at the same frequency of the stall cell; infinite blades are supposed both in rotors and return channel. Even if these fluid-dynamic hypotheses are really strong, it is worth of note that the reference models for rotating stall simulation in <b>turbo-compressors</b> (namely the Moore’s models) are based, at the present time, on them. In a previous step of this research, the authors utilized a semiempirical approach, with phases changes between first and second diffuser based on experimental data. Now this hypothesis is removed and the model is fully analytical. The mathematical model is solved by numerical way, leaving the original semianalytical scheme of Moore, so allowing the stall cell propagation frequency to be calculated. The computer code is written in C language for Linux operating system.

Almost all automotive and industrial diesel engines and most of the high performance SI engines are equipped with turbocharger. Even though past few decades have seen continuous performance improvement, there is still lack of wide range research on acoustical behavior of turbochargers. A turbocharger consists of compressor which is driven by an exhaust turbine. Turbocharger produces high frequency aerodynamic sound due to the high speed rotating blade.

40|$|<b>Turbo-compressors</b> play {{a crucial}} role in the {{operation}} of air-breathing engines and special attention is given to the compressor’s ability to withstand adverse operating conditions. Various methods have been devised in order to enhance compressor stability and increase compressor stall margin, usually with some sacrifice of performance and efficiency. Active methods make use of external devices injecting and/or bleeding air from the compressor duct. Passive methods are primarily based on casing treatments, often involving flow paths into the rotor casing, to affect the behavior of the flow in favorable ways. In either case, it is desirable that the stability enhancing method be as simple as possible and that it keep performance and/or efficiency degradation to a minimum. The present work consists of a CFD analysis performed to evaluate the impact of a novel form of passive stability control on the operation of an axial flow fan stage. The casing treatment consists of “studs,” which are solid structures protruding from the casing into the duct. These structures are located slightly downstream of the fan rotor trailing edge. The stage that is studied in this investigation is the NASA SDT 2 R 4 transonic turbofan. The simulation software used is “Tenasi,” an in-house developed flow solver. Various simulations were conducted of the turbofan operation with and without casing treatment. Measures of performance and efficiency of the turbofan stage with no casing treatment were computed, and the results showed good agreement with available experimental data. The computed results from simulation with casing treatment suggest that protruding studs have the potential to improve the stability of the turbofan. The computed stall margin increase using an initial configuration of protruding studs is about 5. 4 % in terms of mass flow rate, with a decrease in efficiency of about 1. 6 %.

The importance of centrifugal compressors for natural gas transmission is discussed, and the causes of surge and the consequences of current surge control approaches are explained. Previous technology development, including findings from early GMRC research, previous surge detection work, and selected publications, are presented. The project is divided into three Phases to accomplish the project objectives of verifying near surge sensing, developing a prototype surge control system (sensor and controller), and testing/demonstrating the benefits of direct surge control. Specification for the direct surge control sensor and controller developed with guidance from the industry Oversight Committee is presented in detail. Results of CFD modeling conducted to aid in interpreting the laboratory test results are shown and explained. An analysis of the system dynamics identified the data sampling and handling requirements for direct surge control. A detailed design process for surge detection probes has been developed and explained in this report and has been used to prepare drag probes for the laboratory compressor test and the first field test. The surge detection probes prepared for testing have been bench tested and flow tested to determine and calibrate their sensitivity to flow forces as shown in data presented in this report. The surge detection drag probes have been shown to perform as expected and as required to detect approaching surge. Laboratory test results of surge detection in the SwRI centrifugal compressor demonstrated functionality of the surge detection probes and a change in the impeller inlet flow pattern prior to surge.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{experimental}} and theoretical studies, {{performed in the}} field of technical flow duct acoustics are presented in this thesis. The acoustical methods treated are implemented on turbocharged IC-engines and engine gas exchange system components. A new method based on the well-known two-load technique has been developed. The method was applied to characterise the source data of various piston-engines with non-linear behaviour including a 6 cylinder turbo-charged truck diesel engine. The source characterisation results were compared to the results obtained using the linear two-load technique. It was demonstrated that the new non-linear multi-load technique gives improved results when the source is slightly non-linear. The use of active one-port models has been tested to characterize an air terminal device (ATD) as a source of flow generated noise. In order to predict the noise generation at different operating points of the device a scaling law was derived and verified. In the experimentally derived scaling law a flow speed dependence of 3 was found for the narrow band spectra, corresponding to a dipole-like behavior of the source in the plane wave range. The proposed technique was validated successfully and the results indicated a good prediction of in-duct sound generation by the air terminal device. Sound reflection from hot flow duct openings has been investigated experimentally. The reflection coefficient was measured for flow temperatures up to 500 ºC and jet velocities up to 108 m/s. The results have been compared with famous Munt’s theory. It was concluded that at low Mach number and Helmholz number cases the results agree well with the Munt’s model. This was the first experimental validation of the theory for hot flow conditions. Experimental procedures to determine the sound transmission through automotive turbo-charger compressors were developed and described in detail.
