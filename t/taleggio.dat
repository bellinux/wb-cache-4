50|$|CheeseThe dairy {{production}} is {{the strength of}} the economy of Valsassina. The new cheese makers have not forgotten the ancient livestock raising rules which provide, among other things, the summer transfer of herds on the pastures at higher altitudes. The milk produced is processed to derive undoubted quality cheeses such as Taleggio: a cheese with a square shape, with a thin crust and the uniform and compact paste. Ideal alone accompanied with pears, or to flavor other dishes. There are numerous dairy farms that produce the <b>Taleggio</b> cheese with goat cheese, the Robiola to quartirolo over the ricotta.|$|E

40|$|The authors {{evaluated}} {{the prevalence of}} Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7, Salmonella spp. and Staphylococcus enterotoxin, in 2 132 samples selected from six types of cheese {{on the basis of}} recorded consumption in Italy in 2004. In L. monocytogenes-positive samples the precise level of contamination was determined. To define the physical-chemical characteristics of the selected natural cheeses, the pH values, water activity and sodium chloride content were determined. The results suggest that blue and soft cheeses (Brie, Camembert, Gorgonzola and <b>Taleggio)</b> {{are more likely to be}} contaminated with L. monocytogenes. The mean prevalence of L. monocytogenes in the six types of cheese was 2. 4 % (from 0. 2 % in Asiago and Crescenza to 6. 5 % in <b>Taleggio),</b> with contamination levels of up to 460 MPN/g. No presence of Salmonella spp. and E. coli O 157 was found in any sample. Staphylococcus enterotoxin was found in 0. 6 % of the samples examined. Physical and chemical parameter values confirmed that all types of cheese are considered capable of supporting the growth of L. monocytogenes. The study confirmed the need to apply effective control at production and sales levels to reduce the probability of contamination by L. monocytogenes. This micro-organism can attain high levels of contamination in food products, such as cheeses that have a long shelf-life when associated with difficulties of maintaining appropriate storage temperatures in both sales points and in the home...|$|E
40|$|In {{the initial}} phase of ripening, the {{microflora}} of bacterial smear surface-ripened cheeses such as Limburger, <b>Taleggio,</b> Brick, Munster and Saint-Paulin {{and that of}} surface mould-ripened cheeses such as Camembert and Brie may be similar, but ¨ {{at the end of}} the ripening, bacteria such as BreÕibacterium spp., Arthrobacter spp., Micrococcus spp., Corynebacterium spp. and moulds such as Penicillium camemberti are, respectively, the dominant microorganisms. Yeasts such as Candida spp., Cryptococcus spp., Debaryomyces spp., Geotrichum candidum, Pichia spp., Rhodotorula spp., Saccharomyces spp. and Yarrowia lipolytica are often and variably isolated from the smear surface-ripened cheeses. Although not dominant within the microorganisms of the smear surface-ripened cheeses, yeasts establish significant interactions with moulds and especially bacteria, including surface bacteria and lactic acid bacteria. Some aspects of the interactions between yeasts and bacteria in such type of cheeses are considered in this paper. ...|$|E
40|$|The hedonic {{response}} of preschoolers to six Protected Denomination of Origin Italian cheeses has been investigated.

Patterns of preference for cheese were not linear, depending on the joint effect of gender and cheese variety eaten. Hierarchical ClusterAnalysis of the preference data identified five groups of children with different cheese likes and dislikes. Partial Least Square Regression modeling of cheese acceptability of sensory-driven children subgroups with homogeneous cheese preference revealed different focusing on sensory characteristics of cheese among clusters.

40|$|Contamination of some {{varieties}} of soft smear cheeses with Listeria monocytogenes {{is an important}} problem for the consumer's health, leading to industrial substantial financial losses. Especially smear and soft traditional Italian cheeses such as <b>Taleggio</b> and Gorgonzola, may be risk products from a listeriosis point of view since they constitute a suitable medium for growth of L. monocytogenes. For this reason there is considerable interest in developing microbial ripening consortia which display anti-listerial activity. In this study, 42 Lactobacillus strain isolated from different traditional Italian cheeses surface (<b>Taleggio,</b> Gorgonzola, Casera Valtellina, Scimudin and Formaggio di Fossa) were analyzed {{for their ability to}} produce anti-listeria substances. Lactobacillus sakei, L. curvatus, L. plantarum, L. rhamnosus, L. paracasei, L. casei, L. acidophillus and L. acidipiscis, were preliminary screening by an agar spot test and the well diffusion assays. PCR was also performed to search the presence of bacteriocin encoding genes. Although inhibitory activity against L. monocytogenes was detected for all isolates by the agar stop test, the number of positive strains was severely reduced, when the neutralized cell-free supernatants (CFS) were subjected to the well-diffusion assay resulting much less inhibitory against L. monocytogenes. The preliminary characterization of the antimicrobial substances present on the CFS revealed high thermo stability while the sensibility to the treatment with trypsin, proteinase K and papain was different and strain dependent. Based on our results we found 14 news bacteriocin-producing Lactobacillus strains, belong to the genera L. curvatus (8), L. plantarum (2), L. rhamnosus (1), L. casei (1), L. acidophillus (1) and L. acidipiscis (1). According to trycine–SDS–PAGE, these inhibitory actives molecules are approximately 2. 5 - 7 kDa in size. PCR- based analysis demonstrated a great diversity among bacteriocin genes presents in different microorganism isolated from the same source. Interestingly some strains carried bacteriocin structural genes from not related genus demonstrating the factibility of horizontal gene transfer among bacterial populations in the same food matrix. Beyond the use of bacteriocins as functional ingredients for the biopreservation of foods, the newly identified bacteriocin-producing Lactobacillus strains from traditional cheeses may also be useful for designing starter cultures with protective properties...|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 47 Listeria monocytogenes strains {{isolated}} {{in a survey}} of cheeses sampled from retail outlets were characterised. Five cheeses (Gorgonzola, <b>Taleggio,</b> Asiago, Crescenza and Brie) were chosen from the most popular soft and semi-soft cheeses consumed in Italy and most commonly contaminated with L. monocytogenes. The serotype and antibiotic resistance pattern were determined for each strain and their macrorestriction profile was analysed with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The main serotypes detected were 1 / 2 a (76. 6 %) and 1 / 2 c (21. 3 %). Serotype 1 / 2 b was found in only one sample. A total of 97. 9 % of strains were resistant to oxacillin (OX), 80. 9 % to lincomycin (L) and 78. 7 % to clindamycin (CC). Of these strains, 17 % were found to be resistant to two antibiotics (OX-CC or OX-L) while 70. 2 % were resistant to three antibiotics (OX-CC-L). No strains were susceptible to all the compounds tested. A combined analysis of the macrorestriction profiles AscI and ApaI identified eleven pulsotypes divided into three clusters. Two pulsotypes predominated, accounting for 57. 4 % and 21. 3 % of the isolated strains. Analysis of the PFGE profiles did not reveal any correlation between pulsotype and type of cheese, producer or retail outlet. A temporal analysis revealed that one pulsotype was persistent throughout the study period, with the exception of August and September, in which time a different pulsotype was detected. This variability suggests the influence of factors affecting the dynamics of the contamination of these products. Large-scale studies could help clarify this phenomenon...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to explore the hedonic response of consumers to cheese and beer pairings by tasting in a typical social environment of consumption. Ninety-six regular beer and cheese consumers hedonically rated all fifty-six pairings of eight bottom fermented red beers and seven cheeses (Parmigiano Reggiano, Fontina, <b>Taleggio,</b> Smoked Provola, Mozzarella, Caprino, and Gorgonzola). Preference varied across samples (p. <. 0. 001). One consumer out of two appreciated all of the pairings, yet pairings with Mozzarella were liked moderately. One consumer out of three appreciated pairings with Parmigiano, were neutral in their hedonic response to pairings with Fontina and disliked moderately the remaining pairings but those including mozzarella were extremely unappealing to them. One consumer out of six disliked all the pairings tested but some matches with Parmigiano were liked slightly. Liking of cheese and bottom fermented red beer pairings is biased by the type of cheese partnered with beer (Parmigiano most liked and Mozzarella least liked); by the type of beer partnered with cheese, and by the liking of the sensory properties of the beers and of the cheese tasted alone. However, consumers do not simply enjoy a combination of their most preferred beer and cheese. They identified some flavors that harmonize better than do others. Also, significant correlations between mean liking scores and sensory characteristics of the fifty-six pairings were found. Beer flavor is modified largely by prior cheese consumption. Each cheese has an effect on beer flavor and this effect is consistent over the eight different beers. In general all of the cheeses decreased the intensity of fruitiness, sweetness, perceived level of carbonation, perceived level of alcoholicity, caramel-like, licorice-like and burnt notes. Bitterness, astringency, and burnt notes were reduced by most of the cheeses but Fontina and Smoked Provola increased the perception of these attributes. For brewers to profitably exploit the potential of the science of cheese and beer pairing the choice of a suitable beer and of a suitable cheese in terms of liking and sensory properties and the identification of a proper target audience familiar to the beers paired with cheese are essential...|$|E
