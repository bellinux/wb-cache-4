Macro true shear stress-true strain curves were obtained under different strain rate loading conditions at room temperature. The effects of strain hardening and strain rate hardening on the dynamic mechanical properties of Ti 6 Al 4 V titanium alloy were discussed.

5000|$|Two {{important}} effects {{necessary to}} understand the <b>true</b> <b>stress</b> are the effects of strain rate susceptibility and strain rate hardening upon the <b>true</b> <b>stress.</b> Time is often neglected in the initial stress-strain curve relations, but at higher strain rates, higher stresses will occur according to the relationship σT=kἕTm where m is the strain rate susceptibility. To account for the resistance to necking, the relationship σT=kεTn must also be considered, where n is the strain hardening coefficient and is typically between 0.02 and 0.50, depending upon the material. By combining these two relationships, a relationship of σT=kεTnἕTm can be found. However, as real stresses and strains do not occur uniaxially, considerations for multiaxial stresses must be added to this relationship to model real stresses.|$|E

40|$|In this work, {{molecular}} mechanics simulations {{were performed}} using a modified embedded-atom method (MEAM) potential {{to generate the}} stress-strain responses {{of a series of}} n-alkane molecules from ethane (C$_ 2 $H$_ 6 $) to undecane (n-C$_{ 11 }$H$_{ 24 }$) in tensile deformation up to the point of bond rupture. The results are further generalized to a single polyethylene (PE) chain. Force, <b>true</b> Cauchy <b>stress,</b> <b>true</b> virial <b>stress,</b> and Young's moduli were calculated as a function of true strain for all of the molecules. In calculating the stress of a single molecule, three methods (designated in this work as M 1, M 2, and M 3) are suggested based on three different metrics to quantify both the instantaneous molecular cross-sectional area and volume during deformation. The predictions of these methods are compared to theoretical, first-principles, and experimental data. M 1 gives true Cauchy and <b>true</b> virial <b>stress</b> results that are essentially equivalent, suggesting that it is a better method for calculating stress in alkane molecules and, hence, PE single chain. The MEAM predictions of the average elastic modulus for a single PE chain using M 1, M 2, and M 3 are 401 GPa, 172 GPa, and 147 GPa, respectively. Though these results are disparate, M 1 gives a modulus value that is strikingly close to the ab initio-calculated value of 405 GPa for the -CH$_ 2 $CH$_ 2 $- repeat unit of PE at 0 K. To further test the MEAM potential, the Young's modulus (C$_{ 33 }$ elastic constant) of an orthorhombic PE crystal cell was calculated, but its value (184 GPa) underestimates the DFT-calculated value of 316 GPa by 42 %.

There has been an ongoing debate {{in the literature on}} whether <b>true</b> yield <b>stress</b> fluids exist, and even whether the concept is useful. This is mainly due to the experimental difficulties in determining the yield stress. We show that most if not all of these difficulties disappear when a clear distinction is made between two types of yield stress fluids: thixotropic and simple ones. For the former, adequate experimental protocols need to be employed that take into account the time evolution of these materials: ageing and shear rejuvenation. This solves the problem of experimental determination of the yield stress. Also, we show that <b>true</b> yield <b>stress</b> materials indeed exist, and in addition, we account for shear banding that is generically observed in yield stress fluids...|$|R
