40|$|This study {{investigates the}} utility of {{piezoelectric}} transduction to assess the structural health of a system through impedance analysis, with application {{to the field of}} ‘smart’ orthopaedic implants. The work is motivated by the high proportion of orthopaedic implant failures that occur due to loosening of the bond between the implant and the corresponding bone surface. The ultimate aim is to prove that piezoelectric sensors embedded within orthopaedic implants have the potential identify implant loosing before it would be shown in imaging techniques. Orthopaedic knee implants were selected as a case study for proof of concept for the proposed health monitoring system. Three distinct experiments were conducted: 1) Small piezoelectric sensors are attached to model tibial trays which are in turn attached with bone cement to sawbone blocks. The measured sensor impedance over a range of input frequencies is measured and analysis of the frequency impedance traces is carried out to determine what changes in the trace are indicative of the bone cement between the sawbone and aluminium curing; 2) Commercially available tibial trays cemented to sawbone tibias are progressively loosened under a fatigue load in a compressive testing rig. Results from three Linear Variable Differential Transducers (LVDTs) measuring the micromotion between the implant and sawbone are compared with frequencyMimpedance traces taken from a piezoelectric sensor attached to the top side of the tibial tray; and 3) Varying amounts of bone cement is used to cover the surface between a sawbone block and model tibial tray. Frequency-impedance readings are taken from a piezoelectric sensor adhered to the top side of the <b>tray.</b> <b>Support</b> vector machines are used to classify between the varying amounts of cement on each test sample. Experimental results and data analysis demonstrate the potential of piezoelectric sensors ability to provide information on the integrity of bone cement bond. Findings include: 1) Piezoelectric sensors can determine at what point bone cement bond between sawbone and an aluminium plate has cured; and 2) It is possible to identify different levels of cement coverage between sawbone and aluminium plate with an accuracy of up to 92...|$|E

The absorbent fiber, when mixed with water and dietary ingredients, produced a diet medium of homogeneous texture that supported larval growth and development comparable with the standard gelled diet. Larval and pupal weights from two concentrations of cellulose fiber-based diet {{were significantly higher than}} those obtained using gelled diet. The number of pupae per tray, percentage of adult emergence, oviposition, percentage of egg hatch, and adult longevity obtained from the insects reared in the cellulose fiber-based diet were comparable or slightly better than the biological parameters recorded from flies reared in the gelled diet. Moreover, results indicate that a lesser amount of the cellulose fiber-based diet than the normal amount of gelled diet per <b>tray</b> would <b>support</b> normal larval growth. Physical properties and texture of the new diet seem to allow the larvae to move and feed more freely than they do on the semisolid gelled diet, resulting in less wasted diet. The cellulose fiber is biodegradable and inexpensive, whereas the polyacrylate gel polymer is not biodegradable and is relatively expensive. Replacing gel with cellulose fiber in the screwworm larval diet for mass rearing should result in substantial cost savings in material and labor as well as eliminating concern of environmental pollution due to diet waste disposal...|$|R
40|$|Compared to {{packings}} trays {{are more}} cost effective column internals because {{they create a}} large interfacial area for mass transfer by {{the interaction of the}} vapour on the liquid. The <b>tray</b> <b>supports</b> a mass of froth or spray which on most trays (including the most widely used sieve trays) is not in any way controlled. The two important results of the gas/liquid interaction are the tray efficiency and the tray throughput or capacity. After many years of practical experience, both may be predicted by empirical correlations, despite the lack of understanding. It is known that the tray efficiency is in part determined by the liquid flow pattern and the throughput by the liquid froth height which in turn depends on the liquid hold-up and vapour velocity. This thesis describes experimental work on sieve trays in an air-water simulator, 2. 44 m in diameter. The liquid flow pattern, for flow rates similar to those used in commercial scale distillation, was observed experimentally by direct observation; by water-cooling, to simulate mass transfer; use of potassium permanganate dye to observe areas of longer residence time; and by height of clear liquid measurements across the tray and in the downcomer using manometers. This work presents experiments designed to evaluate flow control devices proposed to improve the gas liquid interaction and hence improve the tray efficiency and throughput. These are (a) the use of intermediate weirs to redirect liquid to the sides of the tray so as to remove slow moving/stagnant liquid and (b) the use of vapour-directing slots designed to use the vapour to cause liquid to be directed towards the outlet weir thus reducing the liquid hold-up at a given rate i. e. increased throughput. This method also has the advantage of removing slow moving/stagnant liquid. In the experiments using intermediate weirs, which were placed in the centre of the tray. it was found that in general the effect of an intermediate weir depends on the depth of liquid downstream of the weir. If the weir is deeper than the downstream depth it will cause the upstream liquid to be deeper than the downstream liquid. If the weir is not as deep as deep as the downstream depth it may have little or no effect on the upstream depth. An intermediate weir placed at an angle to the direction of flow of liquid increases the liquid towards the sides of the tray without causing an increase in liquid hold-up/ froth height. The maximum proportion of liquid caused to flow sideways by the weir is between 5 % and 10 %. Experimental work using vapour-directing slots on a rectangular sieve tray has shown that the horizontal momentum that is imparted to the liquid is dependent upon the size of the slot. If too much momentum is transferred to the liquid it causes hydraulic jumps to occur {{at the mouth of the}} slot coupled with liquid being entrained, The use of slots also helps to eliminate the hydraulic gradient across sieve trays and provides a more uniform froth height on the tray. By comparing the results obtained of the tray and point efficiencies, it is shown that a slotted tray reduces both values by approximately 10 %. This reduction is due to the fact that with a slotted tray the liquid has a reduced residence time Ion the tray coupled also with the fact that large size bubbles are passing through the slots. The effectiveness of using vapour-directing slots on a full circular tray was investigated by using dye to completely colour the biphase. The removal of the dye by clear liquid entering the tray was monitored using an overhead camera. Results obtained show that the slots are successful in their aim of reducing slow moving liquid from the sides of the tray, The net effect of this is an increase in tray efficiency. Measurements of slot vapour-velocity found it to be approximately equal to the hole velocity...|$|R
40|$|Clinical {{experience}} of impaction bone grafting for revision knee arthroplasty is limited, with initial {{stability of the}} tibial tray emerging as a major concern. The length of the stem and its diameter have been altered to improve stability. Our aim {{was to investigate the}} effect of the type of stem, support of the rim and graft impaction on early stability of the tray. We developed a system for impaction grafting of trays which we used with morsellised bone in artificial tibiae. Trays with short, long thick or long thin stems were implanted, with or without support of the rim. They were cyclically loaded while measuring relative movement. Long-stemmed trays migrated 4. 5 times less than short-stemmed trays, regardless of diameter. Those with support migrated 2. 8 times less than those without. The migration of short-stemmed trays correlated inversely with the density of the impacted groups. That of impaction-grafted tibial trays was in the range reported for uncemented primary trays. Movements of short-stemmed <b>trays</b> without cortical <b>support</b> were largest and sensitive to the degree of compaction of the graft.

40|$|Bone {{ingrowth}} in porous {{surfaces of}} human joint implants is a desired condition for long-term fixation {{in patients who}} are physically active (such as in sport or work). It is generally recognized that little actual bone ingrowth occurs. The best clinical results report between 10 and 20 % of the total prosthetic surface in contact with bone will feature good bone ingrowth.

This study investigated mathematically the interface micromotion (transverse reversible relative motion) between a flat metal tibia 1 prosthetic surface of a prototype implant, and the bone at the resection site. The aim was to assess the effect of perimeter fixation versus midcondylar pin fixation and the effect of plate thickness and plate stiffness. Results showed that in the prototype design the largest reversible relative bone motion occurred at the tibia 1 eminence. By design, the skirt fixation at the perimeter would prevent bone motion.

Full details of this licence are available at: [URL] manufacturers are gradually embracing the adoption of Level 2 Building Information Modelling (BIM) standards (3 D models and embedded data) within their product model elements. However, these are not always well defined due to inaccuracies related to the scope {{and the content of}} the model attributes. Product Data Templates (PDTs) are currently being created as a solution to provide structured model element data to manufacturer’s clients. However, defining PDTs data has been particularly challenging for manufacturers, as there is a scarcity of content knowledge which includes BIM uses (i. e. electrical design) and processes (i. e. cable <b>tray</b> sizing) that <b>support</b> client’s lifecycle processes. Similarly, few studies have investigated the Level of Development (LOD) that manufacturers should use to create their model element product data. In this paper, we therefore propose a generic industry approach to create and maintain model element product data at different LODs using the Information Delivery Manual (IDM) and we evaluate it for future improvement. The IDM can capture processes at the informational (i. e. attributes), behavioural (i. e. project stage), organisational (i. e. actor), and functional (i. e. business rules) level. A case study on Made to Stock Products for the Design use has been created to drawn recommendations for the behavioural and informational IDM perspective. In order implement the LOD on an industry basis and for its ease of use, we recommend matching the IDM Exchange models to a LOD graphical standard and keeping the BPMN free of stage bindings. This issue should be further studied for standardisation purposes. The benefit of this approach is that manufacturers could use the IDM to create product model element data in relation to their client’s processes at different LODs for its inclusion within BIM Information Systems (IS) ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Malnutrition, with {{accompanying}} weight loss, is {{an unnecessary}} risk in hospitalised persons and often remains poorly recognised and managed. The study aims {{to evaluate a}} hospital-wide multifaceted intervention co-facilitated by clinical nurses and dietitians addressing the nutritional care of patients, particularly those at risk of malnutrition. Using the best available evidence on reducing and preventing unplanned weight loss, the intervention (introducing universal nutritional screening; the provision of oral nutritional supplements; and providing red <b>trays</b> and additional <b>support</b> for patients in need of feeding) will be introduced by local ward teams in a phased way in a large tertiary acute care hospital. Methods/Design: A pragmatic stepped wedge randomised cluster trial with repeated cross section design will be conducted. The unit of randomisation is the ward, with allocation by a random numbers table. Four groups of wards (n = 6 for three groups, n = 7 for one group) will be randomly allocated to each intervention time point over the trial. Two trained local facilitators (a nurse and dietitian for each group) will introduce the intervention. The primary outcome measure is change in patient’s body weight, secondary patient outcomes are: length of stay, all-cause mortality, discharge destinations, readmission rates and ED presentations. Patient outcomes will be measured on one ward per group, with 20 patients measured per ward per time period by an unblinded researcher. Including baseline, measurements will be conducted at five time periods. Staff perspectives on the context of care will be measured with the Alberta Context Tool. Discussion: Unplanned and unwanted weight loss in hospital is common. Despite the evidence and growing concern about hospital nutrition {{there are very few}} evaluations of system-wide nutritional implementation programs. This project will test the implementation of a nutritional intervention across one hospital system using a staged approach, which will allow sequential rolling out of facilitation and project support.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to develop, {{implement}} and evaluate an independent system with which to calculate the absorbed dose, delivered by high-energy X-ray beams, to the prescription point {{and the depth of}} dose maximum. The introduction of such a system in the clinical routine may help ensure high-quality treatment and avoidance of errors which may jeopardise the clinical outcome of the treatment (i. e. under- or overdose). A set of equations for calculating the absorbed dose to the prescription point was compiled in a software application (“HandCalc”), which is completely independent of the treatment planning system (TPS). For instance, HandCalc includes models to calculate the absorbed dose from photons scattered in the patient, the transmission of the primary kerma in the patient, the variation of the primary kerma in air with collimator setting (i. e. head scatter), and corrections for heterogeneities in the patient. A new expression for the transmission of the primary kerma in the patient was derived in which the coefficients are strictly defined (and given a physical interpretation) by the first two moments of the spectral distribution of the incident beam. Further investigations also revealed that these moments can be used to determine water-to-air stopping power ratios more accurately than other beam quality indices. In practice, the moments are derived from “in-air equivalent”, narrow-beam measurements using a mini-phantom. The degree of in-air equivalence was investigated with Monte Carlo simulations, which showed that the optimum measurement depth in a mini-phantom is somewhat below the depth of dose maximum. Based upon comparisons with measurements and the TPS, a clinical action level of +/- 4 % was chosen for HandCalc. Deviations greater than this are, with all probability, due to erroneous handling of the patient dataset during the preparation phase. An “entrance dose factor” was added in order to correct the dose calculations at the depth of dose maximum where electron equilibrium has not been established. The entrance dose factor was found to vary with beam quality and collimator setting, while no variation was detected with the presence of an acrylic <b>tray</b> (for block <b>support)</b> or with the source-surface distance (SSD). HandCalc was implemented in a hand-held PC which makes dose calculations inside the treatment room at the time of administration of the first fraction possible. An important feature of HandCalc is the built-in report function, which logs results from the calculation for later evaluation. In a study including 700 patients, deviations greater than the action level were found to be due either to limitations in HandCalc or to a systematic deviation between the planned and measured SSD. HandCalc {{has proven to be a}} fast and accurate tool for independent dose calculations inside the treatment room and it requires only a limited amount of extra time for the user to perform the calculations. Thus, it can easily be incorporated as part of the daily clinical quality control programme in order to prevent errors which may jeopardise the clinical outcome of the treatment...|$|R
