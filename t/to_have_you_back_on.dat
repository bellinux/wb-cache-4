6000|$|... "Dan!" [...] {{said his}} sister reproachfully. [...] "You know I didn't {{mean to say}} {{anything}} I only felt so glad <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>back</b> again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, my dear; no {{objection}} at all: of course not. I shall be delighted <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>back,</b> and so, I'm sure, will Rachel; but--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, it {{is a great}} {{satisfaction}} <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>back</b> in {{your old}} home, under our wing. I have a great deal {{to tell you about the}} arrangements." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear Julian," [...] Mrs. Troutbeck exclaimed as {{she threw}} her arms round his neck, [...] "what a relief it is <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>back</b> again. It <b>has</b> been terrible for you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, my dear, I am glad <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>back</b> again. Of course I {{have been}} a little lonely, but I bear that kind of thing better than most people. Thank God, my eyes are good." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Keep' em amused and interested,' said Revere. 'They {{went on the}} drink, poor fools, {{after the}} first two cases, {{and there was no}} improvement. Oh, it's good <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>back,</b> Bobby! Porkiss is a never mind.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm so glad--for Auntie's sake," [...] said Theodora, with shining eyes. [...] "But, oh, Donald, it's best of {{all just}} <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>back.</b> I'm so {{perfectly}} happy that I don't {{know what to do}} or say." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Keep 'em amused and interested," [...] said Revere. [...] "They {{went on the}} drink, poor fools, {{after the}} first two cases, {{and there was no}} improvement. Oh, it's good <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>back,</b> Bobby! Porkiss is a--never mind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, {{the prodigal}} must take his chance {{if he comes}} back out of season. But I'm glad <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>back,</b> Tom, even as it is, and I hope you're not going to hurry away. You must give your {{energies}} a rest." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How happy old Bunce will be," [...] said Mrs. Bold, {{clapping}} {{her soft}} hands softly. [...] "How happy they {{all will be}} <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>back</b> again. <b>You</b> may be sure there will soon be friendship among them again when you are there." ...|$|R
5000|$|Original 1953 {{cast member}} Moray Watson - {{who had played}} Marsh, one of Quatermass's colleagues - visited the set during rehearsals. The 76-year-old was invited to make a cameo {{appearance}} in the live broadcast, but was not available that evening. It was during the rehearsals for The Quatermass Experiment that David Tennant was offered {{the role of the}} Tenth Doctor in Doctor Who. This casting was not announced to the public until later in April, but his fellow castmembers, and crew, became aware of the speculation surrounding Tennant; in the live broadcast Jason Flemyng changed Quatermass's first line to Tennant's Dr Briscoe from [...] "Good <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>back</b> Gordon" [...] <b>to</b> [...] "Good <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>back</b> Doctor" [...] as a deliberate reference.|$|R
6000|$|... "Finn, how are you?" [...] said Lord Chiltern, {{stretching}} out his left hand. [...] "Glad <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>back</b> again, and congratulate {{you about the}} seat. It was put down in red herrings, and we found nearly {{a dozen of them}} afterwards,--enough to kill half the pack." ...|$|R
6000|$|Winifred {{thought that}} [...] "rather nice," [...] and added comfortably: [...] "Well, Holly's sensible; she'll {{know how to}} deal with it. I shan't tell your uncle. It'll only bother him. It's a great comfort <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>back,</b> my dear boy, now that I'm getting on." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{very happy}} <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>back,</b> Robert," [...] replied Mr. Worthington, {{and it was}} true. It would have been strange indeed if some tremor of {{sentiment}} {{had not been in}} his voice and some gleam of pride in his eye as he looked upon his son.|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{spent a good}} {{few years}} {{trying to put a}} bit together, {{and this is the first}} chance I've had," [...] he said; [...] "I'm going <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>back</b> me as a British subject on that concession. We'll go down into the village now if you're ready." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I believe," [...] he said, [...] "that intrigue is the {{resource}} {{of those who}} have lived their lives so quickly that they have found weariness. For these things to-day interest me very little. I am only anxious <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>back</b> again, Lucille, <b>to</b> find ourselves on our way to our old home." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "About sending you. It's an ugly business, Watson, an ugly {{dangerous}} business, and {{the more}} I see of it the less I like it. Yes, my dear fellow, you may laugh, but I give you my word that I shall be very glad <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>back</b> safe and sound in Baker Street once more." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In {{any other}} case I should have said, 'Stay a little longer, if you please. Use your own convenience.' In your case I must say, 'Go to your mistress.' Her ladyship was {{reluctant}} to leave you behind. She will be glad <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>back</b> again. How long will you take to get ready?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Orszag {{attended}} Phillips Exeter Academy. He graduated summa {{cum laude}} [...] in economics from Princeton University. President Bill Clinton spoke at his graduation and joked that [...] "I {{also want to}} say that one of my youngest staff members is a classmate here—Jon Orszag. And when the ceremony is over I'd like <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>back</b> at work, please." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite so," [...] Captain Barclay said, cheerfully. [...] "It {{is a clear}} gain, and we {{waste the}} time in regretting {{that it is not}} longer. It is a great delight <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>back</b> again, even for a few hours. You both look wonderfully well, and fully a year older than when you left. Roughing it, and exposure, evidently suits you.|$|R
6000|$|One step {{he made to}} {{find the}} Earl, but too much excited to move away or to stand still, he came towards her, wrung her hand in a more real way than in his first bewildered surprise, and exclaimed in transport, 'O Mary! Mary! <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>back</b> again!' then, remembering his inference, added, low and gravely, 'It makes me selfish--I was not {{thinking}} of your grief.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course we}} shall be very glad <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>back</b> again if it suits you to come," [...] said Mrs. Ray. [...] "I don't think it at all nice that a family should be divided,--that is, {{as long as they}} are the same family." [...] Having {{received}} so much encouragement with reference to her proposed return, Mrs. Prime took her departure and walked back to Baslehurst.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am glad <b>you</b> are <b>back</b> again, Ruth," [...] Miss Carne, who {{had been}} down several times to see her, said. [...] "I {{told you not to}} hurry yourself, and I would <b>have</b> done without <b>you</b> for another month, but you know I am really very glad <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>back</b> again. Mary managed my hair very well, but I could not talk to her as I do to you." ...|$|R
2500|$|Doctor Who {{returned}} to British screens in 2005, with Christopher Eccleston {{playing the role}} of the Ninth Doctor in the first series. Tennant replaced him as of the second series, making his first, brief appearance as the Tenth Doctor in the episode [...] "The Parting of the Ways" [...] (2005) {{at the end of the}} regeneration scene, and also appeared in a special [...] shown as part of the 2005 Children in Need appeal, broadcast on 18 November 2005. He began filming the new series of Doctor Who in late July 2005. His first full-length outing as the Doctor was a 60-minute special, [...] "The Christmas Invasion", first broadcast on Christmas Day 2005. Tennant had been formally offered the role of the Doctor during rehearsals for The Quatermass Experiment. Although the casting was not officially announced until later in April, both castmates and crew became aware of the speculation surrounding Tennant; in the live broadcast Jason Flemyng (Quatermass) changed his first line to Tennant's Dr Briscoe from [...] "Good <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>back,</b> Gordon" [...] <b>to</b> [...] "Good <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>back,</b> Doctor" [...] as a deliberate reference.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>have</b> come <b>to</b> tell <b>you</b> how pleased we all were," [...] the colonel's wife said, [...] "to {{hear that}} <b>you</b> <b>had</b> returned, and how eager we <b>have</b> all been <b>to</b> learn {{how it has}} come about. We think it very unkind of you to stay so long in the mess room, when <b>you</b> must <b>have</b> known {{that we are all}} on thorns to hear about it. I can assure <b>you</b> that we <b>have</b> missed <b>you</b> terribly, since the {{regiment}} returned, and we are awfully glad <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>back</b> again.|$|R
6000|$|... "My friend," [...] she declared, [...] "my house is, I believe, {{the safest}} spot in Paris, {{yet there are}} limits. Remember that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> become a celebrity. There is an {{agitation}} in England <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>back</b> at the Foreign Office. All Paris is divided upon the subject of your life or death. And there are men {{here in the city}} who seek for you night and day with death in their hands. My house is sanctuary, but no one can write such things as you are writing and deem himself secure against any risk." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{could not}} {{all at once}} ask her as to that rumour which Morony <b>had</b> {{mentioned}} <b>to</b> him. But he {{thought of it as}} he walked with his arm round her waist. Some question must be asked, but it might, perhaps, be better that he should ask it of the mother. Mrs. O'Hara was at the cottage and seemed almost as glad to see him as Kate had been. [...] "It is very pleasant <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>back</b> again," [...] she said. [...] "Kate has been counting first the hours, and then the minutes." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{put his arm}} {{about her}} waist; it was a large, strong, {{sophisticated}} arm, and very agreeable; he grinned {{at her with a}} devastating knowingness, while Kennicott glowed inanely. She flushed; she was alarmed by the ease with which the big-city man invaded her guarded personality. She was glad, in retreat, to scamper ahead of the two men up-stairs to the hall-room in which Hugh slept. All the way Kennicott muttered, [...] "Well, well, say, gee whittakers but it's good <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>back,</b> certainly is good to see you!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O uncle! I'm so glad! and so sorry! Why didn't you let us {{know what}} time you'd be here, or call out the minute you came? Haven't I been home-sick for you? and now I'm so happy <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>back</b> I could hug your dear old curly head off," [...] cried Rose, as the Encyclopedia went down with a bang, and she up with a spring that carried her into Dr. Alec's arms, to be kept there in the sort of embrace a man gives to the dearest {{creature}} the world holds for him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, old fellow," [...] he said, going {{straight}} up to Philip and shaking him heartily by the hand, bowing to Maggie in passing, [...] "it's glorious <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>back</b> again; only I wish you'd conduct yourself {{a little less}} like a sparrow with a residence on the house-top, and not {{go in and out}} constantly without letting the servants know. This is about the twentieth time I've <b>had</b> <b>to</b> scamper up those countless stairs to that painting-room of yours, all to no purpose, because your people thought you were at home. Such incidents embitter friendship." ...|$|R
6000|$|MISS REED, laughing: [...] "You will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> {{go out for}} a walk, {{you poor}} thing; and I'm not going <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> coming <b>back</b> in five or ten minutes. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> got <b>to</b> stay out a good hour." ...|$|R
60|$|When {{we came to}} {{the station}} at Muneas you and Macinnery got blind drunk, and the whole camp saw <b>you.</b> I ought <b>to</b> <b>have</b> sent <b>you</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the coast then, but it would have broken Lucy's heart.|$|R
40|$|Verse 1 I never knew, I {{would miss}} you,Until you went away,Now I can see, {{what you were}} to me,My heart just seems to say: CHORUSI {{know what it means}} to be lonesome,I know how it feels to be blue,I {{know what it means to}} long in my dreams, for someone, for someone,I’ve sighed and I’ve cried since we parted,There’s no one knows what I’ve gone through;I’d give all that I own, just <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>back</b> home,I’m so lonesome, so lonesome for you. VERSE 2 Hope seems to say,There’ll come a dayYour smiles again I’ll see,My love is true, and you know it too,Come back, come back to me. CHORU...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, but I don't wish <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> walk <b>back</b> again," [...] said Rollo. [...] "We {{will come}} back by the diligence. There are several diligences and omnibuses that come by Aigle, on the way here, {{in the course of}} the day." ...|$|R
50|$|Lane {{became a}} Lord of Appeal in Ordinary in October 1979, {{receiving}} as a Law lord additionally a life peerage as Baron Lane, of St Ippollitts in the County of Hertfordshire. He {{had been appointed}} by the new Lord Chancellor, Lord Hailsham, soon after Margaret Thatcher won the 1979 general election. His appointment was welcomed in the legal profession, where Lane {{was regarded as a}} genial figure ("Geoffrey Dawson, Baron Lane. Good <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>back</b> again."), but eventually not welcomed by Lane himself, who disliked the work. The overdue retirement of Lord Widgery, whose physical ill-health and increasing dementia had become a suppressed scandal, led to Hailsham picking Lane to follow him as Lord Chief Justice from 1980.|$|R
