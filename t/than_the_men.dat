5|$|British {{intelligence}} assessed that Tirpitz {{could be}} repaired within six months, and the Admiralty ordered further carrier-borne strikes against the battleship. First Sea Lord Andrew Cunningham {{did not believe}} that Barracudas could carry weapons capable of sinking Tirpitz, but he hoped that further attacks would increase the period the battleship was out of service and harm her crew's morale. The commander of the Home Fleet, Vice Admiral Bruce Fraser, initially resisted this order on the grounds that further carrier raids on Kaafjord were unlikely to be successful as Tirpitzs defences would have been reinforced and weather conditions were likely to be worse than those encountered during Operation Tungsten. Following an argument with Cunningham, Fraser eventually agreed to attack Kaafjord again. Despite the decision to make further attacks on Kaafjord, many of the Home Fleet's airmen were posted to other units following Operation Tungsten. This hindered subsequent operations against German forces in Norway as the new aircrew were less experienced <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> they replaced.|$|E
5|$|No.1 Wing fought {{its last}} major engagements during September and November 1943. On 7September, the Japanese {{dispatched}} a twin-engined reconnaissance aircraft escorted by 20 fighters to the Darwin area. The 48 Spitfires scrambled {{in response to}} this force were led by Flight Lieutenant Bob Foster. This was Foster's first experience in leading the wing, and he misdeployed No.54 and 452squadrons' aircraft, leading to them being 'bounced' by Japanese fighters. In the subsequent combat three Spitfires were shot down while the wing claimed one fighter destroyed and two 'probables'. No.457 Squadron was able to gain a height advantage on the Japanese and shot down four fighters without loss. A further two night raids were made against Fenton on 15 and 27September but the Spitfires scrambled in response were unable to find the bombers on either occasion. No.1 Wing experienced a major turnover of personnel during September as pilots completed their nine-month tours of duty. This led to a loss of experienced airmen, but the new pilots were often better trained <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> they replaced. No attacks took place during October, and the wing did not make contact with the Japanese until 6November when a flight of six Spitfires which been deployed to Drysdale River Mission, Western Australia on the 3rd of the month failed in an attempt to intercept a reconnaissance aircraft near the settlement. In the early hours of 12November nine Spitfires were scrambled to intercept nine Japanese aircraft which were bound for Darwin and Fenton. Two Betty bombers were shot down over Darwin Harbour by Flying Officer John Smithson and no Allied aircraft were lost. Both these aircraft were commanded by senior officers, and their deaths led to the cancellation of further Betty bomber operations in the Darwin area.|$|E
25|$|Lanfranc {{accelerated}} {{the process of}} substituting Normans for Englishmen in all preferments of importance; and although his nominees were usually respectable, it cannot be said {{that all of them}} were better <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> whom they superseded. For this admixture of secular with spiritual aims there was considerable excuse. By long tradition the primate was entitled to a leading position in the king’s councils; and the interests of the Church demanded that Lanfranc should use his power in a manner not displeasing to the king. On several occasions when William I was absent from England Lanfranc acted as his vicegerent.|$|E

25|$|In England {{there is}} no indoor sport capable of {{attracting}} five-figure attendances on a regular basis, and this restricts the development of large indoor arenas. Nonetheless a number of 10,000+ seater arenas have been built {{in recent years and}} more are planned. These facilities make most of their income from pop concerts, but they occasionally stage boxing matches and other sporting events. The largest is the Manchester Evening News Arena in its eponymous city, with a capacity of over 20,000 for court events. The O2 in London (the former Millennium Dome), reopened in 2007, contains an arena that seats 17,500, but can be reconfigured to seat more <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>MEN</b> Arena and the National Indoor Arena in Birmingham which can seat 14,150. There are some specialist ice hockey and basketball arenas, but they only seat a few thousand spectators. Several of the 2012 Olympic arenas will be relocated outside London after the Games.|$|E
25|$|At Stretton-on-Fosse II (Warwickshire), {{located on}} the western fringes of the early Anglo-Saxon {{settlement}} area, the proportion of male adults with weapons is 82%, well above the average in southern England. Cemetery II, the Anglo-Saxon burial site, is immediately adjacent to two Romano-British cemeteries, Stretton-on-Fosse I and III, the latter only 60 metres away from Anglo-Saxon burials. Continuity of the native female population at this site has been inferred from the continuity of textile techniques (unusual in {{the transition from the}} Romano-British to the Anglo-Saxon periods), and by the continuity of epigenetic traits from the Roman to the Anglo-Saxon burials. At the same time, the skeletal evidence demonstrates the appearance in the post-Roman period of a new physical type of males who are more slender and taller <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> in the adjacent Romano-British cemeteries. Taken together, the observations suggest the influx of a group of males, probably most or all of them Germanic, who took control of the local community and married native women. It is not easy to confirm such cases of 'warband' settlement in the absence of detailed skeletal, and other complementary, information, but assuming that such cases are indicated by very high proportions of weapon burials, this type of settlement was much less frequent than the kin group model.|$|E
500|$|Changes {{in society}} also brought {{challenges}} to the program. For example, in the 1990s Christian groups started to question the need to classify shamanistic rituals as cultural heritage. Patriarchal lifestyle, where the man is the main provider {{of the family and}} women stay at home, also influenced [...] "holders", as housewives started to pick up the preservation of folk traditions also in areas that were previously dominated by men. The government resisted appointing female holders for such predominantly male traditions but was gradually forced to acknowledge them when there were no male practitioners at all, or where the women were significantly more talented <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>men.</b>|$|E

500|$|Roger Ebert, {{who gave}} the film {{three and a half}} out of four stars in a Chicago Sun-Times review, enjoyed that the story is [...] "always about more than boxing" [...] with its deeper themes [...] "about a girl growing up in a macho society and ... {{discovering}} she has a nature probably more macho <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> around her". On the other hand, the San Francisco Chronicle Edward Guthmann opined that Kusama [...] "ultimately undercuts her theme of female self-reliance by having Diana fall for Adrian" [...] and criticized the plot for [...] "tak too much time justifying a woman's right to be in the ring – instead of celebrating her achievement".|$|E
500|$|Eagle {{inspired}} several imitators, such as Valiant, Tiger, and Lion (which {{featured a}} Dan Dare clone, [...] "Captain Condor") but such adventure tales were less palatable for girls. [...] Female characters like Dan Dare's Professor Peabody (one {{of only two}} female main characters in the strip), were generally given less important roles <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>men,</b> {{and as a result}} a trend developed toward producing comics aimed specifically at either boys or girls. [...] Girl, a sister title to Eagle, appeared in November 1951, and featured youthful capers in boarding schools, and tales of equestrian adventure. [...] Later comics such as Jackie, descended from contemporary women's magazines, were more cosmopolitan in flavour. [...] Girl was followed in 1953 by Robin, which was aimed at younger children, and in March 1954 by Swift, for older readers.|$|E
500|$|Remember Last Night? {{was cleared}} by the PCA on September 24, 1935 and {{following}} previews in October, opened on November 4. Financially {{the film was}} a failure that according to Laemmle lost money for the studio. Critical reception was mixed. The Hollywood Reporter called the film [...] "a murder mystery to kid all murder mysteries" [...] and [...] "a riot of comedy spots superimposed on a riot of crime detecting". Whale, the reviewer found, [...] "let himself go in a riotous directorial splurge". Although less effusive, The New York Times praised the film as [...] "good minor fun" [...] and noted the likeable pairing of Young and Cummings. Ed Brophy, Edward Arnold and Arthur Treacher were also singled out for praise. However, the Times concluded that Remember Last Night? should be enjoyed [...] "in moderation" [...] as the [...] "halfwit behavior of the roisterers in the film" [...] may make the viewer come away [...] "with the feeling that one or two additional murders among the madcap principals would have made Long Island a still better place to live in". Variety was strongly disapproving of the film. [...] "The women are more blotto <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>men,</b> {{and two of the}} wives are on the make. It's all faintly unwholesome." ...|$|E

500|$|The Kazon's {{design was}} {{formulated}} around {{the beginning of}} June 1994. The series' make-up supervisor Michael Westmore was heavily involved {{in the creation of}} the look for the Kazon. While describing the species' facial features, Westmore said he constructed a skin protrusion along the nose and front of the face to simulate [...] "a soft cockscomb, a rooster comb" [...] rather than [...] "the dinosaur bone-type of ridges". He said that there were very small visual differences between Kazon males and females, with the distinguishing characteristic being women having a more delicate physicality <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>men.</b> According to Westmore, the prosthetic make-up for the forehead was structured in a shape reminiscent of the Devil, while the ridges on the nose were inspired by a vulture's neck. The nose designs were modified throughout the first two seasons with the addition of a nose tip and spikes protruding from the nostrils. The Kazon's design was the subject of fan criticism following the series premiere, with one fan commenting: [...] "They look like they're all having a bad hair day." [...] When Anthony De Longis first saw the headdress worn as a part of Culluh's costume, he joked that: [...] "Culluh must be the leader because he has the biggest head of hair." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the days}} after the lynching, {{newspapers}} fiercely condemned the event. Within a week, news of the lynching was published as far away as London. A New York Times editorial opined that, [...] "in no other land even pretending to be civilized could a man be burned to death in the streets of a considerable city amid the savage exultation of its inhabitants". In the New York Age, James Weldon Johnson described the members of the lynch mob as [...] "lower than any other people who at present inhabit the earth". Although many southern newspapers had previously defended lynching as a defense of civilized society, after Washington's death, they did not cast the practice in such terms. The Montgomery Advertiser wrote that, [...] "no savage was ever more cruel ... <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> who participated in this horrible, almost unbelievable episode". In Texas, the Houston Chronicle and the Austin American criticized the lynch mob, but spoke highly of Waco. The Morning News of Dallas reported the story, but did not publish an accompanying editorial. In Waco, the Times-Herald refrained from editorializing about the lynching. The Waco Morning News briefly noted their disapproval of the lynching, focusing their criticism on papers they felt had attacked the city unfairly. They cast the condemnatory editorials {{in the aftermath of the}} lynching as [...] "Holier than thou" [...] remarks. A writer for the Waco Semi-Weekly Tribune defended the lynching, stating that Washington deserved to die and that blacks should view Washington's death as a warning against crime. The paper later carried an editorial from the Houston Post condemning the lynching, characterizing the column as part of an attack on the city.|$|E

2500|$|A mechitza most {{commonly}} means the physical divider placed between the men's and women's sections in Orthodox synagogues and at religious celebrations. [...] The idea behind this is twofold. [...] First, mingling {{of the sexes}} is generally frowned upon, as this leads to frivolity, which itself may lead to promiscuity. Secondly, even if the sexes are separated, {{they should not be}} able to interact to a high degree during a religious service, lest this lead to gazing and impure thoughts. [...] Due to these restrictions, mechitzot are usually opaque (at least looking from the men's side to the women's side). Some mechitzot divide the front and back of the synagogue, but others have mechitzot dividing the left and right sides of the synagogue; for example, the Hebrew Institute of Riverdale does this. This is often seen as more equal since the women are not farther away from the service <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>men.</b>|$|E

2500|$|In November Ceylon was in convoy {{with some}} eight other Indiamen {{when she got}} caught in a hurricane.
