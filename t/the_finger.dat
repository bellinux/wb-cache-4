50|$|<b>The</b> <b>fingers</b> {{are long}} and slender. <b>The</b> first <b>finger</b> is longer than the second, and <b>the</b> third <b>finger</b> is longer than the snout; the tubercles on the undersides of <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> are {{moderately}} sized. The tips of <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> possess enlarged discs, with grooves running around each pad separating the top part from the bottom part. The toes are webbed but <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> are not.|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} whether the relative positions of <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> influence tactile localization, {{participants were asked}} to localize tactile stimuli applied to their fingertips. We measured the location and rate of errors for three finger configurations: fingers stretched out and together so that they are touching each other, fingers stretched out and spread apart maximally and fingers stretched out with the two hands {{on top of each other}} so that <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> are interwoven. When <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> contact each other, it is likely that the error rate to <b>the</b> adjacent <b>fingers</b> will be higher than when <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> are spread apart. In particular, we reasoned that localization would probably improve when <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> are spread. We aimed at assessing whether such adjacency was measured in external coordinates (taking proprioception into account) or on the body (in skin coordinates). The results confirmed that the error rate was lower when <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> were spread. However, there was no decrease in error rate to neighbouring fingertips in <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> spread condition in comparison with <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> together condition. In an additional experiment, we showed that the lower error rate when <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> were spread was not related to the continuous tactile input from <b>the</b> neighbouring <b>fingers</b> when <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> were together. <b>The</b> current results suggest that information from proprioception is taken into account in perceiving the location of a stimulus on one of the fingertip...|$|R

5|$|Linguist Jesse Sheidlower {{traces the}} gesture's {{development}} in the United States to the 1890s. According to anthropologist Desmond Morris, the gesture probably came to the United States via Italian immigrants. The first documented appearance of <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> in the United States was in 1886, when Old Hoss Radbourn, a baseball pitcher for the Boston Beaneaters, was photographed giving it {{to a member of}} their rival the New York Giants. In the film Speedy (1928), Harold Lloyd's character gives himself <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> into a distorting mirror at Luna Park, about 24 minutes into the film.|$|E
5|$|New York State Route38 (NY38) is a north–south {{state highway}} in <b>the</b> <b>Finger</b> Lakes region of New York in the United States. Its {{southern}} terminus {{is at an}} intersection with NY96 {{in the town of}} Owego in Tioga County. The northern terminus is at a junction with NY104A in the town of Sterling in Cayuga County. NY38 is a two-lane local road for most of its length. The route is the main access road to parts of Auburn, Dryden, Newark Valley and Port Byron. It passes through mountainous terrain in Tioga and Cortland counties, but the terrain levels out as it heads through <b>the</b> <b>Finger</b> Lakes area and Cayuga County.|$|E

40|$|Viscous fingers {{have been}} {{produced}} in the lifting Hele-Shaw cell (LHSC), with concentric circular grooves etched onto the lower plate. The invading fluid (air) enters the defending newtonian fluid-olive oil, as fingers proceeding radially inwards towards <b>the</b> centre. <b>The</b> <b>fingers</b> are interrupted at the circular groove, and reform as secondary <b>fingers.</b> <b>The</b> effect of the grooves is to speed up <b>the</b> <b>fingering</b> process considerably and <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> now reach <b>the</b> centre much faster. We explain this by comparing the variation with time, in velocity of <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> in <b>the</b> normal LHSC and the grooved cells. In the normal lifting HS cell <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> move fastest on initial formation and slow down later. Since in case of the grooved plate, <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> reform and receive a boost in their speed each time they encounter a groove, <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> proceed to <b>the</b> centre faster.

5|$|In {{the late}} nineteenth century German {{immigrants}} brought with them Riesling vines, named Johannisberg Riesling to qualify them as “legitimate” German Riesling. New York, particularly in <b>the</b> <b>Finger</b> Lakes region, was one of the earliest U.S. producers of Riesling. Plantings started to appear in California by 1857 and followed in Washington State in 1871.|$|E

50|$|Hand {{clasping}} is the superposition of each {{finger of}} one hand over <b>the</b> corresponding <b>finger</b> of <b>the</b> opposite hand. When clasping the hands, a person tends to interlace <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> {{in one of two}} ways. People who hold <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> of <b>the</b> right hand above <b>the</b> left <b>fingers</b> are classified as phenotype R (right), while those who hold <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> of <b>the</b> left hand above those of the right are phenotype L (left).|$|R
50|$|Knuckle-walking {{tends to}} evolve when <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> of <b>the</b> forelimb are {{specialized}} for tasks other than locomotion on the ground. In <b>the</b> gorilla <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> {{are used for}} the manipulation of food, and in chimpanzees for the manipulation of food and for climbing. In anteaters and pangolins <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> have large claws for opening the mounds of social insects. Platypus fingers have webbing that extend past <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> to aid in swimming, thus knuckle-walking is used to prevent stumbling.|$|R
5000|$|If {{you look}} at <b>the</b> <b>fingers,</b> you will notice that <b>the</b> index <b>finger</b> is shorter than <b>the</b> middle <b>finger.</b> If you place a pencil across the fingertips, {{you will see a}} {{diagonal}} line. This line is [...] "the angle of <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> to <b>the</b> string". As noted above in the section about holding <b>the</b> guitar, <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> fall at an angle to the strings and this line, across the tips of the index and middle <b>fingers</b> is <b>the</b> angle at which they touch <b>the</b> strings (a <b>finger</b> stays behind).|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>fingering</b> of <b>the</b> chanter {{is usually}} semi-closed for high pitched instruments, {{which means that}} <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> of <b>the</b> lower hand (which is usually the right hand) are placed on their holes when {{removing}} <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> of <b>the</b> upper hand. Chanters of 20 inches or greater are generally played with open fingering.|$|R

5|$|As {{a result}} of <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> spinners' success, Australian captain Ian Johnson tried to convert Davidson into a left arm {{orthodox}} spinner. Davidson returned as Australia faced a fourth meeting with Laker and Lock, in a match against Surrey immediately after the two consecutive Test maulings. On a sticky wicket that played {{into the hands of}} the Surrey spinners, Australia were skittled for 143. Only Davidson, who took the attack to the pair, made 44 not out. One six that he lofted from Laker almost reached the iconic gasometer outside The Oval. The match was drawn, and Davidson took 2/50 including Eric Bedser and Laker in his new role as a slow bowler.|$|E
5|$|Athletes, {{including}} Stefan Effenberg, Ron Artest, Luis Suárez, Juan Pablo Montoya, Iván Rodríguez, Danny Graves, Jack McDowell, Natasha Zvereva, Josh Smith, Bryan Cox, and Johnny Manziel {{have been}} suspended or fined for making the gesture. José Paniagua was released by the Chicago White Sox after giving the middle finger to an umpire; he hasn't played in the majors since. Baseball executive Chub Feeney once resigned after giving <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> to fans on Fan Appreciation Night. Bud Adams, owner of the National Football League's Tennessee Titans, was fined US$250,000 for giving both middle fingers to the fans of the Buffalo Bills during a game. Professional wrestler Stone Cold Steve Austin is also famous for flashing one or both middle fingers {{as part of his}} gimmick.|$|E
5|$|Maria {{competed in}} the Diva Search in 2004, {{deciding}} to enter the contest after seeing an advertisement while watching Raw. Even though she only placed fifth in the contest, she {{was hired by the}} company. She stood out in the contest by giving fellow contestant Carmella DeCesare <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> after being eliminated from the contest. Maria began making appearances in Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW), WWE's then-developmental territory. She contributed booking ideas, and her work at OVW earned her a spot on the Raw brand roster. Maria was brought on to Raw as a ditzy backstage interviewer and the host of WWE KissCam in November 2004. Her gimmick involved her asking wrong questions, irritating and amusing the roster.|$|E

40|$|This paper studies cages of convex {{polygonal}} objects {{using three}} point <b>fingers.</b> <b>The</b> <b>fingers</b> {{are said to}} cage the object when {{it is impossible to}} move the object arbitrarily far from its initial placement without penetrating <b>the</b> <b>fingers.</b> We consider a three-parameter model of the relative position of <b>the</b> <b>fingers,</b> which gives complete generality for three point <b>fingers</b> in <b>the</b> plane. We consider robustness of caging grasps - what variations in the relative position of <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> is allowed without breaking the cage. Using a simple decomposition of free space around the polygon, we present an algorithm which gives all caging placements of <b>the</b> <b>fingers</b> and a characterization of the robustness of these cages, albeit at the cost of significant computational complexity...|$|R

5|$|Nevin in 2002 played first base, {{which was}} {{considered}} his strongest defensive position. But injuries shortened his 2002 and 2003 seasons. In 2002, he missed {{time with a}} strained left elbow. Three games after returning from the elbow injury, he broke his arm diving for a ground ball, causing him to miss another six weeks. After being heckled by a fan during a September 2002 game, Nevin gave the fan <b>the</b> <b>finger,</b> for which he apologized.|$|E
5|$|New York State Route64 (NY64) is a north–south {{state highway}} in <b>the</b> <b>Finger</b> Lakes region of New York in the United States. Its {{southern}} terminus {{is at an}} intersection with NY21 in the hamlet of Bristol Springs within the town of South Bristol, Ontario County. The northern terminus is at a junction with NY96 and NY252 {{in the village of}} Pittsford, Monroe County. NY64 is a mostly two-lane highway that primarily serves as a connector between the southeastern suburbs of the city of Rochester and the Canandaigua Lake area, home to Bristol Mountain Ski Resort. Near the midpoint of the route, NY64 has an overlap with U.S. Route20 (US20) and NY5 that takes the route through the village of Bloomfield.|$|E
5|$|On February 2, 1425, Bartolomeo Valori and Cosimo de' Medici {{requested}} 400 of the 800florins {{that had}} been deposited with the Calimala, likely for work already completed. This deposit was insurance in case the executors left the tomb unfinished and the Calimala was forced to pay for its completion, {{as it had been}} obliged to with <b>the</b> <b>finger</b> reliquary. This request is also the most direct piece of evidence for Cosimo's involvement with the commissioning. Despite this document, Vasari's claim in his Vite of 1550 that Cosimo was responsible for the handling of the commission has been questioned.|$|E
