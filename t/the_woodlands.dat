5|$|By the 1820s, animal {{resources}} were in {{decline in the}} area leading to increased competition among the tribes for game and for furs to sell. Collusion among the fur trading companies led to a dramatic drop in fur prices during the late 1820s causing impoverishment for many Sioux hunters. The U.S. government strongly encouraged the tribes to turn from hunting to farming, trading <b>the</b> <b>woodlands</b> for the plains.|$|E
5|$|From {{source to}} mouth, 10% of the {{watershed}} is in New Castle, 42% {{in the town}} of Mount Pleasant, 33% in Greenburgh, and 14% in Yonkers. 63% of the watershed consists of dense urban or less dense suburban land development, 34% forest, and 1% agricultural. <b>The</b> <b>woodlands</b> buffering the river and the South County Trailway {{is one of the few}} significant areas of open space in the county south of I-287.|$|E

5|$|After , {{the road}} bent {{back to the}} east, leaving <b>the</b> <b>woodlands</b> behind as it passed south of the Miner Institute. The {{research}} complex led to another stretch of isolated homes along NY191, centered on the route's interchange with the Adirondack Northway (I-87). Not far from the junction, NY191 entered the hamlet of Chazy, a small community located on the Little Chazy River. The route bypassed most of Chazy, skirting {{the northern edge of}} the hamlet as it headed northeast to a junction with US9. NY191 ended here while CR23 follows the state-maintained US9 south into downtown Chazy.|$|E

50|$|The {{park was}} created from lands {{purchased}} by Glasgow City Council from Sir Archibald Campbell of Succoth, in 1922. As well as <b>the</b> <b>woodland</b> area (originally called the Belvidere plantation), the Council also purchased some grassy areas {{to the south}} of <b>the</b> <b>woodland.</b> Sir Archibald then gifted an area of land contaminated with oil shale waste adjoining the eastern boundary of <b>the</b> <b>woodland.</b> <b>The</b> council levelled and grassed over that area to form a recreation area laid out with football pitches.|$|R
5|$|Found {{mainly in}} Central and Southern Europe {{as well as}} North Africa, Boletus aereus is rare in colder climates such as England, and {{classified}} as a vulnerable species in the Czech Republic. Boletus aereus can be locally abundant; {{it is the most}} common bolete in <b>the</b> <b>woodlands</b> of Madonie Regional Natural Park in northern Sicily. In contrast, it has been placed on a provisional Red List of endangered species of Montenegro. Boletus aereus has been reported from several other island ecosystems across the Mediterranean, such as Corsica, Cyprus, Lesvos, and Naxos.|$|E
5|$|Gwyn died in {{the late}} evening of July 17, 1906 while visited his daughter, Mrs. Frank L. Rehn (Margaret), {{at her home in}} Yonkers, New York.

His body was taken back to Philadelphia, where he was interred in <b>the</b> <b>Woodlands</b> Cemetery following a military funeral on July 19, 1906. He was buried in the cemetery plot section E, Lot 33 that he bought over fifty years earlier.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to bald eagles, which {{live in the}} IBA year round and have successfully established a breeding population there, the IBA is home to belted kingfishers, scarlet tanagers, black-throated blue warblers, common mergansers, blue and green heron, hermit thrushes, and wood ducks. Large numbers of ospreys use the gorge during spring and fall migration periods. <b>The</b> <b>woodlands</b> are inhabited by the ruffed grouse, Pennsylvania's state bird, and wild turkeys. Swainson's thrush breeds in the IBA and the northern harrier breeds and overwinters in Pine Creek Gorge.|$|E
50|$|Being {{adjacent}} to <b>woodland,</b> plants of <b>the</b> <b>woodland</b> varieties grow along the fields edges, such as barren strawberry, wood spurge and wood avens, with various ferns. <b>The</b> <b>woodland</b> trees include oak, wild cherry and field maple.|$|R

50|$|The {{dominant}} {{trees of}} <b>the</b> <b>Woodland</b> Loop {{are members of}} the black oak family, towering white pines and American beech. The under story has American holly, highbush blueberry, sweet pepperbush and, along the Hannah Eames Brook, American hornbeam or “musclewood” trees. In warmer weather approximately fifteen species of ferns can be seen along <b>the</b> <b>Woodland</b> Loop. There is a witch-hazel grove at the intersection of <b>the</b> <b>Woodland</b> Loop and <b>the</b> Hannah Eames Brook Trail.|$|R
5|$|Oysters {{come from}} the Oléron-Marennes basin, while mussels {{come from the}} Bay of Aiguillon. High-quality produce comes from the region's hinterland, {{especially}} goat cheese. This region and in the Vendée is grazing ground for Parthenaise cattle, while poultry is raised in Challans. The region of Poitou-Charentes purportedly produces the best butter and cream in France. Cognac is also made in the region along the Charente River. Limousin {{is home to the}} high-quality Limousin cattle, as well as high quality sheep. <b>The</b> <b>woodlands</b> offer game and high-quality mushrooms. The southern area around Brive draws its cooking influence from Périgord and Auvergne to produce a robust cuisine.|$|E
5|$|The {{opening of}} the house {{required}} the construction of facilities for visitors and a restaurant was designed by Philip Jebb, and built {{to the north of}} the house, along with a shop and ticket office. Alterations have also been made to the gardens, for ease of access and of maintenance. In 1987, the Great Storm caused considerable damage, with some twenty-three trees being blown down in the gardens. Greater loss occurred in <b>the</b> <b>woodlands</b> surrounding the house, which lost over 70% of its trees.|$|E
5|$|Between 1982 and 1988 {{a series}} based on Irish {{architecture}} {{through the ages}} was released, with line drawings by Michael Craig and graphics by Peter Wildbur. It contained twenty-eight stamps, with values ranging from 1p to £5. Stamps based on Irish cultural heritage followed between 1990 and 1995. Irish birds feature in the 1997 series that span the conversion of currency from the Irish pound, through dual currency {{to the introduction of}} the Euro. These were the first definitives where all values were printed in full colour. On 9 September 2004 new stamps, featuring flowers native to <b>the</b> <b>woodlands</b> and hedgerows of Ireland, become available. These were replaced in September 2010 by a seventh series featuring animals and marine life using photographic images.|$|E
50|$|In 1972, Wilmeth {{completed}} his Doctorate in anthropology {{under the guidance}} of James Bennett Griffin at the University of Michigan with a dissertation titled, <b>The</b> <b>Woodland</b> Sequence in <b>the</b> Central Plains, which focused on cultures of <b>the</b> <b>Woodland</b> period.|$|R

50|$|Native Americans of <b>the</b> <b>Woodland</b> period {{lived in}} the region that the park now occupies, leaving behind mounds that can still be found in the area. People visiting the park can learn about these early {{inhabitants}} at <b>the</b> <b>Woodland</b> Interpretive Trail.|$|R
5|$|CR149 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY52 {{in the community}} of Youngsville. The route progresses northward, passing and paralleling Tremper Road, a dead-end road. CR149 passes by several residential homes in Youngsville, along with one local commercial building. After leaving the community, CR149 continues to the north as Shandelee Road, passing through the residential surroundings. After passing by a few more residences, Shandelee Road makes a bend to the northwest, and into more dense woodlands in the area. About a mile north of Youngsville, CR149 continues its way northward, passing by a local residence, and intersects with Stump Pond Road, which heads westward from the main highway. Shandalee Road makes another bend, this time to the north, passing through moderate development for about another mile. A short distance into the bend, <b>the</b> <b>woodlands</b> that were surrounding the highway clear and the highway becomes surrounded by fields and residential homes.|$|E
5|$|Late on 9 February, the Japanese {{made more}} landings, in the Causeway sector, {{held by the}} 27th Infantry Brigade. Despite having been reduced to just two {{infantry}} battalions due to {{the transfer of the}} 2/29th to the hard-pressed 22nd Infantry Brigade, they were able to mount a stiff defence, supported by the machine guns of 'B' Company. 8 Platoon inflicted many casualties in the Japanese landing craft coming ashore {{at the mouth of the}} Sungei Mandi. With casualties mounting and pressure being placed on the brigade's rear due to a large gap that had developed around Kranji, by the Japanese advances in the 22nd Infantry Brigade's area, the decision was made to withdraw from the beach and realign north–south along <b>the</b> <b>Woodlands</b> Road. Further south, the Australian 22nd and Indian 44th, 6th/15th and 12th Infantry Brigades also established themselves along this axis between Bukit Panjang and Pasir Panjang on the south coast and by early evening on 10 February the Japanese had secured the entire west coast of the island.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the many}} bird species {{found in the}} Mendips, the {{peregrine}} falcon (Falco peregrinus), which has gradually recolonised the area since the 1980s, is particularly significant. It breeds on sea and inland cliffs and {{on the faces of}} active and disused quarries. The upland heaths of the west Mendips have recently increased in ornithological importance due to colonisation by the Dartford warbler (Sylvia undata), which can be found at Black Down and Crook Peak. In Britain, this species is usually associated with lowland heath. <b>The</b> <b>woodlands</b> at Stock Hill are a breeding site for nightjars (Caprimulgus europaeus) and long-eared owls (Asio otus). The Waldegrave Pool, part of Priddy Mineries, is an important site for dragonflies, including downy emerald (Cordulia aenea) and four-spotted chaser (Libellula quadrimaculata). Waldegrave Pool is the only Mendip breeding site for downy emerald dragonflies. In 2007 the first confirmed sighting of a red kite (Milvus milvus) on the Mendips was made at Charterhouse.|$|E
