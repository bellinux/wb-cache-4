40|$|Charged {{defects in}} 2 D {{materials}} have emerging applications in quantum {{technologies such as}} quantum emitters and quantum computation. Advancement of these technologies requires rational design of ideal defect centers, demanding reliable computation methods for quantitatively accurate prediction of defect properties. We present an accurate, parameter-free and efficient procedure to evaluate quasiparticle defect states and thermodynamic charge <b>transition</b> <b>levels</b> of defects in 2 D materials. Importantly, we solve critical issues that stem from the strongly anisotropic screening in 2 D materials, that have so far precluded accurate prediction of charge <b>transition</b> <b>levels</b> in these materials. Using this procedure, we investigate various defects in monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) for their charge <b>transition</b> <b>levels,</b> stable spin states and optical excitations. We identify $C_BN_V$ (nitrogen vacancy adjacent to carbon substitution of boron) {{to be the most}} promising defect candidate for scalable quantum bit and emitter applications.

5000|$|The <b>transition</b> <b>level</b> {{includes}} all unfolded sedimentary and volcanic rocks of late Carboniferous (Stephanian) to mid-Permian (Guadalupian) age. [...] "Transition level" [...] refers, in part, to the stratigraphic position of these rocks: they are {{younger than the}} folded Variscides but older than the layers of the Mesozoic platform. In addition, they stem from a geological transition phase, which is characterised by the flattening of the Variscan mountains and by post-Variscan volcanism, which was accompanied by crustal extension in the Variscan Orogen. The rocks of the <b>transition</b> <b>level</b> differ from the younger platform sediments {{in that they are}} often relatively coarse-grained (conglomeratic) Molasse sedimentary rocks and acidic to intermediate volcanic rocks (especially rhyolite), whereas the Mesozoic platform has few conglomerates and no volcanic rocks. The <b>transition</b> <b>level</b> is divided lithostratigraphically into Stephanian and Permian (Rotliegend) sequences. Rocks of the <b>transition</b> <b>level</b> are found today mainly in the Saar-Nahe Basin, the Halle-Leipzig area (e.g. Halle Porphyry Complex), the Ore Mountain Basin and the Thuringian Forest.|$|E
50|$|However, in some countries, such as Norway for example, the <b>transition</b> <b>level</b> is {{determined}} by adding a buffer of minimum 1,000 ft (depending on QNH) to the transition altitude.

In those areas the transition layer will be 1,000-1,500 ft thick, depending on QNH.|$|E
40|$|Abstract – One {{method to}} {{characterize}} ADCs {{is to use}} a histogram, where Gaussian noise may be used as stimulus signal. However, a Gaussian noise signal that excites all <b>transition</b> <b>levels</b> also generates input values outside working range of the ADC. Modern signal generators can generate arbitrary signals. Hence, excluding undesired values outside the ADC full scale can minimize test sequences. Truncating the signal to the working range gives further advantages, which are explored in this paper. The statistical properties is theoretically evaluated and compared.

A switching between NV+, NV° and NV(-) can be performed with the Al-gates which apply electric fields in the hole depletion region of the Schottky junction that induces a band bending modulation, thereby shifting the Fermi-level over NV charge <b>transition</b> <b>levels.</b> We simulated the in-plane band structure of the Schottky junction with the Software ATLAS by solving the drift-diffusion model and the Poisson-equation self-consistently. We simulated the IV-characteristics, calculated {{the width of the}} hole depletion region, the position of the Fermi-level intersection with the NV charge <b>transition</b> <b>levels</b> for different reverse bias voltages applied on the Al-gate. We can show that the field-induced band bending modulation in the depletion region causes a shifting of the Fermi-level over NV charge <b>transition</b> <b>levels</b> {{in such a way that}} the charge state of a single NV centre and thus its electrical and optical properties is tuned. In addition, the NV centre should be approx. 1 - 2 µm away from the Al-edge in order to be switched with moderate bias voltages...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{comprehensive}} study of the vacancy in bulk silicon in all its charge states from 2 + to 2 -, using a supercell approach within plane-wave density-functional theory, and systematically quantify the various contributions to the well-known finite size errors associated with calculating formation energies and stable charge state <b>transition</b> <b>levels</b> of isolated defects with periodic boundary conditions. Furthermore, we find that <b>transition</b> <b>levels</b> converge faster with respect to supercell size when only the Gamma-point is sampled in the Brillouin zone, {{as opposed to a}} dense k-point sampling. This arises from the fact that defect level at the Gamma-point quickly converges to a fixed value which correctly describes the bonding at the defect centre. Our calculated <b>transition</b> <b>levels</b> with 1000 -atom supercells and Gamma-point only sampling are in good agreement with available experimental results. We also demonstrate two simple and accurate approaches for calculating the valence band offsets that are required for computing formation energies of charged defects, one based on a potential averaging scheme and the other using maximally-localized Wannier functions (MLWFs). Finally, we show that MLWFs provide a clear description {{of the nature of the}} electronic bonding at the defect centre that verifies the canonical Watkins model. Comment: 10 pages, 6 figure...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the mechanism of}} the intrinsic persistent luminescence of Er 2 O 3 in the A-type lattice based on first-principles calculations. We found that the native point defects were engaged in mutual subtle interactions {{in the form of}} chemical reactions between different charge states. The release of energy related to lattice distortion facilitates the conversion of energy for electrons to be transported between the valence band and the trap levels or even between the deep trap levels so as to generate persistent luminescence. The defect transitions that take place along the zero-phonon line release energy to enable optical transitions, with the exact amount of negative effective correlation energy determined by the lattice distortions. Our calculations on the thermodynamic <b>transition</b> <b>levels</b> confirm that both the visible and NIR experimentally observed intrinsic persistent luminescence (phosphor or afterglow) are related to the thermodynamic <b>transition</b> <b>levels</b> of oxygen-related defects, and the thermodynamic <b>transition</b> <b>levels</b> within different charge states for these defects are independent of the chemical potentials of the given species. Lattice distortion defects such as anion Frenkel (a-Fr) pair defects {{play an important role in}} transporting O-related defects between different lattice sites. To obtain red persistent luminescence that matches the biological therapeutic window, it is suggested to increase the electron <b>transition</b> <b>levels</b> between high-coordinated O vacancies and related metastable a-Fr defects; a close-packed core-shell structure is required to quench low-coordinated O-related defects so as to reduce the green band luminescence. We further established a conversed chain reaction (CCR) model to interpret the energy conversion process of persistent luminescence in terms of the inter-reactions of native point defects between different charge states. It is advantageous to use the study of defect levels combined with formation energies to suggest limits to doping energy and explain photostimulated luminescence in terms of native point defects.

40|$|Convergence of density-functional {{supercell}} calculations for defect formation energies, charge <b>transition</b> <b>levels,</b> localized defect state properties, and defect {{atomic structure}} and relaxation is investigated using the arsenic split interstitial in GaAs as an example.

Formation energies are calculated for the As split interstitial, Ga vacancy, and As antisite defects in GaAs, taking into account the dependence upon chemical potential and Fermi energy. It is found that equilibrium concentrations of As interstitials will be much lower than equilibrium concentrations of As antisites in As-rich, n-type or semi-insulating GaAs.

40|$|The {{structural}} and electronic properties of oxygen vacancies (V-Ox) and titanium interstitials (Ti-(i)) in {{the bulk of}} the rutile and anatase forms of TiO 2 have been investigated with LSD-GGA+U ab initio simulations. In particular, formation energies of the charged and neutral forms of the V-Ox and Ti-(i) defects as well as the corresponding vertical and thermodynamic <b>transition</b> <b>levels</b> have been estimated. The achieved results can reconcile the apparent inconsistency of experimentally observed deep donor levels with the n-type conductivity observed in reduced TiO 2. They show indeed that both defects give rise to vertical <b>transition</b> <b>levels</b> about 1 eV below the conduction band (CB), in agreement with experimental measures, and to thermodynamic <b>transition</b> <b>levels</b> close to the CB. That is, these defects behave as deep donors, when looking at vertical transitions, and as shallow donors, when the effects of the structural relaxations are taken into account. A major part of the explanation of this behavior is played by the polaron-like character of the defect states, which was already noted, but not deepened, in literature. Finally, it is shown that the application of the U correction to both Ti and O species gives qualitatively similar results, but with a better agreement to experimental findings, with respect to the application to Ti only. The former approach gives pretty similar results, for both rutile and anatase bulk properties, to those coming from HSE hybrid functional calculations...|$|R
40|$|Chemical {{defects in}} {{polyethylene}} (PE) can deleteriously downgrade its electrical properties and performance. Although these defects usually leave spectroscopic signatures {{in terms of}} characteristic luminescence peaks, it is nontrivial to make unambiguous assignments of the peaks to specific defect types. In this work, we go beyond traditional density functional theory calculations to determine defect-derived emission and absorption energies in PE. In particular, we characterize PE defect levels in terms of thermodynamic and adiabatic charge <b>transition</b> <b>levels</b> that involve total energy calculations of neutral and charged defects. Calculations are performed at several levels of theory including those involving (semi) local and hybrid electron exchange-correlation functionals, and many-body perturbation theory. With these critical elements, the calculated defect <b>transition</b> <b>levels</b> are in excellent correspondence to observed luminescence spectra of PE, thus clarifying and confirming {{the origins of the}} observed peaks.

Unintentional p-type conductivity in BaCuChF {{is explained by}} the presence of copper vacancies with <b>transition</b> <b>levels</b> in the valence band. These acceptor-like defects are partially compensated by donor-like chalcogen vacancies with <b>transition</b> <b>levels</b> deep in the gap. Chalcogen vacancies also cause the experimentally observed sub-gap photoluminescence, optical absorption, and persistent photoconductivity in BaCuSF and BaCuSeF. In thermodynamic equilibrium, both copper and chalcogen vacancies have low formation enthalpies and are likely to form defect complexes among themselves and with fluorine interstitials. The calculated Fermi level pinning range in BaCuChF is narrow and located close to the valence band maximum. It makes BaCuChF a suitable transparent p-type contact layer for optoelectronic applications, but hinders attempts to fabricate transparent thin film transistors using this material. Oxygen-related defects do not affect bulk BaCuChF properties, but surface oxidation decreases the mean free path of free holes by almost an order of magnitude. Comment: 28 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
