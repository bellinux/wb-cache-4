By applying grouping cells which are devoted to low-level geometry, boundary information can be completed such <b>that</b> segregated <b>regions</b> are obtained. Furthermore, we show that low-level geometry, in addition to rendering filled regions, provides important local cues like corners, bars and blobs for region categorisation. The integration of FoA, region segregation and categorisation is important for developing fast gist vision, i. e., which types of objects are about where in a scene. ...|$|R

The results show that closeness to urban centres is not necessarily beneficial for firm start-ups. On the contrary, regions further away from urban centres of any size experience more firm start-ups. One explanation of this result is <b>that</b> <b>regions</b> experience spatial protection from urban competition. However, regions located further away from larger-sized urban centres experience less firm start-ups due to such remoteness. One explanation of this finding is <b>that</b> remote <b>regions</b> cannot access the agglomeration benefits that larger cities offer. This supports the view <b>that</b> rural <b>regions</b> draw on urban resources but only on those from larger agglomerations...|$|R
