5|$|In May 2009, the Joint Working Party (JWP) of IUPAC {{published}} {{a report on}} <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> <b>of</b> copernicium in which they acknowledged <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> <b>of</b> the isotope 283Cn. This implied <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> <b>of</b> flerovium, from the acknowledgement of {{the data for the}} synthesis of 287Fl and 291Lv, which decay to 283Cn. <b>The</b> <b>discovery</b> <b>of</b> the isotopes flerovium-286 and -287 was confirmed in January 2009 at Berkeley. This was followed by confirmation of flerovium-288 and -289 in July 2009 at the Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung (GSI) in Germany. In 2011, IUPAC evaluated the Dubna team experiments of 1999–2007. They found the early data inconclusive, but accepted the results of 2004–2007 as flerovium, and the element was officially recognized as having been discovered.|$|E
5|$|A major {{development}} {{in the second half}} of the 19th century was a rapid expansion of paleontology in North America. In 1858 Joseph Leidy described a Hadrosaurus skeleton, which was the first North American dinosaur to be described from good remains. However, it was the massive westward expansion of railroads, military bases, and settlements into Kansas and other parts of the Western United States following the American Civil War that really fueled the expansion of fossil collection. The result was an increased understanding of the natural history of North America, including <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> <b>of</b> the Western Interior Sea that had covered Kansas and much of the rest of the Midwestern United States during parts of the Cretaceous, <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> <b>of</b> several important fossils of primitive birds and horses, and <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> <b>of</b> a number of new dinosaur genera including Allosaurus, Stegosaurus, and Triceratops. Much of this activity was part of a fierce personal and professional rivalry between two men, Othniel Marsh, and Edward Cope, which has become known as the Bone Wars.|$|E
5|$|After the Venice 1640–41 revival {{there is}} no record of further {{performances}} of Il ritorno in Venice, or elsewhere, before <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> <b>of</b> the music manuscript in the 19th century. <b>The</b> <b>discovery</b> <b>of</b> this manuscript in Vienna suggests that at some time the opera was staged there, or at least contemplated, perhaps before the Imperial court. The Monteverdi scholar Alan Curtis dates the manuscript's arrival in Vienna to 1675, during the reign of the Emperor LeopoldI who was a considerable patron of the arts, and opera in particular.|$|E

5|$|Archaeological {{investigations}} were undertaken from 1859 to 1874 by William Boyd Dawkins, {{who moved}} to Somerset to study classics with the vicar of Wookey. On hearing of <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> <b>of</b> bones by local workmen he led excavations {{in the area of}} the hyena den. His work led to <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> <b>of</b> the first evidence for the use by Palaeolithic man in the Caves of the Mendip Hills. Middle Paleolithic tools have been found in association with butchered bones with a radiocarbon age of around 41,000 years.|$|E
5|$|As both {{scientists}} discovered thallium {{independently and}} {{a large part of}} the work, especially the isolation of the metallic thallium was done by Lamy, Crookes tried to secure his priority on the work. Lamy was awarded a medal at the International Exhibition in London 1862: For <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> <b>of</b> a new and abundant source of thallium and after heavy protest Crookes also received a medal: thallium, for <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> <b>of</b> the new element. The controversy between both scientists continued through 1862 and 1863. Most of the discussion ended after Crookes was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in June 1863.|$|E

5|$|During the 19th century, a {{significant}} part of the world's production of cobalt blue (a dye made with cobalt compounds and alumina) and smalt (cobalt glass powdered for use for pigment purposes in ceramics and painting) was carried out at the Norwegian Blaafarveværket. The first mines for the production of smalt in the 16th century were located in Norway, Sweden, Saxony and Hungary. With <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> <b>of</b> cobalt ore in New Caledonia in 1864, the mining of cobalt in Europe declined. With <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> <b>of</b> ore deposits in Ontario, Canada in 1904 and <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> <b>of</b> even larger deposits in the Katanga Province in the Congo in 1914, the mining operations shifted again. When the Shaba conflict started in 1978, the copper mines of Katanga Province nearly stopped production. The impact on the world cobalt economy from this conflict was smaller than expected: cobalt is a rare metal, the pigment is highly toxic, and the industry had already established effective ways for recycling cobalt materials. In some cases, industry was able to change to cobalt-free alternatives.|$|E
