25|$|The fights {{are held}} {{outdoors}} in an oval ring (douzha), which was traditionally a flat clay pot but is more commonly a plastic container today. Crickets are stimulated with a <b>tickler</b> (cao) {{made of a}} rat's whisker hairs (Beijing style) or of fresh grass strands (Shanghai style). The handler tickles the cricket's head, then the abdomen, and finally the hind legs. Each fight consists of three or five bouts; the winner must score in two of three or three of five bouts. A bout is stopped when the triumphant winner extends his wings {{as a sign of}} victory, or when his opponent flees from the action. Laufer wrote that the fights of his time usually ended in the death of one of the crickets: The winners physically beheaded their opponents. Present-day fights may look vicious but are not lethal; the loser is always allowed to flee from the winner.|$|E

Row said the sculpture evoked the curves of sculptor Richard Serra and design style of architect Frank Gehry.

500|$|Laboratory rats (which are brown rats, Rattus norvegicus) emit short, high frequency, {{ultrasonic}} vocalizations during purportedly pleasurable experiences such as rough-and-tumble play, when anticipating routine {{doses of}} morphine, during mating, and when tickled. The vocalization, {{described as a}} distinct [...] "chirping", has been likened to laughter, and is interpreted as an expectation of something rewarding. In clinical studies, the chirping is associated with positive emotional feelings, and social bonding occurs with the <b>tickler,</b> resulting in the rats becoming conditioned to seek the tickling. However, as the rats age, the tendency to chirp declines. Like most rat vocalizations, the chirping is at frequencies too high for humans to hear without special equipment, so bat detectors {{have been used for}} this purpose.|$|E

60|$|The {{first of}} these, or the theoretic faculty, is {{concerned}} with the moral perception and appreciation of ideas of beauty.

60|$|I {{took the}} advice.
