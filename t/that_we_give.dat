500|$|In February 2006, Willis {{appeared}} in Manhattan {{to talk about}} his film 16 Blocks with reporters. One reporter attempted to ask Willis about his opinion on the current government, but was interrupted by Willis in mid-sentence: [...] "I'm sick of answering this fucking question. I'm a Republican only as far as I want a smaller government, I want less government intrusion. I want them to stop shitting on my money and your money and tax dollars <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>give</b> 50 percent of every year. I want them to be fiscally responsible and I want these goddamn lobbyists out of Washington. Do that and I'll say I'm a Republican. I hate the government, OK? I'm apolitical. Write that down. I'm not a Republican." ...|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after the}} episode {{featuring}} the kiss was aired, the characters {{were attacked by}} talkback callers and conservative groups who thought {{that they had been}} [...] "glamorising a high-risk culture" [...] and [...] "making homosexuality look cool". Chief executive of the Christian group Salt Shakers, Peter Stokes, told The Age's Kenneth Nguyen, [...] "It just saddens me <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>give</b> our young people the message that these relationships are OK." [...] However, Ray Misson, the head of Melbourne University's arts education department, described the serial's depiction of a lesbian as [...] "a real advance." [...] Neval believed that gay teenagers, who were already feeling insecure about how their sexuality would be accepted, would be devastated by the negative reaction surrounding the storyline.|$|E

500|$|Outliers has two parts: [...] "Part One: Opportunity" [...] {{contains}} five chapters, and [...] "Part Two: Legacy" [...] has four. The {{book also}} contains an Introduction and Epilogue. Focusing on outliers, defined by Gladwell {{as people who}} do not fit into our normal understanding of achievement, Outliers deals with exceptional people, especially those who are smart, rich, and successful, and those who operate at the extreme outer edge of what is statistically plausible. The book offers examples that include the musical ensemble The Beatles, Microsoft's co-founder Bill Gates, and the theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer. In the introduction, Gladwell lays out the purpose of Outliers: [...] "It's not enough to ask what successful people are like. [...] It is only by asking where they are from that we can unravel the logic behind who succeeds and who doesn't." [...] Throughout the publication, he discusses how family, culture, and friendship each play a role in an individual's success, and he constantly asks whether successful people deserve the praise <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>give</b> them.|$|E
500|$|In 1986, Dawkins and {{biologist}} John Maynard Smith {{participated in}} an Oxford Union debate against A. E. Wilder-Smith (a Young Earth creationist) and Edgar Andrews (president of the Biblical Creation Society). In general, however, Dawkins has followed {{the advice of his}} late colleague Stephen Jay Gould and refused to participate in formal debates with creationists because [...] "what they seek is the oxygen of respectability", and doing so would [...] "give them this oxygen by the mere act of engaging with them at all". He suggests that creationists [...] "don't mind being beaten in an argument. What matters is <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>give</b> them recognition by bothering to argue with them in public." [...] In a December 2004 interview with American journalist Bill Moyers, Dawkins said that [...] "among the things that science does know, evolution is about as certain as anything we know." [...] When Moyers questioned him {{on the use of the}} word theory, Dawkins stated that [...] "evolution has been observed. It's just that it hasn't been observed while it's happening." [...] He added that [...] "it is rather like a detective coming on a murder after the scene... the detective hasn't actually seen the murder take place, of course. But what you do see is a massive clue... Huge quantities of circumstantial evidence. It might as well be spelled out in words of English." ...|$|E

This means that its task is not to coerce people into new places against their associations, wishes, and interest, as we find bad schemes trying to do. Instead its task is to find the right places for each sort of people; place where they will really flourish. To give people in fact the same care <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>give</b> when transplanting flowers, instead of harsh evictions and arbitrary instructions to 'move on', delivered in the manner of an officious policeman." ...|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the most}} notable tracks is [...] "Ja In A Bra" [...] a diss track to rapper Ja Rule for the feud he had with Shady Records which Proof was a part of. Also Ja Rule dissed Proof in a {{freestyle}} on [...] "It's Murda" [...] by saying [...] "Y'all haven't heard yet that nigga change is 'Loose' and I got [...] "Proof" [...] get it, I got 'Proof'" [...] and on [...] "The Wrap" [...] with [...] "Nah, I'ma give it to you, The same way <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>gave</b> it to 'Proof', The same way <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>gave</b> it to 'Loose'". The track list was printed wrongly on the album, with tracks 8 and 9 being interchanged.|$|R

2500|$|During a {{press conference}} on 6 July 2016 U.S. President Obama said he would draw down troops to 8,400 {{by the end of}} his {{administration}} in December 2016. He said the troops remaining in Afghanistan would continue to be focused on training and advising the Afghan military and engaging in counterterrorism efforts. The president warned that a deteriorating security situation in Afghanistan could overwhelm Afghan government partners without further assistance. [...] "It’s in our national interest – after all the blood and treasure we have invested – <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>give</b> our Afghan partners the support to succeed," [...] said Obama. [...] "This is where al-Qaida is trying to regroup, where Isil is trying to expand its presence," [...] he added. [...] "If they succeed, they will attempt more attacks against us." ...|$|E
2500|$|Shapin and Schaffer state, {{in their}} first chapter Understanding Experiment, that they wish to answer the question, [...] "Why does one do {{experiments}} in order to arrive at scientific truth?" [...] Their aim {{is to use a}} historical account of the debate over the validity of Boyle's air pump experiments, and by extension his experimental method, to discover the origins of the credibility <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>give</b> experimentally produced facts today. [...] The authors wish to avoid [...] "'The self-evident'" [...] method, which (they explain) is when historians project the values of their current culture onto the time period that they are studying (in this case valuing the benefits of empiricism). [...] They wish to take a [...] "stranger's" [...] viewpoint when examining the debate between Hobbes and Boyle because, in the 1660s, both methods of knowledge production were well respected in the academic community and the reasons that Boyle's experimentalism prevailed over Hobbes's natural philosophy would not have been obvious to contemporaries.|$|E
2500|$|... {{material}} from the writings of eminent clerics Joseph and Richard Alleine. In 1780, Wesley printed an excerpt from Richard Alleine's Vindiciae Pietatis, which is prayer for renewal of a believer's covenant with God. This excerpt, known in modified form as the Wesley Covenant Prayer, remained in use—linked with Holy Communion and observed on the first Sunday of the New Year—among Wesleyan Methodists until 1936. In the 1920s, Wesleyan minister George B. Robson expanded {{the form of the}} Covenant Service by replacing most of the exhortation with prayers of adoration, thanksgiving and confession. Robson's Covenant Service was revised and officially authorised for use in the Book of Offices (1936). Further revisions, strengthening the link with Communion and intercession for the wider church and the world, appeared in the Service Book (1975) and Worship Book (1999). The Wesley Covenant Prayer, which has been adopted by other Christian traditions, has been described as [...] "a celebration of all that God has done and an affirmation <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>give</b> our lives and choices to God".|$|E

5000|$|Mansfield {{delivered}} a eulogy on November 24, 1963, as President Kennedy's casket lay in {{state in the}} Capitol rotunda, saying, [...] "He <b>gave</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> might <b>give</b> of ourselves, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> might <b>give</b> to one another until {{there would be no}} room, no room at all, for the bigotry, the hatred, prejudice, and the arrogance which converged in that moment of horror to strike him down." ...|$|R
2500|$|American {{theoretical}} {{physicist and}} cosmologist Lawrence Krauss said, [...] "Christopher was {{a beacon of}} knowledge and light {{in a world that}} constantly threatens to extinguish both. He had the courage to accept the world for just what it is and not what he wanted it to be. That's the highest praise, I believe, one can give to any intellect. He understood that the universe doesn't care about our existence or welfare and he epitomized the realization that our lives have meaning only to the extent <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>give</b> them meaning." [...] Bill Maher paid tribute to Hitchens on his show Real Time with Bill Maher, saying, [...] "We lost a hero of mine, a friend, and one of the great talk show guests of all time." [...] Salman Rushdie and English comedian Stephen Fry paid tribute at the Christopher Hitchens Vanity Fair Memorial 2012. Three weeks before Hitchens's death, George Eaton of the New Statesman wrote, [...] "He is determined to ensure that he is not remembered simply as a 'lefty who turned right' or as a contrarian and provocateur. Throughout his career, he has retained a commitment to the Enlightenment values of reason, secularism and pluralism. His targets—Mother Teresa, Bill Clinton, Henry Kissinger, God—are chosen not at random, but rather because they have offended {{one or more of these}} principles. The tragedy of Hitchens' illness is that it came at a time when he enjoyed a larger audience than ever. The great polemicist is certain to be remembered, but, as he is increasingly aware, perhaps not as he would like." [...] The Chronicle of Higher Education asked if Hitchens was the last public intellectual.|$|E
