5|$|A tornado is a violently {{rotating}} {{column of}} air {{that is in}} contact with both <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>earth</b> and a cumulonimbus cloud or, in rare cases, {{the base of a}} cumulus cloud. Also referred to as twisters, a collequial term in America, or cyclones, although the word cyclone is used in meteorology, in a wider sense, to name any closed low-pressure circulation.|$|E
40|$|A {{sharp edge}} is formed on an optical device {{by placing the}} optical device in a holding mechanism; {{grinding}} one surface so that it and a <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> holding mechanism are co-planar; and polishing both <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> optical device and <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> holding mechanism with felt until an edge on <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> optical device adjacent to <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> holding mechanism obtains a desired sharpness...|$|R
40|$|An {{article is}} welded, as in weld repair of a defect, by {{positioning}} a weld lift-off block {{at a location}} on <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> article adjacent to <b>the</b> intended location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> weldment on <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> article. The weld lift-off block has a wedge shape including a base contacting <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> article, and an upper face angled upwardly from the base from a base leading edge. A weld pool is formed on <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> article by directly heating <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> article using a heat source. The heat source is moved relative to <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> article and onto <b>the</b> upper <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> weld lift-off block by crossing <b>the</b> leading edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wedge, without discontinuing <b>the</b> direct heating <b>of</b> <b>the</b> article by the heat source. <b>The</b> heating <b>of</b> <b>the</b> article with the heat source is discontinued only after the heat source is directly heating <b>the</b> upper face <b>of</b> <b>the</b> weld lift-off block, and not the article...|$|R
40|$|To enhance <b>the</b> staying quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> copperplate, {{the laser}} hybrid {{cladding}} {{technology can be}} used to clad Ni-Cr alloy on <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> copperplate.

5|$|Rock {{units are}} first emplaced either by {{deposition}} {{onto the surface}} or intrude into the overlying rock. Deposition can occur when sediments settle onto <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> and later lithify into sedimentary rock, or when as volcanic material such as volcanic ash or lava flows, blanket the surface. Igneous intrusions such as batholiths, laccoliths, dikes, and sills, push upwards into the overlying rock, and crystallize as they intrude.|$|E
5|$|The ARCHER imaging system, mounted {{aboard the}} GA8 Airvan, uses visible and {{near-infrared}} light to examine <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> and find suspected crash sites, evaluate areas affected by disasters, or examine foliage from an airborne perspective {{in order to}} flag possible marijuana plantations.

5|$|The {{earthquake}} {{came at a}} {{time when}} Japan was undergoing a transformation into a more industrial nation and while advancing its scientific understanding in many fields. Damage from the event was widespread and the loss of life was significant. The many kilometers of visible fault breaks on <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>earth</b> presented scientists with opportunities for field investigations that ultimately led to an improved understanding of the fault scarps that earthquakes often generate.|$|E

5|$|The heat {{needed for}} geyser {{formation}} comes from magma {{that needs to}} be near <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>earth.</b> The fact that geysers need heat much higher than normally found near the earth's surface is the reason they are associated with volcanoes or volcanic areas. The pressures encountered at the areas where the water is heated make the boiling point of the water much higher than at normal atmospheric pressures.|$|E
5|$|Many Massachusetts {{residents}} of the time perceived the quake as punishment from God for immoral behavior. In {{the days after the}} earthquake, special prayer services were held and civic authorities declared fast days. A number of sermons and other writings were published as a consequence, including Jeremiah Newland's Verses Occasioned by the Earthquakes in the Month of November, 1755 and Thomas Prince's Earthquakes the Works of God and Tokens of his Just Displeasure. Not all explanations of the event were theological; John Winthrop, a Harvard professor, proposed an alternate explanation having to do with heat and chemical vapors inside <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>earth.</b>|$|E
5|$|Undertale is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} created by American indie developer and composer Toby Fox. In the game, players control a human {{child who has}} fallen into the Underground, a large, secluded region underneath <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth,</b> separated by a magic barrier. The player meets various monsters during a quest {{to return to the}} surface, mainly through the combat system; the player navigates through mini-bullet hell attacks by the opponent, and can opt to pacify or subdue monsters in order to spare them instead of murdering them. These choices affect the game, with the dialogue, characters, and story changing based on outcomes.|$|E

5|$|Even {{though the}} {{boundary}} event was severe, there was significant {{variability in the}} rate of extinction between and within different clades. Species that depended on photosynthesis declined or became extinct as atmospheric particles blocked sunlight and reduced the solar energy reaching <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth.</b> This plant extinction caused a major reshuffling of the dominant plant groups. Omnivores, insectivores, and carrion-eaters survived the extinction event, perhaps because of the increased availability of their food sources. No purely herbivorous or carnivorous mammals seem to have survived. Rather, the surviving mammals and birds fed on insects, worms, and snails, which in turn fed on dead plant and animal matter. Scientists hypothesize that these organisms survived the collapse of plant-based food chains because they fed on detritus (non-living organic material).|$|E
5|$|Geography affects {{solar energy}} {{potential}} because {{areas that are}} closer to the equator have a greater amount of solar radiation. However, the use of photovoltaics that can follow {{the position of the}} sun can significantly increase the solar energy potential in areas that are farther from the equator. Time variation effects the potential of solar energy because during the nighttime there is little solar radiation on <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> for solar panels to absorb. This limits the amount of energy that solar panels can absorb in one day. Cloud cover can affect the potential of solar panels because clouds block incoming light from the sun and reduce the light available for solar cells.|$|E
5|$|Metallic or native iron {{is rarely}} found on <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> because {{it tends to}} oxidize, but its oxides are {{pervasive}} and represent the primary ores. While it makes up about 5% of the Earth's crust, both the Earth's inner and outer core are believed to consist largely of an iron-nickel alloy constituting 35% {{of the mass of}} the Earth as a whole. Iron is consequently the most abundant element on Earth, but only the fourth most abundant element in the Earth's crust, after oxygen, silicon, and aluminium. Most of the iron in the crust is found combined with oxygen as iron oxide minerals such as hematite (Fe2O3), magnetite (Fe3O4), and siderite (FeCO3). Many igneous rocks also contain the sulfide minerals pyrrhotite and pentlandite.|$|E
40|$|A {{method of}} {{applying}} a physical barrier to suppress thermal decomposition near a <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> a thermoelectric material including applying a continuous metal foil to a predetermined portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thermoelectric material, physically binding the continuous metal foil to <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thermoelectric material using a binding member, and heating in a predetermined atmosphere the applied and physically bound continuous metal foil and the thermoelectric material to a sufficient temperature {{in order to}} promote bonding between the continuous metal foil and <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thermoelectric material. The continuous metal foil forms a physical barrier to enclose a predetermined portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface.</b> Thermal decomposition is suppressed at <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thermoelectric material enclosed by the physical barrier when the thermoelectric element is in operation...|$|R
30|$|A third {{strategy}} is to locate the Au NPs on <b>the</b> outer <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> liposomes. The particles are either tethered to <b>the</b> outer <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> liposomes or directly deposited on <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> liposomes <b>surface</b> by lipid vesicle metallization process. On the deposited Au NPs, a gold shell can be further grown.|$|R
40|$|On <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> (5) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> floor {{covering}} micro-craters (6) statistically distributed {{are produced by}} <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> laser impulses, which are invisible to the human eye and have a suction pad effect. In a second process stage, <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thus produced laser-structured {{floor covering}} is subjected to a hydro-mechanical post-treatment. The hydro-mechanical post-treatment is only carried out in <b>the</b> cavities (6) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> floor covering or plates. This treatment is so effected that <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> laser-structured floor covering is at least twice sprayed with fluid, whereby the last spraying process serves to clean and/or neutralise <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> covering or plates of previous spray fluids. ADVANTAGE - Process increases slip-preventing effect...|$|R
5|$|Most bogs {{exist in}} glaciated areas, but Black Moshannon State Park {{is on the}} Allegheny Plateau. This area was not covered by glaciers during the last ice age. The bogs formed here because of the beds of {{sandstone}} that lie flat, a short distance below <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>earth.</b> The sandstone formations in the park do not absorb water very well, so any depression in them will collect water, as has happened here. The bogs extend {{the shores of the}} lake. Migratory shorebirds that visit here include greater and lesser yellowlegs, least sandpiper, solitary sandpiper, and the spotted sandpiper, which has been confirmed as using the IBA as a breeding grounds.|$|E
5|$|Near <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth,</b> its {{magnetic}} field can be closely approximated by {{the field of}} a magnetic dipole positioned {{at the center of}} the Earth and tilted at an angle of about 11° with respect to the rotational axis of the Earth. The dipole is roughly equivalent to a powerful bar magnet, with its south pole pointing towards the geomagnetic North Pole. This may seem surprising, but the north pole of a magnet is so defined because, if allowed to rotate freely, it points roughly northward (in the geographic sense). Since the north pole of a magnet attracts the south poles of other magnets and repels the north poles, it must be attracted to the south pole of Earth's magnet. The dipolar field accounts for 80–90% of the field in most locations.|$|E
5|$|New oceanic crust, {{closest to}} the mid-oceanic ridges, is mostly basalt at shallow levels and has a rugged topography. The {{roughness}} of this topography {{is a function of}} the rate at which the mid-ocean ridge is spreading (the spreading rate). Magnitudes of spreading rates vary quite significantly. Typical values for fast-spreading ridges are greater than 100mm/yr, while slow-spreading ridges are typically less than 20mm/yr. Studies have shown that the slower the spreading rate, the rougher the new oceanic crust will be, and vice versa. It is thought this phenomenon is due to faulting at the mid-ocean ridge when the new oceanic crust was formed. These faults pervading the oceanic crust, along with their bounding abyssal hills, are the most common tectonic and topographic features on <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth.</b> The process of seafloor spreading helps to explain the concept of continental drift in the theory of plate tectonics.|$|E
25|$|Impurities and defects on <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> billet affect <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> extrusion.

In order to get around this the billets may be wire brushed, machined or chemically cleaned before being used.|$|R
30|$|After heat-treated, P 1 {{was more}} smooth, and the layered {{structure}} disappeared. In contrast, <b>the</b> <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original (P 2) cokes were smooth and dense in texture, with a barely porous structure. However, <b>the</b> <b>surfaces</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> heat-treated petroleum cokes were more rough with more fold structure and some porous structure.|$|R

5|$|Similarly, the Sun's December {{solstice}} position (in {{the northern}} hemisphere, {{the lowest point}} on its annual path; in the southern hemisphere, the highest) was in the constellation of Sagittarius, one of two constellations in which the zodiac intersects with the Milky Way. Every year, on the December solstice, the Sun and the Milky Way, appear (from <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth)</b> to come into alignment, and every year precession caused a slight shift in the Sun's position in the Milky Way. Given that the Milky Way is between 10° and 20° wide, it takes between 700 and 1,400 years for the Sun's December solstice position to precess through it. In 2012 it was about halfway through the Milky Way, crossing the galactic equator. In 2012, the Sun's December solstice fell on 21 December.|$|E
5|$|The {{atmospheric}} {{effect of}} surface friction with winds aloft force surface winds to slow and back counterclockwise near <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> blowing inward across isobars (lines of equal pressure), {{when compared to}} the winds in frictionless flow well above the Earth's surface. This layer where friction slows and changes the wind is known as the planetary boundary layer, sometimes the Ekman layer, and it is thickest during the day and thinnest at night. Daytime heating thickens the boundary layer as winds at the surface become increasingly mixed with winds aloft due to insolation, or solar heating. Radiative cooling overnight further enhances wind decoupling between the winds at the surface and the winds above the boundary layer by calming the surface wind which increases wind shear. These wind changes force wind shear between the boundary layer and the wind aloft, and is most emphasized at night.|$|E
5|$|The {{emission}} {{of dust and}} particles could have covered the entire surface of the Earth for several years, possibly a decade, creating a harsh environment for living things. The shock production of carbon dioxide caused by the destruction of carbonate rocks would {{have led to a}} sudden greenhouse effect. Over a longer period, sunlight would have been blocked from reaching <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> by the dust particles in the atmosphere, cooling the surface dramatically. Photosynthesis by plants would also have been interrupted, affecting the entire food chain. A model of the event developed by Lomax et al. (2001) suggests that net primary productivity (NPP) rates may have increased to higher than pre-impact levels over the long term because of the high carbon dioxide concentrations.|$|E
30|$|The highest {{occupied}} {{molecular orbital}} (HOMO) should be located far from <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conduction band <b>of</b> TiO 2 {{and the lowest}} unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) should be placed as close to <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> TiO 2, and subsequently should be higher {{with respect to the}} TiO 2 conduction band potential.|$|R
30|$|Polymer {{adsorption}} {{can simply}} {{be defined as}} the interaction between <b>the</b> solid <b>surface</b> (soft rock) and the polymer molecules. It allows the polymer to be physical adsorbed to <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> solid, hydrogen bond and van der Waal’s forces acting on the molecules and solid <b>surface.</b> <b>The</b> polymer usually adsorbs on <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> solid, and if <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> solid is large, the higher <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> adsorption (Sorbie 1991; Sheng 2011).|$|R
30|$|In case of {{adsorption}} by solids {{from the}} solutions, mostly the solute is adsorbed on <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> solid adsorbent so that <b>the</b> concentration <b>of</b> solute on <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> adsorbent {{is greater than}} in the bulk. This is known as positive adsorption. In some cases, the solvent from the solution may be absorbed by the adsorbent so that <b>the</b> concentration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> solution increases than the initial concentration. This is called negative adsorption. Hence, if <b>the</b> concentration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> adsorbate is less on <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> adsorbent than in the bulk, it is known as negative adsorption.|$|R
