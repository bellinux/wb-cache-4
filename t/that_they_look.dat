5|$|Twenty-five years pass, and Pulikecei is now {{the king}} of Cholapuram Paalayam. As foretold, he is foolish as well as lecherous. He is a puppet {{in the hands of}} Sangilimayan, who collaborates with the British for his own {{personal}} gain, and does not attend {{to the needs of the}} people of his kingdom. Pulikecei also tortures his subjects. He creates an outdoor stadium for different castes to fight against each other and punishes his palace guards even when they make the slightest of mistakes; he also uses his guards as targets for shooting practice. Ukraputhan, now an educated revolutionary, collaborates with his friends to overthrow the British. Ukraputhan falls in love with Vasantha Sundari, who reciprocates his feelings. When Ukraputhan tries to kill Pulikecei, he is shocked to see <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>look</b> alike.|$|E
25|$|In the 'Scouring of the Shire', {{there is}} further {{mention of the}} half-orcs under Sharkey's control, and they are {{described}} as men having squinty (or slanty) eyes and sallow complexion (a description {{used to describe the}} Southerner, Saruman's spy in The Fellowship of the Ring, {{as well as some of}} the orcs in The Two Towers). Which seems to suggest <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>look</b> mostly human but share some of the features of the orcs.|$|E

25|$|The word base of Esperanto was {{originally}} defined by Lingvo internacia, published by L. L. Zamenhof in 1887. It contained some 900 root words. The {{rules of the}} language allow speakers to borrow words as needed, recommending only <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>look</b> for the most international words, and that they borrow one basic word and derive others from it, rather than borrowing many words with related meanings. In 1894, Zamenhof published the first Esperanto dictionary, Universala vortaro, which was written in five languages and supplied a larger set of root words.|$|E

500|$|It has {{received}} positive critical reception, with McManus conducting an eight-page interview and profile of Hughes in {{appreciation of the}} series. The magazine had previously published a special issue centered on the network and its shows in July 2012, but overlooked Off the Air, presenting an [...] "opportunity to shed a little insight and background on an extraordinary unique show." [...] Speaking {{from the first time}} he watched it, McManus praised it for not being [...] "your typical try-too-hard-to-be-weird production." [...] In Adweek, Sam Thielman ranked it second place out of 18 other programs on the network. He tied it with the network's parody infomercial specials and wrote that it was [...] "in the same category as King Star King among things that are so cool and strange <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>look</b> like they should probably be part of a video installation in an art gallery somewhere." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{earthquake}} made Yamaguchi rethink {{his reasons}} why Sakanaction make music. The {{meaning of a}} documentary-themed album changed after the earthquake, as the band {{felt as if they}} did not have a heavy album that reflected these events, then it could not truly be a documentary. Yamaguchi wrote the songs [...] "Bach no Senritsu o Yoru ni Kiita Sei Desu" [...] and [...] "Years" [...] directly after the earthquake, as therapy for himself. Realizing that rock bands were no longer a staple of Japanese charts in the early 2010s, Yamaguchi wanted to create a Sakanaction-style pop song that would resonate with a general pop audience, one that listened to idol groups such as Girls' Generation, TVXQ and AKB48. As rock music was no longer so prominent in Japan, Yamaguchi felt that the reasons for people listening to music had changed over time, and wanted to mix rock music with entertainment-focused music in order to give people music <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>look</b> for.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} the first time that the {{characters}} of Nina Sharp and David Robert Jones had common scenes within the show, but both Blair Brown and Jared Harris had previously acted together as mother and son in an off-Broadway production of the play Humble Boy. During the scene in which Nina was tortured to taunt Olivia into using her powers, Brown actually injured herself on the rusty bedsprings used as the prop for the show. Brown referred to the alternative version of her character as [...] "Meana" [...] due to her seemingly [...] "mean" [...] personality, and speculated that Nina may have become this way because without William Bell, [...] "she wasn’t at the party with all of the boys, the science boys" [...] and thus developed an [...] "outsider" [...] perspective. She said of the role, [...] "It’s a really interesting thing to play. I love the fact <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>look</b> exactly the same, at least for a while." ...|$|E

Sota gives the painting to Soya's father, who agrees to pass the painting to Sayo. Sota continues walking in the snow. Just as he [...] settles down to rest, he discovers that Mr. Arima's warehouse is on fire. Sota helps to put out the fire and calls for help. He leaves before Soya's father arrives, and Mr. Arima launches a manhunt to find Sota to thank him. When this hunt is unsuccessful, Sayo suggests <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>look</b> for him at the pond. They find him there, dead. In the present day again, the old man leaves and Sayo starts playing the [...] "Clair de lune" [...] on the piano.|$|E
500|$|The New York Times Neil Genzlinger {{said that}} the funny script and skilled editing {{potentially}} made it the [...] "Animal House of the iPhone generation". Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly praised the film for updating the clichés of similarly themed films from the 1970s to the 1980s like Animal House and Risky Business [...] "so <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>look</b> just dangerous enough to make nostalgia feel naughty", but stated that the film does not offer anything more outrageous than real parties, despite implying [...] "that it's breaking down bold new barriers of misbehavior". Gleiberman accused negative reviews of [...] "fulfilling the role of all those uptight parents in '50s news reports {{about the dangers of}} rock & roll", by applying moral judgments to the events of the film. Time Out Joshua Rothkopf gave the film four stars out of five, calling it [...] "brainless", but feeling that the sheer anarchy of the film's events were [...] "thrilling". Pete Travers of Rolling Stone praised the film as [...] "gut-bustingly funny" [...] that appealed to a base youth element to become [...] "shitfaced and run amok", and said that it puts its own spin on Animal House. Travers gave particular mention to Mann as [...] "excellent"; however, he also stated that Nourizadeh's filmmaking was a [...] "disaster".|$|E
500|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Guepinia helvelloides grow singly {{or in small}} clumps. Although they can appear to be growing in the soil, their {{mycelium}} lives in buried wood. They are [...] tall and [...] wide, spoon- or tongue-shaped, and twisted like a cornet or horn so <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>look</b> like a slender funnel, cut out {{on one side and}} often with a wavy margin. The fruit bodies are flexible, [...] thick, and smooth on the outer side which they are usually attenuated on the underside into a cylindrical or depressed stem that is up to [...] high and about [...] thick. The stem is normally covered with a white [...] at the base. The upper side (inside) of the fruit body is usually quite sterile or with a few isolated basidia and is slightly [...] {{as a result of the}} densely crowded protruding ends of the hyphae. The sterile and fertile surfaces of the fruit body are almost the same color, transparent reddish-orange to flesh pink or flesh orange, at other times more purplish-red. The fruit bodies usually develop a slightly brownish tinge when they are old. The underside is usually slightly more vividly colored than the upper side. The flesh is gelatinous, softly so in the upper part of the fruit body and with a more cartilage-like consistency in the stem. It has a nondescript odor, and a watery, insignificant taste.|$|E

500|$|Kyra Kyles {{from the}} Chicago Tribune {{described}} the Flavas dolls {{as out of}} touch and questionable role models for children, calling them [...] "unimaginative stereotypes" [...] and saying {{that one of the}} dolls looks like a [...] "drug-dealing pimp." [...] Toy industry analyst Sean McGowan said <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>look</b> like [...] "hip-hop as designed by committee." [...] Raquel Wilson, editor in chief of hip-hop e-zine Verbalisms said: [...] "They completely misrepresent the culture." [...] Dr John Richer, a clinical child psychologist in Oxford, England said: [...] "This has the same sort of flavour as beauty contests in America where little kids get dolled up as teenagers." [...] Miriam , {{the editor in chief of}} Child described the dolls' multiculturalism as positive: [...] "a very nice way of helping children all over the country realize that people look many different ways." [...] Several British toy industry analysts expected the Flavas dolls to sell well, one of them saying that [...] "the risqué nature of these dolls would guarantee their success." [...] But they sold poorly—Wall Street Journal described their results as [...] "disastrous". According to AP some analysts believed Flavas were just [...] "too edgy." [...] Businessweek said that the [...] "clunky jewelry and graffiti on the packaging ... scared away mothers and left kids cold." [...] They ended up being taken off the market after less than a year. Several Mattel executives were let go following the discontinuation. Moe Tkacik of Slate described Flavas as [...] "ridiculous, but in a cute way" [...] and questioned if their hasty withdrawal had been premature, suggesting they could have found a niche market.|$|E
500|$|On {{the balance}} between {{creating}} new material and drawing from existing mythology, Bell noted that telling stories that can entertain both Marvel fans and non-Marvel fans is challenging, and that for the series they try to add nods to the MCU films or the comics {{in a way that}} works well on its own for all viewers, but could also mean more for a fan. On where the series can draw from the comics, Jed Whedon explained that there are areas of the comics that the series is not allowed to go to, and that ultimately they only use the comics for inspiration in generating their own story. Tancharoen elaborated that, [...] "We're always going to be inspired and influenced by the comics, but of course on the show, we'll always be doing our spin to it." [...] About comparisons between the scope of the series and that of the films, Bell said that ABC and Marvel had been very generous with the series' budget, and that the production could not complain for a network series, but that it was nothing compared to the films or even series like Game of Thrones. He explained that the series does attempt to create [...] "Marvel moments" [...] as best it can, but pointed out that some of the more memorable moments from the films are smaller, character moments—something that works really well on television—so the series strives for those when it cannot afford more scope and scale. Jed Whedon elaborated <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>look</b> at a sequence and try to keep only what is required to tell the story, so [...] "If a monster is landing on a car, instead of showing the whole monster leaping through the skyline, we {{want to be in the}} car with the character having that experience." ...|$|E
2500|$|Uncharted 2 also {{received}} praise from other developers. [...] producer Gordon Van Dyke stated [...] "Uncharted 2 is an amazing-looking game. But we're reaching {{that level of}} quality.

2500|$|In September 2011, Sakanaction {{released}} {{their fifth}} studio album Documentaly, which had reached number {{two on the}} Japanese Oricon albums chart; the highest position achieved by the band in their career at the time. The album was strongly affected {{by the events of}} the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami which had occurred in March of that year, during the promotional period for their single [...] "Rookie". The band's vocalist and songwriter Ichiro Yamaguchi felt a new resolution to create music that would resonate with a general pop music audience, who listened to idol acts such as Girls' Generation and AKB48. As rock music was no longer a popular staple during the early 2010s in Japan, Yamaguchi felt that the reasons people listened to music had changed over time, and wanted to mix rock music with entertainment-focused music in order to give these people the type of music <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>look</b> for.|$|E
2500|$|An {{anonymous}} source—later {{identified as}} Glenn Moser of Norfolk, Virginia—sent {{a letter to}} the Fredericksburg authorities, suggesting <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>look</b> into Rees. Moser explained that he and Rees often engaged in heady philosophical conversations, one of which had been about whether murder could be considered acceptable. Rees, under the influence of benzedrine, confided to Moser that he considered murder to just be another part of the [...] "human experience" [...] that he eagerly wanted to take part in. [...] "You can't say it's wrong to kill," [...] Rees reportedly told Moser. [...] "Only individual standards make it right or wrong." [...] The discussion took place the day before the Jacksons disappeared; upon hearing of their murders months later, Moser suspected Rees of killing the family. Moser confronted Rees about the murders; while Rees did not confess to the killings, he also didn't deny responsibility and became evasive. In his anonymous letter, Moser also voiced his suspicion of Rees in Margaret Harold's murder in 1957, as the two men were working in the Annapolis area as salesmen at the time.|$|E
2500|$|Reviews of the {{graphics}} were also mixed. AllGame's J.C. Barnes was critical, writing, [...] "pop in is extremely widespread in dungeons and towns. Also dungeon textures are bland and repetitive." [...] Game Revolution's Johnny Liu wrote [...] "Graphically, Dark Cloud is colorful if a bit bland. It simply {{looks like a}} first generation game." [...] On the other hand, Game Informers Andrew Reiner wrote [...] "All of the models, effects, and textures are sumptuous." [...] IGN's Dave Zydrko was more ambivalent; [...] "Dark Cloud isn't a bad-looking game by any means. The character models actually look really good, completely with jag-free edges, lots of texture detail and really cool designs [...] What hurts Dark Cloud is its background graphics. There's a lot of flickering in the backgrounds, plus clipping problems can be found, there are some instances where you'll see seams in the textures, and the background textures are poorly designed in <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>look</b> like floor and wall tiles in the outside environments." [...] GameSpot's Shane Satterfield had similarly mixed views; [...] "Dark Clouds graphics can be both stunning and disappointing. All six characters look great, and it's obvious that {{a great deal of}} time was taken in crafting their personalities through animation [...] Graphical tricks like real-time shadows, depth blur, and particle effects are prevalent in most settings." [...] However, he also felt, [...] "By the third stage of each dungeon, things become undeniably monotonous due to constantly reused textures and objects. Other graphical problems include flickering textures and a camera that regularly gets stuck behind objects while your character is locked on to an enemy." ...|$|E
