His intervention was decisive to thwart the Mutiny of Álzaga and allow Viceroy Santiago de Liniers to stay in power. Although he supported the establishment of a government Junta, as others created in Spain during the contemporary Peninsular War, he desired that criollos had an important role in it (the mutiny of Álzaga was promoted by peninsulars). He advised against rushed actions as well, and as his Regiment was crucial in any action against the viceroy, he denied his help until it was a good strategic moment to do so. The opportunity came in May, 1810, and the May Revolution successfully ousted the viceroy.|$|E

The NO donors S-nitrosocysteine, S-nitrosoglutathione, SIN- 1 and hydroxylamine induced sustained concentration-dependent <b>relaxations.</b> <b>The</b> NO synthase blocker L-nitro arginine (L-NOARG; 300 [*]μM) abolished <b>the</b> <b>relaxations</b> to EFS without affecting <b>the</b> <b>relaxations</b> to NO. <b>The</b> copper(I) chelator neocuproine (10 [*]μM) enhanced <b>the</b> <b>relaxations</b> to EFS and NO but inhibited those to S-nitrosocysteine and S-nitrosoglutathione.

The potentiating effect of neocuproine on <b>the</b> <b>relaxations</b> to EFS was more pronounced after inhibition of catalase with 3 -amino- 1, 2, 4 -triazole (1 [*]mM) but not after inhibition of Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD) with diethyl dithiocarbamic acid (DETCA, 1 [*]mM). The potentiating effect of neocuproine on relaxations to NO was not altered by 3 -amino- 1, 2, 4 -triazole or DETCA treatment. <b>The</b> <b>relaxations</b> to EFS were significantly inhibited by the oxidants hydrogen peroxide (70 [*]μM) and duroquinone (10 [*]μM) but only after inhibition of catalase with 3 -amino- 1, 2, 4 -triazole or after inhibition of Cu/ZnSOD with DETCA respectively. Our results suggest that neocuproine can act as an antioxidant in the mouse gastric fundus and that both catalase and Cu/ZnSOD protect the nitrergic neurotransmitter from oxidative breakdown. Since inhibition of catalase but not inhibition of Cu/ZnSOD potentiated the effect of neocuproine on relaxations to EFS without affecting <b>the</b> <b>relaxations</b> to NO, catalase may protect the nitrergic neurotransmitter mainly at a prejunctional site whereas Cu/ZnSOD protects at a postjunctional site...|$|R

It is anticipated that like gravitational N‐body systems, the point vortex system rapidly relaxes to a state near the thermal equilibrium state by <b>the</b> violent <b>relaxation</b> and after that the system evolves toward the genuine thermal equilibrium state driven by a collisional slow process (<b>the</b> slow <b>relaxation).</b> <b>The</b> time scale of <b>the</b> slow <b>relaxation</b> {{is proportional to the}} number of the point vortices.
