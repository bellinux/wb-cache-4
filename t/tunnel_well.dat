There must be a space {{underneath}} it a hundred feet long, sloping from nothing down to twelve feet. There is room for a dozen chambers such as those we saw {{on each side of the}} <b>tunnel.</b> <b>Well</b> done, Bertie! you have given me fresh hope. It would be a splendid hiding-place, for any searchers who came down and saw the water in the cistern would believe at once that, as neither the Chimoos nor the Incas could have known how to build under water, there was no use in searching for hidden chambers under this floor. You see, neither of them had any knowledge of cement or mortar. All their bricks and stones are laid without anything of the sort; and whatever amount of labour was available no chamber could be made under water, for as fast as holes were dug the water would come in, and even if they could line it with stone-work the water would penetrate through the cracks. Now, Dias, that we see with certainty where we have to dig, we can make our preparations. I will write down a list of the things we decided the other day we should want:--Six kegs of powder, two hundred feet of fuse, four boring-tools, six steel wedges, the smallest smith's fire you can buy--for we shall have to sharpen the tools,--six borers, a large bundle of torches, four sledge-hammers--we have enough pickaxes and shovels,--and another fifty fathoms, that is a hundred yards, of rope. I don't know anything else that we shall want in the mining way.|$|E

[...] However the Mahogany Creek Deviation was the incorrect name for the new line that followed {{the line of the}} Jane Brook to Mount Helena [...] It was on the second route of the Eastern Railway constructed of the Eastern Railway (Western Australia) 1880s to early 1890s, and it passed through the Swan View <b>Tunnel,</b> <b>well</b> {{to the north of the}} original Mahogany Creek stopping place and the creek itself.|$|E
5000|$|Suranga (also Surangam or thurangam) (English: <b>Tunnel</b> <b>well)</b> is a {{traditional}} water management system used to provide a reliable supply of water for human settlements and irrigation in Kasargod district of Kerala and Dakshin Kannada district of Karnataka, India. [...] A suranga is basically a horizontal tunnel dug in the slope of a laterite hill for about 30 m to 40 m, which uses gravitational force for extraction of the underground water and collect into a storage tank. As both the areas are covered by uneven and steep laterite hill which makes boring of traditional bore well hard and expensive, surangas are considered as a relatively cheap option.|$|E

40|$|For {{the fast}} pulsed magnet system of CERN's SPS and LEP {{particle}} accelerators, a special type of moulded coaxial {{high voltage cable}} connector is used in large quantities. These connectors are mounted on coaxial transmission lines, which connect pulse generators in buildings at ground level to the fast pulsed magnets situated in an underground <b>tunnel.</b> <b>Well</b> over 1500 such connectors have already been installed and many more will be needed {{for the construction of}} the LHC. This 14 TeV Large Hadron Collider, which has a circumference of 27 km, is now under construction at CERN. The paper summarizes the operational experience over the last 20 years and the design principles of the connector. It explains how the excellent reliability and the extremely low failure rate were achieved and outlines the causes of the rare replacements. The paper also discusses the ageing effects caused by radiation, as well as wear and tear during installation and manipulation.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} sources and style of migration of spring water discharging from fracture zones in a large-scale tunnel occurring at 150 to 200 meters below the surface of the ground. The water samples collected were spring water 200 meters below the surface and subsurface water 100 meters below the surface in the <b>tunnel,</b> <b>well</b> water, river water and precipitations. The properties of the water samples are discussed on the basis of concentrations of the major chemical components, including Na+, K+, -Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, Cl-, NO 3, SO 42 -and HCO 3 - and the oxygen and hydrogen isotopic ratios of those water. The oxygen and hydrogen isotopic ratios of the spring water in the tunnel have almost constant values of [...] 18 O= - 11. 0 ‰ and [...] D= [...] - 70 ‰, respectively, and the isotopic ratios are lower than those of subsurface water, well water, river water and precipitations. On the other hand, the oxygen and hydrogen isotopic ratios of subsurface water show weak seasonal variation. The residence time of the spring water in the tunnel is estimated to be about over 2 years. Based on the results of concentration ratio for major chemical components of water in the area, river water and well water having a short residence time and spring water having a long residence time. The subsurface water is thought to have been formed by water/rock interaction between water of meteoric origin with Quaternary and Tertiary volcanics in a short time, while the spring water is thought to be water formed by reaction of subsurface water with Paleozoic [...] Mesozoic to Quaternary strata over a long period...|$|E
