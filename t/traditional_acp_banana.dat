40|$|The European Union (EU) is {{currently}} the main market outlet for imported bananas, with an estimated annual turnover of ECU 2 billion ($ 1. 8 billion) in 1996 (excluding trade between EU members). By 1999, European demand for bananas (excluding EU production) is projected to reach about 3. 3 million tonnes annually. Who are the leading suppliers of bananas to the European Union? In addition to EU producers, suppliers include ACP signatories to the Lomé Convention and some Central and Latin American banana-producing countries. The Common Market Organisation for Bananas, set up in 1993 and extended by the Framework Agreement endorsed in Marrakech (1994), led to allocation of import quotas based on three different banana origins, with a provision for compensation {{to make up for}} any loss of income subsequent to market consolidation. A tariff quota of 2. 2 million tonnes was established for dollar bananas from third country origins, at a tariff of ECU 75 a tonne. In September 1996, USA, supported by Guatemala, Ecuador, Honduras and Mexico, contested the terms of the Marrakech trading agreement and lodged a complaint for violation of trade laws. What is actually at issue? Is the percentages of the third-country tariff quota allocated to four Latin American signatories to the Framework Agreement. It is the quotas designated for non-traditional <b>ACP</b> <b>bananas</b> (80, 000 t) that are being contested. The percentages of the tariff quota allocated to Venezuela and Nicaragua are being disputed, i. e. WTO contends that these two countries do not have a sufficient vested interest in the banana industry. Rejection of the terms of the Marrakech agreements, along with the modified status and increased demands of American multinational corporations (Chiquita, Dole, Del Monte), could create a new order with respect to the import subsector. Many small-scale banana importers or ripeners will be affected by the economic and political implications of the future Common Market Organisation for Bananas. Banana origins Community bananas. These are produced by EU countries: Martinique and Guadeloupe (France); Madeira (Portugal); Canary Islands (Spain); Crete and Lakonia (Greece). 854, 000 tonnes is the maximum quantity of Community bananas that can be marketed to qualify for loss-of-income compensation. <b>ACP</b> <b>bananas.</b> These are produced by African, Pacific and Caribbean countries signatory to the Lomé IV Convention along with the EU. This category includes: <b>traditional</b> <b>ACP</b> <b>bananas.</b> These are exported to the EU by <b>traditional</b> <b>ACP</b> supply countries (Belize, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Côte d'Ivoire, Dominica, Grenada, Jamaica, Madagascar, St Lucia, St Vincent/Grenadines, Somalia and Suriname).

40|$|Banana prices {{within the}} European Union are almost double world levels. These prices are {{maintained}} by restrictive import quotas and tariffs that generate rents that accrue to distributors and producers. The European Union {{is obliged to}} remove its quantitative restrictions {{and replace them with}} a tariff. It is likely to choose a preferential tariff that favours exports from ACP countries, but any one tariff would benefit the lower cost ACP producers at the expense of others. The EU’s problem is one of addressing multiple objectives with a single instrument. Quantitative analysis using a bilateral trade model suggests that if the European Union were to remove its import quotas but leave intact the € 75 /t preferential tariff on non-ACP exports, <b>traditional</b> <b>ACP</b> countries would see their global exports just maintained while the Ivory Coast, Cameroon and, to a lesser extent, non-ACP countries, would enjoy significant increases.

Liberalization of banana imports would create huge welfare gains which can easily be used to compensate potential losers. It is proposed that the compensation package is given {{the form of an}} International Banana Agreement. The presence of third-party gains from trade liberalization can be used to negotiate non-EU involvement in the international agreement.

On this basis, we analyse the impacts of different MFN tariff levels on EU banana imports under contrasting hypotheses regarding, first whether the price gap between CIF and FOB unit values does include at least part of quota rents, second whether banana exports to the EU from Western African ACP countries were constrained under the previous regime where a specific import quota were reserved to ACP countries.

40|$|Recent {{studies on}} the impact of the Commission mid-term review {{proposals}} point to the imminence of major changes for the EU rice market. The executive summary of the FAPRI study highlights: a large reduction in rice prices in the EU (- 35. 1 % by 2004 and - 41. 4 % by 2009); a consequent reduction in rice intervention stocks; a reduction in the increase in likely imports of rice to only slightly above current levels. A safety-net price in the EU of € 120 per tonne is envisaged. The sharp reduction in the intervention price support that this entails will allow a dramatic reduction in the EU market price for rice. EU farmers will however be insulated from the income consequences of this sharp decline in the market price by an income payment of € 102 per tonne and a crop specific payment of € 75 per tonne. Despite the sharp decline in the EU rice price the FAPRI study predicts that following the implementation of the mid-term review proposals, rice production will rise by 20 % over current levels of production (2002). Production under the implementation of the mid-term review proposals would be slightly lower (1. 2 %) than would be the case in the absence of reform of the rice sector, but overall this simply means that rice sector reform will marginally slow down the rate of expansion of EU rice production. The reforms will, however, substantially reduce the attractiveness of the EU market to developing country rice exports, and imports are projected to decline considerably. Comment: These marginal effects of dramatic reform on EU rice farmers contrasts sharply with the likely effects felt in Guyana, the rice industry of which is likely to take a further battering, as declining EU rice prices are reflected in lower foreign exchange earnings. Against this background Guyana's and Surinam's rice farmers may need to look to joining Southern African beef farmers in calling for the introduction of 'compensatory trade measures' to compensate <b>traditional</b> <b>ACP</b> suppliers for the income depressing effects of CAP reform. Within this concept it is argued that just as EU farmers are compensated for price reductions by increased levels of direct aid payments, so <b>traditional</b> <b>ACP</b> suppliers of these products should be compensated for price reductions through an enhancement of the trade preferences extended to them (so called 'compensatory trade measures'). In the rice sector this could involve: the elimination of the remaining 35 % special duty on direct exports to the EU; the lifting of all quantitative restrictions; a review of administrative arrangements to facilitate exports and reduce transaction costs. It could also involve the fast tracking of assistance to rice sector restructuring (an area where according to recent ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly resolutions there is considerable scope for improvement), including the identification and promotion of speciality varieties, the price trends for which are not so dependent upon the level of the EU intervention price.

40|$|As {{a prelude}} to the tabling of formal {{proposals}} for reform of the EU sugar regime the European Commission on September 23 rd set out three possible scenarios for reform, {{based on the information}} provided in the 'Extended Impact Assessment: Sugar Sector' carried out internally by the Commission services: Option 1 is 'extension of the current regime' beyond 2006. Any reductions in quotas prices and tariffs would be made within the current framework for the common organisation of the market. Option 2 is a 'price-reduction scenario'. This would involve the phasing-out of production quotas, with the EU price being allowed to adjust itself to the price of non-preferential imports. This scenario looks at the impact of such measures on trade patterns and includes the possibility of allowing sugar producers to benefit from the new system of decoupled farm payments. Option 3 is the 'complete liberalisation' option. In this scenario producers would be integrated into the single farm payment system while there would be a complete removal of import tariffs and quantitative restrictions on imports. In the extended impact assessment the implications of the various options are assessed' including their impact on third countries. As of September 30 th 2003, the document was only available in French and German. Comment: These three options resemble three of the four options outlined in the UK Sugar Traders' website in March 2003 based on an internal Commission note (they were then referred to as the 'status quo option', the 'fall in price option', and the 'liberalisation option'). At this time the assessment was that under both the 'fall in price option' (now called the 'price reduction scenario') and the liberalisation option, <b>traditional</b> <b>ACP</b> suppliers would suffer considerable income losses, with the liberalisation option posing the greatest threat, with Brazil becoming virtually a monopoly supplier of cane sugar.

40|$|EU trade {{preferences}} {{have long}} been crucial to ACP countries operating {{on the margins of}} the world economy. But recent changes in trading rules now threaten the banana and sugar industries, and the small-scale producers who rely on them. Can they find new openings to fill the gap? The writing has been on the wall for some time now, but that does not make it any easier to accept. The erosion of ACP preferential margins for the EU s sugar and banana markets is now a certainty, and with it will come tougher times for many producers. Sugar and banana farmers in the Caribbean and Pacific are expected to be the hardest hit, their problems compounded by the small size of their markets and the vulnerability of their export sectors. Diversification offers the best hope for ACP farmers affected by the changes. But finding new products and new markets is no easy task, and time is not on their side. Under agreements dating back more than 40 years, Sugar and Banana Protocols guaranteed protected export markets to the EU for these two key ACP commodities. Now, under pressure from competitors, those preferences are being drastically cut back. In November 2005, the EU announced that it would slash by 36 % over 4 years the price it pays for sugar from ACP regions. Meanwhile, at the 6 th World Trade Organization (WTO) Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong in December 2005, the EU confirmed its decision to apply a new import tariff on bananas from January 2006. This tariff of 176 /t for Latin America is considered by ACP exporters to be too low to safeguard their own trade position on the EU market. It is the latest round in a 5 -year dispute which began when Latin American producers complained that the EU's banana regime was unfair. But will this new tariff regime maintain the benefits of <b>ACP</b> <b>banana</b> producers? Trade preference mechanisms have proved the mainstay of many <b>ACP</b> sugar and <b>banana</b> producing countries over the past 4 decades, creating a dependence which will be painful to sever. For Barbados, Belize, Fiji, Guyana and Swaziland the current income transfer from the Sugar Protocol is equivalent to over US$ 50 (42) per capita. For Mauritius, the figure is US$ 150 (126). In a number of <b>ACP</b> countries, family-run <b>banana</b> farms have traditionally been the backbone of the economy. Who stands to lose According to the Overseas Development Institute (ODI), the heaviest losses will be to Dominica and St. Vincent for bananas, Guyana for sugar, and Belize for both bananas and sugar. But the repercussions will be felt far and wide. Sugar generates 24 % of the GDP in Swaziland. In Fiji, 42 % of the value of agriculture and 30 % of processing comes from sugarcane production. The ACP Sugar Group has estimated that price cuts will lead to annual losses of 400 million, as well as massive unemployment, rural instability and urban migration. One estimate predicts that banana sector employment in the four banana-producing countries of the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) will fall by 84 %. Sensing that change was inevitable, some ACP countries have already begun to distance themselves from their time-honoured crops. St. Kitts shut its state-owned sugar industry in July 2005 and the sugar railway now carries tourists. Trinidad closed its state-owned sugar company in 2003. But a gulf divides the two groups of ACP countries affected by the new trade rules those, like Mauritius, which have a stable and sound development base, and others, like Dominica, who put all their hopes in a single commodity. The European Commission has pledged an aid package worth 40 million for 2006, and its draft Action Plan of June 2005 indicated that an annual 100 million may be available to support restructuring and diversification up until 2013. Breaking the dependence upon traditional primary commodities is not easy. But with the right help and support, it can be done, as some ACP producers are already proving with new high value products such as ginger, garlic and chilli peppers, added value items such as sauces and chutneys, and organic and fair trade products. Also of interest is the small but growing niche market for exotic tropical fruits, such as passion fruit, lychees and durian. Sugaring the pill Sugar-related products also offer potential for ACP producers planning to continue sugar production. A study commissioned by the Dutch government on bio-ethanol made from sugar cane found that this could prove an export option for producers hit by falling prices. Other studies noted that co-generation of electricity from bagasse is a viable prospect for Guyana and Swaziland. In addition to a well-established sugarcane by-product sector, Mauritius already has a co-generation sector with 10 power plants producing more than 40 % of the island s energy. Said Hans van Klink at the Dutch Sustainable Development Group, When you look to the sugar chain there is much more to optimise than just sugar: you can use material for energy production and extract other useful products, creating added value. Many small-scale Caribbean banana producers have already left the export market. In Jamaica, farmers are producing fruit for the tourist market and for banana chips. In St. Lucia, an Agricultural Diversification Programme is expanding the non-traditional crop sector, with good growth seen in mango, hot pepper and avocado production. Many producers are moving into supplying fresh vegetables and flowers for hotels and cruise ships. Mauritius enjoys healthier prospects than most as it has used sugar revenues to fund diversification into textiles, tourism and finance. It is helped by a well-developed infrastructure and a dynamic private sector. Diversification into non-sugar agricultural sectors has been less successful, with constraints including limited fertile land resources and planting material, though biotechnology is helping to counter this handicap. In Kenya, farmers helped by the Community Rehabilitation and Environmental Programme (CREP) are finding it more profitable to abandon sugarcane production and grow food. Fiji has moved into the production of flowers and exotic fruits and farmers are exporting traditional food crops to the Indo-Fijian communities in Australia and New Zealand. Products targeted for diversification include breadfruit, jack fruit, okra, indigenous nuts, industrial hemp and stevia. In Papua New Guinea, Ramu Sugar Ltd is successfully diversifying into beef cattle, oil palm and peanuts. The use of technology can also provide a competitive edge. Erica s Country-Style in St. Vincent uses the internet to sell pepper sauces and food snacks to US markets. Innovative technologies for in vitro micropropagation of ginger are helping Jamaican producers develop a range of products including essential oils, pesticidal and medicinal preparations. Forest product exports offer some potential, especially for Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. To what extent these new products can help maintain the broader economic and social benefits traditionally derived from the sugar sector remains to be seen. Agriculture and beyond There is also scope for diversification outside agriculture. A World Bank report on the Caribbean suggests new product areas such as adventure tourism and the creation of upscale resorts. Other potential growth sectors include health services, information and communication technology and offshore education. Producers will need technical support as well as funding if they are to make the transition. In many ACP countries, domestic markets are small, but servicing the larger regional markets involves improved methods of preservation and packaging. Regional organisations could do much to help by promoting diversification where there are economies of scale, through regional research programmes and marketing organisations. There is no time to be lost. Diversification must begin before a shift in prices occurs, urges the Commonwealth Secretariat, which has put forward proposals for a Special Fund for Diversification. Easier said than done. Noting the notorious delays involved in accessing EU funds, the European Research Office observes that ACP negotiators would do well to push for the early, timely and effective delivery of assistance to national restructuring and/or diversification programmes.

40|$|In {{the words}} of the European Commission, the June 26 th 2003 {{agreement}} on CAP reform will mean that 'in future, the vast majority of subsidies will be paid independently from the volume of production'. However 'member states may choose to maintain a limited link between subsidy and production under well-defined conditions and within clear limits'. The single farm payment system will enter into force in 2005. However, member states may get a special dispensation to apply it only from 2007. The key elements of the reform package as agreed are:  a single farm payment for EU farmers, independent from production; limited coupled elements may be maintained to avoid abandonment of production; this payment will be linked to respect for environmental, food-safety, animal and plant health and animal-welfare standards, as well as the requirement to keep all farmland in good agricultural and environmental condition ('cross compliance'); a strengthened rural-development policy with more EU money, new measures to promote the quality of the environment and animal welfare, and to help farmers to meet EU production standards starting in 2005; a reduction in direct payments ('modulation') for bigger farms to finance the new rural development policy; a mechanism for financial discipline to ensure that the farm budget fixed until 2013 is not overshot; revisions to the market policy of the CAP involving: asymmetric price cuts in the milk sector; reduction of the monthly increments in the cereals sector by half, (the current intervention price will be maintained);  reforms in the rice, durum wheat, nuts, starch potatoes and dried fodder sectors. The Commission press release provides a detailed summary of how the various reforms will be implemented. This includes an outline of the modifications made to the Commission's original proposals with regard to the single farm payment scheme, where member states can be allowed to maintain up to 25 % of current hectare payments in the arable sector linked to production if this maintains land in production. Alternatively 40 % of the supplementary durum wheat premium may continue to be linked to production. Unlike the Commission's initial proposal there will be no reduction in cereals intervention prices, although the existing seasonal correction payments will be reduced by 50 %. A supplement for durum wheat in traditional durum wheat farming areas will be paid independently of production for which member states may decide to retain 40 % linked to production. A quality premium for durum wheat used in pasta and semolina production to farmers in traditional zones will also be paid. A one-step reduction in the price of rice of 50 % was agreed. This will bring the EU price (€ 150 /tonne) into line with the world market price. Current direct aid payments will be increased from € 25 /tonne to € 177 /tonne. Of this € 102 /tonne {{will be part of the}} single farm aid payment, based on historical rights, while the remainder (€ 75 /tonne) will be paid as a crop-specific aid. Intervention buying will be triggered should market prices fall to € 150 per tonne, with a ceiling of 75, 000 tonnes being set for intervention buying. New tariff items are to be created to accommodate the new rice regime. With regard to the beef sector, member states may decide to retain up to a 100 % of the suckler cow premium and over 40 % of the slaughter premium as a production-linked payment, or 100 % of the slaughter premium or 75 % of the special male premium. In addition for sheep and goats, a maximum of 50 % of the premium can remain linked to production, while drying aid for cereals in the outermost regions of the EU may remain linked to production. The dairy sector will only be incorporated into the single farm payment from 2008 when the process of reform has been fully implemented. The reformed dairy quota regime will remain in place until 2014 / 15. The intervention prices for butter will decrease by 25 % over four years which is an additional price cut of 10 % compared to those agreed in 2000. There will be a reduction in skimmed milk powder prices of 15 % over three years in line with the Agenda 2000 agreement. Intervention buying for butter will be suspended above a limit of 70, 000 tonnes in 2004, with this declining to 30, 000 tonnes by 2007. Compensation payments will rise from € 11. 81 per tonne in 2004 to € 23. 65 in 2005 and € 35. 5 per tonne in 2006. In addition member states may make additional payments equivalent to 10 % of the sum of the single farm aid payment to encourage specific types of farming. With regard to funds generated by 'modulation' (that is the progressive reduction of payments to larger farms) 1 % will remain in the member states where the money is raised. The remainder will be allocated to member states according to: agricultural area; agricultural employment; GDP per capita, purchasing power. This being said every member state will receive at least 80 % of the funds generated from modulation in its territory. Proposals for reform of the olive oil, tobacco and cotton regimes will be tabled in autumn 2003. Comment: The prior implementation of reform in the dairy sector, involving substantial price reductions, in advance of incorporation into the single farm payment scheme, gives an indication of the likely trajectory for reform in the sugar sector, a sector of vital importance to a number of ACP economies. The impact this will have on the value of ACP sugar preferences (quite independent of the outcome of the Brazilian and Australian WTO challenge to the EU's 'C' export arrangements) will need to be taken into account in the on-going EPA negotiations; possibly through the negotiation of 'compensatory trade measures' explicitly linked to the erosion of the value of trade preferences as a result of the implementation of CAP reform. In the rice sector the compromise reform includes a specific reference to traditional rice suppliers stating 'the Commission will also take into account the interests of developing countries, including those traditional suppliers, as well as the implementation of the EBA regulation', it remains to be seen what this will mean in practice for <b>traditional</b> <b>ACP</b> suppliers such as Surinam and Guyana. The major change with regard to modulation which keeps the vast majority of these funds for deployment in support of rural development means that there will be little scope created for the financing of further reform. This could serve to defer substantive reform of the EU sugar regime. In {{the words of}} the European Commission, the June 26 th 2003 agreement on CAP [...] ...|$|R

He established the Dutch foundation EcoFair in 1994 to help producers in the South trade with the North. Using his in-depth experience as a human interface between the North and South, he {{now works as a}} consultant with international bodies such as the World Bank. 'Fair trade' {{is much more than a}} slogan. It is a real commercial practice, based on fairness and nonexploitation in trading relationships and on environment-friendly production of goods. Fair trade organisations (FTOs) form a well-established movement in Europe, North America, Japan, and elsewhere in the industrialised world. They have even succeeded in shifting products from the distribution channel of charity shops and health food centres into the big business of supermarkets. Fair trade is an ideal that inspires and educates. But we have a long way to go before fair products and fair trade can be of any significance to many ACP farmers. On the face of it, fair trade is about partnership between like-minded people (see Spore 67). Agricultural producers in the South seek a sustainable livelihood, and fair trade outlets in the North offer them the prospect of regular income. In the North, 'partners' in development organisations seek to open up a consumer niche market that will pay a premium for products sourced from a just, nonexploitative, and environment-friendly production system. Small is beautiful [...] . The fair trade market in Europe is still tiny, but it has some growth potential. I estimate that fair trade coffee accounts for about 2 % of the Dutch market, compared with about 5 % for bio-organic dairy products, fruit, and vegetables. Enthusiastic consumers in all northern countries will make a special effort to purchase goods with a Fair Trade label. But the point is that the fair trade niche market (sentimental market) is limited, and it will stay that way until we can move fair products into the mainstream. The main value of the fair trade movement, backed by its heavy advertising and insistence on fair trade brands and trademarks, is in educating the northern public. In fact, about half of the extra price charged for fair trade products currently represents the cost of publicity and education work in the consumer market. The fair trade banana is a case in point: it costs up to 40 % more than the 'normal' banana, whether that is a dollar banana from Latin America or an <b>ACP</b> plantation <b>banana.</b> In other words, the consumer is paying a premium to inform other consumers. Consumers are becoming more sophisticated, and self-centred but are still human. Most people prefer to buy something that is good for their purse or their health. Fair trade is often compared to the organic foods market, which is based primarily on health concerns, and secondarily on environmental interests. In Denmark, biological dairy products now hold 50 % of the total market share, but they are not necessarily produced according to the same principles as those of fair trade. We have to ensure that fair trade products reach these high levels of market share. To do so, we must move beyond the present sentimental market and into the mainstream. This cannot be done by the FTOs; the only way is to open up trade to fair market forces. From the point of view of consumers, they should be able to procure fair trade products from the mainstream, where they will get reliable quality without paying the surcharge. Faced with products of similar quality, they will choose the 'fairer' one, but not at any price. Upstream, on the production side, we have to help the producers rely on themselves, without the protection of the fair trade movement. Such protection is not sustainable and cannot cover more than a small proportion of producers. Without intending it, fair trade in fact creates division among producers. [...] . but a mass market is better for our farmers Much needs to be done to raise productivity in cooperatives and other sources of fair products, so that they can ultimately compete with multinational plantation produce. Efficiency, waste control, improved input management, economies of scale, and efficiency are concepts that must be adopted by producer groups. We must encourage greater ownership, in very real forms, of the means of production, so that producers are more responsible for their output. Further downstream, more emphasis should be paid to logistics, transport, and marketing strategies. Paradoxically, the fair trade movement is unintentionally paternalistic, which does not help our producers. Whilst a few may be able to supply the sentimental market, which is finite, most will still be exposed to the unjust global market. We have to operate in the global market, and we have to empower our producers to face its challenges. Current World Bank training programmes in West Africa aim to help farmers and traders understand new European legislation on environmental standards for agricultural produce and its restrictions on imports, for example of groundnuts from Mali and Senegal. The strategy is to negotiate directly and equally with importers and to pass through a minimum of intermediaries, whether commodity agents or FTOs. Fair trade has served its purpose in creating an awareness and a demand. But it cannot be considered the universal salvation. Gradually market forces will force FTOs out of the picture. Build confidence Ultimately, we have to deal with Africa's fundamental problem: our loss of confidence. Confidence means security, and it comes from education, taking risks, falling down and standing up again, and not always being protected. We need the confidence to develop a fair product, and to bargain for ourselves. Only then shall we have a fair market.

40|$|In a hard-hitting report {{released}} on the August 22 nd 2002, Oxfam UK criticised the EU sugar regime for destroying livelihoods {{in developing countries}} such as Mozambique (not a <b>traditional</b> beneficiary of <b>ACP</b> sugar preferences, although a recent beneficiary of EBA sugar access). While recognising the benefits gained by ACP countries from the existing EU sugar regime, the Oxfam report highlighted the anomaly {{of one of the}} least efficient sugar producers being one of the world's leading refined sugar exporters. The report argues that the EU's sugar export regime encourages the supply of high cost EU sugar to the world market (with the benefit of export refunds) in ways which depress the world market price and undermine the development of competitive sugar production and value added sugar processing in developing countries. The report also highlight the exceptionally high profits generated by sugar sector millers that are virtual monopoly producers in many EU member states. The case of British Sugar in the UK which, {{as a result of the}} current EU sugar regime, makes exceptionally high profits compared to other food-sector enterprises in the same corporate family, was highlighted. Oxfam's immediate call was for an end to subsidised EU sugar exports and for additional market access for LDC and ACP suppliers. The web site of the Sugar Traders Associations of the United Kingdom maintained that this demand was not 'inconsistent with keeping a higher price in Europe than on the world market in order to permit remunerative prices for sugar growers'. Comment: Oxfam's call to end subsidised exports needs to be seen against the background of the CAP mid-term review's renewed emphasis on moving over to an extended system of de-coupled farm support, which would cover a wide range of products and leave farmers involved in the scheme free to choose which crops to grow depending on market signals. Such an ultimate objective would inevitably require a substantial reduction in the EU sugar price, perhaps by amounts similar to those currently being proposed in the rice sector. While there is no suggestion that sugar should be included in this multi-product system in the short term, beyond 2007 it is evident that the European Commission would like to see sugar included in this single multi-product scheme of de-coupled farm support. The web site of the Sugar Traders Association of the UK draws an analogy between future developments in the EU sugar sector and current proposals for reform of the EU rice regime. With an established timetable for the phasing in of duty free access for least-developed-country sugar exports and a challenge to the EU sugar regime in the WTO being mounted which would limit the EU's capacity to dispose of sugar on world markets with the benefit of export refunds, an acute market situation similar to that currently faced on the EU rice market could in due course emerge in the EU sugar market. A shift towards increased direct aid-payments to EU sugar-beet farmers linked to a dramatic reduction in the EU sugar price beyond 2006 should not therefore be ruled out.
