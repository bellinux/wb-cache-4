5|$|Phillips, by now divorced, {{spent the}} {{following}} years on a downward spiral which included, by her own account, spending $120,000 on cocaine, before entering therapy to recover from her addiction. Then, in 1988, having been out of Hollywood for eleven years, she sold all her assets to produce The Beat, about {{a kid in a}} tough neighbourhood <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> poetry to local gangs. It was a critical and commercial disaster, grossing less than $5,000 at the box office, and Phillips turned to penning her scathing memoir to escape her financial difficulties.|$|E

25|$|Filch is {{revealed}} to be a Squib in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets when Harry accidentally discovers that he is <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> himself basic magic from a Kwikspell correspondence course. Nonetheless, Filch is at least able to use wizarding devices that have their own innate magic, such as the Secrecy Sensor used in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. It is hinted that his dislike of students may stem from his disappointment and jealousy at {{not being able to}} do magic. In the Half Blood Prince, Harry and Hermione jokingly suspect that he is in a relationship with Irma Pince, the librarian at Hogwarts. In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the final book, when the school starts preparing itself for the Battle of Hogwarts, Filch is seen yelling that students are out of bed. He is later seen overseeing the evacuation of younger students.|$|E
25|$|Sir Alan Burns, Governor of British Honduras (1934-1939), used Benque Viejo as {{an example}} of one {{challenge}} that teaching in Belizean schools presents: “I have heard German nuns <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> Maya children out of an English textbook which they had to explain in Spanish.” The solution, in higher education at least, has been to require English in the classroom. The Garifuna have enculturated the Catholic Mass and have it in their own language. As regards the Kriol language which most speak in Belize City there has been more controversy. Several Christian churches have introduced Kriol into their services and a Kriol New Testament has been produced. But the Catholic Mass, requiring approval from Roman authorities, has not been translated into Kriol. On the other hand, Catholics are deeply involved in the Kriol Council, and St. John’s College through its Belize Institute for Social Research and Action (BISRA) publishes Belizean Studies which carries articles on the role of Kriol and other cultures in Belizean Society.|$|E

Parents from various cities (Ankara, Diyarbakır, Hakkâri, Hatay, Iğdır, İstanbul, Kastamonu, Kırşehir, Muğla) around Turkey were selected through maximum variation sampling, a purposive sampling method. The current study was conducted within the qualitative research methods. Results were obtained through content and descriptive analyses of data collected with open-ended question forms. Parents <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> the value of honesty as the first priority within family.

So you are kind of <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> us something else."

Reacting to the sentence, Auschwitz survivor Eva Mozes Kor said that she was [...] "disappointed" [...] adding: [...] "They are <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> a lesson that if you commit such a crime, you will be punished. But I do not think the court has acted properly in sentencing him to four years in jail. It is too late for that kind of sentence... My preference would have been to sentence him to community service by speaking out against neo-Nazis. I would like the court to prove to me, a survivor, how four years in jail will benefit anybody." [...] Gröning's defence lawyer, Hans Holtermann, was quoted as saying that he would review the verdict before deciding whether to appeal. On 28 November 2016, the appeal was declined by the German Federal Court of Justice (BGH). In August 2017 Oskar Gröning was considered to be fit for prison.|$|E
