40|$|This thesis {{addressed}} the question, 2 ̆ 2 How should journalists cover the environment, {{according to the}} conversation between the scholarship on environmental journalism and <b>the</b> <b>handbooks</b> on environmental journalism? 2 ̆ 2 Do <b>the</b> <b>handbooks,</b> written for practicing journalists, agree with the academic scholarship on environmental journalism? The conversation between <b>the</b> literature and <b>handbooks</b> is important to examine, as <b>the</b> <b>handbooks</b> are tools journalists may use when reporting on <b>the</b> environment. <b>The</b> <b>handbooks</b> could influence a journalist, who influences the public, who make decisions in a democracy. As well, examining the conversation between the literature and <b>the</b> <b>handbooks</b> reveals {{whether or not the}} academy and the practice agree on how to respond to the criticisms and challenges of environmental journalism. Do they offer the same tips for improvement? First, an extensive literature review on environmental journalism revealed the criticisms, challenges, and tips to improve. Second, a qualitative document analysis examined handbooks published for journalists covering the environment to capture definitions, meanings, and similarities and differences among them. Third, the results of the literature review and the results of the document analysis were compared to examine if <b>the</b> <b>handbooks</b> respond, emulate, or differ from the literature content. Findings include five qualitative document analyses of <b>the</b> <b>handbooks,</b> and a comparative essay of <b>the</b> <b>handbooks</b> to <b>the</b> scholarly literature. These findings were based on the researcher 2 ̆ 7 s interpretive analysis. The conversation between <b>the</b> literature and <b>handbooks</b> is a healthy one. As the literature presents challenges and criticisms, <b>the</b> <b>handbooks</b> suggest solutions. Most importantly, as the literature presents tips and techniques for improvement, <b>the</b> <b>handbooks</b> agree with <b>the</b> ways to improve. Overall, the scholarship on environmental journalism and <b>the</b> <b>handbooks</b> on environmental journalism are 2 ̆ 2 on the same page. 2 ̆ 2 Both support understanding audience needs, obtaining a solid understanding of a topic before reporting, addressing environmental issues thoroughly, translating the science, providing the history of a topic, addressing risk, using diverse sources, maintaining long-term coverage, disseminating objective information, and more training for journalists...|$|R
40|$|Three {{handbooks}} {{have been}} developed, {{in conjunction with}} a wide range of stakeholders to assist in the management of contaminated food production systems, inhabited areas and drinking water following a radiological incident. <b>The</b> <b>handbooks</b> are aimed at national and local authorities, central government departments and agencies, emergency services, radiation protection experts, the agriculture and food production sectors, industry and others who may be affected. <b>The</b> <b>handbooks</b> include management options for application in the different phases of an incident. Sources of contamination considered in <b>the</b> <b>handbooks</b> include nuclear accidents and radiological dispersion devices; the most relevant radionuclides are included. <b>The</b> <b>handbooks</b> are divided into several sections which provide supporting scientific and technical information; an analysis of the factors influencing recovery; compendia of comprehensive, state-of-the-art datasheets for around 100 management options and guidance on planning in advance.

5|$|Eldred did {{not have}} a troop board of review, a review by the adult troop leaders to ensure eligibility. Instead, Eldred had a {{thorough}} National Board of Review consisting of West, Baden-Powell, Ernest Thompson Seton, Daniel Carter Beard, Arthur R. Forbush, and Wilbert E. Longfellow, who wrote in <b>the</b> <b>Handbook</b> for Boys on life-saving and swimming. At the time there had still not been a council-level system for Eagle Scouts boards of review. Largely due to delays caused by Baden-Powell's visit, the National Court of Honor did not convene until March 29, 1912. A press announcement was released on or about April 10, 1912, leading to a century of confusion wherein it was believed Eldred's Board of Review had been held in April. West informed Eldred of his Eagle award in a letter dated August 21, 1912. Another reason for the delays was that the Boy Scouts of America felt no one would ever earn the Eagle Scout award and at the time of Eldred's Board of Review, the Eagle Scout medal had not yet been designed. This letter also informed Eldred of the delay in the medal, caused {{by the fact that the}} design of the Eagle Scout medal had not been finalized. Eldred was presented Eagle Scout on Labor Day, September 2, 1912, becoming the first to earn Scouting's highest rank, just two years after the founding of the BSA itself.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{the study}} of environmental consciousness as a discursive educational project. The empirical material consist of 18 environmental handbooks that have been published in Sweden during the years 1976 - 2007 of which 13 appeared between 1988 and 1995. The research work uses the basic assumptions of discourse analysis, namely that language {{is an important factor in}} the construction and development of social norms and values. Three areas recieve close attention: questions relating to the form and content of <b>the</b> <b>handbooks,</b> questions relating to the social circumstances in which <b>the</b> <b>handbooks</b> were produced and questions relating to the overall educational significance of <b>the</b> <b>handbooks.</b> In <b>the</b> first instance, <b>the</b> <b>handbooks</b> are examined in the light of three different contextual stories. They can be read as part of wider discussions of environmentally-concsious life-styles, as a development of earlier Swedish discussions about domesticity, health, thrift and consumption, and, finally they can be read as an expression of a narrative about a dominant aspect of modernity – science. The second part of the research work comprises an examination of <b>the</b> <b>handbooks</b> in terms of their audience and educational purpose. What kind of individual is to be shaped by these handbooks? What is anticipated as the desired or ideal environmentalist? Discourse analysis suggests that, collectively, <b>the</b> <b>handbooks</b> project an image of somone who displays qualities of motivation, investigation and judgement. They should be motivated to begin a process of change in their lives, to encourage others to do the same, and to adopt the environmental problems as their own personal problems. The second quality pursued in <b>the</b> <b>handbooks</b> is of someone who should take an active stance towards the environment as a pervasive element in their way of life. They should, therefore, adopt an investigative attitude to the surrounding world, cultivate certain cognitive properties such as watchfulness, thoughtfulness and being suspicious, and constantly ask questions about their surroundings with a view to understanding how actions in their private world has an effect on the wider world. And thirdly, the ideal environmentalist citizen should be someone who demonstrates judgement in balancing polarities and resolving the claims of different standpoints. They should give attention to separating right from wrong, wisdom from madness and, above all, to finding a way of linking their own efforts to what is worth striving for and what is worth avoiding or neglecting. In summary, the subjects identified in <b>the</b> <b>handbooks</b> are expected to avoid extreme positions, to place their own expectations about sustainability on a suitable level, and to be prepared for failure and feelings of guilt. The final part of the investigation – interpreting the wider significance of <b>the</b> <b>handbooks</b> – uses a pluralistic model of analysis which takes its departure from three concepts – ecological modernisation, governmentality and the risk society. Using these orientations, the extent of the discursive educational project of <b>the</b> environmental <b>handbooks</b> is highlighted. If <b>the</b> <b>handbooks</b> are regarded as modernist prescriptions, they are texts which highlights slow and careful change taking place within the present power structure of society. If they are regarded as texts that offer a governmentality prescription, they can be read as texts which promote the transformation of everyday micropractices. And if they are regarded as prescriptions for a risk society, they are texts which enable readers to come to terms with confusion and powerlessness in a complex and risky social context. One main result is that <b>the</b> environmental <b>handbooks</b> display interesting similarities, worthy of futher exploration, supported by a broadened empirical base...|$|R
