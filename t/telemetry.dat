5|$|Kongsfjord <b>Telemetry</b> Station {{constituted}} one of {{the four}} initial ESTRACK ground stations which provided radio tracking and <b>telemetry</b> communication with ESRO's low Earth orbit satellites. The ground station communicated with the satellites in the 136–137MHz band. This was optimal for low-orbit satellites, allowed for a small antenna dish but gave a low bit rate. The various satellites using the facility conducted measurements of solar radiation, cosmic radiation, the polar ionosphere, and ionizing and dynamic effects regarding electric currents and magnetic disturbances.|$|E
5|$|The {{choice of}} Tromsø as a {{location}} for a <b>telemetry</b> stations {{was in part}} tied to the Tromsø Geophysical Observatory—which had been located in Tromsø since 1928—and the planned University of Tromsø. The Canadian Space Agency was at the time working on the Alouette 2 program and were seen by NDRE as a natural cooperation partner. The NASA's International Satellite for Ionospheric Studies was also being designed and NASA therefore decided to supply equipment for a <b>telemetry</b> station in Tromsø to be operational by August 1966.|$|E
5|$|The first {{proposals}} for a <b>telemetry</b> station in Tromsø {{were made in}} early 1964. The concept was to build a real-time <b>telemetry</b> station which would allow for simultaneous observations of the ionosphere from both satellites and sounding rockets. The idea was backed by Norway's Space Research Committee. Ideas for a real-time <b>telemetry</b> station also arose in ESRO and NTNF included the project in its five-year space program in 1965. Similar proposals were made in northern Sweden and a race started between Norwegian and Swedish interests to gain ESRO's support for a station. Norway had budgetary limitations prohibiting a full-scale station, and instead support was gained from the United States and Canada. The project was also backed by NDRE.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{contract with}} ESRO lasted until 1 July 1974, when their low-Earth orbit program terminated. NTNF proposed closing Tromsø <b>Telemetry</b> Station as the remaining customers {{did not provide}} sufficient revenue to keep operations viable. Norway also declined to join the European Space Agency (ESA), which resulted in little hope in ESA choosing to cooperate with a Norwegian earth station. NTNF also looked into outright selling the station to ESA, but the offer was turned down. Kongsfjord <b>Telemetry</b> Station was closed in 1974.|$|E
5|$|After {{the initial}} ESRO program was initiated, the agency moved towards {{satellites}} {{with a higher}} orbital eccentricity and escape orbits. The facilities in Ny-Ålesund were unsuitable for <b>telemetry</b> with such satellites, as they would operate at a different frequency, {{the size of the}} antenna dish was too small and the ground station's geographical position was out of range. Because of the change of ESRO's focus, the need for a <b>telemetry</b> station on Svalbard disappeared after the termination of ESRO's initial program, and the facility was closed in 1974.|$|E
5|$|However, when Kraft {{began to}} plan NASA's flight operations, no human being had yet flown in space. In fact, the task before him was vast, {{requiring}} attention to flight plans, timelines, procedures, mission rules, spacecraft tracking, <b>telemetry,</b> ground support, telecommunications networks and contingency management.|$|E
5|$|In 1973 NTNF started {{planning}} {{to use the}} station for downloading from NASA's Landsat program. Sufficient funding from the government was secured in mid 1976, after a successful lobby operation which emphasized the possibility of environmental observation in Norway's territorial waters. 7.5 million Norwegian krone (NOK) was granted for upgrades in 1977. Norway entered negotiations with the US, but soon ESA and NASA started discussions regarding two European <b>telemetry</b> stations for Landsat to serve all ESA members. ESA and Sweden pushed for Kiruna, Sweden, to be the location of ESA's northern <b>telemetry</b> station and Tromsø was discarded because of Norway's decision to not join ESA.|$|E
5|$|Micro Instrumentation and <b>Telemetry</b> Systems (MITS) was an American {{electronics}} company {{founded in}} Albuquerque, New Mexico that began manufacturing electronic calculators in 1971 and personal computers in 1975. Ed Roberts and Forrest Mims founded MITS in December 1969 to produce miniaturized <b>telemetry</b> modules for model rockets {{such as a}} roll rate sensor. In 1971, Roberts redirected the company into the electronic calculator market and the MITS 816 desktop calculator kit was featured on the November 1971 cover of Popular Electronics. The calculators were very successful and sales topped one million dollars in 1973. A brutal calculator price war left the company deeply in debt by 1974.|$|E
5|$|Parallel to NDRE's work, NTNF {{was working}} with ESRO to gain support for a <b>telemetry</b> station. There was a degree of urgency as ESRO wanted the {{facility}} completed by 1967 {{in time for the}} launch of the spacecraft ESRO-2. NTNF and ESRO were also working on the establishment of Kongsfjord <b>Telemetry</b> Station in Ny-Ålesund. The agreement to build the station was approved by the Parliament of Norway in mid 1966. Part of the reason for the Norwegian support was the opportunity of training Norwegians in pulse-code modulation and digital computing. For NDRE the station was a chance to apply its latest minicomputer, the Simulation for Automatic Machinery (SAM).|$|E
5|$|Preliminary {{work in the}} {{planning}} of ESRO operations concluded that the ESTRACK network would initially consist of four radio tracking and <b>telemetry</b> stations and three optical tracking stations. In addition to Svalbard, tracking and <b>telemetry</b> stations were built on the Falkland Islands, in Fairbanks, Alaska and in Redu, Belgium. France actively opposed the Svalbard location, as Norway was {{not a member of}} ESRO. The ESRO secretariat wanted to quicken the location decision, as it was necessary to have all four in operation before the launch of the ESRO-1 and ESRO-2 satellites.|$|E
5|$|The {{contract}} with ESRO resulted in TSS providing <b>telemetry</b> for ESRO-IA, ESRO-IB, ESRO-2B, HEOS-1, HEOS-2, TD-1A and ESRO-4, {{all of which}} had low-Earth orbits. The two <b>telemetry</b> stations used {{a large portion of}} the Norwegian space budget, but became platforms which allowed for development of technology. Tromsø Satellite Station worked well in tandem with Andøya Rocket Range and became an international center for study of the auroral zone. The University of Tromsø was established in 1968 and started teaching in 1972. The same year, it took over the geophysical observatory and cosmic geophysics became one of the university's fields of excellence.|$|E
5|$|To {{estimate}} population sizes within {{specific areas}} {{and to keep}} track of individual jaguars, camera trapping and wildlife tracking <b>telemetry</b> are widely used, and feces may be sought out with the help of detector dogs to study jaguar health and diet.|$|E
5|$|On 9 September, McLaren lodged an {{official}} {{complaint with the}} FIA about the incident. In the appeal hearing on 22 September, McLaren alleged that they had twice been advised by race director Charlie Whiting that Hamilton had correctly returned the position to Räikkönen. Furthermore, they presented <b>telemetry</b> evidence suggesting that Hamilton had not only crossed the finish line after Räikkönen, {{but that he was}} travelling 6.7km/h slower at the time.|$|E
5|$|Planned for May 2018 is {{the launch}} of NASA's InSight lander, along with the twin MarCO CubeSats that will fly by Mars and provide a <b>telemetry</b> relay for the landing. The mission is {{expected}} to arrive at Mars in November 2018. NASA plans to launch its Mars 2020 astrobiology rover in July or August 2020.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the closing}} of the mines in 1963, the mining company Kings Bay had been working to {{establish}} Ny-Ålesund as a research town. The <b>telemetry</b> station acted as an important stepping stone for research activity, and the plans for development of Ny-Ålesund as a permanent research community continued past 1974. In 1997, Svalbard Satellite Station opened in Longyearbyen, which is among other stations used by ESTRACK.|$|E
5|$|Spacecraft {{communications}} {{included a}} command subsystem operating at 154.2 and 2106.4MHz and a PCM narrow-band <b>telemetry</b> subsystem, operating at 2287.5 and 137.86MHz, for spacecraft housekeeping, attitude, and sensor performance data. Video {{data from the}} three-camera RBV system was transmitted in both real-time and tape recorder modes at 2265.5MHz, while information from the MSS was constrained to a 20MHz radio-frequency bandwidth at 2229.5MHz.|$|E
5|$|Test {{data from}} the earlier Lockheed X-7 {{unmanned}} ramjet/rocket program proved invaluable for aerodynamic research since the XF-104 would share the general design of the X-7's wing and tail. Experience gained from the Douglas X-3 Stiletto was also used in the design phase of the XF-104. Over 400 surplus instrumented artillery rockets were launched to test various airfoils and tail designs; from which the camera film and <b>telemetry</b> were recovered by parachute.|$|E
5|$|The ASAT test mission, {{the final}} {{flight of the}} High Virgo missile, was {{conducted}} on September 22, 1959. Less than a minute after {{the launch of the}} missile from its B-58 carrier aircraft at Mach 2, the <b>telemetry</b> signal was lost. No data was recovered from the test, and the camera data, intended to be recovered afterward, was not located. Hence the test was inconclusive.|$|E
5|$|The {{study of}} bog turtles {{in the wild}} is a {{significant}} aid {{to the development of}} a conservation strategy. Radio <b>telemetry</b> has been used to track the turtles' movements in their natural habitat. Blood samples, fecal samples, and cloacal swabs are also commonly collected from wild populations and tested for signs of disease.|$|E
5|$|Between 1925 and 1928, Ny-Ålesund saw four air {{expeditions to}} the North Pole, {{two of which}} {{required}} {{the construction of an}} airship hangar and mast. The first proposal for an airport in Ny-Ålesund was launched in 1956 by Norsk Polar Navigasjon, who proposed an airport at Kvadehuksletta. Soviet protests against the airport caused the Norwegian authorities to oppose the plans, which were laid to rest in the early 1960s. Construction at Hamnerabben started in 1965 following the decision to build Kongsfjord <b>Telemetry</b> Station. The airport first hosted service to temporary landing strips near Longyearbyen, but from 1975 served Svalbard Airport. Lufttransport started flights with helicopters in the 1980s, but from 1989 has flown with fixed-wing aircraft.|$|E
5|$|In March 2013, Juniper {{released}} the EX9200 switch, which isn't {{part of the}} MX Series, but uses the same software and Trio chipset. A virtualized MX series 3D router, the vMX 3D, was introduced in November 2014. A suite of updates were announced in late 2015. New MPC line cards were introduced, which have a throughput of up to 1.6 Tbit/s. Simultaneously the Juniper Extension Toolkit (JET) was announced. JET is a programming interface for integrating third-party applications that automate provisioning, maintenance and other tasks. The Junos <b>Telemetry</b> Interface was also announced at the same time. It reports data to applications and other equipment to automate changes to the network in response to faults or in order optimize performance.|$|E
5|$|The European Space Research Organization (ESRO) {{established}} Kongsfjord <b>Telemetry</b> Station in Ny-Ålesund {{as one of}} {{its four}} initial European Space Tracking Network stations. The facility remained in use from 1967 to 1974, but was closed as it was not suitable for ESRO's second generation of satellites. During the planning of the station, Longyearbyen had been proposed as a location, and it was largely political concerns by Norwegian authorities to create permanent activity in Ny-Ålesund which lead ESRO to accept the location.|$|E
5|$|The Moon landing {{data was}} {{recorded}} {{by a special}} Apollo TV camera which recorded in a format incompatible with broadcast TV. This resulted in lunar footage {{that had to be}} converted for the live television broadcast and stored on magnetic <b>telemetry</b> tapes. During the following years, a magnetic tape shortage prompted NASA to remove massive numbers of magnetic tapes from the National Archives and Records Administration to be recorded over with newer satellite data. Stan Lebar, who led the team that designed and built the lunar television camera at Westinghouse Electric Corporation, also worked with Nafzger to try to locate the missing tapes.|$|E
5|$|The TDRS-1 {{program was}} overall less successful, with the {{satellite}} suffering several computer failures and an overall loss of <b>telemetry</b> for several hours. In all, the orbiter {{was able to}} use the satellite for 65 of the planned 89 orbits, and could make successful use of the connection on about forty. The Continuous Flow Electrophoresis System equipment functioned as planned, processing several hundred times more material than would have been possible on Earth, and the Asahi Shimbun crystal experiment, flown for the second time, was able to produce snow crystals after the canister was redesigned.|$|E
5|$|The antennas at TSS serve {{more than}} thirty {{missions}} and contain both a multi-frequency uplink and L, S and X band downlink. In addition there are customer-owned reception, <b>telemetry,</b> tracking and control systems. TSS acts as a local user terminal for the Cospas-Sarsat system used for search and rescue. By {{using a combination of}} SvalSat and TrollSat, customers can download data twice per orbit, twenty-six times per day, with only a forty-minute maximum delay. These are the only two ground stations able to communicate with all orbits of LEO satellites. Tromsø is connected to SvalSat via the Svalbard Undersea Cable System.|$|E
5|$|The {{facility}} had a Simulation for Automatic Machinery computer {{built by}} FFI which allowed for real-time operations with the data. Telecommunications systems were {{operated by the}} Norwegian Telecommunications Administration, which established a two-way radio station at Ny-Ålesund. Communication from the satellites was relayed by radio to Ski and onwards with a leased line to the European Space Operations Centre in Darmstadt, Germany. Return information was relayed via a radio station at Jeløy. Magnetic tapes were sent to Darmstadt every other week, first via aircraft to Longyearbyen and then onwards to Germany. NTNF hired a nurse and had the Amundsen House refitted as a clinic {{for the duration of}} the <b>telemetry</b> station's operation.|$|E
5|$|The {{instrumentation}} included ten smoked paper analog seismometers {{that were}} configured {{to allow for}} 48 hours of continuous single-component data recording. Six digital recorders built by the Institut de Physique du Globe de Strasbourg were also used to record signals from three-component seismometers. Eight of the selected sites were equipped with a vertical component velocity transducer along with an FM <b>telemetry</b> link to transfer data back to a central station where a three-component unit was stationed. There the seismic signals were digitized, along with an internal time signal and an external DCF77 time signal, and stored on magnetic tape. The tapes were then played back and the P-wave and S-wave arrival times were used to automatically determine aftershock locations. Approximately two hundred aftershocks were recorded each day for the first several days of the expedition {{and at the end}} of the recording period in February the equipment was still picking up around 100 shocks per day. The team then set out to determine an accurate velocity model using data from the more accurate <b>telemetry</b> network. The soviet geophysicists detonated 100 kilograms of TNT in a hole drilled near the mainshock epicenter and the resulting shock waves were detected and used to help pinpoint a more accurate crustal velocity value of 5.3 to 5.4km/s.|$|E
5|$|The {{major event}} of the second day (August 31, 1983) was the {{successful}} deployment of the INSAT-1B satellite, which took place at 7:48 UTC, with Challenger then maneuvering to avoid the firing of the booster motor forty minutes later. Other experimentation continued, though <b>telemetry</b> through TDRS was lost for around three hours, requiring manual intervention. A fire alarm sounded in the morning, indicating signs of {{a fire in the}} avionics compartment, but a second alarm remained silent and it was eventually determined to be a false alarm.|$|E
5|$|The team's {{pre-season}} preparations were {{overshadowed by}} an accident involving Fernando Alonso {{on the final}} day of testing that saw Alonso hospitalised with a concussion and ruled out of the third and final test. Kevin Magnussen, McLaren's test and reserve driver, was drafted in as his replacement for the remainder of the test and the opening round of the season. Alonso later attributed the accident to a steering failure, although McLaren maintained that there was no evidence of a car failure in the <b>telemetry</b> data following the accident.|$|E
5|$|They {{designed}} and built the <b>telemetry</b> modules {{in their homes and}} garages but they were only able to sell a few hundred units. Mims had sold a feature article about the new solid-state device, light-emitting diodes, to Popular Electronics (circulation 400,000) that May. With the hope of selling kits to the larger readership; Roberts and Mims designed a device that would transmit voice over a beam of light, the Opticom. The editors accepted the project story and both articles were featured {{on the cover of the}} November 1970 issue. The payment for the articles was $400 but meeting Les Solomon, Popular Electronics technical editor, proved to be significant to both Mims and Roberts future success.|$|E
5|$|Transit {{observations}} in 1874 and 1882 allowed this value to be refined further. Three expeditions—from Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States—were {{sent to the}} Kerguelen Archipelago for the 1874 observations. The American astronomer Simon Newcomb combined {{the data from the}} last four transits, and he arrived at a value of about 149.59 million kilometers (±0.31 million kilometers). Modern techniques, {{such as the use of}} radio <b>telemetry</b> from space probes, and of radar measurements of the distances to planets and asteroids in the Solar System, have allowed a reasonably accurate value for the astronomical unit (AU) to be calculated to a precision of about ±30 meters. As a result, the need for parallax calculations has been superseded.|$|E
5|$|With {{a sizable}} oily liver and low-density tissues, the Pacific {{electric}} ray is almost neutrally buoyant and can hover {{in the water}} column with very little effort. Propulsive power is provided by the muscular tail, while the disc is held rigid. <b>Telemetry</b> studies have shown that this species swims primarily at night, when it enters reefs and other habitats with high terrain relief, and spends most of the day in nearby open areas buried in sediment. It is nomadic and solitary, though several individuals may rest within the same area.|$|E
5|$|Following the accident, Johnson {{suggested}} {{launching the}} D-21 {{from the very}} large Boeing B-52 Stratofortress bomber, and adding a solid rocket booster to get it up to speed. The drone was modified by adding attachment points on its spine to mate with the carrying pylon on the B-52 and its belly attachment points were adapted to accommodate the rocket booster necessary to increase its speed and allow its ramjet to operate. Its vertical stabilizer was increased in size by approximately 20%. The modified drone version was designated D-21B (there was no D-21A). Two B-52Hs were modified to carry a pair of drones each by means of two large underwing pylons that replaced the smaller pylons used for the AGM-28 Hound Dog cruise missiles. The tail gunner's and electronic warfare officer's stations were replaced with two launch control stations. Command and <b>telemetry</b> systems were added, and high-speed cameras were installed to track the drones as they separated from the pylons. The launch control officer on the B-52H could communicate with the D-21Bs, and could make it self-destruct.|$|E
5|$|Given the inaccessibility {{of much of}} the species' range, {{particularly}} the central Amazon, estimating jaguar numbers is difficult. Researchers typically focus on particular bioregions, thus species-wide analysis is scant. In 1991, 600–1,000 (the highest total) were estimated to be living in Belize. A year earlier, 125–180 jaguars were estimated to be living in Mexico's 4,000-km2 (2400-mi2) Calakmul Biosphere Reserve, with another 350 in the state of Chiapas. The adjoining Maya Biosphere Reserve in Guatemala, with an area measuring 15,000km2 (9,000mi2), may have 465–550 animals. Work employing GPS <b>telemetry</b> in 2003 and 2004 found densities of only six to seven jaguars per 100km2 in the critical Pantanal region, compared with 10 to 11 using traditional methods; this suggests the widely used sampling methods may inflate the actual numbers of cats.|$|E
5|$|National {{competitions}} generally {{last one}} week, with international championships running over two. The winner is the pilot who has amassed {{the greatest number}} of points over all the contest days. However, these competitions have as yet failed to draw much interest outside the gliding community for several reasons. Because it would be unsafe for many gliders to cross a start line at the same time, pilots can choose their own start time. Furthermore, gliders are not visible to the spectators for long periods during each day's contest and the scoring is complex, so traditional gliding competitions are difficult to televise. In an attempt to widen the sport's appeal, a new format, the Grand Prix, has been introduced. Innovations introduced in the Grand Prix format include simultaneous starts for a small number of gliders, cockpit mounted cameras, <b>telemetry</b> giving the positions of the gliders, tasks consisting of multiple circuits, and simplified scoring.|$|E
5|$|Radio {{communications}} provided <b>telemetry</b> {{and scientific}} data links between Mir and the RKA Mission Control Centre (TsUP). Radio links {{were also used}} during rendezvous and docking procedures and for audio and video communication between crew members, flight controllers and family members. As a result, Mir was equipped with several communication systems used for different purposes. The station communicated directly with the ground via the Lira antenna mounted to the core module. The Lira antenna also had the capability to use the Luch data relay satellite system (which fell into disrepair in the 1990s) and the network of Soviet tracking ships deployed in various locations around the world (which also became unavailable in the 1990s). UHF radio was used by cosmonauts conducting EVAs. UHF was also employed by other spacecraft that docked to or undocked from the station, such as Soyuz, Progress, and the Space Shuttle, {{in order to receive}} commands from the TsUP and Mir crew members via the TORU system.|$|E
