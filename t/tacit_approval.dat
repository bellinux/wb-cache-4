5|$|In late 2007 {{and early}} 2008, several Russian newspapers, {{including}} Rossiyskaya Gazeta, Komsomolskaya Pravda, and Nezavisimaya Gazeta printed stories that implicated the Nazis in the crime, spurring concern {{that this was}} done with the <b>tacit</b> <b>approval</b> of the Kremlin. As a result, the Polish Institute of National Remembrance decided to open its own investigation.|$|E
5|$|Lansdale {{employed}} {{a variety of}} stunts to encourage more northerners to move south. South Vietnamese soldiers in civilian clothing infiltrated the north, spreading rumours of impending doom. One story was that the communists had a deal with Vietnam's traditional enemy China, allowing two communist Chinese divisions to invade the north. The story reported that the Chinese were raping and pillaging with the <b>tacit</b> <b>approval</b> of the communists. Lansdale hired counterfeiters to produce bogus Viet Minh leaflets on how to behave under communist rule, advising them to create a list of their material possessions so that the communists {{would be able to}} confiscate them more easily, thereby fomenting peasant discontent.|$|E
5|$|The prisoners {{realised}} that if {{they managed}} to fully counterfeit the dollars, their lives {{would no longer be}} safeguarded by the work they were undertaking, so they slowed their progress as much as they could. The journalist Lawrence Malkin, who wrote a history of Operation Bernhard, writes that prisoners considered this to have the <b>tacit</b> <b>approval</b> of Krüger, who would face front-line duty if Operation Bernhard ended. In August 1944 Salomon Smolianoff, a convicted forger, was added to the production team at Sachsenhausen to aid the counterfeiting of US dollars, although he also assisted in quality control for the pound notes. The Jewish prisoners working on the operation at the time complained to Krüger at having to work with a criminal, so he was given his own room to sleep in.|$|E
50|$|Different {{categories}} of hadith (sayings {{attributed to the}} Islamic prophet Muhammad) {{have been used by}} various scholars. The muhaddithun (experts in the science of hadith criticism) generally use two terms - taqrīr for <b>tacit</b> <b>approvals,</b> and khabar for sayings and acts ascribed to Muhammad.|$|R

5|$|The Democratic party {{continued}} {{to criticize the}} Sangkum and Sihanouk in their newspaper, much to Sihanouk's consternation. In August 1957 Sihanouk finally lost patience, calling out Democrat leaders for a debate. Five of them attended. At the debate, held at the royal palace, Sihanouk spoke in a belligerent tone, challenging the Democrat leaders to present evidence of malfeasance in his government and inviting them to join the Sangkum. The Democrat leaders gave hesitant responses, and according to American historian David P. Chandler, it gave the audience {{the impression that they}} were disloyal to the monarchy. The debate led to the effective demise of the Democratic party, as its leaders were subsequently beaten up by government soldiers, with Sihanouk's <b>tacit</b> <b>approval.</b> With the Democrats vanquished, Sihanouk focused on preparing for general elections, slated to be held in March 1958. He drafted left-wing politicians, including Hou Yuon, Hu Nim, and Chau Seng, to stand as Sangkum candidates, with a view to winning left-wing support from the Pracheachon. The Pracheachon on their part fielded five candidates for the elections. However, four of them withdrew, as they were prevented by the national police from holding any election rallies. When voting took place, the Sangkum won all seats in the national assembly.|$|E
5|$|On 18 May Ursúa {{requested}} three missionaries {{to support}} the expedition from the Franciscan provincial superior, friar Antonio de Silva; by 30 May three friars were ready to join the Spanish force, accompanied by a lay brother {{who had not yet}} taken vows. In addition, Silva sent another group of Franciscans led by friar Andrés de Avendaño, who was accompanied by another friar and a lay brother. This second group was only to remain with García while convenient for them to do so, and were to continue onwards independently to Nojpetén to make contact with the Itzas, with the <b>tacit</b> <b>approval</b> of Ursúa. In fact Avendaño and his party left Mérida on 2 June, a week before the party assigned to García. On 23 June Ursúa received a message informing him of the occupation of Sakb'ajlan (Dolores del Lakandon) by Guatemalan troops. By this time García was at Tzuktok', near the Kejache border. Although Ursúa's purported plan, as authorised by the Spanish crown, was to build a road uniting Yucatán with Guatemala, he now realised that he was in a race to conquer the Itza kingdom; President Barrios of Guatemala had reached Sakb'ajlan and was returning to Santiago to prepare another expedition, and Guatemalan soldiers had already reached the lakeshore of Petén Itzá. Any linking road to Dolores del Lakandon would have passed through sparsely inhabited territory; instead the Yucatecan surveyor plotted a route due south directly to the lake where it could connect with the south road via Cahabón in Verapaz. This route would leave Dolores del Lakandon and the Lakandon Ch'ol isolated to the west. Ursúa issued new orders to García dissimulating his desire to conquer the Itza. His letter ordered García to link up with President Barrios at Dolores del Lakandon, and gave him a precise route that would take him instead to the lake. A short time after receiving these orders, García ordered the construction of a fort at Chuntuki, some 25 leagues (approximately 65miles or 105km) north of Lake Petén Itzá. This would serve as the main military base for the Camino Real ("Royal Road") project; the supply base was at Kawich, under the command of Juan del Castillo y Arrué. On 27 July Ursúa authorised the creation of three new militia companies of 25 men apiece to reinforce García. Two were Spanish companies and one was a mixed-race company consisting of mestizos and pardos.|$|E

50|$|The doctrine, however, {{met with}} <b>tacit</b> British <b>approval.</b> They {{enforced}} it tactically {{as part of}} the wider Pax Britannica, which included enforcement of the neutrality of the seas. This was in line with the developing British policy of laissez-faire free trade against mercantilism. Fast-growing British industry sought markets for its manufactured goods, and, if the newly independent Latin American states became Spanish colonies again, British access to these markets would be cut off by Spanish mercantilist policy.|$|R

50|$|The {{assassination}} {{prompted a}} large-scale wave of anti-Jewish riots, called pogroms throughout 1881-1884.

The new czar, Alexander III, blamed the Jews for the riots and issued a series of harsh restrictions on Jewish movements, but large numbers of pogroms continued until 1884, with at least <b>tacit</b> government <b>approval.</b> The pogroms proved {{a turning point in}} the history of the Jews in Poland, and throughout the world. They prompted a great flood of Jewish immigration to the United States, with almost two million Jews leaving the Pale by the late 1920s, and the pogroms set the stage for Zionism.|$|R
25|$|While it {{has never}} been proven who was {{responsible}} for the assassination, most historians attribute Villa's death to a well planned conspiracy, most likely initiated by Plutarco Elías Calles and Joaquín Amaro with at least <b>tacit</b> <b>approval</b> of the then president of Mexico, Álvaro Obregón.|$|E

2500|$|The {{assassination}} {{prompted a}} large-scale wave of anti-Jewish riots, called pogroms ( [...] ;) throughout 1881–1884. In the 1881 outbreak, pogroms were primarily limited to Russia, although in a riot in Warsaw two Jews were killed, 24 others were wounded, women were raped and over two million rubles worth of property was destroyed. The new czar, Alexander III, blamed the Jews for the riots {{and issued a}} series of harsh restrictions on Jewish movements. Pogroms continued until 1884, with at least <b>tacit</b> government <b>approval.</b> They proved {{a turning point in}} the history of the Jews in partitioned Poland and throughout the world. As a result of the pogroms and the waves of antisemitism, 36 Jewish Zionist delegates met in Katowice, in 1884, forming the Hovevei Zion movement. The pogroms prompted a great flood of Jewish immigration to the United States. Nearly two million Jews left the Pale by the late 1920s, setting the stage for the Zionist movement.|$|R
5000|$|Isobel Coleman has {{observed}} {{that one reason}} for why U.S. government institutions were attacked was [...] "a widespread problem across the Arab world: People who have lived their lives largely under dictatorship simply cannot understand how a film can be made without government sanction." [...] Law professor Jack Balkin elaborated upon this point {{in an interview with}} The Atlantic: [...] "Some Egyptians and Libyans think that any products of the U.S. media that make it to their countries have at least <b>tacit</b> U.S. government <b>approval.</b> A very small part of this sad mess may be a cultural translation problem."

5000|$|On August 24, 1963, in {{the wake}} of {{government}} raids against Buddhist pagodas across the country, Hilsman, along with Forrestal and Harriman, drafted and sent Cable 243, an important message from the State Department to Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr., the U.S. ambassador to South Vietnam. It declared that Washington would no longer tolerate Nhu remaining in a position of power and ordered Lodge to pressure Diệm to remove his brother, and that if Diệm refused, the Americans would explore the possibility for alternative leadership in South Vietnam. The cable had the overall effect of giving <b>tacit</b> U.S. <b>approval</b> for a coup against the Diệm regime. [...] Hilsman was the point man for the cable - some contemporaries referred to it as the [...] "Roger Hilsman cable" [...] - as it was approved and sent while many higher-ranking officials were out of town, with each of those officials who were called to approve it doing so because he thought some other official had approved it. The events surrounding the sending of the cable led to Kennedy's becoming quite upset over the disorganization within his government. They have also long been critiqued as at best an example of a bizarrely poor decision-making process and at worst a case where a small group of secondary, anti-Diệm figures was able to circumvent normal procedures with a consequent harmful effect on the situation in Vietnam.|$|R
25|$|In Islamic terminology, {{according}} to Juan Campo, the term hadith refers to reports of statements or actions of Muhammad, or of his <b>tacit</b> <b>approval</b> or criticism of something {{said or done}} in his presence, though some sources (Khaled Abou El Fadl) limit hadith to verbal reports, with the deeds of Muhammad and reports about his companions {{being part of the}} Sunnah not hadith.|$|E
25|$|The atrocities that {{accompanied}} this expedition, together with sympathy aroused {{by the death}} of the poet and leading philhellene Lord Byron at Messolongi in 1824, eventually led the Great Powers to intervene. In October 1827, the British, French and Russian fleets, on the initiative of local commanders but with the <b>tacit</b> <b>approval</b> of their governments destroyed the Ottoman fleet at the Battle of Navarino. This was the decisive moment in the war of independence.|$|E

50|$|The HD2 was {{originally}} {{slated to be}} upgraded to Windows Phone (then known as Windows Mobile 7). Microsoft rejected it and other Windows Mobile devices, however, due to it not being compliant with the company's hardware requirements for smartphones running Windows Phone, such {{as a lack of}} a dedicated two-stage camera button and five hardware buttons on the front as compared to the three supported. However, developers have successfully ported Windows Phone to the HD2. Microsoft has expressed <b>tacit</b> and subtle <b>approval</b> of such ports, nearing the release of Mango for native Windows Phone devices. Live services were not available to HD2 as the Windows Phone on the HD2 is not activated. It is possible for users to call Microsoft to request an activation key, but the device is not supported as a WP7 phone and being given a code is not guaranteed.|$|R

50|$|East Timor was {{originally}} colonized by the Portuguese, and remained a colony {{up until the}} fall of the military dictatorship in 1974. East Timor declared independence soon afterwards, but Indonesia soon decided to intervene as {{it became clear that the}} government of the new state would most likely be leftist. The Indonesian government began Operation Komodo, which was intended to bring about the integration of the East Timorese territory. It began with a propaganda campaign, but after the outbreak of conflict in East Timor, the Indonesian military began a campaign on the 7th of October starting with an assault on a border post and accumulating with a full-scale invasion utilizing paratroopers and naval support. The United Nations quickly condemned the invasion via resolution, but due to resistance in the Security council, no further action was taken. The United States also <b>tacitly</b> gave their <b>approval,</b> as the dismantling of a pro-communist government helped advance the policy of containment being pursued by the government.|$|R

In parallel, Stere represented the Chișinău zemstvo as a lawyer in a civil lawsuit. They arrived at a time of conflict, when Black Hundreds activity was gaining momentum and peasant pressures in the countryside were meeting with resistance from reactionary politicians such as Vladimir Purishkevich and Pavel Krushevan.

40|$|The urban slum in {{the less}} {{developed}} world has an overwhelming significance of place for its dwellers: it determines who they are, what they do, where they go, and whom they know. Unlike most Western cities where the different realms of life (residential, work, religious, public, etc.) are spatially segregated, here they are all functionally and spatially integrated. A close examination of slum spaces in Dharavi, Mumbai, reveals such overlapping spatial patterns and raises some fundamental questions. Is there a proper definition of the slum? How should we conceive of the slum community and its spatial features? How useful or problematic are Western concepts of residential segregation, ghettos and enclaves? It is argued that the historical persistence of urban slums points to their indispensability, with the <b>tacit</b> (if inconsistent) <b>approval</b> of the state. Slums not only provide shelter to a large urban labour force but also a milieu that is conducive to intense social organisation and economic production.

40|$|To a large extent, the {{reaction}} of foreign powers dictated both the course and {{the outcome of the}} Civil War. The policies of four of the five major protagonists, Britain, France, Germany and Italy were substantially influenced by hostility to the fifth, the Soviet Union. Suspicion of the Soviet Union had been a major determinant of the international diplomacy of the Western powers since the revolution of October 1917. The Spanish conflict was the most recent battle in a European civil war. The early tolerance shown to both Hitler and Mussolini in the international arena was a <b>tacit</b> sign of <b>approval</b> of their policies towards the left in general and towards communism in particular. During the Spanish Civil War, it became apparent that this British and French complaisance regarding Italian and German social policies was accompanied by myopia regarding Fascist and Nazi determination to alter the international balance of power. Yet even when such ambitions could no longer be ignored, the residual sympathy for fascism of British policy-makers ensured that their first response would be simply to try to divert such ambitions in an anti-communist, and therefore Eastwards, directio...|$|R

By 2001, Kashmiri militant group Harkat-ul-Mujahideen had become a part of the al-Qaeda coalition.

He often disagreed with the Transvaal government's policies, which he considered unsupportive of mine-owners' interests. In 1895, believing he could use his influence to overthrow the Boer government, Rhodes supported the infamous Jameson Raid, {{an attack on the}} Transvaal with the <b>tacit</b> <b>approval</b> of Secretary of State for the Colonies Joseph Chamberlain.

Ja'far, who had fled Azerbaijan, offered Marzuban the chance to overthrow his master and take over {{the administration of the}} province. Ja'far, Marzuban and Wahsudan were all Isma'ilis, perhaps explaining Ja'far's decision to turn to them. In any case, Marzuban agreed and invaded Azerbaijan.

25|$|So {{far there}} has been <b>tacit</b> <b>approval</b> between the central {{government}} and Pointe-Noire and the Department of Kouilou: Most of the mayors of the coastal city have since independence been most often nationals of this region.

The fact that the first Lady Antoinette Sassou-Nguesso born Tchibota originates from Pointe-Noire, militates for this status quo. But how long will this agreement last, which the Vili consider their prerogative as descendants of this fief?

Despite restricted suffrage that favoured the upper-class Creole elite, all four candidates were elected, including Constance Cummings-John, the first woman elected to public office in British West Africa. The results severely embarrassed the governor and establishment, especially as it followed the revelation of classified dispatches from the governor to the Colonial Office that signalled the governor's <b>tacit</b> <b>approval</b> of the abuses of the mining companies.
