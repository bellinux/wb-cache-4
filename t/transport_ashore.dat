The two ships were not used as aircraft carriers; instead they were equipped with helicopters and tasked with <b>transporting</b> <b>ashore</b> 45 Commando, a battalion of the Royal Marines, in order to secure harbours and other landing points for heavy equipment. This, the first ship-based helicopter assault, was successful, and prompted the development of the amphibious assault ship.|$|R

40|$|Calcareous oolites {{occur in}} beach and {{continental}} shelf sediments from Cape Canaveral, Florida, to {{as far south}} as Palm Beach. The abundance of oolites in both shelf and beach sediments is highly irregular. In beach sediments the oolites tend to be significantly more abundant in backshore deposits than in foreshore deposits. This abundance is believed to be due to selective sorting with the oolites responding to flow as heavier particles because of their shape and surface smoothness. The source of the oolites in the beach deposits appears to be the inner continental shelf. Because of their highly irregular distribution and sensitivity to selective sorting processes, it is concluded that quantitative estimates of the total amount of sediment <b>transported</b> <b>ashore</b> with the oolites cannot be made.

40|$|Ozone sondes {{launched}} from Trinidad Head, California provide {{a measure of}} background O 3 <b>transported</b> <b>ashore,</b> and allow {{an evaluation of the}} impact of this transport on air quality in California's Northern Sacramento Valley. A strong summertime vertical O 3 gradient and correlation analysis indicate that O 3 -rich air from above the marine boundary layer is transported to the surface. Surface O 3 increases proportionally to the transported background. At the surface site experiencing the highest O 3 concentrations, transported background O 3 accounts for more than half (11 ppbv) of the 20 ppbv difference in the mean maximum 8 -h average O 3 between exceedance and non-exceedance days. This finding contrasts with model calculations that indicate the US policy relevant O 3 background is generally 15 – 35 ppbv, and that it decreases during pollution episodes. The present work indicates that O 3 transported on hemispheric scales substantially impacts air quality in some areas of the US...|$|R
50|$|Washdyke Lagoon {{was created}} by the {{formation}} of a mixed sand and gravel (MSG) beach barrier (Figure 2) allowing fluvial water from Washdyke Creek to accumulate behind it, with some tidal infiltration through the barrier. The MSG barrier type is relatively rare and has its own unique set of processes and morphology. MSG barriers form mostly on paraglacial coasts where there is a large amount of coarse grained sediments available and storm wave conditions during which more sediment load is <b>transported</b> <b>ashore.</b> They also form steep slopes in high wave energy environments and have very high levels of seepage of freshwater into the ocean, due to the large grain size range increasing permeability. Another characteristic is the zonation of sediments on the barrier. Coarse, flat sediments form the crest, whilst large, spherical and rod shape sediments form the outer part and the barrier infill is made up of finer sediment sizes. Washdyke Lagoon is a useful example of a barrier that displays all of these characteristics.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Marine tar {{residues}} {{originate from}} natural and anthropogenic oil releases {{into the ocean}} environment and are formed after liquid petroleum is transformed by weathering, sedimentation, and other processes. Tar balls, tar mats, and tar patties are common examples of marine tar residues and can {{range in size from}} millimeters in diameter (tar balls) to several meters in length and width (tar mats). These residues can remain in the ocean envi-ronment indefinitely, decomposing or becoming buried in the sea floor. However, in many cases, they are <b>transported</b> <b>ashore</b> via currents and waves where they pose a concern to coastal recreation activities, the seafood industry and may have negative effects on wildlife. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge on marine tar residue formation, transport, degradation, and distribution. Methods of detection and removal of marine tar residues and their possible ecological effects are discussed, in addition to topics of marine tar research that warrant further investigation. Emphasis is placed on ben-thic tar residues, with a focus on the remnants of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in particular, which are still affecting the northern Gulf of Mexico shores years after the leaking submarine well was capped...|$|R

5000|$|In {{the waters}} of Deception Pass, {{just east of the}} present-day Deception Pass Bridge, is a small island known as Ben Ure Island.

Ben Ure and his partner Lawrence [...] "Pirate" [...] Kelly were quite profitable at their human smuggling business and played hide-and-seek with the United States Customs Department for years. Ure's own operation at Deception Pass in the late 1880s consisted of Ure and his Native-American wife. Local tradition has it that his wife would camp on the nearby Strawberry Island (which was visible from the open sea) and signal him with a fire on the island's summit to alert him to {{whether or not it was}} safe to attempt to bring the human cargo he illegally <b>transported</b> <b>ashore.</b> For <b>transport,</b> Ure would tie the people up in burlap bags so that if customs agents were to approach he could easily toss the people in bags overboard. The tidal currents would carry the entrapped drowned migrants' bodies to San Juan Island to the north and west of the pass and many ended up in what became known as Dead Man's Bay.|$|R
2500|$|Melbourne {{launched}} her boats {{almost immediately}} after the collision to recover survivors, and the carrier's wardroom and C Hangar were prepared for casualties. One cutter was able to rescue 40 people before beginning to take on water, while the admiral's barge was damaged by debris. Eight helicopters were also launched, but it was then deemed too dangerous to have so many active in such a small area, and they were limited to two at a time. Most of the sailors in the water were {{unable or unwilling to}} be rescued with the helicopters' winches, so the helicopters were reassigned to provide illumination of the site with their landing lights. At 21:58, Melbourne was informed that five minesweepers (HMA Ships , , , , and [...] ), two search-and-rescue (SAR) boats from [...] ( [...] and [...] ), and helicopters from Naval Air Station Nowra, had been dispatched. The destroyer escort [...] was also being prepared to sail. Arriving just before 22:00, Air Nymph collected 34 survivors and attempted to transfer them to Melbourne, but swells pushed the boat up under the carrier's flight deck and damaged two communications aerials, and the SAR boat was sent back to Creswell to offload the survivors. Another 36 were recovered by Air Sprite and <b>transported</b> <b>ashore.</b> Sea searches continued until 12 February, and aircraft made occasional passes over the area until 14 February, looking for bodies.|$|R

5000|$|The Marine Corps plan to {{modernize}} its amphibious invasion force has three parts: upgrade 390 AAVs; buy 600 troop transports {{as part of}} ACV Phase 1; and do research for an ACV 2.0 [...] "high-water-speed" [...] option. Upgrades to the AAV {{will be added to}} around 392 vehicles (carrying one Marine brigade) out of the fleet of 1,062, including [...] "limited survivability upgrades" [...] of blast-resistant seats, additional armor, and a new transmission. Having AAVs self-deploy directly from ships is quicker than loading vehicles onto a connector, but long-range anti-ship missiles will force future amphibious invasion forces to stay between 25 - 75 mi from shore. A high-speed connector can make that trip in 1-3 hours, while an AAV on water would take 15 hours to travel that distance. The Phase 1 ACV will be 200 modified versions of an existing U.S. or foreign armored vehicle to enter service around 2020. It will have limited amphibious capabilities to cross rivers and coastal inlets and be carried on a landing craft miles from shore, which will deploy it 5 mi from the shoreline to swim the rest of the way. Seaborne requirements are likely for operation in sea state 3, against modest winds and 2 ft-high waves, taking about one hour. ACV 1.1 will likely have a higher swim standard than the previous MPC. ACV 1.2 is to buy an additional 400 amphibious vehicles in multiple variants including troop transport, command, and fire support. A Phase 1 ACV that can self-deploy without a landing craft would have an advantage, but that capability is not a requirement. ACV 2.0 is research for a new amphibious vehicle, a new fast landing craft for the ACV 1, or some undecided alternative. Aside from wartime amphibious assaults, the Marine Corps has other needs for amphibious vehicles. In relief operations during the 2010 Haiti earthquake, there was not combat but ships could not dock in the country's damaged ports, and helicopter could not move the amount of cargo necessary, so AAVs were relied upon to <b>transport</b> supplies <b>ashore.</b>|$|R
