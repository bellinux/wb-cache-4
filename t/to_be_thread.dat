40|$|Precision Timed Architectures (PRET) are {{a recent}} {{proposal}} for designing processors for real-time embedded systems. These processors must guarantee precise worst case reaction time (WCRT) of applications without sacriﬁcing throughput, and must allow the WCRT of programs to be computed simply {{as well as}} eﬃciently. The ob jective {{of this paper is}} to propose a new synchronous language based on C, called PRET-C, for programming PRET machines. PRET-C supports synchronous concurrency, preemption, and a high-level construct for logical time. In contrast to existing synchronous languages, PRET-C oﬀers C-based shared memory communications between concurrent threads, that are guaranteed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>thread</b> safe via the proposed semantics. Preemption is also semantically simpler. Programmer can freely mix both logical time (though the notion of logical ticks) and physical time by controlling hardware timers thanks to C libraries. Mapping of logical time to physical time is achieved thanks to the WCRT analyzer and the associated compiler. We also propose the Auckland Reactive PRET processor (ARPRET) that customizes the Xilinx MicroBlaze processor, a general purpose processor (GPP).

This just reserves room for the final submission. Abstract—Support for light-weight concurrency in C is gaining recent momentum. Another area of research focus has been the development of code that guarantees precise worst case timing. We present a new language called Precision Timed C, for pre-dictable and lightweight multithreading in C. PRET-C supports synchronous concurrency, preemption, and a high-level construct for logical time. In contrast to existing synchronous languages, PRET-C offers C-based shared memory communications between concurrent threads that is guaranteed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>thread</b> safe via the proposed semantics. Mapping of logical time to physical time is achieved by a Worst Case Reaction Time (WCRT) analyzer.
