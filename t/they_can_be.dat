5|$|Although {{happy in}} the company of others, they are fine if left alone. Sealyham Terriers are suited for both the town and country. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> stubborn, vocal, and boisterous but also full of personality. While they make for loyal family companions, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> trained to be working dogs, making them {{excellent}} mousers or ratters. They can also be taught as a puppy to get along with other animals, including cats and birds.|$|E
5|$|Analog {{computers}} {{work directly}} with physical quantities, so their addition mechanisms {{depend on the}} form of the addends. A mechanical adder might represent two addends as the positions of sliding blocks, in which case <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> added with an averaging lever. If the addends are the rotation speeds of two shafts, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> added with a differential. A hydraulic adder can add the pressures in two chambers by exploiting Newton's second law to balance forces on an assembly of pistons. The most common situation for a general-purpose analog computer is to add two voltages (referenced to ground); this can be accomplished roughly with a resistor network, but a better design exploits an operational amplifier.|$|E

50|$|These quite {{uncommon}} sea snails live at {{depths of}} 0 to 80 m. In fact <b>they</b> commonly <b>can</b> <b>be</b> found in deeper waters, but <b>they</b> <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> found in shallow inshore waters.|$|R
5|$|Browncove Crags on {{the western}} side of the {{mountain}} has some north-facing routes. These are easier to access from a car park, and <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> linked with the Red Tarn routes.|$|E
5|$|Cabbages are {{prepared}} {{in many different}} ways for eating. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> pickled, fermented for dishes such as sauerkraut, steamed, stewed, saut√©ed, braised, or eaten raw. Cabbage is a good source of vitamin K, vitamin C and dietary fiber.|$|E
5|$|Few earwigs survive winter {{outdoors}} in cold climates. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> found in tight crevices in woodland, fields and gardens. Out of about 1,800 species, about 25 occur in North America, 45 in Europe (including 7 in Great Britain), and 60 in Australia.|$|E
50|$|<b>They</b> <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> {{classified}} on {{the basis}} of their number of phenol groups. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> therefore <b>be</b> called simple phenols or monophenols, with only one phenolic group, or di- (bi-), tri- and oligophenols, with two, three or several phenolic groups respectively.|$|R
50|$|<b>They</b> <b>can</b> often <b>be</b> found {{sheltering}} under rubble or vegetation, alongside other species, {{being happy}} {{to share a}} refuge with other larger geckos such as Afrogecko porphyreus (the marbled leaf-toed gecko). <b>They</b> <b>can</b> still <b>be</b> found in suburban gardens in Cape Town.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} methods <b>can</b> <b>be</b> {{used for}} translating an arbitrary constraint satisfaction problem, either binary or otherwise. Since <b>they</b> <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> used on binary problems, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> {{used on the}} result of making constraints binary, either by translating to the dual problem or by using hidden variables.|$|R
5|$|Injection {{moulding}} is {{a complex}} technology with possible production problems. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> caused either by defects in the moulds, or more often by the moulding process itself.|$|E
5|$|Most nests are in trees, both {{deciduous}} and coniferous. Sometimes, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> {{found in}} shrubs, vines, or on artificial constructs like buildings, or hanging flower pots. When {{there is no}} suitable elevated object, mourning doves will nest on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Routine care {{during the}} growing season {{involves}} keeping the rows free of competing weeds, especially when the plants are young. The plants are shallow-rooted and do not need a great deal of water when established. Bulbing usually takes place after 12 to 18 weeks. The bulbs can be gathered when needed to eat fresh, but if they will be kept in storage, they should be harvested after the leaves have died back naturally. In dry weather, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> left {{on the surface of the}} soil for a few days to dry out properly, then <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> placed in nets, roped into strings, or laid in layers in shallow boxes. They should be stored in a well-ventilated, cool place such as a shed.|$|E
50|$|Their archenemies are the githyanki and the githzerai, {{descendants}} of the rebellious slaves who destroyed their empire millennia ago. Hunting and slaying illithids whenever <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>is</b> {{an integral part of}} their cultures.|$|R

5|$|Services <b>are</b> perishable; <b>they</b> <b>can</b> not <b>be</b> inventoried.|$|R
5|$|Shells {{are used}} decoratively in many ways. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> pressed into {{concrete}} or plaster to make decorative paths, steps or walls {{and can be}} used to embellish picture frames, mirrors or other craft items. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> stacked up and glued together to make ornaments. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> pierced and threaded onto necklaces or made into other forms of jewellery. Shells have had various uses in the past as body decorations, utensils, scrapers and cutting implements. Carefully cut and shaped shell tools dating back 32,000 years have been found in a cave in Indonesia. In this region, shell technology may have been developed in preference to the use of stone or bone implements, perhaps because of the scarcity of suitable rock materials.|$|E
5|$|The Parson is {{a feisty}} and {{energetic}} type of Terrier. They can excel in dog {{sports such as}} flyball or agility and require vigorous exercise {{in order to prevent}} them from becoming bored and potentially destructive in the home. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> suited to live with children but as they have a typical Terrier temperament, they will not tolerate rough handling. The AKC describes them as being single minded, tenacious and courageous when at work, while at home <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> exuberant, playful and affectionate. However, it is unusual for dogs of this breed to be involved in work, such as fox hunting, typical of a small white terrier, as they are more adapted to the show bench.|$|E
5|$|The Saw Mill's basin {{is part of}} the Manhattan Hills in the New England Uplands physiographic region. It is {{primarily}} underlain by metamorphic rock such as gneiss, schist and marble. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> seen in some bedrock outcrops in and around the river.|$|E
50|$|<b>They</b> <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> {{found in}} leaf litter.|$|R
50|$|<b>They</b> <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> seen in atrial myxomas.|$|R
50|$|<b>They</b> <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> {{associated}} with a TRE17/USP6 translocation.|$|R
5|$|The extant Alligatoridae are {{two species}} in the genus Alligator, and six species of caimans grouped into three genera. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> {{recognised}} by the broad snout, in which the fourth tooth of the lower jaw cannot be seen when the mouth is closed.|$|E
5|$|The pointed tips of ZnO {{nanorods}} {{result in}} a strong enhancement of an electric field. Therefore, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> used as field emitters.|$|E
5|$|The pool is {{also open}} to motel guests, and, {{in spite of}} signs warning {{swimmers}} that <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> viewed from the bar while swimming, people {{have been known to}} skinny dip.|$|E
50|$|<b>They</b> <b>can</b> usually <b>be</b> {{bought for}} less than US$10.|$|R

50|$|White: Non-Aggression Pact (NAP). <b>They</b> <b>can</b> not <b>be</b> attacked, either.|$|R
5|$|<b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> {{very useful}} in {{intensive}} care to sedate patients receiving mechanical ventilation or those in extreme distress. Caution is exercised in this situation due to the occasional occurrence of respiratory depression, and {{it is recommended that}} benzodiazepine overdose treatment facilities should be available.|$|E
5|$|A {{large number}} of strains {{belonging}} to this species have been isolated and characterised. In addition to serotype (vide supra), <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> classified according to their phylogeny, i.e. the inferred evolutionary history, as shown below where the species is divided into six groups. Particularly the use of whole genome sequences yields highly supported phylogenies. Based on such data, five subspecies of E. coli were distinguished.|$|E
5|$|After protein {{amino acid}} {{sequences}} have been translated from nucleic acid chains, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> edited by appropriate enzymes. Although {{this is a}} form of protein affecting protein sequence, not explicitly covered by the central dogma, there are not many clear examples where the associated concepts of the two fields {{have much to do with}} each other.|$|E
50|$|A non-achromatic {{objective}} is {{an objective lens}} which is not corrected for chromatic aberration. In telescopes <b>they</b> <b>can</b> a <b>be</b> pre-18th century simple single element objective lenses which were used before the invention of doublet achromatic lenses. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> specialty monochromatic lenses used in modern research telescopes and other instruments.|$|R
60|$|What is wrong, then? Whatever {{is unlike}} right; {{whatever}} is unlike goodness; whatever is unlike God; that is wrong. And why does God forbid {{us to do}} wrong? Simply because wrong is unlike himself. He is perfectly beautiful, perfectly blest and happy, because he is perfectly good; and he wishes to see all his creatures beautiful, blest, and happy: but <b>they</b> <b>can</b> only <b>be</b> so by being perfectly good; and <b>they</b> <b>can</b> only <b>be</b> perfectly good by being perfectly like God their Father; and <b>they</b> <b>can</b> only <b>be</b> perfectly like God the Father by being full of love, loving their neighbour as themselves.|$|R
50|$|Yellow: Forgotten bases. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> always <b>be</b> attacked, and, {{in some of}} {{the newer}} worlds, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> attack you.|$|R
