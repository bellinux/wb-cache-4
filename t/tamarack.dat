50|$|By {{historic}} times Volo Bog {{was deep}} into the process of plant succession.

60|$|At {{the end of}} {{the fifth}} week of their stay in Tyre a {{suspicion}} of spring was in the wind as it swept the southern exposure of the valley.

Patches of green grass, appearing on the sunny side of the road where the snow had melted, led to predictions of spring from the loafers beginning to sun themselves on the salt-barrels and shoe-boxes outside the stores.|$|R
5|$|He again {{excelled in}} {{basketball}} his senior year, leading {{his team to}} the Queens divisional championship and amassing more points than any other New York City high school basketball player.

Soon afterward, he received an offer from the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts about forty miles (64 kilometers) west of Boston. He was impressed by the school, and accepted the basketball scholarship it offered him. He spent the summer before matriculating working at <b>Tamarack</b> Lodge in the Catskill Mountains and playing in a local basketball league along with a number of established college players.|$|E

25|$|The creek's name is {{from the}} founder of the first {{settlement}} in the Stillwater area, Joseph R. Brown, where Brown's Creek (then Pine Creek) flows into the St. Croix River. In 1840 Brown, a former soldier, Indian trader, promoter, and Justice of the Peace set up a small warehouse at the head of Lake St. Croix to supply his upriver fur trading operations. This warehouse, in what is now the north part of Stillwater, became the county seat of St. Croix County, Wisconsin Territory. Brown began building a courthouse and jail and importing settlers for his new village, which he named Dacotah. Several of Brown’s relatives, including his half-sister Lydia Ann and her husband, Paul Carli, moved into a house built of <b>tamarack</b> logs. The <b>Tamarack</b> House, well known as “Mrs. Carli’s,” became a favorite stopping place for travelers on the St. Croix River. However, few other settlers arrived in Dacotah until a mill was built to the south in what became Stillwater.|$|E
