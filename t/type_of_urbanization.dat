As a result, the government now requires a new <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>urbanization,</b> with simultaneous development of high-quality rural areas. Improving the economic, social and environmental influence of urban development on rural areas helps to improve urbanization and make rural areas more sustainable. This article focuses on a particular question: Have urban wastewater emissions affected the efficiency of agricultural water use?

The effect is shown to be prominent, irrespective of whether the urbanization ratio is high or low. This effect is most significant when the urbanization ratio is highest or when society pays more attention to urban environmental governance. The influence has regional heterogeneity and is also affected by various other policy settings. The results provide helpful guidance for cities as they focus on rural impacts as part of the new <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>urbanization</b> policies.|$|E

Wide variations of level of incidence over areas mean that to be efficient the control strategy needs the delineation of risk areas. Classical entomological indices are used by public health authorities to launch local vector control activities but their reliability to identify areas with higher incidence and to reduce it, is limited. In the frame of a WHO-TDR program to develop new entomological indices based on pupae counts, an exhaustive survey of potential breeding sites has been untertaken in areas with different types of urbanization in Thailand.

40|$|China’s {{urbanization}} and industrialization are occupying farmland {{in large}} amounts, which is strongly driven by land finance regime. This {{is due to}} the intensified regional/local competition for manufacturing investment opportunities that push local governments to expropriate farmland at low prices while lease land at high market value to property developers. The additional revenue obtained in this way, termed financial increment in land values, can drive local economic growth, and provide associated infrastructure and other public services. At the same time, however, a floating population of large numbers of inadequately compensated land-lost farmers, although unable to become citizens, have to migrate into the urban areas for work, causing overheated employment and housing markets, with rocketing unaffordable housing prices. This, together with various micro factors relating to the party/state’s promotion/evaluation system play an essential role leading to some serious economic, environment and social consequences, e. g., on migrant welfare, the displacement of peasants and the loss of land resources that requires immediate attention.

40|$|The {{intersection}} {{of human activity}} and water quality is {{a major focus of}} aquatic research, as we try to understand and then minimize the impacts of land-use change on this precious resource. However, the contribution of specific infrastructures and social behaviors are not usually considered, with very diverse landscapes being lumped under a generic label of “urban”, because of the complexity in categorizing the degree or <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>urbanization.</b> This lack of nuance is compounded by limited datasets collected at low spatial and/or temporal resolutions. As part of the iUTAH EPSCoR project, we collected water quality data across elevation and land-use gradients in three Wasatch watersheds—Logan, Red Butte, and Provo. These watersheds represent different stages of transitioning from agricultural to urban land-use. This provides us a unique opportunity to analyze correlations between these water quality values and specific factors of urbanization. We are modeling three water quality variables (E. coli, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus) collected monthly over the three iUTAH watersheds at 66 sites for one year. We calculated land-use statistics for subwatersheds delineated for each site using 10 -m DEM data. Land use and climate variables being compared for their predictive capacity include land cover, water related land use, elevation, typology (Jackson-Smith et al. 2015), miles of road, impervious surface, number of storm drain outfalls, socio-economic status, season, and antecedent precipitation. From this data we will build models for each water quality in each watershed to compare how each land use variable affects each aspect of water quality and which land use variables are significant for each watershed. Preliminary results suggest that precipitation, which is usually highly correlated with E. coli in urban watersheds, did not predict E. coli in any land use type or season...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} {{the impacts of}} different factors of agglomeration on types and sizes of cities and presents {{a model of a}} system of cities in a spatial economy. Differences in types and sizes of cities have been partly attributed to the degree of scale economies due to agglomeration. However, the impacts of industrial structure and interaction between related industries within the city as a major factor of agglomeration has not been analyzed. ^ The first objective of this thesis is to extend and modify the existing theory of city size by explicitly incorporating industrial interaction along with scale economies in an equilibrium and optimum land use model. In one of the cities within the system gross product technological externalities, a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>urbanization</b> economies, are the dominant force. Localization economies are the dominant force in the other city. The equilibrium model presents an explanation for urban hierarchies in a spatial economy. ^ The second objective of this thesis is to fill the gap between the two extreme cases of market structure, monopolistic and perfectly competitive, as well as to present the important role of the service sector in the formation of cities. Within the framework of a model of product differentiation and monopolistic competition, the impact of the interaction between a monopolistic competitive service sector and a perfect competitive traded good sector in a city is analyzed. ^ The third objective in this thesis is to present an integrated approach to the formation of cities. It is shown that in a system of two cities with no trade, at equilibrium, all workers may not concentrate in the city with more product variety. Finally, a new explanation is provided for the structure of a system of cities where the interactions between cities are explicitly taken into consideration, as well as the determination of an equilibrium number of cities.

40|$|The {{problem of}} urban sprawl {{challenges}} {{the management of}} built-up areas for some decades. Increased population growth following the Second World War, coupled with the growing preference for, and emphasis on, single-family dwellings, were seen to "justify" this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>urbanization.</b> However, {{in addition to the}} environmental consequences of urban sprawl (including the destruction of valuable agricultural land), urban sprawl has also entailed costs in terms of urban infrastructure, as has been suggested in several studies. One noticeable gap in the literature, however, concerns school infrastructure. This research aims to fill that gap by analyzing the effects of urban sprawl on the supply of, and demand for, educational services at the primary and secondary school levels in the Montreal area, through a case study. Due to their relevance and direct link to urbanization, three variables (through ten indicators) have been selected to measure this phenomenon. The school demography, symbolizing the demand for educational services, was selected because of its essential role in justifying the supply of such services. Educational buildings (i. e., schools) and grounds represent the supply of educational services. These three measures, to which the school transportation has been joined, are explored in this study from the late 1970 s to the 1990 s to reveal the diverse degrees by which urban sprawl produces additional costs in the supply of educational services. It has been demonstrated that following the dispersion of the population in space, the demand for educational services in older sections of the city is negative, while it is positive in the more recently established suburban neighbourhoods. Consequently, the supply of educational services exceeds the demand in central localities but is deficient in the suburbs, a situation that requires a reduction in educational facilities in the center, and a significant increase in student-spaces at the periphery. The costs of immobilization respond to the characteristic pattern of urban sprawl, and are proportional to the distance from the city center. Situated at the junction of urban geography and the geography of services, the present study touches on an aspect of the management of space in the Montreal metropolitan region. The costs of urban sprawl in the network of educational services reflect the absence of consultation and collaboration between municipalities and school boards. Those responsible for infrastructure planning and urban planning are themselves {{at the mercy of the}} population. The individual short- and medium-term residential needs, often revolved around the availability of inexpensive land for development and adequate financing, are rarely confronted to the long-term collective costs of this type of urban development. The autonomy of municipalities and of school boards, the differences in their respective missions, and the lack of consistency in their own territories, contribute greatly to the absence of coordination and collaboration with respect to the planning of educational facilities. Such an absence, associated with the declining birth rates and, moreover related as well to the growing popularity of secondary residences, has encouraged urban development beyond existing urban borders, with a consequent increase in the costs of educational services...|$|E
40|$|The {{proliferation}} and apparent intransience of urban squatter settlements in Third World countries have produced numerous explanations of their cause, nature and solution. In Fiji, {{it is estimated}} that nearly one-fifth {{of the population of the}} Suva Urban Area were squatters in 1976 and that squatter numbers, in recent years, have increased by over 10 percent annually. These increases have occurred despite development plan objectives which aim to reduce regional and class disparities and a public housing programme which has housed about one-fifth of the urban area's population since the late 1950 s. In the early 1960 s many scholars supported the view that squatters were 'marginal' to the life of the city and this view is still held by many administrators, in Fiji and elsewhere. Studies commencing in the mid 1960 s, however, have led to a revision of opinions on squatter marginality and the emergence of two major schools of thought among scholars. The Dependency School considers squatting a product of the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>urbanization</b> experienced by Third World countries and sees no solution short of major changes to the 'system'; the Progressive Development (or Progressive Housing) School, on the other hand, sees squatting as a housing problem caused by the rate of Third World urbanization and inappropriate public housing programmes. The latter School advocates the encouragement of self-help activities among the poor to close the gap between housing supply and demand. The public housing programme in Fiji has been influenced by such arguments and during recent years there has been some official support for site and service, squatter upgrading and core housing schemes. The present work proceeds from a statement of major theoretical questions derived from the literature, and a description of urbanization and the housing situation in Fiji, to test the assumptions of the Marginality, Dependency and Progressive Development Schools. Data were obtained on urbanization and housing in Fiji, and sample surveys were conducted among Fijian and Indian squatters and other low-income households in Suva City and Urban Area in 1976. The data were used to consider six propositions which were tested via 36 hypotheses; comparisons were made between ethnic, squatter and other low-income, and city and urban area households. The propositions were found to be substantially correct. Squatter behaviour was shown to be as modern and as urban as the behaviour of other low-income people, and households with 'modern' attributes tended to be more 'successful' in the city. Modern and traditional behaviour, however, were not found to be antithetical and, at least among Fijians, the households which were the most traditional tended to be those which were most 'successful. ' Squatters were also shown to make a positive contribution to the economy of the city and to be no more an obstacle to rational urban land use than many other land users. The views of the Marginality School were therefore found wanting. Squatters were shown to participate in self-help activities which led to increasing adequacy in housing. The squatter residential environment was found to permit greater all round flexibility than official public housing and was therefore considered more appropriate for poor households which relied heavily on the use of the residential environment for supplementary informal economic activities and kinship networks. In particular, squatting was found to allow Fijians and Indians to adopt strategies of survival and improvement based on their respective cultural mores. Some support was therefore provided for the views of the Progressive Development School. The levels of improvement, however, were found to be generally insufficient and to involve too few households to accept these views without reservation. Improvements occurred among more modern households, among owner-occupiers and those with some security uf tenure as claimed by the Progressive Development School, but income was found to be the most critical variable. Income increased among Fijians by accretions of kin and among Indians by accretions of time, but few households had sufficient income to permit them to alter significantly their position in society or to ensure minimally adequate housing. The views of the Dependency School that squatting is a residential manifestation of poverty, and not a housing problem as such, were therefore accepted. In accepting this explanation of the causes and nature of squatting, however, the writer maintained that practical measures advanced by the Progressive Development School could lead, if not to the solution of the problem, at least to its improvement. At the macro level, the solution to the urban squatter question in Fiji was seen to lie in the implementation of the egalitarian proposals of the VIth Development Plan, a change in Fiji's relations with other countries, and a reassessment of the position of the urban poor. At the micro level, much improvement can be achieved by the formulation of a housing policy which gives close attention to the needs and aspirations of squatters indicated in the present study. The distinction between macro and micro level 'solutions' is seen to offer a compromise position between the viewpoints of the two most prominent schools of thought on the urban squatter question...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper will}} discuss the {{structural}} role of forests in territories that are distinctively different than the compact city, often called the territory of dispersion. Dispersion and its design interventions are often associated with the American suburbia developed in postwar period 1 while in fact there are several types of dispersion with different economic origin. In Europe, {{the first wave of}} suburbanization goes back to Middle Ages, e. g. in Belgium, where the fertile grounds of the lower river plains allowed for food production in any location of the territory. It led to a wide spread network of productive entities and formed the base of current large-scale dispersion pattern. This type of dispersion can often be found in fertile river deltas. The second wave of suburbanization, relating to a new wave of investments, relates to the industrial revolution. The improving mining technologies lead to a mushroom explosion of mining pits and derivate industries spread over the coal resource area. This created a lot of new employment with strongly increasing populations as a result. Since most of the infrastructural investment went into the delivery and extraction of goods, new urban developments were mostly settled close to the industry in specific typological neighborhoods. Only after the Second World War did the dream of ‘the house with a garden’ becomes the dominant suburban contribution. When we look at the European map and turn on urban tissue and forest structures a clear contradiction can be noticed: the dispersion, tissue known for its strong relation with open space, it is also the space where forests are least present. (Fig. 1 Corine land-use Europe, layers urban tissue and forest) So, is forest not appreciated as open space or a quality for sprawl? In any case there exists a paradox. The suburbanization processes - the search for a close relation with the greener countryside regardless of the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>urbanization</b> wave and timeframe - resulted in a high rate of forest disappearance. At the same time we notice that many tissues today are located close or around forest structures that do not necessarily appear as forest on traditional mapping documents. The Lisbon-Porto urban territory is a form of dispersion related to the fertile Tejo-Douro low lying grounds that contain a set of rivers reaching the Portuguese coastline and more recently because of the Lisbon-Porto economical and administrative relation. This piece of urbanization houses about three quarters of the Portuguese population. Contrary to other territories of dispersion, here forests are abundantly present in a varied set of types: protected forestscapes in national parks, artificially created and maintained forests for production purposes, high ridge forests, dune forests… A very diverse interplay of forested areas seems to exist (Fig. 2 Portugal: river system, Corine land-use map and population density), but its structural capacity for urban development remains unproven. The time is right to address this relation between forests and the urban condition, analyze it and to take it as the departure point and actively stimulate and intensify their sustainable collaboration. In recent months the governmental policies regarding forests and production has been changing without a proper effect analysis. This change should be seen as the opportunity to redefine the relation between forest and urbanization and how they influence each other, not only from a spatial point of view 2, but also from benchmarks of sustainability and even for compensating Troika budget cuts with increasing inland production while decreasing import necessities. 3 This concept of forest urbanism is not only based on an unproven reading of the territory, but was born from the increasing ecological awareness {{since the turn of the}} century. If we can look beyond the forest as a static land-use zone, it can become truly structural. On one side it deals with the contemporary sustainable demands. A forest contains the largest contributions to biodiversity and forms the lungs of the world with caption and storage of CO 2 and the production of oxygen. Forested zones improve rainfall infiltration while safeguarding the quality of the water winning aquifers. Distinct locations lead to different types of forest that each contributes to a production life cycle. 4 On the other side it creates a specific typological architecture. There has always been a kind of romantic view on and mysticism revolving around living in the forest. As if it was a special privilege. 5 The largest adversary of the forest is time. Public instances are mainly concerned with safeguarding the existing forest stock. They do expand when possible, but mostly the efforts are marginal. Private land owners are encouraged to create forest through subsidies, but the productivity of a forest (as an alternative to agriculture) and equal money return is too slow. Only the landscape altering fast-growing exotic eucalyptus seems to be able to convince the private entrepreneur, not counting the very few enlightened souls that plant for the next generation. We believe that a new mixture of these elements into a new dynamic more open structured approach as opposition to the static policies today could lead to the sustainable transformation and improvement of this territory of dispersion. This paper intends to give a first contribution to a new kind of urban transformation in the Lisbon – Porto region through the concept of forest urbanism.

40|$|When {{standing}} among urban villages, residential {{towers and}} warehouses in an urbanizing {{city in the}} Pearl River delta (PRD), {{it is hard to}} imagine that just forty years ago this area was filled with streams, ponds and rice paddies. Since the Reform in 1978, the PRD metropolitan area, with the name as "World Factory", has been a pilot in urbanization together with millions of migrant labors rushed into the industries. Hydrological system accompanied with corridors for species is disrupted, fragmented and polluted when big infrastructures, industries and neighborhoods are planned without considering natural system. Storm water runoff causes flooding in the cities every year, and at the same time, extreme weather events linked to climate change and sea level rise threatens urban life and property in the future. This thesis proposes hydrological urbanism which not only can solve problems of flooding and water pollution, but also provides continuous corridors for species and recreational parks for citizens. In hydrological urbanism, water is given more room to meander and this room can catch more water runoff when it is flooding. Phytoremediation cleans the water from upper streams and swells into a wetland buffer between big infrastructures and neighborhood. Water behaves as the park to shape the neighborhood and recreational space for public access. The thesis investigates PRD through urban and hydrological analysis on different scales. With the example of Lijiao in Guangzhou (the capital city in PRD), this thesis asserts a hydrological urbanism prototype between the highway infrastructure and existing water system. An overall plan identifies similar <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>urbanization</b> which may possibly happen on the whole PRD system. The case of Lijiao can be transformed and generalized in these similar locations. Not only is for today's redevelopment, the hydrological urbanism is also changeable for future climate changes. by Wenji Ma. Thesis: S.
