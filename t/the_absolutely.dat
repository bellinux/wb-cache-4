Its nurseries attract people from far and wide for <b>the</b> <b>absolutely</b> stunning collection of cacti they cultivate. The strains of cacti, though not indigenous to the locale, have been carefully cultivated over the years, and now the town boasts {{one of the most}} fascinating and exhaustive collections of the Cactaceae family. The plants have adapted well to the altitude and environment, and now prove {{to be one of the}} chief draws of tourism to the township.|$|E

Furthermore, free land was offered to those who wanted to immigrate to the two islands on the condition that they swear loyalty to the Spanish Crown and allegiance to the Roman Catholic Church.|$|E
25|$|Xenocrates {{recognized}} three {{grades of}} cognition, each appropriated to {{a region of}} its own: knowledge, sensation, and opinion. He referred knowledge (episteme) to that essence which {{is the object of}} pure thought, and is not included in the phenomenal world; sensation (aisthesis) to that which passes into the world of phenomena; opinion (doxa) to that essence which is at once the object of sensuous perception, and, mathematically, of pure reason - the essence of heaven or the stars; so that he conceived of doxa in a higher sense, and endeavoured, more definitely than Plato, to exhibit mathematics as mediating between knowledge and sensuous perception. All three modes of apprehension partake of truth; but in what manner scientific perception (epistemonike aisthesis) did so, we unfortunately do not learn. Even here Xenocrates's preference for symbolic modes of sensualising or denoting appears: he connected the above three stages of knowledge with the three Fates: Atropos, Clotho, and Lachesis. We know nothing further about the mode in which Xenocrates carried out his dialectic, as it is probable that what was peculiar to Aristotelian logic did not remain unnoticed in it, for it can hardly be doubted that the division of the existent into <b>the</b> <b>absolutely</b> existent, and the relatively existent, attributed to Xenocrates, was opposed to the Aristotelian table of categories.|$|E

500|$|Frequent {{themes in}} Madness' songs {{included}} childhood memories (e.g., [...] "Baggy Trousers", and [...] "Our House") and petty crime (e.g., [...] "Shut Up", and [...] "Deceives the Eye"). Although Madness were {{seen by some}} as somewhat of a humorous band with catchy, bouncy songs, many of their songs took a darker tone (such as the singles [...] "Grey Day" [...] and [...] "Tomorrow's (Just Another Day)") and they sometimes tackled what were, at the time, controversial issues in their lyrics. [...] "Embarrassment" [...] (from <b>the</b> <b>Absolutely</b> album) was written by Lee Thompson, and reflected the unfolding turmoil following the news that his teenage sister had become pregnant and was carrying a black man's child. Madness discussed animal testing in the song [...] "Tomorrow's Dream". The band criticised the National Health Service in [...] "Mrs. Hutchinson", which {{told the story of}} a woman who, after several misdiagnoses and mistreatment, became terminally ill. The story was based on the experiences of Mike Barson's mother. Madness' final single prior to disbanding, [...] "(Waiting For) The Ghost Train", commented on apartheid in South Africa.|$|E

He further commended the way Beyoncé half-raps [...] "with a delicious snarl" [...] {{in the first part}} of the song. Many critics, including Una Mullalay of The Irish Times and Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune welcomed Beyoncé's rapping on [...] "Partition" [...] and compared it to the work of British recording artist M.I.A. Andrew Barker of Variety magazine highlighted that among the songs that discuss sexuality on Beyoncé, [...] "none hold a candle to <b>the</b> <b>absolutely</b> scorching 'Partition'". He also praised how Beyoncé [...] "toss off a few old-school battle rhymes" [...] with the line, [...] "I sneezed on the beat, and the beat got sicker", being a standout. Similarly, Miles Marshall Lewis of Ebony magazine noted that lines like, [...] "I sneezed on the beat and the beat got sicker / Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor", would make listeners smile. He praised how Beyoncé [...] "spills lyrics ... in a confident flow" [...] and concluded, [...] "As a singing rapper, she's still way more precious than ferocious." ...|$|E
500|$|In chapter five, Lucas, Duster and Kumatora {{recover the}} egg, and meet a Masked Man. In chapter 6 Lucas meets {{the ghost of}} his dead mother Hinawa in a {{sunflower}} field. Lucas tries to jump out to her but falls into a stack of hay in Tazmily. In chapter seven, separated from Duster and Kumatora, Lucas and his dog, Boney, learn about the seven Needles kept by seven Magypsies that quell a sleeping dragon underneath the earth. A prophecy foretold that a [...] "chosen one" [...] would come to pull the Needles and wake the dragon and determine {{the fate of the}} world. Racing the Masked Man in search of these Needles, Lucas battles through a laboratory of chimeras, reunites with Kumatora and Duster, and meets Mr. Saturn. In chapter eight, Pig King Master Porky, who returned from Mother 2, invites Lucas and his cohorts to New Pork City, where Tazmily residents have relocated. Lucas learns that the islands are protected by the dragon, that the egg contains the destructive mindsets of the outside world, that Porky is after the needles and its subsequent power, and that both Porky's Masked Man and Lucas have each pulled three of the seven Needles. Lucas and his cohorts fight Porky, and are able to defeat him. However, to protect himself, Porky seals himself within his absolutely safe capsule, which Lucas and his friends can not harm. However, Porky himself can not harm them, and is revealed to be unable to ever leave the capsule. Later, Lucas reunites with Flint. As they prepare to pull the final Needle, Lucas's party is hurt by the Masked Man, who is revealed as Claus, and immediately engages them in battle. Hinawa's spirit attempts to talk to Claus, while Flint badly injures himself to protect Lucas. The fight continues until Claus, now having regained his sense of self, tragically commits suicide by deliberately reflecting one of his attacks off Lucas' Franklin Badge. Lucas pulls the final Needle, awakening the Dragon and destroying the Nowhere Islands. In an epilogue set in darkness, the game's cast reveals that they have survived (although Porky is still trapped inside <b>the</b> <b>Absolutely</b> Safe Capsule); the world has been rebuilt without Porky's influence. In the final frame, the Mother 3 logo is shown without its metal, as restored to nature.|$|E
