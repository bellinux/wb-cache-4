While shipbuilding and river shipping finally faded as an industry when the railroad, now part of the New York Central, was fully established, quarrying continued.

25|$|Originally named Sting, Pickle {{was built}} in 1799 in Bermuda, where this type of vessel {{was known as a}} Bermuda sloop. Vice-Admiral Lord Hugh Seymour, the {{commander}} in chief on the Jamaica Station, formally purchased Sting in December 1800 for £2,500, after having leased her for some time at £10 per day. His purchase was in defiance of orders not to purchase vessels. However, faced with a fait accompli, the Admiralty issued an order in February 1801 that her name be changed <b>to</b> <b>Pickle.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In 1869, {{a passage}} was dug through the London Clay [...] under the Thames from Great Tower Hill <b>to</b> <b>Pickle</b> Herring Stairs near Vine Street (now Vine Lane). A {{circular}} [...] tunnel was dug , using a wrought iron shield, {{a method that}} had been patented in 1864 by Peter William Barlow. A railway was laid in the tunnel and from August 1870 a wooden carriage conveyed passengers {{from one side to}} the other. This was uneconomic and the company went bankrupt by the end of the year and the tunnel was converted to pedestrian use, becoming known as the Tower Subway. Construction of the City and South London Railway (C) was started in 1886 by James Henry Greathead using a development of Barlow's shield. Two [...] circular tunnels were dug between King William Street (close to today's Monument station) and Elephant and Castle. [...] From Elephant and Castle, the tunnels were a slightly larger [...] to Stockwell. This was a legacy of the original intention to haul the trains by cable. The tunnels were bored under the roads to avoid the need for agreement with owners of property on the surface. The original intention to cable-haul the trains changed to electric power when the cable company went bankrupt. A conductor rail energised with +500volts DC conductor rail for the northbound tunnel and −500volts for the southbound laid between the running rails, though offset from the centreline, powered the electric locomotives that hauled the carriages. [...] The carriages were fitted with small windows and consequently were nicknamed padded cells. By 1907, the C had extended from both ends, south to Clapham Common and north to Euston.|$|E

She carried a pail to put it in, and a table-knife in her hand to dig the plants up by the roots, and she also had an old sack in which she put every dry stick and chip of wood she came across. She added that she had gathered samphire at this same spot every August end for very many years.|$|E

[...] All that would now be changed. He would command his wife and daughters <b>to</b> <b>pickle</b> peaches--a cask-full, or two or three if one would not be enough. He would provide vinegar--many gallons of it, and cloves by the handful. And when they had got their pickled peaches he would have cold mutton for supper every day all the year round, and enjoy his life as he had never done before! ...|$|E

Truly, they said, {{that they would not be}} so kind to him as <b>to</b> <b>pickle</b> him: for though pickling, that is to say, throwing salt and vinegar on the back after the whipping, is cruel enough as to the pain it is to the patient, yet it is certainly the way to prevent mortification, and causes it to heal again with more ease.|$|E

Mr. Carlyle had never lived in the Courts of Europe about 1753; none the less, he fancied he knew more of them, and of their secrets, than did their actual inhabitants, kings, courtiers, and diplomatists. We saw that, in September 1752, {{according}} <b>to</b> <b>Pickle,</b> Prince Charles sent Archibald Cameron and Lochgarry to Scotland, with a mission to his representative, Cluny Macpherson, and the clans. The English Government, knowing this and a great deal more through Pickle, hanged Cameron, in June 1753, on no new charge, but on the old crime of being out in the Forty-five. Sir Walter Scott was well aware of the circumstances. We have already quoted his remark. 'The ministers thought it prudent to leave Dr. Cameron's new schemes in concealment, lest by divulging them they had indicated the channel of communication which, it is well known, they possessed to all the plots of Charles Edward.' ...|$|E

Pickle, {{since he}} has been in England, {{generally}} heard of the Young Pretender by Lochgary who requested him by directions from the Young Pretender, to make the last trip that he went upon to France, the intent of which was to communicate <b>to</b> <b>Pickle</b> the scheme that he [Lochgarry] and Dr. Cameron had concerted in the Highlands, and to offer him some arms to be landed at different times upon any part of his estate that he should appoint, but which Pickle absolutely refus'd to consent to, as he might be ruind by a discovery, and which could hardly be avoided, as the country was so full of Troops, and NOBODY AS YET KNOWING IN WHAT MANNER THE FORFEITED ESTATES WOULD BE SETTLED;--Pickle believes that some friends of P. Charles of Lorraine in Hainault, often harbour the Young Pretender, and favor him in his rambles;--that at the Court of France, Monsr. D'Argenson {219} is his chief friend in the Ministry, that Monsr. Puysieux was his enemy, as was also Monsr. St. Contest, who is a creature of Puysieux. Pickle looks upon the Duke of Richlieu, and all that are related to the family of Lorraine, to be friends of the Pretender's that Monsr. Paris Montmartell is the Pretender's great friend, and told Pickle he would contrive to raise 200,000l. for his Service, upon a proper occasion. Pickle was told by the Pretender himself, that Madame Pompadour was not his friend, for that she had been gaind over by considerable sums of money from England, and had taken offence at him, for his slighting two Billetts that had been sent by her to him, which he had done for fear of giving umbrage to the Queen of France and her relations; as to the French King, Pickle has had no opportunity of knowing much of his disposition, but does not look upon him as a well wisher to the Pretender's Cause, unless it be at any time to serve his own purpose.|$|E
60|$|If Charles {{afterwards}} {{attempted to}} repay in kind the attentions of his royal cousins, or of their ministers, this {{can hardly be}} reckoned inhuman. If he was fluttering the Courts, they--Prussia, Russia, France, Poland--were leading him {{the life of a}} tracked beast. They were determined to drive him into the Papal domains; even in Venice he was harried by spies. {63} On May 30, to retrace our steps, Mann, from Florence, reports that Charles has arrived at the Papal Nuncio's in Venice, attended by one servant in the livery of the Duke of Modena. Walton adds that he has not a penny (June 6). Walton (July 11) writes from Florence that the Prince is reported from Venice to have paid assiduous court to the second daughter of the Duke of Modena, a needy potentate, but that he suddenly disappeared.' {64} On Sept. 5, 1749, Walton says he is in France. On Sept. 26, Walton writes that he is offering his sword to the Czarina, who declines. He is at Lubeck, or (Oct. 3) at Avignon. On Oct. 20, Mann writes that, from Lubeck, Charles has asked the Imperial ambassador at Paris to implore the Kaiser to give him an asylum in his States. On Oct. 31, Mann only knows that the Pope and James 'reciprocally ask each other news about' the Prince. On Jan. 23, 1750, poor Mann is 'quite at a loss.' James receives letters from the Prince, but never with date of place, otherwise Mann would have been better informed. Walton hears that James believes Charles to be imprisoned in a French fortress. From Paris, Jan. 17, 1750, Albemarle wrote that he heard the Prince was in Berlin. The Prince later told Pickle that he had been in Berlin more than once, and, as we shall see, Frederick amused him with hopes of assistance. Kelly has left Charles's followers in distress at Avignon. Kelly, in fact, received his conge; he was distrusted by the Earl Marischal, and Carte, the historian. On Jan. 28, Albemarle hears that Charles has been in Paris 'under the habit of a Capuchine Fryar,' and this WAS a disguise of his, according <b>to</b> <b>Pickle.</b>|$|E
