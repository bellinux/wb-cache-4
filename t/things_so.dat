5|$|Sol is Asher's younger brother, and Asher has {{provided}} for him {{most of his}} life. Asher has been a father figure to Sol since a young age, and Sol depends on him. Looking after Sol takes a toll on Asher, however. Sol is loyal to his brother, but depends on him {{so much that he}} finds it difficult to function without him. Sol likes his family to be together, but they are fractured due to Asher being a troublemaker and their mother being mentally unstable and Sol wants to reunite them. Sol's dependence on Asher also means he finds it difficult to establish his own identity. Asher is willing to put himself out to secure Sol's success, such as being stabbed by his mother and giving away his father's Rolex watch so Sol can get a place in the dance group, and has done <b>things</b> <b>so</b> that Sol would not have to do them himself. Thompson opined that Asher is not necessarily the best role model for Sol, but is a good brother even though the mistakes he makes override the good things he has done for Sol. Cole said that Sol is not a troublemaker but he gets into trouble without meaning to as trouble comes to him. Although he does not bring attention to himself, he has a bad temper and hides his feelings with violence. He gets into a few fights throughout the series, and makes situations worse by getting physical. Sol does not understand or think about what he is doing when he loses his temper. Cole also said that trust is an issue with Sol throughout the series.|$|E

25|$|The message I {{would give}} to Aikidoka {{in general is}} that what we see today is not, in my humble opinion, the Aikido of the founder. It has become so many other <b>things.</b> <b>So</b> many complications, {{additions}} and unnecessary requirements hide the essential nature of the art. However, those who seek shall find, and if they are able to step outside of the box and dispassionately explore, they may discover a very simple magical secret!".|$|E
25|$|Angie {{returns to}} Walford, with her plans still secret, {{and tries to}} show {{interest}} in Den's plan to move the location of The Queen Vic, but it is plain to see that her mind is elsewhere. Den soon realises that she is seeing someone else, and although he doesn't care that she is with another man, he is concerned {{for the state of}} his business. Den visits a solicitor and returns with papers protecting himself and his business should Angie decide to leave him again. Angie decides to leave in May of that year, still under a cloak of secrecy and only divulging her plan to leave on the night of her departure. Unfortunately for Angie, Den cruelly informs her that he has arranged <b>things</b> <b>so</b> that she won't {{be able to get a}} penny out of him. After their final showdown Angie gets into her taxicab and leaves Walford. This is Angie's last appearance.|$|E

25|$|The Child of Thorns, Chise's {{master and}} fiancé, once apprenticed to Master Lindenbaum. A being with both fae and human elements, his origins are a mystery. Known as the Thorn Sorcerer, the other faeries {{see him as}} an abomination, {{something}} he does not mind. Besides using glamour to hide his appearance, he can control and also turn himself into shadows, and when angry enough, he takes on a more monstrous form. He can even change his head to a human’s using magic. Despite claiming to lack human emotions, after some time caring for Chise he has slowly developed a true fondness for her. However, his innate lack of understanding certain human emotions makes Lindenbaum call him a child. He dislikes children. He says {{they do not have}} magic powers, but they are talented in being able to see the true nature of <b>things,</b> <b>so</b> sometimes he is found out. He is called “Pilum Murialis” by the wizards.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason for}} devising the murder-fine was this: {{in the days}} of Cnut the Great, King of the Danes, when at the prayer of the English barons he sent his army back to Denmark after he had conquered and pacified England, the barons of England offered {{themselves}} as sureties to the said King Cnut that, whatever the force the king kept with him in England they would have form peace in all <b>things</b> <b>so</b> that, if anyone of the English should slay any of the men whom the king kept with him and that man could not make his defence against the charge by the judgment of God, that is by water and iron, justice would be done upon him. If he fled away and could not be arrested they would pay on his behalf sixty-six marks, to be collected in the village where he was slain, because the inhabitants did not produce the slayer. And if the marks could not be collected because of poverty, they would be collected in the hundred for deposit in the king's treasury.|$|E

The inscription on his statuette read [...] "To Cary Grant, for his unique mastery {{of the art of}} screen acting with respect and affection of his colleagues". On being presented with the award, his friend Frank Sinatra announced: [...] "It was made for the sheer brilliance of acting...

500|$|In a 2015 {{interview}} with Pablo S. Torre in ESPN The Magazine, Lin expressed belief that perceptions of Asians had affected {{his reputation as}} a player who was turnover-prone or unable to use both hands, despite statistics that suggested he had improved in both areas. He also cited the notion that he was a poor defender due to the belief that he lacked speed, while D'Antoni stated that Lin [...] "was one of the quickest athletes we've ever worked out". Lin also opined that, being an Asian basketball player, his performance with the Knicks may have gained excessive publicity. [...] "People just aren't used to seeing Asians do certain <b>things,</b> <b>so</b> it creates a very polarizing effect," [...] Lin stated.|$|E
500|$|John Bradley, who portrays Samwell Tarly, {{also spoke}} about the scene, saying [...] "And what I like about that, and seeing her like that is you know then that her {{sexuality}} {{over the course of}} the last few seasons, we've seen her use as such a tool -- that's all very deliberate. She presents herself in this way as this beautiful woman because she knows the effect that that can have on people. She knows the effect that that has on Stannis, and that can make men do unadvisable <b>things.</b> <b>So</b> the fact that she did that and she uses that power in that way to have this influence on people. That puts her into context as somebody who really does know what she's doing." ...|$|E

500|$|Pound {{contrasts}} this empiricism against {{knowledge gained}} through increasingly abstract definitions. As an example, Pound relates {{what might happen}} if a European is asked to define [...] "red". After the initial response that red is a color, Pound imagines asking for a definition of color and having it described in terms of vibration, with vibration then defined in terms of energy, and that successive abstractions eventually reach a level where language has lost its power. Returning to empiricism, Pound reminds the reader that the progress of science increased rapidly once [...] "Bacon had suggested the direct examination of phenomena, and after Galileo and others had stopped discussing <b>things</b> <b>so</b> much, and had begun really to look at them". Pound provides several other examples of the same contrasting ideas throughout the first chapter, ranging over topics as diverse as chemistry, Chinese writing, and Stravinsky. At the end of the chapter he summarizes his argument by claiming abstraction does not expand knowledge.|$|E
500|$|The {{income from}} the concerts did not permit generous {{rehearsal}} time. Wood had nine hours to rehearse all the music for each week's six concerts. To gain the best results on so little rehearsal, Wood developed two facets of his conducting that remained his trademark throughout his career. First, he bought sets of the orchestral parts and marked them all with minutely detailed instructions to the players; secondly he developed a clear and expressive conducting technique. An orchestral cellist wrote that [...] "if you watched him, you couldn't come in wrong." [...] The violist Bernard Shore wrote, [...] "You may be reading at sight in public, but you can't possibly go wrong with that stick in front of you". Thirty-five years after Wood's death, André Previn recounted a story {{by one of his}} players who recalled that Wood [...] "had everything planned out and timed to the minute ... at 10a.m. precisely his baton went down. You learned <b>things</b> <b>so</b> thoroughly with him, but in the most economical time." ...|$|E
500|$|Vegetarian meals were {{eaten in}} a [...] "communal" [...] dining area, where food was {{vulnerable}} to aggressive monkeys and crows. Accounts {{of the food}} vary, some calling it spicy while others said it was bland. Lennon described the food as [...] "lousy", while Pattie Boyd says it was delicious. Menu items included chickpeas mixed with cumin seeds, whole wheat dough baked over a fire, spiced eggplant, potatoes that had been picked locally, and, for breakfast, cornflakes, toast and coffee. [...] Starr had problems with the diet because of his past illnesses: [...] "The food was impossible for me, because I'm allergic to so many different <b>things,</b> <b>so</b> I took two suitcases with me: one of clothes and one of Heinz beans" [...] and eggs. After dinner, the musicians gathered {{on the roof of}} Harrison's bungalow to talk and listen to the Ganges river. [...] Sometimes they listened to records and played guitar or sitar [...] while their wives gathered in one of their rooms and discussed life as the partner of a Beatle.|$|E
