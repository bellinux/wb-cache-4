To defeat them, Crash has to jack a smaller Titan to fight them.

5|$|As a {{consequence}} of bounded expansion, the subgraph isomorphism problem, of finding whether a pattern graph of bounded size exists as a subgraph of a larger graph, can be solved in linear time when <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> graph has bounded book thickness. The {{same is true for}} detecting whether the pattern graph is an induced subgraph of <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> graph, or whether it has a graph homomorphism to <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> graph. For the same reason, the problem of testing whether a graph of bounded book thickness obeys a given formula of first order logic is fixed-parameter tractable.|$|E
5|$|Caroline Island {{is heavily}} vegetated, and most islets possess three ringed zones of vegetation: an {{outermost}} herb mat, typically composed mainly of Heliotropium anomalum; an inward zone of shrub, primarily Heliotropium foertherianum; and a central forested region, typically dominated by groves of Pisonia grandis trees. Coconut palms {{have also been}} introduced and exist in substantial quantities on <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> islets. This pattern of vegetation is consistent across <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> islets, with smaller islets lacking the central forest and the smallest vegetated solely by low herbs. Other common plants include Suriana maritima and Morinda citrifolia.|$|E
