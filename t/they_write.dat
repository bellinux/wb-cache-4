5|$|It is {{a long-standing}} practice, {{as with many}} Jesuit schools around the world, that pupils write A.M.D.G. in the top left hand corner of any piece of work they do. It stands for the Latin phrase Ad Majorem Dei Gloriam which means For the Greater Glory of God. At {{the end of a}} piece of work <b>they</b> <b>write</b> L.D.S. in the centre of the page. It stands for Laus Deo Semper which means Praise to God Always. These are both {{traditional}} Jesuit mottoes.|$|E
5|$|The authors {{discuss the}} broader concept of denial using social science theory, noting its {{occurrence}} appears in society when individuals are frightened or ashamed of their actions. <b>They</b> <b>write</b> that these motivations, when expanded {{from an individual}} to wider society, present themselves {{as a form of}} disease. The book identifies climate change denial itself as a pathology afflicting the culture of the planet. The authors lament that an inverse relationship exists between an increasing scientific consensus regarding climate change, and a simultaneous increase in denial within the greater public about the same issue.|$|E
5|$|The couple first {{wrote about}} the {{experience}} in articles for the online magazine The Tyee. The popularity of the articles led to a book deal. In the book, Smith and MacKinnon each write alternate chapters, 12 in total. The first chapter is written by MacKinnon and focuses on {{the first month of}} their experience. <b>They</b> <b>write</b> in the first person as a memoir that explores their own dietary experiences and personal feelings.|$|E

40|$|Turn of {{the century}} Native American women's {{published}} writing is examined for the elements which presage contemporary Native American women's writing. In particular, three writers' works and biographies are examined {{in order to determine}} why <b>they</b> <b>wrote,</b> how <b>they</b> <b>wrote</b> and what <b>they</b> <b>wrote.</b> Pauline Johnson, Zitkala-Sa and Mourning Dove made early contributions to the field of Native American women's literature...|$|R
50|$|<b>They</b> <b>wrote</b> a {{pilot for}} a TV series {{that was never}} made, The Fat Man (1959). Cagney used them again for an IRA thriller, Shake Hands with the Devil (1959) and <b>they</b> <b>wrote</b> an episode of Bourbon Street Beat (1960).|$|R
5|$|At Massive Dynamic, Brandon (Ryan McDonald) theorizes to {{the team}} that Observers are time travelers, {{as they have been}} {{documented}} during several major events in history. <b>They</b> <b>write</b> in an incomprehensible language, and the number of Observer sightings has increased over the past few months, leaving the team wondering why. Meanwhile, August visits the other Observers, who are not happy that he saved a girl who was supposed to die in the plane crash. To correct his mistake, they send Donald Long (Paul Rae), an assassin affiliated with the Observers to correct August's actions. In an attempt to save Christine, August sends a secret message to Walter. During the meeting, August reveals Christine will die because she is not important; Walter tells August that he has to make her important.|$|E
5|$|Edwards is a far-right {{political}} activist from Memphis, Tennessee, {{described by the}} Southern Poverty Law Center as a rising star of the modern white-nationalist movement. <b>They</b> <b>write</b> that he is articulate, charming, and at ease {{in front of the}} public, as well as in television and radio studios. He attended Briarcrest Christian School, a private school in Memphis, and in ninth grade transferred into a Christian-nationalist homeschooling program, a decision that he said led him into political activism. In 2000 he volunteered for Pat Buchanan's presidential campaign, and in 2002 ran unsuccessfully for the Tennessee House of Representatives. It was during this campaign that he met fellow activist Austin Farley, who was on the ballot against him. In October of that year, he and Farley established The Political Cesspool.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{his writing}} career, Joehana wrote independently, unattached to any {{publishing}} house. At the time, Balai Pustaka, a publisher {{operated by the}} Dutch colonial government, was attracting numerous Sundanese-language writers. His biographers Tini Kartini et al. suggest that Joehana rejected his contemporaries' approach, choosing to work independently rather than again {{work for the government}} which had fired him and would certainly censor his works. This, <b>they</b> <b>write,</b> is shown through the themes common in the stories: where his contemporaries focused on escapist literature and entertainment, Joehana focused on social criticism. However, Ajip Rosidi, a scholar of Sundanese literature, suggests that Joehana's refusal to use formal Sundanese meant that Balai Pustaka would not accept his works.|$|E
2500|$|Other pseudonyms were created, at {{the insistence}} of {{publisher}} John Sanders, to disguise how prolific the two writers were. For the revived Eagle <b>they</b> <b>wrote</b> [...] "Doomlord", [...] "Joe Soap", [...] "Rebel the Police Dog", [...] "Computer Warrior", [...] "The Fists of Danny Pyke", [...] "Manix" [...] and [...] "The House of Daemon"; for Scream! <b>they</b> <b>wrote</b> [...] "The Thirteenth Floor", for Roy of the Rovers <b>they</b> <b>wrote</b> [...] "Dan Harker's War", and for Battle <b>they</b> <b>wrote</b> [...] "Invasion 1984". During this time Wagner wrote the documentary strip [...] "Fight for the Falklands" [...] for Battle, without Grant who had no interest in war stories, and [...] "Dan Dare" [...] with Pat Mills for Eagle.|$|R
30|$|The {{university}} student group majored in medicine {{at a private}} university in Japan. <b>They</b> <b>wrote</b> Criterion® essays {{for the first time}} as part of their English lesson.

40|$|The New Testament Writings and the Septuagint were {{possibly}} compiled in Hellenism’s greatest {{period of}} influence. It {{is reasonable to}} say that the writings were influenced by Hellenism because <b>they</b> were <b>written</b> in the language of Hellenism. This study examines how the hegemony of Hellenism, the worldviews of Hellenists, and the current of anti-Semitism impacted the New Testament Writers and influenced why <b>they</b> <b>wrote</b> how <b>they</b> <b>wrote...</b>|$|R
5|$|In a 2009 {{paper on}} the affinities of Gondwanatheria, Yamila Gurovich and Robin Beck argue that the {{difference}} in shape between MACN-RN 975 and Argentodites is due to extensive wear on the former specimen; <b>they</b> <b>write</b> that {{the parts of the}} p4 that are not worn are virtually identical to the equivalents parts of the Argentodites p4. In addition, MACN-RN 975 is said to have as many ridges as Argentodites and to be of approximately similar size—about 15% larger. They allocate MACN-RN 975 to the gondwanathere Ferugliotherium and consequently, they argue that Argentodites most likely represents either Ferugliotherium or some related species. In the same year, Guillermo Rougier and colleagues also suggested ferugliotherian affinities of Argentodites in a {{paper on the}} mammals of the Allen Formation, another Cretaceous rock unit of Argentina. Ferugliotherium is a gondwanathere from Late Cretaceous Argentinean deposits. Gondwanatheres are a small and enigmatic group from the late Cretaceous and Paleogene of South America, Antarctica, Madagascar, India, and perhaps Tanzania. Although the evolutionary affinities of gondwanatheres are controversial, both teams that identified Argentodites as gondwanathere believe gondwanatheres are likely themselves multituberculates or closely related to them.|$|E
5|$|For their novel, {{the group}} members {{decide to take}} the typical {{elements}} from already popular young-adult series. Homer initially suggest that <b>they</b> <b>write</b> about vampires, but Patty notes {{the fact that there}} are already so many popular novels out there in that genre. They therefore decide to write about an orphan troll who goes to a magic school located under the Brooklyn Bridge. Fantasy author Neil Gaiman overhears the team talking and offers his help writing the novel; although they allow him to join, he is only given the task of bringing food for them while they are writing. The group members quickly finish the novel, which they name The Troll Twins of Underbridge Academy, and meet up with a book publishing executive for TweenLit Inc. at a book fair. Although he likes the novel, he dismisses it because it lacks a fake author with an inspirational back story. Meanwhile, Lisa is having a hard time making progress on her book because of constant distractions and quickly becomes saddened after realizing that she will never have her name on a novel. However, Homer approaches her and offers her to be the fake author of The Troll Twins of Underbridge Academy. Lisa admits defeat and takes the offer. They and the rest of the crew then approach the book publishing executive again, and he decides to buy the novel for a million dollars. As the team is celebrating at Moe's Tavern, they receive an advance copy. They are shocked to discover that the publisher has replaced the troll-aspects of the story with vampires, renaming the novel The Vampire Twins of Transylvania Prep, because market testing showed that vampires are more popular than trolls.|$|E

25|$|The {{characters}} must {{fit their}} context. All reputable calligraphers in China were well educated and well read. In addition to calligraphy, they were skilled in other areas, most likely painting, poetry, music, opera, martial arts, and Go. Therefore, their abundant education {{contributed to their}} calligraphy. A calligrapher practicing another calligrapher's characters would always know what the text means, when it was created, and in what circumstances. When <b>they</b> <b>write,</b> their characters' shape and weight agrees with {{the rhythm of the}} phrases, especially in less constrained styles such as semi-cursive and cursive. One who does not know the meaning of the characters <b>they</b> <b>write,</b> but varies their shape and weight on a whim, does not produce good calligraphy.|$|E
25|$|This rule is {{commonly}} violated in legal documents where the authors {{want to make}} it as clear as possible that the names refer to the contracting parties in particular, so <b>they</b> <b>write</b> it in uppercase (not only the common name parts of the company names but also generic words referring to the parties involved).|$|E
25|$|Unusual Films also {{maintains}} a student film production program. The Cinema Production {{program is designed}} to give professional training in all facets of motion picture production.

Before graduation, seniors produce their own high-definition short film which <b>they</b> <b>write,</b> direct, and edit.|$|E

25|$|Once the {{algorithm}} is understood, one can type almost any character {{with a little}} practice, even if one hasn't typed it before. Muscle memory {{will make sure that}} frequent typists using this method don't have to think about how the characters are actually constructed, just as the vast majority of English typists don't think very much about the spelling of words when <b>they</b> <b>write.</b>|$|E
25|$|Insurers {{will often}} use {{insurance}} agents to initially market or underwrite their customers. Agents can be captive, meaning <b>they</b> <b>write</b> only for one company, or independent, {{meaning that they}} can issue policies from several companies. The existence and success of companies using insurance agents is likely due to improved and personalized service. Companies also use Broking firms, Banks and other corporate entities (like Self Help Groups, Microfinance Institutions, NGOs etc.) to market their products.|$|E

25|$|In the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Coast Guard, {{the enlisted}} rating of yeoman {{describes}} an enlisted service member who performs administrative and clerical work ashore and embarked aboard vessels at sea.

They organize files and operate office equipment and order and distribute office supplies. <b>They</b> <b>write</b> and type business and social letters, notices, directives, forms and reports.|$|E
25|$|Problematic point(s): it {{is often}} unclear whether a common name is {{actually}} part of an official geographical name, e.g. many people believe Fertő tó is the actual name of Fertő Lake so <b>they</b> <b>write</b> it with a hyphen, while the name is only Fertő, thus a space must be used before tó. In addition, names like Szahara sivatag (‘Sahara Desert’) or Urál hegység ‘Ural Mountains’ don’t contain the common name, so no hyphen must be used, {{as opposed to the}} Kaszpi-tenger type.|$|E
25|$|Gymnasiums {{have its}} courses (smerovi), {{and the most}} common ones are the Socio-Linguistics Course, Science-Mathematics Course, Information Technology Course, Bilingual Course, and the General Course. Students can only choose one course (they do it when <b>they</b> <b>write</b> their wish list for {{preferred}} schools and courses) and they usually don't change it until they graduate. Every course has the same number and list of classes, but the difference is in their schedules (for example, the Socio-Linguistic Course might have English classes five times a week, while the Science-Mathematics Course offers two English classes a week).|$|E
