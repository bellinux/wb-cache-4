5|$|The Zong {{massacre}} was {{the mass}} killing of 133African slaves by {{the crew of}} the British slave ship Zong in the days following 29November 1781. The Gregson slave-trading syndicate, based in Liverpool, owned the ship and sailed her in the Atlantic slave trade. As was common business practice, they had taken out insurance on the lives of <b>the</b> <b>slaves</b> as cargo. When the ship ran low on potable water following navigational mistakes, the crew threw slaves overboard into the sea to drown, partly in order to ensure the survival {{of the rest of the}} ship's passengers, and in part to cash in on the insurance on <b>the</b> <b>slaves,</b> thus not losing money on <b>the</b> <b>slaves</b> who would have died from the lack of drinking water.|$|E

5|$|It is {{not certain}} that <b>the</b> <b>slaves</b> were a {{homogeneous}} group {{under the leadership of}} Spartacus.

40|$|In {{the present}} paper, we examine a design method for {{master-slave}} systems of bilateral control systems. In master-slave systems, human operator works to achieve tasks via the master and <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> system. <b>The</b> <b>slave</b> system contacts <b>the</b> environment and works the tasks. According to past studies, when {{the dynamics of}} environment is treated as uncertainties, the number of unstable poles of <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> system is required to be equivalent to that of <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> system with <b>the</b> dynamics of the environment. In some cases, the number of unstable poles of <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> system with <b>the</b> dynamics of environment {{is different from that}} of <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> system. We propose a simple design method of bilateral control systems such that the number of unstable poles of <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> system with <b>the</b> dynamics of environment is different from that of <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> system without <b>the</b> dynamics of the environment...|$|R

5|$|Plutarch's {{account of}} the revolt {{suggests}} that <b>the</b> <b>slaves</b> simply wished to escape to freedom, and leave Roman territory by way of Cisalpine Gaul. Appian and Florus describe the revolt as a civil war, in which <b>the</b> <b>slaves</b> intended to capture the city of Rome itself. The Third Servile War had significant and far-reaching effects on Rome's broader history. Pompey and Crassus exploited their successes to further their political careers, using their public acclaim and the implied threat of their legions to sway the consular elections of 70 BC in their favor. Their subsequent actions as Consuls greatly furthered the subversion of Roman political institutions {{and contributed to the}} eventual transition of the Roman Republic into the Roman Empire.|$|E

30|$|The {{concept of}} a space robot {{teleoperation}} system is illustrated in Fig.  1. In the space center on earth, an operator manipulates the master arms {{by looking at the}} virtual environment and predicting the movement of the space robot on orbit. The control inputs from the master arms and the position data of the virtual arm are transferred to <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> arm on orbit with a communication delay. <b>The</b> <b>slave</b> arms on orbit follow the motion commands generated by the master arms on earth. When <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> arms contact with the payload or the environment, the contact force is locally controlled using force sensor data. However, <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> arms’ position data arrive at the space center on earth with a communication delay. Hence, the positions of <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> arms at <b>the</b> moment of teleoperation are unknown on earth. In order to overcome the communication delay problem, simulated motions of <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> arms (virtual arms) are displayed for the human operator. The simulated motion is transferred to <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> arm controller as well as the motion command generated by the master arms (see Fig.  1). The motion of the virtual arms modifies <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> arm’s position in order to eliminate the error between <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> arm and virtual arm. The joint angle data of <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> arm are transferred to the virtual environment in order to display the movement of <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> arm, which is superimposed on the movement of the virtual arm. The system can be divided into the hybrid motion simulator, <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> system, and <b>the</b> master system.|$|R
5|$|Barbadian {{traditional}} {{folk songs}} are {{heavily influenced by}} the music of England. Many traditional songs concern events current {{at the time of}} their composition, such as the emancipation of <b>the</b> <b>slaves</b> of Barbados, and the coronations of Victoria, George V, and Elizabeth II; this song tradition dates back to 1650. The most influential Barbadian folk songs are associated with the island's lower-class laborers, who have held on to their folk heritage.|$|E
5|$|Collins and his {{partners}} brought in slaves from Africa to dig a canal from Lake Phelps to the Scuppernong River. The canal served two purposes: first, {{as a means of}} transporting goods and people to and from the plantation; and second, it served as a massive drainage ditch as <b>the</b> <b>slaves</b> of Somerset Place worked to drain the surrounding swamps. Later, the canal system was expanded to provide irrigation for the rice and corn fields of the plantation.|$|E
5|$|Edwards {{then tried}} to change the deal with Dart. Instead of {{dividing}} the smuggled slaves between the two men, Edwards tried to keep all <b>the</b> <b>slaves</b> and instead repay the money Dart had advanced him, with some interest. Dart sued, and at the trial in March 1839 Edwards offered two forged documents claiming that Dart had sold his interest in <b>the</b> <b>slaves</b> to Edwards. In forging the documents, Edwards originally secured Dart's signature on a document written in a type of ink that could later be chemically removed. After Dart signed the document, Edwards then removed the original wording of the document and substituted a deed selling Dart's interest in the land and slaves. The documents were determined to be forgeries and on April 2, 1840, Dart was awarded $89,000. Edwards fled the Republic of Texas to the United States.|$|E

50|$|Since it is <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> {{pendulum}} that {{releases the}} gravity lever, this synchronization {{is vital to}} the functioning of the clock. The synchronizing mechanism used a small spring attached to the shaft of <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> pendulum and an electromagnetic armature that would catch the spring if <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> pendulum was running slightly late, thus shortening the period of <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> pendulum for one swing. <b>The</b> <b>slave</b> pendulum was adjusted to run slightly slow, such that on approximately every other synchronization pulse the spring would be caught by the armature.|$|R

5|$|Following his {{successful}} defense against calls for his removal, Powell continued speaking {{against what he}} saw as violations of constitutional rights. In 1864, he condemned General Order No. 11, an edict of Ulysses S. Grant that barred Jews from the Department of Tennessee, which included regions of Kentucky. In the same speech, he rebuked federal military interference with the elections in Kentucky. In 1864, he opposed a constitutional amendment aimed at freeing <b>the</b> <b>slaves.</b>|$|E
