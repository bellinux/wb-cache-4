40|$|Essays in Monetary Policy Rules by Postrick Lifa Mushendami John Taylor‘s (1993 b) {{rule has}} revived the {{interest}} and usefulness of instrument rules {{in the formulation of}} monetary policy both among academics and practitioners. Consequently, research in this area has increased to answer among other things, which policy rule closely represent the actual monetary policy formulation of the central bank, or what is the performance of these Taylor rules compared to alternative rules. This thesis intends to add both to the theoretical and empirical literature on monetary policy rules and structured as follows: Chapter 2 attempts to examine the implication of interest rate smoothing on the persistence of a technology and monetary policy shock. Using a closed economy model of Galí (2008), I show that interest rate smoothing (Taylor rule with lagged interest rate and backward looking Taylor rule) tend <b>to</b> <b>protracts</b> the persistence of a monetary policy shock, while it truncates the persistence of a technological innovation. The persistence due to a monetary shock from the Taylor rule is however shorter, while that from a technology shock is longer. Thus, Taylor rule is considered superior to the Taylor rule with lagged interest rule or the backward looking Taylor rule when the economy is hit by a monetary policy shock. On the contrary, the Taylor rule with lagged interest rate and the backward looking Taylor rule is considered superior to the Taylor rule when the economy is faced with a technology shock. These results tend to suggest that a policy maker faces a trade off regarding the Taylor rule or the interest smoothing rules. Chapter 3, attempts to rank the performance of targeting rules against instrument rules {{in the presence of a}} cost push shock. In particular, it compares the performance of the three targeting rules (namely domestic inflation targeting rule (DIT), consumer price inflation (CPI) based targeting rule, exchange rate peg (PEG) with the original Taylor rule and the Forward looking Taylor rules of Clarida, Galí and Gertler(1998), commonly known as the CGG(+ 1) and CGG(+ 4). Using a small open economy, I show that the domestic inflation targeting rule simultaneously stabilizes the output gap and domestic inflation in the presence of a domestic technology shock and a foreign output innovation and hence superior. Among instrument rules I show that the Taylor rule is superior to its forward looking specifications CGG(+ 1) and CGG(+ 4). However, in the presence of a cost push shock the results are mixed. The domestic inflation targeting rule only stabilizes the domestic inflation, while the CGG(+ 1) minimizes the output gap volatilities the most. The CGG(+ 4) is the most inferior rule in this model and calibration, given that it maximizes the volatilities in the domestic inflation and the output gap. Chapter 4, empirically tests whether developing countries respond to domestic demand conditions or merely responds to developments in international interest rates in their interest rate reaction function. I show that developing countries do not strictly subscribe to the Taylor principle in setting nominal interest rate. Moreover, they tend to respond to international interest rates, inflation and past interest rates. Chapter 5, conclude...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Influenza {{pandemic}} preparedness {{plans are}} currently developed and refined on {{national and international}} levels. Much {{attention has been given}} to the administration of antiviral drugs, but contact reduction can also be an effective part of mitigation strategies and has the advantage to be not limited per se. The effectiveness of these interventions depends on various factors which must be explored by sensitivity analyses, based on mathematical models. Methods We use the freely available planning tool InfluSim to investigate how pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions can mitigate an influenza pandemic. In particular, we examine how intervention schedules, restricted stockpiles and contact reduction (social distancing measures and isolation of cases) determine the course of a pandemic wave and the success of interventions. Results A timely application of antiviral drugs combined with a quick implementation of contact reduction measures is required <b>to</b> substantially <b>protract</b> the peak of the epidemic and reduce its height. Delays in the initiation of antiviral treatment (e. g. because of parsimonious use of a limited stockpile) result in much more pessimistic outcomes and can even lead to the paradoxical effect that the stockpile is depleted earlier compared to early distribution of antiviral drugs. Conclusion Pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical measures should not be used exclusively. The protraction of the pandemic wave is essential to win time while waiting for vaccine development and production. However, it is the height of the peak of an epidemic which can easily overtax general practitioners, hospitals or even whole public health systems, causing bottlenecks in basic and emergency medical care. </p...|$|R

What determines trade relationships? Srivastava et al. concluded that political instability negatively impacts the amount of exports of a country, and that trade flows are especially large between countries with colonial relations in the past (Srivastava and Green 1986). Morrow et al. found that democracy and common geopolitical interests increase trade, but strategic alliances not necessarily do so. Pollins argues in the same way by saying that trade is significantly influenced by broader political relations (Morrow et al. 1998, 1999; Pollins 1989). More recently, Umana Dajud classified the political proximity of countries according to the correlation of their votes in the UN, differences in forms of government, and ideological distance of citizens, and found that political differences impact trade relations (Umana Dajud 2013). Another important aspect is the increasing willingness of the international community <b>to</b> stop the <b>protracting</b> effect of specialty metal ore export on regional conflicts, for example, the export of tantalum-containing minerals from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (Moran et al. 2014), which may alter global trade pattern.|$|R

But NOW an odd change crept on them. The light from the open window that gave upon the enormous pines and the rolling prospect up to the dim heights of the Sierras fell upon this strange, incongruous, yet perfectly artistic figure. For the dress was the skillful creation of a great Parisian artist, and in its exquisite harmony of color, shape, and material it not only hid the absurd model, but clothed it with an alarming grace and refinement! A queer feeling of awe, of shame, and of unwilling admiration took possession of them. Some of them--from remote Western towns--had never seen the like before; those who HAD had forgotten it in those five years of self-exile, of healthy independence, and of contiguity to Nature in her unaffected simplicity. All had been familiar with the garish, extravagant, and dazzling femininity of the Californian towns and cities, but never had they known anything approaching the ideal grace of this type of exalted, even if artificial, womanhood. And although in the fierce freedom of their little republic they had laughed to scorn such artificiality, a few yards of satin and lace cunningly fashioned, and thrown over a frame of wood and wire, touched them now with a strange sense of its superiority. The better to show its attractions, Clinton Grey had placed the figure near a full-length, gold-framed mirror, beside a marble-topped table. Yet how cheap and tawdry these splendors showed beside this work of art! How cruel was the contrast of their own rough working clothes to this miracle of adornment which that same mirror reflected! And even when Clinton Grey, the enthusiast, looked towards his beloved woods for relief, he could not help thinking of them as a more fitting frame for this strange goddess than this new house into which she had strayed. Their gravity became real; their gibes in some strange way had vanished.|$|R
40|$|Background: Recurrent {{inflammation}} {{in chronic}} pancreatitis (CP) {{is not well}} understood. Aims: To investigate whether decorin, an extracellular matrix (ECM) proteoglycan with macrophage modulating activity, is a pathogenic factor allowing diseased pancreatic stroma to sustain inflammation by affecting the cytokine profile of accumulating inflammatory cells. Methods: Decorin was examined in 18 donors and 32 patients with CP by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR), western blotting, and immunohistochemistry of pancreatic specimens. QRT-PCR {{was used to assess}} cytokine expression in donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), exposed or not to decorin in vitro, and to compare it with the cytokine profile of circulating and resident mononuclear cells (MNC) of patients with CP. Results: In CP, desmoplasia is associated with overexpression of decorin in the growing ECM and enlarged pancreatic nerves. In culture, exposure of MNC to decorin stimulated expression of the MNC recruiting chemokine MCP- 1. In biopsies, MNC infiltrates in decorin rich CP tissue showed a 300 -fold upregulation of MCP- 1 compared with decorin free peripheral blood, whereas no difference was found in basal MCP- 1 expression in PBMC of patients versus donors. This effect was specific for MCP 19 ̆ 7 other inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin 1 and tumour necrosis factor, were not affected. Conclusion: Decorin is a molecular marker of desmoplasia in CP, and excessive decorin may allow fibrotic masses <b>to</b> nourish and <b>protract</b> inflammation by deregulating the process of MNC accumulation and activation. These data provide a molecular basis for surgical resection of diseased tissue as a treatment option in CP...|$|R

40|$|The rat vibrissal {{system is}} an {{important}} model {{for the study of}} somatosensation, but the small size and rapid speed of the vibrissae have precluded measuring precise vibrissal-object contact sequences during behavior. We used a laser light sheet to quantify, with 1 ms resolution, the spatiotemporal structure of whisker-surface contact as five naïve rats freely explored a flat, vertical glass wall. Consistent with previous work, we show that the whisk cycle cannot be uniquely defined because different whiskers often move asynchronously, but that quasi-periodic (~ 8 Hz) variations in head velocity represent a distinct temporal feature on which to lock analysis. Around times of minimum head velocity, whiskers <b>protract</b> <b>to</b> make contact with the surface, and then sustain contact with the surface for extended durations (~ 25 – 60 ms) before detaching. This behavior results in discrete temporal windows in which large numbers of whiskers are in contact with the surface. These sustained collective contact intervals (SCCIs) were observed on 100 % of whisks for all five rats. The overall spatiotemporal structure of the SCCIs can be qualitatively predicted based on information about head pose and the average whisk cycle. In contrast, precise sequences of whisker-surface contact depend on detailed head and whisker kinematics. Sequences of vibrissal contact were highly variable, equally likely to propagate in all directions across the array. Somewhat more structure was found when sequences of contacts were examined on a row-wise basis. In striking contrast to the high variability associated with contact sequences, a consistent feature of each SCCI was that the contact locations of the whiskers on the glass converged and moved more slowly on the sheet. Together, these findings lead us to propose that the rat uses a strategy of windowed sampling to extract an object’s spatial features: specifically, the rat spatially integrates quasi-static mechanical signals across whiskers during the period of sustained contact, resembling an enclosing haptic procedure...|$|R
