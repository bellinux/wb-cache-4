Jonathan Agnew described how on one occasion he arrived at Lord's for a match which unfortunately was due to be played {{on the other side}} of London at the Oval. He also struggled with modern technology, once mistaking the <b>television</b> <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> in his hotel room for his mobile phone. When attempting to email a report to his newspaper, he would occasionally press the Delete button rather than the Send button, causing him much consternation.|$|E
25|$|The {{impetus for}} a more complex type of <b>television</b> <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> came in 1973, with the {{development}} of the Ceefax teletext service by the BBC. Most commercial remote controls at that time had a limited number of functions, sometimes as few as three: next channel, previous channel, and volume/off. This type of control did not meet the needs of teletext sets, where pages were identified with three-digit numbers. A remote control to select teletext pages would need buttons for each numeral from zero to nine, as well as other control functions, such as switching from text to picture, and the normal television controls of volume, channel, brightness, colour intensity, etc. Early teletext sets used wired remote controls to select pages, but the continuous use of the remote control required for teletext quickly indicated the need for a wireless device. So BBC engineers began talks with one or two television manufacturers, which led to early prototypes in around 1977–1978 that could control many more functions. ITT was one of the companies and later gave its name to the ITT protocol of infrared communication.|$|E

She overhauled HSN's website and made HSN a major e-commerce presence; as of 2013 HSN.com {{is one of the top}} 10 most-trafficked e-commerce sites. She evolved HSN from a linear network to a multi-platform business, [...] creating a [...] "boundaryless" [...] retail; according to Fast Company, nearly half the HSN's revenue comes through digital platforms.|$|E
50|$|A {{formerly}} popular consumer {{application of}} ultrasound was in <b>television</b> <b>remote</b> <b>controls</b> for adjusting volume and changing channels. Introduced by Zenith {{in the late}} 1950s, the system used a hand-held <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> containing short rod resonators struck by small hammers, and a microphone on the set. Filters and detectors discriminated between the various operations. The principal advantages were that no battery was needed in the hand-held control box, and unlike radio waves, the ultrasound was unlikely to affect neighboring sets. Ultrasound remained in use until displaced by infrared systems starting in the late 1980s.|$|R
50|$|Online casinos vary {{in their}} {{approach}} to the hosting of live games, with some providing live games via their own television channel, and others offering the games exclusively via their website. In the case of televised games, players can often use their mobile phone or <b>television</b> <b>remote</b> <b>controls</b> to place bets instead of doing so via a computer connected to the internet. The most common live dealer games offered at online casinos are baccarat, blackjack and roulette.|$|R
50|$|Early <b>television</b> <b>remote</b> <b>controls</b> (1956-1977) used {{ultrasonic}} tones. Present-day <b>remote</b> <b>controls</b> {{are commonly}} consumer infrared devices which send digitally-coded pulses of infrared radiation to control {{functions such as}} power, volume, tuning, temperature set point, fan speed, or other features. <b>Remote</b> <b>controls</b> for these devices are usually small wireless handheld objects {{with an array of}} buttons for adjusting various settings such as television channel, track number, and volume. For many devices, the <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> contains all the function controls while the controlled device itself has only a handful of essential primary <b>controls.</b> The <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> code, and thus the required <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> device, is usually specific to a product line, but there are universal remotes, which emulate the <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> made for most major brand devices.|$|R
2500|$|Some subtitlers {{purposely}} provide edited subtitles or captions {{to match}} {{the needs of their}} audience, for learners of the spoken dialog as a second or foreign language, visual learners, beginning readers who are deaf or hard of hearing and for people with learning and/or mental disabilities. For example, for many of its films and television programs, PBS displays [...] standard captions representing speech the program audio, word-for-word, if the viewer selects [...] "CC1", by using the <b>television</b> <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> or on-screen menu, however, they also provide edited captions to present simplified sentences at a slower rate, if the viewer selects [...] "CC2". Programs with a diverse audience also often have captions in another language. This is common with popular Latin American soap operas in Spanish. Since CC1 and CC2 share bandwidth, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) recommends translation subtitles be placed in CC3. CC4, which shares bandwidth with CC3, is also available, but programs seldom use it.|$|E

50|$|Sleep mode is a {{low power}} mode for {{electronic}} devices such as computers, <b>televisions,</b> and <b>remote</b> <b>controlled</b> devices. These modes save significantly on electrical consumption compared to leaving a device fully on and, upon resume, allow the user {{to avoid having to}} reissue instructions or to wait for a machine to reboot. Many devices signify this power mode with a pulsed or red colored LED power light.|$|R
50|$|Such {{developments}} could literally {{change the}} face of current machines and have far-reaching implications on how users interact with them. Hand-held devices would be designed with larger, easier-to-view screens, as no keyboard would be required. Touch-screen devices would no longer need to split the display between content and an on-screen keyboard, thus providing full-screen viewing of the content. Laptop computers could essentially be cut in half in terms of size, as the keyboard half would be eliminated and all internal components would be integrated behind the display, effectively resulting in a simple tablet computer. Desktop computers would consist of a CPU and screen, saving desktop space otherwise occupied by the keyboard and eliminating sliding keyboard rests built under the desk's surface. <b>Television</b> <b>remote</b> <b>controls</b> and keypads on dozens of other devices, from microwave ovens to photocopiers, could also be eliminated.|$|R
25|$|In contrast, Japanese {{manufacturers}} {{shared their}} information, quickly overcoming technical and manufacturing challenges and creating new markets. In Japan, a temperature stable crystal cut {{was developed by}} Issac Koga. Japanese efforts in materials research created piezoceramic materials competitive to the United States materials but free of expensive patent restrictions. Major Japanese piezoelectric developments included new designs of piezoceramic filters for radios and televisions, piezo buzzers and audio transducers that can connect directly to electronic circuits, and the piezoelectric igniter, which generates sparks for small engine ignition systems and gas-grill lighters, by compressing a ceramic disc. Ultrasonic transducers that transmit sound waves through air had existed {{for quite some time}} but first saw major commercial use in early <b>television</b> <b>remote</b> <b>controls.</b> These transducers now are mounted on several car models as an echolocation device, helping the driver determine the distance from the car to any objects that may be in its path.|$|R

5000|$|The Popstars {{producers}} drew {{upon this}} rivalry for Popstars: The Rivals to create two winning pop groups, a boy band {{and a girl}} group, in a [...] "battle of the sexes", to vie for the Christmas Number One spot in the UK Singles Chart, a traditionally competitive time in the British music market. To further the rivalry, {{members of the public}} were to select who would remain in the show by voting for their favourite acts using premium-rate telephone numbers, text messaging, via the Popstars website, and with the Red Button on digital <b>television</b> <b>remote</b> <b>controls.</b> Each week, the singer with the fewest public votes would be eliminated from the competition until five males and five females remained, who would then form the two rival groups. Elements of Channel 4's Big Brother were used in Popstars: The Rivals when the final ten boys and final ten girls moved into two houses and lived together, watched by television cameras.|$|R
5000|$|Popstars The Rivals {{aired on}} ITV on Saturday nights from 7 September 2002, {{beginning}} with three pre-recorded episodes of preliminary audition rounds, before switching to live broadcasts of studio performances.

The final episode of Popstars: The Rivals aired live on 22 December 2002. During the broadcast, Pepsi Chart Show presenter Neil Fox revealed in a live link-up that [...] "Sound of the Underground" [...] recorded by Girls Aloud had reached Number one on the Singles Chart, thereby becoming the Christmas Number One. One True Voice's double A-side single, [...] "Sacred Trust/After You're Gone" [...] entered the chart at Number Two.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a four phase research study into {{the ease of}} use of DTT (digital terrestrial <b>television)</b> <b>remote</b> <b>controls,</b> focusing on button labelling. The aim was to identify intuitive <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> button labels, thereby enhancing the ease of use of DTT <b>remote</b> <b>controls.</b> In phase 1, a series of brainstorming (discussion) groups was run involving members of the British public to generate intuitive button labels {{for a variety of}} DTT functions. The second phase involved expert screening of these labels. The revised lists of labels for the functions tested were then compiled into a questionnaire and distributed to members of the general public in phase 3. Respondents were asked to rank order their favourite labels for each function. The final phase involved exploring {{the extent to which the}} subjective preferences derived from the results of phase 3 mapped onto viewers' behavioural responses. Key measures explored included the speed and accuracy of correct button label identification. Generally, the results revealed close correspondence between the subjective preference data and behavioural responses. Whilst these results suggest that subjective preferences for labels are reasonable indicators of behavioural proficiency, we recommend that behavioural measures also be collected where possible. The approach reported here with reference to <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> button labels can be applied to a wide range of interactive media products and services...|$|R
