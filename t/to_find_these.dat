5|$|The most clues for {{a minimal}} Sudoku is {{believed}} to be 40, of which only two are known. If any clue is removed from either of these Sudokus, the puzzle would have more than one solution (and thus not be a proper Sudoku). These two Sudokus were discovered in 2014, more than four years after at least one programmer expressed doubts that a 40-clue minimal Sudoku would exist. In the work <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>these</b> Sudokus, other high-clue puzzles were catalogued, including more than 6,500,000,000 minimal puzzles with 36-clues. About 2600 minimal Sudokus with 39-clues were also found.|$|E

Inspired by this, she returns to her other four best friends and uses a memory spell to remind them of their friendship, cancelling Discord's magic and returning them to normal.|$|E
5|$|Historical {{observations}} of the carnivorous syndrome in plant species have been restricted to the more obvious examples of carnivory, such as the active trapping mechanisms of Drosera and Dionaea, though authors have often noted speculation about other species {{that may not be}} so obviously carnivorous. In one of the earlier publications on carnivorous plants, Charles Darwin had suggested many plants that have developed adhesive glands, such as Erica tetralix, Mirabilis longifolia, Pelargonium zonale, Primula sinesis, and Saxifraga umbrosa, may indeed be carnivorous but little research has been done on them. Darwin himself only mentioned these species in passing and did not follow through with any investigation. Adding to the small but growing list, Francis Lloyd provided his own list of species suspected of carnivory in his 1942 book on carnivorous plants, though these species and their potential were only mentioned in the introduction. Later, in a 1981 review of the literature, Paul Simons rediscovered Italian journal articles from the early 1900s that identified several additional sticky species that digested insect prey. Simons was surprised <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>these</b> articles lacking in the literature cited sections of many modern books and articles on carnivorous plants, suggesting that academic research has treated Lloyd's 1942 book as the authoritative and comprehensive source on pre-1942 research on the carnivorous syndrome.|$|E

25|$|In October 2006, it {{was decided}} to rename three {{stations}} on Line 2 {{by the end of the}} year, adopting a new naming scheme: metro stations, unlike bus stops, are no longer supposed to be named after neighbouring vertical streets, but famous streets and sights in the vicinity, making it easier for visitors <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>these</b> places.

25|$|In October 2006, {{according}} to a new naming scheme, East Wenshui Road station was renamed Dabaishu station. The scheme stressed naming stations after existing toponyms, sights and attractions (if any) rather than simply after neighbouring vertical streets, making it easier for visitors <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>these</b> places. In this particular case, the renaming aimed also to eliminate possible confusion between Wenshui East Road and Wenshui Road, a newer station of Line 1. However, in a more recent case, the same type of confusion occurred at Yingao West Road station of Line 3 and Yingao East Road station of Line 10.|$|E
25|$|In April 1977, the Comets and the Redmanizers were {{involved}} in a tumultuous post-game rumble at the Big Dome that saw both protagonists being sent and jailed at the Fort Bonifacio. At a time when the players' notion of winning a game was “at all costs”, especially in a Crispa-Toyota game, it was not uncommon <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>these</b> two teams involved in several rumbles. The very first fight actually happened back in 1975 between the two teams and led by Toyota's notorious bad boy Oscar Rocha. The apex came in 1977 when players like Fernandez and Co were mixing up at each other despite the presence of cops in the dugout.|$|E
25|$|The European Eyach {{virus and}} the Colorado tick fever virus are known {{relatives}} due to cognate genes, 55% to 88% of amino acid similarity, and similarities at the microscopic level that cannot be distinguished. <b>To</b> <b>find</b> <b>these</b> similarities, a genome sequence analysis was completed. One theory {{of how the}} European Eyach virus is proposed to have come about in Europe is by the migration of lagomorphs from North America over fifty million years ago. Since then, the virus took on some differences, and is now considered its own species of virus. European Eyach virus was isolated in 1976 from Ixodes ricinus ticks in Europe and in 1981 from the same species along with Ixodes ventalloi in 1981.|$|E

25|$|The Roman Catholics who {{originate}} {{from the present}} state of Goa, a region on the west coast of India, and their descendants are generally referred to as Goan Catholics. After the Portuguese possession of Goa in 1510, the Portuguese consolidated their power by imposing their own government and cultural traditions some of which are still retained in Goa. Many pre-Portuguese Hindu (and some Islamic) traditions were adapted or retained by the Goan Catholics. This often includes the Hindu caste system although it is not widely practiced. Throughout the Portuguese Empire a large part of civic administration (e.g. registration of birth, marriage and death, schools, hospitals, orphanages, etc.) was initially maintained by the religious orders and it is still possible <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>these</b> records with the Catholic church in Goa. All Goans born before 1961 were Portuguese citizens by birth and many present-day Goans and their descendants are reclaiming their ancestral right.|$|E
25|$|Cage left Seattle in {{the summer}} of 1941 after the painter László Moholy-Nagy invited him to teach at the Chicago School of Design (what later became the IIT Institute of Design. The {{composer}} accepted partly because he hoped to find opportunities in Chicago, that were not available in Seattle, to organize a center for experimental music. These opportunities did not materialize. Cage taught at the Chicago School of Design and worked as accompanist and composer at the University of Chicago. At one point, his reputation as percussion composer landed him a commission from the Columbia Broadcasting System to compose a soundtrack for a radio play by Kenneth Patchen. The result, The City Wears a Slouch Hat, was received well, and Cage deduced that more important commissions would follow. Hoping <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>these,</b> he left Chicago for New York City in the spring of 1942.|$|E
25|$|In early 2010, a {{group of}} {{scientists}} led by Zhang Fucheng examined fossils with preserved melanosomes (organelles which contain colors). By studying such fossils with an electron microscope, they found melanosomes preserved in a fossil Confuciusornis specimen, IVPP V13171. They reported the presence of melanosomes were of two types: eumelanosomes and pheomelanosomes. This indicated that Confuciusornis had hues of grey, red/brown and black, possibly something like the modern zebra finch. It was also the first time an early bird fossil has been shown to contain preserved pheomelanosomes. However, a second research team failed <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>these</b> reported traces of pheomelanosomes. Their 2011 study also found a link between the presence of certain metals, like copper, and preserved melanin. Using a combination of fossil impressions of melanosomes and the presence of metals in the feathers, the second team of scientists reconstructed Confuciusornis with darkly colored body feathers and upper wing feathers, but found no trace of either melanosomes or metals in the majority of the wing feathers. They suggested that the wings of Confuciusornis would have been white or, possibly, colored with carotenoid pigments. The long tail feathers of male specimens would have also been dark in color along their entire length.|$|E

500|$|On {{the release}} {{date of the}} Potato Sack bundle, players found the games within it had {{recently}} received updates.

Other hints were less direct, using online services such as Twitter and YouTube to embed clues. [...] In the case of Toki Tori, sections of new levels included braille code that referred to latitude and longitude coordinates of Two Tribes' headquarters. One player, [...] "Jake_R", traveled to Two Tribes, where he discovered the glyphs and cyphers posted outside their headquarters.
