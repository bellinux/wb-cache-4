25|$|Given {{the same}} level playing field one {{group of people who}} <b>treat</b> <b>each</b> other well will create a {{pleasant}} environment. Whereas another group of people, given exactly the same tools to work with, can create unpleasant conditions simply by how they <b>treat</b> <b>each</b> other. Writer Dawn Eden suggests that this is a simple truth which can be easily forgotten by lonely people unable to see their situation clearly. She argues that such situations can be improved by reaching out to others.|$|E

25|$|There are two {{approaches}} to reconstructing data {{from such a}} scanner: 1) <b>treat</b> <b>each</b> ring as a separate entity, so that only coincidences within a ring are detected, the image from each ring can then be reconstructed individually (2D reconstruction), or 2) allow coincidences to be detected between rings as well as within rings, then reconstruct the entire volume together (3D).|$|E

However Soberano clarifies that they are not official yet but the two said they will get there when the right time comes and the parents of the young actress already allowed them.|$|E
25|$|To provide {{culturally}} sensitive patient-centered care, physicians should <b>treat</b> <b>each</b> patient as an individual, recognizing and respecting {{his or her}} beliefs, values and care seeking behaviors. However, many physicians lack the awareness of or training in cultural competence. With the constantly changing demographics, their patients are increasingly getting diverse as well. It is utterly important to educate physicians to be culturally competent {{so that they can}} effectively treat patients of different cultural and ethnic backgrounds.|$|E

25|$|It was {{the search}} for beauty that had {{attracted}} Metzinger to the abstract. Beauty depends not only on geometrical forms or simplified colors, but plainly beauty as it exists in itself. It wasn't just the simple result of a reductive approach to the elements of all the parts. It wasn't either just a dialectic view of everything that led him just as simply to <b>treat</b> <b>each</b> object {{as opposed to the}} other, and therefore thoroughly distinct. The blurring of differences was against the entire tenor of the whole.|$|E
25|$|Hitzfeld {{was born}} in Lörrach in {{the valley of the}} Wiese in {{southwest}} Germany, close to the Swiss border. He grew up there and is the youngest of five children. Hitzfeld said that when he first left Bayern in 2004 he 'felt burnt out' and 'was a bit depressed', and 'it took me two years to recover.' He then had 'the best years at Bayern' on his return. He stated his views that people should not get too excited about things, not get too down about things, and <b>treat</b> <b>each</b> situation individually. His uncle was the World War II general Otto Hitzfeld.|$|E
25|$|For {{particles}} {{in a system}} with periodic boundary conditions two particles can be neighbours {{even though they are}} {{on opposite sides of the}} system. This occurs often in molecular dynamics simulations, for example, in which clusters form at random locations and sometimes neighbouring atoms cross the periodic boundary. When a cluster straddles the periodic boundary, a naive calculation of the center of mass will be incorrect. A generalized method for calculating the center of mass for periodic systems is to <b>treat</b> <b>each</b> coordinate, x and y and/or z, as if it were on a circle instead of a line.|$|E

25|$|Building on {{aerodynamic}} studies {{developed for}} racing cars, the Cisitalia offers {{one of the}} most accomplished examples of coachwork conceived as a single shell. The hood, body, fenders, and headlights are integral to the continuously flowing surface, rather than added on. Before the Cisitalia, the prevailing approach followed by automobile designers when defining a volume and shaping the shell was to <b>treat</b> <b>each</b> part of the body as a separate, distinct element—a box to house the passengers, another for the motor, and headlights as appendages. In the Cisitalia, there are no sharp edges. Swellings and depressions maintain the overall flow and unity, creating a sense of speed.|$|E
25|$|Interactions between {{ethnic groups}} in formal {{settings}} can also help countries torn apart by ethnic violence to recover and break down ethnic divisions. Paula Pickering, a political scientist, who studies peace-building efforts in Bosnia, finds that formal workplaces are often the site where inter-ethnic ties are formed. She claims that mixed workplaces lead to repeated inter-ethnic interaction where norms of professionalism compel everyone to cooperate and to <b>treat</b> <b>each</b> other with respect, {{making it easier for}} individuals belonging to the minority group to reach out and form relationships with everyone else. Nevertheless, Giuliano's research in Russia has shown that economic grievances, even in a mixed workplace, can be politicized on ethnic lines.|$|E

500|$|Conservationists {{disagree}} on {{when is the}} proper time {{to give up on}} a population that is becoming a hybrid swarm, or to try and save the still existing pure individuals. Once a population becomes a complete mixture, the goal becomes to conserve those hybrids to avoid their loss. Conservationists <b>treat</b> <b>each</b> case on its merits, depending on detecting hybrids within the population. It is nearly impossible to formulate a uniform hybridization policy, because hybridization can occur beneficially when it occurs [...] "naturally", and when hybrid swarms are the only remaining evidence of prior species, they need to be conserved as well.|$|E

500|$|There is a {{considerable}} degree of interest in Cuba within the CPC. Fidel Castro, the former First Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba (PCC), is greatly admired, and books have been written focusing on the successes of the Cuban Revolution. Communication between the CPC and the PCC has increased considerably since the 1990s, hardly a month going by without a diplomatic exchange. At the 4th Plenary Session of the 16th Central Committee, which discussed {{the possibility of the}} CPC learning from other ruling parties, praise was heaped on the PCC. When Wu Guanzheng, a Central Politburo member, met with Fidel Castro in 2007, he gave him a personal letter written by Hu Jintao: [...] "Facts have shown that China and Cuba are trustworthy good friends, good comrades, and good brothers who <b>treat</b> <b>each</b> other with sincerity.

[...] In January 2011, Garrett awarded Nichols a [...] "Leading Men Gold Standard" [...] and praised his portrayal that week, writing: [...] "Stephen Nichols as Tucker was all over the place this week. Initially Tucker decided to back the recording label of Devon Winters and Noah Newman. Nichols played a man who wanted to help two young men break into the music industry. However, the shocking news that Cane and Sofia have been lying to Tucker and allowing a conman to swindle Tucker’s company was destined to be revealed. Although the climax came {{at the end of the}} week, the intensity in which Stephen Nichols played the revelation was exciting to say the least. Fans know that next week Tucker McCall’s going to cause heads to roll." [...] Jae Jones of Yahoo! praised the storyline revealing Tucker as Devon's father as it gave the soap opera's matriarch, Katherine, a biracial grandson. She wrote: [...] "What seems to make the story line even more interesting is the fact that she has a biracial grandson. Who would have ever thought the show could catch up with the current times? There are not too many daytime soaps left for housewives and house husbands to enjoy, but those who watch this show are always in for a special <b>treat</b> <b>each</b> afternoon."
