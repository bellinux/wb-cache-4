5|$|Variety longispora {{is known}} from the Pacific Northwest. It has spores that are 55–75 by 2–2.5µm, and paraphyses that are similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>typical</b> variety.|$|E
5|$|The spores {{are smaller}} than the typical variety, usually 39–42 by 1.5–2µm; the paraphyses are irregularly {{branched}} on the upper portion. Fruit bodies in this variety are club-shaped and flattened compared <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>typical</b> tongue-shape of the typical variety.|$|E
5|$|After the First World War, {{many new}} food {{products}} became available <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>typical</b> household, with branded foods advertised for their convenience. Kitchen servants with time to make custards and puddings were replaced with instant foods in jars, or powders that the housewife could quickly mix. American-style dry cereals began to challenge the porridge and bacon and eggs of the middle classes, and the bread and margarine of the poor. While wartime shipping shortages had sharply narrowed choice, the 1920s saw many new kinds of fruit imported from around the world, along with better quality, packaging, and hygiene, aided by refrigerators and refrigerated ships.|$|E

5|$|Bigfin reef squids {{are also}} {{valuable}} sources for squid giant axons used in research in neuroscience and physiology. Unlike axons of other animals, squid axons are very large. Those of bigfin reef squids can range in diameter from 350 to 560μm (in contrast <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>typical</b> 1μm for humans). In life, these giant axons {{are used by}} the squids to coordinate escape jetting behaviour, enabling the squid to contract its muscles {{in a split second}} directly from the brain.|$|E
5|$|Cameras on the Galileo {{spacecraft}} observed {{fragments of}} Comet Shoemaker–Levy9 between 16 and 22 July 1994 as they collided with Jupiter's southern hemisphere {{at a speed}} of approximately 60kilometres per second. This was the first direct observation of an extraterrestrial collision of solar system objects. While the impacts {{took place on the}} side of Jupiter hidden from Earth, Galileo, then at a distance of 1.6AU from the planet, was able to see the impacts as they occurred. Its instruments detected a fireball that reached a peak temperature of about 24,000K, compared <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>typical</b> Jovian cloudtop temperature of about 130K (−143°C), with the plume from the fireball reaching a height of over 3,000km.|$|E
5|$|Khmer {{differs from}} {{neighboring}} languages such as Thai, Burmese, Lao and Vietnamese {{in that it}} is not a tonal language. Words are stressed on the final syllable, hence many words conform <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>typical</b> Mon–Khmer pattern of a stressed syllable preceded by a minor syllable. The language has been written in the Khmer script, an abugida descended from the Brahmi script via the southern Indian Pallava script, since at least the seventh century. The script's form and use has evolved over the centuries; its modern features include subscripted versions of consonants used to write clusters and a division of consonants into two series with different inherent vowels. Approximately 79% of Cambodians are able to read Khmer.|$|E

5|$|Modern Shift: In today’s society, we are {{beginning}} to see a shift in gender representation in the media particularly in the male fashion industry. Fashion designers are now starting to blur the lines between masculinity and femininity. In the first advertisement, the male has a very soft delicate hold on the rose compared <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>typical</b> aggressive grip men exhibit in ads. In the other two examples, both men are not only portraying the idea of feminine touch but the concept of self-touch as well.|$|E
5|$|S.coccinea var. jurana was {{described}} by Jean Boudier (1903) as a variety of the species having a brighter and more orange-colored fruit body, and with flattened or blunt-ended ascospores. Today it {{is known as the}} distinct species S.jurana. S.coccinea var. albida, named by George Edward Massee in 1903 (as Geopyxis coccinea var. albida), has a cream-colored rather than red interior surface, but is otherwise identical <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>typical</b> variety.|$|E
5|$|T.chatareus can be {{distinguished}} by their sooty colour, as opposed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>typical</b> silver of most other archerfish. They have five dorsal spines, whereas T.jaculatrix have four. The markings on their flanks are also alternating long and short spots rather than bands. T.chatareus also have six or seven markings on its sides, whilst banded archerfish have four to five. T.chatareus has 29–30 lateral line scales, compared to 33–35 in T. jaculatrix. T.chatareus are also less common upstream than T.microlepis.|$|E

According to one study, rates are lower with the atypicals at 3.9% as opposed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>typicals</b> at 5.5%. Although quetiapine and clozapine are atypical antipsychotics, switching to these atypicals {{is an option}} to minimize symptoms of tardive dyskinesia caused by other atypicals.|$|R

5|$|The Icelandic {{horse is}} a breed of horse {{developed}} in Iceland. Although the horses are small, at times pony-sized, most registries for the Icelandic {{refer to it}} as a horse. Icelandic horses are long-lived and hardy. In their native country they have few diseases; Icelandic law prevents horses from being imported into the country and exported animals are not allowed to return. The Icelandic displays two gaits in addition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>typical</b> walk, trot, and canter/gallop commonly displayed by other breeds. The only breed of horse in Iceland, they are also popular internationally, and sizable populations exist in Europe and North America. The breed is still used for traditional sheepherding work in its native country, as well as for leisure, showing, and racing.|$|E
5|$|The fruit bodies {{can last}} for some {{considerable}} time, growing slowly over a month. Mushrooms in subalpine and alpine areas are typically heavy-set with a short stipe, their growth slower in the cold climate. This latter form is seen at lower altitudes in colder seasons. Smith gave this the name forma rainierensis. Conversely, mushrooms at low altitudes, {{such as in the}} redwood forests, can grow and expand rapidly with large caps that have prominent scales. Smith described a paler form with a solid stipe from the Sierra Nevada as forma wilsonii. American mycologist R. H. Petersen described an olive-capped form that is otherwise identical <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>typical</b> form. These forms are not recognised as distinct.|$|E
5|$|The {{use of a}} {{subwoofer}} augments {{the bass}} capability of the main speakers, and allows them to be smaller without sacrificing low frequency capability. A subwoofer does not necessarily provide superior bass performance in comparison to large conventional loudspeakers on ordinary music recordings due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>typical</b> lack of very low frequency content on such sources. However, there are recordings with substantial low frequency content that most conventional loudspeakers are ill-equipped to handle {{without the help of}} a subwoofer, especially at high playback levels, such as music for pipe organs with 32' (9.75 meter) bass pipes (16Hz), very large bass drums on symphony orchestra recordings and electronic music with extremely low synth bass parts, such as bass tests or bass songs.|$|E

5|$|Despite its drawbacks, {{there are}} several {{advantages}} to using the fair catch kick. Because the defense is required to be ten yards beyond the spot of the kick, the kicker can take a running start before kicking as opposed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>typical</b> two steps taken on regular field goal attempts. Similarly, the kicker {{does not have to}} worry about a low snap because the ball is not snapped. The defense is not able to block the kick, allowing the kicker to give the ball a lower trajectory than usual. The fair catch kick would also be of a shorter distance than a normal field goal attempt from the same spot, because the fair catch kick is taken from the spot of the catch, while a typical field goal is taken seven yards back from the line of scrimmage.|$|E
5|$|In Environmental Ethics and Process Thinking, {{which was}} based on her {{doctoral}} research, Palmer explores the possibility of a process philosophy-inspired account of environmental ethics, focussing on the work of Alfred North Whitehead and Charles Hartshorne. She ultimately concludes that a process ethic is not a desirable approach to environmental questions, despite the fact that process thought has been co-opted by some environmentalist thinkers. In Animal Ethics in Context, Palmer asks about responsibilities to aid animals, in contrast <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>typical</b> focus in animal ethics on not harming animals. She defends a contextual, relational ethic according to which humans will typically have duties to assist only domestic, and not wild, animals in need. However, humans will often be permitted to assist wild animals, and may be obligated to do so if there is a particular (causal) relationship between humans and the animals' plight.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to immediate health effects, some injuries sustained during a player's career can have effects that extend to their post-career life. A cohort mortality study {{by researchers at}} the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) examined 3,349 NFL players who played at least five full seasons from 1959 to 1988. The findings from this study suggest that, in comparison <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>typical</b> American male, NFL players live longer on average but have around three times the risk of death associated with neurodegenerative disorders. In particular, the risk of death from Alzheimer's disease and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) was roughly four times higher among former players than the average American male. The study also compared mortality risks from speed players (quarterbacks, running backs, fullbacks, wide receivers, tight ends, linebackers, cornerbacks, and safeties) and nonspeed players (offensive and defensive linemen), with findings indicating that a greater number of deaths were attributable to neurodegenerative disorders in speed players than nonspeed players. This {{may be due to the}} increased momentum of collisions from speed players.|$|E

5|$|The {{embryonic}} individual of Dinocephalosaurus preserved inside LPV 30280 from Luoping can {{be identified}} as such for several reasons. First, it is enclosed entirely within the body cavity of the adult. Its cervical ribs - which are long, {{like that of the}} adult - face the same direction as the dorsal vertebrae of the adult, which is in contradiction <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>typical</b> head-first method of swallowing prey among amniotes. It is also preserved with its neck curling towards its forelimbs, a posture which is seen among vertebrate embryos but not adult Dinocephalosaurus specimens, which generally have the neck bent upwards. The absence of hands associated with the forelimbs in the embryo may be an artifact of preservation, but it may also be due to the sequence in which the limb bones of tetrapods ossify.|$|E
5|$|The plastic fairing {{ran from}} below the {{handlebars}} {{and under the}} footpegs, protecting the rider's legs from wind and road debris, as well as hiding the engine from view. This design was like the full enclosure of a scooter, but unlike a scooter the engine and gearbox unit was not fixed to the rear axle. This had several benefits. It moved the engine down {{and away from the}} seat, detaching the rear swingarm motion from the drivetrain for lower unsprung weight. It also made engine cooling air flow more direct, and made it possible to fit larger wheels. Placing the engine {{in the center of the}} frame, rather than close to the rear wheel, greatly improved front-rear balance. The fuel tank was located under the hinged seat, which opened to reveal the fuel filler inlet. The 17inch wheels, in comparison <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>typical</b> 10inch wheels of a scooter, were more stable, particularly on rough roads, and psychologically made the motorcycle more familiar, having an appearance closer to a bicycle than a small-wheel scooter.|$|E
25|$|Chlorpromazine {{tends to}} have greater effect at {{serotonin}} receptors than at D2 receptors, which is notably {{the opposite effect}} of the other typical antipsychotics. Therefore, chlorpromazine with respect to its effects on dopamine and serotonin receptors is more similar to the atypical antipsychotics than <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>typical</b> antipsychotics.|$|E
