Ethologically, the human keeper of a cat may function as a sort of surrogate for the cat's mother, and adult housecats live their lives in a kind of extended kittenhood, a form of behavioral neoteny.

5|$|The {{evening of}} April 6 was a dispiriting {{end to the}} first day of one of the bloodiest battles in American history. <b>The</b> <b>cries</b> of wounded and dying men on the fields between the armies could be heard in the Union and Confederate camps {{throughout}} the night. Exhausted Confederate soldiers bedded down in the abandoned Union camps. The Union troops were pushed back to the river and the junction of the River (Hamburg–Savannah Road) and the Corinth-Pittsburg Landing Roads. Around 10 p.m. a thunderstorm passed through the area. Coupled with the continuous shelling from the Union gunboats Lexington and Tyler, it made the night a miserable experience for both sides.|$|E
5|$|Instability and {{violence}} marked the family: it moved frequently, {{and much of}} Lépine's early childhood was spent in Costa Rica and Puerto Rico, where his father was working for a Swiss mutual funds company. The family returned to Montreal permanently in 1968, shortly before a stock market crash led {{to the loss of}} much of the family's assets. Rachid was an authoritarian, possessive and jealous man, frequently violent towards his wife and his children. He had contempt for women and believed that they were intended only to serve men. He required his wife to act as his personal secretary, slapping her if she made any errors in typing, and forcing her to retype documents in spite of <b>the</b> <b>cries</b> of their toddler. He was also neglectful and abusive towards his children, particularly his son, and discouraged any tenderness, as he considered it spoiling. In 1970, following an incident in which Rachid struck Gamil so hard that the marks on his face were visible a week later, his mother decided to leave. The legal separation was finalized in 1971, and the divorce in 1976. Following the separation, Gamil lived with his mother and younger sister Nadia; soon after, their home and possessions were seized when Rachid defaulted on mortgage payments. Gamil was afraid of his father, and at first saw him on weekly supervised visits. The visits ended quickly, as Rachid ceased contact with his children soon after the separation. Gamil never again saw his father, and in the future refused to discuss him with others.|$|E

40|$|Several crystal (Cry) {{proteins}} {{are known}} to occur as DNA-protein complexes. However, {{the role of the}} DNA associated with the activated toxin in the mechanism of action of <b>the</b> <b>Cry</b> toxin has long been ignored. Here, we focused on <b>the</b> DNA-activated <b>Cry</b> toxin complex. Both forms of <b>the</b> <b>Cry</b> 8 Ca 2 and Cry 8 Ea 1 toxins, i. e., with or without bound DNA, were separately obtained. Size-exclusion chromatography analysis indicated that <b>the</b> <b>Cry</b> 8 Ca 2 toxin-DNA complex has a tight or compact structure. <b>The</b> <b>Cry</b> 8 Ca 2 toxin-DNA complex is more likely to move toward the air/water interface and is more hydrophobic than the toxin without DNA. Competitive binding assays indicated that <b>the</b> <b>Cry</b> 8 Ca 2 and Cry 8 Ea 1 toxins without DNA specifically bind to the midgut of Anomala corpulenta and Holotrichia parallela larvae, respectively. In contrast, the association of DNA with each toxin might result in the nonspecific recognition of <b>the</b> <b>Cry</b> toxin and its target receptor in the insect midgut. The association of the DNA fragment with <b>the</b> <b>Cry</b> 8 toxin was shown to protect <b>the</b> <b>Cry</b> protein from digestion by proteases. Based on our results, we propose an additional step in the mechanism of action of <b>the</b> <b>Cry</b> 8 toxin and elucidate the function of the associated DNA as well as the importance of the removal of this DNA for the insecticidal activity of the toxin...|$|R
5|$|The year 1912 saw {{a marked}} {{increase}} in militant action in Wales. Anger at {{the defeat of}} the Conciliation Bills saw the WPSU disrupt a speech by Lloyd George at the Pavilion in Caernarfon. The protesters, male and female, were treated harshly with clothes torn and hair ripped out and were beaten by sticks and umbrellas. Later that year Lloyd George was again heckled by suffragettes whilst delivering a speech at the National Eisteddfod. Just two weeks later {{one of the most notorious}} events in the history of suffrage in Wales took place, when Lloyd George returned to his home town of Llanystumdwy to open the village hall. No sooner had he started speaking than he was interrupted by <b>the</b> <b>cries</b> of 'Votes for Women!' The hecklers were violently assaulted by the crowd. One was stripped to the waist before being rescued and another was almost thrown off a bridge to be dashed on the rocks of the River Dwyfor below. As trouble was anticipated the national press was present and the Daily Mirror and Illustrated London News devoted a full page of photographs to the incident. The local press not only attacked the suffragettes, but poured scorn on the crowd for tarnishing the image of a peaceful, Nonconformist, chapel-going Wales. The event is seen as the most dramatic event in the history of Women's suffrage in Wales.|$|E
5|$|A {{high-level}} {{delegation of}} the Soviet Central Committee flew to Poland {{in an attempt}} to block removing pro-Soviet members of Politburo mainly Soviet and Polish Marshal Konstantin Rokossovsky. Soviet delegation was led by Nikita Khrushchev and included Anastas Mikoyan, Nikolai Bulganin, Vyacheslav Molotov, Lazar Kaganovich, Ivan Konev, and others. The negotiations were tense; both Polish and Soviet troops were put on alert, engaged in 'manoeuvres', and were used as thinly veiled threats. The Polish leadership {{made it clear that the}} face of communism had to become more nationalized; no longer could the Soviet Union directly control the Polish people. Here, Khrushchev's speech worked against him. During Stalinism, the Soviet Union had placed Moscow-friendly Poles, or Russians themselves, in important political positions in Poland. After denouncing Stalinism so vehemently in his speech, Khrushchev could not regress to the Stalinist position by forcing more Russians into the Polish leadership. The Poles, in recognizing <b>the</b> <b>cries</b> of the public, needed to keep the Soviets from direct control but could not raise their demands to a point that endangered their relationships in the bloc. Gomułka demanded increased autonomy and permission to carry out some reforms but also reassured the Soviets that the reforms were internal matters and that Poland had no intention of abandoning communism or its treaties with the Soviet Union. The Soviets were also pressured by the Chinese to accommodate the Polish demands and were increasingly distracted by the events in Hungary. Eventually, when Khrushchev was reassured that Gomułka would not alter the basic foundations of Polish communism, he withdrew the invasion threat and agreed to compromise, and Gomułka was confirmed in his new position.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>cry</b> gene {{content of}} Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. aizawai HD- 133 was {{analyzed}} {{by a combination}} of high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) and exclusive PCR. A total of six cry genes were detected in genomic DNA purified from HD- 133, four from <b>the</b> <b>cry</b> 1 family (cry 1 Aa, cry 1 Ab, cry 1 C, and cry 1 D) as well as a gene each from <b>the</b> <b>cry</b> 2 (cry 2 B) and <b>the</b> <b>cry</b> 1 I families. To directly determine which genes were expressed and crystallized in the purified parasporal inclusions, solubilized and trypsinized HD- 133 crystals were subjected to chromatographic separation by HPLC. Only three proteins, Cry 1 Ab, Cry 1 C, and Cry 1 D, were found, in a 60 / 37 / 3 ratio. Dot blot analysis of total mRNA purified from HD- 133 showed that both <b>the</b> <b>cry</b> 2 B and cry 1 I genes, but not <b>the</b> <b>cry</b> 1 Aa gene, were transcribed. Cloning and sequencing of <b>the</b> <b>cry</b> 1 Aa gene revealed an inserted DNA sequence within <b>the</b> <b>cry</b> coding sequence, resulting in a disrupted reading frame. Taken together, our results show that combining crystal protein analysis with a genetic approach is a highly complementary and powerful way to assess the potential of B. thuringiensis isolates for new insecticidal genes and specificities. Furthermore, {{based on the number of}} cryptic genes found in HD- 133, <b>the</b> total <b>cry</b> gene content of B. thuringiensis strains may be higher than previously thought...|$|R
