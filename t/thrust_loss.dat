25|$|Lavochkin had {{produced}} {{a line of}} prop powered fighters in World War II. The Lavochkin La-150 was its first response to a 1945 order to build a single-seat jet fighter using a single German Junkers Jumo 004 turbojet from the Me-262 which first flew in September 1946. The Lavochkin La-152 which flew in December 1946 moved the engine {{to the front of}} the nose, which reduced <b>thrust</b> <b>loss.</b> The Lavochkin La-160 was the first Soviet fighter to apply swept wings, and flew in June 1947.|$|E
500|$|F-84G: Single-seat {{fighter-bomber}} {{capable of}} delivering the Mark 7 nuclear bomb using the LABS, J35-A-29 engine, autopilot, capable of inflight refueling using both the boom (receptacle in left wing leading edge) and drogue (probe fitted to wingtip fuel tanks), introduced the multi-framed canopy which was later retrofitted to earlier straight-winged F-84s. A total of 3,025 were built (1,936 for NATO under MDAP). The larger engine {{had a higher}} airflow at its take-off thrust than the intake had been designed for. This caused higher flow velocities, increased pressure losses and <b>thrust</b> <b>loss.</b> Commencing with block 20, auxiliary [...] "suck-in" [...] doors were added ahead of the wing leading edge to regain some of the <b>thrust</b> <b>loss.</b> At high engine rpm and low aircraft speeds, such as take-off, the spring-loaded doors were sucked open by the partial vacuum created in the duct. When the aircraft reached sufficient airspeed the ram pressure rise in the duct closed the auxiliary doors. F-84G 51-1343 was modified with a periscope system to test the periscope installation proposed for the Republic XF-103.|$|E
50|$|Another {{consideration}} may {{relate to}} the required nozzle cooling flow. The divergent flaps or petals have to be isolated from the AB flame temperature, which may be {{of the order of}} 3,600 degF, by a layer of cooling air. A longer divergence means more area to be cooled. The <b>thrust</b> <b>loss</b> from incomplete expansion is traded against the benefits of less cooling flow. This applied to the TF-30 nozzle in the F-14A where the ideal area ratio at Mn2.4 was limited to a lower value.|$|E
40|$|The main {{motivation}} {{behind this}} thesis is {{to study the}} effects from different <b>thrust</b> <b>losses</b> on an underwater snake robot (USR) with thrusters. In-line velocity fluctuations, transverse velocity fluctuations, thruster-thruster interactions, thruster-hull interactions, thurster-nearby structure interactions and ventilation are studied. First, an extensive literature study is done for the modeling of underwater snake robots with and without thrusters, propeller characteristics and <b>thrust</b> <b>losses.</b> In-line and transverse velocity fluctuations are simulated in MATLAB. It is shown that the smaller the model is and the higher the shaft speed is, the bigger the <b>thrust</b> <b>losses</b> become. In-line velocity fluctuations are present as long as thrust is given from {{at least one of}} the thrusters, while transverse velocity fluctuations are present as long as there is a normal velocity component close to the thruster. The influence of the $K_T$-value (non-dimensional thrust coefficient) is also studied. A smaller $K_T$-value, gives a larger effect from the <b>thrust</b> <b>losses.</b> By adding current it is shown that the current changes the velocities in the x- and y-directions of the robot, which leads to the <b>thrust</b> <b>losses</b> increasing or decreasing in the respective directions. Observations are done using the USR at Eelume %in order to do observations to study the rest of the <b>thrust</b> <b>losses.</b> When the configuration is as given in this thesis, the effects from the thruster-thruster interactions, thruster-hull interactions and thurster-nearby structure interactions seem to be negligible. Ventilation is present when the USR is near the water surface...|$|R

The measured data were analyzed {{as a function of}} a number of parameters. The most sensitive parameters were the amount of compensation of the accelerator grid and the ratio of net to total accelerating voltage.

50|$|The engine had {{variable}} {{inlet guide}} vanes, as used on many other engines, necessary for accelerating from idle to high thrust. However, on the Gyron Junior, {{positioning of the}} vanes was not reliable and could cause surging which, in turn, could prevent accelerating to higher thrust levels. A possibly unique feature on this engine was valve-controlled cooling air to the turbine blades. The engine had to supply air for the aircraft's boundary layer control system and the resulting <b>thrust</b> <b>loss</b> was unacceptable. To regain the thrust the turbine temperature limit was raised by using turbine blade cooling, selected only with blowing on.|$|E
5000|$|In {{common with}} other VTOL aircraft, the Short SC.1 {{suffered}} from vertical <b>thrust</b> <b>loss</b> {{due to the}} ground effect. Research into this performed on scale models suggested that for the SC.1 these losses would be between 15 per cent and 20 per cent at undercarriage height. Fuel tanks were located along the wing leading edges and in [...] "bag" [...] tanks fitted between the main wing spars. The SC.1 was fitted with a tricycle undercarriage arrangement; while non-retracting, the landing gear could be set between two alternative positions, suited to either conventional and vertical landings. The fixed undercarriage legs were designed specifically for vertical flight; each leg carried a pair of head-resistant castoring wheels, while the rear undercarriage was also fitted with disc brakes. Long-stroke oleos were used to cushion vertical landings. The robust gear was able to withstand a descent rate of 18 ft (5.5m) per second.|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{investigations}} {{of the effects of}} swirling the jet exhausts of small turbofan and turbojet engines have indicated significant progress towards predicting and attaining substantial jet noise abatement with minimum <b>thrust</b> <b>losses</b> in large aircraft engines. Systematic variations of the important swirl vane and swirling flow parameters were conducted to determine their effects on jet noise reduction and engine performance. Since swirling flow becomes more effective in reducing jet noise as the density and temperature gradients increase, the significant trends in noise reduction and engine performance that were established by these parametric studies could be projected into potentially greater reductions of sound pressure levels with minimum <b>thrust</b> <b>losses</b> by controlled swirling of the jets of high thrust engines. The density and temperature gradients in the jet exhausts of high thrust engines are larger by comparison with gradients in small engines...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{experimental}} work {{has shown that}} measured resistojet thrust decreases from that obtained at hard vacuum conditions as the test-cell pressure rises above 0. 001 torr. <b>Thrust</b> <b>losses</b> have been observed for both cold and heated flow conditions, and the most significant losses have been experienced using thrusters with low Reynolds number flow and high area ratio nozzles. In order to further investigate nozzle flow characteristics, a pressure probe having four degrees of freedom {{has been used to}} obtain stagnation pressure surveys across the nozzle exit planes of four resistojets. The surveys show a change in the ratio of the supersonic core to the viscous boundary layer flow areas as the test-cell pressure increases. The surveys are also used for detecting whether an oblique shock is present in an overexpanded nozzle flow. Thruster temperature measurements and nozzle exit plane pressure surveys indicate that <b>thrust</b> <b>losses</b> are the combined result of convection heat losses and nozzle flow momentum effects...|$|R
40|$|In {{extreme weather}} conditions, {{thrusters}} on ships and rigs {{may be subject}} to severe <b>thrust</b> <b>losses</b> caused by ventilation and in-and-out-of-water events. When a thruster ventilates, air is sucked down from the surface and into the propeller. In more severe cases, parts of or even the whole propeller can be out of the water. These losses vary rapidly with time and cause increased wear and tear in addition to reduced thruster performance. In this paper, a thrust allocation strategy is proposed to reduce the effects of <b>thrust</b> <b>losses</b> and to reduce the possibility of multiple ventilation events. This thrust allocation strategy is named antispin thrust allocation, based on the analogous behavior of antispin wheel control of cars. The proposed thrust allocation strategy is important for improving the life span of the propulsion system and the accuracy of positioning for vessels conducting station keeping in terms of dynamic positioning or thruster-assisted position mooring. Application of this strategy can result in an increase of operational time and, thus, increased profitability. The performance of the proposed allocation strategy is demonstrated with experiments on a model ship...|$|R
50|$|The Vostok {{spacecraft}} utilized {{an ejector}} seat {{to bail out}} the cosmonaut {{in the event of}} a low-altitude launch failure, as well as during reentry, however it was likely ineffective in the first 20 seconds after liftoff when the altitude would be too low for the parachute to deploy. Inspired by the Mercury LES, Soviet designers began work on a similar system in 1962. This included developing a complex sensing system to monitor various launch vehicle parameters and trigger an abort if a booster malfunction occurred. Based on data from R-7 launches over the years, engineers developed a list of the most likely failure modes for the vehicle and could narrow down abort conditions to premature separation of a strap-on booster, low engine <b>thrust,</b> <b>loss</b> of combustion chamber pressure, or loss of booster guidance. The Spacecraft Abort System (SAS; Система Аварийного Спасения) could also be manually activated from the ground, but unlike American spacecraft, there was no way for the cosmonauts to trigger it themselves.|$|E
40|$|The main {{objectives}} in this master's thesis is to investigate how the Coanda effect influences a thruster jet which further causes a <b>thrust</b> <b>loss.</b> The tendency of a thruster slipstream to be deflected towards a nearby surface, for most practical situations {{the hull of}} a vessel, is called the Coanda effect {{and is likely to}} produce a significant <b>thrust</b> <b>loss</b> under certain geometric conditions. The approach in this master's thesis is to perform an experiment measuring the direct <b>thrust</b> <b>loss</b> related to the deflection of the slipstream. Results from the experiment are presented along with comparisons with similar experimental results and predicted results acquired from mathematical model. The mathematical model has proven accurate in predicting the deflection of the thruster jet. Results show that both distances from the thruster to the hull have an influence on the results, and in particular the tilting of the thruster nozzle. The greatest <b>thrust</b> <b>loss</b> measured in the experiment is approximately 25 % loss, which during for example critical offshore operations is significant and may lead to dangerous situations. Variations in thrust force, however, do not represent <b>thrust</b> <b>loss</b> variations according to the experimental results within the specified thrust range. Increasing the distance between thruster and hull bottom reduces the <b>thrust</b> <b>loss</b> with approximately 5 %. By tilting the thruster downwards 7. 5 o one can reduce the <b>thrust</b> <b>loss</b> due to Coanda effect with approximately 10 - 15 %. Analyses show that tilting the thruster farther than 7. 5 o does not result in a reduced <b>thrust</b> <b>loss,</b> and is not advised as a counter measure for the Coanda effect. </p...|$|E

The experiments involved making fan air flow convergently around the high velocity core jet with a small angle. Ring airfoils were used as flow separators for the minimization of the <b>thrust</b> <b>loss.</b> Jet exhaust noise reduction of ll db at 30 deg from the jet axis was recorded and 8 db integrated overall noise reduction over a hemisphere was measured with only 4. 6 % <b>thrust</b> <b>loss,</b> or 152 db/percent <b>thrust</b> <b>loss...</b>|$|E

40|$|A multiaxis thrust-vectoring nozzle {{designed}} to have equal ow-turning capability in {{pitch and yaw}} was conceived and experimentally tested for internal static performance at Langley Research Center. The cruciform-shaped, convergent-divergent nozzle turned the ow for thrust vectoring by de ecting the divergent surfaces of the nozzle, called aps. Methods for eliminating physical interference between pitch and yaw aps at the larger multiaxis de ection angles were studied. These methods included restricting the pitch aps from {{the path of the}} yaw aps and shifting the ow path at the throat o the nozzle centerline to permit larger pitch- ap de ections without interfering with the operation of the yaw aps. Two ap widths were tested at both dry and afterburning power settings. Vertical- and reverse-thrust con gurations at dry power were also tested. Despite the complex internal geometry, this cruciform nozzle had only slightly lower unvectored thrust e ciency than existing axisymmetric and nonaxisymmetric nozzle designs. <b>Thrust</b> <b>losses</b> in singleaxis <b>thrust</b> vectoring were primarily the result of complex ow interactions between shearing ows within the nozzle. Splitting the ow, a consequence of the cruciform cross section, caused these interactions. <b>Thrust</b> <b>losses</b> in multiaxis <b>thrust</b> vectoring were primarily the result of turning supersonic ow. More equal pitch and yaw thrust-vector angles were achieved by the nozzle with narrow divergent aps than by the nozzle with wide divergent aps. However, the narrow- ap nozzle had <b>thrust</b> <b>losses</b> 1 to 2 percent higher than those of the wide- ap nozzle. The shifted-throat nozzle design had larger thrust-vector angles at the nozzle pressure ratio of peak resultant thrust e ciency than the restrictedap nozzle design but had 1. 5 - to 2. 0 -percent-lower peak thrust performance.

40|$|The NASA Glenn Research Center {{recently}} completed an experimental study {{to reduce the}} jet noise from modern turbofan engines. The study concentrated on exhaust nozzle designs for high-bypass-ratio engines. These designs modified the core and fan nozzles individually and simultaneously. Several designs provided an ideal jet noise reduction of over 2. 5 EPNdB for the effective perceived noise level (EPNL) metric. Noise data, after correcting for takeoff thrust losses, indicated over a 2. 0 -EPNdB reduction for nine designs. Individually modifying the fan nozzle did not provide attractive EPNL reductions. Designs in which only the core nozzle was modified provided greater EPNL reductions. Designs in which core and fan nozzles were modified simultaneously provided the greatest EPNL reduction. The best nozzle design had a 2. 7 -EPNdB reduction (corrected for takeoff <b>thrust</b> <b>loss)</b> with a 0. 06 -point cruise <b>thrust</b> <b>loss.</b> This design simultaneously employed chevrons on the core and fan nozzles.

Flow blockage from tabs did not scale directly with cruise <b>thrust</b> <b>loss</b> and the interaction between fan flow and the core nozzle seemed to strongly affect noise and cruise performance.
