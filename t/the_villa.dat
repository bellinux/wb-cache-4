5|$|In December 1979, the Marquesa Margaret Rockefeller de Larrain, {{granddaughter of}} John D. Rockefeller, gave <b>the</b> <b>Villa</b> Le Balze to Georgetown University. <b>The</b> <b>Villa</b> is in Fiesole, Italy, {{on a hill}} above the city of Florence. <b>The</b> <b>Villa</b> is used year-round for study abroad {{programs}} focused on specialized interdisciplinary study of Italian culture and civilization. The main facility for the McGhee Center for Eastern Mediterranean Studies was donated to Georgetown in 1989 by alumnus and former United States Ambassador to Turkey George C. McGhee. The school is {{in the town of}} Alanya, Turkey within the Seljuq-era Alanya Castle, on the Mediterranean. The Center operates study abroad programs one semester each year, concentrating on Turkish language, architectural history, and Islamic studies.|$|E
5|$|Aston Villa Football Club {{were formed}} in March 1874, {{by members of}} <b>the</b> <b>Villa</b> Cross Wesleyan Chapel in Handsworth which {{is now part of}} Birmingham. The four founders of Aston Villa were Jack Hughes, Frederick Matthews, Walter Price and William Scattergood. Aston Villa's first match was against the local Aston Brook St Mary's Rugby team. As a {{condition}} of the match, <b>the</b> <b>Villa</b> side had to agree to play the first half under Rugby rules and the second half under Association rules. After moving to the Wellington Road ground in 1876, Villa soon established themselves {{as one of the best}} teams in the Midlands, winning their first honour, the Birmingham Senior Cup in 1880, under the captaincy of Scotsman George Ramsay.|$|E

This area was incorporated into <b>the</b> <b>Villa</b> de San Cristóbal district, also including Chamula, Chiapan, and Zinacantán.

50|$|Most {{dating from}} 1851-55, <b>The</b> <b>Villas</b> was {{designed}} by local architect Charles Lynam, who became a prominent architect in Staffordshire, building the Minton Hollins tileworks, for example.

5|$|Chanel {{bought the}} five acre plot on which La Pausa {{was built for}} 1.8 million French francs in February 1929. The plot had {{formerly}} {{been part of the}} hunting grounds of the ruling family of Monaco, the Grimaldis, and contained wild olive and orange groves. <b>The</b> <b>villa</b> was built less than a year later. The final cost of <b>the</b> <b>villa</b> was 6 million francs, a large sum for the time. It is not clear whether Chanel or her lover, Hugh Grosvenor, 2nd Duke of Westminster financed the building and furnishing of La Pausa. La Pausa was built by architect Robert Streitz, who sought to build 'the ideal Mediterranean villa'.|$|E

5|$|Palladio deeply {{considered}} the dual purpose of his villas as both farmhouses and palatial weekend retreats for wealthy merchant owners. These symmetrical temple-like houses often have equally symmetrical, but low, wings sweeping {{away from them}} to accommodate horses, farm animals, and agricultural stores. The wings, sometimes detached and connected to <b>the</b> <b>villa</b> by colonnades, were designed not only to be functional but also to complement and accentuate <b>the</b> <b>villa.</b> They were, however, in no way intended {{to be part of}} the main house, and it is in the design and use of these wings that Palladio's followers in the 18th century adapted to become an integral part of the building.|$|E
40|$|People {{who live}} in <b>the</b> <b>villas</b> (i. e., slums) of Buenos Aires are confronted with poverty, poor and {{dangerous}} living conditions, and discrimination. Ten weeks were spent in <b>the</b> <b>villas</b> delivering {{a program designed to}} enhance life satisfaction and self-worth through games and the development of mental skills. The {{purpose of this paper is}} not to report on the content or the effectiveness of the program, but rather to explore the variables within Argentina and <b>the</b> <b>villas</b> as well as my own cultural biases that may have influenced the delivery of a psychological intervention program. Argentine factors include a high prevalence of psychologists and a psychoanalytic focus. Characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>villas</b> include environmental factors (e. g., transportation issues, sanitation), logistical issues (e. g., venues, access to writing implements), and psychological matters (e. g., hopelessness, different perceptions of confidence). Practitioner concerns included limited familiarity with life in <b>the</b> <b>villas</b> and having values that might be different from those of the participants. The discussion includes recommendations for others who are considering working in similar cultural and contextual situations...|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>villas</b> {{range from}} {{small groups of}} {{precarious}} houses to larger, more organized communities with thousands of residents. In rural areas, the houses in <b>the</b> <b>villas</b> miserias might be made of mud and wood. Villas miseria are found around and inside the large cities of Buenos Aires, Rosario, Córdoba and Mendoza, among others. <b>The</b> <b>villas</b> draw people from several backgrounds. Some are local citizens who have fallen from an already precarious economic position.

5|$|In 1877 during {{construction}} of the Durley Hill Cemetery, {{the remains of a}} grand Roman villa with over 30 rooms was discovered. However, {{construction of the}} cemetery went ahead, and the majority of <b>the</b> <b>villa</b> is now located beneath the Victorian cemetery and an adjacent road. The cemetery was expanded in 1922, and an archeological dig was carried out ahead of the interments, leading to the excavation of 17 rooms and the rescue of 10 elaborate mosaics.|$|E
5|$|On 25 October 1723, {{six days}} before his death, Cosimo III {{distributed}} a final proclamation commanding that Tuscany shall stay independent; Anna Maria Luisa shall succeed uninhibited after Gian Gastone; the Grand Duke reserves {{the right to choose}} his successor. Unfortunately for Cosimo, Europe completely ignored it. Gian Gastone, now the Grand Duke, and Anna Maria Luisa were not on good terms. He despised the Electress for engineering his unhappy marriage with Anna Maria Franziska of Saxe-Lauenburg, while she detested his liberal policies: he repealed all of his father's anti-Semitic statutes and revelled in upsetting her. Consequently, the Electress was compelled to abandon her apartment in the left wing of the royal palace, the Pitti, for <b>the</b> <b>Villa</b> La Quiete. She refurbished La Quiete's house and gardens with the assistance of Sebastiano Rapi, the gardener of the Boboli Gardens, and the architects Giovanni Battista Foggini and Paolo Giovanozzi. In the period 1722–1725, the Electress embellished <b>the</b> <b>villa</b> further by commissioning twelve statues of various religious figures.|$|E

Robert's villa manager, Maurice (Walter Slezak), converts <b>the</b> <b>villa</b> into a hotel while Robert is away. <b>The</b> <b>villa</b> is now occupied by a group of young American girls trying to fend off a gang of boys, led by Tony (Bobby Darin).
