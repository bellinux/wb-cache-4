He left the club {{at the end}} of his contract in 2014 and returned to the Premier League with West Bromwich Albion, where he featured rarely and had an unsuccessful loan to Al-Hilal in Saudi Arabia. In March 2016, he joined North American Soccer League expansion team Rayo OKC, and when <b>they</b> <b>shut</b> down after one season he signed for Real Zaragoza.|$|E
5|$|A $70 million {{renovation}} of airport facilities, designed by Brubaker, Brandt Inc., was initiated in 1979 for the airport's 50th anniversary and completed in 1981. This upgraded the airport's capacity to 250 flights per day by adding {{what is known}} today as Concourse B and added fully enclosed jetways at every gate. Ten years later in 1989, a second, $15.5 million, seven-gate south concourse (now Concourse A) was dedicated. The concourse was used exclusively by US Airways at the time, and later housed hubs for both America West Airlines until 2003, and Skybus Airlines until <b>they</b> <b>shut</b> it down in 2008 due to their bankruptcy. A north concourse was completed in 1996, which is now Concourse C, and was expanded in 2002.|$|E
5|$|The {{work done}} on the film to date was nearly lost in 1998 {{when one of the}} animators, while {{routinely}} clearing some files, accidentally started a deletion of the root folder of the Toy Story 2 assets on Pixar's internal servers. Associate technical director Oren Jacobs {{was one of the first}} to notice as character models disappeared from their works in progress. <b>They</b> <b>shut</b> down the file servers but had lost 90% of the last two years of work, and the backups were found to have failed some time previously. The film was saved when technical director Galyn Susman, who had been working from home to take care of her newborn child, revealed she had backups of the assets on her home computer. The Pixar team was able to recover nearly all of the lost assets save for a few recent days of work, allowing the film to proceed.|$|E

25|$|The {{economic}} downturn of 1937–38, and the bitter {{split between the}} AFL and CIO labor unions led to major Republican gains in Congress in 1938. Conservative Republicans and Democrats in Congress joined in the informal Conservative Coalition. By 1942–43 <b>they</b> <b>shut</b> down relief {{programs such as the}} WPA and Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) and blocked major liberal proposals.

25|$|In {{contrast}} to the league-wide offensive explosion, the Seahawks fielded {{one of the best}} defenses in league history in 2013. Perhaps the best performance of the season for the Seahawks defense occurred in Week 15 as <b>they</b> <b>shut</b> out the Giants 23–0. In the game, the Seahawks intercepted five passes and forced the Giants to punt on all eight of their other possessions. The Giants' offense was held to just 181 yards for the game.|$|E

Two of the men stood near the doorway with their weapons, and Hodges' weapon {{came into contact with}} Girty's chest causing him, and his group, to retreat into the woods. Young Dimmick, anxious to the point of begging to leave, was then dispatched to Hennepin by horseback for help. The men at the cabin expected Dimmick to be shot as soon as he rode off, but he crossed the open prairie unscathed. Dimmick made the 16 mile (25.7km) journey and arrived in Hennepin to report the attack.|$|E
25|$|People with BPD {{are also}} {{especially}} sensitive {{to feelings of}} rejection, criticism, isolation, and perceived failure. Before learning other coping mechanisms, their efforts to manage or escape from their very negative emotions may lead to emotional isolation, self-injury or suicidal behavior. They are often aware of the intensity of their negative emotional reactions and, since they cannot regulate them, <b>they</b> <b>shut</b> them down entirely. This can be harmful to people with BPD, since negative emotions alert people {{to the presence of}} a problematic situation and move them to address it which the person with BPD would normally be aware of only to cause further distress. People with BPD may feel emotional relief after cutting themselves.|$|E
25|$|The debris {{ejected from}} the {{airplane}} during the explosive decompression damaged the Number 3 and 4 engines causing visible fires in both. The crew did not get fire warnings from either engine. Engine 3 was experiencing heavy vibration, no N1 reading, and a low EGT and EPR, so the crew shut it down. At 02:20, an emergency was declared and the crew began dumping fuel to reduce the aircraft's landing weight. Initially, the pilots pushed the Number 4 engine slightly, but they noticed that its N1 reading was almost zero, its EGT reading was high, and it was emitting flames, so <b>they</b> <b>shut</b> it down as well. Some of the explosively ejected debris damaged the right wing's leading edge, dented the horizontal stabilizer on that side, and damaged the vertical stabilizer.|$|E

25|$|Fort Wayne being {{equidistant}} from Chicago, Detroit and Cincinnati, clear-channel WOWO {{competed with}} WLS, WJR, and WLW for the agricultural market. Farmers {{would have the}} radio turned on in the milking parlor; research seemed to indicated that it relaxed the cows and produced more milk. In an era when live music was the rule, {{rather than the exception}} on the radio, WOWO's Nancy Lee and the Hilltoppers proved popular with rural audiences, and eventually WLS, WJR and WLW surrendered the rural audience to concentrate on their urban audiences, leaving WOWO unchallenged for the rural market, and giving them the largest audience of any Fort Wayne area station for decades, until FM stations largely displaced AM stations. WOWO could be heard as far away as Florida, especially {{early in the morning and}} late at night and many snowbirds listened to WOWO year-around. <b>They</b> <b>shut</b> down the transmitter on Sunday nights, giving Philadelphia station WCAU at 1210 AM a slight ratings boost as sleepless WOWO listeners sought something to listen to.|$|E
25|$|The 1960 Gophers {{came to the}} Rose Bowl as the #1 team in the nation, {{and were}} favored by a {{touchdown}} over Washington. The Gophers were led by Sandy Stephens, the first African-American All-American starting quarterback at the school (but not {{in the history of}} the Rose Bowl, which would have been the 1922 Rose Bowl). The Gophers had an early 2614 non-conference win at #12 Nebraska. <b>They</b> <b>shut</b> out both Indiana and Northwestern, then also blanked Michigan 100 at Michigan Stadium to win the Little Brown Jug. A win over non-conference Kansas State put Minnesota at #3. The next game at #1 Iowa was one of the most notable games in the Floyd of Rosedale rivalry. Minnesota won 2710 (and the pig) and were top-ranked, but then lost to Purdue the next week. A 2614 win over Wisconsin on NCAA television put them back at #1 to finish the season. The Gophers were tied with Iowa in the Big Ten standings, each with a loss. The final AP poll of November 29 was one of the closest ever: Minnesota with 17½ first-place votes, Mississippi 16, and Iowa 12½.|$|E
25|$|The Dodgers {{dropped their}} third {{straight}} on the opener {{of a road}} series against the New York Mets, 6–3 as Jason Pridie hit a three-run homer off Kuorda with two outs in the sixth inning. Ethier's hitting streak finally ended on May 7, when he went 0 for 4 against the Mets. He finished with a 30-game hitting streak, second most in Dodgers history behind the 31 game streak by Willie Davis in 1969. The game was doubly disappointing as the Dodgers losing streak hit 4 with a 4–2 loss. Clayton Kershaw pitched 6 2/3 strong innings and Andre Ethier hit a two-run homer to end the losing streak with a 4–2 win. The Dodgers road woes continued on May 9, when Manager Don Mattingly and third baseman Juan Uribe were both ejected after a bad umpire call in the eighth and the Pirates scored three runs in the next half inning to beat the Dodgers 4–1. The Dodgers picked up a big win the next day as Matt Kemp broke open a scoreless tie with a three-run homer in the sixth inning and the Dodgers offense took off for a 10–3 win. The Dodgers {{took the lead in}} the series on May 11 as <b>they</b> <b>shut</b> out the Pirates 2–0 thanks to an excellent start by Hiroki Kuroda, who struck out eight in seven innings. The Dodgers finale against the Pirates was called off due to rain after two innings with the Dodgers leading 1–0. The game would eventually be made up on September 1.|$|E

500|$|In 1940, the Priest Barracks of Dachau Concentration Camp was established. Of 2,720 clergy imprisoned at Dachau, the {{overwhelming}} majority (94.88 percent) were Catholic. According to Ian Kershaw, about 400 German priests {{were sent to the}} camp.
