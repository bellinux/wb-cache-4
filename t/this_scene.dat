5|$|Clerici {{also wrote}} several scenes {{that did not}} make the film's final cut. One of which {{depicted}} a group of Ya̧nomamö cutting off the leg of a Shamatari warrior and feeding him to piranhas in the river. <b>This</b> <b>scene</b> was to take place directly after Monroe's team rescues a smaller group of Ya̧nomamö from the Shamatari. Attempts were made to film <b>this</b> <b>scene,</b> but the underwater camera did not operate properly, and the piranha were difficult to control. As a result, Deodato abandoned his efforts, and still photographs taken during the scene are its only known depiction.|$|E
5|$|For {{the scene}} in which Ash is {{revealed}} to be an android, a puppet was created of the character's torso and upper body which was operated from underneath. During a preview screening of the film, <b>this</b> <b>scene</b> caused an usher to faint. In the following scene, Ash's head is placed on a table and re-activated; for portions of <b>this</b> <b>scene,</b> an animatronic head was made using a face cast of the actor, Ian Holm. However, the latex of the head shrank while curing {{and the result was}} not entirely convincing. For the bulk of the scene, Holm knelt under the table with his head coming up through a hole. Milk, caviar, pasta, fiber optics, and glass marbles were combined to form the android's innards.|$|E
5|$|In Orson Welles's {{film version}} of Macbeth (1948), Fleance is briefly seen again {{at the very end}} of the movie. He does not speak in <b>this</b> <b>scene,</b> but he has {{returned}} to Scotland with the army of Malcolm and Macduff, and is shown along with those hailing Malcolm as the new king after the killing of Macbeth.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} episode when Steve Owen pulls over Susie Money, when she hands him her license, one can {{momentarily}} see the birth date {{on the back of}} the card; it shows her birth year as 1984. Being that it is 1995 at the time of <b>this</b> <b>scene,</b> that would make her 11 years old.|$|E
5|$|Many {{elements}} can {{be considered}} as tributes to the power of cinema. In the prison theater, the inmates watch the film Gilda (1946), but <b>this</b> <b>scene</b> was originally intended to feature The Lost Weekend (1945). The interchangeability of the films used in the prison theater suggests that it is the cinematic experience and not the subject which is key to the scene, allowing the men to escape the reality of their situation. Immediately following <b>this</b> <b>scene,</b> Andy is assaulted by the Sisters in the projector room and uses a film reel to help fight them off. Then in the end of the film, Andy passes through a movie poster to escape his cell and ultimately Shawshank.|$|E
5|$|One scene {{right before}} Riddler and Two-face team up {{featured}} a little conversation with Dick and Bruce {{in the gym}} of the manor. This would explain why Dick suddenly has martial arts training. <b>This</b> <b>scene</b> appears in a rough edit on the Special Edition DVD.|$|E

5|$|Sugar and Spice, {{played by}} Drew Barrymore and Debi Mazar, try out the Riddler's device during the montage {{when it goes}} on sale. They are seated with the Riddler and Two-Face on the couch where Chase is handcuffed later in the film. <b>This</b> <b>scene</b> appears in the comic {{adaptation}} {{but not in the}} final film.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea behind}} the shock therapy scene was based on Laurel and Hardy {{throwing}} pies at each other. The scene was rearranged in the editing room; it played out differently when first produced. The edits to <b>this</b> <b>scene</b> were preliminary, but well-received, and remained unchanged in the finished product.|$|E
5|$|A {{circular}} {{hole was}} {{cut into the}} backdrop {{and covered with a}} transparent material. A strong light behind this hole represented the moon. The light was occasionally manipulated to suggest the passage of clouds. Gautier and St. Georges wanted the pool to be made of large mirrors but Pillet rejected this idea because of its cost. In the 1868 revival, however, mirrors were acquired for <b>this</b> <b>scene.</b>|$|E

5|$|After brief {{footage of}} a tank driving across a desert {{landscape}} {{a baby is}} shown playing with a paper aeroplane. A hat {{is placed on the}} baby's head and the head is then removed and fitted onto the body of a bomber pilot. The next scene shows a fleet of bombers bombing a city while an anti-aircraft gunner fires at them and troops parachute down. A soldier is seen running across a bombed out city before two opposing troops are shown repeatably stabbing each other with bayonets on a battlefield landscape filled with human skulls. <b>This</b> <b>scene</b> is intercut with footage of two military leaders playing chess.|$|E
5|$|After {{the episode}} was submitted, several re-writes were requested. Originally, {{the story was}} {{supposed}} to take place in Oklahoma, noted for being the center of Tornado Alley. For budgetary reasons, the episode was relocated to Mississippi. Another scene, originally scripted to take place at a motel, featured Pinker taking a short cut through a wall. <b>This</b> <b>scene</b> was cut not only because of budgetary reasons, but also because the writers and producers wanted to shift the episode from a supernatural focus to an emotional one.|$|E
5|$|Alfred Hitchcock's cameo is a {{signature}} occurrence {{in most of}} his films. In Psycho, he can be seen through a window—wearing a Stetson hat—standing outside Marion Crane's office. Wardrobe mistress Rita Riggs has said that Hitchcock chose <b>this</b> <b>scene</b> for his cameo {{so that he could}} be in a scene with his daughter (who played one of Marion's colleagues). Others have suggested that he chose this early appearance in the film in order to avoid distracting the audience.|$|E

5|$|As {{with all}} but the first scene of the Matsudaira scroll, <b>this</b> <b>scene</b> is set {{on the evening of}} Kankō 5, 11th month, 1st day (December 1, 1008), the day of the Ika-no-iwai of the Imperial Prince Atsuhira-shinnō, the later Emperor Go-Ichijō.

Empress Shōshi, with the baby in her arms, is partially visible at the top. Court ladies are serving various types of ritual food.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} first {{sequence}} of pictures, the three panels concerning Noah, taken from the sixth to ninth chapters of Genesis are thematic rather than chronological. In the first scene is shown the sacrifice of a sheep. Vasari, in writing about <b>this</b> <b>scene</b> mistakes it for the sacrifices by Cain and Abel, in which Abel's sacrifice was acceptable to God and Cain's was not. What this image almost certainly depicts is the sacrifice made by the family of Noah, after their safe deliverance from the Great Flood which destroyed the rest of Humankind.|$|E
5|$|Benicio del Toro had {{significant}} input into {{certain parts of}} the film; for example, he suggested a simpler, more concise way of depicting his character kidnapping Francisco Flores that Soderbergh ended up using. The director cut a scene in which Robert Wakefield smokes crack after finding it in his daughter's bedroom. After rehearsing <b>this</b> <b>scene</b> with the actors, he felt that the character would not do it; after consulting with Gaghan, the screenwriter agreed and the filmmakers cut the scene shortly before it was scheduled to be shot.|$|E

5|$|Kami, Perempuan premiered in 1943 in Jakarta. It {{received}} multiple {{performances that}} year, some in Jakarta, some {{in other parts}} of Java. In 1950 Pane included Kami, Perempuan in his book Djinak-Djinak Merpati dengan Tjerita2 Sandiwara Lain, a collection of his stage plays. For this publication Pane removed a scene in which two neighbours came to visit the family, which included further conversation. Pane considered <b>this</b> <b>scene</b> to be anti-climactic, whereas without it the play's title became more appropriate. Another, smaller, change to the play was the removal of the names of Japan's enemies during World War II.|$|E
5|$|Krohn's {{research}} {{also notes that}} Hitchcock shot the scene with two cameras: one a BNC Mitchell, the other a handheld French Éclair camera which Orson Welles had used in Touch of Evil (1958). In order to create an ideal montage for the greatest emotional impact on the audience, Hitchcock shot a lot of footage of <b>this</b> <b>scene</b> which he trimmed down in the editing room. He even brought a Moviola on the set to gauge the footage required. The final sequence, which his editor George Tomasini worked on with Hitchcock's advice, however did not go far beyond the basic structural elements set up by Bass' storyboards.|$|E
