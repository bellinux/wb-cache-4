We talk about it, she writes down words that I say describing what the song's about and the sentiment that I'd like her <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> then she goes away and she works on it. She writes it, she comes back. She does a version of it, we talk about it. It's a back and forth until she gets it right. It's a total collaboration.|$|E
500|$|Even after {{achieving}} the record, Hershiser expressed regret: [...] "Because {{of respect for}} Don {{and respect for the}} record, I don't think I should have walked to the mound in a situation where I'm supposed to be resting for the playoffs, just to beat a record. That would have tarnished the whole thing." [...] According to some sources, Drysdale was the person who convinced Hershiser to take the mound for the tenth inning, saying, [...] "I gave him a kick in the pants and told him <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> go as far as he can". However, other sources state that Drysdale merely said that if he had known about Hershiser's hesitance to break the record, he would have reassured him, saying [...] "I'd have kicked him right in the rear if I had known that... I'd have told him to get his buns out there and get them." ...|$|E
500|$|Lytle {{also noted}} that he was likely to record a new Grandaddy album, stating, [...] "It's {{probably}} going to happen.... If anyone knows anything about Grandaddy, they realise that my [...] music and Grandaddy's music is slightly interchangeable. I think if I were to focus on making a Grandaddy record [...] a full-blown Grandaddy record, and I {{like the idea of}} that. I'd like to give it a shot." [...] In early 2013, Lytle elaborated: [...] "I love the idea of making another Grandaddy record, but I wouldn't want it hanging over my head like 'Okay, you made this record, now are you guys going <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> tour in support of it?'... I'm hoping for this dream scenario where I can make Grandaddy records every so often and not have all this messy stuff that goes along with it. I already did that and it's just not appealing to me any more." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Initially, {{this was}} {{simply going to}} be an album of piano and voice", Wainwright stated in a May 2007 {{interview}} with The Independent Nick Duerden. That was, however, until he visited Berlin, which influenced the album's lush sound. Wainwright declared, [...] "Basically, a huge wave of German Romanticism descended on the recording process, and almost drowned me." [...] Wainwright cited two reasons for the change in direction and the heightened dramatic flare: the cancer diagnosis received by his mother (folk musician Kate McGarrigle) during the album's genesis, which he found [...] "fueled his creative intensity in some kind of displaced attempt to get her well", and the New York Metropolitan Opera's commissioning Wainwright to write an opera, making Release the Stars a way of training for such a large project. Revealing the overall theme in January 2007, Wainwright declared the album was about opening up and following impulses. [...] "Whether it's the environment, politics or religious warfare", Wainwright stated in an interview with The Japan Times, [...] "it's time <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> {{be a part of the}} solution, whatever that is." ...|$|E
500|$|During an {{interview}} with Digital Spy, Lewis told Tom Eames that Glassheart has a running theme about [...] "star-crossed lovers that can't be together", {{and so it was}} likely that this idea would feature on the tour. Lewis also cited William Shakespeare as another source of inspiration. She spent the three days of the final tour rehearsals at The Backstage Centre in Purfleet, Essex (UK). The Glassheart Tour was scheduled to visit twenty-one venues across Germany and the United Kingdom. The tour was expected to begin on 15 April in Berlin. The list had expanded from an initial sixteen to include five dates in Germany. Lewis would then proceed with UK dates beginning in Glasgow, including two dates at London's Royal Albert Hall before finishing on 18 May in Plymouth. Speaking about the tour, Lewis said [...] "I can't wait <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> play my new songs. I had such fun on my last tour and I'm really excited about doing it again next year."

500|$|Inclement weather {{continued}} {{to disrupt the}} Saturday's proceedings as qualifying was delayed multiple times before being ultimately rescheduled for Sunday morning. Many drivers backed the decision, with Jenson Button saying: [...] "It {{was the right thing}} to do [...] In one respect, maybe if we decided three hours earlier it would have been better for the fans. But we wanted <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> drive and put on a show. Delaying it every half an hour was the way it had to be." [...] During the waiting period on Saturday, many teams had engaged in tomfoolery in the paddock to entertain the crowds, such as bowling or ballroom dancing between Red Bull teammates Daniel Ricciardo and Daniil Kvyat. Ferrari later condemned the behaviour of their fellow teams, with team principal Maurizio Arrivabene saying: [...] "We are a Formula One team, not the Cirque du Soleil." [...] Kimi Räikkönen backed him, stating: [...] "I think this is F1 and not the circus. The people are obviously not happy when we're not running but we cannot make them happy with whatever we do apart from running." ...|$|E

500|$|Angelina's {{dream is}} to be a {{successful}} singer on the music charts. DeGarmo noted that her father, Angelo, [...] "who thinks his spoiled-brat daughter sings like a choir of angels" [...] puts pressure on Devon Hamilton (Bryton James), a young and upcoming music producer, to show Angelina the ropes of the music industry and make her a success. DeGarmo said: [...] "Unfortunately, she’s not as good a singer as she and her father think she is [...] Angelina is a bit oblivious to reality, but will slowly come to grips with it over the next few weeks. As a singer myself, it’s liberating to get on the set and throw all ego – and notes – aside and surprise people." [...] DeGarmo commented: [...] "It's fantastically hilarious because it puts the poor kid in a horrible predicament!" [...] She said that Angelina was into Top 40 music at first, but: [...] "the writers have her singing the American standards — Judy Garland, that sort of thing. We want the audience to be really familiar with the songs, so they can tell how badly Angie is butchering them." [...] Michael Logan of TV Guide noted that you needed [...] "skill to play a bad singer", to which DeGarmo said that it's harder than people realize: [...] "but it's really liberating <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> be bad. You just throw your ego to the wind and sing for Jesus." [...] Devon would eventually go on to make Angelina a good singer. Angelina briefly fired Devon for adding rap verses to a song of hers which was soaring on the charts, but he retained the rights of the track.|$|E
2500|$|Pete Willis of Def Leppard {{was seen}} as another major {{influence}} for Darrell. In his Guitar World magazine tribute issue, Abbott was quoted as saying, [...] "Man, that first Leppard album really jams, and their original guitarist, Pete Willis, was a great player.

He made me want <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> play. Def Leppard used the two-guitar thing much more back then than they do now." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to a 1998 {{article in}} the Auburn Plainsman, the most likely origin of the [...] "War Eagle" [...] cry grew from a 1913 pep rally at Langdon Hall, where {{students}} had gathered {{the day before the}} annual football game against the University of Georgia. [...] Cheerleader Gus Graydon told the crowd, [...] "If we are going to win this game, we'll have <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> fight, because this means war." [...] During the frenzy, another student, E. T. Enslen, dressed in his military uniform, noticed something had dropped from his hat. [...] Bending down, he saw it was the metal emblem of an eagle that had come loose during his wild cheering. [...] Someone asked him what he had found, and Enslen loudly replied, [...] "It's a War Eagle!" [...] The new cry was used by students at the game the following day.|$|E

2500|$|The {{inspiration}} for the album shifted when Maida traveled to Sudan and Darfur to shoot a documentary with War Child {{in the middle of}} recording. [...] "We were there for a couple of weeks, and we came back from that and went right back into the studio, and it was like: 'God, this song sucks. I’m not saying that anymore.' You start reflecting on lyrics and any message you’re trying <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> it really altered everything again." [...] The band recorded in six-week spurts, traveling between studios in Toronto, Los Angeles and Maui, recording more songs. With no deadline from the record company, they kept recording and gaining more perspective. [...] "We'd get together, write, record, take two weeks off, go back in and we ended up doing that on and off for the last two-and-a-half or three years," [...] By this time, over forty songs were recorded including [...] "Picture", [...] "Don't Ask Why" [...] (Where Are You), [...] "Holy Ghost" [...] (Angels/Losing/Sleep) and [...] "Vampires", which was briefly considered for the album's title. The sessions became strained at times as the band couldn't figure out where the album was going. [...] "We had so many songs," [...] said Taggart, [...] "and we just started to go crazy." [...] Many songs went through multiple incarnations such as [...] "Boy", which caused the band a lot of stress and took over three weeks to break down and re-record. They were also butting heads with their producer. [...] "There were some fucking horrible sessions," [...] Maida admitted.|$|E

They were detached to watch the coach and be satisfied that the greenbacks were aboard, for it isn't my style to 'hold up' except for something special. They were to take seats on the coach as far as Ringwood Station, three miles below where we held you up, and <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> pass the word to us {{that it was all}} right. They didn't; that made us a little extra careful, seeing something was wrong, but never suspecting THEM. We found out afterwards that they got one of my scouts to cut down that tree, saying it was my orders and a part of our game, calculating in the stoppage and confusion to collar the swag and get off with it.
