40|$|Abstract Molecular {{or direct}} bonding is an {{emerging}} technique to assemble directly two silicon wafers or metal parts. In vaccum, the two surfaces {{are free to}} bond perfectly if their lattice orientation is coincident.

The aim of this project is to gain insight in <b>the</b> <b>bonding</b> process and to investigate the influence of <b>the</b> <b>bonding</b> characteristics. A specific strategy based on a non linear contact mechanics scheme is adopted to describe <b>the</b> <b>bonding</b> process: <b>the</b> methodology is shown to provide enough flexibility to account for the normal and tangential interactions. These latter are described with Traction-Opening displacement laws that are first derived from interactomic potential. the influence on <b>the</b> <b>bonding</b> characteristic on <b>the</b> <b>bonding</b> wavefront is investigated to attempt deriving local information of <b>the</b> <b>bonding</b> mechanism...|$|R
