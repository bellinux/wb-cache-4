5|$|At {{the same}} time, MacArthur had {{attacked}} the imperial mystique when his staff released the famous {{picture of his}} first meeting with the Emperor, whose impact on the Japanese public was electric as the Japanese people for the first time saw the Emperor as a mere man overshadowed by the much taller MacArthur instead of the living god he had always been portrayed as. Up to 1945, the Emperor had been a remote, mysterious figure to his people, rarely seen in public and always silent, whose photographs were always taken from a certain angle to make him look taller and more impressive than he really was. No Japanese photographer would have taken such a photo of the Emperor being overshadowed by MacArthur. The Japanese government immediately banned <b>the</b> <b>photo</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Emperor with MacArthur {{on the grounds that it}} damaged the imperial mystique, but MacArthur rescinded the ban and ordered all of the Japanese newspapers to print it. The photo was intended as a message to the Emperor about who was going to be the senior partner in their relationship.|$|E
25|$|Teng Xingshan (Chinese: 滕兴善, ? 1989) was a Chinese {{citizen who}} was {{executed}} for having raped, robbed and murdered Shi Xiaorong (石小荣), {{a woman who}} had disappeared. An old man found a dismembered body, and police forensics claimed to have matched the body to <b>the</b> <b>photo</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> missing Shi Xiaorong. The execution was carried out on 28 January 1989 by the Huaihua Intermediate People's Court. In 1993, the missing woman returned to the village, saying she had been kidnapped to Shandong. The absolute innocence of the executed Teng was not admitted until 2005.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the concert, Furtwängler {{continued}} to keep his baton in his right hand. Hitler understood the situation and jumped up and demonstratively held out his right hand to him. The same situation occurred during another concert later on, when a photographer had been mobilized by the Nazis for the occasion: <b>the</b> <b>photo</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> famous handshake between Furtwängler and Hitler was distributed everywhere by Goebbels. Goebbels had obtained what he desired: to keep Furtwängler in Germany and to give the impression to those who were not well informed (especially outside the country) that Furtwängler was now a supporter of the regime.|$|E

25|$|On July 17, 2009, NASA {{released}} low-resolution {{engineering test}} {{photos of the}} Apollo 11, Apollo 14, Apollo 15, Apollo 16 and Apollo 17 landing sites that have been photographed by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter {{as part of the}} process of starting its primary mission. The photos show the descent stage of the landers from each mission on the Moon’s surface. <b>The</b> <b>photo</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Apollo 14 landing site also shows tracks made by an astronaut between a science experiment (ALSEP) and the lander. Photos of the Apollo 12 landing site were released by NASA on September 3, 2009. The Intrepid lander descent stage, experiment package (ALSEP), Surveyor 3 spacecraft, and astronaut footpaths are all visible. While the LRO images have been enjoyed by the scientific community as a whole, they have not done anything to convince conspiracists that the landings happened.|$|E
25|$|The {{glow of a}} flame is complex. Black-body {{radiation}} is emitted from soot, gas, and fuel particles, though the soot particles {{are too small to}} behave like perfect blackbodies. There is also photon emission by de-excited atoms and molecules in the gases. Much of the {{radiation is}} emitted in the visible and infrared bands. The color depends on temperature for the black-body radiation, and on chemical makeup for the emission spectra. The dominant color in a flame changes with temperature. <b>The</b> <b>photo</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> forest fire in Canada is an excellent example of this variation. Near the ground, where most burning is occurring, the fire is white, the hottest color possible for organic material in general, or yellow. Above the yellow region, the color changes to orange, which is cooler, then red, which is cooler still. Above the red region, combustion no longer occurs, and the uncombusted carbon particles are visible as black smoke.|$|E
25|$|The Academy Building is {{the fourth}} such building. It was built in 1914 after a devastating fire ruined the third. The Academy Building was {{designed}} by Ralph Adams Cram of Cram, Goodhue & Ferguson, and houses the History, Math, Religion and Classical Languages departments, along with a small but significant archaeology/anthropology museum. Two wings {{were added to the}} original structure in the 1920s and 1930s during a building boom that was orchestrated by Principal Lewis Perry. One of these wings is the Mayer Art Center, which, despite being attached to the Academy Building, {{is often referred to as}} a separate building. The Academy Building also houses the Assembly Hall (formerly known as the Chapel). In former times, non-denominational, Christian religious services were conducted in the Chapel every morning Monday through Saturday before the beginning of classes, and attendance was mandatory for all students in keeping with the wishes of the founders of the academy. The bell (visible in <b>the</b> <b>photo</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Academy Building tower) was rung in a succession of rings to call the student body to worship: Ones, Twos, Threes, Fours, and Fives. After Fives were rung, monitors would begin walking down the rows checking attendance on the benches. The bell continues to be rung to mark the end of classes, as well as to mark each hour from 8 AM to 11 PM.|$|E

500|$|The inside {{walls are}} always painted in green, as symbol of reincarnation. There is no decoration, and small {{papers on the}} walls {{indicate}} to visitors {{that they should not}} speak in the temple. Several rows of wooden benches separated by a center aisle are devoted to the faithful and visitors. They are facing a two-floor platform where the worship is performed, and a text called [...] "The Halo of Consciousness" [...] ("L'Auréore de la Conscience") which is written on the back wall. In France only, the highest platform is adorned, from left to right, with a representation of the [...] "tree of science of the sight of evil", the Antoinist symbol, then a photo of Antoine and another one of Catherine; <b>the</b> <b>photo</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Father is slightly higher than the other two. On the left and the right, side rooms of around 15 m³ are used as consulting offices whose walls are orned with five tables; the most impressive of them is Antoine's image. There is also a cloakroom and, adjacent to the temple, a small apartment continuously occupied by an Antoinist healer.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} positive reviews. The {{episode was}} described as [...] "tense", with Christine Orlando from TV Fanatic, saying that [...] ""Missing" [...] upped the emotional intensity when the autopsies weren't about finding a killer, but about finding a kidnapped little boy". Orlando said that the scenes with Bud were a highlight, {{as well as the}} scenes with Megan and Derek. Orlando said, [...] "I enjoyed the banter between Megan and Derek. He's the optimist to her pessimist. When they get <b>the</b> <b>photo</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> boy, Derek pointed out that at least he's alive and not alone. Megan said yes, but he's sick and possibly coughing up blood. The amateur nature of the photo gave Derek hope that the kidnapper wasn't a professional. Great, said Megan, that meant he was incompetent and desperate. Was anyone else seeing a case where opposites attract?". She said it was a [...] "pity" [...] that Megan turned Derek down; [...] "Megan could use a bit of a love life and I'm hoping we see more of Agent Ames in the future". She said she was [...] "thankful" [...] that there was not a storyline with Lacey (Mary Mouser), saying that the storyline with Megan and Kate arguing over Lacey had gotten [...] "old", [...] "I'm happy they seem to be moving on". Finishing, she praised the scenes with Megan and Joan and added, [...] "Having been a bit bored with last week's episode, I was glad to see Body of Proof step up its game. The only thing lacking was a bit of the humour I've grown to love".|$|E

2500|$|The {{earliest}} Marchants were pinwheel machines, {{but most}} of them were remarkably-sophisticated rotary types. They ran at 1,300 addition cycles per minute if the [...] bar is held down. Others were limited to 600 cycles per minute, because their accumulator dials started and stopped for every cycle; Marchant dials moved at a steady and proportional speed for continuing cycles. Most Marchants had a row of nine keys on the extreme right, as shown in <b>the</b> <b>photo</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Figurematic. These simply made the machine add for the number of cycles corresponding to the number on the key, and then shifted the carriage one place. Even nine add cycles took only a short time.|$|E
2500|$|Arthur Tsang Hin Wah of Reuters {{took several}} shots from room 1111 of the Beijing Hotel, {{but only the}} shot of Tank Man {{climbing}} the tank was chosen.

When the staff noticed Widener's work, they re-checked Wah's negative to see if it was of the same moment as Widener's. On March 20, 2013, in an interview by the Hong Kong Press Photographers Association (HKPPA), Wah told the story and added further detail. He told HKPPA that on the night of June 3, 1989, he was beaten by students while taking photos and was bleeding. A [...] "foreign" [...] photographer accompanying him suddenly said, [...] "I am not gonna die for your country," [...] and left. Wah returned to the hotel. When he decided to go out again, the public security stopped him, so he stayed in his room, stood next to the window and eventually witnessed the Tank Man and took several shots of the event.|$|E

As for the face it was a speaking likeness in expression but it did not do justice to her figure which came in for a lot of notice usually and which did not come out to the best advantage in that getup. She could without difficulty, he said, have posed for the ensemble, not to dwell on certain opulent curves of the. He dwelt, being a bit of an artist in his spare time, on the female form in general developmentally because, as it so happened, no later than that afternoon he had seen those Grecian statues, 1450 perfectly developed as works of art, in the National Museum.
