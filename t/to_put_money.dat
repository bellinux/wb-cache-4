5|$|The baths were {{originally}} built in approximately 1815, {{by a local}} builder called Newton, from John Pinch the elder's design, on the Duke of Cleveland's land, giving the site its name. They were intended as public pleasure baths, and {{are believed to be}} the oldest surviving outdoor swimming baths in England. The area of Bath to the north and east of the River Avon was undergoing development {{at the end of the}} 18th century and the beginning of the 19th, after the opening of Pulteney Bridge on land around Bathwick which had been owned by William Pulteney, 1st Earl of Bath. William Johnstone had inherited the land and planned to create a new town. It was foreseen that, along with the access provided by Pulteney Bridge and Great Pulteney Street, the eastern side of the Avon would become popular with speculators and developers, as Bath had become perhaps the most fashionable of the rapidly developing British spa towns, attracting many notable visitors. In the 18th century, Bath acquired its first purpose-built theatre, the Old Orchard Street Theatre. It was rebuilt as the Theatre Royal, along with the Grand Pump Room attached to the Roman Baths and assembly rooms. Master of ceremonies Beau Nash, who presided over the city's social life from 1705 until his death in 1761, drew up a code of behaviour for public entertainments. After 1789, the financial climate did not encourage further building, as the Panic of 1797, related to a period of deflation between 1793 and 1800, was followed by the Napoleonic Wars, which saw the Depression of 1807. These limited the proposed development of new housing in the area for some years. The Bathwick Water Act of 1801 had prohibited nude bathing in the river and meant that many local subscribers were willing <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>money</b> into the construction of the baths.|$|E
25|$|Galveston {{had become}} one of the largest {{shipping}} centers in the nation during the 19th century, but the Galveston Hurricane of 1900 destroyed much of the city and made outside investors leery of continuing <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>money</b> into the island. The city nevertheless rebuilt quickly but struggled to regain its footing economically. Attempting to diversify away from shipping, business leaders tried various means of reviving tourism and establishing new enterprises such as insurance.|$|E
25|$|The {{bank was}} {{organized}} {{by a group of}} men led by Condy Raguet, who had read about the concept of savings banks becoming popular in Great Britain. The bank quickly began to expand by adding services and branches, and moving into larger headquarters buildings. By the late 1910s, PSFS had the most depositors of any savings bank in the United States; it was second to the Emigrant Savings Bank in the amount of money deposited. PSFS began programs in the 1920s that encouraged children <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>money</b> into savings accounts instead of spending it on treats and school programs, allowing children to open accounts with PSFS.|$|E

25|$|On 18 June 2009, Miller {{requested}} {{federal funding}} from the Harper government's $12-billion stimulus spending to purchase new streetcars {{as part of the}} Transit City plan. The city faced a deadline of 27 June 2009 to commit to the $1.2-billion deal signed with Bombardier for the 204 streetcars. Miller and Premier Dalton McGuinty flew to Thunder Bay to announce their funding for the new streetcars, hoping to convince the Harper government to come up with its one-third share of the cost. Federal Transport Minister John Baird rejected the request outright. Baird stated that streetcar funding clearly failed to meet the stimilus bill's requirement that the funds would have to be spent in 2 years, as that was meant <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>money</b> into the economy quickly to buoy demand and staving off deflation, while Transit City would have been a long-term project. Also the stimulus required funds to be spent on infrastructure in the municipality where the application is granted in order to create local employment, whereas the jobs created by building streetcars would be in Thunder Bay and not Toronto. Baird noted that Toronto was the only one out of 2,700 applicants that didn't meet the eligibility criteria.|$|E

After Todd says [...] "hell no" [...] and [...] "damn" [...] at dinner, his father Ned eventually discovers that he learned those words from Homer.

[...] "Energy systems are notorious for their long gestation periods, often twenty years or longer, [...] {{there had to be}} a pay-off in a product within five to seven years in order to justify the public money being put in. There are political cycles involving re-election, so the politicians didn't want <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>money</b> into systems that were going to come to fruition in some other generation.

[...] He also cited concerns with his Democratic criticism of President Bush; he hadn't attended Democratic caucus meetings for some time due to the criticism leveled at Bush, his longtime friend.

2500|$|Needing {{additional}} {{sources of}} finance to fund Birmingham's bid for immediate promotion {{back to the}} Football League First Division, the board approached Clifford Coombs, founder of home credit company S, for a loan. He agreed <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>money</b> into the club, but only if he could run it himself. He duly bought out the Morris family, promised to [...] "find all the money I can afford. My heart is in Birmingham City and now my pocket will be as well", became chairman in January 1966, and lured Stan Cullis, manager of Wolverhampton Wanderers in their glory days, out of retirement. Cullis's team played attractive football, and average attendance doubled between 1965–66 and 1967–68. Cullis led Birmingham to the semi-final of the League Cup in 1967, and in the 1967–68 FA Cup, they beat Arsenal and Chelsea in front of crowds in excess of 50,000 at St Andrew's before losing to West Bromwich Albion in the semi-final. Cup success was not restricted to the first team: the youth team reached {{the final of the}} FA Youth Cup in 1967, losing to what was described as an experienced Sunderland team. Fourth place in the division in 1967–68 and seventh in 1968–69 preceded a slump towards the bottom of the table, and Coombs decided {{it was time for a}} change. He persuaded Cullis back into retirement in March 1970, and approached top-class managers, including Brian Clough and Peter Taylor and Don Revie, without success, before appointing Freddie Goodwin of Brighton & Hove Albion manager.|$|E
