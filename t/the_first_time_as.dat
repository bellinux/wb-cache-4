Specter {{won the election}} by a 2.5% margin. He was later reelected in 1986, 1992, 1998, and 2004, despite 1992 and 1998 being bad years for Republicans.

5|$|Allied {{aircraft}} specifically started targeting ZNDH and Luftwaffe {{bases and}} aircraft for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>as</b> {{a result of}} the Seventh anti-Partisan Offensive, including Operation Rösselsprung in late May 1944. Until then Axis aircraft could fly inland almost at will as long as they remained at low altitude. Partisan units on the ground frequently complained about enemy aircraft attacking them while hundreds of Allied aircraft flew above at higher altitude. This changed during Rösselsprung as Allied fighter-bombers went low en-masse for the first time, establishing full aerial superiority. Consequently, both the ZNDH and Luftwaffe were forced to limit their operations in clear weather to early morning and late afternoon hours.|$|E
5|$|Colleen and Suzanne Dengel, {{the twins}} who played Miranda's daughters, were cast {{two weeks after}} auditioning for Frankel and Finerman.

5|$|Europa, {{along with}} Jupiter's three other large moons, Io, Ganymede, and Callisto, was {{discovered}} by Galileo Galilei on 8 January 1610, and possibly independently by Simon Marius. The first reported observation of Io and Europa was made by Galileo Galilei on 7 January 1610 using a 20×-magnification refracting telescope at the University of Padua. However, in that observation, Galileo could not separate Io and Europa due to the low magnification of his telescope, so that the two were recorded as a single point of light. The following day, 8 January 1610 (used as the discovery date for Europa by the IAU), Io and Europa were seen for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>as</b> separate bodies during Galileo's observations of the Jupiter system.|$|E

5|$|Following For Your Eyes Only, Roger Moore had {{expressed}} a desire to retire from the role of James Bond. His original contract had been for three films, which was fulfilled with The Spy Who Loved Me. Subsequent films were negotiated on a film-by-film basis. Given his reluctance to return for Octopussy, the producers engaged in a semi-public quest for the next Bond, with both Timothy Dalton and James Brolin being suggested. However, when the rival Never Say Never Again was announced, the producers re-contracted Moore in the belief that an established actor in the role would fare better against Sean Connery. Brolin's three screentests were publicly released for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>as</b> a special feature named James Brolin: The Man Who Would Be Bond in the Octopussy Ultimate Edition DVD.|$|E
5|$|Following {{repeated}} heavy bombing by Allied forces during Operation Crossbow, the Germans {{were unable}} to complete the construction works and the complex never entered service. It was captured by the Allies in September 1944, partially demolished on the orders of Winston Churchill to prevent its reuse as a military base, and then abandoned. It remained derelict until the mid-1990s. In 1997 it {{opened to the public}} for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time,</b> <b>as</b> a museum. Exhibits in the tunnels and under the dome {{tell the story of the}} German occupation of France during World War II, the V-weapons and the history of space exploration.|$|E

He also drew all but three of the first 23 covers and interior frontispieces to Classic X-Men from 1986 to 1988. His interior X-Men-related work included a two-issue run on X-Factor and the one-shot , both in 1989, and three Uncanny X-Men Annuals, in 1986, 1988 and 1990. It was in drawing the 1988 annual that Adams says he felt like a professional comic book artist for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time,</b> <b>as</b> he first felt confident that {{he knew what he was}} doing.|$|E

In the 2011 playoffs, he scored his first NHL post-season goal against Antti Niemi of the San Jose Sharks in Game 2 of the third round– a 7–3 win. The following game, he was injured off a boarding hit from Sharks forward Jamie McGinn. Rome was sidelined {{from the rest of}} the game; McGinn received a five-minute penalty on the play, but did not receive further discipline from the league.|$|E
