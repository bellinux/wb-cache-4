5|$|In {{the ending}} {{that was in}} the {{original}} theatrical version, Ellen rammed the shark with Mike's boat, mortally wounding it. The shark then causes <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> <b>to</b> break apart with its death contortions, forcing the people on <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> <b>to</b> jump off to avoid going down with it. American audiences disapproved of this ending. A new ending was ordered shot for foreign distribution with the shark getting stabbed with the bow sprit and then exploding; and with Jake being found wounded but alive. This version is what Universal used on home media releases.|$|E
5|$|As {{the party}} recuperated, Shackleton {{realised}} that {{the boat was}} not capable of making a further voyage to reach the whaling stations, and that Vincent and McNish were unfit to travel further. He decided to move <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> <b>to</b> a safer location within King Haakon Bay, from which point he, Worsley and Crean would cross the island on foot, aiming for the station at Stromness.|$|E

50|$|Prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> escape, <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> had <b>to</b> be fuelled {{with large}} amount of diesel and stocked with enough food to sustain an eight-day voyage. Stocking and fueling this amount all at once could have alerted {{observers}} {{to the fact that}} a long voyage was planned. Commander Rinat, the head of operations, instead ordered <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> <b>to</b> be gradually fuelled using a small 5-ton tank truck. A quarter of a million litres of fuel was smuggled in drums and hidden belowdecks. By 24 December, <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> had been fully fuelled and stored. The supply officer bought fresh and dry food from local grocery stores <b>to</b> stock on <b>the</b> <b>boats.</b> <b>To</b> prevent arousing suspicion, the supplies were purchased in small quantities each time.|$|R
2500|$|In reality, {{the given}} {{capacity}} was quite nominal, as filling <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> <b>to</b> their indicated capacity {{would have required}} some passengers to stand. This did in fact happen to some of <b>the</b> last <b>boats</b> <b>to</b> leave Titanic; at the subsequent British enquiry, Titanics Second Officer Charles Lightoller testified that the nominal capacity could only have applied [...] "in absolutely smooth water, under the most favourable conditions." [...] The proper capacity {{would have been more}} like 40 people per boat under typical conditions. [...] Interestingly, few officers and crew were aware that steel beam reinforcements had been added to the keels of <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> <b>to</b> prevent buckling in the davits under a full load.|$|R
5|$|A surface {{marker buoy}} (SMB) with a reel and line {{is often used}} by a dive leader to allow <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> <b>to</b> monitor {{progress}} of the dive group. This can provide the operator with a positive control of depth, by remaining slightly negative and using the buoyancy of the float to support this slight over-weighting. This allows the line to be kept under slight tension which {{reduces the risk of}} entanglement. The reel or spool used to store and roll up the line usually has slightly negative buoyancy, so that if released it will hang down and not float away.|$|E
5|$|After SS-3s March 1911 launch, Whitehead's {{tried to}} sell SS-3 to the Austro-Hungarian Navy, but because the {{evaluation}} of the first two U-5-class boats was still underway, they declined to purchase. Over the next three years Whitehead's attempted to sell <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> <b>to</b> the navies of Peru, Portugal, the Netherlands, Brazil, and Bulgaria, before the Austro-Hungarian Navy rejected an offer for the second time. With the outbreak of war, however, the Austro-Hungarian Navy purchased the unsold submarine to quickly bolster its fleet.|$|E
5|$|During the mid 1990s, Ramiz Sadiku was docked {{for a major}} {{overhaul}} and reconstruction. However, {{due to the lack}} of funds the work was never completed and the boat was decommissioned and eventually sold for scrap. The boat's superstructure, propulsion, sensors and weapon systems were dismantled, after which the new owner moved <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> <b>to</b> an underground naval dock on the Luštica peninsula. The boat remained there for several years, before its deteriorating condition caused it to sink inside the dock. The wreck was raised in 2014 and towed to Zelenika where it was broken up to smaller segments which were then transported to the Nikšić steel factory.|$|E

5|$|Still {{relatively}} inexperienced, Low ordered {{too many}} {{men to the}} outside of <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> <b>to</b> work on the buildup, and the Rose Pink tipped over too far. The portholes had been left open, and the vessel took on water and sank, with the death of two men. The Rose Pink had been carrying most of the provisions, and Low—by now captaining a captured schooner, the Squirrel—and his crew were forced to strictly ration their fresh water to half a pint (around 275ml) per man, per day.|$|E

He received a commission as a second lieutenant on 2 January 1943, and was posted to North Africa. Although he was commissioned in the Sherwood Foresters, he never served with them, instead being posted to the 6th Battalion, Lincolnshire Regiment (6th Lincolns), a Territorial Army (TA) unit, having become friendly with Captain Alan Money, {{an officer in the}} Lincolns, on <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> <b>to</b> North Africa.

5|$|Due to the {{aforementioned}} balance issues, {{the game was}} initially very difficult, especially in the later stages. Nakamura had written a program that simulated every single combat {{that he used to}} adjust the games setting for character leveling and the strength of enemies players would encounter. This program failed to account for larger monster groups, however, which fell outside the model and caused the game to be very difficult. Further more, enemies leveling and weapons power were designed by area, but Koichi Nakamura didn't think over the boat, so if player get <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> <b>to</b> some land might be quickly killed. The developers realized there was a balance problem and did some modifications, such as limiting the number of enemies in Midenhall to groups of three, and moving the Cannock Castle closer to Midenhall Castle.|$|E
5|$|During her {{short-lived}} presidency, a {{truck with}} nuclear energy goes missing and puts D.C. into lock-down, a scheme devised by {{several members of}} Frank's cabinet and Conway's campaign. During the emergency, Claire is visited by diplomat Jane Davis (Patricia Clarkson), who says that she can track down a leader of ICO for the Underwoods. Claire is also faced {{with a series of}} diplomatic crises: Russian soldiers have also taken over an American base, and the Russians and Chinese are vying for possession of a boat in Antarctica that has a stowaway American working for the Russians. After making a deal with the Chinese, Claire orders for <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> <b>to</b> be destroyed so that neither the Chinese nor the Russians can get what is on board.

5|$|Of {{the three}} lifeboats, the James Caird was deemed {{the strongest and}} most likely to survive the journey. Shackleton had named it after Sir James Key Caird, a Dundee jute-manufacturer and philanthropist, whose {{sponsorship}} had helped finance the expedition. Before its voyage, the ship's carpenter Harry McNish strengthened and adapted <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> <b>to</b> withstand the mighty seas of the Southern Ocean. Surviving a series of dangers, including a near capsizing, the boat reached the southern coast of South Georgia after a voyage lasting 16days. Shackleton and two companions then crossed the island's mountainous interior to reach a whaling station on the northern side. Here he organised the relief of the Elephant Island party, {{and the return of}} his men home without loss of life. After the end of the First World War in 1918, the James Caird was brought back from South Georgia to England in 1919 and put on permanent display at Shackleton's old school, Dulwich College from 1922.|$|E
