5|$|As general Yang Pu {{returned}} north {{with his}} soldiers after the Han–Nanyue War in 111 BC, he requested the emperor's permission to annex Dongyue.

The army never arrived and Zou blamed the weather conditions, while secretly maintaining a diplomatic relationship with Nanyue.|$|E

5|$|Alexander had no {{experience}} in affairs of state. However, {{he was determined to}} make the best of a difficult situation and represent his father as best he could. Adopting an air of cool indifference to the government, he rarely made the effort to read official documents before he rubber-stamped them. His functions were limited, and amounted to visiting the Macedonian front to support <b>the</b> <b>morale</b> <b>of</b> the Greek and Allied troops. Since Venizelos's return to power, Athens was at war with the Central Powers, and Greek soldiers battled those of Bulgaria in the north.|$|E
5|$|Although Muraviev's attack failed, {{it forced}} the Polish {{artillery}} {{to lessen the}} pressure on the Russian Grand Battery, which was now free to support the main Russian attack on the westernmost Polish defences. By that time the Grand Battery could shell the ramparts of the second line with relative impunity, thus damaging both the defences and <b>the</b> <b>morale</b> <b>of</b> the crews. Polish infantrymen manning the forts were ordered to lie down behind the gabions, which minimised the losses. Soldiers in the field had no such cover, and suffered casualties. The Grand Battery also silenced some of the guns in Forts 21, 22 and 23.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> working <b>morale</b> among {{hospitality}} employees in the Pattaya district, Thailand, and to compare the differences between <b>the</b> working <b>morale</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> employees based on gender and years of work experience. The instrument used for collecting data was a questionnaire. This instrument comprised of 40 items that were grouped into eight aspects: (a) career advancement, (b) satisfaction with job position, (c) satisfaction with job responsibility, (d) satisfaction with supervision and supervisor, (e) relationship between peers and superiors, (f) satisfaction with salary and fringe benefits, (g) working environment, and (h) security in the workplace. The result of the study revealed that <b>the</b> overall working <b>morale</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> employees in the Pattaya district was at a high level. Regarding the eight aspects, the levels <b>of</b> <b>the</b> working <b>morale</b> for each aspect were also high.

5|$|Although outnumbered ten-to-one by the Pakistani troops, the Sikhs {{repelled}} {{their attacks}} multiple times. With their ammunition running out, Singh ordered {{his men to}} join the main company, knowing that reinforcement was impossible under Pakistani shelling. With the help of another soldier, he brought two injured men along, though he himself was wounded. Under the heavy Pakistani fire, Singh moved from position to position, boosting <b>the</b> <b>morale</b> <b>of</b> his men and intermittently throwing grenades. Despite being wounded twice, he refused evacuation and continued to hold {{the first line of}} trenches.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the battle}} was over and Radzymin was secure, the Soviet forces {{continued}} to threaten the Polish northern flank. In {{the early hours of}} August 16 the Russians mounted yet another assault on Radzymin, reinforced by several armoured cars and led personally by the commanding officer of the 27th Rifle Division, Vitovt Putna. However, by this time <b>the</b> <b>morale</b> <b>of</b> the 27th Division was already broken, and the assault was easily thwarted by the Polish infantry and the three remaining operational FT tanks. The armoured cars withdrew as soon as the Polish tanks opened fire, and the Russian infantry followed.|$|E
5|$|Another of Harrison's goals was {{to raise}} <b>the</b> <b>morale</b> <b>of</b> the {{workforce}} and locomotive engineers; crews {{were assigned to}} the same locomotives, and senior engineers were allowed to paint their names on their engines. When business declined in 1914 Harrison reduced his salary by 20percent, but introduced smaller and graduated cuts for other staff, with the smallest percentages at the lowest pay scales. Other efforts to improve morale included rewards for fuel efficiency and the improvement of safety, including stricter investigation of accidents.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of Tallon's finger injury, Saggers made his Test debut in the Fourth Test, which started at Headingley on 22 July 1948. As England made 496runs in their first innings, Saggers took catches to remove Denis Compton for 23, caught down the leg side, and Jim Laker for four. During the innings, Saggers was noted by Fingleton for {{maintaining}} a quiet presence behind the stumps, whereas Tallon was characteristically known for loudly appealing {{in concert with the}} bowler when he was playing. Fingleton felt that Saggers' failure to appeal dampened <b>the</b> <b>morale</b> <b>of</b> the bowlers, who were vocally supported by Tallon in the other four Tests.

5|$|At {{the end of}} 1973, {{there was}} serious debate among the Hanoi {{leadership}} over future military policy as the Central Committee of the Lao Động Party convened to assess the progress of its efforts in the south.

Premier Phạm Văn Đồng, however, feared resuming operations would drain vital resources needed for reconstruction in the north.|$|E
5|$|Balmer was {{promoted}} to temporary group captain on 4May 1944. On 10/11May, his Lancasters {{took part in a}} raid on Lille, losing three of their number. In an effort to shore up <b>the</b> <b>morale</b> <b>of</b> his younger crews, Balmer decided to personally lead their next mission the following night, against a military camp at Bourg-Léopold (Leopoldsburg), Belgium. It was planned to be his last operation before going on to a more senior position. His aircraft failed to return from the raid, causing considerable shock to his unit. The next day, Balmer's place as commanding officer of No.467 Squadron was taken by Wing Commander William Brill, previously a member of No.463 Squadron RAAF, which was also based at Waddington.|$|E
