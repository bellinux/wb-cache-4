5|$|As of 2017, {{just under}} 20,000 protein-coding genes {{are seen to}} be {{expressed}} in the human, and some 400 of these genes are brain-specific. <b>The</b> <b>data</b> <b>that</b> has been provided on gene expression in the brain has fuelled further research {{into a number of}} disorders. The long term use of alcohol for example, has shown altered gene expression in the brain, and cell-type specific changes that may relate to alcohol use disorder. These changes have been noted in the synaptic transcriptome in the prefrontal cortex, and are seen as a factor causing the drive to alcohol dependence, and also to other substance abuses.|$|E
5|$|Finally, within 36 {{hours of}} a game's {{conclusion}} (including {{the conclusion of a}} suspended game), the official scorer is required to create a summary of the game using a form established by the league. This task is performed for each game that is scored, including called games which must be completely replayed at a later date, and games that end in forfeit. The information in the score report includes the date, location of the game, the names of the teams, the names of the umpires who officiated the game, the final score, and <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>that</b> is required in rule 10.02.|$|E

5|$|The MSS was {{manufactured}} by Hughes Aircraft Company. The sensor {{was considered an}} experimental sensor, and was the secondary sensor, until scientists reviewed <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>that</b> was beamed back to Earth. After the data was reviewed, the MSS was considered the primary sensor. The MSS was a four-channel scanner that obtained radiometric images of Earth.|$|E
5|$|The {{investigation}} found that crewing {{of the train}} was insufficient. There was no traction inspector on board. WCRC had discontinued the use of traction inspectors by 2012. A traction inspector's duties include assisting the driver with the sighting of signals. Two members of the train support crew were also on the footplate of Tangmere, {{but they had no}} responsibility in respect of the operation of the train. No problems were found with the ability to sight signals SN43 and SN45. The locomotive and carriages from the train were tested separately following the incident; no fault was found with either, although some of the sensors were not being recorded by the On Train Data Recorder (OTDR). The RAIB were able to reconstruct the sequence of events from <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>that</b> was recorded by the OTDR.|$|E
50|$|Encapsulation is an {{object-oriented}} programming concept <b>that</b> binds together <b>the</b> <b>data</b> and functions <b>that</b> manipulate <b>the</b> <b>data,</b> and <b>that</b> keeps both safe from outside interference and misuse.

50|$|Regression {{analysis}} {{was one of}} the earliest such approaches to be developed. <b>The</b> <b>data</b> used to construct or discover a predictive relationship are called <b>the</b> training <b>data</b> set. Most approaches that search through training data for empirical relationships tend to overfit <b>the</b> <b>data,</b> meaning <b>that</b> they can identify apparent relationships in <b>the</b> training <b>data</b> <b>that</b> do not hold in general. A test set is a set of <b>data</b> <b>that</b> is independent of <b>the</b> training <b>data,</b> but <b>that</b> follows <b>the</b> same probability distribution as <b>the</b> training <b>data.</b> If a model fit to the training set also fits the test set well, minimal overfitting has taken place. A better fitting of the training set as opposed to the test set usually points to overfitting.|$|R
5000|$|Signal {{is a new}} safety finding within safety <b>data</b> <b>that</b> {{requires}} further investigation. There {{are three}} categories of signals: confirmed signals where <b>the</b> <b>data</b> indicate <b>that</b> there is a causal relationship between the drug and the AE; refuted (or false) signals where after investigation <b>the</b> <b>data</b> indicate <b>that</b> no causal relationship exists; and unconfirmed signals which require further investigation (more <b>data)</b> such as <b>the</b> conducting of a post-marketing trial to study the issue.|$|R

25|$|Traditionally, {{business}} {{departments have}} kept control of <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>that</b> {{is relevant to}} their own operations. Achieving the potential of big data driven demand modeling requires integrating this data to find correlations across the organization and marketplace. The connection patterns that are achieved enable faster, more relevant decision-making. Pattern-based analytic solutions provide insights into customer-buying patterns to guide supply chain planning and execution.|$|E
25|$|These {{applications}} demonstrate {{delving into}} aspects of <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>that</b> are hidden from shallow learning networks {{and the human}} senses, {{such as in the}} cases of predicting onset of sleep apnea events, of an electrocardiogram of a fetus as recorded from skin-surface electrodes placed on the mother's abdomen early in pregnancy, of financial prediction or in blind filtering of noisy speech.|$|E
25|$|The {{amount of}} data {{obtained}} in a single MR or CT scan is very extensive. Some of <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>that</b> radiologists discard could save patients time and money, while reducing their exposure to radiation and risk of complications from invasive procedures. Another approach for making the procedures more efficient is based on utilizing additional constraints, e.g., in some medical imaging modalities one can improve {{the efficiency of the}} data acquisition by taking into account the fact the reconstructed density is positive.|$|E

A sorting algorithm is stable if whenever there are two records R and S with the same key, and R appears before S in the original list, then R will always appear before S in the sorted list.|$|E
25|$|In {{honor of}} the 36th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing on July 20, 1969, Google took public domain imagery of the Moon, {{integrated}} it into the Google Maps interface, and created a tool called Google Moon.

It also included an Easter egg, displaying a Swiss cheese design at the highest zoom level, which Google has since removed. A collaborative project between NASA Ames Research Center and Google called the Planetary Content Project integrates and improves <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>that</b> is used for Google Moon.

25|$|Issei women's {{lives were}} {{somewhat}} similar, despite differences in context, {{because they were}} structured within interlocking webs of patriarchal relationships, and that consistent subordination was experienced both as oppressive and {{as a source of}} happiness. The Issei women lived lives of transition which were affected by three common factors: the dominant ideology of late Meiji Japan, which advanced the economic objectives of the Japanese state; the patriarchal traditions of the agricultural village, which arose partly as a form of adjustment to national objectives and the adjustment to changes imposed by modernization; and the constraints which arose within a Canadian or American society dominated by racist ideology. Substantive evidence of the working lives of Issei women is very difficult to find, partly for lack of data and partly because <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>that</b> do exist are influenced by their implicit ideological definition of women.|$|E
