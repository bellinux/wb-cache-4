40|$|This paper {{presents}} an adaptive functional-based neuro-fuzzy PID incremental controller structure {{that can be}} tuned either offline or online according to required controller performance. First, differential membership functions are used to represent the fuzzy membership functions of the input–output space of the <b>three-term</b> <b>controller.</b> Second, controller rules are generated based on the discrete proportional, derivative, and integral functions for the fuzzy space. Finally, a fully differentiable fuzzy neural network is constructed to represent the developed controller for either offline or online controller parameter adaptation. Two different adaptation methods are used for controller tuning, offline method based on controller transient performance cost function optimization using bees algorithm and online method based on tracking error minimization using back-propagation with momentum algorithm. The proposed control system was tested to show {{the validity of the}} controller structure over a fixed PID controller gains to control SCARA® type robot arm...|$|E

40|$|In 1967 a novel {{scheme was}} {{proposed}} for controlling processes with large pure time delay (Fellgett et al, 1967) {{and some of}} the constituent parts of the scheme were investigated (Swann, 1970; Atkinson et al, 1973). At that time the available computational facilities were inadequate for the scheme to be implemented practically, but with the advent of modern microcomputers the scheme becomes feasible.

40|$|Abstract- In {{industrial}} applications, {{when considering}} the performance of Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machines, {{it is worthy to}} note that the dimensional accuracies as well as surface finishes of parts produced by the machine tool rely strongly on the accuracy of the motion that each axis of the machine. The overall accuracy of the CNC machine tool is determined by the mechanical characteristics of the machine as well as the characteristics of the control system driving the individual tool. To maintain the quality of the finished product, it is necessary to optimise and sustain the level of accuracy of the machine tools so that defective parts can be prevented in manufacturing. A CNC Machine is programmed to travel along a predetermined path, and any deviation from the programmed path would constitute an error. The purpose of this project is to design a three-term (Proportional, Integral, and Derivative) digital controller to optimally improve the movement and accuracy of the control valve in anelectro-hydraulic servo-valve control system used in a numerical machine tool control and to accurately position the machine tool in the desired location on the workpiece. The <b>three-term</b> <b>controller</b> is designed to improve the phase margin lower than 0. 498 o degree, less than 5 percent overshoot, a settling time below 0. 0141 seconds and a rise time less than 5 seconds when subject to a unit step input, which reduces the damping ratio below 0. 182...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Due {{to their}} high power-to-weight ratio and low cost, {{pneumatic}} actuators are attractive for robotics and automation applications; however, achieving fast and accurate {{control of their}} position have been known as a complex control problem. The paper presents a methodology for obtaining controllers that achieve high position accuracy and preserve the closed-loop characteristics over a broad operating range. Experimentation {{with a number of}} conventional (or "classical") <b>three-term</b> <b>controllers</b> shows that, as repeated operations accumulate, the characteristics of the pneumatic actuator change requiring frequent re-tuning of the controller parameters (PID gains). Furthermore, <b>three-term</b> <b>controllers</b> are found to perform poorly in recovering the closed-loop system after the application of load or other external disturbances. The key reason for these problems lies in the non-linear exchange of energy inside the cylinder relating, in particular, to the complex friction forces that develop on the piston-wall interface. In order to overcome this problem but still remain within the boundaries of classical control methods, we designed an auto selective classicaql controller so that the system performance would benefit from all three control gains (KP, Kd, Ki) according to system requirements and the characteristics of each type of controller. This challenging experimentation took place for consistent performance in the face of modelling imprecision and disturbances. In the work presented, a selective PID controller is presented for an experimental rig comprising an air cylinder driven by a variable-opening pneumatic valve and equipped with position and pressure sensors. The paper reports on tests carried out to investigate the capability of this specific controller to achieve consistent control performance under, repeated operations and other changes in operating conditions.

40|$|Abstract:- New simple {{methods are}} {{presented}} for tuning <b>three-term</b> <b>controllers</b> for dead-time processes. The methods {{are based on}} appropriate manipulations of the exponential dead-time term in the denominator of the closed-loop transfer function for a servo problem, and, subsequently, on appropriately matching the coefficients of corresponding powers of s in the numerators of the resulting transfer functions and those in their denominators. This technique gives simple algebraic systems of equations for the controller parameters. The proposed methods are universal and can readily be applied {{to a wide variety}} of linear process models with time delay. Simulation results show that our methods provide improved performances as compared to the most recent tuning methods. Moreover, the controller settings obtained by the proposed methods give a robust performance for uncertainty in the process model parameters...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} shown, that {{stability}} regions for PID-controllers in a (KD, KI) -plane for fixed Kp are convex polygons. This result allows a simple {{calculation of the}} set of all stabilizing PID controllers for a given plant. In the present paper this result is transfered {{to the case of}} discrete-time PID <b>controllers</b> or <b>three-term</b> <b>controllers,</b> where stability with respect to the unit circle or other circles in the z-plane must be checked. Since the orientation of the cross section planes for polygonial stability regions does not depend on the plant, it is easy to find the set of all simultaneous stabilizers for several representative plant parameters and to select a robust discrete-time controller from this set. A benchmark problem for digital robust control is used to illustrate the metho...|$|R
40|$|The {{improvement}} of a recently developed method for closed loop nonparametric system identification using multiharmonic perturbation signals is described. Intended {{primarily as a}} method for the periodic online retuning of <b>three-term</b> <b>controllers,</b> the original method is shown to benefit from an improved selection of its design parameters. A brief review of the original algorithm is first given, followed by discussion of the improved parameter selection and an illustration of its benefits, {{with the aid of}} a typical numerical example. The result is a computationally efficient algorithm enabling nonparametric estimation of the process around the critical design frequency of interest, while also maintaining minimal disruption to the process output during the identification phase. Periodic online retuning of the controller is then possible without the need for any further relay tests beyond its initial commissioning...|$|R
40|$|In many {{industrial}} control applications {{the control}} action updating can be {{faster than the}} output measurement, leading to multirate (MR) controllers. In this paper, the controller design is approached based {{on the characteristics of}} each available sampling rate. The controller is split into two parts acting at different sampling rates. By the lowest rate sub-controller the main points of the desired response are determined while the response envelope, approaching the continuous time response of the controlled system is completed by the action of the fast rate control part. Cancellation <b>controllers,</b> <b>three-term</b> <b>controllers</b> and PID controllers are designed using this approach and promising results are obtained. 1. INTRODUCTION Data acquisition systems in industrial control applications have, in general, more time constraints than actuators, and as a result, different rates are used for control updating and output sampling. Some process variables are difficult to be directly measured an [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{deals with}} the design of {{controllers}} for large-scale linear time-invariant multi-input multi-output systems, {{such as those that}} often arise in process control. We focus on two standard controller objectives: (i) asymptotic reg-ulation subject to unmeasurable constant disturbances, and/or (ii) asymptotic tracking of constant set-points. In either case, standard output-feedback controller design methodologies typi-cally result in controllers that have order at least as large as that of the plant; for large-scale systems, the controller order can consequently be impractically large. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to introduce, for the subclass of plants that are open-loop stable, a low-order three-term (i. e., PID) multivariable control design approach that is practical to compute numerically, even for large-scale systems. A design algorithm and existence results to construct such a controller are given, and the approach is applied to several examples. Remarkably, at least for the examples considered, the <b>three-term</b> <b>controller’s</b> performance is quite similar to that achieved by the standard (much higher order) controller that solves the servomechanism problem.

40|$|Abstract: A {{filtering}} technique {{based on}} frequency aliasing which was initially developed for Iterative Learning Control is modified {{so that it}} can be implemented in real-time and is suitable for Repetitive Control. The aliasing technique is experimentally verified on a gantry robot facility, which manipulates payloads from a dispenser onto a constant velocity conveyor. A parallel arrangement consisting of a <b>three-term</b> feedback <b>controller</b> and a simple structure repetitive controller is used to control the robot. Without the aliasing technique, the combined control system becomes unstable very rapidly. In contrast, when the aliasing technique is applied, 1000 repetitions are successfully completed and no indications of impending instability can be seen. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of a real-time, dual-wavelength optical polarimetric system to ultimately probe the aqueous humor glucose concentrations {{as a means of}} noninvasive diabetic glucose monitoring is the long-term goal of this research. The key impact of the work is the {{development of}} an approach for the reduction of the time-variant corneal birefringence due to motion artifact, which is still a limiting factor preventing the realization of such a device. Our dual-wavelength approach utilizes real-time, closed-loop feedback that employs a classical <b>three-term</b> feedback <b>controller</b> and efficiently reduces the effect of motion artifact that appears as a common noise source for both wavelengths. In vitro results are shown for the open-loop system, and although the dual-wavelength system helps to reduce the noise, it is shown that closed-loop control is necessary to bring the noise down to a sufficient level for physiological monitoring. Specifically, in vitro measurement results with the closed-loop dual-wavelength approach demonstrate a sensitivity of 12. 8 mg∕dl across the physiologic glucose range in the presence of time-variant test cell birefringence. Overall, it is shown that this polarimetric system {{has the potential to be}} used as a noninvasive measure of glucose for diabetes...|$|R
