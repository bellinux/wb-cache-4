5|$|In {{the same}} year, Coca-Cola wanted Selena {{to become one}} of their spokespeople in Texas. The jingle used in her first two {{commercials}} for the company were composed by A.B. and Chris Pérez—the latter of whom had joined Selena y Los Dinos several months earlier as the band's new guitarist. Pérez began having romantic feelings for Selena, despite having a girlfriend in San Antonio. After a <b>trip</b> <b>down</b> to Mexico with the band, Pérez thought it would be best for them both to distance himself from her, but he found that impossible and chose to try to build a relationship with her. They expressed their feelings for each other at a Pizza Hut restaurant, and shortly afterwards became a couple. Pérez and Selena hid their relationship, fearing Quintanilla, Jr. would try to break it up.|$|E

25|$|The 1993 FA Cup semi-final match {{which took}} place at Wembley on 3 April 1993.

After a miscommunication the second downward train hit the carriages of the first, with no fatalities.|$|E
25|$|Kielce stadium can seat 15,550 fans, however, due to Polish regulations, {{which require}} a buffer zone between local {{fans and the}} {{visitors}} section, league matches can only accommodate 13,823 Korona fans and 777 visiting fans. However, on one occasion the stadium was full to capacity during a league match. This occurred during the 2006–07 season when fans of visiting club Legia Warszawa were prohibited from entering due to the vast number of their 'red brigade' supporters who made the <b>trip</b> <b>down</b> to watch their club in Kielce.|$|E
25|$|The {{site where}} Fort Randolph was built {{emerged as a}} {{strategic}} location {{in the years before}} the American Revolution. In the Treaty of Fort Stanwix of 1768, the British acquired title to present-day West Virginia from the Iroquois. Thereafter, British colonists and land speculators began to explore the region. One of the first to do so was George Washington, a planter and politician from Virginia, who in 1770 made a long canoe <b>trip</b> <b>down</b> the Ohio River to examine the land around Point Pleasant. Many other British colonists and surveyors did the same over the next few years.|$|E

Roberts rigs a gravity brake on the external scenic elevator allowing twelve people, including Mueller, the children, and a fireman one <b>trip</b> <b>down,</b> with the remaining eight being ladies chosen by lottery, including Roberts' girlfriend Susan. An explosion leaves the elevator hanging by a single cable, where Mueller falls to her death. A Navy helicopter saves the rest.|$|E
25|$|Once in South America, a new, {{far more}} ambitious goal was added: {{to find the}} {{headwaters}} of the Rio da Duvida, and trace it north to the Madeira and thence to the Amazon River. It was later renamed Roosevelt River in honor of the former President. Roosevelt's crew consisted of his son Kermit, naturalist Colonel Rondon, George K. Cherrie, sent by the American Museum of Natural History, Brazilian Lieutenant João Lira, team physician Dr. José Antonio Cajazeira, and 16 skilled paddlers and porters. The initial expedition started somewhat tenuously on December 9, 1913, {{at the height of the}} rainy season. The <b>trip</b> <b>down</b> the River of Doubt started on February 27, 1914.|$|E
25|$|Twain {{initially}} {{conceived of}} the work as a sequel to The Adventures of Tom Sawyer that would follow Huckleberry Finn through adulthood. Beginning with a few pages he had removed from the earlier novel, Twain began work on a manuscript he originally titled Huckleberry Finn's Autobiography. Twain worked on the manuscript {{off and on for}} the next several years, ultimately abandoning his original plan of following Huck's development into adulthood. He appeared to have lost interest in the manuscript while it was in progress, and set it aside for several years. After making a <b>trip</b> <b>down</b> the Hudson River, Twain returned to his work on the novel. Upon completion, the novel's title closely paralleled its predecessor's: Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Tom Sawyer's Comrade).|$|E

Coles wrote letters to President Madison and to relatives expressing dissatisfaction with the high land prices in Ohio, then with squatters, real estate speculators and fraudulent businessmen as he travelled further west into the Indiana (and what became the Illinois) Territory. In the Missouri Territory Coles bought some land for investment, before finally embarking in St. Louis on a keel boat for his <b>trip</b> <b>down</b> the Mississippi River to New Orleans, from where Coles ultimately sailed home to Virginia.|$|E
25|$|After a 3–1 home defeat to St Johnstone in February, United {{started their}} Scottish Cup {{campaign}} with a midweek <b>trip</b> <b>down</b> to Berwick Rangers after the match had been postponed. Owen Coyle scored twice to take United {{through to the}} next round, which was played against Dunfermline the following Saturday. Craig Brewster scored the only goal of the game at Tannadice and United were in the quarter finals. United then met Dunfermline again at East End Park as the teams drew 2–2, as the title chase picked up, with any one of five teams in with a chance of winning the League. Craig Brewster took his tally to 13 for the season with two goals in a 4–0 win over Morton at Tannadice.|$|E
25|$|By 1969 the Ho Chi Minh Trail was a {{sophisticated}} logistical web with paved roads, truck parks, maintenance and supply depots, and well organized and defended terminuses and bases, moving {{thousands of men}} per month into the battle zone. A fuel pipeline complete with pumping stations was even in place by 1969, and this was to multiply, together with other installations such as missile batteries, as the conflict extended. The need for massive amounts of manual labor for construction actually decreased on the Trail as heavy equipment like bulldozers and rock crushers were deployed, and both miles of road built and truck traffic expanded. By the war's end almost a million soldiers had made the <b>trip</b> <b>down</b> the Trail {{and tens of thousands}} of tons were being transported annually.|$|E
