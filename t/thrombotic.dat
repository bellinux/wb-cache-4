5|$|U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton {{was hospitalized}} on December 30, 2012, for anticoagulation {{treatment}} of venous thrombosis {{of the right}} transverse sinus, which {{is located at the}} base of the brain. Clinton's <b>thrombotic</b> episode was discovered on an MRI scan done for follow-up of a cerebral concussion she had suffered 2.5 weeks before after she fell while suffering from gastroenteritis.|$|E
5|$|On {{the first}} day one {{prisoner}} pleaded guilty to charges of riot and conspiracy to riot, and was also acquitted of the murder charge. The other defendants were also acquitted of murder due to the unreliability of eyewitness testimony {{and the possibility that}} White had died from a pre-existing <b>thrombotic</b> condition. On 16 April, four defendants including Paul Taylor were convicted of rioting, and the remaining four including Alan Lord were acquitted.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} {{is based on}} the combination of the symptoms, as very few other diseases cause the same symptoms together. Blood tests may show elevated creatinine and urea levels (in kidney involvement), raised IgA levels (in about 50%), and raised C-reactive protein (CRP) or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) results; none are specific for Henoch–Schönlein purpura. The platelet count may be raised, and distinguishes it from diseases where low platelets are the cause of the purpura, such as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and <b>thrombotic</b> thrombocytopenic purpura.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the fact}} that HIT predisposes {{strongly}} to new episodes of thrombosis, it {{is not sufficient to}} simply discontinue the heparin administration. Generally, an alternative anticoagulant is needed to suppress the <b>thrombotic</b> tendency while the generation of antibodies stops and the platelet count recovers. To make matters more complicated, the other most commonly used anticoagulant, warfarin, should not be used in HIT until the platelet count is at least 150 x 10^9/L because there is a very high risk of warfarin necrosis in people with HIT who have low platelet counts. Warfarin necrosis is the development of skin gangrene in those receiving warfarin or a similar vitamin K inhibitor. If the patient was receiving warfarin at the time when HIT is diagnosed, the activity of warfarin is reversed with vitamin K. Transfusing platelets is discouraged, as there is a theoretical risk that this may worsen the risk of thrombosis; the platelet count is rarely low enough to be the principal cause of significant hemorrhage.|$|E
25|$|A stroke is {{the rapid}} decline of brain {{function}} {{due to a}} disturbance in the supply of blood to the brain. This can be due to ischemia, thrombus, embolus (a lodged particle) or hemorrhage (a bleed). In <b>thrombotic</b> stroke, a thrombus (blood clot) usually forms around atherosclerotic plaques. Since blockage of the artery is gradual, onset of symptomatic <b>thrombotic</b> strokes is slower. <b>Thrombotic</b> stroke {{can be divided into}} two categories—large vessel disease and small vessel disease. The former affects vessels such as the internal carotids, vertebral and the circle of Willis. The latter can affect smaller vessels such as the branches of the circle of Willis.|$|E
25|$|People {{with severe}} RP prone to {{ulceration}} or large artery <b>thrombotic</b> events may be prescribed aspirin.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} recent studies {{suggesting}} that high-dose statin therapy plays a plaque-stabilizing role in patients suffering from {{acute coronary syndrome}} and <b>thrombotic</b> stroke.|$|E
25|$|Liver disease, HELLP syndrome, <b>thrombotic</b> thrombocytopenic purpura/Haemolytic uremic syndrome, and {{malignant}} hypertension may mimic DIC but do {{not occur}} via the same pathways.|$|E
25|$|HUS {{is one of}} the <b>thrombotic</b> microangiopathies, a {{category}} of disorders that includes STEC-HUS, aHUS, and <b>thrombotic</b> thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). STEC-HUS is usually preceded by a prodrome of diarrhea, which is often bloody, and is caused by Shiga-like toxin-producing bacteria such as enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC), of which E. coli O157:H7 is the most common serotype. Other serotypes also cause disease and can emerge as new causes of STEC-HUS, as occurred with E. coli O104:H4, which triggered a 2011 epidemic of STEC-HUS in Germany.|$|E
25|$|Upshaw–Schulman {{syndrome}} (USS) is the recessively inherited form of <b>thrombotic</b> thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), a {{rare and}} complex blood coagulation disease. USS {{is caused by the}} absence of the ADAMTS13 protease resulting in the persistence of ultra large von Willebrand factor multimers (ULVWF), causing episodes of acute <b>thrombotic</b> microangiopathy with disseminated multiple small vessel obstructions. These obstructions deprive downstream tissues from blood and oxygen, which can result in tissue damage and death. The presentation of an acute USS episode is variable but usually associated with thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA) with schistocytes on the peripheral blood smear, fever and signs of ischemic organ damage in the brain, kidney and heart.|$|E
25|$|Non-infectious {{diseases}} {{that may result}} in symptoms {{similar to those of}} EVD include acute promyelocytic leukemia, hemolytic uremic syndrome, snake envenomation, clotting factor deficiencies/platelet disorders, <b>thrombotic</b> thrombocytopenic purpura, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, Kawasaki disease, and warfarin poisoning.|$|E
25|$|Several microangiopathic diseases, {{including}} {{disseminated intravascular coagulation}} and <b>thrombotic</b> microangiopathies, {{present with}} pathognomonic (diagnostic) red blood cell fragments called schistocytes. These pathologies generate fibrin strands that sever red blood cells {{as they try to}} move past a thrombus.|$|E
25|$|The first {{historical}} records about AAA are from Ancient Rome in the 2nd century AD, when Greek surgeon Antyllus tried {{to treat the}} AAA with proximal and distal ligature, central incision and removal of <b>thrombotic</b> material from the aneurysm.|$|E
25|$|Desmopressin is {{contraindicated}} in vWD type 2b {{because of}} the risk of aggravated thrombocytopenia and <b>thrombotic</b> complications. Desmopressin is probably not effective in vWD type 2M and is rarely effective in vWD type 2N. It is totally ineffective in vWD type 3.|$|E
25|$|While {{in certain}} cases there is no {{identifiable}} cause, typical causes include problems in intrauterine development (e.g. exposure to radiation, infection, fetal growth restriction), hypoxia of the brain (<b>thrombotic</b> events, placental conditions), birth trauma during labor and delivery, and complications around birth or during childhood.|$|E
25|$|Some {{strains of}} C jejuni produce a cholera-like enterotoxin, which is {{important}} in the watery diarrhea observed in infections. The organism produces diffuse, bloody, edematous, and exudative enteritis. In a small number of cases, the infection may be associated with hemolytic uremic syndrome and <b>thrombotic</b> thrombocytopenic purpura through a poorly understood mechanism.|$|E
25|$|HUS {{was first}} {{defined as a}} {{syndrome}} in 1955. The more common form of the disease, Shiga-like toxin-producing E. coli HUS (STEC-HUS), is triggered by the infectious agent E. coli O157:H7, and several other non-O157:H7 E. coli serotypes. Certain Shiga toxin-secreting strains of Shigella dysenteriae can also cause HUS. Approximately 5% of cases are classified as pneumococcal HUS, which results from infection by Streptococcus pneumoniae, the agent that causes traditional lobar pneumonia. There is also a rare, chronic, and severe form known as atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), which is caused by genetic defects resulting in chronic, uncontrolled complement activation. Both STEC-HUS and aHUS cause endothelial damage, leukocyte activation, platelet activation, and widespread inflammation and multiple thromboses in the small blood vessels, a condition known as systemic <b>thrombotic</b> microangiopathy (TMA), which leads to <b>thrombotic</b> events as well as organ damage/failure and death.|$|E
25|$|Evidence for the {{important}} role antithrombin plays in regulating normal blood coagulation is demonstrated by the correlation between inherited or acquired antithrombin deficiencies and {{an increased risk of}} any affected individual developing <b>thrombotic</b> disease. Antithrombin deficiency generally comes to light when a patient suffers recurrent venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.|$|E
25|$|Common {{side effects}} include headache, nausea, easy bruising, itching, and heartburn. More severe side effects include {{bleeding}} and <b>thrombotic</b> thrombocytopenic purpura. While {{there is no}} evidence of harm from use during pregnancy, such use has been poorly studied. Clopidogrel is in the thienopyridine-class of antiplatelet agent. It works by irreversibly inhibiting a receptor called P2Y12, on platelets.|$|E
25|$|After {{widespread}} {{adoption of}} the COX-2 inhibitors, {{it was discovered that}} most of the drugs in this class increase the risk of cardiovascular events by 40% on average. This led to the withdrawal of rofecoxib and valdecoxib, and warnings on others. Etoricoxib seems relatively safe, with the risk of <b>thrombotic</b> events similar to that of non-coxib NSAID diclofenac.|$|E
25|$|Decreased {{platelet}} numbers {{may be due}} {{to various}} causes, including insufficient production (e.g., in myelodysplastic syndrome or other bone marrow disorders), destruction by the immune system (immune thrombocytopenic purpura/ITP), and consumption due to various causes (<b>thrombotic</b> thrombocytopenic purpura/TTP, hemolytic-uremic syndrome/HUS, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria/PNH, disseminated intravascular coagulation/DIC, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia/HIT). Most consumptive conditions lead to platelet activation, and some are associated with thrombosis.|$|E
25|$|Venous thrombosis; certain {{arterial}} <b>thrombotic</b> conditions; {{patients with}} deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral vein thrombosis, and premature ischemic stroke {{and also of}} women with premature myocardial infarction; family history of early onset stroke, deep vein thrombosis, thromboembolism, pregnancy associated with thrombosis/embolism, hyperhomocystinemia, and multiple miscarriage. Individuals with the mutation {{are at increased risk}} of thrombosis in the setting of oral contraceptive use, trauma, and surgery.|$|E
25|$|In <b>thrombotic</b> thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and {{hemolytic}} uremic syndrome (HUS), ADAMTS13 either is deficient or {{has been}} inhibited by antibodies {{directed at the}} enzyme. This leads to decreased breakdown of the ultra-large multimers of vWF and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia with deposition of fibrin and platelets in small vessels, and capillary necrosis. In TTP, the organ most obviously affected is the brain; in HUS, the kidney.|$|E
25|$|Clinical {{trials of}} protein kinase inhibitors, which block the {{abnormal}} kinase proteins {{involved in the}} development and growth of medullary cancer cells, showed clear evidence of response in 10-30% of patients. In the majority of responders there has been less than a 30% decrease in tumor mass, yet the responses have been durable; responses have been stable for periods exceeding 3 years. The major side effects of this class of drug include hypertension, nausea, diarrhea, some cardiac electrical abnormalities, and <b>thrombotic</b> or bleeding episodes.|$|E
25|$|Common adverse drug {{reactions}} (≥1% of patients) {{associated with}} systemic aciclovir therapy (oral or IV) include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, encephalopathy (with IV use only), injection site reactions (with IV use only) and headache. In high doses, hallucinations have been reported. Infrequent adverse effects (0.1–1% of patients) include agitation, vertigo, confusion, dizziness, oedema, arthralgia, sore throat, constipation, abdominal pain, hair loss, rash and weakness. Rare adverse effects (<0.1% of patients) include coma, seizures, neutropenia, leukopenia, crystalluria, anorexia, fatigue, hepatitis, Stevens–Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, <b>thrombotic</b> thrombocytopenic purpura and anaphylaxis.|$|E
25|$|Damaged {{valves and}} endocardium {{contribute}} to the development of infective endocarditis. Specifically, the damaged part of a heart valve forms a local blood clot, a condition known as non-bacterial <b>thrombotic</b> endocarditis (NBTE). The platelet and fibrin deposits that form as part of the blood clotting process allow bacteria to take hold and form vegetations. As previously mentioned, the body has no direct methods of combating valvular vegetations because the valves do not have a dedicated blood supply. This combination of damaged valves, bacterial growth, and lack of a strong immune response results in infective endocarditis.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, Hamilton {{caused some}} {{controversy}} when the cover for his debut album, This Perfect Life, was released, and the deceased producer, J Dilla, was named as executive producer. A handful of Dilla's closest associates through hip hop began {{speaking out against}} Hamilton's use of the name and its connection to his music. Hamilton later stated he wished to financially help J Dilla's mother, who had <b>thrombotic</b> thrombocytopenic purpura, the same illness that took J Dilla's life. J Dilla's name was later removed from the album artwork due to legal reasons.|$|E
25|$|The APPROVe {{study was}} {{terminated}} early when the preliminary {{data from the}} study showed an increased relative risk of adverse <b>thrombotic</b> cardiovascular events (including heart attack and stroke), beginning after 18 months of rofecoxib therapy. In patients taking rofecoxib, versus placebo, the relative risk of these events was 1.92 (rofecoxib 1.50 events vs placebo 0.78 events per 100 patient years). The results from the first 18 months of the APPROVe study did not show an increased relative risk of adverse cardiovascular events. Moreover, overall and cardiovascular mortality rates were similar between the rofecoxib and placebo populations.|$|E
25|$|Pre-eclampsia can mimic and be {{confused}} with many other diseases, including chronic hypertension, chronic renal disease, primary seizure disorders, gallbladder and pancreatic disease, immune or <b>thrombotic</b> thrombocytopenic purpura, antiphospholipid syndrome and hemolytic-uremic syndrome. It must be considered a possibility in any pregnant woman beyond 20 weeks of gestation. It is particularly difficult to diagnose when preexisting disease such as hypertension is present. Women with acute fatty liver of pregnancy may also present with elevated blood pressure and protein in the urine, but differ by the extent of liver damage. Other disorders that can cause high blood pressure include thyrotoxicosis, pheochromocytoma, and drug misuse.|$|E
25|$|Endovascular coiling {{refers to}} the {{insertion}} of platinum coils into the aneurysm. A catheter is inserted into a blood vessel, typically the femoral artery, and passed through blood vessels into the cerebral circulation and the aneurysm. Coils are pushed into the aneurysm, or released into the blood stream ahead of the aneurysm. Upon depositing within the aneurysm, the coils expand and initiate a <b>thrombotic</b> reaction within the aneurysm. If successful, this prevents further bleeding from the aneurysm. In the case of broad-based aneurysms, a stent may be passed first into the parent artery {{to serve as a}} scaffold for the coils.|$|E
25|$|Findings {{on general}} {{investigations}} (such as blood tests) are not specific for cholesterol embolism, which makes diagnosis difficult. The {{main problem is}} the distinction between cholesterol embolism and vasculitis (inflammation of the small blood vessels), which may cause very similar symptoms - especially the skin findings and the kidney dysfunction. Worsening kidney function after an angiogram may also be attributed to kidney damage by substances used during the procedure (contrast nephropathy). Other causes {{that may lead to}} similar symptoms include ischemic renal failure (kidney dysfunction due to an interrupted blood supply), a group of diseases known as <b>thrombotic</b> microangiopathies and endocarditis (infection of the heart valves with small clumps of infected tissue embolizing through the body).|$|E
25|$|Prognosis {{depends on}} the amount of lung that is {{affected}} and on the co-existence of other medical conditions; chronic embolisation to the lung can lead to pulmonary hypertension. After a massive PE, the embolus must be resolved somehow if the patient is to survive. In <b>thrombotic</b> PE, the blood clot may be broken down by fibrinolysis, or it may be organized and recanalized so that a new channel forms through the clot. Blood flow is restored most rapidly in the first day or two after a PE. Improvement slows thereafter and some deficits may be permanent. There is controversy over whether small subsegmental PEs need treatment at all and some evidence exists that patients with subsegmental PEs may do well without treatment.|$|E
25|$|In {{people with}} a low or {{moderate}} suspicion of PE, a normal D-dimer level (shown in a blood test) is enough to exclude the possibility of <b>thrombotic</b> PE, with a three-month risk of thromboembolic events being 0.14%. D-dimer is highly sensitive but not specific (specificity around 50%). In other words, a positive D-dimer is not synonymous with PE, but a negative D-dimer is, with a good degree of certainty, an indication of absence of a PE. The typical cut off is 500nbsp&μg/L, although this varies based on the assay. However, in those {{over the age of}} 50, changing the cut-off value to the person's age multiplied by 10nbsp&μg/L (accounting for assay which has been used) is recommended as it decreases the number of falsely positive tests without missing any additional cases of PE.|$|E
25|$|Organisation: {{following}} the <b>thrombotic</b> event, residual vascular thrombus will be re-organised histologically with several possible outcomes. For an occlusive thrombus (defined as thrombosis within a small vessel {{that leads to}} complete occlusion), wound healing will reorganise the occlusive thrombus into collagenous scar tissue, where the scar tissue will either permanently obstruct the vessel, or contract down with myofibroblastic activity to unblock the lumen. For a mural thrombus (defined as a thrombus in a large vessel that restricts the blood flow but does not occlude completely), histological reorganisation of the thrombus does not occur via the classic wound healing mechanism. Instead, the platelet-derived growth factor degranulated by the clotted platelets will attract a layer of smooth muscle cells to cover the clot, and this layer of mural smooth muscle will be vascularised by the blood inside the vessel lumen {{rather than by the}} vasa vasorum.|$|E
25|$|Patients with HUS {{commonly}} {{exhibit the}} {{signs and symptoms of}} <b>thrombotic</b> microangiopathy (TMA), which can include abdominal pain, low platelet count, elevated lactate dehydrogenase LDH, a chemical released from damaged cells, and which is therefore a marker of cellular damage) decreased haptoglobin (indicative of the breakdown of red blood cells) anemia (low red blood cell count)/schistocytes (damaged red blood cells), elevated creatinine (a protein waste product generated by muscle metabolism and eliminated renally, proteinuria (indicative of kidney injury), confusion, fatigue, edema (swelling), nausea/vomiting, and diarrhea. Additionally, patients with aHUS typically present with an abrupt onset of systemic signs and symptoms such as acute kidney failure, hypertension (high blood pressure), myocardial infarction (heart attack), stroke, lung complications, pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas), liver necrosis (death of liver cells or tissue), encephalopathy (brain dysfunction), seizure, and coma. Failure of neurologic, cardiac, renal, and gastrointestinal (GI) organs, as well as death, can occur unpredictably at any time, either very quickly or following prolonged symptomatic or asymptomatic disease progression.|$|E
25|$|Atypical {{hemolytic}} uremic syndrome (aHUS) is {{an extremely}} rare, life-threatening, progressive disease that frequently has a genetic component. In most cases it is caused by chronic, uncontrolled activation of the complement system, {{a branch of the}} body’s immune system that destroys and removes foreign particles. The disease affects both children and adults and is characterized by systemic <b>thrombotic</b> microangiopathy (TMA), the formation of blood clots in small blood vessels throughout the body, which can lead to stroke, heart attack, kidney failure, and death. The complement system activation may be due to mutations in the complement regulatory proteins (factor H, factor I, or membrane cofactor protein), or is occasionally due to acquired neutralizing autoantibody inhibitors of these complement system components, for example anti–factor H antibodies. Despite the use of supportive care, historically an estimated 33–40% of patients died or developed end-stage renal disease (ESRD) with the first clinical bout of aHUS. Including subsequent relapses, a total of approximately two-thirds (65%) of patients died, required dialysis, or had permanent renal damage within the first year after diagnosis despite plasma exchange or plasma infusion (PE/PI).|$|E
