5|$|A {{dense fog}} helped to cloud {{the advance of}} St. Hilaire's French division, but as they went up the slope the legendary 'Sun of Austerlitz' ripped the mist apart and {{encouraged}} them forward. Russian soldiers and commanders {{on top of the}} heights were stunned <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> French troops coming towards them. Allied commanders moved some of the delayed detachments of the fourth column into this bitter struggle. Over an hour of fighting destroyed much of this unit. The other men from the second column, mostly inexperienced Austrians, also participated in the struggle and swung the numbers against one of the best fighting forces in the French army, eventually forcing them to withdraw down the slopes. However, gripped by desperation, St. Hilaire's men struck hard once more and bayoneted the Allies out of the heights. To the north, General Vandamme's division attacked an area called Staré Vinohrady ("Old Vineyards") and, through talented skirmishing and deadly volleys, broke several Allied battalions.|$|E

25|$|At that time, {{the city}} of Turin had a {{population}} of 117,000 inhabitants.

In visiting the prisons, Don Bosco was disturbed <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> boys from 12 to 18 years of age. He was determined to find a means to prevent them ending up here. Because of population growth and migration to the city, Bosco found the traditional methods of parish ministry inefficient. He decided it was necessary to try another form of apostolate, and he began to meet the boys where they worked and gathered in shops and market places. They were pavers, stone-cutters, masons, plasterers who came from far away places, he recalled in his brief Memoires.|$|E

500|$|Ernest was {{fortunate}} in {{his support of}} victorious Prussia; many other petty German dukes, princes, and kings who had supported Austria suffered immensely at Hohenzollern hands. Hanover, Hesse-Kassel, and Nassau for instance were all annexed to Prussia {{at the expense of}} their respective rulers. Though he had only recently changed his political views, Ernest was allowed to ride at the head of his battalion during the victory parade. His eldest niece Prussian Crown Princess Victoria ("Vicky") was for one pleased with his Prussian support and commented [...] "I am not accustomed to hearing so much praise of Coburg here. [...] was not among the crushed and beaten foe, it is sad enough as it is <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> of one's friends suffering from the effects of their miscalculations". Victoria's husband Crown Prince Frederick was also pleased with Ernest's decision, writing in his journal 28 September 1871, that the duke's [...] "society always affords me peculiar pleasure, especially...when his heart beats so warmly for Germany".|$|E
500|$|In 1576, in a {{move that}} {{endangered}} Henry's throne, Francis allied with the Protestant princes against the crown. On 6 May 1576, Catherine gave in to almost all Huguenot demands in the Edict of Beaulieu. The treaty became known as the Peace of Monsieur because it was thought that Francis had forced it on the crown. Francis died of consumption in June 1584, after a disastrous intervention in the Low Countries during which his army had been massacred. Catherine wrote, the next day: [...] "I am so wretched to live long enough <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> people die before me, although I realize that God's will must be obeyed, that He owns everything, and that he lends us only for as long as He likes the children whom He gives us." [...] The death of her youngest son was a calamity for Catherine's dynastic dreams. Under Salic law, by which only males could ascend the throne, the Huguenot Henry of Navarre now became heir presumptive to the French crown.|$|E

There is an introductory part giving a general survey of the grass vegetation of W. Australia. It is a revelation <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that <b>so</b> <b>many</b> introduced and naturalised species had to be included; this striking invasion of 132 species affects a great change in the original vegetation...|$|R
60|$|I {{have still}} {{the sense of}} a noonday quiet that lingered with us after we left this church and which seemed to go with us to the Hospital of St. John of God, founded, with other {{hospital}}s, by the pious Portuguese, who, after a life of good works, took this name on his well-merited canonization. The hospital is the monument of his devotion to good works, and is full of every manner of religious curio. I cannot remember <b>to</b> have <b>seen</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> relics under one roof, bones of both holy men and women, with idols of the heathen brought from Portuguese possessions in the East which are now faded from the map, as well as the body of St. John of God shrined in silver in the midst of all.|$|R

In addition, I have the pleasure to welcome colleagues from central banks in the United States, Japan, and obviously from Europe, who will present their views. Further, we are happy to have several speakers from the private financial sector. And last, but by no means least, from academe. Bankers certainly understand the same kind of language.

Mrs. Kennedy liked the design, but resistance began in Cambridge, the {{first proposed}} site for the building, {{as soon as the}} project was announced. Many community members worried that the library would become a tourist attraction, causing particular problems with traffic congestion. Others worried that the design would clash with the architectural feel of nearby Harvard Square. By the mid-70s, Pei tried proposing a new design, but the library's opponents resisted every effort. These events pained Pei, who had sent all three of his sons to Harvard, and although he rarely discussed his frustration, it was evident to his wife. [...] "I could tell how tired he was by the way he opened the door {{at the end of the}} day," [...] she said. [...] "His footsteps were dragging.

60|$|Now, Mr. Carr was not {{remarkable}} for good looks, {{and in addition}} <b>to</b> having <b>seen</b> out <b>so</b> <b>many</b> summers, had also buried two wives. It will, therefore, be {{clear that he was}} scarcely the suitor that a lovely girl, conscious of capacities for deep affection, would have selected of her own free will; but, on the other hand, he was honest and kind- hearted, and, what was more to the point, perhaps the wealthiest wine- merchant in the city. Mildred resisted as long as she could, but want is a hard master, and a father's arguments are difficult to answer, and in the end she married him, and, what is more, made him a good and faithful wife.|$|R

50|$|What’s so {{important}} about the Christ that I discovered is that Jesus {{did not want}} to create a separate religion. Jesus did not believe that he was the unique son of God but was, rather, a very, very evolved mystic, who saw the possibilities for the total transformation of our world through an explosion of love consciousness. He was prepared not only <b>to</b> <b>see</b> it, like <b>so</b> <b>many</b> of our modern sages who talk about it, but actually to live it out in a most unnerving radical revolutionary challenging way. He challenged all the social lunacies of his and any other time, and was crucified for it—crucified by the religious and political establishment that his vision threatened.|$|R

I hope you will appreciate that it is also a bit frightening for me. I cannot possibly give an overview of the entire interface area. The time is too short and my background is too limited. So you should expect a biased view of some interfaces between operations research and computer science. Let me give a short preview. I will make only a few remarks on the impact of operations research on computer science and concentrate on the influence in the other direction. Another bias is the emphasis on the combinatorial side of operations research rather than on the nonlinear or stochastic ones. I will go through issues of computation, complexity and analysis of algorithms...|$|R
