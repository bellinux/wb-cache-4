Incoming CEO John W. Chidsey backed the payouts, stating that the financial firms spent considerable time and capital turning the company around.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Using {{a unique}} sample of {{matching}} stocks in China, this paper investigates the comovement between different stocks and its driving factors.
