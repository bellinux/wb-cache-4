5|$|Room 5 is of {{identical}} proportions as rooms 2 and 4. It was extremely well preserved, including the rear {{wall of the}} bench and <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> used {{as a model for}} investigations of the other rooms in Structure 4.|$|E
5|$|The dining room, on {{the other}} hand, saw {{extensive}} remodeling in 1895. The room size was increased by {{the construction of a}} bay window, parquet floor was installed, and <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> decorated in cherry woodwork, with a gilt and crystal chandelier and sconces. The only original item remaining left in <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> the fireplace mantel. The Pink Room, named for the pink damask which covered the walls in 1895, the library, the Best Chamber (Daisy Grubb's bedroom), was also extensively remodeled.|$|E
50|$|The {{walls are}} lined with {{cushions}} for seating and the centrepiece of <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>is</b> a sprawling candle holder with many candles. These candles <b>are</b> lit whenever <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>is</b> used for reflections.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Stove <b>Room</b> <b>is</b> {{located in}} <b>the</b> south {{part of the}} west wing. From spring to fall, <b>the</b> <b>room</b> {{contains}} many butterflies and the exhibit {{is known as the}} Butterfly Forest. The plants in <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>are</b> representative of <b>the</b> deep tropics, and <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>is</b> maintained at a temperature of 80 F during the day and 70 F during the night.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>are</b> {{variously}} {{considered a}} part of the Vatican Library and Vatican Museums. Some of <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>are</b> now used for the Vatican Collection of Modern Religious Art, inaugurated by Pope Paul VI in 1973.|$|R
5|$|On Christmas Eve, 1968, Apollo 8 {{went into}} {{orbit around the}} moon. Only ten years earlier, Kraft had joined Gilruth's newly founded Space Task Group. Now, the two men sat {{together}} in Mission Control, reflecting on how far they had come. Around them, <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> filled with cheers, but Kraft and Gilruth celebrated more quietly.|$|E
5|$|On June 18, 2009, a RiffTrax for <b>The</b> <b>Room</b> <b>was</b> released, {{featuring}} commentary by Michael J. Nelson, Bill Corbett and Kevin Murphy, {{formerly of}} Mystery Science Theater 3000. This was {{followed up with}} a live theater show by RiffTrax on May 6, 2015, which was shown in 700 theaters across the U.S. and Canada. The show screened once more on January 28, 2016 {{as part of the}} Best of RiffTrax Live series.|$|E
5|$|The Amber Room {{was begun}} in 1701 {{with the purpose}} of being {{installed}} at Charlottenburg Palace, the residence of Frederick, the first King in Prussia, at the urging of his second wife, Sophie Charlotte. The concept and design of <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> drafted by Andreas Schlüter. It was fabricated by Gottfried Wolfram, master craftsman to the Danish court of King Frederick IV of Denmark, with help from the amber masters Ernst Schacht and Gottfried Turau from Danzig.|$|E
50|$|The large {{courtyard}} <b>is</b> {{surrounded by}} <b>rooms</b> behind arched stoa. <b>The</b> corner <b>rooms</b> <b>are</b> reached by a diagonal passage. There <b>are</b> 28 <b>rooms</b> on ground floor, {{which have a}} window next to their door under the stoa facing the courtyard. Entrance to <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>is</b> over a step. The fireplace in <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> situated in <b>the</b> wall separating <b>the</b> <b>rooms,</b> <b>is</b> flanked by two small closets.|$|R
50|$|The doors between <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>were</b> made crooked {{on purpose}} {{so that they}} would close by {{themselves}} and not let the heat out. Most of <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>were</b> not heated and foot warmers were used in the winter.|$|R
5000|$|Texture Displacement: The {{illusion}} of distortion of physical objects in <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>is</b> created by <b>the</b> projector.

5|$|The Disaster Artist, Sestero's {{memoir of}} {{the making of}} <b>The</b> <b>Room,</b> <b>was</b> written in {{collaboration}} with Tom Bissell and published in 2013. A film based on the book, directed by James Franco, is scheduled for release on December 1, 2017; both the book and film received widespread critical acclaim. Additionally, the film inspired an unofficial video game adaptation titled The Room Tribute, which was released on Newgrounds in 2010.|$|E
5|$|The soundtrack for Silent Hill 4: <b>The</b> <b>Room</b> <b>was</b> {{released}} {{alongside the}} game in 2004, composed by Akira Yamaoka with vocals by Mary Elizabeth McGlynn and Joe Romersa. The Japanese version featured a second disk containing music by series composer Akira Yamaoka played along to the reading of traditional Japanese stories. The American version contained 13 exclusive tracks and remixes.|$|E
5|$|During the Tudor {{conversion}} of the abbey to a private house the south range was extensively rebuilt, and only the north wall of the medieval structure remains, which makes tracing the monastic layout difficult. Going east to west, first came the day stair, then the warming house where the communal fire burned constantly to allow the monks to warm themselves after long hours of study in the unheated cloister. <b>The</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> probably vaulted and had its great fireplace on the west wall to allow heat {{to rise to the}} refectory or dining hall next door. It is likely that, as at the great Cistercian house Fountains Abbey, the chamber above the warming house was the muniment room, where the abbey's charters, records and title deeds, {{as well as those of}} local lords, were kept.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>room</b> {{immediately}} behind <b>the</b> Music <b>Room</b> <b>was</b> {{set up by}} Imelda Marcos as her office. It {{later became}} President Fidel Ramos' private office. <b>The</b> <b>room</b> beyond <b>was</b> originally a small sitting <b>room</b> and <b>was</b> converted by President Joseph Estrada into his own office. President Arroyo decided to use <b>the</b> <b>room</b> as her office at first. Today, <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>is</b> used by <b>the</b> President to receive visitors.|$|R

5|$|In the {{accordion}} experiment, Home {{sat at a}} table, with Crookes and another observer {{on either side of}} him, each with a foot on one of Home's feet. Home inserted his hand inside a wire cage that was pushed under the table. One of Home's hands was placed {{on the top of the}} table, and the other inside the cage which held an accordion on the non-key side, so the keyed end was hanging downwards. The accordion was reported to have played musical sounds. However, the amount of light in <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> not stated, and {{the accordion}} was not observed in good light. According to Frank Podmore there was no evidence the accordion played at all, as the keys were not observed to have moved. Podmore suggested the musical sounds could have come from an automatic instrument that Home had concealed.|$|E
5|$|Silent Hill 4: <b>The</b> <b>Room</b> <b>was</b> first {{released}} in Japan on June 17, 2004. The game was shipped for its subsequent North American and European releases on September 7, with pre-ordering customers receiving the soundtrack for free {{with the game}} in the former market. The game, alongside its two PS2 predecessors, was re{{released in}} 2006 as part of The Silent Hill Collection European boxset, as a tie-in with the release of the Silent Hill film, and again in 2009. Microsoft has confirmed that their Xbox 360 console is backward compatible with the game's Xbox port.|$|E
5|$|South of {{the great}} hall was a two-storey {{building}} containing withdrawing chambers, dating from around 1200. Narrow windows opening onto the bailey were original but have since been filled in. The first floor was entirely occupied by the great chamber, furnished with a fireplace. In the south-west corner of <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> a door to a small room which was perhaps used as a safe. The ground floor {{was used as a}} cellar, through which the Carrickfergus Tower could be accessed. The polygonal tower was also accessible through the great chamber at first floor level. Fitted with latrines and a fireplace, it was an extension of the lordly accommodation provided by the great chamber.|$|E

25|$|A second hall {{is located}} downstairs; {{it is much}} smaller than the main prayer hall. <b>The</b> <b>room</b> <b>is</b> {{sometimes}} opened for Friday prayers and Salat al Eid. <b>The</b> <b>room</b> <b>is</b> mainly used for storage but opens every year for the Islam Festival Edinburgh.|$|R
5000|$|Jack Wood’s {{family are}} still {{involved}} with the football club today. <b>The</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>were</b> renovated in 2010 thanks to a bequeathment made by club stalward Dave Fisher after his passing. <b>The</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>are</b> {{now known as the}} [...] "Dave Fisher" [...] clubrooms.|$|R
5|$|The Sundial Room, {{also called}} the Meridian Hall, was once the {{residence}} of Queen Christina of Sweden, then newly converted to Catholicism. <b>The</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> further modified by two additions which gave it its current name: a sundial, and a delicate but sophisticated anemoscope which was fixed to {{the ceiling of the}} Meridian Hall. These were created by Ignazio Danti, the papal cosmographer, in association with the Gregorian Calendar Reform. The sundial consisted of a straight line in white marble running across the floor in a north-south direction, intended to measure the height of the Sun at noon according to the seasons of the year.|$|E
5|$|The Third of May {{is cited}} as an {{influence}} on Pablo Picasso's 1937 Guernica, which shows {{the aftermath of the}} Nazi German bombing of Guernica during the Spanish Civil War. An exhibition in 2006 at the Prado and the Reina Sofía showed The Third of May, Guernica, and the Execution of the Emperor Maximilian in the same room. Also in <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> Picasso's Massacre in Korea, painted in 1951 during the Korean War—an even more direct reference to the composition of The Third of May. The perpetrators in this painting were intended to be the United States Army or their United Nations allies.|$|E
5|$|The chapel was {{dedicated}} to Our Lady of Sorrows (also called the Madonna di Pietà or Mater Dolorosa). After being deconsecrated in the late 19th century, <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> used for other purposes, and only the limestone frame, where {{used to be the}} titular painting which was retrieved during restoration works in 1991, still remains from the chapel's original interior. An ornate fountain is located at the building's main courtyard, above which is a niche with a statue and above it an elaborate sculpture of the coat-of-arms of Pinto. Similar to the fountain of the first Castellania on site, it was supplied by water from the aqueduct.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> West Sitting <b>Room</b> <b>is</b> a parlour {{that has}} been the setting for many {{interviews}} with heads of state and Members of Parliament. <b>The</b> <b>room</b> <b>is</b> laid with original timber flooring from the 1930s. Displayed on the walls of <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>are</b> priceless replicas of Arab tapestry presented by the Sultan of Oman to President Ong Teng Cheong in the 1990s.|$|R
5000|$|After FDR left Harvard, <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>were</b> {{occupied}} by a succession of students until 1961. In June 1961, during Eleanor Roosevelt's visit to the College, {{the former first lady}} dedicated a plaque commemorating FDR's time there, and <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>were</b> converted into a study, officially named the [...] "The FDR Suite". After a brief return to student housing in the early 2000s, <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>were</b> finally set aside in perpetuity with the intention of creating Harvard's first memorial to Franklin Delano Roosevelt.|$|R
5000|$|In {{mathematics}} and logic, a vacuous truth {{is a statement}} that asserts that {{all members of the}} empty set have a certain property. For example, the statement [...] "all cell phones in <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>are</b> turned off" [...] will be true whenever there are no cell phones in <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> In this case, the statement [...] "all cell phones in <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>are</b> turned on" [...] would also be vacuously true, as would the conjunction of the two: [...] "all cell phones in <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>are</b> turned on and turned off".|$|R
5|$|The final large {{reception}} {{room on the}} first floor is the Hondecoeter Room (16), so named because of the three huge oil paintings by Melchior d'Hondecoeter (1636–1695), depicting scenes of birds in courtyards, which are fitted into the neo-Carolean panelling. The panelling was introduced to the room by the 3rd Earl Brownlow in 1876, when it was furnished as the principal dining room of the mansion. <b>The</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> initially created as a library in 1808 from {{the upper part of the}} earlier kitchen which had originally risen two stories. The West staircase (14) was originally a service stairs, and would have been plainer in decor, but by the late nineteenth century it was in regular use by the family.|$|E
5|$|This was {{the main}} family sitting room on the ground floor, with the south-facing grand window giving views to the gardens, and was remodelled by John Lyte in 1533. In the early 17th century Thomas Lyte added the wood {{paneling}} (including Ionic pilasters) and the internal porch: these decorative features also had the practical benefit of keeping out the drafts. In the 20th century <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> {{being used as a}} store for farm equipment. Sir Walter Jenner had the paint stripped from the panelling to reveal the original warm-coloured oak.|$|E
5|$|Another tradition, {{related by}} R.C. MacLeod, told of certain events {{which took place}} after an heir to the clan's chiefship was born. The story related how at this time, there was much rejoicing at Dunvegan Castle, and since the infant's nursemaid was anxious {{to join in the}} festivities in the hall below, she left the infant alone in her room. When the baby awoke, crying of cold, no human help could hear him in his secluded room; however, a host of fairies {{appeared}} and wrapped the infant in the Fairy Flag. Meanwhile, the clansmen banqueting below demanded to see the child and the maid was ordered to bring him forth. When she brought out the baby, wrapped in the flag, everyone gazed in wonder at the child and the garb wrapped around him. <b>The</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> filled with the fairies' song which declared that the flag had the power to save the clan three times. When the song ended, and silence fell across the crowded room, the flag was taken from the infant and locked in a chest where it has ever since been preserved.|$|E
50|$|The eastern {{extension}} {{takes the}} form of a long narrow <b>room</b> running <b>the</b> length of the building. A sliding timber door opens into the main hall. One end of <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>is</b> partitioned to form a commercial kitchen. <b>The</b> <b>room</b> <b>is</b> ceiled with sheeting.|$|R

50|$|In 1936-1937, {{the school}} {{district}} took advantage of federal Public Works Administration funds to add two classrooms, hallways, and restrooms. Heat for <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>was</b> provided by a boiler system, which replaced the wood-burning stoves used in the original classrooms. <b>The</b> intact boiler <b>room</b> <b>is</b> located in a small subfloor area underneath the boys’ restroom. <b>The</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>were</b> eventually equipped with oil heaters, and eventually gas heaters hung from the ceilings.|$|R
