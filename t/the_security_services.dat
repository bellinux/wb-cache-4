5|$|The {{question}} resurfaced {{again in}} February 2016, when the Institute of National Remembrance seized {{materials from the}} widow of Czesław Kiszczak, a former minister of the interior, that were said to document Wałęsa’s role as a spy for <b>the</b> <b>security</b> <b>services.</b>|$|E
5|$|Jasienica {{became an}} outspoken critic of the {{censorship}} in the People's Republic of Poland, and as a notable dissident, he was persecuted by the government. He was subject to significant invigilation (oversight) by <b>the</b> <b>security</b> <b>services,</b> and his second wife was in fact an agent of the communist secret police. For a brief period marking the end of his life, his books were prohibited from being distributed or printed.|$|E
5|$|The British Army {{maintains}} a standing liability {{to support the}} civil authorities in certain circumstances, usually in either niche capabilities (e.g. explosive ordance removal) or in general support of the civil authorities when their capacity is exceeded. In recent years this {{has been seen as}} Army personnel supporting the civil authorities {{in the face of the}} 2001 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth outbreak, the 2002 Firefighters strike, widespread flooding in 2005, 2007, 2009, 2013 and 2014 and most recently supporting <b>the</b> <b>security</b> <b>services</b> on Operation Temperer following the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Service</b> {{maintained}} close {{cooperation with}} the State Chancellery.

5|$|In 1973, Biko had {{enrolled}} for a {{law degree}} by correspondence from the University of South Africa. He passed several exams, but had not completed the degree at his time of death. His performance on the course was poor; he was absent from several exams and failed his Practical Afrikaans module. The state security services repeatedly sought to intimidate him; he received anonymous threatening phone calls, and gun shots were fired at his house. A {{group of young men}} calling themselves 'The Cubans' began guarding him from these attacks. <b>The</b> <b>security</b> <b>services</b> detained him four times, once for 101 days. With the ban preventing him from gaining employment, the strained economic situation impacted his marriage.|$|E
5|$|The People's Committees {{led to a}} high {{percentage}} of public involvement in decision making, within the limits permitted by the RCC, but exacerbated tribal divisions. They also served as a surveillance system, aiding <b>the</b> <b>security</b> <b>services</b> in locating individuals with views critical of the RCC, leading to the arrest of Ba'athists, Marxists, and Islamists. Operating in a pyramid structure, the base form of these Committees were local working groups, who sent elected representatives to the district level, and from there to the national level, divided between the General People's Congress and the General People's Committee. Above these remained Gaddafi and the RCC, who remained responsible for all major decisions. In crossing regional and tribal identities, the committee system aided national integration and centralization and tightened Gaddafi's control over the state and administrative apparatus.|$|E
5|$|Tintin {{and his dog}} Snowy {{visit their}} friends Captain Haddock and Professor Calculus at Marlinspike Hall. There, they learn that Bianca Castafiore, her maid Irma, pianist Igor Wagner and the detectives Thomson and Thompson have been imprisoned in San Theodoros for {{allegedly}} attempting to overthrow the military government of General Tapioca. Tapioca's government have further alleged that the plot was masterminded by Tintin, Haddock, and Calculus themselves. Tapioca invites the trio to visit San Theodores, promising them safe passage, but Tintin deems {{it to be a}} trap, leaving Haddock and Calculus to go alone. Once there, the Captain and Professor are taken to a rural villa, where they are closely monitored by <b>the</b> <b>security</b> <b>services.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Israeli <b>Security</b> <b>Service</b> Law, {{also known}} as the Israeli Defense Service Law, regulates the {{recruitment}} into military service for citizens of Israel. <b>The</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Service</b> Law replaced <b>the</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Service</b> Act of 1949, which made conscription a national routine rather than only requiring military draft during national security emergencies.|$|R

50|$|The Head of <b>the</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Service</b> of Ukraine {{serves as}} a {{director}} of <b>the</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Service</b> of Ukraine (SBU, national internal intelligence and counter-intelligence).

5|$|Yusuf {{has built}} a largely subservient and loyal {{apparatus}} by putting his fellow Majerteen clansmen in strategic positions. The National Security Agency (NSA) under General Mohamed Warsame (“Darwish”) and the so-called “Majerteen militia” units in the TFG army operate in parallel and often above other security agencies. Their exact number is hard to ascertain, but estimates suggest about 2,000. They are well catered for, well armed and often carry out counter-insurgency operations {{with little or no}} coordination with other security agencies. In the short term, this strategy may appear effective for the president, who can unilaterally employ the force essentially as he pleases. However, it undermines morale in <b>the</b> <b>security</b> <b>services</b> and is a cause of their high desertion rates.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, Biko {{broke his}} banning order by {{travelling}} to Cape Town, hoping to meet Unity Movement leader Neville Alexander {{and deal with}} growing dissent in the Western Cape branch of the BCM, which was dominated by Marxists like Johnny Issel. Biko drove to the city with his Coloured friend Peter Jones on 17 August, but Alexander refused to meet with Biko, fearing {{that he was being}} monitored by the police. Biko and Jones drove back toward King William's Town, but on 18 August they were stopped at a police roadblock near Grahamstown. Biko was arrested for having violated the order restricting him to King William's Town. Unsubstantiated claims have been made that <b>the</b> <b>security</b> <b>services</b> were aware of Biko's trip to Cape Town and that the road block had been erected to catch him. Jones was also arrested at the roadblock; he was subsequently held without trial for 533 days, during which he was interrogated on numerous occasions.|$|E
5|$|The nomenklatura {{political}} elite developed. It comprised leaders, administrators and managers within {{the ruling party}} structure, in all branches of central and local government and in institutions of all kinds. The nomenklatura members were appointed by the party and exercised political control in all spheres of public life, for example economic development, industry management or education. For the party, the privileged nomenklatura layer was maintained to assure the proper placement {{of people who were}} ideologically reliable and otherwise qualified, but the revisionist dissidents Jacek Kuroń and Karol Modzelewski later described this system as a class dictatorship of central political bureaucracy for its own sake. The Polish public widely approved the many social undertakings of the communist government, including family apartment construction, child care, worker vacation and resorts, health care and full employment policies, but the special privileges granted nomenklatura and <b>the</b> <b>security</b> <b>services</b> were resented.|$|E
50|$|Parker {{was educated}} at Churchill College, Cambridge {{where he studied}} natural sciences. He joined <b>the</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Service</b> in 1983.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>security</b> <b>services</b> took Biko to the Walmer {{police station}} in Port Elizabeth, {{where he was}} held naked in a cell with his legs in shackles. On 6 September, he was {{transferred}} from Walmer to room 619 of the security police headquarters in the Sanlam Building in central Port Elizabeth, where he was interrogated for 22 hours, handcuffed and in shackles, and chained to a grille. Exactly what happened has never been ascertained, but during the interrogation he was severely beaten {{by at least one}} of the ten security police officers. He suffered three brain lesions that resulted in a massive brain haemorrhage on 6 September. Following this incident, Biko's captors forced him to remain standing and shackled to the wall. The police later said that Biko had attacked one of them with a chair, forcing them to subdue him and place him in handcuffs and leg irons.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the writing, {{and also}} the filming stages of the series, the writers were advised by ex-MI5 {{officers}} who gave insight into how the characters operate and how their personal lives {{would be affected by}} it. Among the advisors were Nick Day, who worked in counter-terrorism in <b>the</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Services,</b> Viktor Abramkin, a UK-based former KGB officer, and Mike Baker, an ex-CIA agent. When including terrorists, the BBC often has the responsibility to portray people with as much balance as possible for both sides. The first series finale was heavily researched, as the episode was based on real life instances in which terrorists agreed to work with the authorities in Colombia. Meanwhile, a scene in which Tom and Patrick strip naked to ensure they are not bugged came from the producers' sources. The sources also advised the producers how to tail targets without being spotted.|$|E
5|$|Thus {{from its}} outset, the Yalta {{decision}} favored the communists, who enjoyed {{the advantages of}} Soviet support within the Soviet plan of bringing Eastern Europe securely {{under the influence of}} the Soviet Union, as well as control over crucial government departments such as <b>the</b> <b>security</b> <b>services</b> (this activity was initially dominated by Lavrentiy Beria's Soviet NKVD). Beginning in the later part of 1944, following the defeat of the Warsaw Uprising and the promotion of the populist program of the PKWN, the London exiled government's delegation was increasingly seen by the majority of Poles as a failed enterprise, its political-military organizations became isolated, and the resistance against the new communist political and administrative forces decisively weakened. The population was tired of the years of oppression and conflict and the ideas expressed in the PKWN Manifesto and their progressive implementation attracted widening social support. From 1944 in liberated areas, responding to promulgated slogans, workers spontaneously took over existing factory installations, established workers' councils, undertook reconstruction, activation and production. A considerable labor struggle and compulsion were necessary for the PPR to claim the factories and enforce its own rules.|$|E
