5|$|A {{few weeks}} after the conference, Mihailović sent Ostojić to {{establish}} a forward headquarters in Kalinovik in south-eastern Bosnia. Ostojić was to command an operation aimed at encircling and destroying Partisan forces in Bosnia, which was to use Chetnik units serving as Italian auxiliaries in Herzegovina and Montenegro, as well as other Chetnik units in the Lika region, northern Bosnia and northern Dalmatia. <b>The</b> <b>plan</b> <b>was</b> predicated on an Allied landing on the Dalmatian coast, which Mihailović believed was imminent. The outline concept was that the Chetniks would set up a corridor through the Italian occupied zone of the NDH as far as the Partisan liberated area in western Bosnia and Lika, neutralising the Italians through a combination of vague promises, encouraging them to surrender, and disarming them if necessary. <b>The</b> <b>plan</b> <b>was</b> finalised by early December 1942 at Mihailović's headquarters in Montenegro, and operations were planned to commence on 5 January 1943. However, the plan assumed that Mihailović's forces were unified, which they were not, and also that his authority extended to many more Chetniks than it did in reality.|$|E

5|$|A station {{here was}} part of the {{abandoned}} phase two expansion of the Fleet line (now Jubilee line). It had originally been planned in 1943, and was revived as a major transport plan in 1965. London Transport spent £10m (now £m) in 1972 safeguarding the route underneath Cannon Street and building reinforcements for laying a tube in the water-bearing ground around the station. <b>The</b> <b>plan</b> <b>was</b> abandoned in the early 1980s in favour of the current extension further south.|$|E

5|$|All the New Spain {{flotilla}} arrived safely at Vera Cruz during February and March 1553. <b>The</b> <b>plan</b> <b>was</b> {{to scrap}} eleven of the vessels and keep only five {{to make the}} return journey.

5|$|Both {{airborne}} divisions began {{landing at}} the same time, 10:00 on 24 March 1945.

The 5th Parachute Brigade would land on the northernmost DZ, DZ-B, and hold the area east of the Wesel railway line.|$|E
5|$|By August <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> <b>was</b> already behind schedule: severe {{shortages}} of stores and wages slowed {{work at the}} Brest shipyards, while the troops {{set aside for the}} invasion of Cornwall proved unreliable, deserting in large numbers. A practice voyage of the Cornish invasion fleet ended in total failure, as the small ships intended for the operation proved unable to operate in open water. <b>The</b> <b>plan</b> <b>was</b> dropped and the reliable soldiers from the unit were merged into the Ireland expeditionary force and the rest returned to prison. Reinforcements from the Mediterranean Fleet were also delayed: seven ships from the expedition under Contre-amiral Joseph de Richery had to shelter from the British blockade squadron in Rochefort, only arriving in Brest on 8 December, while a second squadron under Contre-amiral Pierre-Charles Villeneuve did not arrive until after the expeditionary force had departed.|$|E

5|$|Convair's {{proposal}} {{gained an}} order for two prototypes in late 1951. Twelve production aircraft were ordered before a prototype had even flown.

Four of this order were redesignated as service test vehicles, and an additional eight production aircraft were soon ordered as well.|$|E
5|$|Debates and {{negotiations}} on the limits and objectives of the future national park intensified.

5|$|Destroying this {{symbol of}} British naval power {{by means of}} a {{submarine}} would at least be a blow to British morale and, perhaps, threaten the British blockade and control of New York Harbor. <b>The</b> <b>plan</b> <b>was</b> to have Lee surface just behind Eagles rudder and use a screw to attach an explosive to the ship’s hull.

5|$|Graffham was envisioned {{as a way}} {{to bolster}} the aims of Fortitude North, and overall this aspect of <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> <b>was</b> successful.

As a result of the deceptions, German forces in Scandinavia were put on higher alert and were not transferred south to reinforce France.|$|E
