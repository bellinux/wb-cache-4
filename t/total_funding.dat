The syntactics in accounting theory is the theory of accounting structure, the semantics {{in the theory of}} accounting concepts, and the pragmatics is the theory of accounting purpose. The latter is the most important and the accounting theory is the system of pragmatics. In the pragmatics field, the purpose of accounting is to account for the corporate fund movements uniformly and wholly. In semantics, all the accounting elements (assets, liabilities, capital, revenues, expenses and income) are defined by the fund concept and they are the object language.
