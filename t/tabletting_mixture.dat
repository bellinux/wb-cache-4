40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the matrix {{strength}} of sodium chloride particles in pure sodium chloride tablets and in tablets compressed from binary mixtures of sodium chloride with low concentrations of pregelatinised starch. Because this study concerns {{the strength of the}} sodium chloride matrix, the tablet strength is reflected {{as a function of the}} sodium chloride volume fraction in the tablet. Starch particles in the <b>mixture</b> <b>tablets</b> decrease the sodium chloride volume fraction-tensile strength relationship compared with that of pure sodium chloride tablets. To determine the contribution of the sodium chloride matrix to the tablet strength, the starch particles were removed from the <b>mixture</b> <b>tablets</b> by heat treatment. Determination of the strengths of these heat-treated tablets reveals that the sodium chloride matrix strength determines the <b>tablet</b> strength of <b>mixture</b> <b>tablets</b> containing a single matrix of sodium chloride particles. The decrease of the sodium chloride matrix density in the three different tablets (pure sodium chloride <b>tablets,</b> <b>mixture</b> <b>tablets</b> and heat-treated tablets) is reflected by an increase of the median pore size. The matrix in sodium chloride tablets shows a higher tensile strength to median pore size relation than the matrices in the <b>mixture</b> and heat-treated <b>tablets.</b> Based on calculations according to the theory of elastic-brittle fracture, it is suggested that the initial presence of starch particles during tablet compaction causes the pores in the matrices of the <b>mixtures</b> and heat-treated <b>tablets</b> to be relatively more flat and longer. These pores weaken the sodium chloride matrix in the <b>mixture</b> and heat-treated <b>tablets</b> to a larger extent than the shorter, more spherical pores formed during compaction of pure sodium chloride. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.

However, {{a combination of both}} excipients resulted in sufficiently rapid disintegrating tablets with acceptable strength. The composition of the <b>tablet</b> <b>mixture</b> and the process of tablet manufacturing were optimised using statistical techniques. Next to the effects of the amounts of MCC and hydroxypropylcellulose (HPC) in the composition, the effects of the amount of water and the granulation time were evaluated. For the production of tablets both the effects of moisture content in the granules and compression force were studied. Simultaneous optimisation of crushing strength, disintegration time and ejection force of the tablets was carried out to find optimal regions in the design space for these tablet properties.

40|$|The {{process of}} tablet {{manufacturing}} with granulation {{is described as}} a two-step process. The first step comprises wet granulation of the powder mixture, and in the second step the granules are compressed into tablets. For the modelling of the pharmaceutical process of wet granulation and tableting, two models are constructed and compared. The first model relates the crushing strength (CS), disintegration time (DT) and ejection force (EF) of the tablets with process variables from both the wet granulation and tableting steps and the composition variables of the powder mixture. In addition to these predictor variables, the second model also uses physical properties of the intermediate granules to improve the predictive properties of the first model. Model 1 has to be used {{at the start of the}} process to find settings for the process variables and the composition of the <b>tablet</b> <b>mixture</b> that produce <b>tablets</b> with specific properties. Model 2 is used, in everyday production, for each new granulation batch. The granule properties may differ from batch to batch due to uncontrolled sources such as air humidity, temperature or other unknown features. With Model 2 these differences are taken into account, and the CS and DT are predicted better than with Model 1. The advantage of incorporating the measured granule properties in the second model is not only an improvement of the predictive power, but the second model offers also the possibility to use a control scheme for the second step of the process. This control scheme adjusts the variables of the tableting step to produce tablets that better meet the specifications. Because the granule properties are highly collinear and also dependent on the process variables of the first step, a partial least squares regression method has been used for the modelling.

Methods Polyox-based liquisolid formulations prepared using several non-volatile solvents (i. e. polysorbate 80, polyethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol 200 and polyethylene glycol 600) and then characterised using differential scanning calorimetry and powder X-ray diffraction. The influence of solvent on retarding the release of diltiazem HCl from Polyox-based liquisolid tablets compared to conventional physical <b>mixture</b> <b>tablets</b> was studied. Key findings Liquisolid tablets exhibited greater retarding properties compared to conventional tablets. The use of polysorbate produced a slower release pattern of the drug from diltiazem hydrochloride (DTZ) liquisolid tablets compared to propylene glycol and polyethylene glycol (200 and 600). The release retardation was decreased with the increase in the concentration of the drug within drug:solvent liquid medication used. Solid-state analysis suggested the presence of a fraction of the drug mass in a solubilised state within polysorbate in liquisolid powders.

Tablets made of sodium chloride only and tablets made of a mixture of sodium chloride (97. 5 % v/v) and starch (2. 5 % v/v) were compared. Tablets were subjected to a heat treatment to remove the starch. The pore structure was evaluated with mercury porosimetry and image analysis on SEM images. At comparable porosities the tensile strength of the <b>mixture</b> <b>tablets</b> was significantly lower than that of the tablets made of NaCl only, Visual inspection of the images suggested a structure with less connectivity of the grains for the heat treated <b>mixture</b> <b>tablets.</b> This was confirmed by the results of the algorithm calculating the relative path length. Image analysis showed that the pore size distribution shifted towards larger pores after the addition of starch. It was thus concluded that the lower mechanical strength of the tablets made of the binary mixture was caused by the more open pore structure and more larger pores as could be detected with image analysis.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the internal structure of tablets compressed from binary mixtures of sodium chloride and pregelatinised starch. The minimum particle diameter of pregelatinised starch inside <b>tablets</b> compressed from <b>mixtures</b> was {{calculated from the}} difference between the initial pore size distribution and the pore size distribution after removal of the starch particles by burning. Subsequently, the tablets were carefully crushed. These powders, consisting of almost only sodium chloride particles, were measured by laser diffraction. It was found that the diameter of the sodium chloride particles hardly changed, whereas the minimum diameter of starch particles strongly decreased during the compaction process. As an effect of the difference in yield pressure, the harder sodium chloride particles cause deformation of the softer starch particles, resulting in a change in particle shape. The pore size distribution of <b>tablets</b> compressed from <b>mixtures</b> of sodium chloride and starch is typically that of viscoelastic materials; the larger pores (> 5 μm) change, while the small pores stay constant in number and size. The median pore diameter in tablets compressed from the mixtures is higher than the median pore diameter in tablets compressed from the pure materials.

The biofilm culture showed also the protection against environment contained bile. Furthermore, the possibilities of drying procedures of biofilm cultures used as commercial technologies in pharmaceutical industry were studied. The comparison of freeze-drying and fluidization bed drying showed, that freeze-drying is more suitable method, which is able to achieve higher amount of viable cells after drying than fluidization bed drying. The effectivity of freeze-drying method is dependent on the selection of suitable cryprotective medium. In this case, about 90 % higher viability after freeze drying was achieved in comparison with fluidization bed drying. Finally, the industrial processing of probiotic strains into the solid dosage form was studied. Tablets should be produced at hardness between 70 and 90 N and water activity of <b>tablet</b> <b>mixture</b> can be maintained below 0. 3.

Therefore, {{the purpose of}} this study was to evaluate the effect of disintegrant type on the characteristics of FDTs. In this research, the tablets were fabricated by direct compression with the compression force of 1. 5 tons and using the different disintegrants components (chitin, chitosan, xylitol, microcrystalline celluloses, white bentonite and magnabite F). The physical properties of these tablets were determined. The xylitol tablets were rapidly disintegrated within 7 + 1 s, whereas that of the others was longer than 30 mins. The <b>tablets</b> containing the <b>mixture</b> of xylitol and other materials were subsequently fabricated since the hardness of the xylitol tablet was very poor. The disintegration time and wetting time of tablets containing 9 : 1 xylitol:Avicel PH 101 was shorter than that of the others. The contact angle of tablets containing xylitol and Avicel PH 101 at the ratio of 9 : 1 was lowest and surface free energy (SFE) of them was highest compared with the other formula. Moreover, scanning electron microscope (SEM) displayed that xylitol and tablets containing 9 : 1 xylitol:Avicel PH 101 had no disordered arrangement, therefore it could promote the disintegrating property effectiently...|$|R
40|$|Anionic polymer sodium {{carboxymethylcellulose}} (CELLOGEN® HP-HS and/or HP- 12 HS) was investigated {{for its ability}} to influence the release of three model drugs propranolol hydrochloride, theophylline and ibuprofen from polyethylene oxide (POLYOX™ WSR 1105 and/or Coagulant) hydrophilic matrices. For anionic ibuprofen and non-ionic theophylline, no unusual/unexpected release profiles were obtained from <b>tablets</b> containing a <b>mixture</b> of two polymers. However, for cationic propranolol HCl, a combination of polyethylene oxide (PEO) with {{sodium carboxymethylcellulose}} (NaCMC) produced a significantly slower drug release compared to the matrices with single polymers. The potential use of this synergistic interaction can be a design of new extended release pharmaceutical dosage forms with a more prolonged release (beyond 12  h) using lower polymer amount, which could be particularly beneficial for freely water-soluble drugs, preferably for once daily oral administration. In order to explain changes in the obtained drug release profiles, Fourier transform infrared absorption spectroscopy was performed. A possible explanation for the more prolonged propranolol HCl release from matrices based on both PEO and NaCMC may be due to a chemical bond (i. e. ionic/electrostatic intermolecular interaction) between amine group of the cationic drug and carboxyl group of the anionic polymer, leading to a formation of a new type/form of the active (i. e. salt) with sustained release pattern...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} {{the study of the}} {{properties}} of <b>tablets</b> from the <b>mixtures</b> of the dry binders composed from 75 % α- lactose monohydrate (Tablettose® 100) and 25 % microcrystalline celulose or microcrystalline celulose with 2 % of colloidal silicon dioxide (Prosolv SMCC®). The properties under study included the tensile strength and disintegration time in dependence on compression force, addition of two concentration of the lubricant magnesium stearate and a 50 % addition of the active ingredient ascorbic acid. The compression forces were 23, 25, 27 kN, {{in the case of the}} tableting material with the active ingredient only 25 kN. The compacts from the mixture of Tablettose 100 and Prosolv SMCC 90 were of higher strength and the effect of lubricants wasn't so expressive like at mixtures with microcrystalline celulose only. Disintegratiion time was prolonged with the increasing of the concentration of magnesium stearate, more in the case of microcrystalline celulose in the mixture only. In the presence of ascorbic acid, the strength of tablets was decreased, the difference in the values of strength of tablets with silicified microcrystalline celulose and microcrystalline celulose wasn't. Ascorbic acid shorted the disintegration time too and more in the case of the mixture with Prosolv SMCC 90...|$|R
