5|$|Discovered in 1995, the Pyxis {{globular}} cluster is a 13.3 ± 1.3 billion year-old {{globular cluster}} situated around 130,000 light-years distant from Earth and around 133,000 light-years {{distant from the}} centre of the Milky Way—a region not previously thought to contain globular clusters. Located in the galactic halo, it was noted to lie on <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>plane</b> as the Large Magellanic Cloud and the possibility has been raised that it might be an escaped object from that galaxy.|$|E

Instead, they flew from Los Angeles to Qatar, via Washington and London.

5|$|Chappuis {{was rescued}} by an Italian partisan, Aldo Comucci, a 21-year-old {{who was in}} charge of one of the many {{underground}} groups operating in the area. Comucci and his band of resistance fighters got to Chappuis before the Germans and hid him and two other American flyers from <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>plane</b> for nearly three months until the end of the war. The partisans passed Chappuis and the two other Americans from house to house, and village to village, toward the Swiss frontier. Dressed in shawls — but still wearing G.I. shoes — they once walked undetected past a German sentry.|$|E

5|$|The mass of Gliese 876 d from radial {{velocity}} has one problem, {{it is that}} only a lower limit on the mass can be obtained. This is because the measured mass value also depends on the orbital inclination, which in general is unknown. However, models incorporating the gravitational interactions between the resonant outer planets enables the inclination of the orbits to be determined. This reveals that the outer planets are nearly coplanar with an inclination of around 59° {{with respect to the}} plane of the sky. Assuming that Gliese 876 d orbits in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>plane</b> as the other planets, the true mass of the planet is revealed to be 6.83 times the mass of Earth.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two main}} classes of comet: short-period comets (also called {{ecliptic}} comets) and long-period comets (also called nearly isotropic comets). Ecliptic comets have relatively small orbits, below 10AU, and follow the ecliptic plane, <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>plane</b> in which the planets lie. All long-period comets have very large orbits, {{on the order of}} thousands of AU, and appear from every direction in the sky. Oort noted that there was a peak in numbers of long-period comets with aphelia (their farthest distance from the Sun) of roughly 20,000AU, which suggested a reservoir at that distance with a spherical, isotropic distribution.|$|E
5|$|Eris's orbit {{is highly}} eccentric, and brings Eris to within 37.9AU of the Sun, a typical {{perihelion}} for scattered objects. This {{is within the}} orbit of Pluto, but still safe from direct interaction with Neptune (29.8–30.4AU). Pluto, on the other hand, like other plutinos, follows a less inclined and less eccentric orbit and, protected by orbital resonance, can cross Neptune's orbit. It is possible that Eris is in a 17:5resonance with Neptune, though further observations {{will be required to}} check that hypothesis. Unlike the eight planets, whose orbits all lie roughly in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>plane</b> as the Earth's, Eris's orbit is highly inclined: It is tilted at an angle of about 44degrees to the ecliptic. In about 800years, Eris will be closer to the Sun than Pluto for some time (see the graph at the right).|$|E
50|$|The {{alternative}} name great rhombicuboctahedron {{refers to}} the fact that the 12 square faces lie in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>planes</b> as <b>the</b> 12 faces of the rhombic dodecahedron which is dual to the cuboctahedron. Compare to small rhombicuboctahedron.|$|R

5|$|It is {{probable}} that the planet is composed of hydrogen and helium. The planet orbits on <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>plane</b> as Kepler-9b, a second and larger gas giant located in the Kepler-9 system. While observing the planet, the Kepler team noticed that Kepler-9b and c orbited in a 1:2 ratio, where Kepler-9b orbits its star every 19 days and Kepler-9c orbits every 38 days. The gravitational pull that each planet has on the other, known as orbital resonance, keeps the planets in a stable orbit. This phenomenon {{is the first of}} its kind seen outside the Solar System. Every time Kepler-9c completed an orbit during the observation period, its orbital period decreased by about 39 minutes. At some point, however, this trend will reverse and its orbit will increase. The lengths of its orbit will oscillate slightly above and below the 2:1 ratio.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the major}} bodies of the Solar System orbit the Sun in nearly <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>plane.</b> This is likely due {{to the way in}} which the Solar System formed from a protoplanetary disk. Probably the closest current {{representation}} of the disk is known as the invariable plane of the Solar System. Earth's orbit, and hence, the ecliptic, is inclined a little more than 1° to the invariable plane, and the other major planets are also within about 6° of it. Because of this, most Solar System bodies appear very close to the ecliptic in the sky. The ecliptic is well defined by the motion of the Sun. The invariable plane is defined by the angular momentum of the entire Solar System, essentially the summation of all of the orbital motions and rotations of all the bodies of the system, a somewhat uncertain value that requires precise knowledge of every object in the system. For these reasons, the ecliptic is used as the reference plane of the Solar System out of convenience.|$|E
