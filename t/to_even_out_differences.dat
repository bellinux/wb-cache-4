The study shows that there is a lack of national management of predefined headings deployed in both electronic health records and national quality registries.

In an attempt to establish the gendered nature of sport participation in a Durban Primary School, based on existing, theoretical, comparative and historical literature, the data revealed that boys generally participated more actively in sport. However, the data also revealed that girls benefited from the school's sport policy, which encouraged boys and girls to participate. In particular, Indian girls played more sport than Indian boys. My findings, based {{on the use of}} qualitative and quantitative data received from the participants in terms of their questionnaires, revealed that Indian boys/girls dominate in terms of participation while African boys and girls are very sports active and tend to make more use of the school's sport policy than the majority of Indian girls. Unsurprisingly, many more boys than girls were opposed to girls playing soccer. About 25 % of boys in each race groups were opposed to girls playing soccer. Predictably the vast majority of girls across race groups favoured soccer being played by girls. My semi-structured interview with the Principal revealed that he was 'sports mad' as he enthusiastically promoted sport at the school, regardless of gender and race. My focus was on the efforts that were consciously made to create sport as an arena of gender and racial mixing, In so doing, the following key questions were focused on: What is the rate of participation at J. C. Primary in terms of race and gender? In terms of participation rates, which sport is the most popular amongst boys and girls? Are there any differences in the ways boys and girls view sport participation at J. C. Primary? What does the school currently do to promote or encourage sport participation at school, particularly insofar as gender-equal participation is concerned? I had observed that although there was a trend for boys to be given preferential treatment in sport than girls, at J. C. Primary the school's sporting policy impacted in a positive way <b>to</b> <b>even</b> <b>out</b> <b>differences</b> and inequalities in sport participation between boys and girls. Although schools and other agencies are implicated {{in the manner in which}} sport is played, whereby gender inequality is practiced, boys and girls at J. C.

It has also shown that the school's policy has been successful in promoting equal gender participation even though, historically, most sporting cultures have been predominantly male...|$|E
40|$|Organic milk {{production}} in Norway {{has become more}} intensive, which, among other things, has led to increased focus on forage quality. The primary growth (PG) is harvested at an earlier stage of development with the consequence {{that more than half}} of the total yearly yield is from the regrowth (RG, second and third cuts). The RG contains a high proportion of clover. Thus, the RG forage has likely high crude protein content, while the PG forage has high energy value but low protein content. The use of fish meal as feed to ruminants is now prohibited, also in Norway, and alternative feed protein sources are expensive. The value of on-farm grown forage is therefore becoming even higher. The project aims to bring to light knowledge that makes dairy farmers better prepared to produce forage in high quantities and qualities as allowed by local climate and resources, adapt forage and {{milk production}} better to these constraints,and assess the economics, resource use and environmental impacts linked to forage production and feed ration with high forage quality. Specifically, the research conducted in the project seeks to answer the following questions: -	Little is known about the yield and forage quality formation in RG and how the RG should be divided between a second and a third cut under different climatic conditions. So when ought the RG to be harvested? -	Are early red clover varieties better suited than late ones in intensive harvesting regimes when it comes to sustain high yields and <b>to</b> <b>even</b> <b>out</b> <b>differences</b> in forage yield and quality between cuts? -	Will other grasses than timothy and meadow fescue perform better as companion species to red clover under intensive harvesting regimes? Are grass species and variety mixtures that are less synchronous in generative development better? -	 How should forage with high clover proportion be preserved in order to ensure high preservation of the forage protein? -	Is it possible to utilize that PG and RG silages have different feed quality by mixing them when fed? What is the best proportion of respective types in rations for high yielding cows? -	What is won and what is lost in economic terms when applying intensive harvesting regime? -	Will a mixing of PG and RG silages at feeding reduce methane emission and nitrogen loss in the cow and from the slurry storage? The primary objective is to improve the basis for tactical and strategic choices in the production, use and utilisation of grassland forage in organic milk production. Secondary objectives are to: 1. Evaluate the potentials and options for legume based boosting of grassland yield 2. Evaluate the RG yield and quality formation 3. Evaluate diets to high yielding dairy cows - balancing PG and RG grass/red clover silage 4. Evaluate the effects of different dietary mixtures of PG and RG on enteric methane emissions and methane and N emissions from slurry storage 5.

40|$|There are {{increasing}} {{problems related to}} the eating habits of young people, with consequences such as increased obesity and learning difficulties. This {{has led to an}} increased focus on how to change the eating habits of young people. One such strategy related to the school setting, is to establish school meal systems to increase the availability of healthy food. It is most often the responsibility of the individual student to choose to buy the healthy school food, but in order to promote such choices, the students often recieve information about healthy food. This information is often focused on the connection between eating habits and lifestyle deseases These methods have proven rather inefficient in their attempts to change the eating habits of the students, which can be explained with the fact that choice of food is {{made on the basis of}} many other aspects than just knowlegde about nutrition and deseases. For the purpose of making long-range changes towards a more healthy way of eating, this thesis includes the following two focuspoints. On the basis of two cases the thesis first examines which factors influence the student's understandings and preferences of food. Secondly it explores the barriers and possibilities of expanding the school meal systems, to include an attempt to change the student’s attitude towards food. This is expressed in the concept of food education (translated from the danish word ”maddannelse”). Education in this sense is understood as much more than providing the students with information and literary knowlegde. It also contains practical experience and the accumulation of an aesthetic consiousness. I have used a qualitative approach, and the analysis is based on groupinterviews with student and employees, supplemented with my own observations during visits in school kitchens for two or three days. The thesis consist of a theoretical discussion of the understanding of health, with a background in a holistic understanding of health and health promotion. Furthermore it includes a theoretical discussion of taste and of how the underlying understanding of food is created. The thesis also includes an analysis of the two cases, with the purpose of examining the above mentioned issues. The conclusion can be summarized into the following points: The social context, in which food is experienced, is an important factor that influences the student's 8 desire to eat different kind of food. Furthermore the analysis indicates that students are more willing to eat a varying selection of food, and food that they are not familiar with, when they have been introduced to a broad selection of food while growing up. This is also more likely to happen if their preferences are created on the basis of an understanding of food quality and an aesthetic consiousness, and not just former taste experiences. The analysis also suggests that the preferences of the students are less influenced by the fastfood industry, when these elements are present. Additionally the thesis concludes that students find it difficult to change their choice of food on the basis of knowlegde about food alone, if knowlegde is not supported by practical experiences. This problem is very clearly related to healthy eating. A key point is therefore that a change towards healthy eating will only happen, if the student's understanding of healthy food is combined with their understanding of good food, and that practical experience is essential in achieving this. It also appeared to be important for the student's commitment, attitude and willingnes to eat the school food, that they have a feeling of actual influence on what kind of food is made, aswell as on the organisation of their participation in making the food. It also seems important that the adults show confidence in the students and do not monitor the students unnecessarily. It was possible to point to certain organisational framesettings, that made it easier to implement a perspective of food education in the school meal system. It is optimal to make the school meal system a joint arrangement where all students and teachers eat the same food when at school. This has an educational effect and helps <b>to</b> <b>even</b> <b>out</b> <b>differences</b> amongst the students. This also helps create a solid economical foundation for the making of the school meals. It is also most optimal for the students to be involved in the kitchen several times during their school years and for a timeperiod that makes immersion possible. The thesis also concludes that the current legislation, guidelines and ressources given to the public schools do not support the implementation of this perspective sufficiently. In spite of this it is still possible to work with aspects of food education in public schools, though this requires great motivation and prioritisation among the school leaders and employees in the school kitchen...|$|E

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{the present}} study is to examine the {{distribution}} of plasma excitatory and inhibitory amino acids, according to the age and current breath alcohol levels (BrAl +/-), of alcohol-dependent patients. Participants and Methods: 78 alcohol-dependent patients (mean age = 46. 2 +/- 11 years, men/women = 54 / 24) were clinically tested, including the determination of the major excitatory as well as inhibitory amino acids. The independent variables were gender, age and current alcohol consumption measured with the breath alcohol level (BrAl +/- status). Results: In comparison to BrAl negatives, BrAl positives had higher plasma levels of glutamic acid (P = 0. 01) and proline (P = 0. 026), and lower levels of aminobutyric acid (P = 0. 002), serine (P = 0. 031) and urea (P = 0. 01). In the BrAl positives, no age effect was found related to the plasma amino acids. In contrast, the BrAl negatives displayed age-related differences. The older (>= 50 years) BrAl negative patients had higher plasma levels of cystine, tyrosine, citrulline and urea, and lower histidine levels, compared to the younger group (< 50 years). In general, differences in plasma levels of certain amino acids were dependent on gender, BrAl status, age and biochemical markers (GGT, MCV) of alcohol abuse. Conclusions: Abstaining patients (BrAl-/) display age-related differences in AAs' distribution, while active drinking (BrAl+/) seems <b>to</b> <b>even</b> <b>out</b> those <b>differences,</b> underpinning the hypothesis that drinking mimics changes seen with advanced age...|$|R
50|$|Most of the {{original}} settlers of Iceland came from Western Norway, bringing with them the western dialect of Old Norse. Due to its geographic isolation and consequent lack of influence from other stratum languages, {{the development of the}} language was entirely independent. However, {{it would be wrong to}} suggest that the language that was brought to Iceland was completely homogeneous; even though most of the settlers were from western Norway, there were a number from other parts of the country and also from other Scandinavian countries. Therefore the language that grew up in Iceland was influenced by all of the Norwegian dialects of the time. The close intermingling of the people of the island, especially at the Alþingi (the general meeting that took place at the beginning of each summer at Þingvellir) contributed <b>to</b> <b>even</b> <b>out</b> the <b>differences</b> between the various dialects: traits common to all dialects were reinforced, while the most marked differences gradually disappeared. Although it is not known exactly how the language developed, modern Icelandic has evolved less than other Scandinavian languages. The unique development of Icelandic, which eventually resulted in its complete separation from Norwegian and the other Scandinavian languages, began with the landnám or first settlement. Icelandic has lost all trace of the tonal nature of early Scandinavian languages, traces of which are noticeable in modern Norwegian and especially Swedish. Research has been carried out to identify certain traits of the language, for example the so-called preaspiration, but the results were inconclusive. Icelandic shares such characteristics with two other languages: Faroese and the Swedish spoken in Finland.|$|R

While the Pink Team resort to just jamming shims in <b>to</b> <b>even</b> <b>out</b> the <b>difference</b> (something that the expert sharply criticize them for), the Blue Team end up remaking their entire frame, which takes up so much time that they fail to come anywhere close to finishing. Nonetheless, the experts compliment the Blue Team for the high quality of the work that they did finish, and note that Jesse and Holly have developed {{what appears to be the}} strongest team dynamic. The Green Team get the job finished, but the door is a little tight, and more significantly they did not build a new frame and re-used the existing one. While the experts are critical of this, and even moreso the fact that it took them 75 minutes before getting anything accomplished on the job, they nonetheless accept Jake's reasoning that the door frame was supporting the roof, and would have been too dangerous to remove outright. The Red Team, who felt that they had a point to prove in this challenge, successfully replace their door (a more difficult task than faced by most of the other teams, due to their unlevel cabin), almost perfectly, the only major issue being messy usage of expanding spray foam. This results in Fabian and Luayn easily being named the challenge winners.|$|R
40|$|An {{agricultural}} ecosystem is an ecosystem managed with a purpose, usually to produce crops or animal products. Agricultural ecosystems are designed by humans, and {{are based on}} a long chain of experience and experiments. The emphasis in, for example, Western Europe has changed from maximum productivity only to also include environmental considerations, such as reduction of nutrient losses to groundwater and maintaining an open landscape with high biodiversity, etc. In less-productive regions such as sub-Saharan Africa, environmental considerations still have low priority. Agricultural ecosystems comprise almost 40 % (5 Gha) of the total land area of the Earth. About 11 % of the total land area is arable land (cultivated with crops), and approximately 27 % of the total land area is under permanent pasture, grazed by cattle, goats, sheep, camels, etc. Plant biodiversity is extremely low – if weed control is successful there may be only one species present. In spite of this, belowground biodiversity can be high, although often lower than in natural ecosystems. Ecological research performed in agricultural systems has advantages compared with research in most natural ecosystems, since agricultural fields are ‘homogenized’, that is, trees, larger stones, etc. are removed and regular soil cultivation <b>to</b> some extent <b>evens</b> <b>out</b> <b>differences</b> in topsoil properties over time...|$|R

ICD {{is meant to}} have two effects; first is <b>to</b> <b>even</b> <b>out</b> the pressure <b>difference</b> between heel and toe of the well, which is caused by pressure drop in tubing, second is to choke back zones with dominating production. Both effects are meant to yield a more balanced inflow-profile in a well. Forstudy of these tools Gullfaks South model which has been received from Statoil has been used. The first chapter provides a brief introduction to the Gullfaks field and production aspects regarding its thin oil column. This represents {{the first part of}} this thesis. In later chapter the annulus flow potential in Gullfaks wells have been analyzed and evaluated based upon results from the Eclipse simulation tool. The main purpose has been to evaluate the effect of annulus flow with implemented annulus packers. In other words, evaluation of the effect of ICV with a consideration of pressure drop in a well due to friction, acceleration and phase slip which is important factor in horizontal wells has been done. The effect of advanced completion has been studied with a use of software Petrel. Well representing Multi-lateral G- 2 T 3 H has been drilled and advanced completion was done with a use of software. Also the effect of aquifer has been studied. The presence of active aquifer in a model with advanced completed well did not affect the cumulative oil production. Also, attempts have been made on decreasing the number of packers in a well. However it turned outto be unsuccessful due to simulation problems. Consequently packers have been placed between each Inflow Control Valve. Also it has been observed that, gas and water break through is found to often take place near the heel of the well. Therefore keeping the valves near the heel half or less open during the production provided relatively better drainage of oil from the toe and the branches of the well. In final chapter for finding optimized ICV completion for a given well, various scenarios has been studied. ICV implementation showed better results with higher recovery factor. The flow of water and gas has been delayed which allowed to produce oil from toe of the well. Also, it provided better production from the branch of the well. </p...|$|R
40|$|Vacuum {{harvested}} peatlands do {{not easily}} regain their hydrological function after peat production therefore restoration {{is required to}} create hydrological conditions appropriate {{for the growth of}} peat producing fen plant species. Peat extraction at Bic-Saint-Fabien peatland by the block-cut method began in 1946, converted to vacuum harvesting in the early 1970 ’s and ceased in 2000. After exploitation, about 0. 04 - 1 m of residual minerotrophic sedge peat remained; therefore Bic-Saint-Fabien was restored as a fen. Research occurred in 2008 - 2011 and restoration began fall 2009 so we have two pre-restoration and two post-restoration study years. Rewetting consisted of blocking active drainage ditches, contouring the peat surface into level terraces <b>to</b> <b>even</b> <b>out</b> elevation <b>differences,</b> and building peat ridges (bunds) to retain runoff. Vegetation was introduced to some recontoured parts of the site by the surface layer transfer method. A straw mulch treatment was applied to minimize evapotranspiration. A water budget was created for the harvested cutover area and an adjacent undisturbed section of Bic-Saint- Fabien for all study years. Data collection for the water budget occurred June 2 -August 7 (day of year 153 - 219). Water table, volumetric soil moisture content and soil-water pressure were also examined to better understand the impact of reconfiguration on the hydrology of the system. A 1 - 1. 5 m thick layer of gyttja (a low permeability, high porosity lake-bed sediment) underlies the residual peat; it was parameterized and assessed to see if it could potentially compress and supply water to the overlying peat when the system is stressed. In 2011, the volumetric moisture content and thickness of gyttja were monitored in the field to estimate the strain placed on the gyttja by seasonal water table variability. Gyttja samples were collected and brought back to the laboratory for parameterization and compressibility tests. A water budget was completed annually for the cutover and undisturbed areas of the peatland. There were no distinguishable differences between study years except that 2008 and 2009 were climatologically wetter. During the water budget period surface and groundwater run-on into the cutover area were negligible making precipitation the principle water input. The dominant water loss from the cutover area was evapotranspiration since runoff was only 2 and 9 mm in 2010 and 2011, respectively. Rewetting did not result in a uniform wetness across the cutover site chiefly due to local differences in peat surface elevation. An interior section of Bic- Saint-Fabien remained saturated for nearly all of 2011; it had mean seasonal water table of + 2. 8 cm, and volumetric soil moisture content and soil-water pressure, 5 cm below the peat surface were 86 % and + 4 mbar. At a peripheral section (~ 100 m away) the values were - 14. 4 cm, 67 % and - 13 mbar, respectively. While the interior was generally wetter than the peripheral regions, there were some exceptions, notably near where dams were installed on peripheral drainage ditches. The markedly different spatial patterns of wetness suggests that a uniform prescription regarding vegetation re-establishment in the rewetted section may not be warranted. The bulk density, particle density and porosity of gyttja averaged 0. 12 g cm- 3 1. 57 g cm- 3 and 92 %, in the top 40 cm of the layer. The organic matter content of gyttja decreased with depth from about 70 % at a 5 cm depth to 45 % at a 45 cm depth. Laboratory compression tests showed 9 and 72 % strain at effective stresses of 3. 5 and 200 kPa, respectively, demonstrating the potential for releasing water upon compression, which in the field is caused by water table lowering. From day of year 192 to 202 in 2011, when a ~ 8 cm water level change occurred (effective stress range ~ 0. 8 kPa), the volumetric moisture content and thickness of the top 30 cm of gyttja decreased by 0. 4 %, and 0. 5 cm, respectively, representing 0. 1 and 1. 7 % strain, respectively, as determined from these two different approaches. The compression of gyttja after Bic-Saint-Fabien was rewetted (2011) was small but might have been significant under drier conditions with greater water table variability, such as during the early stages of site drainage when it was being prepared for peat extraction or after peat production ceased. The release of water to the peat layer from the compression of gyttja after peat production finished and before rewetting occurred, might have been an important self-preservation mechanism, eventually making it easier to rewet. Water table drawdown in 2011 produced very small strain rates suggesting gyttja compression in this year had no important role; hence rewetting success was more reliant on other rewetting techniques implemented at this site...|$|R
