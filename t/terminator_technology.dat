40|$|Techniques {{involving}} whole-genome sequencing and whole-population sequencing (metagenomics) {{are beginning}} to revolutionize the study of ecology and evolution. This revolution is furthest advanced in the Bacteria and Archaea, and more sequence data are required for genomic ecology to be fully applied {{to the majority of}} eukaryotes. Recently developed next-generation sequencing technologies provide practical, massively parallel sequencing at lower cost and without the requirement for large, automated facilities, making genome and transcriptome sequencing and resequencing possible for more projects and more species. These sequencing methods include the 454 implementation of pyrosequencing, Solexa/ Illumina reversible <b>terminator</b> <b>technologies,</b> polony sequencing and AB SOLiD. All of these methods use nanotechnology to generate hundreds of thousands of small sequence reads at one time. These technologies have the potential to bring the genomics revolution to whole populations, and to organisms such as endangered species or species of ecological and evolutionary interest. A future is now foreseeable where ecologists may resequence entire genomes from wild populations and perform population genetic studies at a genome, rather than gene, level. The new technologies for high throughput sequencing, their limitations and their applicability to evolutionary and environmental studies, are discussed in this review...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Phyto-remedies for {{diabetic}} {{control are}} popular among patients with Type II Diabetes mellitus (DM), {{in addition to}} other diabetic control measures. A number of plant species are known to possess diabetic control properties. Costus pictus D. Don is popularly known as “Insulin Plant” in Southern India whose leaves have been reported to increase insulin pools in blood plasma. Next Generation Sequencing is employed as a powerful tool for identifying molecular signatures in the transcriptome related to physiological functions of plant tissues. We sequenced the leaf transcriptome of C. pictus using Illumina reversible dye <b>terminator</b> sequencing <b>technology</b> and used combination of bioinformatics tools for identifying transcripts related to anti-diabetic properties of C. pictus. Results A total of 55, 006 transcripts were identified, of which 69. 15 % transcripts could be annotated. We identified transcripts related to pathways of bixin biosynthesis and geraniol and geranial biosynthesis as major transcripts from the class of isoprenoid secondary metabolites and validated the presence of putative norbixin methyltransferase, a precursor of Bixin. The transcripts encoding these terpenoids are known to be Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor (PPAR) agonists and anti-glycation agents. Sequential extraction and High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) confirmed the presence of bixin in C. pictus methanolic extracts. Another significant transcript identified in relation to anti-diabetic, anti-obesity and immuno-modulation is of Abscisic Acid biosynthetic pathway. We also report many other transcripts for the biosynthesis of antitumor, anti-oxidant and antimicrobial metabolites of C. pictus leaves. Conclusion Solid molecular signatures (transcripts related to bixin, abscisic acid, and geranial and geraniol biosynthesis) for the anti-diabetic properties of C. pictus leaves and vital clues related to the other phytochemical functions like antitumor, anti-oxidant, immuno-modulatory, anti-microbial and anti-malarial properties through the secondary metabolite pathway annotations are reported. The data provided will be of immense help to researchers working in the treatment of DM using herbal therapies. </p...|$|R

40|$|DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION This {{invention}} {{concerns a}} laboratory method for genotyping {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (HIV- 1) through gene sequencing of gp 41 -env. It allows to detect the nucleotide mutations conferring resistance to antiretroviral drugs active to gp 41 -env. The present method allows to analyze also low viraemia samples at around 101 - 102 copies HIV-RNA/ml. This method offers {{the advantage of being}} easily adaptable to both plasma and cellular samples and is therefore able to value "in advance" the genetic mutations potentially involved in the resistance phenomena to anti-retroviral drugs, even in patients with optimal/sub-optimal virologic control. The kit use the one-step RT-PCR technology, that offers very short processing times (within 5 hours). Finally, the use of one-step method for reverse transcription and the subsequent amplification of cDNA in dsDNA, limits the intervention and reduces the risk of sample’s contamination. The international guidelines show that a proper use of the resistance genotypic tests could improve the clinical outcomes of HIV-infected patients; more recently, panel of experts in the field have re-evaluated the recommendations on the use of such tests, suggesting a wider application in all clinical phases of the infection. Moreover, it is evident the necessity to have the use of analytic methods that are applicable to all viral variants actually known, with high sensitivity. To date, on the market there are no kits and/or methods available that allow to genotype the gp 41 -env gene of HIV- 1. The object of this invention is a method for genotyping HIV- 1 which includes the following phases: a) 	HIV- 1 RNA reverse transcription from biological samples using a specific anti-sense primer and subsequent PCR amplification of a dsDNA fragment, using a pair of external target-specific primers. The reverse transcription and amplification occur in a single step; b) 	sequencing of the product obtained in the phase a) (using "Big Dye <b>terminator</b> Cycle Sequencing" <b>technology)</b> in independent reactions using a set of primers, whose nucleotide sequences encompass a region located between HIV- 1 env gene and 3 '-LTR, which includes the whole gp 41 -env domain. In particular, the proposed method amplifies a genetic fragment included between the nucleotide positions 7300 and 9500 (referring to the HIV- 1 subtype B sequence, HXB 2 - GenBank Accession number K 03455). c) 	assembling of each segment obtained during phase b) in a consensus sequence. 	Furthermore, according to a form of implementation of the method of the invention, when there is no evident PCR amplification in phase a) by RT-PCR, it is possible to improve the sensitivity with further step of amplification through a nested-PCR, using a pair of internal target-specific primers. Finally, the method can be applied indiscriminately: 	to plasma samples, for the detection of viral RNA circulating variants (expression of viral replication); 	to cellular samples, for the detection of viral cDNA variants integrated at lymphocyte level, even in subjects with effective virologic control (viral load < 47 copies HIV-RNA/mL) ...|$|R

40|$|Indian Biotech {{opponents have}} {{attributed}} {{the increase of}} suicides to the monopolization of GM seeds, centering on patent control, application of <b>terminator</b> <b>technology,</b> marketing strategy, and increased production costs. The contentions of the biotech opponents, however, {{have been criticized for}} a lack of transparency in their modus operandi i. e. the use of methodology in their argumentation. The fact is, however, that with the intention of getting the attention of those capable of determining the future of GM cotton in India, opponents resorted to generating controversies. Therefore, this article will review and evaluate the multifaceted contentions of both opponents and defenders. Although the association between seed monopolization and farmer-suicide is debatable, we will show that there is a link between the economic factors associated with Bt. cultivation and farmer suicide.

40|$|Report of {{the seventh}} meeting of the CGIAR Genetic Resources Policy Committee (GRPC), held in Aleppo, Syria, May 2 - 4, 1998. The report {{includes}} the Committee's comments on {{the report of the}} TAC panels on biotechnology and proprietary science, with particular reference to the proposed Genome Summit and central technical service for the CGIAR. The Committee revised the statement of guiding ethical principles relating to genetic resources, in the light of comments at ICW 97, for presentation for endorsement at MTM 98 (Annex II). It discussed funding and other requirements for both in-situ and ex-situ collections, and encouraged the efforts of ICARDA and the SGRP to develop a database and materials transfer agreement (MTA) for microbial genetic resources. The GRPC recommended a more active role for the CGIAR in relation to underutilized species. It gave continued strong support to the germplasm agreements between the centers and the FAO, and urged centers to harmonize their MTAs. It endorsed a statement outlining steps to be taken in case centers became aware of violations of MTAs, or the FAO-CGIAR agreements (Annex III). CGIAR members were urged to encourage WTO attention to the importance of genetic resources, particularly those designated by the FAO-CGIAR agreements, in its review of the TRIPS agreement. The GRPC expressed pleasure that countries negotiating the revision of the International Undertaking on Plant Genetic Resources seemed to accept the need for a multilateral system of exchange and the sharing of benefits.

40|$|Article first {{published}} online: 13 APR 2007 The difficulties with using nonhuman primate {{species such as}} rhesus macaques and baboons have led us to investigate the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) as an alternative preclinical model for transplantation research. This requires reliable methods of detecting alloreactivity between donor and recipient pairs, particularly if colonies are inbred and share just a few common alleles for leucocyte antigens. We firstly identified marmoset major histocompatibility complex (MHC) Class II DRB genes (Caja-DRB*W 1201, Caja-DRB 1 * 03, Caja-DRB*W 16) using sequence-based typing techniques. Genomic DNA (n= 49) was extracted from whole blood or spleen tissue. Exon 2 of target genes was amplified by PCR using primers specific for known marmoset alleles, and then sequenced using ABI PRISM® Big Dye <b>Terminator</b> <b>technology</b> and Assign sequence analysis software. DRB*W 1201 was universally present. Eight DRB*W 16 alleles and five DRB 1 * 03 alleles were identified in this colony. We also identified two previously unreported DRB*W 16 alleles, and confirmed inheritance of these alleles within several sibling groups. Subsequently, we investigated whether matching at MHC Class II DRB loci alone could predict alloreactivity, as assessed in vitro by two-way mixed lymphocyte reactions (MLRs). Fully DRB-matched, partially mismatched and fully mismatched animal pairs were prospectively chosen. MLR was performed using mononuclear cells (MNC) isolated from whole blood by density gradient separation. T-cell proliferation after 5 -day culture was measured by 3 H-thymidine incorporation. Combined MNC from fully mismatched and partially mismatched animal pairs exhibited significant in vitro T-cell proliferation above single cell controls (P < 0. 01). MNC from fully DRB-matched (but unrelated) animal pairs exhibited no proliferation compared with controls (P= 0. 3). Using DRB genotyping, suitably alloreactive donor–recipient pairs may therefore be rapidly and accurately identified for use in further studies of cellular and solid organ transplantation. S.
