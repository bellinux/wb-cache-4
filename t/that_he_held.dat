5|$|Besides sending Walter on {{diplomatic}} missions, King John gave Walter {{custody of}} Rochester Castle on 20 July 1202, but as Walter was already {{accounting for the}} taxes and fees {{of the city of}} Rochester to the Exchequer in 1200, it is possible <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>held</b> the castle before 1202. John also upheld the right of the archbishop to mint coins, which Walter held until his death in 1205.|$|E
5|$|During the interview, Jordan told The New Yorker and had {{previously}} stated on his Wikipedia user page <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>held</b> doctoral degrees in theology and canon law {{and worked as}} a tenured professor at a private university. It was later discovered that he was 24 years old, and had dropped out of community college with no qualifications. The New Yorker published a correction in February 2007, which brought the issue to broader public attention.|$|E

5|$|For {{two centuries}} after George II's death, history tended to view him with disdain, concentrating on his mistresses, short temper and boorishness.

5|$|After his abdication, he {{was created}} Duke of Windsor. He married Wallis in France on 3 June 1937, after her second divorce became final. Later that year, the couple toured Germany. During the Second World War, {{he was at}} first {{stationed}} with the British Military Mission to France but, after private accusations <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>held</b> Nazi sympathies, he was appointed Governor of the Bahamas. After the war, Edward {{spent the rest of}} his life in retirement in France.|$|E
5|$|After the {{conflict}} Boustead {{served as a}} diplomat in several Middle Eastern countries including Sudan, Yemen, and Oman, prior to spending nine years (1949-1958) as a Resident Adviser in the Aden Protectorate. His next post was the then-Sultanate of Muscat and Oman, where held the position of Development Secretary. He was appointed political agent (then equivalent to ambassador) of Abu Dhabi in 1961, a post <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>held</b> until 1965. He was promoted Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the New Year Honours that year, and presented with the Lawrence of Arabia Memorial Medal of the Royal Society for Asian Affairs.|$|E

5|$|Although Alexander was a {{frequent}} witness to royal charters and documents, {{there is no evidence}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>held</b> an official government position after his appointment as bishop, unlike his relatives Roger and Nigel. Nevertheless, Alexander subsequently appears to have become a regular presence at the royal court. He frequently attested royal charters after 1123, and probably acted as a royal justice in Lincolnshire and the town of Lincoln. He also held the royal castles at Newark, Sleaford and Banbury, and gave confirmations of grants to the church at Godstow.|$|E
5|$|Burchard held a prebend in {{the cathedral}} chapter of York, {{although}} the exact prebend <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>held</b> is unknown. He then held the office of archdeacon for the East Riding, which he held along with the archdeaconry of Durham; all known mentions of his archdeaconry of the East Riding also call him archdeacon of Durham. He acquired the Durham archdeaconry before 24 May 1172, when he first appears holding the office, and held it until his death. Burchard also held a number of churches, including those at Heighington Alne, and Aycliffe. Hugh {{is thought to have}} wanted the archbishopric of York for Burchard, most notably in 1189.|$|E
5|$|Eadbald and Ymme had a daughter, Eanswith (who {{founded the}} very first nunnery on English soil at Folkestone, 15 miles from Canterbury), and two sons, Eorcenberht and Eormenred. Eormenred was the older of the two, and may have held the title of regulus, perhaps {{implying}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>held</b> the junior kingship of Kent. He appears to have died before his father, leaving Eorcenberht to inherit the throne. An additional son, Ecgfrith, is mentioned in a charter of Eadbald's, but the charter is a forgery, probably dating from the eleventh century.|$|E

5|$|In the evening, {{after the}} ceremony, {{the royal family}} decided to leave their palace in Athens for Tatoi, but city {{residents}} opposed the exile of their sovereign and crowds formed outside the palace to prevent Constantine and his family from leaving. On 12 June, the former king and his family escaped undetected from their residence by feigning departure from one gate while exiting through another. At Tatoi, Constantine again impressed upon Alexander <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>held</b> the crown in trust only. It {{was the last time}} that Alexander would be in direct contact with his family. The next day, Constantine, Sophia and all of their children except Alexander arrived at the small port of Oropos and set off into exile.|$|E
5|$|John de Vere was {{the only}} son of Alphonse de Vere, and Jane, {{daughter}} of Sir Richard Foliot. Alphonse was a younger son of Robert de Vere, 5th Earl of Oxford and apparently died shortly before 20 December 1328, when a writ was issued for inquisitions post mortem into the land <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>held</b> direct from the King. These hearings established that Alphonse's next heir was his son John, then aged 15 years and more. The manors concerned were Aston Sandford, Buckinghamshire, Westwick by St Albans and Great Hormead, Hertfordshire, as well as property at Beaumont and Althorne in Essex.|$|E
5|$|Lowell did {{not know}} what {{vocation}} to choose after graduating, and he vacillated among business, the ministry, medicine, and law. He ultimately enrolled at Harvard Law School in 1840 and was admitted to the bar two years later. While studying law, however, he contributed poems and prose articles to various magazines. During this time, he was admittedly depressed and often had suicidal thoughts. He once confided to a friend <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>held</b> a cocked pistol to his forehead and considered killing himself at the age of 20.|$|E

5|$|Philip {{was born}} in a village in Auranitis, part of the {{district}} of Trachonitis, east of the Sea of Galilee in Palestine. Philip renamed the village Philippopolis (the modern al-Shahbā', Syria) during his reign as emperor. He was one of only three Easterners to be made emperor before the decisive separation of East and West in 395. (The other two were Elagabalus and Alexander Severus). Even among Easterners Philip was atypical, as he was an Arab, not a Greek. His father was Julius Marinus; nothing besides his name is known, but the name indicates <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>held</b> Roman citizenship and that he must have been prominent in his community.|$|E
5|$|Ælfric {{was the son}} of an earl of Kent {{and became}} a monk of Abingdon Abbey in Berkshire (now Oxfordshire). He was very likely Abbot of Abingdon before {{becoming}} Abbot of St Albans Abbey around 975, although some historians do not believe <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>held</b> the office of Abbot at Abingdon. Although the Historia Ecclesie Abbendonensis, or History of the Church of Abingdon, names Ælfric as abbot, the abbatial lists do not record him as such. Indirect corroboration of his being abbot at Abingdon is a grant of land to Ælfric personally (instead of to the office he held) while he was archbishop that had previously been unjustly taken from Abingdon. This land was to revert to Abingdon after Ælfric's death.|$|E
5|$|At Stockholm, Brundage {{finished}} {{sixth in}} the pentathlon and 16th in the decathlon. Far behind on points, after eight events {{he dropped out of}} the decathlon, which he always regretted. He later moved up one spot in the standings in each event when his fellow American, Jim Thorpe, who had won both events, was disqualified after it was shown that he had played baseball for money: this meant Thorpe was considered a professional, not an amateur as was required for Olympic participation. Throughout his tenure as president, Brundage refused to ask the IOC to restore Thorpe's medals despite advocacy by Thorpe supporters. The committee eventually did so in 1982, after the deaths of both men. Brundage's refusal led to charges <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>held</b> a grudge for being beaten in Stockholm.|$|E

5|$|At the convention, held August 5–8, Agnew {{abandoned}} his favorite son status, placing Nixon's name in nomination. Nixon narrowly secured the nomination {{on the first}} ballot. In the discussions that followed about a running mate, Nixon kept his counsel while various party factions thought they could influence his choice: Strom Thurmond, the senator from South Carolina, told a party meeting <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>held</b> a veto on the vice presidency. It was evident that Nixon wanted a centrist, though there was little enthusiasm when he first proposed Agnew, and other possibilities were discussed. Some party insiders thought that Nixon had privately settled on Agnew early on, and that the consideration of other candidates {{was little more than}} a charade. On August 8, after a final meeting of advisers and party leaders, Nixon declared that Agnew was his choice, and shortly afterwards announced his decision to the press. Delegates formally nominated Agnew for the vice presidency later that day, before adjourning.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War {{he joined}} the Royal Air Force and served in Egypt, where he acquainted himself with the archaeological remains of Ancient Egyptian society; after the war he {{published}} {{a book on the}} Egyptian pyramids. On his return to Britain, Grinsell became the treasurer of the Prehistoric Society, a position <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>held</b> from 1947 till 1970. Moving to Devizes, in 1949 he entered the archaeological profession as an assistant to Christopher Hawkes and Stuart Piggott at the Victoria County History project. From 1952 to 1972, Grinsell worked as Keeper of Anthropology and Archaeology at Bristol City Museum, during which time he continued his examination of barrows, focusing on those in south-west England. On retirement, he was appointed to the Order of the British Empire and a festschrift was published in his honour.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the bishops}} in England {{did not want to}} be consecrated by Stigand. Both Giso of Wells and Walter of Hereford {{travelled}} to Rome to be consecrated by the pope in 1061, rather than be consecrated by Stigand. During the brief period <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>held</b> a legitimate pallium, however, Stigand did consecrate Aethelric of Selsey and Siward of Rochester. Abbots of monasteries, however, came to Stigand for consecration throughout his time as archbishop. These included not only abbots from monastic houses inside his province, such as Æthelsige as abbot of St Augustine's Abbey in Canterbury, but also Baldwin as Abbot of Bury St. Edmunds and Thurstan as Abbot of Ely. After the Norman Conquest, Stigand was accused of selling the office of abbot, but no abbot was deposed for buying the office, so the charge is suspect.|$|E
