30|$|The {{penetration}} depth was quantified in MATLAB (MathWorks Inc., USA), whereas both binary images (glue and bottom line) {{as well as}} the thickness measurements of veneers were imported. The resolution of the images (4.147  µm/pixel) was set as variable for the subsequent calculations. The bottom line was then smoothed to remove artefacts from the thresholding, using a moving average with a window length of 70 pixels. In preliminary tests, this window length was found to represent the given bottom lines most precisely. Afterwards the Euclidean distance was calculated from each single adhesive pixel to all pixels of the bottom line. The shortest Euclidean distance was selected and the veneer thickness was subtracted. This value was considered to be the {{penetration depth}} of single adhesive pixels in relation <b>to</b> the <b>glued</b> <b>wood</b> surface.|$|R

This pressure indirectly is caused by furniture joints failure due <b>to</b> poor <b>gluing</b> technology based on improper use of different <b>glues</b> <b>to</b> different <b>wood</b> species which lead to low quality and weak wood-glue joints. This study was carried in order to run performance tests of <b>wood</b> <b>glues</b> on different <b>wood</b> species used in wood workshops: Morogoro Tanzania whereby three popular wood species of C. lusitanica, T. glandis and E. maidenii were tested against five glues of Woodfix, Bullbond, Ponal, Fevicol and Coral found in the market. The findings were necessary on developing a guideline for proper glue selection for a particular wood species joining. Random sampling was employed to interview carpenters while conducting a survey on the background of carpenters like their education level and to determine factors that influence their glues choice. Monsanto Tensiometer {{was used to determine}} bonding strength of identified <b>wood</b> <b>glues</b> <b>to</b> different <b>wood</b> species in use under British Standard of testing wood shear strength (BS EN 205) procedures. Data obtained from interviewing carpenters were analyzed through Statistical Package of Social Science software (SPSS) to allow the comparison of different data while laboratory data were compiled, related and compared by the use of MS Excel worksheet software as well as Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). Results revealed that among all five <b>wood</b> <b>glues</b> tested in the laboratory to three different wood species, Coral performed much better with the average shear strength 4. 18 N/mm 2, 3. 23 N/mm 2 and 5. 42 N/mm 2 for Cypress, Teak and Eucalyptus respectively. This displays that for a strong joint to be formed to all tree wood species for soft wood and hard wood, Coral has a first priority in use. The developed table of guideline from this research can be useful to carpenters on proper <b>glue</b> selection <b>to</b> a particular wood species so as to meet glue-bond strength. This will secure furniture market as well as reduce pressure to the forests for furniture production because of the strong existing furniture due to their strong joints. Indeed, this can be a good strategy on reducing climate change speed in tropics which result from high deforestation of trees for furniture production...|$|R

Intarsia is created through the selection of different types of wood, using their natural grain pattern and color (but can involve the use of stains and dyes) to create variations in the pattern. After selecting the specific woods to be used within the pattern, each piece is then individually cut, shaped, and finished. Sometimes areas of the pattern are raised to create more depth. Once the individual pieces are complete, they are fitted together like a jig-saw puzzle and <b>glued</b> <b>to</b> <b>wood</b> backing which is sometimes cut to the outline shape of the image, often with the intention of creating a three-dimensional effect as seen in the studiolo of the Palazzo Ducale, Urbino.|$|R

Plywoods were manufactured using urea melamine formaldehyde resin mixed with ammonium pentaborate or dihydrogen phosphate. Treated plywoods had better incombustibility than untreated ones. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis clearly demonstrated {{the distribution of}} boron and phosphorus, which had migrated from the <b>glue</b> <b>to</b> the <b>wood,</b> contributing to better fire retardant properties. The cross-sectional micrographs from scanning electron microscopy showed that untreated specimens exhibited a foamy structure near the interface in the glue layer and the deformed structure of wood cells. The cell structure and cell wall thickness retained intact in the specimens treated with urea melamine formaldehyde resin mixed with ammonium pentaborate or dihydrogen phosphate. When observing {{the effect of the}} thickness of overlay veneers on incombustibility, a shorter glowing time was obtained from the specimens with a thicker surface layer when the fire retardant chemical was added at 2 %, but the differences were smaller at the higher chemical retention of 4 %. A similar tendency was observed for the char length.|$|R

40|$|Palm Kernel Meal (PKM) is a {{byproduct}} of palm kernel oil industry. In the last few years, Malaysia produced over two million tons of PKM annually and the byproduct is available throughout the year. Palm kernel meal contains biomaterials such as protein, cellulose and organic acids. Generally, palm kernel meal contains about 20 % protein. Palm kernel protein can be extracted and purified and used as animal feed supplement or as raw material for other processes. However, with the current trend of green processes and products, palm kernel protein can be utilized {{for the production of}} formaldehyde- free <b>wood</b> <b>glue.</b> Palm kernel protein based <b>wood</b> <b>glue</b> is non-toxic as compared <b>to</b> conventional <b>wood</b> <b>glue</b> which is based on melamine-urea-formaldehyde resin.

The extraction of palm kernel protein was conducted using saline and alkali treatment method. For saline treatment, the extraction of protein was done under various conditions such as variation of solvent to palm kernel meal ratio, pH and salt concentration. For alkaline treatment, variation of solvent to palm kernel ratio, extraction time and extraction temperature was applied. Central composite designs of response surface methodology were used for identification of the best condition and extraction yield optimization. Result shows that over 80 % of palm kernel protein can be extracted. Alkaline treatment produces better extraction yield compared to saline treatment...|$|R
