40|$|Abstract. The paper {{presents}} the method <b>of</b> determining <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> timing diagram of automatic machine. The timing diagram of automatic machine {{is represented in}} a vector form with preservation of the visibility of a linear timing diagram. To determine <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> actuation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mechanisms is used the method of calculating of dimensional chains. The method allows taking into account <b>the</b> <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> operation of mechanisms of automatic machine at design of the timing diagrams...|$|R
40|$|The {{regression}} model was traditionally established {{by using the}} least squares (LS) method where <b>the</b> <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> independent variables were ignored. Although the weighted total least squares (TLS) method that captures <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> both dependent and independent variables was extensively studied for regression analysis in recent years, it still neglects <b>the</b> <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> independent variables when predicting the corresponding dependent variables. This paper puts forward a seamless linear regression and prediction model which estimates regression parameters and predicts dependent variables simultaneously by considering <b>the</b> <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> all variables. In the seamless model, <b>the</b> <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> independent variables in the prediction model are predicted and corrected to improve the prediction accuracy. The several existing {{regression model}}s are theoretically {{proved to be the}} special cases of the proposed seamless model. The experimental results show that the proposed seamless model outperforms the other existing models in the sense of prediction accuracy, especially when <b>the</b> <b>error</b> correlation <b>of</b> variables is significant...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} to develop <b>the</b> {{position}} <b>error</b> equations including <b>the</b> attitude <b>errors,</b> <b>the</b> <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> nadir and ship’s heading, and <b>the</b> <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> ship’s position in the free-gyro positioning and directional system. In doing so, the determination of ship’s position by two free gyro vectors was discussed and the algorithmic design of the free-gyro positioning and directional system was introduced briefly. Next, <b>the</b> <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> transformation matrices of the gyro and body frames, i. e., attitude errors, were examined and the attitude equations were also derived. <b>The</b> perturbations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nadir angle including ship’s heading were investigated in each stage from the sensor of rate of motion of the spin axis to the nadir angle obtained. Finally, <b>the</b> perturbation <b>error</b> equations <b>of</b> ship’s position used the nadir angles were derived in the form <b>of</b> a linear <b>error</b> model and <b>the</b> concept of FDOP was also suggested by using covariance <b>of</b> position <b>error...</b>|$|R

Kovalainen was issued with an reprimand for his role in the collision with de la Rosa. He admitted that he was at fault for causing the incident because he was allowing another car to pass him and had not seen de la Rosa approaching him. Force India's chief operating officer Otmar Szafnauer said the confusion resulting in <b>the</b> <b>error</b> <b>of</b> fitting the wrong tyres for both their drivers was an example of cause and effect.

40|$|The {{machining}} precision {{plays an}} important role in the operation reliability and service life of screw rotors. However, the actual machined rotor profile of screw rotors is different from its theoretical profile due to <b>the</b> <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> machine tool. This paper proposes a novel method <b>of</b> <b>error</b> tracing and compensation to reduce <b>the</b> machined <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> rotor profile on the basis of the limited sample trials, and the method is based on a matrix <b>of</b> <b>error</b> compensation. <b>The</b> <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> rotor profile are obtained based on limited sample trials machining of screw rotors,and fitted into piecewise smooth data. A matrix <b>of</b> <b>error</b> compensation is established to compute <b>the</b> <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> rotor profile to generate a compensated rotor profile. The compensated rotor profile is then used to regenerate forming tool and a new rotor product is processed on the same machine tool. And <b>the</b> <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> new rotor profile are smaller and can be reduced within (− 0. 01 [*]mm, 0. 01 [*]mm) after compensations. Finally, the actual machining examples illustrate that <b>the</b> method <b>of</b> <b>error</b> compensation can not only satisfy the machining requirement of high-precision rotors, but also has the characteristics of good stability and applicability...|$|R

During his lunch break at work, Homer has a {{conversation}} with Lenny and Carl. He tells them that he let Lisa ride the bus alone. Lenny and Carl point out <b>the</b> <b>error</b> <b>of</b> his judgment, and Homer leaves work to go look for her. He heads to the museum and ends up in downtown Springfield. He uses a cherrypicker to get up higher. Homer and Lisa spot each other, but the vehicle's wheels creak backwards and it rolls down a hill. It slides off the edge of a pier at the harbor into a river. Lisa tells the drawbridge operator to close the bridge so Homer can grab on. His head is caught between the two closing halves and he survives with nothing more than a few tire marks across his forehead.|$|E

5|$|Scyllarides latus was {{originally}} {{classified in the}} genus Scyllarus, along with the four other slipper lobsters known at the time (Scyllarus arctus, Scyllarides aequinoctialis, Thenus orientalis and Arctides guineensis). Separate genera were first introduced by William Elford Leach in 1815, namely Thenus and Ibacus. In 1849, Wilhem de Haan divided the genus Scyllarus into two genera, Scyllarus and Arctus, but made <b>the</b> <b>error</b> <b>of</b> including the type species of Scyllarus in the genus Arctus. This was first recognised by the ichthyologist Theodore Gill in 1898, who synonymised Arctus with Scyllarus, and erected a new genus Scyllarides to hold the species that De Haan had placed in Scyllarus. Scyllarides {{is placed in the}} subfamily Arctidinae, which is differentiated from other subfamilies by the presence of multiarticulated exopods on all three maxillipeds, and a three-segmented palp on the mandible. The only other genus in the subfamily, Arctides, is distinguished by having a more highly sculptured carapace, with an extra spine behind each eye, and a transverse groove on the first segment of the abdomen.|$|E

5|$|Wesley, aware the Enterprise is in orbit, {{arranges}} for {{the children}} to passively resist. When the Aldeans request Picard's help to resolve the issue with the children, the crew finds a way to beam through the shield, allowing Commander Riker and Lt. Commander Data (Brent Spiner) to sneak onto the planet. Data manages to disable the Custodian, disrupting the Aldean's transporter and planetary shield. Dr. Crusher explains to the Aldeans that their shield has weakened the ozone layer of their planet, exposing the inhabitants to ultraviolet radiation that has left them unable to bear children. The radiation would likely have the same effects on the children from the Enterprise. Without the planetary shield, the ozone layer will naturally return, allowing the Aldeans to reproduce again. The Aldeans recognize <b>the</b> <b>error</b> <b>of</b> their ways and return the children to the Enterprise.

25|$|To {{assess how}} {{severely}} the dimensionality of a data set affects the analysis {{within the context}} of ABC, analytical formulas have been derived for <b>the</b> <b>error</b> <b>of</b> the ABC estimators as functions of the dimension of the summary statistics.

It was also argued that dimension reduction techniques are useful to avoid the curse-of-dimensionality, due to a potentially lower-dimensional underlying structure of summary statistics. Motivated by minimizing the quadratic loss of ABC estimators, Fearnhead and Prangle have proposed a scheme to project (possibly high-dimensional) data into estimates of the parameter posterior means; these means, now having the same dimension as the parameters, are then used as summary statistics for ABC.|$|E
