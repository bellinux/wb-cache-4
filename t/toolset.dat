5|$|During the 2015 Build keynote, Microsoft {{announced}} a Universal Windows Platform bridge {{that would allow}} Android and iOS software to be ported to Windows 10 Mobile and published to the Windows Store. In August 2015, A version of the Microsoft Android bridge <b>toolset</b> {{was reported to be}} leaked and available on the internet along with its documentation. The leaked <b>toolset</b> required developers to register and use the WNS to send notification data to ported applications, and would not allow for Google Cloud Messaging to be used instead. Microsoft later discontinued the Android bridge project in favor of continuing support for iOS application porting instead.|$|E

5|$|BioWare {{provided}} its Aurora Engine from Neverwinter Nights for the sequel. One of {{the decisions}} to use Aurora rather than build a new engine from scratch was the toolset—Obsidian wanted players {{to continue to be}} able to make content for the game, which may not have been possible with a new engine. BioWare made itself available to Obsidian with technical support on the engine, but Obsidian planned on completely overhauling Aurora, including its code. The designers wanted to improve the visuals of the first game with additions such as better lighting and textures, which required significant changes to the engine. The upgraded engine was referred to as Electron. Electron was designed to incorporate DirectX to make it compatible for a potential Xbox 360 release, but Obsidian eventually abandoned plans for a port to the system for financial reasons. The <b>toolset</b> that was used to create the game was also revamped, and included several additions like a customizable interface, a new dialogue format, and building assistants—similar to the wizards found in Microsoft Word and Excel. Like Neverwinter Nights, the <b>toolset</b> was included in the game's release for players to use.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Open <b>toolsets</b> {{are a new}} {{genre of}} {{software}} that involves {{a greater number of}} smaller units than conventional educational “applications. ” The units are intended to be highly modifiable, extendable, and combinable with each other. Primarily with examples created in the computational medium, Boxer, I illustrate open <b>toolsets.</b> I suggest how they can be constructed and what learning properties they may have. In particular, I argue that open <b>toolsets</b> may allow very different development communities, involving teachers in essential ways. Finally, I outline areas of research that need to be done to support the best development and use of open <b>toolsets...</b>|$|R

5|$|The in-game {{characters}} {{are taken from}} the Wii's Mii Channel, which allows the user to create a Mii (a customized avatar) that can be imported into games that support the feature. Wii Sports is the first Wii title to use this feature. Miis saved on the Wii {{will appear in the}} crowd during bowling games and as members of human-controlled teams in baseball. The non-player characters in the game were also created using the Mii Channel <b>toolset.</b> Miis created on one Wii can be transferred onto the internal memory of a Wii Remote for use on another Wii with different save data.|$|E
5|$|Developed {{in tandem}} with the single-player mode, the online {{multiplayer}} mode Grand Theft Auto Online was conceived as a separate experience to be played in a continually evolving world. Up to 30 players freely roam across the game world and enter lobbies to complete jobs (story-driven competitive and cooperative modes). The Content Creator <b>toolset</b> lets players create their own parameters for custom jobs, like racetracks and deathmatch weapon spawn points. Players may band together in organised player teams called crews to complete jobs together. Rockstar Games Social Club extends crews formed in Max Payne 3 multiplayer mode to those of Grand Theft Auto Online. Players may create their own crews and join up to five total. Crews win multiplayer matches to earn experience points and climb online leaderboards.|$|E
5|$|Neverwinter Nights 2 {{went into}} {{development}} in July 2004. This sequel was designed with the Aurora Engine, also used by its predecessor, and the game's <b>toolset</b> {{was included in}} the game's release for players to use in designing their own adventures. The game's design team drew upon older role-playing video games, and decided that the player character would have to earn the respect of others by the things the character does. The game was also designed to be playable with other players online in a cooperative fashion. The game was released in October and November 2006. Official multiplayer support for the game was suspended in December 2012. In response, the Neverwinter Nights 2 community developed several initiatives by which players can continue to play the game online.|$|E
50|$|The new ROM {{firmware}} {{then took}} 256 KB and contained the System 5.x <b>toolsets.</b> The newer <b>toolsets</b> increased {{the performance of}} the machine by up to 10%, {{due to the fact that}} less had to be loaded from disk, tool ROM read access being faster than RAM, and their highly optimized routines compared to the older <b>toolsets</b> (pre-GS/OS-based). In addition to several bug fixes, more programmer assistance commands and features, a cleaned-up control panel with improved mouse control, RAM Disk functionality, more flexible Appletalk support and slot-mapping were added.|$|R

5|$|BioWare {{produced}} Neverwinter Nights (2002) for Atari, {{the first}} CRPG to fuse the third-edition Dungeons & Dragons rules with a 3D display {{in which the}} user could vary the viewing angle and distance. New game content could be generated using the Aurora <b>toolset</b> supplied {{as part of the}} game release, and players could share their modules and play cooperatively with friends online. Based in part on experiences while playing Ultima Online, one of the goals during development was to reproduce the feel of a live pen-and-paper RPG experience, complete with a human Dungeon Master. Neverwinter Nights (NWN) was very successful commercially, and spawned three official expansion packs and a sequel developed by Obsidian Entertainment. BioWare later produced the acclaimed , which married the d20 system with the Star Wars franchise; as well as the original Jade Empire (2005), Mass Effect (20072012) and Dragon Age (20092014) series, all which were released for multiple platforms. With the Mass Effect and the Dragon Age titles, Bioware also utilized a save import system where decisions in the earlier games impact the story in the later games.|$|E

500|$|The {{team made}} use of Havok's Behavior <b>toolset</b> for {{character}} animation, which allows for a greater fluidity between the character's movements of walking, running and sprinting, and also increases {{the efficiency of the}} third-person camera option, which had been criticized in Oblivion. The <b>toolset</b> allows interactions between the player and NPCs to take place in real-time; in Oblivion, when the player went to interact with an NPC, time would freeze and the camera would zoom in on the NPC's face. In Skyrim, NPCs can move around and make body gestures while conversing with the player. Children are present in the game, and their presence is handled similarly to Fallout 3 in that they cannot be harmed by the player in any way, since depictions of violence involving children in video games is considered controversial. Skyrim makes use of the Radiant AI artificial intelligence system that was created for Oblivion, and it has been updated to allow NPCs to [...] "do what they want under extra parameters". The updated system allows for greater interaction between NPCs and their environments; NPCs can perform tasks such as farming, milling, and mining in the game world, and will react to each other.|$|E

BPA providers tend to focus on different industry sectors but their underlying approach tends to be similar in that they will attempt to provide the shortest route to automation by exploiting the user interface layer rather than going deeply into the application code or databases sitting behind them. They also simplify their own interface to the extent that these tools can be used directly by non-technically qualified staff.

500|$|The map's first {{prototype}} {{was inspired}} by the map seen in the Indiana Jones films. [...] It behaved similarly to normal gameplay, and Obsidian decided to revamp it to create a [...] "more dynamic and reactive interstitial space". [...] Characters would be able to avoid monsters by having a high enough Survival skill and could find hidden items and locations with high Search skills. [...] Groups of adventuring NPCs could be observed and interacted with by players, including helping them fight aggressive monsters. [...] Trade caravans created within the game's economic subplot are visible and the player can actively protect their own investments. [...] The overland map feature was created with the modding community in mind, and players using the Neverwinter Nights 2 <b>toolset</b> can modify the map's options on an individual basis.|$|E

[...] Over two dozen monsters were created for Mask of the Betrayer, such as new types of golem, dragons, and hagspawn. [...] New spell effects, character models, and environmental effects were also added; Saunders stated that the genasi models in particular had been a challenge for artists and he had originally opposed the inclusion of the new races because of this.|$|E
