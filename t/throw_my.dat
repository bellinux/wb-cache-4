[...] IGN's Hilary Goldstein disagreed, writing that although EA [...] "is {{one of the worst}} offenders when it comes to porting games to the PS3," [...] the frame rate issues were not bad enough [...] "to make me <b>throw</b> <b>my</b> controller in disgust." ...|$|E

500|$|Santiago and Thompson {{shared a}} room {{at the start of the}} second semester. Santiago soon {{introduced}} his new roommate to 1970s punk and the music of David Bowie. He later recalled their time together in college: [...] "Charles and I had a suite at the college dorm. We'd go to shows, I remember seeing Black Flag and Angst. Initially, I think we just liked each other. I did notice right away that he was playing music... He'd write 'em , and I'd <b>throw</b> <b>my</b> ideas on the guitar." [...] In their second year of college, Thompson traveled to Puerto Rico as an exchange student. After six months there living with a [...] "weird, psycho roommate," [...] Thompson sent Santiago a letter with the words [...] "We gotta do it, now is the time, Joe, we gotta chase our dreams"; Santiago replied, saying [...] "Yes, now's the time."

500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Team" [...] is a [...] "tribute to {{her friends}} and country".

[...] Lorde explained that the line [...] "We live in cities you'll never see on screen" [...] was [...] "to be speaking for the minority" [...] from small cities. She also expresses distaste in common contemporary popular music lyrics telling listeners to [...] "put your hands in the air" [...] through the verse [...] "I'm kind of over getting told to <b>throw</b> <b>my</b> hands up in the air". Writer Lily Rothman for the magazine Time commented that the lyrics [...] "we sure know how to run things" [...] in [...] "Team" [...] were a response to the lyrics [...] "we run things, things don’t run we" [...] in Miley Cyrus' [...] "We Can't Stop" [...] (2013).|$|E
500|$|McClellan's {{antipathy}} to emancipation {{added to}} the pressure on him, as he received bitter criticism from Radical Republicans in the government. He viewed slavery as an institution recognized in the Constitution, and entitled to federal protection wherever it existed (Lincoln held the same public position until August 1862). McClellan's writings after the war were typical of many Northerners: [...] "I confess to a prejudice in favor of my own race, & can't learn to like the odor of either Billy goats or niggers." [...] But in November 1861, {{he wrote to his}} wife, [...] "I will, if successful, <b>throw</b> <b>my</b> sword onto the scale to force an improvement in the condition of those poor blacks." [...] He later wrote that had it been his place to arrange the terms of peace, he would have insisted on gradual emancipation, guarding the rights of both slaves and masters, as part of any settlement. But he made no secret of his opposition to the radical Republicans. He told Ellen, [...] "I will not fight for the abolitionists." [...] This put him in opposition with officials of the administration who believed he was attempting to implement the policies of the opposition party.|$|E

500|$|In {{contrast}} to Hergé's involvement in Belgium's right-wing, Sterckx thought the cartoonist {{to have been}} [...] "a liberal and independent spirit", someone who was [...] "the very opposite of a conservative [...] a reactionary of the right". Michael Farr asserted that Hergé had [...] "an acute political conscience" [...] during his earlier days, as exemplified by his condemnation of racism in the United States evident in Tintin in America. Literary critic Tom McCarthy went further, remarking that Tintin in America represented {{the emergence of a}} [...] "left-wing counter tendency" [...] in Hergé's work that rebelled against his right-wing milieu and which was particularly critical of wealthy capitalists and industrialists. This was furthered in The Blue Lotus, in which Hergé rejected his [...] "classically right-wing" [...] ideas to embrace an anti-imperialist stance, and in a contemporary Quick & Flupke strip in which he lampooned the far right leaders of Germany and Italy, Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini. Although many of his friends and colleagues did so in the mid-1930s, Hergé did not join the far-right Rexist Party, later asserting that he [...] "had always had an aversion to it" [...] and commenting that [...] "to <b>throw</b> <b>my</b> heart and soul into an ideology is the opposite of who I am." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Tarantino, {{the most}} {{difficult}} part of making the film was [...] "trying to take myself to a different place as a filmmaker and <b>throw</b> <b>my</b> hat in the ring with other great action directors", as opposed to the dialogue scenes he was known for. The House of Blue Leaves sequence, in which the Bride battles dozens of yakuza soldiers, took eight weeks to film, six weeks over schedule. Tarantino wanted to create [...] "one of the greatest, most exciting sequences in the history of cinema". The crew eschewed computer generated imagery in favor of traditional practical effects used in 1970s Chinese cinema, particularly by director Chang Cheh, including the use of fire extinguishers and condoms to create spurts and explosions of blood. Tarantino told his crew: [...] "Let's pretend we're little kids and we're making a Super 8 movie in our back yard, and you don't have all this shit. How would you achieve this effect? Ingenuity is important here!" ...|$|E

2500|$|In the post-fight interview, an {{emotional}} Fury said, [...] "This {{is a dream}} come true. We worked so hard for this. I've done it. It's hard to come to foreign countries ‎and get decisions. It just means {{so much to me}} to come here and get the decision." [...] He then took the microphone to thank Klitschko, [...] "I'd like to say to Wladimir, you're a great champion. And thanks very much for having me. It was all fun and games during the buildup." [...] Klitschko failed to throw his well-known right hand, mostly due to Fury's constant movement and mocking. He said, [...] "Tyson was the faster and better man tonight. I felt quite comfortable in the first six rounds, but I was astonished that Tyson was so fast in the second half as well. I couldn't <b>throw</b> <b>my</b> right hand because the advantage was the longer distance he had." [...] Klitschko had a rematch clause in place.|$|E
2500|$|The band {{finished}} its tour in December 1997 and {{had several}} releases during the two-year writing process {{to make its}} follow-up to Tragic Kingdom.

The band recorded [...] "I <b>Throw</b> <b>My</b> Toys Around" [...] with Elvis Costello for The Rugrats Movie, and it contributed to The Clash's tribute album [...] Stefani began to make recordings without the band, contributing vocals to tracks for The Brian Setzer Orchestra, Prince, Fishbone & Familyhood Nextperience, and her boyfriend Gavin Rossdale's band Bush. After some time in-between albums, No Doubt included its song [...] "New" [...] on the soundtrack to the movie Go in 1999.
