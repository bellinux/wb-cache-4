5|$|By 1943, 40% of the NFL rosters {{had been}} {{drafted into the}} United States Armed Forces for World War II. The {{resulting}} difficulty in fielding a full-strength squad led some owners to recommend the league should shut down until the war ended. Bell auspiciously argued against this as he feared {{they might not be}} able to resume operations easily after the war, and since Major League Baseball was continuing unabated, <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> also.|$|E
5|$|One {{possible}} {{interpretation of}} these provisions is that unlawful non-citizens {{should be kept}} in detention for as long as necessary to remove them, and that if removing them never became practicable, that they would be detained until death. In contrast, Al-Kateb argued that the provisions only allowed unlawful non-citizens to be detained while removal was a practical possibility, and that if removal was not a practical possibility, <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> be released from detention, at least while it remained impractical.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{high-ranking}} US Navy officials {{elected to}} contract a private salvage firm {{to free the}} battleship, but Admiral Smith, at the time Commander, Cruisers, Atlantic, {{and the man who}} was responsible for issuing Missouris orders disagreed with this plan. He reasoned that if the Navy got her on to the shoal, <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> be responsible for getting her off the shoal. Ultimately, he won his case for a US Navy salvage effort, but he was explicitly informed by officials at The Pentagon that his career would ride on his ability to successfully get Missouri back into deep water. To better organize the salvage effort, Smith and a number of men on his staff moved aboard Missouri to supervise her return to deep water. Smith's supervision also extended to answering the nearly 10,000 letters sent to the Navy from concerned citizens offering advice on how to get the battleship back into deep water.|$|E

25|$|Therefore, to {{evaluate}} the real worthiness of an amount of money today after a given period of time, economic agents compound {{the amount of money}} at a given interest rate. Most actuarial calculations use the risk-free interest rate which corresponds the minimum guaranteed rate provided the bank's saving account, for example. If one wants to compare their change in purchasing power, <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> use the real interest rate (nominal interest rate minus inflation rate).|$|E
25|$|In {{considering}} {{the issue of}} possible reunification of some sex offenders into homes with a non-offending parent and children, it has been advised that any sex offender with a significant criminal history should be assessed on the PCL-R, and if they score 18 or higher, <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> be excluded from any consideration of being placed in a home with children under any circumstances. There is, however, increasing concern that PCL scores are too inconsistent between different examiners, including in its use to evaluate sex offenders.|$|E

25|$|The {{kinematic}} {{connection between}} spiral and lenticular galaxies is most clear when analyzing the Tully–Fisher relation for spiral and lenticular samples. If lenticular galaxies are an evolved stage of spiral galaxies <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> {{have a similar}} Tully–Fisher relation with spirals, but with an offset in the luminosity / absolute magnitude axis. This would result from brighter, redder stars dominating the stellar populations of lenticulars. An example of this effect {{can be seen in}} the adjacent plot. One can clearly see that the best-fit lines for the spiral galaxy data and the lenticular galaxy have the same slope (and thus follow the same Tully–Fisher relation), but are offset by ΔI ≈ 1.5. This implies that lenticular galaxies were once spiral galaxies but are now dominated by old, red stars.|$|E
25|$|After the Compromise of 1850 allowed California {{into the}} Union {{as a free}} state while {{permitting}} Utah and New Mexico territories the option of deciding the issue by popular sovereignty, the Utah Territorial Legislature took {{up the issue of}} legalizing slavery. At that time, Brigham Young was governor, and the Utah Territorial Legislature was dominated by church leaders. In 1852, Brigham Young addressed the joint session of the legislature advocating slavery. He made the matter religious by declaring that if members of the church believe in the Bible and the priesthood <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> also believe in slavery. Following the speech, the Utah Legislature passed an Act in Relation to Service, which officially sanctioned slavery in Utah Territory. The Utah slavery law stipulated that slaves would be freed if their masters had sexual relations with them; attempted to take them from the territory against their will; or neglected to feed, clothe, or provide shelter to them. In addition, the law stipulated that slaves must receive schooling.|$|E
25|$|The {{most direct}} evidence, {{according}} to Kahneman, is a 1973 experiment that used a psychological profile of TomW., a fictional graduate student. One group of subjects had to rate Tom's similarity to a typical student {{in each of}} nine academic areas (Law, Engineering, Library Science etc.). Another group had to rate how {{likely it is that}} Tom specialised in each area. If these ratings of likelihood are governed by probability, <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> resemble the base rates, i.e., the proportion of students in each of the nine areas (which had been separately estimated by a third group). A probabilistic judgment would say that Tom {{is more likely to be}} a Humanities student than Library Science, because many more students study Humanities, and the additional information in the profile is vague and unreliable. Instead, the ratings of likelihood matched the ratings of similarity almost perfectly, both in this study and a similar one where subjects judged the likelihood of a fictional woman taking different careers. This suggests that rather than estimating probability using base rates, subjects had substituted the more accessible attribute of similarity.|$|E

25|$|It is very {{uncommon}} for patients not {{to respond to}} TB treatment at all (even transiently), because this implies resistance at base-line {{to all of the}} drugs in the regimen. Patients who fail to get any response at all while on treatment should first of all be questioned very closely about whether or not they have been taking their medicines, and perhaps even be admitted to hospital to be observed taking their treatment. Blood or urine samples may be taken to check for malabsorption of TB drugs. If it can be shown that they are fully compliant with their medication, then the probability that they have another diagnosis (perhaps in addition to the diagnosis of TB) is very high. These patients should have their diagnosis carefully reviewed and specimens obtained for TB culture and sensitivity testing. Patients who get better and then get worse again should likewise be question very closely about adherence to treatment. If adherence is confirmed <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> be investigated for resistant TB (including MDR-TB), even if a specimen has already been obtained for microbiology before commencing treatment.|$|E
25|$|Until 2007 in England and Wales, the Mental Health Act 1983 {{allowed the}} use of ECT on {{detained}} patients {{whether or not they}} had capacity to consent to it. However, following amendments which took effect in 2007, ECT may not generally be given to a patient who has capacity and refuses it, irrespective of his or her detention under the Act. In fact, even if a patient is deemed to lack capacity, if they made a valid advance decision refusing ECT <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> not be given it; and even if they do not have an advance decision, the psychiatrist must obtain an independent second opinion (which is also the case if the patient is under age of consent). However, there is an exception regardless of consent and capacity; under Section 62 of the Act, if the treating psychiatrist says the need for treatment is urgent they may start a course of ECT without authorization. From 2003 to 2005, about 2,000 people a year in England and Wales were treated without their consent under the Mental Health Act. Concerns have been raised by the official regulator that psychiatrists are too readily assuming that patients have the capacity to consent to their treatments, {{and that there is a}} worrying lack of independent advocacy. In Scotland, the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 also gives patients with capacity the right to refuse ECT.|$|E

500|$|Many {{members of}} the Australian media alleged a {{conspiracy}} against Meckiff. Ian McDonald of Melbourne's Sporting Globe said the bowler's action had not changed in the previous eight years and stated: [...] "the whole affair smacks of a set-up". Sydney's Mirror labelled the paceman [...] "the most obvious fall-guy in Australian cricket history". On the third morning of the match, former first-class cricketer Percy Beames, writing for Melbourne's The Age, claimed Meckiff had {{been used as a}} [...] "sacrificial goat" [...] and called for the selectors' resignation. Keith Miller wrote a column calling for Bradman's and Jack Ryder's removal from the selection panel, noting that they had watched Meckiff's performance against Western Australia which prompted his Test selection. Miller felt that if the selectors deemed the bowler illegitimate, <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> not have allowed him to be [...] "executed" [...] by the umpires. Jack Pollard said: [...] "there is little doubt Meckiff was sacrificed to end the long-running controversy and the way it was done irked many cricket-lovers." [...] Cricketer-turned-journalist Dick Whitington asserted that Benaud was aware his fast bowler had been set up, claiming that the Australian captain knew of Bradman's views on Meckiff's action. Whitington further cited the fact that Egar and Bradman had travelled from Adelaide to the Brisbane Test together as evidence of a plot. Others saw Bradman's tea-time conversation with Benaud after the no-balling as proof of a conspiracy. Benaud repudiated allegations claiming he was involved in a set-up.|$|E
500|$|England {{was facing}} the {{prospect}} of setting a new record for the lowest Test innings score at Trent Bridge, worse than the 112 made by England against Warwick Armstrong's Australians in 1921. However, a late fightback averted the unwanted record. Laker and Bedser, both from Surrey, joined forces and scored {{more than half of}} England's total, adding 89 runs in only 73 minutes. Laker's innings was highlighted by hooking and driving, while Bedser defended stoutly and drove in front of the wicket, much to the delight of the Nottingham crowd, who had appeared to have become depressed by the collapse of England's batsmen. At first, Bradman did not appear concerned by the partnership between the two bowlers from Surreyit was thought the Australian captain may have been happy for England to continue batting so his top order would not have to bat in fading light {{towards the end of the}} afternoon, but he became anxious as the total continued to mount and both Bedser and Laker appeared comfortable. O'Reilly speculated that both players had batted confidently as their home ground in SurreyThe Ovalhad a reputation for being batsman-friendly, and that as they would have had to contend with opposition batsmen who had the benefit of consistently favourable conditions, <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> also prepare so they too could capitalise on their opportunities with the willow. According to English commentator John Arlott, the playing surface was easier for batting than it had been at the start of the day, [...] "but the difference was not such as to cause hesitation in the best batsmen in England".|$|E
