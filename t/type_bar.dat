40|$|We {{present an}} {{analysis}} of the molecular gas distributions in the 29 barred and 15 unbarred spirals in the BIMA CO (J= 1 – 0) Survey of Nearby Galaxies (SONG). For galaxies that are bright in CO, we confirm the conclusion by Sakamoto et al. (1999 b) that barred spirals have higher molecular gas concentrations in the central kiloparsec. The SONG sample also includes 27 galaxies below the CO brightness limit used by Sakamoto et al. Even in these less CO-bright galaxies we show that high central gas concentrations are more common in barred galaxies, consistent with radial inflow driven by the bar. However, there is a significant population of early-type (Sa–Sbc) barred spirals (6 of 19) that have no molecular gas detected in the nuclear region, and have very little out to the bar co-rotation radius. This suggests that in barred galaxies with gas-deficient nuclear regions the bar has already driven most of the gas within the bar co-rotation radius to the nuclear region, where it has been consumed by star formation. The median mass of nuclear molecular gas is over four times higher in early <b>type</b> <b>bars</b> than in late <b>type</b> (Sc–Sdm) <b>bars.</b> Since previous work has shown that the gas consumption rate is an order of magnitude higher in early <b>type</b> <b>bars,</b> this implies that the early types have significantly higher bar-driven inflows. The lower accretion rates in late <b>type</b> <b>bars</b> can probably be attributed to the known differences i...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In TFT-LCD {{manufacturing}} process, the ACF is {{an essential}} material. To make the driving circuit conductive, the ACF attach process is used in bonding process. Since the total manufacturing cost becomes lower year by year, the ACF material occupies {{a great deal of}} manufacturing cost. The boding technology has been changed from the conventional long <b>bar</b> <b>type</b> into short <b>bar</b> <b>type</b> to save the material usage. The parameter setting of the short <b>bar</b> <b>type</b> machine was not initially optimized. The NG rate of short <b>bar</b> <b>type</b> ACF attach process is higher as compared to the long <b>bar</b> <b>type.</b> The rework cost and material cost may increase in the short <b>bar</b> <b>type</b> process. Therefore, the parameter optimization for the associated short <b>bar</b> <b>type</b> ACF attach process becomes an essential problem. The response surface method is adopted to model the problem. The yield rate is selected as objective function for study. In the analysis of response surface method, the plasma clean speed, ACF peeling speed and ACF cutter spring setting are selected three key factors for discussion. Results reveal that the yield rate can be improved up to 99. 35 %, which is very helpful to improve the manufacturing process. 1...|$|R

50|$|In {{the model}} 407, each <b>type</b> <b>bar</b> was {{replaced}} with a type wheel, with the characters along the outside edge. To print, each wheel was rotated to the correct character position, then the entire wheel was pushed forward to strike the paper. This action was somewhat faster in that the wheels were less massive than the bars and could be positioned more rapidly. Still, however, speeds of 150 lines per minute were all that were achieved. Although this might seem slow by later printing standards, {{the speed at which}} electromechanical accounting machines could read punched cards and perform their basic arithmetic functions meant that no faster printing speeds were needed. The IBM 1132 was the last printer manufactured by IBM to use this technology.|$|E

There are three types of bullet comments offered in Bilibili, rolling comments, top comments and bottom comments. For non-registered visitors, they are able to post either small or medium size bullet comments. Each comment is limited to 20 characters and visitors cannot comment the normal comment page(located below the video). For normal registered users, they are free to choose bullet comments from small to big size, limited of 220 characters. Also they can change the color of the bullet comments and they can comment on the video’s actual comment page. For “professional” bullet comment users, they can choose “extra small” and “extra big” bullet comment. They can also choose to move the comment from left to right (normally it goes from right to left). The blogger of the video has the right to clear or save all bullet comments.|$|E

40|$|Bond between Fibre Reinforced Polymer (FRP) Near-Surface Mounted (NSM) {{reinforcement}} {{and concrete}} {{is one of}} the key factors affecting the behaviour of this strengthening methodology. Properties of FRP, adhesive and concrete greatly affect the effectiveness of the NSM technique. Due to the variety of factors involved in the behaviour of FRP NSM strengthening systems, mechanical models able to incorporate the influencing variables acquire major importance for the prediction of the load capacity and the contribution of the different parameters. By predicting the results obtained in experimental direct pullout tests, a finite element model is adopted to assess the influence of relevant parameters on bond behaviour, namely: bar <b>type,</b> <b>bar</b> size, bond length, epoxy properties and concrete strength.
