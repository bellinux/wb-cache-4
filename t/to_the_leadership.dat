5|$|After resigning, Rudd {{stated that}} he did not think Gillard could defeat the Coalition at the next {{election}} and that, since his resignation, he had received encouragement from Labor MPs and Cabinet Ministers to contest the leadership. Gillard responded to these developments by announcing a leadership ballot for the morning of 27 February 2012, saying that if she lost the vote she would return to the backbench and renounce any claims <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>leadership.</b> She asked that Rudd make the same commitment.|$|E
5|$|Following further {{speculation}} {{over her}} leadership, on 26 June a rumour emerged that supporters of Kevin Rudd were collecting signatures for a letter demanding an immediate leadership vote. That afternoon, before any letter had been published, Gillard called a leadership spill live on television. She challenged any would-be opponent {{to join her}} in a pledge that, while the winner would become leader, the loser would immediately retire from politics. Despite his earlier comments {{that he would not}} return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>leadership</b> under any circumstances, Kevin Rudd announced that he would challenge Gillard for the leadership, and committed to retiring from politics if he lost. In the party-room ballot later that evening, Rudd defeated Gillard by a margin of 57 votes to 45.|$|E
5|$|For {{several weeks}} Lamason {{negotiated}} with the camp authorities to have the airmen transferred to a POW camp, but his requests were denied. At great risk, Lamason secretly got word to the Luftwaffe of the Allied airmen's captivity and, seven days before their scheduled execution, 156 of the 168 prisoners were transferred to Stalag Luft III. Most of the airmen credit their survival at Buchenwald <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>leadership</b> and determination of Lamason. After the war, he moved to Dannevirke and became a farmer until his retirement. During the 1980s and 1990s, he was a regular speaker at KLB Club and POW reunions.|$|E

5|$|Hananu's {{subordinate}} {{officers and}} rank-and-file fighters were all Sunni Muslims, but were ethnically heterogeneous. Hananu {{himself was a}} Kurd as were field commanders Najib Uwaid and Abdullah ibn Umar, while Umar al-Bitar was an Arab and field commander Sha'ban Agha was a Turk. The ′isabat led by al-Bitar and al-Qassam were dominated by Arabs. The localized nature of the revolt reflected the rebels' sense of defending their homeland and community. Despite the eventual organization of the revolt and coordination between rebel commanders for major military decisions, most political decisions and military operations were local initiatives. As such, al-Sa'dun referred to the revolt in the plural as thawrat al-Shimal (Northern revolts) rather than the singular thawra, and referred <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>leadership</b> of the revolt as the plural quwwad al-thawra rather than qiyadat al-thawra, which refers to a central command.|$|E
5|$|Prime Minister Kevin Rudd {{suffered}} {{a decline in}} his personal ratings, and a perceived loss of support among his own MPs, following {{the failure of the}} Government's insulation program, controversy regarding the implementation of a tax on mining, the failure of the government to secure passage of its carbon trading scheme and some policy debate about immigration policy. Significant disaffection had arisen within the Labor Party as <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>leadership</b> style and direction of Rudd. On 23 June 2010 he announced that Gillard had asked him to hold a leadership ballot the following day to determine the leadership of the Labor Party, and hence the Prime Ministership of Australia.|$|E
5|$|Years later, due to Betances' {{experience}} as a logistics facilitator of armed revolts, a fund raiser for the Cuban independence cause, and as a diplomat, José Martí asked Betances to become the leader of Cuban revolutionaries in France. Betances never met Martí personally, but Martí did know Betances' younger sister, Eduviges, who lived in New York City and shared her brother's revolutionary ideals. Martí assisted her financially in her final days, out of admiration for the Betances' family. Betances accepted the assignment out of gratitude towards Martí. Soon after, Martí died in battle in Cuba in 1895, an event that brought Tomás Estrada Palma <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>leadership</b> of the Cuban insurrection movement.|$|E

5|$|Albizu Campos {{had been}} {{corresponding}} with 34-year-old Lebrón from prison and chose {{a group of}} nationalists who included Rafael Cancel Miranda, Irvin Flores and Andres Figueroa Cordero to attack locations in Washington, D.C. Upon receiving the order she communicated it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>leadership</b> of the Nationalist party in New York and, although two members unexpectedly disagreed, the plan continued. Lebrón decided to lead the group, even though Albizu Campos did not order her to directly {{take part in the}} assault. She studied the plan, determining the possible weaknesses, concluding that a single attack on the House of Representatives would be more effective. The date for the attack on the House of Representatives was to be March 1, 1954. This date was chosen because it coincided with the inauguration of the Conferencia Interamericana (Interamerican Conference) in Caracas. Lebrón intended to call attention to Puerto Rico's independence cause, particularly among the Latin American countries participating in the conference.|$|E
5|$|The {{brutality}} and questionable {{legality of the}} earls' actions helped win political sympathy for the king. Pembroke was particularly offended, {{as he had been}} made to break his promise of safety to Gaveston, and his chivalric honour had been damaged. From this point on Pembroke sided firmly with King Edward in the political conflict. The king himself swore vengeance on his enemies, but found himself unable to move against them immediately, partly because they were in possession of a number of highly valuable royal jewels taken from Gaveston. A settlement was reached in October, whereby the rebellious barons and their retainers received a pardon. The king nevertheless emerged strengthened from the events, while Warwick and Lancaster were largely marginalised. This all changed in 1314, when the king decided to stage his first major campaign against the Scots. Warwick and Lancaster refused to participate and the campaign ended in a humiliating English defeat at the Battle of Bannockburn on 24 June. This led to another political reversal and Edward was forced to reconfirm the Ordinances, and submit <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>leadership</b> of the rebellious barons.|$|E
