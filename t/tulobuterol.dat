40|$|ABSTRACTBackgroundTransdermal patches {{containing}} <b>tulobuterol,</b> slow-releasing β 2 -agonist patches, are {{now widely}} used {{in the treatment of}} asthma in Japan. Unlike inhalational β 2 -agonists, <b>tulobuterol</b> patches act systemically and may modify the functional status of inflammatory cells in the peripheral circulation. The objective {{of this study is to}} examine the effect of <b>tulobuterol</b> on the adhesive interaction between blood eosinophils and endothelial cells. MethodsPeripheral blood eosinophils and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were pretreated with either <b>tulobuterol</b> or a control medium, and adhesion of eosinophils to HUVEC was examined using an eosinophil peroxidase assay. ResultsSpontaneous adhesion of eosinophils to resting HUVEC was not modified by <b>tulobuterol.</b> On the other hand, eosinophil adhesion to IL- 4 +TNFα-stimulated-HUVEC was inhibited minimally but significantly by <b>tulobuterol.</b> Furthermore, both IL- 5 - and FMLP-activated adhesions of eosinophils to HUVEc were partially but significantly inhibited by <b>tulobuterol.</b> ConclusionsTulobuterol can decrease adhesion of blood eosinophils to endothelial cells. This finding suggests that <b>tulobuterol</b> patches have anti-inflammatory properties, and may therefore contribute to the treatment of airway inflammation in asthma...|$|E
40|$|Experiments were {{designed}} to determine the mechanism of action of the bronchodilator drug <b>tulobuterol.</b> Tissues were suspended in organ chambers for isometric tension recording. <b>Tulobuterol</b> caused concentration-dependent relaxations of guinea pig tracheae, canine saphenous veins and canine bronchi; the compound relaxed canine coronary arteries only at high concentrations and did not affect spontaneously beating guinea pig atria. A metabolite of <b>tulobuterol,</b> 4 -hydroxytulobuterol, was more potent in relaxing guinea pig tracheae than <b>tulobuterol,</b> salbutamol and isoproterenol. Other metabolites (3 -hydroxy-, 5 -hydroxy- and 4, 5 -dihydroxytulobuterol) were less efficacious than 4 -hydroxytulobuterol. Both <b>tulobuterol</b> and 4 -hydroxytulobuterol acted as partial agonists. The effects of <b>tulobuterol</b> in the saphenous vein (but not in the coronary artery) were antagonized by the selective beta- 2 adrenergic blocker ICI 118, 551 but were not affected by the selective beta- 1 adrenergic inhibitor metoprolol. In bronchi, removal of the epithelium reduced the relaxations caused by <b>tulobuterol.</b> The drug did not inhibit responses of canine bronchi to electrical stimulation of the cholinergic nerves more than those to exogenous acetylcholine. <b>Tulobuterol</b> caused a moderate augmentation of the evoked release of [3 H]norepinephrine in canine saphenous veins previously incubated with the labeled transmitter. Thus, <b>tulobuterol</b> is a selective beta- 2 adrenergic agonist with minimal nonselective inhibitory effect on airway and vascular smooth muscle. It also facilitates adrenergic neurotransmission, which may help to explain its bronchodilator effect in the intact organism. <b>Tulobuterol</b> does not activate beta- 1 adrenoceptors and has no direct positive chronotropic effect. A metabolite of <b>tulobuterol,</b> 4 -hydroxytulobuterol, is more active than the parent compound. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|SummaryBackgroundThe current {{mainstream}} {{treatment for}} COPD is bronchodilators {{alone or in}} combination. The effects of a β 2 -agonist, <b>tulobuterol,</b> administered transdermally, {{have been reported to}} last for 24 h. However, there are no reports on the efficacy of <b>tulobuterol</b> combined with an anticholinergic. In this study, we investigated the efficacy and safety of transdermal <b>tulobuterol</b> combined with inhaled tiotropium in COPD. MethodsAfter a 2 -week run-in period, 103 stable COPD patients aged ≥ 40 years were randomized into two groups: inhaled tiotropium (18 μg, Tio group) or transdermal <b>tulobuterol</b> (2 mg) combined with inhaled tiotropium (18 μg, Tio+Tulo group) for 8 weeks. Primary endpoints were pulmonary function and severity of dyspnea. The St. George's Respiratory Questionaire (SGRQ) score was a secondary endpoint. ResultsIn both groups, FEV 1 and FVC as well as dyspnea improved significantly after 8 weeks. In a comparison of both groups, percentage changes in IC and morning and evening peak expiratory flow were significantly greater in the Tio+Tulo group than in the Tio group. In addition, significant improvement in SGRQ score was observed in the Tio+Tulo group only. The risk of adverse events related to the study drugs was not increased. ConclusionIn COPD patients, additional administration of transdermal <b>tulobuterol</b> to inhaled tiotropium produced significant benefits in dyspnea and SGRQ score as well as pulmonary function. These benefits may be due to a reduction in pulmonary hyperinflation resulting from improvement of peripheral airflow obstruction through <b>tulobuterol</b> via the systemic circulation...|$|E

40|$|Clinical {{choice of}} β 2 -adrenergic {{receptor}} agonists (β 2 -agonists) {{is based on}} the parameter of receptor selectivity, potency, and duration of action. The guidelines for asthma management describe nothing about intrinsic efficacy concerning the use of β 2 -agonists. Since intrinsic efficacy refers to the ability to activate β 2 -adrenergic receptors independent of agonist concentration, β 2 -adrenergic desensitization may be associated with intrinsic efficacy. However, little is currently known whether chronic administration of high intrinsic efficacy drugs interferes with the effects of β 2 -agonists as a reliever medication. In this review, the causal relationship between intrinsic efficacy and desensitization to β 2 -agonists is examined in tracheal smooth muscle using isometric tension records. Reasonable clinical use of these agonists based on these observations is discussed. When β 2 -agonists intrinsic efficacy was measured as relaxation response (the maximum inhibitory effects against 1 μM methacholine-induced contraction), their rank order was : isoproterenol = procaterol = formoterol > salbutamol > salmeterol >> <b>tulobuterol.</b> Next, the subsequent response to short-acting β 2 -agonists (procaterol, salbutamol) was examined after continuous exposure to long-acting β 2 -agonists (formoterol, salmeterol, <b>tulobuterol).</b> β 2 - adrenergic desensitization induced by these long-acting β 2 -agonists was enhanced in proportion to their intrinsic efficacies. On the other hand, under the conditions of impairment of β 2 -adrenergic receptors, reduced responsiveness to these short-acting β 2 -agonists was enhanced in inverse proportion to the intrinsic efficacy. Although the clinical relevance of these results is still unclear, our data may provide evidence that weak partial agonists are useful as a controller medication, whereas full or strong agonists are useful as a reliever medication...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACTβ-adrenergic {{agonists}} {{have been}} traditionally classified as strong or weak.

Valid responses were obtained from 1470 patients. Among asthmatic patients, the percentage of those who selected “taking as prescribed” was 52. 7 % for inhalant users and 83. 2 % for transdermal users. Among patients with COPD, the corresponding values were 54. 7 % and 86. 6 %. There was a significant difference (p< 0. 01) in treatment compliance between inhalation and transdermal formulations in both groups. The most common reason for poor adherence was “frequency of administration”, and 83. 2 % of the patients preferred a once-daily administration.

40|$|Background: The bronchodilating {{action of}} β-agonists {{depends on the}} tone of airway smooth muscle or on spasmogen. To {{estimate}} the precise intrinsic activity of β-agonists, relaxation responses should be examined on maximally contracted airway smooth muscle. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the relaxation responses to β-agonists under different tonic conditions of airway smooth muscle. Methods: We examined the relaxation response to β-agonists on the isolated tracheal ring preparations in guinea-pigs precontracted with different concentrations of carbachol, leukotriene D 4 or substance P, and compared these results with that of spontaneously developed muscle tone. Results: Relaxation responses to β-agonists were diminished depending on the extent of carbachol-induced tone in the tracheal muscle. The degree of hyporesponsiveness was greatest in treatment with <b>tulobuterol,</b> procaterol and isoproterenol, but least with adrenaline, formoterol and salmeterol. Diminished relaxation responses to β-agonists were partially reversed by pretreatment with AF-DX 116, a muscarinic M 2 receptor antagonist. When the tracheal muscle was precontracted with different concentrations of leukotriene D 4 (1 – 100 nM) or substance P (0. 1 - 10 μM), a diminished relaxation response to procaterol was not observed. Conclusions: All β-agonists tested were partial agonists for relaxation of the carbachol-contracted guinea-pig tracheal muscle, where adrenaline rather than isoproterenol had the highest intrinsic activity...|$|E

In addition, the physicochemical properties of the syrups in a solid state were compared. Evaluation of sweetness with a powdered sample revealed significant differences between formulation A and formulation B and between formulation B and formulation C. In contrast, the results of principal component analysis (PCA) with a taste sensor revealed differences in principal component 1 (PC 1) among formulations A, B, and C. Smell sensor measurement of powdered samples revealed differences in products in terms of only PC 1, but these results were not related to the results of gustatory sensation testing with a smell sensor. Measurement of particle size distribution and scanning electron microscopy revealed differences in the particle diameter and particle surface shape for each product. Formulation B had the strongest absorption in the near-infrared spectrum, followed by formulation A and then formulation C. Accordingly, differences in preparations were presumably caused by variations in manufacturing specifications, such as types of additives and their content and coating methods used.

In this case report, we described the experience of successful treatment of a patient with severe asthmatic status due to Yokkaichi asthma. A 40 s-year-old man, who was officially certified as a patient with Yokkaichi asthma from his infancy, was admitted to hospital due to acute exacerbation of asthma. Mechanical ventilation, intravenous administration of aminophylline and dexamethasone, enteral administration of montelukast, and a transdermal patch of <b>tulobuterol</b> were started. However, because of the lack of improvement in clinical status, inhalation of procaterol using vibrating mesh nebulizer systems was started. Inhalation of procaterol was used three times a day. After using the vibrating mesh nebulizer, respiratory system compliance and hypercapnia rapidly improved. Bilateral expiratory wheezing was diminished. Weaning from mechanical ventilation was initiated, and on the eighth day of mechanical ventilation, the patient was extubated. Although intractable respiratory failure with decreased respiratory system compliance resulting from the late effects of air pollution and a long-time asthmatic inflammatory condition was observed, the use of a vibrating mesh nebulizer for the inhaled administration of procaterol was useful to relieve severe bronchospasm due to Yokkaichi asthma...|$|E

Study 2 : We compared add-on effects of TP, SRT, and LTRA in 65 patients with asthma receiving ICS alone, using spirometry and peak expiratory flow (PEF). Participants in these studies had experienced decrease in morning PEF to < 80 % of the predicted value at least twice a week. ResultsStudy 1 : In the TP group, improvement of bronchial hyperresponsiveness and decrease in percentage of sputum eosinophils both indicated a statistically significant difference (p < 0. 01, and p < 0. 05, respectively). These findings were not observed in the control group. Study 2 : forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1) and PEF markedly increased after treatment with TP compared with treatment with SRT or LTRA. ConclusionsThese findings suggest that TP {{can be used as a}} long-term add-on controller for patients with asthma receiving ICS...|$|E
