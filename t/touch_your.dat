500|$|The {{music for}} Nil Battey Sannata was {{composed}} by newcomers Rohan and Vinayak, with Manoj Yadav, Nitesh Tiwari and Shreyas Jain as lyricists for the soundtrack. Joginder Tuteja's mixed review for Bollywood Hungama was largely {{appreciative of the}} songs [...] "Murabba" [...] and [...] "Maths Mein Dabba Gul", also acknowledging the soundtrack's [...] "rural flavor". He deemed the overall album to be [...] "strictly situational". The Times of India critic Mohar Basu gave the soundtrack a 3 out 5 star rating, saying that the [...] "album wins you over with its innocence". Praising the pleasant [...] "Murabba" [...] and the catchy [...] "Maths Mein Dabba", he asserted that the film [...] "has music that will <b>touch</b> <b>your</b> heart".|$|E
500|$|Capoeira is an Afro-Brazilian martial art, {{described}} by Pabon as [...] "a form of self defense {{disguised as a}} dance." [...] Its influence on breaking is disputed and debated; one side believes that breaking came from capoeira, while the other side denies this. Capoeira is hundreds of years older than breaking, and uprock is similar in purpose to capoeira in that both translate aggressive combat movements into stylized dance. Both breaking and capoeira are performed to music and, since both art forms are acrobatic, some moves look similar to each other. However, capoeira is more rule-oriented. One rule in capoeira is that a capoeirista's back can never touch the ground. In contrast, a breaker's back is almost always on the ground, and the only rule in breaking {{is that you do}} not <b>touch</b> <b>your</b> opponent during a battle.|$|E
500|$|Writing for {{the portal}} Vistina, Maja Bećković {{credited}} the singer for conveying [...] "so much warmth, so many emotions" [...] in an album; she called [...] "every word - a new pearl, every verse - gold, every vocal - a shining diamond". She continued describing the songs as [...] "so authentic, so old, so archaic and yet, so modern and rich, both production and author-wise". The journalist {{observed that the}} lyrics were carefully selected with every track eligible for [...] "a compilation containing the best lyric songs from this region, which contains so many centuries of elegy and sadness, interwoven with rare moments of joy, which make life worth living". She credited the singer for adding even [...] more value to what already was valuable material arranged for the album and concluded, [...] "All in all, Macedonian girl will <b>touch</b> <b>your</b> heart and spirit even for the second time".|$|E

500|$|The [...] "b-boys" [...] and [...] "b-girls" [...] {{were the}} dancers to Herc's breaks, who were {{described}} as [...] "breaking". Herc has noted that [...] "breaking" [...] was also street slang of the time meaning [...] "getting excited", [...] "acting energetically," [...] or [...] "causing a disturbance". Herc coined the terms [...] "b-boy", [...] "b-girl," [...] and [...] "breaking" [...] which {{became part of the}} lexicon of what would be eventually called hip hop culture. Early Kool Herc b-boy and later DJ innovator Grandmixer DXT describes the early evolution as follows: [...] " ... verybody would form a circle and the B-boys would go into the center. At first the dance was simple: <b>touch</b> <b>your</b> toes, hop, kick out your leg. Then some guy went down, spun around on all fours. Everybody said wow and went home to {{try to come up with}} something better."In the early 1980s, the media began to call this style [...] "breakdance," [...] which in 1991 the New York Times wrote was [...] "an art as demanding and inventive as mainstream dance forms like ballet and jazz." [...] Since this emerging culture was still without a name, participants often identified as [...] "b-boys," [...] a usage that included and went beyond the specific connection to dance, a usage that would persist in hip hop culture.|$|E

In August 2008, her Education for Leisure, {{a poem about}} violence, {{was removed from the}} AQA {{examination}} board's GCSE poetry anthology, following a complaint about its references to knife crime and a goldfish being flushed down a toilet. The poem begins, [...] "Today I am going to kill something. Anything./I have had enough of being ignored and today/I am going to play God." [...] The protagonist kills a fly, then a goldfish. The budgie panics and the cat hides. It ends with him, or her, leaving the house with a knife. [...] "The pavements glitter suddenly. I <b>touch</b> <b>your</b> arm." ...|$|E

2500|$|By {{at least}} 1975 Genie clearly {{understood}} and incorporated {{the concept of}} temporality into her speech, and unusually for people acquiring a first language she understood the words before and after before learning past or future tense markers. She could also use sentences to indicate causation, albeit without saying the words if and then. Despite this, by 1975 Genie remained largely unable to respond to sentences where the nouns {{were not in the}} same sequence as the events, such as [...] "Touch your ear after you <b>touch</b> <b>your</b> nose", although she improved more with sentences asking her to do something after instead of doing something before. In a 1981 paper Curtiss interpreted Genie's temporal utterances as an expansion of Genie's vocabulary, but an outside analysis of Curtiss' writings concluded that Genie had to have acquired some degree of grammar to have formed these sentences.|$|E
2500|$|Sellers was {{executed}} {{by lethal injection}} at 12:17a.m. on February 4, 1999. He spoke to his step-siblings, saying, [...] "All {{the people who are}} hating me right now and are here waiting to see me die, when {{you wake up in the}} morning, you aren't going to feel any different. You are going to hate me as much tomorrow as you do tonight. Reach out to God and he will hear you. Let him <b>touch</b> <b>your</b> hearts. Don't hate all your lives.". Sellers did not mention his mother or apologize for what he had done. His statement outraged his step-siblings. Noelle Terry, his stepsister, later said, [...] "He basically addressed the fact that we would still feel the same. It is very presumptuous that he would know how we would still feel." [...] His last words were a modern Christian music song: [...] "Set my spirit free that I might praise Thee. Set my spirit free that I might worship Thee." ...|$|E

[...] The {{individual}} in the poem feels undervalued and gradually progresses into insanity by experimenting progressively with violence beginning with killing a fly and a goldfish before terrifying a budgie and going outside armed with a bread knife; {{the last line of}} the poem is [...] "I <b>touch</b> <b>your</b> arm" [...] indicating the poet intends to take their first human life {{and at the same time}} creating an illusion to the reader they are under threat. The narrator's identity is never fully revealed however there are lines that allude to some facts on the character, one being the narrator is on the dole ("signing on" [...] on a regular basis is mentioned) and it is also twice implied the narrator maybe craved recognition or even celebrity status after leaving school (the character mentions the dole office does not appreciate their autograph and towards the end of the poem tells someone over the phone in a radio station that they are [...] "talking to a superstar").|$|E

2500|$|Impaired verbal {{comprehension}} can be {{the result}} [...] a number of causes such as failure of speech sound discrimination, word recognition, auditory working memory, or syntactic structure building. When clinically examined, patients with TSA will exhibit poor comprehension of verbal commands. Based {{on the extent of}} the comprehension deficiency, patients will have difficulty following simple commands, e.g. “close your eyes.” Depending on the extent of affected brain area, patients are able to follow simple commands but {{may not be able to}} comprehend more difficult, multistep commands, e.g. “point to the ceiling, then <b>touch</b> <b>your</b> left ear with your right hand." [...] Verbal commands as such, that require the patient to cross over the midline of their body are typically more taxing than commands that involve solely the right or left side. When increasing the complexity of verbal commands comprehension is often tested by varying the grammatical structure of the command to determine whether or not the patient understands different grammatical variations of the same sentence. Commands involving the passive voice or possessive, e.g. [...] "If the snake killed the mouse, which one is still alive," [...] usually result in comprehension problems in those who can understand simple questions.|$|E
