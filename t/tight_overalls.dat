40|$|Recent {{research}} in hybrid optimization {{shows that a}} combination of technologies that exploits their complementary strengths can significantly speed up computation. The use of high-level metaconstraints in the problem formulation can achieve a substantial share of these computational gains by better communicating problem structure to the solver. During the solution process, however, metaconstraints give rise to reformulations or relaxations that introduce auxiliary variables, and some of the variables in one metaconstraint’s reformulation may be functionally the same as or related to variables in another metaconstraint’s reformulation. These relationships must be recognized to obtain a <b>tight</b> <b>overall</b> relaxation. We propose a modeling scheme based on semantic typing that systematically addresses this problem while providing simpler, self-documenting models. It organizes the model around predicates and declares variables by associating each with a predicate through a keyword that is analogous to a database query. We present a series of examples to illustrate this idea over a wide variety of applications. Key words: modeling; hybrid methods; metaconstraints; semantics 1...|$|R

40|$|Tweakable blockciphers, first formalized by Liskov, Rivest, and Wagner [17], are blockciphers with an {{additional}} input, the tweak, which provides an easy mechanism for obtaining multiple “essentially different ” permutations from a single key. Liskov et al. advocate an altered methodology for symmetric cryptography: instead of designing modes of operation using blockciphers directly, first design tweakable blockciphers, and then build modes of operation. Though this method has conceptual advantages, it can introduce an extra layer of analysis in which proof tightness can be lost. We consider the notion of security-preserving mid-level constructions, by which we mean constructions that do not introduce any loss of security. We give tweakable blockciphers that meet this goal in a limited sense (they are security-preserving for certain applications), and show that they can help us create <b>tighter</b> <b>overall</b> proofs of security. We also show the novelty of these constructions by demonstrating that all previously proposed generic tweakable blockciphers are not security preserving even in this limited sense. ...|$|R

Although employment protection legislation is {{only one aspect of}} the wide range of regulatory interventions in the labour market, Nicoletti et al.

They claim that the indicators presented in their paper are closely related, with a statistical correlation of 0.73 (significant at the 1% level). In other words, according to these results, restrictive product market regulations are matched by analogous EPL restrictions to generate a <b>tight</b> <b>overall</b> regulatory environment for firms in their product market {{as well as in the}} allocation of labour inputs. The strong correlation between regulatory regimes inthe product market and EPL also suggests that their influence may have compounded effects on labour market outcomes, making regulatory reform in only one market less effective than simultaneous reform in the two markets.|$|R
40|$|To {{guarantee}} the completeness of bounded model checking (BMC) we require a completeness threshold. The {{diameter of the}} Kripke model of the transition system is a valid completeness threshold for BMC of safety properties. The recurrence diameter gives us an upper bound on the diameter for use in practice. Transition systems are usually described using (propositionally) factored representations. Bounds for such lifted representations are calculated in a compositional way, by first identifying and bounding atomic subsystems, and then composing those results according to subsystem dependencies {{to arrive at a}} bound for the concrete system. Compositional approaches are invalid when using the diameter to bound atomic subsystems, and valid when using the recurrence diameter. We provide a novel overapproximation of the diameter, called the sublist diameter, that is tighter than the recurrence diameter. We prove that compositional approaches are valid using it to bound atomic subsystems. Those proofs are mechanised in HOL 4.

40|$|Thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) are ligand-gated {{transcription}} factors with critical {{roles in}} development and metabolism. Although x-ray structures of TR ligand-binding domains (LBDs) with agonists are available, comparable structures without ligand (apo-TR) or with antagonists are not. It remains {{important to understand}} apo-LBD conformation {{and the way that}} it rearranges with ligands to develop better TR pharmaceuticals. In this study, we conducted hydrogen/deuterium exchange on TR LBDs with or without agonist (T- 3) or antagonist (NH 3). Both ligands reduce deuterium incorporation into LBD amide hydrogens, implying <b>tighter</b> <b>overall</b> folding of the domain. As predicted, mass spectroscopic analysis of individual proteolytic peptides after hydrogen/deuterium exchange reveals that ligand increases the degree of solvent protection of regions close to the buried ligand-binding pocket. However, there is also extensive ligand protection of other regions, including the dimer surface at H 10 -H 11, providing evidence for allosteric communication between the ligand-binding pocket and distant interaction surfaces. Surprisingly, C-terminal activation helix H 12, which is known to alter position with ligand, remains relatively protected from solvent in all conditions suggesting that it is packed against the LBD irrespective of the presence or type of ligand. T- 3, but not NH 3, increases accessibility of the upper part of H 3 -H 5 to solvent, and we propose that TR H 12 interacts with this region in apo-TR and that this interaction is blocked by T- 3 but not NH 3. We present data from site-directed mutagenesis experiments and molecular dynamics simulations that lend support to this structural model of apo-TR and its ligand-dependent conformational changes.

40|$|The {{effect of}} ethanol-induced lipid {{interdigitation}} on the partition coefficient (Kp) of 6 -propionyl- 2 -(dimethylamino) naphthalene (Prodan) and its two derivatives, 6 -acetyl- 2 -(dimethylamino) naphthalene (Acdan) and 6 -lauroyl- 2 -(dimethylamino) naphthalene (Laurdan), in L-alpha-dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) vesicles has been examined by a precipitation method over the ethanol concentration range of 0 - 1. 8 M. At 20 degrees C {{and in the}} absence of ethanol, the Kp values for Acdan, Prodan, and Laurdan are 2. 0 x 10 (3), 2. 8 x 10 (4), and 4. 7 x 10 (6), respectively. This result suggests that the Kp of Prodan and its derivatives is not simply a linear function of the polymethylene units. As DPPC undergoes the ethanol-induced phase transition from the noninterdigitated to the fully interdigitated gel state, Kp for Prodan and Acdan decreases by a factor of 5 and 2, respectively, whereas Kp for Laurdan exhibits no detectable changes with ethanol. The differences in Kp are in parallel with the differences in the fluorescence emission spectra of these probes over the ethanol concentration range examined. Previous fluorescence and infrared data indicated that membrane perturbation caused by the probes increases in the order: Laurdan > Prodan > Acdan. Thus, the degree of membrane perturbation also seems to be in parallel with Kp. Among these three probes, Prodan fluorescence reflects most correctly the ethanol-induced lipid interdigitation. In conclusion, the partitioning of small solutes in lipid membranes is significantly reduced by ethanol-induced lipid interdigitation, probably as a result of an increased membrane surface density due to the increased intramolecular lipid acyl chain ordering and a <b>tighter</b> <b>overall</b> intermolecular packing...|$|R

30|$|Non-aeronautical {{production}} per se is {{very complex}} {{due to the}} fact that airport is no longer just a place where people go travel by airplane. The non-aeronautical business, that is also known as commercial service usually consists of franchise-based operations and self-operations, such as ground handling agent service supplied for airliners, in-flight catering services, duty free and other retail shops in the terminals, leasing of advertising space inside and outside the terminals of the airport, provision of goods warehousing, cargo handling agent companies (Liu 2016; Adler and Liebert 2014; Oum et al. 2003, 2007; Oum and Yu 2004). The airport is rightly a place for airplane but the business expanded to non-aeronautical side due to the increase in air traffic globally. Studying financial statements for the airport and counseling with airport managers, among inputs for non-aeronautical business, top three contributing inputs were chosen: restaurant size, duty-free store size and parking lot capacity. Inefficiency occurs when aircraft movement is low given the non-aeronautical inputs. Aircraft movement is chosen as intermediate product as airports’ main focus is aircraft taking off and landing. From managerial perspective, decreasing the size of non-aeronautical inputs should be considered if aircraft movement is low; that is, not many people visit airport but excessive investment on building large airport should be reconsidered. For the second sub-process for the non-aeronautical production, if the small number of aircraft movement leads to higher non-aeronautical and the large number of passengers, it could be efficient. This could give us an insight that passengers visiting the airport might spend relatively more money than other airports or a number of visitors visit the airport or the schedule for the aircraft movement is <b>tight.</b> <b>Overall,</b> we want to see whether the inefficiency or efficiency for the sub-processes might have an impact upon the overall efficiency by calculating the overall efficiency.|$|R
