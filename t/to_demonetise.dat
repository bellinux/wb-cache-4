Many decades later, in November 2016, Modi government decided <b>to</b> <b>demonetise</b> 500 and 1000 rupee notes {{in an effort to}} stop the counterfeiting of the current banknotes alleged to be used for funding terrorism in India and for cracking down on black money in the country.|$|E
5|$|The {{change over}} process was given {{at short notice}} and was also rapid because all issues prior to the August 2006 series were <b>to</b> be <b>demonetised</b> and {{rendered}} worthless on 21 August 2006. Poor communications meant that many civilians of Zimbabwe were unable to convert old bearer cheques to new ones before the deadline.|$|R

500|$|The British florin, or two {{shilling}} coin, {{was issued}} from 1849 until 1967, [...] {{with a final}} issue for collectors dated 1970.

50|$|On 24 November 2016, Doordarshan {{journalist}} Satyendra Murli, {{claimed that}} the Prime Minister’s ‘live’ address had actually been pre-recorded and edited. At a press conference held at the Press Club of India in New Delhi, Satyendra Murli alleged that Narendra Modi misled {{the citizens of the}} country by recording the announcement and took a unilateral decision <b>to</b> <b>demonetise</b> notes, which made up over 85 per cent in circulation. He has filed an RTI requesting this information be made public.|$|E
50|$|The plan <b>to</b> <b>demonetise</b> the rupee 500 and rupee 1000 bank notes began six to {{ten months}} prior, and was kept highly {{confidential}} with only about ten people {{aware of it}} completely. The logistical processes and preparations for printing the new rupee 500 and rupee 2000 bank notes began in early-May. The cabinet was informed about the demonetisation on 8 November 2016 in a meeting called by the Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi which was followed by Modi's public announcement about the demonetisation in a televised address.|$|E
5000|$|The Asian {{financial}} crisis of 1997-1998 reduced the rupiah's value by over 80% {{in a few}} months and was {{a major factor in the}} overthrow of President Suharto's government. The rupiah had traded at about 2000-3000 rupiah per 1 USD, but reached a low of 16,800 rupiah per dollar in June 1998. The currency, which had been relatively stable in prior years, had its value destroyed. The government did not take any action <b>to</b> <b>demonetise</b> or revalue the banknotes, [...] "Direksi 1998" [...] merely redesigned the 10,000 and 20,000 rupiah notes.|$|E

This applies <b>to</b> all <b>demonetised</b> or withdrawn currency, however such currency {{need not be}} accepted by money changers as {{it is no longer}} legal tender. All decimal notes are legal tender except $1 and $2 notes as these have been withdrawn.Damaged notes are still worth something so long as they are recognisable. The Reserve Bank website notes that {{as a rule of thumb}} if there is more than half a bank note they will pay its full value. To receive payment people have to turn in the note to either the Reserve Bank in Wellington or any bank.|$|R
25|$|In June 2015, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe began <b>to</b> {{formally}} <b>demonetise</b> the Zimbabwean dollar, {{to officially}} value the fiat currency at zero, {{in order to}} complete a switch to the US dollar {{by the end of}} September 2015. The Zimbabwean government stated that it would credit 5 US dollars to domestic bank accounts, with balances of up to 175 quadrillion Zimbabwean dollars, and that it would exchange Zimbabwean dollars for US dollars at a rate of 1 USD to 35 quadrillion Zimbabwean dollars to accounts with balances above 175 quadrillion Zimbabwean dollars. This move was meant to stabilise the economy and establish a credible nominal anchor under low inflation conditions. The exercise brought closure to the outstanding issue on the Zimbabwe dollar, further confirming the government's position that the local unit will not return anytime soon. The Government has maintained that the return of the Zimbabwe dollar would only be considered when key economic fundamentals, such productivity in key sectors, have been achieved.|$|R
50|$|After Prime Minister Narendra Modi's {{decision}} <b>to</b> <b>demonetise</b> ₹500 and ₹1000 rupee {{notes on}} 8th November 2016, various authorities noticed {{a surge in}} shell companies depositing cash in banks, possibly {{in an attempt to}} hide the real owner of the wealth. In response, in July 2017, the authorities ordered nearly 2 lakh shell companies to be shut down while Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) imposed trading restrictions on 162 listed entities as shell companies. A high-level task force found that hundreds of shell companies were registered in a few buildings in Kolkata. Many of those were found to be locked, with their padlocks coated in dust and many others which had office space the size of cubicles.|$|E
50|$|Chief Ministers {{of several}} Indian states like Mamata Banerjee, Arvind Kejriwal and Pinarayi Vijayan have criticised and led major {{protests against the}} {{decision}} in their states and in parliament. Initially, the move <b>to</b> <b>demonetise</b> and try to hinder black money was appreciated, but {{the manner in which}} it was carried out by causing hardships to common people was criticised. A Public Interest Litigation (PIL) was filed in Madras High Court by M Seeni Ahamed, General Secretary of the Indian National League, to scrap the decision. The High Court dismissed the PIL stating that it could not interfere in monetary policies of the government. Similar PILs were also filed in the Supreme Court of India. Supreme Court of India is yet to decide on the matter. It is listed for hearing on 2 December 2016.|$|E
50|$|Remedial {{legislation}} had to {{be introduced}} in 1838 so as to change over to the more realistic rating of $1 = 4s 2d. However, in Jamaica, British Honduras, Bermuda, {{and later in the}} Bahamas also, the official rating was set aside in favour of what was known as the 'Maccaroni' tradition in which a British shilling, referred to as a 'Maccaroni', was treated as one quarter of a dollar. The common link between these four territories was the Bank of Nova Scotia which brought in the 'Maccaroni' tradition, resulting in the successful introduction of both sterling coinage and sterling accounts. It wasn't however until 1 January 1842 that the authorities in Bermuda formally decided to make sterling the official currency of the colony to circulate concurrently with Doubloons (64 shillings) at the rate of $1 = 4s 2d. Contrary to expectations, and unlike in the Bahamas where US dollars circulated concurrently with sterling, the Bermudas did not allow themselves to be drawn into the U. S. currency area. The Spanish dollars fell away in the 1850s but returned again in the 1870s following the international silver crisis of 1873. In 1874, the Bermuda merchants agreed unanimously to decline to accept the heavy imports of U.S. currency except at a heavy discount, and it was then exported again. And in 1876, legislation was passed <b>to</b> <b>demonetise</b> the silver dollars for fear of them returning. In 1882, the local 'legal tender act' demonetised the gold doubloon, which had in effect been the real standard in Bermuda, and this left pounds, shillings, and pence as the sole legal tender.|$|E
