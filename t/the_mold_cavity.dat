5|$|Historically, {{solvent-based}} lubricants, such as {{diesel fuel}} and kerosene, were commonly used. These were good at releasing the {{part from the}} dies, but a small explosion occurred during each shot, {{which led to a}} build-up of carbon on <b>the</b> <b>mold</b> <b>cavity</b> walls. However, they were easier to apply evenly than water-based lubricants.|$|E
5|$|Die casting is a {{metal casting}} {{process that is}} {{characterized}} by forcing molten metal under high pressure into a mold cavity. <b>The</b> <b>mold</b> <b>cavity</b> is created using two hardened tool steel dies which have been machined into shape and work similarly to an injection mold during the process. Most die castings are made from non-ferrous metals, specifically zinc, copper, aluminium, magnesium, lead, pewter and tin-based alloys. Depending {{on the type of}} metal being cast, a hot- or cold-chamber machine is used.|$|E
5|$|When no {{porosity}} {{is allowed}} {{in a cast}} part then the pore-free casting process is used. It {{is identical to the}} standard process except oxygen is injected into the die before each shot to purge any air from <b>the</b> <b>mold</b> <b>cavity.</b> This causes small dispersed oxides to form when the molten metal fills the die, which virtually eliminates gas porosity. An added advantage to this is greater strength. Unlike standard die castings, these castings can be heat treated and welded. This process can be performed on aluminium, zinc, and lead alloys.|$|E
50|$|Gates: The {{controlled}} entrances {{from the}} runners into <b>the</b> <b>mold</b> <b>cavities.</b>|$|R
2500|$|One key in casting metal cores is to {{make sure}} they do not contain any {{porosity}} as it will induce flaws into <b>the</b> <b>molded</b> part. In order to minimize porosity the metal may be gravity cast or <b>the</b> <b>molding</b> <b>cavity</b> may be pressurized. Another system slowly rocks the casting dies as <b>the</b> <b>molding</b> <b>cavity</b> fills to [...] "shake" [...] the air bubbles out.|$|R
50|$|External chills are {{masses of}} {{material}} that have a high heat capacity and thermal conductivity. They are placed {{on the edge of}} <b>the</b> <b>molding</b> <b>cavity,</b> and effectively become part of the wall of <b>the</b> <b>molding</b> <b>cavity.</b> This type of chill can be used to increase the feeding distance of a riser or reduce the number of risers required.|$|R
25|$|Pouring - The mold is {{securely}} {{clamped together}} while the molten metal is poured from a ladle into the gating system and fills <b>the</b> <b>mold</b> <b>cavity.</b>|$|E
25|$|Pouring metal defects include misruns, cold shuts, and inclusions. A misrun {{occurs when}} the liquid metal does not {{completely}} fill <b>the</b> <b>mold</b> <b>cavity,</b> leaving an unfilled portion. Cold shuts occur when two fronts of liquid metal do not fuse properly in <b>the</b> <b>mold</b> <b>cavity,</b> leaving a weak spot. Both are caused by either a lack of fluidity in the molten metal or cross-sections that are too narrow. The fluidity can be increased by changing the chemical composition of the metal or by increasing the pouring temperature. Another possible cause is back pressure from improperly vented mold cavities.|$|E
25|$|In casting and molding {{the threads}} are {{directly}} {{formed by the}} geometry of <b>the</b> <b>mold</b> <b>cavity</b> in the mold or die. When the material freezes in the mold, it retains the shape after the mold is removed. The material is heated to a liquid, or mixed with a liquid that will either dry or cure (such as plaster or cement). Alternately, the material may be forced into a mold as a powder and compressed into a solid, as with graphite.|$|E
50|$|Gating system: The {{network of}} {{connected}} channels that deliver the molten material to <b>the</b> <b>mold</b> <b>cavities.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{connection}} of the riser to <b>the</b> <b>molding</b> <b>cavity</b> {{can be an}} issue for side risers. On one hand the connection should be as small as possible to make separation as easy as possible, but, on the other, the connection must be big enough for it to not solidify before the riser. The connection is usually made short {{to take advantage of}} the heat of both the riser and <b>the</b> <b>molding</b> <b>cavity,</b> which will keep it hot throughout the process.|$|R
40|$|Layered {{compaction}} manufacturing (LCM), {{which is}} a hybrid process of powder compaction and milling in layers, {{is applied to the}} fabrication of a cemented carbide mold (WCâ€“ 9 mass%Co) for the forming of optical glass lenses with internal cooling channels, which are placed along <b>the</b> <b>molding</b> <b>cavity.</b> <b>The</b> <b>mold</b> is produced by repeating the process of powder compaction with the subsequent creation of grooves filled with paraffin wax as a sacrificial material. The channels placed along <b>the</b> <b>molding</b> <b>cavity</b> are formed during the sintering process by dewaxing. In the sintering process, the extent of deformation {{in the shape of the}} internal channels and <b>molding</b> <b>cavity</b> is measured. It is found that the shapes of the channels and cavity exhibit uniform linear shrinkage in the range from 17 to 19 %. By filling <b>the</b> <b>molding</b> <b>cavity</b> with epoxy resin, the cooling capability of <b>the</b> <b>mold</b> by air is investigated by performing experiments as well as two-dimensional finite differences simulation. The cooling effect of <b>the</b> <b>mold</b> in <b>the</b> glass lens-forming process is also estimated by the simulation. For both resin and glass, when air is supplied to the channels, the obtained cooling rate is approximately ten times higher as compared to natural cooling at an ambient temperature...|$|R
25|$|Misruns {{and cold}} shuts {{are closely related}} and both involve the {{material}} freezing before it completely fills <b>the</b> <b>mold</b> <b>cavity.</b> These types of defects are serious because the area surrounding the defect is significantly weaker than intended. The castability and viscosity of the material can be important factors with these problems. Fluidity affects the minimum section thickness that can be cast, the maximum length of thin sections, fineness of feasibly cast details, and the accuracy of filling mold extremities. There are various ways of measuring the fluidity of a material, although it usually involves using a standard mould shape and measuring the distance the material flows. Fluidity {{is affected by the}} composition of the material, freezing temperature or range, surface tension of oxide films, and, most importantly, the pouring temperature. The higher the pouring temperature, the greater the fluidity; however, excessive temperatures can be detrimental, leading to a reaction between the material and the mold; in casting processes that use a porous mould material the material may even penetrate the mould material.|$|E
500|$|Two dies {{are used}} in die casting; one is called the [...] "cover die half" [...] and the other the [...] "ejector die half". Where they meet is called the parting line. The cover die {{contains}} the sprue (for hot-chamber machines) or shot hole (for cold-chamber machines), which allows the molten metal to flow into the dies; this feature matches up with the injector nozzle on the hot-chamber machines or the shot chamber in the cold-chamber machines. The ejector die contains the ejector pins and usually the runner, which is the path from the sprue or shot hole to <b>the</b> <b>mold</b> <b>cavity.</b> The cover die is secured to the stationary, or front, platen of the casting machine, while the ejector die {{is attached to the}} movable platen. <b>The</b> <b>mold</b> <b>cavity</b> is cut into two cavity inserts, which are separate pieces that can be replaced relatively easily and bolt into the die halves.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} are the four steps in traditional die casting, also known as , these are also the basis {{for any of the}} die casting variations: die preparation, filling, ejection, and shakeout. The dies are prepared by spraying <b>the</b> <b>mold</b> <b>cavity</b> with lubricant. The lubricant both helps control the temperature of the die and it also assists in the removal of the casting. The dies are then closed and molten metal is injected into the dies under high pressure; between [...] Once <b>the</b> <b>mold</b> <b>cavity</b> is filled, the pressure is maintained until the casting solidifies. The dies are then opened and the shot (shots are different from castings because there can be multiple cavities in a die, yielding multiple castings per shot) is ejected by the ejector pins. Finally, the shakeout involves separating the scrap, which includes the gate, runners, sprues and flash, from the shot. This is often done using a special trim die in a power press or hydraulic press. Other methods of shaking out include sawing and grinding. A less labor-intensive method is to tumble shots if gates are thin and easily broken; separation of gates from finished parts must follow. This scrap is recycled by remelting it. The yield is approximately 67%.|$|E
25|$|Evaporative-pattern casting {{is a type}} {{of casting}} process that uses a pattern made from a {{material}} that will evaporate when the molten metal is poured into <b>the</b> <b>molding</b> <b>cavity.</b> <b>The</b> most common evaporative-pattern material used is polystyrene foam.|$|R
40|$|Homogenous {{pressure}} distribution within <b>the</b> <b>molding</b> <b>cavity</b> is {{of particular}} importance for encapsulation of mechanically-sensitive electronic components, e. g., MEMS sensors, bare dies and flip chips. With the implementation of specially multilayered sensor films, a fast estimation of the pressure distribution within the cavity will be possible...|$|R
50|$|Risers are {{classified}} by three criteria. The first {{is if the}} riser {{is open to the}} atmosphere, if it is then it is called an open riser, otherwise it is known as a blind type. The second criterion is where the riser is located; if it is located on the casting then it is known as a top riser and if it is located next to the casting it is known as a side riser. Finally, if the riser is located on the gating system so that it fills after <b>the</b> <b>molding</b> <b>cavity,</b> it is known as a live riser or hot riser, but if the riser fills with materials that have already flowed through <b>the</b> <b>molding</b> <b>cavity</b> it is known as a dead riser or cold riser.|$|R
2500|$|Replicated CDs are mass-produced {{initially}} using {{a hydraulic}} press. Small granules of heated raw polycarbonate plastic are {{fed into the}} press. A screw forces the liquefied plastic into <b>the</b> <b>mold</b> <b>cavity.</b> The mold closes with a metal stamper {{in contact with the}} disc surface. The plastic is allowed to cool and harden. Once opened, the disc substrate is removed from the mold by a robotic arm, and a 15mm diameter center hole (called a stacking ring) is created. The time it takes to [...] "stamp" [...] one CD is usually two to three seconds.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>mold</b> <b>cavity</b> of {{a casting}} {{does not reflect}} the exact {{dimensions}} of the finished part due to a number of reasons. These modifications to <b>the</b> <b>mold</b> <b>cavity</b> are known as allowances and account for patternmaker's shrinkage, draft, machining, and distortion. In non-expendable processes, these allowances are imparted directly into the permanent mold, but in expendable mold processes they are imparted into the patterns, which later form <b>the</b> <b>mold</b> <b>cavity.</b> Note that for non-expendable molds an allowance is required for the dimensional change of the mold due to heating to operating temperatures.|$|E
5000|$|A {{hot runner}} system is an {{assembly}} of heated components used in plastic injection molds that inject molten plastic into <b>the</b> <b>cavities</b> of <b>the</b> <b>mold.</b> (<b>The</b> <b>cavities</b> are {{the part of}} <b>the</b> <b>mold</b> shaped like <b>the</b> parts to be produced.) ...|$|R
50|$|Internal chills are {{pieces of}} metal that are placed inside <b>the</b> <b>molding</b> <b>cavity.</b> When <b>the</b> cavity is filled, part of the chill will melt and {{ultimately}} {{become part of the}} casting, thus the chill must be the same material as the casting. Note that internal chills will absorb both heat capacity and heat of fusion energy.|$|R
50|$|A Chill is {{an object}} {{used to promote}} {{solidification}} in a specific portion of a metal casting <b>mold.</b> Normally <b>the</b> metal in <b>the</b> <b>mold</b> cools at a certain rate relative to thickness of the casting. When the geometry of <b>the</b> <b>molding</b> <b>cavity</b> prevents directional solidification from occurring naturally, a chill can be strategically placed to help promote it.

5|$|Heated-{{manifold}} direct-injection die casting, {{also known}} as direct-injection die casting or runnerless die casting, is a zinc die casting process where molten zinc is forced through a heated manifold and then through heated mini-nozzles, which lead into <b>the</b> <b>molding</b> <b>cavity.</b> This process has the advantages of lower cost per part, through the reduction of scrap (by the elimination of sprues, gates and runners) and energy conservation, and better surface quality through slower cooling cycles.|$|R
50|$|Zircon sand is a {{compound}} of approximately two-thirds zircon oxide (Zr2O) and one-third silica. It has the highest fusion point of all the base sands at 2600 C, a very low thermal expansion, and a high thermal conductivity. Because of these good properties {{it is commonly used}} when casting alloy steels and other expensive alloys. It is also used as a mold wash (a coating applied to <b>the</b> <b>molding</b> <b>cavity)</b> to improve surface finish. However, it is expensive and not readily available.|$|R
