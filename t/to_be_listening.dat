25|$|Interpretations abound. Perhaps this {{particular}} formation represents a council of some sort—the fifteen other figurines seem <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>listening</b> {{to the red}} granite one, with the celts forming a backdrop. One {{of the most striking}} offerings found at La Venta, the celts in Offering Number 4, depict a person with a ceremonial headdress “flying” and also the maize deity. There appears to be a definite symbolic link here, but it is unclear whether it is tied to the Olmec rudimentary writing system. To the red granite figurine's right, there seems be a line of three figurines filing past him. Another researcher has suggested that the granite figure is an initiate.|$|E
500|$|A mixed {{review was}} given by Andy Gill of The Independent who said that [...] "the vocal editing on 'Start Over' is far too sloppy, {{confirming}} again that a series of individual flourishes doesn't pass muster as a performance." [...] David Amidon of PopMatters also gave a mixed review for [...] "Start Over" [...] and [...] "Countdown" [...] saying that they [...] "just don't seem <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>listening</b> to themselves, and will get by on listenability more than lyrical wizardry if they get by at all." [...] Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone also gave a mixed review for the song, saying: [...] "While the other songs on 4 all have a distinct flavor and give Beyoncé an opportunity {{to try something new}} in some way or another, 'Start Over' just kind of sits there at the middle of the disc not doing much of anything." [...] He also noted that [...] "Start Over" [...] was an [...] "inoffensive ballad that doesn't do much for the record aside from break its momentum at the halfway point." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Trust also criticised Brand's [...] "so-called apology" [...] of 25 October, and {{the staff}} of Chris Moyles's BBC Radio 1 show for also {{breaching}} BBC guidelines for comments by Brand {{in an interview on}} the morning of 21 October at a time when children were likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>listening.</b> The Trust recommended tighter controls for programmes such as Brand's, made by companies owned by their performers. Long-term effects of the controversy would include the setting up of a register of high-risk programmes.|$|E

2500|$|While {{attending}} college in Drury, Barker worked his first [...] "media job", at KTTS-FM Radio, in Springfield. He {{and his wife}} left Springfield and moved to Lake Worth, Florida, and he was news editor and announcer at nearby WWPG 1340 AM in Palm Beach (now WPBR in Lantana). In 1950, Barker moved to California in order {{to pursue a career}} in broadcasting. He was given his own radio show, The Bob Barker Show, which ran for the next six years from Burbank. He was hosting an audience-participation radio show on KNX (AM) in Los Angeles when game show producer Ralph Edwards happened <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>listening</b> and liked Barker's voice and style.|$|E
2500|$|Another long-standing {{tradition}} is the playing of Wagner's [...] "Ride of the Valkyries" [...] at 7:00 each morning during finals {{week with the}} largest, loudest speakers available. The playing of that piece is not allowed {{at any other time}} (except if one happens <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>listening</b> to the entire 14 hours and 5 minutes of The Ring Cycle), and any offender is dragged into the showers to be drenched in cold water fully dressed. The playing of the Ride is such a strong tradition that the music was used during Apollo 17 to awaken Astronaut Harrison Schmitt, a Caltech alumnus. Unfortunately, the tradition arose at different times in different Houses, so Schmitt did not react as expected. Instead, he just became confused.|$|E
2500|$|Brown {{began the}} 2011–12 season {{on a line}} with newly {{acquired}} center Mike Richards, but was shuffled throughout the lineup {{for most of the}} season. He maintained his consistent production, topping 20 goals and 50 points for the fifth-straight year. Along {{with the rest of the}} Kings, however, he struggled to score in the first half of the season. Head Coach Terry Murray was fired midway through the season, and as the Kings fell further out of the playoff picture, they were rumored <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>listening</b> to trade offers for Brown. New coach Darryl Sutter called the Brown-Kopitar tandem [...] "stale" [...] and said Brown was not playing the [...] "straight-line, up-and-down, go-to-the-net, shoot-the-puck, run-over-people" [...] style Brown needed to be effective. Brown's scoring pace picked up amidst the trade rumors, and he scored three goals and an assist in the last game before the NHL trade deadline, a 4–0 win over the Chicago Blackhawks. The Kings held on to Brown, who responded with 11 points in the nine games following the trade deadline. Brown later said that he was playing with [...] "a chip on his shoulder" [...] and [...] "whether those rumors are true or not, they're still out there, it gives you maybe a bit more motivation." [...] With Brown producing and the trade-deadline acquisition of Jeff Carter, the Kings were one of the highest-scoring NHL teams down the stretch and made the playoffs as an eighth seed. After moving up-and-down the lineup for most of the year, Brown found stability playing on the first line with Anže Kopitar and Justin Williams. That line would remain intact throughout the entire 2012 Stanley Cup playoffs.|$|E
