In Switzerland, this particularly holds true for the transition from elementary school to the stratified system of secondary schools which often is determined by school authori-ties. Based on the case study of an elementary school in German Switzerland, this contribution explores accounts to which these decisions are related. Two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounts</b> {{have to be taken}} into consideration: One type refers to a student’s performance. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>account</b> is documented in a rather technical way. It aims at strengthening the procedural rationality of the decision making process. Another <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounts</b> is based on material considerations. It refers to decision effects on individual cases.

50|$|Green {{accounting}} is a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> {{that attempts}} to factor environmental costs into the financial results of operations. It {{has been argued that}} gross domestic product ignores the environment and therefore policymakers need a revised model that incorporates green accounting. The major purpose of green accounting is to help businesses understand and manage the potential quid pro quo between traditional economics goals and environmental goals. It also increases the important information available for analyzing policy issues, especially when those vital pieces of information are often overlooked. Green accounting is said to only ensure weak sustainability, which should be considered as a step toward ultimately a strong sustainability.|$|E

In the 1886 Captain Henry Metcalfe was the first, to proposed a new system for piece work in the machine shop. This system introduced an additional service card for the direct registration of working time spend on the work floor. Metcalfe (1886) explained: A man working on piece work, who has completed a suitable batch of pieces, makes out a ticket to correspond, and gives it with the pieces made to the foreman or inspector. If the work receives the inspector's approval, he punches the service card and forwards it with the other cards. Whatever deductions are necessary, are indicated {{on the face of}} the card, so that it may tell its own story completely. The amount space may be filled, or not, at pleasure; it is for convenience in saving recomputation.Besides making a charge for his labor, it is almost as necessary that the piece workman shall inform the office of how much time he has spent on his work, so as to guide the office in future adjustments of the tarif...... The cards go to the Cost Clerk and are shuffled, first, by names of workman second, by shop-order numbers under each name. The time is then entered in the time book... opposite to the shop-orders on which the man has been employed. This is to enable each workman's wages to be charged to the proper appropriation....|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This paper {{tests the}} {{interaction}} effects {{of education and}} accounting standard type (principles- or rules-based) {{for students who are}} exercising judgement in the face of accountability. Method: An experimental model is employed in which the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> standard is manipulated. The effect of the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> standard is then compared for students in introductory and final year accounting courses. Findings/Results: Our results indicate that the inclusion of indicative, but incomplete rules leads to increased conformance to pressure. Education improves the application of principles but incomplete rules continue to have a detrimental effect, even for students who have effectively completed their university studies. Implications: This research is important in providing guidance to the regulatory bodies as they {{determine the extent to which}} guidance rules should be included in new and revised accounting standards. It is also important to educators as they consider the effect of their teaching on the students’ application of professional judgement...|$|E
