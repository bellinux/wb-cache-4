5|$|According to K. Indrapala, {{cultural}} diffusion, {{rather than}} migration of people, spread the Prakrit and <b>Tamil</b> languages from peninsular India into an existing mesolithic population, centuries before the common era. <b>Tamil</b> Brahmi and Tamil-Prakrit scripts {{were used to}} write the <b>Tamil</b> language during this period on the island.|$|E
5|$|According to {{linguists}} like Bhadriraju Krishnamurti, <b>Tamil,</b> as a Dravidian language, descends from Proto-Dravidian, a Proto-language. Linguistic reconstruction {{suggests that}} Proto-Dravidian was spoken around {{the third millennium}} BC, possibly in the region around the lower Godavari river basin in peninsular India. The material {{evidence suggests that the}} speakers of Proto-Dravidian were of the culture associated with the Neolithic complexes of South India. The next phase in the reconstructed proto-history of <b>Tamil</b> is Proto-South Dravidian. The linguistic evidence suggests that Proto-South Dravidian was spoken around the middle of the second millennium BC, and that proto-Tamil emerged around the 3rd century BC. The earliest epigraphic attestations of <b>Tamil</b> are generally taken to have been written shortly thereafter. Among Indian languages, <b>Tamil</b> has the most ancient non-Sanskritised Indian literature. Scholars categorise the attested history of the language into three periods, Old <b>Tamil</b> (300 BC – AD 700), Middle <b>Tamil</b> (700–1600) and Modern <b>Tamil</b> (1600–present). In November 2007, an excavation at Quseir-al-Qadim revealed Egyptian pottery dating back to first century BC with ancient <b>Tamil</b> Brahmi inscriptions. John Guy states that <b>Tamil</b> was the lingua franca for early maritime traders from India.|$|E
5|$|Sri Lankan <b>Tamils</b> are {{categorised}} {{into three}} subgroups based on regional distribution, dialects, and culture: Negombo <b>Tamils</b> {{from the western}} part of the island, Eastern <b>Tamils</b> from the eastern part, and Jaffna or Northern <b>Tamils</b> from the north.|$|R
50|$|The 1911 Census {{separated}} the <b>Tamils</b> into Ceylon <b>Tamils</b> and Indian <b>Tamils</b> and the Moors into Ceylon Moors and Indian Moors. This {{was due to}} the influx of Indian Labourers, that comprised both Moors and <b>Tamils,</b> in to the plantation regions of Sri Lanka, who had to be distinguished separately.|$|R
50|$|Vietnam {{has a small}} {{minority}} of about 3000 <b>Tamils</b> mostly in the Ho Chi Minh city. Near to Bến Thành Market Dandayuthapani, Subramaniam Swamy & Mariyamman temples are there. Thailand has about 10,000 <b>Tamils</b> living there while there are 1,000 <b>Tamils</b> in Cambodia.|$|R
5|$|In 1578, Portuguese Christian missionaries {{published}} a <b>Tamil</b> prayer book in old <b>Tamil</b> script named 'Thambiraan Vanakkam,' thus making <b>Tamil</b> the first Indian language to be printed and published.

5|$|Potsherds {{with early}} <b>Tamil</b> writing from the 2nd century BCE {{have been found}} from the north in Poonagari, Kilinochchi District to the south in Tissamaharama. They bore several inscriptions, {{including}} a clan name—vela, a name related to velir from ancient <b>Tamil</b> country. Epigraphic evidence shows people identifying themselves as Damelas or Damedas (the Prakrit word for <b>Tamil</b> people) in Anuradhapura, {{the capital city of}} Rajarata the middle kingdom, and other areas of Sri Lanka as early as the 2nd century BCE. Excavations in the area of Tissamaharama in southern Sri Lanka have unearthed locally issued coins, produced between the 2nd century BCE and the 2nd century CE, some of which carry local <b>Tamil</b> personal names written in early <b>Tamil</b> characters, which suggest that local <b>Tamil</b> merchants were present and actively involved in trade along the southern coast of Sri Lanka by the late classical period. Other ancient inscriptions from the period reference a <b>Tamil</b> merchant, the <b>Tamil</b> householder residing in Ilubharata and a <b>Tamil</b> sailor named Karava. Two of the five ancient inscriptions referring to the Damedas (Tamils) are in Periya Pullyakulam in the Vavuniya District, one is in Seruvavila in Trincomalee District, one is in Kuduvil in Ampara District and one is in Anuradhapura. Mention is made in literary sources of <b>Tamil</b> rulers bringing horses to the island in water craft in the second century BCE, most likely arriving at Kudiramalai. Historical records establish that <b>Tamil</b> kingdoms in modern India were closely involved in the island's affairs from about the 2nd century BCE. Kudiramalai, Kandarodai and Vallipuram served as great northern <b>Tamil</b> capitals and emporiums of trade with these kingdoms and the Romans from the 6th–2nd centuries BCE. The archaeological discoveries in these towns and the Manimekhalai, a historical poem, detail how Nāka-Tivu of Nāka-Nadu on the Jaffna Peninsula was a lucrative international market for pearl and conch trading for the <b>Tamil</b> fishermen.|$|E
50|$|Later in 1949 the Ceylon Parliament {{passed the}} Ceylon (Parliamentary Elections) Amendment Act No.48 of 1949 which {{stripped}} the Indian <b>Tamils</b> of their franchise.

5|$|<b>Tamil</b> dialects are {{differentiated}} by the phonological {{changes and}} sound shifts in their evolution from classical or old <b>Tamil</b> (3rd century BCE–7th century CE). The Sri Lankan <b>Tamil</b> dialects form {{a group that}} is distinct from the dialects of the modern <b>Tamil</b> Nadu and Kerala states of India. They are classified into three subgroups: the Jaffna <b>Tamil,</b> the Batticaloa <b>Tamil,</b> and the Negombo <b>Tamil</b> dialects. These dialects are also used by ethnic groups other than Tamils such as the Sinhalese, Moors and Veddhas. <b>Tamil</b> loan words in Sinhala also follow the characteristics of Sri Lankan <b>Tamil</b> dialects.|$|E
5|$|The Negombo <b>Tamil</b> dialect {{is used by}} bilingual {{fishermen}} in the Negombo area, who otherwise identify themselves as Sinhalese. This dialect has undergone considerable convergence with spoken Sinhala. The Batticaloa <b>Tamil</b> dialect is shared between Tamils, Muslims, Veddhas and Portuguese Burghers in the Eastern Province. Batticaloa <b>Tamil</b> dialect is the most literary of all the spoken dialects of <b>Tamil.</b> It has preserved several ancient features, remaining more consistent with the literary norm, {{while at the same}} time developing a few innovations. It also has its own distinctive vocabulary and retains words that are unique to present-day Malayalam, a Dravidian language from Kerala that originated as a dialect of old <b>Tamil</b> around 9th century CE. The <b>Tamil</b> dialect used by residents of the Trincomalee District has many similarities with the Jaffna <b>Tamil</b> dialect.|$|E

5|$|The dialect of the {{district}} of Palakkad in Kerala has {{a large number of}} Malayalam loanwords, has been influenced by Malayalam's syntax and also has a distinctive Malayalam accent. Similarly, <b>Tamil</b> spoken in Kanyakumari District has more unique words and phonetic style than <b>Tamil</b> spoken at other parts of <b>Tamil</b> Nadu. The words and phonetics are so different that a person from Kanyakumari district is easily identifiable by their spoken <b>Tamil.</b> Hebbar and Mandyam dialects, spoken by groups of <b>Tamil</b> Vaishnavites who migrated to Karnataka in the 11th century, retain many features of the Vaishnava paribasai, a special form of <b>Tamil</b> developed in the 9th and 10th centuries that reflect Vaishnavite religious and spiritual values. Several castes have their own sociolects which most members of that caste traditionally used regardless of where they come from. It is often possible to identify a person's caste by their speech. <b>Tamil</b> in Sri Lanka incorporates loan words from Portuguese, Dutch, and English.|$|E
5|$|The {{most widely}} spoken {{language}} is <b>Tamil,</b> {{but there are}} significant numbers of Telugu, Gujarati, Kannada, Malayalam and Hindi speakers.

More than 55% of the epigraphical inscriptions (about 55,000) found by the Archaeological Survey of India are in the <b>Tamil</b> language. <b>Tamil</b> language inscriptions written in Brahmi script have been discovered in Sri Lanka, and on trade goods in Thailand and Egypt.
