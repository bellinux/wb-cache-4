5|$|In season 10, Cristina {{decides to}} accept a job to run {{a state of the}} art clinic in Switzerland. Owen {{supports}} her decision as he realizes no good could come from him asking her to stay, but requests her not to leave him until she has to leave him for good, following which, they both spend two weeks leading to her permanent departure together. While saying her farewell to her colleagues of the last seven years, there is a possible act of terrorism in Seattle, which later turns out <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> gas main explosion. Cristina has a quick but emotional goodbye hug with Derek, Bailey, and Webber, leaves her shares of the hospital to Alex, and dances it out with Meredith one last time to an old favorite song. Owen, however, is busy saving a patient in the O.R., so they share a silent goodbye through the gallery's glass.|$|E

The International Astronomical Union (IAU) states that Charon is considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> satellite of Pluto, but the idea that Charon might be classified a dwarf planet in its own right may be considered at a later date.|$|E

25|$|Gleason (who {{had signed}} a deal in the 1950s that {{included}} a guaranteed $100,000 annual payment for 20 years, even if he never went on the air) wanted The Honeymooners <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> portion of his format, but CBS wanted another season of only The Honeymooners. The network had cancelled a mainstay variety show hosted by Red Skelton and would cancel The Ed Sullivan Show in 1971 because they had become too expensive to produce and attracted, in the executives' opinion, too old an audience. Gleason simply stopped doing the show in 1970 and left CBS when his contract expired.|$|E

At the beginning of the offensive, Allied planners envisioned for the offensive <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> staging point for a deep penetration over the Rur into Germany to the Rhine. After one month of heavy fighting the Americans had barely made it to the Rur. No bridgehead over the river had been made, the Germans still held some portions west of the river and the important Rur dams were still in German hands, threatening any further offensive operations. Even without knowing the upcoming German offensive, Allied planners estimated the earliest date for a large thrust into Germany for mid-January.|$|E

25|$|For the {{original}} series, the specific {{ages of the}} investigators were never revealed, but contextual information indicates that they were likely 13 or 14 years old.

25|$|In the Umm al-kitab, Azazel is {{the first}} {{emanation}} of the high king (original God) and loaned the power of creation from the true God. Therefore he claimed to be an independent God, besides the high king. After that, the high king made a new creation which exceeded the creatures of Azazel. After he remains refusing to confess <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> creature, emanated from the true God, he is banished into lower spheres. Every time he refuses again to accept the new creation Salman, he is banished again into lower regions, until he reaches the earth. The earth is according to the Umm al-kitab created out of the essence of Azazels creation, while humans and lifeforce originated from the heavenly realm. Since Azazel is banished into the material world, he seduces the humans, leads them into his realm and tries to keep human trapped in there. He resembles to the gnostic demiurge.|$|E
25|$|On 1 December 2012 Shefflin {{went off}} injured in Ballyhale Shamrocks' defeat by Oulart the Ballagh {{in the provincial}} club championship. While the problem was {{initially}} thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> badly sprained ankle it was later revealed to be ligament damage and a break in his left mid-foot. This injury ruled him out of Kilkenny's successful National league campaign. A damaged metatarsal delayed his recovery resulting in him missing Kilkenny's opening championship games. Shefflin made his return to hurling when he was introduced {{for the last five}} minutes of Kilkenny's 0-20 to 1-14 qualifier defeat of Tipperary. He was included on the starting fifteen for Kilkenny's subsequent All-Ireland quarter-final against Cork. Just before half time Shefflin received a second yellow card and was red carded {{for the first time in}} his championship career. Kilkenny went on to lose the game by 0-19 to 0-14. After an appeal to the Central Hearings Committee Shefflin's red card was subsequently rescinded.|$|E

25|$|Velator Quay and the {{surrounding}} area is used as a mooring for small boats. In 2006 Braunton council blocked vehicular access to the quay as it was found to be in danger of collapse. An engineering survey was conducted on the quay in 2010, by consultants Bolgar Sykes, as the council were hoping to make it more of an amenity. The survey revealed several possible options for repair, ranging in cost from £80,000 to £400,000. The limited budget available to the council for such work meant that only basic repairs were considered. A subsequent report by Peter Lord, one of the parish counsellors, recommended that demolition of the quay would be the best long-term option, with the provision of a slipway to assist boat owners. The quay is widely held to be a free port, this status having been awarded to Barnstaple seamen who fought against the Spanish Armada. However, the report highlighted {{the fact that this is}} likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> local legend, as the quay was not constructed until 300 years after the event.|$|E

The idea was to make the songs better by arranging them the way we did; to make it more even as an album."

500|$|Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique {{gave the}} episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four, {{calling it a}} disappointment. Vitaris heavily criticized Mulder's line: [...] "I'm not a psychologist"—reportedly an ad lib from Duchovny himself—noting that it {{undermines}} established continuity within the series including the character's background in psychology. Tom Kessenich, in his 2002 book Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files, praises the installment, saying, [...] "Place a devil in the plot and I'll follow you {{to see what you}} can cook up.... I enjoyed this tale of a devil looking <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> normal dad immensely." [...] In his view the episode showed a return to the earlier horror-based narratives the series was known for; though he praises the casting of Campbell, he writes that moments between Mulder and Scully are lacking.|$|E

500|$|The same year, DiCaprio {{reunited with}} Kate Winslet to film the drama Revolutionary Road (2008), {{directed}} by Winslet's then-husband Sam Mendes. As both actors had {{been reluctant to}} make romantic films similar to Titanic, it was Winslet who suggested that both should work with her on a film adaptation of the 1961 novel {{of the same name}} by Richard Yates after reading the script by Justin Haythe, knowing that plot had little in common with the 1997 blockbuster. Once DiCaprio agreed to do the film, it went almost immediately into production. He noted that he saw his character as [...] "unheroic" [...] and [...] "slightly cowardly" [...] and that he was [...] "willing <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> product of his environment." [...] Portraying a couple in a failing marriage in the 1950s, DiCaprio and Winslet watched period videos promoting life in the suburbs to prepare themselves for [...] Revolutionary Road, which eventually earned them favorable reviews.

Many of the players in the NHL during this period failed to stick with their teams once the war ended and the stars returned. However, Kennedy was one of the exceptions and he quickly became one of the team's greatest stars and a favourite of the fans. [...] "Come on, Teeder!"

[...] Popular videogame director Hideo Kojima has referred to the movie frequently as an influence on his work, in particular the Metal Gear series. Solid Snake is partially influenced by Snake Plissken. In Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty Snake actually uses the alias [...] "Pliskin" [...] to hide his real identity during most of the game. J. J. Abrams, producer of the 2008 film Cloverfield, mentioned that a scene in his film, which shows the head of the Statue of Liberty crashing into a New York street, was inspired by the poster for Escape from New York.
