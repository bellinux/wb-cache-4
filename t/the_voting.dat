5|$|To defeat <b>the</b> <b>Voting</b> Rights Act, McCulloch {{introduced}} an alternative bill, H.R. 7896. It {{would have allowed}} the Attorney General to appoint federal registrars after receiving 25 serious complaints of discrimination about a jurisdiction, {{and it would have}} imposed a nationwide ban on literacy tests for persons who could prove they attained a sixth-grade education. McCulloch's bill was co-sponsored by House Minority Leader Gerald Ford (R-MI) and supported by Southern Democrats as an alternative to <b>the</b> <b>Voting</b> Rights Act. The Johnson administration viewed H.R. 7896 as a serious threat to passing <b>the</b> <b>Voting</b> Rights Act. However, support for H.R. 7896 dissipated after William M. Tuck (D-VA) publicly said he preferred H.R. 7896 because <b>the</b> <b>Voting</b> Rights Act would legitimately ensure that African Americans could vote. His statement alienated most supporters of H.R. 7896, and the bill failed on the House floor by a 171-248 vote on July 9. Later that night, the House passed <b>the</b> <b>Voting</b> Rights Act by a 333-85 vote (Democrats 221-61, Republicans 112-24).|$|E

5|$|Also in Oregon v. Mitchell, the Supreme Court {{addressed}} {{the constitutionality of}} various other provisions relating to voter qualifications and prerequisites to voting. The Court upheld Section 202, which prohibits any state or local jurisdiction from requiring people to live in their borders for longer than 30 days before allowing them to vote in a presidential election. Additionally, the Court upheld the provision lowering the minimum voting age to 18 in federal elections, but it held that Congress exceeded its power by lowering <b>the</b> <b>voting</b> age to 18 in state elections; this precipitated the ratification of the Twenty-sixth Amendment the following year, which lowered <b>the</b> <b>voting</b> age in all elections to 18. The Court was deeply divided in Oregon v. Mitchell, {{and a majority of}} justices did not agree on a rationale for the holding.|$|E
