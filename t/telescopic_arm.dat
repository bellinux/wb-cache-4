25|$|Construction {{commenced}} on March 8, 2005. Three major {{construction sites}} had been established, at Malmö C, Triangeln and Holma/Hyllie. By {{the end of}} 2006, another construction site had been opened in Lockarp, where connecting tracks to Ystad and Trelleborg were being built. The underground station at Malmö C was built in a 0.8km long open trench which was then covered. To minimize traffic disruption, the extensive and time-consuming work was done in stages. In order to build Triangeln station, two 25 m deep vertical shafts were dug at {{the northern and southern}} part of the site, and the station was then milled out of the rock by a roadheader — a machine equipped with a rotating cutter head on a <b>telescopic</b> <b>arm.</b> The rock was then lined with concrete elements to finish the structure. Hyllie Station was built in an approximately 7 m deep shaft; the vault that covers the station is a distinct landmark in the Hyllie development area. The tunnel was mostly bored by two tunnel boring machines (TBMs). Underground drilling commenced in November 2006 and February 2007, respectively. On 25 March 2008, one of the TBMs achieved breakthrough at Malmö C, followed by the second TBM on April 21. Work was completed in December 2010, six months ahead of schedule.|$|E
2500|$|The {{second day}} had 54,000 spectators, but was {{affected}} by rain and bad light. Mike Hendrick took the second over and pulled a hamstring muscle with his fifth ball, tried a sixth and then left, injured beyond help {{for the rest of}} the series. England were left with only one fast bowler and Bob Willis gave an extended spell of seven overs and Derek Underwood was given the ball after only six overs, but strangely Fred Titmus was not brought on until after lunch, and then replaced Underwood instead of forming a spin twin partnership. Though Wally Edwards was clearly struggling Ian Redpath was happily playing the depleted attack, but when the umpires gave them the light at 3:13 pm the Australian batsmen walked off. At 3:30 pm a couple of hoaxers dressed up as umpires and [...] "sold the crowd a pup" [...] before they were chased off. Play resumed for two overs at 4:00 pm until a Willis bouncer and light rain convinced the umpires to stop play and the day ended with Australia 63/0. Willis stormed in the next morning and Edwards attempted a forehand smash against a rising ball straight to Denness at mid-off. Ian Chappell's had was still smarting so Greg Chappell came in and tried to cut Willis through the gully, but the ball lifted and moved in and the ball was taken by the <b>telescopic</b> <b>arm</b> of Tony Greig at second slip. At the other end Titmus (2/43) floated a ball up to Ross Edwards that he edged to Colin Cowdrey at first slip and Australia were 68/3. Doug Walters hit a chancy 36 with the stationary Redpath, whose 55 took 242 minutes to make when Greig (2/63) dismissed them both to bring Ian Chappell and Rod Marsh together at a precarious 126/5. These two added 47 runs when Willis took the new ball and caught the captain lbw for 36, 173/6. Marsh (44) and the free swinging Max Walker (30) pulled Australia up to 237 when they were both caught by Alan Knott, a leaping dive to dismiss Marsh off Titmus and a simple snick to take Walker off Willis. Lillee survived a lbw appeal from Titmus, Ashley Mallett was run out by substitute Chris Old for a duck and Willis bowled Thomson and Australia were all out for 241, one run behind England. Willis took 5/61, his first 5 wicket haul in Tests.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} the system control architecture of a large, orange harvesting robot. This robot has two independent electrically driven <b>telescopic</b> <b>arms</b> {{mounted on a}} common platform which is itself held by a large hydraulic arm. This arm, in turn, is mounted on a tracked vehicle. The <b>telescopic</b> <b>arms</b> have cameras within the end-effectors, {{that are used to}} detect and to measure the position and distance to fruit within the canopy of a tree. Most of the development and control software was implemented using the matrix-based Virtual Machine Language (VML) [11]. This language was designed to implement neural networks, and has been extended and enhanced for robotic applications and the particular low level control requirements of the hardware. Three features of the VML language are central to this project. First, the language includes a wide range of matrix arithmetic operators which facilitate the implementation of image processing, coordinate transformation, neural networks, and data transfers.

They are equipped with a single mechanical rod-mounted eye which protrudes from a rotating dome, a directed energy weapon and a <b>telescopic</b> <b>arm.</b> Usually the arm is fitted with a manipulating device resembling a sink plunger. This item is shown in various episodes to be capable of holding people and objects, seemingly using a powerful vacuum. The weapon is depicted as having a variable output which can paralyse, stun or kill most life forms, disintegrate other Daleks and destroy buildings and spacecraft.|$|E
40|$|The {{preliminary}} {{design of a}} multipurpose engineering machine on the wheeled chassis was presented in the paper. The machine meets a series of specific requirements such as: off-road prowess, ability of movement with high speed on hard-surface roads, limited weight and dimensions at the maintaining of great hoisting capacity. These requirements were adjusted to the present character of warfare {{and that is why}} the machine construction deviates from classic working machines being used in the civil sector. The meeting of defined requirements required the development of innovative methods. The solution aiming at the increasing the stability of the machine by the application of using a sliding drive unit was described. As a result of that, the increased capacity and efficiency of mined materials were obtained. Additionally, the system of two <b>telescopic</b> <b>arms</b> was applied, so that the efficiency was improved by the shortening of machine working cycles and it is possible to change the length of arms as well as both <b>telescopic</b> <b>arms</b> were placed on the rotating body achieving in such a manner the big workspace for arms.

Each flamethrower has a weather station that prevents the device from firing in unsuitable weather conditions, {{in order to prevent}} damage to the castle.|$|R
5000|$|A {{hydraulic}} manifold is a manifold that regulates fluid flow between pumps and actuators and other components in a hydraulic system. It {{is like a}} switchboard in an electrical circuit because it lets the operator control how much fluid flows between which components of a hydraulic machinery. For example, in a backhoe loader a manifold turns on or shuts off or diverts flow to the <b>telescopic</b> <b>arms</b> of the front bucket and the back bucket. The manifold {{is connected to the}} levers in the operator's cabin which the operator uses to achieve the desired manifold behaviour.|$|R

50|$|The {{following}} {{account of}} the British high mast in its fully developed state at Cardington, and its operation, is abridged from Masefield.Mooring masts were developed {{to act as a}} safe open harbour to which airships could be moored or unmoored in any weather, and at which they could receive (hydrogen or helium) gas, fuel, stores and payload.The Cardington mast, completed in 1926, was an eight sided steel girder structure, 200 ft high, tapering from 70 ft diameter at ground level to 26 ft at the passenger platform, 170 ft from the ground. Above the passenger platform was the 30 ft of the conical housing for the mooring gear. A lower platform 142 ft above the ground accommodated searchlights and signalling gear in a gallery 4 ft wide.The top platform, at the height of 170 ft, from which passengers embarked and disembarked to and from the airships, was 40 ft in diameter and encircled by a heavy parapet. The top rail of the parapet formed a track on which a gangway, let down from the airship, ran on wheels to give freedom for the airship to move around the tower as it swung with the wind. An electric passenger lift ran up the centre of the tower, encircled by a stairway to provide foot access.The upper portion of the tower, from the passenger platform upwards, was a circular steel turret surmounted by a truncated cone with its top 23 ft above the passenger platform. A three-part <b>telescopic</b> <b>arm,</b> mounted on gimbals, projected through an opening at the top, free to swing from the vertical in any direction up to 30 degrees of movement. The top of the arm consisted of a bell-shaped cup mounted to rotate on ball bearings.A cable extended through the bell-mouth which, linked to a cable dropped from airship to be moored, enabled the nose of the airship to be drawn down until a cone on the nose locked home into the cup and so secured the airship to the tower. The <b>telescopic</b> <b>arm</b> was then centred, locked in the vertical position, and made free to rotate on a vertical axis so the airship could swing, nose to tower, in any direction of the wind.In the machinery house {{at the base of the}} tower three steam-driven winches operated the hauling gear through drums 5 ft in diameter to give cable hauling speeds of 50 feet a minute.|$|E
