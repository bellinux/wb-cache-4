5|$|In {{algebraic}} geometry and theoretical physics, mirror symmetry {{is a relationship}} between geometric objects called Calabi–Yau manifolds. The term refers <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> where two Calabi–Yau manifolds look very different geometrically but are nevertheless equivalent when employed as extra dimensions of string theory.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{the term}} duality refers <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> where two {{seemingly}} different physical systems {{turn out to}} be equivalent in a nontrivial way. If two theories are related by a duality, it means that one theory can be transformed in some way so that it ends up looking just like the other theory. The two theories are then said to be dual to one another under the transformation. Put differently, the two theories are mathematically different descriptions of the same phenomena.|$|E
5|$|The mirror {{symmetry}} {{relationship is}} a particular example of what physicists call a duality. In general, the term duality refers <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> where two seemingly different physical theories {{turn out to be}} equivalent in a nontrivial way. If one theory can be transformed so it looks just like another theory, the two are said to be dual under that transformation. Put differently, the two theories are mathematically different descriptions of the same phenomena. Such dualities {{play an important role in}} modern physics, especially in string theory.|$|E

5|$|Youth {{spend too}} much time {{learning}} what their teachers think is important, irrelevant from what the youth may already know. The manager of learning value allows the youth to learn and practice his skills in situations simulating real life. The Manager of Learning methodology first exposes the learner <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> to help both the learner and the leader assess his current state of knowledge. This causes the learner to internalize a need to improve his knowledge or skills. This is followed by a period of teaching or exposure during which the participant improves from their base-line knowledge. The participant then gets a chance to apply what he has learned, and lastly, evaluates his performance improvement.|$|E
5|$|For decades, {{research}} on the Polish Underground State was restricted, largely because the communist People's Republic of Poland {{did not wish to}} fully acknowledge the role of the non-communist resistance. During the first postwar Stalinist years, efforts to explore this topic were regarded as dangerous, bordering on illegal. Research into the events occurring in the Soviet-annexed territories in the 1939–1941 period was particularly difficult. The limited research devoted to the Underground State that did take place was done mainly by Polish émigré historians living in the West. The communist state downplayed the importance of the non-communist resistance movements, while the communist movement (Armia Ludowa) was emphasized as being of primary importance; in fact, the opposite was true. The absence of research by Polish scholars, along with obstacles presented to foreign scholars seeking access to source material in communist Poland, contributed <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> in which there was virtually no discussion by Western scholars of one of Europe's largest resistance movements—the non-communist Polish resistance movement. The bulk of Western research centred on the much smaller French Resistance (la Résistance).|$|E
5|$|In November 2010, the Accident Investigation Board Norway {{criticized the}} braking system of the trains. During 2009, there were 83 {{incidents}} where trains with locked wheels slid down steep sections of track. The Accident Investigation Board found that the metro had conducted insufficient testing of {{the braking system}} on steep slippery lines, had not adjusted the brakes satisfactorily, and had not maintained the trains and tracks sufficiently. In December 2010, Oslo Vognselskap ordered another 32 three-car units, bringing the total order up to 115 three-car units. The last trains will be delivered in 2012. There was political disagreement regarding the final purchase, with the Liberal Party and socialist opposition securing a majority for the purchase, while the right-winged parties voted to order 19 units. The extra trains {{will make it possible}} to run all lines except the Holmenkollen Line (Line 1) with six-car lines, compared <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> with only three-car trains on the Lambertseter Line, the Ring Line and the Kolsås Line (lines 4 and 6) would only use three-car trains.|$|E

25|$|Nursing {{shortage}} refers <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> {{where the}} demand for nursing professionals, such as Registered Nurses (RNs), exceeds the supply—locally (e.g., within a health care facility), nationally or globally.

25|$|According to Professor David C. Kraemer, its {{incorporation}} into Jewish law codes {{stems from the}} confusion of rabbis over the duration of menstrual cycles. He writes that contradictory statements in rabbinic literature led <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> whereby the extra seven days became mandatory. However, this longer period is in contradiction to early Mishnaic and Talmudic statements. On a related point, {{on the origin of}} the custom to wait extra days, Kraemer opines that the stringency initiated in Talmudic times was thought out as a means of birth control.|$|E

Claire Powell writes that Nevill felt {{it would be inappropriate}} to send the boy to a local school for the village children, when he might one day have to employ them on the farm. This led, writes Powell, <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> in which Bamber felt increasingly alienated from his family and their life in the countryside, as did his sister, who was also sent to boarding school.|$|E
25|$|Over time, the iqtaʿ {{system was}} expanded, and {{increasingly}} larger areas of kharaj (taxable lands) were appropriated as iqtaʿ lands {{in order to}} meet the fiscal needs of the Mamluk military institution, namely payment of Mamluk officers and their subordinates. The Mamluk state resolved to increase allotments by dispersing an individual emir's iqtaʿat over several provinces and for brief terms. However, this led <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> where the iqtaʿ holders neglected the administrative oversight, maintenance and infrastructure of their iqtaʿat, while concentrating solely on collecting revenues, thereby resulting in less productivity of the iqtaʿat.|$|E
