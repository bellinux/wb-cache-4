5|$|In 2013, the US Government Accountability Office said a {{shortage}} of lithium-7 critical to the operation of 65 out of 100 American nuclear reactors “places their ability to continue to provide electricity at some risk”. The problem stems from the decline of US nuclear infrastructure. The equipment needed to separate lithium-6 from lithium-7 is mostly a cold war leftover. The US shut down most of this machinery in 1963, when it had a huge surplus of separated lithium, mostly consumed during the twentieth century. <b>The</b> <b>report</b> <b>said</b> it would take five years and $10 million to $12 million to reestablish the ability to separate lithium-6 from lithium-7.|$|E
5|$|O'Connor {{wrote that}} there had been a {{hardening}} of police attitudes, with officers believing that proportionality meant reciprocity. The deployment of officers in riot gear had become a routine response to lawful protest, largely the result of an ignorance of the law and a lack of leadership from the Home Office and police chiefs. Officers were being trained to use their riot shields as weapons. Police forces across the country differed in their training, the equipment they had access to, and their understanding of the law. The failure to understand the relevant legislation was in part due to its complexity, <b>the</b> <b>report</b> <b>said,</b> with 90 amendments to the Public Order Act passed since 1986.|$|E
