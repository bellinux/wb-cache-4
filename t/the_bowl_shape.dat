5000|$|Glaciers, {{typically}} {{forming in}} drainages {{on the sides}} of a mountain, develop bowl-shaped basins called cirques (sometimes called corries or cwms). Cirque glaciers have rotational sliding that abrades the floor of the basin more than walls and that causes <b>the</b> <b>bowl</b> <b>shape</b> to form. As cirques are formed by glaciation in an alpine environment, the headwall and ridges between parallel glaciers called arêtes become more steep and defined. This occurs due to freeze/thaw and mass wasting beneath the ice surface. It is widely held [...] that a common cause for headwall steepening and extension headward is the crevasses known as bergschrund that occur between the moving ice and the headwall. Plucking and shattering can be seen here by those exploring the crevasses. A cirque is exposed when the glacier that created it recedes. When three or more of these cirques converge on a central point, they create a pyramid-shaped peak with steep walls. These horns are a common shape for mountain tops in highly glaciated areas. The number of faces of a horn depends on the number of cirques involved {{in the formation of the}} peak: three to four is most common. Horns with more than four faces include the Weissmies and the Mönch. A peak with four symmetrical faces is called a Matterhorn (after the Matterhorn) ...|$|E
5000|$|The Australian {{kangaroo}} industry {{produces a}} range of meat and leather products from animals harvested from the wild under strict government controlled Management Plans. These ensure the harvest is sustainable and humane.A wide cross section of Australian ecologists support the kangaroo industry as being both sustainable and environmentally wise. [...] Many argue kangaroos, which are native to Australia, are a more environmentally friendly livestock option than introduced sheep and cattle. [...] The two most important facets of kangaroos' better ecological fit than European agricultural animals relate to their adaptation to Australia's aridity. Kangaroos have small chest development and so require less water to breathe than placental mammals, which usually must expand a diaphragm. This means they lose more moisture in respiration. Kangaroos just make small pants while immobile and in motion expand and contract their lungs effectively using their leg muscles. The belly flops up and down, contracting and expanding the lungs respectively. Also, the kangaroo's paw is softer and does not compact the ground as hoofed cattle and sheep do. Instead, its hopping leaves very small bowl-shaped cuts in the surface of even dry clay soil, which let native grass seeds carried on the wind settle into them. <b>The</b> <b>bowl</b> <b>shape</b> concentrates any moisture that may fall into it into a wet point that the grass seed can use to germinate. Thus, kangaroos deplete the water table at a slower rate than cattle or sheep and would even be viable {{in the absence of}} any bore water at all. The ecological arguments for kangaroos replacing sheep and cattle as arid land livestock are compelling, though they must be set against objections of kangaroos' lack of domestication and breeding rate.Kangaroos are eaten in most states.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this research work {{is to improve the}} in-cylinder air flow for facilitate better mixing and ultimately achieve complete combustion. From the literature it is revealed that <b>the</b> <b>bowl</b> <b>shape</b> of the piston has influence on creating effective swirl, tumble, and cross tumble motions during intake and initial stages of compression stroke. Different types of combustion chambers have been designed by keeping the same bowl volume to maintain the constant compression ratio and to ensure that the improvement is only due to geometric parameters such as bulge diameter, lip distance, and bowl to bore diameter ratio. Simulation work is carried out using ANSYS Fluent 14. 5 computational fluid dynamics tool. The influence of these parameters on in-cylinder flow was also studied in this paper. The values of swirl, tumble, and cross tumble were calculated.

40|$|Modern diesel cars, {{fitted with}} state-of- the-art {{aftertreatment}} systems, {{have the capability}} to emit extremely low levels of pollutant species at the tailpipe. However, diesel aftertreatment systems can represent a significant cost, packaging and maintenance requirement. Reducing engine-out emissions {{in order to reduce the}} scale of the aftertreatment system is therefore a high priority research topic. Engine-out emissions from diesel engines are, to a significant degree, dependent on the detail of fuel/air interactions that occur in-cylinder, both during the injection and combustion events and also due to the induced air motion in and around the bowl prior to injection. In this paper the effects of two different piston bowl shapes are investigated. Experiments are performed in a single-cylinder engine fitted with a production cylinder head and fuel injector in order to quantify the effect of <b>the</b> <b>bowl</b> <b>shape</b> and spray targeting—varied by varying the injector nozzle tip protrusion—on emissions and fuel consumption. Multi-dimensional CFD modelling is used to detail the effect of these geometry changes on the in-cylinder flow and fuel/air mixing processes thereby guiding the interpretation and understanding of the experimental results. The results suggest that improvements in engine-out emissions, as well as fuel consumption, may be obtained from current diesel engines by the careful matching of combustion system geometry with fuel injection hardware and strategy, and that an integrated approach with experimental and numerical studies working in parallel is essential to maximise these benefits. </p...|$|E
40|$|Vaporization {{of liquid}} {{droplets}} containing particles {{has been studied}} extensively for its applications in combustion, thermal coating, ink-jet printing, spray cooling, drug delivery, and surface patterning. Droplets containing solid particles show a preferential solute-migration during drying process. Recently we carried out experiments with vaporizing droplet suspended in an acoustic levitator. In this work, we present detailed study of a laser irradiated droplet containing nanosilica particles. Infrared and High speed imaging of the heating process for different concentrations of nanosilica revealed an interesting solute migration pattern. Further investigation with Particle Image Velocimetry shows presence of strong recirculation within the levitated droplet. It also reveals that with increasing viscosity of the liquid {{the strength of this}} recirculation decreases. Due to the droplets rotation about the levitator axis, a centrifugal force also dominated the flow field within the droplet. High speed imaging shows that initial stage of heating is dominated by sharper diameter reduction. At the end of this stage the droplet takes a bowl shape. Next stage, which is termed as structure formation shows different characteristics for higher and lower concentrations. For nanosilica concentration of less than 1. 3 %, <b>the</b> <b>bowl</b> <b>shape</b> remains unaltered with further heating. On the other hand, for concentration greater than 1. 9 %, due to stronger centrifugal effect than recirculation, the particles migrate towards the equator plane creating horizontal ring structure. The horizontal ring very soon starts oscillating about the levitator axis. This creates an imbalance of forces resulting in reorientation of the ring. Thus a vertical ring is created...|$|E
40|$|Magnetotransport {{properties}} of modulation-doped p-type Si 1 -xGex/Si and Sil_xGex/Sil_yGey heterostructures were studied, in {{the magnetic field}} range 0 - 12 T, and in the temperature range 0. 35 - 300 K. The experimental data within the classical regime have been analysed by mobility spectrum analysis, in order to separate the influences of different parallel conduction paths. A new method of mobility spectrum analysis has been developed by the author, based {{on the concept of}} maximum-entropy, and this computation has been shown to overcome several drawbacks or limitations of previous mobility spectrum methods of calculation. The data have also been analysed by Beck&Anderson's analysis and the multicarrier fitting method for comparison. Analysis of the magnetic-field-dependent resistivity tensors reveals a two-dimensional hole gas (2 DHG) in the Si/SiGe/Si quantum well, carriers in the boron-doped cap layer, and an unknown electron-like carrier. The carrier density of the 2 DHG can either remain constant (z = 0. 1), increase (x = 0. 13), or decrease (x 0. 2), with increasing temperatures. Differences in the temperature dependences are partly attributed to different growth conditions. A decreasing carrier density with increase in temperatures may indicate the presence of acceptor-like defect states near the valence band edge of the SiGe channel. The mobility of the 2 DHG between 100 - 300 K has the form AT-"Y and 'Y has <b>the</b> <b>bowl</b> <b>shape</b> with the minimum at xf"V 0. 25 - 0. 3.
