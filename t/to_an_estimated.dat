A massive decline in sea otter populations in the Aleutian Islands accounts {{for most of the}} change; the cause of this decline is not known, although orca predation is suspected. The sea otter population in Prince William Sound was also hit hard by the Exxon Valdez oil spill, which killed thousands of sea otters in 1989.|$|E

5|$|In the Aleutian Islands, {{a massive}} and {{unexpected}} disappearance of sea otters {{has occurred in}} recent decades.

The most widely accepted, but still controversial, hypothesis is that killer whales have been eating the otters. The pattern of disappearances {{is consistent with a}} rise in predation, but there has been no direct evidence of orcas preying on sea otters to any significant extent.|$|E
