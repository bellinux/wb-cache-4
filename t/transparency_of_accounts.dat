Our results, although being surrounded by some margin of uncertainty, are quite cautionary. The <b>transparency</b> <b>of</b> the fiscal <b>accounts</b> seems to be insufficient and the size of off-budget operations is not negligible. Moreover, we have been witnessing a rapid increase in the cyclically-adjusted deficits, and Czech fiscal policy exhibits mainly pro-cyclical features. Looking into the more distant future reveals that our current fiscal system is extremely vulnerable to demographic pressures, even by international comparison.

40|$|The pricing of infrastructure, {{such as this}} of commercially {{competing}} ports, is one of {{the most}} controversial aspects of the global economy of the 21 st century.

40|$|The project {{addresses}} transnational corperations {{and their}} affairs regarding the Zambian copper mines after the privatization from 1997 - 2000. As {{we have had}} prejustices concerning the transnational corperations huge profit compared to the zambian state tax income on cobber, the project is drafted with a critical hermeneutic perspective. To understand the greater picture a selection of three different views on the issue have been chosen. The three perspectives include a liberalistic and marxistic economic point of view combined with Joseph Stiglitz’ theory as a critical mainstream economist. The positioning of the three perspectives greatly varies in a scale related context. The project is therefore formed throughout a dialectic point of view {{due to the fact}} that we analyze the issue in the different contexts to perceive a new and holistic understanding compared to our former view. The liberalistic analysis concludes that Zambia should have a positive perspective on the transnational corperations because of the economic growth it contributes. The marxistic analysis however sees the companies as a factor only amplifying the inequality between first and third world countries already present. Our middle perspective, Joseph Stiglitz, argues that the transnational cooperations investing in the zambian cobber mines can be an advantage under the conditions that national as well as international regulations og accounting rules are introduced. The three perspectives are then compared and discussed whether which from our point of view is the right decision for the Zambian government. Due to our dialectic approach and thereby achievement of new knowledge we can conclude that the situation is more complex than first assumed. Therefore is it not appropriate to postulate that transnational corporations have a purely negative influence. By contrary we now consider, based on our analyses and discussion, transnational corporations as a potential win for Zambia due to capital inflows and new technology. This however demands an accounting transparency from the transnational cooperations to avoid transfer mis-pricing. This is due to the low tax income the cobber provides for the Zambian government and therefore a national or international regulation on for example the <b>transparency</b> <b>of</b> <b>accounting</b> would greatly increase the Zambian income on cobber taxes. Furthermore a reduction or abolition of EU’s protective tariffs could provide Zambia with the opportunity of upscaling their industrial sector and thereby retain more parts of the value chain within theirs frontiers...|$|R

Tax havens, {{also known as}} "offshore financial centers" or "international financial centers," are countries and territories that offer low tax rates and favorable regulatory policies to foreign investors. For example, tax havens typically tax inbound investment at zero or very low rates and further encourage investment with telecommunications and transportation facilities, other business infrastructure, favorable legal environments, and limited bureaucratic hurdles to starting new firms. Tax havens are small; most are islands; {{all but a few}} have populations below one million; and they have above-average incomes. The United States and other higher-tax countries frequently express concerns over how tax havens may affect their economies. Do they erode domestic tax collections; attract economic activity away from higher-tax countries; facilitate criminal activities; or reduce the <b>transparency</b> <b>of</b> financial <b>accounts</b> and so impede the smooth operation and regulation of legal and financial systems around the world? Do they contribute to excessive international tax competition? These concerns are plausible, albeit often founded on anecdotal rather than systematic evidence.

ABSTRACT: This paper examined the impact of bank consolidation on credit access and availability to small and medium scale enterprises (SME’s) in Nigeria for the period 1999 - 2012. The main objectives are (1) To examine whether or not bank consolidation in Nigeria brought about increased lending to SME’s. (2) Determine the level of lending risk to SME’s. (3) Determine {{if there is any}} significant difference between SME’s financing in pre and post consolidation in 2005. Data on commercial bank loans to SME’s as percentage of total credit was the main variable used and were obtained from CBN Statistical Bulletin 2012. The mean, standard deviation descriptive statistics and the t-test tool were used for the analysis. The study found out that bank consolidation in Nigeria led to a drastic reduction of SME’s financing to less than one percent (0. 37 %) on average. The lending riskiness of banks to SME’s in post consolidation reduced while there is no significant difference between SME’s financing in pre and post consolidation era. The results however go contrary to the much taunted belief that bank consolidation will lead to increased SME’s financing in Nigeria. The study recommends improved <b>transparency</b> <b>of</b> SME’s <b>accounting</b> and reporting <b>of</b> their activities, banks should relax some of the stringent lending measures to SME’s while government should design policies that should group SME’s in such a manner for proper identification and planning (specifically according to trade and industry) so that it can guarantee credit facilities and ensure prompt repaymen...|$|R
