5|$|Arsenal, the {{defending}} champions, entered the match as favourites, but went behind early when Brian Stein scored. Luton's disciplined approach, {{coupled with a}} strong performance by Dibble, contained Arsenal to few chances throughout the game. The holders equalised and {{took the lead in}} quick succession through Martin Hayes and Alan Smith, but failed to seal the win when Nigel Winterburn missed a penalty. A revitalised Luton staged a late comeback; Caesar's failed clearance led <b>to</b> <b>Danny</b> Wilson equalising, and in the 90th minute, Brian Stein scored the winner after poor defending from Arsenal.|$|E
5|$|Young {{returned}} to former club Altrincham on 7 February 2011 on an emergency loan {{until the end}} of 2010–11. His first appearance after returning to the club came in a 2–1 defeat away to Kidderminster on 12 February 2011. After making 11 appearances and scoring 1 goal for Altrincham, Young {{returned to}} York after being recalled on 20 April 2011 due to an injury <b>to</b> <b>Danny</b> Parslow. He did not play following his return and finished the season with 12 appearances and 1 goal for York.|$|E
5|$|Humber nearly {{achieved}} a no hitter for the 2011 Chicago White Sox twice. On April 25, 2011, {{in the sixth}} start of his career, he took a no-hitter into the seventh inning against the New York Yankees at Yankee Stadium but, with one out, Alex Rodriguez singled up the middle, leaving Humber to finish with seven scoreless innings. Later that year he took a no-hitter into the sixth inning against the Washington Nationals on June 26, but ended up earning a 2–1 loss when he surrendered a seventh inning home run <b>to</b> <b>Danny</b> Espinosa. In that contest, Jerry Hairston, Jr. broke up the no-hitter leading off the sixth after Roger Bernadina earned a hit by pitch {{to break up the}} perfect game in the fourth.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} {{possession}} of the second half, the Terrapins were forced to punt after a run attempt for loss, a false start penalty, and two incomplete passes. The Maryland defense took the field and stopped a Clemson drive. On the first play of their second series, wide receiver Darrius Heyward-Bey executed a reverse to gain 76yards before being stopped at the Clemson four-yard line. This set up a short Chris Turner touchdown pass to receiver Torrey Smith, and shifted the game's momentum in favor of Maryland. In the fourth quarter, three completions <b>to</b> <b>Danny</b> Oquendo {{set the stage for}} a one-yard rush into the endzone by Da'Rel Scott. In the second half, the Maryland defense allowed Clemson just 31rushing yards and zeropoints, compared with 204rushing yards and 17points in the first half.|$|E
5|$|Shark, {{now working}} for Maxie, {{suggests}} <b>to</b> <b>Danny</b> they beat up Primont {{to help his}} father. One night when Mr. Fisher leaves the store dressed in Primont's hat and coat (lent due to a rainstorm), Shark recognizes him, but decides to mug him anyway, as that would be even better for Maxie's purposes. Danny's father is so badly injured that he needs expensive surgery; so Maxie pays for a specialist to perform it. Maxie later blackmails Danny into signing with him by threatening to tell his father about {{his involvement in the}} mugging, and then does it anyway. Outraged, Danny pummels Maxie for the betrayal and helps Ronnie escape him.|$|E
5|$|The {{second quarter}} began with Tennessee facing third down and 11 from its 9-yard line. The first {{play of the}} quarter ended in a two-yard loss for Tennessee, and the Volunteers punted after their second {{consecutive}} three-and-out. Starting at Tennessee's 46-yard line after the punt, Tech quarterback Taylor completed a 42-yard pass <b>to</b> <b>Danny</b> Coale on the Hokies' first play of the quarter, giving Virginia Tech a first down at the Tennessee 4-yard line. There, however, Tennessee's defense stiffened. Tech was stopped for no gain on consecutive plays, but on third down the Volunteers committed a facemask penalty, giving Virginia Tech a first down at the 1-yard line. Even then, it took Ryan Williams two plays to gain the momentum needed to cross the goal line for Virginia Tech's second touchdown. The score and subsequent extra point gave the Hokies a 14-0 lead with 11:56 remaining before halftime.|$|E

5|$|At {{work one}} morning, Danny rescues Ronnie (Jones) from her abusive date. After a taxi ride <b>to</b> <b>Danny's</b> high school, Ronnie kisses him. <b>Danny</b> {{responds}} <b>to</b> witnessing schoolmates' teasing by kissing Ronnie {{back and then}} punching {{one of them in}} the face when he makes a teasing remark. Danny's reaction summons him to the principal's office; where Miss Pearson (Helene Hatch), his teacher, tells Principal Evans (Raymond Bailey) that Danny will not graduate because of his poor attitude. Mr. Evans is sympathetic, but powerless <b>to</b> help; so <b>Danny</b> decides <b>to</b> drop out of school to find work, against the wishes of his father, who tries <b>to</b> convince <b>Danny</b> <b>to</b> stay in school.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, Mr. Fisher finds {{employment}} as a pharmacist {{in a local}} drug store; but his boss, Mr. Primont (Gavin Gordon)—who reluctantly hired Mr. Fisher after his boss made him do so—constantly demeans Mr. Fisher obviously out of retaliation, much <b>to</b> <b>Danny's</b> embarrassment. That situation {{makes it easier for}} <b>Danny</b> <b>to</b> go against his father's wishes and accept Charlie's job offer. Danny does; and when he becomes a hit at the King Creole, Maxie tries <b>to</b> hire him. <b>Danny</b> declines his offer out of loyalty to Charlie.|$|R
5|$|Virginia Tech's {{second drive}} {{of the half}} began at its 41-yard line after a 31-yard kickoff return by Wilson. On the first play of the drive, Taylor was sacked for a 13-yard loss. He made good the lost yardage on the next play, however, {{completing}} a 42-yard throw <b>to</b> <b>Danny</b> Coale. From the Stanford 40-yard line, Taylor gained fiveyards on a running play, then attempted a long pass downfield. The throw was intercepted by Stanford's Delano Howell at the Cardinal 3-yard line, returning Luck and the Stanford offense to the field. Luck needed only two plays to drive {{the length of the}} field and score a touchdown. A 56-yard run by Stepfan Taylor was followed by a 41-yard touchdown pass to Coby Fleener, and the following extra point kick was good, making the score 26–12 with 5:49 remaining.|$|E
5|$|Dominic and Daniel {{head for}} a {{restaurant}} in the Italian North End of Boston to tell Angel's mother of her son's death. Dominic gets {{a job as a}} cook in the restaurant and changes his surname to Del Popolo (Angel's mother's surname) to hide from Carl.

He also meets Katie Callahan, a radical art student, whom he agrees to marry. Katie has one mission in life: to make potential Vietnam War draftees fathers, thus enabling them to apply for paternity deferment. Daniel and Katie have a son Joe, but when Joe is 2, Katie leaves Daniel to find another young man to rescue from the war. Daniel moves to Iowa with Joe, where he enrolls in the Iowa Writers' Workshop. He also changes his name <b>to</b> <b>Danny</b> Angel to hide from Carl, and uses this nom de plume to publish his novels. After graduating from the Writers' Workshop in 1967, Danny and Joe move to Putney, Vermont.|$|E

They then began a feud with Simon and Swinger, whom {{they lost to}} at November to Remember, but {{defeated}} at Massacre on 34th Street. They competed in ECW for approximately six months, until the promotion closed in January 2001 and were on the company's final pay-per-view Guilty as Charged, where they suffered a loss to Jerry Lynn and Cyrus. After the closure of ECW, {{they returned to the}} independent circuit, where, on February 3, 2001, the Bad Street Boys defeated Rick Michaels and David Young to become the NWA World Tag Team Champions, a championship that they held for two weeks. They won the MCW Tag Team Championship for the second time on November 3 by defeating Earl the Pearl and Rich Myers, and later won the Virginia Championship Wrestling Tag Team Championship on December 1, 2001.|$|E

5|$|The {{heavy rains}} caused {{two people to}} drown in Charlotte. A girl drowned after being swept into a creek, and a woman drowned while in her car. Also in North Carolina, {{tropical}} rains related <b>to</b> <b>Danny</b> caused a CSX train to derail from its trestle into Little Sugar Creek, spilling about 2,500 gallons (9,500L) of diesel and therefore forcing a nearby public housing development to be evacuated. Sustained tropical-storm force winds affected Martha's Vineyard, Nantucket Island, and parts of Cape Cod, {{in addition to the}} coastal waters from the entrance of Buzzards Bay to the south and east of Cape Cod. Only minor damage occurred, despite these strong winds, which were experienced primarily in southeastern Massachusetts. The minor damage included localized flooding, power outages, downed tree limbs, and lost boats. A suspension of ferry service to Nantucket Island occurred for most of July 25, with a shorter suspension happening on the service to Martha's Vineyard. No significant coastal flooding affected the region, although a storm shelter was opened on Nantucket Island to host a Boy Scout group camping there. Danny was the fifth tropical cyclone to affect Southern New England in the 20th century during the month of July.|$|E
5|$|Bosh {{remained}} the Heat's starting center during the 2012–13 season. On February 15, 2013, Bosh was picked as an All-Star starter over the injured Rajon Rondo by coach Erik Spoelstra. The Heat achieved the league's best record and {{swept through the}} first round of the playoffs against the Milwaukee Bucks before defeating the Chicago Bulls in five games, with Bosh scoring 20 points to go with 19 rebounds in a crucial Game 3 win in Chicago. Bosh averaged 12.1 points per game throughout the playoffs, as the Heat advanced to the NBA Finals to face the San Antonio Spurs following a grueling seven-game series against Indiana. The Heat and Spurs split the first two games before the Spurs blew out Miami in Game 3 to take a 2–1 series lead. In Game 4, Bosh scored 20 points and grabbed 13 rebounds to complement Wade's 32 points and James' 33 points to bolster the Heat's win, tying the series. San Antonio would bounce back in Game 5 to force the Heat to win the final two games at home. In the final seconds of Game 6, James missed a three-pointer, and Bosh grabbed the offensive rebound and found a wide open Ray Allen in the corner. Allen hit the shot to tie the game, and in overtime the Heat had a three-point lead with seconds left. San Antonio inbounded the ball <b>to</b> <b>Danny</b> Green, who attempted a corner three, but Green's shot was blocked by Bosh to secure the Heat's victory. Bosh was held scoreless in Game 7 by Tim Duncan, but the Heat still won the game and the series to claim their second consecutive NBA Championship.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech {{dominated}} {{the majority of}} the first half. In the first quarter, Virginia Tech's third-string kicker Justin Myer kicked a 37-yard field goal, which was the only scoring play of the quarter. Myer added a 43-yard field goal in the second quarter. At the end of the half, however, Denard Robinson threw a 45-yard touchdown pass to Junior Hemingway to give Michigan a 7–6 lead and on the ensuing kickoff, Michigan's J.B. Fitzgerald forced a fumble, which Michigan recovered. Michigan's Brendan Gibbons kicked a 24-yard field goal as time expired. In the third quarter, Michigan scored another touchdown on a Denard Robinson to Junior Hemingway pass, this time from 18 yards out. This scoring drive followed an interception by linebacker Frank Clark. Virginia Tech responded with another Justin Myer field goal, this time from 36 yards away. In the fourth quarter, Virginia Tech's quarterback Logan Thomas trimmed Michigan's lead to two points, and then promptly tied the game throwing a successful two-point conversion to Marcus Davis. Michigan responded with a 39-yard Brendan Gibbons field goal, but Virginia Tech tied the game with two seconds remaining via a 25-yard field goal by Myer. In overtime, Virginia Tech seemingly scored the go-ahead touchdown on a Logan Thomas <b>to</b> <b>Danny</b> Coale pass, but video review overturned the play. The next play saw Myer miss a 37-yard field goal. Michigan received the ball and saw Gibbons kick the game-winning 37-yard field goal.|$|E
