5|$|In 1894, American {{astronomer}} William W. Campbell {{found that}} the spectrum of Mars was identical to the spectrum of the Moon, throwing doubt on the burgeoning theory that <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>of</b> Mars {{is similar to that}} of the Earth. Previous detections of water in <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>of</b> Mars were explained by unfavorable conditions, and Campbell determined that the water signature came entirely from the Earth's atmosphere. Although he agreed that the ice caps did indicate there was water in the atmosphere, he did not believe the caps were sufficiently large to allow the water vapor to be detected. At the time, Campbell's results were considered controversial and were criticized by members of the astronomical community, but they were confirmed by American astronomer Walter S. Adams in 1925.|$|E

40|$|We use {{thermochemical}} equilibrium calculations {{to model}} iron, magnesium, and silicon chemistry in <b>the</b> <b>atmospheres</b> <b>of</b> giant planets, brown dwarfs, extrasolar giant planets (EGPs), and low-mass stars. The behavior of individual Fe-, Mg-, and Si-bearing gases and condensates is determined {{as a function}} of temperature, pressure, and metallicity. Our equilibrium results are thus independent of any particular model <b>atmosphere.</b> <b>The</b> condensation <b>of</b> Fe metal strongly affects iron chemistry by efficiently removing Fe-bearing species from the gas phase. Monatomic Fe is the most abundant Fe-bearing gas throughout <b>the</b> <b>atmospheres</b> <b>of</b> EGPs and L dwarfs, and in <b>the</b> deep <b>atmospheres</b> <b>of</b> giant planets and T dwarfs. Mg- and Si-bearing gases are effectively removed from <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere</b> by forsterite (Mg 2 SiO 4) and enstatite (MgSiO 3) cloud formation. Monatomic Mg is the dominant magnesium gas throughout <b>the</b> <b>atmospheres</b> <b>of</b> EGPs and L dwarfs and in <b>the</b> deep <b>atmospheres</b> <b>of</b> giant planets and T dwarfs. Silicon monoxide (SiO) is the most abundant Si-bearing gas in <b>the</b> deep <b>atmospheres</b> <b>of</b> brown dwarfs and EGPs, whereas SiH 4 is dominant in <b>the</b> deep <b>atmosphere</b> <b>of</b> Jupiter and other gas giant planets.

5|$|At the University of Leipzig in 1862–64, German {{astronomer}} Johann K. F. Zöllner {{developed a}} custom photometer {{to measure the}} reflectivity of the Moon, planets and bright stars. For Mars, he derived an albedo of 0.27. Between 1877 and 1893, German astronomers Gustav Müller and Paul Kempf observed Mars using Zöllner's photometer. They found a small phase coefficient—the variation in reflectivity with angle—indicating that the surface of Mars is smooth and without large irregularities. In 1867, French astronomer Pierre Janssen and British astronomer William Huggins used spectroscopes to examine <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>of</b> Mars. Both compared the optical spectrum of Mars {{to that of the}} Moon. As the spectrum of the latter did not display absorption lines of water, they believed they had detected the presence of water vapor in <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>of</b> Mars.
