On November 27, 2016, {{it was announced}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> season would premiere on January 9, 2017 on TV Tokyo and its affiliates. The staff from the Gintama° anime series returned to reprise their roles in this season.|$|E
5|$|A {{review of}} their {{performance}} at The Ritz in New York on January 6, 1989 highlights the good shape and musicianship of the band, but remarks <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> songs were played with considerably less enthusiasm {{than the rest of}} the show. Although the band continued to tour regularly, the songs from Imaginos had already disappeared from their shows by the end of 1989, never to be performed live again.|$|E
5|$|After {{the repeal}} of the Stamp Act, Parliament took a {{different}} approach to raising revenue, passing the 1767 Townshend Acts, which established new duties on various imports and strengthened the customs agency by creating the American Customs Board. The British government believed that a more efficient customs system was necessary because many colonial American merchants had been smuggling. Smugglers violated the Navigation Acts by trading with ports outside of the British Empire and avoiding import taxes. Parliament hoped <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> system would reduce smuggling and generate revenue for the government.|$|E

50|$|Reviews {{of cameras}} <b>that</b> compare <b>the</b> Venus IV engine to Venus III suggest <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>newer</b> engine is better, {{but the issue}} of noise {{reduction}} techniques losing detail, though improved, remains.|$|R
50|$|In 1962, the school's {{enrollment}} {{had increased}} {{and it was}} necessary to add a brand new junior high building. By the 1971-1972 school year, it was decided <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>newer</b> junior high building would become <b>the</b> <b>new</b> high school and vice versa.|$|R
5|$|Although {{civilian}} evacuations {{had begun}} in January for the Gulf Coast and San Antonio de Béxar, the Texian military was either on the offensive or standing firm until the smaller Gulf Coast skirmishes happened in February. Houston was now facing a choice of whether to retreat to {{a safe place to}} train his new army, or to meet the enemy head-on immediately. He was wary of trying to defend a fixed position – the debacle at the Alamo had shown <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> Texian government was unable to provide sufficient provisions or reinforcements.|$|E
5|$|Competition {{from new}} superpredators, such as macropredatory sperm whales which {{appeared}} in the Miocene, and killer whales and great white sharks in the Pliocene, may have also contributed to the decline and extinction of megalodon. Fossil records indicate <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> whale-eating cetaceans commonly occurred at high latitudes during the Pliocene, indicating that they could cope with the increasingly prevalent cold water temperatures; but they also occurred in the tropics (e.g., Orcinus sp. in South Africa).|$|E
5|$|Conspiracy theorists {{concerned}} with surveillance abuse believe <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> World Order is being {{implemented by the}} cult of intelligence {{at the core of}} the surveillance-industrial complex through mass surveillance and the use of Social Security numbers, the bar-coding of retail goods with Universal Product Code markings, and, most recently, RFID tagging by microchip implants.|$|E
2500|$|Following his death, the University of South Australia {{announced}} on 21 June 2013 <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>newest</b> building at its City West campus, {{to be opened}} in 2014, would be named the [...] "Jeffrey Smart Building".|$|R
25|$|Already, in 1908, Arthur Moritz Schoenflies {{found in}} the second part of his report on set theory, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>newer</b> theory of ordered sets (i.e., that which {{occurred}} after Cantor's extensions thereof) was almost exclusively due to Hausdorff.|$|R
2500|$|CNN {{reported}} {{the program would}} be relaunched by the private firm, Net Exchange, which helped create it, but <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>newer</b> version [...] "will not include any securities based on forecasts of violent events such as assassinations or terror attacks".|$|R
5|$|Conspiracy theorists {{generally}} speculate <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> World Order {{is being}} implemented gradually, citing {{the formation of}} the U.S. Federal Reserve System in 1913; the League of Nations in 1919; the International Monetary Fund in 1944; the United Nations in 1945; the World Bank in 1945; the World Health Organization in 1948; the European Union and the euro currency in 1993; the World Trade Organization in 1998; the African Union in 2002; and the Union of South American Nations in 2008 as major milestones.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{anticipated}} efficiency gains and development work, Airbus announced <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> winglets {{will not be}} offered to customers, claiming that {{the weight of the}} modifications required would negate any aerodynamic benefits. Instead, on 17 December 2008, Airbus announced it was to begin flight testing an existing blended winglet design developed by Aviation Partners Inc. as part of an A320 modernisation programme using the A320 prototype.|$|E
5|$|During {{construction}} on 10 February 1959, John Tonkin, then the Deputy Premier and Minister for Works, announced <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> bridge {{was to be}} named the Golden West Bridge. However, Golden West was also the name for a popular soft drink; the proposal encountered scorn from commentators and was quietly dropped.|$|E
50|$|Goodman {{was arrested}} again, along with Andy Coulson, on 8 July 2011 after <b>new</b> revelations of <b>the</b> phone hacking were made public. It was {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>News</b> of <b>the</b> World would end its 168-year publication history on 10 July 2011.|$|R
40|$|Fractures of long {{bones are}} {{commonly}} treated with intramedullary (IM) nails {{and they have}} been shown to have a very high success rate. Recently we have concerns with the use of <b>the</b> <b>newer</b> IM nailing sys-tems, that uses longer cross screws, which have been developed with variation in implant designs. We be-lieve <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>newer</b> implants provide less fracture stability, due to decreased stiffness of the IM nailing system. The aim {{of this study was to}} biomechanically determine the influence of the length of cross screw on the stiffness of the IM nailing system, using a composite model. Our test results confirmed our sus-picion <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>newer</b> IM nailing system using longer cross screw-length is less stiff than traditional nailing systems using shorter cross screw length, during axial loading...|$|R
50|$|The Migration Assistant {{does not}} {{transfer}} {{the operating system}} of the old computer to <b>the</b> <b>new</b> one. Similarly, applications and utilities bundled by Apple with the operating system (e.g. Safari) are not transferred, based on <b>the</b> assumption <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>newer</b> machine has <b>the</b> same or <b>newer</b> version already installed. However, settings for these applications (e.g. bookmarks) are transferred.|$|R
5|$|Early {{on in the}} project, it was {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> stations would feature platform screen doors. The stations (along with the new South Ferry station on the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line and the three Phase 1 Second Avenue Subway stations in the Upper East Side) would include special air-cooling systems to reduce the temperature along platforms. Due to its depth, the extension has ventilation towers, rather than the ventilation grates ubiquitous {{in the rest of}} the subway system.|$|E
5|$|Following {{contentious}} {{battles in}} several states, the proposed Constitution reached that nine state ratification plateau in June 1788. On September 13, 1788, the Articles of Confederation Congress certified <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> Constitution had been ratified {{by more than}} enough states for the new system to be implemented and directed the new government to meet in New York City on the first Wednesday in March the following year. On March 4, 1789, the new frame of government came into force with eleven of the thirteen states participating.|$|E
5|$|For its {{coverage}} of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, some (such as Ed Koch) have claimed that the paper is pro-Palestinian, while others (such as As`ad AbuKhalil) have insisted that it is pro-Israel. The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy, by political science professors John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt, alleges <b>that</b> <b>The</b> <b>New</b> York Times sometimes criticizes Israeli policies but is not even-handed and is generally pro-Israel. On the other hand, the Simon Wiesenthal Center has criticized The New York Times for printing cartoons regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that were claimed to be anti-Semitic.|$|E
25|$|By February 2013 {{the company}} was hiring staff for the {{production}} of <b>the</b> aircraft. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> price at this point was US$1.96M. In April 2013 Meng Xiangkai, Chairman of CAIGA, the owner of Cirrus, announced <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>newest</b> prototype version of the SF50 would be rolled out during 2013 and that certification flight testing would commence in 2014.|$|R
50|$|It was {{announced}} on April 12, 2013 <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>News,</b> Forecast, Check Mii Out, Everybody Votes, and Nintendo Channels would close permanently on June 28, 2013, as Nintendo terminated the WiiConnect24 service which these channels required, and shifted their resources to their next-generation projects.|$|R

5|$|From {{the start}} of 2010 to November 2014, 43 {{hospitals}} in rural areas closed. Critics claimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> law caused these hospitals to close. Many of these rural hospitals were built using funds from the 1946 Hill–Burton Act, to increase access to medical care in rural areas. Some of these hospitals reopened as other medical facilities, but {{only a small number}} operated emergency rooms (ER) or urgent care centers.|$|E
5|$|Further {{disagreements}} existed {{about the}} design and character of the new building. Facsimile reconstruction, while feasible, was not seriously contemplated. There was a general agreement <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> building should also have a cultural as well as commercial purpose. While the Jewish Community of Zagreb envisioned a modern design reminiscent of the original synagogue, the Bet Israel advocated building {{a replica of the}} original synagogue's facade, perceiving it as having a powerful symbolism. Opinions of architects, urban planners, and art historians were also divided along similar lines.|$|E
5|$|George Went Hensley (May 2, 1881 – July 25, 1955) was an American Pentecostal {{minister}} {{best known}} for popularizing the practice of snake handling. A native of rural Appalachia, Hensley experienced a religious conversion around 1910: {{on the basis of}} his interpretation of scripture, he came to believe <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> Testament commanded all Christians to handle venomous snakes.|$|E

5|$|In 1844, the community, perpetually {{struggling}} financially, drafted {{an entirely}} new constitution and committed to following more closely the Fourierist model. Not everyone at the community supported the transition, and many left. Many were disappointed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>new,</b> more structured daily routine de-emphasized the carefree leisure time {{that had been a}} trademark. Ripley himself became a celebrity proponent of Fourierism and organized conventions throughout New England to discuss the community.|$|E
5|$|In 1884, Harrison and Gresham {{competed for}} {{influence}} at the 1884 Republican National Convention; the delegation ended up supporting James G. Blaine, the eventual nominee. In the Senate, Harrison achieved passage of his Dependent Pension Bill, {{only to see}} it vetoed by President Grover Cleveland. His efforts to further the admission of new western states were stymied by Democrats, who feared <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> states would elect Republicans to Congress.|$|E
