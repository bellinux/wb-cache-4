5|$|Darko Pančev got {{his prize}} for 1990–91 season later, only in 2006, {{following}} a protest from Cyprus where a player supposedly scored 40 goals (though the official topscorers for the season, Suad Beširević and Panayiotis Xiourouppas, are listed with 19 goals each). Due to <b>this</b> <b>affair,</b> France Football {{decided to make}} the competition unofficial.|$|E
5|$|In 1799, the {{independent}} Republic of Lucca came under French influence and adopted as its flag a horizontal tricolour with green uppermost; this lasted until 1801.

50|$|<b>This</b> <b>affair's</b> unfortunate outcome {{may also}} have further soured and alienated Joseph II's mother, the Empress Maria Theresa. The Empress had 16 children, {{including}} 5 sons ("Archdukes"), and she was an important relative of {{a fair number of}} monarchs and aristocrats who might have been in a position to give Wolfgang a permanent job.|$|R
5|$|Encouraged by Protestant supporters, {{including}} several in the Cathedral chapter, he declared he would retain the electorate, and in December 1582, he formally announced his conversion to the reformed {{faith and the}} parity of Calvinism with Catholicism in the Electorate and archdiocese of Cologne. The marriage with Agnes was celebrated on 4February 1583, and afterward Gebhard remained in possession of the see. <b>This</b> <b>affair</b> created a stir in the Holy Roman Empire.|$|E
5|$|In late 882, {{the young}} Leo, Basil's second son and heir {{after the death}} of his elder brother Constantine in 879, was wedded to Theophano, a member of the Martinakes family. The bride was the choice of empress Eudokia Ingerina, and did not please Leo, who instead {{preferred}} the company of Zoe Zaoutzaina, the beautiful daughter of Stylianos Zaoutzes. Whether Zoe was actually his mistress is uncertain; Leo himself strenuously denied this in later accounts. At that point, Zaoutzes held the post of mikros hetaireiarches, i.e. commander of the junior regiment of the Byzantine emperor's mercenary bodyguard, the hetaireia. Leo's relations with his father Basil were always strained, and when Theophano informed him of <b>this</b> <b>affair,</b> Basil reportedly became enraged, beat Leo until he bled, and married Zoe off to one Theodore Gouzouniates. Furthermore, in 883, Leo was denounced as plotting against Basil and was imprisoned; it was only through the intervention of patriarch Photios and Stylianos Zaoutzes that he was not also blinded. <b>This</b> <b>affair</b> does not seem to have hurt Zaoutzes's own standing with Basil or his career, for by the end of Basil's reign he was protospatharios and megas hetaireiarches (senior commander of the hetaireia).|$|E

5|$|According to Nicol, Tagaris was {{probably}} {{born in the}} 1320s, while other sources like the Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium and the Prosopographisches Lexikon der Palaiologenzeit put it later, around the year 1340. His parents arranged his marriage {{at the age of}} 14 or 15, but soon he abandoned his wife and left Constantinople to become a monk in Palestine. After a while he returned to Constantinople, where he quickly became embroiled in scandal: he claimed that an icon in his possession had miraculous properties, and made money out of gullible believers. <b>This</b> <b>affair</b> scandalized his family, but Patriarch Kallistos I declined to take action against him. It was not until the patriarch went on a visit to Serbia in July 1363 that his locum tenens, the hieromonk Dorotheos, confiscated the icon and forced Paul to return to Palestine.|$|E
5|$|The loyalist force {{marched to}} the Hippodrome, where they drove away most of John's supporters. They then entered the palace, where they found scarce {{opposition}} from John's attendants. John was captured after a short chase in the palace and his head was immediately cut off, to be displayed {{the next morning at}} the Forum of Constantine, while his body was displayed at Blachernae. A similar fate befell many of his supporters that night, while others were captured and tortured to extract the names of all the conspirators. Alexios Mourtzouphlos was likely put in prison for his role in <b>this</b> <b>affair</b> (he is known to have been in prison in 1203), and the two Komnenos brothers, Alexios and David, seem to have fled the capital immediately after the coup's failure.|$|E
5|$|By March 1806, the French {{squadron}} under Contre-Admiral Charles-Alexandre Durand Linois {{had been}} operating against British {{trade in the}} Indian Ocean and elsewhere {{since the start of}} the Napoleonic Wars in 1803. Despatched to India before war was declared, Linois left Brest in March 1803, sailing to the South China Sea in an effort to intercept the China Fleet, a huge merchant convoy from Canton to Britain via Madras that carried goods worth in excess of £8 million. On 15 February 1804, Linois encountered the China Fleet, which due to delays with the squadron in India had sailed without its Royal Navy escort. The loss of this undefended convoy could have devastated the British economy and been the highlight of Linois's career, but instead the French admiral was fooled by a ruse of the convoy commander, Commodore Nathaniel Dance. Dance pretended that some of his East Indiaman merchant ships were disguised ships of the line and engaged Linois at long range, dissuading the French commander from pressing the attack. Dance's merchant ships even pursued the fleeing French squadron for some distance, before resuming their original course. <b>This</b> <b>affair,</b> known as the Battle of Pulo Aura, was a humiliation for Linois and provoked Napoleon's fury when the Emperor was informed of it by the governor of Île de France, Charles Decaen.|$|E

25|$|Sergius’ {{ties with}} the family of Theophylact were made even closer, at least {{according}} to rumour, by Sergius’ supposed affair with Theophylact’s daughter, Marozia. This relationship was promoted by Marozia’s mother, Theodora, and the result of <b>this</b> <b>affair</b> was a male child who in time became Pope John XI (931–935). The only source of <b>this</b> <b>affair</b> is the chronicler Liutprand of Cremona, writing some 50 years after the events of Sergius’ pontificate. Neither Auxilius of Naples nor Eugenius Vulgarius, both of whom were exact contemporaries of Sergius, and both of whom were hostile towards Sergius for his attacks on Formosus, mention this allegation at all.|$|E
