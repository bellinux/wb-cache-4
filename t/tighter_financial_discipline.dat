5000|$|The Primitives were {{becoming}} {{more like the}} Wesleyan Methodists. The same forces that promoted schism in Wesleyan Methodism operated on Primitive Methodism. Their leaders became more conservative as they got older. They showed signs of a move away from revivalism and the leadership became intent on imposing greater discipline on the membership. They experienced some schisms in the 1820s. These Primitive Methodist troubles were blamed on the admission of [...] "improper" [...] preachers and [...] "questionable characters". The sentiment of this explanation is similar to Bunting's comments that [...] "schism from the body will be a less evil than schism in it". The problems in the 1820s were often related to money matters. A decision by the conference of 1826 to impose <b>tighter</b> <b>financial</b> <b>discipline</b> on the circuits led to an exodus of members and thirty itinerants. The movement became more geared towards consolidation through greater organisation. In 1821 preachers were called upon to record their activities and in 1822 a preachers' manual was published. Preachers now had guidelines, an element of accountability had been introduced, and the leadership had asserted the connexional accounts had priority over spreading the word.|$|E

500|$|The RPF {{carried out}} a major {{fundraising}} programme, spearheaded by financial commissioner Aloisia Inyumba from an office in Kampala. They received donations from Tutsi exiles around the world, {{as well as from}} some businessmen within Rwanda who had fallen out with the government. The sums involved were not enormous, but with <b>tight</b> <b>financial</b> <b>discipline</b> and a leadership willing to lead frugal lives, the RPF was able to grow its operational capability. It obtained its weapons and ammunition from a variety of sources, including the open market, taking advantage of an excess of redundant weaponry {{at the end of the}} Cold War. It is likely they also received weaponry from officers in the Ugandan army; according to GÃ©rard Prunier, Ugandans who had fought with Kagame in the Bush War remained loyal to him and passed weaponry to the RPF in a clandestine manner. Museveni likely knew of this, but was able to claim ignorance when dealing with the international community. Museveni later said that [...] "faced with [...] fait accompli situation by our Rwandan brothers," [...] Uganda went [...] "to help the RPF, materially, so that they are not defeated because that would have been detrimental to the Tutsi people of Rwanda and would not have been good for Uganda's stability." ...|$|R
40|$|The Serbian banking sector {{after four}} years of {{transition}} is almost completely different from the situation before. Last year the growth rate of GDP in the sector was among the highest in neighborhood and even among all transition countries. Ten big acquisitions of domestic banks, with majority stake possessed by the state or private persons or legal entities, were realized with results that 2 / 3 of the sector now belong to foreign investors. Necessary prerequisite for transition was really independent role of National bank in definition and realization of monetary policy and supervision of banking sector. Transition of the banking sector was realized step by step threw three lines of activities. Firstly, restructuring and rehabilitation of existed banks. This painful step included closing of 18 banks and merging of small, week banks. National bank introduced <b>tight</b> <b>financial</b> <b>discipline</b> and international banking standard. Secondly, financial market was opened for foreign investors. At the beginning monetary authorities gave several license for green field investments, but later on foreign banks could penetrate the market threw acquisition of domestic banks, only. Thirdly, recently the state started privatization of majority stake in domestic banks owned by the state. This process will be finished by the end of 2006. At the same time domestic private shareholders recognized their interest to sell majority stake in several others banks. Although Serbian banks improved their efficiency and increased total amount of credit lines and assets for several times, there is still room for further transition steps. Among others, the law on banks and other financial institutions has to be amended, especially regarding stronger supervisory role of National bank, higher responsibility for bank management and auditors, as well. Important role for National bank would be also transition of insurance market, which is now at the very beginning phases of overall reform. Serbian banking sector with linkages to banks from EU countries and full introduction of international banking standards can be solid basis for European integration of Serbian economy. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper, {{based on}} a large sample of mid-sized {{manufacturing}} firms in the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland, examines differences {{in the behavior of}} state and private companies in short-term credit markets in transition economies. The study offers three main conclusions. First, we find that state enterprises represent a higher credit risk both because of their inferior economic performance and because of their lesser willingness or propensity to meet their payment obligations. Second, the brunt of the state firms' lower creditworthiness is borne by their state creditors, as state enterprises deflect the higher risk away from private creditors. Third, this transfer of risks from private to state creditors is possible because state creditors impose significantly "softer" <b>financial</b> <b>discipline</b> on state firms. Inasmuch as such softness may reflect unwillingness to accept a likely demise {{of a large number of}} state firms that are in principle capable of successful restructuring through ownership changes, we conclude that the imposition of <b>financial</b> <b>discipline</b> is not sufficient to remedy ownership and governance-related deficiencies of corporate performance.

As the extended model {{does not have any}} fixed point, we use computer-simulation to examine the dynamic behaviour of the model.

Further on, we demonstrate that the partial shortage of <b>financial</b> <b>discipline</b> leads to wrong investment decisions which slow the process of capital accumulation. The macroeconomic path directed to the collapse can be reversed by strengthening the <b>financial</b> <b>discipline,</b> keeping down corruption, modification of preferences in investment policy or exogenous technological change. ...|$|R
