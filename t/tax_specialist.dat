40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to analyse the perception of <b>tax</b> <b>specialists</b> on the application of PIS/Pasep, Cofins and EFD-Contributions legislation in Tax Accounting. The study uses the hypothetical-deductive method, descriptive, bibliographical and field research and data collection through a questionnaire. The results show that <b>tax</b> <b>specialists</b> exhibited agreement bias that the tax obligations are impaired by excessive rules in the legislation (83 %); by difficulty of interpreting the law (80 %); by dispersion of information (80 %); by legislation complexity (94 %); by the law frequently updating (98 %); by the variety of schemes, tax rates and special situations (78 %); by legal acts with immediate enforcement (80 %) and by the input concept (83 %). Regarding the EFD-contributions, the study records agreement bias to the statement that compliance with the tax obligation will require more knowledge (80 %); it will take longer (74 %) and it will be more complex (87 %). Additionally, the study registers agreement bias that the legislation complexity creates additional costs for entities (85 %) and to the statement that expansion of the input concept by Administrative Board of Tax Appeals - CARF facilitates the fulfillment of the tax (63 %). The bibliographical research was confirmed in the field research by the perception of <b>tax</b> <b>specialists,</b> indicating urgent need to review the structure of the legislation related to PIS/Pasep and Cofins to make it fair to taxpayers and convenient for application in Tax Accounting...|$|R

50|$|Many governments tax {{individuals}} and/or enterprises on income. Such {{systems of}} taxation vary widely, {{and there are}} no broad general rules. These variations create the potential for double taxation (where the same income is taxed by different countries) and no taxation (where income is not taxed by any country). Income tax systems may impose tax on local income only or on worldwide income. Generally, where worldwide income is taxed, reductions of tax or foreign credits are provided for taxes paid to other jurisdictions. Limits are almost universally imposed on such credits. Multinational corporations usually employ international <b>tax</b> <b>specialists,</b> a specialty among both lawyers and accountants, to decrease their worldwide tax liabilities.|$|R
