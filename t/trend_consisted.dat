However, in 1965, the United States passed new immigration reforms allowing {{a new wave of}} Arabs to immigrate. This new group of Arab immigrants was demographically similar to those that immigrated during the past 20 years; however, this wave differed largely in its scope and in their reasons for immigrating. Between 1967 and 2003 some 757,626 Arabs came to the United States, nearly eleven times the number of immigrants during the second wave. Moreover, during this time, in addition to increasingly regular conflict between Israel and its Arab neighbors, this era was marked by widespread [...] "intra-Arab warfare" [...] and a general increase in religious, ethnic and sectarian tensions in the region.

40|$|This study aims to {{show the}} impact {{resulting}} from signing of Euro-Mediterranean Agreements {{and the establishment of}} free Euro-Mediterranean trade zone on inter-Arab trade, and the establishment of a major Arab free trade zone. International economic relations at the present time are characterized by a large interrelationship and interdependency, encouraging most of the countries in the world; whether developed or developing, to form economic blocs and groupings; whether in a bilateral or multilateral way. At the level of Arab countries, {{in the context of their}} efforts to keep pace with developments occurring in the world, they proceeded to go two different ways, in order to achieve their economic development and to accompany the course of the rapid change in the global economy. The first trend focused on its complementary efforts with each other; whereas the establishment of an Arab free trade zone is considered as a logical entrance to gain access to higher degrees of integration among Arab countries in order to maintain their interests in front of international economic blocs. The second <b>trend</b> <b>consisted</b> in the signature of cooperation and partnerships agreements with various economic coalitions; the most important was the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership Agreement, between the Arab countries and the European Union. It is worthy to note that this latter initiated the launch and design of all agreements with Arab countries, following the objectives that suited it best, regardless of integrative interests of the Arab countries; this, because Arab countries perform their negotiations individually with the European Union, therefore the EU gets more bargaining power to ensure its superiority as a single entity facing dispersed countries. In this study, we exposed the project of Euro-Mediterranean partnership and {{to show the}} difference between it and the Middle Eastern project. We discussed as well the project of Arab economic integration and the march of the joint Arab action the theoretical bases of the Arab foreign and intra-trade and the efforts made in this important sector. Finally, this study focused on the establishment of a free Euro-Mediterranean trade zone and its impact on inter-Arab trade zone. The establishment of a free trade Euro Mediterranean zone, which includes four Arab Mediterranean countries (Egypt, Jordan, Morocco and Tunisia) on the one hand, and the European Union on the other hand, or what is known as the Agadir Agreement, aimed to develop trade intra exchanges between the four Arab countries in the framework of their partnership with the European Union, while keeping this agreement open for the accession of all Arab Mediterranean countries that signed a partnership agreement with the European Union, where some of these countries have expressed their wish to join them as one of the success models at the regional level. The results of the study showed that the establishment of free Euro-Mediterranean trade zone resulting from the signing of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership Agreement between the Mediterranean countries, including the Arab and the European Union, conducts to the actual blocking for the application of the Arab Free Trade Zone area, and thus eliminating the Arab dream of economic integration as a result of directing the Arab efforts outside the global Arab integration circuit; the fact of the entrance to facilitate trade exchange between Arab countries is of a great importance in order to reach the upper levels of integration. However, it can contribute effectively to the increase of trade exchanges between Arab countries that accessed under it, and this is what was proved through the increase of intra-regional trade of Arab countries in the Euro Mediterranean free exchange zone (Agadir Agreement) as well as the emergence of complementary opportunities in important export sectors in these countries.

40|$|Schistosomiasis japonica, {{caused by}} the blood fluke Schistosoma japonicum, has been endemic in China since ancient times. An {{estimated}} 11 million people were infected in the mid- 1950 s. Recognizing the huge public health significance and {{the economic impact of}} the disease, the central government of China implemented a large-scale control programme, which has been sustained and constantly adapted over the past half century. Today, the endemic areas are mainly confined to the lake and marshland regions along the Yangtze River in five provinces, namely Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan and Hubei. It is estimated that currently about 800, 000 people are infected and that 40 million people are at risk of infection. Historically, the northern geographical limit where schistosomiasis transmission occurred was around the 33 ° 15 ’ N latitude (e. g. in Baoying county, Jiangsu province), governed by low temperature thresholds. Based on various climate models, the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change (IPCC) recently concluded that the Earth has warmed by approximately 0. 6 °C over the past 100 years. This unusual warming has been particularly pronounced during the last three decades. There is growing consensus that the global trend of climate warming will continue in the 21 st century. It has been suggested that climate change could impact on the distribution of the intermediate host snail of S. japonicum, i. e. Oncomelania hupensis. The frequency and transmission dynamics of schistosomiasis can also be affected by waterresource development and management. Among others, the South-to-North Water Transfer (SNWT) project” is currently under construction in China, which intends to divert water from South (the snail-infested Yangtze River) to North (Beijing and Tianjing) via the lakes of Gaoyou, Hongze and others. The implementation and operation of this project could further amplify the negative effects of climate change and facilitate the northward spread of O. hupensis. The main objective of this PhD thesis was to explore the potential impact of climate change and the SNWT project on the future distribution of schistosomiasis japonica, particularly in eastern China. The techniques used were geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing (RS), coupled with Bayesian spatial statistics, which have become key tools for disease mapping and prediction. First, we reviewed the application of GIS/RS techniques for the epidemiology and control of schistosomiasis in China. The applications included mapping prevalence and intensity data of S. japonicum at a large scale, and identifying and predicting suitable habitats for O. hupensis at a small scale. Other prominent applications were the prediction of infection risk due to ecological transformations, particularly those induced by floods and water-resource development projects, and the potential impact of climate change. We discussed the limitations of the previous work, and outlined potential new applications of GIS/RS techniques, namely quantitative GIS, WebGIS and the utilization of emerging satellite-derived data, as they hold promise to further enhance infection risk mapping and disease prediction. We also stressed current research needs to overcome some of the remaining challenges of GIS/RS applications for schistosomiasis, so that further and sustained progress can be made towards the ultimate goal to eliminate the disease from China. Second, recognizing the advantages of combining GIS/RS techniques with advanced spatial statistical approaches, we developed Bayesian spatio-temporal models to analyze the relationship between key climatic factors and the risk of schistosomiasis infection. We used parasitological data collected annually from 1990 to 1998 by means of cross-sectional surveys carried out in 47 counties of Jiangsu province. Climatic factors, namely land surface temperature (LST) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), were obtained from satellite sensors. Our analysis suggested a negative association between NDVI and the risk of S. japonicum infection, whereas an increase in LST contributed to a significant increase in S. japonicum infection prevalence. Third, in order to better understand the changes in the frequency and transmission dynamics of schistosomiasis in a warmer future China, a series of laboratory experiments were conducted to assess the effect of temperature on the parasite-intermediate host snail interaction. We found a positive linear relationship between the development of. S. japonicum larvae harboured in O. hupensis and temperature. In snails kept at 15. 3 °C, S. japonicum larvae tend to halt their development, while peak development occurs at 30 °C. The temperature at which half of the snails were in hibernation is 6. 4 °C. A statistically significant positive association was observed between temperature and oxygen intake of O. hupensis at temperatures below 13. 0 °C. We also detected a logistic relationship between snails’ oxygen intake and their hibernation rate. Our results underscored the important role temperature plays both for the activity of O. hupensis and the development of S. japonicum larvae harboured in the intermediate host snail. Fourth, to substantiate the claim that global warming might alter the frequency and transmission dynamics of S. japonicum in China, we conducted a time-series analysis from 1972 - 2002, using temperature data from 39 counties of Jiangsu province. Using annual growing degree days (AGDDs) with a temperature threshold of 15. 3 °C, we forecasted changes in S. japonicum transmission. The final model included a temporal and a spatial component. The temporal <b>trend</b> <b>consisted</b> of second order polynomials in time plus a seasonality component, while the spatial trend was formed by second order polynomials of the coordinates plus the thin plate smoothing splines. The AGDDs of S. japonicum in 2003 and 2006 and their difference were calculated. The temperatures at the 39 locations showed an increasing temporal trend and seasonality with periodicities of 12, 6 and 3 months. The predicted AGDDs increased gradually from north to south in both 2003 and 2006. The increase in AGDD was particularly pronounced {{in the southern part of}} the study area. Our results suggest that alterations in the transmission intensity of S. japonicum in south Jiangsu will be more pronounced than in the northern part of the province. Fifth, we further assessed the potential impact of climate change on the distribution of O. hupensis via a spatially-explicit analytical approach. We employed two 30 -year composite datasets comprising average monthly temperatures collected at 623 meteorological stations throughout China, spanning the periods 1961 - 1990 and 1971 - 2000. Temperature changes were assessed spatially between the 1960 s and the 1990 s for January, as this is the critical month for survival of O. hupensis. Our results show that the mean January temperatures increased at 590 stations (94. 7...|$|E

40|$|Building upon a multiple-product channel structure, {{this paper}} {{develops}} {{a model to}} test channel price leadership {{on the basis of}} time series observations on retail and wholesale prices and using absence of double marginalisation as a criterion for channel price leadership. The model studies strategic pricing decisions in a two-stage (suppliers–retailers) channel, dealing with several products. Possible long-run relationships between wholesale and retail prices are investigated in relation to three cases. Case 1 : suppliers have sufficient power vis-à-vis retailers to enforce double marginalisation; Case 2 : retailers do not allow suppliers to enforce double marginalisation; and Case 3 : one retailer not only keeps its suppliers from double marginalisation, but is also the horizontal price leader vis-à-vis competing retailers. We explicitly take the time series properties into account to derive the testable implications of strategic price interactions in marketing channels. An attractive feature of our methodology is that price leadership can be tested on the basis of time series on retail prices and wholesale prices only. The procedure for testing the long-run causality implications of the model uses the definition of long-run causality as formulated by Bruneau and Jondeau [Oxf. Bull. Econ. Stat. 61 (4) (1999) 545], but does not use their Wald statistic, which suffers from the undesirable properties of the Wald test when there are nonlinear parameter restrictions. To interpret restrictions on the common stochastic trends of retail and wholesale prices, we show that the common stochastic trends and the deviations from the long-run equilibriums must explicitly be assigned to variables in the channel model. If a common stochastic <b>trend</b> <b>consists</b> of both the retail price and the wholesale price of a product, then the suppliers are able to enforce double marginalisation vis-à-vis the retailers (Case 1). If a common stochastic <b>trend</b> <b>consists</b> solely of a product's wholesale price, then the retailers do not allow suppliers to enforce double marginalisation (Case 2). The opposite situation is a common stochastic <b>trend</b> <b>consisting</b> solely of a product's retail price. In this situation, one of the retailers not only keeps its suppliers from double marginalisation, but is also the horizontal price leader in the retail market for the product (Case 3). The model is applied to a typical multiple product channel allowing various vertical and horizontal interactions between the channel members to co-occur...|$|R

40|$|As {{highlighted}} by several studies, many Italian rivers {{have been affected}} {{at least since the}} mid- 1950 s by relevant channel adjustments, mainly consisting in pattern changes, channel narrowing and lowering, which are largely thought to be controlled by human interventions on the catchments and/or directly on the river systems. This is true also for major rivers of southern Italy, but the case studies are still limited especially when compared to those available for central and northern Italy. Our contribution deals with the analysis of channel adjustments that have affected some of the major Southern Apennines rivers: the rivers Biferno, Trigno and Volturno (Molise), Calore (Campania), Fortore and Ofanto (Puglia), Sinni (Basilicata) and, finally, Crati and Savuto (Calabria) which during the last decades, have all been undergone some type of human intervention such as the construction of dams, in-channel mining, etc. Our reconstruction of channel adjustments is based on a multi-temporal analysis in a GIS environment of topographic maps, aerial photos and orthophotos carried out on selected river reaches, and on the assessment of their actual morphological setting and dynamics by means of field surveys and DGPS topographic measurements. The comparison of obtained results highlight a common evolutive <b>trend</b> <b>consisting</b> in pattern changes from braided to wandering or sinuous, a strong channel narrowing, mostly exceeding 80 %, and a moderate to very high channel incision, while, concerning the last 10 years only, some of the investigated rivers, the Savuto and Crati rivers, appear to be affected by an inversion of this <b>trend,</b> <b>consisting</b> in channel enlargement and the increase of fluvial bars.

However, often, {{the implementation of a}} new control technology occurs {{over a long period of}} time that might exceed the duration of a research project (Quattrone & Hopper, 2001, 2005). Recent <b>trends</b> <b>consisting</b> of having research funded by grants from private institutions or charities have tended to reduce the length of such undertakings to a few months or rarely more than a couple of years (Parker, 2013) ...|$|R
40|$|The article {{provides}} comprehensive analysis of industrial development problems in Rivne region. Territorial disparities of industrial development, {{as well as}} their causation, are revealed based on the analysis of the basic production assets. Analyzing foreign trade relations of the region, the author determined the problem of ensuring a competitive industrial production. Also the article deals with the causes and essence of a <b>trend</b> <b>consisting</b> in switching of many enterprises to the tolling scheme. Energy efficiency of industries in the region is investigated as the problem escalating due to raise of energy prices. Relevant indicators are compared with the national and European average. One of the important problems described in the article is the environmental pollution by industrial waste and the negative impacts of extractive industries on the regional natural ecosystems. Among problems described in the article the key one is the increasing pace of deterioration of the basic industrial and production funds and low innovation activity of enterprises...|$|R

A part of these research refers to the dissertations in which post-graduate students of state universities have tried to analyze Islamic revolution. Academic dissertations are valuable information source that bring about special conditions for research. Content analysis is a common procedure through which many research have been carried out.   The {{purpose of this article}} is to study and analyze research on Islamic revolution in Iran between 1979 – 2010. About 80 thesis has been written on Islamic Revolution in Iran during 25 years by graduate departments of state universities. Based on this fact, this research employs "second analysis" method on available information that has been collected on the basis of data available in database of Iranian Research Institute for Information Science and technology (IranDoc) affiliated to Ministry of Science, Research and Technology. The main variables of this research, in addition to nine research <b>trends,</b> <b>consist</b> of research partnership by gender, discipline, programme, type of university, thesis date, and number of pages of research...|$|R
40|$|New {{methods of}} sampling, {{preparing}} and identifying fossil wood fragments preserved in browncoal are presented {{and used to}} aid in reconstructions of the vegetation from the Miocene Lower Rhine Basin (Germany). The technique involves laboratory charring wood specimens followed by routine identification with reflected light microscopy. Problems concerning the taxonomic identification of the fossil wood are discussed. A list of taxa is presented for the Garzweiler Seam and the implications for reconstructing the Miocene palaeoenvironment are discussed with reference to ecological comparisons of extant taxa: the nearest living relative approach. Results indicate a dominance of conifer wood types, mostly representing members of the Taxodiaceae and Cupressaceae; extensive sampling is required of both small (macroscopic) and large fragments to obtain results comparable with palynological assemblages. Up to now, twenty-one taxa of gymnosperms and angiosperms have been recognized from the Garzweiler seam. Data obtained are compared with those from pollen analysis and corroborate the previously identified <b>trend</b> <b>consisting</b> of increasing concentrations of Taxodium towards the upper section of the seam...|$|R
