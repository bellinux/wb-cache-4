5|$|Although the Koran {{does not}} mention details of Joseph's burial, Islamic {{tradition}} points to Nablus as being <b>the</b> <b>authentic</b> site. However, some early Islamic geographers identified the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron as housing his tomb. While Ali of Herat (1119), Yaqut (1229) and Ibn Battuta (1369) all report the Hebron traditions, they also mention {{the existence of a}} tomb of Joseph at Nablus. Later Muslim chroniclers even mention a third site purporting to be <b>the</b> <b>authentic</b> tomb, near Beit Ijza.|$|E

However, al-Suyuti spoke more definitively when saying that Sahih Ibn Khuzaymah was <b>the</b> most <b>authentic</b> collection after Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim, followed by Sahih Ibn Hibban which, in turn, was more authentic than Al-Mustadrak alaa al-Sahihain, making Sahih Ibn Hibban <b>the</b> fourth most <b>authentic</b> hadith collection in Suyuti's view.|$|R

5|$|In December 1887, Woodford {{contracted}} septicaemia from an untreated foot injury. He died on 23 December. He {{is seen as}} {{a pioneer}} of <b>the</b> <b>Authentic</b> school of masonic research, applying proper historical methodology in place of carelessly repeated fable. He earnestly collected and studied early masonic manuscripts, writing the introduction for Hughan's published collection. He contributed greatly {{to an understanding of the}} enigmatic history of the York lodges in the eighteenth century. His lasting legacy may be seen in the continued activity and influence of Quatuor Coronati Lodge, and the rational approach to masonic history.|$|E

5|$|In early January 1923 Stroheim {{arrived in}} San Francisco, where he scouted {{locations}} and finished writing the shooting script. While researching for Greed, he attended society functions {{in town and}} met many friends of Frank Norris, including his brother Charles and his sister-in-law Kathleen. To capture <b>the</b> <b>authentic</b> spirit of the story, Stroheim insisted on filming on location in San Francisco, the Sierra Nevada mountains, the Big Dipper Mine in Iowa Hill, and Death Valley. He rented some of the actual buildings that had inspired scenes in the novel. Other locations included Cliff House and San Francisco Bay.|$|E
5|$|The Hemingway scholar Allen Josephs {{thinks the}} novel is {{centered}} on the corrida (the bullfighting), and how each character reacts to it. Brett seduces the young matador; Cohn fails to understand and expects to be bored; Jake understands fully because only he moves between {{the world of the}} inauthentic expatriates and <b>the</b> <b>authentic</b> Spaniards; the hotel keeper Montoya is the keeper of the faith; and Romero is the artist in the ring—he is both innocent and perfect, and the one who bravely faces death. The corrida is presented as an idealized drama in which the matador faces death, creating a moment of existentialism or nada (nothingness), broken when he vanquishes death by killing the bull.|$|E
5|$|As a {{deception}} unit, {{the division}} {{was assigned to}} the bogus Operation Trolleycar. Trolleycar was initially envisioned as a fictitious amphibious assault upon the coast of the Netherlands, by the phantom British Fourth Army, to exploit the success of <b>the</b> <b>authentic</b> Operation Market Garden. When the Battle of Arnhem failed, the notional invasion plan was temporarily scrapped. Trolleycar was revived to convince the Germans that the Fourth Army would land near Emden, in support of an imaginary assault by the First Canadian Army, that would be launched west of Arnhem and through the Netherlands. The deception effort was kept up until 1945, being wound down in January. Despite the British ceasing their attempts to deceive the Germans about this possible landing and the Germans not believing all that had been reported to them, the Germans remained anxious about a landing along the northern coast {{for the remainder of the}} war.|$|E

5|$|In 1982, the {{original}} autograph manuscripts of the Nos. 3 to 6 {{of the set}} were discovered at a festival arranged in Melbourne, Australia, for the 250th anniversary of Haydn's birth. After a concert at the festival, a woman presented the manuscripts in a plastic shopping bag to the conductor Christopher Hogwood. The Haydn scholar Georg Feder, who was visiting Australia at the time, then verified the scores to be <b>the</b> <b>authentic</b> original manuscripts of the four quartets. It emerged that the woman who presented the manuscripts to Hogwood had inherited them, through successive generations, from an English colonel who had purchased them at an 1851 auction before emigrating to New Zealand. The colonel's heirs were evidently unaware that they owned the only original versions of the quartets in Haydn's pen. Until the 1982 discovery, publishers had been working from incomplete or non-original editions.|$|E
5|$|Kaksparsh {{was shot}} in the real {{locations}} than sets and was mainly shot in Paalshet, a village near Guhagar in Konkan. As the film's story-line was set around 1930–1950, Manjrekar was concerned about <b>the</b> <b>authentic</b> production design for the film. He appointed two production designers, Prashant Rane and Abhishek Vijaykar, who had challenges of depicting pre and post Indian independence era. Rane had worked with Manjrekar earlier for De Dhakka (2008). Kaksparsh shooting was completed in 26 days; starting from 5 December 2011 till 30 December 2011. The initial shooting scheduled started at Ranade Wada in Pune. The film also had a few scenes in and surrounding the temple but as most of the temples in Konkan region have been restored from their damages over the period of time, Manjrekar feared that the plastering done to repair the damages would not give the desired authentic feel to the film. Thus, the next schedule was shifted to Krishna Ghat, Wai, Maharashtra.|$|E
5|$|King Louis IX of France bought what he {{believed}} to be <b>the</b> <b>authentic</b> Crown of Thorns in Constantinople in 1239, and individual thorns were distributed as gifts by subsequent French kings. John, Duke of Berry (1340–1416), brother of King Charles V of France, had this reliquary made to house a single thorn; it was probably made {{a few years before}} he commissioned his famous Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry, and some years after he commissioned the Royal Gold Cup, also in the British Museum. Previously dated between 1401 and 1410, from evidence in John Cherry's book of 2010 the reliquary is now thought to have been made before 1397; based on the heraldic forms used, the museum now dates it to 1390–97. The Holy Thorn Reliquary was later thought to have been in the possession of Louis I, Duke of Orléans, but all recent writers prefer his brother, the Duke of Berry.|$|E

5|$|The first {{landmark}} as {{the highway}} approaches downtown Mackinac Island is the island's public school building. As it passes the island's public library on the shoreline {{side of the}} street, Main Street makes a sweeping curve to the north at Windermere, or Biddle's, Point to run through the downtown district. Other than the library, most of the city's public buildings are actually situated along Market Street, one block behind Main Street. Three streets and a city park allow for connections between Main and Market streets. M-185 through downtown Mackinac Island passes through the major business district, featuring dozens of shops, restaurants and lodging establishments; nearly a dozen of these outlets feature <b>the</b> <b>authentic</b> Mackinac Island fudge made fresh daily during tourist season. The passenger ferry docks are all situated along Main Street in the downtown area. At the northeastern end of the downtown district, Main Street intersects Fort Street at the state park visitor center to complete its circuit of Mackinac Island.|$|E
