5|$|The game is set after {{a fictional}} World War III, {{the events of}} which have killed off much of the population; those left alive are forced to fight for survival. Some of the {{survivors}} have formed gangs, some turned into mutants from the war's radiation, and some joined an evil militia; collectively, these groups are known as Wastelanders. Raiding different towns and villages, the Wastelanders sought to prey on the townspeople by stealing supplies, forcing some into slavery, and killing others. The heroine of the story, Angel, travels {{from town to town}} in search of her lost friend, Ekx, while helping the town's survivors fend off attacks from Wastelanders. Cruising in her armored car, Gypsy, she makes use of the car's mounted machine guns to defend the towns from thieves and slavers. The first lead Angel finds on her lost friend is from the city of Core, where Ekx was seen traveling through the city on his way to Coalhaven. Angel reaches Coalhaven and uses her armored car to defend the city from members of the renegade militia. After repelling the enemy, the townspeople re-establish their wireless communications and contact the nearby city of New Dallas. Recognizing <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other end, the receiving operator in New Dallas turns out to be Angel's lost friend, Ekx. Ekx confides in Angel that he needs her for something urgent and that she must join him in New Dallas.|$|E
500|$|... (For the Mighty One {{has done}} great things for me) is an aria sung by the bass, {{accompanied}} {{only by the}} continuo. The motif, again beginning with repeated notes, is introduced by four measures of the continuo, then repeated by the voice. A ritornello is repeated throughout the movement, with a downward leap of a sixth and a downward scale of an octave which appears in <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> word [...] "" [...] (holy), in [...] (and holy is His name). God's might shows in the bass voice and the dominant key of B-flat major.|$|E
500|$|Immediately {{recognizing}} <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other end, Remer {{realizes that}} the Reserve Army has been duped—rather than containing a coup, they have unwittingly supported it. SS officers are released and the plotters in turn are besieged inside the Bendlerblock. The headquarters staff flees, but the resistance leaders are arrested. In an ultimately vain effort to save himself, General Fromm convenes an impromptu court martial, places Beck under arrest, and sentences Von Quirnheim, Olbricht, Haeften, and Stauffenberg to death, contravening Hitler's orders that they be kept alive. Given a pistol by Fromm, Beck commits suicide. That night, the ringleaders are then executed by firing squad one by one. Some distance away, General Von Tresckow commits suicide with a grenade. When Stauffenberg {{is about to be}} shot, in a last gesture of loyalty and defiance, Haeften places himself {{in the path of the}} bullets meant for Stauffenberg. When his turn arrives, Colonel Stauffenberg's last act is to cry [...] "Long live sacred Germany!" ...|$|E

500|$|Germans {{entered the}} home that Creger and Slape were using as an {{observation}} post. Slape {{climbed into the}} attic, while Creger only had time to hide behind a door. He pulled the pin on a grenade as the door knob jammed into his ribs. Bullets from the I&R platoon struck the building, and the Germans suddenly left. Creger and Slape exited {{by the back door}} and ducked into a nearby cowshed. They crossed a field and then found themselves in a minefield. Picking their way forward, they circled through the woods until they encountered a handful of Germans. Opening fire, they killed them. Creger and Slape spotted Bouck and Milosevich across the road and sprinted towards them, drawing German fire. They made it back to their ridge-top position and Bouck called Regimental Headquarters. He requested artillery support, but when he reported the German column advancing on his position, <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other end of the radio told him [...] "he must be seeing things". Bouck told them he had 20-20 vision and demanded artillery fire on the road in front of his unit.|$|E
500|$|Wu {{was known}} for posting humorous videos on YouTube. When Wu's [...] "I Have to Deal With Stereotypes" [...] video was {{featured}} on YouTube's home page, his number of viewers began to increase. In this video, Wu talks about stereotypes he {{has to deal with}} as an Asian-American. He tries to disprove his cheapness by bragging about the recent purchase of a [...] "brand new, top-of-the-line, TI-84 calculator". He acknowledges that this might make him nerdy but dismisses this stereotype too as he does not [...] "make all A's...in school today [...] made a B+." [...] He is then greeted by a voice {{that was supposed to be}} his mother calling him a loser and accusing him of dishonoring their family. Wu goes on to say he can prove his predominant social life with the constant ringing of his cell phone. At this point, his phone indeed rings, he answers it, and <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other end to Wu's disappointment says, [...] "Hey, why did you tell me to call you?" [...] Wu has collaborated with fellow YouTube comedian Christine Gambito (HappySlip), making five videos with her. In one of Kevin's older videos, he said he was an only child, which was later proven wrong by his father.|$|E

The {{newspaper}} {{has not been able}} to produce any images from the video showing Sheridan's face and Sheridan says the video is a fake. He conceded his voice was on the tape but suggested it was [...] "spliced" [...] with clips of the voice of someone else. The News of the World claimed four independent voice analysts had confirmed that <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tape is that of Tommy Sheridan. However, in an interview with the BBC a forensic speech scientist, Peter French, said: [...] "Experts should never say conclusively they have identified a person and this kind of evidence should never solely be used to bring a criminal trial".|$|E
2500|$|On {{the night}} of 28 October 2011, {{editor-in-chief}} of the newspaper Khural Avaz Zeynally was arrested after Gular Ahmadova submitted audio materials to the police alleging that Zeynally had been blackmailing her for 10,000 AZN in return for not publishing controversial material about Ahmadova's corruption activity (which later {{became known as the}} Gulargate scandal). Zeynally claimed that <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> recording did not belong to him. He accused Ahmadova of brokering his persecution by the state. After the release of the first Gulargate video, Zeynally said there were obvious parallels between his case and the scandal. He claimed being bothered soon after Elshad Abdullayev's complaint to the Attorney General's about Gular Ahmadova in July 2011. According to Zeynally, Ahmadova contacted him personally in October 2011 asking him [...] "not to publish any information against her that he may be given".|$|E
2500|$|A {{search of}} Bittaker's {{apartment}} revealed several Polaroid photographs which were determined as depicting Andrea Joy Hall and Jackie Gilliam—both {{of whom had}} been reported as missing earlier the same year. Inside Bittaker's van, investigators discovered a sledgehammer, a plastic bag filled with lead weights, a book detailing how to locate police radio frequencies, a jar of Vaseline, two necklaces (later confirmed as belonging to two of the victims) and a tape recording of a young woman in obvious distress; screaming and pleading for mercy while in the process of torture and sexual abuse. The mother of Shirley Lynette Ledford—named by Jimmy Dalton as being one of the women whom Norris had confessed he and Bittaker had killed—identified <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tape as being that of her only daughter; the voices of the two men mocking and threatening Shirley Ledford in the process of her torture and abuse were identified as being Roy Norris and Lawrence Bittaker. Also found in Bittaker's motel were seven bottles of various acidic materials. (Investigators would later discover Bittaker planned to use these acidic materials upon their next victim.) ...|$|E

40|$|The article {{discusses}} how {{a variety}} of qualitative methods {{could be used for}} investigating <b>the</b> engagement of <b>the</b> <b>voices</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground, where the change is expected to happen. It also reviews how qualitative research approaches involve students and teachers, the so-called “target groups” of educational development, as subjects, rather than objects. The qualitative methods are presented here for their potential in engaging <b>the</b> <b>voices</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground. Actor-centred inquiry and participatory action research consist of data collected, analysed and reported, in collaboration between researchers and the research subjects. Enabling the subjects as autonomous actors {{to take part in the}} analysis of their own learning and education provides a means to bring deeper cultural and social knowledge into the development processes. In this way research may promote ownership of educational development. Furthermore, <b>the</b> actors’ <b>voices</b> are key factors in the re-definition of global, national and local educational development targets for the EFA beyond 2015...|$|R
2500|$|The first movement, an aria, {{begins with}} an {{expressive}} melody of the obbligato oboe which is picked up by <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> words [...] (I have enough). The beginning upward leap of a minor sixth {{is reminiscent of the}} aria [...] (Have mercy) in Bach's St Matthew Passion and the aria [...] (When will you come, my salvation?) from [...] The first motif is changed to a phrase that appears at the end of three vocal sections. A similar motif begins the middle section on the words [...] (I have seen him), turning upwards in the end. Klaus Hofmann notes a [...] "feeling of serene contentedness with life" [...] in [...] "elegiac tones" [...] as the aria's expression. Musicologist Julian Mincham notes [...] "that instant when body and soul come to rest and are resigned and in complete harmony. Bach encapsulates this experience of peace and acquiescent submission beyond anything that mere words can convey." [...] He sees the [...] "flowing oboe arabesques", which the singer imitates twice on the word [...] (joy) as a [...] "clear indication that their expressive function is to proclaim the Christian's personal bliss, an inextricable element of this important experience of life".|$|E
2500|$|On October 23, 1980, {{a copy of}} the 911 {{call that}} lured police to the North Omaha home was {{discovered}} at the police station. The tape had never been played at trial.

[...] An FBI memo dated 10/13/70, released after a Freedom of Information Act request, quotes Omaha Assistant Chief of Police Glenn Gates as advising that [...] "any use of tapes of this call might be prejudicial to the police murder trial against two accomplices of PEAK and therefore... he wishes no use of this tape until after the murder trials of PEAK and the two accomplices has been completed." [...] Expert analysis hired by the defense determined in 2006 that <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tape was not the voice of Duane Peak. State and Federal appeals courts denied a new trial based on the voice analysis. The deposition of Duane Peak submitting to voice analysis can be heard in its entirety on YouTube, along with a one-minute comparison of the 911 caller with Peak's voice.|$|E
