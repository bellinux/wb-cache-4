5|$|The {{following}} week, on {{the first}} possession, Smith scored the game’s opening touchdown against the San Diego Chargers, after juggling <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> endzone. Smith played his best game of the season, catching six receptions for 65-yards and the pair of touchdowns in the Raven's 33-34 loss.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland posted an 11–1 {{record in}} 1951, losing their only game to the San Francisco 49ers {{in the season}} opener. That gave the Browns another spot in the {{championship}} game, again against the Rams. This time, however, the Rams won 24–17. Graham fumbled <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> third quarter, setting up a touchdown that put the Rams ahead 14–10. Three of his throws were intercepted, but he put up 280yards of passing and a touchdown. After the season, Graham was named the league's Most Valuable Player.|$|E
5|$|In {{the sixth}} week of play, Vanderbilt beat the Alabama Crimson Tide 14–0 in Birmingham. The score {{reflected}} predictions, since the Commodores were favored by two touchdowns. Jess Neely {{played a role}} in each scoring drive. Early in the first quarter, Vanderbilt had <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle of the field after an Alabama punt. Two line bucks preceded Neely, who connected with Tot McCullough for a 30-yard pass play. Neely ran for an additional 17 yards, putting the ball on the nine-yard line. After a run by Godchaux, Lynn Bomar bucked over the line for the touchdown.|$|E
40|$|The {{classical}} Apollonius' {{problem is}} to construct circles that are tangent to three given circles in a plane. This problem was posed by Apollonius of Perga in his work "Tangencies". The Sylvester problem, which was introduced by the English mathematician J. J. Sylvester, asks for the smallest circle that encloses a finite collection of points <b>in</b> <b>the</b> plane. <b>In</b> this paper, we study the following generalized version of the Sylvester problem and its connection {{to the problem of}} Apollonius: given two finite collections of Euclidean <b>balls</b> <b>in</b> R^n, find <b>the</b> smallest Euclidean <b>ball</b> that encloses all of <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first collection and intersects all of <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second collection. We also study a generalized version of the Fermat-Torricelli problem stated as follows: given two finite collections composed of three Euclidean <b>balls</b> <b>in</b> R^n, find a point that minimizes the sum of the farthest distances to <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first collection and shortest distances to <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second collection...|$|R

5|$|On 4 October 1998, Arsenal hosted Newcastle United at Highbury; Dennis Bergkamp scored {{his first}} league {{goal of the}} season in a 3–0 win. The team failed to convert several chances against Southampton, with the match ending in a 1–1 draw; Anelka and Petit did however score against Blackburn Rovers the {{following}} game, thus putting pressure on opposing manager Roy Hodgson as Blackburn remained in the bottom four. The month ended with a 1–0 win away to Coventry City; Anelka scored his fifth league goal of the season, tapping <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> net after a counterattack started by Overmars.|$|E
5|$|The {{conduct of}} Neymar, who {{performed}} tricks with <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> closing stages of Barcelona's victory, was a talking point after the match. His opponent Iraola decried Neymar, {{saying that his}} actions were unsporting, while Barcelona manager Luis Enrique said that Neymar's actions were common in Brazil, even though frowned upon in Spain, {{and would have to}} change. However, Neymar himself did not apologise and said that he would repeat his behaviour in the future.|$|E

5|$|The kick bounced out {{of bounds}} at the Clemson 44-yard line, and Virginia Tech's offense {{returned}} to the field. On the first play, Vick attempted a pass into the end zone. The throw was intercepted by Clemson defender Robert Carswell, who downed <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> end zone for a touchback. The interception was the final play of the third quarter, which ended with Virginia Tech in the lead, 3413.|$|E
5|$|With 18 minutes played, Lehmann {{became the}} first person to be sent off in a European Cup final after he brought down Samuel Eto'o outside the Arsenal box. Giuly {{subsequently}} put <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> back of the net, but the goal was not allowed due to the foul. Arsenal subsequently substituted Robert Pirès for Manuel Almunia, their substitute goalkeeper. The free-kick was sent wide by Ronaldinho. Following Lehmann's dismissal Barcelona began to exert more pressure on Arsenal, to the point where Emmanuel Eboué was cautioned for a high tackle.|$|E
5|$|At the time, 404 {{would have}} been the highest ever fourth innings score to result in a Test victory for the batting side. Australia had only 345 minutes to reach their target, and the local press wrote them off, {{predicting}} that they would be dismissed by lunchtime on a deteriorating wicket expected to favour spin bowlers. Morris and Hassett started slowly, scoring only six runs in the first six overs on a pitch offering spin and bounce. It appeared they were playing carefully at first before deciding whether to try to achieve the target at a later point. In Bedser's second over, the third of the innings, Morris chipped <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air towards mid-wicket, in a similar manner to his first innings dismissal, but this time the ball evaded Cranston. After 15 minutes, Australia had only made 0/10.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the largest}} crowd to ever witness {{a game in}} Vaught–Hemingway Stadium, Alabama {{defeated}} their long-time rival, the Ole Miss Rebels, 22–3. Alabama struggled to put <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> end zone all afternoon with drives stalled at the Mississippi 8, 4, 4, 4, and 13. Each of those drives resulted in a field goal by Leigh Tiffin, who was 5 for 5 on the day. Other special teams contributions included a blocked punt {{in the second quarter}} and a recovered Dexter McCluster fumble on a punt return in the third quarter, both by Cory Reamer. McElroy struggled, completing only 15 of 34 passes for 147 yards, but Mark Ingram ran for a then career-high 172 yards and accounted for Alabama's only touchdown on a 36-yard run in the second quarter.|$|E
5|$|Bicycle kicks are {{generally}} done in two situations, one defensive {{and the other}} offensive. A defensive bicycle kick is done when a player facing his side's goal uses the action to clear <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> direction opposite his side's goalmouth. Sports historian Richard Witzig considers defensive bicycle kicks a desperate move requiring less aim than its offensive variety. An offensive bicycle kick is used when a player has {{his back to the}} opposing goal and is near the goalmouth. According to Witzig, the offensive bicycle kick requires concentration and a good understanding of the ball's location. Bicycle kicks can also be done in the midfield, but this is not recommended because safer and more accurate passes can be done in this zone.|$|E
5|$|During Gladbach's opening {{match of}} the 2013–14 season against Bayern Munich, Domínguez conceded a penalty when he handled <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> box. Thomas Müller's {{resultant}} penalty was saved by goalkeeper Marc-André ter Stegen but Domínguez handled {{again from the}} rebound, giving away a second penalty which was duly converted by David Alaba. Gladbach ultimately lost the match 3–1. It was an injury-disrupted season for Domínguez, though, as early in October he suffered a broken collarbone and dislocated shoulder. He managed just 22 appearances for the campaign, and 34 in the next before a spate of back injuries severely curtailed his playing time in the seasons that followed.|$|E

5|$|During the team's brief {{visit to}} Tasmania, Jardine made his highest {{first-class}} score of 214. In the fourth Test, Jardine only scored one {{run in the}} first innings, before he was given out leg before wicket (lbw) despite obviously hitting <b>the</b> <b>ball.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> second innings, coming out to bat with the score 21 for two, Jardine scored 98 in a partnership of 262 with Hammond which was then the highest partnership for the third wicket in all Test matches. The scoring was very slow, and the crowd protested throughout Jardine's innings, even though he scored faster than Hammond. He was out when Wisden believed he looked certain to reach a century. England {{went on to win}} the match by 12 runs.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the second}} half, Jensen made another save, this time from Terry McDermott. Brugge's first {{significant}} chance came a few minutes afterwards, when a cross-field pass by René Vandereycken reached Jan Sørensen {{on the right-hand side}} of the pitch. Sørensen's subsequent shot was blocked by Liverpool captain Emlyn Hughes. The blocked shot was not cleared, but Ray Clemence reached the ball before Brugge's Lajos Kű could reach it and score. After this Kű was substituted with Dirk Sanders. Liverpool made a substitution minutes later, with Steve Heighway replacing Case. Liverpool's substitution had more effect, as Heighway gave Liverpool more width on the right-hand side of the pitch. Two minutes after Heighway's introduction, Kenny Dalglish received <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Brugge penalty area from a Graeme Souness pass and placed his shot over a diving Jensen to give Liverpool a 1–0 lead.|$|E
5|$|Galatasaray's Ergün Penbe {{stepped up}} {{to take the first}} spot kick and scored. He placed the ball inside the near {{right-hand}} corner, just past Seaman, who dived to his left. Davor Šuker was the first man up to take Arsenal's penalty kick. His effort proved to be unsuccessful, as the ball hit the left-hand post and bounced off the goal. Şükür became the next player to take Galatasaray's spot kick. He scored as he lobbed <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> right-hand corner. With Galatasaray leading 2–0, Arsenal's next penalty taker was Parlour. He placed the ball on the spot and successfully scored by burying the ball to Taffarel's right to make it 2–1. Ümit Davala calmly placed the goal, near the centre of the goal to make it 3–1 to Galatasaray. Arsenal's only hope now was Vieira, but the midfielder missed and hit the crossbar instead. Popescu then stepped up, and netted with a powerful shot, as Galatasaray won the penalty shoot-out 4–1.|$|E

5|$|Gill {{spent nearly}} {{a full season}} at St Andrew's before he finally made his Football League debut, {{at the age of}} 27, on 18 April 1998 in a 3–0 defeat of Swindon Town. His second game for the club, away to Oxford United, was {{particularly}} eventful. With the score goalless, the referee first failed to award a penalty kick when Gill handled <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> penalty area, then disallowed the goal scored when the player deflected an opponent's cross into his own net; a few minutes later Gill was substituted, though he kept his place in the starting eleven for the next game. Then in the summer of 1998, Birmingham paid £1million for Derby County's Gary Rowett. Installed as first-choice right back, in two seasons at the club Rowett missed only five league games. During this period Gill captained the reserve team to victories in the Birmingham Senior Cup in 1999 and 2000.|$|E
5|$|His goals {{also helped}} Darlington reach {{the second round}} proper (last 32) of the 1919–20 FA Cup. Healey scored twice against Bishop Auckland in the fifth {{qualifying}} round, and repeated the feat in the sixth, as well as creating two for Aaron Travis, as Darlington beat Southern League club Norwich City 5–0. In the first round proper, Darlington faced Sheffield Wednesday of the First Division. A damaged shoulder meant Healey was unfit for the scheduled date, but a waterlogged Feethams pitch gave him an extra few days to recover. The match ended goalless; Healey was unusually indecisive in front of goal, and was standing in an offside position when Travis did put <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> net. Although reported doubtful for the replay, he did appear, pressuring goalkeeper Arnold Birch into conceding a corner from which Darlington took the lead– the goal variously attributed to George Stevens or to Healey himself. He missed the second-round tie at Birmingham because his wife was ill; Darlington lost 4–0.|$|E
5|$|In December 1964, Baxter played brilliantly {{to set up}} a 2–0 win for Rangers in an away {{game against}} Rapid Vienna in the European Cup.
