5|$|George was {{ridiculed}} by his British subjects; {{some of his}} contemporaries, such as Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, {{thought him}} unintelligent {{on the grounds that}} he was wooden in public. Though he was unpopular in Great Britain due to his supposed inability to speak English, such an inability may not have existed later in his reign as documents from that time show <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>understood,</b> spoke and wrote English. He certainly spoke fluent German and French, good Latin, and some Italian and Dutch. His treatment of his wife, Sophia Dorothea, became something of a scandal.|$|E
5|$|He said <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>understood</b> my {{impatience with}} such small demands {{as a few}} hours less a day, or a few dollars more a week.... But what were men of his age to do? They were not likely to {{live to see the}} {{ultimate}} overthrow of the capitalist system. Were they also to forgo the release of perhaps two hours a day from the hated work? That was all they could hope to see realized in their lifetime.|$|E
5|$|Initially J. D. B. {{denied any}} wrongdoing. After being {{confronted with the}} stolen camera and after the urging of a school administrator, J. D. B. confessed to the break-ins. It was at this point, after the confession, that the {{investigator}} informed J. D. B. that he could refuse to answer questions {{and that he was}} free to leave. J. D. B. indicated <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>understood</b> and then proceeded to provide further details about the crime, including the location of the stolen property. J. D. B. wrote a statement at the investigator's request. He was allowed to leave to catch the bus home.|$|E

5|$|Burnside {{was offered}} {{command of the}} Army of the Potomac {{following}} Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan's failure in the Peninsula Campaign. He refused this opportunity because of his loyalty to McClellan and the fact <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>understood</b> his own lack of military experience, and detached part of his corps in support of Maj. Gen. John Pope's Army of Virginia in the Northern Virginia Campaign. He received telegrams at this time from Maj. Gen. Fitz John Porter which were extremely critical of Pope's abilities as a commander, and he forwarded on to his superiors in concurrence. This episode later {{played a significant role}} in Porter's court-martial, in which Burnside appeared as a star witness.|$|E
5|$|Nosek's other friend Ondřej Vlach {{testified that}} Nosek's fall {{happened}} in a break {{between the end of}} concert and the encore. Nosek climbed the stage together with another fan as the band members were leaving to go backstage. According to him, Blythe ran into the two fans and pushed them both off. While the other fan was caught by a couple of fans remaining under the stage, Nosek fell directly on the ground. According to Vlach, there were fewer fans in front of the stage due to the break. Vlach further testified that after the fall, Nosek went to sit on a bench, where he was fetched a water bottle. Nosek began vomiting about half an hour after the fall and as his friends realized that he had a bulge {{at the back of his}} head, they called an ambulance for fear he might have a concussion. Vlach said <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>understood</b> Blythe's gesture in the break as an invitation to the stage.|$|E
5|$|Cast {{initially}} {{as young}} convict Tommy, Brad Pitt dropped out following {{his success in}} Thelma & Louise (the role went to a debuting Gil Bellows); James Gandolfini passed on portraying prison rapist Bogs. Bob Gunton was filming Demolition Man (1993) {{when he went to}} audition for the role of Warden Norton. To convince the studio that Gunton was right for the part, Darabont and producer Niki Marvin arranged for him to record a screen test on a day off from Demolition Man. They had a wig made for him as his head was shaved for his Demolition Man role. Gunton wanted to portray Norton with hair as this could then be grayed to convey his on-screen aging as the film progressed. Gunton performed his screen test with Robbins, which was filmed by Deakins. After being confirmed for the role, he used the wig in the film's early scenes until his hair re-grew. Gunton said that Marvin and Darabont saw <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>understood</b> the character which went in his favor, as did the fact his height was similar to Robbins' allowing Andy to believably use the warden's suit.|$|E

5|$|Peter K. Bol {{asserts that}} the {{supporters}} of Wang Anshi's expansionist, activist central government in his New Policies were convinced <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>understood</b> the dao which brought utopia to Western Zhou (c. 1050 BC – 771 BC) antiquity and were determined to conform society according to his vision. The marginalised emperor – the last remaining aristocrat with any true political power – embraced the fiction that he was like the sage kings of old who brought society {{into a state of}} total harmony with court rituals and policy reforms. Yet after the reign of Emperor Huizong, Song rulers and officials alike disregarded the New Policies and focused instead on reforming society through a local, bottom-up approach. For example, Emperor Huizong attempted from 1107–1120 to bar anyone who had not attended a government school from serving in public office. He thus rejected anyone who did not acknowledge his brand of Confucian ideology as orthodoxy. However, the government-run school system during the Southern Song eventually lost prominence to private academies, which had outnumbered government schools during the early Northern Song. Even before Emperor Huizong's reign, Sima Guang (1019–1086), a prominent chancellor and political rival to Wang Anshi, had little to say about the emperor's role in shaping major reforms and public policy, mentioning only that the emperor made major appointments when necessary.|$|E

At {{the same time he}} emphasized that he wanted to have harmonic relations with the Hungarian Jewish community.|$|E
25|$|Branyan {{began the}} season playing a platoon role with {{teammate}} Bill Hall. Hall {{did not like}} the shared role, feeling that he should be playing full-time. Branyan expressed no problem with the platoon role, but stated <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>understood</b> why Hall disliked the situation. Branyan started the season earning praise from manager Ned Yost and soon saw increased playing time. Later in the season, however, Branyan's playing time was decreased.|$|E

25|$|The maximum {{sentence}} is 25 {{years in prison}} plus a $500,000 fine. Testifying in court when Marquez's guilty plea was entered, the father {{of one of the}} victims denounced the plea agreement, saying that it would lead to a sentence that was too light; the U.S. Attorney stated <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>understood</b> the father's pain, but that the government did not have sufficient evidence to prosecute Marquez for more serious offenses.|$|E
25|$|A public dispute {{broke out}} between Grey and Cameron, who were both strong-willed. Grey wished {{to crush the}} Kingite {{rebellion}} quickly, but Cameron was adamant {{that he would not}} start operations until his supply line was in place. Grey argued <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>understood</b> the mentality of the Māori rebels, but Cameron would not be swayed on military matters. Relations between Grey and Cameron were strained from this point on, as Cameron wrote directly to the Secretary of War in Britain, criticising Grey's war policy. Grey was faced with more and more criticism from the New Zealand press and public, which did not appreciate Cameron's high level of skill and experience.|$|E
25|$|As {{a platoon}} commander, de Gaulle was {{involved}} in fierce fighting from the outset. He received his baptism of fire 15 August and {{was among the first}} to be wounded, receiving a bullet in the knee at the Battle of Dinant. It is sometimes claimed that in hospital, he grew bitter at the tactics used, and spoke with other injured officers against the outdated methods of the French army. However, there is no contemporary evidence <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>understood</b> the importance of artillery firepower in modern warfare; instead in his writing at the time he criticised the “overrapid” offensive, the inadequacy of French generals, and the “slowness of the English troops”.|$|E

25|$|On 28 September 1810, Hidalgo {{arrived at}} the city of Guanajuato with rebels, who were, for the most part, armed with sticks, stones, and machetes. The town's Spanish and Creole populations took refuge in the heavily {{fortified}} Alhóndiga de Granaditas granary defended by Quartermaster Riaños. The insurgents overwhelmed the defenses after two days and killed everyone inside, an estimated 400-600 men, women and children. Allende strongly protested these events and while Hidalgo agreed that they were heinous, he also stated <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>understood</b> the historical patterns that shaped such responses. The mass's violence as well as Hidalgo's inability or unwillingness to suppress it caused the creoles and peninsulares to ally against the insurgents out of fear. This also caused Hidalgo to lose any support from liberal creoles he might have otherwise have attained.|$|E
25|$|The Tuileries Palace, {{city hall}} of Paris, {{and many other}} public {{buildings}} had been burned by the Commune or damaged in the fighting, but the Odéon was still intact. Charles-Marie Chilly, the co-director of the Odéon, came to her apartment, where Bernhardt received him reclining on a sofa. He announced that the theater would reopen in October 1871, and {{he asked her to}} play the lead in a new play, Jean-Marie by André Theuriet. Bernhardt replied that she was finished with the theater and was going to move to Brittany and start a farm. Chilly, who knew Bernhardt's moods well, told her <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>understood</b> and accepted her decision, and would give the role to Jane Essler, a rival actress. According to Chilly, Bernhardt immediately jumped up from the sofa and asked when the rehearsals would begin.|$|E
25|$|The product {{rule and}} chain rule, {{the notions of}} higher {{derivatives}} and Taylor series, and of analytic functions were introduced by Isaac Newton in an idiosyncratic notation which he used to solve problems of mathematical physics. In his works, Newton rephrased his ideas to suit the mathematical idiom of the time, replacing calculations with infinitesimals by equivalent geometrical arguments which were considered beyond reproach. He used the methods of calculus {{to solve the problem}} of planetary motion, the shape of the surface of a rotating fluid, the oblateness of the earth, the motion of a weight sliding on a cycloid, and many other problems discussed in his Principia Mathematica (1687). In other work, he developed series expansions for functions, including fractional and irrational powers, and it was clear <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>understood</b> the principles of the Taylor series. He did not publish all these discoveries, and at this time infinitesimal methods were still considered disreputable.|$|E

25|$|The {{status of}} McCune's {{religious}} beliefs {{is open to}} dispute. Mormon missionary Stuart Martin wrote in 1920 that McCune was not a Mormon, but had many Mormon friends and had given much money to the church. Judge Orlando Powers, Associate Justice of the Utah Supreme Court, said in 1906 <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>understood</b> that McCune was not a Mormon. Frank J. Cannon, too, claimed McCune was not a Mormon,and B. H. Roberts, LDS Church historian {{and member of the}} First Council of the Seventy, said in 1930 that McCune was not a church member. Historian Orvin Malmquist, however, says that church records show he was baptized into the LDS Church at the age of eight in 1857, and that his marriage to Elizabeth Claridge in a Mormon temple in 1872 could not have occurred without his being a church member. It is not in dispute that he was baptized by proxy in 1969.|$|E
25|$|In 1994, Jonie Flint sued Chopra, the Maharishi Ayur-Veda Health Center in Palo Alto California and Brihaspati Dev Triguna {{over her}} husband David's death from leukemia. Two months {{following}} {{a visit to}} the center at which a primordial sound treatment was prescribed by Chopra, Triguna declared Flint cured of leukemia. Flint followed other Maharishi Ayur-Veda treatments at Triguna's directions over a period of nine months, at a cost of more than $10,000, but died of leukemia. Flint was assisted in filing her lawsuit by the National Council Against Health Fraud. Chopra's attorneys said that the suit against him would be dismissed before trial. They said that David Flint was desperate and that Chopra saw him for 45 minutes for spiritual counsel and gave him a primordial sound technique. They also said that Flint signed a form saying <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>understood</b> that sound therapy wasn't a substitute for conventional therapies, and that the form Flint signed also absolved Chopra and his organization of responsibility in the event the treatment was unsuccessful.|$|E
