40|$|Background: Preference <b>to</b> <b>foods</b> among {{children}} is a predictor of food consumption pattern. Therefore good under- standing on food preference of children, factors related <b>to</b> <b>foods</b> most likes and disliked needs to be studied for  nutrition education and food supply planning for children. Objective: To find out the relationship between children sex, education of mother, and motivation of teachers with preference <b>to</b> <b>foods</b> available in school among preschool children at Muhammadiyah University of Purwokerto. Methods: The study used cross sectional approach by analyzing data of 60 preschool children. Observation and interview were carry out <b>to</b> identify <b>food</b> preference of the children. The independent variables were children sex, education of mothers, and motivation of teachers whereas the dependent variable was preference <b>to</b> <b>foods</b> available in school. Results: Boys liked jellies and quail egg satay whereas girls liked vegetable filled pastry and cracker fries. The result of chi-square test showed that there was difference in food preference between the girls and boys (p< 0. 05).

40|$|Background: Refractory {{gastroesophageal}} reflux disease (GERD) can {{be related}} to greater sensitization <b>to</b> <b>foods.</b> Objective: <b>To</b> evaluate sensitization <b>to</b> <b>foods</b> in patients with refractory GERD. Methods: Patients with refractory GERD after using at least 40 mg of a proton pump inhibitor were given a restriction diet {{based on the results of}} skin prick testing and atopy patch testing with foods. The characteristics of sensitized patients were compared with those of nonsensitized patients in relation to atopy and number of eosinophils in the esophageal mucosa. Results: The prevalence of sensitization <b>to</b> <b>foods</b> was 27. 7 %. Asthmatic patients showed higher sensitization <b>to</b> <b>foods</b> (P =. 008). Eosinophils were determined to be present in the esophageal mucosa in 15. 8 % of patients, and this correlated with greater sensitization <b>to</b> <b>foods</b> (P =. 01). One case of eosinophilic esophagitis was confirmed. A diet excluding identified sensitizing <b>foods</b> led <b>to</b> clinical improvement regarding GERD symptoms (P =. 004). Conclusion: The presence of eosinophils in esophageal mucosa associated with greater sensitization <b>to</b> <b>foods</b> and the response to a restriction diet in patients with positive test results suggest that refractory GERD can represent an initial stage of eosinophilic esophagitis.

40|$|Because IgG {{antibodies}} <b>to</b> <b>foods</b> can {{be detected}} before IgE antibodies to inhalants, increased levels of IgG antibodies <b>to</b> <b>foods</b> might {{be used as a}} predictor of IgE-mediated allergy in initially nonatopic children. To examine the cross-sectional relation between IgG <b>to</b> <b>foods</b> (i. e. mixture of wheat and rice, mixture of soybean and peanut, egg white, cow's milk, meat, orange and potato) and specific IgE to cat, dog, mite, milk and egg white in 1 -year-old children. All atopic children (n = 120; 58 with and 62 without eczema) and a random sample of the nonatopic children (n = 144) of the Bokaal study were tested on their IgG response <b>to</b> <b>foods.</b> The IgG results of the food assays were dichotomized high or low using the 66 th centile as a cut-off value. Atopic children more often had high IgG levels <b>to</b> <b>foods</b> than nonatopic children. IgG to egg white (OR = 7. 50) and mixture of wheat and rice (OR = 4. 79) were most strongly associated with positive specific IgE. In a stepwise logistic regression analysis egg white, mixture of wheat and rice, and orange were selected (OR = 3. 76, OR = 2. 43, and OR = 2. 11, respectively). In children without eczema higher levels of IgG <b>to</b> <b>foods</b> were still significantly associated with atopy, which was most prominent for egg white, orange and cow's milk. An increased IgG antibody level <b>to</b> <b>foods,</b> especially <b>to</b> egg white, orange, and mixture of wheat and rice, indicates an increased risk of having IgE to cat, dog, mite, egg and/or milk allergens, even in the noneczematous group.

40|$|This study {{estimates}} {{the effects of}} food hypersensitivity on individuals' perceived welfare and well-being compared to non-food hypersensitive individuals. Study respondents were recruited in the Netherlands, Poland, Spain and UK. The difference in welfare between food hypersensitive respondents and those asymptomatic <b>to</b> <b>foods</b> was estimated using a subjective welfare approach, including income evaluation. Well-being was measured using the Cantril Ladder-of-Life Scale, and health status using the Self-Perceived Health Scale. The difference in well-being, welfare and health status between participant groups was explained further using a number of background variables. No significant within-country differences in welfare between food hypersensitive respondents and respondents asymptomatic <b>to</b> <b>foods</b> were found. In terms of well-being, adult food hypersensitive respondents and their spouses reported significantly less happiness than respondents and their spouses asymptomatic <b>to</b> <b>foods</b> in the Netherlands and Poland. In Spain, the spouses of the food hypersensitive respondents were significantly less happy than respondents aymptomatic <b>to</b> <b>foods.</b> The well-being of children did not significantly differ between groups. The degree of severity of food hypersensitivity was negatively related to overall health status. In Poland, food hypersensitive respondents reported worse health status compared to asymptomatic respondents. In Spain, the converse was true. Food hypersensitive respondents were generally less happy with their life as a whole than respondents asymptomatic <b>to</b> <b>foods,</b> presumably because they experienced more negative effects, which were not related to perceived health status...|$|R
