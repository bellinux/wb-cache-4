40|$|Recently, {{the chapel}} of San Domenico – in the {{mezzanine}} {{of the roman}} convent of Santa Sabina – has been stylistically attributed to Gianlorenzo Bernini. Until now, the most relevant documentary connection between Bernini and the chapel was recognized in the papal chirografo issued on the 10 th of December 1669 by Clement IX Rospigliosi (1667 - 69), related to the intervention on the Aventine Hill, and other four works, also referable to Bernini. Here, this paper proposes new reflections to support this link, developed {{in the analysis of}} two drawings, normally associated with the Bernini school but not specifically to this chapel. They represent a previous version of the executive project and probably were carried out by Mattia De Rossi (1637 - 95), who was the first assistant of Bernini in architectural works.

40|$|Background: Generation of {{meaningful}} public health policy impact from research is challenging. Research of similar quality often has differential uptake and lag time is considerable, estimated at approximately 17 years. Impact {{is often described}} in terms of linear and cyclical models, in which the production of research findings compels action, but such conceptualisations do not appear to have supported translation. This work uses meta-ethnography to synthesise case studies exploring how researchers have generated public health policy impact, to identify transferable lessons for promoting evidence based policies and see if this method can provide greater insight than commonly presented linear and cyclical models. Methods: Meta-ethnography of 21 case studies of researchers from across the University of Cambridge, United Kingdom, who feel they have achieved public health impact from their work, including contributing to guidance, policies and strategies locally, national and internationally and developing new tools and technology used in practice. Cases were chosen for richness of data and perspectives from a convenience sample. Findings: Eight constructs were identified: expertise; motivation; practical solutions to important problems; support structure and funding; collaboration; wide dissemination and use of media to contribute ideas to the wider narrative; understanding the policy realm; and models of impact. These results suggest researchers seeking to obtain impact need to be highly motivated; develop expertise in their field; and seek to conduct research that provides practical solutions to problems that are of interest, or may become of interest, to policy makers. They need to work to understand the policy realm, including the importance of timing, and build trusting relationships with policy makers, through the media, to contribute ideas to the wider narrative. Being prepared with accessible information when policy makers become interested in their work and collaborating with others are also key. Interpretation: The process of translation of research into impact appears more complex than that suggested by linear and cyclical models. Success involves seeking to shape wider debates, building relationships with policy makers, becoming a <b>trusted</b> <b>collaborator</b> and being available to provide relevant and practical solutions to questions of concern to policy makers at the appropriate time...|$|E
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of the 1910 Revolution in bringing about social change continues to be fiercely debated one hundred years after the fact. The genre called "narrative of the Mexican Revolution" has acted as a literary compass in this regard. One outstanding example is El águila y la serpiente by Martín Luis Guzmán. Written during the author's second exile in Spain, it quickly became a bestseller. Since then, however, it has been criticized as lacking in genre or as an elitist series of portraits of " los de arriba," or those on top. In order to vindicate Guzmán's fictionalized memoirs, I take a different approach based on a key character ignored by 20 th-century critics: the narrator. First, {{the ways in which}} moral judgment has been wielded against Guzmán by critics such as Fernando Curiel, prevented a clear vision of his literary "I. " Despite his contributions in the political and literary arena, he became in essence the Cortez of the Mexican literary canon, one whose faults eclipsed not only his name [...] notable for its absence within the arena of celebratory public manifestations [...] but also his major cultural and literary contributions. These contributions include: editing newspapers such as El sol and La voz under the 2 nd Republic of Spain as a <b>trusted</b> <b>collaborator</b> of President Azaña's, spearheading the independence of Latin American academies of language from the Royal Academy, and founding the National Commission of Free Textbooks in Mexico. Through an analysis of his intellectual agenda and the previous critical readings of El águila y la serpiente I offer new readings of his work, contrasting Guzmán's vision of the Revolution with that of his contemporary, José Vasconcelos, in La tormenta (1935). Finally, I conclude that El águila y la serpiente is a superbly written, sui generis vision unlike any others found in the genre, delving into the relationship between memory and guilt at a time that defined both Mexico and its literature. This book stands as a mea culpa from a member of the criollo intellectual elite, who courageously revealed his social class as a failure and the Revolution itself as a paradoxical wheel of fortune...|$|E

40|$|Our {{vision of}} the future of {{information}} systems is one that includes engineered collectives of software agents which are situated in an environment over years and which increasingly improve the performance of the overall system of which they are a part. At a minimum, the movement of agent and multi-agent technology into National Security applications, including their use in information assurance, is apparent today. The use of deliberative, autonomous agents in high-consequence/high-security applications will require a commensurate level of protection and confidence in the predictability of system-level behavior. At Sandia National Laboratories, we have defined and are addressing a research agenda that integrates the surety (safety, security, and reliability) into agent-based systems at a deep level. Surety is addressed at multiple levels: The integrity of individual agents must be protected by addressing potential failure modes and vulnerabilities to malevolent threats.

40|$|Text {{is devoted}} to Octavianus, one of the comites Hispaniarum of Constantine the Great (306 - 337). Counts of Spain belonged {{to the group of}} emperor’s trusted collaborators, who were {{dispatched}} to the dioceses to inform the ruler about the situation there and to put it in right if necessary (comites dioecesium). Constantine’s comites Hispaniarum should be distinguished from the Military Commanders in the diocese of Spain also called comites Hispaniarum by the Notitia Dignitatum. On the contrary, they were a kind of civil officials, the superintendents of ordinary governors of the provinces. The first of Constantine’s comites Hispaniarum was Octavianus in 316 - 317 A. D, who was not only the first count of Spain but also the very first known comes dioecesium at all. Two constitutions of the Emperor are addressed to him —CTh 9, 1, 1 = C 3, 24, 1 (316 A. D.) — ordering the loss of senators’ prescription of forum in all criminal trials when they were caught, especially the senators who abducted a maiden or invaded the boundaries of another and CTh 12, 1, 4 (317 A. D.) — devoted to a particular question of decurion’s cursus honorum. Author indicates that both constitutions were emperor’s rescripts, issued probably in/around Serdica (Sofia in Bulgaria). He points that at least since the publishing of the Theodosian Code in 438 A. D. they acquired binding force in all provinces of the Roman empire, although at the beginning these constitutions were probably applied only to the cases which had happened in the diocese of Spain. Author discusses the opinions concerning the person of count Octavianus and he states that it is better to distinguish Octavianus, the comes Hispaniarum and Rufinus Octavianus, corrector Lucaniae et Brittorum (Italy) in 313. He points that Octavianus was probably a descendent of a Roman family as his traditional name suggests, maybe the member of some senatorial family, like most of different comites in the epoch of Constantine the Great but probably he was not of Spanish origin or a Christian. Author deduces that Octavianus was comes Hispaniarum not for a long time perhaps between Summer/Fall of 316 and the end of 317 or beginning of 318. He indicates that Octavianus judged some disputes which arose in Spanish dioceses as at least CTh 9, 1, 1 shows (received by Octavianus in Corduba/Córdoba, the capital of Roman province Baetica and the former seat of one of conventus iuridici). He suggests the possibility of Octavianus’ visits also in other provinces of Spanish diocese and their capitals or even old capitals of conventus iuridici {{because of the nature of}} comites diocesium missions. According to his opinion, it is not excluded that the emperor Constantine could be well informed about the state of affairs in Spanish diocese — and the necessity of the extraordinary inspection of emperor’s comes— thanks to the contacts of his <b>trusted</b> <b>collaborator</b> and spiritual adviser, bishop Ossius of Cordoba...|$|E

40|$|Although {{conflict}} and trust {{have often been}} considered incompatible, recent studies indicate that managing conflict cooperatively and trust can reinforce each other. This chapter uses recent research to understand how cooperative goals strengthen trust and how trust promotes open-minded discussions that help protagonists resolve their conflicts constructively. These open-minded discussions very much contribute to making industrial relations practices effective. Trust is defined as expectations that another person will promote one’s goals. Cooperative goals strengthen <b>trust</b> as <b>collaborators</b> understand that they can promote their own goals by helping others reach their goals. Trust is critical for fostering open-minded discussions that result in strengthened relationships and mutually beneficial resolutions. In contrast, competitive goals are a basis for suspicious expectations that fosters closed-minded interaction that in turn results in fragmented relationships and deadlock or imposed decisions. Considerable research identifies various strategies that managers and employees have to develop cooperative goals, trust, and open-minded discussions. Then they are empowered to manage their conflicts directly and constructively with {{each other as they}} resolve their grievances, negotiate compensation, and in other ways strengthen the work relationships between employees and managers...|$|R

The practice was continued by successive popes, who named their cardinals particularly to the recently reestablished Latin archiepiscopal sees in southern Italy (Siponto, Brindisi, Salerno, Benevento). Also, three successive archbishops of Pisa: Uberto Rossi Lanfranchi (1133-1137/38), Balduino (1138-1145) and Villano Caetani (1146-1175) were initially the cardinals.Up to the pontificate of Pope Alexander III (1159-1181), all the cardinals who were appointed to the external episcopal sees, resigned their membership in the College of Cardinals after receiving episcopal consecration, which clearly shows that the episcopate was considered a higher dignity than that of cardinal-priest or deacon. On the other hand, the bishops were never appointed cardinals. Certainly, the episcopate and cardinalate were considered incompatible dignities. However, during Alexander’s pontificate a change is apparent; although there were still the cases of the cardinals leaving the College of Cardinals after assuming episcopal office (Lombardo of Benevento, Rainaldo of Gaeta), there also appeared members of the College who were simultaneously cardinals and bishops. Perhaps Alexander III followed here an example of his rival, Antipope Victor IV, who in 1162 appointed Aicardo Cornazzano bishop of Parma and cardinal-priest. The first such instance in the legitimate obedience was Conrad of Wittelsbach, who was appointed cardinal-priest of S. Marcello in December 1165 and subsequently promoted to the suburbicarian see of Sabina, but continued to act also as archbishop of Mainz. Archbishop of Reims Guillaume aux Blanches Mains was named cardinal priest of S. Sabina in 1179, but retained archdiocese of Reims; similarly bishops Giovanni of Toscanella, Ruffino of Rimini and Gerardo of Novara, elevated to the cardinalate in 1189, 1190 and 1211 respectively. On the other hand, when cardinal-priest Uberto Crivelli was elected and consecrated archbishop of Milan in 1185, he retained his cardinalate and his Roman titulus (S. Lorenzo in Damaso). The posts of cardinal and bishop were no longer considered incompatible with each other. Moreover, the rank of cardinal-priest or cardinal-deacon became {{equal to that of}} bishop. However, it seems that the elected, but not yet consecrated, bishops who were appointed cardinals were generally obliged to resign their sees.|$|R

40|$|Narses {{was born}} ca. 480 in Persian Armen 1 a but from his early {{adolescence}} {{he was staying}} at the imperial court. Sources describe him already as a mature man. whom the emperor trusted. He {{began his career as}} a civilian official and held various posts (sacellarius, cubicularius, praepositus sacri cubiculq. He was promoted to thc rank of Ulustris in 537 or 538. In 532 hc played a part in saving Justinian's power during the Nike's mutiny. In 535 he intervcned in Alexandria shaken at that time by religious arguments and succeeded in making Theodosius patriarch. Narses' military carcer began very late. when he was 58 and was sent to Italy by the emperor in ordcr to support Belisarius (538). Due to a conflict between the commanderin- chief and Narses. the emperor callcd the latter back to Constantinople soon. Upon the return to Byzantium Narses remained one of Justinian's most <b>trusted</b> <b>collaborators.</b> One of his tasks was the investigation of the plot Belisarius and John of Cappadokia had been acused of. He intervened when unrest burst out at Constantinople. Sent to the Heruls he managed to make them take part in the struggle against the Goths and he participated in the struggle against the Slavs who had invaded Thrace (545). On the turn of 550 and 551, when he was 75, Narses was appointed strategos- -autokrator and ordered to defeatTotila,king ofOstrogoths. With considerablestrength in men and fmancial resouces and with the experienced advisor, John, he managed to annihilate the state of Ostrogoths in Italy. He was honored for his feats with the title of patrician and became administrator of the regained province. His post was confirmed by the pragmatic sanction of 554. Narses then organized administrative reforms of Italy and reconstruction from war destruction. He also helped install Pelagius on the papal throne. He became known as a severe administrator and was accused of getting huge money from his post. At the same time howeverhe spent big sums on church foundations. Removed from his post by Justin II in 567 or 568, he died in Italy, probably in Romebetween 568 and 574. A coincidence of the removal from his post with the Lombard invasion in Italy caused accuseation of his collaboration with the latter. The accusations are not supported by any evidence though. MostByzantinehistorians speaks ofNarseswith greatest esteem. His contemporary tell about his human attitude, lack of cruelty, defending the victims, modesty, piety (he syrnphatized with monophysites) and keeping promises. He was able to operate in extremely difficult conditions, showing both military and organizational talents and did not belong to the individuals convincedof his own infallibility. In his actions he could make use of both conventional and non-conventional warfare and was popular among soldiers. Narses' ethnicity did not have any influence on his career. He was brought up at Constantinople and nothing points out any ties with the country of his origin. He is almost certain not to have taken any actions in favor of Persian Armenia. Even if he had wanted to, he would not have had any chance to do that, as he was sent to other, distant provinces of the empire.

40|$|Scientists {{who make}} {{breakthrough}} discoveries can receive above- normal returns to their intellectual capital, with returns {{depending on the}} degree of natural excludability - that is, whether necessary techniques can be learned through written reports or instead require hands-on experience with the discovering scientists or those trained by them in their laboratory. Privatizing discoveries, then, only requires selecting <b>trusted</b> others as <b>collaborators,</b> most often scientists working in the same organization. Within organizational boundaries, incentives become aligned based on repeat and future exchange, coupled with third-party monitoring and enforcement. We find that high value intellectual capital paradoxically predicts both a larger number of collaborators and more of that network contained within the same organization. Specifically, same-organization collaboration pairs are more likely when the value of the intellectual capital is high: both are highly productive 'star' scientists, both are located in top quality bioscience university departments, or both are located in a firm (higher ability to capture returns). Collaboration across organization boundaries, in contrast, is negatively related to the value of intellectual capital and positively related to the number of times the star scientist has moved. Organizational boundaries act as information envelopes: The more valuable the information produced, the more its dissemination is limited. In geographic areas where a higher proportion of coauthor pairs come from the same organization, diffusion to new collaborators is retarded. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{theatrical}} framework {{provides a}} storytelling spectrum {{to explore the}} human experience. My graduate school stage management work consisted of stories fraught with difficult themes, painful emotions, and graphic sexual imagery. I took notes about the psyche of a child molester during table work for Ronald McCants' new play Refraction. I wrote blocking notation for depictions of the angel Gabriel (Callimaco) and the Virgin Mary (Lucrezia) dissolving into passionate sexual displays in Machiavelli's La Mandragola. In my thesis production, The Threepenny Opera, I called lighting cues while Polly shot up heroin and Mack the Knife sang about abortions. As a stage manager, I am responsible for maintaining the continuity and integrity of a show from pre-production through closing. It is critical that I form authentic and truthful connections with each person and embrace the work even in challenging contexts. My confrontation with content {{can lead to a}} company's realization of expression and creativity as I facilitate communication and remain receptive to the redefinition of traditional process. I discovered that Bertolt Brecht's verfremdungseffekt (the distancing effect) works on both the artists involved and the audience who watches. Brecht's plays are alienating and distancing in process and final product. Through my own connectedness to the work as well as my multi-faceted personal and professional advocacy for all artists, I offered a spirit of comfort, safety, and <b>trust</b> for each <b>collaborator.</b> My absolute presence and active engagement allowed me to successfully lead the company through the disconcerting isolation of The Threepenny Oper...|$|R
40|$|Research in {{network and}} {{computer}} system architecture is evolving beyond its traditional focus as mobile devices become ubiquitous and mobile computing triggers {{dramatic change in}} the computing world. Mobile devices can form heterogeneous mobile networks that provide distributed services and information access in real time {{from anywhere in the}} world. Coincident with this change, the assurance of network and system security and availability becomes an important problem. This problem is challenging because it requires the system to be easy to manage and operate, but also requires reliability and security. For the purpose of securing a network, we usually require authentication, authorization, and accounting. Authentication requires users to prove their identity. Accounting requires intrusion detection or forensic analysis to find attacks, if any, in the system. Finally, authorization requires access control to ensure data privacy. This dissertation aims to design security and collaboration protocols to create a comprehensive trust framework to protect mobile and sensor networks by applying cryptographic algorithms. It makes three primary contributions. First, we propose and implement a distributed authentication protocol called DAPP in wireless sensor networks to allow sensors to authenticate servers without requiring a commonly-used trusted authentication server. DAPP maintains the distributed nature of sensor networks, has low computation and communication overhead, and is resilient to node compromises. Second, to attain security for nodes in mobile ad hoc networks, we present an intrusion detection system (IDS) architecture at the application layer to help detect malicious nodes in the network. We describe the design of this architecture and the use of mobile agents to augment each node's IDS. Finally, we design a trusted group-based information sharing protocol called TGIS for mobile devices to establish a <b>trust</b> relationship with <b>collaborators</b> and enforce data access control between collaborators with different privileges. TGIS is built upon existing trust infrastructures in individual organizations to enable trust management for group collaboration. The security and collaboration protocols presented in this dissertation together achieve secure distributed authentication, authorization, and accounting in mobile and sensor networks...|$|R
