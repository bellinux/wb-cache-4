40|$|ABSTRACT: X-ray {{microbeam}} data of five tokens of {{the word}} light from 26 female and 22 male English speakers are examined {{in an attempt to}} find some of the articulatory correlates of observed acoustic differences in male and female diphthong duration (female> male). Upward vertical displacement of the tongue body associated with the diphthong glide and downward tongue tip movement around lateral release are analysed. Expected relationships between displacement magnitude, peak velocity, and movement duration are found in tongue body and tip data. Tongue body movement is found to be slightly longer for male speakers. Significant differences in the temporal onset of tongue tip movement relative to tongue body movement are found, such that the tongue <b>tip</b> <b>release</b> of the female lateral begins earlier...|$|E
40|$|None supplied. From {{executive}} summary: As {{part of the}} Turbine Survival Program, survival probabilities (1 h and 48 h) of hatchery-reared chinook salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, (average {{total length}} about 1. 54 mm) were estimated at McNary turbine Unit 9. The primary objectives {{of the study were}} to: (1) estimate survival rates of juvenile salmon introduced near the turbine hub, blade tip, and stay vane/wicket gate relative to those introduced near the mid-blade region, and (2) better understand the factors and mechanisms contributing to injury/mortality of turbine passed fish. The turbine passage tests were conducted with the unit operating at nearly constant blade angle (25. 22 º) and wicket gate setting and within 1 % of maximum efficiency. The four release locations were chosen {{based on the results of}} a hydraulic model study at the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers Waterways Experiment Station which indicated that injury/mortality risks vary with fish entrainment locations within the turbine environment. The proportion of alive recaptured fish ranged from 0. 919 for the blade <b>tip</b> <b>release</b> to 0. 936 for the hub releases. The proportion of fish recaptured dead was lowest for the mid-blade region (0. 016) and similar for all other release locations (0. 030 to 0. 032) ...|$|E
40|$|Ultrastructure of the renette {{cell and}} caudal glands was {{studied in the}} {{free-living}} aquatic nematode Sphaerolaimus gracilis. The renette cell occurred posterior to the esophageal-intestinal junction and opened through an ampulla to a ventral pore behind the nerve ring. The caudal gland system of the tail consisted of two gland cells opening through separate pores and 2 to 3 other gland cells of a different type opening through a common pore. The renette cell and the two caudal gland cells were similar and both contained secretory granules, 0. 5 - 1. 5 μm in diameter. The material released attached the nematode to the substrate. The renette ampulla {{was surrounded by a}} specialized cell, the ampulla cell, which had characteristics of myoepithelium. A plug or valve structure connected to the ampulla cell may regulate the output of the secretory material. The ampulla cell is able to contract and thus is probably under direct neuronal control. Other cells in the renette ampulla region of body cavity were termed supporting cells. Living, cold-relaxed nematodes were attached to sediment particles in the renette pore region and at the tail <b>tip.</b> <b>Release</b> from sediment particles was mechanical at the renette cell discharge site but appeared to be chemical at the caudal gland. In behavioral experiments, nematodes in a water current had the ability to release a thread from the caudal glands while maintaining contact with a sediment particle attached to the tail end. If the thread was strong enough, it also could be used to change location. Nematodes anchored by the thread from the caudal glands to a sediment particle could float in water currents until they attached themselves to another sediment particle with the help of secretions from the renette cells...|$|E

40|$|Authors: Leonie Misquitta, Qin Wei and Bruce M. Paterson This {{protocol}} {{was adapted from}} “Targeted Disruption of Gene Function in Drosophila by RNA Interference,” Chapter 19, in [*Drosophila Protocols*]([URL] (eds. Sullivan et al.). Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY, USA, 2000. Please note that {{this version of the}} protocol is a 2007 revision. ### INTRODUCTION RNA interference (RNAi) is a powerful method for determining the role of specific genes during *Drosophila* embryogenesis. This protocol describes a technique by which *Drosophila* embryos can be injected with dsRNA in order to disrupt targeted gene function. The approach is straightforward, utilizing improved methods for injecting the dsRNA directly through the chorion of the embryo. This strategy minimizes problems normally associated with desiccation of the dechorionated embryo and facilitates post-injection analysis of gene expression. ### RELATED INFORMATION The double-stranded RNA needed for RNAi is prepared as in [Preparation of Double-Stranded RNA for *Drosophila* RNA Interference (RNAi). ]([URL] Embryos are collected shortly before injection (typically, 30 - 60 min prior; see Collection of *Drosophila* Embryos for RNA Interference (RNAi)). This injection technique can also be used for generating transgenic *Drosophila* lines, as in [*Drosophila* RNA Interference (RNAi) Using a Gal- 4 Inducible Transgene Vector]([URL] (Misquitta et al. 2008). These procedures assume that the investigator has access to a working fly facility and is familiar with basic methods for injection of embryos and the analysis of gene expression in Drosophila embryos. If not, details for these procedures can be found elsewhere; see Ashburner (1989 a,b); for microinjection procedures, see Kiehart et al. (2000). ### MATERIALS **Reagents** 1. dsRNA mixed with filtered food dye, from Step 15 of [Preparation of Double-Stranded RNA for *Drosophila* RNA Interference (RNAi) ]([URL] - Embryos arrayed and dried onto glass slides, from [Collection of *Drosophila* Embryos for RNA Interference (RNAi) ]([URL] ### Equipment 1. Capillaries (glass; Frederick Haer and Co.) - *These capillaries are fiber-filled, which helps in fluid movement within the needle*. - Clay (modeling) - Collection basket (nylon mesh; see [Collection of *Drosophila* Embryos for RNA Interference (RNAi) ]([URL] for details of construction) - Incubator preset to 18 ºC- 22 ºC - Microcentrifuge tubes - Microinjector - *The {{protocol was}} developed using the Eppendorf Transjector Model 5246 (see Discussion), which has been replaced by the InjectMan NI 2 *. - Micromanipulator (Narishige model MN- 153) - Microscope for injection (Olympus CH- 2 or equivalent) - Moist chamber - *A humidified chamber for storage of the embryos during development can be constructed from a 150 -mL agar collection plate with lid. Five slides can be placed conveniently in the chamber*. - Needle puller (Model 730; David Kopf Instruments). - Petri dish (plastic, 150 -mm) - Pipette (e. g., Eppendorf P 10) - Pipette microtips (e. g., Eppendorf Microloader tips) - Table (stone, for microscope and injection apparatus) ### METHOD **Preparing the Needles** 1. To pull the glass capillaries into needles: - i. Set heat at 12. 5 - 13. 0 and set the solenoid at 4 on the needle puller. - ii. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for pulling the needles. - iii. Store freshly-pulled needles horizontally, embedded lightly on a flattened narrow strip of modeling clay placed on the bottom of a 150 -mm covered plastic Petri dish. - Use a pipette (e. g., Eppendorf P 10) fitted with a microtip (e. g., Eppendorf Microloader tips) to back-load the injection needles with 0. 5 - 1. 0 μL of dsRNA mixed with filtered food dye. **Calibrating the Transjector** 3. Set the Transjector to automatic injection. 4. Set the injection pressure (Po) to 450. 5. Set the compensation pressure (Pc) to 570. 6. Set the time of injections to 0. 1 sec. - *If using a different model injector, calibrate the injector according to the manufacturer’s instructions*. **Injecting Embryos** *Based on the volume loaded into the needle (0. 5 - 1. 0 μL), each embryo receives up to 100 - 200 pL of dsRNA. A typical loading, if the needle remains unbroken and unblocked, is good for the injection of approximately 1000 embryos or more*. *Inject the embryos in the posterior end, slightly off-center, because the posterior tip of the chorion is very hard and needles often break in this position. Keep the injection room at 18 °C to slow development*. 7. Break the filled needle against the edge of the slide containing the embryos to create a sharp point, as follows: - i. Move the slide slowly toward the needle tip while simultaneously depressing the “clean” button on the Transjector. - ii. The moment that the slide lightly taps the tip and the tip breaks, a small amount of the dye will leak from the needle <b>tip.</b> <b>Release</b> the “clean” button. - *Dye flow should stop when the “clean” button is no longer depressed. The sample is now ready for injection*. - *If the tip is too large after breakage, the needle will continue to drip dye when the “clean” button is not depressed. Such tips will destroy the embryos during injection*. 8. Bring the needle tip and the posterior tip of the embryo into the same focal plane. Make sure that the needle is positioned off-center with respect to the posterior tip of the embryo (see Fig. 1). ![Figure 1]([URL] "Figure 1 ") **Figure 1 **. Correct injection position for the embryos. (A) Do not inject the embryos directly in the posterior center of the chorion, as the needles often break at this site due to the apparent increased hardness of the chorion. (B) Embryos are injected in the posterior end, slightly off-center, with much less needle breakage or blockage. *For best results, inject the embryos with the needle at an angle slightly greater than 45 ° relative to the embryo surface in the posterior quarter of the embryo*. 9. Insert the needle just far enough to penetrate the vitelline membrane. 10. Inject the RNA into the embryo. A small amount of food dye will appear as a small dot in the posterior end of the embryo. It takes ~ 1 - 5 sec to inject each embryo. 11. After all the embryos on a slide have been injected, place the slide in a covered moist chamber at 18 ºC- 22 ºC until embryogenesis is complete (~ 48 h) or until the desired stage of development is reached. **Collecting Injected Embryos for Analysis** 12. Wash the embryos off the slide into a nylon-mesh collection basket. 13. Transfer the embryos to a microcentrifuge tube. 14. Fix the embryos and stain them using standard protocols; see Ashburner (1989 a,b). ### TROUBLESHOOTING 1. **Problem**: The injection needle becomes blocked. **[Step 10]** - **Solution**: To minimize capillary backflow and blockage, do not push the needle too far into the embryo; insert the needle just far enough to penetrate the vitelline membrane. If blockage should occur on the Transjector, immerse the needle tip in a drop of coverslip oil and hold down the “clean” button. When the needle clears, the food coloring will be visible in the oil. If blockage persists, change the needles. - **Problem**: Embryos fail to develop normally. **[Step 11]** -** Solution**: Keep the embryos moist after injection. Punctured embryos need a humid environment or they tend to shrink and dry up. Note that excessive moisture (e. g., embryos floating in water) will also kill the embryos. ### DISCUSSION The microinjector we use is the Eppendorf Transjector. Although primarily used for the injection of cultured cells, the Transjector is easily adapted for the injection of *Drosophila* embryos directly through the chorion. Highly reproducible injection conditions can be defined with regard to the volume of material injected, while preventing backflow of material into the needle, which results in needle blockage. This is accomplished by varying the injection pressure, compensation pressure, and the time of injection. The Transjector was a key factor in being able to routinely inject approximately 500 embryos for each analysis. It also has a useful “clean button” that uses a burst of high-pressure air to clean the needle tip in case of blockage. This greatly reduces the number of times needles need to be changed. In our studies, typical efficiencies for generation of the mutant phenotype in the embryo ranged from 72 % to 86 %, but penetration of the *white* mutation to the adult eye was < 3 % (Misquitta and Paterson 1999). RNAi has also been used in dechorionated embryos to demonstrate that both *frizzled* and *frizzled 2 * were in the *wingless* pathway (Kennerdell and Carthew 1998). However, dechorionated embryos have a much lower survival rate and injection artifacts are more pronounced. To rescue injected transgenic lines, apply a small amount of yeast paste to the slide and transfer the embryos from the paste to food vials. Recent experience has shown that using < 1 mg/mL of dsRNA for dsRNAs longer than 1 kb minimizes needle blockage while 1 mg/mL is suitable for dsRNAs shorter than 1 Kb in length. ### REFERENCES 1.
