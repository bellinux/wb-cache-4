Additionally, the mission scanner may double as a satellite digital imaging system (SDIS) operator. Larger aircraft may have additional scanners aboard, providing greater visual coverage. Because of the additional ARCHER equipment, the crew of a Civil Air Patrol GA8 Airvan may also include an operator of the ARCHER system, depending upon the requirements of the mission and the capabilities of the aircraft.|$|E

5|$|No.77 Squadron's <b>tasking</b> was {{controlled}} by the United States Fifth Air Force from the time it commenced operations in Korea, and this arrangement was not affected by the formation of No.91 Wing. It moved forward from Pohang to Yonpo, near Hamhung, in November 1950, continuing its support of UN forces as they advanced up the peninsula. North Korea's counter-attack, augmented by Chinese forces, led to the squadron being hurriedly withdrawn to Pusan on 3December. Poor radio communications with No.91 Wing dogged the evacuation from Yonpo, which was effected through US Air Force support supplementing the efforts of RAAF Dakotas. Cresswell believed that the Iwakuni-based wing headquarters was not always in tune with frontline requirements, and he often dealt directly with Lieutenant General Sir Horace Robertson, BCOF commander and the theatre's senior Australian officer, and the RAAF's Deputy Chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal Frederick Scherger.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, the US 1st Marine Division {{was holding}} firm against the Chinese 39th Army to the east, and the {{withdrawal}} of the South Koreans had left their flank exposed. However, with the Chinese 39th and 40th Armies only tasked with protecting the eastern flank of the 9th Army Group against possible counterattacks from the 1st Marine Division, the Chinese did not exploit this opportunity and the Americans remained relatively unmolested. Yet with the forward UN positions in both the US I Corps and US IX Corps sectors increasingly untenable as the Chinese exploited gaps between formations, Van Fleet ordered a withdrawal to the Kansas Line in the mid-morning. Hoge subsequently ordered the US Marines to form a new defensive position beyond the Pukhan River, between the Hwachon Reservoir and the new position to be occupied by the South Korean 6th Division. Hoge's plan relied on the South Koreans reforming and offering some resistance, and although a rearguard of 2,500 men was belatedly established it was in no condition to fight. Fearing a breakthrough, Hoge ordered the 27th Brigade, as the corps' reserve, to establish defensive positions north of Kapyong on the afternoon of 23 April as a precaution in the event the South Koreans were unable to hold, <b>tasking</b> them with blocking the two approaches to the village and to prevent the Chinese from cutting Route 17, a key route south to Seoul and an important main supply route.|$|E
5|$|No.36 Squadron {{commenced}} parachute trials {{with the}} Hercules in September 1960. Beginning in May 1962, RAAF forces based at Ubon, Thailand, under SEATO arrangements were supplied by a regular Hercules service. In December that year, the Hercules made their first troop-carrying flights into a combat zone, {{when one of}} No.36 Squadron's C-130s joined a Commonwealth airlift from Singapore to Borneo at the commencement of the Konfrontasi between Indonesia and Malaysia; similar missions would be undertaken for a further five years. In 1964, the first two Dassault MirageIII fighters to be assembled in Australia were flown in pieces from France to the Government Aircraft Factories at Avalon, Victoria, by RAAF Hercules. The same year, following the entry into Australian service of the de Havilland Canada DHC-4 Caribou with No.38 Squadron, No.486 Squadron was disbanded and its equipment and staff divided between Nos.36 and 38 Squadrons. The RAAF's force of twelve C-130A Hercules was augmented by twelve C-130Es commencing in August 1966. No.37 Squadron, disbanded in 1948, was re-formed at Richmond to operate the new models. No.486 Squadron was also re-formed to provide maintenance for both Hercules squadrons. No.36 Squadron's <b>tasking</b> was mainly domestic and tactical in nature, while No.37 Squadron's was overseas and strategic, owing to the longer range of its C-130Es. In May 1967, three Hercules of No.37 Squadron supported Operation Fast Caravan, the deployment of 23 Mirages of No.75 Squadron to Butterworth.|$|E

5|$|No.38 Squadron {{received}} the RAAF's first de Havilland Canada DHC-4 Caribou tactical transports in April 1964, replacing its Dakotas. The first six Caribous were despatched that August to South East Asia for {{service in the}} Vietnam War as RAAF Transport Flight Vietnam (RTFV). The same month, No.86 Wing was disbanded. Because the Caribous were primarily for support of the Australian Army, an overarching wing headquarters for the Caribous and Hercules was now considered inappropriate. No.486 Squadron was also disbanded and its equipment and staff divided between Nos.36 and 38 Squadrons, which along with AMTF became independently operating units {{under the command of}} Headquarters RAAF Base Richmond. Following the re-establishment at Richmond of No.37 Squadron in February 1966, flying C-130E Hercules, No.486 Squadron was re-formed to provide maintenance for both Hercules squadrons. As No.36 Squadron's <b>tasking</b> was mainly tactical and No.37 Squadron's strategic (owing to the longer range of its C-130Es), forming the Hercules units into a new wing was not deemed necessary. Still based at Richmond, the Hercules provided long-range transport and medical evacuation services to and from South East Asia during the Vietnam War. No.36 Squadron's C-130As were replaced by C-130H models in 1978. RTFV was re-formed as No.35 Squadron in June 1966, and continued to serve in Vietnam until Australian forces were withdrawn in 1972; it was then based in Richmond until 1976, when it relocated to RAAF Base Townsville, Queensland. No.38 Squadron meanwhile continued to operate Caribous out of Richmond until 1992, when it transferred to RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland. In the Vietnam and post-Vietnam eras, along with their military transport duties, the Hercules and Caribou undertook disaster relief operations throughout Australia and the Pacific.|$|E

40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2015. Includes bibliographical references. This {{dissertation}} study takes {{a holistic}} approach to the act of <b>task</b> performance, investigating how <b>task</b> and learner variables independently and interactively influence <b>task</b> performance and <b>task</b> experience. Drawing on Robinson’s (2001 b) triadic componential framework for <b>task</b> design, the study explores the <b>task</b> demands that are inherent to <b>tasks</b> (<b>task</b> complexity) or that emerge in task–learner interaction (<b>task</b> difficulty). <b>Task</b> complexity and modality were adopted as <b>task</b> feature variables, while goal orientation (Dweck, 1986), the L 2 motivational self system (Dörnyei, 2009 b), and L 2 anxiety were adopted as learner variables. <b>Task</b> performance was examined in terms of complexity, accuracy, and fluency (CAF), and <b>task</b> experience was represented by flow, conditioned by optimal challenge (Csikszentmihalyi, 1987). With the mediation of <b>task</b> difficulty, this study examines the relative contributions of <b>task</b> and learner variables to <b>task</b> performance and <b>task</b> experience. In a repeated-measures design, 141 L 2 learners performed four argumentative <b>tasks</b> that differed in <b>task</b> complexity and modality. They completed two questionnaires, one a pre-task survey examining dispositional motivation {{and the other a}} post-task survey probing their subjective experience with the <b>task.</b> Production data were analyzed to measure complexity (i. e., the clause per T-unit ratio), accuracy (i. e., the error-free clause per T-unit ratio), and fluency (i. e., pause frequency per T-unit). MANOVAs, correlation analysis, and structural equation modeling (SEM) were conducted. The results indicate that although <b>task</b> complexity affected the perception of <b>task</b> difficulty, it did not affect <b>task</b> performance in terms of CAF nor <b>task</b> experience of flow. <b>Task</b> modality significantly predicted <b>task</b> performance and <b>task</b> experience of flow. Significant relationships among motivational constructs were observed, but learner variables did not have a direct impact on immediate <b>task</b> performance or experience. These findings suggest that <b>task</b> variables have a stronger impact than learner variables on both language learning outcomes and affective outcomes of <b>tasks.</b> The study’s multifaceted investigation provides insight into how various motivational and affective constructs work together and interact with various <b>task</b> features to produce unique <b>task</b> performance experiences and performance outcomes...|$|R
