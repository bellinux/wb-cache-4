25|$|Nicholas {{wakes up}} to find himself entombed alive in a {{cemetery}} in Mexico. He sells his gold watch to escape. He returns to find his mansion foreclosed {{and most of his}} possessions removed. He retrieves a hidden gun and seeks the aid of his ex-wife. While talking with her and apologizing for his neglect and mistreatment, he discovers that Jim Feingold, the CRS employee who had conducted his psychological tests, is an actor working in television advertisements. Nicholas locates Feingold and forces him to find CRS's real office, whereupon he takes Christine hostage. Nicholas demands to be taken to the leader of CRS. Attacked by CRS troops, Nicholas takes Christine to the roof and bars <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>behind</b> <b>them.</b> The CRS troops begin cutting through the door. Christine realizes that Nicholas's gun is not a prop and is terrified. She frantically tells Nicholas that the conspiracy is a hoax, a fiction that is just part of the game, that his finances are intact, and that his family and friends are waiting {{on the other side of}} the door. He refuses to believe her. The door bursts open, and Nicholas shoots the first person to emerge—Conrad, bearing an open bottle of champagne. Devastated, Nicholas leaps off the roof, just as his late father did.|$|E
500|$|The Doctor {{temporarily}} {{brings the}} two Amys {{into the same}} time stream by having them synchronise their thoughts whilst having Rory manipulate the time engines. Rory's glasses begin to malfunction due to feedback from the paradox, forcing {{the three of them}} to race through the complex amongst several Handbots to reach the TARDIS without the Doctor's assistance. [...] As they near its location, the older Amy falls back to protect the other two, but the younger Amy runs into a Handbot and is sedated. As the older Amy covers his back, Rory takes the younger Amy into the TARDIS. Once they are inside the Doctor slams <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>behind</b> <b>them</b> and admits to Rory that it is impossible for both Amys to exist in the same timestream. Rory must now choose which Amy he wants. Rory and the older Amy have a tearful farewell at the TARDIS door before the older Amy tells him to move on without her. The older Amy then allows herself to be taken by the Handbots. Amy wakes up and asks [...] "Where is she?", and the Doctor leaves Rory to explain to her.|$|E
