5|$|In {{addition}} to foreign dignitaries, the President's Guest House {{has traditionally been}} made available by the outgoing President of the United States to the President-elect in the five days prior to his inauguration. In 1992, Bill Clinton chose {{to stay at the}} Hay–Adams Hotel instead of the guest house and, in 2009, a request by President-elect Barack Obama to <b>take-up</b> residence at the President's Guest House two weeks early was rejected because of its prior commitment to former Australian prime minister John Howard.|$|E
5|$|The Alpine chough , or yellow-billed chough, (Pyrrhocorax graculus) is {{a bird in}} {{the crow}} family, {{one of only two}} species in the genus Pyrrhocorax. Its two {{subspecies}} breed in high mountains from Spain eastwards through southern Europe and North Africa to Central Asia and Nepal, and it may nest at a higher altitude than any other bird. The eggs have adaptations to the thin atmosphere that improve oxygen <b>take-up</b> and reduce water loss.|$|E
5|$|Every three months, the Trylon Cinema {{publishes a}} full {{schedule}} of screenings, approximately 10 {{percent of which}} are of first run films. The venue features a variety of regular exhibitions, ranging from the Trash Film Debauchery series of B movies, to the Defenders in which local cinephiles curate and defend screenings of personal favorite cult films, to Sound Unseen, a documentary project covering behind-the-scenes aspects of musicians' creative processes. The Trylon also hosts showcases of the films throughout various directors' careers. <b>Take-Up</b> Productions continues to use other venues such as the Heights and the Riverview for screenings necessitating larger houses. The Cinema is staffed almost entirely with volunteers.|$|E
5|$|Minneapolis's Oak Street Cinema, a volunteer-run {{repertory}} cinema, ran films {{seven days}} per week until cutbacks in programming {{had to be made}} for financial reasons. A collective of the Oak Street volunteers formed <b>Take-Up</b> Productions, which was established to promote showing films not typically screened in larger movie houses. The organization began with outdoor screenings, starting with Watermelon Man, which was projected against a white brick wall behind a coffee shop, and then began to rent out theaters throughout the Minneapolis–Saint Paul area, including the Riverview, Heights, and Parkway. Some screenings, such as that of Lawrence of Arabia and a series of Alfred Hitchcock films, drew hundreds of viewers.|$|E
5|$|The Trylon Cinema (formerly Trylon Microcinema) is a 92-seat {{movie theater}} in the Longfellow {{neighborhood}} of Minneapolis, Minnesota. The cinema was founded and is currently run by <b>Take-Up</b> Productions, a group of volunteers who got their start at the Oak Street Cinema before establishing the Trylon in 2009 within a former warehouse. A 2017 expansion led {{to an increase in}} the cinema's seating capacity and accessibility. Throughout its history, the venue has featured a variety of regular programming, ranging from career retrospectives of famous directors to B movies and cult films. The Trylon has been well received by critics who have praised its film lineup, intimacy, and atmosphere.|$|E
25|$|If <b>take-up</b> {{continues}} {{at this rate}} it might be easier to make the scheme compulsory, thereby removing the employer compliance costs associated with people opting out.|$|E
25|$|Alistair Darling, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, {{stated that}} UK taxpayers {{would benefit from}} the government's rescue plan, as it will have some control over RBS in {{exchange}} for £5 billion in preference shares and underwriting the issuance of a further £15 billion in ordinary shares. If shareholder <b>take-up</b> of the share issue was 0%, then total government ownership in RBS would be 58%; and, if shareholder <b>take-up</b> was 100%, then total government ownership in RBS would be 0%. Less than 56million new shares were taken up by investors, or 0.24pc of the total offered by RBS in October 2008.|$|E
25|$|Although the IBA {{required}} 49% {{of the new}} {{station to}} be owned locally by companies and individuals, the <b>take-up</b> was nowhere near as expected, leaving companies outside the region to buy shares including DC Thomson (15%), Ladbrokes (10%), Pergamon (9%) and British Rail (2%).|$|E
25|$|In 2013 Virgin Atlantic {{introduced}} its 'Little Red' short-haul brand to <b>take-up</b> {{some of the}} available Heathrow and Gatwick slots. Manchester was the inaugural destination, with services were operated by aircraft 'wet-leased' from Aer Lingus. However, these services ceased in March 2015 due to low popularity.|$|E
25|$|Immigration is the {{international}} movement of people into a destination country {{of which they are}} not natives or where they do not possess citizenship in order to settle or reside there, especially as permanent residents or naturalized citizens, or to <b>take-up</b> employment as a migrant worker or temporarily as a foreign worker.|$|E
25|$|Where {{there are}} {{additional}} properties, only the main property {{will have the}} relief applied. The relief must be actively applied for by completion of a form available from each local council. A bill to make {{the application of the}} relief mandatory was not passed into legislation although it would have led to a greater <b>take-up</b> of this assistance.|$|E
25|$|Immigration to the United States is the {{international}} movement of individuals who are not natives or do not possess citizenship in order to settle, reside, study or to <b>take-up</b> employment in the United States. It {{has been a major}} source of population growth and cultural change throughout much {{of the history of the}} United States.|$|E
25|$|Purchases between tenants and landlords were {{negotiated}} by Sheehan and the ILLA branches after O'Brien and Sheehan formed a Cork Advisory Committee in September 1904, to mediate between landlords and tenants in their negotiations. They thereby achieved purchase terms with low interest annuities which produced an exceptionally high <b>take-up</b> of land purchase. Munster tenants availed of land purchase in higher numbers {{than in any}} other province.|$|E
25|$|Several of Granada's {{programmes}} administered their websites using G-Wizz, including This Morning, Coronation Street and Emmerdale. Its Flash-heavy {{pages were}} mostly unusable by subscribers, who were then still largely modem-based, and <b>take-up</b> was low. Less {{than a year}} after it opened, Granada closed G-Wizz in March 2001, after it had cost the company £9million. It combined the remainder of its online presence with fellow ITV company Carlton to launch itv.com.|$|E
25|$|While {{the second}} city status {{of any country}} is decided upon a variety of {{economic}} or cultural indices, both Birmingham and Manchester have shown an edge in each over the years. For example, in 2010, Manchester City Centre became second to London for new office building <b>take-up</b> with almost a million square foot (86,400m2) occupied in the year, whilst praise for Birmingham's striking modern architecture was cited as confirmation of its claim to second city status.|$|E
25|$|During {{his second}} reading speech, then-Premier of Tasmania David Bartlett said the <b>take-up</b> rates were 'a good early result'; however, {{he said it}} was 'important to {{increase}} the participation rate'. In his closing remarks, Bartlett said ' NBN in Tasmania is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to create jobs and contribute to a new economic direction'. In her second reading speech on behalf of the Tasmanian Opposition, Elise Archer said 'the NBN is an important infrastructure', but that 'the State Liberals have some concern that the NBN business model seems to rely more and more on eliminating competition and other technologies'.|$|E
25|$|A common {{application}} of a torque motor would be the supply- and <b>take-up</b> reel motors in a tape drive. In this application, driven from a low voltage, the characteristics of these motors allow a relatively constant light tension {{to be applied to}} the tape whether or not the capstan is feeding tape past the tape heads. Driven from a higher voltage, (and so delivering a higher torque), the torque motors can also achieve fast-forward and rewind operation without requiring any additional mechanics such as gears or clutches. In the computer gaming world, torque motors are used in force feedback steering wheels.|$|E
25|$|The Correcting Selectric II used a new ribbon {{cartridge}} mechanism. The cartridge contained both supply and <b>take-up</b> spools, permitting both easy ribbon {{changes and the}} use of several types of ribbon on one machine. The ribbons were wider than had been used previously, giving more typed characters per inch of ribbon. Successive characters were staggered vertically on the ribbon, which incremented less than a full character position each time. Different types of ribbons had different-depth holes {{in the bottom of the}} cartridge, which set the mechanism to advance the ribbon by the amount appropriate for the type of ribbon.|$|E
25|$|The Minox cameras project {{an image}} of 8×11mm onto the negative. The film is in strips 9.2mm wide, or less than one-quarter the size of 35 mm film, and unlike 35mm film, it has no {{sprocket}} holes. This film strip is rolled up in the supply side chamber of a small twin chamber cartridge, with the film leader taped to a <b>take-up</b> spool in the take up chamber. The film strips can be up to 50 frames in length for Riga Minox and Minox II, III, IIIs and B cameras. From Minox BL and C cameras onward the Minox film cartridge holds 15, 30, or 36 exposures.|$|E
25|$|In most cassettes, the {{magnetic}} tape {{is attached to}} each spool with a leader, usually made of strong plastic. This leader protected the weaker magnetic tape from the shock occurring when the tape reached the end. Leaders can be complex: a plastic slide-in wedge anchors a short fully opaque plastic tape to the <b>take-up</b> hub; one or more tinted semi-opaque plastic segments follow; the clear leader (a tintless semi-opaque plastic segment) follows, which wraps almost {{all the way around}} the supply reel, before splicing to {{the magnetic}} tape itself. The clear leader spreads the shock load to a long stretch of tape instead of to the microscopic splice. Various patents have been issued detailing leader construction and associated tape player mechanisms to detect leaders. Cassette tape users would also use spare leaders to repair broken tapes.|$|E
25|$|Most modern sewing {{machines}} use the lockstitch technique of sewing invented by Walter Hunt, {{which consists of}} two threads, an upper and a lower. The upper thread runs from a spool kept on a spindle on top of or next to the machine, through a tension mechanism, a <b>take-up</b> arm, and finally {{through the hole in}} the needle. The lower thread is wound onto a bobbin, which is inserted into a case in the lower section of the machine. Walter Hunt invented the first lock-stitch sewing machine in 1833. Hunt lost interest and did not patent his invention. In 1846, Elias Howe secured a patent on an original lock-stitch machine, and failed to manufacture and market it. Isaac Singer infringed on Howe's patent to make his own machine, making him wealthy. Elias Howe filed a lawsuit, alleging patent infringement. On July 1, 1854, a federal commission ruled in favor of Howe, ordering Isaac Singer as well as all sewing machine makers to pay Elias Howe royalties.|$|E
25|$|If, as {{evidence}} indicates, sexual reproduction arose {{very early in}} eukaryotic evolution, the essential features of meiosis may have already been present in the prokaryotic ancestors of eukaryotes. In extant organisms, proteins with central functions in meiosis are similar to key proteins in bacterial transformation. For example, recA recombinase, that catalyses the key functions of DNA homology search and strand exchange in the bacterial sexual process of transformation, has orthologs in eukaryotes that perform similar functions in meiotic recombination (see Wikipedia articles RecA, RAD51 and DMC1). Both bacterial transformation and meiosis in eukaryotic microorganisms are induced by stressful circumstances such as overcrowding, resource depletion and DNA damaging conditions. This suggests that these sexual processes are adaptations for dealing with stress, particularly stress that causes DNA damage. In bacteria, these stresses induce an altered physiologic state, termed competence, that allows active <b>take-up</b> of DNA from a donor bacterium and the integration of this DNA into the recipient genome (see Natural competence) allowing recombinational repair of the recipients’ damaged DNA. If environmental stresses leading to DNA damage were a persistent challenge {{to the survival of}} early microorganisms, then selection would likely have been continuous through the prokaryote to eukaryote transition, and adaptative adjustments would have followed a course in which bacterial transformation naturally gave rise to sexual reproduction in eukaryotes.|$|E
25|$|In 1495, the Alcaidaria-mor (similar to the Spanish alcalde) of {{the castle}} {{was given to the}} Captain-major of Angra, who lived there for a while. Later, it would become the {{residence}} of his trusted lieutenant, who was paid a stipend and obliged to <b>take-up</b> residence. Eventually the castle's Alcaidaria-mor was integrated into Captaincy of Angra, when it began {{to be known as the}} Castle of São Cristóvão (1582). It was during the reigns of King John III (1521–1557) and King Sebastian (1568–1578) that the first defensive plans were drawn-up by military engineer Tommaso Benedetto (in 1567). The Italian architect engineer concentrated on a global defense plan for the main islands of the Azores, concentrating the defenses at the ports and anchorages. Consequently, the old castle/fort served little use, and his successor, Ciprião de Figueiredo e Vasconcelos, doubled his efforts with fifty defensive works along the coast of the island. Its strategic role further degenerated, with many of its dependencies used to store gunpowder for Angra, transferred from the Praça Velha for security reasons. Father António Cordeiro (1641-1722), wrote {{of the castle}}'s ruins in his História Insulana, identifying that only the walls remained of the structure, which was also identified by Father Maldonando. The small medieval fort, therefore, was slowly substituted by the coastal defenses of the Fort of São Sebastião and Fort of Santo António, with the latter strategically located at the edge of Monte Brasil (and which created a crossfire zone with the first, to secure the bay).|$|E
500|$|In 2010 the {{government}} created a digital action plan which was delivered in [...] November 2013. On 16 December 2013 they announced that [...] "now {{is not the}} time to commit to a switchover". An updated report was released in January 2014. Since 2010 Ofcom has produced annual reports on the <b>take-up</b> of digital radio.|$|E
500|$|Albert Mayer led {{the next}} major project: the {{creation}} of a lightweight reflex camera adaptable to either handheld or studio conditions. [...] After four years of development, the Panaflex debuted in 1972. [...] A revolutionary camera that operated quietly, the Panaflex eliminated the need for a cumbersome sound blimp, and could synchronize handheld work. [...] The Panaflex also included a digital electronic tachometer and magazine motors for the <b>take-up</b> reel. Steven Spielberg's The Sugarland Express (1974) was the first motion picture filmed with the Panaflex.|$|E
500|$|Barry Kryshka of <b>Take-Up</b> Productions, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, oversees {{and manages}} the Trylon. The cinema sits {{in an old}} {{warehouse}} in the Longfellow neighborhood along Minnehaha Avenue that was rented, in 2009, {{at a rate of}} $800 a month. Kryshka contracted Bright Star Systems, Inc. to retrofit the space with 50 old rocking seats purchased from a nearby cinema chain, a [...] projection screen, two 35 mm movie projectors, and a minute concessions stand. Trylon acquired its name from an eponymous theater in Kryshka's native Queens, New York, itself named for the Trylon sculpture at the 1939 New York World's Fair. Founded as Trylon Microcinema, the movie house opened on the weekend of July 17–18, 2009, with a showing of Sherlock Jr. featuring live musical accompaniment from Dreamland Faces, a local accordion–musical saw duo. Each of the venue's first 12 showings sold out.|$|E
500|$|In 1992, Panavision {{launched}} {{a project to}} develop a camera that involved rethinking {{every aspect of the}} company's existing 35mm system. [...] Nolan Murdock and Albert Mayer Sr. headed up the design team. The new Millennium camera, replacing the Platinum as the company's flagship, was introduced in 1997. The Millennium XL came to the market in 1999 and was led by Al Mayer, Jr. [...] It soon established itself as Panavision’s new 35mm workhorse. [...] The XL was the first product in Panavision history to win both an Academy Award and a Primetime Emmy Award within the first year of official release. [...] The update to the XL, the XL2 was initially released in 2004[...] [...] The first feature films to use these latter two systems were, respectively, The Perfect Storm (2000) and Just Like Heaven (2005). The XL series not only had a much smaller camera body—making it suitable for studio, handheld, and steadicam work—but also marked the first significant change to the film transport mechanism in the camera since the Panaflex: two smaller sprocket drums for feed and <b>take-up</b> (a design similar to the Moviecam and subsequent Arricam) instead of one large drum to do both. As of 2006, Panavision has no further plans to develop additional film camera models.|$|E
500|$|Suharto {{proceeded}} with various social engineering projects designed to transform Indonesian society into a de-politicized [...] "floating mass" [...] {{supportive of the}} national mission of [...] "development", a concept similar to corporatism. The government formed various civil society groups to unite the populace in support of government programs. For instance, the government created Korpri (Korps Pegawai Republik Indonesia) in November 1971 as union of civil servants to ensure their loyalty, organized the FBSI (Federasi Buruh Seluruh Indonesia) as the only legal labour union in February 1973, and established the MUI in 1975 to control Islamic clerics. In 1966 to 1967, to promote assimilation of the influential Chinese-Indonesians, the Suharto government passed several laws as part of so-called [...] "Basic Policy for the Solution of Chinese Problem", whereby only one Chinese-language publication (controlled by the army) was allowed to continue, all Chinese cultural and religious expressions (including display of Chinese characters) were prohibited from public space, Chinese schools were phased-out, and the ethnic-Chinese were encouraged to <b>take-up</b> Indonesian-sounding names. In 1968, Suharto commenced the very successful family-planning program (Keluarga Berentjana / KB) to stem the huge population growth rate and hence increasing per-capita income. A lasting legacy from this period is the spelling reform of Indonesian language decreed by Suharto on 17 August 1972.|$|E
2500|$|With {{comparisons}} {{being made}} with an equivalent Chinese TLD of [...]中国, it was anticipated that <b>take-up</b> of a Russian Cyrillic TLD could outstrip {{demand for the}} Latin alphabet equivalent, [...]ru. As of 2014 however, [...]ru has five times as many registrations as [...]рф.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} Contender designs have {{an adjustable}} trigger, allowing the shooter to change both <b>take-up</b> and overtravel, permitting user {{selection of a}} range of trigger pulls ranging from a fairly heavy trigger pull suitable for carrying the pistol while hunting to a [...] "hair trigger" [...] suitable for long range target shooting (see accurize).|$|E
2500|$|Across Australia 8.4% of {{estimated}} dwellings lodged online. [...] The {{highest percentage}} of internet lodgements was in the Australian Capital Territory with 14.8% of households using eCensus. [...] This was a markedly different proportion of households than elsewhere in Australia, with the other states and territory ranging from 5.9% <b>take-up</b> in the Northern Territory to 8.9% in Western Australia.|$|E
2500|$|Large {{employers}}—even large employers {{that were}} self-insured—were increasingly dropping health insurance {{as an employee}} benefit and/or restricting it to [...] "full-time employees such that the [...] "take up rate" [...] of healthcare insurance by employees was dropping. However, the drop in <b>take-up</b> rate actually accelerated after passage of the law {{although there is no}} demonstrable relationship between the law's passage and the accelerated drop.|$|E
2500|$|A single set trigger {{is usually}} one trigger {{that may be}} fired with a {{conventional}} amount of trigger pull weight or may be [...] "set" [...] – usually by pushing forward on the trigger, or by pushing forward on a small lever attached {{to the rear of}} the trigger. This takes up the trigger slack (or otherwise called <b>take-up)</b> in the trigger and allows for a much lighter trigger pull. This is colloquially known as a hair trigger.|$|E
2500|$|Two {{persistent}} misunderstandings about RDF {{developed at}} this time: firstly, {{due to the}} MCF influence and the RDF [...] "Resource Description" [...] acronym, the idea that RDF was specifically for use in representing metadata; secondly that RDF was an XML format rather than a data model, and only the RDF/XML serialisation being XML-based. RDF saw little <b>take-up</b> in this period, but there was significant work done in Bristol, around ILRT at Bristol University and HP Labs, and in Boston at MIT. RSS 1.0 and FOAF became exemplar applications for RDF in this period.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the decade}} that followed, another gentleman applied {{his mind to}} {{advancing}} {{the state of the}} art. [...] Scottish immigrant Robert Whitehill (1 June 1845 – 24 November 1903), founder of the Whitehill Manufacturing Company, became interested in sewing machines and subsequently patented an improvement to the <b>take-up</b> arm. [...] He proceeded to manufacture his own machines from about 1875 until 1883. [...] He then designed the sewing machine which would shortly become Singer's answer to the White machine. [...] He applied for patent on 1 July 1884 and received US patent 326821 on 22 September 1885.|$|E
2500|$|Hegermann {{used the}} Nøkken {{as a private}} yacht until it was sold to the London Missionary Society (LMS) in 1874. The Reverend Samuel Macfarlane persuaded Miss Baxter, of Dundee, to donate £3,000 for the steamer, {{renaming}} it after her own home [...] "Ellengowan". Macfarlane wanted the Ellengowan for missionary work in New Guinea. Departing from Somerset, Cape York Peninsula, the work began with a trip to Anuapata (Port Moresby) in November 1874, to establish the first mission in New Guinea. W. G. Lawes, a missionary with LMS, his wife and the Reverend A.W. Murray travelled on this first trip. Lawes later became the first European missionary to <b>take-up</b> residence in Port Morseby.|$|E
