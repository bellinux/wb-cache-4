40|$|Abstract: This paper {{examines}} {{a problem}} related <b>to</b> <b>replenishing</b> inventories at retailers in distribution networks operated under {{the paradigm of}} Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI). In the real world, complexity in analysing such systems arises out of numerous factors, including several random variables and a multitude of costs in the system. Much of the literature makes simplifying assumptions about these factors to develop tractable mathematical models. In this paper, we develop a simulation-optimisation approach that can accommodate most of these factors. In our experiments, our approach outperforms a heuristic used in a local industry and a heuristic developed from the newsvendor model...|$|R

50|$|The {{player is}} unable to shoot, their only defense being to {{detonate}} their ship {{in the vicinity of}} the enemy. Enemies appear in randomized patterns, and the aim is to position and detonate at the right moment, setting off a chain reaction of explosions and earning a combo bonus. Blowing oneself up takes away from one's overall 'stock', or number of bombs, with a new bomb being gained after the player gains a certain amount of points, which increases after each new bomb. Earning a considerable combo is key <b>to</b> <b>replenishing</b> the stock of lives, and so gameplay revolves around striking the correct balance between risk and reward.|$|R
