60|$|This is, indeed, {{a terrible}} disappointment, {{and is very}} discouraging, and the more so, because it cannot be recalled; for a {{partnership}} is like matrimony, it is almost engaged in {{for better or for}} worse, till the years expire; there is no breaking it off, at least, not easily nor fairly, but all the inconveniences which are to be feared will follow and stare in your face: as, first, the partner in the first place draws out all his stock; and this sometimes is a blow fatal enough, for perhaps the partner cannot take the whole trade upon himself, and cannot carry on the trade upon his own stock: if he could, he would not have taken in a partner at all. This withdrawing <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> <b>has</b> sometimes been very dangerous to a partner; nay, has many times been the overthrow and undoing of him and of the family that is left.|$|E

60|$|Tell {{my friend}} Allan (for I {{am sure that}} we only want the trifling {{circumstance}} of being known to one another {{to be the best}} friends on earth) that I much suspect he has, in his plates, mistaken the figure of the stock and horn. I have, at last, gotten one; but it is a very rude instrument. It is composed of three parts; the stock, which is the hinder thigh-bone of a sheep, such as you see in a mutton-ham, the horn, which is a common Highland cow's horn, cut off at the smaller end, until the aperture be large enough to admit the stock to be pushed up through the horn, until it be held by the thicker end of the thigh-bone; and, lastly, an oaten reed exactly cut and notched like that which you see every shepherd boy have, when the corn stems are green and full-grown. The reed is not made fast in the bone, but is held up by the lips, and plays loose in the smaller end of the stock; while the stock, with the horn hanging on its larger end, is held by the hands in playing. <b>The</b> <b>stock</b> <b>has</b> six or seven ventiges on the upper side, and one back ventige, like the common flute. This of mine was made by a man from the Braes of Athole, and is exactly what the shepherds wont to use in that country.|$|E
60|$|All along Black River the 'Susie' {{has been}} visited by scores of planters, whose tales are the {{repetition}} of those already heard of suffering and loss. An old planter, who has lived on the river since 1844, said there never was such a rise, and he was satisfied more than one quarter of <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> <b>has</b> been lost. Luckily the people cared first for their work stock, and when they could find it horses and mules were housed {{in a place of}} safety. The rise which still continues, and was two inches last night, compels them to get them out to the hills; hence it is that the work of General York is of such a great value. From daylight to late at night he is going this way and that, cheering by his kindly words and directing with calm judgment what is to be done. One unpleasant story, of a certain merchant in New Orleans, is told all along the river. It appears for some years past the planters have been dealing with this individual, and many of them had balances in his hands. When the overflow came they wrote for coffee, for meal, and, in fact, for such little necessities as were required. No response to these letters came, and others were written, and yet these old customers, with plantations under water, were refused even what was necessary to sustain life. It is needless to say he is not popular now on Back River.|$|E
