5|$|By age 11, he had {{exhausted}} {{the mathematical}} knowledge of two {{college students who}} were lodgers at his home. He was later lent a book by S. L. Loney on advanced trigonometry. He mastered this {{by the age of}} 13 while discovering sophisticated theorems on his own. By 14, he was receiving merit certificates and academic awards that continued throughout his school career, and he assisted the school in the logistics of assigning its 1200 students (each with differing needs) to its 35-odd teachers. He completed mathematical exams in half the allotted time, and showed a familiarity with geometry and infinite series. Ramanujan was shown how <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> cubic equations in 1902; he developed his own method <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> the quartic. The following year, Ramanujan tried <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> the quintic, not knowing that it could not be solved by radicals.|$|E

5|$|In {{computer}} science, {{simulations of}} evolution using evolutionary algorithms and artificial life {{started in the}} 1960s and were extended with simulation of artificial selection. Artificial evolution became a widely recognised optimisation method {{as a result of}} the work of Ingo Rechenberg in the 1960s. He used evolution strategies <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> complex engineering problems. Genetic algorithms in particular became popular through the writing of John Henry Holland. Practical applications also include automatic evolution of computer programmes. Evolutionary algorithms are now used <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> multi-dimensional problems more efficiently than software produced by human designers and also to optimise the design of systems.|$|E

In this paper we will discuss an approach <b>to</b> <b>solving</b> optimization problems based on specialization of an abstract dynamic programming algorithm. This provides not only reuse of the algorithm, but also reuse of its proof. Application of dynamic programming includes Matrix chain multiplication and Largest black square.
