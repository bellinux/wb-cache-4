This thesis aims to {{describe}} 1) whether {{and to what}} extent the optimizing of Mind Mapping can improve students’ <b>thinking</b> <b>skill</b> in reading comprehension; 2) the difficulties of the implementation of Mind Mapping to improve students’ <b>thinking</b> <b>skill</b> in reading comprehension. This action research is conducted collaboratively with one of reading lecturer of IKIP PGRI Madiun, in 4 A class. This action research was carried out in two cycles which consist of planning, implementing, observing and reflecting. The qualitative data are collected using field notes, diary, questionnaire,interview and documentation. Then, the qualitative data are analyzed through data reduction, data display, and conclusion and verification. The quantitative data are collected using test. The test consists of pre-test and post test. The quantitative data are analyzed through descriptive statistics to compare the result of pre-test and post test. The research findings show that Mind Mapping can improve students’ <b>thinking</b> <b>skill</b> in reading comprehension such as: 1) the mean score of the students’ <b>thinking</b> <b>skill</b> was increased from 80, 7 to 96, 6 and all of students’ scores were higher than the passing grade; 2) the total of students’ right answer of each <b>thinking</b> <b>skill</b> indicator was increased such as: part-whole relation from 192 to 228, conclusion from 141 to 192, similarities from 172 to 200 and differences from 181 to 203; 3) in the implementation of mind mapping, the students got some difficulties such as: the students were confused when they cannot find supporting statements in all of their articles, they were confused to choose the key words or shorten the sentences for the mind mapping step 3, and they were confused to put the key words in mind mapping step 3, It was quite difficult to find articles with the same topic but comes from different resources that consist of the same subtopics inside it as seen in the interview result in attachment, It was needed 2 meetings to do all the mind mapping process that means the mind mapping technique is time consuming.

Billed as doing [...] "for China what Katherine Mayo did for Mother India", Townsend's book included a controversial critique of Chinese society and culture. At a time when China was in the grip civil strife, Townsend believed that the source of its problems lay in fundamental defects in the ethics of its people, including above all their propensity for dishonesty, lack of fixed loyalties outside of their family group, and inability to cooperate effectively with one another, as well as their greed, physical cowardice, and lack of critical <b>thinking</b> <b>skills.</b> He concludes that the [...] "outstanding characteristics" [...] of the Chinese people [...] "neither enable other peoples to deal satisfactorily with them, nor enable the Chinese to deal satisfactorily with themselves" [...] and predicts no end to chaotic conditions within the country. He also favorably contrasts what he considers Japan's sensible policies toward China with the naively [...] "sentimentalist" [...] ones adopted by the United States.|$|E

Early episodes focused on basic subjects such as colors and numbers, but later the programs focused on math, physics, anatomy, and astronomy. The show's producers believed that comprehension and attention were strongly connected, so they wrote the episodes to encourage and increase their viewers' attention. They used content and production characteristics such as pacing which gave children time to respond, as well as [...] "camera techniques, children's voices, musical cues, sound effects, clear transitions, repeatable dialogue, and visuals." [...] Participation, {{in the form of}} spoken or physical response from the audience, and the mastery of <b>thinking</b> <b>skills</b> were encouraged by the use of repetition, both within {{the structure of}} individual episodes and across multiple episodes. The producers used a variety of formal features, which were auditory, and content features, which consisted of invitations given to the audience, such as [...] "Will you help?" [...] The features were also in the form of both recurrent and unique formats and content. The purpose of the recurrent formats and content, which were similar in every episode, was to increase viewers' attention, comprehension, and participation during key educational lessons.|$|E
500|$|Townsend had {{asserted}} {{in chapter}} {{one that the}} cause of China's present misery lies in the fundamental defects that exist in the ethnic characteristics of the Chinese people and in chapters three and four he explains what he believes these defects are. Townsend states that dishonesty is [...] "the most prominent characteristic in the Chinese mentality as opposed to our own". Townsend gives many examples of him being lied to by Chinese employees, coolies, shopkeepers, and government officials, and notes that many other consuls were driven out of the service by this relentless and [...] "aimless lying, with each lie merely a pretext for another". The other highly salient trait of the Chinese is their [...] "indifference to fellow suffering". Through a large number of personal and second-hand anecdotes, Townsend argues that the Chinese may be the only {{people in the world who}} are completely unable to comprehend the basic human impulses of sympathy or gratitude toward other people. Because the Chinese feel no empathy toward others, they behave in an unbelievably sadistic and cruel fashion toward one another, and they view altruistic foreigners as targets to be mercilessly taken advantage of. Other traits Townsend identifies as being typically Chinese are cowardice, [...] lust for money, lack of a sense of personal hygiene, lack of critical <b>thinking</b> <b>skills,</b> insincerity, and obsession with hollow rites. Townsend believes that these traits are as notable among China's leaders and educated strata as much as they are in the poor masses, and his analysis of historical documents leads him to believe that they are not a recent product of the present chaos, but rather are deeply ingrained traits of China's national character. He concludes that the [...] "outstanding characteristics" [...] of the Chinese people [...] "neither enable other peoples to deal satisfactorily with them, nor enable the Chinese to deal satisfactorily with themselves." ...|$|E

There are three procedures in this research, i. e. : analysis of thermo-chemistry concepts, development of teaching model, and its implementation. The implementation {{carried out by the}} teacher. Subject of this research are 40 students of SMUN Lembang Bandung. The result of model implementation are three kinds of data, consist of teaching-learning activities, assessment test, and interview. Teaching learning activities data are analyzed by subject matter pedagogy method. The result of assessment test analyzed according to assessment type. The interview data support the teachable and accessible of the model. Model implementation by the teacher was not appropriate with the design in classroom activities. On the other hand, students have good concept achievement, but only for few indicator of the <b>thinking</b> <b>skill</b> and science process skill. Key words: thermo-chemistry, teaching model, <b>thinking</b> <b>skill,</b> science process skil...|$|R

40|$|Undergraduate nursing {{programmes}} {{are responsible}} for providing teaching and learning that develops students' knowledge, skills and attitudes in alignment with contemporary nursing standards and healthcare demands. Problem-based learning (PBL) as a pedagogy uses authentic artefacts reflecting real-world situations for students to practice problem-solving skills through collaboration with their peers. PBL was introduced in a foundation nursing course delivered in a regional university in Queensland, Australia. This paper presents {{the findings of a}} study exploring the relationships between nursing students' individual characteristics and perceptions of learning environments, teaching in PBL mode, approaches to learning, and critical <b>thinking</b> <b>skill</b> readiness. The study was guided by an ecological perspective designed to examine nursing students' ecological environments and the influences of those environments on their approaches to learning, and on critical <b>thinking</b> <b>skill</b> readiness. The results, through hierarchical linear modelling, revealed that aspects of the PBL approach to teaching influenced the approaches to learning students adopt, and thus their critical <b>thinking</b> <b>skill</b> readiness. Implications for teaching in undergraduate nursing programmes are discussed. ...|$|R
