5|$|A quick cut later, the costumed {{character}} {{is looking at}} the camera again with hands at its sides. After a few more jump cuts in which they turn to the right and back again, the figure stands still, <b>then</b> <b>looks</b> to its left slowly. The figure looks down to where a box with various triangular sections appears, then to their right as the image seems to fragment briefly. For the remainder of the video, the cloaked figure stands still with its back to the wall, with the camera apparently handheld again and occasional video effects briefly doubling the image.|$|E
5|$|Stratton {{continued}} his experiments on perception, branching into studies on pseudoscopic vision, stereoscopic acuity, eye movements, symmetry and visual illusions, how people perceive depth seeing surroundings either one-eyed or two-eyed, acuity {{and limits of}} peripheral vision, apparent motion, afterimages impressed on the eye when a person stares at an object for long and <b>then</b> <b>looks</b> away, and problems with sight in half the visual field (hemianopsia). He both reviewed earlier studies on motion and conducted two of his own, concluding perceiving movement {{was more than the}} sum of seeing successive sequential images. He also surveyed and reported in reviews in the Psychological Bulletin experiments at various labs, including those in Europe, on matters related to sensation and perception.|$|E
5|$|Later, Michael tells Rex he {{must stay}} with his Aunt Carol, as Michael {{is working on}} a case with a {{dangerous}} suspect. His partner, Bird, goes to his house, after trying to call him to make sure he is alright, but <b>then</b> <b>looks</b> in the garage and finds Michael's work on his accident and Detective Hawkins. Bird goes to Dr. Judith Evans, who reluctantly advises Bird to check on Michael. Michael goes to Ed Hawkins' house, shoots Hawkins in the leg, and asks him for evidence. Hawkins says heroin was taken from various evidence lockers and sent out for sale through Westfield Distribution, and further evidence is on his laptop. Hawkins tries to overpower Michael, forcing him to kill Hawkins, right before Bird enters the house. Michael takes Bird's gun and handcuffs him. Bird suggests that to get into Hawkins' laptop, they use a hacker they both worked with previously, right before he knocks out Michael, who wakes up in the red reality.|$|E

5|$|Merrifield opens The Archaeology of Ritual and Magic by {{discussing}} how archaeologists have understood magic and ritual practices in past societies, opining {{that on the}} whole {{it had been a}} neglected area of study. Looking at the archaeological evidence for ritual activity in the pre-Roman Iron Age and the Roman Iron Age of Britain, he discusses animal and human sacrifice, as well as the offering of votive deposits in rivers and other bodies of water. He moves on to explore the rituals surrounding death and burial, suggesting areas where this ritual activity is visible in the burial record of multiple societies. Merrifield goes on to discuss the archaeological evidence for ritual practices in Christian Europe, highlighting areas of ritual continuance from earlier pagan periods, in particular the deposition of metal goods in water. Looking at the evidence for foundation deposits in European buildings that likely had magico-religious purposes, he <b>then</b> <b>looks</b> at several examples of written charms and spells which have survived in the archaeological record.|$|E
5|$|The video {{progresses}} as Carey, now on {{the streets}} of New York, is walking towards the hotel. As she begins to notice the bellhop, dressed in the sweats, pursuing her, she turns around in haste and begins jolting back to the hotel while holding several shopping bags. Additionally, scenes of the stalker's home are shown again, this time more elaborately, with his walls covered with portraits of the singer, as well as album covers and lights around a large photo of her. As the video comes to an end, she waits for her limousine to arrive at the hotel. However, before she gets inside, she notices the stalker attempting to take a picture of her. She <b>then</b> <b>looks</b> directly into his camera and gives a smile. The video then shows him again, still attempting to take a picture, right before a bus hits him. Carey gasps in shock after witnessing the incident. The remix video for the song features the same story-line and footage, only showing inter-cut scenes of Carey dressed in a white ensemble, while laying on a vintage wooden table. As Gucci Mane stands next to her in a white suit, he pours her champagne and hands her the glass.|$|E
5|$|The video {{starts with}} Jason Wade in the driver's {{seat of a}} car, with {{the other members of}} Lifehouse in the car with him. The traffic is at a stand still in a tunnel, as a swarm of people have {{abandoned}} their vehicles and are walking through. Wade and the band members get out of the car, and begin walking in the opposite direction of the crowd {{to the other side of}} the tunnel. Wade pushes through the people, who are in a rush to get to the entrance of the tunnel and is constantly focused on his destination to get to the end. When he reaches the tunnel's end, he sees the wreckage of a car crash with firefighters and paramedics cleaning up the mess. Wade then sees a girl observing what appears to be herself, dead inside one of the crashed car. He <b>then</b> <b>looks</b> to the left, and sees an old man observing himself, dead on the ground. As Wade looks into the other car, he sees himself, also seemingly dead. Upon this, Wade frantically runs back into the tunnel towards his car. Then he sees himself in the car with the band members, however everyone seems to be frozen as he bangs on the windows. Suddenly Wade is inside the car again, and a police officer comes to the window, motioning him to continue driving, since he is stopped in the middle of the tunnel for no apparent reason.|$|E

25|$|The main use of ogham {{by modern}} Druids, Neo-Pagans {{is for the}} purpose of divination. Divination by using ogham symbols is {{mentioned}} in Tochmarc Étaíne, a tale in the Irish Mythological Cycle. In the story, druid Dalan takes four wands of yew, and writes ogham letters upon them. Then he uses the tools for divination. The tale doesn't explain further how the sticks are handled or interpreted. Another method requires a cloth marked out with Finn's Window. A person selects some sticks randomly, throws them on the cloth, and <b>then</b> <b>looks</b> both at the symbols and where they fell.|$|E
25|$|Whitmore {{starts his}} {{argument}} {{by claiming that}} Hutton misrepresents the historical consensus {{of those who have}} studied the witch trials in the Early Modern period, highlighting the work of historians like Carlo Ginzburg, Gustav Henningsen, Gábor Klaniczay and Bengt Ankarloo, who argued that the witch trials were influenced by a substratum of pre-Christian shamanistic beliefs. Moving on, he criticises Hutton for failing to provide a solid definition of witchcraft, and then argues that, contrary to Hutton's claims, many Great Goddess cults existed in the ancient world. Proceeding to defend the ideas of ancient gods of death and resurrection put forward by James Frazer, Whitmore <b>then</b> <b>looks</b> at the British cunning folk, arguing that again Hutton made mistakes, in doing so highlighting the works of historians Emma Wilby and Éva Pócs.|$|E

25|$|When Gaston {{arrived to}} the Pawn Shop, he aims {{at what he}} thought was Gold but discovers a {{mannequin}} instead. He is then confronted by Belle, who now knows he was willing to kill Rumple and believed he still had feelings for her, only to learn that the book was punishment and a constant reminder of why he died. He was also shocked to discover Belle is now Gold's wife, and leaves furious. Belle tells Gold and made him promise not to hurt Gaston, but when she tells Gold about what Hades told her he just couldn't accept what Belle wanted. At the docks, Gold uses magic to choke Gaston by the throat, ready to send him to the River of Lost Souls, when Belle pulls the dagger and commands him not to hurt Gaston, and he drops Gaston on the ground. However, Gaston is unable to let his vendetta against Gold go, and when he goes for his arrow, Belle accidentally knockes Gaston out into the River of Lost Souls. Unfortunately, Belle discovers that because she saved Gold but interfered, Hades arrives to tell the couple that the contract allowing him to take their baby was still in effect, as Belle was the one who knocked Gaston into the Acheron, not Gold. He <b>then</b> <b>looks</b> at a withering daisy flower that he picks up, as a sign of hope fading away. The burned flower later shows up at Granny's Diner, as a gift to Zelena from Hades.|$|E
500|$|For example, in Figure 1 above, the {{verification}} program {{sees the}} evaluation [...] "mate in three ply (Kc6)." [...] It <b>then</b> <b>looks</b> {{at the position}} in Figure 2, after Kc6, and sees the evaluation [...] "mate in two ply." [...] These two evaluations are consistent with each other. [...] If the evaluation of Figure 2 were anything else, it would be inconsistent with Figure 1, so the tablebase {{would need to be}} corrected.|$|E

500|$|Chapter seven, [...] "Cauldron of Animosities", {{opens with}} a {{discussion}} of U.S. support for the increasing militarization of Israel and its illegal development of nuclear weapons, something Chomsky believes threatens peace in the Middle East by encouraging nations like Iran and Iraq to do the same. He explores the longstanding western exploitation of the Middle East for its oil resources, first by the British Empire and subsequently by the U.S. post-World War II, and <b>then</b> <b>looks</b> at the U.S.' role in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, continually supporting Israel both militarily and politically, furthering human right abuses against the Palestinian people and repeatedly sabotaging the peace process.|$|E
500|$|... "The Mission" [...] <b>then</b> <b>looks</b> at how Jesus {{may have}} been viewed by the {{religious}} leaders of the time. The canonical gospels report over one hundred cases of Jesus healing or performing exorcisms, and [...] "making the unclean clean again". Jesus told lepers {{to go up to}} the Temple Mount, where they were usually excluded, and claimed that he could forgive sins without going through the ordinary channels. Jesus met and ate with sinners, the disabled and prostitutes, and fulfilled Old Testament prophecy by riding into the Temple Mount through the Golden Gate on a donkey at Passover. Bowen concludes that all these reasons would have meant that the Pharisees of the time would have seen him as threatening.|$|E
500|$|In 1997, Toshi was [...] "brainwashed" [...] by a cult called [...] "Home of Heart", {{leading to}} the group's breakup that year; guitarist hide died five months later in a {{reported}} suicide, though the band believe he died accidentally, {{trying to do a}} neck-stretching exercise while drunk. The film <b>then</b> <b>looks</b> at Yoshiki following the band's split, where he returned to classical music and composed a piece in honour of the 10th anniversary of the reign of the Emperor Akihito, then the band's reunion in 2007, Taiji's suicide in 2011 eleven months after performing with the group {{for the first time in}} 18 years after being arrested in an air rage incident, and their continuing attempts to achieve worldwide success.|$|E

500|$|When encountering J. queenlandicus, P. fimbriata often first notices {{chemical}} cues on J. queenlandicus′ silken safety {{lines and}} <b>then</b> <b>looks</b> for its prey. The smell makes P. fimbriata to quicker {{to see the}} prey, possibly by lowering thresholds in the visual system. Sometimes P. fimbriata cannot see J. queenlandicus through the prey's camouflage, and [...] "hunts by speculation", jumping high in the air, so that J. queenlandicus betrays itself by turning and looking for the disturbance. P. fimbriata then turns toward J. queenslandicus and waves its palps. It appears that only P. fimbriatas from Queensland behaves this way while Portia species from other areas did not, that P. fimbriata from Queensland reacts this way only to J. queenslandicus, and that J. queenslandicus perceives no chemical warnings that P. fimbriata is around.|$|E
500|$|Duerr <b>then</b> <b>looks</b> {{into the}} origins of the nocturnal visionary traditions, {{beginning}} with the ancient Greek deity Artemis and her influence on the Roman goddess Diana. [...] In Alpine lore, Diana survived Christianization {{as the leader of the}} nocturnal procession. Duerr goes further back into the Palaeolithic, where Venus figurines are interpreted as a [...] "prototype" [...] for the later Greek Artemis, a goddess who was [...] "the unrestrained mistress of animals and plants". [...] Duerr then describes the relationship between ancient goddesses and caves as a symbol of the female vagina and explores stories involving caves in Greek mythology, Sir Gawain and the Green Knight and Yakut folklore. [...] Duerr [...] proposes that the association between caves and the vagina is global in scope, as societies around the world use caves in rituals symbolizing birth.|$|E
500|$|Michael, Pam, and Ryan (B. J. Novak) {{return to}} their office and believe they have been robbed. Dwight calls and reveals his treachery. Michael calls Dwight {{on the phone and}} tells Dwight he is going to steal his biggest client while he listens. Dwight races to the HarperCollins office, where Michael and Dwight start {{fighting}} over the client, Daniel Scofield (Bob Gebert). Mr. Scofield asks for both of their offers via email, and they agree to do so. Before leaving, Dwight <b>then</b> <b>looks</b> at Daniel's personal information from Michael's Rolodex card and asks him about his [...] "gay son", which seemingly perturbs Daniel. [...] Michael reveals his unusual system where he color codes personal information about his contacts so he knows what not to talk about.
