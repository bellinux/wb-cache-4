25|$|The pittas are {{strongly}} territorial, with territories varying {{in size from}} 3000 m² in the African pitta to 10,000m² in the rainbow pitta. Pittas will perform <b>territory</b> <b>defence</b> displays {{on the edges of}} their territories, although fights between rivals have only been recorded once. One such territorial display is given by the rainbow pitta, which holds its legs straight and bows to a rival on the edge of territory, while making a purring call. Displays like this are paired with calls made out of sight of potential rivals; these territorial calls are frequent and can account for up to 12% of a bird's daylight activity. Migratory species will defend non-breeding feeding territories in addition to their breeding ones.|$|E

50|$|The {{southern}} woolly lemur (Avahi meridionalis), or southern avahi, {{has been}} recently {{recognized as a}} separate species of woolly lemur in 2006 by Zaramody et al. It is a nocturnal and pair-living species. Groups can range from 2 (the parental pair only) to 5 individuals (including the offspring of subsequent years). A study in Sainte Luce forest revealed home range varied from 2.2 to 3.5 ha and that males can have larger home range and cover longer daily distances than females (which can spend more time feeding), {{in agreement with the}} <b>territory</b> <b>defence</b> and mate guarding hypotheses.|$|E

5000|$|The {{breeding}} habitats {{are most}} commonly alkali lake shores, wetlands, salt marshes, and coastland, which is fitting {{with the results}} of a study that investigated what makes an environment suitable for a breeding habitat for the Kentish plover. By analysing 4 variables of all known nests, the study found that plovers prefer to nest in areas of low elevation, low vegetation, high moisture and places far away from human activity and settlements,. There have been observations of parents moving their chicks from poor food areas to better food areas, with chicks subsequently growing stronger in the high food areas. This suggests that parents strategically move their chicks and change habitats. Moving young has benefits: protection from predators, obtaining more food, avoiding competition for food and space, avoiding potential infanticide due to competition, and avoiding <b>territory</b> <b>defences</b> from others. However, this is a trade-off as there are also costs to moving young: moving expends a lot of energy, especially in young, therefore chick growth may be stunted as energy is used on movement rather than growth, the chance of mortality due to starvation or predation increases whilst moving through open areas and the area of high food may have a lot of predators in it already. Overall, chick growth and brood survival benefit from moving to a higher food area, therefore increasing reproductive success of parents, hence why the parents move their chicks. The study also found that the larger and heavier females were more likely to move chicks, perhaps because they could defend their chicks from neighbouring parents ...|$|R

Turkey's policy towards Rojava is based on an economic blockade, persistent attempts of international isolation, opposition to the cooperation of the international Anti-ISIL-coalition with Rojava militias, and support of Islamist Syrian Civil War parties hostile towards Rojava, in past times even including ISIL.

50|$|Cranes are {{territorial}} {{and generally}} seasonal breeders. Seasonality varies both between and within species, dependent on local conditions. Migratory species begin breeding upon reaching their summer breeding grounds, between April and June. The breeding season of tropical species, however, is usually timed {{to coincide with}} the wet or monsoon seasons. Territory sizes also vary depending on location. Tropical species can maintain very small territories, for example sarus cranes in India can breed on territories as small as one hectare where the area is of sufficient quality and disturbance by humans is minimised. In contrast red-crowned crane territories may require 500 hectares, and pairs may defend even larger territories than that, up to several thousand hectares. <b>Territory</b> <b>defence</b> is usually performed by the male. Because of this females are much less likely to retain the territory than males in the event of the death of a partner.|$|E
5000|$|Nearly {{all species}} of {{oystercatcher}} are monogamous, {{although there are}} reports of polygamy in the Eurasian oystercatcher. They are territorial during the breeding season (with a few species defending territories year round). There is strong mate and site fidelity in the species that have been studied, with one record of a pair defending the same site for 20 years. A single nesting attempt is made per breeding season, which is timed over the summer months. The nests of oystercatchers are simple affairs, scrapes in the ground which may be lined, and placed in a spot with good visibility. The eggs of oystercatchers are spotted and cryptic. Between one and four eggs are laid, with three being typical in the Northern Hemisphere and two in the south. Incubation is shared but not proportionally, females tend to take more incubation and males engage in more <b>territory</b> <b>defence.</b> Incubation varies by species, lasting between 24-39 days. Oystercatchers are also known to practice [...] "egg dumping." [...] Like the cuckoo, they sometimes lay their eggs in the nests of other species such as seagulls, abandoning them to be raised by those birds.|$|E
50|$|Kagus are monogamous breeders, {{generally}} forming long-term pair {{bonds that}} are maintained for many years, even possibly life. Kagu can be long lived, with birds in captivity living for over 20 years. A single nesting attempt is made each year, although should the first nesting attempt fail a second attempt is made that year. A simple nest is constructed, which {{is little more}} than a heaped pile of leaves, although in some cases the egg may be laid directly on the ground. The nest is not concealed but is usually adjacent to a tree trunk, log or low vegetation. A single grey slightly blotched egg is laid which weighs 60-75 g. Incubation duties are shared by the parents. Each bird will incubate the egg for 24 hours, with the changeover occurring around noon each day. During each incubation stint the parent will remain on the egg the whole time except early in the morning, when the bird will briefly move away to call to its mate and occasionally forage quickly. The incubation period lasts for 33-37 days, which is long for the size of the egg. Offspring may remain in their parents' territory for many years after fledging, sometimes up to six years. These chicks do not help in incubating the eggs or raising the chicks, but nevertheless improve the breeding success of the parents. The older offspring do apparently help in <b>territory</b> <b>defence,</b> responding to playback of rivals and also participating in territorial fights, and it has been suggested that this should be treated as a form of cooperative breeding.|$|E

40|$|Models on {{territory}} {{acquisition and}} tenure predict that territorial animals benefit by adjusting territorial defence behaviour to previous challenges {{they had experienced}} within the socially complex environment of communication networks. Here, we addressed such issues of social cognition by investigating persisting effects of vocal contests on <b>territory</b> <b>defence</b> behaviour in nightingales Luscinia megarhynchos (Brehm). Using interactive playback during nocturnal song of subjects, a rival was simulated to countersing either aggressively (by song overlapping) or moderately (by song alternating) from outside the subjects' territory. Thereby, the time-specific singing strategy provided an experimentally controlled source {{of information on the}} motivation of an unfamiliar rival. Expecting that nightingales integrate information with time, the same rival was simulated to return as a moderately singing intruder on the following morning. The results show that the vigour with which male nightingales responded to the simulated intrusion of an opponent during the day depended {{on the nature of the}} nocturnal vocal interaction experienced several hours before. Males that had received the song overlapping playback the preceding night approached the simulated intruder more quickly and closer and sang more songs near the loudspeaker than did males that had received a song alternating playback. This adjustment of <b>territory</b> <b>defence</b> strategies depending on information from prior signalling experience suggests that integrating information with time plays an important part in <b>territory</b> <b>defence</b> by affecting a male's decision making in a communication network...|$|E
40|$|In {{territorial}} contests, {{not only}} acoustic or other signals, {{but also the}} movements of a territorial intruder are likely to influence the response of a resident. 2. We tested this movement hypothesis by simulating moving vs. stationary intruders into the territories of winter wrens Troglodytes troglodytes, using the same non-interactive song playbacks in both treatments. 3. Male winter wrens showed a different long-term singing reaction {{in response to a}} moving than to a stationary intruder. 4. One day after experiencing an intruder that was switching between three locations, residents started to sing earlier before sunrise, and they sang more and longer songs at dawn than before the intrusion. 5. Residents receiving the same playback from one location only reacted by starting to sing later relative to sunrise, and by singing fewer and shorter songs than before the intrusion. 6. We could not discriminate between the treatments when examining the short-term singing reactions during and immediately after the playbacks. However, our results clearly demonstrate an effect of the spatial behaviour of territorial intruders on the long-term <b>territory</b> <b>defence</b> of residents at dawn, about 24 h after an intrusion. 7. We argue that spatial behaviour of territorial intruders should {{be an integral part of}} the study of animal <b>territory</b> <b>defence</b> behaviour.

Conversion is also undertaken concomitant with the emergence of a decentralised but a more and more theoretical money-based commercial economy (step backwards of the money-based economy, high transaction costs, barter).
