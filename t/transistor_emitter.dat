5000|$|The KG-13 {{employed}} [...] "FLYBALL" [...] modules. These were modules made {{of discrete}} components {{set up as}} logic element circuit groups such as NAND gates, NOR gates, XOR gates, flip flops, monostables, multivibrators, etc. Once tested, the modules were potted in a compound whose colour indicated their function. The coloured potting compound was extremely hard and any attempt to penetrate it resulted in damage to the internal circuitry. In a KG-13, the following colours are confirmed: Pink, Yellow, Green, Blue, Red, Orange and Black. Purple and Brown modules were probably used but those colours are unconfirmed as of this time. Yellow modules were single <b>transistor</b> <b>emitter</b> follower clock drivers. Pink modules were two transistor shift register flip flops. Each yellow module drove nine pink ones. A two transistor multivibrator module drove the audio alarm thru an amplifier. Two transistor monostables were also used. NAND and NOR modules were built from a single transistor and XOR modules were built from two transistors. Failures usually occurred in the power supplies, buffers, and synchronizers though most problems were quickly resolved. When new, there was a high frequency of failures due to cold solder joints. One board in the KG-13 had a black module which was a noise generator containing a Zener diode noise source. This was the only classified module because the noise was used to randomize the key stream on startup. The circuitry inside the module then used the koken chain shift registers to create an pseudo random key stream. That was why {{there was no problem}} in restarting the KG-13 with the same card. The noise source ensured that the chances of duplicating the start point was negligible.|$|E
50|$|Specifically, a 3-input NOR gate may {{consist of}} 3 bipolar {{junction}} <b>transistors</b> with their <b>emitters</b> all grounded, their collectors tied together and linked to Vcc through a load impedance. Each base {{is connected to}} an input signal, and the common collector point presents the output signal. Any input that is a 1 (high voltage) to its base shorts its <b>transistor's</b> <b>emitter</b> to its collector, causing current to flow through the load impedance, which brings the collector voltage (the output) very near to ground. That result is independent of the other inputs. Only when all 3 input signals are 0 (low voltage) do the emitter-collector impedances of all 3 transistors remain very high. Then very little current flows, and the voltage-divider effect with the load impedance imposes on the collector point a high voltage very near to Vcc.|$|R

This process would etch away and form circular well depressions {{on each side of the}} N-type germanium base material, until the germanium base material was ultra thin and having a thickness of approximately a few ten-thousandths of an inch. After the etching process was finished, the polarity applied to the electrolyte was reversed, resulting in metallic indium being electroplated into these etched circular well depressions, forming the <b>transistor's</b> <b>emitter</b> and collector electrodes.

This outstanding figure of merit seems to rely upon the presence of a thin interfacial oxide between the SIPOS and the crystalline silicon. We invoke a model in which majority-carrier (electron) contact is made by microcrystalline grains which protrude into the interfacial oxide but minority-carrier (hole) recombination is inhibited by the small fractional area coverage of such contacts. The result is an emitter structure which is robust and relatively insensitive to variations in processing conditions.

25|$|Gifford {{said that}} Widlar and Talbert were {{actually}} {{the founders of}} National Semiconductor, and that Sporck joined them later. The duo started by setting up the epitaxial process at Santa Clara. Once the technology was in place, Widlar concentrated on voltage regulators {{and by the end}} of 1966 produced the industry's first integrated linear regulator. The LM100, a revolutionary new circuit, became another flagship product that surpassed expectations for sales and longevity. In 1967 Widlar designed the LM101, an operational amplifier with improved gain, decreased input current, and protection against short circuit. The LM101 featured another unorthodox input stage, employing NPN input <b>transistors</b> <b>emitter</b> coupled to PNP transistors in a common base arrangement. The high reverse breakdown voltage of the PNP transistors allowed the LM101 to withstand a differential input voltage of ±30 V. Its frequency compensation was simpler and more robust and stable than that of μA709. It was followed by LM101A, a functionally identical IC that pioneered the use of a field-effect transistor to control internal current sources. Widlar's solution minimized die area and current drain, and enabled operation over a wide range of power supply voltages. Later he devised another new device, the super-beta transistor. It was created in silicon by Talbert and integrated in the LM108 precision operational amplifier, which was released in 1969. These high-gain, very-low-voltage devices were capable of operating at very low input currents within the full military range of operating conditions. The items in the linear circuit product line were user friendly, very useful, and very profitable.|$|R

We show in this work that the extrinsic current gain EXT measured at a low current level can be erroneously attributed to the gain of the intrinsic transistor. By accounting for leakage current coupled with poor ohmic contacts, we show that the observed very high EXT at low current levels can be modeled accurately. The real gain of the intrinsic transistor INT is generally much lower. As the current is increased, the effect of leakage currents is diminished, and EXT INT. This model is satisfactorily applied to explain our experimental results. Index Terms—Bipolar <b>transistors,</b> common <b>emitter,</b> current gain, GaN, Gummel plot, HBT, leakage currents.
