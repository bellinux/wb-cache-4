5|$|As for the BIA's assurance, the Court {{that only}} {{meant that the}} {{termination}} act did not terminate <b>the</b> <b>claim,</b> not that {{the statute of limitations}} would not begin to run. Because the Court of Appeals had only held that the statute of limitation did not apply, not that it would not bar <b>the</b> <b>claim</b> if it applied, and the District Court had held <b>the</b> <b>claim</b> barred, the Court remanded to the Court of Appeals to pass on that conclusion of the District Court.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, the Pew Research Center {{reported}} that 85% of Americans {{were familiar with}} <b>the</b> <b>claim,</b> and 30% believed it was true, backed by three contemporaneous polls. A poll in August 2012 found that 39% of Americans believed <b>the</b> <b>claim.</b>|$|E
5|$|Variations of the {{original}} theory were also proposed, including <b>the</b> <b>claim</b> that the plot involved overseas groups intent on overthrowing the Chakri dynasty, <b>the</b> <b>claim</b> that media consolidation was a core component of the conspiracy, <b>the</b> <b>claim</b> that the Plan was aimed at maintaining a constitutional monarchy while reducing {{the powers of the}} monarch to a mere figurehead, and <b>the</b> <b>claim</b> that a law designed to further decentralize central administrative power to the Thai provinces, and <b>the</b> <b>claim</b> that Thaksin wanted to establish a government based on the model of western democracies.|$|E
50|$|A {{patent for}} a claimed {{invention}} {{may not be}} obtained, notwithstanding that <b>the</b> <b>claimed</b> invention is not identically disclosed as set forth in section 102, if the differences between <b>the</b> <b>claimed</b> invention and <b>the</b> prior art are such that <b>the</b> <b>claimed</b> invention as a whole would have been obvious before the effective filing date of <b>the</b> <b>claimed</b> invention to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which <b>the</b> <b>claimed</b> invention pertains. Patentability shall not be negated by {{the manner in which}} the invention was made.|$|R
5000|$|First, {{the court}} said, <b>the</b> <b>claims</b> “are {{directed}} to a patent-ineligible concept” because the “method {{begins and ends}} with a natural phenomenon” (i.e., cffDNA). Second, it said, <b>the</b> <b>claimed</b> method did not “‘transform’ <b>the</b> <b>claimed</b> naturally occurring phenomenon into a patent-eligible application”of the phenomenon.|$|R
5000|$|The Federal Circuit {{rejected}} {{the conclusion of}} district court Judge Pfaelzer that <b>the</b> <b>claims</b> were abstract, and {{rejected the}} argument that <b>the</b> <b>claims</b> are directed to [...] "the concepts of organizing data into a logical table with identified columns and rows where one or more rows are used to store an index or information defining columns." [...] Instead, the court insisted, [...] "describing <b>the</b> <b>claims</b> at such {{a high level of}} abstraction and untethered from the language of <b>the</b> <b>claims</b> all but ensures that the exceptions to § 101 swallow the rule." [...] The Federal Circuit said that [...] "the district court oversimplified the self-referential component of <b>the</b> <b>claims</b> and downplayed <b>the</b> invention's benefits." [...] The court explained that its [...] "conclusion that <b>the</b> <b>claims</b> are directed to an improvement of an existing technology is bolstered by the specification's teachings that <b>the</b> <b>claimed</b> invention achieves other benefits over conventional databases, such as increased flexibility, faster search times, and smaller memory requirements." ...|$|R
5|$|The Saudi Arabian {{government}} and other Gulf region governments strongly support the King of Bahrain. Although {{government officials and}} media often accuse the opposition of being influenced by Iran, a government-appointed commission found no evidence supporting <b>the</b> <b>claim.</b> Iran has historically claimed Bahrain as a province, but <b>the</b> <b>claim</b> was dropped after a UN 1970 survey found that most Bahraini people preferred independence over Iranian control.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>claim</b> {{could be}} mined freely for a year, after which a $100 ($2,800) fee {{had to be}} paid annually. Should the {{prospector}} leave <b>the</b> <b>claim</b> {{for more than three}} days without good reason, another miner could make a claim on the land. The Canadian government also charged a royalty of between 10 and 20 percent on the value of gold taken from a claim.|$|E
5|$|Afterward, Tom Tureen (the tribes' lawyer) {{tried to}} {{negotiate}} a cash settlement. At first Maine's governor, James B. Longley, Maine's attorney general, Joseph Brennan, and the Great Northern Nekoosa Corporation, the largest landowner in the state, were unwilling to discuss a settlement. With no one to negotiate with, Tureen devoted his energy to assisting the Solicitors Office in researching the legal and historical basis of <b>the</b> <b>claim.</b>|$|E
50|$|Soon after <b>the</b> <b>claims</b> were made, <b>the</b> {{partnership}} ended. Hargreaves {{needed to}} support his wife, so he sold his interest in <b>the</b> <b>claims.</b> Wright was single. He held onto his interest, {{despite a lack of}} funds and harsh conditions. He was determined to hold and work <b>the</b> <b>claims.</b>|$|R

5000|$|According to Enlarged Board of Appeal {{decision}} G 2/88, [...] "it is {{the totality}} of <b>the</b> <b>claims</b> before amendment in comparison with {{the totality of}} <b>the</b> <b>claims</b> after <b>the</b> proposed amendment that has to be considered". If for instance the subject-matter of <b>the</b> <b>claims</b> is changed during opposition proceedings to a different embodiment and if, thereby, the scope of protection of <b>the</b> <b>claims</b> has been extended, the amendment, or change, is contrary to Article 123(3) EPC.|$|R
5|$|Brandon Stosuy, of Pitchfork Media, {{talked of}} a black metal {{influence}} in the album's imagery. Anderson responded to <b>the</b> <b>claim</b> of black metal influence by stating {{that he does not}} know why people compare his music to black metal; he hypothesized that it is simply the raw production of the music, or the double 'i' in the band name.|$|E
5|$|Brown was {{mentioned}} {{by the press}} in the expenses crisis for claiming for the payment of his cleaner. However, no wrongdoing was found and the Commons Authority did not pursue Brown over <b>the</b> <b>claim.</b> Meanwhile, the Commons Fees Office stated that a double payment for a £153 plumbing repair bill was a mistake on their part and that Brown had repaid it in full.|$|E
5|$|During construction, First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill {{attempted}} {{to arrange for}} Australia to remain in British waters on completion. Although <b>the</b> <b>claim</b> was made on strategic grounds, the reasoning behind it was so the Australian-funded ship could replace one to be purchased with British defence funds. This plan was successfully resisted by Admiral George King-Hall, then Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Navy's Australia Squadron.|$|E
50|$|The court {{proceeded}} on {{the assumption}} that <b>the</b> <b>claims</b> were properly brought, although it noted that this was a slightly shaky assumption. Although <b>the</b> <b>claims</b> had survived a strike-out and an application for indemnity costs, <b>the</b> <b>claims</b> had failed, and a key part had been abandoned midway through trial. Millett J noted in particular that <b>the</b> undervalue <b>claim</b> was doomed from the very outset.|$|R
50|$|In 1970 {{a further}} upgrade saw <b>the</b> <b>claimed</b> power {{increased}} to 85 hp and <b>the</b> <b>claimed</b> top speed to 179 km/h (111 mph).|$|R

5|$|Following the {{declaration}} of war against Mexico in May 1845 and especially after <b>the</b> <b>claim</b> by the US of southwest lands under the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo, US military incursions into Yavapai territory greatly increased. After gold was discovered in California in 1849, more White emigrants passed through Yavapai territory than ever had before. Despite the thousands of emigrants passing through their territory, the Yavapai avoided contact with Whites.|$|E
5|$|However, {{even where}} {{recognisable}} facts are present, {{their use in}} the History cannot be taken at face value. In the Life of Alexander Severus, the History makes <b>the</b> <b>claim</b> at 24.4 that Alexander had considered banning male prostitution but had decided against making it illegal, although the author added that the emperor Philip did later ban the practice. Although <b>the</b> <b>claim</b> about Alexander is false, the note about Philip is true — {{the source of this}} is Aurelius Victor (28.6–7, and who in turn sourced it from the Kaisergeschichte), and the History even copies Victor's style of moralising asides, which were not in the Kaisergeschichte. Normally, this anecdote would have been included in a Life of Philip, but its absence saw the author include it in another life. This is taken as evidence that the mid-work lacuna is deliberate, as the author was apparently reluctant to abandon any useful material that could be gleaned from the Kaisergeschichte.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Jones {{brought a}} claim for damages for {{professional}} negligence against Kaney, {{on the basis that}} the personal injury claim had had to be settled for considerably less than would have been the case had Kaney not signed a document that apparently did not reflect her views. Kaney applied to strike out <b>the</b> <b>claim</b> before filing a defence, on the basis that <b>the</b> <b>claim</b> could not possibly succeed given the binding authority of the Court of Appeal decision of Stanton v Callaghan in 1998 that expert witnesses could not be sued for negligence when preparing a joint statement with the opposing side's expert witness.|$|E
50|$|In {{the other}} area of {{political}} ethics, {{the key issues}} are not the conflict between means and ends but the conflicts among the ends themselves. For example, in the question of global justice, the conflict is between <b>the</b> <b>claims</b> of <b>the</b> nation state and citizens {{on one side and}} <b>the</b> <b>claims</b> of all citizens of the world. Traditionally, priority has been given to <b>the</b> <b>claims</b> of nations, but in recent years thinkers known as cosmopolitans have pressed <b>the</b> <b>claims</b> of all citizens of the world.|$|R
50|$|The PTO {{director}} {{ordered a}} reexamination, and <b>the</b> <b>claims</b> were subsequently rejected. The patent owner elected not to appeal. A reexamination certificate was issued canceling all <b>the</b> <b>claims.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1992, the {{organization}} was inducted to <b>the</b> <b>Claims</b> Conference in New York. Sanbar was made deputy chairman of <b>the</b> <b>Claims</b> Conference, and in 1996 appointed as its international treasurer. In 2002 he was elected as Chairman of the Executive of <b>the</b> <b>Claims</b> Conference and held this position until 2006. As a representative of <b>the</b> <b>Claims</b> Conference in his various duties, Sanbar {{was a member of}} the Swiss National Committee on Needy Holocaust Survivors, and in 1998 appointed o the International Commission on Holocaust Era Insurance Claims led by former Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger.|$|R

5|$|In September 1976, Boston {{law firm}} Ropes & Gray opined that the state's $27 million {{municipal}} bond issue {{could not go}} forward using property within <b>the</b> <b>claim</b> area as collateral. On September 29, Governor Longley flew to Washington, and Maine's delegtion introduced legislation directing the federal courts not to hear the tribe's claim; Congress adjourned before the bills could be considered.|$|E
5|$|In September 1999 Swissair, Delta, and Boeing (who had {{acquired}} McDonnell Douglas through a merger in 1997) agreed to share liability for {{the accident and}} offered {{the families of the}} passengers financial compensation. The offer was rejected in favour of a $19.8billion suit against Swissair and DuPont, the supplier of the Mylar insulation sheathing. A US federal court dismissed <b>the</b> <b>claim</b> in February 2002.|$|E

5|$|In {{an effort}} to {{publicize}} the N-3PB operations, the British Air Ministry circulated a report that two Norwegian-flown aircraft {{had been involved in}} the attack on the German battleship Bismarck on 21–22 May 1941, but it was merely an example of wartime propaganda. Despite many aviation historians disputing <b>the</b> <b>claim,</b> it still appears in current accounts of the sinking of the Bismarck.|$|E
