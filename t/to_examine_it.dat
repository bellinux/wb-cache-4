Dorothea kissed her hands to these dreadful little shapes, and Michael bowed with great reverence.

25|$|Under the unicameral {{procedure}} (which is {{used every}} time the Constitution {{does not require a}} special procedure), bills can be adopted by a vote of the Chamber of Deputies. At that point, the approved bill is sent to the Senate, which has 10 days to decide whether <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> <b>it</b> to propose changes, or let it be enacted without modification. If one-third of the senators ask to review the bill, the Senate has 30 days to formulate amendments and send the bill back to the Chamber of Deputies. Then the deputies will take the final decision on the Senate's proposals and on the bill as a whole. No further approval of the Senate is needed, but a qualified majority might be required to overcome the Senate's veto for laws adopted under the supremacy clause.|$|E
25|$|The {{documentary}} featured {{one notable}} {{change from the}} UFO Files story – Tim Oates, grandson of Brawley Oates and the now-owner of the property with the sealed well where the UFO wreckage was purportedly buried, allowed the investigators to unseal the well, in order <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> <b>it</b> for possible debris. Water {{was taken from the}} well which tested normal except for large amounts of aluminum present; the well had no significant contents. It was stated in the episode that any large pieces of metal had been removed from the well by a past owner of the property. Further, the remains of a windmill base were found near the well site, which refuted Ms. Pegues' statements (from the 1979 Time magazine article) that Judge Proctor never had a windmill on his property.|$|E

25|$|In January 1958, the Aleppo Codex was smuggled out of Syria {{and sent}} to Jerusalem {{to be placed in}} the care of the chief rabbi of the Aleppo Jews. But by the {{influence}} of then President of Israel, Yitzhak Ben-Zvi, it was secretly taken by the government. In the late 1980s, the codex was placed in the Shrine of the Book at the Israel Museum. This finally gave scholars the chance <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> <b>it</b> and consider the claims that it is indeed the manuscript referred to by Maimonides. The work of Moshe Goshen-Gottstein on the few surviving pages of the Torah seems to have confirmed these claims beyond reasonable doubt. Goshen-Gottstein suggested (in the introduction to his facsimile reprint of the codex) that not only was it the oldest known masoretic Bible in a single volume, {{it was the first time}} ever that a complete Tanakh had been produced by one or two people as a unified entity in a consistent style.|$|E

Upon completing her period of purification, she was to bring a lamb for a burnt offering and a pigeon or a turtle dove for a sin offering, and the priest was to offer them as sacrifices to make expiation on her behalf. If she could not afford a sheep, she was to take two turtle doves or two pigeons, one for a burnt offering and the other for a sin offering.

2500|$|John Taylor Coleridge {{continues}} {{by explaining}} the {{negative aspects of}} such a concept: [...] "Though the tenderness and beauty resulting from this opinion be to us a rich overpayment for the occasional strainings and refinements of sentiment to which it has given birth, it has yet often served to make the author ridiculous in common eyes, in that it has led him to state his own fairy dreams as the true interpretation and import of the looks and movements of children, as being even really in their minds." [...] In a February 1821 review for the British Critic, John Taylor Coleridge attacked the poem again for a heretical view found {{in the notion of}} pre-existence and how it reappeared in Wordsworth's poem [...] "On an Extraordinary Evening of Splendour and Beauty". However, he does claim that the passage of the ode containing the idea is [...] "a passage of exquisite poetry" [...] and that [...] "A more poetical theory of human nature cannot well be devised, and if the subject were one, upon which error was safe, we should forbear <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> <b>it</b> closely, and yield to the delight we have often received from it in the ode from which the last extract [...] is made." [...] He was to continue: [...] "If, therefore, we had met the doctrine in any poet but Mr. Wordsworth, we should have said nothing; but we believe him to be one not willing to promulgate error, even in poetry, indeed it is manifest that he makes his poetry subservient to his philosophy; and this particular notion is so mixed up by him with others, in which it is impossible to suppose him otherwise than serious; that we are constrained to take it for his real and sober belief." ...|$|E
