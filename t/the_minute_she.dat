Morgan said, [...] "from <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> <b>she</b> clapped eyes on Scott and Charlene's sexy son, it was clear {{they were going to}} get it on. It definitely didn't take them long either." [...] During a review of the year, Digital Spy's Daniel Kilkelly praised Phillipps for being [...] "a strong actor" [...] and said he deserved [...] "a chance to shine" [...] as Daniel in the new year. Kilkelly bemoaned the lack of challenging storylines for him and hoped he would be given something more to do that did not revolve around his relationship with Amber.

2500|$|In 1996, Paltrow {{played the}} title {{character}} in the period film adaptation Emma, based on the 1815 novel {{of the same name}} by Jane Austen. Director Douglas McGrath decided to bring in Paltrow to audition for the part of Emma Woodhouse, after a suggestion from his agent and after seeing her performance in Flesh and Bone. On his decision to cast the actress, McGrath revealed: [...] "The thing that actually sold me on her playing a young English girl was that she did a perfect Texas accent. I know that wouldn't recommend her to most people [...] I knew she had theater training, so she could carry herself. We had many actresses, big and small, who wanted to play this part. <b>The</b> <b>minute</b> <b>she</b> started the read-through, the very first line, I thought, 'Everything is going to be fine; she's going to be brilliant.'" [...] While she recovered from wisdom-tooth surgery, Paltrow had a month to herself do her own research for the part; she studied horsemanship, dancing, singing, archery and the [...] "highly stylized" [...] manners and dialect during a three-week rehearsal period. The film was released to critical acclaim and commercial success through arthouse cinemas. Variety proclaimed: [...] "Gwyneth Paltrow shines brightly as Jane Austen's most endearing character, the disastrously self-assured matchmaker Emma Woodhouse. A fine cast, speedy pacing and playful direction make this a solid contender for the Austen sweepstakes." ...|$|E
