5|$|General Dynamics and BAE Systems, who {{received}} contracts in the Ground Combat Vehicle program, criticized the CBO report, saying <b>they</b> <b>used</b> <b>the</b> wrong vehicle in its analysis. Officials from both companies said <b>they</b> <b>used</b> <b>the</b> wrong notional {{model of the}} GCV that did {{not account for the}} change in requirements made by the Army or the advancements made in the technology development phase of the program. They also criticized the comparisons of the other vehicles. The report factored cost, survivability, mobility, and lethality, ranking the GCV's capabilities as lower than all others. The Army questioned the suitability of existing design. An Army test of currently fielded vehicles in 2012 revealed that some met critical GCV requirements, but none met enough without needing significant redesign. They also note that lethality was judged with a 25mm cannon for analysis, before the Army planned to mount a 30mm cannon. The CBO report did give credit to cost, assuming the Army's goal of $13 million per vehicle. However, Pentagon cost assessments estimated the price at $16–$17 million per vehicle.|$|E

5|$|After this, {{the lands}} of the West Branch Susquehanna River valley were under the nominal control of the Iroquois. The Iroquois lived in long houses, {{primarily}} {{in what is now}} New York, and had a strong confederacy which gave them power beyond their numbers. They and other tribes used the Pine Creek Path through the gorge, traveling between a path on the Genesee River in modern New York in the north, and the Great Shamokin Path along the West Branch Susquehanna River in the south. The Seneca tribe of the Iroquois believed that Pine Creek Gorge was sacred land and never established a permanent settlement there. <b>They</b> <b>used</b> <b>the</b> path through the gorge and had seasonal hunting camps along it, including one just north of the park near what is now the village of Ansonia.

5|$|An earlier canal {{had been}} built in the Middle Ages to supply Glastonbury Abbey and the town with stone and produce. In the early 19th century a new canal was {{proposed}} to improve commerce in Glastonbury and help with drainage of the surrounding area of the Somerset Levels. Several alternative routes were considered and costed before obtaining an Act of Parliament and issuing a prospectus to raise funds for the building of the canal. Construction commenced in the 1820s; however it was more expensive than envisaged and further funds had to be raised. It finally opened in 1833 but was only prosperous for a short period. The shortfall in income and engineering problems with water supply and waterlogged peat causing the clay puddling to fracture meant that it was sold to the Bristol and Exeter Railway. <b>They</b> <b>used</b> <b>the</b> canal to transport materials for the construction of the new Somerset Central Railway which opened in 1854.|$|E
5|$|As {{reported}} by the Byzantine chronicler Theophanes the Confessor, the Arab attack was methodical: in 672–673 Arab fleets secured bases along the coasts of Asia Minor, and then proceeded to install a loose blockade around Constantinople. <b>They</b> <b>used</b> <b>the</b> peninsula of Cyzicus near {{the city as a}} base to spend the winter, and returned every spring to launch attacks against the city's fortifications. Finally, the Byzantines, under Emperor Constantine IV, managed to destroy the Arab navy using a new invention, the liquid incendiary substance known as Greek fire. The Arab land army in Asia Minor was also defeated by the Byzantines, forcing the Arabs to lift the siege. The Byzantine victory was of major importance for the survival of the Byzantine state, as the Arab threat receded for a time. A peace treaty was signed soon after, and following the outbreak of another Muslim civil war, the Byzantines even experienced a period of ascendancy over the Caliphate.|$|E
5|$|At the time, Akersbanerne {{was working}} on {{building}} the Lambertseter Line, which is located further east in Aker. This caused an uproar amongst the residents in the Ekeberg area, who wanted the Ekeberg Line extended, in {{what became known as}} the thousand meter, before the construction of the Lambertseter Line. The municipality therefore granted free municipal land and a grant of NOK50,000 for expropriation. Construction started in July 1940, after having been delayed by the German occupation of Norway. The construction included a new double track from Holtet to Bråten. During the construction at Sæter, the trams turned at Bråten and backed to Sæter, where <b>they</b> <b>used</b> <b>the</b> turning loop.
