5|$|Primer is of {{note for}} its {{extremely}} low budget, experimental plot structure, philosophical implications, and complex technical dialogue, which Carruth, a college graduate {{with a degree}} in mathematics and a former engineer, chose not to simplify for <b>the</b> <b>sake</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> audience. The film collected the Grand Jury Prize at the 2004 Sundance Film Festival, before securing a limited release in the United States, and has since gained a cult following.|$|E

The resulting accidents have forced {{the closure of the}} pass. CDOT has put in larger signs advising drivers of the ban and worked with GPS device manufacturers so their software notes the restriction.

5|$|Chuck and Sarah turn to Jack to {{help them}} {{continue}} Daphne's con and capture the Zephyr. They manage to lead the Klügs away from the reception and incapacitate them, {{only to find that}} none of them has the Zephyr. Jack realizes that the Klügs have been performing a shell game: the government has been pursuing them for the Zephyr when none of them ever had it; their father (Timothy V. Murphy) had it all along. Meanwhile, the bride's father realizes he is being conned and leads Morgan Grimes (Joshua Gomez) away at gunpoint. When Chuck and Sarah confront him, Klüg uses Morgan as a human shield, but John Casey (Adam Baldwin) takes aim at his head. However, Jack manages to talk Klüg down for <b>the</b> <b>sake</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bride's happiness.|$|E
5|$|However, in {{the course}} of the speeches {{opposing}} the resolution, Johnston felt Lee's memory had been attacked and he felt duty bound to defend him. The Democratic Party, knowing his views and that of his state, approached him and asked him to keep silent for <b>the</b> <b>sake</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> party and the relief of Virginia. Johnston correctly predicted that he would be attacked at home. He was up for re-election, and the opposing candidates used his position against him. A delegation from the Virginia General Assembly travelled to Washington to talk with the Democrats and assess the situation and were satisfied by the reports they received.|$|E

5|$|Several issues marked Johnston's senatorial career. He {{was caught}} in the middle during the debate over the Arlington Memorial. The initial {{proposal}} to relocate the dead was distasteful to Johnston, yet the ensuing debate caused him to want to defend the memory of Robert E. Lee; the need to stay quiet for <b>the</b> <b>sake</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Democratic Party, however, proved decisive. Johnston was an outspoken opponent of the Texas-Pacific Bill, a sectional struggle for control of railroads in the South, which figured in the Compromise of 1877. He was also an outspoken Funder during Virginia's heated debate as to how much of its pre-War debt the state ought to have been obliged to pay back. The controversy culminated {{in the formation of the}} Readjuster Party and the appointment of William Mahone as its leader; this marked the end of Johnston's career in the Senate.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after George's {{accession}} to his paternal dukedom, Prince William, Duke of Gloucester, who was second-in-line to the English and Scottish thrones, died. By {{the terms of}} the English Act of Settlement 1701, George's mother, Sophia, was designated as the heir to the English throne if the then reigning monarch (William III) and his sister-in-law, Princess Anne of Denmark (later Queen Anne) died without surviving issue. The succession was so designed because Sophia was the closest Protestant relative of the British royal family. Fifty-six Catholics with superior hereditary claims were bypassed. The likelihood of any of them converting to Protestantism for <b>the</b> <b>sake</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> succession was remote; some had already refused.|$|E
5|$|The admirals, however, were {{reckoning}} {{without their}} sailors.

When the details of Plan 19 were leaked to the fleet, a mutiny almost instantly broke out, with sailors raising the red flag of revolution and refusing to obey their officers. Faced with a complete breakdown of discipline within his fleet, Admiral Hipper {{had no choice but to}} disperse his ships to their homeports in early November. Days later, on 11 November 1918, World War I came to an end.|$|E

Realizing that something is worrying Seetha, Venu gives her the freedom to marry Murali after his death.

5|$|Felix {{is finally}} able to explain to Isaac why Alchemy's release is a {{necessary}} thing for everyone, and that Saturos and Menardi were aiming for this goal merely for <b>the</b> <b>sake</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> survival of their home colony of Prox to the far north, located near the Mars Lighthouse. He also reveals that his parents and Isaac's father are alive and currently being held hostage in Prox in order to coerce Felix's initial cooperation. Isaac and his company agree to aid Felix, and the group sets out north to activate the Mars Lighthouse. The group discovers that Karst and Agatio have been transformed into mindless dragons and are forced to defeat them - they return the Mars Star before succumbing to their wounds. When they reach the tower's top, the Wise One, the entity responsible for originally tasking Isaac to prevent the breaking of Alchemy's seal, confronts them. He warns them that mankind could very well destroy Weyard themselves if they had possession of such a power, and when Isaac insists on breaking the seal regardless the Wise One summons a giant, three-headed dragon for the party to battle in the final struggle. After slaying the dragon, the party of Adepts finish their objective and activate Mars Lighthouse; with all four towers across Weyard lit, the process that heralds {{the return of the}} force of Alchemy to Weyard ensues at the mountain sanctum Mt. Aleph. Alex is there, however; he took advantage of everyone else's quests so that he would gain immense power for himself from the light of the Golden Sun, a manifestation of Alchemy itself. However, he discovers that the Wise One had taken steps to prevent this and is left to die as the mountain collapses and sinks into the ground with him still on it.|$|E

50|$|However {{this story}} relates another {{exception}} where Halakha requires that one surrender their life. A situation {{where a person}} is forced to break a law simply for <b>the</b> <b>sake</b> <b>of</b> desecrating <b>the</b> Torah. If a non-Jewish ruler demands that a Jew cook food {{for him on the}} Sabbath, the Jew is required to desecrate the Sabbath rather than let himself be killed. However, if the ruler demands the Jew cook food on the Sabbath, not for the ruler's benefit but simply for <b>the</b> <b>sake</b> <b>of</b> dishonoring <b>the</b> Torah, then one is required to surrender their life to avoid desecrating God's name (akin to idolatry). Hannah and her sons acted in this way when it came it eating pork for <b>the</b> <b>sake</b> <b>of</b> desecrating <b>the</b> Torah, by allowing themselves to be killed they sanctified God's name in public.|$|R

25|$|Co-redemptrix {{refers to}} an {{indirect}} or unequal but important participation by Mary in the redemption process.
