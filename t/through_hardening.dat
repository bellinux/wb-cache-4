5|$|The main {{disadvantage}} to {{die casting}} {{is the very}} high capital cost. Both the casting equipment required and the dies and related components are very costly, as compared to most other casting processes. Therefore, to make die casting an economic process, a large production volume is needed. Other disadvantages are that the process is limited to high-fluidity metals, and casting weights must be between 30grams (1oz) and 10kg (20lb). In the standard die casting process the final casting will have {{a small amount of}} porosity. This prevents any heat treating or welding, because the heat causes the gas in the pores to expand, which causes micro-cracks inside the part and exfoliation of the surface. Thus a related disadvantage of die casting is that it is only for parts in which softness is acceptable.

40|$|In {{industry}} {{different methods}} of surface hardening {{are widely used}} to increase reliability and durability of friction unit parts. Among these methods are areas of focus based on deformcutting technology (DC) i. e. method of chip-free mechanical treatment. It is shown that DC method allows us to produce through- or partial-hardening surface layers of a large thickness (0, 4 … 1. 5 mm) on steel with no additional heat sources. The standard metal-cutting equipment and common tools are used for deform-cutting process. The significant heat generation in the deform-cutting zone and mechanical effect from the tool allow us to heat undercut layers to the phase transformation point to have the hardening structure {{as a result of}} heat removal to the cold balk. The hardening structure formation occurs at significant heating and cooling rate (106 C/c) with large degrees and rates of strain. The deform-cutting modes and working face tool grinding determine the type and properties of the hardening structure. To produce the hardening structure would require the heat transfer and force action augmentation while treatment. These researches deal with through- and partial surface hardening samples produced by turning steel 35 shafts. While <b>through</b> <b>hardening</b> the phase transformation carry among the whole thickness of the undercut layer; while partial hardening the hardening interlayer formed {{on the side of the}} cutting tool contact. The depth of hardening zone of samples with <b>through</b> <b>hardening</b> layers is 0, 5 mm; the depth of hardening zone of partial hardening samples is 0, 8 mm. Micro-hardness of the <b>through</b> <b>hardening</b> layers is 653 HV 0, 1 and 485 HV 0, 1 for the partial hardening layers. The metallographic analysis shows that the hardening zone formed while deform cutting has disperse structure; there are ferrite ghosts in it. The tempering at temperatures of 200 – 700 C showed that the micro-hardness of the hardening structures formed while deform cutting is larger than the micro-hardness of the samples after quenching. There special structures formed while deform cutting demand more in-depth study using different methods of physical-chemical analysis and mechanical testing. </p...|$|E

A range of univariate and multivariate statistics was used to relate variation in the benthic assemblages to concentrations of contaminants (heavy metals and hydrocarbons) within the sediments of each estuary. Sediments in the most developed estuary contained concentrations of heavy metals and petroleum hydrocarbons that were several orders of magnitude greater than those from non-urban waterways. The fauna at these sites was dominated by cirratulid and sternaspid polychaetes and lacked filter-feeding bivalves and other molluscs that were common in less developed estuaries.

Heat treatment is a controlled heating, cooling of metals {{for the purpose of}} altering their properties and can perform their function without a concurrent change in the product shape.

40|$|High {{strength}} {{thin walled}} flow formed tubes are manufactured from AISI 4130 medium carbon low alloy, steel. Starting with an {{ultimate tensile strength}} of 650 MPa, the material has recorded a tensile strength of 1250 - 1300 MPa corresponding to a percentage thickness reduction of 88. It has been observed that material with higher impurity, levels and inclusion ratings are more vulnerable to development of micro cracks at higher percentage thickness reduction. Deformed inclusions like MnS act as stress raisers leading to initiation of micro cracks.

The strength coefficient K and strain hardening exponent n of equation σ=Kεn are determined from stress–strain curves under different heat treatment conditions for AISI 4130 steel. The effect of cold work on mechanical properties of flow formed part for a given reduction in area (RA) is predicted using empirical relations published in literature. In order to validate the hypothesis of prediction of cold worked material properties after flow forming, a few flow forming experiments are carried out. The preform dimensions are worked out based on constant volume principle. A three pass flow forming sequence was followed and the properties are measured for about 88 – 90 % thickness reduction.

40|$|Ion induced charge {{collection}} dynamics within Integrated Circuits (ICs) is important {{due to the}} presence of ionizing radiation in the IC environment. As the charge signals defining data states are reduced by voltage and area scaling, the semiconductor device will naturally have a higher susceptibility to ionizing radiation induced effects. The ionizing radiation can lead to the undesired generation and migration of charge within an IC. This can alter, for example, the memory state of a bit, and thereby produce what is called a "soft" error, or Single Event Upset (SEU). Therefore, the response of ICs to natural radiation is of great concern for the reliability of future devices. Immunity to soft errors is listed as a requirement in the 1997 National Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors prepared by the Semiconductor Industry Association in the United States. To design more robust devices, it is essential to create and test accurate models of induced {{charge collection}} and transport in semiconductor devices. A heavy ion microbeam produced by an accelerator is an ideal tool to study charge collection processes in ICs and to locate the weak nodes and structures for improvement <b>through</b> <b>hardening</b> design. In this dissertation, the Ion Beam Induced Charge Collection (IBICC) technique is utilized to simulate recoil effects of ions in ICs. These silicon or light ion recoils are usually produced by the elastic scattering or inelastic reactions between cosmic neutrons or protons and the lattice atoms in ICs. Specially designed test structures were experimentally studied, using microbeams produced at Sandia National Laboratories. A new technique, Diffusion Time Resolved IBICC, is first proposed in this work to measure the average arrival time of the diffused charge, which can be related to the first moment (or the average time) of the arrival carrier density at the junction. A 2 D device simulation tool, the MEDICI code, and heavy-ion microbeams are used to calculate and measure charge collection and relative arrival time on stripe-like test junctions. The MEDICI simulation is in qualitative and sometimes even quantitative agreement with the microbeam measurements. The amount of charge collection and the magnitude of average arrival time for diffused charge collection can be crucial to understanding and mitigating radiation induced circuit malfunctions during normal IC operations...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2016 Manufacturing {{industry}} drives {{economic activity}} and growth around the world, but manufacturing activities consume {{large amounts of}} material, energy, and labor resources. Therefore, the impacts of manufacturing need to be accounted for and reduced. Direct benefits of manufacturing are products and income, which, in turn, influence {{the lives of people}} in the local community and the consumers purchasing the manufactured products. The design process for products and requisite manufacturing facilities should incorporate environmental and social criteria in addition to economic criteria to more comprehensively assess sustainability performance. Sustainability assessments for manufactured products and manufacturing facilities can be carried out by assessing the incremental elements of manufacturing industry, which are unit manufacturing processes (UMPs). A challenge in the research area is that current methods for UMP assessment are ad hoc and the methods do not incorporate the system as a whole. The purpose of this research is to enable sustainable manufacturing decision making by 1) unifying an assessment methodology for UMPs, 2) developing an information modeling framework for characterizing UMPs and workpieces, and 3) demonstrating UMP composability (connectivity) modeling for use in sustainability assessments. The methodology is developed through literature review, and unifies 23 different UMP manufacturing assessment methods by analyzing each for overlapping and unique steps in the approaches. Thus, a nine-step assessment methodology emerged, which has multiple applications in industry, including process and facility assessment and improvement. A next step for MPF modeling is to link UMP models by modeling the workpiece state, but supporting tools were need to identifying how to correctly model the interactions between the UMP and the workpiece. The information modeling framework developed herein provides the theoretical background for how UMP models interact by linking the function of the UMP to the effect on the workpiece and by identifying the calculation variables necessary to assess UMPs. The information modeling framework developed for composing UMP models is demonstrated through the energy analysis of a metal component. The component is manufactured by recrystallization annealing, reducing (milling), <b>through</b> <b>hardening,</b> and recovery annealing (tempering). Models are composed (connected) by utilizing knowledge of how UMPs impart transformation to the workpiece and the information embedded in the workpiece that is transported to subsequent UMPs. Workpiece information includes the geometry and properties of the current state and future states. Previous work reported in literature has focused on geometry modeling (e. g. CAD, CAM), while this work focuses on property modeling. This research develops an overarching detailed approach to manufacturing sustainability assessments through in-depth analysis of UMPs. The result of using this UMP approach will provide guidance toward a more sustainable future...|$|E
40|$|Observations on some steels used in high {{performance}} gears {{are presented in}} this thesis. The object was to understand how microstructure and residual stress influenced mechanical properties, particularly fatigue strength. The investigations were carried out using fatigue testing, metallographic techniques, shot peening, hardness testing and Xray diffraction to determine residual stress {{and the amount of}} retained austenite. The work is divided into two main parts. In the first part, the opportunity was taken of investigating a batch of case-carburised gears manufactured from 17 CrNiMo 6 steel that contained an abnormally high level of retained austenite.. The benefits or otherwise of retained austenite is a matter of some controversy in the literature and this was an opportunity of testing the effect of high retained austenite in gears. In the second part, the properties of a recently formulated <b>through</b> <b>hardening</b> steel was investigated. The steel is inexpensive and capable of being fully hardened by air-cooling. It is believed that use of the material could reduce the cost of gear manufacture by eliminating the carburisation process, oil quenching and the subsequent need to correct distortions that arise from quenching. Gears were manufactured using l 7 CrNiMo 6 steel. After carburization, one batch was found to have an abnormally high level of retained austenite (40 to 60 %). Normally, gears with this level of retained austenite would be rejected. Nevertheless, gears from this batch were found to have surface and bending fatigue strengths that were not very different from those with much lower retained austenite contents. Despite the fact that the material is relatively soft, it was found that a very thin surface layer had hardened during back-to-back gear testing, probably by strain-induced transformation of the retained austenite. It was deduced that this thin layer of hardened material is sufficient to maintain a good level of surface contact fatigue strength. The second part of the work includes a basic study of the through-hardening steel. The study includes heat treatment and hardness, estimation of fracture toughness and the development of residual stress during heat treatment. Specialised standing contact fatigue (SCF) tests were also done using this material. The SCF test consists of cyclic loading of a hard ball in contact with the surface of the specimen, which is meant to simulate asperity contact in surface contact fatigue. Radial cracks or ring cracks or both are nucleated just outside the indentation circle in these tests, depending on the load and the development of plasticity. The stresses near the indentation were modelled using Finite Element analysis and were found to be consistent with the experimental results. Finally, the effect of residual compressive stress induced by shot peeing was studied using the SCF test. It was found that shot peening suppressed the formation of radial cracks.

40|$|In {{the last}} years, {{research}} on Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) {{has become one}} of the primary matters for the development of modern societies. Water, power, banking, transportation and communication systems are only a few examples of essential infrastructures to daily human activities and their protection is a concept relating to the preparedness and response to serious incidents that could threaten them. The term protection is a broader concept in which three main aspects can be individuated: safety, security, and emergency. The safety aspects are out of the scope of this thesis, indeed, the focus is on security. In particular, this investigation will address the concerns of security tied to physical and human factors without considering those related to the cyber ones. This is because the present work is born in the railway context, where the attention is usually oriented to the physical aspects of security since, until now, a common practice has been to realize dedicated connections and isolated networks. With respect to the emergency aspects, only the advantages that a security solution can induce will considered. Physical security is one of the most fundamental aspect of the protection. It concerns the use of physical controls for protecting premises, sites, facilities, buildings or other physical assets belonging to the critical sectors. The application of physical security is the process of using layers of physical protective measures to prevent unauthorized access or harm. This harm can involve terrorism, theft, destruction, sabotage, vandalism, espionage, and similar. A crucial element which contributes to improve the protection of critical infrastructures seamlessly is the technology. Thanks to fast technological progress, it is possible to build complex surveillance systems able to integrate heterogeneous sources which can monitor environments potentially at risk. In this way, resilience may be accomplished, for example, <b>through</b> <b>hardening</b> the system by adding redundancy and robustness. However, for enhancing significantly the protection level, integration of different technologies is not enough, but a collaborative approach is essential. A strong protection calls for interoperability not only among ICT systems, but also among different operators, organizations, companies, and any other entity belonging to the public security sector. Nevertheless, the security designer must determine how best to combine elements like fences, barriers, sensors, procedures, security systems, and security personnel into a Physical Security System (PPS) that can achieve the protection objectives. For this reason, another important element is to conduct a systematic evaluation in which quantitative and/or qualitative techniques are used to predict overall system effectiveness, by identifying exploitable weaknesses in asset protection for a given threat. The original contribution of this thesis is to provide methods for enhancing effectiveness and reliability of integrated security systems in order to guarantee an adequate protection level. To achieve the desired level of protection, a two phase approach is proposed combining proactive and reactive strategies. The first one involves the vulnerability assessment based on quantitative methods and the second one introduces an interoperability framework. Specifically, this thesis is the result of research funded by Ansaldo STS, a leader company in railway industry, and carried out also thanks to involvement in research projects about security theme (such as SECUR-ED and METRIP) ...|$|E
50|$|The /5 {{models are}} air-cooled, four-stroke, opposed-twin (boxer) engines with {{hemispherical}} combustion chambers. The engine {{is built around}} a one-piece tunnel crank-case. The camshaft is driven by a duplex chain and is located below the crankshaft (unlike the /2 series which had the gear-driven camshaft above the crank). This reversed arrangement improves ground clearance for the same center of gravity and assists lubrication of the camshaft. Valves are actuated by the camshaft <b>through</b> <b>hardened</b> followers, push rods, and rocker arms. The 500 cc and 600 cc models are equipped with Bing slide-type carburetors with 26 mm throats. The R75/5 comes with 32 mm Bing CV (Constant Vacuum/constant depression) type carburetors. As in all BMW motorcycles at the time, the clutch is a single-disk dry clutch.|$|R
40|$|Metakaolin (MK), a {{calcined}} clay, {{was included}} as a partial cement replacement material, at up to 20 % by weight of binder, in cement pastes and concrete, and its influence on the resistance to chloride ingress investigated. Reductions in effective chloride diffusion coefficients <b>through</b> <b>hardened</b> cement paste were obtained for binary blends and by combining OPC, MK and a second cement replacement material of pulverised fuel ash or ground granulated blast furnace slag. Steady state oxygen diffusion measurements <b>through</b> <b>hardened</b> cement pastes measured using an electrochemical cell showed that the interaction between charged species and the pore surfaces {{is a major factor}} in determining chloride diffusion rate. Rheology of the binder, particularly at high MK replacement levels, was found to have a dramatic influence on the diffusion performance of cement pastes. It was concluded that plasticising admixtures are essential for adequate dispersion of MK in cement pastes. Chloride concentration profile analysis of the concrete cylinders, exposed to sodium chloride solution for one year, was employed to obtain apparent chloride diffusion coefficients for concrete specimens. MK was found to reduce the depth of chloride penetration into concrete when compared with that of unblended mixes. Corrosion rate and corrosion potential measurements were taken on steel bars embedded in concrete exposed to a saline environment under conditions of cyclic wetting and drying. The initiation time for corrosion was found to be significantly longer for MK blended mixes than for plain OPC systems. The aggregate-paste interfacial zone of MK blended systems was investigated by steady state diffusion of chloride ions through mortar containing glass beads as model aggregate. For the model aggregate specimens tested the work confirmed the hypothesis that properties of the bulk paste are the controlling factors in ionic diffusion through mortar...|$|R
