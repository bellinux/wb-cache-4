5|$|Peter {{retired to}} a monastery, {{where he died}} in 969, while Boris was {{released}} from Byzantine custody and recognized as Tsar Boris II. For <b>the</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>it</b> appeared that Nikephoros' plan had worked. However, Sviatoslav's brief sojourn into the south awakened in him the desire to conquer these fertile and rich lands. In this intention he was apparently encouraged by the former Byzantine envoy, Kalokyros, who coveted the imperial crown for himself. Thus, after defeating the Pechenegs, he set up viceroys to rule Russia in his absence and turned his sights southward again.|$|E
5|$|The {{meteoroid}} was a typeI fireball, i.e. {{an ordinary}} chondrite. When it entered Earth's atmosphere its mass was about 44kg, which was estimated {{on the basis}} of the measured values of its absolute magnitude and velocity. It lost approximately 350g during the encounter. Computer simulations showed that it started losing mass approximately at <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>it</b> became visible to the cameras of the European Fireball Network, at a height of 100.6km. It lost mass for 25 seconds, until it reached a height of 215.7km. Its surface melted and solidified again after leaving, which means its surface became a typical meteoritic fusion crust.|$|E
5|$|The {{species in}} all {{probability}} {{has little or no}} direct impact or influence on human interests and concerns but agricultural and real estate development are a threat to the species' very narrow habitat. Collecting specimens in the dry ridges is complicated by the millions of ants which eat the bait in the trap <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>it</b> is set on the ground. Live collecting is the alternative, but the bait is usually digested by the time the animal is taken from the trap, making food research difficult if not impossible.|$|E

5|$|The {{theory that}} Custer's {{soldiers}} committed suicide en masse {{toward the end}} of the Battle of the Little Bighorn has been controversial from <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>it</b> was first suggested, and the discussion continues. The notion was so controversial that Marquis could not find a publisher for Keep the Last Bullet for Yourself, his main vehicle for promoting the theory, and the book did not appear in print until 1976, forty years after his death.|$|E
5|$|Etty {{had used}} {{experimental}} techniques to make The Sirens and Ulysses, using a strong glue as a paint stabiliser which caused the paint to dry hard and brittle, and to flake off once dry, a problem {{made worse by}} the painting's large size causing it to flex whenever it was moved. From <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>it</b> was complete it began to deteriorate. After it was exhibited at the 1857 Art Treasures Exhibition it was considered in too poor a condition for public display, and it was placed in long-term storage in {{the archives of the}} Royal Manchester Institution and its successor, the Manchester Art Gallery. In the mid 20th century {{there were a number of}} unsuccessful attempts to repair The Sirens and Ulysses, but an attempt to clean the painting unintentionally damaged the paint further.|$|E
5|$|In the universe, thorium {{is among}} the rarest of the {{primordial}} elements, because {{it is one of}} the two elements that can be produced only in the r-process, and also because it has slowly been decaying away from <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>it</b> formed. The only primordial elements rarer than thorium are uranium, also produced only by the r-process, and thulium, lutetium, tantalum, and rhenium, the odd-numbered elements just before the third peak of r-process abundances around the heavy platinum group metals. Neutron capture by nuclides beyond A = 209 often results in nuclear fission instead of neutron absorption, reducing the fraction of nuclei that cross the gap of instability past bismuth to become actinides such as thorium. In the distant past the abundances of thorium and uranium were enriched by the decay of plutonium and curium isotopes, and thorium was enriched relative to uranium by the decay of 236U to 232Th and the natural depletion of 235U, but these sources have long since decayed and no longer contribute.|$|E

5|$|It is well {{understood}} that, at <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>it</b> {{is only a}} minimum, the Society is always free {{to put in place}} the number of trains necessary to transport passengers who present themselves, that if it will satisfy this requirement, its proper interest is guaranteed, and, in giving greater public satisfaction, its infrastructure will be wisely used, instead of it travelling empty for part of the day to the detriment of its business. Being given the lower frequency of service on weekdays and Saturdays, except Thursdays (racing), we can perfectly accept the reduction to ten trips to those going from the racecourse to the forest, but, concerning the part of the journey from Trianon to the racecourse, it is imperative that the Chief Engineer (Lechelas) keeps the minimum to 30, otherwise there will be a kind of abandonment of the line, because for this small distance, it will not be possible to get reasonable traffic with more frequent departures.|$|E
5|$|The lack of old native {{names for}} {{it has been}} used to {{demonstrate}} its absence in Britain before introduction in around 1487, but this is challenged by the presence of an old Scottish Gaelic name for the tree, fior chrann which suggests a longer presence in Scotland at least {{as far back as the}} Gaelic settlement at Dál Riata in the late 6th and early 7th centuries. This would make it either an archaeophyte (a naturalised tree introduced by humans before 1500) or perhaps native if it can be seen to have reached Scotland without human intervention. At <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>it</b> is usually classified as a neophyte, a plant that is naturalised but arrived with humans on or after the year 1500. Today, the sycamore is present in 3,461 (89.7%) of hectads in Britain, more than any native tree species.|$|E
5|$|Although his {{administration}} {{was marked by}} a relative absence of major military or political conflicts, Titus faced {{a number of major}} disasters during his brief reign. On August 24, 79, barely two months after his accession, Mount Vesuvius erupted, resulting in the almost complete destruction of life and property in the cities and resort communities around the Bay of Naples. The cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum were buried under metres of stone and lava, killing thousands of citizens. Titus appointed two ex-consuls to organise and coordinate the relief effort, while personally donating large amounts of money from the imperial treasury to aid the victims of the volcano. Additionally, he visited Pompeii once after the eruption and again the following year. The city was lost for nearly 1700 years before its accidental rediscovery in 1748. Since then, its excavation has provided an extraordinarily detailed insight into the life of a city {{at the height of the}} Roman Empire, frozen at <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>it</b> was buried on August 24, 79. The Forum, the baths, many houses, and some out-of-town villas like the Villa of the Mysteries remain surprisingly well preserved. Today, it is one of the most popular tourist attractions of Italy and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. On-going excavations reveal new insights into the Roman history and culture.|$|E

25|$|It may be {{difficult}} to see where simultaneity came into the Doppler shift calculation, and indeed the calculation is often preferred because one does {{not have to worry about}} simultaneity. As seen above, the ship twin can convert his received Doppler-shifted rate to a slower rate of the clock of the distant clock for both red and blue images. If he ignores simultaneity, he might say his twin was aging at the reduced rate throughout the journey and therefore should be younger than he is. He is now back to square one, and has to take into account the change in his notion of simultaneity at the turnaround. The rate he can calculate for the image (corrected for Doppler effect) is the rate of the Earth twin's clock at <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>it</b> was sent, not at <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>it</b> was received. Since he receives an unequal number of red and blue shifted images, he should realize that the red and blue shifted emissions were not emitted over equal time periods for the Earth twin, and therefore he must account for simultaneity at a distance.|$|E

25|$|The {{plan was}} to make a three-day dash to Johannesburg before the Boer commandos could mobilise, and once there, trigger an {{uprising}} by the primarily British expatriate workers (uitlanders) organised by the Reform Committee.

Four days later, the weary and dispirited column was surrounded near Krugersdorp within sight of Johannesburg. After a brief skirmish in which the column lost 65 killed and wounded—while the Boers lost but one man—Jameson's men surrendered and were arrested by the Boers.|$|E
25|$|In {{fact the}} essence of her art was refinement. The term seems odd for a {{performer}} whose imagination and means of expression were so prodigious.
