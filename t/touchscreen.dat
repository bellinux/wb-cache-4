40|$|This {{paper is}} mainly about people’s {{experiences}} of using <b>touchscreens.</b> Information from previous writers’ reports and papers were firstly selected and then {{used in this}} thesis. Questions about whether {{people would like to}} use <b>touchscreens,</b> why they would or would not like to use <b>touchscreens,</b> the frequency of making mistakes for respondents and the time the respondents think they need to learn to use <b>touchscreens</b> as well as a comparison between old techniques and <b>touchscreens</b> were listed in the questionnaire. After getting information from previous researchers’ reports and questionnaires, we got the results that respondents of younger ages are more likely to try <b>touchscreens</b> as their “input mode” and show more interesting to the entertainment applications. What’s more, younger respondents are more confident in making fewer mistakes. People of older ages are more confident in spending less time in learning how to use <b>touchscreens.</b> Moreover, it is also interesting to get reflection that many respondents complained the difficulties in getting used to the <b>touchscreens</b> and typing correctly on the icons of the <b>touchscreens</b> a lot when participated in this survey...|$|R

50|$|Capacitive <b>touchscreens</b> {{are more}} {{responsive}} than resistive <b>touchscreens</b> (which react to any object since no capacitance is needed), but less accurate. However, projective capacitance improves a touchscreen's accuracy as {{it forms a}} triangulated grid around the point of touch.|$|R
