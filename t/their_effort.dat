Britain passed the Slave Trade Act 1807, which prohibited the Atlantic slave trade, and the Royal Navy enforced the Blockade of Africa.

As his gun runs out of bullets and death seems imminent for Mulder and Frank, Scully arrives and shoots the final zombie.|$|E
5|$|Between 1959 and 1970, the Ho Chi Minh Trail {{had become}} the key {{logistical}} artery for PAVN and the National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam (NLF or commonly, Viet Cong), in <b>their</b> <b>effort</b> to conduct military operations to topple the U.S.-supported government of South Vietnam and create a unified nation. Running from the southwestern corner of North Vietnam through southeastern Laos and into the western portions of South Vietnam, the trail system had {{been the target of}} continuous U.S. aerial interdiction efforts that had begun in 1966. Only small-scale covert operations in support of the air campaigns had, however, been conducted on the ground inside Laos to halt the flow of men and supplies on the trail.|$|E

The OpenHMPP directive-based programming model offers a syntax to efficiently offload computations on hardware accelerators and to optimize data movement to/from the hardware memory. OpenHMPP directives describe {{remote procedure call}} (RPC) on an accelerator device (e.g. GPU) or more generally a set of cores. The directives annotate C or Fortran codes to describe two sets of functionalities: the offloading of procedures (denoted codelets) onto a remote device and the optimization of data transfers between the CPU main memory and the accelerator memory.|$|E

5|$|One new {{innovation}} {{that took place}} during the campaign was renewed interest in personnel infiltration. This aspect of the PAVN effort had been virtually ignored since the initiation of the Commando Hunt in 1968. An intelligence collection and technical reassessment effort invited the Air Force to make another attempt to force the North Vietnamese pay for <b>their</b> <b>effort</b> in blood instead of in imported supplies and trucks. The result was Island Tree the launching of a personnel anti-infiltration effort during Commando Hunt VII. However, it was too little and far too late.|$|E
5|$|Sihanouk came {{to believe}} that {{communist}} triumph in Southeast Asia was inevitable and that Cambodia's military was incapable of defeating the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam), even with U.S. support. If Cambodia (and his rule) was to survive, he would have to make a bargain with the devil. On 10 April 1965 he broke off diplomatic relations with the U.S. and swung politically to the left. To gain foreign support, both economic and political, Sihanouk turned to the People's Republic of China. One of the terms of the agreement between Sihanouk and Premier Zhou Enlai was that Cambodia would allow the use of its eastern border by the North Vietnamese in <b>their</b> <b>effort</b> to reunify the two Vietnams.|$|E

When Nintendo declined, they reverse engineered the console and made a demo, Slalom to show the company.

5|$|The Astonishing {{is set in}} a dystopian future United States {{and follows}} the Ravenskill Rebel Militia in their efforts to defy the Great Northern Empire of the Americas using the magical power of music.

5|$|The {{goal of the}} Commando Hunt campaigns was not to halt infiltration, but to {{make the}} North Vietnamese pay too heavy a price for <b>their</b> <b>effort.</b> Corollary to this was the {{destruction}} of as much of their logistical system as possible and to tie down as many PAVN forces in static security roles as possible. Aerial interdiction could not succeed unless Hanoi felt the pressure and relented. The seed of the campaign's failure, however, was sown in its first operation. Despite the expenditure of {{an enormous amount of}} ordnance over five years, the level of that pressure {{was never going to be}} sufficient to deter Hanoi from its goal.|$|E

VT-6 lost 10 of its 14 Devastators, and 10 of Yorktowns VT-3's 12 Devastators were shot down with no hits to show for <b>their</b> <b>effort,</b> {{thanks in part to the}} abysmal performance of their unimproved Mark 13 torpedoes.

5|$|Bohr's {{evidence}} {{came from}} an interpretation of a letter he received from a Soviet friend and scientist in Russia, which he showed to the British security services. He reasoned that the longer the United States and Britain hid their nuclear advancements, Russia would feel increasingly threatened and more inclined to speed up <b>their</b> <b>effort</b> to produce an atomic bomb of their own. With the help of U.S. Supreme Court justice Felix Frankfurter, Bohr met with the President of the United States, Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was initially sympathetic to his ideas about controlling nuclear weapons on 26 August 1944; but Churchill was adamantly opposed to informing the Soviet Union of such work. At the Second Quebec Conference in September 1944, Roosevelt sided with Churchill, deciding {{that it would be}} upon the nation's best interest to keep the atomic bomb project a secret. Moreover, they decided Bohr was potentially dangerous and specific security measures must be made in order to prevent him from leaking information {{to the rest of the}} world, Russia in particular.|$|E
5|$|Following the 2008 {{closing of}} Copia, {{a group of}} investors, developers, advocates, and vintners named the Coalition to Preserve Copia was formed to explore a plan to {{preserve}} the building and grounds.

Copia's bond holder, ACA Financial Guaranty Corporation, listed the property for sale in October 2009. Napa Valley College's upper valley campus became the home of the center's library of around 1,000 cookbooks. By late 2010, local chefs had revived the center's garden and the parking lot had become the location of a weekly farmer's market. In 2011, the museum was reported to still maintain its original furnishings, with the gift store fully stocked and the restaurant still furnished. In an April 2012 auction, most of the center's fixtures, furniture, equipment, wine collection (around 3,500 bottles), dinnerware, displays, artistic items, and antiquities were sold.|$|E
