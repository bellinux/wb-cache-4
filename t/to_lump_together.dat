2500|$|Even so, Julian’s short reign did not {{stem the}} tide of Christianity. The emperor’s {{ultimate}} failure can arguably be attributed to the manifold religious traditions and deities that paganism promulgated. Most pagans sought religious affiliations that were unique to their culture and people, and they had internal divisions that prevented them from creating any one ‘pagan religion.’ Indeed, the term pagan was simply a convenient appellation for Christians <b>to</b> <b>lump</b> <b>together</b> the believers of a system they opposed. In truth, there was no Roman religion, as modern observers would recognize it. [...] Instead, paganism came from a system of observances that one historian has characterized as “no more than a spongy mass of tolerance and tradition.” ...|$|E

These two contradictory concepts are what I would call 'free-market capitalism' on the one hand, and 'state capitalism' on the other." [...] "The difference between free-market capitalism and state capitalism," [...] writes Rothbard, [...] "is precisely the difference between, on the one hand, peaceful, voluntary exchange, and on the other, violent expropriation."

5000|$|In {{response}} to the criticism that the books promote Wicca, a number of Wiccans and other commenters {{have argued that the}} critics' definition of Wicca tends <b>to</b> <b>lump</b> <b>together</b> many and various spiritualist practices that actually have little in common. They have also highlighted the differences between magic within Wicca, which is invocational and derives from the divine powers, and that depicted by the Harry Potter books, which is a purely mechanical application of spells without invoking any deities. A Wiccan review of Harry Potter: Witchcraft Repackaged pointed out that [...] "communing with the dead and spirit world, sorcery, curses, occult symbology, black magic and demon possession"—all cited by the book as evidence of Harry Potter promoting Wicca—are not part of Wiccan belief.|$|E

This vignette starts off as an urticaria referral and then takes several twists and turns before resolution. Currently, no specialty has been successful at motivating its physicians to make it a priority to screen for alpha- 1 antitrypsin deficiency. There is no reason why Allergy-Immunology Specialists cannot take the lead in the recognition and treatment of this disease. Alpha- 1 antitrypsin deficiency (Alpha- 1) is suspected in over 70, 000 people in the USA, and prevalence in certain parts of Europe is higher. Unfortunately, only about 10 % of cases are diagnosed and the failure to recognize and start augmentation leads to increase in morbidity and suspected earlier onset in mortality. The workup in most cases is simple and obtaining alpha- 1 antitrypsin protein level...|$|R

5000|$|The term “chick flick” has {{generated}} several negative {{responses from the}} modern feminist community. Most criticisms of the genre concentrate on the negative consequences that arise from gendering certain interests, in this case film. Author of The Chick Flick Paradox: Derogatory? Feminist? or Both?, Natalia Thompson, states that chick flicks are “an attempt <b>to</b> <b>lump</b> <b>together</b> an entire gender’s interests into one genre.” While the tailoring of interests may seem helpful and natural, many critics argue that unnecessary gendering can have negative consequences on many different social groups. In fact, there is evidence from Russian social scientist Natal'ia Rimashevskaia that gender stereotypes further perpetuated by the media can lead to discrimination against women and limit their “human and intellectual potential.” More criticisms of the term arise from actual content of the films in the chick flick genre and how the content affects society’s perception of women. Some say that chick flicks are micro-aggressions. Micro-aggressions are actions or exchanges that degrade a person based {{on his or her}} membership in a [...] "race, gender, age, and ability." ...|$|E
5000|$|Julian's {{popularity}} {{among the people}} and the army during his brief reign suggest that he might have brought paganism back to the fore of Roman public and private life. In fact, during his lifetime, neither pagan nor Christian ideology reigned supreme, and the greatest thinkers of the day argued about the merits and rationality of each religion. Most importantly for the pagan cause, though, Rome was still a predominantly pagan empire that had not wholly accepted Christianity. Even so, Julian’s short reign did not stem the tide of Christianity. The emperor’s ultimate failure can arguably be attributed to the manifold religious traditions and deities that paganism promulgated. Most pagans sought religious affiliations that were unique to their culture and people, and they had internal divisions that prevented them from creating any one ‘pagan religion.’ Indeed, the term pagan was simply a convenient appellation for Christians <b>to</b> <b>lump</b> <b>together</b> the believers of a system they opposed.

5000|$|The first {{recorded}} {{usage of the}} suffix ism as a separate word {{in its own right}} was in 1680. By the nineteenth century it was being used by Thomas Carlyle to signify a pre-packaged ideology. It was later used in this sense by such writers as Julian Huxley and George Bernard Shaw. In the United States of the mid-nineteenth century, the phrase [...] "the isms" [...] was used as a collective derogatory term <b>to</b> <b>lump</b> <b>together</b> the radical social reform movements of the day (such as slavery abolitionism, feminism, alcohol prohibitionism, Fourierism, pacifism, early socialism, etc.) and various spiritual or religious movements considered non-mainstream {{by the standards of the}} time (such as Transcendentalism, spiritualism or [...] "spirit rapping", Mormonism, the Oneida movement often accused of [...] "free love", etc.). Southerners often prided themselves on the American South being free from all of these pernicious [...] "Isms" [...] (except for alcohol temperance campaigning, which was compatible with a traditional Protestant focus on strict individual morality). So on September 5 and 9, 1856, the Examiner newspaper of Richmond, Virginia ran editorials on [...] "Our Enemies, the Isms and their Purposes", while in 1858 [...] "Parson" [...] Brownlow called for a [...] "Missionary Society of the South, for the Conversion of the Freedom Shriekers, Spiritualists, Free-lovers, Fourierites, and Infidel Reformers of the North" [...] (see The Freedom-of-thought Struggle in the Old South by Clement Eaton).
