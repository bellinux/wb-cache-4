25|$|In many ways, Otso was a {{significant}} departure from the traditional Finnish icebreaker design. The extended bridge wings on top of <b>the</b> <b>stylish</b> superstructure feature full-depth all-round windows that provide almost 360 degree visibility from the main steering position, which has been moved to the starboard bridge wing from the centerline. Furthermore, the traditional colours dating back to the Imperial Russian era, yellow and black, were replaced with the colors of the flag of Finland, blue and white. Due to the extensive use of advanced automation, which allowed everything ranging from starting and stopping the main engines to raising and lowering the flag to be done remotely from the bridge, Otso had the smallest crew among Finnish state-owned icebreakers when she entered service in 1986. Later her crew has been further reduced to 20. Otso was also the first icebreaker in which the lifeboats, unusable in ice-infested waters, were replaced with inflatable life rafts that could be lowered on the ice.|$|E

They added 127 for the second wicket, then Graveney put on 105 with Denis Compton (50) for the third. There was a small collapse from 243/2 to 281/6, but Vic Wilson (cricketer) (62 not out) and Johnny Wardle entertained with 111 for the sixth wicket and Hutton declared at 427/7 on the second morning, Noel Diprose the best of the bowlers with 4/107. The Tasmanians had no answer to the in-swing and off-cutters of Peter Loader who took 6/22 off 12 eight-ball overs and were out for 117, captain Emerson Rodwell had to retire hurt on 2, but returned to be bowled by Loader for 11. Hutton, 310 runs ahead elected to bat again, perhaps to entertain the Saturday crowd the next day and sent in nightwatchmen Frank Tyson to open with Reg Simpson. Simpson failed again, ending his chances of playing in the Tests and Bob Appleyard joined Tyson. The MCC scratched round the next day for 133/6 declared, Tyson's 27 was the top score and Terence Cowley took 4/53.

25|$|As the {{defending}} champions, India {{went into the}} 2015 World Cup co-hosted by Australia and New Zealand with high expectations and were billed pre-tournament favourites. Unlike in 2007 and 2011, this time India went into the World Cup {{on the back of}} poor results, with a mediocre Australian tour preceding the event. Despite this, it was expected that India would still do well in the World Cup due to their familiarity with the Australian conditions, having already spent more than 2 months there. The Indian team for the 2015 World Cup comprised only 4 members from the 2011 World Cup-winning squad, which included captain and wicketkeeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Virat Kohli, who was now the vice-captain of the side {{and one of the best}} batsmen in ODI cricket, Suresh Raina and Ravichandran Ashwin. For the first time since the 1987 World Cup, the Indian World Cup squad was without Sachin Tendulkar, who had retired from all forms of cricket in 2013, while the other stars of the 2011 World Cup such as Virender Sehwag, Yuvraj Singh, Gautam Gambhir, Harbhajan Singh and Zaheer Khan were dropped due to poor form. Despite the absence of these key performers, the Indian World Cup squad was still a strong side, with a power-packed batting lineup comprising Kohli, Dhoni, Raina, destructive openers Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan and <b>the</b> <b>stylish</b> middle-order bat Ajinkya Rahane, and a strong bowling attack comprising pacers Mohammed Shami, Umesh Yadav, Mohit Sharma and Bhuvneshwar Kumar, supplemented by the spinners Ashwin and all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja. The 1996 World Cup format, which was also used in 2011, was used for the last time in the World Cup, as the 2019 World Cup would see the return of the round-robin format last used in 1992. In the Group Stage, India were placed in Group B with arch-rivals Pakistan, South Africa, the West Indies, minnows Zimbabwe and associates Ireland and the UAE.|$|E
25|$|On to the Adelaide Oval, {{or rather}} {{not as the}} SACA ringed off the famously long curves, much to the {{disappointment}} of those who liked seeing all-run fives when batsmen hit a straight-drive. South Australia had not won the Sheffield Shield for ten years, but were to do so again in 1963-64 {{with the help of}} their multi-talented import Gary Sobers. They were captained by the old favourite Les Favell and had a 19-year-old Ian Chappell in the team, but their Chinaman bowler David Sincock was unable to play because of his exams. The Melbourne Cup was due to be played during the match, so Ted Dexter and the Duke were off to the races and Colin Cowdrey was in charge. Favell won the toss, batted, and saw his side make steady progress to 324/7 {{by the end of the}} day. Favell was first out for 7 and his fellow-opener John Causby was run out by Ken Barrington and wicket-keeper Alan Smith for 16, but John Lill (87) and Gary Sobers (42) stroked their way to a third-wicket stand of 113 before they were both out on 154, along with Neil Dansie for a duck and South Australia were 154/4. Ian McLachlan (53) and Ian Chappell (36) added 66 before the youngster tripped over himself while hooking Brian Statham and hit the wicket with his bat. Statham (4/58) cleared up the tail with 3 wickets for 11 runs and South Australia were out for 335. Fred Titmus (1/80) and Ray Illingworth (0/43) failed to turn the ball on the notoriously flat wicket and Cowdrey set up defensive fields which rather relied on the batsmen getting themselves out, still the runs flowed enough and the crowd enjoyed themselves. Cowdrey was out for this third consecutive duck when acting as opener, but everybody else had a fine time; Geoff Pullar (21) added 55 for the second-wicket with Ken Barrington (102), who added another 168 with <b>the</b> <b>stylish</b> Tom Graveney (99), beating the third-wicket record for the MCC vs South Australia set by Plum Warner and George Gunn in 1911-12. Graveney was the more polished of the two, but Barrington hit Neil Hawke (6/130) for 4 boundaries in five balls. They and Peter Parfitt (15) were all out by 257/5, but the depth of the MCC batting was shown by Fred Titmus who hit a solid 137 not out, his highest first class century, adding 108 runs with Barry Knight (55) and 121 with wicket-keeper Alan Smith (another 55) and Cowdrey declared on 508/9. South Australia knocked off the 173 run deficit the same day, making 174/5 by stumps, with Sobers (99) run out by Statham going for his 100th run and everybody else chipping in. A shower of rain allowed everybody to get off the field to watch the Melbourne Cup and Favell declared on 283/7 to leave the MCC 67 minutes to make 111 runs. They made 95/1, thanks to some quick hitting by Pullar (56), but after playing into more rain they gave up 16 runs short in an affable, but farcical end. On a flat wicket with indifferent bowling the teams made 1,221 runs in four days despite the rain.|$|E

[...] The Times of India rated the film four out of five, praising the performances of Ganesan, Saroja Devi, Janaki and Radha, and stated, [...] "Coupled with <b>the</b> <b>stylish</b> visuals of KV Prasad and a haunting score by the composer duo MS Viswanathan and TK Ramamurthy, the film proves to be an irresistible thriller."

[...] Christie also thought that [...] "Connery has lost none of his charm and, if anything, is more appealing than ever as <b>the</b> <b>stylish</b> resolute hero." [...] David Robinson, writing in The Times also concentrated on Connery, saying that: [...] "Connery... is back, looking hardly a day older or thicker, and still outclassing every other exponent of the role, in the goodnatured throwaway with which he parries all the sex and violence on the way". For Robinson, the presence of Connery and Klaus Maria Brandauer as Maximillian Largo [...] "very nearly make it all worthwhile." [...] The reviewer for Time Out summed up Never Say Never Again saying [...] "The action's good, the photography excellent, the sets decent; but the real clincher {{is the fact that}} Bond is once more played by a man with the right stuff." ...|$|E
500|$|Gameplay in Devil May Cry 4 {{is similar}} to {{previous}} games in the series. The player must fight through levels called [...] "missions", occasionally solving puzzles or gathering items. Performance in a mission is graded from D being the bottom grade through C, B, A, S, SS, and SSS being the highest grade. Grades are based on items used, Red Orbs gathered, time taken, {{and the amount of}} Style Points accumulated. Each Style Point grade has its own tag-word. <b>The</b> <b>stylish</b> grade shows up {{on the side of the}} screen and starts at [...] "Deadly"(D); progresses through [...] "Carnage"(C), [...] "Brutal"(B), and [...] "Atomic"(A); then, progresses through one last bar of grade containing the phrases [...] "Smokin'"(S), [...] "Smokin' Style"(SS), and lastly [...] "Smokin' Sick Style"(SSS). Stylish combat is the main focus of the game, which is conveyed through unbroken combos of varied attacks while avoiding damage. The player must avoid enemy attacks to continue performing combos, often by memorizing attack patterns. The Devil Trigger is a super state that enables the player to become more powerful adding a slow but steady health regeneration, with increased damage done. Devil Trigger can be activated by pressing the button to trigger it when the minimum amount on the gauge is filled.|$|E

[...] John Hall of The Independent described the song as more new material from the [...] "hardest-working man in hip hop" [...] and that the [...] "10-minute single works its way through every genre of contemporary pop, from club banger to slow jam." [...] Nathan S. of the DJBooth described the song as a sprawling affair, noting that it contains [...] "hazy and ambient cut that manages to weave in soaring guitars and ‘90s funk synths." [...] Alexis Petridis of The Guardian mused that the track seemed ambitious {{to the point of}} sounding slightly daft, and that the track was [...] "certainly unlike anything else in current R" [...] PopMatterss Brice Ezell stated that all it takes is one listen to 'Pyramids', the shape-shifting opus of channel ORANGE to cement Ocean’s status as one of contemporary R vital songwriters.|$|E

500|$|Upon release, {{the game}} was {{critically}} acclaimed.

Edge cited that it was hard to criticise [...] "such a beautifully realised and well-produced game which [...] the PlayStation’s power so well", but did show similar concerns over the game's longevity regarding its [...] "reliance on track-based power-ups" [...] that would [...] "limit Wipeout’s lifespan" [...] in comparison to Super Mario Kart. GamePro gave the PlayStation version a rave review, predicting that [...] "Wipeout's taut action and grueling courses will lure many diehard racing fans to this new system." [...] They particularly praised the challenging gameplay and precision controls. They said the fact that multiplayer is only through the PlayStation Link Cable is the game's one major flaw, since the PlayStation still had a low installed base at this point and thus this would not be an option for most players. A reviewer for Next Generation applauded <b>the</b> <b>stylish</b> and detailed visuals, the [...] "heart-pounding soundtrack", and particularly the exhilarating feel of the racing.
