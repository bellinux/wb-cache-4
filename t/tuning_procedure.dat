40|$|Abstract. Obviously, {{it is not}} a {{good idea}} to apply an {{optimization}} algorithm with wrongly speci ed parameter settings, a situation which can be avoided by applying algorithm <b>tuning.</b> Sequential <b>tuning</b> <b>procedures</b> are considered more e cient than single-stage procedures. [1] introduced a sequential approach for algorithm tuning that has been successfully applied to several real-world optimization tasks and experimental studies. The sequential procedure requires the speci cation of an initial sample size k. Small k values lead to poor models and thus poor predictions for the subsequent stages, whereas large values prevent an extensive search and local ne tuning. This study analyzes the interaction between global and local search in sequential <b>tuning</b> <b>procedures</b> and gives recommendations for an adequate budget allocation. Furthermore, the integration of hypothesis testing for increasing e ectiveness of the latter phase is investigated. ...|$|R
50|$|Immediately {{prior to}} use in a performance, the leather {{covering}} the wider aperture is made moist and a spot of paste made from semolina (rawa) and water {{is applied to the}} center, which lowers the pitch of the left membrane and gives it a very powerful resonating bass sound. Nowadays, rubber gum is also used to loosen the membrane helping in creating the bass sound, and its advantage is that unlike semolina, it will not stick on hands. The artist tunes the instrument by varying the tension in the leather straps spanning the hull of the instrument. This is achieved by placing the mridangam upright with its larger side facing down, and then striking the tension-bearing straps located along of circumference of the right membrane with a heavy object (such as a stone). A wooden peg is sometimes placed between the stone and the mridangam during the <b>tuning</b> <b>procedure</b> to ensure that the force is exerted at precisely the point where it is needed. Striking the periphery of the right membrane in the direction toward the hull raises the pitch, while striking the periphery from the opposite side (away from the hull) lowers the pitch. The pitch must be uniform and balanced at all points along the circumference of the valanthalai for the sound to resonate perfectly. The pitch can be balanced {{with the aid of a}} pitch pipe or a tambura. The larger membrane can also be tuned in a similar manner, though it is not done as frequently. Note that since the leather straps are interwoven between both the smaller and larger aperture, adjusting the tension on one side often can affect the tension on the other.|$|E

Our methods {{are designed to}} target the <b>tuning</b> <b>procedures</b> of semiconductor double quantum dot in GaAs heterostructures, but can easily be adapted to other quantum-dot-like qubit systems.

40|$|When {{assessing}} Northeast Arctic cod it {{is assumed}} that the estimates of numbers at age generated by a converged VPA type analysis are equal, on average, to the true numbers at age. Based on fishery independent survey data, we show that {{it is likely that the}} converged VPA estimates are biased, especially so for small cohorts. The probable cause of this bias is either inaccurate catch data including erroneous age readings and/or using the wrong functional form in the VPA <b>tuning</b> <b>procedure.</b> We provide evidence that it is appropriate to assume that the expected survey-based estimates are proportional to actual abundance. Therefore, we suggest that proportionality should be assumed for all ages when calculating survey catchability (i. e. in the VPA <b>tuning</b> <b>procedure)</b> or using the survey to estimate abundance directly. Since the converged VPA estimates of small cohorts seem to have a relatively high bias compared with those for large cohorts, only the converged VPA estimates for large cohorts should be used in the tuning process. This will not eliminate the bias in the VPA estimates caused by the <b>tuning</b> <b>procedure,</b> but it should reduce it...|$|E
