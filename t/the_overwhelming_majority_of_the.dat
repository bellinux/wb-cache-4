5|$|It was now common {{knowledge}} that Edward was dying, and foreign diplomats suspected that some scheme to debar Mary was under way. France found {{the prospect of the}} emperor's cousin on the English throne disagreeable and engaged in secret talks with Northumberland, indicating support. The diplomats were certain that <b>the</b> <b>overwhelming</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> English people backed Mary, but nevertheless believed that Queen Jane would be successfully established.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>overwhelming</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> music {{used was}} British. The team worked {{next door to}} the office of the musical {{director}} for the closing ceremony, David Arnold, and so hearing each other's music there was a scramble to claim a particular song first. A.R. Rahman, who worked with Boyle on Slumdog Millionaire and 127 Hours, composed a Punjabi song 'Nimma Nimma' to showcase Indian influence in the UK, according to Boyle's wishes. More Indian music was also scheduled for inclusion in the medley. Paul McCartney was to be the ceremony's closing act.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC) {{remotely}} operated vehicle, KAIKO, collected sediment core from the Challenger Deep. 432 living specimens of soft-walled foraminifera {{were identified in}} the sediment samples. Foraminifera are single-celled protists that construct shells. There are an estimated 4,000 species of living foraminifera. Out of the 432 organisms collected, <b>the</b> <b>overwhelming</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sample consisted of simple, soft-shelled foraminifera, with others representing species of the complex, multi-chambered genera Leptohalysis and Reophax. Overall, 85% of the specimens consisted of soft-shelled allogromids. This is unusual compared to samples of sediment-dwelling organisms from other deep-sea environments, where the percentage of organic-walled foraminifera ranges from 5% to 20% of the total. Small organisms with hard calciferous shells have trouble growing at extreme depths because the water at that depth is severely lacking in calcium carbonate.|$|E
