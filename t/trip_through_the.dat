5|$|After Germany's {{conquest of}} Romania (see Romania during World War I), the German Imperial Navy had {{sufficient}} fuel oil for submarines {{located in the}} Black Sea. UB-44 and three of her sister ships in the Pola Flotilla were ordered to Constantinople and, en route, had to navigate through the Dardanelles, which had been heavily mined by the Allies {{in the middle of}} 1916. UB-44 departed from Cattaro on 8 August for Hersingstand (located on the Gallipoli peninsula) to pick up a pilot for the <b>trip</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Dardanelles, but never arrived.|$|E
5|$|Following this failure, Krugers {{made the}} {{documentary}} Atma De Vischer (1931), which followed Queen Wilhelmina and Prince Hendrik on a <b>trip</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Hague, before being signed to Tan's Film. With Tan's, Krugers made two films. First {{he was asked}} to handle cinematography on Bachtiar Effendi's 1932 talkie Njai Dasima, an adaptation of G. Francis' 1896 novel Tjerita Njai Dasima (Story of Njai Dasima). He then directed and produced Huwen op Bevel (Forced to Marry; 1931), which was advertised as featuring songs and comedy. The film was a commercial failure, leading to all rights being acquired by Tan's. He is recorded as planning a further two films, De Nona (Of Ladies) and Raonah, but neither was made.|$|E
5|$|On August28, 1869, {{three men}} deserted the expedition, {{convinced}} {{that they could not}} possibly survive the <b>trip</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Grand Canyon. They were killed by Native Americans after making it to the rim of the canyon; two days later, the expedition ran the last of the Grand Canyon rapids and reached St. Thomas. Powell led a second expedition in 1871, this time with financial backing from the U.S. government. The explorers named many features along the Colorado and Green rivers, including Glen Canyon, the Dirty Devil River, Flaming Gorge, and the Gates of Lodore. In what is perhaps a twist of irony, modern-day Lake Powell, which floods Glen Canyon, is also named for their leader.|$|E

25|$|As the 2000s dawned, {{the group}} went into semi-retirement and {{cut back on}} touring. However, in 2002, they devised a new live show based on their roots in the 1970s.

The group returned to the studio and recorded an album of the show's songs. Again, this album was not released in shops, but was available on CD at the show's venues. The tracks did get a general release later on however on various compilation albums. In 2004, the first Brotherhood of Man DVD was released, featuring TV performances of many of their singles.|$|E

25|$|The lungs {{activate}} one hormone. The physiologically inactive decapeptide angiotensin I {{is converted}} to the aldosterone-releasing octapeptide, angiotensin II, in the pulmonary circulation. The reaction occurs in other tissues as well, but it is particularly prominent in the lungs. Angiotensin II also has a direct effect on arteriolar walls, causing arteriolar vasoconstriction, and consequently a rise in arterial blood pressure. Large amounts of the angiotensin-converting enzyme responsible for this activation are located on the surfaces of the endothelial cells of the alveolar capillaries. The converting enzyme also inactivates bradykinin. Circulation time through the alveolar capillaries is less than one second, yet 70% of the angiotensin I reaching the lungs {{is converted to}} angiotensin II in a single <b>trip</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> capillaries. Four other peptidases have been identified {{on the surface of}} the pulmonary endothelial cells.|$|E
25|$|The vanguard {{company now}} faced a more rugged and {{hazardous}} journey, and {{were concerned about}} negotiating the passes of the Rocky Mountains. They had received conflicting advice, but Young chose to follow the trail used by the Donner-Reed party on their journey to California the previous year. Shortly after leaving Fort Bridger, the group met trapper Miles Goodyear, who owned a trading post {{at the mouth of}} the Weber River. He was enthusiastic about the agricultural potential of the large Weber Valley. During the <b>trip</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> rugged mountains, the vanguard company divided into three sections. Since crossing the Green River, several members of the party had suffered from a fever, generally accepted as a “mountain fever” probably induced by wood ticks. Young himself became ill soon after meeting Goodyear. The small sick detachment lagged behind the larger group, and a scouting division was created to move ahead on the designated route.|$|E
25|$|In 1910 Gregory {{stopped working}} as a lawyer and began a lifelong service to the {{religion}} largely by holding meetings and traveling for the religion and wrote and lectured {{on the subject of}} racial unity and the religion. That year Gregory initiated a major <b>trip</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> South to promulgate the religion. He travelled to Richmond, Virginia, Durham, North Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina, the city of his family and childhood, and Macon, Georgia. After this first trip Gregory went on pilgrimage and was elected to positions in the religion and worked on concerns in race-integration in Washington D.C. which were settled with `Abdu'l-Bahá's visit, and his marriage - Gregory eventually returned to traveling to promote the religion but his endeavors were national in scope against a backdrop of societal challenges like Lynching in the United States and Jim Crow laws amidst Racism in the United States and instances of Mass racial violence in the United States.|$|E

25|$|The Second World War overshadowed, for a time, {{almost all}} {{intellectual}} and artistic production. In 1939 Wolfgang Paalen {{was the first}} to leave Paris for the New World as exile. After a long <b>trip</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> forests of British-Columbia, he settled in Mexico and founded his influential art-magazine Dyn. In 1940 Yves Tanguy married American Surrealist painter Kay Sage. In 1941, Breton went to the United States, where he co-founded the short-lived magazine VVV with Max Ernst, Marcel Duchamp, and the American artist David Hare. However, it was the American poet, Charles Henri Ford, and his magazine View which offered Breton a channel for promoting Surrealism in the United States. The View special issue on Duchamp was crucial for the public understanding of Surrealism in America. It stressed his connections to Surrealist methods, offered interpretations of his work by Breton, as well as Breton's view that Duchamp represented the bridge between early modern movements, such as Futurism and Cubism, to Surrealism. Wolfgang Paalen left the group in 1942 due to political/philosophical differences with Breton.|$|E
25|$|After {{spending}} some time being tutored by teacher Iordache, whom the text depicts as a drunk, a sudden outbreak of cholera kills his teacher and pushes Smaranda and Ștefan to send their child out of the village. Nică follows the path of transhumance and is assigned {{to the care of}} shepherds, but he himself falls ill with what the narrator claims was cholera, and, upon returning home with a high fever, is instantly cured with a folk remedy of vinegar and lovage. A while after, claiming insolvency, Ștefan withdraws his son from school. Owing to Smaranda's persistence, the child follows his maternal grandfather David Creangă to Broșteni, where he and his cousin Dumitru are enlisted in a more affordable establishment. This requires adaptation on the part of Nică and Dumitru, both of whom weep once their long hair is shaved off on the new teacher's orders. They are both hosted by a middle-aged woman, Irinuca, in a small house on the Bistrița, where their proximity to goats results in a scabies infection. Creangă then recounts how, while attempting to cure themselves with frequent baths in the river, he and his cousin dislodged a cliff which rolled down and tore through Irinuca's household. After leaving Broșteni in a hurry and spending a while in Borca, the two children hasten for David Creangă's home in Pipirig. After an eventful <b>trip</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Eastern Carpathians, the two boys arrive in the village, where they are welcomed by David's wife Nastasia. She cures their scabies using another local remedy, birch extract.|$|E
