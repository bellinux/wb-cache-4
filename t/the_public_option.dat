5|$|On November 7, 2009, {{a health}} care bill {{featuring}} <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>option</b> was passed in the House. On December 24, 2009, the Senate passed its own bill—without a public option—on a party-line vote of 60–39. On March 21, 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) passed by the Senate in December was passed in the House {{by a vote of}} 219 to 212. Obama signed the bill into law on March 23, 2010.|$|E
5|$|Obama {{called for}} Congress to pass {{legislation}} reforming {{health care in the}} United States, a key campaign promise and a top legislative goal. He proposed an expansion of health insurance coverage to cover the uninsured, to cap premium increases, and to allow people to retain their coverage when they leave or change jobs. His proposal was to spend $900billion over 10 years and include a government insurance plan, also known as <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>option,</b> to compete with the corporate insurance sector as a main component to lowering costs and improving quality of health care. It would also make it illegal for insurers to drop sick people or deny them coverage for pre-existing conditions, and require every American to carry health coverage. The plan also includes medical spending cuts and taxes on insurance companies that offer expensive plans.|$|E
25|$|A model {{similar to}} one {{proposed}} by the late Senator Ted Kennedy would bring in between 21.5 million and 67.5 million according to the group. A 2008 report by the Urban Institute stated <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>option</b> would probably settle into a 'niche' in the insurance market with other firms still able to compete.|$|E

25|$|A CNN {{report has}} stated that <b>the</b> {{proposed}} <b>public</b> <b>option</b> is a 'lightning rod' in American public opinion about healthcare reform. Republicans, people with the insurance industry, and employer groups have discussed the concern that {{the availability of a}} public plan would make it difficult for private insurers to compete. This may then lead to a situation where most people end up being covered by <b>the</b> <b>public</b> insurance <b>option.</b>|$|R

25|$|The act creates new standards, {{intended}} by lawmakers as methods of consumer protection, {{for what would}} be considered a minimally acceptable insurance plan. Employers that currently offer insurance have a five-year grace period after the act begins before they would be subject to the standards. Individuals would be free to purchase their own private insurance, or work with <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>option,</b> in this period and afterward.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to Republican arguments that the Obama administration's preferred {{health care bill}} was too long and complicated, Grayson on March 9, 2010, introduced H.R. 4789, <b>the</b> <b>Public</b> <b>Option</b> Act (sometimes called the Medicare You Can Buy Into Act), a four-page bill that would allow all citizens and permanent residents of the United States {{to buy into the}} public Medicare program at cost. The bill attracted 82 co-sponsors and was referred to the Ways and Means Committee.|$|E
25|$|As Senator, he {{introduced}} and championed the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010 and legislation {{that led to}} the creation of the Department of Homeland Security. During debate on the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as the crucial 60th vote needed to pass the legislation, Lieberman's opposition to <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>option</b> was critical for its removal from the resulting bill. Lieberman announced in January 2011 that he would retire from the Senate at the end of his term, and he did so in January 2013.|$|E

In mid-November, it was reported that 40 House Democrats said they will not support a final bill containing the Amendment's provisions. Stupak has said that 15–20 Democrats will oppose adoption of the Senate bill because of objections to its abortion provisions as well as its tax on high-value health insurance plans. In March 2010, Stupak voted for the Senate language health care bill excluding the Stupak Amendment language.|$|E
25|$|A {{statistical}} analysis {{of the impact of}} political contributions on individual senators' support for the public insurance option conducted by Nate Silver has suggested that Baucus was an unlikely supporter of <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>option</b> in the first place. Based on Baucus's political ideology and the per capita health care spending in Montana, Silver's model projects that there would be only a 30.6% probability of Baucus supporting a public insurance option even if he had received no relevant campaign contributions. Silver calculates that the impact on Baucus of the significant campaign contributions that he has received from the health care industry further reduces the probability of his supporting a public insurance option from 30.6% to 0.6%.|$|E

50|$|In 1981, it was {{reported}} that the Winter Gardens cost the council £1,000 per week to run and was losing £80,000 per year (£276,610.16 adjusted for inflation) At a meeting held at Weston College, attended by 200 members of <b>the</b> <b>public,</b> <b>options</b> were discussed concerning the Winter Gardens' future - including the proposed demolition of {{all or part of the}} building. Other ideas included building a seven-storey hotel on the site of the pavilion or keeping the Winter Gardens and developing part of the Italian Gardens to extend the High Street. Over 7,000 people signed a petition to save the building, and it was decided that the council should pay the deficit using a percentage of the council's tax rates.|$|R

2500|$|The Congressional Budget Office's {{analysis}} in late July stated {{that this would}} not be the case for the [...] "public option" [...] included in H.R. 3200, projecting that only about 11 to 12 million people would enroll in <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>option.</b> The Lewin Group, a research firm that is part of a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group but is run independently, has estimated that over 100 million people would join the public plan if it were structured like Medicare, which would then make it the dominant insurer.|$|E
5000|$|Ultimately, <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>option</b> {{was removed}} from the final bill. While the United States House of Representatives passed a public option in their version of the bill, <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>option</b> was voted down in the Senate Finance Committee and <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>option</b> was never {{included}} in the final Senate bill, instead opting for state-directed health insurance exchanges. [...] Critics of the removal of <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>option</b> accused President Obama of making an agreement to drop <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>option</b> from the final plan, but the record showed that the agreement was based on vote counts rather than backroom deals, as substantiated by the final vote in the Senate.|$|E

50|$|The {{public health}} {{insurance}} option, {{also known as the}} public insurance option or <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>option,</b> is a proposal to create a government-run health insurance agency that would compete with other private health insurance companies within the United States. <b>The</b> <b>public</b> <b>option</b> {{is not the same as}} publicly funded health care, but was proposed as an alternative health insurance plan offered by the government. <b>The</b> <b>public</b> <b>option</b> was initially proposed for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, but was removed after Sen. Joe Lieberman (I-CT) threatened a filibuster.|$|E
50|$|The purpose behind <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>option</b> was to {{make more}} {{affordable}} health insurance for uninsured citizens who are either unable to afford the rates of or are rejected by private health insurers. Supporters argued that a government insurance company could successfully lower its rates by using greater leverage than private industry when negotiating with hospitals and doctors, as well as paying the employees of <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>option</b> insurance company salaries as opposed to paying based on individual medical procedures.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>public</b> <b>option</b> was {{featured}} in three bills considered by the United States House of Representatives in 2009: the proposed Affordable Health Care for America Act (...) , which {{was passed by the}} House in 2009, its predecessor, the proposed America's Affordable Health Choices Act (...) , and a third bill, <b>the</b> <b>Public</b> <b>Option</b> Act, also referred to as the [...] "Medicare You Can Buy Into Act", (...) [...] In the first two bills, <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>option</b> took the form of a Qualified Health Benefit Plan competing with similar private insurance plans in an internet-based exchange or marketplace, enabling citizens and small businesses to purchase health insurance meeting a minimum federal standard. <b>The</b> <b>Public</b> <b>Option</b> Act, in contrast, would have allowed all citizens and permanent residents to buy into a public option by participating in the public Medicare program. Individuals covered by other employer plans or by state insurance plans such as Medicare would have not been eligible to obtain coverage from the exchange. The federal government's health insurance plan would have been financed entirely by premiums without subsidy from the Federal government, although some plans called for government seed money to get the programs started.|$|E
