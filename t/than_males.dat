5|$|Males have {{relatively}} small testes {{compared to other}} lemurs, and their canine teeth are {{the same size as}} those seen in females. During the dry season, females can weigh more <b>than</b> <b>males.</b> Both patterns of sexual dimorphism are consistent with the theory of sexual selection for monogamous species and female dominance respectively. Females have two pairs of nipples.|$|E
5|$|There {{does not}} appear to be a {{difference}} in motivation for self-harm in adolescent males and females. For example, for both genders there is an incremental increase in deliberate self-harm associated with an increase in consumption of cigarettes, drugs and alcohol. Triggering factors such as low self-esteem and having friends and family members who self-harm are also common between both males and females. One limited study found that, among those young individuals who do self-harm, both genders are just as equally likely to use the method of skin-cutting. However, females who self-cut are more likely <b>than</b> <b>males</b> to explain their self-harm episode by saying that they had wanted to punish themselves. In New Zealand, more females are hospitalised for intentional self-harm <b>than</b> <b>males.</b> Females more commonly choose methods such as self-poisoning that generally are not fatal, but still serious enough to require hospitalisation.|$|E
5|$|They are a notably sexually dimorphic species, females being {{consistently}} smaller <b>than</b> <b>males.</b> The size {{difference between}} males and females is proportionally greater in the larger tiger subspecies, with males weighing up to 1.7 times more than females. Males also have wider forepaw pads than females, enabling gender to be told from tracks.|$|E

40|$|The {{issue of}} higher female <b>than</b> <b>male</b> {{mortality}} during childhood {{in developing countries}} has recently generated considerable interest. This paper presents additional evidence on this subject, based upon an analysis of longitudinal data from children in rural Bangladesh. Initially, the basis for higher female <b>than</b> <b>male</b> mortality in patriarchal societies is explored, and more specifically, {{the rationale for the}} differential valuation of male and female offspring. The pattern, timing and magnitude of sex differentials in mortality during infancy and early childhood is subsequently examined for children in our study. The paper concludes with a review of possible behavioral mechanisms which may contribute to higher female <b>than</b> <b>male</b> mortality during childhood. ...|$|R

5|$|American kestrels in Canada and the {{northern}} United States typically migrate south in the winter, sometimes going as far as Central America and the Caribbean. Birds that breed south of about 35° north latitude are usually year-round residents. Migration also depends on local weather conditions. Wintering kestrels' choice of habitat varies by sex. Females are found in open areas more often <b>than</b> <b>males</b> during the non-breeding season. A common explanation for this behavior is that the larger females arrive at the preferred habitat first and exclude males from their territory.|$|E
5|$|Banded sea kraits {{primarily}} feed on {{varieties of}} eels, but also eat small fish. Males and females exhibit sexual dimorphism in hunting behavior, as adult females, which are significantly larger <b>than</b> <b>males,</b> prefer to hunt in deeper water for larger conger eels, while adult males hunt in shallower water for smaller moray eels. In addition, females hunt {{for only one}} prey item per foraging bout, while males often hunt for multiple items. After hunting, the banded sea kraits return to land in order to digest their prey.|$|E

Bottlenose Dolphin can jump at a height of 6 meters (20 feet) up in the air; they use this to communicate with one another.|$|E
5|$|Campbell's dwarf hamsters {{may also}} live near areas of human civilization. In Mongolia, {{they may be}} found in yurts to keep warm during the winter, as they do not have {{thermoregulation}} like the Djungarian hamster. They have five main predators: the Eurasian eagle owl, the steppe eagle, the corsac fox, the common kestrel, and the saker falcon. All distribution areas have more females <b>than</b> <b>males,</b> because males are at higher risk from predators, as they cannot move as quickly.|$|E
5|$|Hashimoto's {{thyroiditis}} is an autoimmune {{disorder in}} which the thyroid gland is infltrated by the lymphocytes B-cell and T-cells. These progressively destroy the thyroid gland. In this way, Hasimoto's thyroiditis may have occurred insidiously, and only be noticed when thyroid hormone production decreases, causing symptoms of hypothyroidism. Hashimoto's {{is more common in}} females <b>than</b> <b>males,</b> much more common after the age of 60, and has known genetic risk factors. Also more common in individuals with Hashimoto's thyroiditis are type 1 diabetes, pernicious anaemia, Addison's disease vitiligo.|$|E

The purpose was to {{investigate}} variables that have been identified as ACL risk factors during a landing task to determine differences among male and female athletes and non-athletes (N = 100). Variables included knee angle at contact, maximum knee angle, time (contact to max angle), VGRF, and muscle activation. Male non-athletes bent the knees significantly more after contact <b>than</b> <b>male</b> athletes. Male athletes landed with significantly more force per body weight <b>than</b> <b>male</b> non-athletes or female athletes and male non-athletes landed with significantly more force than female non-athletes. No other significant differences were observed. The authors concluded that the high rate of ACL injury among female athletes cannot be explained by the landing strategy employed in a jump...|$|R

5|$|It {{is often}} {{difficult}} to superficially distinguish between male and female bigfin reef squids. Some authors say that females are generally smaller <b>than</b> <b>males,</b> but this distinction is not observed in other studies. Closer examination of sexually mature specimens, however, will usually distinguish males from females by the presence of the hectocotylus on the fourth left arm in males, and the nidamental glands and the pale ovaries within the mantle in females. Males also purportedly show a more conspicuous pattern of transverse streaks on their dorsal side.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of the {{territorial}} behaviour of caecilians, but some frogs and salamanders defend home ranges. These are usually feeding, breeding or sheltering sites. Males normally exhibit such behaviour though in some species, females and even juveniles are also involved. Although in many frog species, females are larger <b>than</b> <b>males,</b> {{this is not the}} case in most species where males are actively involved in territorial defence. Some of these have specific adaptations such as enlarged teeth for biting or spines on the chest, arms or thumbs.|$|E
40|$|Background: Frequently, in {{dioecious}} plants, female plants allocate {{more resources}} to reproduction <b>than</b> <b>male</b> plants. Therefore {{it is expected that}} asymmetrical allocation to reproduction may lead to a reproduction-growth tradeoff, whereby female plants grow less <b>than</b> <b>male</b> plants, but invest more in defenses and thus experience lower herbivory <b>than</b> <b>male</b> plants. Methodology/Principal Findings: We tested these expectations by comparing resource allocation to reproduction, growth and defense and its consequences on herbivory in three sympatric dioecious Chamaedorea palms (C. alternans, C. pinnatifrons and C. ernesti-augusti) using a pair-wise design (replicated male/female neighboring plants) in a Mexican tropical rain forest. Our findings support the predictions. Biomass allocation to reproduction in C. pinnatifrons was 3 -times higher in female <b>than</b> <b>male</b> plants, consistent with what is known in C. alternans and C. ernesti-augusti. Growth (height and leaf production rate and biomass production) was higher in male plants of all three species. Female plants of the three species had traits that suggest greater investment in defense, as they had 4 – 16 % tougher leaves, and 8 – 18 % higher total phenolic compounds concentration. Accordingly, female plants sustained 53 – 78 % lower standing herbivory and 49 – 87 % lower herbivory rates <b>than</b> <b>male</b> plants. Conclusions/Significance: Our results suggests that resource allocation to reproduction in the studied palms is more costl...|$|R
