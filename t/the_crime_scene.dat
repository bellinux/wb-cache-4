5|$|Remains {{that were}} {{recovered}} from the Pentagon were photographed, and {{turned over to the}} Armed Forces Medical Examiner office, located at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware. The medical examiner's office was able to identify remains belonging to 179 of the victims. Investigators eventually identified 184 of the 189 people who died in the attack. The remains of the five hijackers were identified through a process of elimination, and were turned over as evidence to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). On September 21, the ACFD relinquished control of <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scene</b> to the FBI. The Washington Field Office, National Capital Response Squad (NCRS), and the Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF) led <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scene</b> investigation at the Pentagon.|$|E

5|$|Within {{days of the}} murder, D.C. police {{alleged that}} <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scene</b> had been {{tampered}} with, but no charges were filed for over two years. In late 2008, police charged Price, Zaborsky and Ward with obstruction of justice and conspiracy related to alleged tampering with <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scene.</b> The men were acquitted of the charges in June 2010.

In November 2008, Wone's widow filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Price, Zaborsky and Ward; the suit was settled on August 3, 2011 for an undisclosed sum and agreement.|$|E

5|$|Dexter {{is called}} to a crime scene at the {{abandoned}} hospital where, last night, the Ice Truck Killer left security guard Tony Tucci (Brad William Henke) strapped to a table for Dexter to kill. Instead, Dexter had reported <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scene</b> and Tucci had been hospitalized after the Killer had amputated his hand and leg. Debra and Sgt. James Doakes (Erik King) question Tucci when he wakes up in hospital, but Doakes is unimpressed with Debra's ways of extracting information from Tucci. He disapproves of her suggestion to blindfold Tucci to help him to remember his encounter with the Killer, but after she confronts him about his attitude toward her, he agrees to blindfold Tucci, who remembers that the Killer used throat lozenges. They return to <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scene</b> and find a lozenge wrapper, on which forensics expert Vince Masuka (C.S. Lee) finds a partial fingerprint.|$|E

5|$|Bamber protested {{his innocence}} throughout, {{although}} his extended family remained convinced of his guilt. Between 2004 and 2012, his lawyers submitted several unsuccessful applications to the Criminal Cases Review Commission. They {{argued that the}} silencer {{might not have been}} used during the killings, that <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scene</b> may have been damaged then reconstructed, that crime-scene photographs were taken weeks after the murders, and that the time of Sheila's death had been miscalculated.|$|E

Later, Lamana steals Mulder's profile of the supposed killer and presents it under his name; an outraged Mulder confronts him afterwards.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, {{the killer}} is hunting {{for his next}} victim. While unknown to him, the murderer is trapped {{in a world of}} {{grotesque}} hallucinations.

5|$|Investigation {{into the}} assault began even before Udin's death. The police began their {{investigation}} on 13 August, but were hampered as <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scene</b> had been contaminated during the commotion after the assault. Under {{the command of}} Sergeant Major Edy Wuryanto, the police began by collecting Udin's notes and blood from his family; the family had received several bags of blood from Bethesda and were planning to bury it with the body.|$|E
5|$|Magazine editor Daphne Zimmer (Mam Smith), who edits for the Society Fair magazine, {{is found}} dead in her {{swimming}} pool. Daphne {{is a friend of}} Megan's (Dana Delany) mother, Joan Hunt (Joanna Cassidy). At <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scene,</b> Megan finds evidence to suggest that there was a struggle near the pool, as well as bruising on the Daphne's stomach, which indicates that she died several days ago instead of that morning as was originally believed. At Daphne's workplace, Megan, Detective Bud Morris (John Carroll Lynch), and Peter Dunlop (Nicholas Bishop) tell the employees of Daphne's death. Bud questions Daphne’s employees, Stephen Burnett (Neal Bledsoe) and Lauren Matthews (Nadia Dajani), finding out that one of Daphne's enemies is Colin Lloyd (Robert Walsh), a wealthy man whose career Daphne ruined. Megan examines Daphne’s body, noticing that Daphne has kidney damage. Whilst Dr. Curtis Brumfield (Windell Middlebrooks) is working on maggots found on Daphne’s body, Dr. Ethan Gross (Geoffrey Arend) determines that hair, which was found at <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scene,</b> is human, and there are traces of arsenic and lead.|$|E
5|$|Melvin's {{first problem}} {{was that there was}} no {{forensic}} evidence. Senior officers had not allowed the estate to be sealed off immediately after the attack, which meant that <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scene</b> had not been secured. Witnesses and those directly involved were able to leave without giving their names. Objects that might have held fingerprints were not collected. Police were not allowed into the estate in great numbers until 4am, by which time much of the evidence had disappeared. Whatever remained was removed during Haringey Council's clean-up operation.|$|E

5|$|Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) {{arrives at}} <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scene</b> and meets NOPD detective Franklin Potter, who has called her {{in out of}} his belief that the murders are related to satanism. Reyes merely answers the detective {{that it was not}} devil worship, and that the killer {{probably}} was under stress. As she is leaving, she witnesses one of the bodies carbonize into a charred corpse in front of her, only to have it revert to normal.|$|E
5|$|The {{result of}} this {{certainty}} was that the investigation was poorly conducted. <b>The</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scene</b> was not secured and searched thoroughly, and evidence was not recorded or preserved. Within a couple of days, the police had burned the bloodstained bedding and carpets, apparently to spare Bamber's feelings. The scenes-of-crime officer moved the murder weapon without wearing gloves, {{and it was not}} examined for fingerprints until weeks later. Three days after the killings, Bamber and the extended family were given back the keys to the house.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In this episode, Mulder investigates a small town plagued by deaths in which the bodies are found covered in cockroaches. Working from home, Scully has {{scientific}} explanations for all of them, but Mulder—at <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scene</b> with an attractive bug expert—suspects the insects may not be organic, or earthly.|$|E

5|$|A service ramp at {{the rear}} of the {{basement}} led to a sliding door that opened into an alley; the police found the door had been tampered with so it could be opened without unlocking it.

Some evidence at <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scene</b> was improperly handled by the police investigators: a trail in the dirt (from the elevator shaft) along which police believed Phagan had been dragged was trampled; the footprints were never identified.|$|E
5|$|About 10 {{years after}} the death of her father, Shi Jianqiao tracked down Sun Chuanfang in Tianjin. Shortly after 3pm on November 13, 1935, she {{approached}} him from behind while he was leading a sutra-recitation session at his lay-Buddhist society on Nanma Road. She then killed the kneeling former warlord by shooting him three times with her Browning pistol. After the assassination, she stayed at <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scene</b> to explain her deed and distribute mimeographed pamphlets to bystanders. Her case drew a significant amount of public and media attention.|$|E
5|$|Cascioferro is {{considered}} to be the mastermind behind the murder of New York policeman and head of the Italian Squad, Joseph Petrosino, on March 12, 1909. He was shot and killed in Piazza Marina in Palermo; two men were seen running from <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scene.</b> Petrosino had gone to Sicily to gather information from local police files to help deport Italian gangsters from New York as illegal immigrants. The two men were very much aware of the danger to each other's survival; Petrosino carried a note describing Cascioferro as “a terrible criminal”, while Cascioferro had a photograph of the police officer.|$|E

40|$|AbstractFingerprints are {{the most}} affirmative source of {{personnel}} identification and are {{also one of the}} most ubiquitous evidences found at <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scenes.</b> However, successful latent print recovery is not always possible from <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scenes</b> especially when <b>the</b> prints have been exposed to destructive conditions. <b>Crime</b> <b>scenes</b> are often despoiled due to destructive conditions such as arson, explosion, exposure to drainage water and soil or snow burial. Moreover, the offender often intends to destroy the fingerprint bearing crucial evidence, using these destructive forces. Furthermore, the fingerprints exposed to despoiled <b>crime</b> <b>scenes</b> are generally neglected due to the misconception of impossible recovery. In the present study, zinc carbonate, zinc oxide and titanium dioxide based fluorescent small particle reagents were formulated, compared and evaluated for the development of latent prints exposed to destructive conditions. Fresh latent prints and prints exposed to natural or simulated destructive <b>crime</b> <b>scene</b> conditions, namely, arson, explosion, burial in soil, immersion in drainage water and burial in snow were developed using the three compositions. Latent prints were successfully recovered even from <b>the</b> destructive <b>crime</b> <b>scene</b> simulations. Better quality prints were obtained from fresh prints, arson, soil burial and drainage water. Relatively poor results were obtained from explosion and snow burial conditions.
