5|$|Ravel {{declined}} {{not only}} the Légion d'honneur, but all state honours from France, refusing <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>his</b> name go forward for election to the Institut de France. He accepted foreign awards, including honorary membership of the Royal Philharmonic Society in 1921, the Belgian Ordre de Léopold in 1926, and an honorary doctorate from the University of Oxford in 1928.|$|E
5|$|After the Battle of Wisconsin Heights, a {{messenger}} from Black Hawk had shouted to the militiamen that the starving British Band {{was going back}} across the Mississippi and would fight no more. No one in the American camp understood the message, however, since their Ho-Chunk guides were not present to interpret. Black Hawk may have believed that the Americans had gotten the message, {{and that they had}} not pursued him after the Battle of Wisconsin Heights. He apparently expected that the Americans were going <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>his</b> band recross the Mississippi unmolested.|$|E
5|$|Alfred Baker {{lost much}} of his savings in the Panic of 1907 and could only afford to send {{one of his sons}} to college. Thornton agreed <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>his</b> talented younger brother {{continue}} his education, a sacrifice that Hobey Baker never forgot. Although an above-average student, Baker stayed an extra year at St. Paul's in 1909 to allow his father another year to save money. By the time Baker left St. Paul's, his sporting achievements had helped make him one of the school's most popular students.|$|E

He also {{was one of the}} first to raise his arm on an icing call <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>his</b> defencemen know what was happening. He perfected a stand-up, {{positional}} style, cutting down the angles; he became one of the first goaltenders to write a how-to book about the position. He was a pioneer of stickhandling the puck; before that time, goaltenders passively stood in the net and simply deflected pucks to defencemen or backchecking forwards.|$|E
5|$|Brian, {{the family}} dog, asks Kevin {{to explain why}} he deserted the army, with Kevin telling him that he had grown tired of the war, and had befriended many of the Iraqis, leading him to want to try to escape. Kevin and the family then begin {{fighting}} over the United States's occupation of Iraq, with Brian sympathizing with him, and several others, including Quagmire's Dad, a war veteran, disagreeing with Kevin's choice to desert the army. Joe then begins to take his son to jail. Kevin reminds his father of a time when he let a homeless man get away with stealing a can of tomato soup to feed his hungry family, for whom he had felt sorry. Emotional and sympathetic, Joe agrees <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>his</b> son off the hook, and the two make amends.|$|E
5|$|In 1826, Wilberforce {{moved from}} his large house in Kensington Gore to Highwood Hill, {{a more modest}} {{property}} in the countryside of Mill Hill, north of London, where he was soon joined by his son William and family. William had attempted a series of educational and career paths, and a venture into farming in 1830 led to huge losses, which his father repaid in full, despite offers from others to assist. This left Wilberforce with little income, and he was obliged <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>his</b> home and {{spend the rest of}} his life visiting family members and friends. He continued his support for the anti-slavery cause, including attending and chairing meetings of the Anti-Slavery Society.|$|E

5|$|Louis {{marched to}} Naples in February. The {{citizens}} {{offered him a}} ceremonious entry, but he refused, threatening <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>his</b> soldiers sack the town {{if they did not}} raise the taxes. He adopted the traditional titles of the kings of Naples"King of Sicily and Jerusalem, Duke of Apulia and Prince of Capua"and administered the kingdom from the Castel Nuovo, garrisoning his mercenaries in the most important forts. He used unusually brutal methods of investigation to capture all accomplices in the death of his brother, according to Domenico da Gravina. Most local noble families (including the Balzos and the Sanseverinos) refused to cooperate with him. The pope refused to confirm Louis's rule in Naples, which would have united two powerful kingdoms under Louis's rule. The pope and the cardinals declared Queen Joanna innocent of her husband's murder at a formal meeting of the College of Cardinals.|$|E
5|$|On 12 June 1917, the {{day after}} his accession, Alexander {{revealed}} his liaison with Aspasia Manos to his father and asked for his permission to marry her. Constantine was reluctant <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>his</b> son marry a non-royal, and demanded that Alexander wait {{until the end of the}} war before considering the engagement, to which Alexander agreed. In the intervening months, Alexander increasingly resented his separation from his family. His regular letters to his parents were intercepted by the government and confiscated. Alexander's only source of comfort was Aspasia, and he took the decision to marry her despite his father's request.|$|E
5|$|Megan Hunt (Dana Delany) and Peter Dunlop (Nicholas Bishop) {{arrive at}} the scene of Ed Russell (David Shumbris), a stay at home father, who is found by his wife Jen (Molly Price) stabbed to death at their house, whilst their baby {{daughter}} Sophie is at home. When Detective Bud Morris (John Carroll Lynch) goes to tell Ed's son Mike (Jake O'Connor) about his father’s death, Megan stops him, telling Bud <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>his</b> mother tell him. Megan has a flashback to when she was younger, focussing on when a young Megan (Madeline Milne) receives the news of her father’s death from a policeman, as the police did not know where her mother, Joan (Joanna Cassidy), was at the time. Jen admits that she cleaned up some footprints; she thought they were Mike's. The attack on Ed was personal and after Detective Samantha Baker (Sonja Sohn) concludes that the attack on Ed was personal after she finds evidence to suggest Mike did indeed kill his father, such as negative emails. Mike protests his innocence, and Ethan Gross (Geoffrey Arend) finds evidence which makes Mike innocent. Throughout the day, Megan tries to rebuild her relationship with Lacey (Mary Mouser), carpooling Lacey and her friends, Sarah (Teresa Celentano) and Betsy (Anna Friedman).|$|E

5|$|Another virtual safety car period ensued on lap 34, {{caused by}} Verstappen who crashed his {{car into the}} barrier after locking up his tyres. As the VSC ended on lap 37, Ricciardo once more failed {{in an attempt to}} regain the lead. At the chicane coming out of the tunnel, Hamilton misjudged the corner and backed Ricciardo off at the exit of the chicane, causing the latter to {{complain}} about the move on team radio. While the incident was investigated by the stewards, the decision was not to take action against Hamilton. At that point, the order stood as follows: Hamilton, Ricciardo, Pérez, Vettel, Alonso, Rosberg, Hülkenberg, Sainz, Button and Gutiérrez. The top four drivers pulled away cleanly {{from the rest of the}} field behind them. On lap 50, the two Sauber cars collided at Rascasse corner, after Felipe Nasr had ignored instructions from the pit lane <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>his</b> teammate Ericsson behind him pass. Another VSC period was called while both Sauber drivers made pit stops to repair damages, only for both to retire some laps later. In front, the race carried on in the same order. On lap 68, the fourth virtual safety car period occurred when a large plastic sheet fell onto the start–finish straight. Hamilton was able to extend his lead over Ricciardo at that point, setting the fastest lap of the race on lap 71. Three laps from the finish, rain started to fall again, although no driver changed tyres before the chequered flag fell. Hamilton crossed the finish line to take victory ahead of Ricciardo and Pérez. This win for Hamilton marked his second at Monaco, the other being in 2008. These two races featured many similarities, such as the Hamilton starting third on the grid, the race starting in wet conditions and finishing in the dry, as well as Hamilton taking the lead on lap 33. Vettel hung on to fourth, followed by Alonso in fifth. Rosberg however lost his sixth place to Nico Hülkenberg on the very last lap.|$|E

Rüedi had chosen the town {{at the foot of the}} Rocky Mountains for her approximately same altitude (1,609 m / 5,279ft) as Davos. There could be no talk, however, of similar climatic conditions, Rüedi confessed later.|$|E

25|$|In general, the stirrup {{is placed}} on the ball of the foot, {{allowing}} the rider <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>his</b> weight flow down the back of the leg into the heel by way of the flexible ankle. This provides the rider {{with the support of the}} stirrup while still allowing for him to easily absorb the shock of the horse's motion. If the stirrup is too far forward, on the toes, the rider risks losing if he pushes with too much pressure (forcing it off the foot) or too little (allowing it to simply slide off).|$|E
25|$|Although the University had {{previously}} refused <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>his</b> father enroll him at age 9 {{because he was}} still a child, Sidis set a record in 1909 by becoming the youngest person to enroll at Harvard University. In early 1910, Sidis' mastery of higher mathematics was such that he lectured the Harvard Mathematical Club on four-dimensional bodies. Sidis began taking a full-time course load in 1910 and earned his Bachelor of Arts degree, cum laude, on June 18, 1914, at age 16. Another child prodigy, cybernetics pioneer Norbert Wiener, also attended Harvard at the time and knew Sidis.|$|E
25|$|The {{marriage}} of Bhim Chand's son was arranged with {{the daughter of}} Fateh Shah. Bhim Chand had to go from Bilaspur to Srinagar (the capital of Garhwal) for the marriage ceremony, and the shortest route passed through Paonta. However, the Guru had no faith in Bhim Chand, and he refused <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>his</b> heavily armed party pass through Paonta. After negotiations, the Guru permitted only the bridegroom and {{a small number of}} his companions to cross the ferry near Paonta. The rest of the marriage party, including Bhim Chand, had to follow a circuitous route to Srinagar. This increased Bhim Chand's hostility towards the Guru.|$|E
