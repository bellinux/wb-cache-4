5|$|The {{same basic}} {{procedure}} {{was used by}} all of the above-mentioned psychologists. A participant makes a judgment about some particular issue. At a later time, they judge <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>problem</b> again but with information of how certain groups or prestigious people have evaluated <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>problem.</b> If the subject changes his judgment {{in the same direction as}} the evaluations of these groups of people or prestigious people, then this is considered a degree of influence that they have exerted on the participant's judgment.|$|E
5|$|Last year I decided I'm {{not doing}} music until I'm excited again, then this {{came along and}} also I did end up making another record which I'll release at some point. It's just being mastered, it's a lovely album; I didn't write this one, this is old songs and I have to sort out my situation- I don't want <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>problem</b> as before.|$|E
5|$|Density {{criteria}} {{range from}} above 3.5g/cm3 to above 7g/cm3. Atomic weight definitions {{can range from}} greater than sodium (atomic weight 22.98); greater than 40 (excluding s- and f-block metals, hence starting with scandium); or more than 200, i.e. from mercury onwards. Atomic numbers of heavy metals are generally given as greater than 20 (calcium); sometimes this is capped at 92 (uranium). Definitions based on atomic number have been criticised for including metals with low densities. For example, rubidium in group (column) 1 of the periodic table has an atomic number of 37 but a density of only 1.532g/cm3, which is below the threshold figure used by other authors. <b>The</b> <b>same</b> <b>problem</b> may occur with atomic weight based definitions.|$|E

5|$|During {{the second}} lap {{a number of}} drivers were forced to retire with broken wheels. Both Darracq drivers, A. Rawlinson and Algernon Lee Guinness, {{suffered}} from the issue; Rawlinson broke his in Ramsey, while Lee Guinness hit a well at Hilberry. A. J. Dew also broke a wheel, but continued the race in W. H. Warren's car; both being entered by J. W. H. Dew. A fourth driver, {{in one of the}} White steam cars, succumbed to <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>problem,</b> while A. J. Hancock crashed his Vauxhall into a tree, also breaking a wheel. Napier was once again the quickest driver around the circuit, followed by Percy Northey in a Rolls Royce, and Norman Littlejohn in the Vinot-Deguingand.|$|E
5|$|Following the 2006 ACC Championship Game, the Gator Bowl Association, which {{administered}} the ACC Championship Game {{during its first}} two years of existence, was awarded a one-year extension to its two-year contract to host the game. The 2006 game suffered from poor attendance, resulting in over $1million in losses for the Gator Bowl Association. In the off-season, the Gator Bowl Association declared that if sales did not improve for the 2007 ACC Championship game, the game's Jacksonville future would be in jeopardy. Attendance for the 2006 game was low due to high travel costs stemming from Jacksonville's distance from the participating schools, and the 2007 participants—Boston College and Virginia Tech—faced <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>problem.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1911, when Bauer {{again was}} asked to {{illustrate}} the book, {{he made it clear}} to the publisher that he wanted to retain his pictures along with the copyrights after publication. The publishing house had kept the original illustrations for the previous editions and considered them their property. Bauer was backed up in his request by other artists facing <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>problem.</b> The publishers did not budge from their position and without Bauer's illustrations, book sales dropped.|$|E

5|$|Kubica {{dropped to}} 13th as his {{traction}} control fault worsened, and a train of cars {{that wanted to}} pass developed behind him. Kovalainen's performance was much better than at the previous round in Melbourne, and he attempted to pass Jarno Trulli for eighth. The top five again remained the same after {{the second round of}} stops. However, Hamilton's short first stop necessitated a relatively early second stop, allowing Räikkönen to reduce the gap and Alonso to extend his lead to 18 seconds. Nico Rosberg, running in sixth place after the stops, was forced to retire with hydraulic problems on lap 43. David Coulthard also retired after problems with his brake pedal, <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>problem</b> that he experienced in the Friday practice session.|$|E
5|$|On {{her return}} from Haiti, Brown moved to Alabama in 1937 {{and worked at}} the Tuskegee Institute as a history teacher until 1940. In 1940, she joined LeMoyne-Owen College as a history teacher after a move from Alabama to Memphis, Tennessee. She {{continued}} teaching at LeMoyne-Owen College until 1945. Brown faced <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>problem</b> as most black educators during that era, in that they were offered appointments to teaching positions in higher education only in historically African American universities and colleges. She returned briefly in 1945 to Ohio State University to take additional classes in Eastern history and geography.|$|E
5|$|Securely {{attached}} {{children are}} {{best able to}} explore when they have the knowledge of a secure base (their caregiver) to return to in times of need. When assistance is given, this bolsters the sense of security and also, assuming the parent's assistance is helpful, educates the child in {{how to cope with}} <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>problem</b> in the future. Therefore, secure attachment {{can be seen as the}} most adaptive attachment style. According to some psychological researchers, a child becomes securely attached when the parent is available and able to meet the needs of the child in a responsive and appropriate manner. At infancy and early childhood, if parents are caring and attentive towards their children, those children will be more prone to secure attachment.|$|E

5|$|The Romanian premiere {{took place}} on June 4, 2006 at the Transylvania International Film Festival, in Cluj-Napoca. In Bucharest, a first display of the movie was {{organized}} on September 8, 2006, in a square established for this purpose on Calea Rahovei Street. The public, {{as well as the}} critics from the country, received the movie very well, but the difficulty caused by the movie's unusual duration only allowed for the movie to be on display on a few other occasions. <b>The</b> <b>same</b> <b>problem</b> was encountered when the movie was sent to film festivals outside Romania, being either rejected due to the impossibly of being included in any of the standard categories or included as a short fiction (for example, at Brooklyn).|$|E
5|$|The closure problem {{takes as}} input a {{directed}} acyclic graph with weights on its vertices and seeks the minimum (or maximum) weight of a closure, a set of vertices with no outgoing edges. (The problem may be formulated for directed graphs without the assumption of acyclicity, but with no greater generality, because {{in this case it}} is equivalent to <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>problem</b> on the condensation of the graph.) It may be solved in polynomial time using a reduction to the maximum flow problem.|$|E
5|$|The {{distinguishing}} feature of Zobel network filters {{is that they}} have a constant resistance image impedance and for this reason are also known as constant resistance networks. Clearly, the Zobel network filter does not have a problem matching to its terminations and this is its main advantage. However, other filter types have steeper transfer functions and sharper cut-offs. In filtering applications, the main role of Zobel networks is as equalisation filters. Zobel networks are in a different group from other image filters. The constant resistance means that when used in combination with other image filter sections <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>problem</b> of matching arises as with end terminations. Zobel networks also suffer the disadvantage of using far more components than other equivalent image sections.|$|E

5|$|The problem {{occurred}} {{because of the}} way the vehicles were modified for right-hand-drive. The investigation showed that although the brake pedal had been moved to the right, it was still connected to a mechanism on the passenger side. This was covered by felt carpet and meant that both the front passenger and driver could activate the brakes. A further investigation by Watchdog later found <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>problem</b> in other Citroën models and some vehicles produced by Renault and Peugeot, some of which were registered in 2002. All three manufacturers worked with the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA) to identify the severity of the problem but no vehicles were found to be affected enough to issue recalls.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} {{boats were}} filled {{much closer to}} capacity and in an increasing rush. No.11 was filled with five people more than its rated capacity. As it was lowered, it was nearly flooded by water being pumped out of the ship. No.13 narrowly avoided <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>problem</b> but those aboard were unable to release the ropes from which the boat had been lowered. It drifted astern, directly under No.15 as it was being lowered. The ropes were cut in time and both boats made it away safely.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} other formats used for bouldering {{competitions}}. Some competitions only permit climbers a fixed number of attempts at each {{problem with a}} timed rest period in between each attempt, unlike the IFSC format, in which competitors can use their allotted time however they choose. In an open-format competition, all climbers compete simultaneously, and are given a fixed {{amount of time to}} complete as many problems as possible. More points are awarded for more difficult problems, while points are deducted for multiple attempts on <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>problem.</b>|$|E

5|$|A {{product of}} Manchester United's youth academy, Campbell progressed to their first-team in the 2006–07 season. He made four {{appearances}} without scoring in his {{tenure at the}} club. He had a loan spell at Belgian club Royal Antwerp, where he scored 24 goals in 38 appearances. He also had loan periods with Hull City and Tottenham Hotspur, where he scored 15 goals in 37 matches and three goals in 22 appearances respectively. He signed for Sunderland {{at the beginning of}} the 2009–10 season for £3.5million. His involvement at Sunderland was limited due to an anterior cruciate ligament injury he sustained in his second season at the club, as well as a recurrence of <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>problem</b> later in the season. He moved to Cardiff in January 2013 on a three-and-a-half-year deal, and then Crystal Palace 18 months later.|$|E
5|$|Although Bonaparte had not {{expected}} British interference in his operations against Egypt, the Royal Navy had responded to the reports of French mobilisation on the south coast by despatching a small squadron to the Ligurian Sea under Rear-Admiral Sir Horatio Nelson. Arriving on 21 May, Nelson's squadron {{was struck by a}} severe storm and was forced to make hasty repairs off Sardinia. The storm had also dispersed the squadron's frigates, leaving Nelson with only three ships of the line. Although he was reinforced by another ten ships of the line and a fourth rate on 7 June, he still lacked any scouts and was thus severely hampered in his ability to search for information on French operations. The detached frigates had been scattered across the Western Mediterranean, and were unable to locate either the British or the French fleets. Reinforcements sent by Vice-Admiral Earl St Vincent at the Tagus River suffered from <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>problem,</b> the frigates spreading out widely in their search but failing to discover either of the main British or French forces, which were rapidly sailing southeastwards towards Alexandria.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the most}} {{satisfying}} moments in the Go series, the IGN and TouchArcade reviewers appreciated the game mechanic of determining how best to use a hack or drone to slip past enemies. The IGN reviewer found the game's puzzles somewhat harder than those of its predecessors, but was able to easily resolve them upon after taking brief breaks. The game's minimalism also led to some complications. Some of the solutions, he complained, were dependent on unintuitive player experimentation, such as realizing that the invisibility device {{also served as a}} projectile. Some of these visual cues were lost amidst the game's visual presentation. TouchArcade wondered whether the simplified environment was an aesthetic choice or the result of efforts to save on development costs. The GameSpot reviewer was disappointed to see an option for paid puzzle solutions in an otherwise short game about discovering the secret to a puzzle on one's own. Compared to the main series, in which the player may stake out a building at a distance, the experimentation in Deus Ex Go is limited to finding the right answer rather than finding multiple routes to solve <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>problem.</b>|$|E
