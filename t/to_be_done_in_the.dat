5|$|By {{the early}} modern era Gaelic had been in {{geographical}} decline for three centuries and had begun to be a second class language, confined to the Highlands and Islands. The tradition of classic Gaelic poetry survived longer in Scotland than in Ireland, with the last fully competent member of the MacMhuirich dynasty, who were hereditary poets to the Lords of the Isles and then the Donalds of Clanranald, still working in the early eighteenth century. Nevertheless, interest in the sponsorship of panegyric Gaelic poetry was declining among the clan leaders. Gaelic was gradually being overtaken by Middle Scots, which became the language of both the nobility and the majority population. Middle Scots was derived substantially from Old English, with Gaelic and French influences. It was usually called Inglyshe and {{was very close to}} the language spoken in northern England, but by the sixteenth century it had established orthographic and literary norms largely independent of those developing in England. From the mid sixteenth century, written Scots was increasingly influenced by the developing Standard English of Southern England due to developments in royal and political interactions with England. With the increasing influence and availability of books printed in England, most writing in Scotland came <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> English fashion.|$|E

25|$|While {{traditionally}} Spanish vineyards would harvest their grapes by hand, {{the modernization}} of the Spanish wine industry has seen increased use of mechanical harvesting. In years past, most harvesting had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early morning with wineries often refusing grapes after mid-day due to their prolonged exposure to the blistering heat. In recent years, aided {{in part by the}} wider spread of the use of mechanical harvesting, more harvests are now being done at the lower temperatures at night.|$|E

25|$|From the mid sixteenth century, written Scots was {{increasingly}} {{influenced by the}} developing Standard English of Southern England due to developments in royal and political interactions with England.

25|$|Former Labour first {{minister}} Henry McLeish published {{a report in}} May 2014 that found no obvious barriers to an independent Scotland competing in the 2016 Summer Olympics. McLeish said that some athletes, particularly those in team sports, may choose {{to compete for the}} existing Great Britain team rather than Scotland, as they would be nationals of both states. International Olympic Committee representative Craig Reedie pointed out that Scotland would need to obtain United Nations membership and may want to set its own Olympic qualifying standards, which would need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> period between independence (March 2016) and the closing date for entries (July 2016).|$|E
25|$|However, {{one other}} team {{could also be}} relegated. Nottinghamshire needed just 3 points to avoid the drop {{at the start of}} the matches, but only managed 1 point as they were soundly beaten by Sussex. This meant that Durham needed only to score 400 (for maximum batting points) and force a draw. At 191–6 this looked unlikely. But a record-breaking stand of 315 between Benkenstein and Ottis Gibson made it possible. Gibson was out for 155, the highest {{first-class}} score in his career. Durham then collapsed again to 518 all out, needing work <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second innings. This was provided by Garry Park, who hit a maiden first-class century (100*) as Durham played out a draw, leaving themselves and Yorkshire in the first division.|$|E

25|$|It is {{primarily}} {{the likelihood of}} a severe earthquake on the Hayward or San Andreas faults that has spurred a substantial effort to retrofit and sometimes replace large structures at risk, particularly the eastern and western spans of the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge, the San Francisco and Oakland city halls, and numerous elevated rail, road, and pedestrian structures and overpasses. Much work remains <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region and progress is being hampered by budget constraints imposed by trickle down federal-state-regional deficits, design and construction delays due to state and local political bickering over design, and unexpectedly high steel and cement costs due to the extensive construction work being done in China. Nonetheless, Bay area cities and counties have long expected a major earthquake and as a result all building in the past 30 years has been required to adhere to strict guidelines regarding earthquake resistance. Of all the earthquake prone regions of the world, the San Francisco Bay Area is among the most prepared structurally for the eventuality of a major quake while remaining grossly unprepared in both civil response planning and in the retrofitting of older buildings.|$|E

Here, the company had built a trading post by 1898 named Egnell after its operator Albert Egnell. After spending one winter at the post, Egnell {{found that there was}} no trade <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area and the post was subsequently abandoned. Egnell died on June 22, 1900 from an accidental gun shot to his leg by his son, McDonald, five days earlier and was buried at the Liard Post near the mouth of the Dease River. In the early 1900s, the Egnell Post served as a repair station for the [...] long Yukon Telegraph Line, which extended from Ashcroft, British Columbia to Dawson City, Yukon. A small settlement consisting of a mission house {{and a number of other}} buildings had been established on the site by 1944. This settlement, named Sheslay, has since been abandoned.|$|E
