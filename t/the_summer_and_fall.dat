Böhme rigorously enforced the rule that for every German killed, 100 Serbs or Jews would be shot. The resistance movement in Belgrade was led by Major Žarko Todorović from 1941 until his arrest in 1943.|$|E
5|$|The 1957 Pacific {{hurricane}} season was a moderately active {{year in which}} 13 tropical cyclones formed. The {{hurricane season}} ran through <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> <b>and</b> <b>fall</b> months which conventionally delimit the period during which most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. The first tropical cyclone developed on July 15. The final storm dissipated on December 6, {{becoming one of the}} few Pacific storms to exist outside of the seasonal dates. Of the season's 13 storms, five of these formed or crossed into the central Pacific.|$|E
5|$|This was in {{contrast}} to the Bolsheviks, who proclaimed the partitions of Poland null and void. Piłsudski thus speculated that Poland would be better off with the Bolsheviks, alienated from the Western powers, than with a restored Russian Empire. By ignoring the strong pressures from the Entente Cordiale to join the attack on Vladimir Lenin's struggling Soviet government, Piłsudski probably saved the Bolshevik government in <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> <b>and</b> <b>fall</b> of 1919.|$|E

5|$|Following {{his return}} to California, Col. Alexander was {{appointed}} president of a board appointed by the U.S. Congress to study the potential of irrigating the San Joaquin Valley, Tulare Valley, and Sacramento Valley. The board, which {{became known as the}} Alexander Commission, conducted a survey of the California Central Valley throughout <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> <b>and</b> <b>fall</b> of 1873. The Commission's report declared that large-scale irrigation was possible and that much land could be reclaimed from the swamps around the Sacramento River. The report was not initially acted upon, but was the first professional survey of the valley and set the stage for further development.|$|E
5|$|The 1910 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season was the period during <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> <b>and</b> <b>fall</b> of 1910 in which tropical cyclones {{formed in the}} North Atlantic Ocean. The season was fairly inactive, with only five storms; however, three grew into hurricanes and one became a major hurricane. The season {{got off to a}} late start with the formation of a tropical storm in the Caribbean Sea on August 23. September saw two storms, and the final tropical cyclone—Hurricane Five—existed during October. All but one of the storms made landfall, and the only cyclone which remained at sea had some effects on the island of Bermuda.|$|E
5|$|The 1911 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season was relatively inactive, with only six known tropical cyclones forming in the Atlantic during <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> <b>and</b> <b>fall.</b> There were three suspected tropical depressions, {{including one that}} began the season in February and one that ended the season when it dissipated in December. Three storms intensified into hurricanes, two of which attained Category 2 status on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. Storm data is largely based on the Atlantic hurricane database, which underwent a thorough revision for the period between 1911 and 1914 in 2005.|$|E

5|$|The cirque where Castle Lake {{is found}} {{is a classic}} Northern Hemisphere cirque. The cirque {{headwall}} (the highest part of the mountain where the glacier began to form) was in the south or southwest, and {{the part of the}} mountain that sloped downward to the northeast was away from the prevailing winds. The resulting shaded area was sheltered from direct sun, and from the evaporating effects of wind. These conditions encouraged snow which had fallen in the winter to remain throughout <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> <b>and</b> <b>fall,</b> creating a year-round snow pack which grew deeper each year.|$|E
5|$|The sporangia (the fern's spore-bearing structures) are borne on the {{underside}} of the leaf beneath the false indusium, a trait found in all members of Adiantum and not in any species outside it. The sori are round, and are found on veins ending in the false indusium, below the veins' ends. The spores are tetrahedral to globose, yellow in color, and measure 41 to 58micrometers(μm) in diameter (averaging 51.4μm), on average larger than other species in the A.pedatum complex. Spores appear in <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> <b>and</b> <b>fall.</b> The species has a chromosome number of 116 in the sporophyte.|$|E
5|$|Baorangia bicolor, {{also known}} as the two-colored bolete or red and yellow bolete after its {{two-tone}} coloring scheme of red and yellow, is an edible fungus in the genus Baorangia. It inhabits most of eastern North America, primarily east of the Rocky Mountains and in season during <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> <b>and</b> <b>fall</b> months but can be found across the globe in China and Nepal. Its fruit body, the mushroom, is classed as medium or large in size, which helps distinguish it from the many similar appearing species that have a smaller stature. A deep blue/indigo bruising of the pore surface and a less dramatic bruising coloration change in the stem {{over a period of several}} minutes are identifying characteristics that distinguish it from the similar poisonous species Boletus sensibilis. There are two variations of this species, variety borealis and variety subreticulatus, and several other similar species of fungi are not poisonous.|$|E

5|$|Both {{male and}} female mockingbirds sing, with the latter being {{generally}} quieter and less vocal. Male commencement of singing is in late January to February and continues into the summer and the establishing of territory into the fall. Frequency in female singing is more sporadic, as it sings less often in <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> <b>and</b> <b>fall,</b> and only sings when the male is away from the territory. The mockingbird also possesses a large song repertoire that ranges from 43 to 203 song types and the size varies by region. Repertoire sizes ranged from 14 to 150 types in Texas, and two studies of mockingbirds in Florida rounded estimates to 134 and 200, approximately. It continually expands its repertoire during its life, though it {{pales in comparison to}} mimids such as the brown thrasher.|$|E
5|$|Despite his age of 59 or 60 at the time, Brandon was {{permitted}} to serve with the Confederate States Army in 1861 as lieutenant colonel of the 21st Mississippi Infantry Regiment and went to Virginia. In July 1861, Brandon contracted a cold, prompting {{him to take a}} leave from active service until the end of August. His subordinates did not believe him fit for duty again and he did not receive an appointment to colonel. Brandon and his regiment were placed in the Confederate Army of the Potomac in Virginia. During <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> <b>and</b> <b>fall</b> of 1861, Brandon's unit was on duty in the northeastern part of the state. During the Yorktown siege, his regiment, along with other Confederate army units, were spread out across eastern Virginia between Culpeper, Fredricksburg, and Norfolk, forming the Warwick Line. Brandon's regiment would again see action in the Battle of Williamsburg, fought the day after the action at Yorktown.|$|E
5|$|Fin {{whales are}} {{regularly}} encountered on whale-watching excursions worldwide. In the Southern California Bight, fin whales are encountered year-round, {{with the best}} sightings between November and March. They can even be seen from land (for example, from Point Vicente, Palos Verdes, {{where they can be}} seen lunge feeding at the surface only a half mile to a few miles offshore). They are regularly sighted in <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> <b>and</b> <b>fall</b> in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, the Gulf of Maine, the Bay of Fundy, the Bay of Biscay, Strait of Gibraltar, the Mediterranean. In southern Ireland, they are seen inshore from June to February, with peak sightings in November and December. Cruise ships en route to and from the Antarctic Peninsula sometimes encounter fin whales in the Drake Passage.|$|E

5|$|Loke had her keel {{laid down}} in March 1867 and was {{launched}} on 4 September 1869. She was commissioned on 22 October 1871 {{at the cost of}} 1,200,428 Swedish krona. The delay in construction may have been due to manufacturing difficulties by the British supplier of her armor plate. Generally the monitors were kept in reserve for most of the year; only being commissioned for two to four months during <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> <b>and</b> <b>fall.</b> Loke made only seven cruises, the last in late 1880, and was not commissioned afterwards. Funds were requested to rebuild her in 1903 and 1908, but they were refused. She was decommissioned on 21 August 1908 and advertised for sale. The details of her fate are unknown, but presumably she was sold and scrapped.|$|E
5|$|Ann Rule began {{corresponding}} with Green in 1996, {{and interviewed}} her in person in 1997. Rule recalls {{in her book}} on the case that Green's letters denied any unhappy childhood memories. Green claimed that though her behavior in <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> <b>and</b> <b>fall</b> of 1995 had been neglectful, she had neither the desire nor the wherewithal to set fire to her house or harm her children or her husband. Rule—who was neither a doctor nor a psychologist, but had a background in criminology and law enforcement—believed that even Green does not understand what caused her to attempt to murder Michael Farrar beyond {{the fact that she}} had come to hate him. Rule's theory was that in destroying Farrar, Green would have been able to preserve her own ego, in that Farrar would not have been able to leave her for another woman. Psychiatrist Michael H. Stone, using Rule's book as a source of information about Green, identifies Green as showing characteristics of psychopathy, borderline personality disorder, and narcissistic personality disorder.|$|E
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> <b>and</b> <b>fall</b> of 2011, several renovations took place, {{affecting}} {{primarily the}} high school. All front-facing {{windows of the}} high school were replaced with energy-efficient windows, and a permanent-storage building was constructed on the northeast side to store auditorium and maintenance supplies. In addition, many of the computers in the school were replaced with thin client computers. In 2013, the school's cardiovascular and weight lifting center was improved with more machines and equipment, increased space, new flat screen televisions, and other additions. In 2013 and 2014, the school's fields on the property were remediated due to the use of contaminated fill. The football field was completed with artificial turf, as well as the track and artificial turf baseball field; an artificial turf hockey field was to be completed by Labor Day. The lower soccer field will be reconstructed after the fall 2014 soccer season. Work on the softball field was finished in fall 2013. A security plan is to be submitted to the New York State Education Department; it includes plans to upgrade the main entrance doors and construct vestibules and greeter stations.|$|E
