40|$|INTRODUCTION: In this study, {{arrangement}} of a low-cost optical <b>tomography</b> <b>device</b> {{compared to other}} methods such as frequency domain diffuse tomography or time domain diffuse tomography is reported. This low-cost diffuse optical imaging technique {{is based on the}} detection of light after propagation in tissue. These detected signals are applied to predict the location of in-homogeneities inside phantoms. The device is assessed for phantoms representing homogenous healthy breast tissues as well as those representing healthy breast tissues with a lesion inside. METHODS: A diode laser at 780 nm and 50 mW is used as the light source. The scattered light is then collected from the outer surface of the phantom by a detector. Both laser and detector are fiber coupled. The detector fiber may turn around the phantom to collect light scattered at different angles. Phantoms made of intralipid as the scattering medium and ink as the absorbing medium are used as samples. Light is collected after propagation in the phantoms and the capability of the device in collecting data and detecting lesions inside the phantoms is assessed. The fact that the detection fiber orbits around the sample and detects light from various angles has eliminated the need to use several detectors and optical fibers. The results obtained from experiments are compared with the results obtained from a finite element method (FEM) solution of diffusion equation in cylindrical geometry written in FORTRAN. RESULTS: The graphs obtained experimentally and numerically are in good accordance with each other. The device has been able to detect lesions up to 13 mm inside the biological phantom. CONCLUSION: The data achieved by the optical <b>tomography</b> <b>device</b> is compared with the data achieved via a FEM code written in FORTRAN. The results indicate that the presented device is capable of providing the correct pattern of diffusely backscattered and transmitted light. The data achieved from the device is in excellent correlation with the numerical solution of the diffusion equation. Therefore, results indicate the applicability of the reported device.

40|$|Following a {{diagnosis}} of breast cancer (BC), the early detection of local recurrence is important to define appropriate therapeutic strategies and increase {{the chances of a}} cure. In fact, despite major progress in surgical treatment, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy protocols, tumor recurrence is still a major problem. Moreover, the diagnosis of recurrence with conventional imaging methods can be difficult {{as a result of the}} presence of scar tissue. Molecular breast imaging (MBI) with gamma-ray emitting radiotracers may be very useful in this clinical setting, because it is not affected by the post-therapy morphologic changes. This review summarises the applications of 99 mTc-sestamibi and 99 mTc-tetrofosmin, the two most employed gamma emitter radiopharmaceuticals for MBI, in the diagnosis of local disease recurrence in patients with BC. The main limitation of MBI using conventional gamma-cameras is the low sensitivity for small BCs. The recent development of hybrid single photon emission computed tomography/computed <b>tomography</b> <b>devices</b> and especially of high-resolution specific breast cameras can improve the detection rate of sub-centimetric malignant lesions. Nevertheless, probably only the large availability of dedicated cameras will allow the clinical acceptance of MBI as useful complementary diagnostic technique in BC recurrence.

In the presence of all the pairwise ToFs, one can estimate the sensor positions using multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) method. In practice, however, we are facing two major sources of loss. One {{is due to the}} transitional behaviour of the sensors and the beam form of the transducers, which makes the ToF measurements for close-by sensors unavailable.
