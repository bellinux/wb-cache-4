5|$|Milhouse's mother, Luann Van Houten, {{makes her}} first {{appearance}} in this episode. She was designed <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>very</b> similar to Milhouse. Maggie Roswell was assigned to voice the character and she originally based it on Milhouse, who is voiced by Pamela Hayden. The producers felt that her impression sounded out of place so she ended up using a more normal sounding voice. It was Gewirtz who in this episode gave Milhouse his last name, Van Houten, which he got {{from one of his}} wife's friends.|$|E
5|$|On December 9, 1993, a United States Senate {{committee}} held {{a hearing}} on the subject of video game violence. The hearing was led by senators Joe Lieberman and Herb Kohl and was covered in major newspapers including USA Today, The Washington Post and The New York Times. Throughout the hearing, the committee scrutinized Night Trap along with Midway's Mortal Kombat (1992). Lieberman, who admitted never playing the game, claimed Night Trap featured gratuitous violence and promoted sexual aggression against women. One game over scene considered particularly offensive involved the nightgown-clad character Lisa being captured by Augers attempting to drain her blood. Tom Zito attempted to explain the context of the nightgown scene in defense of the game, but he claims he was silenced. In the short documentary Dangerous Games (included with PC versions), the producers and some members of the cast explain that the plot of the game was to in fact prevent the trapping and killing of women. In addition, the blood draining device was intended <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>very</b> unrealistic to mitigate the violence. Despite scenes in which the girls are grabbed or pulled by enemies, no nudity or extreme acts of violence were ever filmed or incorporated into the game.|$|E
25|$|The game's {{environment}} {{takes up}} 60–65% of the CPU bandwidth, {{primarily because of}} the moving camera, but also because eight different characters can appear on screen at any one time – a large number for the technology of the time. Because of this, a powerful CPU was required to run the game, since the engine relied on the processor doing all the work in creating the 3D models. However, despite this limitation, the game runs at a minimum of 15 FPS, even on slow systems. The downside to this was that, since processor power at that time was limited, the in-game 3D models tended <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>very</b> pixelated, especially up-close and when motionless, due to the low amount of voxels used to display them. However, had the number of voxels been raised to increase the detail on the characters, the game would have become too slow to play, even on advanced CPUs.|$|E
50|$|The top of {{the stem}} holds a {{composite}} flower head, each consisting of many individual disc florets but no ray florets. The flowers of this plant are usually purple though sometimes pink or white. Hill's thistle tends <b>to</b> <b>looks</b> <b>very</b> similar <b>to</b> Cirsium vulgare during its seedling and rosette stages; one can easily be mistaken for the other.|$|R

25|$|Mandy and Adam {{were later}} shown the entire suicide note. Mandy reports that Adam {{immediately}} voiced {{that he did}} not see anything on the letter than indicated it was written by Daniel, and the note appeared to be 'cold' and 'matter-of-fact'. The note also stated 'don't blame the guy I was with last night'. When Mandy and Adam asked the Police if they had looked into who the note was referring to, the Police said they didn't know, may never know, and that they weren't ever going to find out all the answers. Mandy reported that in hindsight, she doesn't feel Dagenham Police were investigating properly, and they wouldn't have had <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>very</b> far to find out Port was behind it, and save another family from emotional turmoil. When Mandy wished to challenge the open verdict or continue investigation, she reported that she was told that nothing more could be done, and she felt there was an attitude of 'it is what it is, deal with it'.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{praised the}} game's {{graphical}} quality. Gerstmann said {{the use of}} lighting added a unique style to the game. He also liked the depiction {{of the two major}} areas of the game, and the game's sounds, which he said suited the tone of the game. Alexandra Hall from GamesRadar said [...] "Starbreeze really coaxed some beautiful sights out of aging hardware". She added that some players may not be pleased with the game's bloom effects. David Houghton of the same publication said the game is [...] "a decent shooter" [...] but that its lightbloom effects were [...] "nonsensically over-the-top". Peter Eykemans from IGN echoed similar thoughts, declaring that the motion bloom and blinding light a problem. However, he admitted that the game [...] "constantly looks great", and that its simple design has made the game <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>very</b> polished.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2009, it was {{reported}} that the D/L method would be reviewed for the Twenty20 format after its appropriateness was questioned in the quickest version of the game. Lewis was quoted admitting that [...] "Certainly, people have suggested that we need <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>very</b> carefully and see whether in fact the numbers in our formula are totally appropriate for the Twenty20 game." ...|$|E

2500|$|The ideal {{standard}} of beauty {{for women in}} the Elizabethan era was to have light or naturally red hair, a pale complexion, and red cheeks and lips. Pale, white skin was desired because Queen Elizabeth was in reign and she had the naturally red hair, pale complexion, and red cheeks and lips. Also, it was <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>very</b> English since the main enemy of England was Spain. The Spanish had dark hair and tanned skin.|$|E
2500|$|Katherine Helmond as Mrs. Ida Lowry. According to Helmond, Gilliam {{called her}} and said, [...] "I have a part for you, and I {{want you to}} come over and do it, but you're not going <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>very</b> nice in it." [...] The make-up was applied by Gilliam's wife, Maggie. During production, Helmond spent ten hours a day with a mask glued to her face; her scenes had to be {{postponed}} due to the blisters this caused.|$|E
2500|$|The current {{majority}} {{view of the}} Supreme Court supports substantive due process rights {{in a number of}} areas. An alternative to strict originalist theory is advocated by Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, one of the Court's supporters of substantive due process rights. Breyer believes the justices need to look at cases in light of how their decisions will promote what he calls [...] "active liberty," [...] the Constitution's aim of promoting participation by citizens in the processes of government. That is an approach that ostensibly emphasizes [...] "the document's underlying values" [...] and a broad look at a law's purpose and consequences. Critics charge that such an approach would also give judges the ability <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>very</b> broadly at the consequences and unwritten purpose of constitutional provisions, such as the Due Process Clause, thus removing issues from the democratic process.|$|E

2500|$|On 26 January 2001, John Redwood MP accused Prime Minister Tony Blair [...] of prejudicing the {{independent}} {{inquiry into the}} Hinduja passport affair, after Blair declared that the Foreign Office minister Keith Vaz had not done [...] "anything wrong". [...] On the same day, Vaz told reporters that they would [...] "regret" [...] their behaviour once {{the facts of the}} case were revealed. [...] "Some of you are going <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>very</b> foolish when this report comes out. Some of the stuff you said about Peter, and about others and me, you'll regret very much when the facts come out", he said. When asked why the passport application of one of the Hinduja brothers had been processed more quickly than normal, being processed and sanctioned in six months when the process can take up to two years, he replied, [...] "It is not unusual." ...|$|E
2500|$|From a {{standpoint}} of environmental scepticism, Booker seeks to combine {{an analysis of}} the science of global warming with the consequences of political decisions to reduce [...] emissions and claims that, as governments prepare to make radical changes in energy policies, the scientific evidence for global warming is becoming increasingly challenged. He asserts that global warming is not supported by a significant number of climate scientists, and criticises how the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) presents evidence and data, in particular citing its reliance on potentially inaccurate global climate models to make temperature projections. Booker concludes, [...] "it begins <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>very</b> possible that the nightmare vision of our planet being doomed" [...] may be imaginary, and that, if so, [...] "it {{will turn out to be}} one of the most expensive, destructive, and foolish mistakes the human race has ever made".|$|E
2500|$|Because {{the actress}} playing Ian's mother Kathy (Gillian Taylforth) was fair-haired, they also {{wanted him to}} be fair, and because of Taylforth's age he also had <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>very</b> young. Ian was meant to be 14 years old when the {{programme}} first aired, but because of licensing regulations, the actor cast was required to be a 16-year-old who could [...] "play down". Adam Woodyatt, born in East London, had worked as an actor in his youth, but had given it up and relocated with his family to Wales. He was recruited from his old agency and it was decided that he was perfect for the part and he was subsequently cast as Ian Beale. In 1990 Ian's age was increased and he celebrated his twenty-first birthday two years after his eighteenth. The producers felt Ian needed to be a bit older and more mature for storylines planned for him later that year.|$|E

2500|$|The most {{graphically}} demanding Nintendo 64 {{games that}} arrived on larger 32 or 64MB cartridges {{are the most}} advanced and detailed of the 32-bit/64-bit generation. [...] In order to maximize use of the Nintendo 64 hardware developers had {{to create their own}} custom microcode. [...] Nintendo 64 games running on custom microcode benefited from much higher polygon counts in tandem with more advanced lighting, animation, physics and AI routines than its 32-bit competition. Conker's Bad Fur Day is arguably the pinnacle of its generation combining multicolored real-time lighting that illuminates each area to real-time shadowing and detailed texturing replete with a full in game facial animation system. [...] The Nintendo 64's graphics chip is capable of executing many more advanced and complex rendering techniques than its competitors. [...] It is the first home console to feature trilinear filtering, which allowed textures <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>very</b> smooth. This contrasted with the Saturn and PlayStation, which used nearest-neighbor interpolation and produced more pixelated textures. [...] Overall however the results of the Nintendo cartridge system were mixed and this was tied primarily to its storage medium.|$|E
2500|$|Officially, the [...] "American Buffalo" [...] is {{classified}} by the United States Government {{as a type}} of cattle, and the government allows private herds to be managed as such. [...] This {{is a reflection of the}} characteristics that bison share with cattle. [...] Though the American bison (Bison bison) is not only a separate species, but actually in a separate genus from domestic cattle (Bos primigenius), it clearly has a lot of genetic compatibility with the latter, and American bison can interbreed freely with cattle. [...] Moreover, when they do interbreed, the crossbreeds tend <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>very</b> much like purebred bison, so appearance is completely unreliable as a means of determining what is a purebred bison and what is crossbred with cattle. [...] Many ranchers have deliberately crossbred their cattle with bison, and it would also be expected that there could be some natural hybridization in areas where cattle and bison occur in the same range. [...] Since cattle and bison eat similar food and tolerate similar conditions, they have often been in the same range together in the past, and opportunity for cross breeding may sometimes have been common.|$|E
2500|$|Juri's {{shirt was}} modeled after a spider, {{and left the}} sides of her breasts exposed at Ono's suggestion. Her pants were {{designed}} to give a [...] "silhouette that looks like a taekwondo uniform." [...] The black trim on her pants was added to set her apart from other Street Fighter characters who wear similar uniforms. Her colour scheme was originally plain. However, when lined up with other characters, she didn't stand out; as a result, they employed hot pink, a colour not used in any other female character in the game. They added black details to her outfit to make it less [...] "frivolous." [...] A pink crystal, known as the Feng Shui Engine, was added as a replacement inside her left eye after deciding to align her with Seth, in order to more closely tie her character to the organization. The crystal was originally in her stomach, similar to Seth. Other ideas were considered, including having it in one of her palms, one of her legs, or one of her ankles. They eventually settled on putting it in her eye, with design director Kamei commenting that a [...] "big globe in the stomach of a female character wasn't going <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>very</b> attractive." [...] He also commented that an eye is a logical place to have an artificial replacement, as well as already being spherical. Initially, Juri was designed to be chubbier and cuter. Gradually the design was made slimmer, though the team noted at some point they had realized they had overdone it and reversed the changes slightly. She was given full legs, and a slender upper body in order to show the contrast. Kamei wanted to make her even more slender, but decided that if she was too small, her kicks would lack impact. Several designs were considered for her face, going through about seven versions before settling on her current appearance, though time constraints played a part in the decision.|$|E
