50|$|Also {{important}} in <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> trade reforms. The trade reforms pushed by <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> <b>were</b> those that improved export growth and foreign trade through the abolishing of export taxes, the gradual liberalization of imports, and {{the imposition of}} an anti-export bias ideal. The reforms also involved the reduction in trade barriers, more specifically by removing restrictions on imports and reforming the import-licensing system. Tariff rates were also eventually reduced to encourage more foreign trade. <b>The</b> <b>administration</b> <b>was</b> also {{a big part in}} the realization of the ASEAN Free Trade Area which also served as encouragement for foreign trade.|$|R

Due to the lack of clear laws and strong institutions, management and administration is carried out by sectors and also falls on the water users. The institutional framework has at times been characterized as fragmented and dispersed, with poorly defined roles and functions, and with overlapping responsibilities.|$|E
25|$|In my judgment, U.S. {{involvement}} in Zaire defies justification. It {{is true that}} the U.S. has not utilized the full measure of resources available for Zaire, nor responded to Mobutu's requests for arms and ammunition. This restraint by <b>the</b> <b>Administration</b> <b>is</b> commendable, but if Mobutu qualifies for neither arms nor ammunition, then he should not qualify for any form of military assistance, lest the United States be drawn into the hapless conflict in Zaire, inch by inch.|$|E

25|$|Like adult facilities, youth {{detention}} centers {{in some countries}} are experiencing overcrowding due to large increases in incarceration rates of young offenders. Crowding can create extremely dangerous environments in juvenile {{detention centers}} and juvenile correctional facilities. Overcrowding may also lead to the decrease in availability to provide the youth with much needed and promised programs and services while {{they are in the}} facility. Many times <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> <b>is</b> not prepared to handle the large number of residents and therefore the facilities can become unstable and create instability in simple logistics.|$|E
25|$|The {{emphasis}} on the net scrip of co-op members, which equal the amount injected into the co-op by <b>the</b> <b>administration,</b> <b>is</b> the distinguishing feature of the Chartalist view. From this perspective, the function of introducing lending, as Krugman suggests, is that interest on this lending creates or destroys net member savings. For example, if the administration lends ten hours worth of scrip at 10% interest for one year (thus collecting eleven hours worth of scrip in one year's time), then it has created ten hours worth of scrip but will withdraw eleven hours in the future, thus reducing net private sector assets by one hour.|$|E

2500|$|From the Chartalist perspective, the {{key point}} is the co-op board's deficits give co-op members {{additional}} scrip.

[...] In other words, [...] Thus, as the administration's savings become negative [...] goes up. Initially when the administration spent twenty hours worth of scrip and taxed twenty, there was no administrative debt (i.e. [...] ), which implies [...] The deficit spending created government debt of ten hours per family. Since every piece of scrip spent by <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> <b>is</b> given to the members, the result is that couples were given an additional ten hours of scrip (i.e. =10×(number of members)), which may fulfill the private sector's desired savings quota.|$|E

He furthermore warned that [...] "the transfer of Cuba to Great Britain would be an event unpropitious to the interest of this Union". Adams voiced concern that a country outside of North America would attempt to occupy Cuba upon its separation from Spain. He wrote, [...] "The question both of our right and our power to prevent it, if necessary, by force, already obtrudes itself upon our councils, and <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> <b>is</b> called upon, in the performance of its duties to the nation, at least to use all the means with the competency to guard against and forfend it".|$|E
