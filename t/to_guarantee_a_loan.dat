50|$|Compensation for the Fenian raids was not included, and American {{fishermen}} {{were given}} rights to fish in Canadian waters.

When it came time to debate the treaty in the Canadian House of Commons, he revealed that he had been secretly negotiating for a better deal, and had obtained a cash payment from the Americans for the use of Canadian fishing grounds, and in lieu of any claim against the United States over the Fenians. Furthermore, the British had agreed <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>guaranteed</b> <b>loan</b> of £4,000,000 for the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway.

40|$|Guaranty arrangements, {{in which}} one person stands as surety for a second person 2 ̆ 7 s {{obligation}} to a third, are ubiquitous in commercial transactions and in commercial law. In recent years, however, scholarly attention to the topic has been scant; {{and no one has}} systematically analyzed this body of law and practice from an economic policy perspective. Accordingly, this Article attempts to outline the basic economic logic underlying the guaranty relationship, and applies the results to a variety of specific issues in government policy and private planning. It poses and answers three main questions: First, why would a creditor prefer <b>to</b> make <b>a</b> <b>guaranteed</b> <b>loan</b> rather than <b>an</b> unguaranteed one? The answer is not as obvious as might first appear, given that market competition over credit terms tends to adjust the interest rate paid by an individual borrower to reflect the specific default risk that he presents. Second, given that they bear the residual risk of debtor default, why would guarantors prefer <b>to</b> <b>guarantee</b> loans rather than make loans directly, thus forgoing the opportunity to earn interest payments that could help to compensate for the risk they bear? Third, even if it is efficient for one creditor to provide funds and another to provide insurance against default, why would the parties prefer to implement this arrangement through the triangular form of a guaranty, instead of simply having the former creditor lend to the latter and the latter lend to the ultimate borrower...|$|R
50|$|In social policy, {{a number}} of {{progressive}} reforms were realised during Spaak's first premiership. An Act of June 1938 “increased {{the functions of the}} National Society for Cheap Houses and Dwellings and empowered it, under State <b>guarantee,</b> <b>to</b> contract <b>a</b> <b>loan</b> of 350 million francs,” while a Royal Decree of July 1938 laid down the rules of applying the provisions of a Holidays with Pay Act passed in 1936 to agricultural, horticultural and forestry undertakings. An Act of the 20th of August 1938 amended and supplemented a Holidays with Pay Act previously passed in 1936 by extending its coverage to all undertakings, whatever their number of wage earners, as well as to home workers. The Act also removed a previous requirement in which a wage earner had to work {{for at least a year}} with the same employer in order to earn an annual holiday. An Act of the 8th of July 1938 amended the miners' old-age, invalidity and survivors' insurance scheme by increasing the benefits payable to invalids, aged persons and widows already in receipt of a pension, while also significantly widening the conditions for the grant of invalidity pensions. An Order of the 25th of August 1938 prohibited the use of so-called motor spirit “for greasing, cleaning (hands) etc.,” while a Royal Order of the 27th of August 1938 fixed normal weekly hours of actual work in the ship-repairing industry in Antwerp at 42 hours “distributed over the seven days of the week.” A Royal Order of the 27th of December 1938 extended the scope of an eight-hour Act passed in June 1921 to cover technical staff employed in cinemas, and a Royal Order of the 22nd of December 1938 amended the entries in the second column of the schedule (list of occupations) which was now brought into conformity with Convention No.42, and added “in the case of pneumoconiosis, sand-blasting processes in iron and steel foundries.|$|R

40|$|Clubbing {{together}} Cue: The {{difficulty for}} women to obtain credit has been widely recognised; for example, they are frequently not eligible for credit because assets such as their home and land are regarded as the property of their husband, and cannot be used <b>to</b> <b>guarantee</b> <b>a</b> <b>loan.</b> So what can women in this situation do? In an area known as Ballastone Park, 45 km west of Lusaka, Zambia, women have found that grouping together in a club has provided an answer. Being in a group enabled the women to obtain {{a grant from the}} UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, and that grant, together with some training, has allowed them to develop a successful agricultural business. Chris Kakunta went to meet three members of the Limbikani women?s club, and began by asking Mary Makani, the Chairperson, to explain the background to their business venture. IN:		?We were women in a club ? OUT:		? and after our grandchildren. ? DUR?N		 4 ? 15 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Mary Makani, Christine Mwale and Catherine Amulomba of the Limbikani Women?s Club were talking to Chris Kakunta. Transcript Makani	We were women in a club, who were always meeting together {{trying to find a way}} into which we can help ourselves as retired women and widows. Kakunta	So Telefood programme under FAO came in, Mrs Mwale, what exactly did they do? Mwale	We were given this grant by FAO and that was to purchase the pigs for the women in this club. Kakunta	This is the first time Mrs Amulomba, you are keeping pigs as a club. How easy is it for women like you to keep pigs? Amulomba	It is easy for us because we have undergone a training which was done by the Ministry of Agriculture. We were trained here at this farm. All the women came here for training. We were empowered with the knowledge and the skills and we did it practically on my first pigs which we got. And then secondly when we got the pigs for the women we now went ahead because the Ministry of Agriculture people were able to come here to visit us and to assist us, even the veterinary people used to come to assist us and to help us. Kakunta	How many of you are there in the club Mrs Makani? Makani	We are about 14 women. Kakunta	How are you exactly benefiting from this project? Makani	We have benefited a lot because each member has got a pig from the main pen. Each time there are pigs in here we give one to another women, we pass one to another women. Kakunta	Tell me how exactly this works? Makani	Well, when we wean the pigs and we fatten them for two months, after that we number the pigs inside the pen and we give them numbers, they pick a number which we put in the basket. Then after that we open up our papers which we have picked and each one will see the number which is matching with a pig inside. Then you pick the pig and take it home. Kakunta	Wonderful. Now if my pig is male what happens, it means it will never produce? How do you exactly share if a pig is male? Makani	We are only sharing the females at the moment. Kakunta	Mrs Mwale what do you do to the male ones? Mwale	With the male ones we fatten them and we sell. So the money is put back into the club for food and for other maintenance in the project. Kakunta	Is this a sustainable way of sharing some of these proceeds from a project like this one Mrs Amulomba? Amulomba	Yes it is because each women at the end of the project, each women will have two female pigs and then the rest of the pigs will be sold and the money will be put back into the bank account for the club. And then later on we can decide whether to empower ourselves by getting loans and we pay interest and we then go onto another project which will not be funded, which will now be from the proceeds of the pigs. Kakunta	So as members of Limbikani Women?s Club do you think this project actually has helped in terms of uplifting living standards? Amulomba	Yes it has because it has brought us all together and we are even sharing ideas apart from the piggery, we are even sharing ideas on how to grow crops and what types of crops we should grow in a certain season. And it also cements our relationship, whoever has got a problem will be visiting each other. So this project has brought us together. Kakunta	As we come to the end of the interview Mrs Makani, what important lessons would you like to share with our listeners about this project? Makani	Well I would love to say this to the listeners. Coming together is one thing that is needed in a society because you learn a lot from one another just as we have done here at Limbikani?s Women?s Club. We have learnt a lot from one another, a way of living, even a way of relating to one another. Most of the people here they are widows and retired women and when you are retired you have no money, you have no future. But with this project we have seen ourselves together encouraging one another and by the end of the day we will no longer be the same retired people, we will be people who will be able to look after ourselves and after our grandchildren. End of track. Three members of the Limbikani Women?s Club, near Lusaka, Zambia, explain how they have benefited from a grant and training to build a successful pig breeding business...|$|E

In 1602 or early in 1603 Brend's daughter-in-law, Margaret, then newly widowed, attempted to collect the debt from the Lord Admiral personally at Oatlands Palace. He offered a settlement of £100, which was apparently not accepted, as Margaret's second husband, Sir Sigismund Zinzan, sued Drake's heir in 1606 for the full £400.|$|R
