500|$|Scott Porter, {{playing the}} role of quarterback Jason Street, knew that his {{character}} would be paralyzed from the first episode on, and said that this {{was a big part of}} the reason why he took the role. Porter played high school football as a wide receiver. He also played on a highly successful team in high school, and described himself as huge fan of the Friday Night Lights movie. Meanwhile, Taylor Kitsch, the show's Tim Riggins, said in an interview that he was able to relate to his character based on his own personal experiences: [...] "my father is out of my life, more or less", he revealed in an interview, [...] "So I discover stuff <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> wasn't even dealing with as a person." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Gypsy" [...] {{was directed by}} Jaume de Laiguana, who had previously worked with Shakira on the videos for songs such as [...] "No". The video stars Spanish professional tennis player Rafael Nadal, who portrays Shakira's love interest in the video. When asked about the reason for starring Nadal in the video, Shakira said she [...] "thought <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> needed someone I could in some way identify with. And Rafael Nadal {{is a person who}} has been totally committed to his career since he was very young, since he was 17, I believe." [...] The music videos for [...] "Gypsy" [...] and the Spanish-language version [...] "Gitana" [...] were released on 27 February 2010. The video begins with Shakira playing the harmonica, dressed in a black halter top and a long black skirt. The next scenes mainly consist of Shakira interacting with Nadal in different ways, such as dancing for him and laying together on the ground. The video ends with the duo sharing a kiss.|$|E
500|$|As {{the sets}} were {{being built in}} Las Vegas, {{producer}} Frank Mancuso, Jr., son of Paramount president Frank Mancuso, Sr., had the screenplay rewritten in secret, and gave Bakshi a new screenplay by screenwriters Michael Grais and Mark Victor that [...] "was barely the same". Larry Gross {{also contributed to the}} script, but his work would later go on to be uncredited. In interviews {{at the time of the}} film's release, Mancuso, Jr., who was best known for the Friday the 13th franchise, stated a desire to move away from horror films, and wanted to produce a film [...] "about what happens when someone creates a world, becomes defined by it, and then can't escape [...] a film about being trapped by your own creation." [...] Bakshi remembers that he got into a fight with Mancuso, Jr. and [...] "punched [...] in the mouth." [...] Paramount threatened Bakshi with a lawsuit if he refused to complete the film. [...] "I thought if I did the animation well, it would be worth it, but you know what? It wasn't worth it." [...] Bakshi also stated that he [...] "had a lot of animators there that I'd brought in and I thought <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> could just have fun animating this stuff, which I did." [...] Bakshi had developed the film as a mix of comedy and horror that he described as [...] "a hard R-rated story" [...] but Paramount wanted a PG-13 film, one of the reasons for the doomed and angry relationship between filmmaker and studio.|$|E

2500|$|Shanahan {{became a}} free agent {{following}} the 2005–06 season and subsequently signed a one-year, $4 million deal with the New York Rangers. After completing a successful nine-year stay in Detroit, he {{expressed a desire to}} move on in his NHL career, stating, [...] "It really came down to an instinct I had. Detroit has a great past and a great future ahead of them as well, but I guess I just felt <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> was identified with the past {{a little bit more than}} the future." ...|$|E
2500|$|In February 2010, Rafael Nadal was {{featured}} in the music video of Shakira's [...] "Gypsy". and part of her album release She Wolf. In explaining why she chose Nadal for the video, Shakira {{was quoted as saying}} {{in an interview with the}} Latin American Herald Tribune: [...] "I thought <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> needed someone I could in some way identify with.

2500|$|The band went by {{the name}} [...] "Feedback" [...] for a few months, before {{changing}} to [...] "The Hype" [...] later on. After Dik Evans left the group to join another local band, the Virgin Prunes, the remaining four officially changed the name from [...] "The Hype" [...] to [...] "U2". Initially Bono sang, played guitar and wrote the band's songs. He said of his early guitar playing in a 1982 interview, [...] "When we started out I was the guitar player, along with the Edge—except I couldn't play guitar. I still can't. I was such a lousy guitar player that one day they broke it to me <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> should sing instead. I had tried before, but I had no voice at all. I remember the day I found I could sing. I said, 'Oh, that's how you do it.'" [...] When The Edge's guitar playing improved, Bono was relegated mostly to the microphone, although he occasionally still plays rhythm guitar and harmonica. As of 2006, Bono has taken piano lessons from his children's piano teacher {{as a means to}} improve his songwriting.|$|E
50|$|Mama hated my husband—she's {{a jealous}} lover, you know. She's hated {{all the men}} I've ever been {{involved}} with.

Our marriage lasted 5 years; it was just another one of my mistakes.|$|R
2500|$|Manson has {{commented on}} the subject of children, saying that she [...] "just missed the whole baby calling. I feel a lot of women think you're a freak if you feel like <b>that,</b> and <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> am strange but I never got that feeling. In some ways I wish I had that urge, because I adore children... I feel I can live quite happily with my decision." ...|$|R

2500|$|As {{his policy}} for eradicating {{corruption}} inside {{the government had}} included many administrative reforms, he had to face high opposition. During the reformation of the prosecution, to resolve the opposition, he suggested a TV forum. The prosecutors insisted that Roh appointed the major positions of the prosecutor's office without consulting the personnel committee, and Roh answered that [...] "The current members of the personnel committee themselves represent the old prosecution which has to be changed, {{if we do not}} change now, it would sustain the old prosecution at least few months." [...] Three months into his presidency, He commented about the opposition problem, stating [...] "I'm worrying the opposition <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> cannot continue the presidency while I get that much of it." [...] That comment was quoted partly by conservative media, ('I cannot continue the presidency') and Roh was beset by skepticism about his ability and experience. Roh set the tone of his administration with a number of adventurous policies, and measures to uncover and reveal the names of the descendants of Japanese collaborators. The investigations, criticized by opposition parties as a covert means of attacking them, and coming too late to provide substantive redress, mostly resulted in damage to his own party members.|$|E

6000|$|At {{that time}} Sir Launcelot {{was in a}} deep swoon like {{as though he were}} dead; yet he was not dead, for after the hermit had bathed his face with strong wine, and after he had set pungent herbs to his nostrils, by and by Sir Launcelot revived so as to sigh very deep and to open his eyes. And Sir Launcelot said, [...] "Where am I? Am I still alive?" [...] The hermit said, [...] "Yea, Messire." [...] Sir Launcelot said, [...] "I wist <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> was dead." ...|$|E

Somebody has to paint those paintings. All of a sudden it became accessible. The movie was so compelling and interesting to me on so many levels. The one thing that struck me was that somebody made a movie, and that it was something <b>that</b> <b>maybe,</b> possibly, <b>I</b> could do.|$|R
500|$|The {{head coach}} dealt with young players who {{differed}} from the white, East-Coast students {{with whom he had}} previously worked. At the beginning, he used the then-customary coaching methods of rough language and a strict routine. The Native American students were unaccustomed to such an approach, and several key players stopped attending practices. Warner adjusted his technique, saying that he [...] "found I could get better results. I don't think I ever swore at a player from <b>that</b> time. <b>Maybe</b> <b>I</b> did a little cussing, now and then, but never at players." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{starting}} point for Neubauten was more that we didn't have anything, so I didn't really have the choice to say 'I am doing this, I am doing <b>that,</b> or <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> should play organ'. I didn't have any of these things, and I could not afford any of these things, and neither could {{anybody else in the}} group. It was more of the logical consequence of what can we obtain, and that's how it turned out. It certainly didn't start out as an artistic concept to say [...] "let's do something different", it started {{as an extension of the}} live situation as it already was.|$|R
6000|$|Not a soul made a {{memorandum}} of these sayings of mine, for publication. I saw that, {{and did it}} myself, else {{they would have been}} utterly lost. So far from meeting with a generous encouragement like other children when developing intellectually, I was now furiously scowled upon by my father; my mother looked grieved and anxious, and even my aunt had about her an expression of seeming to think <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> had gone too far. I took a vicious bite out of an India-rubber ring, and covertly broke the rattle over the kitten's head, but said nothing. Presently my father said: ...|$|E

I will stand off and on in the garden, ma'am, and then you can read it comfortable like indoors, and hail me when you have got to the bottom of it.' It was not many minutes before one of your sisters called me in. They had all been crying, and I felt more uncomfortable than I did when those Spanish rascals gave us a broadside as I went in, for I was afraid she would so rake me with questions that she would get out of me that other sad business; and it could hardly be expected that even the stoutest ship should weather two such storms, one after the other.|$|E

5000|$|Dorsey's musical style spans broadly and {{includes}} rock, funk, country, and pop influences. She describes her current sound as a present-day {{version of the}} AM/FM radio tunes that left a mark on her music such as The Fifth Dimension, Olivia Newton-John, Bread and the Wilson sisters, and Heart. When asked to describe her sound in one word she says [...] "Black-arach...but <b>that's</b> <b>maybe</b> how <b>I</b> feel most days.

If the notion takes me, I just run over my little old ICH HABE GEHABT, DU HAST GEHABT, ER HAT GEHABT, WIR HABEN GEHABT, IHR HABEN GEHABT, SIE HABEN GEHABT--kind of 'Now-I-lay-me-down-to-sleep' fashion, you know, and after <b>that,</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>I</b> don't buckle to it for three days. It's awful undermining to the intellect, German is; {{you want to take}} it in small doses, or first you know your brains all run together, and you feel them sloshing around in your head same as so much drawn butter. But French is different; FRENCH ain't anything. I ain't any more afraid of French than a tramp's afraid of pie; I can rattle off my little J'AI, TU AS, IL A, and the rest of it, just as easy as a-b-c.

These, lads, are matters for my own conscience. Personally, I have long been impressed with the conviction that it were better that the circles of initiates should be very widely extended, and that all capable by education and intellect of appreciating the mightiness of the truth should no longer be left in darkness. I have been overruled, and should never have spoken had not this accident taken place; but when I see that the whole happiness of your life is at stake, that should the secret ever be discovered you will either be put to death despairing and hopeless, or have to fly and live despairing and hopeless in some foreign country, I have considered that the balance of duty lay on the side of lightening your mind by a revelation of what was within my own. And it is not, as I have told you, so much the outcome of the teaching I have received as of my own studies and a conviction I have arrived at as to the nature of God. Thus, then, my son, you can lay side the horror which you have felt at the thought that by the accidental slaying of a cat you offended the gods beyond forgiveness. The cat is but typical of the qualities attributed to Baste. Baste herself is but typical of one of the qualities of the One God." ...|$|E
