500|$|A <b>term</b> <b>paper</b> Ramsey {{wrote for}} Goldhaber on {{magnetic}} moments {{caused him to}} read recent papers on the subject by Isidor Isaac Rabi, and this stimulated an interest in molecular beams, and in doing research for a Ph.D. under Rabi at Columbia. Soon after Ramsey arrived at Columbia, Rabi invented molecular beam resonance spectroscopy, {{for which he was}} awarded the Nobel prize in physics in 1944. Ramsey was part of Rabi's team that also included Jerome Kellogg, Polykarp Kusch, Sidney Millman and Jerrold Zacharias. Ramsey [...] worked with them on the first experiments making use of the new technique, and shared with Rabi and Zacharias in the discovery that the deuteron was a magnetic quadrupole. This meant that the atomic nucleus was not spherical, as had been thought. He received his Ph.D. in physics from Columbia in 1940, and became a fellow at the Carnegie Institution in Washington, D.C., [...] where he [...] studied neutron-proton and proton-helium scattering.|$|E
500|$|In {{his review}} for MSN Music, Robert Christgau {{described}} Ocean's [...] "romantic laments" [...] as [...] "models of texture, respect, and profound loss, their beats subtle, seductive, weird, and seized like time whether he's deploying 'songs for women' that are soon trumped by Drake's, not feeling a porn-moonlighting dental student and her 'novacaine,' or annulling a courthouse wedding solemnized {{just before his}} bride turned in her <b>term</b> <b>paper</b> on hijab." [...] Pitchfork Media's Ryan Dombal commented that [...] "There are distinct elements of Drake's melancholic paranoia and The-Dream's high melodrama, too. But there's also a heady surreality surrounding Nostalgia, Ultra that makes it unique." [...] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times called it [...] "slick and intuitive ... full of astral soul that owes debts to Terence Trent D'Arby, Pharrell Williams, even Drake", adding that [...] " [...] sings casually but precisely, stretching out syllables as if he's forgetting to let them go." [...] NPR's Andrew Noz commented that [...] "It's his songwriting, smart and subtle, that sets Ocean far apart from that pack", adding that [...] "The finest moments of Nostalgia, Ultra orbit the same soul-baring and minutiae-obsessed space as Marvin Gaye's breakup opus Here, My Dear or any number of Prince's more idiosyncratic ballads". No Ripcord's Charlie Jebb wrote that [...] "Nostalgia, Ultra has more than enough good stuff to establish Ocean as an artist to watch," [...] calling it [...] " [...] R record with crossover potential without sacrificing soul that creates a complete picture of its author, warts and all." ...|$|E

[...] Before the event, Lavalle's surveys had claimed that soccer was less popular than sports like college wrestling, log rolling, skeet shooting and dog racing, and that the World Cup organizers had botched the event. [...] Afterwards, the New York and LA Times quoted Lavalle as saying [...] "for World Cup soccer worldwide, the World Cup gets a grade A; for staging of the World Cup in America, it gets a grade A. But {{for the future of}} soccer in America, the grade is incomplete. If you want a prediction, it seems like the <b>term</b> <b>paper</b> will be turned in and it will get a failing grade. To say that it will ever be on par with hockey or golf or even wrestling is way off the mark."

2500|$|Former {{guidance}} counselor {{for students at}} Andover and college admissions authority, Donald Dunbar, suggested that essays must emphasize personal character and demonstrate intellectual curiosity, maturity, social conscience, concern for the community, tolerance, and inclusiveness. He advises don't just [...] "be yourself", but show your [...] "best self", and that demonstrating class participation suggests a [...] "willingness to go beyond selfishness" [...] and shows enthusiasm for learning. Alan Gelb suggests that the only no-no is [...] "shameless self-promotion". Topics to avoid include babysitting experiences, pets, encounters with illegal drugs or alcohol or criminal activity, excuses to explain a low grade, stories about a former home or big brother or sister, simply listing achievements, expressing thanks for being chosen as a leader, talking about a [...] "wilderness leadership course", general complaining or whining, racism or sexism or disrespect for groups of people, bad taste or profanity or vulgarity or bathroom humor, early love or sex experiences, criticism or disrespect for parents, telling only jokes, excessive bragging or too many instances of the [...] "I" [...] pronoun, divulging personal health information about yourself or a friend or a family member, copy-and-pasting a <b>term</b> <b>paper</b> in the essay form such as about global warming or the European debt crisis, and experiences involving lawbreaking or illegal activity. Applicants should not express opinions too strongly as if no possible counterviews were possible. The topic should be something the applicant cares about, and should show leadership {{in the sense of}} [...] "asserting yourself to help others have more success." [...] According to Dunbar, leadership is not necessarily about being in charge such as being the team captain or school president. Applicants should present a broad perspective and avoid simplistic words such as never, always, only, or nobody, which suggest narrow thinking. Dunbar advised against the standard [...] "tell 'em what you've told 'em" [...] essay formula but doing something different, interesting, and exciting.|$|E

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the Amherst <b>term</b> <b>papers</b> and the early essays of Talcott Parsons, the essays he wrote before he {{published}} The Structure of Social Action. In these essays, Parsons attempts to define the theoretical interests of sociology in contrast to those of orthodox economics and positivism. It is argued in this article that the Amherst <b>term</b> <b>papers</b> are of little interest as they do not introduce original ideas, and all the relevant argumentation that is developed in these essays is unsophisticated and fragmentary. In contrast, the essays of the period from 1928 to 1937 present original epistemological analysis and theoretical cohesion. This article also compares the Amherst <b>term</b> <b>papers</b> with 5 of 21 early essays to discover theoretical and epistemological continuities. The comparison shows that there is minimum relevance of the Amherst <b>term</b> <b>papers</b> to the early essays and accentuates certain ideas that {{can be considered as}} common to the said essays...|$|R

5000|$|Using <b>term</b> <b>paper</b> mills {{brings up}} some ethical controversies. Some people view essay mills as {{unethical}} while others {{view it as}} completely moral. People view essay mills as ethical for different reasons. Some customers indicate that they use essay mills {{as a form of}} proof reading. Essay mill writers will read their writing only to make comments and feedback about content and grammar mistakes. They also turn to essay mills to insure that all citations are correct. [...] Some customers claim that they turn to essay mills because society has put too much pressure on students to achieve academic success. GPAs and grades are greatly stressed in schools which causes students to worry and make them feel like they cannot meet their deadlines. In order to get the paper handed in on time, students seek out <b>term</b> <b>paper</b> mills. Essay mills have been compared to business situations.

40|$|This column {{describes}} an introductory geology course assignment {{in which students}} work collaboratively in groups preparing for a poster session. After {{a discussion of the}} course instructor's rationale for assigning posters as opposed to traditional <b>term</b> <b>papers,</b> the authors describe the assignment and student reactions to it, and include a handout used to guide students through the assignment. Well known among librarians and professionals from various disciplines, poster sessions are probably not familiar to most undergraduates. But that may be changing: recent interest in using them in undergraduate courses (especially in the sciences) seems to be increasing. Several courses have used poster sessions profitably, either asalteniatives to <b>term</b> <b>papers</b> or, as in the case presented here, in addition to written work. The present example from Earlham College involves a geology course instructor whouses poster sessions in an especially productive manner that not only provides educational benefits, but also elicits enthusiastic participation and positive responses from students. Why Use Poster Sessions? Dr. Charles Martin, the course instructor, cites three primary factors which led to his decision to assign poster sessions instead of traditional <b>term</b> <b>papers.</b> Froma practical pointof view, poster sessions allow instructors to avoid reading/grading students' <b>term</b> <b>papers</b> in addition to any short papers assigned earlier in the course.

The {{total number of}} bibliographic citations continued to grow in 2000 from a median of 10 in 1996 to 13 in 2000.
