5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Dixie</b> Mission {{hosted the}} Patrick Hurley and George Marshall {{diplomatic}} missions {{to negotiate a}} unification of the Chinese Communists and Nationalists. Both diplomatic efforts failed. Later, the brief existence of <b>the</b> <b>Dixie</b> Mission served as a positive memory between the People's Republic of China and the United States during the administration of President Richard M. Nixon when official {{relations between the two}} countries were re-established. Veterans of <b>the</b> <b>Dixie</b> Mission, like John Service and Koji Ariyoshi, were among the first Americans invited to visit the People's Republic of China.|$|E

5000|$|Confederate patriotism {{refers to}} the patriotism of people towards the {{historic}} Confederate States of America located {{in what is now}} the southern United States. This patriotism arose {{as a result of the}} rise of an autonomous [...] "Dixie" [...] identity after the escalation of dispute between United States northerners and southerners over states' rights and slavery, <b>the</b> <b>Dixies</b> identified themselves as a separate group of people from the people associated with the Union whom <b>the</b> <b>Dixies</b> referred to as [...] "Yankees".|$|R

5|$|In 2013, {{the story}} of <b>the</b> <b>Dixie</b> Mission served as the {{historical}} basis for a new World War II novel called Two Sons of China, by Andrew Lam. It was released by Bondfire Books in December 2013.|$|E
5|$|Misperceptions of <b>the</b> <b>Dixie</b> Mission {{contributed to}} the {{nationwide}} Red Scare in the 1950s and 1960s. Thawing relations between the People's Republic of China and the United States in the 1970s opened a new chapter for the mission. For the first time, the mission and its participants {{became the subject of}} serious scholarship, and many of the mission participants were among the first Americans invited to visit China in twenty years. In China, <b>the</b> <b>Dixie</b> Mission is remembered as a positive time between the two nations, and a symbol of Sino-American cooperation.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Dixie</b> Highway was {{conceived}} in 1915 to connect Chicago to Miami and commemorate a half-century {{since the end}} of the Civil War. On the suggestion of Governor Woodbridge Ferris, representatives from Michigan convinced <b>the</b> <b>Dixie</b> Highway Association to include Michigan in the proposed auto trail. Two divisions through the Lower Peninsula were included, the eastern one included a route between Detroit and Toledo via Monroe. This section of <b>the</b> <b>Dixie</b> Highway in Monroe County was first added to the state highway system in 1926 when US25 was created. The highway was rerouted through downtown Monroe in the early 1930s; instead of turning westward in downtown to connect to Telegraph Road, the highway instead continued northward to the current Dixie Highway–Telegraph Road intersection. When the US25 designation was decommissioned in the state in 1973, the highway segment between the state line and the Monroe area was given the M-125 designation. The routing has remained unchanged since. In 1995, the section through downtown Monroe was named what is now a Pure Michigan Byway.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> 1948 <b>Dixie</b> Bowl was a post-season college {{football}} bowl {{game between the}} Arkansas Razorbacks and the William & Mary Indians. In <b>the</b> inaugural <b>Dixie</b> Bowl, Arkansas defeated William & Mary, who was ranked fourteenth by the AP Poll, 21-19. <b>The</b> final <b>Dixie</b> Bowl was played on 1949. William & Mary would get their revenge for the game the next year, a 9-0 win in Little Rock, and again in a 20-0 win in Little Rock.|$|R
50|$|In 1954 Joe {{and two of}} his friends, Sean Lucey and Theo Cahill {{formed a}} dance band which they called The Dixielanders. This was later to be {{shortened}} to <b>The</b> <b>Dixies</b> and in <b>the</b> 1960s became one of the best known showbands in Ireland.|$|R
5|$|From 1942–1945, Peng's {{role in the}} war {{was mostly}} political, and he {{supported}} Mao very closely. In June 1944 Peng {{was part of a}} team that held conferences with American military personnel that visited Yan'an as part of <b>the</b> <b>Dixie</b> Mission, briefing the Americans about the military situation in Japanese-occupied China.|$|E
5|$|He {{started in}} 19 races during the 1961 season {{and he had}} three wins to finish thirteenth in season points, winning his first NASCAR race in a Fox-prepared car at Concord Speedway. Later in the season, he won the Firecracker 250 at Daytona and <b>the</b> <b>Dixie</b> 400 at Atlanta.|$|E
5|$|He was {{subsequently}} named <b>the</b> <b>Dixie</b> Memorial Award winner as the club’s MVP {{and won the}} Derrick Thomas Community Award. His 341 pass attempts on the season were the highest seasonal total in Crimson Tide history while his 16 touchdown passes tied the single-season mark.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> 1934 <b>Dixie</b> Classic was a post-season college {{football}} bowl {{game between the}} Arkansas Razorbacks and the Centenary Gentlemen. Arkansas and Centenary tied the game, 7-7.

5|$|Later, {{during the}} auto trail era, the modern US23 also {{coincided with the}} east branch of <b>the</b> <b>Dixie</b> Highway {{and part of the}} Lower Peninsula section of the Theodore Roosevelt International Highway. <b>The</b> <b>Dixie</b> Highway was created by William S. Gilbreath after he {{developed}} the Lincoln Highway. The highway was designed to link the Great Lakes with the Gulf of Mexico, and to commemorate a half century of peace between the North and the South after the American Civil War. At the urging of Governor Woodbridge Ferris, the northern terminus was located at the Straits of Mackinac. The highway had two branches in the Lower Peninsula; the eastern branch followed what later became US23 north of Standish. The Theodore Roosevelt International Highway was named for former US president Theodore Roosevelt after his death in 1919. Overall, this highway ran from Portland, Oregon, to Portland, Maine, by way of Michigan and the Canadian province of Ontario. In Michigan, it also followed US23 north of Standish.|$|E

5|$|The United States Army Observation Group, {{commonly}} known as <b>the</b> <b>Dixie</b> Mission, was the first U.S. effort to establish official relations with the Communist Party of China and the People's Liberation Army, then headquartered in the mountainous city of Yan'an. This mission was launched on 22 July 1944 during World War II, and lasted until 11 March 1947.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{music in}} North Georgia, including {{what is now}} Athens, {{was that of the}} Native Americans of the area, principally the Creek and the Cherokee. Athens was officially chartered in 1806, and began growing rapidly near the middle of the 19th century. By the time of the American Civil War in the 1860s, the city was an important part of musical life in Georgia. The war accelerated the development of the city's musical importance, as Athens was largely spared widespread destruction while the larger city of Atlanta {{took a long time to}} recover. Major touring acts like <b>the</b> <b>Dixie</b> Family and The Slomans visited Athens during the war; <b>the</b> <b>Dixie</b> Family, a prominent touring group, performed disastrously, according to local newspapers, who said that the highlight of the performance came from four local African American musicians, and <b>the</b> <b>Dixie</b> Family had absconded with the concert's proceeds, which had been promised to the local Ladies Aid Society. In the 1870s, the city was almost half African American, and local black-owned industry flourished; among the residents was Bob Cole, born in 1868 to a musically active family. Cole would later become a pioneer in African American theater, known for works like the 1898 musical A Trip to Coontown.|$|E
5|$|The highway {{was also}} part of the East Michigan Pike, {{designed}} to be a counterpart of the West Michigan Pike {{on the other side of}} the LP. The original route of the East Michigan Pike included a section along the coast of The Thumb between Bay City and Port Huron and used the same route as <b>the</b> <b>Dixie</b> Highway north of Bay City. Backers of this auto trail lost out in terms of name recognition to <b>the</b> <b>Dixie</b> Highway, relegating the East Michigan Pike to the list of failed auto trails. The southern part of what is now US23 in the state was {{also part of}} the auto trail craze. The Top of Michigan Trail was designated in 1917 from the state line north to the Bay City area, before turning inland along other roadways. The name faded from shortly after the time the Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) assigned the first highway numbers in the state.|$|E
5|$|The sugar {{refinery}} was a four-story {{structure on}} the bank of the Savannah River. Imperial Sugar, based in Sugar Land, Texas, had bought the refinery and its brand name in 1997 from a previous local owner.

5|$|Damage totals in the United States are {{not fully}} known, {{although}} media summaries of Nora included a loss to agriculture preliminarily estimated at several hundred million dollars, {{and at least one}} study places the figure at $150–200 million (1997 USD). It is estimated that $30–40 million (1997 USD) in damage to lemon trees occurred. Although Nora was significantly weakened, near hurricane-force winds were observed at <b>the</b> <b>Dixie</b> National Forest in southwestern Utah, where strong gusts sheared off the tops of large trees.|$|E
5|$|For his performance, Adrian Hubbard {{earned the}} Dwight Stephenson Lineman of the A-Day Game Award. In the game, Hubbard had seven tackles that {{included}} four tackles for a loss and three quarterback sacks.
