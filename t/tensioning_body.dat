40|$|Background : This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the effects of wild ginseng herbal acupuncture developed for the intravenous use. Healthy male and female volunteers(n= 57) went through Randomized Control Trials(RCT). Methods : For those who are under a medication due to common cold or other illnesses were excluded in the primary stage and the subjects with possible abnormalities in the pre-screening process were also excluded in the secondary stage. Then the examination groups were determined by random sampling. Experiment groups were divided into Normal saline injection group(control group), cultivated wild ginseng herbal acupuncture group(experiment group 1) and natural wild ginseng herbal acupuncture group(experiment group 2) Blood <b>tension,</b> <b>body</b> temperature, pulse, and other criteria were measured and analyzed. Results : 1. Intravenous injection of cultivated wild ginseng herbal acupuncture and natural wild ginseng herbal acupuncture didn't cause significant changes in the blood <b>tension,</b> pulse, <b>body</b> temperature, and etc. 2. No significant differences were witnessed in CBC, ESR, biochemistry of blood test and UA between the experiment groups. 3. No significant changes were noted in the thermography before and after the test in the experiment groups. 4. Some of the common physical changes occurring during and after the administration were fatigue, chest distension, and headache in all of the experiment groups. 5. Comparing general condition after one week from the termination of administration, the control group showed worst condition while as the natural wild ginseng herbal acupuncture group displayed best condition. Conclusion : From the above results, we can carefully deduce that the intravenous injection of the wild ginseng herbal acupuncture didn't show significant differences compared to injection of the normal saline. We can infer it is safe on the human body and further studies and reports must be followed...|$|R

40|$|The {{value of}} tension is often underestimated.

2500|$|Also, {{relaxation}} therapy {{can involve}} mental techniques to decrease <b>body</b> <b>tension.</b> The first is called [...] "focused imagery". Focused imagery involves concentration on relaxed body parts, followed by focus on tense muscles and imagining that the tense areas are being worked on or relaxed. The next mental technique involves {{focus on the}} whole body, instead of its individual parts. In [...] "deepening imagery", a person imagines the <b>body's</b> <b>tension</b> as a meter of high to low, and works to reduce tension mentally. An additional mental strategy involves creating and experiencing a location of relaxation in the mind. The last mental strategy involves the chronic headache patient visualizing a place of stress {{in his or her}} life and imagining a relaxed response. Meditation in a relaxing environment is also suggested to prevent headaches. Meditation often involves repeating a one syllable sound or staring at a visual object to help focus attention. Relaxation helps the body to unwind, preventing the formation of headaches.|$|R
40|$|Sleep hypoventilation (SH) may be {{important}} {{in the development of}} hypercapnic respiratory failure in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The prevalence of SH, associated factors, and overnight changes in waking arterial blood gases (ABG), were assessed in 54 stable hypercapnic COPD patients without concomitant sleep apnoea or morbid obesity. Lung function assessment, anthropomorphic measurements, and polysomnography with ABG measurement before and after sleep were conducted in all patients. Transcutaneous carbon dioxide tension (Pt,CO 2) was measured in sleep, using simultaneous arterial carbon dioxide tension (Pa,CO 2) for in vivo calibration and to correct for drift in the sensor. Of the patients, 43 % spent > or = 20 % of sleep time with Pt,CO 2 > 1. 33 kPa (10 mmHg) above waking baseline. Severity of SH was best predicted by a combination of baseline Pa,CO 2, body mass index and per cent rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep. REM-related hypoventilation correlated significantly with severity of inspiratory flow limitation in REM, and with apnoea/hypopnoea index. Pa,CO 2 increased mean+/-SD 0. 70 +/- 0. 65 kPa (5. 29 +/- 4. 92 mmHg) from night to morning, and this change was highly significant. The change in Pa,CO 2 was strongly correlated with severity of SH. Sleep hypoventilation is common in hypercapnic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and related to baseline arterial carbon dioxide <b>tension,</b> <b>body</b> mass index and indices of upper airway obstruction. Sleep hypoventilation is associated with significant increases in arterial carbon dioxide tension night-to-morning, and may contribute to long-term elevations in arterial carbon dioxide tension...|$|R

2500|$|Describing vocal {{sound is}} an inexact science {{largely because the}} human voice is a {{self-contained}} instrument.

In other words, most singers hear something different in their ears/head than what a person listening to them hears. As a result, voice teachers often focus less on how it [...] "sounds" [...] and more on how it [...] "feels". Vibratory sensations resulting from the closely related processes of phonation and resonation, and kinesthetic ones arising from muscle <b>tension,</b> movement, <b>body</b> position, and weight serve as a guide to the singer on correct vocal production.|$|R
