He explained that [...] "Signs and comic strips are interesting as subject matter. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>certain</b> <b>things</b> that are usable, forceful and vital about commercial art." [...] Rebecca Bengal at PBS wrote that Whaam!s graphic clarity exemplifies the ligne claire style associated with Hergé, a cartoonist whose influence Lichtenstein acknowledged. Lichtenstein {{was attracted to}} using a cool, formal style to depict emotive subjects, leaving the viewer to interpret the artist's intention. He adopted a simplified color scheme and commercial printing-like techniques. The borrowed technique was [...] "representing tonal variations with patterns of colored circles that imitated the half-tone screens of Ben Day dots used in newspaper printing, and surrounding these with black outlines {{similar to those used}} to conceal imperfections in cheap newsprint." [...] Lichtenstein once said of his technique: [...] "I take a cliche and try to organize its forms to make it monumental." ...|$|E

After initially being taken by ambulance to the on-circuit medical centre, he was airlifted to Maggiore Hospital shortly after, the second driver {{to be admitted}} there during the weekend. The session was restarted approximately 25minutes later, but several teams—including Williams and Benetton—took no further part.

His death marked the first Formula One race weekend fatality since the 1982 Canadian Grand Prix when Riccardo Paletti was killed. It had been eight years since Elio de Angelis died testing a Brabham car at the Circuit Paul Ricard. Professor Sid Watkins, then head of the Formula One on-track medical team, recalled in his memoirs Ayrton Senna's reaction to the news, stating that [...] "Ayrton broke down and cried on my shoulder." [...] Watkins tried to persuade Senna not to race the following day, asking [...] "What else do you need to do? You have been world champion three times, you are obviously the quickest driver. Give it up and let's go fishing." [...] Senna replied, [...] "Sid, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>certain</b> <b>things</b> over which we have no control. I cannot quit, I have to go on." ...|$|E

Adam had more scenes in the original cut. A scene that showed Jigsaw regretting his actions was also cut. Bell said, [...] "I'm glad they cut that scene. This guy knows exactly what he's doing.
