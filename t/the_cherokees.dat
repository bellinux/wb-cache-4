He {{took advantage of the}} many local business opportunities and was able to provide his family with whatever they needed. He also gained a reputation for honesty with his business associates, which included Cherokee Indian tribes in the area. Hindman became trusted by the Cherokee Nation and was appointed as the sub-agent to <b>the</b> <b>Cherokees</b> by President James Monroe. After Andrew Jackson became President, Hindman, Sr. was appointed to the post of United States Agent for the Cherokee Nation. The elder Hindman frequently traveled to Washington D.C. to discuss the interests of the Cherokee Nation, and in 1841 was assigned by Acting Secretary of War Albert M. Lea to determine why <b>the</b> <b>Cherokees</b> in North Carolina had rejected the government's suggestion to join other parts of the tribe in Indian Territory. Hindman spent almost two months unsuccessfully trying to persuade the North Carolina Cherokees to rejoin the rest of their nation further West.|$|E

The dam is operated by the Grand River Dam Authority and creates Grand Lake o' <b>the</b> <b>Cherokees.</b> After decades of vision and planning, it was constructed between 1938 and 1940 for the purposes of hydroelectric power generation, flood control and recreation.

5|$|After {{his unit}} was disbanded, Shelby {{surveyed}} for the Transylvania Company, a land company that purchased much of present-day Kentucky from <b>the</b> <b>Cherokees</b> {{in a deal}} later invalidated {{by the government of}} Virginia. After fulfilling his duties with the Transylvania Company, he rejoined his family in Virginia, but returned to Kentucky the following year to claim and improve land for himself. After falling ill, he returned home in July 1776 to recover. Back in Virginia, fighting in the American Revolutionary War was underway, and Shelby found a commission from the Virginia Committee of Safety appointing him captain of a company of Minutemen. In 1777, Virginia governor Patrick Henry appointed Shelby to a position securing provisions for the army on the frontier. He served a similar role for units in the Continental Army in 1778 and 1779. With his money, Shelby purchased provisions for John Sevier's 1779 expedition against the Chickamauga, a band of Cherokees who were resisting colonial expansion.|$|E
25|$|In 1825 <b>the</b> <b>Cherokee</b> Nation officially {{adopted the}} writing system.

40|$|The U. S. Civil War, immortalized through innumerable books, museums, {{films and}} {{historical}} monuments, {{was one of}} the most historically significant periods in U. S. history. Much like the rest of America, <b>the</b> <b>Cherokee</b> Nation was divided, leading to Cherokee soldiers fighting for both the Confederacy and Union Armies at the same time. The participation of <b>the</b> <b>Cherokee</b> Nation had lasting effects for <b>the</b> <b>Cherokee</b> people that continue to be felt in modern times. While several scholarly books have been written about <b>the</b> Confederate <b>Cherokees,</b> there has been little to no scholarly work written about <b>the</b> Union <b>Cherokee</b> soldiers. This thesis brings to light the participation of <b>the</b> Union <b>Cherokee</b> soldiers through <b>the</b> examination of <b>the</b> <b>Cherokee</b> Third Indian Home Guard, a regiment that served under both Confederate and Union Armies. Using primary sources from <b>the</b> <b>Cherokee</b> Nation, United States Army records, and others who interacted with Cherokee soldiers, this thesis paints a picture of <b>the</b> <b>Cherokee’s</b> participation in <b>the</b> Union ranks. It addresses the motivations for <b>the</b> Union <b>Cherokee</b> to fight in the Civil War, as well as <b>the</b> role of <b>Cherokee</b> history and internal conflicts in their decision to enter the war. It will also discuss how their army superiors viewed <b>the</b> <b>Cherokee,</b> how they viewed themselves as soldiers, and how the aftermath of the Civil War affects <b>the</b> <b>Cherokee</b> Nation today. <b>The</b> <b>Cherokee</b> fought <b>the</b> war to advance their own agenda, regarding the sovereignty of <b>the</b> <b>Cherokee</b> Nation within their own borders. <b>The</b> <b>Cherokee</b> fought in their own way, often clashing with the more systematic formula used by the Union army. Despite their service, <b>the</b> <b>Cherokee</b> found their sovereignty attacked during treaty negotiations following the Civil War. In the ensuing negotiations, <b>the</b> <b>Cherokee</b> were required to sell a portion of their territory to the U. S. Government and absorb the Delaware Nation and <b>the</b> <b>Cherokee</b> Freedmen into <b>the</b> <b>Cherokee</b> Nation. <b>The</b> inclusion of <b>the</b> Delaware and <b>Cherokee</b> Freedmen has still been a point of contention in the fight for sovereignty for <b>the</b> <b>Cherokee</b> Nation in recent history...|$|R
5|$|The English {{language}} has been {{official in the}} state of Oklahoma since 2010. The variety of North American English spoken is called Oklahoma English, and this dialect is quite diverse with its uneven blending of features of North Midland, South Midland, and Southern dialects. In 2000, 2,977,187 Oklahomans—92.6% of the resident population five years or older—spoke only English at home, a decrease from 95% in 1990. 238,732 Oklahoma residents reported speaking a language other than English in the 2000 census, about 7.4% of the state's population. Spanish is the second-most commonly spoken language in the state, with 141,060 speakers counted in 2000. The two most commonly spoken native North American languages are Cherokee and Choctaw with 10,000 Cherokee speakers living within the Cherokee Nation tribal jurisdiction area of eastern Oklahoma, and another 10,000 Choctaw speakers living in the Choctaw Nation directly south of <b>the</b> <b>Cherokees.</b> Cherokee is an official language in the Cherokee Nation tribal jurisdiction area and in the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians.|$|E

In the fall of 1783, the State of Virginia built a new fort at the Cumberland Gap, replacing an older fort which was adjudged to lie within the boundaries of North Carolina. The new Virginia fort was designed as the primary residence for Martin while he was in the region on official business.

25|$|At the Commission's {{organizational}} {{meeting on}} July 1, 1889, Interior Secretary Noble directed the Commission to begin negotiations with <b>the</b> <b>Cherokees</b> for cession of the Outlet.

Lucius Fairchild and the Commission first arrived in Tahlequah on July 29, and made an offer for the Outlet on August 2. Commission efforts did not bear fruition, and <b>the</b> <b>Cherokees</b> were notified on December 27, 1889, that the Commission's offer was to be withdrawn. At the urging of Noble and Fairchild, President Harrison issued a proclamation on February 17, 1890 banning all cattle and livestock from the Outlet, and ordering removal of any existing cattle and livestock no later than October 1, 1890, eliminating Cherokee income from the Outlet.|$|E

In 1760, he commanded an expedition against the Cherokee during the Anglo-Cherokee War. Montgomerie's expedition, which included 1,200 men, was successful in its mission.
