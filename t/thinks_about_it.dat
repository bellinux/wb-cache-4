While walking to the library, Cassie visits a Halloween shop, which {{she did not think}} was there before. After ignoring the warning within the book to not read it aloud, a monster known as the Evil Thing escapes into the city after her brother <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
500|$|Emma Brockes {{sees this}} in Wintour herself: [...] " [...] unwavering ability {{to look as}} if she lives within the pages of her {{magazine}} has a sort of honesty to it, proof that, whatever one <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> the lifestyle peddled by Vogue is at least physically possible." ...|$|E
500|$|Bob Bowman {{took over}} as head coach of Michigan for the 2004–05 season. [...] He put Tarwater on a new {{training}} program, with a greater focus on speed training and less on distance. [...] "We've also put him through weight training, and I think it's been improving his speed", Bowman said. [...] "He {{has a very strong}} work ethic and always wants to improve. Instead of just getting in the pool and doing what we tell him to do, he actually <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> and asks questions. He wants to know the theory behind what he's doing." [...] Tarwater won the 2005 NCAA championship in the 200-yard butterfly. [...] His time of 1:42.30 was a Michigan and Big Ten record, and the third fastest time in NCAA history. In the 100-meter butterfly, he placed fourth.|$|E

Stine's The Haunting Hour: Don't <b>Think</b> <b>About</b> <b>It.</b> The song hit #1 on the Radio Disney top 3. Osment also shot an accompanying music video for the song, released in The Haunting Hour: Don't <b>Think</b> <b>About</b> <b>It</b> DVD.|$|R

2500|$|Almost {{the entire}} band have openly stated their dislike of Union. Bruford has disowned the album entirely, and Wakeman was {{reportedly}} unable to recognise {{any of his}} keyboard work in the final edit and threw his copy of the album out of his limousine. He has since referred to the album as [...] "Onion" [...] because it makes him cry when he <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Union Co-producer Jonathan Elias later stated publicly {{in an interview that}} Anderson, as the associate producer, knew of the session musicians' involvement. He added that he and Anderson had even initiated their contributions, because hostility between some of the band members at the time was preventing work from being accomplished. The 1991–1992 Union tour united all eight members on a revolving circular stage. Following its conclusion, Bruford chose not to remain involved with Yes and returned to his jazz project Earthworks.|$|E

5000|$|Speaking {{of his son}} Christian, {{who died}} in November 2008 at age 39 from drug addiction, he said: [...] "You deal with it, but it's so difficult.

Tell me about your friends or relations, and where you live? I would like so much to know everything." ...|$|E
6000|$|This (need I say it?) made me {{determined}} {{to see the}} letter. My best way of persuading Benjamin {{to show it to}} me was to tell him of the sacrifice that I had made to my husband's wishes. [...] "I have no further voice in the matter," [...] I added, when I had done. [...] "It now rests entirely with Mr. Playmore to go on or to give up; and this is my last opportunity of discovering what he really <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Don't I deserve some little indulgence? Have I no claim to look at the letter?" ...|$|E

But if you mean that merry maiden up country, she's probably thinking, if she <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> at all, that she's the luckiest girl in the United States to have got out of an awful scrape so easily. At the worst, I only had fun with her in my letter. Probably she sees that she has nothing to grieve for but her own break." ...|$|E

[...] "Picks is the thing, {{moral or}} no moral; {{and as for}} me, I don't care shucks for the {{morality}} of it, nohow. When I start in to steal a nigger, or a watermelon, or a Sunday-school book, I ain't no ways particular how it's done so it's done. What I want is my nigger; or what I want is my watermelon; or what I want is my Sunday-school book; and if a pick's the handiest thing, that's the thing I'm a-going to dig that nigger or that watermelon or that Sunday-school book out with; and I don't give a dead rat what the authorities <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> nuther." ...|$|E
60|$|Were {{you ever}} puzzled {{to find out}} why the Psalms are read every Sunday in Church, more read, indeed, than any other part of the Bible? If any of you say, No, I shall not think you the wiser. It is very easy not to be puzzled with a deep matter, if one never <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> at all. But when a man sets his mind to work seriously, to try to {{understand}} what he hears and sees around him, then he will be puzzled, and no shame to him; for he will find things every day of his life which will require years of thought to understand, ay, things which, though we see and know that they are true, and can use and profit by them, we can never understand at all, at least in this life.|$|E

If it had been a chap of our own station in life I suppose there ain't nothing we wouldn't do for him, if we saw our way to it; and though I don't see as it's likely as we can do nothing for this young fellow, the least as we can do is to go and tell him what we <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Did he tell you where he lived, Evan?" ...|$|E
60|$|Of course, {{this is true}} only of {{the large}} {{majority}} of American editors. To say that it is true of all of them would be to cast too great obloquy upon the human race. Also, it would be untrue, for here and there an occasional editor does see clearly--and in his case, ruled by stomach-incentive, is usually afraid to say what he <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> So far as the science and the sociology of the revolution are concerned, the average editor is a generation or so behind the facts. He is intellectually slothful, accepts no facts until they are accepted by the majority, and prides himself upon his conservatism. He is an instinctive optimist, prone to believe that what ought to be, is. The revolutionist gave this up long ago, and believes not that what ought to be, is, but what is, is, and that it may not be what it ought to be at all.|$|E

I have spent some in books, but {{second-hand}} books are very cheap--as dad will find when he tries to sell them. So I've got some money put by. It don't matter how much, but plenty to keep the wolf away while the strike lasts. But I don't mean, mother, to have my savings drunk away. I'm getting sixteen bob a week, and I can live on ten or eleven, so I'll send you five shillings a week. But dad mustn't know it. I'll be home in a month again, and I'll leave you a pound, so that you can get food in. If he <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> at all, which ain't likely, you can make out you get it on tick. Well, dad, how are you?" [...] he asked, as Bill Haden entered the cottage.|$|E

60|$|All {{this is only}} {{an analogy}} and proves nothing. However, it may suggest, if one <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> that {{possibly}} {{we have made a}} slightly similar mistake about the animals; that we are not quite through with them when we have cried instinct and named their species, nor altogether justified in killing them industriously {{off the face of the}} earth--as we once did with the poor Beothuk Indians for the skins that they wore. Beneath their fur and feathers is their life; and a few observers are learning that their life also, with its faint suggestion of our own primeval childhood, is one of intense human interest. Some of them plan and calculate; and mathematics, however elementary, is hardly a matter of instinct. Some of them build dams and canals; some have definite social regulations; some rescue comrades; some bind their own wounds, and even set a broken leg, as will be seen in one of the following chapters. All higher orders communicate more or less with each other, and train their young, and modify their habits to meet changing conditions. These things, and many more quite as wonderful, are also facts. We are still waiting for the naturalist who will tell us truly what they mean.|$|E
60|$|In riding, {{it must be}} recollected {{that the}} temper of an ox is far less quick, though his sensations may be as acute as those of a horse: thus, he does not start {{forwards}} on receiving a cut with the whip, even though he shrink with the pain; but he <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> shakes his head, waits a while, and then breaks gradually into a faster pace. An ox will trot well enough with a light weight; and, though riding myself upwards of 13 stone, I once took an ox 60 miles in {{a day and a}} half: this is, perhaps as much as an ox could, in fairness, be made to do. A ride-ox can be tied up by his nose-bridle; but, if wild or frightened, he will assuredly struggle till the nose-stick be torn out of his nose, and he becomes free. It is, therefore, better to tie the bridle to a tuft of grass, or a slender twig, rather than to a tree or to the saddle-bags. Mounting an ox is usually a troublesome business, on account of his horns. To make ride-oxen quiet and tame, scratch their backs and tails--they dearly love it--and hold salt in your hands for them to lick. They soon learn their names, and come to be caressed when called.|$|E
60|$|Only {{second to}} the wedding morning, in the {{interest}} and expectation it engenders among the household, is this evening of the coming home. Mrs Perch is in the kitchen taking tea; and has made the tour of the establishment, and priced the silks and damasks by the yard, and exhausted every interjection in the dictionary and out of it expressive of admiration and wonder. The upholsterer's foreman, who has left his hat, with a pocket-handkerchief in it, both smelling strongly of varnish, under {{a chair in the}} hall, lurks about the house, gazing upwards at the cornices, and downward at the carpets, and occasionally, in a silent transport of enjoyment, taking a rule out of his pocket, and skirmishingly measuring expensive objects, with unutterable feelings. Cook is in high spirits, and says give her a place where there's plenty of company (as she'll bet you sixpence there will be now), for she is of a lively disposition, and she always was from a child, and she don't mind who knows it; which sentiment elicits from the breast of Mrs Perch a responsive murmur of support and approbation. All the housemaid hopes is, happiness for 'em--but marriage is a lottery, and the more she <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> the more she feels the independence and the safety of a single life. Mr Towlinson is saturnine and grim' and says that's his opinion too, and give him War besides, and down with the French--for this young man has a general impression that every foreigner is a Frenchman, and must be by the laws of nature.|$|E
