5|$|Archaeological {{surveys have}} found {{evidence}} that Native Americans used the immediate vicinity of Yucca Mountain on a temporary or seasonal basis. Some Native Americans disagree with the conclusions of archaeological investigators that their ancestors were highly mobile groups of hunter-gatherers who occupied the Yucca Mountain area before Euroamericans began using the area for prospecting, surveying, and ranching. <b>They</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> these conclusions overlook traditional accounts of farming that occurred before European contact.|$|E

5|$|In {{assessing}} {{the work of}} Tkach, there are two points of view. The critics of Tkach, especially those who formed the splinter churches, see Tkach as the key person responsible for {{the collapse of the}} WCG. <b>They</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the changes he brought were a turn against God and say his rejection of Armstrong's unique doctrines were, at best, without biblical foundation.|$|E
5|$|The Committee to Protect Journalists, Proceso magazine, {{and several}} journalists and press freedom {{organizations}} have complained about irregularities {{in the investigation}} and question {{the legitimacy of the}} whole case. <b>They</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> their colleague's murder was part of a campaign of intimidation against those who investigate alleged links between drug traffickers and politicians in the state of Veracruz.|$|E

5|$|Although condoms {{effectively}} {{prevent the}} sexual transmission of HIV, several factors have limited widespread condom distribution and uptake in Malawi. People living in non-urban areas often have difficulty accessing condoms, and condoms are not typically available at bars {{and other social}} locations where {{they could have a}} significant impact on HIV prevention. Many people oppose condoms because <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> condoms make sex less enjoyable or because they question their ability to prevent the transmission of HIV. However, despite these factors, many unmarried couples have started using condoms more consistently as concern and fear about the HIV/AIDS epidemic have increased.|$|E
5|$|But {{the aliens}} became extinct before {{completing}} their work. As {{the human race}} bred and evolved, only a percentage retained their psychic abilities, which surfaced only sporadically. For centuries the buried ship had occasionally triggered those dormant abilities, which explained the reports of poltergeists; people were unknowingly using their own telekinesis to move objects around, and the ghost sightings were traces of a racial memory. The authorities, and Breen in particular, find this explanation preposterous despite being shown the recording of Barbara's vision. <b>They</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the craft is a Nazi propaganda weapon and the alien bodies fakes designed to create exactly the impressions that Quatermass has succumbed to, and decide to hold a media event to stem the rumours that are already spreading.|$|E
5|$|Chryssides {{states that}} Raëlism is {{discernible}} from other UFO religions for its heavy support for physicalism and repudiation of supernaturalism. Susan J.

They learn that the scratches have been caused by a myna, and that drug smuggler Jacques Renault (Walter Olkewicz) owns one.

5|$|Despite his {{reputation}} among his contemporaries for untruth and fantasy, Morrell has been defended by some later commentators who, while questioning his general reliability, maintain {{that not all}} his life was fraud and exaggeration. <b>They</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> aside from the bombast and boastful tone of the account that carries his name, {{there is evidence that}} he carried out useful work, such his discovery of large-scale guano deposits which {{led to the development of}} a full-scale industry. He is believed to have died in 1838 or 1839, in Mozambique; there is, however, evidence to suggest that this death might have been staged, and that he lived on in exile, possibly in South America.|$|E
5|$|In {{keeping with}} their history, the Churches of Christ claim the New Testament as their sole rule {{of faith and}} {{practice}} in deciding matters of doctrine and ecclesiastical structure. They view the Old Testament as divinely inspired and historically accurate, {{but they do not}} consider its laws to be binding under the New Covenant in Christ (unless they are repeated in the New Testament) (Hebrews 8: 7-13). <b>They</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the New Testament demonstrates how a person may become a Christian (and thus a part of the universal Church of Christ) and how a church should be collectively organized and carry out its scriptural purposes.|$|E

Change in gaze direction is one of several behavioral cues that individuals use in combination with changes in facial and vocal displays and body posture to mark the intention to act on an object. Individuals who seek or follow a joint focus of attention display knowledge that what is in their awareness is also in another's awareness. <b>They</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> they are experiencing the same world as others.|$|E
5|$|Mahavira {{has been}} mistakenly called {{the founder of}} Jainism. Jains believe that there were 23 {{teachers}} before the Mahavira, and <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Jainism was founded in far more ancient times {{than that of the}} Mahavira, whom they revere as the 24th Tirthankara. The first 22 Tirthankaras are placed in mythical times. For example, the 22nd Tirthankara Arishtanemi is believed in the Jain tradition to have been born 84,000 years before the 23rd Tirthankara named Parshvanatha. Mahavira is sometimes placed within Parshvanatha lineage, but this is contradicted by all Jain texts, which state that Mahavira renounced the world alone.|$|E
5|$|Reformed theologians believe sacraments to be instituted in {{the context}} of {{covenants}} between God and people. <b>They</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> when God makes covenants, he provides physical signs associated with the covenant. Old Testament covenant signs include the rainbow which appeared following a covenant made with Noah. Circumcision is believed to be a sign of God's covenant with Abraham and his descendants. Such signs entail blessings and sanctions on those with whom God covenants. In the New Testament period there are two such signs or sacraments: baptism and the Lord's Supper.|$|E

Males and females can do almost everything equally; however, the females often specialize in the arts of healing while the males go to war. This is because <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> taking life interferes {{with the ability to}} preserve life. However, Elves are not stuck in rigid roles; females can defend themselves at need as well as males, and many males are skilled healers as well, such as Elrond.|$|E
