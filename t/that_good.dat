5|$|At the Opéra-Comique, Messager {{encouraged}} Claude Debussy {{to complete}} his opera Pelléas et Mélisande and worked closely with him in getting the orchestration ready for the premiere. He conducted the premiere in 1902 and in gratitude the work was dedicated to him. Messager also conducted the premieres of Massenet's Grisélidis and Charpentier's Louise. As a conductor, he won praise from critics {{on both sides of}} the English Channel. The English music critic Francis Toye wrote <b>that</b> <b>good</b> though Arturo Toscanini's conducting of Pelléas et Mélisande was at La Scala in Milan, Messager's was still better.|$|E

5|$|Icke {{combines}} New Age philosophical {{discussion about}} the universe and consciousness with conspiracy theories about public figures being reptilian humanoids and paedophiles. He argues in favour of reincarnation; a collective consciousness that has intentionality; modal realism (that other possible worlds exist alongside ours); and the law of attraction (<b>that</b> <b>good</b> and bad thoughts can attract experiences).|$|E

Doctor Baird, St Vincent's personal physician, was appointed to the Sick and Hurt Board as Inspector of all Hospitals.|$|E
5|$|This {{measure of}} {{elasticity}} is {{sometimes referred to}} as the own-price elasticity of demand for a good, i.e., the elasticity of demand with respect to the good's own price, in order to distinguish it from the elasticity of demand for <b>that</b> <b>good</b> with respect to the change in the price of some other good, i.e., a complementary or substitute good. The latter type of elasticity measure is called a cross-price elasticity of demand.|$|E

At the same time, Lawrence's recent invention, the cyclotron, promised to revolutionise experimental nuclear physics, and Chadwick felt that the Cavendish laboratory would fall behind unless it also acquired one. He therefore chafed under Rutherford, who clung to the belief <b>that</b> <b>good</b> nuclear physics could still be done without large, expensive equipment, and turned down the request for a cyclotron.|$|E

With an uphill finish, Van Dijk lost the sprint from Johansson (Orica-AIS) and finished second ahead of Amy Pieters (Rabo Liv). Van Dijk won the mountain classification of the race. In June, Van Dijk started as the main favourite at the Dutch National Time Trial Championships, but did not win her fourth time trial title. She finished second, with a margin of only 0.02 seconds, behind Annemiek van Vleuten (Rabo Liv). Van Dijk was disappointed and responded that she was not <b>that</b> <b>good</b> as in 2013 without having a real explanation for it.|$|E

The mixed doubles was granted to Cochet and Colette Rosambert following {{the retirement of}} Béla von Kehrling and Elizabeth Ryan prior to the match due to the leg pain of Ryan.

5|$|The {{meeting with}} Fermi yielded no supplies, {{but it did}} result in Pontecorvo {{receiving}} an offer from von Halban and Placzek to join the Tube Alloys team at the Montreal Laboratory in Canada. There was some concern from Sir Edward Appleton over his appointment, not because of Pontecorvo's political beliefs, but {{on account of the}} fact that he was not a British national, and there were already a large number of foreign scientists working on Tube Alloys. Appleton was ultimately persuaded due to Pontecorvo's reputation, and the fact <b>that</b> <b>good</b> physicists were in short supply. Pontecorvo was officially appointed to Tube Alloys on 15 January 1943, and arrived in Montreal with his family on 7 February 1943. The Montreal team designed a nuclear reactor using heavy water as a neutron moderator, but lacked the quantity of heavy water needed. In August 1943 Churchill and Roosevelt negotiated the Quebec Agreement, which resulted in a resumption of cooperation between the United States and Great Britain, merging Tube Alloys into the Manhattan Project.|$|E
5|$|Various {{forms of}} divine command theory have been {{presented}} by philosophers including William of Ockham, St Augustine, Duns Scotus, and John Calvin. The theory generally teaches that moral truth does not exist independently of God and that morality is determined by divine commands. Stronger versions of the theory assert that God's command is {{the only reason that}} a good action is moral, while weaker variations cast divine command as a vital component within a greater reason. The theory asserts <b>that</b> <b>good</b> actions are morally good {{as a result of their}} being commanded by God, and many religious believers subscribe to some form of divine command theory. Because of these premises, adherents believe that moral obligation is obedience to God's commands; what is morally right is what God desires.|$|E
5|$|When Bart {{finds out}} her secret and reveals {{it to the}} school, her social ranking plummets to a new low until a psychic force tells Lady Gaga that Lisa needs her help immediately. After much soul searching and yelling at Lady Gaga for trying to help, Lisa realizes that her {{outburst}} helped her because she is finally expressing her anger instead of bottling it up inside her, in effect making Lady Gaga's mission successful. Lisa catches Lady Gaga just before she leaves town to apologize, and after being forgiven she and Lady Gaga perform a duet together. With Lady Gaga's assistance, Lisa and the entire town of Springfield realize that being oneself is better than being like anyone else. Just as Lady Gaga's train begins to leave again, Moe runs {{up to her and}} asks if she can help him as well, but Lady Gaga declines, stating that she's not <b>that</b> <b>good.</b> As Moe turns and walks across the train track, a second train hits him.|$|E

25|$|There is a {{large body}} of {{research}} linking friendship and health, but the precise reasons for the connection remain unclear. Most of the studies in this area are large prospective studies that follow people over time, and while there may be a correlation between the two variables (friendship and health status), researchers still do not know if there is a cause and effect relationship, such as the notion <b>that</b> <b>good</b> friendships actually improve health. A number of theories have attempted to explain this link. These theories have included <b>that</b> <b>good</b> friends encourage their friends to lead more healthy lifestyles; <b>that</b> <b>good</b> friends encourage their friends to seek help and access services when needed; <b>that</b> <b>good</b> friends enhance their friends' coping skills in dealing with illness and other health problems; and <b>that</b> <b>good</b> friends actually affect physiological pathways that are protective of health.|$|E
