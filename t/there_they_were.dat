5|$|This {{surrender}} {{was accepted}} by Brigadier J. R. Stevenson, who represented Lieutenant General Vernon Sturdee, {{the commander of the}} First Australian Army, on board the warship HMAS Diamantina.

5|$|Assigned to the 11th Brigade, 3rd Division, in May {{the newly}} formed {{battalion}} undertook amphibious training and intensive physical activities such as route marches around Yorkeys Knob, Queensland, in preparation for deployment overseas. In June–July 1943, {{under the command of}} Lieutenant Colonel Geoffrey Brock, the battalion was deployed to Merauke, in Dutch New Guinea as part of Merauke Force. They departed from Cairns on board the TSS Canberra on 20 June, arriving at Thursday Island on 24 June. From <b>there</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> transferred to Horn Island before boarding the MV Van de Ljin and arriving at Merauke on 16 July 1943.|$|E

5|$|Concerned {{after the}} loss of Bismarck, Adolf Hitler ordered the Kriegsmarine to move the ships to Germany for {{overhauls}} in preparation for their deployment to Norway. <b>There</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> {{to serve as a}} fleet in being, and as the premier naval defence for German-occupied Norway. After lengthy discussions the Oberkommando der Marine opted for the shorter, but arguably more dangerous route, through the English Channel.|$|E
5|$|Forts Monroe and Wool {{gave the}} Union forces {{control of the}} {{entrance}} to Hampton Roads. The blockade, initiated on April 30, 1861, cut off Norfolk and Richmond from the sea almost completely. To further the blockade, the Union Navy stationed {{some of its most}} powerful warships in the roadstead. <b>There,</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> under the shelter of the shore-based guns of Fort Monroe and the batteries at Hampton and Newport News and out of the range of the guns at Sewell's Point and Craney Island. For most of {{the first year of the}} war, the Confederacy could do little to oppose or dislodge them.|$|E
5|$|In Melbourne, Blamey met Minnie Millard, the {{daughter}} of a Toorak stockbroker who was involved in the Methodist Church <b>there.</b> <b>They</b> <b>were</b> married at her home on 8 September 1909.

He also authorized Alfonso VII of León and Castile to equate his campaigns against the Moors with the rest of the Second Crusade. In May 1147, the first contingents of crusaders left from Dartmouth in England for the Holy Land. Bad weather forced the ships to stop on the Portuguese coast, at the northern city of Porto on 16 June 1147. <b>There</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> convinced to meet with King Afonso I of Portugal.|$|E
5|$|Initially Göth's {{plan was}} that all the factories, {{including}} Schindler's, should be moved inside the camp gates. However, Schindler, {{with a combination of}} diplomacy, flattery, and bribery, not only prevented his factory from being moved, but convinced Göth to allow him to build (at his own expense) a subcamp at Emalia to house his workers plus 450 Jews from other nearby factories. <b>There</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> safe from the threat of random execution, were well fed and housed, and were even permitted to undertake religious observances.|$|E
5|$|The {{steamship}} Killarney {{arrived in}} Bangkok on April 26. How {{they would be}} received was speculative, since Hawaii had no treaty with Siam. Upon arrival, they were carried aboard a royal yacht up the Menam River to Bangkok. From <b>there,</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> carried on silk chairs {{to one of the}} many palaces in Bangkok for the duration of their visit. The following day they met with King Chulalongkorn who told Kalākaua that the Siamese and Native Hawaiians were related by the common Malayan bloodline.

5|$|The third type was the Canadian Pacer, {{which was}} {{historically}} better documented {{than the other}} two types. Canadian Pacers were likely the result of breeding pacing horses imported from France with Narragansett Pacers from New England. The resulting horses were known for their ability to race on ice. From <b>there,</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> exported to the United States, where North Carolina became a breeding center, later exporting them to Tennessee in the late 1700s. Pedigrees were not maintained, so early breeding histories are often impossible to trace. The Canadian Pacer influenced the Tennessee Walker, the American Saddlebred and the Standardbred.|$|E
5|$|When the Lewis and Clark Expedition {{reached the}} Platte in 1804, {{they found the}} Kitkehahkis (whom they mistakenly called Arapahos) living <b>there.</b> <b>They</b> <b>were</b> told that the band had {{returned}} to the Republican about ten years before (that is, before the conflict with the Omahas), but had recently moved to the Platte under pressure from the Kanzas. By 1806, however, the Kitkehahkis were at peace with the Kanzas, and were once again living on the Republican.|$|E
5|$|As {{the forward}} {{companies}} {{began to move}} back towards the main defensive position, jeeps were sent up to collect the wounded while McKinna led a force of two platoons and two tanks out to the perimeter at the Hatai junction. <b>There</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> able to reclaim the mortars that had earlier been abandoned and destroyed {{them so that they}} could not be used against the Australians again, but the jeeps carrying the wounded ran into a Japanese ambush in which five Australians were killed. McKinna then organised a quick counterattack, taking a force up the road along with three tanks and subsequently attacking the ambushing force, killing 11, before forming a harbour around the tanks for the night.|$|E

5|$|Chelsea faced Greek side Olympiacos in {{the first}} {{knockout}} round.

The first leg {{was held at the}} Şükrü Saracoğlu Stadium in Istanbul, and ended in a 2–1 defeat, as Deivid made up for an early own goal by scoring the winner nine minutes from time after Colin Kazim-Richards' equaliser. Chelsea won the second leg at Stamford Bridge 2–0, with goals from Ballack and Lampard, to claim a 3–2 aggregate victory over the Turkish side.|$|E
5|$|During the fighting, {{out of a}} {{total of}} 976 men deployed, the {{battalion}} lost 137 men killed in action and 106 wounded, while a further 24 suffered from shell shock. A total of 808 men were taken into captivity, including most of the wounded. Four men managed to escape to Australia but of the remaining men, 263 died while prisoners of war. Following their capture, the men from the 2/4th in Singapore were concentrated in Changi prison, before being split up and sent to various prison camps around the Pacific, including Borneo, Burma, Thailand, Java, Sumatra, Japan and Formosa. <b>There</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> used as slave labour on the Burma–Thai Railway, in coal mines and on wharves, during which they were subjected to harsh treatment, starvation, disease and extreme brutality, which took a heavy toll. Many soldiers from the 2/4th were also killed while being taken to Japan, when the ships were sunk by Allied submarines.|$|E
5|$|Edward now {{seized the}} initiative, and moved northwards. Lancaster convened one final meeting at Doncaster in November, and also entered into an {{alliance}} with Robert I of Scotland to strengthen his hand against the King. In January 1322 Edward crossed the River Severn, and secured the surrender {{of several of the}} marcher lords while Lancaster remained passive. As the royal army crossed the River Trent after the Battle of Burton Bridge, Lancaster was forced to flee north. On 16 March Lancaster and his army had reached Boroughbridge by the River Ure where they were joined by the Earl's Secretary Sir Robert de Holland and the force he had raised in Lancashire. <b>There</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> cut off by the forces of Sir Andrew Harclay, a veteran from the Scottish wars, who had gathered the levies from the counties of Cumberland and Westmorland.|$|E
