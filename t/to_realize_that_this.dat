Carr {{commented that}} [...] "in {{the passion of}} the moment" [...] the Allied Powers had [...] "failed <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> extorted {{admission}} of guilt could prove nothing, and must excite bitter resentment in German minds." [...] He concluded [...] "German men of learning set to work to demonstrate the guiltlessness of their country, fondly believing that, if this could be established, the whole fabric of the treaty would collapse." [...] René Albrecht-Carrié wrote in May 1940, that [...] "article 231 gave rise to an unfortunate controversy, unfortunate because it served to raise a false issue." [...] He wrote that the German inter-war argument [...] "rested on her responsibility for the out-break of the war" [...] and if that guilt could be disproved then the legal requirement to pay reparations would disappear.|$|E

Kennedy for the Los Angeles Times was {{generally}} more positive regarding the episode's musical performances, however {{was critical of}} the ongoing pregnancy plot, noting that he cringed whenever Quinn appeared on screen. Conversely, Bobby Hankinson of the Houston Chronicle enjoyed Quinn in the episode, writing: [...] "I love that she can keep her Mean Girls edge while being heartbreakingly sad or as joyful as she was singing [...] "Papa Don't Preach". He countered criticism of the portrayal of New Directions' rival choirs, suggesting: [...] "at this point, everyone needs <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> show takes its jabs at everyone, but it always has a wink and a hug and {{lots and lots of}} love behind it." [...] Entertainment Weekly Dan Snierson reviewed the episode positively, calling the [...] "Imagine" [...] performance [...] "a classic feel-good Glee moment, teeming with sappy but undeniable heart", while Aly Semigran of MTV deemed it her favorite musical moment from the show, feeling that it: [...] "honored the classic song in such a respectful way." ...|$|E

As shown with the example of Roundup Ready soybeans grown in Argentina and Brazil, the future of American agriculture may be jeopardized if American farmers alone bear the costs of the research and development for development of new GM varieties.

Nothing marked their youthful date so much to the Marches, who presently joined them, as their failure <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> in <b>this</b> peaceful sea the great battle between the Kearsarge and the Alabama was fought.
