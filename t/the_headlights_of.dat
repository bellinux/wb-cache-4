5|$|The {{road was}} {{originally}} built with two lanes in each direction, {{but with an}} unusually wide central reservation to accommodate a third lane to be added each way at a later date. The work was a compromise between the Ministry of Transport and Drake, the latter who thought two lanes would not be adequate. Initially, the shoulders were hardened with gravel but not paved, a fact still reflected in the British term hard shoulder. A hedge was planted {{along the length of}} the central reservation to help reduce dazzle from <b>the</b> <b>headlights</b> <b>of</b> oncoming traffic at night. The road was constructed to not be a long length of straight road and with the addition of various bridges and tree planting, in the hope to prevent driver boredom reported on foreign motorways.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} {{opens with a}} view of Rihanna lying in open waters, as other scenes of {{diamonds}} being rolled in a manner suggestive of making a joint are intercut– a scene reminiscent of the single's artwork. As the video progresses Rihanna is shown running on a highway. In a black-and-white scene, Rihanna licks the joint and begins smoking it. The image fades to black as the song begins. Rihanna performs in the same black-and-white setting while in a black corset. Images of Rihanna on a bed in a room while singing are shown, with objects breaking, curtains falling and roses burning in reverse effect. Rihanna is shown again on the highway, running away from what appears to be <b>the</b> <b>headlights</b> <b>of</b> a chasing car. She then stops as she looks up to the night sky at an aurora view. Throughout the video, Rihanna's hand is shown intertwined with that of a heavily tattooed man, whose face is not shown in the video. As the second verse starts, Rihanna is shown in a desert where horses run freely. Scenes of a street battle are later shown, depicting burning cars and broken glass around the environment. As the video continues, the singer and her lover's hands are shown slowly slipping apart, with only their fingertips touching towards the conclusion of the video. The video ends with Rihanna once again floating alone in the open waters.|$|E
25|$|Headlight {{flashing}} is the act {{of either}} briefly switching on <b>the</b> <b>headlights</b> <b>of</b> a car, or of momentarily switching between a headlight's high beams and low beams, {{in an effort to}} communicate with another driver or drivers. The signal is sometimes referred to in car manufacturers' manuals as an optical horn, since it draws the attention of other drivers.|$|E

25|$|In October 1976 an {{international}} conference for Africa {{on the progress of}} the religion was held in Nairobi- some 1300 Bahá'ís from 61 countries attended and speakers included Hands of the Cause William Sears, John Robarts, Rahmatu'llah Muhájir, and Enoch Olinga, Counselor Thelma Khelgati, 'Aziz Yazdi, and member of the national assembly Catherine Mboya. There were 20 Knights of Bahá'u'lláh attending. The conference attendees received messages from the Universal House of Justice and was welcomed to Kenya by government minister N. W. Munoko. 'Azidi reviewed the history of the progress of the religion in Africa from its first Bábi visitor through to the then existing 34 national assemblies. Note was taken of the difficulties in Ethiopia and Uganda both in turmoil in 1975-6. Examples of the spread of the religion in other regions of the world were reviewed driven by pioneers where a few lead to many who joined the religion. And teachings of the religion including the role of youth, the emancipation of women and importance of family life were outlined. Translations of all talks and break out sessions were held in English, French, Persian and Swahili. A Unity Feast was held the night before the opening of the conference – an accident had cut power at the conference grounds but lighting was supplied by <b>the</b> <b>headlights</b> <b>of</b> the busses. Publicity of the conference included coverage by newspaper and radio including the East African Standard.|$|E
500|$|The next schedule, {{which began}} on 18 June, filmed in London and Belfast for 60 days. At the Causeway Pictures studio in Northern Ireland, 1:Nenokkadine {{was the first}} Telugu film shot in Belfast. Hollywood stunt co-ordinator Conrad Palmisano {{supervised}} stunts by Mahesh and others. Rathnavelu called the action scene in a London car park [...] "one of the most satisfying" [...] things he had ever done. The scene takes place during a power failure, with <b>the</b> <b>headlights</b> <b>of</b> motorcycles chasing the protagonist the only sources of light. To film the scene, Rathnavelu used LED lamps and three torchlights; smoke was pumped into the air to create a backdrop. When scenes were filmed on one of London's three main bridges, traffic was stopped {{on both sides of}} the bridge for more than eight hours.|$|E
500|$|Jason Dohring, {{who played}} Logan Echolls, {{originally}} auditioned {{for the role}} of Duncan Kane. Teddy Dunn originally auditioned for Logan, but ended up portraying Duncan Kane. Dohring felt that his audition for Duncan [...] "was a little dark", and he was told by the producers that it was [...] "not really right". The producers asked Dohring to read {{for the role of}} Logan, which involved reading Duncan's lines. Dohring acted one scene from the pilot, in which he shattered <b>the</b> <b>headlights</b> <b>of</b> a car with a crowbar. During the final auditions, Dohring read two times with Bell and met with the studio and the network. When reading with Bell, Dohring acted the whole scene as if he had raped her, and tried to give the character an evil and fun feel. At the time of Dohring's audition for Logan, the character was only going to be a guest star in the pilot.|$|E

500|$|After {{playing for}} England in the Tri-series in Australia {{at the start}} of the year, Buttler was once again {{involved}} with England at an international tournament, playing in the 2015 Cricket World Cup in Australia and New Zealand. Later in the English winter he was called back into the Test side as first choice Test wicket-keeper during the tour of the West Indies. He continued in the role throughout the English summer, playing both Tests against New Zealand and all five Ashes Tests against Australia. Buttler's batting during the Ashes series was criticised by Boycott, saying [...] "Jos Buttler is like a rabbit caught in <b>the</b> <b>headlights</b> <b>of</b> Ashes cricket. A seven-year-old schoolboy would have played better. He hasn't made a run all series. He hasn't shown any application whatsoever. It looks to me like his mind and confidence is shot for Test cricket – it's pathetic." [...] He continued to play one-day cricket alongside his Test role, making his highest ODI score of 129 from 77 balls against New Zealand.|$|E
500|$|Some film {{sequences}} {{were shot}} {{with up to}} 14 cameras, significantly more than the norm at that time. There were many difficulties with the film's lighting; cinematographer Mathur reportedly took eight hours to light a single shot. In total, 500 days of shooting were needed, compared to a normal schedule of 60 to 125 shooting days at the time. Owing to the very large size of the Sheesh Mahal set, the lighting was provided by <b>the</b> <b>headlights</b> <b>of</b> 500 trucks and about 100 reflectors. The presence of the mirrors on the set caused problems, as they sparkled under the lights. Foreign consultants, including British director David Lean, told Asif to forget the idea since they {{felt that it was}} impossible to film the scene under the intense glare. Asif confined himself to the set with the lighting crew, and subsequently overcame the problem by covering all the mirrors with a thin layer of wax, thereby subduing their reflectivity. Mathur also used strategically placed strips of cloth to implement [...] "bounce lighting", which reduced the glare.|$|E
500|$|Kristen Bell {{was chosen}} to play Veronica Mars from more than 500 women who auditioned for the role. Bell {{felt that it was}} [...] "just luck" [...] that Rob Thomas saw that [...] "I have some sass to me, and that's exactly what he wanted". Bell thought that it was her {{cheerleader}} looks and an outsider's attitude that set her apart from the other women who auditioned.

500|$|Dönitz was {{aided by}} {{high-quality}} photographs from a reconnaissance overflight by Siegfried Knemeyer, (who received his first Iron Cross for the mission), and which revealed {{the weaknesses of}} the defences and an abundance of targets. He directed Prien to enter Scapa Flow from its east via Kirk Sound, passing {{to the north of}} Lamb Holm, a small low-lying island between Burray and Mainland. Prien initially mistook the more southerly Skerry Sound for the chosen route and his sudden realisation that U-47 was heading for the shallow blocked passage forced him to order a rapid turn to the northeast. On the surface, and illuminated by a bright display of the aurora borealis, the submarine threaded between the sunken blockships Seriano and Numidian, grounding itself temporarily on a cable strung from Seriano. It was briefly caught in <b>the</b> <b>headlights</b> <b>of</b> a taxi onshore, but the driver raised no alarm. On entering the harbour proper at 00:27 on 14 October, Prien entered a triumphant [...] in the log and set a south-westerly course for several kilometres before reversing direction. To his surprise, the anchorage appeared to be almost empty; unknown to him, Forbes' order to disperse the fleet had removed some of the biggest targets. U-47 had been heading directly towards four warships, including the newly commissioned light cruiser , anchored off Flotta and Hoy 4 nautical miles (8km, 5mi) distant, but Prien gave no indication that he had seen them.|$|E

2500|$|The main {{facility}} at Paranal is the VLT, {{which consists of}} four nearly identical [...] unit telescopes (UTs), each hosting two or three instruments. These large telescopes can also work together in groups {{of two or three}} as a giant interferometer. The ESO Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) allows astronomers to see details up to 25 times finer than those seen with the individual telescopes. The light beams are combined in the VLTI with a complex system of mirrors in underground tunnels, where the light paths must diverge less than 1/1000mm over 100 metres. The VLTI can achieve an angular resolution of milliarcseconds, equivalent to the ability to see <b>the</b> <b>headlights</b> <b>of</b> a car on the moon.|$|E

[...] Common colours for police warning beacons are blue and red, however this often varies by force. Several types of flashing lights are used, such as rotating beacons, halogen lights, or light emitting diode strobes. Some police forces also use arrow sticks to direct traffic, or message display boards to provide short messages or instructions to motorists. <b>The</b> <b>headlights</b> <b>of</b> some vehicles can be made to flash, or small strobe lights can be fitted in the headlight, tail light and indicator lights of the vehicle.|$|E
