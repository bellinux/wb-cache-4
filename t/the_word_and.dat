5|$|On 17 December, Ferdinand again {{asked the}} castle's {{defenders}} to surrender. They replied {{that they did}} not know the meaning of <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>and</b> would hold the Godesburg to the last man. A report dated 23 December 1583 relates that, having given Ferdinand a rude reply, the defenders went back to lunch.|$|E
5|$|While {{the name}} Thuthmose {{had also been}} {{identified}} (but not read) by Young who realized that the first syllable was spelled with a depiction of an ibis representing Thoth, Champollion was {{able to read the}} phonetic spelling of the second part of <b>the</b> <b>word,</b> <b>and</b> check it against the mentioning of births in the Rosetta stone. This finally confirmed to Champollion that the ancient texts as well as the recent ones used the same writing system, and that it was a system that mixed logographic and phonetic principles.|$|E
5|$|Eusebius {{listed the}} Gospel of the Hebrews in his Antilegomena {{as one of}} the disputed {{writings}} of the early Church. Despite this, the Church Fathers occasionally used it, with reservations, as a source to support their exegetical arguments. Eusebius reports that the 2nd century Church Father Hegesippus used the gospel as a source for writing his Hypomneumata ("Memoranda") in Rome (c.175–180). The Alexandrian Fathers – Clement, Origen, and Didymus the Blind – relied directly on the gospel to provide prooftexts as a supplement to the canonical gospels. Clement quoted from the gospel as part of a discourse on divine Wisdom. Origen used it to compare differing views of the relationship between <b>the</b> <b>Word</b> <b>and</b> the Holy Spirit. Jerome claimed to have used the gospel as a prooftext, although he may have relied in part on excerpts from the commentaries of Origen. He quoted from it as a proof from prophecy based on Isaiah11.2 to explain how Jesus was the fulfillment of messianic expectations. The Gospel of the Hebrews was excluded from the canon by the Catholic Church with the closing of the New Testament canon {{at the end of the}} 4th century, and was no longer cited as a source in Church literature.|$|E

50|$|Linguistics is {{primarily}} {{the study of}} language that {{is divided into three}} broad aspects including the form of language, the meaning of language, and the context or function of language. The first aspect, form is based on <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>and</b> sounds of language <b>and</b> uses <b>the</b> <b>words</b> to make sentences that make sense. The second aspect, meaning, focuses on the meaning <b>and</b> significance of <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>and</b> sentences that human beings have put together. The third aspect, function, or context is based on recognizing the meaning of <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>and</b> sentences being said and using them to understand why a person is communicating.|$|R
5|$|Traditionally it is Jean-Baptiste Say who is {{credited}} for coining <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>and</b> advancing {{the concept of}} the entrepreneur, but in fact it was Cantillon who first introduced the term in Essai. Cantillon divided society into two principal classes—fixed income wage-earners and non-fixed income earners. Entrepreneurs, according to Cantillon, are non-fixed income earners who pay known costs of production but earn uncertain incomes, due to the speculative nature of pandering to an unknown demand for their product. Cantillon, while providing the foundations, did not develop a dedicated theory of uncertainty—the topic was not revisited until the 20th century, by Ludwig von Mises, Frank Knight, and John Maynard Keynes, among others. Furthermore, unlike later theories of entrepreneurship which saw the entrepreneur as a disruptive force, Cantillon anticipated the belief that the entrepreneur brought equilibrium to a market by correctly predicting consumer preferences.|$|E
