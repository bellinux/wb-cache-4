40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to examine the {{determinants}} of three types of music consumption: physical, digital and live performances. We conducted a structured questionnaire survey (n = 214). We used regression analysis to we elicit which factors play the most important role affecting our respondents in buying and/or <b>downloading</b> <b>music.</b> The main findings can be summarised as follows. The decision to buy recorded <b>music</b> or <b>download</b> is affected by age: younger people tend <b>to</b> <b>download</b> more whilst older people tend to buy more recorded music. Males buy more recorded music than do females, whereas women go to more live concerts than do men. People motivated more by experiential considerations tend to purchase more recorded music. On the other hand, people motivated more by imaginal aspects (who project pictures, memories and images in their minds whilst consuming <b>music)</b> tend <b>to</b> <b>download</b> <b>music.</b> We interpret this finding as meaning that consumers are more likely <b>to</b> <b>download</b> <b>music</b> if they feel connected to it in some way...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} better {{understand}} the psychosocial factors involved in consumption to <b>online</b> <b>music,</b> we examine the role that two types of social networks—advising network and emotional network—play in individual consumption to digital music, especially the consumption to <b>online</b> <b>music</b> in China. Using survey data from 154 college students in 3 universities, we find that the person who is more dependent on social network may tend <b>to</b> <b>download</b> <b>music</b> from internet and consultation network has more influence on <b>downloading</b> <b>music</b> from internet than friendship network as well as some interesting results. We conclude the paper by discussing theoretical implications for the relevance of social network research for members’ adaptation to digital music as well as outlining specific implications for practice...|$|R

40|$|File sharing may {{substantially}} {{undermine the}} {{intellectual property rights}} of digital goods. This paper concentrates on the music industry. I estimate the effect of <b>music</b> <b>downloads</b> on the probability of purchasing music using a European individual-level cross section of 15, 000 people from 2001. A simple comparison of means shows that people who regularly <b>download</b> <b>music</b> <b>online</b> {{are more likely to}} buy music. The positive relationship persists when controlling for observed characteristics. However, simultaneity between tastes for music and peer-to-peer usage makes it difficult to isolate the causal effect of <b>music</b> <b>downloads</b> on <b>music</b> purchases. <b>To</b> break that simultaneity, this paper uses measures of Internet sophistication and the speed of the Internet connection as instruments. The results suggest that peer-to-peer usage reduces the probability of buying music by 30 percent. On the basis of my estimates, back-of-the-envelope calculations indicate that—without downloads—sales in 2002 would have been around 7. 8 percent higher. I...|$|R

50|$|Unlike the iTunes music sharing feature, {{which allows}} {{a maximum of}} five users every 24 hours to connect {{and listen to the}} music of another user who has enabled sharing on a given subnetwork, ourTunes allows users <b>to</b> <b>download</b> <b>music</b> files <b>to</b> their own {{computer}} and provides the functionality to search through the songs from all connected hosts. ourTunes cannot <b>download</b> <b>music</b> purchased from the iTunes Music Store.

On the stand, Thomas-Rasset speculated that maybe her kids or then-boyfriend had installed Kazaa on her computer without her knowledge. Closing arguments focused on the fact that none of the evidence pointed to Thomas-Rasset personally, but only to the IP address assigned to her Internet account.|$|R
