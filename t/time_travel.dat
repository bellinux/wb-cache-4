In When You Reach Me, Marcus helps Miranda {{realize that the}} three old ladies from A Wrinkle in Time lied to Meg by promising they would return five minutes before they left. Marcus explains:"So the garden is where they appear when they get {{home at the end}} of the book. Remember? They land in the broccoli. So if they had gotten home five minutes before they left, like those ladies promised they would, then they would have seen themselves get back. Before they did".|$|E

40|$|A {{negative}} effect of congestion {{that tends to}} be overlooked is <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> uncertainty. <b>Travel</b> <b>time</b> uncertainty causes scheduling costs due to early or late arrival. The {{negative effect}}s of <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> uncertainty can be reduced by providing travellers with <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> information, which improves their estimate of the expected <b>travel</b> <b>time,</b> thereby reducing scheduling costs. In order to assess {{the negative effects of}} uncertainty and the benefits of <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> information, this paper proposes a conceptual model of departure <b>time</b> choice under <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> uncertainty and information. The model is based on expected utility theory, and includes the variation in <b>travel</b> <b>time,</b> the quality of <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> information and travellers’ perception of the <b>travel</b> <b>time.</b> The model is illustrated by an application to the case of the A 2 motorway between Beesd and Utrecht in the Netherland...|$|R

30|$|This paper aims to {{investigate}} the multi-modal shortest path problem, in which both <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> and <b>travel</b> costs are regarded as uncertain variables. Specifically, the <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> includes <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> on the <b>travel</b> arcs and transfer time spent on the mode change. The travel costs consist of cost on each arc and the fixed cost. We intend to formulate a chance-constrained programming model with two objectives minimizing the <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> and <b>travel</b> cost simultaneously. The results of this research will provide a fundamental framework for investigating the shortest path problems with both multi-modes and uncertainty characteristics.|$|R
40|$|The value {{given by}} commuters to the {{variability}} of <b>travel</b> <b>times</b> is empirically analysed using stated preference data from Barcelona (Spain). Respondents are asked to choose between alternatives that differ in terms of cost, average <b>travel</b> <b>time,</b> variability of <b>travel</b> <b>times</b> and departure time. Different specifications of a scheduling choice model are {{used to measure the}} influence of various socioeconomic characteristics. Our results show that <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> variability is valued on average 2. 4 <b>times</b> more than <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> savings.

5|$|The Time Traveler's Wife is {{the debut}} novel of American author Audrey Niffenegger, {{published}} in 2003. It {{is a love}} story about {{a man with a}} genetic disorder that causes him to <b>time</b> <b>travel</b> unpredictably, and about his wife, an artist, who has to cope with his frequent absences and dangerous experiences. Niffenegger, frustrated in love when she began the work, wrote the story as a metaphor for her failed relationships. The tale's central relationship came to her suddenly and subsequently supplied the novel's title. The novel, which has been classified as both science fiction and romance, examines issues of love, loss, and free will. In particular, it uses <b>time</b> <b>travel</b> to explore miscommunication and distance in relationships, while also investigating deeper existential questions.|$|E

5|$|Time Gal is a FMV-based game {{which uses}} {{pre-recorded}} animation rather than sprites {{to display the}} on-screen action. Gameplay is divided into levels, referred to as time periods. The game begins in 4001 AD with the theft of a <b>time</b> <b>travel</b> device. The thief, Luda, steals the device {{to take over the}} world by changing history. Reika, the protagonist also known as Time Gal, uses her own <b>time</b> <b>travel</b> device to pursue him; she travels to different time periods, such as 70,000,000 BC, 44 BC, 1588 AD, and 2010 AD, in search of Luda. Each time period is a scenario which presents a series of threats that must be avoided or confronted. Successfully navigating the sequences allows the player to progress to another period.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the value of}} <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> variability under scheduling preferences that are {{defined in terms of}} linearly time varying utility rates associated with being at the origin and at the destination. The main result is a simple expression for the value of <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> variability that does not depend on the shape of the <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> distribution. The related measure of <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> variability is the variance of <b>travel</b> <b>time.</b> These conclusions apply equally to travellers who can freely choose departure time and to travellers who use a scheduled service with fixed headway. Depending on parameters, travellers may be risk averse or risk seeking and the value of <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> may increase or decrease in the mean <b>travel</b> <b>time.</b> Value of <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> Value of <b>travel</b> <b>time</b> variability Reliability Scheduling preferences...|$|R
