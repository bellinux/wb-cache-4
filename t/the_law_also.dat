5|$|By June 1954, 1.4 {{million acres}} of land had been expropriated and distributed. Approximately 500,000 individuals, or one-sixth of the population, had {{received}} land by this point. The decree also included provision of financial credit {{to the people who}} received the land. The National Agrarian Bank (Banco Nacional Agrario, or BNA) was created on July 7, 1953, and by June 1951 it had disbursed more than $9million in small loans. 53,829 applicants received an average of 225US dollars, which was twice as much as the Guatemalan per capita income. The BNA developed a reputation for being a highly efficient government bureaucracy, and the United States government, Árbenz's biggest detractor, did not have anything negative to say about it. The loans had a high repayment rate, and of the $3,371,185 handed out between March and November 1953, $3,049,092 had been repaid by June 1954. <b>The</b> <b>law</b> <b>also</b> included provisions for nationalization of roads that passed through redistributed land, which greatly increased the connectivity of rural communities.|$|E
5|$|Rather than become president, Noriega {{preferred}} to remain behind the scenes, {{and avoid the}} public scrutiny {{that came with the}} post. He did not have a particular social or economic ideology, and used military nationalism to unify his supporters. The Partido Revolucionario Democrático (Democratic Revolutionary Party, PRD), which had been established by Torrijos, was used by Noriega as a political front for the National Guard. Noriega compelled the Panamanian Congress to pass Law 20, which was supposedly aimed at protecting the Panama Canal from communists, and allowed a huge influx of U.S. weapons to the Panamanian military. <b>The</b> <b>law</b> <b>also</b> tripled the size of the military forces, and gave the National Guard control over immigration, customs, commercial transportation, railroads, and airports. Noriega's period in power saw significant capital flight from Panama; according to Kempe, this was at least in part because wealthy individuals worried their wealth would be seized by Noriega's administration.|$|E

25|$|One subject <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> did {{cover is}} how the king fit within {{the rest of the}} legal system. The king was not {{supposed}} to be above <b>the</b> <b>law.</b> In fact, some stipulations applied specifically to the king. However, as the king was the most powerful individual, and the one with the highest honour in an area, it was difficult to enforce <b>the</b> <b>law</b> against him. Although it might have been possible to proceed against the king as against any other, <b>the</b> <b>laws</b> <b>also</b> had an innovative solution to this quandary. Instead of enforcing against the king directly, a dependent of the king known as an aithech fortha (substitute churl) was enforced against instead, and the king was responsible for repaying the substitute churl. <b>The</b> <b>laws</b> <b>also</b> specified certain cases in which a king lost his honour price. These included doing the work of a commoner, moving around without a retinue, and showing cowardice in battle; again, though, it is unclear how often such stipulations were followed.|$|R

5|$|Starting in 1738, {{towns in}} New Jersey began issuing liquor {{licenses}} to tavern keepers. Before federal Prohibition in 1919, despite many state liquor statutes, {{the regulation of}} alcoholic beverages in New Jersey was almost exclusively local, with wide variations among municipalities. In 1933, after the repeal of Prohibition, the states were again permitted to regulate alcoholic beverages. Immediately upon the end of Prohibition in 1933, New Jersey instituted the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law, which established and granted rulemaking powers to the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control. <b>The</b> <b>law</b> <b>also</b> established a three-tier alcohol distribution system whereby, with minor exceptions, alcohol manufacturers may only sell to wholesalers, who may only sell to retailers, who may only sell to customers.|$|E
5|$|Taking {{as a wife}} an epikleros who {{had little}} estate was {{considered}} a praiseworthy action, and was generally stressed in public speeches. Such an heiress was called an epikleros thessa. If the nearest male relative {{did not wish to}} marry an epikleros who belonged to the lowest income class in Athens, he was required to find her a husband and provide her with a dowry on a graduated scale according to his own income class. This dowry was in addition to her own property and the requirement was designed to ensure that even poor heiresses found husbands. <b>The</b> <b>law</b> <b>also</b> did not stipulate what was to happen if the epikleros was still an infant or too young for consummation of the marriage when she was claimed.|$|E
5|$|The ACA {{includes}} {{provisions to}} take effect between 2010 and 2020, although most took effect on January 1, 2014. Few areas of the US health care system were left untouched, making it the most sweeping health care reform since the enactment of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965. However, some areas were more affected than others. The individual insurance market was radically overhauled, {{and many of the}} law's regulations applied specifically to this market, while the structure of Medicare, Medicaid, and the employer market were largely retained. Most of the coverage gains were made through the expansion of Medicaid, and the biggest cost savings were made in Medicare. Some regulations applied to the employer market, and <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>also</b> made delivery system changes that affected most of the health care system. Not all provisions took full effect. Some were made discretionary, some were deferred, and others were repealed before implementation.|$|E

5|$|The ACA's major {{provisions}} {{came into}} force in 2014. By 2016, the uninsured {{share of the}} population had roughly halved, with estimates ranging from 20–24 million additional people covered during 2016. The increased coverage was due, roughly equally, to an expansion of Medicaid eligibility and to major changes to individual insurance markets. Both involved new spending, funded {{through a combination of}} new taxes and cuts to Medicare provider rates and Medicare Advantage. Several Congressional Budget Office reports said that overall these provisions reduced the budget deficit, and that repealing the ACA would increase the deficit. <b>The</b> <b>law</b> <b>also</b> enacted a host of delivery system reforms intended to constrain healthcare costs and improve quality. After the law went into effect, increases in overall healthcare spending slowed, including premiums for employer-based insurance plans.|$|E
5|$|The Illinois Board of State Park Advisers was {{established}} under a 1925 state law. The law, which was amended in 1931, gave {{the director of}} the Illinois Department of Public Works jurisdiction over the state parks. The Public Works position was a result of 1917 reforms by Governor Frank Lowden. <b>The</b> <b>law</b> <b>also</b> mandated a system of state parks, under the Illinois Department of Conservation, later renamed the Illinois Department of Natural Resources. Per the 1925 mandate, White Pines Forest became a state park in 1927 after its proponents enlisted the support of the Chicago Tribune and WGN Radio. That year, Governor Len Small moved to purchase White Pines for $63,949.|$|E
5|$|Both Houses of Congress were majority-Republican, {{but their}} {{solutions}} differed. The House {{passed a bill}} in June 1890 requiring the government to purchase 4.5 million ounces of silver each month (in addition to the $2– $4 million required to be coined under Bland–Allison). The Senate passed a bill by Republican Preston B. Plumb of Kansas for free coinage of silver at the legal (16:1) ratio. Sherman voted against Plumb's bill, but {{was appointed to the}} conference committee to produce a compromise bill that, now called the Sherman Silver Purchase Act, passed that July. The Treasury would buy 4.5 million ounces of silver and would issue Treasury Notes to pay for it, which would be redeemable in gold or silver. <b>The</b> <b>law</b> <b>also</b> provided that the Treasury could coin more silver dollars if the Secretary believed it necessary to redeem the new notes. Sherman thought the bill was the least harmful option. Harrison believed it would end the controversy, and he signed it into law. The effect of the bill, however, was the increased depletion of the nation's gold supply.|$|E

5|$|Following the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, {{led by the}} Free Officers Movement of Muhammad Naguib and Gamal Abdel Nasser, {{in which}} the Egyptian monarchy was overthrown, the {{university}} began {{to be separated from}} the mosque. A number of properties that surrounded the mosque were acquired and demolished to provide space for a modern campus by 1955. The mosque itself would no longer serve as a school, and the college was officially designated a university in 1961. The 1961 law separated the dual roles of the educational institution and the religious institution which made judgments heeded throughout the Muslim world. <b>The</b> <b>law</b> <b>also</b> created secular departments within al-Azhar, such as colleges of medicine, engineering, and economics, furthering the efforts at modernization first seen following the French occupation. The reforms of the curriculum have led to a massive {{growth in the number of}} Egyptian students attending al-Azhar run schools, specifically youths attending primary and secondary schools within the al-Azhar system. The number of students reported to attend al-Azhar primary and secondary schools increased from under 90,000 in 1970 to 300,000 in the early in 1980s, up to nearly one million in the early 1990s, and exceeding 1.3 million students in 2001.|$|E
5|$|His fourth {{minister}} of economy, Domingo Cavallo, was appointed in 1991. He deepened the neoliberal reforms. The Convertibility plan was {{sanctioned by the}} Congress, setting a one-to-one fixed exchange rate between the United States dollar and the new Argentine peso, which replaced the Austral. <b>The</b> <b>law</b> <b>also</b> limited public expenditures, but this was frequently ignored. There was increased free trade to reduce inflation, and high taxes on sales and earnings {{to reduce the deficit}} caused by it. Initially, the plan was a success: the capital flights ended, interest and inflation rates were lowered, and economic activity increased. The money from privatizations allowed Argentina to repurchase many of the Brady Bonds issued during the crisis. The privatizations of electricity, water, and gas were more successful than previous ones. YPF, the national oil refinery, was privatized as well, but the state kept {{a good portion of the}} shares. The project to privatize the pension funds was resisted in Congress, and was approved as a mixed system that allowed both public and private options for workers.
