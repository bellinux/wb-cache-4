As companies strive to rationalize engineering design, manufacturing and maintain processes, modularity is becoming a priority. Component swapping modularity in control systems can be achieved by utilizing “smart ” components which can perform control actions within the module, and bidirectional network communication. In this paper we analyze an engine speed control system from the perspective of achieving swapping modularity of the <b>throttle</b> <b>actuator.</b> Specifically, we analyze approaches to distribute the optimal controller transfer function between a <b>throttle</b> <b>actuator</b> time constant dependent portion (which is swappable with the actuator) and <b>throttle</b> <b>actuator</b> time constant independent portion (which {{does not need to be}} changed when the actuator is swapped).

40|$|Downsizing and {{turbocharging}} {{is one way}} to {{meet the}} high demands on fuel consumptionand performance on todays engines. The air-path system in a turbochargedspark ignited engine is a complex system and because the intake manifoldpressure is tightly connected with the engine torque a consistent and robustcontrol is needed. The control strategy utilizes two control loops, one wastegateactuator to control the intercooler pressure and one <b>throttle</b> <b>actuator</b> to controlthe intake manifold pressure. These pressures are coupled, making both actuatorsaffect both pressures. Because of the time delay and the dynamics in the actuatorsand the system dynamics between the wastegate and the intercooler pressure thecontroller overreacts causing a pressure overshoot and sometimes oscillations. Theoscillatory behavior is caused by both actuators trying to minimize their respectivecontrol error, affecting the others pressure. The delay in the system dynamicscauses the two controllers to enter a state where they counteract each other. A compensation strategy is suggested, which estimates the intercooler pressurederivative and uses that to predict the future intercooler pressure. The compensationstrategy shows good performance in simulations, reducing the overshoots andeliminating the oscillations...|$|E

40|$|In this work, an observer-based {{controller}} for {{an internal}} combustion engine is presented. At first, an algorithm for the estimation of an unknown function of the {{internal combustion engine}} is designed, since {{it is very difficult to}} obtain direct measurements of this variable. This estimator is based on sliding mode algorithms, providing a finite time and robust estimation, using only measurements from the velocity of the engine. On the other hand, with the measured velocity and the estimates of the other variables, a robust controller is synthesized for the engine. In order to considerate the actuator dynamics, the proposed control scheme is based on the master-slave structure, regarding the controller for the actuator as the slave one. For this scheme, the backstepping algorithm is used to design the master controller. Then, the calculated control input signal to the engine is used as a reference for the <b>throttle</b> <b>actuator</b> which is driven by a direct current (DC) motor.

40|$|As {{industry}} {{strives to}} standardize engineering design, manufacturing, and maintenance processes, {{the focus on}} achieving component modularity is increasing. Component swapping modularity (CSM) in control systems allows component change without redesign of the system level controller, while achieving the required system performance. Opportunities to achieve CSM are emerging in control systems consisting of smart components connected by bidirectional communication networks. By distributing {{a part of the}} controller into the component module, controller recalibration can be limited to only the component module when the component changes. In this dissertation, a novel Direct Method is proposed to generate the distributed controller with CSM through a bi-level optimization. The distributed controller enables CSM and provides required system performance for each component variant. The Direct Method is applied to <b>throttle</b> <b>actuator</b> CSM design in engine idle speed control. The results demonstrate that the new Direct Method improves the CSM results compared to the previous 3 -Step Method. In addition, the Direct Method permits the designer to trade off desired system performance versus achievable CSM. The Direct Method is then applied to design a distributed supervisory controller for battery CSM in plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. A novel feedback based controller for the charge sustaining mode is proposed. For effective controller distribution, a method based on sensitivity analysis of the control signals with respect to the battery hardware parameter is introduced. The bi-level optimization problem for the distributed controller gains is solved using the Augmented Lagrangian Decomposition method. The results demonstrate that battery CSM can be achieved without compromising fuel economy compared to the centralized control case...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} {{understanding}} {{the use of}} air injection {{as a means of}} controlling rotating stall in an axial flow compressor, involving modeling, dynamical systems analysis, and experimental investigations. The first step towards this understanding was the development of a low order model for air injection control, the starting point of which was the Moore and Greitzer model for axial flow compressors. The Moore and Greitzer model was extended to include the effects of air injection and bifurcation analysis was performed to determine how the closed loop system dynamics are {{different from those of the}} open loop system. This low order model was then used to determine the optimal placement of the air injection actuators. Experimental work focused on verifying that the low order model, developed for air injection actuation, qualitatively captured the behavior of the Caltech compressor rig. Open loop tests were performed to determine how the placement of the air injectors on the rig affected the performance of the compressor. The positioning of the air injectors that provided the greatest control authority were used in the development of air injection controllers for rotating stall. The controllers resulted in complete elimination of the hysteresis associated with rotating stall. The use of a <b>throttle</b> <b>actuator</b> for the control of the surge dynamics was investigated, and then combined with an air injection controller for rotating stall; the resulting controller performed quite well in throttle disturbance rejection tests. A higher order model was developed to qualitatively match the experimental results with a simulation. The results of this modeling effort compared quite well with the experimental results for the open loop behavior of the Caltech rig. The details of how the air injection actuators affect the compressor flow were included in this model, and the simulation predicted the same optimal controller that was developed through experimentation. The development of the higher order model also included the investigation of systematic methods for determining the simulation parameters. Based on experimental measurements of compression system transients, the open loop simulation parameters were identified, including values for the compressor performance characteristic in regions where direct measurements were not possible. These methods also provided information on parameters used in the modeling of the pressure rise delivered by the compressor under unsteady flow conditions...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about the {{adaptive}} control of time delay systems with applications to automotive control problems. The stabilization of systems involving time delays is a difficult problem since {{the existence of a}} delay may induce instability or poor performance for the closed loop system. A unique approach for controlling systems with known time delay was originated by Otto Smith in the 1950 s by compensating for the delayed output using input values stored over a time window of [t - [tau], t] and estimating the plant output using a model of the plant. Later, this idea was extended to include unstable plants as well, using finite-time integrals of the delayed input values thereby avoiding unstable pole-zero cancellations that may occur in Smith's controller. Adaptive versions of these delay compensating controllers were also developed with rather complicated adaptive rules which might not be practical to use in real applications. In this thesis, a simpler adaptive version of delay compensating controllers is developed, which has adaptive rules that are easily implementable and thus suitable for real life implementations. The developed controller is tested in two important automotive control problems that are idle speed control (ISC) and fuel-to-air ratio (FAR) control. These two applications, ISC and FAR control, constitute the experimental part of this research. In ISC, the objective is to regulate the engine speed to a prescribed set-point in the presence of accessory load torque disturbances such as due to air conditioning and power steering. The adaptive controller, integrated with the existing proportional spark controller, is used to drive the electronic <b>throttle</b> <b>actuator.</b> Both simulation and experimental results demonstrating the performance improvement by employing the adaptive controller are presented. Modifications and improvements to the controller structure, which were developed during the course of experimentation to solve specific problems, are also presented. In addition, the potential for the reduction in calibration time and effort which can be achieved with our approach is discussed. (cont.) The objective in FAR control is to maintain the in-cylinder FAR at a prescribed set point, determined primarily by the state of the Three-Way Catalyst (TWC), so that the pollutants in the exhaust are removed with the highest efficiency. The FAR controller must also reject disturbances due to canister vapor purge and inaccuracies in air charge estimation and wall-wetting (WW) compensation. Two adaptive controller designs are considered. The first design is based on feedforward adaptation while the second design is based on both feedback and feedforward adaptation. Both simulation and experimental results demonstrating the performance improvement by employing the APC are presented. In addition, modifications and improvements to the APC structure, which were developed {{during the course of the}} experiments, to solve specific implementation problems are presented. by Yildiray Yildiz.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Aerospace Engineering. This thesis {{documents}} {{the development of}} an adaptive controller designed to control the elastic aircraft dynamics of a generic general aviation aircraft. The elastic aircraft equations of motion are derived using Lagrange’s equation and the principal of virtual work. A minimum kinetic energy axis system is chosen as the body reference axis, which results in structural equations of motion that are decoupled from the rigid body equations of motion. An aerodynamic strip method is utilized to develop closed-form expressions for the longitudinal generalized structural forces. The adaptive controller is designed using a model reference adaptive control scheme, modified for general aviation to use an “E-Z fly” decoupled control architecture, which tracks vertical flight path angle and true airspeed. The adaptive control signal is computed using a weighted least mean square optimization, which gives the control designer more influence on the behavior of the adaptation. A notch filter is designed to decouple the controller and adaptation from the structural modes. The controller is implemented in the MATLAB®/Simulink® environment, and the equations of motion are integrated in simulation for a range of structural flexibility and plant failures. Results show that the controller is capable of handling the uncertainties associated with unmodeled aeroelastic modes. Additionally, the controller shows resilience to “A” and “B” matrix failures, such as 25 % loss in elevator and <b>throttle</b> effectiveness. <b>Actuator</b> speed is found to limit the amount of failure the system can recover from, where a fast actuator facilitates adaptation to much larger failures. The notch filter is shown to be successful at decoupling the controller from the structural modes, even for a highly flexible aircraft. Performance without the notch filter is not degraded when the structural modes are outside the controller bandwidth; however, when structural modes fall within the controller bandwidth, the notch filter is required to damp excessive control activity. The proposed controller shows balance between good tracking performance and time delay margin, which is a measure of robustness in the system. This is attributed to the weighted least mean square optimization procedure that gives the control designer more influence over the behavior of the adaption...|$|R

Hydraulic servo-systems will only become more ubiquitous as demands for increased performance, faster production, tighter tolerances and more efficient operation continue to become more stringent. There is a need for energy-efficient hydraulic systems which can deliver the high performance control required in today’s society. ^ In this thesis, the technologies of independent metering valves, cross-port regeneration and accumulator-based energy recovery systems and the reasons why they are able to boost the efficiency of hydraulic systems are discussed. A control methodology including low-level adaptive robust control (ARC) of the flow rates and high-level decision logic is presented for simultaneously achieving high performance and energy-efficient operation for hydraulic systems with these features. ^ An experimental setup consisting of a scaled-down hydraulic excavator arm is used as a case study. Model parameters are identified and a correlated system model for the swing motion is presented. This system is then used to illustrate the control design procedure. The ARC algorithm is quite flexible and is applied without major modification to systems using four different valve configurations. A systematic method is proposed for selecting the controller gains to reduce the amount of trial and error required for this task. ^ The ARC algorithm guarantees high performance motion control even in the presence of uncertainties and disturbances by combining adjustable nonlinear model compensation with robust feedback. The model compensation is adjusted by controlled parameter adaptation. The high-level logic selects the most efficient way to implement the flow rates determined by the ARC algorithm and also determines the pressure level at which the system can operate most efficiently. ^ Simulation results are presented which demonstrate the ability to achieve both precision motion control and increase energy efficiency using the proposed control strategy. These results clearly show the operation and benefits of independent metering, cross-port regeneration and energy recovery. ^ Experimental results were obtained for one of the valve configurations studied. The tracking performance achieved demonstrates the effectiveness of the control algorithm. Additional experimental results are still needed to confirm that the energy efficiency predicted by the simulations can be achieved without loss of performance in practice. ^ The addition of an energy recovery accumulator to a system with an under-utilized constant pressure source can allow the system to approach the efficiency which would be obtained by using a load-sensing pump. There is potential for increased efficiency by using a central energy recovery accumulator on systems with multiple actuators, since the accumulator is able to recover energy normally lost to <b>throttling</b> for <b>actuators</b> with widelyvarying pressure requirements. ...|$|R
