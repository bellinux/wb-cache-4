5|$|On Lake Champlain, Benedict Arnold {{ordered the}} {{construction}} of 12 Navy vessels <b>to</b> <b>slow</b> <b>down</b> the British fleet that was invading New York from Canada. The British fleet did destroy Arnold's fleet, but the U.S. fleet managed <b>to</b> <b>slow</b> <b>down</b> the British after a two-day battle, known as the Battle of Valcour Island, and managed to slow the progression of the British Army. By mid-1776, a number of ships, ranging {{up to and including}} the thirteen frigates approved by Congress, were under construction, but their effectiveness was limited; they were completely outmatched by the mighty Royal Navy, and nearly all were captured or sunk by 1781.|$|E

5|$|In Belgium, {{the growth}} of the {{religion}} quickly begin <b>to</b> <b>slow</b> <b>down,</b> even to decline, as indicated by the fact that no temple has been built since 1968 and that several of them are currently unused {{because of a lack of}} dressed members and/or money. In contrast, the constructions of the temples in France has been continued until 1993, when a new temple in Toulouse was opened.|$|E
5|$|In many organisms, inhibitors may act {{as part of}} a {{feedback}} mechanism. If {{an enzyme}} produces too much of one substance in the organism, that substance may act as an inhibitor for the enzyme {{at the beginning of the}} pathway that produces it, causing production of the substance <b>to</b> <b>slow</b> <b>down</b> or stop when there is sufficient amount. This is a form of negative feedback. Major metabolic pathways such as the citric acid cycle make use of this mechanism.|$|E
5|$|Ranking Democratic {{committee}} member Patrick Leahy objected to Republican {{use of a}} secret hold <b>to</b> <b>slow</b> <b>down</b> the Sotomayor nomination, and Leahy attributed that anonymous tactic to GOP reticence about publicly opposing a female Hispanic nominee. The prior month, Leahy had triggered a procedural delay in the confirmation of fellow Second Circuit nominee Chester J. Straub—who, although advanced by Clinton and supported by Senator Moynihan, was considered much more acceptable by Republicans—in an unsuccessful effort to force earlier consideration of the Sotomayor confirmation.|$|E
50|$|Since the 1980s {{the number}} of educated Americans has {{continued}} to grow, but at a slower rate. Some have attributed this {{to an increase in}} the foreign born portion of the workforce. However, the decreasing growth of the educational workforce has instead been primarily due <b>to</b> <b>slowing</b> <b>down</b> in educational attainment of people schooled in the United States.|$|R

5|$|St. Leger's {{artillery}} {{was held}} up by a tactic that was also used <b>to</b> <b>slow</b> <b>down</b> Burgoyne's army {{after the fall of}} Ticonderoga: Gansevoort and his men had systematically felled trees across the wooded track the expedition came down, and St. Leger needed to clear the track to make way for his artillery. This work occupied all but 250 of St. Leger's white men, with the actual encirclement of the fort dominated by Indians.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} of prion replication {{has implications for}} designing drugs. Since the incubation period of prion diseases is so long, an effective drug {{does not need to}} eliminate all prions, but simply needs <b>to</b> <b>slow</b> <b>down</b> the rate of exponential growth. Models predict that {{the most effective way to}} achieve this, using a drug with the lowest possible dose, is to find a drug that binds to fibril ends and blocks them from growing any further.|$|E
5|$|At dawn on 25 March, while {{crossing}} the Tyrrhenian Sea, the French squadron was spotted, having {{been reduced to}} ten ships by a storm the previous night. Ganteaume turned his ships to the south-east and Warren gave chase. Gibraltar and Athenienne began to lag behind, and Warren, fearing his force would become fragmented, ordered his faster ships <b>to</b> <b>slow</b> <b>down.</b> The French were thus able to escape into the night, the British continuing on a south-east course while they quietly turned north, back to Toulon.|$|E

Whiting's brief reply maintained that no such change would be permitted, and gave the teams the choice of limiting speeds through Turn 13, using tyres of a different specification to those used in qualifying, subject to a penalty, or changing tyres repeatedly, which would have been permitted if a driver's safety were at issue.|$|E

5|$|Laguna Canyon and {{its side}} tributaries have {{received}} some flood control modifications. These include debris basins {{at the mouth}} of nearly every major tributary, stretches of lined or unlined flood control channels, and other structures. The debris basins, sometimes called retention basins, are circular depressions constructed by the Orange County Flood Control Division <b>to</b> <b>slow</b> <b>down</b> flash floods. The upper Laguna Canyon area has a few flood control channels and the lower creek is encased entirely in one; this begins as a riprap channel with an unlined bottom, which transitions to a concrete culvert. These improvements help to protect infrastructure in the canyon from storm and landslide damage.|$|E

A month later, on November 28, Sweden and Poland made peace in the Treaty of Warsaw through the Warsaw Confederation which {{increased}} Sweden's position even further.

5|$|Some of this retreat has {{resulted}} in efforts <b>to</b> <b>slow</b> <b>down</b> the loss of glaciers in the Alps.

While covering glaciers with plastic sheeting may prove advantageous to ski resorts on a small scale, this practice is not expected to be economically practical on a much larger scale.|$|E
5|$|The Allied {{army had}} been {{advancing}} on the Argentinian capital of Buenos Aires by land, while the Brazilian Army commanded by Caxias planned a supporting attack by sea. On 29 January at the Battle of Alvarez Field the Allied vanguard defeated {{a force of}} 4,000 Argentines led by two colonels which General Ángel Pacheco had sent <b>to</b> <b>slow</b> <b>down</b> the advance. Pacheco retreated. Two days later, troops under his personal command were defeated at the Battle of Marques Bridge by two allied divisions. On 1 February 1852, the Allied troops encamped approximately nine kilometers from Buenos Aires. The next day a brief skirmish between the vanguards of both armies ended with a retreat by the Argentines.|$|E
5|$|The passenger-only ferry service, {{approved}} by voters in 2016, {{was preceded by}} one operated by Washington State Ferries between 1986 and 2003.

Kitsap Transit briefly operated its own passenger ferries from 2004 to 2007, but failed to receive voter approval for two sales tax funding measures.
