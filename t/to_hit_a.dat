5|$|British Open Championship Golf is a {{three-dimensional}} (3D) video game that simulates golf, a sport in which players attempt <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> ball {{into a hole}} with as few strokes as possible. In particular, the game is based on The Open Championship, the oldest tournament in golf. The player may compete as a pre- or self-created amateur golfer or as one of eight celebrity athletes, including Sandy Lyle, Vijay Singh and Ian Baker-Finch. Three modes of play—Practice, Match and Tournament—are available. Practice and Match are non-binding preparatory modes: the former allows the player to practice each hole of a course, and the latter engages the player in a pre-tournament match of stroke play, match play or fourball. In the Tournament mode, the player competes in The Open Championship, which consists of four 18-hole matches.|$|E
5|$|Hearts {{started the}} match as the {{brighter}} {{of the two}} teams. Rudi Skácel headed wide early on from an Andrew Driver cross.

Skácel then doubled Hearts' lead after receiving {{the ball on the}} edge of the area and turning <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> shot which deflected off James McPake before going in. Hibs then had an opportunity as Kujabi's cross came to Garry O'Connor, but he hit his shot over the bar. McPake then made a goal-line clearance from a Suso shot which had beaten Hibs' keeper Mark Brown. McPake got Hibs back into the game from a corner. Tom Soares' initial delivery was cleared but he got the ball back out on the wing and put in a low cross which McPake converted.|$|E

According to {{newspaper}} reports, Ruth had promised a sickly boy named Johnny Sylvester <b>to</b> <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> home run for him in Game4. After Ruth's three-homer game, the boy's condition miraculously improved.
