50|$|A {{recently}} discovered characteristic of one population {{of this species}} is that it uses stones {{as a tool to}} open hard nuts. First it chooses ripe nuts from a nut palm. It uses its teeth to strip off <b>the</b> <b>nut's</b> fibrous husk. Then it leaves <b>the</b> <b>nut</b> to dry for about a week. When <b>the</b> <b>nut</b> is dry, <b>the</b> monkey lays <b>the</b> <b>nut</b> on a large, flat rock or fallen tree, hammering <b>the</b> <b>nut</b> with a suitable stone until <b>the</b> <b>nut</b> cracks. <b>The</b> hammer stones are often large enough to require lifting with both hands. The anvil rock is often pock-marked with hollows as a result of repeated use.|$|R

5|$|Evidence of {{large-scale}} Mesolithic nut processing, radiocarbon dated to circa 7000BC, {{has been found}} in a midden pit at Staosnaig on Colonsay. The dig discovered the remains {{of hundreds of thousands of}} burned hazelnut shells and gives an insight into communal activity and forward planning in the period. <b>The</b> <b>nuts</b> were harvested in a single year and pollen analysis suggests that the hazel trees were all cut down at the same time. The scale of the activity, unparalleled elsewhere in Scotland, and the lack of large game on the island, suggests the possibility that Colonsay contained a community with a largely vegetarian diet for the time they spent on the island.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{nothing is}} known about the {{behaviour}} of Newton's parakeet, but it is probable that it was similar to that of other members of its genus. Leguat mentioned that the parrots of the island ate <b>the</b> <b>nuts</b> of the bois d'olive tree (Cassine orientalis). Tafforet also stated that the parrots ate the seeds of the bois de buis shrub (Fernelia buxifolia), which is endangered today, but was common all over Rodrigues and nearby islets during his visit. Newton's parakeet may have fed on leaves as the related echo parakeet does. The fact that it survived long after Rodrigues had been heavily deforested shows that its ecology was less vulnerable than that of, for example, the Rodrigues parrot.|$|E
5|$|Galenas keel {{was laid}} down by Maxson, Fish & Co. in 1861 and she was {{launched}} on 14 February 1862. The ship was commissioned on 21 April 1862 with Commander Alfred Taylor in command. Galena arrived in Hampton Roads on 24 April, after having suffered several engine breakdowns en route, and was assigned to Flag Officer L.M. Goldsborough's North Atlantic Blockading Squadron. Commander John Rodgers relieved Taylor the same day. When Goldsborough inspected the ship shortly after her arrival he ordered that her spars be cut away and <b>the</b> <b>nuts</b> {{on the inside of}} her hull to be covered with sheet iron to prevent them from breaking loose when the ship was hit.|$|E
40|$|A {{composite}} nut {{is shown}} which permits a fastener to be inserted or removed {{from either side}} with an indicator of fastener engagement. <b>The</b> <b>nut</b> has a plurality of segments, preferably at least three segments, which are internally threaded, spring loaded apart by an internal spring, and has detents on opposite sides which force <b>the</b> <b>nut</b> segments into operative engagements with a threaded member when pushed in and release the segments for quick insertion or removal of <b>the</b> <b>nut</b> when moved out. When <b>the</b> <b>nut</b> is installed, end pressure {{on one of the}} detents presses <b>the</b> <b>nut</b> segments into operative engagement with a threaded member where continued rotation locks the structure together with the detents depressed to indicate positive locking engagement of <b>the</b> <b>nut.</b> On removal, counterclockwise rotation of <b>the</b> <b>nut</b> relieves <b>the</b> endwise pressure on the detents, permitting internal springs to force the detents outward and allowing <b>the</b> <b>nut</b> segments to move outward and separate to permit quick removal of the fastener...|$|R

5|$|The Tale of Timmy Tiptoes is a children's {{book written}} and {{illustrated}} by Beatrix Potter, and published by Frederick Warne & Co. in October 1911. Timmy Tiptoes is a squirrel believed to be a nut-thief by his fellows, and imprisoned by them in a hollow tree with the expectation that he will confess under confinement. Timmy is tended by Chippy Hackee, a friendly, mischievous chipmunk who has run away from his wife and is camping-out in the tree. Chippy urges the prisoner to eat <b>the</b> <b>nuts</b> stored in the tree, and Timmy does so but grows so fat he cannot escape the tree. He regains his freedom when a storm topples part of the tree. The tale contrasts the harmonious marriage of its title character with the less than harmonious marriage of the chipmunk.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{counties}} were re-established in 1992, Croatia {{is divided into}} 20 counties and {{the capital city of}} Zagreb, the latter having the authority and legal status of a county and a city at the same time. Borders of {{the counties}} changed in some instances since, with the latest revision taking place in 2006. The counties subdivide into 127 cities and 429 municipalities. Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) division of Croatia is performed in several tiers. NUTS 1 level places the entire country in a single unit, while there are three NUTS 2 regions. Those are Northwest Croatia, Central and Eastern (Pannonian) Croatia and Adriatic Croatia.

50|$|A {{serrated}} face nut is a locknut with ridges on {{the face}} of <b>the</b> <b>nut</b> that bite into the surface it is tightened against. The serrations are angled such that they keep <b>the</b> <b>nut</b> from rotating in the direction that would loosen <b>the</b> <b>nut.</b> Due to <b>the</b> serrations they cannot be used with a washer or on surfaces that cannot be scratched.

25|$|Hickories {{provide food}} to {{many kinds of}} {{wildlife}} (8,13). <b>The</b> <b>nuts</b> are relished by several species of squirrel and represent an estimated 10 to 25 percent of their diet. Nuts and flowers are eaten by the wild turkey and several species of songbirds. Nuts and bark are eaten by black bears, foxes, rabbits, and raccoons. Small mammals eat <b>the</b> <b>nuts</b> and leaves; 5 to 10 percent of the diet of eastern chipmunks is hickory nuts. White-tailed deer occasionally browse hickory leaves, twigs, and nuts.|$|E
50|$|In normal use, a nut-and-bolt joint holds {{together}} because the bolt {{is under a}} constant tensile stress called the preload. The preload pulls <b>the</b> <b>nut</b> threads against <b>the</b> bolt threads, and <b>the</b> <b>nut</b> face against <b>the</b> bearing surface, with a constant force, so that <b>the</b> <b>nut</b> cannot rotate without overcoming the friction between these surfaces. If the joint is subjected to vibration, however, the preload increases and decreases with each cycle of movement. If the minimum preload during the vibration cycle {{is not enough to}} hold <b>the</b> <b>nut</b> firmly in contact with the bolt and the bearing surface, then <b>the</b> <b>nut</b> is likely to become loose.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>nut</b> {{and screw}} have {{identical}} multiple-start threads.

The spacer rings, which rotate within the ring gears, have equidistant holes {{that act as}} rotary bearings for the smooth pivot ends (studs) of the rollers. The ring gears time the spinning and orbit of the rollers about the screw axis by engaging gear teeth near {{the ends of the}} rollers. The spacer rings rotate on axis with the screw in unison with the orbit of the rollers. The spacer rings float relative to <b>the</b> <b>nut,</b> axially secured by retaining rings, because they spin around the screw at a lower frequency (angular velocity) than <b>the</b> <b>nut.</b>|$|R

25|$|A joint {{investigation}} by the Russian Interstate Aviation Committee, aircraft manufacturer, engine manufacturer and Azerbaijani Ministry of National Security was launched.
