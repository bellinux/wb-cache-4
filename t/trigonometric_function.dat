500|$|For {{the first}} few months after its installation, the PDP-1 {{programming}} community at MIT focused on simpler programs to work out how to create software for the computer. The community had heard of the Spacewar concept, however, and understood that Russell would spearhead the development of it. [...] When members of the community began to feel the time was right to start work on the game, Russell, nicknamed [...] "Slug" [...] because of his tendency to procrastinate, began providing various excuses as to why he could not start programming the game. One of these was the lack of a <b>trigonometric</b> <b>function</b> routine needed to calculate the trajectories of the spacecraft. This prompted Alan Kotok of TMRC to call DEC, who informed him that they had such a routine already written. Kotok drove to DEC to pick up a tape containing the code, slammed it down in front of Russell, and asked what other excuses he had. Russell, later explaining that [...] "I looked around and I didn't find an excuse, so I had to settle down and do some figuring," [...] started writing the code in December 1961. The game was developed to meet three precepts Russell, Graetz, and Wiitanen had developed for creating a program that functioned equally well as an entertainment experience for the players and as a demonstration for spectators: to use as much of the computer's resources as possible, to be consistently interesting and therefore have every run be different, and to be entertaining and therefore a game. It took Russell, with assistance from the other programmers—including Bob Saunders and Steve Piner (but not Wiitanen, who had been called up by the United States Army Reserve)—about 200 man-hours to write the first version of Spacewar, around six weeks to develop the basic game.|$|E

2500|$|Even the [...] "exact" [...] FFT {{algorithms}} have errors when finite-precision floating-point arithmetic is used, {{but these}} errors are typically quite small; most FFT algorithms, e.g. Cooley–Tukey, have excellent numerical properties {{as a consequence}} of the pairwise summation structure of the algorithms. [...] The upper bound on the relative error for the Cooley–Tukey algorithm is O(ε log N), compared to O(εN3/2) for the naïve DFT formula, where ε is the machine floating-point relative precision. In fact, the root mean square (rms) errors are much better than these upper bounds, being only O(ε √log N) for Cooley–Tukey and O(ε √N) for the naïve DFT (Schatzman, 1996). These results, however, are very sensitive to the accuracy of the twiddle factors used in the FFT (i.e. the <b>trigonometric</b> <b>function</b> values), and it is not unusual for incautious FFT implementations to have much worse accuracy, e.g. if they use inaccurate trigonometric recurrence formulas. Some FFTs other than Cooley–Tukey, such as the Rader–Brenner algorithm, are intrinsically less stable.|$|E
