5|$|Ford seriously {{considered}} leaving <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>and</b> {{running for governor}} again in 1983 and 1991, but decided against it both times. In the 1983 contest, he would have faced sitting lieutenant governor Martha Layne Collins in the primary. Collins was a factional ally of Ford's, which influenced his decision. In 1991, Ford cited his seniority in <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>and</b> desire to become Democratic Senate whip as factors in his decision not to run for governor.|$|E
5|$|During his campaign, Trajan {{was granted}} the title Parthicus by <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>and</b> coins were minted proclaiming {{the conquest of}} Parthia.

5|$|Kennedy's role as {{a liberal}} lion in the Senate {{came to the fore}} in 1995, when the Republican Revolution took control and {{legislation}} intending to fulfill the Contract with America was coming from Newt Gingrich's House of Representatives. Many Democrats in <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>and</b> the country overall felt depressed but Kennedy rallied forces to combat the Republicans. By the beginning of 1996, the Republicans had overreached; most of the Contract had failed to pass <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>and</b> the Democrats could once again move forward with legislation, almost all of it coming out of Kennedy's staff.|$|E

5|$|Marking Specter's {{entire career}} in <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>and,</b> indeed, {{in all his}} public offices was one {{overriding}} fact: First and foremost, he considered himself essentially a trial attorney rather than a professional politician.

5|$|The {{order of}} sejm {{proceedings}} was formalized in the 17th century. The lower chamber would {{do most of}} the statute preparation work. The last several days were spent working together with <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>and</b> the king, when the final versions were agreed upon and decisions made; the finished legislative product had to have the consent of all three legislating estates of the realm, the Sejm, <b>the</b> <b>Senate,</b> <b>and</b> the monarch. The lower chamber's rule of unanimity had not been rigorously enforced {{during the first half of}} the 17th century.|$|E

5|$|After Actium and {{the defeat}} of Antony and Cleopatra, Octavian was in a {{position}} to rule the entire Republic under an unofficial principateâ€”but he had to achieve this through incremental power gains. He did so by courting <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>and</b> the people while upholding the republican traditions of Rome, appearing that he was not aspiring to dictatorship or monarchy. Marching into Rome, Octavian and Marcus Agrippa were elected as dual consuls by the Senate.|$|E
5|$|Although {{he made no}} pretence {{regarding}} {{the significance of the}} Senate under his absolute rule, those senators he deemed unworthy were expelled from <b>the</b> <b>Senate,</b> <b>and</b> in the distribution of public offices he rarely favoured family members; a policy that stood in contrast to the nepotism practiced by Vespasian and Titus. Above all, however, Domitian valued loyalty and malleability in those he assigned to strategic posts, qualities he found more often in men of the equestrian order than in members of the Senate or his own family, whom he regarded with suspicion, and promptly removed from office if they disagreed with imperial policy.|$|E

5|$|As {{the only}} member from a seceded state to remain in <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>and</b> the most {{prominent}} Southern Unionist, Johnson had Lincoln's ear {{in the early months}} of the war.

5|$|Bonaparte {{restored}} Lafayette's citizenship on 1 March 1800, and he {{was able}} to recover some of his properties. The ruler offered to make Lafayette minister to the United States, but was met with a firm refusal, as Lafayette would not have anything to do with Napoleon's government. In 1802, Lafayette was part of the tiny minority that voted no in the referendum that made Bonaparte consul for life. Bonaparte offered to appoint Lafayette to <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>and</b> to bestow the Legion of Honor upon him, but Lafayette declined, though he stated he would gladly have taken the honors from a democratic government.|$|E
