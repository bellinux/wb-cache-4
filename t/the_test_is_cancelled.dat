50|$|Project SHAD, {{an acronym}} for Shipboard Hazard and Defense (or {{sometimes}} Decontamination), {{was part of a}} larger effort called Project 112, which was conducted during the 1960s. Project SHAD encompassed tests designed to identify U.S. warships' vulnerabilities to attacks with chemical or biological warfare agents and to develop procedures to respond to such attacks while maintaining a war-fighting capability. The Department of Defense (DoD) states that Project 112 was initiated out of concern for the ability of the United States to protect and defend against potential CB threats. Project 112 consisted of both land-based and sea-based <b>tests.</b> <b>The</b> sea-based <b>tests,</b> called Project SHAD were primarily launched from other ships such as the USS Granville S. Hall (YAG-40) and USS George Eastman (YAG-39), Army tugboats, submarines, or fighter aircraft and was designed to identify U.S. warships’ vulnerabilities to attacks with chemical or biological warfare agents and to develop decontamination and other methods to counter such attacks while maintaining a war-fighting capability. The classified information related to SHAD was not completely cataloged or located in one facility. Furthermore, The Deseret Test Center was closed in the 1970s and the search for 40-year-old documents and records kept by different military services in different locations was a challenge to researchers. A fact sheet was developed for each <b>test</b> that <b>was</b> conducted and when a <b>test</b> cancellation <b>was</b> not documented, a cancellation analysis was developed outlining the logic used to presume that <b>the</b> <b>test</b> had <b>been</b> <b>cancelled.</b>|$|R

40|$|Samples of sludge were {{collected}} from the K East fuel storage basin (KE Basin) floor, contiguous pits (Weasel Pit, North Load Out Pit, Dummy Elevator Pit, and Tech View Pit), and fuel storage canisters between 1995 and 2003 for chemical and radionuclide concentration analysis, physical property determination, and chemical process testing work. Because {{of the value of}} the sludge in this testing and because of the cost of obtaining additional fresh samples, an ongoing program of sludge preservation has taken place with the goals to track the sludge identities and preserve, as well as possible, the sludge composition by keeping the sludge in sealed jars and maintaining water coverage on the sludge consistent with the controlling Fluor Hanford (FH) Sampling and Analysis plans and FH contracts with the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL).

40|$|Rod {{modulation}} of an annular surround {{can produce}} brightness contrast {{in a test}} field centered at 10 ° from the fovea. In our research, stimuli originated from a colorimeter that provided 4 primaries in both <b>the</b> circular <b>test</b> and <b>the</b> annular surround fields, and allowed independent modulation of the rods {{and each of the}} short (S) -, middle (M) -, and long (L) -wavelength-sensitive cone types. The chromaticity was set so fields had the same appearance as the equal energy spectrum. At 1 photopic troland (td), rod-induced modulation in <b>the</b> <b>test</b> field could <b>be</b> <b>cancelled</b> by either a rod- or a cone-nulling modulation added to <b>the</b> <b>test</b> field. <b>The</b> best cone nulling of rod induction showed residual flicker. Nulling was more effective, though still imperfect, with a cone-nulling stimulus of higher S-cone modulation contrast. Rod induction with square-wave, on-pulse, and off-pulse temporal profiles was closely similar. At higher light levels, 10 and 100 td, rod contrast could not be nulled by rod or cone modulation. The failure to achieve nulls may have been caused by either or both of the following hypotheses: (1) there is a mismatch between the rod and cone temporal waveforms; (2) there is strong rod input to the magnocellular pathway, but negligible rod input to the parvocellular pathway, as shown by single-unit electrophysiological data...|$|R
40|$|Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), in {{collaboration}} with ABB Industrial Systems, and under the sponsorship of the Department of Energy's (DOE) Office of Industrial Technologies (OIT), has developed a new method for measuring the moisture content of a paper web process on-line with 100 % coverage of the sheet. The method uses InGaAs linear arrays with associated optics and electronics to continuously image the full width of the web and measure transmitted light at 1. 45 {micro} and another suitable reference wavelength between 1 {micro} and 1. 6 {micro}. The method {{could also be used}} to measure paper basis weight, in addition to moisture, by adding additional hardware and optics to measure a third wavelength at 1. 57 {micro}. A patent (USP: 6355931), entitled ''System and method for 100 % moisture and basis weight measurement of moving paper'', was granted by the US Patent Office on March 12, 2002 for this invention. A proof-of-concept prototype system was also developed and tested on several occasions at ABB's sensors development facility in Columbus, Ohio.

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the first Test, West Indies were bowled out 296 as Grimmett took seven wickets, including Headley first ball. In the second innings, with West Indies 80 behind, Grimmett again attacked Headley's leg stump. After having his scoring restricted, Headley lost patience and after scoring 11 was stumped, trying to hit Grimmett. Bowled out for 249, West Indies lost by ten wickets. After scoring only three in the following tour match against Tasmania, Headley contributed 14 and two in an innings defeat in the second Test. After two heavy Test defeats for the tourists, some critics believed that the series was too one-sided and that some of <b>the</b> five <b>Tests</b> should <b>be</b> <b>cancelled.</b> Headley's poor run of form continued in the West Indian victory over Queensland and, having put on weight, he was also struggling with his fitness. In an effort to overcome Australia's leg stump attack Headley had altered his batting stance; instead of standing at right angles to the bowler, he turned his body more front-on, to enable him to improve his placement of the ball on the leg side. His quick footwork enabled him to alter his position if necessary to play the ball on the off side. He also eliminated from his strokes a risky cover drive he had developed on Caribbean pitches. During the third Test at Brisbane, Headley made his first substantial contribution to the series, after Australia scored 558 batting first. Facing Grimmett's leg side tactics, Headley managed to score freely, and forced Grimmett to alter to an off stump attack. With ten fours in total, Headley became the first West Indian to score a century against Australia, and was left 102 not out when West Indies were bowled out for 193. Forced to follow-on, West Indies were dismissed for 148 of which Headley made 28, the highest score of the innings. Ironmonger tricked him into playing the leg glance and he was caught by the wicket-keeper who had moved across in anticipation of the shot.|$|R
50|$|In 1966, the US Air Force {{developed}} an Astronaut Maneuvering Unit (AMU), a self-contained rocket pack {{very similar to}} the MMU. This was planned to <b>be</b> <b>tested</b> during Project Gemini on an EVA by Eugene Cernan on Gemini 9A on June 5, 1966. However, <b>the</b> <b>test</b> had to <b>be</b> <b>cancelled</b> because Cernan, tired and overheated, sweated so profusely that his helmet visor fogged before he could get to the AMU mounted {{on the back of the}} spacecraft. Astronauts did not learn how to work during EVA without tiring until the final Gemini 12 mission, but no AMU was carried on that flight. Since there was no real need for self-contained astronaut EVA flight in the Apollo and Skylab programs, the idea had to wait for the advent of the Space Shuttle program, though several maneuvering device designs <b>were</b> <b>tested</b> inside Skylab.The MMU was used on three Shuttle missions in 1984. It <b>was</b> first <b>tested</b> on February 7 during mission STS-41-B by astronauts Bruce McCandless II and Robert L. Stewart. Two months later during mission STS-41-C, astronauts James van Hoften and George Nelson attempted to use the MMU to capture the Solar Maximum Mission satellite and to bring it into the orbiter's payload bay for repairs and servicing. The plan was to use an astronaut-piloted MMU to grapple the SMM with the Trunion Pin Attachment Device (TPAD) mounted between the hand controllers of the MMU, null its rotation rates, and allow the Shuttle to bring it into the Shuttle's payload bay for stowage. Three attempts to grapple the satellite using the TPAD failed. The TPAD jaws could not lock onto Solar Max because of an obstructing grommet on the satellite not included in the blueprints for the satellite. This led to an improvised plan which nearly ended the satellite's mission. The improvisation had the MMU astronaut use his hands to grab hold of an SMM solar array and null the rates by a push from MMU's thrusters. Instead, this attempt induced higher rates and in multiple axes; the satellite was tumbling out of control and quickly losing battery life. SMM Operations Control Center engineers shut down all non-essential SMM subsystems and with a bit of luck were able to recover the SMM minutes before total failure. The ground support engineers then stabilized the satellite and nulled its rotation rates for capture with the orbiter's robotic arm, the Shuttle Remote Manipulator System (SRMS). This proved to be a much better plan. Their successful work increased the lifespan of the satellite.|$|R
