5|$|While {{the book}} was {{readable}} enough to sell, its dryness ensured that it was seen as aimed at specialist scientists {{and could not be}} dismissed as mere journalism or imaginative fiction. Unlike the still-popular Vestiges, it avoided the narrative style of the historical novel and cosmological speculation, though the closing sentence clearly hinted at cosmic progression. Darwin had long been immersed in the literary forms and practices of specialist science, and made effective use of his skills in structuring arguments. David Quammen has described the book as written in everyday language for a wide audience, but noted that Darwin's literary style was uneven: in some places he used convoluted sentences that are difficult to read, while in other places his writing was beautiful. Quammen advised that later editions were weakened by Darwin making concessions and adding details to address his critics, and recommended the first edition. James T. Costa said that because {{the book was}} an abstract produced in haste in response to Wallace's essay, it was more approachable than the big book on natural selection Darwin had been working on, which would have been encumbered by scholarly footnotes and much more technical detail. He added that some parts of Origin are dense, but other parts are almost lyrical, and <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>studies</b> and observations are presented in a narrative style unusual in serious scientific books, which broadened its audience.|$|E

25|$|The philosopher C. T. K. Chari of Madras Christian College in Chennai, a {{specialist}} in parapsychology, argued that Stevenson was naive and that <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>studies</b> were undermined by his lack of local knowledge. Chari wrote {{that many of the}} cases had come from societies, such as that of India, where people believed in reincarnation, and that the stories were simply cultural artifacts; he argued that, for children in many Asian countries, the recall of a past life is the equivalent of an imaginary playmate. The philosopher Keith Augustine made a similar argument. Stevenson responded that it was precisely those societies that listened to children's claims about past lives, which in Europe or North America would normally be dismissed without investigation. To address the cultural concern, he wrote European Cases of the Reincarnation Type (2003), which presented forty cases he had examined in Europe.|$|E
25|$|VEP {{testing of}} acuity is {{somewhat}} similar to preferential looking in using {{a series of}} black and white stripes (sine wave gratings) or checkerboard patterns (which produce larger responses than stripes). Behavioral responses are not required and brain waves created by the presentation of the patterns are recorded instead. The patterns become finer and finer until the evoked brain wave just disappears, which is considered to be the endpoint measure of visual acuity. In adults and older, verbal children capable of paying attention and following instructions, the endpoint provided by the VEP corresponds very well to the psychophysical measure in the standard measurement (i.e. the perceptual endpoint determined by asking the subject when they can no longer see the pattern). There is an assumption that this correspondence also applies to much younger children and infants, though this does not necessarily have to be <b>the</b> <b>case.</b> <b>Studies</b> do show the evoked brain waves, as well as derived acuities, are very adult-like by one year of age.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Case</b> <b>studies</b> {{are well}} {{established}} as a method for assisting students {{to come to terms}} with the practice of a body of knowledge. Unfortunately, any realistic <b>case</b> <b>study</b> is usually voluminous, and often boring to read in a linear fashion. Further, although <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>study</b> in principle encourages deep learning it does not easily accommodate different learning styles. This paper reports on work (supported by a 1996 CAUT grant) to develop a multimedia framework for effective exploration of <b>case</b> <b>studies.</b> It is alleged that the nonlinear presentation mode of multimedia will manage the aforementioned disadvantages of <b>case</b> <b>studies.</b> From <b>the</b> student’s point of view, the framework provides guidance for exploring <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>study</b> (via hyperlinks) while allowing individual students to explore <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>study</b> in their own way. From the author’s point of view, the framework provides guidance for the author to ensure answers to possible student questions are made available. Further, the framework provides monitoring information to facilitators and students so they can see the extent to which <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>study</b> has been explored. <b>The</b> <b>case</b> <b>study,</b> being on <b>the</b> world wide web, allows distance learning while maintaining some guidance by the facilitator...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the methodology of}} research {{into the nature of}} planning processes with particular reference to the use of <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>study.</b> <b>The</b> lack of systematic and critical examination of this matter has led generally to the persistence of a tradition of inductive research in which <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>study</b> is clearly <b>the</b> dominant method. The use of <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>study</b> is frequently justified by reference to its ability to investigate complex processes to the requisite level of detail; indeed, <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>study</b> itself, as a method, is often defined in such terms. An alternative characterization of <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>study</b> is proposed, based on a consideration of types of evidence. A review of the methodological literature reveals that the justification of the use of <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>study</b> purely by reference to the inherent nature of the subject matter is inadequate and that more fundamental matters should and implicitly do determine the choice of research method {{and the way in which}} it is used. These should be made explicit. This paper focuses, in particular, on two factors [...] the theory of knowledge that underpins research and the state of development of knowledge and theory in the field of research.
