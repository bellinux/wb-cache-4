40|$|This study {{deals with}} {{numerical}} simulation of an equipment with full hydrostatic driving system. Based on the clasical mathematical models-single {{degree of freedom}} and two degree of freedom models, it was developed {{a new set of}} practical simulation models, named SYMTRAX-I, respectivelly SYMTRAX-II, for the technological equipments with integral hydrostatic driving system. With the help of this models it was simulated the kinematic excitation phenomenon generated by the road. The complexity of this analysis consists in the fact that specific dynamic phenomenon appears at the interaction between the system framed from the road, <b>tire</b> <b>wheels</b> drive devices and the equipment insulated on the <b>tire</b> <b>wheels,</b> and the rolling system, with traction transmission and the base machine engine.

40|$|International audienceCurrent tire-wheel models {{used for}} {{structure}} borne noise simulation are valid up to 200 Hz. This limit is mainly {{due to the}} lack of tire cavity modes as well as wheel flexibility. Both have a strong effect on forced dynamic responses at wheel center in medium frequency range. Even if the current model is efficient regarding comfort simulation, a new one had to be developed to improve road noise forecast. In the scope of a partnership between PSA Peugeot Citroën and Michelin Company, the paper deals with the development of a dynamic sub-structured model of a <b>tire</b> <b>wheel</b> assembly -including the air cavity- and its usage for car and tire manufacturers. This new model is a step forward in <b>tire</b> <b>wheel</b> assembly simulation in mid-frequency range, taken into account the interactions between all fluid and structural components.

The tire was an instant success because the rubber stayed on the wheel and the compound was of good quality.|$|R
