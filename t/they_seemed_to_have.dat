25|$|John Vatatzes, {{the emperor}} of Nicaea, {{commenced}} legal persecution of the Jews in 1253. Unlike Theodore, Vatatzes ordered that the Jews within the Empire of Nicaea {{be converted to}} Christianity, {{though he did not}} order the expropriation of Jewish property. Although these measures began only a year before Vatatzes' death, <b>they</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> set a precedent of persecution which his son, Theodore II Laskaris, followed.|$|E
25|$|In {{the years}} {{leading up to}} the {{creation}} of the residential school's, the Sons of Freedom had become a concern for the province of British Columbia as a whole; <b>they</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a problem with any sort of government, in addition to the laws and policies that were being enforced. Public and Authorities were unhappy because the Sons Of Freedom did not register their births, deaths or marriages that occurred within their communities; in addition to the fact that they weren't sending their children to public schools. Public alarm was increasing, based on the fears that the unruly incidents of nude protests, burning of homes and buildings and bombings of bridges and railways, were not being attended to by the RCMP.|$|E
25|$|The {{team had}} an {{excellent}} first round in 2016–17, losing only once in 23 matches (against then-bottom club Newport County) and standing at second place. <b>They</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> guaranteed at least a play-off place, but a disastrous second round followed, with Carlisle winning just 4 of the next 21 games, losing 10 and dropping from 2nd to 10th in the standings, with two games to spare. However, a comeback home win against Newport County combined with favorable results elsewhere sent them back into play-off positions. Then, another comeback at play-off bound Exeter in the last game proved enough for a final position of 6th, and a play-off semifinal showdown with the same opponent. However, Exeter beat them 6–5 on aggregate to comdemn Carlisle to another season in League 2.|$|E

500|$|John Brousseau was not {{sent to the}} Hole, {{but what}} he saw of it made him decide to leave Scientology in 2010 after 33 years in the Church. He {{was struck by how}} [...] "dozens of these people , they were just so alive, but I looked at them now and they were just husks. They wouldn't say or {{originate}} anything, <b>they</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> no purpose, they were just like sheep.

[...] He had known and been friends with some of those in the Hole for decades and could not bear what he was seeing. As he put it, [...] "I can't stop it, but I can at least stop supporting it. So I left." [...] He left a note in his room for his colleagues to find: [...] "By now you've noticed I'm gone. I couldn't stand to see my Sea Org friends so mistreated. I won't support it anymore. Goodbye." ...|$|E
500|$|Phips and Increase Mather reached Boston in {{separate}} ships on May 14, 1692. [...] This was a Saturday afternoon, meaning all activity was [...] to cease at sundown {{according to the}} old Puritan laws regarding the sabbath. Unlike his arrival in [...] HMS Rose in 1683, when Phips showed little regard for the sabbath, on this occasion Phips was highly deferential toward the theocracy. Phips' elaborate swearing-in ceremony at the meeting house was halted at sundown and delayed until the following Monday. According to one letter writer, Phips presented himself as having no intentions to oppose the ancient laws and customs of Puritan Boston. He promised to rule as a weak governor, according to the tradition of his predecessors. The speech itself had likely been crafted with the care and attention of Increase Mather as they crossed the Atlantic. <b>They</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> come to an agreement—you work {{your side of the}} street and I'll work mine—whereby Phips would tend to the frontier while Increase Mather and his slate of cohorts would see to domestic affairs.|$|E

2500|$|Thunderface has {{suffered}} from relative anonymity due to confusion with their name (as well {{as the fact that}} they have had only one gig since 1986). They have been referred to as [...] "Rumblepuss," [...] "Thunderbread," [...] "Thunderchunks," [...] and [...] "Wonderface," [...] among other names. Their sound is described as similar to [...] "a small animal caught in some kind of machinery," [...] and their sole gig since 1986 was booked due to the humorous nature of their poor performance. Along with their gig in 1986, <b>they</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> done some school performances considering they blew the principal's eyebrows off. The only song they have been heard to play is [...] "Capital Cash" [...] by Fast Exit, a band that Brent Butt played guitar in before he got into comedy.|$|E
2500|$|This {{problem was}} also {{taken up by}} a group of Buddhist schools termed the Pudgalavadins or [...] "Personalists" [...] which {{included}} the Vātsīputrīya, the Dharmottarīya, the Bhadrayānīya, the Sammitiya and the Shannagarika. These schools posited the existence of a 'person' (pudgala) or self, which had a real existence that was not reducible to streams and collections of dharmas. They also often used other terms to refer to this real 'self', such as 'Atman' and 'Jiva' which are words for the immortal soul in Hinduism and Jainism respectively. <b>They</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> held that the 'self' was part of a fifth category of existence, the “inexpressible”. This was a radically different view than the not-self view held by the mainstream Buddhist schools and this theory was a major point of controversy and was thoroughly attacked by other Buddhist schools such as the Theravadins, Sarvastivadins and later Mahayanists.|$|E
2500|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the trial on 27 March 2008, Brendan Harris was found guilty of murder, and the judge allowed the names of both Harris and Herbert, which had been concealed during the trial, to be made public. Detective Superintendent Mick Gradwell of Lancashire Police said {{it was one of the}} most violent murders he had come across in his career: [...] "I do not think Herbert and Harris have recognised how violent the attack was. They have just done it without thinking, but <b>they</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> enjoyed it, and carried on remorselessly kicking at two very defenceless people who were unable to protect themselves because of the level of violence inflicted upon them... I am very critical of some of the parents involved. I really don't think they have taken completely seriously how repulsive this incident was...". He said that when Harris was initially interviewed about the assaults he was [...] "laughing and joking" [...] with his mother.|$|E

2500|$|In {{contrast}} to the Gale episodes, there is a lighter, comic touch in Steed and Peel's interactions {{with each other and}} their reactions to other characters and situations. Earlier series had a harder tone, with the Gale era including some quite serious espionage dramas. This almost completely disappeared as Steed and Peel visibly enjoy topping each other's witticisms. The layer of conflict with Gale—who on occasion openly resented being used by Steed, often without her permission—is absent from Steed's interaction with Peel. Also the sexual tension between Steed and Gale {{is quite different from the}} tension between Steed and Peel. [...] In both cases, the exact relationship between the partners is left ambiguous, although <b>they</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> carte blanche to visit each other's homes whenever they please, and it is not uncommon for scenes to suggest Steed had spent the night at Gale's or Peel's home, or vice versa. Although nothing [...] "improper" [...] is displayed, the obviously much closer chemistry between Steed and Peel constantly suggests intimacy between the two.|$|E
2500|$|And in the meantime, the Commissioners were, {{generally}} speaking, {{distracted by}} various other {{personal and political}} business; although they met [...] infrequently [...] {{there is no record}} of what they discussed, or if they were getting closer to a decision about what their plan would entail. Finally, on November 29, 1810, with the surveying season for that season over and only four months left before they were to report out their plan, <b>they</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> arrived at a decision. On that date, Morris informed the Common Council that although more work was left to be done [...] "on the ground", the Commission itself had [...] "completed their work" [...] and would {{be able to make a}} report that would [...] "compl substantially, if not literally within the law, shewing [...] all the streets which to be laid out..." [...] Randel then spent a considerable amount of time in December meeting with Morris and perhaps the other Commissioners at Morsis' estate in the Bronx, during which time it appears that the grid plan was born. [...] At Morris' suggestion, the Common Council hired Randel to actually do the extensive work involved in making the grid a physical reality [...] although city surveyor William Bridges (see below) also submitted a proposal to do the work [...] and Randel began this work even before the Commissioners' Plan was announced publicly. A provisional contract between the Council and Randel was signed on December 31, the permanent contract being conditional on Randel delivering the final maps of the plan, which he did on March 22, 1811; the maps were filed by the Council's clerk on April 2, two days before the Commission's legal deadline.|$|E
