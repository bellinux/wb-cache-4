The baby was initially hesitant, but relented after the crew brushed a large amount of honey onto the nipple.|$|E

Instead of returning <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>to</b> the water, {{he wanted to take}} the bunyip back to the camp to boast of his fishing prowess, against the urging of his friends. Before he could do anything, the mother bunyip rose from the water, flooding swirling water around them, and took back her baby.
