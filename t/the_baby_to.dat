5|$|Prior to Katherine's words, {{the view}} {{had been for}} Rowe {{to act as a}} {{surrogate}} mother; she would give <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>to</b> Jackson as a friendly favor and he would raise it.

5|$|Benny Chan {{described}} the filming process {{as some of}} the darkest days of his career, explaining that the baby was a factor beyond his control, and could not work more than eight hours a day.

The baby was initially hesitant, but relented after the crew brushed a large amount of honey onto the nipple.|$|E

An Aboriginal man, fishing in a lagoon, caught a baby bunyip. Instead of returning <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>to</b> the water, {{he wanted to take}} the bunyip back to the camp to boast of his fishing prowess, against the urging of his friends. Before he could do anything, the mother bunyip rose from the water, flooding swirling water around them, and took back her baby.
