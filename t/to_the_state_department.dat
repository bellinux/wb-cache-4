25|$|For 15 years, Wayne Schmuck of Harvard, Illinois, {{owner of}} Big Foot Auto Sales, had sold used cars {{he had bought}} in his state, where vehicle titles did not then require a {{statement}} on {{the title of the}} odometer reading {{at the time of the}} transaction, to dealers in Wisconsin, which did. Unbeknownst to the dealers, he had in some cases hired someone to roll back the odometers on them, making the vehicles appear to have less mileage than they actually did. Thus they commanded an artificially higher price, both when the dealer paid Schmuck and when they sold it to a customer.

25|$|The three {{deaths were}} the only Americans killed {{as a result of}} attacks on American ships by German {{submarine}} until 16 March 1917, when diplomatic relations had irreparably broken down just before the declaration of war. American official reaction to the incident was determined by President Woodrow Wilson under the advice of United States Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan and Counselor <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>Department</b> Robert Lansing. Bryan favoured reconciliation with Germany and avoidance of war, but this policy was becoming increasingly unpopular and was opposed by his subordinate Lansing. Lansing submitted a memorandum proposing immediate and vigorous protest and coupled with the Cushing incident and the sinking of RMS Lusitania on 7 May, a British ship but carrying American passengers who drowned, president Wilson made a forceful response to Germany. In June Bryan resigned and was replaced by Lansing. Despite his belligerent formal advice, Lansing's private papers suggest that he considered the rights and wrongs of the situation much more finely balanced and the logical outcome ought to have been impartial military trade sanctions against both belligerents. However, the US economy was already heavily committed to producing military supplies for the British, while American support for {{one side or the other}} was likely to prove decisive in choosing the eventual victor.|$|E
