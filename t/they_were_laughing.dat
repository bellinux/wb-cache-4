25|$|Meinhof's last {{appearance}} in court was on 4 May 1976 when the defendants requested to {{provide evidence about}} the participation of West Germany in the Vietnam war, claiming {{that this was the}} cause of their radicalization, and making the novel request to be granted the status of prisoners of war (see above). According to Jutta Ditfurth, the last days before Meinhof's death went smoothly. The prisoners (including Meinhof) spent their meeting time (30 minutes, twice per day) discussing various philosophers and political issues. One of the guards noted that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>laughing.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{incident}} was heard {{by thousands of}} commuters driving home from work, {{many of whom were}} forced to stop driving because <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>laughing</b> so much: a two-mile traffic jam {{at the entrance to the}} Dartford Tunnel was reportedly caused by drivers unable to pay the toll due to laughter. Fourteen years later, in 2005, Agnew's line, [...] "Just didn't quite get his leg over" [...] was voted [...] "the greatest sporting commentary of all time" [...] by listeners to BBC Radio 5 Live. The other eight finalists included Kenneth Wolstenholme's [...] "They think it's all over – it is now!" [...] and Ian Robertson's [...] "This is the one. He drops for World Cup glory... It's up! It's over! He's done it! Jonny Wilkinson is England's hero yet again". Agnew and Johnston secured 78% of the votes.|$|E
500|$|In January 2007, it was {{reported}} that May and England defender Glen Johnson were caught at a B store in Dartford, Kent, attempting to steal bathroom fittings. They both received £80 fines. Johnson described the incident as [...] "comical" [...] because it was a misunderstanding — [...] "Ben was doing up his bathroom so we went to B and found one of those sets where you get everything in one box. But he wanted a seat with a slow-close lid, so we took out the seat and put in another one. What we didn't know was that the new seat was £2.35 more expensive. We went through the till, paid for it and then the security guard stopped us and said he had been watching on CCTV. We just burst out laughing. Where's Jeremy Beadle then? But he said, 'No, this is serious, the police are on their way.' The police turned up and <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>laughing.</b> I said to the security guard, 'Can we not just pay the £2.35?'" [...] He said, 'No, this is a serious offence.' So the police gave us two options: go to court and fight it out, or pay an on-the-spot fine. We couldn't be bothered going to court so we paid the fine but doing that made us look guilty".|$|E

500|$|Both Dozier and Yuricon {{president}} Erica Friedman {{wrote about}} the sexual nature of Honey, including the lesbian desire of the Jewel Princess (one of Honey's enemies) {{for her in the}} second episode. Friedman—who had looked for such [...] "implied yuri" [...] in Cutie Honey manga—called the Princess's appearance [...] "*just* what I was hoping for", and praised Honey's change to her S Queen form in response. Ross said about the series: [...] "It's seemingly exploitative, it's incredibly sexist, and the female members of my household - you'd expect them to be indignant, but, no, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>laughing</b> their butts off because it was so blatant, and yet Honey was actually never objectified in the whole series." [...] He further writes, [...] "Honey Kisaragi is an extremely strong character who is no damsel in distress. If anyone needs help in this series, it's the guys!" [...] Toole said that Jessica Calvello [...] "gives the character a growling, tough-girl charm that was conspicuously absent from the original version", while Dozier said that Calvello captured [...] "the combination of innocence and bravado [...] that is both so confusing and yet so appropriate". Beveridge said the [...] "fight sequences are pretty well done and provide some fun moments watching Honey battle the various demonic forms", but concluded that Honey main goal is to showcase the lead heroine's changes: [...] "Oh, lets face it. it's all about the half to completely naked transformation sequences. They're grrreat!" ...|$|E

5000|$|Xiàojiǎo (笑筊, {{laughing}} answer): Both blocks flat {{have different}} interpretations; either {{it can be}} an emphasized 'no' answer and a sign that the gods <b>are</b> <b>laughing</b> at the question, or that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>laughing</b> because the querent should know the answer, or that {{the answer to the question}} is obvious.
