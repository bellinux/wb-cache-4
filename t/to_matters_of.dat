5|$|Courts {{are divided}} into three categories: civil, religious, and special. The civil courts deal with civil and {{criminal}} matters, including cases brought against the government. The civil courts include Magistrate Courts, Courts of First Instance, Courts of Appeal, High Administrative Courts which hear cases relating to administrative matters, and the Constitutional Court which {{was set up in}} 2012 in order to hear cases regarding the constitutionality of laws. Although Islam is the state religion, the constitution preserves a degree of religious and personal freedom. Religious law only extends <b>to</b> <b>matters</b> <b>of</b> personal status such as divorce and inheritance in religious courts, and is partially based on Islamic Sharia law. The special court deals with cases forwarded by the civil one.|$|E
5|$|Eyre was {{promoted}} to rear-admiral on 12 August 1819 and shortly afterwards received an offer from Lord Melville to take command of the Cape and St Helena stations, {{but was unable to}} accept owing <b>to</b> <b>matters</b> <b>of</b> a personal nature. In 1823 he was able to accept the offer of the command of the South American station, at a time when several of the former Spanish colonies were declaring independence. Eyre was able to successfully manage delicate diplomatic and military duties, and was able to protect British rights and possessions in the area during periods of upheaval. His actions in the region included signing treaties with Spain and Portugal involving the prevention of illegal slave trafficking. He stepped down after the expiration of his posting and was succeeded by Admiral Sir Robert Otway.|$|E

5|$|Similar to the United Kingdom's position, {{judicial}} review in Singapore is confined <b>to</b> <b>matters</b> <b>of</b> public law, and the applicable tests {{are the source}} test and nature test. The Datafin decision was applied by the Singapore Court of Appeal in Public Service Commission v. Lai Swee Lin Linda (2001), where the respondent, an employee with the Land Office, had the probationary period of her employment extended without prior warning. Her employment contract was later terminated. She complained to various statutory bodies, and ultimately to the Public Service Commission ("PSC"), but was unsuccessful in having her employment reinstated. She then sought leave from the High Court to apply for {{judicial review}} against the PSC. In the course of its judgment, the Court of Appeal accepted that the source test {{is one of the}} tests that can be relied on to determine whether a decision by a body is amenable to judicial review. In addition, it noted that Datafin had held that the source test is not the only applicable test. However, the Court did not embark on a discussion of the nature test because it found that when the respondent's employer had made the decisions concerning her employment, it had acted pursuant to her contractual terms of service and had not exercised its statutory powers. Thus, the decisions were not susceptible to judicial review. It did not invariably follow that when a statutory body makes a decision it is exercising a statutory power.|$|E

50|$|The {{matter that}} {{comprises}} Earth is connected in fundamental ways <b>to</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> certain chondrite meteorites, and <b>to</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> outer {{portion of the}} Sun. There {{is good reason to}} believe that Earth is, in the main, like a chondrite meteorite. Beginning as early as 1940, scientists, including Francis Birch, built geophysics upon the premise that Earth is like ordinary chondrites, {{the most common type of}} meteorite observed impacting Earth, while totally ignoring another, albeit less abundant type, called enstatite chondrites. The principal difference between the two meteorite types is that enstatite chondrites formed under circumstances of extremely limited available oxygen, leading to certain normally oxyphile elements existing either partially or wholly in the alloy portion that corresponds to the core of Earth.|$|R

25|$|Those {{who believe}} in the {{inspiration}} of scripture teach that it is infallible (or inerrant), that is, free from error in the truths it expresses by its character as the word of God. However, the scope of what this encompasses is disputed, as the term includes 'faith and practice' positions, with some denominations holding that the historical or scientific details, which may be irrelevant <b>to</b> <b>matters</b> <b>of</b> faith and Christian practice, may contain errors. Other scholars take stronger views, but for a few verses these positions require more exegetical work, leading to dispute (compare the serious debate over the related issue of perspicuity, attracting biblical and philosophical discussion).|$|E
25|$|When Søren Kierkegaard, as his {{character}} Johannes Climacus, ends his writings: My thesis was, subjectivity, heartfelt is the truth, {{he does not}} advocate for subjectivism in its extreme form (the theory that something is true simply because one believes it to be so), but rather that the objective approach <b>to</b> <b>matters</b> <b>of</b> personal truth cannot shed any light upon that which is most essential to a person's life. Objective truths {{are concerned with the}} facts of a person's being, while subjective truths are concerned with a person's way of being. Kierkegaard agrees that objective truths for the study of subjects like mathematics, science, and history are relevant and necessary, but argues that objective truths do not shed any light on a person's inner relationship to existence. At best, these truths can only provide a severely narrowed perspective that {{has little to do with}} one's actual experience of life.|$|E

25|$|The Temple Beau is {{straightforward}} unlike Love in Several Masques, and {{it relies on}} a simpler set of patterns: instead of triplicates, the images are repeated only once. Additionally, many of the characters are analogous to {{the roles of the}} characters within the other play (Wilding and Wisemore, Veromil and Merital, Valentine and Malvil, etc.). However, the plot of the two plays are different because Fielding focuses more on hypocrisy and how characters interact with Wilding. Bellaria's two aunts, Lady Pedant and Lady Gravely, representing immodesty and prudishness respectively, try to influence her actions; Bellaria is able to avoid the suggestions of both, and believes that one should not hide their love for another and should be passionate towards a virtuous man. When it comes <b>to</b> <b>matters</b> <b>of</b> gender, the play expresses a view of equality between the sexes that manifests in marriage. However, the play reveals that there are different standards for the genders even though the male characters may express concerns about these double standards.|$|E
25|$|The fables in {{the third}} book, as well as others, do not {{strictly}} limit <b>to</b> <b>matters</b> <b>of</b> war and peace. Some present fables that demonstrate how different characters have different needs and motives, which is subjectively rational from each character's viewpoint, and that addressing these needs can empower peaceful relationships even if they start off in a different way. For example, in the fable The Old Man the Young Wife, the text relates a story wherein an old man marries a young woman from a penniless family. The young woman detests his appearance {{so much that she}} refuses to even look at him let alone consummate their marriage. One night, while she sleeps in the same bed with her back facing the old man, a thief enters their house. She is scared, turns over, and for security embraces the man. This thrills every limb of the old man. He feels grateful to the thief for making his young wife hold him at last. The aged man rises and profusely thanks the thief, requesting the intruder to take whatever he desires.|$|E
25|$|Melbourne Victory– The long-standing {{historical}} contempt held by many Western Australians {{toward their}} eastern state neighbours, {{as well as}} a scorn for anything Victorian has culminated in an especial rivalry with the Melbourne Victory Football Club. The distaste felt by many Glory fans toward the Victorians can largely be put down to the greater bitterness felt by Western Australians toward the Eastern states in regard <b>to</b> <b>matters</b> <b>of</b> politics, culture and indeed other sports, especially Australian Rules Football. Western Australian's often perceive their state to be 'forgotten' in matters of national interest, {{largely as a result of}} the state being such a distance from the main population and political centres of the country; a factor which can also be said to result in Western Australians being some of the more parochial people in Australia. This hatred of the eastern states can be said to focus upon Melbourne Victory in the A League as Victory are the biggest and most successful club on the Eastern seaboard. Another reason for the hate towards Melbourne Victory is due to Besart Berisha, who was awarded a controversial penalty in the dying minutes of the 2012 Grand Final.|$|E

25|$|In 1593, Galileo {{became a}} {{consultant}} to the Arsenal, advising military engineers and instrument makers and helping to solve shipbuilders' problems, many of them relating <b>to</b> <b>matters</b> <b>of</b> ballistics. He was also responsible for creating some major innovations in the production and logistics of the Arsenal. As a result of his interactions with the Arsenal, Galileo published a book later in his life addressing a new field of modern science, that concerned with the strength and resistance of materials. This science largely saw its roots in the knowledge of the shipwrights of the Venetian Arsenal. It is also supposed that Galileo's initial visits to the Arsenal were {{as a result of his}} initiative to further investigate Aristotle's questions concerning shipbuilding and navigation, found in the Mechanical Questions of Aristotle. As a result of these investigations, which were pursued by observing the work of the shipwrights, Galileo was asked to help in resolving a specific problem with the rowing units of the galleys. As a result of his study of Aristotle, and in particular Question 4 regarding the propulsion of ships by oar, Galileo was able to produce a response to this question and ended up becoming a major source of information for the shipbuilders of the Arsenal concerning matters of rowing, instruments, and ballistics.|$|E
