5|$|Although fantasy {{comes from}} an imaginative realm, Martin sees an honest {{necessity}} to reflect the real world where people die sometimes ugly deaths, even beloved people. Main characters are killed off so that the reader will not expect the supposed hero to survive, and instead will feel the same tension and fear that the characters might. The novels also reflect <b>the</b> <b>substantial</b> death rates in war. The deaths of supernumerary extras or orcs have no major effect on readers, whereas a friend's death has much more emotional impact. Martin prefers a hero's sacrifice to say something profound about human nature.|$|E
5|$|By the 2010s the {{building}} was owned by Enterprise Inns, who own around 5,500 pubs in the UK. Despite advertising for a new lease of {{the building}} in circa 2013 whilst letting the property for a peppercorn rent, Enterprise Inns ultimately decided to sell the property as a freehold in March 2015. No offers to continue operating the building as a pub were received, although some offers were received from developers seeking to redevelop the property, perhaps due to <b>the</b> <b>substantial</b> refurbishment of the building that was required.|$|E
5|$|During the Cold War, Swiss {{authorities}} {{considered the}} construction of a Swiss nuclear bomb. Leading nuclear physicists at the Federal Institute of Technology Zürich such as Paul Scherrer made this a realistic possibility. In 1988, the Paul Scherrer Institute was founded in his name to explore the therapeutic uses of neutron scattering technologies. Financial problems with the defence budget and ethical considerations prevented <b>the</b> <b>substantial</b> funds from being allocated, and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty of 1968 was seen as a valid alternative. All remaining plans for building nuclear weapons were dropped by 1988.|$|E

5|$|In 1782 Antoine Beauvilliers, {{pastry chef}} {{to the future}} Louis XVIII, opened {{one of the most}} popular {{restaurants}} of the time – the Grande Taverne de Londres – in the arcades of the Palais-Royal. Other restaurants were opened by chefs of the time who were leaving the failing monarchy of France, in the period leading up to the French Revolution. It was these restaurants that expanded upon the limited menus of decades prior, and led to the full restaurants that were completely legalized with the advent of the French Revolution and abolition of the guilds. This and <b>the</b> <b>substantial</b> discretionary income of the French Directory's nouveau riche helped keep these new restaurants in business.|$|E
5|$|In {{his later}} years Edouard Ravel {{declared}} his intention to leave {{the bulk of the}} composer's estate to the city of Paris for the endowment of a Nobel Prize in music, but evidently changed his mind. After his death in 1960 the estate passed through several hands. Despite <b>the</b> <b>substantial</b> royalties paid for performing Ravel's music, the news magazine Le Point reported in 2000 that it was unclear who the beneficiaries were. The British newspaper The Guardian reported in 2001 that no money from royalties had been forthcoming for the maintenance of the Ravel museum at Montfort-l'Amaury, which was in a poor state of repair.|$|E

However, after the fall of communism in 1989 many of these factories faced severe problems and subsequently closed down.|$|E

5|$|Many {{buildings}} did {{not hold}} up to the shaking of the earthquake and those that did collapse often lacked any survival space, but lack of effective medical care and poor planning also contributed to <b>the</b> <b>substantial</b> scope of the disaster. Buildings that didn't collapse featured well-maintained masonry and skeletal components that were joined together adequately {{in a way that}} allowed for the building to resist seismic waves. Most bridges and tunnels and other public infrastructure withstood the earthquake but hospitals did not fare well. Most collapsed, killing two-thirds of the doctors, destroying equipment and medicine, and reducing the capacity to handle the critical medical needs in the region.|$|E

5|$|The ad {{was also}} a hit with the public. It has been {{credited}} by Guinness as being responsible for <b>the</b> <b>substantial</b> boost in sales experienced by the brand during {{the period in which}} it was broadcast. While revenues within the UK beer market declined by an average of −0.4%(−£19M), the year-on-year figures for Guinness showed an increase of 3.6%(+£13.3M). Between October 2005 and October 2006, Guinness achieved its highest ever volume (6.8%) and value (7.4%) shares, taking the position of market leader from Stella Artois. Diageo attributed the growth in no small part to the positive reception garnered by noitulovE.|$|E
5|$|The {{first phase}} of this work took place from 1539 until autumn 1540. The Moravian {{engineer}} Stefan von Haschenperg {{was responsible for the}} design of the fort, being paid <b>the</b> <b>substantial</b> salary of £75 a year for his work on this and other similar projects, including Calshot, Hurst, Sandgate and Sandown. Philip Chute, John Fletcher and William Oxenbridge, all prominent local men, served as the commissioners for the project, Oxenbridge becoming the pay master. Finding sufficient numbers of workmen was difficult and some had to be pressed into service unwillingly. More artillery pieces were sent to the castle ahead of the work being completed, and were probably installed in temporary battery positions around the castle site.|$|E
