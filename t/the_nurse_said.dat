40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to explore and address the views of children's nurses in {{relation}} to their educational needs on pain management.

Evaluation was by questionnaire and semi-structured interviews. Ten children's <b>nurses</b> attended <b>the</b> study day. All <b>the</b> <b>nurses</b> <b>said</b> they gained knowledge on the day â€“ in particular assessment of pain and the individuality of the pain experience. <b>The</b> <b>nurses</b> felt that their new knowledge increased their confidence and contributed to them feeling assertive when managing children's pain.

40|$|In 2011 it was {{reported}} 29, 907 people with a cancer diagnosis, {{and despite the fact}} that survival numbers increase, it is still a significant number of people who die of cancer every year. The process of dying and death is a natural part of life, but it's not always easy to deal with this. The purpose of this study was to examine how nurses experience spiritual aspects for cancer patients living at home. Data were collected using semi-structured, individual interviews with ten <b>nurses.</b> <b>The</b> interviews were analysed by means of Giorgi analytical method. <b>The</b> <b>nurses</b> <b>said</b> it was important to have a dialog with the patient about spiritual aspects, but several nurses had problems involving themselves in talks related to the patientâ€™s situation and his thoughts about the death. To allow more cancer patients a good and worthy treatment in their own home, the community health services should focus more on increasing the skills related to spiritual aspects for cancer patients at home...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore nursesâ€™ {{emotional}} challenges when caring for the dying in hospices. The study has a qualitative design, and knowledge was developed through a dialectical exchange between theory and data. Ten individual in-depth interviews were conducted with nurses recruited from two hospices in Denmark. Although all of <b>the</b> <b>nurses</b> <b>said</b> that they experienced emotional challenges or felt emotionally touched during their work, the study found a variety of opinions related to the extent to which their emotional reactions should be revealed in their role as a hospice professional. The participants described their emotional challenges as being simultaneously draining and enriching experiences leading to personal and professional growth and development. The study may contribute to increased awareness of emotional chal- lenges for hospice nurses, which involve continuous reflection and balancing between meeting the dying as a human being and meeting the dying as a hospice professional...|$|R

My friend said it did not matter. The Child clung to the frying- pan with passion. The book my friend was reading said that was how the human mind was formed: the Child's instinct prompted it to seize upon objects tending to develop its brain faculty.

But he caught her throat with his hand, and asked why she would cause his death, for the wooers would slay him if they knew who he was.
