The adaptive responses during the 12 d, 2 -h acclimation did not alter acceleration tolerance of either men or women, or the women's <b>tilt</b> <b>tolerance,</b> but did increase men's <b>tilt</b> <b>tolerance</b> from 30. 4 min before to 58. 3 min after acclimation.

40|$|More than 60 % of US astronauts {{participating}} in Mir and early International Space Station missions (greater than 5 months) {{were unable to}} complete a 10 min 80 deg headup tilt test on landing day. This high incidence of postspaceflight orthostatic intolerance {{may be related to}} limitations of the inflight exercise hardware that prevented high intensity training. PURPOSE: This study sought to determine if a countermeasure program that included intense lowerbody resistive and rowing exercises designed to prevent cardiovascular and musculoskeletal deconditioning during 70 days of 6 deg head-down tilt bed rest (BR), a spaceflight analog, also would protect against post BR orthostatic intolerance. METHODS: Sixteen males participated in this study and performed no exercise (Control, n= 10) or performed an intense supine exercise protocol with resistive and aerobic components (Exercise, n= 6). On 3 days/week, exercise subjects performed lower body resistive exercise and a 30 min continuous bout of rowing (greater than or equal to 75 % max heart rate). On 3 other days/week, subjects performed only highintensity, intervalstyle rowing. Orthostatic intolerance was assessed using a 15 min 80 deg headup tilt test performed 2 days (BR 2) before and {{on the last day of}} BR (BR 70). Plasma volume was measured using a carbon monoxide rebreathing technique on BR 3 and before rising on the first recovery day (BR+ 0). RESULTS: Following 70 days of BR, <b>tilt</b> <b>tolerance</b> time decreased significantly in both the Control (BR 2 : 15. 0 +/- 0. 0, BR 70 : 9. 9 +/- 4. 6 min, mean +/- SD) and Exercise (BR 2 : 12. 2 +/- 4. 7, BR 70 : 4. 9 +/- 1. 9 min) subjects, but the decreased <b>tilt</b> <b>tolerance</b> time was not different between groups (Control: 34 +/- 31, Exercise: 56 +/- 16 %). Plasma volume also decreased (Control: 0. 56 +/- 0. 40, Exercise: 0. 48 +/- 0. 33 L) from pre to postBR, with no differences between groups (Control: 18 +/- 11 %, Exerciser: 15 +/- 1 0 %). CONCLUSIONS: These findings confirm previous reports in shorter BR studies that the performance of an exercise countermeasure protocol by itself during BR does not prevent orthostatic intolerance or plasma volume loss. This suggests that protection against orthostatic intolerance in astronauts following longduration spaceflight will require an additional intervention, such as periodic orthostatic stress, fluid repletion, and/or lowerbody compression garments...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a novel thermal control {{system for the}} Warm Electronics Box (WEB) on board a small lunar surface lander intended to support science activities anywhere on the lunar surface for an extended duration of up to 6 years. Virtually all lander electronics, which collectively dissipate about 60 W in the reference mission, are contained within the WEB. These devices must be maintained below 323 K (with a goal of 303 K) during the nearly 15 -earth-day lunar day, when surface temperatures can reach 390 K, and above 263 K during the nearly 15 -earth-day lunar night, when surface temperatures can reach 100 K. Because of the large temperature swing from lunar day-to-night, a novel thermal switching system was required that {{would be able to}} provide high conductance from WEB to radiator(s) during the hot lunar day and low (or negligible) conductance during the cold lunar night. The concept that was developed consists of ammonia variable conductance heat pipes (VCHPs) to collect heat from WEB components and a polymer wick propylene loop heat pipe (LHP) to transport the collected heat to the radiator(s). The VCHPs autonomously maximize transport when the WEB is warm and autonomously shut down when the WEB gets cold. The LHP autonomously shuts down when the VCHPs shut down. When the environment transitions from lunar night to day, the VCHPs and LHP autonomously turn back on. Out of 26 analyzed systems, this novel arrangement was able to best achieve the combined goals of zero control power, autonomous operation, long life, low complexity, low T, and landed <b>tilt</b> <b>tolerance...</b>|$|E

40|$|Skew quadrupoles {{are well}} known for their {{capability}} of tilting beams around their longitudinal axes. However, dipoles can produce the same effect. A horizontal bending dipole aligned with an inclination (slope) angle phi {{with respect to the}} reference coordinate system introduces a small tilt (roll) angle psi into the beam, which for small angles is proportional to the product of the magnet bending angle alpha and the slope phi. For transfer lines this effect has previously been neglected (it is comparable to the <b>tilt</b> alignment <b>tolerance</b> of the magnets of the order of 0. 1 mrad rms), but for long lines with many horizontal bending magnets on relatively steep vertical slopes relative to the reference frame, a non-negligible tilt angle psi can accumulate between the local beam plane and the reference alignment system.

We tested the hypothesis that hypovolemia alone, {{in the absence of}} spaceflight, also would cause subjects to separate into presyncopal and non-presyncopal groups according to their sympathetic responses during tilt. We studied 20 subjects, including 10 veteran astronauts, on three occasions.

40|$|Decreased working {{capacity}} and "orthostatic" intolerance {{are two major}} problems for astronauts during and after landing from spaceflight in a return vehicle. The purpose was to test the hypotheses that (1) supine-passive-acceleration training, supine-interval-exercise plus acceleration training, and supine exercise plus acceleration training will improve orthostatic tolerance (OT) in ambulatory men; and that (2) addition of aerobic exercise conditioning will not influence this enhanced OT from that of passive-acceleration training. Seven untrained men (24 - 38 yr) underwent 3 training regimens (30 min/d x 5 d/wk x 3 wk on the human-powered centrifuge - HPC) : (a) Passive acceleration (alternating + 1. 0 Gz to 50 % Gzmax); (b) Exercise acceleration (alternating 40 % - 90 % V 02 max leg cycle exercise plus 50 % of HPCmax acceleration); and (c) Combined intermittent exercise-acceleration at 40 % to 90 % HPCmax. Maximal supine exercise workloads increased (P < 0. 05) by 8. 3 % with Passive, by 12. 6 % with Exercise, and by 15. 4 % with Combined; but maximal V 02 and HR were unchanged in all groups. Maximal endurance (time to cessation) was unchanged with Passive, but increased (P < 0. 05) with Exercise and Combined. Resting pre-tilt HR was elevated by 12. 9 % (P < 0. 05) only after Passive training, suggesting that exercise training attenuated this HR response. All resting pre-tilt blood pressures (SBP, DBP, MAP) were not different pre- vs. post-training. Post-training tilt-tolerance time and HR were increased (P < 0. 05) only with Passive training by 37. 8 % and by 29. 1 %, respectively.

40|$|Circulating blood {{volume is}} reduced during spaceflight, leaving astronauts hemodynamically {{compromised}} after landing. Because of this hypovolemia, crew members {{are able to}} withstand a postflight 10 minute upright tilt test {{only if they are}} able to mount a hyper-sympathetic response. Previous work from this laboratory has shown that about 30 % of astronauts, primarily female, have postflight sympathetic responses to tilt that are equal to or less than their preflight responses and thus, they become presyncopal. Part of the mission of the cardiovascular lab at the Johnson Space Center is to identify susceptible crewmembers before flight so that individualized countermeasures can be prescribed. The goal {{of this study was to}} develop a ground based model of hypovolemia that could be used for this purpose We tested the hypothesis that hypovolemia alone, in the absence of spaceflight, would reproduce the landing day rate of presyncope during upright tilt in normal volunteers. Further, we hypothesized that, during hypovolemia, subjects who had sympathetic responses that were equal to or less than their normovolemic responses would become presyncopal during upright tilt tests. We studied 20 subjects, 13 male and 7 female, on two separate occasions: during normovolemia and hypovolemia. We induced hypovolemia with intravenous furosemide 40 hours prior to the experiment day, followed by a 10 MEq Na diet. On the normovolemia and hypovolemia test days, plasma volume, <b>tilt</b> <b>tolerance</b> and supine and standing arterial pressure, heart rate and plasma norepinephrine levels were measured. A two factor, repeated measures analysis of variance was performed to examine the differences between group (presyncopal vs. non-presyncopal) and day (normovolemia vs. hypovolemia) effects. There were no differences in baseline arterial pressure between normovolemia and hypovolemia or between presyncopal and non-presyncopal groups, but heart rates were higher with hypovolemia in both groups (presyncopal: 70 5 bpm vs. 63 3 bpm, P = 0. 003, non-presyncopal: 59 2 bpm vs. 52 2 bpm, P = 0. 003). Similar to patterns reported after flight, non-presyncopal subjects had greater norepinephrine responses to tilt during hypovolemia compared to normovolemia (580 79 vs. 298 37 pg/ml, P < 0. 05), but presyncopal subjects did not (180 44 vs. 145 32 pg/ml, P = NS). This new model has the potential to accelerate the development of countermeasures and save flight resources.

AIMS: Attempt at prediction of individual relaxed &#x 002 B; Gz tolerance on the basis of head-up tilt (HUT) testing. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: In two stages, 20 healthy men at the mean age 21. 5 years took part in this study. The first stage, a 45 min, HUT test was performed using the Westminster protocol. During the second stage each underwent a centrifuge evaluation in response to gradual onset rate profiles. METHODS AND MATERIAL: In each subject, heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) before and at 2, 15 and 45 min of the tilt-test were recorded. The gravity-load centrifuge (GOR) studies were carried out [following the standard GOR programme, at 0. 1 G/s rate of gravity load increase until the gravity load tolerance limit (loss of peripheral vision) was reached]. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Relationships between variables were explored using Kendall&#x 2032;s tau-B correlation coefficient. The critical P-level was one-tailed 0. 05. RESULTS: In four of 20 subjects (20 &#x 0025;), vasovagal syncope occurred during the <b>tilt</b> test.

40|$|Phase {{compensator}} is a {{key element}} in the polarized interferometer, whose stability has a directive influence on the reliability of the polarized interference spectroscopy. The specification of the phase compensator such as the relative sensitivity of optical path difference, the <b>tilted</b> error <b>tolerance</b> of optical wedge, the oblique incidence angle error tolerance and the temperature adaptability were studied, and the corresponding calculated formulas were derived. The anti;interference ability of the moving optical wedge is 2 /Δnsinθ times stronger than the classical Michelson interferometer. The ability of the moving wedge to resist the inclination is 1. 75 /Δn times higher than classic Michelson interferometer. After light&# 39;s incidence with small angle, there are no additional optical path. The greatest optical path distance error of the phase compensator is 1. 8 μm when the temperature changes from; 20 to 85, which has a good thermal stability. The angle of the wedge is also an important parameter to affect the phase compensator. If setting the angle of the wedge as 30 °, a good balance between performance, size and cost may be achieved. The birefringence difference of crystal material is smaller than one, so the stability advantages of the polarized interferometer are very obvious which build up a good basis for its field application with complicated surroundings. © 2016, Science Press.

40|$|Deconditioning is an {{integrated}} physiological {{response of the}} body to a reduction in metabolic rate; that is, to a reduction in energy use or in exercise level. While it may involve assumption of a horizontal body position, it certainly perturbs bodily homeostasis - at least temporarily. The reduction in physical activity that causes deconditioning is often associated with an increase in the time spent, for whatever reason, in a sitting or horizontal position. As a result, orthostatic factors may also contribute to the deconditioning mechanism. The word decondition may be defined as " 1 : to cause extinction of (a conditioned response) 2 : to cause to lose physical fitness". This definition implies that psychological/emotional factors may accompany physical deconditioning, and it is this interpretation of the word that is used throughout this volume. It is apparent that deconditioning {{plays a major role in}} the mechanism of the general adaptive (homeostatic) response that is initiated by exposure to prolonged bed rest (BR). And the total homeostatic response to BR involves more than deconditioning per se. For example, it has been shown that the restoration of plasma volume and maximal work capacity after 4 weeks of BR deconditioning left other bodily functions (submaximal exercise oxygen uptake and cardiac output, leg proprioception and posterior leg muscle thickness and volume, head-up <b>tilt</b> <b>tolerance,</b> and sleep quality) functioning at decreased levels. The precise effect of deconditioning on BR homeostasis is difficult to determine, because the fundamental interactive neuro-endocrine-immune control networks that facilitate conditioning and deconditioning also act to maintain basic wholebody homeostasis. For example, is the mechanism of BR-induced deconditioning independent of the mechanism that provokes concomitant orthostatic intolerance; that is, fainting? Assumption of the recumbent body position for prolonged periods of time, results in a new adaptive-homeostatic state. This state occurs in response to the mutually interactive effects of the change in bodily position (hydrostatic pressure), to the virtual elimination of longitudinal pressure on the bones, to the increased confinement with possible reduction in total daily energy (exercise) expenditure, to the reorientation of stimuli within the vestibular organs, and (often) to altered socio-psychological conditions. The exercise-training (reconditioning) syndrome affects total body homeostasis by facilitating increases in work capacity and endurance, whereas deconditioning decreases physical performance. There are many interrelated factors that influence the control parameters that seek to maintain the adaptive conditioning-deconditioning syndrome. These control parameters can be better elucidated by subjecting otherwise healthy ambulatory people to various stresses, such as exercise training and prolonged spaceflight, bed rest, water immersion, hyperbaria, and isolation and confinement. Changes in control parameters will be manifested in muscle function, orthostatic tolerance, cardiorespiratory responses, musculo-skeletal systems, free-radical processes, and body thermoregulation with overarching effects on the subjects' psycho-sociological states. A discussion of these factors and the control parameters constitutes the substance of this volume. Special emphasis is placed on delineating practical applications of the findings that will be of special interest to physicians, nurses, and other health-care workers...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} is unlimitedA MW class {{free electron laser}} capable of delivering energy {{at the speed of}} light can improve ASCM defensive capability for Navy ships. Many design challenges must be overcome to make such a weapon possible. One such challenge is to maintain the power density on laser cavity mirrors at acceptable levels. The use of a short Rayleigh length to increase beam spot size at the mirror is studied as a possible solution to this problem. In this thesis, it is shown that by using a short Rayleigh length FEL, power densities at the mirrors are significantly reduced without causing a noticeable reduction in performance. For a short Rayleigh length FEL, the resonator cavity is sensitive to misalignment and vibration. The effect of mirror tilt due to vibrations is explored and the results show that as mirror tilt increases, FEL efficiency does decreases. However, a mirror tilt several orders of magnitude greater than currently achievable active alignment tolerances is required before the FEL efficiency is noticeably affected. In this thesis, it is shown that mirror <b>tilt</b> within achievable <b>tolerance</b> limits will not adversely affect the performance of a FEL. Lieutenant, United States Nav...|$|R

50|$|There {{are several}} {{issues related to}} the adverse {{environmental}} impact due to production of bananas. One issue is of waste management, particularly of plastic bags that are tied to the plants and the fruits during the stages of its growth. Of these bags, the blue colour bags are reported to have toxic effect of Chlorpyrifos, which are not controlled and found strewn all over the place. Aerial spraying of insecticides takes place with about 25 such cycles of spraying in a year. This is a major issue as the people both in the banana production process as in the spraying process are exposed to the toxic effects of such spraying. Not only the plantation but also houses, animals and water bodies are affected by the spray. Testing of water samples from affected areas has revealed calixin and also organophosphates. These toxics can lead to toxicant-induced loss of <b>tolerance</b> (<b>TILT).</b> While aerial spraying is one aspect of the problem manual spraying has much greater impact in the field as the task is sublet to contractors whose employees performing the task are not employed by the plantation and they use highly toxic products such as Mocap (Ethoprophos), and they usually work without any protective cover.|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} whether application of {{functional electric stimulation}} (FES) to lower-limb muscles during postural <b>tilting</b> improves orthostatic <b>tolerance</b> in people with tetraplegia. Design: A crossover design. Setting: A rehabilitation hospital. Participants: Sixteen acute and chronic subjects with tetraplegia (15 men, 1 woman) with complete motor function loss at the C 3 - 7 levels were recruited. Time since injury ranged from 2 to 324 months (mean, 118. 9 ± 104. 2 mo). Intervention: Subjects were tested on a progressive head-up tilting maneuver with and without the application of FES at 0 °, 15 °, 30 °, 45 °, 60 °, 75 °, and 90 ° continuously for up to 1 hour. FES was administered to 4 muscle groups including the quadriceps, hamstrings, tibialis anterior, and gastrocnemius muscles bilaterally at an intensity that provided a strong, visible, and palpable contraction. This was to produce a muscle pumping mechanism during the tilting maneuver. Main Outcome Measures: Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), heart rate, perceived presyncope score, and the overall duration of orthostatic tolerance, that is, the time that subjects could tolerate the tilting maneuver without developing severe hypotension or other intolerance symptoms. Results: When the tilt angle was increased, the subjects' SBP and DBP tended to decrease, whereas the heart rate tended to increase in both testing conditions. Adding FES to tilting significantly attenuated the drop in SBP by 3. 7 ± 1. 1 mmHg (P=. 005), the drop in DBP by 2. 3 ± 0. 9 mmHg (P=. 018), {{and the increase in}} heart rate by 1. 0 ± 0. 5 beats/min (P=. 039) for every 15 ° increment in the angle of the tilt. FES increased the overall mean standing time by 14. 3 ± 3. 9 min (P=. 003). Conclusions: An FES-induced leg muscle contraction is an effective adjunct treatment to delay orthostatic hypotension caused by tilting; it allows people with tetraplegia to stand up more frequently and for longer durations.

40|$|The REXEBIS is an Electron Beam Ion Source (EBIS) {{developed}} for charge breeding of the exotic and sometimes short-lived isotopes that are produced at ISOLDE for the REX-ISOLDE post accelerator. Bunches of singly charged radioactive ions are {{injected into the}} EBIS and charge bred to a charge-to-mass ratio of approximately ¼, and thereafter extracted and injected into a short 3 -stage LINAC for acceleration to a few MeV/u. This novel concept, employing a Penning trap to bunch and cool the ions from an on-line mass separator in combination with a charge breeding EBIS, should result in an efficient and compact system. The REXEBIS {{is based on a}} 0. 5 A electron beam produced in the fringe field of a magnetic solenoid, and compressed to a current density of > 200 A/cm 2. The 2 T magnetic field is provided by a warm-bore superconducting solenoid, thus giving easy accessibility but no cryogenic pumping. The EBIS is switched between 60 kV (ion injection) and ~ 20 kV (ion extraction). This thesis presents the design and construction of the REXEBIS, together with initial commissioning results. A complete ion injection, breeding and extraction cycle for an EBIS has been simulated to certify high injection and extraction efficiencies. The entire EBIS was modelled using an ion-tracing program, SIMION 3 D. Acceptance and emittance phase-spaces were determined for different source settings and ions types. Beam optics parameters such as: lens positions and voltages; accepted beam <b>tilt</b> and displacement <b>tolerances</b> at the focal points were settled. These simulations verified an analytically derived acceptance formula. General conclusions on acceptance, emittance and energy spread of an EBIS were drawn. The correlation between the two transverse emittance phase-spaces was shown to be small. Various experiments have been performed at an Electron Cyclotron Resonance Ion Source (ECRIS) in order to improve the ion yield. The source is operated in pulsed afterglow mode, and provides Pb 27 + ions to the CERN Heavy Ion Facility on an operational basis. With the aim to reach higher beam intensities, the effect of a pulsed biased disk was investigated with different pulse structure and voltage settings. Various plasma electrode geometries were tested, including operating the source without a plasma electrode. The use of CF 4 as mixing gas was explored, and high secondary electron emission materials were inserted inside the plasma chamber in an attempt to increase the cold electron density. No proof of absolute higher intensities was seen for any of these modifications. Nevertheless, the yield from a poorly tuned/low-performing source could readily be improved with bias voltage applied and the extracted pulse became less noisy. The fast response to the bias implies that increases/decreases are not due to ionisation processes. Finally, a design proposal utilising an EBIS for the ion pre-injector for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is presented. The LHCEBIS would produce lead ions, as well as lighter ions, that are directly injected into and further accelerated in an RFQ/LINAC arrangement. The source would operate with a repetition rate of 0. 8 Hz, and the extracted yield is estimated to 1. 6 · 10 9 Pb 54 + per pulse. Using fast extraction, the extraction time can be less than 10 µs, possibly allowing single-turn injection into the PS Booster...|$|R
