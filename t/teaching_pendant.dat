The performance of the teaching method using the force/moment direction sensor is compared with the conventional <b>teaching</b> <b>pendant</b> method.

Task A requires a teaching motion that involves four degrees of freedom motion. Task B requires a teaching motion that involves {{six degrees of freedom}} motion.

By introducing robots into the same working cell as the human, then the two can collaborate by letting the robot deal with heavy lifting, repetitive and high accuracy tasks while the human focuses on tasks that needs {{the flexibility of the}} human. Collaborative robots already exists today in the market but the usage of these robots are mainly to work in close proximity. Usually a <b>teaching</b> <b>pendant</b> is used to program a robot by moving it using a joystick or buttons. Using this <b>teaching</b> <b>pendant</b> for programming is usually quite slow and requires training which means that few can operate it. However, recent research shows that there exist several application using multi-modal communication systems to improve the programming of a robot. This kind of programming will be necessary to collaborate with a robot in the industry since the human in a collaborative task might have to teach the robot how to execute its task. This project aims to introduce a programming-by-guidance system into assembly manufacturing where the human can assist the robot by teaching the robot how to execute its task. Three technologies will be combined, speech recognition, haptic control, and augmented reality. The hypothesis is that with these three technologies an effective and intuitive programming-by-guidance system can be used within the assembly manufacturing industry. This project have three main motivators: Allowing workers, with no robot programming expertise, to teach the robot how to execute its task in an assembly manufacturing system; Reducing the development time of the robot by introducing advanced programming-by-guidance technology; Showing that augmented reality can add additional information that is useful when programming the robot.

30|$|This {{category}} of robotic programming includes lead-through and walk-through programming. Use of the manual online programming method requires no special hardware or software on-site {{other than that}} which {{is used for the}} manufacturing process. The major drawback of online programming is that it is quite inflexible and it is only able to control simple robot paths (Pan et al. 2012 a). In the walk-through method, the operator moves the torch manually through the desired sequence of movements, which are recorded into the memory for playback during welding. The walk-through method was adopted in a few early welding robots (Cary and Helzer 2005) but did not gain widespread use. The conventional method for programming welding robots is online programming {{with the help of a}} teach pendant, i.e., lead-through programming. In this approach, the programmer jogs the robot to the desired position with the use of control keys on the <b>teaching</b> <b>pendant</b> and the desired position and sequence of motions are recorded. The main disadvantage of the online teaching method is that the programming of the robot causes breaks in production during the programming phase (McWhirter 2012).|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Conventional robot motion {{teaching}} methods use a <b>teaching</b> <b>pendant</b> or a motion capture device {{and are not}} the most convenient or intuitive ways to teach a robot sophisticated and fluid movements such as martial arts motions. Ideally, a robot could be set up {{as if it were}} a clothing man-nequin that has light limbs and flexible yet frictional joints which can be positioned at desirable shape and hold all the positions. To do the same with a robot, an operator could pull or push the links with minor forces until the desired robot posture is attained. For this, a robot should measure the applied ex-ternal force by using torque sensors at the robot joints. However, torque sensors are bulky and expen-sive to install in every DOF joints while keeping a compact design, which is essential to humanoid ro-bots. In this paper, we use only motor current readings to acquire joint torques. The equations used to compensate for the effect of gravity on the joint torques and the self-calibration method to earn link pa-rameters are presented. Additionally, kinematic restrictions can be imposed on the robot’s arms to sim-plify the motion teaching. Here, we teach the Kendo training robot with this method and the robot’s learnt martial art motions are demonstrated...|$|E

This robot is equipped with six axes and a gripper. A few applications in which these robots are used are pick and place, soldering and welding. Apart from the movement of the robot, the controller also has the ability to read inputs or to control outputs. The robot can be controlled via the <b>teaching</b> <b>pendant</b> or via a PC with the running software on it. The Scorbot is controlled through serial communication (RS- 232). But as everyone knows, every medal has two sides. This also holds for this robot.

There is also an example compiler written in C# which has all available functions the robot can perform. This example code is available for the students.

30|$|Offline {{programming}} (OLP) with {{simulation software}} allows programming of the welding path and operation sequence {{from a computer}} {{rather than from the}} robot itself. 3 D CAD models of the workpieces, robots, and fixtures used in the cell are required for OLP. The simulation software matches these 3 D CAD models, permitting programming of the robot’s welding trajectory from a computer instead of a <b>teaching</b> <b>pendant</b> in the welding cell as in online programming. After simulation and testing of the program, the instructions can be exported from the computer to the robot controller via an Ethernet communication network. Ongoing research suggests, however, that the use of sensing technology would make it feasible to completely program the final trajectory only with OLP (Miller Electric Mfg Co. 2013). Pan et al. (2012 a) developed an automated offline programming method with software that allows automatic planning and programming (with CAD models as input) for a robotic welding system with high degrees of freedom without any programming effort. The main advantages of OLP are its reusable code, flexibility for modification, ability to generate complex paths, and reduction in production downtime in the programming phase for setup of a new part. Nevertheless, OLP is mostly used to generate complex robot paths for large production volumes because the time and cost required to generate code for complex robotic systems is similar to if not greater than with online programming (Pan et al. 2012 a). Currently, for a complex manufacturing process with small to median production volume, very few robotic automation solution are used to replace manual production due to this expensive and time-consuming programming overhead. Although OLP has the abovementioned advantages, it is not popular for small to median enterprise (SME) users due to its obvious drawbacks. It is difficult to economically justify an OLP for smaller product values due to the high cost of the OLP package and programming overhead required to customize the software for a specific application. Development of customized software for offline programming is time-consuming and requires high-level programming skills. Typically, these skills are not available from the process engineers and operators who often perform the robot programming in-process today. As OLP methods rely accurate modeling of the robot and work cell, additional calibration procedures using extra sensors are in many cases inevitable to meet requirements (Pan et al. 2012 b).|$|E
