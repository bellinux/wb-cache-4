40|$|The {{antihypertensive}} {{effect of}} a single oral dose of <b>tiapamil</b> (450 mg) and placebo were compared in a single blind randomized cross-over study in 10 71 - 86 year old hypertensive patients. Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) were recorded every 15 min for 12 h by an automatic device. <b>Tiapamil</b> led to a decrease in mean daytime systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) BP from 171 +/- 12 / 98 +/- 10 mm Hg to 159 +/- 11 / 90 +/- 9 mm Hg (P less than 0. 001) without significant variation in HR. Thereafter patients received <b>tiapamil</b> 450 twice daily; by the seventh day of treatment mean daytime SBP and DBP were 155 +/- 13 / 85 +/- 14 mm Hg (P less than 0. 001 vs placebo). The hourly mean values of SBP recorded for 8 / 12 h (first <b>tiapamil</b> day) and 10 / 12 h (seventh <b>tiapamil</b> day) were {{significantly lower than the}} corresponding values after placebo. We conclude that <b>tiapamil</b> in the elderly exerts a sustained antihypertensive effect lasting 12 h or more, with only minor variations in HR. This effect predominates on systolic pressure and is significant from the first dose...|$|E

40|$|Eleven patients, with {{recurrent}} paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias (PSVT) underwent programmed {{electrical stimulation}} of the heart to evaluate the efficacy of intravenous (i.) ̇ and oral <b>tiapamil</b> in these arrhythmias. The tachycardia circuit was confined to the atrio-ventricular (A V) node in 8 cases (group 1), and involved an overt or concealed accessory pathway for retrograde conduction in the 3 others (group 2). An i. v. bolus containing 2 mg kg'l body weight of <b>tiapamil</b> converted 6 of the 8 cases in group 1 from PSVT to normal sinus rhythm (NSR) within a few seconds, but {{failed to do so}} in any of the three patients in group 2. Both the oral and i. v. preparations significantly lengthened the shortest cycle length maintaining 1 : 1 AV conduction. I. v. administration also lengthened the corresponding value for 1 : 1 VA retrograde conduction. The oral and i. v. preparations were equally effective in preventing induction of PSVT in 6 / 8 patients in group 1, but failed in group 2. The efficacy of oral <b>tiapamil</b> in preventing such induction was also accurately predicted from the effect of the i. v. <b>tiapamil</b> on conversion to NSR. After the first week, the six successfull...|$|E
40|$|To {{clarify the}} {{pharmacological}} {{profile of the}} two new calcium channel blockers <b>tiapamil</b> and nisoldipine in humans, their acute effects as {{compared with those of}} the reference agent nifedipine were assessed in 10 normal subjects and 10 patients with essential hypertension. Blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), plasma and urinary catecholamine, sodium and potassium, plasma renin and aldosterone levels, and urinary prostaglandin E 2 and F 2 excretion rates were determined before and up to 4 or 5 h (urine values) after intravenous injection of placebo (20 ml 0. 9 % NaCl), <b>tiapamil</b> 1 mg/kg body weight, nisoldipine 6 micrograms/kg, or nifedipine 15 micrograms/kg. The four studies were performed at weekly intervals according to Latin square design. All three calcium channel blockers significantly (p less than 0. 05 or lower) lowered BP and distinctly increased sodium excretion in hypertensive patients, but had only little influence on these parameters in normal subjects. HR was increased in both groups. Changes in BP and HR were maximal at 5 min and largely dissipated 3 h after drug injection. Effects on BP and HR, as well as concomitant mild increases in plasma norepinephrine and renin levels that occurred in both groups, tended to be more pronounced (about double) following nisoldipine than following <b>tiapamil</b> or nifedipine at the dosages given. Plasma aldosterone, epinephrine levels, and prostaglandin excretion rates were not consistently modified. These findings demonstrate that <b>tiapamil</b> and nisoldipine possess distinct antihypertensive properties in humans. Different chronotropic and renin-activating effects of different calcium channel blockers may be determined, at least in part, by a different influence on sympathetic activity.

40|$|AbstractThe binding of the Ca 2 +-channel blocker d-cis-[3 H]diltiazem to {{guinea pig}} {{skeletal}} muscle microsomes is temperature-dependent. At 2 °C the KD is 39 nM and Bmax is 11 pmol/mg protein. The binding is fully reversible (K− 1 = 0. 02 min− 1). The binding sites discriminate between the diastereoisomers 1 - and d-cis-diltiazem, recognize verapamil, gallopamil and <b>tiapamil,</b> and {{are sensitive to}} La 3 +-inhibition. At 30 °C the KD is 37 nM and the Bmax is 2. 9 pmol/mg protein. D-cis-diltiazem-labelling is regulated by the 1, 4 -dihydropyridine Ca 2 +-channel blockers and a novel Ca 2 +-channel activator in a temperature-dependent manner. At 30 °C an enhancement of d-cis-diltiazem binding by the channel blockers is observed. This is attributed to a Bmax increase. EC 50 -values for enhancement and the maximal enhancement differ for the individual 1, 4 -dihydropyridines. At 2 °C 1, 4 -dihydropyridines inhibit d-cis-[3 H]diltiazem binding. This is attributed to a Bmax decrease. We have directly labelled one of the drug receptor sites within the Ca 2 +-channel which can allosterically interact with the 1, 4 -dihydropyridine binding sites...|$|E
40|$|Puromycin-resistant (PurR) mutants/variants {{of a human}} {{carcinoma}} {{cell line}} (HeLa), which show greatly reduced cellular uptake of 3 H-puromycin and 3 H-daunomycin have been isolated after one- and two-step selections in presence of the drug. The cross-resistance pattern of these mutant cell lines towards numerous anticancer drugs and other inhibitors has been examined. Both the first- and the second-step mutants exhibited increased resistance {{to a number of}} antimitotic drugs (viz. vinblastine, vincristine, colchicine, taxol and maytansine), several protein synthesis inhibitors (viz. chalcomycin, bruceantin, harringtonine, homoharringtonine), a large number of DNA interactive compounds (viz. aclacinomycin A, actinomycin D, adriamycin, m-AMSA, chromomycin A 3, coralyne sulphoacetate, daunomycin, ellipticine, mithramycin, mitoxantrone, 5 -methoxysterigmatocystin, rubidazone, variamycin, VM 26 and VP 16 - 213) {{and a number of other}} drugs acting via other mechanisms (viz. Baker's antifol, nitidine chloride and rhodamine 123). Whereas the first-step mutants showed stable resistance to these drugs, the second-step lines partially reverted upon growth in non-selective medium. Further, treatment of these mutant lines with non-cytotoxic doses of the calcium channel blocker verapamil reverted or abolished their resistance to the above drugs in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast to the above compounds, the PurR mutants showed no significant cross-resistance to a large number of other drugs which included asaley, AT- 125, 5 -azacytidine, azaserine, cyclocytidine, cis-platin, cytosine arabinoside, chlorambucil, chlorpromazine, alpha-difluoromethyl ornithine, 5 -fluorouracil, ftorafur, gallium nitrate, hydroxyurea, ICRF- 159, ICRF- 187, imipramine, methotraxate, 6 -methylmercaptopurine riboside, mycophenolic acid, melphalan, mitomycin C, methyl GAG, nafoxidine, reumycin, 6 -selenoguanosine, 6 -thioguanine, tiazofurin, tamoxifen, thalicarpine, <b>tiapamil</b> and verapamil). These cross-resistance data should prove useful in developing suitable drug combinations to which cellular resistance would not develop readily...|$|E
