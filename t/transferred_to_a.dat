5|$|Continuing {{to suffer}} from tuberculosis, Sudirman was checked into Panti Rapih hospital, where he stayed until October, when he was <b>transferred</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{sanatorium}} in nearby Pakem. As {{a result of his}} illness, Sudirman made few public appearances. Sudirman was <b>transferred</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> home in Magelang in December. In the meantime, the Indonesian and Dutch governments held a several-month-long conference which resulted in Dutch recognition of Indonesian sovereignty on 27December 1949. Sudirman, despite his illness, was reconfirmed that day as commander-in-chief of the TNI, now serving the newly established Republic of the United States of Indonesia. On 28December, Jakarta once again became the nation's capital.|$|E

40|$|Transfer (i. e., the {{application}} of a learned skill in a novel context) is an important and desirable outcome of motor skill learning. While much research has been devoted <b>to</b> understanding <b>transfer</b> of explicit skills the mechanisms of skill transfer after incidental learning remain poorly understood. The aim {{of this study was to}} 1) examine the effect of practice schedule on transfer and 2) investigate whether sequence-specific knowledge can <b>transfer</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> unfamiliar sequence context. We trained two groups of participants on an implicit serial response time task under a Constant (one sequence for 10 blocks) or Variable (alternating between two sequences for a total of 10 blocks) practice schedule. We evaluated response times for three types of transfer: task-general <b>transfer</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> structurally non-overlapping sequence, inter-manual <b>transfer</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> perceptually identical sequence, and sequence-specific <b>transfer</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> partially overlapping (3 shared triplets) sequence. Results showed partial skill <b>transfer</b> <b>to</b> all three sequences and an advantage of Variable practice only for task-general transfer. Further, we found expression of sequence-specific knowledge for familiar sub-sequences in the overlapping sequence. These findings suggest that 1) constant practice may create interference for task-general transfer and 2) sequence-specific knowledge can <b>transfer</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> new sequential context...|$|R

Secondary fermentation is used when the beer requires long storage before packaging or greater clarity. When the beer has fermented, it is packaged either into casks for cask ale or kegs, aluminium cans, or bottles for other sorts of beer.|$|E
