The apes have been extensively studied for <b>their</b> <b>learning</b> abilities. There may even be distinctive cultures within populations. Field studies of the apes were pioneered by primatologist Birutė Galdikas. All three orangutan species are considered to be critically endangered. Human activities have caused severe declines in populations and ranges. Threats to wild orangutan populations include poaching, habitat destruction, and the illegal pet trade. Several conservation and rehabilitation organisations are dedicated to the survival of orangutans in the wild.|$|E

He taught at Dallas High School (1896-7) and worked in the clerk’s office of the Bastrop County Court before winning his 1898 scholarship to Harvard. With a thesis on measurement of wavelength of shortwaves he gained the Ph.D. in 1900.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{describe}} a family literacy program attempting to teach adult English language learners (ELL) the knowledge and skills that would allow them to support <b>their</b> children's <b>learning</b> at home. The methodology employed was a multi-case study. Fourteen adult participants were interviewed to gather information regarding the factors that influenced the adult participant's ability to support <b>their</b> child's <b>learning</b> prior to participation in the family literacy program. The study focused on the knowledge, skills and attitudes acquired in the literacy program and used to support <b>their</b> child's <b>learning</b> at home and the curriculum and instruction that the participants used to influence <b>their</b> child's <b>learning.</b> The methodology used to gather information included adult English language learner interviews, field observations, and contact analysis of lesson plans. The following conclusions were derived based on analysis of the data: 1. In the family literacy program that was studied, the only prior factor that appeared to influence the parent's ability to support <b>their</b> child's <b>learning</b> was the education level of the participant. 2. Pronunciation, conversation, listening, grammar and writing are are essential skills that ELL parents use to support <b>their</b> child's <b>learning.</b> Attitudes were directly affected by the participants' ability to master the English language in order to be able to guide their children through the U. S. educational system. 3. The curriculum supported the learning; however the instruction was vital to modeling the procedures for learning that the participants used to support their children's success in school. 4. Regardless of other factors such as marital status, occupation, and other variations in family background, all participants based their ability to support <b>their</b> child's <b>learning</b> on <b>their</b> own ability to master the English language...|$|R
