25|$|McKenna was a {{colleague}} and {{close friend of}} chaos mathematician Ralph Abraham, and author and biologist Rupert Sheldrake. He conducted several public and many private debates with them from 1982 until his death. These debates were known as <b>trialogues</b> {{and some of the}} discussions were later published in the books: <b>Trialogues</b> at the Edge of the West and The Evolutionary Mind.|$|R

[...] In 1987, he was recognized by the Pomona Valley Council of Churches for outstanding leadership in ecumenical affairs. That year he was also among the nominees considered to replace Robert Rusack as bishop of the diocese, a position that ultimately went to Frederick Borsch.|$|E
50|$|A <b>trialogue</b> or formal <b>trialogue</b> {{meeting is}} a type of meeting used in the European Union (EU) {{legislative}} process. <b>Trialogue</b> negotiations are provided for in EU treaties. They are used if the Council of the European Union does not agree to the amendments proposed by the European Parliament at the second reading. In this case, formal <b>trialogue</b> negotiations are carried out within the framework of a conciliation committee. A <b>trialogue</b> is understood as an equally composite tripartite meeting between those involved in the legislative process of the EU institutions. These bodies are the European Commission (EC), the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament. The European Commission takes on the mediating function.|$|E

40|$|The {{legality}} of self-defence against non-state actors is currently {{one of the}} most contested issues of the jus contra bellum. How should we interpret state practice – has it already given rise, in law, to a broader concept of self-defence, or is the traditional state centred view still good law? Under which specific requirements should self-defence against non-state actors, if at all, be regarded as lawful and how can an abuse of an extended right to self-defence be prevented? The “Impulses from the Max Planck <b>Trialogues</b> on the Law of Peace and War” consist of short essays dealing with these questions...|$|R

40|$|At {{the heart}} of this article is a piece of {{participatory}} research around art walking practice. Presented as a pair on interleaved <b>trialogues,</b> the aim is to capture the experience of participation and the array of interactions, debates and perspectives uncovered whilst walking the wateryscape and subsequently. Undertaken as a piece of performative and transversal writing, the aim here is to open up, but refuse to resolve, questions of ways of representing the wet, of emotional and communal resilience and of the position of an art walking practice in representing marginalized and watery, human and non-human voices. In resisting closure and in foregrounding the ‘always in the making’ nature of walking practice (growing knowledge by following a path), the article faces the unresolved future of a people yet to come. The assertion is that walking the liminal is both an unsettling and unsettled practice that is only emphasized when the walk is performed in the wateryscape...|$|R
40|$|We tested key {{predictions}} of a theoretical model positing that confusion, which accompanies {{a state of}} cognitive disequilibrium that is triggered by contradictions, conflicts, anomalies, erroneous information, and other discrepant events, can be beneficial to learning if appropriately induced, regulated, and resolved. Hypotheses of the model were tested in two experiments where learners engaged in <b>trialogues</b> on scientific reasoning concepts in a simulated collaborative learning session with animated agents {{playing the role of}} a tutor and a peer student. Confusion was experimentally induced via a contradictory-information manipulation involving the animated agents expressing incorrect and/or contradictory opinions and asking the (human) learners to decide which opinion had more scientific merit. The results indicated that self-reports of confusion were largely insensitive to the manipulations. However, confusion was manifested by more objective measures that inferred confusion on the basis of learners’ responses immediately following contradictions. Furthermore, whereas the contradictions had no effect on learning when learners were not confused by the manipulations, performance on multiple-choice posttests and on transfer tests was substantially higher when the contradictions were successful in confusing learners. Theoretical and applied implications are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Although {{consultation}} {{is a key}} legislative procedure, it is {{the subject}} of few studies in comparison to codecision/ordinary legislative procedure. This lacuna can be explained by a widespread, rationalist thesis shared by a majority of EU researchers that consultation is scientifcally trivial as the European Parliament has limited power to give non-binding opinions for the Commission proposals; therefore, the main decision-maker is the Council that decides whether to incorporate or ignore the EP’s amendments in the legislative act. But this leads to a paradoxical situation – we still do not know anything about the course and effects of procedure that generates the most legislation. The article is an attempt to fill the above-mentioned gap. By using the constructivist perspective, it shows that despite the formal limitations in consultation, the Parliament has many informal instruments which it can use to reinforce its demands successively. For example, it is able to affect the shape of the project at the preparatory phase, delay its opinion and, thus, block the entire legislative process, get Commission’s support for its amendments in order to persuade the Council to incorporate its demands, and use argumentative and socialization effects during direct, secret talks in <b>trialogues</b> with the Council and the Commission. Therefore, under certain conditions, the Parliament can acquire dominant position in consultation...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY. Aims To review {{developments}} in recovery-focussed {{mental health services}} internationally. Methods Two forms of recovery which {{have been used in}} the literature are considered, and international examples of recovery-focussed initiatives reviews. A litmus test for a recovery-focussed service is proposed. Results Clinical recovery has emerged from professional literature, focuses on sustained remission and restoration of functioning, is invariant across individuals, and has been used to establish rates of recovery. Personal recovery has emerged from consumer narratives, focuses on living a satisfying, hopeful and contributing life even with limitations caused by the illness, varies across individuals, and the empirical evidence base relates to stages of change more than overall prevalence rates. Clinical and personal recovery are different. Two innovative, generalisable and empirically investigated examples are given of implementing a focus on personal recovery: the Collaborative Recovery Model in Australia, and <b>Trialogues</b> in German-speaking Europe. The role of medication is an indicator: services in which all service users are prescribed medication, in which the term compliance is used, in which the reasoning bias is present of attributing improvement to medication and deterioration to the person, and in which contact with and discussion about the service user revolves around medication issues, are not personal recovery-focussed services. Conclusions The term Recovery has been used in different ways, so conceptual clarity is important. Developing a focus on personal recovery is more than a cosmetic change it will entailfundamental shifts in the values of mental health services...|$|R
