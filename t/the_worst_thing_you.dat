2500|$|When the 1974 {{recording}} of the song was reaching {{number one on the}} country charts, Elvis Presley indicated that he wanted to cover the song. Parton was interested until Presley's manager, Colonel Tom Parker, told her that it was standard procedure for the songwriter to sign over half of the publishing rights to any song Elvis recorded. Parton refused. She recalls:I said, 'I'm really sorry,' and I cried all night. I mean, it was like <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>thing.</b> <b>You</b> know, it's like, Oh, my God … Elvis Presley.' And other people were saying, 'You're nuts. It's Elvis Presley.' ...I said, 'I can't do that. Something in my heart says, 'Don't do that. And I just didn't do it... He would have killed it.

Li Zhuang, a lawyer who was imprisoned as part of the [...] "Striking Black" [...] policy, said that [...] "the Chongqing model is problematic because the city's leaders do not follow the rule of law". According to Andrew J. Nathan, a political scientist at Columbia University, [...] "the risk for China is that this scandal could taint everyone in power and challenge the legitimacy of the regime".

500|$|MacArthur {{remains a}} {{controversial}} and enigmatic figure. He has been {{portrayed as a}} reactionary, although he was in many respects ahead of his time. He championed a progressive approach to the reconstruction of Japanese society, arguing that all occupations ultimately ended badly for the occupier and the occupied. He was often {{out of step with}} his contemporaries, such as in 1941 when he contended that Nazi Germany could not defeat the Soviet Union, when he argued that North Korea and China were no mere Soviet puppets, and throughout his career in his insistence that the future lay in the Far East. This implicitly rejected White American contemporary notions of their own racial superiority. He always treated Filipino and Japanese leaders with respect as equals. At the same time, his Victorian sensibilities recoiled at leveling Manila with aerial bombing, an attitude the hardened World War II generation regarded as old fashioned. When asked about MacArthur, Field Marshal Sir Thomas Blamey once said that [...] "The best and <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> hear about him are both true." ...|$|R

[...] As if this word had reminded her of her head, she turned it from side to side, and got the effect in the glass, first of one ear-ring, and then of the other. Her husband patiently waited, and she now confronted him. [...] "You may as well know first as last, Henshaw, and I want you to prepare yourself for it. Nothing can be done, and you will just have to live through it. Lydia--has come over--on that ship--alone,--with three young men,--and not the shadow--not the ghost--of another woman--on board!" [...] Mrs. Erwin gesticulated with her hand-glass in delivering the words, in a manner at once intensely vivid and intensely solemn, yet somehow falling short of the due tragic effect. Her husband stood pulling his mustache straight down, while his wife turned again to the mirror, and put the final touches to her personal appearance with hands which she had the effect of having desperately washed of all responsibility. He stood so long in this meditative mood that she was obliged to be peremptory with his image in the glass. [...] "Well?" [...] she cried.|$|E
60|$|This {{gratuitous}} {{contribution of}} a humorous character occasioned {{a fair amount}} of laughter among his entourage. As regards Bloom he, without the faintest suspicion of a smile, merely gazed {{in the direction of the}} door and reflected upon the historic story which had aroused extraordinary interest at the time when the facts, to make matters worse, were made public with the usual affectionate letters that passed between them full of sweet nothings. First it was strictly Platonic till nature intervened and an attachment sprang up between them till bit by bit matters came to a climax and the matter became the talk of the town till the staggering blow came as a welcome intelligence to not a few evildisposed, however, who were resolved upon encompassing his downfall though the thing was public property all along though not to anything like the sensational extent that it subsequently blossomed into. Since their names were coupled, though, since he was her declared favourite, where was the particular necessity to proclaim it to the rank and file from the housetops, the fact, namely, that he had shared her bedroom which came out in the witnessbox on oath when a thrill went through the packed court literally electrifying everybody in the shape of witnesses swearing to having witnessed him on such and such a particular date in the act of scrambling out of an upstairs apartment with the assistance of a ladder in night apparel, having gained admittance in the same fashion, a fact the weeklies, addicted to the lubric a little, simply coined shoals of money out of. Whereas the simple fact of the case was it was simply a case of the husband not being up to the scratch, with nothing in common between them beyond the name, and then a real man arriving on the scene, strong to the verge of weakness, falling a victim to her siren charms and forgetting home ties, the usual sequel, to bask in the loved one's smiles. The eternal question of the life connubial, needless to say, cropped up. Can real love, supposing there happens to be another chap in the case, exist between married folk? Poser. Though it was no concern of theirs absolutely if he regarded her with affection, carried away by a wave of folly. A magnificent specimen of manhood he was truly augmented obviously by gifts of a high order, as compared with the other military supernumerary that is (who was just the usual everyday farewell, my gallant captain kind of an individual in the light dragoons, the 18th hussars to be accurate) and inflammable doubtless (the fallen leader, that is, not the other) in his own peculiar way which she of course, woman, quickly perceived as highly likely to carve his way to fame which he almost bid fair to do till the priests and ministers of the gospel as a whole, his erstwhile staunch adherents, and his beloved evicted tenants for whom he had done yeoman service in the rural parts of the country by taking up the cudgels on their behalf in a way that exceeded their most sanguine expectations, very effectually cooked his matrimonial goose, thereby heaping coals of fire on his head much in the same way as the fabled ass's kick. Looking back now in a retrospective kind of arrangement all seemed a kind of dream. And then coming back was <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> ever did because it went without saying you would feel out of place as things always moved with the times. Why, as he reflected, Irishtown strand, a locality he had not been in for quite a number of years looked different somehow since, as it happened, he went to reside on the north side. North or south, however, it was just the wellknown case of hot passion, pure and simple, upsetting the applecart with a vengeance and just bore out the very thing he was saying as she also was Spanish or half so, types that wouldn't do things by halves, passionate abandon of the south, casting every shred of decency to the winds.|$|E

During the late 1980s, Duran began to have private misgivings about the advisability of a military solution to obtaining regime change in Cuba. Duran did not go public with his doubts until the early 1990s, after the fall of Soviet Union. Duran's former comrades were outraged that {{a former president of the}} Veteran's Association of Brigade 2506 was advocating peaceful dialogue with the communist government of Cuba. Duran told Frontline: [...] "To the right wing or more conservative community here in Miami, a dialogado is <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>thing</b> that <b>you</b> could be called. It implies that you're a traitor." [...] The Veteran's Association of Brigade 2506 expelled Duran in a public rebuke in 1993.|$|R

JoJo described the song being about [...] "a relationship, this young passionate love that takes a turn for <b>the</b> <b>worst.</b> This <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> once held in your hand just slips out of your control and turns into a disaster, but what I love about this song is that there's the sense at the end there's a whole world out there to explore, just because a relationship is over doesn't mean that your world is over. There's that {{light at the end}} of the tunnel and the song is just more aggressive than the pop records I've come out with before."

5000|$|In May 2011, The {{producer}} {{began working}} on Channel 4's soap opera Hollyoaks as the acting series editor. Producer replaced Gareth Philips as the series producer. Smithwick's first episode {{in which she was}} credited as series producer aired on 26 December 2011. Philips introduced the sixth form students and the uni students into the show and Smithwick continued to keep them at the centre, with the aim of creating a more realistic portrayal of university life through the introduction of these characters and focussing on the friendship groups rather than just on families. Talking about her vision for the show, the producer said: [...] "through the stories that we're telling and the way we're telling them, we want the audience to really engage with the characters. It definitely takes time but when that happens, it means <b>you</b> can do <b>things</b> with the characters and the viewers will really care.

She supported Croatian Operation Storm, but wasn't satisfied with President Tuđman's decision to stop near Banja Luka because she thought that he had to defeat remaining Serbian forces.

5000|$|The two men {{knew each}} other because Robinson wrote scripts for Rafferty's radio show, Chips: the Story of Outback. They decided to team up {{together}} and make a film that cost under £10,000, with Robinson directing and Rafferty starring. They were joined by cinematographer George Heath and formed Platypus Productions. Said Rafferty at the time:We nutted it out this way. What's the good of imitating English and American pictures when we can get into places these foreign production units can't reach for sandflies and skeeters? We'll pick locations and backgrounds the world knows nothing about. We'll study them for dramatic values. But we're not buying stories. The stories will {{just come out of}} our heads and still leave enough wood to make chairs.Robinson later elaborated:We said, [...] "Let's forget what the Australian public thinks about, what they might take to, because if you put an Australian tag on a film it was <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> possible <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> could do." [...] You see we were on a third-rate level as far as the public was concerned in comparison to imported films from anywhere. The thing was to try and go for different locales and different lines, new material but fairly standard in the international approach. I remember a motto that we used to remind ourselves of. It was something that Les Norman (the producer of Eureka Stockade) said to us. [...] "If you are working in a known background like London or New York you can go for very different story lines, but if you are working in a new background that is unfamiliar to your audience {{you have to be a}} bit conventional in your story line because audiences find it difficult to accept a totally new background and a really new story line at the same time." [...] So I think there was a bit of that inherent in all of those early films with Chips. We always went for the unusual background and therefore didn’t try to get terribly tricky with the story lines.It was decided to make the film in the Northern Territory where Robinson had worked for a number of years.|$|R

Deriving its name from the animal of the same name, [...] "Skunk" [...] is dispersed as a form of yellow mist, fired from a water cannon, which leaves a powerful odor similar to rot or sewage on whatever it touches. Skunk is also sold in handheld canisters and in grenades which can be thrown or fired as projectiles (see riot gun). The company later marketed Skunk to law enforcement agencies worldwide, specifically American local police departments. Several US police departments, including the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department, purchased it.A BBC reporter describes its effects as follows:“Imagine <b>the</b> <b>worst,</b> most foul <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> have ever smelled.

Your gag reflex goes off the charts and you can't escape, because the nauseating stench persists for days.However, when tested elsewhere in the world, the product failed miserably:We used it on a captive crowd consisting of CRPF personnel and general public.
