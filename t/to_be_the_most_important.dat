Contrary to popular belief, the Wood Badge beads have never been made of Gilwell Oak. On the Training Ground sits the Gidney Cabin, a memorial to the first Camp Chief, Francis Gidney, in 1929. Across from the Gidney Cabin is the Thurman Memorial, in memory of Camp Chief John Thurman.|$|E

5|$|In about 1840, L. decemlineata {{adopted the}} {{cultivated}} potato into its host range and it rapidly became a most destructive pest of potato crops. They are today considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> insect defoliator of potatoes. They may also cause significant damage to tomato and eggplant crops with both adults and larvae feeding on the plant's foliage. Larvae may defoliate potato plants resulting in yield losses {{of up to}} 100% if the damage occurs prior to tuber formation. Larvae may consume 40cm2 of potato leaves during the entire larval stage, but adults are capable of consuming 10cm2 of foliage per day.|$|E

5|$|Traditionally, {{the absence}} of crystal flaws is {{considered}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> quality of a diamond. Purity and high crystalline perfection make diamonds transparent and clear, whereas its hardness, optical dispersion (luster) and chemical stability (combined with marketing), make it a popular gemstone. High thermal conductivity is also important for technical applications. Whereas high optical dispersion is an intrinsic property of all diamonds, their other properties vary {{depending on how the}} diamond was created.|$|E
5|$|Mortality is {{high for}} eggs and hatchlings, and nests face threats from floods, overheating, and predators. Flooding {{is a major}} cause of failure of {{crocodilians}} to breed successfully, as nests are submerged, developing embryos are deprived of oxygen, and juveniles get washed away. One of the chief predators of alligators' eggs in Florida is the raccoon, which is attracted by olfactory cues after the nest has been disturbed by turtles. The Florida black bear also raids alligator eggs. In Africa, mongooses, honey badgers, baboons, otters, warthogs, bushpigs, and spotted hyenas are all fond of crocodile eggs, but the monitor lizard is thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> nest raider. This lizard is also a major hazard in Asia, where other egg predators include civets, mongooses, rats, sloth bears, jackals, and dogs.|$|E

5|$|Reviews of the Nintendo DSi were {{generally}} positive; although IGN and bit-tech decried the console's lack of exclusive software and {{removal of the}} GBA cartridge slot, its added functionality caused many journalists to recommend it {{to those who had}} not purchased a previous DS model. Numerous critics were disappointed with the limited resolution of DSi's cameras, though others such as Ars Technica and GameSpot agreed they were adequate for the handheld's display. CNET and PCWorld considered the DSi Shop <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> buying incentive for current DS owners. Some critics believed the DSi XL was not an essential upgrade. GamePro and Wired UK, on the other hand, praised the DSi XL's larger screens for improving the gaming experience and revitalizing older DS games.|$|E
5|$|The Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources is {{responsible}} for general strategy in {{the oil and gas}} sectors and for monitoring the state-owned oil company, Saudi Aramco. The oil, gas and refining industries in Saudi Arabia are controlled by law by Saudi Aramco, which has a near monopoly in these areas. It is the world's biggest oil producer, the Middle East's biggest company and is generally considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> energy company in the world. However, in 2003, the law was changed to allow foreign companies to look for Saudi Arabia's vast reserves of natural gas, believed to represent 4% of the world's reserves. This was {{the first time since the}} 1970s that foreign companies have been permitted to search for oil or gas.|$|E
5|$|The first phase, {{known as}} the ‘orange phase’, was {{considered}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> because it provided South Vietnamese units in I Corps with a platform to stop enemy attacks, and even attack them if necessary. To accomplish {{the objectives of the}} ‘orange phase’, General Trưởng placed several elite combat units such as the Ranger groups and armoured forces on constant combat alert. The second phase, {{known as the}} ‘green phase’, was designed to delay enemy forces and buy more time for the South Vietnamese to regroup in order to stage a counter-attack, in the scenario that enemy forces managed to overcome the ‘orange phase’. In the final phase, or the ‘blue phases’, require South Vietnamese units to secure their areas of defence, then destroy and push enemy forces out of I Corps.|$|E

5|$|Time {{is in the}} Chicago Park District, in the Washington Park {{community}} area on Chicago's South Side, {{near the}} Midway Plaisance. This location, adjoining the University of Chicago campus directly to the East, makes the sculpture a contributing structure to the Washington Park federal Registered Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Time is considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> piece of monumental art in the Park District, which hosts over 100 art works. Its importance stems from its sculptor, its message, the era {{in which it was}} created, and the design of its reflecting pool by Howard Van Doren Shaw. Robert Jones, director of design and construction for the Art Institute of Chicago at the time, stated in 1999 that Time was the first finished art piece to be made of any type of concrete.|$|E
5|$|Torajans perform dances {{on several}} occasions, most often during their {{elaborate}} funeral ceremonies. They dance {{to express their}} grief, and to honour and even cheer the deceased person because {{he is going to}} have a long journey in the afterlife. First, a group of men form a circle and sing a monotonous chant throughout the night to honour the deceased (a ritual called Ma'badong). This is considered by many Torajans <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> component of the funeral ceremony. On the second funeral day, the Ma'randing warrior dance is performed to praise the courage of the deceased during life. Several men perform the dance with a sword, a large shield made from buffalo skin, a helmet with a buffalo horn, and other ornamentation. The Ma'randing dance precedes a procession in which the deceased is carried from a rice barn to the rante, the site of the funeral ceremony. During the funeral, elder women perform the Ma'katia dance while singing a poetic song and wearing a long feathered costume. The Ma'akatia dance is performed to remind the audience of the generosity and loyalty of the deceased person. After the bloody ceremony of buffalo and pig slaughter, a group of boys and girls clap their hands while performing a cheerful dance called Ma'dondan.|$|E
