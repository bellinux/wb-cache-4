5|$|There remains some {{uncertainty}} {{whether the}} source test or nature test {{ought to be}} <b>the</b> <b>determining</b> test. It appears, though, {{that the impact of}} Datafin remains qualified in the light of other decisions where the source of the power was held to be <b>the</b> <b>determining</b> factor. It is also worth noting that the effect of the nature test is greatly restricted in practice due to the insistence on the difference between contractual and governmental powers. Where there is a contractual relationship between an aggrieved person and the body making a decision affecting the person, this tends to place the dispute on the private law side of the public–private divide, making the decision not amenable to judicial review.|$|E
5|$|Males become {{extremely}} aggressive during musth. Size is <b>the</b> <b>determining</b> factor in agonistic encounters when the individuals {{have the same}} condition. In contests between musth and non-musth individuals, musth bulls win {{the majority of the}} time, even when the non-musth bull is larger. A male may stop showing signs of musth when he encounters a musth male of higher rank. Those of equal rank tend to avoid each other. Agonistic encounters typically consist of threat displays, chases, and minor sparring with the tusks. Serious fights are rare.|$|E
5|$|The Council of Indigenous Peoples {{consider}} several limited {{factors in}} a successful formal petition. <b>The</b> <b>determining</b> factors include collecting member genealogies, group histories {{and evidence of}} a continued linguistic and cultural identity. The lack of documentation and the extinction of many indigenous languages {{as the result of}} colonial cultural and language policies have made the prospect of official recognition of many ethnicities a remote possibility. Current trends in ethno-tourism have led many former Plains Aborigines to continue to seek cultural revival.|$|E

5|$|The governor's {{relationship}} with the General Assembly has typically been <b>the</b> <b>determining</b> factor in his success at enacting his agenda, although other factors also play an important role. In most of Indiana's history, the governor has come to power {{at a time in}} which his party controlled the assembly. Since the political parties first became dominant in 1831 and until 2010, thirty-three sessions of the legislature have been divided with different parties controlling the House and Senate. Only five sessions have occurred where the legislature was entirely controlled by the opposition party, while in ninety-eight sessions the governor's party controlled the entire assembly.|$|E

5|$|Hume {{became a}} major figure in the sceptical {{philosophical}} and empiricist traditions of philosophy. He and other Scottish Enlightenment thinkers developed {{what he called a}} 'science of man', which was expressed historically in works by authors including James Burnett, Adam Ferguson, John Millar and William Robertson, all of whom merged a scientific study of how humans behave in ancient and primitive cultures with a strong awareness of <b>the</b> <b>determining</b> forces of modernity. Indeed, modern sociology largely originated from this movement. Adam Smith developed and published The Wealth of Nations, the first work on modern economics. It had an immediate impact on British economic policy and still frames 21st century discussions on globalisation and tariffs. The focus of the Scottish Enlightenment ranged from intellectual and economic matters to the specifically scientific as in the work of William Cullen, physician and chemist, James Anderson, an agronomist, Joseph Black, physicist and chemist, and James Hutton, the first modern geologist. While the Scottish Enlightenment is traditionally considered to have concluded {{toward the end of the}} 18th century, disproportionately large Scottish contributions to British science and letters continued for another 50 years or more, thanks to such figures as James Hutton, James Watt, William Murdoch, James Clerk Maxwell, Lord Kelvin and Sir Walter Scott.|$|E

25|$|Briefly, {{through his}} two theories, the Simple Control Theory and Initial Control Theory, Wilson {{is able to}} contrast, and {{therefor}} better define, the usage of the possessive particles, a and o. The Simple Control Theory speculates that <b>the</b> <b>determining</b> factor directly correlated to the possessor’s control over the object; emphasizing a dominant vs. less-dominant relationship. Old Rapa adheres closer to the latter of Wilson’s two theories, the Initial Control Theory. This theory speculates that “the possessor’s control over the initiation of the possessive relationship is <b>the</b> <b>determining</b> factor.” Here, his Initial Control Theory can also be generally expanded to the whole Polynesian language family in terms of better describing the “alienability” of possession.|$|E

25|$|Systematics is {{the branch}} of biology that {{attempts}} to establish genealogical relationships among organisms. It is also concerned with their classification.

Another segments are selected from the former segments based on a given criteria and three dimensional data associated with the selected segments are <b>determined.</b> <b>The</b> component is adjusted based on <b>the</b> <b>determined</b> data and <b>the</b> position of an object, {{which is to be}} selected, is <b>determined</b> from <b>the</b> <b>determined</b> position of component.
