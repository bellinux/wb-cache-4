5|$|After Lincoln's {{assassination}} in April 1865, {{black ink}} was thrown on Fillmore's house {{as it was}} not draped in mourning like others, though he was apparently out of <b>town</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time and put black drapes in the windows once he returned. Although he retained his position as Buffalo's leading citizen and was among those selected to escort the body when Lincoln's funeral train passed through Buffalo, there was still anger against him for his wartime positions. Fillmore supported President Andrew Johnson's Reconstruction policies, feeling that the nation needed to be reconciled as quickly as possible. Most of his time was devoted to his civic activities. He aided Buffalo in becoming the third American city, after Boston and Philadelphia, to have a permanent art gallery with the Buffalo Fine Arts Academy.|$|E

The city {{included}} the whole tell and a lower <b>town</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{southern edge of the}} mound.

The building of area FS included its own temple and might have served as a caravanserai, being located near the northern gate of the city. The early Akkadian monarchs were occupied with internal conflicts, and Tell Brak was temporarily abandoned by Akkad at some point preceding the reign of Naram-Sin. The abandonment might be connected with an environmental event, that caused the desertification of the region.|$|E

5|$|The shore at Clevedon is {{a mixture}} of pebbled beaches and low rocky cliffs, with the old harbour being at {{the western edge of the}} <b>town</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> mouth of the Land Yeo river.

The minerals identified at the site include: haematite, chalcopyrite, tennantite, galena, tetrahedrite, bornite, pyrite, marcasite, enargite and sphalerite. Secondary alteration of this assemblage has produced idaite, covellite and other copper sulfides. The nearest parking to the pier entrance is on an esplanade above the rocky beach.|$|E
