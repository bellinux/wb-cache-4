40|$|Choose Lean for Better Health Trim the {{fat from}} meat {{and the skin}} from poultry before eating. An average portion of meat is about 4 ozs. Once trimmed, cheaper cuts of meat are as nutritious as {{expensive}} ones. If the meat is tough, cook it longer in stews and casseroles (to tenderise before cooking, spoon a little vinegar over raw meat and leave to marinade for 30 minutes). Chicken portions can be economical {{as there is no}} waste. • Choose Fish More Often Fish is quick to prepare, cook and easy to digest. Try eating oily fish, which is rich in vitamin D, once a week. It can be fresh, vacuum packed or <b>tinned,</b> (e. g. <b>mackerel,</b> herring, sardines, pilchards, tuna or salmon). • Eggs Two eggs can be used instead of one serving of meat, poultry or fish for a main meal. Eggs can be scrambled, boiled, poached or occasionally fried in a little oil. • Don't Forget Your Dairy Foods Bones of all ages need calcium. Choose dairy products such as milk, yogurt or cheese and have three servings every day. If you are watching your weight, choose low fat varieties. • Spice it Up Taste food before adding flavourings. Herbs, spices and pepper can be used more often as alternatives to salt...|$|R
