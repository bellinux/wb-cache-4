5|$|After seeing Marge and Ruth again while cooking {{breakfast on}} his car engine, Wiggum {{continues}} his chase of the two, aided by other Springfield Police vehicles. After noticing a cliff ahead, Homer believes that Marge and Ruth are attempting suicide because of him and, using a megaphone, apologizes to Marge for all the mistakes he has made in their marriage and urges them not to drive into the chasm. Ruth, who had not noticed the chasm, slams on the brakes and stops in time; however, Homer and Wiggum fail to stop and fly over <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cliff</b> only to crash into a landfill.

5|$|On January 10, 1935, the {{building}} shifted to within 2.5 feet from <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cliff</b> following a landslide {{caused by a}} severe storm. The warden at the time, James A. Johnston, proposed extend the seawall next to it and asked the Bureau for $6500 to fund it; he would later claim to dislike {{the building}} because it was irregularly shaped. A smaller, cheaper riprap was completed {{by the end of}} 1935. A guard tower and a catwalk from Hill Tower was added to the roof of the Industries Building in June 1936 and the building was made secure with bars from old cells to bar the windows and grill the roof ventilators and to prevent inmates from escaping from the roof. It ceased use as a laundry in 1939 when it was moved to the upper floor of the New Industries Building. Today the building is heavily rusted after decades of exposure to the salt air and wind, and neither the guard tower on top of the building nor the Hill Tower still exist.|$|E

Blanton, the U.S. commander at Lima Site 85, was killed alongside two other U.S. technicians. Those who were not killed retreated to {{the west side of the}} mountain, where they hid on <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cliff.</b> From their hideout, the U.S. technicians fired on the North Vietnamese with their M-16 rifles and hand grenades. At 04:15, in response to the gunfire from the U.S. technicians, Muc ordered Cell 5 to reinforce Cell 3, and they captured the TACAN installation at 04:30 after 45 minutes of fighting. Meanwhile, Cell 4 had great difficulties in their attempt to seize the airstrip, where they were blocked by a Hmong mortar position. Le Ba Chom, the commander of Cell 4, was isolated from the other three soldiers of his cell. To avoid being captured alive by the numerically superior Hmong forces, Chom and his soldiers held onto their position and fought till daybreak.|$|E

25|$|As well as {{a source}} of galena, the mine near Port Gorey {{returned}} both lead and silver. Discovered by chance during a rabbit hunt in 1836, industry around this mine led to the construction of a small gauge railway and the installation of steam pumps. The mine is believed to have had a length of 2,000 feet/600m and depth of 700 feet/200m. Close to the port there were four shafts leading to the galleries. Sark's Hope shaft was the westernmost, almost on <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cliff.</b> To the East was Le Pelley shaft, excavated down to 90fathoms below sea level, then the Pump shaft and the easternmost shaft, the Prince's shaft.|$|E

25|$|In 2004, Kilwa Kisiwani was {{inscribed on}} UNESCO's List of World Heritage in Danger. There {{is a serious}} rapid {{deterioration}} of the archaeological and monumental heritage of these two islands due to various agents like erosion and vegetation. The eastern section of the Palace of Husuni Kubwa, for example, is progressively disappearing. The damage to the soil caused by rainwater wash is accentuating the risks of collapse of the remaining structures on <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cliff.</b> The vegetation that proliferates on the cliff has limited the progression of the rain-wash effect, but causes the break-up of the masonry structures.

25|$|From 22 January, the {{day before}} the attack on No.3 Redoubt, Pratt began {{employing}} the Royal Engineers to systematically apply the technique of sapping to advance towards Te Arei. Excavating through night and day under frequent fire, Pratt's sap extended 768 yards and crossed the rifle pits of the Huirangi pā, prompting Māori to abandon the pā and fall back on Pukerangiora. Despite widespread criticism for his slowness and caution, Pratt pressed on towards Te Arei, creating the most extensive field-engineering works ever undertaken by British troops in New Zealand. Five more redoubts were built as the saps continued to <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cliff</b> above the Waitara River, but ceased after the intervention of Kingite chief Wiremu Tamihana, who helped negotiate a truce. A ceasefire was formally effected on 18 March 1861, ending {{the first phase of the}} Taranaki War. For his actions on 18 March, Colour-Sergeant John Lucas was awarded the Victoria Cross.|$|E
25|$|The {{geographer}} Pausanias {{records that}} Athena placed the infant Erichthonius {{into a small}} chest (cista), which she entrusted {{to the care of}} the three daughters of Cecrops: Herse, Pandrosos, and Aglauros of Athens. She warned the three sisters not to open the chest, but did not explain to them why or what was in it. Aglauros, and possibly one of the other sisters, opened the chest. Differing reports say that they either found that the child itself was a serpent, that it was guarded by a serpent, that it was guarded by two serpents, or that it had the legs of a serpent. In Pausanias's story, the two sisters were driven mad by the sight of the chest's contents and hurled themselves off the Acropolis, dying instantly, but an Attic vase painting shows them being chased by the serpent off <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cliff</b> instead. Erichthonius {{was one of the most}} important founding heroes of Athens and the legend of the daughters of Cecrops was a cult myth linked to the rituals of the Arrhephoria festival.|$|E

The Bounty Hunter, who has returned to the school, continues his search for Praise. Meanwhile, Scully follows a girl, Thea (Christine Firkins), she had previously observed to be Praise's friend throughout the desert until she is able to locate Praise. After Doggett explains the events on the clifftop to Alvin Kersh, Walter Skinner tells him that Kersh is setting him up to fail. Shortly afterwards, the Bounty Hunter (now disguised as agent Scully) attacks Agent Landau. Skinner and the real Scully eventually manage to drive the alien away.|$|E
500|$|Blair did {{not want}} Livingstone as London Mayor, {{claiming}} the latter {{was one of those}} who [...] "almost knocked [...] over <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cliff</b> into extinction" [...] during the 1980s. He and the Labour spin doctors organised a campaign against Livingstone to ensure that he was not selected, with Campbell and Sally Morgan unsuccessfully attempting to get Oona King to denounce Livingstone. They failed to convince Mo Mowlam to stand for the mayorship, and instead encouraged the reluctant Frank Dobson to stand. Recognising that a 'one member, one vote' election within the London Labour Party would probably see Livingstone selected over Dobson, Blair ensured that a third of the votes would come from the rank-and-file members, a third from the trade unions, and a third from Labour MPs and MEPs, the latter two of which he could pressure into voting for his own preferred candidate, something that Dobson was deeply uncomfortable with. Information on the Blairite campaign against Livingstone became public, costing Dobson much support; nevertheless, due to the impact of the MPs and MEPs, Dobson won the candidacy with 51% to Livingstone's 48%.|$|E

500|$|Maiden Castle has no {{artificial}} defences on {{its northern}} and western sides {{because of the}} naturally steep slope of the hill, {{but there are two}} artificial banks, [...] apart.

The main entrance is on the east side of the fort where the inner bank turns in towards the fort, and while there is a gap in the outer rampart it does not turn in. There may also be two other entrances to the site where the banks meet the cliffs to the north and south; the outer ditch runs inwards at both ends, possibly indicating an in-turned entrance abutting <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cliff</b> similar to the entrance at the Helsby hill fort also in Cheshire or perhaps an attempt to make the banks run flush to the cliff-edge to ensure there were no gaps in the site's defences.|$|E

The river's annual flood season is February to May with a peak in April,/s (318,000 cu ft) is quoted by many websites for Victoria Falls but this is the mean maximum instantaneous rate, which is only achieved for a few days per year. The figure of 536 million m3/minute (18.9 billion cu ft/min) on some websites (e.g. ZNTB) is an error for 536 million litres/minute (equivalent to 9100 m3/s or 142 million U.S. gallons/min).
