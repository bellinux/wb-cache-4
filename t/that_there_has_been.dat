5|$|M-143, {{also known}} as Michigan Avenue, is a {{previously}} unsigned spur state trunkline highway in the south central region of the US state of Michigan.

This highway {{is the second time}} <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> an M-143 in Michigan. The first was a connection to the original Cheboygan State Park.

5|$|The 2007 IPCC report noted many {{observed}} {{changes in}} the climate, including atmospheric composition, global average temperatures, ocean conditions, and others.

5|$|Even {{in modern}} democracies, Freemasonry is {{sometimes}} viewed with distrust. In the UK, Masons {{working in the}} justice system, such as judges and police officers, were from 1999 to 2009 required to disclose their membership. While a parliamentary inquiry found <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> no evidence of wrongdoing, {{it was felt that}} any potential loyalties Masons might have, based on their vows to support fellow Masons, should be transparent to the public. The policy of requiring a declaration of masonic membership of applicants for judicial office (judges and magistrates) was ended in 2009 by Justice Secretary Jack Straw (who had initiated the requirement in the 1990s). Straw stated that the rule was considered disproportionate, since no impropriety or malpractice had been shown as a result of judges being Freemasons.|$|E

5|$|Alan regains {{consciousness}} a week later, apparently having driven his car off the road, {{but with}} no memory of how he got there. He starts to head back towards town, but his progress is hampered by shadowy figures that try to kill him. He observes a strange figure in a diving suit who reminds him of his earlier dream and how to fight the shadows with light. Alan fights through the shadows while finding pages of a manuscript titled Departure with {{his name on the}} by-line, a work he had not written. Eventually making it to town, Alan tries to alert Sheriff Sarah Breaker of his wife's disappearance, but Sarah states <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> no island or cabin in Cauldron lake for years after it sunk following a volcanic eruption years prior. Sarah contacts the FBI to investigate Alice's disappearance, while Alan arranges for Barry to come and help.|$|E
5|$|Grand Teton National Park is {{the only}} U.S. National Park that permits hunting, but only of elk {{in an effort to}} keep the populations of that species regulated. This {{provision}} was included in the legislation that combined Jackson Hole National Monument and Grand Teton National Park in 1950. While some National Parks in Alaska permit subsistence hunting by indigenous natives and a few other National Park Service managed areas allow hunting under highly regulated circumstances, hunting in U.S. National Parks is not generally allowed. In Grand Teton National Park, hunters are required to obtain Wyoming hunting licenses and be deputized as park rangers. Hunting is restricted to areas east of the Snake River and north of Moran, Wyoming, the hunt is permitted only east of U.S. Route 89. Proponents of continuing the elk hunt, which occurs in the fall, argue that the elk herd would become overpopulated without it, leading to vegetation degradation from overgrazing elk herds. Opponents cite <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> an increase of predators such as the wolf and grizzly bear in Grand Teton National Park, rendering the annual hunt unnecessary and exposing hunters to attacks by grizzly bears as they become accustomed to feeding on remains left behind from the hunt.|$|E
5|$|In 2015–2016, {{percentage}} {{share of}} Gross Value Added (GVA) at factor cost by Economic Activity at constant price (base year 2011–2012) was Agriculture-Forestry and Fishery – 14.84%, Industry 18.51% and Services 66.65%. It {{has been observed}} <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> a slow but steady decline in the percentage share of industry and agriculture over the years. Agriculture is the leading economic sector in West Bengal. Rice is the state's principal food crop. Rice, potato, jute, sugarcane, and wheat are the top five crops of the state. Tea is produced commercially in northern districts; the region {{is well known for}} Darjeeling and other high quality teas. State industries are localised in the Kolkata region, the mineral-rich western highlands, and the Haldia port region. The Durgapur–Asansol colliery belt is home to a number of major steel plants. Important manufacturing industries are engineering products, electronics, electrical equipment, cables, steel, leather, textiles, jewellery, frigates, automobiles, railway coaches, and wagons. The Durgapur centre has established a number of industries in the areas of tea, sugar, chemicals, and fertilisers. Natural resources like tea and jute in and nearby parts has made West Bengal a major centre for the jute and tea industries.|$|E

Viswanathan, believing Ashok {{is the only}} heir of a millionaire, asks Kanchana's consent to marry him. When Kanchana rejects the proposal, Viswanathan asks Nirmala, who happily accepts. Sachidanandam, who is buying a nearby estate, is referred to Viswanathan and arrives in Chinnamalai. They meet and discover that they are childhood friends. Thinking {{it would be inappropriate}} to marry off his younger daughter while the elder one is still unmarried, Viswanathan arranges Kanchana's marriage to Vasu, who meets his father is unable to reveal his true identity to prevent getting caught. When Sachidanandam returns to Chennai to make the wedding preparations, he finds <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> no word from his son, who left for Coimbatore weeks before.

5|$|To help clarify {{species and}} {{subspecies}} boundaries, {{and to establish}} whether morphology-based classifications were consistent with evolutionary relationships, the phylogenetic relationships within the genus Nycticebus have been investigated using DNA sequences derived from the mitochondrial markers D loop and cytochrome b. Although most of the recognized lineages of Nycticebus (including N.pygmaeus, N. menagensis and N.javanicus) were shown to be genetically distinct—the analysis suggested that DNA sequences from some individuals of N.coucang and N.bengalensis apparently share a closer evolutionary relationship with each other than with {{members of their own}} species. The authors suggest that this result may be explained by introgressive hybridization, as the tested individuals of these two taxa originated from a region of sympatry in southern Thailand; the precise origin of one of the N.coucang individuals was not known. This hypothesis was corroborated by a 2007 study that compared the variations in mitochondrial DNA sequences between N.bengalensis and N.coucang, and suggested <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> gene flow between the two species.|$|E
5|$|With the {{accuracy}} of the timing systems, ties are rare. Ties between different athletes are resolved as follows: In determining whether there has been a tie in any round for a qualifying position for the next round based on time, a judge (called the chief photo finish judge) must consider the actual time recorded by the athletes to one thousandth of a second. If the judge decides <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> a tie, the tying athletes must be placed in the next round or, if that is not practicable, lots must be drawn to determine who must be placed in the next round. In the case of a tie for first place in any final, the referee decides whether it is practicable to arrange for the athletes so tying to compete again. If he decides it is not, the result stands. Ties in other placings remain.|$|E

The following day, Rhys goes to Harold's Store and kisses Vanessa. Rhys opens up to her about his father and they arrange a date. When Troy Miller (Dieter Brummer) is brought into the hospital, he tells Rhys that Jade attacked him. Rhys reports this {{to the police and}} when Jade finds out, she asks him to leave the house. Rhys applies for a three-month study tour in Japan and asks Vanessa to come with him. Rhys' mother later gives him a ring so that he can propose to Vanessa. Shortly before leaving for Japan, Rhys comes across a car accident involving the street's teenagers. He rings the emergency services, before assessing their injuries. Rhys cuts his hand on a piece of wreckage, which forces him to cancel the trip to Japan. He later learns that he has only a five per cent chance of making a full recovery. Following an EMG, Rhys learns <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> no improvement to his hand.
