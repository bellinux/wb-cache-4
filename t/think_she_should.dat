Madonna also roundly attacked O'Connor in the press for the incident, telling the Irish Times: [...] "I think there is a better way to present her ideas rather than ripping up an image that means a lot to other people." [...] She added, [...] "If she is against the Roman Catholic Church and she has a problem with them, I <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> talk about it."

2500|$|Sales {{has been}} {{described}} as an [...] "outspoken conservative" [...] and an [...] "ultraconservative." [...] At the time Sales was selected by his Republican colleagues in 2006 to serve as speaker of the House, the Billings Gazette described him as [...] "easily one of the body's most conservative members." [...] He is a supporter of the Tea Party movement, favors budget cuts and tax cuts, supports [...] "right-to-work" [...] legislation, and expanded gun rights.

[...] and [...] "Perfect Day", which were co-composed with Persson; Fredriksson co-wrote the music to one of the album's louder rock songs, [...] "Hotblooded", and is the sole composer of ballad [...] "Watercolors in the Rain". She composed its music using lyrics which were written several years prior by Gessle, who expressed interest in the pair composing this way more regularly on future material, saying: [...] "When it's happening like that , it makes Roxette even better because it widens up what we can do, what kind of music we can make, even more. So I <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> write more." [...] Her limited input in the songwriting of Roxette material stemmed from difficulty with writing English lyrics: she has said that it [...] "feels very strange to write in another language." [...] The song is more folk-orientated than any material previously recorded by the duo, and is indicative of Fredriksson's Swedish-language solo work.|$|E
