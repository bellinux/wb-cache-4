5|$|At Shimer, the {{professor}} is a facilitator, a guide on the side, not a sage {{on the stage}} – encouraging each student {{to contribute to the}} intellectual light being kindled in every class. Each student is expected to question and comment upon the text, to respond to one other’s insights, actively taking part in every discussion.... Students know their insights matter; they have something to offer to their peers, and {{to the life of the}} text being discussed. Some students are more exuberant than others, some would rather talk than listen; others may be a bit shy. The professor/facilitator must make sure that each student has a chance to shine, that each can feel confident, each can have the courage to ask what they <b>think</b> <b>might</b> be a stupid question. What are feared to be stupid questions are often the most provocative ones.|$|E
500|$|After {{appearing}} on the show in series 6, Richard Herring wrote on his blog: [...] "What a delightful and fascinating programme this is (and one that I <b>think</b> <b>might</b> benefit from an extended podcast release - two hours of material is recorded for the 27 minute show and it's pretty much all gold!). At times I was so enjoying listening to the others talking that I almost forgot that I {{was meant to be}} taking part. It was a wide-ranging discussion taking in ants on stilts, pianists with crippling, mechanical little fingers, the changing meridian and okapi sex (can you guess what I contributed?). The show has a dedicated team of nerds behind it who have dug out amazing facts and I love the way it has a panel comprising comedians, scientists and experts and attempts to link each contribution to similar areas of the different disciplines. While most TV panel shows (including to some extent even QI) gravitate to putting in the same well-known comedy faces, you get a lot more interesting stuff by mixing it up a bit. The zoologist, Dr Christofer Clemente, came up with the funniest lines of the show. But would they book him on Mock The Week? It's intelligent and stimulating programming that is increasingly being edged out of TV and even radio, leaving a gaping open goal for independent internet productions to score in. I discussed this with one of the razor-minded team after the show. The TV companies insist on getting big names into all shows, which takes up all the budget and seems to ignore the fact that the pool of possible contributors gets smaller and more boring. But glad that a few shows designed to expand the mind rather than crush the spirit still exist." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another {{study found}} that it was not {{uncommon}} for adolescent girls in relationships to report they felt little desire to engage in sexual activity when they were in relationships. However, many girls engaged in sexual activity even if they did not desire it, in order to avoid what they <b>think</b> <b>might</b> place strains on their relationships. The researcher states that this may be because of society's pressure on girls to be [...] "good girls"; the pressure to be [...] "good" [...] may make adolescent girls think they are not supposed to feel desire like boys do. Even when girls said they did feel sexual desire, they said that they felt like they were not supposed to, and often tried to cover up their feelings. This {{is an example of how}} societal expectations about gender can impact adolescent sexual functioning.|$|E

2500|$|While media use of {{this term}} {{may have contributed to}} wider {{awareness}} and interest, many scientists feel the name is inappropriate since it is sensational hyperbole and misleads readers; the particle also {{has nothing to do with}} God, leaves open numerous questions in fundamental physics, and does not explain the ultimate origin of the universe. Higgs, an atheist, was reported to be displeased and stated in a 2008 interview that he found it [...] "embarrassing" [...] because it was [...] "the kind of misuse... which I <b>think</b> <b>might</b> offend some people". Science writer Ian Sample stated in his 2010 book on the search that the nickname is [...] "universally hate" [...] by physicists and perhaps the [...] "worst derided" [...] in the history of physics, but that (according to Lederman) the publisher rejected all titles mentioning [...] "Higgs" [...] as unimaginative and too unknown.|$|E
2500|$|A {{reporter}} from the Sunday Mercury said [...] "What do we <b>think</b> <b>might</b> {{happen to a}} car overloaded with teenagers? It crashes, of course, and Sophie is badly injured." [...] Carena Crawford from All About Soap commented [...] "Wow, Neighbours {{was more than a}} little bit dramatic today with the big car crash putting Sophie's life in danger – will she survive?" [...] The writer went on to say that the accident would have [...] "far-reaching consequences for everybody" [...] and tried to work out who was to blame, before adding [...] "Whoever's fault it is, we can't wait to see what happens next!" [...] A reporter for the TVTimes stated [...] "With more road accidents in this patch of Oz than anywhere else in the world, Sophie is asking for trouble when she piles into Chris's car, which is already overloaded with teenagers thanks to Andrew egging him on." [...] Dianne Butler, writing for news.com.au, thought the police did [...] "a half-baked investigation into the car crash", enabling Paul to sue Chris. The storyline was included in the Inside Soap Yearbook 2013 as one of [...] "The best bits of September". It was also named [...] "Crash of the month". The crash was nominated for Best Storyline in Digital Spy's end of year reader poll for 2012, it received 5.5% of the vote.|$|E
2500|$|Coverage {{was mostly}} negative. Richard Dorment wrote in The Daily Telegraph: [...] "The {{shortlist}} for this year's Turner Prize is so wilfully opaque it's irrelevant." [...] In his opinion the artists selected exemplified [...] "Euro-art, a term I've {{made up to}} describe {{a certain kind of}} technically competent, bland, and ultimately empty art made specifically for international biennales." [...] Similarly, Jonathan Jones wrote in The Guardian that the show [...] "reflect a mentality only too dominant in art magazines and curating right nowa rather overthought, overtalked, pseudo-intellectual culture." [...] In The Times, Rachel Campbell-Johnston wrote, [...] "I can't help thinking that this show will prove ... like the returns desk of Ikea on a Monday morning. Lots of frustrated people will be left staring at a pile of inscrutable junk." [...] In the Financial Times, Jackie Wullschlager wrote, [...] "Don’t go. Don’t even think about going. This year’s Turner Prize exhibition is without competition the worst {{in the history of the}} award.... a killer mix of self-indulgence and academicism." [...] Laura Cumming in The Observer agreed, [...] "If ever you were thinking of giving the Turner Prize a miss then 2008 is the ideal year." [...] saying that [...] "t is not that the art is wilfully bad ... it is just that it is almost entirely inactive." [...] In contrast, Adrian Searle wrote in The Guardian: [...] "here's a depth and complexity [...] that, it would be nice to <b>think,</b> <b>might</b> overtake the usual chat about winners and losers." ...|$|E
