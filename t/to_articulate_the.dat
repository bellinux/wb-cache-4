Correlation coefficients created by these methods help archaeologists discern between meaningful and useless similarities between artefacts. During the 1990s archaeologists began to use phylogenetic methods borrowed from Cladistics.|$|E
25|$|Brouwer's celebrity is not {{exclusively}} {{due to his}} topological work. The proofs of his great topological theorems are not constructive, and Brouwer's dissatisfaction with this is partly what led him <b>to</b> <b>articulate</b> <b>the</b> idea of constructivity. He became the originator and zealous defender {{of a way of}} formalising mathematics that is known as intuitionism, which at the time made a stand against set theory. The fixed-point theorem is, as he originally stated it, false in intuitionism, and Brouwer disavowed it, proposing instead alternative versions to be constructively proven.|$|E
25|$|Hewitt began {{experimenting with}} poetry while still a schoolboy at Methodist College in the 1920s. Typically thorough, his {{notebooks}} from these years {{are filled with}} hundreds of poems, in dozens of styles; Hewitt's main influences at this time included William Blake, William Morris and W. B. Yeats, {{and for the most}} part the verse is either highly romantic, or strongly socialist, a theme which increased in prominence as the 1930s began. Morris is the key figure, combining both these strains, and allowing Hewitt <b>to</b> <b>articulate</b> <b>the</b> radical, dissenting strain which he inherited from his Methodist forbearers, including his father.|$|E

25|$|In {{the same}} period, rationalist thinkers of the Enlightenment criticized slavery for violating human rights. A {{member of the}} British Parliament, James Edward Oglethorpe, {{was among the first}} <b>to</b> <b>articulate</b> <b>the</b> Enlightenment case against slavery. Founder of the Province of Georgia, Oglethorpe banned slavery on {{humanistic}} grounds. He argued against it in Parliament and eventually encouraged his friends Granville Sharp and Hannah More to vigorously pursue the cause. Soon after his death in 1785, Sharp and More joined with William Wilberforce and others in forming the Clapham Sect. Although anti-slavery sentiments were widespread by the late 18th century, colonies and emerging nations, notably in the southern United States, continued to use and uphold traditions of slavery.|$|E
25|$|Well-versed in {{the pagan}} {{philosophy}} of the Greco-Roman world, Augustine both criticized its perceived shortcomings, and employed it <b>to</b> <b>articulate</b> <b>the</b> message of Christianity. Although open to the study and close reading of his fellow African writer, Apuleius (c. 125–185), a pagan thaumaturge, Augustine strongly criticized his understanding of spiritual phenomena. In a well-known work, The City of God, Augustine embarks on wide-ranging discussions of Christian theology, and also applies his learned views to history. He harshly criticizes the ancient state religion of Rome, yet frankly admires traditional Roman civic virtues; in fact he opines that their persistent practice found favor with God (unknown in name to them), hence {{the progress of the}} Roman cause throughout the Mediterranean. Later he traces the history of Israel as guided by God, and searches out the gospels of Christianity.|$|E
25|$|Despite obstacles, {{efforts are}} under way by various {{analytical}} groups <b>to</b> <b>articulate</b> <b>the</b> benefits to local and regional constituents and participants to encourage developments that would progressively align in support. It is known from the Talmud that {{in the time of}} King Agrippa, Jerusalem was filled with millions of visitors and pilgrims from the entire region. Today the potential of spiritual tourism would support the growth goals of the Mayor of Jerusalem for 10 million tourists annually. This would provide a significant boost to the economy and would benefit people locally and regionally, many of whom live in poverty. Since the rebuilding of the Temple can come only through a process of peace, it must be preceded by numerous efforts, including the financial and project infrastructures to support such a large increase in tourism, local and regional co-operation agreements to enable its construction and the success of modern attempts to revive the Sanhedrin, the authority which must be empowered for such an event to occur.|$|E

In doing so, I will unpack representations of these fictional women with a view <b>to</b> <b>articulating</b> <b>the</b> implications that they have for challenging both problematic feminine positionings and heterosexism(s). While the film The Descent can be read as falling short of offering a challenge to heterosexist understandings of femininity, it will be argued that viewing horror films as monolithically problematic for women may overlook the subversive potential of this genre...|$|R

25|$|The Deuteronomistic Historians, who {{redacted}} the Former Prophets (Joshua, Judges, 1 & 2 Samuel, 1 & 2 Kings), idealized Samuel as {{a figure}} who is larger than life like Joshua. Samuel's father, Elkanah, is described as having originated from Zuph, specifically Ramathaim-Zophim, {{which was part of}} the tribal lands of Ephraim, while the Books of Chronicles state that he was a Levite. Samuel is a judge who leads the military like in the Book of Judges and also who exercises judicial functions. In 1 Sam 12:6–17, the Deuteronomic Historians composed a speech of Samuel that portrays him as the judge sent by God to save Israel. In 1 Samuel 9:6–20, Samuel is seen as a local “seer”. The Deuteronomistic Historians preserved this view of Samuel while contributing him as “the first of prophets <b>to</b> <b>articulate</b> <b>the</b> failure of Israel {{to live up to its}} covenant with God.” For the Deuteronomistic Historians, Samuel was an extension of Moses and continuing Moses’ function as a prophet, judge, and priest, which made historical Samuel uncertain.|$|E
25|$|Abolitionism is a {{movement}} to end slavery, whether formal or informal. In Western Europe and the Americas, abolitionism is a historical movement to end the African and Indian slave trade and set slaves free. King Charles I of Spain, usually known as Emperor Charles V, following the example of Louis X of France who abolished slavery within the Kingdom of France in 1315, passed a law which would have abolished colonial slavery in 1542, although this law was not passed in the largest colonial states, and so was not enforced. In the late 17th century, the Roman Catholic Church, taking up a plea by Lourenço da Silva de Mendouça, officially condemned the slave trade, which was affirmed vehemently by Pope Gregory XVI in 1839. An abolitionist movement only started in the late 18th century, however, when English and American Quakers began to question the morality of slavery. James Oglethorpe {{was among the first}} <b>to</b> <b>articulate</b> <b>the</b> Enlightenment case against slavery, banning it in the Province of Georgia on humanitarian grounds, arguing against it in Parliament, and eventually encouraging his friends Granville Sharp and Hannah More to vigorously pursue the cause. Soon after his death in 1785, they joined with William Wilberforce and others in forming the Clapham Sect.|$|E
