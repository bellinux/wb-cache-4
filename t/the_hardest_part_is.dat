Curzon Dax trained Jadzia when she was a Trill Initiate, studying to prepare herself to apply to the Symbiosis Commission to receive a symbiont.

She later reapplied and was accepted, and actually received Curzon's symbiont {{when he came to the}} end of his life.

50|$|What makes {{superheating}} so explosive is that {{a larger}} bubble is easier to inflate than a small one; just as when blowing up a balloon, <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> <b>part</b> <b>is</b> getting started. It turns out the excess pressure due to surface tension is inversely proportional to {{the diameter of the}} bubble. This means if the largest bubbles in a container are only a few micrometres in diameter, overcoming the surface tension may require exceeding the boiling point by several degrees Celsius. Once a bubble does begin to grow, the pressure due to the surface tension reduces, so it expands explosively. In practice, most containers have scratches or other imperfections which trap pockets of air that provide starting bubbles. But a container of liquid with only microscopic bubbles can superheat dramatically.|$|E
5000|$|During the 1970s, {{traveling}} {{was considered}} {{an aspect of the}} counterculture and Tony Wheeler said in 2013: [...] "The boomers were setting off to places their parents hadn't gone." [...] What became known as the [...] "hippie trail" [...] was a popular route for such travelers, as the price of travel dropped and numerous Asian travel companies were launched. Cadwalladr explained in 2007 that the introduction of the Across Asia on the Cheap booklet was [...] "a generational call to arms", as it contained Tony Wheeler's motivational cry: [...] "All you've got to do is decide to go and <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> <b>part</b> <b>is</b> over. So go." [...] Cadwalladr further states that Wheeler's peers throughout the world subsequently made the decision to travel, regardless of whether they possessed a Lonely Planet guide. Other travel guide brand names also emerged in the early 1970s, such as Rough Guides and Bradt.|$|E

Kelley, Muldaur said: We didn't think of her as an evil wench at the time. I don't think they knew, and I don't think I knew, {{what she was going to}} evolve into. Obviously, they wanted her to stir things up in the office.

50|$|The International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) {{gathered}} in Cairo in September 1994 {{to discuss and}} “formulate a consensus position on population and development for the next 20 years”. One of the other goals was to make education and medical services available to women while they are pregnant, and when the time comes, have delivery options available. A main concern has always been postnatal care; people think that <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> <b>part</b> <b>is</b> {{the birth of the}} child {{but there are so many}} additional concerns once the child is born and brought into this world. Complications both prior to pregnancy, during delivery, and after delivery are a potential concern in all births, the ICPD talked about enhancing the available support for all women. Pregnancy rights throughout the world are not going to be the same in every single place but the ICPD is aiming to eliminate discrimination during pregnancy and make all pregnant patients’ rights available to everyone.|$|E
