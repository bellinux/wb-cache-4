5|$|Control of the plant, when desired, is best managed via {{mechanical}} means, such as hand pulling and hoeing, preferably {{followed by}} sowing of native plants. Animals rarely graze {{it because of}} its irritating hairs, and liquid herbicides require surfactants to be effective, as the hair causes water <b>to</b> <b>roll</b> <b>off</b> the plant, much like the lotus effect. Burning is ineffective, as it only creates new bare areas for seedlings to occupy. G. tetrum and Cucullia verbasci usually have little effect on V.thapsus populations as a whole. Goats and chickens have also been proposed to control mullein. Effective (when used with a surfactant) contact herbicides include glyphosate, triclopyr and sulfurometuron-methyl. Ground herbicides, like tebuthiuron, are also effective, but recreate bare ground and require repeated application to prevent regrowth.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Hornets began <b>to</b> <b>roll</b> <b>off</b> the {{production}} lines in 1984. The first two aircraft (serial numbers A21-101 and A21-102) were entirely built at McDonnell Douglas' factory in St. Louis, and were {{handed over to}} the RAAF on 29 October 1984. These aircraft remained in the United States until May 1985 for training and trials purposes. The next two Australian Hornets (A21-103 and A21-104) were also built at St. Louis, but were then disassembled and flown to Avalon in June 1984 on board a USAF Lockheed C-5 Galaxy. The aircraft were then reassembled, and A21-103 was rolled out at a ceremony attended by Prime Minister Bob Hawke and the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Marshal David Evans, on 16 November. However, the aircraft's initial test flight was delayed until 26 February 1985 by a demarcation dispute over which category of pilot was permitted to fly the aircraft.|$|E

25|$|Though {{the sedan}} body, and the VRS version were {{discontinued}} (the latter until facelift in 2010), the 2nd-generation Fabia offered {{variety of new}} choices. The GreenLine model was the most environmentally-friendly Fabia, with 59kW 1.4-litre diesel 3-cylinder consuming 4.1 l/100km, which is 109 g of CO2 per km. At the Frankfurt International Motor Show (IAA) 2007 Škoda presented near-production-state design study of the Fabia Scout: a rugged version of the Fabia Combi. However, it was until May 2009 when this car finally started <b>to</b> <b>roll</b> <b>off</b> the production line in Mladá Boleslav.

500|$|Another {{class of}} {{applications}} of the Reuleaux triangle involves cylindrical objects with a Reuleaux triangle cross section. [...] Several pencils are manufactured in this shape, rather than the more traditional round or hexagonal barrels.

500|$|When {{comparing}} the [...] "petal effect" [...] to the [...] "lotus effect", {{it is important}} to note some striking differences. The surface structure of the lotus leaf and the rose petal, as seen in Figure 9, can be used to explain the two different effects. The lotus petal has a randomly rough surface and low contact angle hysteresis, which means the water droplet is not able to wet the microstructure spaces between the spikes. This allows air to remain inside the texture, causing a heterogeneous surface composed of both air and solid. As a result, the adhesive force between the water and the solid surface is extremely low, allowing the water <b>to</b> <b>roll</b> <b>off</b> easily (i.e. [...] "self-cleaning" [...] phenomenon).|$|E

500|$|Some reviewers {{have found}} other criticisms in the gameplay. Buchanan {{mentioned}} that the character holds his gun in his right hand, requiring the player to compensate by moving left before shooting enemies (if the player can move left on the screen). Thomas echoed Buchanan's concerns in a later review, adding that this requires players to mentally adjust and to target enemies off-center. Thomas criticized {{the control of the}} tank, in particular the lack of traction, which he said may cause players <b>to</b> <b>roll</b> <b>off</b> a platform or cliff. Parish criticized the gameplay in the top-down perspective, saying that the gun the players uses is too weak; he continues by adding that there are too few upgrades for it and that, whenever the player takes damage, it downgrades from a [...] "high-powered beam of death" [...] to [...] "a stupid unreliable peashooter of mild discomfort".|$|E
500|$|The {{final cut}} of [...] "Cog" [...] {{consists}} of two continuous sixty-second dolly shots taken from a technocrane, stitched together [...] later in post-production. (The stitching appears during {{the moment when the}} muffler rolls across the floor.) Four days of filming were required to get these two shots, two days for each minute-long section. Filming sessions lasted seven hours and the work was exacting, as some parts needed to be positioned with an accuracy of a sixteenth of an inch. Despite the detailed instructions derived from the testing period, small variations in ambient temperature, humidity and settling dust continually threw off the movement of the parts enough to end the sequence early. It took 90 minutes on the first day just to get the initial transmission bearing to roll correctly into the second. Between testing and filming, 606takes were needed to capture the final cut. The team commandeered two of Honda's six hand-assembled Accords—one <b>to</b> <b>roll</b> <b>off</b> the trailer {{at the end of the}} advertisement, the other to be stripped for parts. While several sections of the early scripts had to be abandoned due to the total unavailability of certain Accord components, by the time production finished the accumulated spare parts filled two articulated lorries.|$|E
500|$|Of {{the pieces}} cited with {{approval}} by Poulenc, the fifteen Improvisations were composed at intervals between 1932 and 1959. All are brief: the longest lasts {{a little more}} than three minutes. They vary from swift and balletic to tender lyricism, old-fashioned march, perpetuum mobile, waltz and a poignant musical portrait of the singer Édith Piaf. Poulenc's favoured Intermezzo was the last of three. Numbers one and two were composed in August 1934; the A flat followed in March 1943. The commentators Marina and Victor Ledin describe the work as [...] "the embodiment of the word 'charming'. The music seems simply <b>to</b> <b>roll</b> <b>off</b> the pages, each sound following another in such an honest and natural way, with eloquence and unmistakable Frenchness." [...] The eight nocturnes were composed across nearly a decade (1929–38). Whether or not Poulenc originally conceived them as an integral set, he gave the eighth the title [...] "To serve as Coda for the Cycle" [...] (Pour servir de Coda au Cycle). Although they share their generic title with the nocturnes of Field, Chopin and Fauré, Poulenc's do not resemble those of the earlier composers, being [...] "night-scenes and sound-images of public and private events" [...] rather than romantic tone poems.|$|E

500|$|The first He 111B {{made its}} maiden flight {{in the autumn}} of 1936. The first {{production}} batch rolled off the production lines that summer, at Rostock. Seven B-0 pre-production aircraft were built, bearing the Werknummern (Works numbers) 1431 to 1437. The B-0s were powered by DB 600C engines fitted with variable pitch airscrews. The screws increased output by 149kW (200hp). The B-0 had a MG 15 machine gun installed in the nose. The B-0 could also carry 1,500kg (3,310lb) in their vertical cells. The B-1 had some minor improvements, including the installation of a revolving gun-mount in the nose and a flexible Ikaria turret under the fuselage. After improvements, the RLM ordered 300 He 111B-1s; the first were delivered in January 1937. In the B-2 variant, engines were upgraded to the supercharged 634kW (850hp) DB 600C, or in some cases, the 690kW (925hp) 600G. The B-2 began <b>to</b> <b>roll</b> <b>off</b> the production lines at Oranienburg in 1937. The He 111B-3 was a modified trainer. Some 255 B-1s were ordered. However, the production orders were impossible to fulfill and only 28 B-1s were built. Owing to the production of the new He 111E, only a handful of He 111B-3s were produced. Due to insufficient capacity, Dornier, Arado and Junkers built the He 111B series at their plants in Wismar, Brandenburg and Dessau, respectively. The B series compared favourably with the capacity of the A series. The bomb load increased to 1,500kg (3,300lb), while there was also an increase in maximum speed and altitude to 215mph (344km/h) and 22,000ft (6,700m) ...|$|E

The result of the collaboration was the Proton Saga, which launched on 9 July 1985.

Later in October 1987, a hatchback variant called the Proton Saga Aeroback was launched and featured a more powerful 1.5L Mitsubishi 4G15 engine and a redesigned rear-end. Proton entered the United Kingdom in March 1989 with the Saga saloon and hatchback duo, where the Malaysian company set the record for the [...] "Fastest Selling Make of New Car Ever to Enter the United Kingdom". Proton's sales declined during the late 1980s as a result of the worldwide economic recession, and the lack of technical expertise in Proton's management.

2500|$|The 1988 Fiero {{brought a}} new {{suspension}} design, thought by many to have {{a striking resemblance to}} those designed by Lotus, which at the time, was about to be acquired by General Motors. The suspension was never a Lotus design though; it was the suspension the Pontiac engineers had designed in the beginning, along with what they learned from the racing program. Up front were revised control arms and knuckles that reduced steering effort and improved the scrub radius. In the back, the old Citation parts were replaced with a real tri-link suspension with all new knuckles. This new suspension came with staggered wheel sizes on WS6 suspension equipped models, with [...] by [...] wide wheels up front and [...] by [...] wide wheels in the rear for improved handling balance and to offset the slightly increased front track that resulted from the improvements. Topping off the package were the new vented disc brakes at all four corners, which addressed braking complaints of road testers. A variable effort electro-hydraulic power steering unit, the same design later found on the GM EV1, was also to be a late addition. This option never made it to production — one reason cited is that models with the prototype power steering were noted as being too loud. The four-cylinder engine received an in-pan oil filter element and balance shaft. A [...] "Formula" [...] option was added, which offered many of the GT features with the standard coupe body, including the [...] speedometer, WS6 Suspension (which includes offset crosslace wheels) and the rear spoiler. 1988 marked the end of production for the Fiero, and is also considered to be the best Fiero produced. Improvements to suspension, brakes, steering, and improvements to both the four-cylinder and V6 engines took the car to a level far beyond the 1984 model that had received much criticism. 1988 was also the only year a yellow exterior color was available as a factory option. During the Fiero's final model year (on August 16, 1988) the last window sticker was placed on the last Fiero <b>to</b> <b>roll</b> <b>off</b> the Pontiac, Michigan plant line.
