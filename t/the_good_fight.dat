500|$|Outside of the game, {{the full}} fictional {{biography}} that Blizzard provides for Tracer lists her real name, age, and {{base of operations}} as: Lena Oxton, 26, and London, England, respectively. In Overwatch lore, Tracer is an adventurer, {{as well as a}} former agent of the Overwatch organization, and became the youngest person inducted into its experimental flight program. Known for her piloting skills, she was chosen to test the Slipstream, a prototype of a teleporting fighter. During the test flight, the Slipstream's teleportation matrix malfunctioned, and Tracer was pronounced dead. However, she would later reappear, having been desynchronized from the flow of time. This [...] "chronal disassociation" [...] prevented her from keeping a physical form in the present, until a scientist named Winston created the chronal accelerator. This allowed Tracer to have control of her own time. These events occur during a period known as the [...] "Omnic Crisis", an in-universe event that saw the world's omniums begin producing hostile omnics, threatening the stability of the world and prompting the formation of Overwatch. Though Overwatch dissolved in the game's lore, her fictional biography asserts that Tracer continues [...] "to right wrongs and fight <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>fight</b> wherever the opportunity presents itself". In an April 2017 patch for Overwatch, the game's [...] "Hero Gallery" [...] was updated to include short fictional biographies for the characters, as well as background information on the skins that the player can equip onto characters.|$|E

500|$|Due to the Palm Beach media {{attention}} and the Thomas hearings, Kennedy's public image suffered. A Gallup Poll gave Kennedy {{a very low}} 22percent national approval rating. A Boston Herald/WCVB-TV poll found that 62 percent of Massachusetts citizens thought Kennedy should not run for re-election, by a 2-to-1 margin thought Kennedy had misled authorities in the Palm Beach investigation, and had Kennedy losing a hypothetical Senate race to Governor William Weld by 25points. Meanwhile, at a June 17, 1991, dinner party, Kennedy saw Victoria Anne Reggie, a Washington lawyer at Keck, Mahin & Cate, a divorced mother of two, and {{the daughter of an}} old Kennedy family ally, Louisiana judge Edmund Reggie. They began dating and by September were in a serious relationship. In a late October speech at the John F. Kennedy School of Government, Kennedy sought to begin a political recovery, saying: [...] "I am painfully aware that the criticism directed at me in recent months involves far more than disagreements with my positions ... involves the disappointment of friends and many others who rely on me to fight <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>fight.</b> To them I say, I recognize my own shortcomings– the faults in the conduct of my private life. I realize that I alone am responsible for them, and I am the one who must confront them." [...] In December 1991, the William Kennedy Smith rape trial was held; it was nationally televised and the most watched until the O. J. Simpson murder case three years later. Kennedy's testimony at the trial seemed relaxed, confident, and forthcoming, and helped convince the public that his involvement had been peripheral and unintended. Smith was acquitted.|$|E

2500|$|Death is {{inevitable}} and temporally unpredictable. Kierkegaard believed that individuals needed to sincerely and intensely come to realize the truth of that fact {{in order to live}} passionately. Kierkegaard accuses society of being in death-denial. Even though people see death all around them and grasp as an objective fact that everyone dies, few people truly understand, subjectively and inwardly, that they will die someday. For example, in Concluding Unscientific Postscript, Kierkegaard notes that people never think to say, [...] "I shall certainly attend your party, but I must make an exception for the contingency that a roof tile happens to blow down and kill me; for in that case, I cannot attend." [...] This is jest as far as Kierkegaard is concerned. But there is also earnestness involved in the thought of death. Kierkegaard said the following about death in his Three Upbuilding Discourses, 1844. [...] We shall not decide which life fights <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>fight</b> most easily, but we all agree that every human being ought to fight <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>fight,</b> from which no one is shut out, and yet this is so glorious that if it were granted only once to a past generation under exceptional circumstances-yes, what a description envy and discouragement would then know how to give! The difference is about the same as that in connection with the thought of death. As soon as a human being is born, he begins to die. But the difference is that there are some people for whom the thought of death comes into existence with birth and is present to them in the quiet peacefulness of childhood and the buoyancy of youth; whereas others have a period in which this thought is not present to them until, when the years run out, the years of vigor and vitality, the thought of death meets them on their way. Who, now, is going to decide which life was easier, whether it was the [...] life of those who continually lived with a certain reserve because the thought of death was present to them or the life of those who so abandoned themselves to life that they almost forgot the existence of death? ...|$|E

Although Darla is intent on {{bringing}} back Angelus, Angel hopes to save her soul and help her seek redemption while she still has a chance. However, just as it looks like he might succeed, Wolfram & Hart bring in Drusilla to turn Darla back into a vampire. Embracing his dark side, Angel fires his employees, Cordelia, Wesley (Alexis Denisof) and Gunn (J. August Richards) (secretly to protect them from this dark territory, as he later revealed to Lorne (Andy Hallett)), and embarks on a vendetta against Wolfram & Hart; Angel allows Darla and Dru to massacre a group of lawyers. Losing faith in his mission, he has sex with Darla in the hopes of losing his soul. Instead, however, he experiences an epiphany and realizes that <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>fight</b> is still worth fighting. A disgusted Darla flees L.A. and Angel reconciles with his friends, who eventually forgive him. Angel also appears in Buffy season five's [...] "Forever", comforting Buffy after her mother's death.|$|E
2500|$|An {{individual}} person, for Kierkegaard, is {{a particular}} that no abstract formula or definition can ever capture. Including the individual in [...] "the public" [...] (or [...] "the crowd" [...] or [...] "the herd") or subsuming a human being as simply {{a member of a}} species is a reduction of the true meaning of life for individuals. What philosophy or politics try to do is to categorize and pigeonhole individuals by group characteristics, each with their own individual differences. In Four Upbuilding Discourses, 1843 Kierkegaard says the differences aren't important, the likeness with God is what brings equality. In the hallowed places, in every upbuilding view of life, the thought arises in a person’s soul that help him to fight <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>fight</b> with flesh and blood, with principalities and powers, and in the fight to free himself for equality before God, whether this battle is more a war of aggression against the differences that want to encumber him with worldly favoritism or a defensive war against the differences that want to make him anxious in worldly perdition. Only in this way is equality the divine law, only in this way is the struggle the truth, only in this way does the victory have validity- only when the single individual fights for himself with himself within himself and does not unseasonably presume to help the whole world to obtain external equality, which is of very little benefit, all the less so because it never existed, {{if for no other reason}} than that everyone would come to thank him and become unequal before him, only in this way is equality the divine law.

40|$|More {{than twenty}} years ago, a {{revolution}} was announced. A number of academics and practitioners claimed that {{a new way of}} thinking about business performance was needed in order to cope with new competitive conditions, and that the ranks of companies enlisting in this revolution were growing daily. The rebellion was chiefly against the common habit of treating financial figures as the cornerstone of perfor-mance measurement (PM) instead of one set of measures amongst a vast array. Once begun, this revolution would have never end until a new philosophy of PM would have taken root in the business world.
