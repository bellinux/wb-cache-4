5|$|Between 1 and 17 October, the Japanese {{delivered}} 15,000{{troops to}} Guadalcanal, giving Hyakutake 20,000 total troops to employ for his planned offensive.

His 2nd Division (augmented by <b>troops</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 38th Division), under Lieutenant General Masao Maruyama was ordered to march through the jungle and attack the American defenses from the south near the east bank of the Lunga River. The 7000-member 2ndDivision was split into three units; the Left Wing Unit under Major General Yumio Nasu containing the 29th Infantry Regiment, the Right Wing Unit under Kawaguchi consisting of <b>troops</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 230th Infantry Regiment (from the 38th Infantry Division), and the division reserve led by Maruyama comprising the 16th Infantry Regiment.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, {{concerned}} about their rear, due {{to the presence of}} a large number of Japanese troops around Sattelberg, the Australians pushed cautiously to Kakakog, which saw heavy fighting at the end of the month, resulting in around 100 Japanese casualties as the Australians called in artillery fire and air attacks to soften up the Japanese defences prior to an attack by the 2/13th Infantry Battalion, supported by Vickers machine guns from the 2/15th. From the south, the 22nd Infantry Battalion advanced north against limited opposition. On 1 October, they crossed the Mape River adjacent to Langemak Bay, while the forward <b>troops</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 20th Infantry Brigade, overwhelmed a Japanese force around Kakakog, supported by artillery and air power, killing between 80 and 100 defenders. Following this, the Japanese began withdrawing from Finschhafen and the next day, the 20th Infantry Brigade reached their objective, entering Finschhafen in the afternoon after overcoming limited resistance.

5|$|The Japanese {{set their}} next major attempt to {{recapture}} Henderson Field for 20 October and moved {{most of the}} 2nd and 38th infantry divisions, totalling 17,500 <b>troops,</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Dutch East Indies to Rabaul in preparation for delivering them to Guadalcanal. From 14 September to 9 October, numerous Tokyo Express runs delivered <b>troops</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Japanese 2nd Infantry Division as well as Hyakutake to Guadalcanal. In addition to cruisers and destroyers, some of these runs included the seaplane carrier , which delivered heavy equipment to the island including vehicles and heavy artillery other warships could not carry because of space limitations. The Japanese Navy promised to support the Army's planned offensive by delivering the necessary troops, equipment, and supplies to the island, and by stepping up air attacks on Henderson Field and sending warships to bombard the airfield.|$|E

5|$|The {{campaign}} {{was preceded by}} an amphibious landing by <b>troops</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Australian 9th Division east of Lae on 4 September 1943. This was followed by an advance west along the coast towards the town where they were to link up with 7th Division advancing from Nadzab. Meanwhile, Australian and US forces mounted diversionary attacks around Salamaua. Heavy rain and flooding slowed the 9th Division's advance, which had to cross several rivers along the way. The Japanese rear guard also put up a stiff defence and, as a result, Lae did not fall until 16 September, when <b>troops</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 7th Division entered it ahead of the 9th, and {{the main body of}} the Japanese force escaped north. Less than a week later, the Huon Peninsula {{campaign was}} opened as the Australians undertook another amphibious landing further east, aimed at capturing Finschhafen.|$|E
5|$|The {{objective}} of the bombardment of Ancona was to delay the Italian Army from deploying its forces {{along the border with}} Austria-Hungary by destroying critical transportation systems.

5|$|According to Karl James, no {{detailed}} {{orders were}} produced {{for the attack}} and deliberate planning was hastily completed {{with little or no}} co-ordination between the attacking infantry regiments. In addition, to increase the size of the infantry force, <b>troops</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> field artillery regiment were quickly re-roled as riflemen. In the meantime, the Australians on Slater's Knoll, having been alerted to the possibility of a large-scale attack began adjusting their defences. The soldiers cleared fields off fire and set out clear engagement areas to the north, northwest and south of the knoll, to allow maximum effectiveness of their supporting Vickers medium machine guns and Bren light machine guns. Barbed wire was laid out, and booby traps set.|$|E
