5|$|The illness {{emphasised}} certain {{traits in}} his character. He argued cuttingly, his biting satire did not shrink at insults, and his expressions could be rude and cruel. Though in general Marx had a blind {{faith in his}} closest friends, nevertheless he himself complained that he was sometimes too mistrustful and unjust even to them. His verdicts, not only about enemies but even about friends, were sometimes so harsh that even less sensitive people would take offence… <b>There</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> been few whom he did not criticize like this… not even Engels was an exception.|$|E
5|$|After the {{destruction}} wreaked during the succession wars between Hyrcanus II and Aristobulus II, Pompey restored {{the independence of}} Azotus, {{as he did with}} all Hellenising coastal cities (Antiquities Book 14, 4:4). A few years later, in 55 BCE, after more fighting, Roman general Gabinius helped rebuild Ashdod and several other cities left without protective walls (Antiquities Book 14, 5:2). In 30 BCE Ashdod came under the rule of King Herod, who then bequeathed it to his sister Salome (Antiquities Book 17, 8:1). By the time of the First Jewish–Roman War (66-70), <b>there</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> been a large enough Jewish presence in Ashdod for Vespasian to feel compelled to place a garrison in the city.|$|E
5|$|Titanosaurians were {{a flourishing}} group of sauropod dinosaurs during Cretaceous times. Fossils of titanosaurians {{have been found}} on all continents and their remains are {{abundant}} {{in a number of}} Late Cretaceous sites. Nonetheless, the cranial anatomy of titanosaurians is still very poorly known. Ampelosaurus is now the best known sauropod from Europe. Others include Magyarosaurus from Hungary and an unnamed species from Catalonia, Spain. Numerous other fragments and isolated bones may or may not belong to any of these forms. While most titanosaurs are found in the southern continents of Gondwana, several derived species are known from Maastrichtian sediments in the Northern Hemisphere, including Alamosaurus in North America and Opisthocoelicaudia in Asia, indicating that <b>there</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> been at least intermittent connections between the northern and southern continents. This seems to be corroborated by the European find of Tarascosaurus, a Late Cretaceous theropod dinosaur similar to the abelisaurids, otherwise known only from the southern continents.|$|E

Mrs. Mitchett murmured dolefully: [...] "That's 'ow she is, sir; not a word will she say. And as I tell her, we can only think <b>there</b> <b>must</b> <b>'ave</b> been more than one. And that does put us to shame so!" ...|$|R
50|$|The Khmer art and {{architecture}} during the formative early Angkor era also believed to being influenced by Javanese art {{and architecture}}; the striking similarity of the Bakong temple in Cambodia to Borobudur, strongly suggests that Bakong was inspired by Borobudur's design. <b>There</b> <b>must</b> <b>had</b> been exchanges of travellers, if not mission, between Kambuja and Java.

5|$|The Honduras Packet {{reached the}} Black River in November 1822. Bemused {{to find a}} country rather {{different}} from the Sketchs descriptions, and no sign of St Joseph, the emigrants set up camp on the shore, assuming that the Poyaisian authorities would soon contact them. They sent numerous search parties inland; one, guided by natives who recognised the name St Joseph, found some long-forgotten foundations and rubble. Hall quickly came to the private conclusion that MacGregor must have duped them, but reasoned that announcing such concerns prematurely would only demoralise the party and cause chaos. A few weeks after their arrival, {{the captain of the}} Honduras Packet abruptly and unilaterally sailed away amid a fierce storm; the emigrants found themselves alone apart from the natives and two American hermits. Comforting the settlers with vague assurances that the Poyaisian government would find them if they just stayed where they were, Hall set out for Cape Gracias a Dios, hoping to make contact with the Mosquito king or find another ship. Most of the emigrants found it impossible to believe that the Cazique had deliberately misled them, and posited that blame must lie elsewhere, or that <b>there</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> been some terrible misunderstanding.|$|E

25|$|The {{argument}} from necessary being asserts that all beings are contingent, {{meaning that it}} is possible for them not to exist. Aquinas argued that if everything can possibly not exist, <b>there</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> been a time when nothing existed; as things exist now, there must exist a being with necessary existence, regarded as God.|$|E
25|$|The unmoved mover {{argument}} asserts that, {{from our}} experience of motion in the universe (motion being the transition from potentiality to actuality) {{we can see that}} <b>there</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> been an initial mover. Aquinas argued that whatever is in motion must be put in motion by another thing, so there must be an unmoved mover.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{presence}} of hot springs, it is thought that <b>there</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> been a thermal bath complex already in the Hellenistic period, but probably at a smaller scale than the later Roman site. No architectural material was found in Allianoi belonging to this period apart from a few archaeological and numismatic clues.|$|E

25|$|In 1877 {{there were}} 58 daily trips from the MR over the Widened Lines their own South London depots {{and to the}} LB, LC and SER {{destinations}} mentioned above. <b>There</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> been a similar number of workings from the GNR, details {{of which can be}} found in the working timetables at the National Archives.|$|E
25|$|On 1 August 1955, {{the city}} {{recorded}} {{a temperature of}} -3.4°C (26°F), the lowest recorded temperature. This low was recorded in the urban area of the city, and since {{the interior of the}} municipality has a higher altitude, the temperature <b>there</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> been lower. The highest recorded temperature in Pelotas was 41°C (105°F), on 8 January 2006, registered at Pelotas International Airport.|$|E
25|$|R' Nachman Krochmal in Guide to the perplexed of {{our times}} (Hebrew, 1851) points to the Greek name Antigonos {{mentioned}} {{in the beginning of}} Avot as proof that <b>there</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> been a longer period to account for this sign of Hellenic influence. He posits that certain books of the Bible such as Kohelet and Isaiah were written or redacted during this period.|$|E

50|$|In 1828, {{the first}} urn graves from the Hallstatt culture (700-500 BC) were {{discovered}} on the “heath”. From these grave finds there is {{support for the}} belief that <b>there</b> <b>must</b> already <b>have</b> been settlers in the Bilkheim area well over 2,000 years ago.|$|R
25|$|Hutton {{reasoned}} that <b>there</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> been innumerable cycles, each involving deposition on the seabed, uplift with tilting and erosion then undersea again for further layers to be deposited. On {{the belief that}} {{this was due to}} the same geological forces operating in the past as the very slow geological forces seen operating at the present day, the thicknesses of exposed rock layers implied to him enormous stretches of time.|$|E
25|$|Jasper More's sons died, {{leaving no}} male heir. The estates {{were held in}} an entail whereby {{inheritance}} was restricted to male heirs, but Samuel father, Richard, in the marriage settlement paid 600 pounds to Jasper More, so <b>there</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> been clear title. It was arranged that Katherine would marry her cousin and indeed, on 4 February 1610, (old date style) Katherine, 25, the last unmarried daughter of Jasper, married 17-year-old cousin, Samuel More.|$|E

Nearly all were employed in the United States Government, some in rather high positions, notably in the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Justice, the Department of the Interior, the National Labor Relations Board, the Agricultural Adjustment Administration, the Railroad Retirement Board, the National Research Project — and others.|$|E
60|$|In no {{spirit of}} opposition, not {{by way of}} challenge, is {{anything}} here thrown out. These thoughts are sincere ones; they seem natural-- inevitable.

50|$|The {{relationship}} between ancient Indonesia and Cambodia dated {{back from the}} kingdom of Chenla and Javan Sailendra also Srivijaya; it was mentioned that king Jayavarman II had resided for some times in Java {{during the reign of}} Sailendras, and in 802 declare sovereignty of Cambodia from Java and proclaimed himself as universal monarch thus started the Angkor period. There are striking similarities between 9th century Bakong and Borobudur temple, which suggests that Borobudur was served as the prototype of Bakong. <b>There</b> <b>must</b> <b>had</b> been exchanges of travelers, if not missions, between Khmer kingdom and the Sailendras in Java.

25|$|On 18 April 1918, he was {{reassigned to}} take the command of the Royal Prussian Jasta 19. However, it seems <b>there</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> been some lag in his transfer, as victory number ten is scored to his old {{squadron}} on 20 April. On 2 May, he scored his first victory flying a Fokker D.VII for his new squadron. With four wins in May, one in June, and six in August, his score had soon grown to 21.|$|E
25|$|Aristotle {{disagreed}} with Plato on this point, arguing that all universals are instantiated. Aristotle {{argued that there}} are no universals that are unattached to existing things. According to Aristotle, if a universal exists, either as a particular or a relation, then <b>there</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> been, must be currently, or must be in the future, something on which the universal can be predicated. Consequently, according to Aristotle, if it is not the case that some universal can be predicated to an object that exists at some period of time, then it does not exist.|$|E
25|$|And the Earth is not {{the only}} one that changed - the {{luminosity}} of the sun has increased over time. Because rocks record a history of relatively constant temperatures since Earth’s beginnings, <b>there</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> been more greenhouse gasses to keep the temperatures up in the Archean when the sun was younger and fainter. All these major differences in the environment of the Earth placed very different constraints on the evolution of life throughout our planet’s history. Moreover, more subtle changes in the habitat of life are always occurring, shaping the organisms and traces that we observe today and in the rock record.|$|E
