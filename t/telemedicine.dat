25|$|As <b>telemedicine</b> {{technology}} improves, physicians {{will have}} better capabilities to remotely monitor patients {{in real-time and}} to communicate recommendations and medication adjustments as the situation demands, rather than waiting until the next office visit. <b>Telemedicine</b> using personal mobile devices, such as smartphones, will become increasingly important for monitoring patients with chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes.|$|E
25|$|In 1977, the Memorial University of Newfoundland Educational Television Centre {{implemented}} the <b>Telemedicine</b> project.|$|E
25|$|The {{mission of}} 'Medical Informatics' is {{to carry out}} {{research}} on health technology, <b>telemedicine,</b> bio-medical imaging and applications relevant to environments in developing countries.|$|E
25|$|ISRO {{has applied}} its {{technology}} for <b>telemedicine,</b> directly connecting patients {{in rural areas}} to medical professionals in urban locations via satellites. Since high-quality healthcare is not universally available {{in some of the}} remote areas of India, the patients in remote areas are diagnosed and analyzed by doctors in urban centers in real time via video conferencing. The patient is then advised medicine and treatment. The patient is then treated by the staff at one of the 'super-specialty hospitals' under instructions from the doctor. Mobile <b>telemedicine</b> vans are also deployed to visit locations in far-flung areas and provide diagnosis and support to patients.|$|E
25|$|Used {{primarily}} in ultrasound imaging, capturing the image {{produced by a}} medical imaging device is required for archiving and <b>telemedicine</b> applications. In most scenarios, a frame grabber is used in order to capture the video signal from the medical device and relay it to a computer for further processing and operations.|$|E
25|$|In 2014 MSF {{partnered with}} {{satellite}} operator SES, other NGOs Archemed, Fondation Follereau, Friendship Luxembourg and German Doctors, and the Luxembourg {{government in the}} pilot phase of SATMED, a project to use satellite broadband technology to bring eHealth and <b>telemedicine</b> to isolated areas of developing countries. SATMED was first deployed in Sierra Leone {{in support of the}} fight against Ebola.|$|E
25|$|Some {{electronic}} stethoscopes feature direct {{audio output}} {{that can be}} used with an external recording device, such as a laptop or MP3 recorder. The same connection can be used to listen to the previously recorded auscultation through the stethoscope headphones, allowing for more detailed study for general research as well as evaluation and consultation regarding a particular patient's condition and <b>telemedicine,</b> or remote diagnosis.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the sounds}} are {{transmitted}} electronically, an electronic stethoscope {{can be a}} wireless device, can be a recording device, and can provide noise reduction, signal enhancement, and both visual and audio output. Around 2001, Stethographics introduced PC-based software which enabled a phonocardiograph, graphic representation of cardiologic and pulmonologic sounds to be generated, and interpreted according to related algorithms. All of these features are helpful for purposes of <b>telemedicine</b> (remote diagnosis) and teaching.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, Lopez {{launched}} the Lopez Family Foundation (originally {{known as the}} Maribel Foundation) alongside her sister, Lynda. The nonprofit organization seeks to increase the availability of healthcare for underprivileged women and children, offering a <b>telemedicine</b> program supported by {{a partnership with the}} Children's Hospital Los Angeles. The foundation has led to the expansion of medical facilities in Panama and Puerto Rico, and created the Center for a Healthy Childhood at the Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx.|$|E
25|$|Publix and BayCare Health System {{announced}} a collaboration to provide telehealth and <b>telemedicine</b> services at specialized pharmacies in four Tampa Bay-area counties in March 2017. Pharmacies {{participating in the}} program have private rooms for patients to speak with a board-certified physician in BayCare's network via teleconferencing, plus diagnostic tools {{that can be used}} by the patient, with and without assistance from pharmacy staff. Doctors will be able to perform basic exams and write prescriptions for minor illnesses and conditions for patients.|$|E
25|$|It is a {{satellite}} for the SAARC region with 12 Ku-band transponders (36MHz each) and launch using the Indian Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle GSLV Mk-II. The {{total cost of}} launching the satellite {{is estimated to be}} about ₹2,350,000,000 (₹235 crore). The cost associated with the launch was met by the Government of India. The satellite enables full range of applications and services in the areas of telecommunication and broadcasting applications viz television (TV), direct-to-home (DTH), very small aperture terminals (VSATs), tele-education, <b>telemedicine</b> and disaster management support.|$|E
25|$|Telepharmacy is the {{delivery}} of pharmaceutical care via telecommunications to patients in locations where {{they may not have}} direct contact with a pharmacist. It is an instance of the wider phenomenon of <b>telemedicine,</b> as implemented in the field of pharmacy. Telepharmacy services include drug therapy monitoring, patient counseling, prior authorization and refill authorization for prescription drugs, and monitoring of formulary compliance with the aid of teleconferencing or videoconferencing. Remote dispensing of medications by automated packaging and labeling systems can also be thought of as an instance of telepharmacy. Telepharmacy services can be delivered at retail pharmacy sites or through hospitals, nursing homes, or other medical care facilities.|$|E
25|$|The {{trials are}} {{funded by the}} U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) under the <b>Telemedicine</b> and Advanced Technology Research Center (TATRC), a {{subordinate}} element of the United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC). DOD has extraordinary interests in the potential for antimicrobial copper surfaces to reduce hospital-acquired infections because it wants to prevent hospital-acquired infections among thousands of its enlisted armed forces servicemen and servicewomen who have been injured in recent conflicts. TATRC, which funds a Military Infectious Disease Program has been granted funds by the United States Congress to evaluate the antimicrobial effectiveness of copper, brass and bronze alloys. The studies are coordinated through the Advanced Technology Institute in Charleston, South Carolina.|$|E

25|$|Many {{students}} {{are involved in}} community service {{in one form or}} another. Annual events include Dance Marathon, a thirty-hour event that raised {{more than a million dollars}} for charity in 2011; and Project Pumpkin, a Halloween celebration hosted by the Northwestern Community Development Corps (NCDC) to which more than 800 local children are invited for an afternoon of games and sweets. NCDC's work is to connect hundreds of student volunteers to some twenty volunteer sites in Evanston and Chicago throughout the year. Many students have assisted with the Special Olympics and have taken alternative spring break trips to hundreds of service sites across the United States. Northwestern students also participate in the Freshman Urban Program, a program for students interested in community service. A large and growing number of students participate in the university's Global Engagement Studies Institute (GESI), a group service-learning expedition in Asia, Africa, or Latin America, in conjunction with the Foundation for Sustainable Development.
