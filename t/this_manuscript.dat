5|$|Griesbach {{agreed with}} Woide and {{expanded}} on Michaelis' point of view. If <b>this</b> <b>manuscript</b> has been corrupted from a version, {{it is more}} reasonable to suspect the Coptic, the version {{of the country in}} which it was written. Between <b>this</b> <b>manuscript</b> and both the Coptic and Syriac versions there is a remarkable coincidence. According to Griesbach the manuscript follows three different editions: the Byzantine in the Gospels, the Western in the Acts and General epistles, and the Alexandrian in the Pauline epistles. Griesbach designated the codex by letter A.|$|E

5|$|After the Venice 1640–41 revival {{there is}} no record of further {{performances}} of Il ritorno in Venice, or elsewhere, before the discovery of the music manuscript in the 19th century. The discovery of <b>this</b> <b>manuscript</b> in Vienna suggests that at some time the opera was staged there, or at least contemplated, perhaps before the Imperial court. The Monteverdi scholar Alan Curtis dates the manuscript's arrival in Vienna to 1675, during the reign of the Emperor LeopoldI who was a considerable patron of the arts, and opera in particular.|$|E
5|$|Another {{attack was}} made in 1521 by Paulus Bombasius, the prefect of the Vatican Library, because in Greek text Erasmus {{departed}} from the common readings of the Vulgate. He informed Erasmus that in the Vatican Library is held an extremely ancient copy of the Scriptures (i.e. Codex Vaticanus). He sent two extracts from <b>this</b> <b>manuscript</b> containing 1 John 4:1-3 and 1 John 5:7-11 (it did not include Comma).|$|E
5|$|In {{her book}} In the Land of Lady White Blood: Southern Thailand and the Meaning of History, Lorraine Gesick {{discussed}} a manuscript from Wat Pha Kho in Sathing Phra. The manuscript (which in Gesick's opinion {{dates from the}} late 17th century) consists mainly of an illustrated map about ten metres long that depicts Sultan Sulaiman's forts at Khao Daeng. A microfilm of <b>this</b> <b>manuscript,</b> made by American historian David Wyatt, is kept at the Cornell University Library.|$|E

5|$|The {{interchange}} of vowels {{of similar}} sounds is very frequent in <b>this</b> <b>manuscript.</b> The letters Ν and Μ are occasionally confused, and the cluster ΓΓ is substituted with ΝΓ. This {{may be an}} argument which points to Egypt, {{but it is not}} universally conceded. A lot of iotacistic errors occur in the text; for example, αὶ is exchanged for ε, εὶ for ὶ and η for ὶ. It has not more iotacisms than other manuscripts of the same date.|$|E
5|$|A {{manuscript}} {{of the first}} quarter of the ninth century, Vatican Pal. lat. 899 (Codex Palatinus), known as P, and its direct and indirect copies. P was written at Lorsch in Caroline minuscule. The text in <b>this</b> <b>manuscript</b> has several lacunae marked with dots indicating the missing letters, a confusion in the order of the biographies between Verus and Alexander, and the transposition of several passages: two long ones which correspond to a quire of the original which became loose and was then inserted in a wrong place, and a similar transposition in Carus. P is also distinguished by a succession of six centuries of editorial corrections, beginning with the original scribe, and includes such worthies as Petrarch and Poggio Bracciolini; none of these editors betray any knowledge of any other witness.|$|E
5|$|As {{well as the}} two {{complete}} manuscripts, {{a number}} of other manuscripts contain parts of the whole work. British Library MS Cotton Titus A.i, usually known as the Gmanuscript, has part of Book II, and dates from the late 12th or early 13th century. British Library MS Cotton Domitian A.xv, known as the B manuscript, dates from the late 13th or early 14th century and includes some other material along with Book I and the same parts of Book II as in manuscript G. Another Cottonian manuscript, British Library MS Cotton Vespasian A.xix, has parts of Book III, and dates to between 1257 and 1286. <b>This</b> <b>manuscript</b> is usually known as the A manuscript.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} {{writing was}} retraced by a later scribe (usually dated to the 10th or 11th century), {{and the beauty}} of the original script was spoiled. Accents and breathing marks, as well as punctuation, have been added by a later hand. There are no enlarged initials, no divisions into chapters or sections such as are found in later manuscripts, but a different system of division peculiar to <b>this</b> <b>manuscript.</b> There are plenty of the itacistic faults, especially the exchange of ει for ι and αι for ε. The exchange of ει and ο for ω is less frequent.|$|E
5|$|The 1913 {{edition of}} the Catholic Encyclopedia lists several {{separate}} accounts of the saint's deeds and miracles, or so-called Lives. The Life (or Vita) printed in John Capgrave's Nova, Legenda and used by the Bollandists, was perhaps copied from a Cotton manuscript in the British Museum. There is another Vita in Latin in the same collection, {{but it was so}} damaged by fire that it is useless. The surviving versions of the Vita Sexburge were compiled after 1106 (the year the relics of Seaxburh were translated) and are copies from an earlier manuscript, now lost. The Vita describes Seaxburh's early life, marriage to Eorcenberht, withdrawal to Milton and then Minster-in-Sheppey, and her final years as a nun and the abbess at Ely. The section relating to her life at Sheppey is similar to another fragment, dating between the 9th and 11th centuries, and currently kept at Lambeth Palace. It has been suggested that part of the Vita Sexburge was derived from <b>this</b> <b>manuscript,</b> or that both parts originated from an earlier version of Seaxburh's Life.|$|E
5|$|The {{manuscript}} {{is written}} primarily in insular majuscule with some occurrences of minuscule letters (usually e or s). The text is usually written in one long line across the page. Françoise Henry identified {{at least three}} scribes in <b>this</b> <b>manuscript,</b> whom she named Hand A, Hand B, and Hand C. Hand A is found on folios 1 through 19v, folios 276 through 289, and folios 307 {{through the end of}} the manuscript. Hand A, for the most part, writes eighteen or nineteen lines per page in the brown gall-ink common throughout the West. Hand B is found on folios 19r through 26 and folios 124 through 128. Hand B has a somewhat greater tendency to use minuscule and uses red, purple and black ink and a variable number of lines per page. Hand C is found throughout the majority of the text. Hand C also has greater tendency to use minuscule than Hand A. Hand C uses the same brownish gall-ink used by hand A and wrote, almost always, seventeen lines per page.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The Programming Language (CS 383) course in-troduces the {{concepts}} {{that serve as}} a basis for programming languages. It aims to provide the students with a basic under-standing and appreciation of the various essential program-ming language constructs, programming paradigms, evalua-tion criteria and language implementation issues. The course covers concepts from imperative, object-oriented, functional, logic programming and scripting languages. These concepts are illustrated by examples from varieties of languages such as Pascal, C, Java, Smalltalk, Scheme, ML, Haskell, Prolog, Perl etc. As the final examination is coming, I make notes on all the topics has been given and bring out <b>this</b> review <b>manuscripts.</b> As <b>this</b> <b>manuscripts</b> is finished, my understanding on this course is definitely deepened...|$|R
5|$|There is {{only one}} early {{manuscript}} of Y Gododdin, the Book of Aneirin, thought to date from {{the second half of}} the 13th century. The currently accepted view is that <b>this</b> <b>manuscript</b> contains the work of two scribes, usually known as A and B. Scribe A wrote down 88 stanzas of the poem, then left a blank page before writing down four related poems known as Gorchanau. This scribe wrote the material down in Middle Welsh orthography. Scribe B added material later, and apparently had access to an earlier manuscript since the material added by this scribe is in Old Welsh orthography. Scribe B wrote 35 stanzas, some of which are variants of stanzas also given by Scribe A while others are not given by A. The last stanza is incomplete and three folios are missing from the end of the manuscript, so some material may have been lost.|$|E
5|$|There is {{only one}} extant {{manuscript}} of Candide that was written before the work's 1759 publication; it was discovered in 1956 by Wade and since named the La Vallière Manuscript. It {{is believed to have}} been sent, chapter by chapter, by Voltaire to the Duke and Duchess La Vallière in the autumn of 1758. The manuscript was sold to the Bibliothèque de l'Arsenal in the late eighteenth century, where it remained undiscovered for almost two hundred years. The La Vallière Manuscript, the most original and authentic of all surviving copies of Candide, was probably dictated by Voltaire to his secretary, Jean-Louis Wagnière, then edited directly. In addition to <b>this</b> <b>manuscript,</b> there {{is believed to have been}} another, one copied by Wagnière for the Elector Charles-Théodore, who hosted Voltaire during the summer of 1758. The existence of this copy was first postulated by Norman L. Torrey in 1929. If it exists, it remains undiscovered.|$|E
