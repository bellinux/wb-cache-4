50|$|The mark here {{is called}} Sricharanam. Members of the Sri Vaishnava {{tradition}} form tilak with two lines representing {{the feet of}} Narayana, with a red line in the middle which representing Lakshmidevi. A small line on the <b>top</b> <b>bridge</b> of the nose which represents that the wearer belongs to the Thenkalai subsect. Because the Sri Vaishnava sampradaya begins with Lakshmi, and because they approach Narayana through Lakshmi, their tilak reflects this process of surrender, known as Saranagati (or sometimes also Prapatti). Within Sri Vaishnavism, this process of surrender (sarangati) to Vishnu. A variant to this is found within the Ramanandi sect, begun by Ramananda, who wear a similar tilak design but in reference to Sita and Rama (whom their devotion is focused upon) rather than Lakshmi and Narayana.|$|E

50|$|Its {{simplest}} {{and later}} form consists of five rods. A central iron rod runs {{up from the}} bob to a point immediately below the suspension. At that point a cross-piece (middle bridge) extends from the central rod and connects to two zinc rods, {{one on each side}} of the central rod, which reach down to, and are fixed to, the bottom bridge just above the bob. The bottom bridge clears the central rod and connects to two further iron rods which run back up to the <b>top</b> <b>bridge</b> attached to the suspension. As the iron rods expand in heat, the bottom bridge drops relative to the suspension, and the bob drops relative to the middle bridge. However, the middle bridge rises relative to the bottom one because the greater expansion of the zinc rods pushes the middle bridge, and therefore the bob, upwards to match the combined drop caused by the expanding iron.|$|E
50|$|In December 1965 a {{generator}} coil failed on unit 2, {{followed by a}} series of further failures between 1971 and 73, which in an effort to correct, the windings were reversed. Units 1, 3 and 4 had their stators rewound in 1975 to 76.The sluice gates 3 in 1996 and gate 2 in 2001 were modified to enable the power station to pass an increased maximum design flood of 200,000 cusec (5,663 m3/s). Gate 1 was also plugged with concrete. To improve the structures seismic withstand ability the original heavy chain and counterweight spillway gate operating system was replaced with a hydraulic system while the dam's <b>top</b> <b>bridge</b> was strengthened and the gantry towers lowered.In the 1990s the power station's control systems were automated with new control and protection systems which allowed it to be demanned. Control of the power station is now undertaken from a control centre at Clyde Power Station. On 1 April 1996 ownership of Roxburgh was transferred to Contact Energy, a State Owned Enterprise which subsequently passed into private ownership in 1999.With the separation of Transpower a new control room was constructed on the former carpark to house the Transpower equipment needed to operate the transmission equipment. The original air blast circuit breakers were replaced with Sprecher & Schuh SF6 circuit breakers in the late 1980s.|$|E

Rh 6 demonstrates two different active sites of almost equal energies for CO adsorption. Highly stable clusters show weak CO adsorption behavior. We also observe that the magnetic moment of the clusters is usually reduced after the CO adsorption. The preference of the active sites for CO adsorption has been analyzed using the charge density difference plots...|$|E

40|$|This study {{represents}} a detailed DFT periodic-slab {{study on the}} interaction between atomic chlorine and the Fe(100) surface. Energetic and structural parameters are calculated {{for a wide range}} of coverages corresponding to <b>top,</b> <b>bridge</b> and hollow pure on-surface adsorptions. Calculated chemisorbed energies are found to increase gradually with the degree of coverage. Formation of iron chlorides via substitutional adsorption is predicted to be not feasible in view of the calculated chemisorption energies. This finding is in line with earlier experimental measurements with regard to the absence of chlorine diffusion into bulk Fe. Sublimation energies for FeCl 2 and FeCl 3 are estimated and discussed to elucidate the fate of the chlorine-iron thin layer. A stability temperature-pressure diagram is constructed {{for a wide range of}} chlorine chemical potentials to mimic real operational conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{process of}} {{adsorption}} of methanol on a Si(100) - 2 x I surface {{has been investigated}} theoretically, using density functional theory and a periodic boundary condition. The methanol adsorption on Si(100) - 2 x I {{is known to be}} dissociative, resulting in hydrogen((methanol)) -oxygen((surface)) and oxygen((methanol)) -silicon((surface)) bond formation. Adsorption energies have been calculated here for five different surface sites for the methoxy fragment (<b>top,</b> <b>bridge,</b> cave, valley-bridge and pedestal). The top site was found to be energetically most favourable. Surface sites bridging Si atoms from the first and second atomic layers were found to be energetically equivalent to the top site.

These various hydrogen positions only influenced the adsorption energies marginally...|$|E

Three graphene structures, one intrinsic and two with defects (vacancy and sustitution), and four H 2 S concentrations have been studied.
