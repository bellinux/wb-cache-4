Benzene, toluene, xylenes and ethylbenzene (BTX+EB) are good or even better octane boosters, although the use of benzene is limited due to its carcinogenic nature.

40|$|The liquid-phase {{synthesis}} of octane enhancing ethers like methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) or <b>tertiary</b> <b>amyl</b> <b>methyl</b> <b>ether</b> (TAME) is increasingly realized as a reactive distillation process catalysed by ion exchange resins. To study the occurring {{physical and chemical}} phenomena of those systems, the present paper deals with a reactive batch distillation process in a heated still. The model is based on phase equilibrium between the liquid and the vapour phase and an adequate kinetic formulation of the heterogeneously catalysed etherification by application of the generalized Langmuir-Hinshelwood rate expressions. To describe the non-ideal mixture behaviour, liquid-phase activities are introduced. Simulation {{results show that the}} shape of residue curves depends on two essential parameters, the Damkohler number Da and the operating pressure p. The values of these parameters influence the existence and the position of stable nodes, saddles and separatrices in the residue curve map. The evaluated trajectories deviate quantitatively from those recently reported for homogeneous catalysis. The most interesting result {{lies in the fact that}} the lightest boiling component can be enriched in the still...|$|E

40|$|Fushun, {{a region}} that lacks fossil energy resources, mainly depends on {{transportation}} from Daqing oilfield to meet its increasing energy demand. Waste of natural resources {{have an effect on}} the local environment and pollute the air and water and damage vegetation and ecological environment. The rich C 5 resources from refinery in the south and east of Fushun, however, hold out the hope of C 5 utilization industrialization, an innovative method to Fushun energy issue. It has higher energy efficiency than traditional method and the production is easier to store and transport.

40|$|This {{overview}} {{was developed}} {{as part of}} a symposium on noncancer end points of gasoline and key gasoline components. The specific components included are methyl tertiary butyl ether, ethyl tertiary butyl ether, <b>tertiary</b> <b>amyl</b> <b>methyl</b> <b>ether,</b> butadiene, benzene, xylene, toluene, methyl alcohol, and ethyl alcohol. The overview focuses on neurotoxic effects related to chronic low-level exposures. A few general conclusions and recommendations can be made {{based on the results of}} the studies to date. a) All the compounds reviewed are neuroactive and, as such, should be examined for their neurotoxicity. b) For most of the compounds, there is a substantial margin of safety between the current permissible exposure levels and levels that would be expected to cause overt signs of neurotoxicity in humans. This is not the case for xylene, toluene, and methanol, however, where neurologic effects are observed at or below the current Threshold Limit Value. c) For most of the compounds, the relationship between chronic low-level exposure and subtle neurotoxic effects has not been studied. Studies therefore should focus on examining the dose-response relationship between chronic low-level exposure and subtle changes in central nervous system function...|$|E
40|$|The octane {{enhancer}} <b>tertiary</b> <b>amyl</b> <b>methyl</b> <b>ether</b> (TAME) {{is produced}} by liquid phase synthesis from methanol and a mixture of isoamylenes, namely 2 -methyl- 1 -butene and 2 -methyl- 2 -butene, using a sulfonic acid ion exchange resin as catalyst. Three reactions take place simultaneously in TAME synthesis: etherification of the two methylbutenes and their isomerisation. In order to study the equilibrium of the multiple reactions in TAME synthesis, the thermodynamic properties of the compounds in the liquid phase and equilibrium constants were calculated using a modified UNIFAC method to describe the nonideality of the system. Four parameters influencing the equilibrium conversion were derived and discussed in detail. Supplemental experiments were performed at three temperatures {{in the range from}} 303 to 343 K and at different initial molar ratios of educts. Equilibrium conversions of methanol were determined from these experiments and compared with calculated values. At 298 K the predicted activity based equilibrium constant was 22. 9 for TAME synthesis from 2 -methyl- 1 -butene and 1. 6 for TAME synthesis from 2 -methyl- 2 -butene; for isomerisation of 2 -methyl- 1 -butene to 2 -methyl- 2 -butene a value of 14. 3 was obtained...|$|E
40|$|This article {{describes}} {{the results of a}} statistical analysis on MTBE relative to other gasoline oxygenates based on groundwater monitoring data collected in Los Angeles County, CA. The other gasoline oxygenates in this study include di-isopropyl ether (DIPE), ethyl tertiary butyl ether (ETBE), <b>tertiary</b> <b>amyl</b> <b>methyl</b> <b>ether</b> (TAME), and tertiary butyl alcohol (TBA). Corre-lation coefficients were calculated between MTBE and other ox-ygenates, and between the gasoline oxygenates and depth to groundwater and geological material type of aquifer. The corre-lation coefficients indicated poor correlation among all compo-nents mentioned. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare MTBE concentrations detected in aquifers comprised chiefly of coarse-grained material with those comprised of fine-grained material. The ANOVA results indicated that the differ-ence is not statistically significant between MTBE detected in the two types of aquifer materials. Similar results were also reached for TBA. The oxygenate concentration distributions were further studied by grouping the data according to different gasoline brands. There is not an overall statistically clear trend on whether certain brands of gasoline contain MTBE and TBA consistently higher than other brands, or whether TBA is consis-tently higher than MTBE among all brands of gasoline. How-ever, TBA shows statistically higher than MTBE in the mean, the median, and the 95 th percentile in the overall groundwater data studied. Therefore, further studies on the relationship be-tween MTBE and TBA are warranted...|$|E

3000|$|Alcohols and ethers {{are used}} as oxygenated {{additives}} to motor fuels and as antiknock components in gasoline. They increase the octane number and reduce the emissions of gases to greenhouse effect (CO x [...] and NO x [...]). These oxygenated compounds have partially replaced the lead-based salts that are toxic and pollutant. Among the tertiary ethers, such as ethyl tertiary butyl ether, tertiary amyl ethyl ether and <b>tertiary</b> <b>amyl</b> <b>methyl</b> <b>ether,</b> MTBE is the oxygenated additive currently, {{the most widely used}} in the reformulated gasoline and also one of organic chemicals the most produced industrially [1]. However, the major drawback of this ether is its easy diffusion in the ground water, its slow biological breakdown and its unpleasant odour. The diisopropyl ether (DIPE) can be a potential candidate to substitute the MTBE. It has the advantage to increase the octane number and to have a lower vapour pressure. Various works proposed the synthesis of the DIPE from propene and water in a two-stage process [2], from a feed of acetone and hydrogen in a two-stage process [3] or one-step process [4] and from acetone feedstock [5]. The DIPE can be also synthesised either from a feed of propylene and water [6] or from a feed of propene and isopropanol over an acidic ion exchange resin like Amberlyst 15 [7]. The synthesis of the DIPE from the isopropanol decomposition was examined over aluminosilicates supported sulfopolyphenylketone (or polyphenylketone) [8] and over sulphated titania [9].|$|E

In this study we {{examined the effects of}} MTBE on the MTBE-oxidizing activity of M. vaccae JOB 5 grown on diverse nonalkane substrates. Carbon-limited cultures were grown on glycerol, lactate, several sugars, and tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, both in the presence and absence of MTBE. In all MTBE-containing cultures, MTBE consumption occurred and tertiary butyl alcohol (TBA) and tertiary butyl formate accumulated in the culture medium. Acetylene, a specific inactivator of alkane- and MTBE-oxidizing activities, fully inhibited MTBE consumption and product accumulation but had no other apparent effects on culture growth. The MTBE-dependent stimulation of MTBE-oxidizing activity in fructose- and glycerol-grown cells was saturable with respect to MTBE concentration (50 % saturation level = 2. 4 to 2. 75 mM), and the onset of MTBE oxidation in glycerol-grown cells was inhibited by both rifampin and chloramphenicol. Other oxygenates (TBA and <b>tertiary</b> <b>amyl</b> <b>methyl</b> <b>ether)</b> also induced the enzyme activity required for their own degradation in glycerol-grown cells. Presence of MTBE also promoted MTBE oxidation in cells grown on organic acids, compounds that are often found in anaerobic, gasoline-contaminated environments. Experiments with acid-grown cells suggested induction of MTBE-oxidizing activity by MTBE is subject to catabolite repression. The results of this study are discussed in terms of their potential implications towards our understanding of the role of cometabolism in MTBE and TBA biodegradation in gasoline-contaminated environments...|$|E
