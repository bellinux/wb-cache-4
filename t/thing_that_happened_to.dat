Banks {{said in an interview}} with the Newcastle Evening Chronicle that leaving Warwick University led him to become a published writer. Banks said, [...] "If I'd stayed on, I probably would have gone down the acting route instead of writing. University isn't for everyone and I discovered that the other writers I know didn't finish their courses either. It was certainly the best <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> me." ...|$|E

500|$|Nina Leen took twelve pictures, {{of which}} one {{appeared}} in Life. Barnett Newman {{had insisted that}} the group be photographed like bankers. The artists were allowed to position themselves. Hedda Sterne, who had arrived late, {{is seen in the}} back (standing on a table). She is the only woman in the photograph and would later describe the experience as [...] "probably the worst <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> me". Painter Lee Krasner believed Sterne was allowed at the insistence of art dealer Betty Parsons, who represented many in the group.|$|E
500|$|Despite Coveleski's {{success in}} Cleveland, {{he was not}} a fan of playing there; he stated that he [...] "didn't like the town. Now the people are all right, but I just didn't like the town." [...] He also stated that it began to affect his {{performance}} on the mound, and that he began to get [...] "lazy" [...] from being with the club so long. He did, however, have praise for his catcher: [...] "The best <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> me there was pitching to Steve O'Neill. He caught me for nine years in Cleveland and knew me so well he didn't even need to give me a sign".|$|E
500|$|In a December 2012 interview, Winkelman {{expressed}} some regret {{about what}} had happened. [...] "I'm not {{proud of the way}} this club came to exist, and I am totally prepared to be the villain of the piece, but I can't put the genie back in the bottle," [...] he said. [...] "Do I think it was right? No. Do I think it was a great <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> Wimbledon? No... I don’t feel in the right over the way this club was born. But I don’t think I could live with myself if I hadn't gone out and bought the club when it was hours away from liquidation. It was about to be completely finito... What happened was my fault, and I have to take responsibility for it. But I don’t see why my players, staff and our young supporter base should be forced to carry the can and live with the nastiness, it's nothing to do with them." ...|$|E

500|$|Although Cherry {{points out}} that Chamberlain was an egotist, {{he added that he}} had good {{relationships}} with many contemporaries and enjoyed a great deal of respect. He was especially lauded for his good rapport with his fans, often providing tickets and signing autographs. Dr. Jack Ramsay recalled that Chamberlain regularly took walks in downtown Philadelphia and acknowledged honking horns with the air of a man enjoying all the attention. Jerry West called him a [...] "complex... very nice person", and NBA rival Jack McMahon even said: [...] "The best <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> the NBA is that God made Wilt a nice person... he could have killed us all with his left hand." [...] Celtics contemporary Bob Cousy even assumed that if Chamberlain had been less fixated on being popular, he would have been meaner and able to win more titles. During most of his NBA career, Chamberlain was good friends with Bill Russell. Chamberlain often invited Russell over to Thanksgiving, and at Russell's place, conversation mostly concerned Russell's electric trains. But as the championship count became increasingly lopsided, the relationship got strained, and turned hostile after Russell accused Chamberlain of [...] "copping out" [...] in the notorious Game 7 of the 1969 NBA Finals. The two men did not talk to each other for over 20 years, until Russell apologized privately, then publicly in a 1997 joint interview with Bob Costas: [...] "There was a thing almost 30 years ago... I was wrong." [...] Still, Chamberlain maintained a level of bitterness, regretted that he should have been [...] "more physical" [...] with Russell in their games and privately continued accusing his rival for [...] "intellectualizing" [...] basketball in a negative way.|$|E

A friend, Irma Leveton, later recalled, [...] "Valerie {{was the only}} decent <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> Curly {{and the only one}} that really cared about him." [...] Although his health continued to decline after the marriage, Valerie gave birth to a daughter, Janie, in 1948.|$|E
2500|$|During {{training}} in Zaire, Foreman suffered a cut above his eye, forcing postponement {{of the match}} for a month. The injury affected his training regimen, as it meant he could not spar in the build-up to the fight and risk the cut being re-opened. He later commented: [...] "That was the best <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> Ali {{when we were in}} Africa—the fact that I had {{to get ready for the}} fight without being able to box." [...] Foreman later also claimed he was drugged by his trainer prior to the bout. Ali used this time to tour Zaire, endearing himself to the public while taunting Foreman at every opportunity. Foreman was favored, having knocked out both Joe Frazier and Ken Norton within two rounds.|$|E

2500|$|During early {{conceptions of}} the album, Norwood had wanted to re-unite with Rodney [...] "Darkchild" [...] Jerkins – her {{longtime}} collaborator who had executive-produced Human (2008). However mid-way through 2009, during an interview with Out magazine, Norwood refused to talk about Human, telling interviews [...] "to hell with that album" [...] when questions were asked about it. It wasn't until 2010 when Norwood would break her silence during an episode of her VH1 reality TV show Brandy and Ray J: A Family Business. During one of the episodes when her brother Ray J announces {{that he wants to}} work with Darkchild, Norwood reveals that she felt the producer [...] "did not put his all into the album", and that [...] "was a personal issue between me and him." [...] Elaborating on what she meant, Norwood replied [...] "You know what kind of chemistry Rodney and I have too, but on some personal issues, he doesn't deliver.....I don't want the same <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> me, to happen to you.".|$|E
2500|$|Standing five foot, nine {{inches tall}} and {{weighing}} 170 pounds, Loob arrived in Calgary facing skepticism {{that he would be}} able to withstand the rougher North American game and smaller ice surface compared to what he was used to in the Elitserien. Opinion around the NHL in the early 1980s was that Swedish players were [...] "soft"; teammate Colin Patterson credited Loob with changing that perception. [...] He was a vocal leader, unafraid to speak to his teammates when he felt it necessary. [...] He was a strong skater with [...] "dazzling technique", and former Calgary linemate Joe Nieuwendyk said Loob was a key reason for his own early success in the NHL: [...] "He just had such a great amount of skill. He could do things none of the rest of us could. The luckiest <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> me was getting put on Hakan Loob’s line my first full year in Calgary. He helped me so much, starting my career the right way. A big reason why I scored 50." [...] Nieuwendyk added that Loob could [...] "put pucks into areas, make plays, nobody else would dream of".|$|E
2500|$|Muriel's {{participation}} in the Student Christian Movement (SCM) at McGill was a life-changing experience. [...] "Looking back over the years," [...] she told her biographer, [...] "I've felt always {{that the experience of}} the SCM was the most important <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> me, probably {{the most important aspect of}} my college life, more important than any of the courses that I took." [...] The SCM conducted small study groups in which students were encouraged to discuss their beliefs freely and come to their own conclusions about how to interpret the Gospels. For Muriel, such discussions were unsettling and painful, yet also exciting. [...] "I had always before treated the Gospel as though its authors had set down day by day events in the life of Jesus as they happened," [...] she said. [...] "To face the implication that nothing was written down until after Jesus died was itself a shock. But this question of free and open discussion, that everything needed to be challenged, to be questioned, to be talked about, that was completely opposite to the authoritarian approach in the church." [...] The SCM study groups fostered independent thinking. [...] "This was the beginning of my adult search for truth," [...] Muriel told her biographer, [...] "and my sense that all things must be open to me." ...|$|E
