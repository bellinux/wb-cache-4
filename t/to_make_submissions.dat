5|$|Committee {{inquiries}} typically {{begin with}} the reference of an issue or a proposed law to the committee for inquiry and report back to the Senate. The committee will make a call for submissions, seeking public input on the matter referred to the committee. It will often publish those submissions to help inform stakeholders of the views that are being put to the committee. A committee will often hold one or more public hearings, at which committee members ask questions of key stakeholders interested in the issue under inquiry. These hearings may be held anywhere in Australia, are often broadcast, and result in a published transcript (Hansard) that records the evidence taken. The opportunity <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>submissions,</b> and the greater accessibility of the committees compared to parliament itself, can provide disadvantaged individuals and organisations valued opportunities to engage in democratic processes. Committees also frequently ask relevant government agencies to respond to issues raised by submissions or evidence given to the inquiry. Once evidence has been gathered there usually follows a period of research and analysis by the committee. It will then deliver {{a report to the}} Senate, which will generally include recommendations. The Commonwealth government is then expected to table a response to the report, stating responses to any recommendations the committee may have made.|$|E
25|$|Public {{submissions}} on the Bill {{closed on}} 7 September 2007. Radio New Zealand reported on 31 August that the Government had indicated it might {{write to the}} Committee indicating that it intended to make unspecified changes to {{the parts of the}} legislation dealing with third parties. This would have prevented the Committee from hearing criticism of the existing provisions and allow the Government to introduce changes during the Committee of the Whole House without the public being able <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>submissions</b> on the new provisions. Then Prime Minister Helen Clark denied this.|$|E

50|$|In 1661, {{after the}} {{restoration}} of Charles II, Strode was imprisoned and obliged <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>submission</b> for disobeying the orders of the king's deputy-lieutenants in Somerset. He died in 1666, aged 77.|$|R
60|$|During the king's stay {{in these}} parts, his armies were not idle, his troops, {{on one side}} under the Rhinegrave, a brave and ever-fortunate commander, and under the Landgrave of Hesse, on the other, ranged the country from Lorraine to Luxemburg, and past the Moselle on the west, and the Weser on the north. Nothing could stand before them: the Spanish army which came to the relief of the Catholic Electors was {{everywhere}} defeated and beaten quite out of the country, and the Lorraine army quite ruined. 'Twas a most pleasant court sure as ever was seen, where every day expresses arrived of armies defeated, towns surrendered, contributions agreed upon, parties routed, prisoners taken, and princes sending ambassadors to sue for truces and neutralities, <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>submissions</b> and compositions, and to pay arrears and contributions.|$|E
50|$|Throughout the 1850s Linnig {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>submissions</b> to the Salons in Antwerp and Brussels.|$|E
50|$|Swain's counsel {{requested}} <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>submissions</b> {{before the}} Lieutenant Governor {{at the time}} when the Board's recommendation was made, but before the Lieutenant Governor made a decision. The request was denied.|$|E
50|$|This {{arrangement}} lasted till 1118/1119, when Thurstan, archbishop-elect, refused <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>submission</b> <b>to</b> Canterbury, and {{in consequence}} the Archbishop of Canterbury, Ralph d'Escures, declined to consecrate him. Thurstan thereupon successfully appealed to Pope Calixtus II, {{who not only}} himself consecrated him, but also gave him a Bull releasing him and his successors from the supremacy of Canterbury.|$|R
50|$|After {{many local}} nobles {{left on the}} First Crusade, among them Godfrey, Henry's {{power in the region}} of Belgica was greatly {{increased}} and he abused it, especially against the monasteries. The emperor intervened and took Limburg in July 1101. Henry was now forced <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>submission</b> and he was granted the duchy of Lower Lorraine, which Godfrey had abandoned on Crusade.|$|R
50|$|A {{foundation}} Member and State Convenor of Emily's List in Australia, Ritchie {{was also}} active {{in supporting the}} election of women candidates to Australian Parliaments. Ritchie actively lobbied the Howard and Rudd governments for {{the introduction of a}} paid maternity leave scheme for all Australian women and was one of only four Australian MPs <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>submission</b> <b>to</b> the Productivity Commission’s inquiry into Paid Parental Leave.|$|R

50|$|From 1067 or 1068 to 1091, Gaeta {{was ruled}} by the Norman Ridello family. Their power was set in Gaeta and Geoffrey Ridello ruled from Pontecorvo, but the Gaetans were not {{completely}} weaned from their independent past yet. On the death of Jordan I of Capua, Gaeta rebelled against Norman rule and set up as their duke one Landulf. He ruled successfully until 1103, because the Norman prince of Capua, Richard II, was exiled from his capital. In 1103, William Blosseville conquered the city and in turn was conquered by Richard of Aquila in 1105. Richard was a de facto independent duke as were his successors. The death of Jordan I had sapped the Norman dynasty of Capua of its authority and this had a great effect on Gaeta. After Richard's death (1111), Gaeta was ruled by Andrew Dell'Aquila until 1113, when Richard of Caleno got it. Finally, in 1135, Richard of Caleno was forced <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>submission</b> <b>to</b> King Roger, who had forced the last prince of Capua, Robert II, <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>submission</b> the same year.|$|R
50|$|On Boso's {{death in}} January 887, the Provençal barons elected Ermengard {{to act as}} his regent, {{with the support of}} Richard. In May, Ermengard {{travelled}} with her son Louis to the court of Charles the Fat, and received his recognition of the young Louis as king. Charles adopted Louis as his son and put both mother and son under his protection. In May 889, she travelled to Charles' successor, Arnulf, <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>submission</b> anew.|$|R
50|$|Under that {{provision}} of the Supreme Court Act, the federal Cabinet may submit a question to the Supreme Court of Canada, {{by means of an}} order-in-council. Once the questions have been submitted to the Court, the Court has complete control over the process to be followed. The reference is treated {{in the same way as}} an appeal. The Attorney General of Canada is entitled to appear before the Court and <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>submissions.</b> The Attorneys General of the provinces and territories are entitled to notice of a reference and may appear on it. Interested parties are able to apply for intervener status <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>submissions</b> during the hearing. Where necessary the Court may appoint an amicus curiae to submit a factum to support a particular view.|$|E
50|$|On June 12, 1985, the Lieutenant Governor {{issued a}} warrant further detaining Swain {{to be held}} in safe custody in a mental health {{hospital}} for assessment, and to report to the Advisory Review Board in 30 days. Neither Swain nor his counsel were notified about the decision, or given an opportunity <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>submissions.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Despite the {{creation}} of the new local government authorities in 2008, many citizens continued to object to the council amalgamations. During the 2012 Queensland state election campaign, the Liberal National Party promised to reconsider the amalgamations.

50|$|In 1567 Shane {{was murdered}} by the MacDonnells of Antrim, and Sidney turned his {{attention}} to the south, where he arranged the quarrel between Gerald FitzGerald, 15th Earl of Desmond, and Thomas Butler, 10th Earl of Ormond, and he executed or imprisoned others he deemed to be disturbers of the peace; then, returning to Ulster, he compelled Turlough Luineach O'Neill, Shane's successor in the chieftainship, <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>submission,</b> and placed garrisons at Belfast and Carrickfergus to overawe Tyrone and the Glynns.|$|R
50|$|Benevento {{was forced}} <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>submission</b> <b>to</b> the Byzantine Empire, whose Italian catepan Boiannes {{had built the}} {{fortified}} city of Troia nearby. In 1022, the Emperor Henry II joined his army with two other armies under Poppo of Aquileia and Pilgrim of Cologne at Benevento, which submitted after a quick siege. From there they marched on Troia, but failed to take it. After making submission to the Western Emperor, Landulf is not heard of again {{in the pages of}} history until his death and his son takes his place.|$|R
50|$|From 1092 to 1098, the Drengots were {{expelled}} from Capua by the Lombard citizenry. After their reinstallation, the dynasty declined {{more and more}} in relative power. They still attempted to defend the papacy, but to little success. They were forced <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>submission</b> <b>to</b> the duke of Apulia and then the king of Sicily. Robert II of Capua revolted against the latter and spent his life trying, with the aid of Emperor and Pope, to retake his principality, but to no avail. He died in 1156 and the Drengot power was completely broken.|$|R
50|$|A {{majority}} Court {{found that}} Nicholson {{was entitled to}} a common law duty of fairness and so {{should have been able}} <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>submissions</b> to the employer and should have been notified orally or in writing. This paralleled the UK House of Lords decision in Ridge v Baldwin, which was quoted with approval by Laskin C.J.|$|E
50|$|The blocklists {{are also}} {{managed by the}} public, {{but there is no}} {{fool-proof}} method on checking or reporting why an IP address or range are bad, nor on checking if the blocked IP addresses still remain bad. The list relies on the public <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>submissions,</b> and thus is vulnerable to attack itself (see above section on blocklist management issues).|$|E
50|$|The {{hearings}} {{began in}} February 2004. The Palestinian Authority {{is not a}} member of the court but was allowed to make a submission by virtue of being a UN observer and a co-sponsor of the General Assembly resolution. In January 2004, the court also authorized the League of Arab States and the Organisation of the Islamic Conference <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>submissions.</b>|$|E
50|$|Even {{more than}} his father's reign, Landulf's saw {{the decline of the}} principality. Forced <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>submission</b> <b>to</b> both Byzantium and then Henry, Benevento could hardly claim even de facto {{independence}} any longer. Furthermore, the lengthy period (47 years) of his rule saw the beginnings of a Byzantine resurgence in Apulia and the Lombard response. Benevento did its best to be on the winning side, but only offered the anti-Greek rebels clandestine support. By his death, the once-great principality had dwindled territorially to little more than the city and its surrounding countryside.|$|R
5000|$|Guy was {{originally}} under the tutorship and regency of his mother, Helena Angelina Komnene, {{who was forced}} <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>submission</b> <b>to</b> Isabella of Villehardouin in December 1289. In 1291, she married her second husband, Hugh of Brienne, and he became bailiff of the duchy. Guy reached his majority in 1296 and did homage to Isabella and her husband, Florent of Hainaut. In 1299, Guy was engaged to Matilda, daughter of Isabella and Florent. Charles objected, as his permission had not been sought, but Pope Boniface VIII intervened on the young couple's behalf.|$|R
50|$|Nevertheless, York's claims {{continued}} to be pressed. In 1134, there was renewed papal pressure from Pope Innocent II <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>submission.</b> Perhaps it was {{for this reason that}} John gave his allegiance to the Antipope Anacletus II. The political situation had changed by 1135, and John's move had put him out of favour. In either 1136 or 1137 John abandoned his see to become a monk at Tiron. However, in 1138, the papal legate Alberic, bishop of Ostia recalled him to his see. John died in 1147, and was buried in Jedburgh Abbey. He was succeeded by another Tironensian, Herbert, Abbot of Selkirk/Kelso.|$|R
50|$|The {{term has}} thus been broadened in Australian jurisdictions to include any hearing during a trial where {{the jury is}} removed. The High Court of Australia has noted that the voir dire is an {{appropriate}} forum for the trial judge to reprimand counsel or for counsel <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>submissions</b> as to {{the running of the}} court to the trial judge.|$|E
50|$|The Irish Government {{established}} this Inquiry on 28 March 2006 to {{deal with}} episodes {{of child sexual abuse}} between 1975 and 2004. The public was invited <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>submissions</b> to the Inquiry on 25 May 2006 and it is speculated that the extent of abuse in Dublin is likely to be significantly greater or even less than that exposed in The Ferns Report.|$|E
