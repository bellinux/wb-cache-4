The sheriff and his command staff operate out of the Sheriff's Office complex located in Upper Marlboro. Most of the civilian support personnel also work out of this facility providing administrative duties such as NCIC monitoring, <b>teletype</b> (TTY), uniform and supply, criminal warrant research and organization, as well as other administrative duties as directed.|$|E
5|$|The Altair 8800 {{was modeled}} after early 1970s {{minicomputers}} {{such as the}} Data General Nova. These machines contained a CPU board, memory boards, and I/O boards; the data storage and display terminal were external devices. The <b>Teletype</b> Model 33 ASR was a popular terminal because it provided printed output and data storage on punched paper tape. More advanced systems would have 8-inch floppy disks and a video terminal that would display 24 lines of 80 characters such as the ADM-3A. (No graphics were available and lower-case letters were a $75 option.) Most of these computers had a front panel with toggle switches for entering data and lights for displaying it. These were normally used to boot the computer and to diagnose problems.|$|E

5|$|On 11 September 1940, George Stibitz {{transmitted}} {{problems for}} his Complex Number Calculator in New York using a <b>teletype,</b> {{and received the}} computed results back at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire. This configuration of a centralized computer (mainframe) with remote dumb terminals remained popular well into the 1970s. However, already in the 1960s, researchers started to investigate packet switching, a technology that sends a message in portions to its destination asynchronously without passing it through a centralized mainframe. A four-node network emerged on 5 December 1969, constituting {{the beginnings of the}} ARPANET, which by 1981 had grown to 213 nodes. ARPANET eventually merged with other networks to form the Internet. While Internet development was a focus of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) who published a series of Request for Comment documents, other networking advancement occurred in industrial laboratories, such as the local area network (LAN) developments of Ethernet (1983) and the token ring protocol (1984).|$|E
5|$|Snedden also {{embarked}} {{on a series of}} upgrades to the News-Miner's printing equipment. In 1953, rotary printing was introduced to Fairbanks after Snedden purchased a used rotary press from The Sacramento Union. To house the press, Snedden built a two-story building adjacent to the Lathrop Building. The Lathrop Building still contained most of the News-Miner's offices and typesetting equipment, but it was not large enough to contain the new press without extensive renovations, thus requiring a new building. Shortly after the new press was introduced, the News-Miner produced its first full-color newspaper. The new equipment also allowed for larger print jobs, and Snedden introduced an annual Progress Edition that was intended to be distributed outside Alaska in order to attract business and industry to the state. In 1954, the News-Miner obtained a dedicated <b>teletype</b> to the Associated Press, avoiding the need for contracts for telephone and telegraph service to a correspondent in Seattle who would relay AP material to the News-Miner.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, Stanford University student Bill Pitts, {{who had a}} hobby of {{exploring}} the steam tunnels and buildings of the campus, broke into a building he found {{out to be the}} location of the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Project, which held a DEC PDP-6 time-sharing computer system with 20 <b>Teletype</b> consoles connected to it. Fascinated by the computer and having taken several introductory computer classes, Pitts convinced the head of the project, Lester Earnest, to let him use the computer after hours. Soon, Pitts had ceased going to classes, instead spending his nights in the computer lab interacting with the graduate and postgraduate students and playing Spacewar on the PDP-6. Pitts often played against Hugh Tuck, a student at California Polytechnic State University who was a friend from high school. During one Spacewar session that took place, depending on the source, between 1966 and 1969, Tuck remarked that a coin-operated version of the game would be very successful. Such a device was still unfeasible due to the cost of computers, and the pair did not pursue the project. In 1971, however, Pitts, who by then had graduated and was working at Lockheed as a PDP-10 programmer, learned of the 1970 DEC PDP-11, which was sold for around US$14,000. While this was still too high for a commercially viable product, as most electronic games in arcades cost around US$1,000 at the time, Tuck and Pitts felt it was low enough to build a prototype to determine interest and optimal per-game pricing.|$|E

40|$|Calculation of quench {{corrections}} to {{liquid scintillation}} counting data is not intrinsically difficult, but is repetitive and time consuming. These characteristics make the calculations tedious to perform by hand but ideally suited to automatic processing. It is therefore not surprising that ma 1 _omputer programs to perform such calculations {{have been reported in}} the literature. Manufacturers of scintillation counters usually supply <b>teletypes</b> or card punches to produce punched paper tape or cards as the storage medium for the data. Consequently, most computer programs are orientated towards processing punched tape in a batch operation at a central computer, In general this approach is inflexible and slow, although feibility may be much increased by adopting a pseudo-on-line programming technique. Recently the cheapness of microprocessors has encouraged manufacturers to offer more computing ability and job control within the scintillation counter itself. However, these options tend to be expensive because of the cost of the associated dedicated peripheral devices such as floppy disks, videos or <b>teletypes...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of smaller {{and less expensive}} IBM 360s and 370s came equipped with these ruggedized Selectric keyboard devices. The Selectric was a major step up from the <b>teletypes</b> (TTY) associated with Unix and smaller systems, but still clunky. The video consoles provided with certain models were not considered particularly user friendly, and they ignored two thirds of IBM's mainframe market, DOS and its VSE descendants.|$|R
2500|$|Due {{to their}} speed (14.8 {{characters}} per second), immunity to clashing typebars, trouble-free paper path, high quality printed output, and reliability, Selectric-based mechanisms were also widely used as terminals for computers, replacing both <b>Teletypes</b> and older typebar-based output devices. [...] One popular example was the IBM 2741 terminal. Among other applications, the 2741 (with a special typing element) figured {{prominently in the}} early years of the APL programming language.|$|R
25|$|Mechanically, the Selectric {{borrowed}} some design {{elements from}} a toy typewriter produced earlier by Marx Toys. IBM bought {{the rights to}} the design. The typeball and carriage mechanism was similar to the design of the <b>Teletype</b> Model 26 and later, which used a rotating cylinder that moved along a fixed platen.|$|E
25|$|Radioteletype {{evolved from}} these earlier {{landline}} teleprinter operations. The US Department of the Navy successfully tested printing telegraphy between {{an airplane and}} ground radio station in August 1922. Later that year, the Radio Corporation of America successfully tested printing telegraphy via their Chatham, MA radio station to the R.M.S. Majestic. An early implementation of the Radioteletype was the Watsongraph, named after Detroit inventor Glenn Watson in March 1931. Commercial RTTY systems were in active service between San Francisco and Honolulu as early as April 1932 and between San Francisco and New York City by 1934. The US Military used radioteletype in the 1930s and expanded this usage during World War II. The Navy called radioteletype RATT (Radio Automatic <b>Teletype)</b> and the Army Signal Corps called radioteletype SCRT, an abbreviation of Single-Channel Radio <b>Teletype.</b> The military used frequency shift keying technology and this technology proved very reliable even over long distances.|$|E

His father was of German and Welsh ancestry, and his mother was of Norwegian and Irish ancestry.|$|E
50|$|For {{input and}} output, the PDP-8 {{had a single}} {{interrupt}} shared by all devices, an I/O bus accessed by I/O instructions and a direct memory access (DMA) channel. The programmed I/O bus typically ran low to medium-speed peripherals, such as printers, <b>teletypes,</b> paper tape punches and readers, while DMA was used for cathode ray tube screens with a light pen, analog-to-digital converters, digital-to-analog converters, tape drives and disk drives.|$|R

40|$|Videogame {{developers}} have utilized {{many types of}} display technology, from oscilloscopes to <b>Teletypes</b> to high-definition LCD displays. Two significant early display technologies, raster scan and random scan CRTs, played a significant part in the history and evolution of videogames.

25|$|When {{the machine}} first shipped, {{flipping}} {{switches on the}} front panel {{was the only way}} to get programs or data into the machine, and the only output from the programs was the patterns of lights on the panel.

25|$|Deaf {{individuals}} rely {{on technology}} for communication significantly. In the United States, video relay services {{and an array}} of freestanding and software-driven video phones are often used by deaf people to conduct telephonic communication with hearing and deaf businesses, family and friends. Devices such as the <b>teletype</b> (known as a TTY, an electronic device used for communication over a telephone line) are far less common, but are used by some deaf people who are without access to high-speed Internet or have a preference for these methods for their telephonic communication.|$|E
25|$|In January 1960, Hopwood {{participated in}} the first public {{demonstration}} of a new Navy communications system that used the moon as a radio relay to exchange <b>teletype</b> messages between Hopwood in Hawaii and Chief of Naval Operations Arleigh Burke in Washington, D.C. In June, he hosted President Dwight D. Eisenhower at Kaneohe Marine Corps Air Station when the President took a brief holiday in Hawaii following {{a trip to the}} Far East. He was relieved by Admiral John H. Sides on August 30, 1960 and retired from the Navy on September 1.|$|E
