5|$|American crows are common, widespread, and {{susceptible}} to the West Nile virus, making them useful as a bioindicator to <b>track</b> <b>the</b> virus's spread. Direct transmission of the virus from American crows to humans is unheard of and unlikely.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{uncertainties}} in its <b>track,</b> <b>the</b> government of Bermuda posted {{a tropical storm}} watch for the island on September 30; it was discontinued the following day.|$|E
5|$|Between {{qualifying}} and the race, a {{new world}} record was set for the largest parade of electric vehicles, when 577 cars and scooters took to the <b>track.</b> <b>The</b> parade surpassed the previous record set in September 2014 in Silicon Valley, United States.|$|E
30|$|Since the MMP-CBMeMBer {{algorithm}} cannot give <b>the</b> <b>tracks,</b> <b>the</b> <b>track</b> maintenance {{algorithm is}} proposed by introducing the particle labeling method, which can effectively achieve <b>the</b> <b>track</b> continuity for <b>the</b> multiple maneuvering target <b>tracking.</b> <b>The</b> detailed process of <b>the</b> <b>track</b> maintenance is described as follows.|$|R
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the two elevated railway <b>tracks,</b> <b>the</b> bridge also had four streetcar <b>tracks.</b> <b>The</b> following Queens lines operated over the bridge: ...|$|R
50|$|Some of the Smurfin! CDs {{contained}} 16 tracks {{while others}} contained all 20 <b>tracks.</b> <b>The</b> Canadian/Australian cassette releases contained 16 <b>tracks</b> while <b>the</b> American release contained only 10 of <b>the</b> 20 <b>tracks.</b> <b>The</b> LP consisted of all 20 tracks.|$|R
5|$|Dorotea Benedetti – The {{representative}} of the graphic design company. She has a background in industrial espionage and is secretly hired to encourage Cayce to leave London without accepting Bigend's offer to <b>track</b> <b>the</b> film clips.|$|E
5|$|Mobile {{devices are}} also useful for {{providing}} location information; either from inbuilt gps/location tracking or via cell site logs, which <b>track</b> <b>the</b> devices within their range. Such information {{was used to}} track down the kidnappers of Thomas Onofri in 2006.|$|E
5|$|On October 15, 2010, a 24-year-old woman {{died while}} {{participating}} in a driving school at the <b>track.</b> <b>The</b> woman was driving a replica Indycar {{as part of the}} Mario Andretti Racing Experience when she lost control and hit the inside wall of the track.|$|E
25|$|This line {{then turns}} south {{to go under}} Sixth Avenue, merging with the branch from 57th Street and a {{connection}} to the IND Queens Boulevard Line (used by the M train) to become a four-track line. <b>The</b> southbound <b>track</b> becomes <b>the</b> westernmost <b>track,</b> and <b>the</b> northbound <b>track</b> becomes <b>the</b> second <b>track</b> from <b>the</b> east; the other lines merge to become <b>the</b> second <b>track</b> from <b>the</b> west and <b>the</b> easternmost <b>track,</b> with connections only between the 63rd Street Line and <b>the</b> two main <b>tracks.</b> After passing through 47th–50th Streets–Rockefeller Center, <b>the</b> two southbound <b>tracks</b> cross; <b>the</b> main <b>tracks</b> become <b>the</b> two center express <b>tracks</b> and <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> from <b>the</b> other lines are the two outside local tracks.|$|R
50|$|There is one island {{platform}} serving two <b>tracks.</b> <b>The</b> <b>tracks</b> extend past <b>the</b> station to store terminating trains.|$|R
5000|$|Some of <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> on <b>the</b> vinyl release are {{significantly}} shorter than <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> on <b>the</b> CD versions.|$|R
5|$|The IMD – the {{official}} warning agency for the basin – did not <b>track</b> <b>the</b> cyclone. In general, tropical cyclone forecast models failed {{to predict that}} the storm would form.|$|E
5|$|The bird {{is part of}} {{an annual}} census, the Great Cocky count, that has been held every year since 2009 to <b>track</b> <b>the</b> {{population}} change of Red-tailed and other black cockatoos.|$|E
5|$|The last {{storm to}} form in August {{developed}} on August30 to the northwest of Guam. It briefly moved to the north-northeast before maintaining a steady northwest <b>track.</b> <b>The</b> system attained typhoon status, later dissipating on September4 near Okinawa.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>track</b> listing on some album {{releases}} denotes <b>the</b> first <b>track,</b> [...] "Intro/There's Something Goin' On," [...] as <b>track</b> #18 <b>the</b> <b>track</b> count from Organix (17 <b>tracks).</b> <b>The</b> rest of <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> continue upward from 18 to [...] "The Unlocking" [...] (being track #33) ...|$|R

5000|$|In 1998, {{the album}} was reissued on CD as [...] "Guaranteed Dubliner". Below is <b>the</b> <b>track</b> listing for <b>the</b> CD, which {{consists}} of seventeen <b>tracks.</b> Although <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> are written as their original eight <b>track</b> format and <b>the</b> others are just untititled <b>tracks,</b> <b>the</b> original LP is split into seventeen tracks to fit on to the CD.|$|R
5|$|Those {{with more}} serious {{injuries}} {{had to be}} carried down the <b>track.</b> <b>The</b> usual {{decision as to whether}} it was safe to move someone was simplified by the Japanese, who killed all the wounded they encountered. Only those near death were abandoned. Casualties were held at the aid posts and dressing stations until they could walk, or the Japanese threatened. It took eight or ten Papuan carriers to move each man. Army stretchers rotted and fell apart; the Papuans improvised stretchers from blankets, copra bags and timber cut along the <b>Track.</b> <b>The</b> pace of the withdrawal was dictated by the rate at which casualties could be evacuated.|$|E
5|$|A Sm3 derailed near Karjaa on 25 July 2003 due to {{a defect}} in a turnout. The train derailed at a low speed after {{mechanics}} turned the turnout blades manually into the correct position, but forgot to check the turnout frog, which was set to a diverging <b>track.</b> <b>The</b> first three carriages of the train derailed completely, {{in addition to the}} first bogie of the fourth car.|$|E
5|$|A notable {{feature of}} Bolliger & Mabillard roller {{coasters}} is the box-section <b>track.</b> <b>The</b> running rails {{are connected to}} a box-section spine, instead of the circular spine used by other manufacturers. When a train travels around a box-section track, it creates a distinctive roaring sound, which is unique to this style of track. However, on some Bolliger & Mabillard roller coasters, such as Talon at Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom, and Gatekeeper at Cedar Point the track is filled with sand to reduce this noise.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>track</b> listing on some album {{releases}} denotes <b>the</b> first <b>track</b> as <b>track</b> #34 <b>the</b> <b>track</b> totals from Organix (17 tracks) and Do You Want More?!!!??!

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>track</b> listing on <b>the</b> back of {{the album}} skips the number 9, making the album appear to have only 15 <b>tracks.</b> <b>The</b> <b>track</b> listing on <b>the</b> disc itself corrects this matter.|$|R
5|$|A {{wide range}} of concentrating {{technologies}} exists: among the best known are the parabolic trough, the compact linear Fresnel reflector, the Stirling dish and the solar power tower. Various techniques are used to <b>track</b> <b>the</b> sun and focus light. In all of these systems a working fluid is heated by the concentrated sunlight, and is then used for power generation or energy storage. Thermal storage efficiently allows up to 24-hour electricity generation.|$|E
5|$|Again, {{paragraph}} (a) is {{the automatic}} track, and paragraph (b) the deliberative <b>track.</b> <b>The</b> person must {{have served in}} the above capacity for a single period of three or more years or for two periods adding up to three or more years, and the period(s) of service must fall partly or wholly within the 20-year period before the date when a writ of election is issued to initiate the presidential election process.|$|E
5|$|Another dispute exists {{concerning}} the <b>track</b> <b>the</b> hurricane took, specifically between the downgrade to tropical depression and dissipation. The best track and ESSA report both showed that Liza went southwestward through the time period. However, the JTWC final report on Liza reported that Liza made a tiny loop that was entirely within 24°N to 25°N latitude and 125°W to 126°W longitude from September 4 to September 6.|$|E
50|$|For {{its entire}} length, until <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> were removed, Santa Monica Boulevard {{followed}} <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> of <b>the</b> Pacific Electric Railway. In the portion from Holloway Drive in West Hollywood to Sepulveda Boulevard in West Los Angeles, <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> {{were in a}} separate right-of-way, with two roadways, {{one on each side}} of <b>the</b> <b>tracks.</b> For <b>the</b> rest of <b>the</b> route, <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> ran in <b>the</b> traffic lanes.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} <b>tracks</b> from <b>the</b> {{previous}} films were re-used, some replacing unreleased original <b>tracks.</b> <b>The</b> majority of <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> were from Saw III and Saw IV.|$|R
50|$|Successful {{analysis}} of project estimate variance {{is dependent on}} accurate time <b>tracking.</b> <b>The</b> greater the granularity with which time is <b>tracked,</b> <b>the</b> more detailed an analysis can be performed during the project post-mortem.|$|R
5|$|Another {{feature of}} the ball is its rubber layer; it was {{designed}} to allow a better response while retaining the impact energy and releases it in the coup. Its support material of cross-linked nitrogen-expanded foam improves its retention and durability of its shape. Polyester support fabric enhances structure and stability. The asymmetrical high-contrast graphic around the ball creates an optimal flicker as the ball rotates for a more powerful visual signal, allowing the player to more easily identify and <b>track</b> <b>the</b> ball.|$|E
5|$|As dusk {{began to}} fall on the drying <b>track,</b> <b>the</b> No. 8 Peugeot {{suffered}} from rear wheel hub failures which required two lengthy visits to the garage. This allowed the No. 1 Audi to take over second place. Jacques Villeneuve's No. 7 Peugeot also lost time, which dropped it to two laps behind the No. 2 Audi. The No. 1 Audi had its own brief moment when the No. 63 Corvette clipped the Audi's rear end. The Corvette was forced to take evasive action through the Dunlop Chicane's gravel trap, and the Audi required replacement rear bodywork on its next pit stop.|$|E
5|$|Before leaving Atlantic, the Rolling Stones {{released}} Undercover (UK 3; US 4) in late 1983. Despite {{good reviews}} and the Top Ten peak {{position of the}} title <b>track,</b> <b>the</b> record sold below expectations {{and there was no}} tour to support it. Subsequently, the Stones' new marketer/distributor CBS Records took over distributing the Stones' Atlantic catalogue.|$|E
