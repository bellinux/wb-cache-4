40|$|This {{presentation}} {{is part of}} the Feminism and Empiricism (Quinean Themes) track. In my view, feminist epistemologists and philosophers of science have offered some of the deepest challenges to traditional philosophy of science. Some of the most interesting work, in my view, has developed in the context of defending the very possibility of ‘feminist science. ’ From a traditionalist point of view, after all, feminist science makes as much sense as Marxist science or Christian science. It is taken for granted that political and/or moral values are external to scientific activity. At best, such values are irrelevant to scientific success; at worst, they are impediments to it. Making room for a feminist science involves challenging the traditional view at its roots. Some feminists find a rich resource for this project in the work of W. V. O. Quine (Nelson 1990; Antony 1993; Campbell 1998; Solomon 2001). These philosophers argue that Quine’s naturalist empiricism, taken to its logical (if not Quine’s) conclusion, provides the conceptual space for a genuinely feminist empiricism. Focusing on actual cases of scientific success and failure, they are able to show that political and moral values (e. g., a commitment to gender equality) can be truth-conducive in certain circumstances (e. g., when male chauvinism is endemic). Given Quine’s holism and his naturalism, they conclude that a feminist empiricism is consistent with and, indeed, demanded by Quine’s views. I find this work compelling for substantive and strategic reasons. From a substantive point of view, I find Quine’s work, and feminist efforts to extend it, both convincing and quite general in its import. From a strategic point of view, I find this approach compelling because Quine’s work, and feminist work built upon it, addresses the traditionalists on their own ground. Traditionalists {{are not likely to be}} convinced by critique ‘from the outside. ’ That said, though I am convinced for the most part by defenders of a Quinean feminist empiricism, I have reservations about Quine’s views that extend to their feminist interpretation. In particular, I believe Quine’s wholesale rejection of the analytic-synthetic distinction, and the associated rejection of a priori knowledge, is overstated (Quine 1969). Though Quine is right to assert that all sentences are potentially falsifiable – no sentence is immune to revision – all sentences are not potentially falsifiable in the same context. This point is demonstrated forcefully by Michael Friedman (2001). Friedman develops a historical sketch of the transition from Newtonian to Einsteinian physics in order to show how the development of non-Euclidean (Riemannian) geometry was a necessary precondition for the development of Einstein’s general theory of relativity; according to Friedman the general theory of relativity could not be conceived (stated) absent Riemannian geometry. From the perspective of Einsteinian physics, then, Riemannian geometry is properly viewed as (contingently) a priori: the axioms of Riemannian geometry are not open to empirical refutation in this context. In order to understand and work with the general theory of relativity, one must presuppose Riemannian geometry because Riemannian geometry is partly constitutive of an Einsteinian world-view. Thus, contrary to Quine, all sentences are not equally open to empirical refutation (in the same context). If Friedman is right, and I believe he is, Quine’s naturalist empiricism is misleading and impoverished. It is misleading because it treats of all sentences equally: all sentences are falsifiable to the same degree. Only pragmatic considerations (e. g., the principle of minimum mutilation) differentiate sentences in this respect. It is impoverished because it fails to take context seriously. For Quine, pragmatic criteria like the principle of minimum mutilation are global criteria, applying to science as a whole. These failings are shared by many followers of Quine, including feminist empiricists. The consequences here are twofold. First of all, all values are treated equally: it is entirely an empirical matter whether or not a particular political or moral commitment will turn out to be truth-conducive. Second, because local contexts are ignored, the truth-conducive character of all values is equally contingent or contingent in the same way. A commitment to gender equality, e. g., may be truth-conducive given endemic male chauvinism, but the former is entirely contingent on the latter. Of course, Friedman’s work suffers from similar problems. For one, according to Friedman the (contingently) a priori status of a sentence, or set of sentences, <b>turns</b> <b>partly</b> <b>on</b> its foundational character in a given historical epoch (Friedman 2001). This is, no doubt, one of the reasons Friedman emphasizes conceptual or semantic presuppositions. Following Michael Williams (2001), I resist Freidman’s (Kantian) emphasis on purely conceptual or semantic presuppositions, as well as his foundationalism. On my view, a priori presuppositions or principles are not necessarily conceptual (or semantic) in nature. Among other possibilities, a priori principles may be what Williams calls ‘methodological constraints,’ or necessary conditions of the possibility of engaging in a specific activity (Williams 2001). Furthermore, as the latter implies, the a priori or constitutive status of a principle does not necessarily turn on its foundational character, as Friedman avers. On my view, a principle may be constitutive in one context but not in another. Thus it needn’t play the same role across all or most contexts to count as constitutive. I believe that Friedman and Williams bring valuable resources to anyone interested in the role of values in science, including feminist empiricists. First of all, both authors emphasize the different roles played by sentences in different contexts: all sentences are not treated equally. Though we must, post-Quine, abandon the idea of an absolute distinction between internal and external values, Friedman and Williams both draw our attention to the import of a relativized version of this distinction. This more complex picture, in turn, illuminates the different roles that values may play in a given scientific activity. Furthermore, though the appropriateness of a value commitment in a particular context will always be contingent from an external perspective, it may well be necessary from an internal perspective. Thus, the truth-conducive character of all value commitments will not be equally contingent, or contingent in the same way. Finally, precisely because a contextual approach focuses attention on value commitments that are internally necessary (but externally contingent), this approach has strategic advantages: practitioners cannot disavow these value commitments without misrepresenting their own disciplines...|$|E

30|$|Once a new {{export item}} is introduced, {{subsequent}} employment growth will {{be driven by}} the intensive margin, which in <b>turn</b> depends <b>partly</b> <b>on</b> the competitiveness of the global market in that particular industry. Products with relatively low discovery costs {{are likely to be}} exported by firms from multiple countries. With fewer buyers and many suppliers, importers may exercise market power and use the threat of switching supplier countries/firms to dictate the terms of exchange in their advantage. The resulting uncertainty of demand and contract terms may reduce exporters’ incentive and ability to create and retain jobs. To capture this effect, the extended labor demand model includes a measure of the number of active exporter countries (CX) for each four-digit industry.|$|R

By {{the end of the}} year, {{in the midst of the}} First Nations' Idle No More movement, {{national}} focus was <b>turned</b> <b>partly</b> <b>on</b> Johnston after Chief of the Attawapiskat First Nation Theresa Spence began a protest, deemed a [...] "hunger strike", against certain First Nations-related actions by the federal government and parliament and vowed publicly to continue until both Prime Minister Harper and the Governor General together met with her. The Assembly of First Nations also on December 16 issued an open letter the Governor General calling for a meeting to discuss Spence's demands. A meeting between the Prime Minister, other Cabinet ministers, First Nations chiefs, and representatives of the Assembly of First Nations took place on January 11, 2013, but Johnston declined to attend, as [...] "it was not appropriate" [...] for the representative of a constitutional monarch to publicly participate in discussions on government policy. This, along with other factors, led Spence and other chiefs to boycott the Prime Minister's conference, though she did attend the meeting and ceremony for First Nations chiefs that Johnston hosted at Rideau Hall the same evening. Spence declared after that she was not satisfied with the content of that gathering, vowed to continue her protest, and she and the Governor General communicated directly via letter. Spence ended her protest on January 24, 2013, though the demand for a meeting of First Nations chiefs, Cabinet ministers, and the Governor General together remained in a declaration signed by Spence and two leaders in Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition.|$|R

40|$|Should {{a nation}} extend legal rights {{to those who}} enter the country illegally? The Supreme Court {{recently}} addressed this question when it held that unauthorized immigrants who are fired illegally for unionizing cannot recover monetary remedies. This {{has led to a}} significant decline in employment protections for unauthorized immigrants beyond the unionized sector. For example, some courts now question whether unauthorized immigrants can receive full remedies for sexual harassment, workplace discrimination, or on-the-job injuries. Scholars have criticized these losses but have yet to formulate a coherent framework for evaluating the employment rights of unauthorized immigrants. This article does so by distilling and applying several core principles at issue when employment laws conflict with immigration laws. I begin by explaining how the text and purpose of selected immigration and employment statutes show that Congress never intended to restrict unauthorized immigrants’ employment rights. Remedial restrictions not only harm the workplace protections at issue, they fail to discourage illegal immigration. Thus, neither legislative intent nor national immigration goals justify limiting the workplace remedies available to unauthorized immigrants. Although the future rights of unauthorized workers will <b>turn</b> <b>partly</b> <b>on</b> the issues of statutory purpose and immigration policy discussed in the early sections of the article, equally important are the consequences of diminished rights. Accordingly, the article concludes by explaining why restricting workplace protections based on status harms citizens as well as immigrants. Cunningham-Parmeter contends that employment protections are “rights of partial inclusion” that reflect a distinctive sphere - the workplace - where unauthorized immigrants should be placed on par with citizens in pursuing collective interests. In contrast to arguments that favor limiting resources to lawful residents, partial inclusion explains how employment protections can effectively preserve national identity while simultaneously enhancing unauthorized immigrants’ incentives for social investment. In doing so, partial inclusion furthers the community’s self-definition, while providing unauthorized immigrants with a sense of belonging in a world increasingly focused on their exclusion...|$|R
40|$|I {{would to}} thank the organisers for the kind {{invitation}} to discuss a paper {{on an issue that}} has figured prominently in BIS thinking: global liquidity. Jean Pierre has written a very rich and wide-ranging contribution, keying off a CGFS (2011) report, which he admirably chaired, and which in <b>turn</b> <b>partly</b> drew <b>on</b> BIS research. Not surprisingly, there is a lot with which I agree in what he says. As discussant, I will highlight some of these areas, and, as is my duty, offer a complementary personal perspective and note a few points of possible disagreement. There are three takeaways from my presentation. First, liquidity is unobservable: we can only measure it indirectly; we can only see its footprints. Which footprints matter most depends on the question. If we care about financial instability and its major macroeconomic dislocations, then it is the behaviour of credit, jointly with that of property prices, that is the critical footprint. Second, to my mind, the Achilles heel of the international monetary and financial system (IMFS), is not so much, paraphrasing Jean Pierre, the risk of a ―structural excess demand for safe assets‖, as he seems to suggest, but its ―excess elasticity ‖ (Borio and Disyatat (2011)). By ―excess elasticity ‖ I mean its Inability to prevent liquidity-fuelled build-ups of financia...|$|R
50|$|The staged {{reconstruction}} {{project for}} I-275 between the Howard Frankland Bridge and downtown Tampa {{was supposed to}} begin {{in the summer of}} 2006. However, bids received by the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) for the project came in at $100 million (40%) over the projected estimates, which was blamed on the rising cost of asphalt and other materials, which was, in <b>turn,</b> <b>partly</b> blamed <b>on</b> the rising oil prices worldwide. As a result, FDOT commenced with the project in four smaller phases, rather than the original, large-scale, two-phase project. Construction began on phase one, the northbound lanes (south of the existing interstate) between Himes Ave and downtown Tampa, on August 13, 2007, and was completed in April 2010. Phase two, which includes construction of the northbound lanes from the West Shore area to Himes, was originally scheduled to begin in 2008, but was delayed further. The third phase will consist of transferring northbound traffic onto the new northbound lanes, southbound traffic onto the existing northbound lanes, and the construction of the new southbound lanes from Himes to downtown. Finally, the fourth and final phase will construct the new southbound lanes from the West Shore area to Himes. The entire project was originally scheduled to be completed by around 2013 or 2014, but it was extended until spring 2015 and costed an estimated $540 million, an increase from the original $350 million budget. Finally, on March 30, 2015 the fourth and final phase was finished with the new lanes finally opening, ending the long term project in downtown Tampa.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: If {{the amount}} of {{resources}} allocated to reproduction (K) is fixed, then an increase in seed mass (S) can only be achieved by a decrease in seed number (n = K/S). Thus, log(n) = log(K) -log(S) producing a slope of - 1 when seed mass and number are plotted on log-log axes. However, in comparative studies, empirical support for a slope of - 1 is limited and contentious, leading some to question the utility of this concept. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: First, we show that the expected slope depends on whether genotypes and species producing seeds of different mass are expected to reach the same adult size and that this in <b>turn</b> depends <b>partly</b> <b>on</b> the nature of growth. Second, we present experimental results using a population of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) of Arabidopsis thaliana. When these RILs are grown in large pots with plentiful nutrients, they exhibit a trade-off between seed size and number with a slope of - 1. 68 (+/- 0. 18) on log-log axes. This occurs because of genetic correlations between seed mass and adult size so that, under the right growth conditions, lines producing lighter seeds have the genetic potential to produce larger rosettes and hence a greater total mass of seeds. We re-grew lines in small pots (10 and 40 mm diameter) in a nutrient-poor substrate so that final adult size was heavily restricted by pot size. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Under our growth conditions, small-seeded lines were unable to produce a greater total mass of seeds. Hence a trade-off emerged between seed mass and seed number with a slope of - 1. 166 +/- 0. 319 on log-log axes in 40 -mm diameter pots (close to the expected value of - 1), although the slope was 0. 132 +/- 0. 263 in 10 -mm diameter pots, demonstrating {{that the nature of}} the trade-off is sensitive to the growth conditions...|$|R

40|$|Although {{there are}} as many trading {{strategies}} as there are people in this world, the traditional opinion is that investments should be based on sound fundamental analysis which in <b>turn</b> is <b>partly</b> based <b>on</b> information that by law should be given to the financial market without delay. The Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) states that prices quickly adjust to new information and that current prices are accurately reflected by all the information about the asset in question (Fama, 1970). Thus, no investor should have an advantage in forecasting future stock prices since no one is supposed to have access to information that has not already been made public.
