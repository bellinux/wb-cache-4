5|$|The area {{above the}} eyes, {{including}} the forehead, crown and nape, {{is a deep}} blue-black, through <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>edge</b> of the mantle. The mantle proper is a medium to dark gray-blue as are the tertials and upperwing-coverts, turning to a dark gray at the median, greater and primary coverts and the alula. The secondaries and inner primaries are fringed in gray-blue. The central rectrices are gray-blue, and the outer rectrices are a blackish-gray, paling towards the tips.|$|E
5|$|The writing {{field is}} {{surrounded}} by a narrow gold trim decorated with blue and white acanthus leaves. <b>The</b> <b>top</b> <b>edge</b> is decorated with animals and vegetation, along with medallions containing half-figures, such as Jesus flanked by Mary and John the Baptist with four Evangelists. Between the medallions at the top are six pairs of animals. It was the first marriage document to be illuminated.|$|E
5|$|The volcano {{was active}} again in 1868, 1877, 1884, 1885, 1894, and 1918, before its next major {{eruption}} in 1918–1919. Halemaumau, then a small upwelling in the caldera floor, was {{topped by a}} lava lake that then drained, before refilling again, forming an enormous lava lake and nearly reaching <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>edge</b> of the caldera before draining once more. This activity eventually {{gave way to the}} construction of Mauna Iki, building up the large lava shield within the caldera over a period of eight months. The eruption also featured concurrent rift activity and a large amount of lava fountaining.|$|E

25|$|When the geyser {{was given}} this name in 1870, <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>edges</b> of <b>the</b> {{structure}} resembled the typical profile {{associated with the}} modern concept of a castle, having {{the appearance of a}} large keep, multiple turrets, and especially because of the crenellation along <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>edges</b> of what resembled its towers. As the drawing below shows the cone had distinctive appearance at the time. Over time the cone's shape changes because of the layers of mineral deposited in successive eruptions.|$|R
5000|$|Siding {{refers to}} the design of the hair on the back and sides between <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> and <b>the</b> <b>top.</b> <b>Edging</b> and siding, {{together}} or separately, commonly referred to as tapering, create a [...] (see crew cut).|$|R
5|$|Aluminium {{cylinders}} {{are usually}} manufactured by cold extrusion of aluminium billets {{in a process}} which first presses the walls and base, then trims <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>edge</b> of the cylinder walls, followed by press forming the shoulder and neck. The final structural process is machining the neck outer surface, boring and cutting the neck threads and O-ring groove. The cylinder is then heat-treated, tested and stamped with the required permanent markings. Aluminium diving cylinders commonly have flat bases, which allows them to stand upright on horizontal surfaces, and which are relatively thick to allow for rough treatment and considerable wear. This makes them heavier than {{they need to be}} for strength, but the extra weight at the base also helps keep the centre of gravity low which gives better balance in the water and reduces excess buoyancy.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of England's second innings, Washbrook took a single from Lindwall, who {{promptly}} removed Emmett for a duck. Lindwall pitched an outswinger on the line of off stump and Emmett edged it to wicket-keeper Tallon, who dived and took it in his right hand. This brought Lindwall’s tormentor Edrich to the crease. Bradman advised Lindwall not to bounce Edrich, fearing this would be interpreted as retaliation and generate negative media attention. However, Miller retaliated with four consecutive bouncers, angering the crowd. He struck Edrich on the body before Bradman and ordered him to stop; the Australian captain apologised to Edrich for the hostile bowling. Lindwall bounced Washbrook and was no balled by umpire Dai Davies for dragging his foot beyond the line. After a disagreement, Davies threw Lindwall his jumper, but the tension faded away and the paceman was not no balled again after discussing the matter with Bradman. Lindwall bounced Washbrook again {{and this time the}} England opener went for the hook shot. The ball flew off <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>edge</b> in the air, straight towards Hassett at fine leg, who dropped the catch after juggling three times. Having received a reprieve on 21, Washbrook settled down and reached 50 in only 70 minutes with England at 1/80.|$|E
25|$|The {{cassette}} {{was adapted}} {{into what is}} called a streamer cassette, a version dedicated solely for data storage, and used chiefly for hard disk backups and other types of data. Streamer cassettes look almost exactly the same as a standard cassette, with the exception of having a notch about one quarter-inch wide and deep situated slightly off-center at <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>edge</b> of the cassette. Streamer cassettes also have a re-usable write-protect tab on only one side of <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>edge</b> of the cassette, with the other side of <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>edge</b> having either only an open rectangular hole, or no hole at all. This is due to the entire one-eighth inch width of the tape loaded inside being used by a streamer cassette drive for the writing and reading of data, hence only one side of the cassette being used. Streamer cassettes can hold anywhere from 50 to 160 megabytes of data.|$|E

25|$|There are eleven {{pairs of}} equally spaced holes (60mm in diameter) near <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>edge</b> {{of the sheer}} line. Close {{analysis}} of those holes {{showed no signs of}} any intensive wear or fitting marks inside them so their purpose is still a mystery.|$|E
25|$|Turkish costumes {{are usually}} in the bedlah style. Distinctive {{features}} of many Turkish costumes include a V-shaped or triangular belt which may be shaped or contoured around <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>edge,</b> {{and a great deal}} of embellishment and beaded fringing on both the bra and the belt. Skirts are often fuller than their Egyptian counterparts, and are likely to be made of chiffon or velvet rather than lycra.|$|E

25|$|Externally, {{the most}} obvious changes over the SII were the thicker and more {{incorporated}} rubber bumpers with decorative chrome only on <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>edge,</b> flush door handles for increased safety, a one-piece front door glass without a separate 1/4 light, a grille with only vertical vanes, reverse lights moved from the boot plinth to the larger rear light clusters and a revised roofline with narrower door frames and increased glass area.|$|E
25|$|At <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>edge</b> of {{riverside}} meadow are to {{be found}} a couple of sizeable glacial erratics, which were dug out during the construction of the sewerage treatment plant. The remains of the abutments of a footbridge across the river are visible where the garden boundary hedge meets the Annick and Florence Miller remembers the bridge as still standing in the late 1920s. This presumably Victorian or Edwardian feature would take people across to the area delineated by a small ha-ha, now thick with rhododendrons (R.ponticum), typically planted by estate owners.|$|E
25|$|Osome {{appears in}} a moment of tension. It is night and she is leaving the grounds of her home. In {{contrast}} with the complete darkness of the house behind her, she carries a lit lantern and wears a dark but colourful patterned kimono. Beyond the figure of Osome herself, there is very little detail. The ground is made up of yellow horizontal lines on a brown background, and the sky is coloured with the bokashi technique of colour gradation, darkening from light grey to black as it reaches <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>edge</b> of the print. Osome looks up to her left with an uneasy facial expression, her gaze resting somewhere beyond the right border of the print.|$|E

50|$|The {{architecture}} of the building combines old and modernist elements, and is distinct from that of surrounding structures. The whole exterior is made of bay windows, and square patterns are found on both the exterior and interior. The base columns are slender and rectangular. <b>The</b> <b>top</b> <b>edges</b> of <b>the</b> building consist of perforated cantilevers.|$|R
25|$|Various {{ornaments}} of {{the nasal}} boss have also been used to distinguish between different species of Pachyrhinosaurus. Both P. lakustai and P. perotorum bore a jagged, comb-like extension {{at the tip of}} the boss which was missing in P. canadensis. P. perotorum was unique in having a narrow dome in the middle of the back portion {{of the nasal}} boss, and P. lakustai had a pommel-like structure projecting from the front of the boss (the boss of P. canadensis was mainly flat on top and rounded). P. perotorum bore two unique, flattened horns which projected forward and down from <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>edge</b> of the frill, and P. lakustai bore another comb-like horn arising from the middle of the frill behind the eyes.|$|E
25|$|Five {{types are}} shown in the {{illustration}} with a white background. In the top row, series A-E, {{the whole of the}} edges are rounded, except the bottom ones. In the next line (F-J) all are of a chisel type. The tops and sides of these are sometimes flat or angular, and sometimes rounded; and the lower, or cutting edges, are sharp. The examples in the next series (K-O) bear some resemblance to a bill-hook; the top edges are flat; and they are all pierced with holes drilled from the two sides. The specimens in the next row have similar holes—otherwise they approximate to the chisel type; while the type represented in the bottom series U-Y differs from all the others in having projecting shoulders, and (occasionally) in having a groove along the length of <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>edge,</b> apparently to facilitate handling.|$|E
25|$|The {{methods of}} {{clearing}} differ between the half mask, which covers {{the eyes and}} nose, and the full-face mask, which also covers the mouth. If the mask has a purge valve and the strap tension is correct, the diver holds the head so that the valve is at the lowest point and exhales through the nose. If the mask is a good fit on the diver's face and the strap is correctly placed, exhaling through the nose will usually drive water out along the bottom edge of the skirt. It {{may be necessary to}} press {{the upper part of the}} mask against the face to improve the seal if the diver is rolled to one side. If the fit is not perfect, or the strap is too low, contact pressure of <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>edge</b> against the forehead may be insufficient to maintain a seal when the head is upright.|$|E

However, edge (9, 14) ranks only 16 th according to Edge Gravity, while edge (2, 9) ranks 12 th. Note also that <b>the</b> <b>top</b> three <b>edges</b> for Edge Gravity rank only fourth, seventh, and 14 th for edge betweenness.|$|R
25|$|The NGA {{hired the}} {{structural}} engineering firm Robert Silman Associates {{to determine the}} cause of the problem. Although the Gallery began raising private funds to fix the issue, eventually federal funding was used to repair the building. In 2012, the NGA chose a joint venture, Balfour Beatty/Smoot, to complete the repairs. Anodized aluminum anchors replaced the stainless steel ones, and the top corner anchors were moved to the center of <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>edge</b> of each stone. The neoprene joints were removed and new colored silicone gaskets installed, and leveling screws rather than mortar used to keep the panels square. Work began in November 2011, and originally was scheduled to end in 2014. By February 2012, however, the contractor said work on the façade would end in late 2013, and site restoration would take place in 2014. The East Building remained open throughout the project.|$|E
25|$|In {{this system}} a {{filament}} {{is located at}} one focus of an ellipsoidal reflector and has a condenser lens {{at the front of}} the lamp. A shade is located at the image plane, between the reflector and lens, and the projection of <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>edge</b> of this shade provides the low-beam cutoff. The shape of the shade edge and its exact position in the optical system determine the shape and sharpness of the cutoff. The shade may be lowered by a solenoid actuated pivot to provide low beam, and removed from the light path for high beam. Such optics are known as BiXenon or BiHalogen projectors. If the cutoff shade is fixed in the light path, separate high-beam lamps are required. The condenser lens may have slight fresnel rings or other surface treatments to reduce cutoff sharpness. Modern condenser lenses incorporate optical features specifically designed to direct some light upward towards the locations of retroreflective overhead road signs.|$|E
25|$|Conversely, the bouncer {{can be a}} very {{productive}} ball for the batsman, if he plays it in an attacking manner. The shot that is used to attack the bouncer is the hook shot. To play the hook shot the batsman moves his back foot backwards and towards the off side as the ball is being delivered. As the ball approaches, the batsman swivels from facing the off side to facing the leg side, while holding the bat horizontally. The batsman's aim is to hit the ball at high speed towards, into or over the leg side boundary. However, despite their run-scoring potential, hook shots frequently lead to wickets falling, particularly through balls hitting <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>edge</b> of the bat and being caught by leg side fielders. However, if the bouncer is misdirected by the bowler, and reaches the batsman on the off side of his wicket, the cut, uppercut or late cut can be played, either with the intention of guiding the ball along the ground, through a gap in the field setting, or over the infield for four or six.|$|E
50|$|In the mid-1950s, the {{remaining}} IS-2 tanks (mostly model 1944 variants) were upgraded to the IS-2M standard, which introduced fittings such as external fuel tanks {{on the rear}} hull (the basic IS-2 had these only on the hull sides), stowage bins {{on both sides of}} the hull and protective skirting along <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>edges</b> of <b>the</b> tracks.|$|R
