5|$|As {{early as}} 1786, Marshall had been implicating several {{prominent}} Kentucky politicians in {{a scheme to}} take Kentucky out of the Union and into alliance with Spain. After the expiration of his Senate term, he resumed these charges <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>pages</b> of the Western World newspaper. His allegations resulted in a legislative investigation of Kentucky Court of Appeals judge Benjamin Sebastian, who {{was found to be}} receiving a pension from Spain and resigned from the bench. Federal judge Harry Innes was also a target of Marshall's allegations, and the two became embroiled in a legal battle that lasted almost a decade. Innes hired William Littell to write and publish a book giving Innes' version of his dealings with Spain. Marshall countered by publishing his History of Kentucky in 1812. Although blatantly partisan, it became the most widely read history of the state at the time. Marshall and Innes ended their legal battle with an agreement, signed in 1815, that neither would publish anything negative about the other again. Innes upheld his part of the agreement, but in 1824, years after Innes' death, Marshall published an updated edition of his History of Kentucky which was just as vitriolic as the previous version had been. Marshall faded from public life during his later years. He died at the home of his son in Lexington, Kentucky on July 3, 1841.|$|E

25|$|The {{stories are}} {{formatted}} so that, {{after a couple}} of pages of reading, the protagonist faces two or three options, each of which leads to more options, and then to one of many endings. The number of endings is not set, and varies from as many as 44 in the early titles, to as few as 8 in later adventures. Likewise, there is no clear pattern among the various titles regarding the number of pages per ending, the ratio of good to bad endings, or the reader's progression backwards and forwards <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>pages</b> of the book. This allows for a realistic sense of unpredictability, and leads to the possibility of repeat readings, {{which is one of the}} distinguishing features of the books.|$|E

Many years after Vivekananda's death Rabindranath Tagore told French Nobel laureate Romain Rolland, [...] "If {{you want to know}} India, study Vivekananda.

That we are better off today is owing {{in large part to the}} work of Robbins Landon." [...] However, he faults Landon for haphazard scholarship and analysis, observing that [...] "much of what he writes is sensitive and penetrating, and it is all informed by a great love of Haydn and an enthusiasm which would be infectious if the book were not so disorganized and unsystematic. ... He writes like a man going quickly <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>pages</b> of Haydn's works and pointing out to a friend the passages he likes most." ...|$|E

2500|$|While {{still at}} college, Jaquays became {{interested}} in science-fiction and fantasy gaming and the nascent role-playing game industry <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>pages</b> of The Space Gamer. Jaquays discovered Dungeons & Dragons in 1975 and formed the Fantastic Dungeoning Society with several friends at college including Mark Hendricks. Together they decided to create a fanzine, which would provide adventures for other Game Masters. TSR's Tim Kask gave Jaquays a casual license to publish this fanzine, The Dungeoneer, an amateur publication {{but one of the}} earliest RPG periodicals. The first issue was published in the same month as Dragon #1 (June 1976). The first issue was mainly drawn and written by Jaquays, with some contributions from other FDS members. In all, FDS produced six issues of The Dungeoneer from 1976-1978. Marketed as a [...] "dungeonmaster's publication," [...] the magazine was noteworthy for its pioneering approach to pre-factored adventures, [...] "F'Chelrak's Tomb" [...] was published in June 1976, the same month as Wee Warriors' Palace of the Vampire Queen. The publication has been an inspiration for many similarly-themed magazines in the United States and elsewhere. In addition to these [...] "honest efforts at quality contents to interest readers," [...] Jaquays began submitting artwork to TSR's in-house gaming magazine, The Dragon, in 1976. Her work appeared in the premiere issue of The Dragon, and later contributions included the cover of issue #21.|$|E
2500|$|Traditionally, manga stories {{flow from}} top to bottom and from right to left. Some {{publishers}} of translated manga keep to this original format. Other publishers mirror the pages horizontally before printing the translation, changing the reading direction to a more [...] "Western" [...] left to right, so as not to confuse foreign readers or traditional comics-consumers. This practice is known as [...] "flipping". For the most part, criticism suggests that flipping goes against the original intentions of the creator (for example, if a person wears a shirt that reads [...] "MAY" [...] on it, and gets flipped, then the word is altered to [...] "YAM"), who may be ignorant of how awkward it is to read comics when the eyes must flow <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>pages</b> and text in opposite directions, resulting in an experience that's quite distinct from reading something that flows homogeneously. If the translation is not adapted to the flipped artwork carefully enough it is also possible for the text to go against the picture, such as a person referring to something on their left in the text while pointing to their right in the graphic. Characters shown writing with their right hands, the majority of them, would become left-handed when a series is flipped. Flipping may also cause oddities with familiar asymmetrical objects or layouts, such as a car being depicted with the gas pedal on the left and the brake on the right, or a shirt with the buttons on the wrong side, but these issues are minor when compared to the unnatural reading flow, and some of them could be solved with an adaptation work that goes beyond just translation and blind flipping.|$|E
