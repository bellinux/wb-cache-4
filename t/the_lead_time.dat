Later that day, the watch was upgraded to a tropical storm warning and hurricane watch from Florida City to Vero Beach after the storm's intensification became apparent. About 25hours before Katrina made landfall, the tropical storm watch was extended northward to Titusville, and a tropical storm warning and a hurricane watch was issued for Lake Okeechobee. Early on August25, a hurricane warning was issued from Florida City to Vero Beach and for Lake Okeechobee. In southeastern Florida, <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> <b>time</b> for the hurricane watch and warning occurred 31.5 and 19.5hours before landfall, respectively; both were 16.5hours less than the desired lead time. A tropical storm warning was also issued from Florida Key, southward through the Florida Keys to the Dry Tortugas, and northward along the western coast to Longboat Key. The warning in the Florida Keys occurred only nine hours {{before the onset of}} tropical storm force winds.|$|E

2500|$|Except for the 30th Anniversary Special, {{which was}} taped at Harrah's Rio in Las Vegas, Nevada, The Price Is Right has been taped in Studio 33 in CBS Television City in Hollywood, California for its entire run. The studio, {{which is also}} used for other {{television}} productions, was renamed the Bob Barker Studio in the host's honor on the ceremonial 5,000th episode taped in March 1998. When Carey became host, {{there was talk of}} the show traveling in the future. The program is usually produced in about an hour, although if there is a guest involved, some tapings will last longer because of question and answer sessions by the audience and the guest, which the host usually moderates. Two episodes are usually taped each day, normally with three taping days per week (Monday through Wednesday, with one episode taped at 12:00pm and another at 4:00pm). The program is taped in advance of its airdate. For example, the show broadcast on February 28, 2008 was taped on January 16. As with many other shows that start production in the summer, <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> <b>time</b> varies during the season, as many as fifteen weeks to as little as one day. The audience is entertained by the announcer before taping begins and in case of guests, the guest will answer questions from the audience. After the taping session, there is a drawing for a door prize. On some episodes, all members of the audience receive a prize from a sponsor or celebrity guest; those prizes are usually mentioned in the Showcase (such as a complimentary slice of Papa John's Pizza, an NHL Winter Classic game puck, a couples' gift box from Hershey's or a book authored by a guest). Television and Internet viewers have also been directed to the show's official website to enter a drawing for a similar prize offered to all viewers or another prize related to the special offer (such as the Rock of Ages signed CD). Some episodes are taped [...] "out-of-order" [...] so that a specific episode will air after other episodes have aired. Notably, the Christmas Week episodes are usually taped in early December outside of the regular rotation. An episode may be taped out-of-order if a prize package reflects a trip to an event that is taking place close to the date that episode will air (primarily with CBS properties such as the Academy of Country Music Awards, NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship, and various NFL on CBS games, most notably CBS Super Bowl years since Carey took over, but other games are offered). Other episodes may be aired out-of-order because of game-related incidents or situations beyond the network's control. Most episodes which have aired out of order have occurred when the show is taped far in advance, but in the time between the show taping and its airdate, a natural disaster took place at the trip venue. This happened in June 2005 with episodes that featured trips to New Orleans (which was later struck by Hurricane Katrina), with airdates moved to May and June 2006 and again in April 2010 with episodes that featured trips to Nashville, Tennessee (due to the May 2010 Tennessee floods), with airdates moved to September 2010.|$|E

40|$|In a {{manufacturing}} and inventory system, information on production and order <b>lead</b> <b>time</b> helps consumers’ decision whether they receive finished products or not by considering their own impatience on waiting time. In Savaşaneril et al.

40|$|International audienceA supply {{planning}} for multilevel serial production systems under <b>lead</b> <b>time</b> uncertainties is considered. The techniques {{used in industry}} are often {{based on the assumption}} that <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> <b>times</b> are known. However, in a supply chain <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> <b>times</b> are often random variables. Therefore, it is necessary to find the best values of <b>the</b> planned <b>lead</b> <b>times</b> minimising <b>the</b> total cost. It is supposed that the demand for the finished product and its due date are known. It is assumed also that <b>the</b> component <b>lead</b> <b>time</b> at each level is a random discrete variable. No restrictive hypothesis is made on such random variables; only that one supposes that the distribution probabilities are known. Therefore, we develop an efficient model to aid in MRP parameterization under <b>lead</b> <b>time</b> uncertainties, more precisely to calculate planned <b>lead</b> <b>times</b> when <b>the</b> component procurement times are random. The aim is to find the values of planned <b>lead</b> <b>times</b> which minimize <b>the</b> total cost and satisfy customers.

40|$|Abstract – The paper {{presents}} a procedure for forecasting <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> <b>times</b> of production orders {{on the basis}} of past actual <b>lead</b> <b>time</b> data. A customer for a particular production order will select the best bidder. It is rather risky to make a bid just {{on the basis of}} sales experience. A procedure is therefore proposed by which, on the basis of <b>the</b> actual <b>lead</b> <b>times</b> of operational and assembly orders processed in the company's workplaces in the past, <b>the</b> expected <b>lead</b> <b>time</b> of a planned production order can be forecasted. The result of the proposed procedure for forecasting <b>lead</b> <b>times</b> is an empirical distribution of possible <b>lead</b> <b>times</b> for a production order. On the basis of this distribution, it is possible to forecast <b>the</b> probable <b>lead</b> <b>time</b> of a production order, taking into account a confidence interval. Using the proposed procedure, the sales department can make a delivery time forecast for the customer of the planned production order.

40|$|This {{report is}} the result of a case study at Peltor AB during the spring {{semester}} of 2007. The task Peltor gave us was to improve the delivery accuracy and to lower the high finical value of delayed orders (backorder), and to divide the products into logical groups. The logical group will be a useful tool to remain a high level of service. If the level of service increases the company will be more competitive. The electronic department at Peltor has problems with delayed orders. According to Peltor, the problem is based on delivery <b>lead</b> <b>time</b> which is presumed. To increase the delivery accuracy, a <b>lead</b> <b>time</b> analysis is made to find <b>the</b> accumulated delivery <b>lead</b> <b>times</b> for each product. This is a way for Peltor to give the customer a more correct delivery <b>lead</b> <b>time</b> when <b>the</b> order is placed. The analysis shows that many of <b>the</b> delivery <b>lead</b> <b>times</b> which <b>the</b> company use today, are often miscalculated. The difference can be either longer or shorter than <b>the</b> presumed <b>lead</b> <b>time.</b> One example of a longer <b>lead</b> <b>time</b> is when <b>the</b> accumulated <b>lead</b> <b>time</b> is 91 days and <b>the</b> presumed <b>lead</b> <b>time</b> is 30 days. The difference will be 61 days, and this is the major reason why Peltor thinks products end up in the “backorder”. Our result shows that there are more factors than <b>the</b> delivery <b>lead</b> <b>time</b> which affects whether an order will be delivered on time or not...|$|R
