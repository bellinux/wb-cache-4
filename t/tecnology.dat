It is undeniable that, on the field of spellboks and also on the reading texts more advanced, the last decades correspond to an important transition period: the nationalization of didactic literature, the noticeable improving of contents and teaching methods those incorporate since digital books until learning virtual atmospheres more complexes. In this context, the information and communication <b>tecnologies</b> position theirselves since the basic ways of printing until the organization of the hipertext in the cyberspace...|$|R

2500|$|In 1959, Crown {{began making}} {{standalone}} tube power amplifiers. By 1963, solid state electronics development allowed Crown {{to produce a}} more robust tape recorder, and in 1964, their first solid state power amplifier: the low-profile SA 20-20. In 1967, the DC300 was introduced as the first AB+B circuitry amplifier with 150 watts per channel at eight ohms. The DC300 proved very popular with sound reinforcement system owners and moved Crown into a leadership position in terms of power amplifier sales worldwide. As well, the DC300 {{was seen as a}} breakthrough product by commercial sound system contractors seeking to power their constant voltage speaker systems without the frequency response limitations and power losses associated with output power transformers which had previously been required. In November 2007, after 40 years of service, the Crown DC300 was inducted into the TEC Awards <b>TECnology</b> Hall of Fame in New York on the opening day of the Audio Engineering Society's 123rd convention. George Peterson, executive editor of Mix magazine, said of the DC300 that it [...] "was a classic that really ushered in and defined the era of the modern power amplifier." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Shure SM {{series of}} {{microphones}} {{began with the}} introduction of the SM57 in 1965 and the SM58 in 1966. The SM (Studio Microphone) series microphones were originally developed with a non-reflective finish and no on-off switch for the TV studio market. The SM57 is well known for its durability and the versatile sound characteristics, much attributable to the Ernie Seeler-designed Unidyne III capsule. Produced since 1965 and still in production today, it has been widely used in many applications, including micing vocals, drums, and guitar amplifiers both in live sound and recording applications, including being used by every United States President from Lyndon Baines Johnson on. It was used by Michael Jackson when recording the lead vocals for the song [...] "Billie Jean." [...] The SM57 was inducted into the <b>TECnology</b> Hall Of Fame in 2004. Together, the Shure SM57 and SM58 have been the two bestselling microphones in the world since the late 1960s. Their feature set is nearly identical, with the main difference between the two being their different grilles. Shure later expanded the SM series, which now includes such models as the SM58, SM48, SM86, SM87A, SM57, SM94, and SM81.|$|E

2500|$|One of Shure's most {{visually}} iconic microphone {{series is}} the Unidyne series, seen in use by {{heads of state}} and popular recording artists and performers from the 1940s {{through the end of}} the twentieth century, including President John F. Kennedy, Ella Fitzgerald, and Frank Sinatra. The Model 55 Unidyne is pictured with Harry S. Truman in the famous photograph where he is holding the Chicago Tribune newspaper with the erroneous front page headline [...] "Dewey Defeats Truman." [...] It is also pictured in front of Fidel Castro on the cover of the January 19, 1959 issue of Life magazine and in front of Martin Luther King, Jr. delivering of his I Have a Dream speech during the 1963 March on Washington. The original Shure 55 Unidyne microphone was designed by engineer Ben Bauer and first produced in 1939. Shure designed the 55 Unidyne as a rugged public address microphone with good audio performance. It was notable for its single-element, unidirectional design, which was smaller, less susceptible to feedback, and less sensitive to ambient noise than other microphones of the time. Several variants of the original Unidyne have been produced, most notably the 55S or [...] "Baby Unidyne." [...] The 55S is sometimes referred to as the [...] "Elvis mic" [...] due to its frequent use by Elvis Presley, and is the microphone depicted with Elvis on the commemorative first-class Elvis stamp issued by the U.S. Postal Service in 1993. In 2008, the Unidyne Model 55 microphone was inducted into the <b>TECnology</b> Hall of Fame, and the following year, Shure released the 55SH Series II. A supercardioid version, the Super 55 Deluxe Vocal Microphone, was introduced in 2009, featuring high gain before feedback and excellent off-axis rejection and further extending Unidyne's 70-plus year legacy. The 55 Series microphones were given the [...] "IEEE Milestone" [...] award in 2014.|$|E
