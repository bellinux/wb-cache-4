25|$|The dog sleds (ikamraq sg ikamrak dual ikamrat pl in Yup'ik and Cup'ik, qamauk in Yukon and Unaliq-Pastuliq Yup'ik, ikamrag, qamaug in Cup'ig; {{often used}} in the dual for one sled) are an ancient and {{widespread}} means of transportation for Eskimo peoples, but when non-Native fur traders and explorers first traveled the Yukon River and other interior regions in the mid-19th century they observed that only Yupikized Athabaskan groups, including the Koyukon, Deg Hit'an and Holikachuk, used dogs in this way. Both of these peoples had probably learned the technique from their Iñupiat or Yup'ik Eskimo neighbors. Non-Yupikized Athabaskan groups, including the Gwich'in, Tanana, Ahtna and other Alaskan Athabaskans pulled their sleds and <b>toboggans</b> by hand, using dogs solely for hunting and as pack animals.|$|E

25|$|Historically and traditionally, the {{transportation}} of Alaskan Athabaskans is pedestrian transportation {{and they are}} traveling on foot (in winter also birchbark snowshoes). Caribou were also pursued individually on snowshoes during winter by hunters using bow and arrow. Athabascan women regularly carry their children {{with the help of}} a baby belt. Dog (Lower Tanana łiga Tanacross łii) use in many Athabaskan villages is overwhelmingly for hunting and as pack animals. Dog sleds (Lower Tanana xwtl Tanacross xědl) are an ancient and widespread means of transportation for Eskimo peoples (western central Alaskan Yup'ik people and northern and northwestern Alaskan Inupiat people), but when non-Native fur traders and explorers first traveled the Yukon River and other interior regions in the mid-19th century they observed that only a few Athabascan groups, including the Koyukon, Deg Hit'an and Holikachuk, used dogs in this way.

500|$|When Minneapolis' Park Board {{purchased}} Minnehaha Falls {{and surrounding}} land in 1889, it {{became one of}} the first state parks in the United States; only New York had created a state park by that time. The next summer the Park Board began to furnish the park with tables, seating, and lavatories. [...] By 1893 a pavilion had been built and the park approved funding for two bridges [...] "of a rustic nature", one above the falls and the other below. [...] A refectory was built in 1905 to serve [...] "refreshments of a clean and wholesome nature at a reasonable cost." [...] In 1926 the park board designated the park to be a center for winter sports activities; plans were made to build a ski jump and the board purchased <b>toboggans</b> for rental. [...] Major improvements including retaining walls, bridges, and stairs were made by federal Works Progress Administration (WPA) crews from 1936 to 1942.|$|E
500|$|The Fur Trade in Canada also {{describes}} the cultural interactions among {{three groups of}} people: the Europeans in fashionable metropolitan centres who regarded beaver hats as luxury items; the European colonial settlers who saw beaver fur as a staple that could be exported to pay for essential manufactured goods from the home country, and First Nations peoples who traded furs for industrial goods such as metal pots, knives, guns and liquor. Innis {{describes the}} central role First Nations peoples played {{in the development of}} the fur trade. Without their skilled hunting techniques, knowledge of the territory and advanced tools such as snowshoes, <b>toboggans</b> and birch-bark canoes, the fur trade would not have existed. However, dependence on European technologies disrupted First Nations societies. [...] "The new technology with its radical innovations", Innis writes, [...] "brought about such a rapid shift in the prevailing Indian culture as to lead to wholesale destruction of the peoples concerned by warfare and disease." [...] Historian Carl Berger argues that by placing First Nations culture at the centre of his analysis of the fur trade, Innis [...] "was the first to explain adequately the disintegration of native society under the thrust of European capitalism." ...|$|E

5000|$|In modern times, {{it is used}} on snow {{to carry}} one or more people (often children) down a hill or other slope for recreation. Designs vary from simple, {{traditional}} models to modern engineered composites. A <b>toboggan</b> differs from most sleds or sleighs in {{that it has no}} runners or skis (or only low ones) on the underside. The bottom of a <b>toboggan</b> rides directly on the snow. Some parks include designated <b>toboggan</b> hills where ordinary sleds are not allowed and which may include <b>toboggan</b> runs similar to bobsleigh courses.|$|R

2500|$|Ski wax is a {{material}} {{applied to the}} bottom of snow runners, including skis, snowboards, and <b>toboggans,</b> to improve their coefficient of friction performance under varying snow conditions. The two main types of wax used on skis are glide waxes and grip waxes. They address kinetic friction—to be minimized with a glide wax—and static friction—to be achieved with a grip wax. Both types of wax are designed to be matched with the varying properties of snow, including crystal type and size, and moisture content of the snow surface, which vary with temperature and the temperature history of the snow. Glide wax is selected to minimize sliding friction for both alpine and cross-country skiing. Grip wax (also called [...] "kick wax") provides on-snow traction for cross-country skiers, as they stride forward using classic technique.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{a variety}} of ways of {{classifying}} the various First Nations groups in Alberta. In anthropological terms there are two broad cultural groupings in Alberta based on different climactic/ecological regions and the ways of life adapted to those regions. [...] In {{the northern part of the}} province the Subarctic peoples relied on boreal species such as moose, woodland caribou, etc. as their main prey animals, extensively practised ice fishing, and utilized canoes, snowshoes, and <b>toboggans</b> for transportation. [...] The Plains Indians of the south lived primarily in a prairie grasslands environment (but with access as well to the nearby Rocky Mountains) and relied on the plains bison (or [...] "buffalo") as their major food source and used the travois for transportation. [...] Peoples in the central, aspen parkland belt of Alberta practiced hybrid cultures with features of both the aforementioned groups.|$|E

5000|$|Winter {{sports were}} the most {{prominent}} aspect of the carnival, most notably curling, skating, hockey, snowshoeing, <b>tobogganing</b> and even lacrosse in one year (despite being a summer sport.) <b>Tobogganing</b> in particular was heavily emphasized during the Carnival {{because it was a}} sport that was not only uniquely Canadian, but also could be the majority of social classes. Women were encouraged to freely participate in <b>tobogganing</b> provided a man was steering (or commanding) the <b>toboggan,</b> and velvet seats in fact could be added in order to increase comfort and make the activity more [...] "feminine". While all social classes could technically find a hill and <b>toboggan,</b> clubs such as the Montreal <b>Toboggan</b> Club maintained a significant separation between themselves and the lower classes. Large slides were constructed, and privatized by the sports clubs that owned them, ensuring that only those wealthy enough could take part. However, during the carnival week, visitors could be guided by club members and were allowed to use the facilities.|$|R

2500|$|Although the {{historical}} Algonquin society was largely hunting- and fishing-based, some Algonquin practiced agriculture and cultivated corn, beans and squash, the famous [...] "Three Sisters" [...] of indigenous horticulture. Being primarily a hunting nation, the people emphasized mobility. [...] They used materials that were light [...] {{and easy to}} transport. Canoes were made of birch bark, sewed with spruce roots and rendered waterproof by the application of heated spruce resin and bear grease. [...] During winter, <b>toboggans</b> were used to transport material, and people used snowshoes to get around. [...] The women used tikinaagan (cradleboards) to carry their babies. [...] It was built with wood and covered with an envelope made of leather or material. The baby was standing up with his feet resting on a small board. The mother would then put the tikinàgan on her back. This allowed the infant to look around and observe his surroundings. [...] The child was kept close to the mother but also had much stimulation.|$|E
60|$|There {{remained}} now {{nothing for}} us to do but to toboggan down the mountain, and we overcame our resolution not to do so far enough to go and look at the <b>toboggans</b> under the guidance of our head-waiter. When once we had looked we were lost. The <b>toboggans</b> were flat baskets set on iron-shod runners, and well cushioned and padded; they held one, two, or three passengers; the track on which they descended was paved, in gentle undulations, with thin pebbles set on edge and greased wherever the descent found a level. A smiling native, with a strong rope attached to the toboggan, stood on each side of it, and held it back or pulled it forward, according to the exigencies of the case. It is long since I slid down hill on a sled of my own, and I do not pretend to recall the sensation; but I can remember nothing so luxurious in transportation as the swift flight of the Madeira toboggan, which you temper at will through its guides and guards, but do not wish to temper at all when your first alarm, mainly theoretical, passes into the gayety ending in exultant rejoicing {{at the bottom of the}} course.|$|E

I do not mind if he adds a few pennies for the children who ran before our toboggan and tossed camellias into it, and then followed in the hopes of a reward, which we tried not to disappoint.|$|E

6000|$|Near by a dam {{was built}} across the river, and a fishing trap {{made out of}} willows was set in the current. Piles of caribou hair showed that the Indians found game in the autumn. We took time to explore some old fishing huts filled with curious things,--skins, <b>toboggans,</b> dog-collars, cedar ropes, and many other traps of small value to anybody. Most curious of all we found some flint-lock muskets made exactly on the models of one hundred years ago, but dated 1883!

6000|$|Our two {{toboggan}} {{men were}} possibly vigilant and reassuring beyond the common, but one was quite silently so; the other, who spoke a little English, encouraged us {{from time to}} time to believe that they were [...] "strong mans," [...] afterward correcting himself in conformity to the rules of Portuguese grammar, which make the adjective agree in number with the noun, and declaring that they were [...] "strongs mans." [...] We met many toboggan men who needed to be [...] "strongs mans" [...] in their ascent of our track, with their heavy <b>toboggans</b> on their heads; but some of them did not look strong, and our own arrived spent and panting at the bottom. Something like that is what always spoils pleasure in this world.

60|$|Different {{from the}} Mackenzie <b>toboggans</b> were the Klondike sleds with runners under them. And {{different}} was {{the method of}} driving the dogs. There was no fan-formation of the team. The dogs worked in single file, one behind another, hauling on double traces. And here, in the Klondike, the leader was indeed the leader. The wisest as well as strongest dog was the leader, and the team obeyed him and feared him. That White Fang should quickly gain this post was inevitable. He could not be satisfied with less, as Matt learned after much inconvenience and trouble. White Fang picked out the post for himself, and Matt backed his judgment with strong language after the experiment had been tried. But, though {{he worked in the}} sled in the day, White Fang did not forego the guarding of his master's property in the night. Thus he was on duty all the time, ever vigilant and faithful, the most valuable of all the dogs.|$|E
60|$|Need I {{say that}} my recent cogitations and {{experience}} led me to join this riotous crew with redoubled ardour? Taking off my skates hurriedly and climbing up the hill, I leaped on the tail of Big Otter's toboggan, without invitation, {{just as he was}} starting {{at the top of the}} snow-slope to follow Lumley. I gave the sled such an impetus that we overtook our chief, and upset him just as he reached the lake, causing him to collide with Donald Bane and James Dougall, who, seated on the same toboggan, were anxiously striving to keep their balance. The result was, that we all resolved ourselves into a conglomerate of <b>toboggans</b> and men, which went shooting and struggling over the smooth lake for fifty yards or upwards at the rate of twelve miles an hour, if not more. This, of course, afforded unutterable delight to the rest of our men, and to Waboose and her mother; as well as to several Indians, who had just arrived.
