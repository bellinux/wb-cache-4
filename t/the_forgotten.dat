5|$|With {{the release}} of the Dungeons & Dragons 4th Edition, <b>the</b> <b>Forgotten</b> Realms were updated again to the new rules system, {{featuring}} a very changed Realms and moving the fictional world's timeline 104 years into the future. <b>The</b> <b>Forgotten</b> Realms Campaign Guide, released August 2008, is a 288-page book for Dungeon Masters. <b>The</b> <b>Forgotten</b> Realms Player's Guide was released the following month, and contains information for players to help create Forgotten Realms characters. An adventure, Scepter Tower of Spellgard, was also released in September 2008 and can be used in combination with the adventure in <b>the</b> <b>Forgotten</b> Realms Campaign Guide to start a Forgotten Realms campaign. In 2008, <b>the</b> <b>Forgotten</b> Realms also became the setting for the RPGA's sole living campaign, Living Forgotten Realms, replacing Living Greyhawk. In 2011, the Neverwinter Campaign Setting was released.|$|E

40|$|Across 3 {{experiments}} {{we examined}} the interplay of part-list cuing and forgetting, employing 3 different methods to induce episodic forgetting { list-method directed forgetting, context-dependent forgetting, and proactive interference. For each form of forgetting, participants were asked at test to recall the target items of a previously studied list, in the presence or {{the absence of the}} list's remaining items serving as retrieval cues. We found such part-list cuing to amplify <b>the</b> <b>forgetting</b> in proactive interference but to diminish <b>the</b> <b>forgetting</b> in list-method directed forgetting and context-dependent forgetting. These results show that the effects of part-list cuing on forgotten memories depend critically on the circumstances surrounding <b>the</b> <b>forgetting.</b> If <b>the</b> <b>forgetting</b> reflects impaired access to the original encoding context, as has been suggested in list-method directed forgetting and context-dependent forgetting (but not in proactive interference), part-list cues improve access to <b>forgotten</b> memories; if <b>the</b> <b>forgetting</b> does not reflect such a contextual effect, no such beneficial effects emerge and access to forgotten memories may even be impaired...|$|R

40|$|We study three {{quantities}} {{that can}} each {{be viewed as}} the time needed for a finite irreducible Markov chain to "forget" where it started. One of these is the mixing time, the minimum mean length of a stopping rule that yields the stationary distribution from the worst starting state. A second is <b>the</b> <b>forget</b> time, <b>the</b> minimum mean length of any stopping rule that yields the same distribution from any starting state. The third is the reset time, the minimum expected time between independent samples from the stationary distribution. Our main results state that the mixing time of a chain is equal to the mixing time of the time-reversed chain, while <b>the</b> <b>forget</b> time of a chain is equal to the reset time of the reverse chain. In particular, <b>the</b> <b>forget</b> time and <b>the</b> reset time of a time-reversible chain are equal. Moreover, the mixing time lies between absolute constant multiples of the sum of <b>the</b> <b>forget</b> time and <b>the</b> reset time.

5|$|The {{story is}} {{expanded}} in two DLC packs titled Reverie and Resurrection. Reverie has Gabriel returning to Carmilla's castle to contain an ancient evil, <b>the</b> <b>Forgotten</b> One (Colin McFarlane), {{with the help}} of Carmilla's daughter Laura (Grace Vance), who is also a playable character that assists Gabriel in some sequences of the DLC. Before entering a portal into <b>the</b> <b>Forgotten</b> One's prison, Laura tells Gabriel he cannot enter it in his mortal form and dies after she has Gabriel drink her blood to use its powers to enter, turning him into a vampire. During Resurrection, <b>the</b> <b>Forgotten</b> One aspires to destroy the humans' world, but he is defeated by Gabriel who claims his power for himself. Corrupted by <b>the</b> <b>Forgotten</b> One's power, Gabriel destroys his Combat Cross and leaves through the portal.|$|E

5|$|The {{focus of}} <b>the</b> <b>Forgotten</b> Realms setting is the {{continent}} of Faerûn, part of the fictional world of Abeir-Toril, usually called simply Toril, an Earth-like planet with many real-world influences. Unlike Earth, the lands of <b>the</b> <b>Forgotten</b> Realms are not all ruled by the human race: the planet Toril is shared by humans, dwarves, elves, goblins, orcs, and other peoples and creatures. Technologically, the world of <b>the</b> <b>Forgotten</b> Realms {{is not nearly as}} advanced as that of Earth; in this respect, it resembles the pre-industrial Earth of the 13th or 14th century. However, the presence of magic provides an additional element of power to the societies. There are several nation states and many independent cities, with loose alliances being formed for defense or conquest. Trade is performed by ship or horse-drawn vehicle, and manufacturing is based upon cottage industry.|$|E
