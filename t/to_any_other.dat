5|$|The three known {{species of}} vampire bats all seem {{more similar to}} one another than <b>to</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> species. That {{suggests}} that sanguivorous habits (feeding on blood) evolved only once, and the three species share a common ancestor.|$|E

5|$|After failing a drug test, Fakhruddin Abdulmajid Taher of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) was {{stripped}} of his silver medal in the men's kumite event (60kg category) of karate. This disqualification left the UAE with only a single bronze medal, placing the country joint-last in the medal table with four other nations. The silver medal was not awarded <b>to</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> athlete.|$|E
5|$|As B.menziesii is not similar <b>to</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> Banksia, hybrids are {{unlikely}} to occur. The only reported hybrid is a sterile hybrid with B.hookeriana (Hooker's banksia), found north of Badgingarra by Greg Keighery. Manual cross-fertilisation with B.attenuata has resulted in germination, indicating that these two species are genetically compatible, but natural hybrids are extremely unlikely because the two species flower at different times.|$|E

5|$|In genetics, a {{genome-wide}} association study (GWA study, or GWAS), {{also known}} as whole genome association study (WGA study, or WGAS), is an observational study of a genome-wide set of genetic variants in different individuals {{to see if any}} variant is associated with a trait. GWASs typically focus on associations between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and traits like major human diseases, but can equally be applied <b>to</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> organism.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, a limited-access highway was {{constructed}} between Utica and Ilion alongside NY5S. The new highway {{became part of}} a rerouted NY5S in the early 1970s. As a result, NY171, which does not interchange with the highway, no longer connects <b>to</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> signed state routes. NY171 is the only signed state highway in New York that is completely isolated from {{the remainder of the}} state highway system.|$|E
5|$|It was {{determined}} that P. rebeli larvae use chemical mimicry to persuade the M. schencki ants that the P. rebeli {{are part of the}} ant brood. Furthermore, M. schencki ants cannot distinguish the physical differences between the P. rebeli larvae and other non-kin brood because the P. rebeli larvae are far more similar to the M. schencki larvae than <b>to</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> ant species larvae.|$|E

5|$|Manchester's civic {{leadership}} {{has a reputation}} for business acumen. It owns two of the country's four busiest airports and uses its earnings to fund local projects. Meanwhile, KPMG's competitive alternative report found that in 2012 Manchester had the 9th lowest tax cost of any industrialised city in the world, and fiscal devolution has come earlier to Manchester than <b>to</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> British city: it can keep half the extra taxes it gets from transport investment.|$|E

5|$|After his accession, Diocletian and Lucius Caesonius Bassus {{were named}} as consuls and assumed the fasces {{in place of}} Carinus and Numerianus. Bassus {{was a member of}} a senatorial family from Campania, a former consul and proconsul of Africa, chosen by Probus for signal distinction. He was skilled in areas of {{government}} where Diocletian presumably had no experience. Diocletian's elevation of Bassus as consul symbolized his rejection of Carinus' government in Rome, his refusal to accept second-tier status <b>to</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> emperor, and his willingness to continue the long-standing collaboration between the empire's senatorial and military aristocracies. It also tied his success to that of the Senate, whose support he would need in his advance on Rome.|$|E

They have been left as originally constructed and there are not any plans to improve upon them, because people are reluctant to tamper with the original shrine complex.|$|E
