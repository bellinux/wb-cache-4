40|$|Abstract. <b>The</b> <b>hazard</b> of {{chemical}} process equipment {{consists of two}} parts: <b>the</b> inherent <b>hazard</b> of process equipment and <b>the</b> <b>hazard</b> from domino effect among equipments. <b>The</b> inherent <b>hazard</b> of equipment depends on {{the properties of the}} substance present in the equipment and the specific process conditions. The domino effect is responsibility for many most destructive accidents in the chemical process industry. However, domino effect is either not considered at all or is done with much less rigour than is warranted. A method was proposed to evaluate <b>the</b> <b>hazard</b> {{of chemical}} process equipment. <b>The</b> inherent <b>hazard</b> and <b>the</b> <b>hazard</b> from domino effect were considered in the method.

5|$|The Comet was {{powered by}} {{two pairs of}} {{turbojet}} engines buried in the wings close to the fuselage. Chief designer Bishop chose the Comet's embedded-engine configuration because it avoided the drag of podded engines and allowed for a smaller fin and rudder, since <b>the</b> <b>hazards</b> of asymmetric thrust were reduced. The engines were outfitted with baffles to reduce noise emissions, and extensive soundproofing was also implemented to improve passenger conditions.|$|E

5|$|Both Neotrypaea californiensis and the {{mud shrimp}} Upogebia pugettensis live in mudflats and sandy {{substrates}} in the intertidal zone of estuaries in western North America. N.californiensis is found from Mutiny Bay, Alaska to Punta Abreojos, Mulegé, Baja California Sur, Mexico. Its habitat {{is also used}} for the aquaculture of the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas. Since the bioturbation carried out by N.californiensis and U. pugettensis reduces the productivity of the oyster beds, they are considered pests. Their effects may, however, have knock-on effects across the entire ecosystem, and may buffer it from <b>the</b> <b>hazards</b> of nutrient enrichment and increase primary and secondary productivity by {{increasing the amount of}} dissolved inorganic nitrogen.|$|E
5|$|Overall, {{the risk}} of sinkholes {{occurring}} in Guatemala City is high and unpredictable. One recent, similar sinkhole had collapsed in 2007, forming a pit 100 metres deep. The 2007 Guatemala City sinkhole was formed by fluid from a sewer eroding uncemented volcanic ash, limestone, and other pyroclastic deposits underlying Guatemala City. <b>The</b> <b>hazards</b> around the pipe have since then been mitigated, by improved handling of the city's wastewater and runoff. Several rainstorms {{also contributed to the}} sinkhole's collapse, as stormwater percolated into the ground, further dissolving the rocks beneath Guatemala City. The 2010 sinkhole was formed for similar reasons.|$|E

The prairie {{could be dangerous}} in time of native unrest, and trade ceased entirely for a time during the Dakota War of 1862. Prairie fires, driven by winds, were a risk in dry spells. Wet weather turned rivers into torrents, approaches to streams into bogs, and worn paths into morasses. Blizzards could strand traders and threaten them with starvation. Insects harassed both the traders and their draft animals, depriving them of sleep and weakening them.|$|E

Tesla incorrectly believed that X-rays were longitudinal waves, such as those produced in waves in plasmas. These plasma waves can occur in force-free magnetic fields.|$|E

When he felt they were ready for the main journey he divided them into four teams and sent the first two away on 19 February.

The distance to Wrangel Island was estimated at , but the journey proved to be twice that in length.|$|E
5|$|In 1820 Accum {{began the}} public {{struggle}} against harmful food additives with his book entitled A Treatise on Adulterations of Food and Culinary Poisons. Some additives derived from plants, {{and used as}} preservatives or to alter tastes or appearance, had already been in use for some time. The beginning of the 19th century saw a rapid increase in the industrial preparation and packaging of foods. The drastic increase of additives used in these processes became a serious health concern. The production and distribution of food, instead of being one between local farmers and townspeople, increasingly became a centralized process in large factories. The proliferation of newly discovered chemicals {{and the absence of}} laws moderating their use, made it possible for unscrupulous merchants to use them to boost profits at a cost to the public health. Accum was the first to publicly proclaim <b>the</b> <b>hazards</b> of this practice and to reach a wide audience with his concerns.|$|E
5|$|In 1825, Brisbane was {{established}} as a penal settlement. In spite of <b>the</b> <b>hazards,</b> the preferred access to Moreton Bay and Brisbane was through the southern entrance, between Moreton Island and North Stradbroke Island, mainly due to shorter shipping route and better shipping conditions. The southern entrance was therefore marked in 1825 and a pilot station {{was established}} at Amity Point on North Stradbroke Island in 1827. Although the northern entrance was considered in the 1830s, it was only with the increased shipping activity due to proclamation of Moreton Bay as a free settlement in 1842 that vessels began to use the northern entrance. Buoys marking the entrance were laid in 1846–1847, and in 1848 the Pilot Station was moved to Bulwer on Moreton island. By then the northern entry was regarded as the main entry.|$|E
