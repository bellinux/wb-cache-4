In 2007 the Academy Award winning {{director}} of Shall We Dance released his new film, {{a critique of}} the Japanese criminal justice system from a wrongful conviction perspective. In this article, I use the film as a vehicle to serve three disparate goals. First, I provide the first legal critique of the film, a genre of legal scholarship developing over the past 15 years. Second, I use the film to reflect on criminal justice reforms in Japan, in particular the introduction of the Lay Judge System (quasi-jury saiban-in seido) from 2009. Third, I critically ask whether use of film as a legal <b>text</b> <b>assists</b> or distracts from my primary pedagogical objectives in teaching comparative Japanese law.
