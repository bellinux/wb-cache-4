She returned to private life, remarried, and dedicated her time to raise her three children: Malusi, José, and Deysi. Her police protection came to an end when her mayoral term expired in 2011.|$|E
5|$|A {{few months}} later, Gorrostieta Salazar {{announced}} {{that she was still}} willing to work and returned to her duties as mayor. By then, she contacted the leaders of <b>the</b> <b>PRI</b> to ask for protection, but she encountered difficulties, including unanswered phone calls.|$|E
5|$|The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) {{refers to}} the {{collective}} set of information as Dietary Reference Values, with Population Reference Intake (PRI) instead of RDA, and Average Requirement instead of EAR. AI and UL defined {{the same as in}} United States. For people ages 18 and older <b>the</b> <b>PRI</b> calculations are complex, as the EFSA has set higher and higher values as the phytate content of the diet increases. For women, PRIs increase from 7.5 to 12.7 mg/day as phytate intake increases from 300 to 1200 mg/day; for men the range is 9.4 to 16.3 mg/day. These PRIs are higher than the U.S. RDAs. The EFSA reviewed the same safety question and set its UL at 25mg/day, which is much lower than the U.S. value.|$|E

5000|$|Although the {{intention}} of the sexenio was to prevent presidential dictatorship, this system has not met with total success. This was in part because the presidency was monopolized by the Institutional Revolutionary Party from 1929 to 2000. From 1929 to 1994, presidents approaching the end of their sexenio personally chose <b>the</b> <b>PRI's</b> presidential nominee in the next election. <b>The</b> <b>PRI's</b> dominance was so absolute that the president essentially chose his successor.|$|R

Nevertheless, most individual officeholders tend to view LGBT issues as a private matter (to be ignored) or a moral problem (to be opposed). <b>The</b> <b>PRI</b> has allied with the PAN to block legislation concerning LGBT rights in some states (except in two cases).

40|$|Rural {{government}} decentralization in West Bengal {{has been}} a focus of the state government since the state’s 1973 Panchayat Act. The three-tiered Panchayat Raj (PRI) system provides a role for governance at the district, block, and gram panchayat levels. The Government of West Bengal (GOWB) has been providing support and assistance to <b>the</b> <b>PRIs</b> to improve service delivery and governance. To date, the perceived problems related to <b>the</b> <b>PRIs</b> include a lack of fiscal decentralization to <b>the</b> <b>PRIs,</b> a lack of untied and own source revenues and expenditure authority, limited capacity especially at the GP level for meeting public service demands, lack of modernization and computerization of budgets, expenditures, and receipts, and poor service delivery, This paper analyzes {{the current state of}} <b>PRI</b> finances in <b>the</b> state of West Bengal and provides analysis of options of expanding the level of subnational grants. ...|$|R

25|$|The {{day after}} Trump visited Mexico, Peña Nieto gave an annual speech, {{focusing}} on his 4th year of government, which {{was surrounded by}} controversy after denying plagiarism of his thesis despite evidence and fallout from Trump's visit.

25|$|Carlos Salinas became presidential {{candidate}} in a difficult time for <b>the</b> <b>PRI</b> which {{for the first time}} was faced by significant opposition from the left (National Democratic Front) and from the right (National Action Party, PAN).

25|$|After twelve years, in 2012, <b>the</b> <b>PRI</b> won the Presidency {{again with}} the {{election}} of Enrique Peña Nieto, the governor of the State of Mexico from 2005–2011. However, he won with only a plurality of about 38%, and did not have a legislative majority.|$|E
25|$|On May 19, Roberto Madrazo, presidential {{candidate}} for <b>the</b> <b>PRI,</b> considered by all polls {{to be in}} a distant third place, hinted at the possibility of an alliance with López Obrador to prevent Calderón from winning the election, after both the parties had criticized the government for what, in their opinion, is supposed illegal support by the federal government for the National Action Party (PAN) candidate's campaigning. The PRD has said that both parties have entered into an information sharing agreement regarding the issue. This, combined with calls from high ranking PRI member Manuel Bartlett (former interior secretary when the alleged 1988 presidential election fraud was committed) to vote for López, aroused media speculation that <b>the</b> <b>PRI</b> and the PRD would indeed ally.|$|E
50|$|In 1994, López Obrador {{ran for the}} {{governorship}} of his home state, but lost to <b>the</b> <b>PRI's</b> Roberto Madrazo in a highly controversial electionwhere Roberto Madrazo was questioned for his excessive expenses in political propaganda.|$|R

25|$|Velázquez {{called off}} the {{traditional}} May Day rallies in 1995, threatening those who disobeyed with fines or expulsion, {{in order to}} avoid the possibility of embarrassing displays of opposition to the CTM and <b>the</b> <b>PRI.</b> Instead of a May Day march in 1996 a group set up a mock funeral for Velázquez in retaliation.|$|E
25|$|The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) {{refers to}} the {{collective}} set of information as Dietary Reference Values (DRV), with Population Reference Intake (PRI) instead of RDA, and Average Requirement instead of EAR. AI and UL defined {{the same as in}} United States. For women (including those pregnant or lactating), men and children <b>the</b> <b>PRI</b> is 1.6 mg niacin per megajoule (MJ) of energy consumed. As the conversion is 1 MJ = 238.8 kcal, an adult consuming 2388 calories should be consuming 16 mg niacin. This is comparable to U.S. RDAs. The niacin UL is set at 10mg/day, which is much less than the U.S. value. The UL applies to niacin as a supplement consumed as one dose, and in intended to avoid the skin flush reaction. This explains why <b>the</b> <b>PRI</b> can be higher than the UL.|$|E
25|$|In 1946, the CTM {{joined in}} forming {{the newly formed}} PRI, the {{successor}} party of the PRM, becoming once again one of its constituent parts.

25|$|At {{the time}} of the earthquake, Mexico was in its fifth year of a foreign debt crisis, and a {{contracting}} economy causing serious political problems for the Institutional Revolutionary Party (<b>PRI).</b> Much of <b>the</b> <b>PRI's</b> authoritarian nature was tolerated because the country had seen four decades of economic expansion of six percent or better. When this disappeared, <b>the</b> <b>PRI's</b> power base began to shrink. Its reputation was damaged further when the government seemed to be deliberately downplaying the number of earthquake victims. President de la Madrid made relatively few public appearances afterwards and during those he did, he received strong heckling, in contrast to the near-reverence that past presidents enjoyed at such events.|$|R
