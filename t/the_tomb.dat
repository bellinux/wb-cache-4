5|$|An Early Classic tomb was {{inserted}} under the main pyramid at Zaculeu; {{it had been}} tunnelled from the volcanic ash underlying the structure. A broad stairway descended to <b>the</b> <b>tomb</b> from the main plaza. <b>The</b> <b>tomb</b> interior was painted red and the floor was scattered with the remains of more than 100 ceramic vessels. These were crushed when the roof of <b>the</b> <b>tomb</b> collapsed. Also found were the remains of 34 pyrite mirrors of a type {{similar to those found}} at Kaminaljuyu. A sizeable quantity of jade was recovered from <b>the</b> <b>tomb,</b> including beads and earplugs. Some of the jade beads had been carved to represent human and parrot faces. <b>The</b> <b>tomb</b> contained the bones of four or more individuals. The ceramic offerings included decorated tripod vessels, polychrome bowls and a polychrome cylindrical vase that had a painted band of hieroglyphs. One ceramic bowl is painted in a negative painting style that is similar to finds from Nebaj.|$|E
5|$|Another notable tomb {{from this}} dynasty is KV19, <b>the</b> <b>tomb</b> of Mentuherkhepshef (son of Ramesses IX). This small tomb {{is simply a}} converted, {{unfinished}} corridor, but the decoration is extensive. <b>The</b> <b>tomb</b> has been newly restored and opened for visitors.|$|E
5|$|Burial 10 is <b>the</b> <b>tomb</b> of Yax Nuun Ayiin. It {{is located}} beneath Structure 34 in the North Acropolis. <b>The</b> <b>tomb</b> {{contained}} a rich array of offerings, including ceramic vessels and food, and nine youths were sacrificed {{to accompany the}} dead king. A dog was also entombed with the deceased king. Pots in <b>the</b> <b>tomb</b> were stuccoed and painted and many demonstrated a blend of Maya and Teotihuacan styles. Among the offerings was an incense-burner {{in the shape of}} an elderly underworld god, sitting on a stool made of human bones and holding a severed head in his hands. <b>The</b> <b>tomb</b> was sealed with a corbel vault, then the pyramid was built on top.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>tombs</b> {{were made}} of large cypress planks. The outside of <b>the</b> <b>tombs</b> were layered with white clay and charcoal. White clay {{layering}} originated with Chu burials, while charcoal layering was practiced during the early western Han dynasty in the Changsha area. <b>The</b> <b>tombs</b> contained nested lacquered coffins, a Chu burial custom. <b>The</b> <b>tombs</b> also followed <b>the</b> burial practices dictated by Emperor Wen of Han, containing no jade or precious metals.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>tombs</b> form a large cluster {{and stand}} on a raised platform. <b>The</b> <b>tombs</b> are domed {{structures}} built on a square base surrounded by pointed arches, a distinctive style that blends Persian, Pashtun and Hindu forms. <b>The</b> <b>tombs</b> are structures with intricately carved stonework and are surrounded by landscaped gardens.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>tombs</b> {{are in a}} {{dilapidated}} condition. Erosion was made all over the complex due to the entry of water, damaging <b>the</b> <b>tombs.</b>|$|R
5|$|Jerome {{reports that}} {{apparently}} the Christians {{had intended to}} remove Joseph's bones to their city, but a column of fire rose skyward from <b>the</b> <b>tomb</b> scaring them away. The Samaritans subsequently covered <b>the</b> <b>tomb</b> with earth rendering it inaccessible.|$|E
5|$|Peribsen {{was buried}} in <b>the</b> <b>tomb</b> P of the royal {{cemetery}} at Umm el-Qa'ab near Abydos. The first excavation of <b>the</b> <b>tomb</b> started in 1898 {{under the supervision of}} French archaeologist and Egyptologist Émile Amélineau. This first foray was followed by excavations in 1901 and 1902 under the supervision of British archaeologist Sir William Matthew Flinders Petrie. Further exploration of <b>the</b> <b>tomb</b> was undertaken in 1928 by the Swiss Egyptologist Edouard Naville.|$|E
5|$|Pompey, Julius Caesar and Augustus all visited <b>the</b> <b>tomb</b> in Alexandria, where Augustus, allegedly, accidentally {{knocked the}} nose off. Caligula {{was said to}} have taken Alexander's {{breastplate}} from <b>the</b> <b>tomb</b> for his own use. Around AD200, Emperor Septimius Severus closed Alexander's tomb to the public. His son and successor, Caracalla, a great admirer, visited <b>the</b> <b>tomb</b> during his own reign. After this, details on the fate of <b>the</b> <b>tomb</b> are hazy.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Tombs</b> of <b>the</b> Sanhedrin {{have been}} a site for Jewish pilgrimage and prayer since the thirteenth century. Since medieval times, Jews {{considered}} <b>the</b> <b>tombs</b> holy and would not pass by them without stopping to pray there. In <b>the</b> mid-1800s, <b>the</b> <b>tombs</b> were demarcated by a huge boulder that guided pilgrims to the site.|$|R
5|$|The Palestine Exploration Fund {{noted that}} the Samaritans {{believed}} that <b>the</b> <b>tomb</b> of Asher, known locally as Nabi Tota ("the good prophet"), was located in Tubas. <b>The</b> <b>tomb</b> served as a shrine in local Muslim tradition.|$|E
5|$|The {{array of}} {{different}} types and styles of ceramic found during the excavations of Gedi provide information about the city's trade ties through the origin of imported vessels and aid in dating the site through seriation. At Gedi, a chronology has been established for the appearance {{of many of the}} ceramics, which have been found in deposits up to five feet. The dated tomb with an inscription connecting it to AD 1399 has served as a datum point for dating the stratigraphic layers. Celadon, Islamic monochromes, and blue and white Chinese porcelain were found in levels above <b>the</b> <b>tomb,</b> which date to the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Below <b>the</b> <b>tomb,</b> yellow and black Islamic wares were found down to the natural soil, while celadon was found in layers immediately below <b>the</b> <b>tomb.</b> The celadon below <b>the</b> <b>tomb</b> varied from the celadon found above <b>the</b> <b>tomb,</b> since carvings of lotus pedals were more common on the celadon in the lower layers. Given the date of <b>the</b> <b>tomb,</b> it was determined that the ceramics above <b>the</b> <b>tomb</b> dated to the fifteenth century, which helped extrapolate dates for the remaining stratigraphy.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>tomb</b> of Ramesses IX, KV6, {{has been}} open since antiquity, {{as can be}} seen by the {{graffiti}} left on its walls by Roman and Coptic visitors. Located in {{the central part of the}} valley, it is between and slightly above KV5 and KV55. <b>The</b> <b>tomb</b> extends a total distance of 105 metres into the hillside, including extensive side chambers that were neither decorated nor finished. The hasty and incomplete nature of the rock-cutting and decorations (it is only decorated for a little over half its length) within <b>the</b> <b>tomb</b> indicate that <b>the</b> <b>tomb</b> was not completed by the time of Ramesses' death, with the completed hall of pillars serving as the burial chamber.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>tombs</b> are {{generally}} constructed from large blocks of tuff carved {{directly into the}} cliff, and are entered from stairs heading down into the rock.

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>tombs</b> of <b>the</b> Pharonic kings in "valley of the kings", Thebes, Egypt {{are famous}} for their unique wall {{paintings}} and structure.

The present work pursues a research plan to design and utilize a CFD model to numerically model the flow pattern, heat transfer and humidity in <b>the</b> <b>tombs.</b> A commercial CFD package was used to simulate the indoor air conditions, air flow velocities, temperatures and relative humidity patterns in <b>the</b> <b>tombs.</b> Still all shown predictions clearly indicated the usefulness of raised-floor extracts that do not disturb the archeological value of <b>the</b> <b>tombs</b> and do not install any artificial materials inside <b>the</b> <b>tombs...</b>|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>tomb</b> of {{the lord}} of the goats: it is the largest in the necropolis; it {{includes}} two depositional chambers and is reached through a vertical shaft. The occupier of <b>the</b> <b>tomb</b> is not known with certainty, he is called {{the lord of the}} goats by archaeologists due to the existence of a throne decorated with bronze goat heads in <b>the</b> <b>tomb.</b> A silver cup that has the name of king Immeya inscribed was found in <b>the</b> <b>tomb</b> making that king the most likely owner of the burial.|$|E

5|$|After {{the events}} of October 2000, the IDF {{prohibited}} Israeli access to <b>the</b> <b>tomb.</b> As a result of Operation Defensive Shield, Nablus was reoccupied by the IDF in April 2002, with severe damage to the historic core of the city, where 64 heritage buildings suffered serious damage or were destroyed. Some Breslov hasidim and others began {{to take advantage of}} the new circumstances to visit the site clandestinely under the cover of darkness, evading army and police checkpoints. Eventually Joseph’s tomb was once more open to visits. In May 2002, Israeli soldiers mistakenly opened fire on a convoy of settlers taking advantage of an ongoing incursion in Nablus to visit <b>the</b> <b>tomb.</b> Seven settlers were arrested by the army for illegally entering a combat zone. As a result of Operation Defensive Shield, <b>the</b> <b>tomb</b> was retaken by the IDF and shortly afterwards, in response to numerous requests, they renewed guarded tours of <b>the</b> <b>tomb.</b> One day every month at midnight as many as 800 visitors were allowed to pray at the gravesite. These visits were designed to prevent unauthorized and unprotected clandestine visits, mainly by Breslav Hassidim. However, in October, citing security reasons, Israel re-imposed a ban on Jewish pilgrims obtaining special permits and travelling to <b>the</b> <b>tomb.</b>|$|E
