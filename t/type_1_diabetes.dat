5|$|Drugs in the gliflozin class (SGLT2 inhibitors), {{which are}} {{generally}} used for type 2 diabetes, {{have been associated}} with cases of diabetic ketoacidosis where the blood sugars are not significantly elevated ("euglycemic DKA").

5|$|DKA happens {{most often}} in those with <b>type</b> <b>1</b> <b>{{diabetes}},</b> but can also occur in those {{with other types of}} diabetes under certain circumstances. Triggers may include infection, not taking insulin correctly, stroke, and certain medications such as steroids. DKA results from a shortage of insulin; in response the body switches to burning fatty acids which produces acidic ketone bodies. DKA is typically diagnosed when testing finds high blood sugar, low blood pH, and ketoacids in either the blood or urine.|$|E

Thyroid disorders (thyroiditis and Graves' disease) are also usual in coeliac disease.

40|$|Abstract- Objective: The {{study was}} done with the purpose of {{evaluating}} the adrenal cortical response to 1 microgram ACTH stimulation test in children with type- <b>1</b> <b>diabetes</b> and compared with that of controls.

Ramaiah Medical College and Teaching Hospital and 20 age and sex matched controls from Happy Home Orphange, KGF were infused with 1 µg ACTH. Methods: Cortisol levels were estimated using radio immunoassay technique, before and 30 minute after 1 µg ACTH infusion. Results: The cortisol levels significantly increased in normal as well as children with <b>type</b> – <b>1</b> <b>diabetes.</b> But the increase was not found to be the same in both the groups. The effect of ACTH in increasing cortisol levels is much more in normal as compared to children with type- <b>1</b> <b>diabetes.</b> Conclusion: The results suggest a blunted adrenal cortisol response to ACTH in children with type- <b>1</b> <b>diabetes,</b> which might influence the control of the disease and {{play a role in the}} development of its chronic complications.
