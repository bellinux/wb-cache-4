25|$|On 15 October, President Bolaños {{sent to the}} National Assembly a draft on a {{proposed}} reform of the penal code in order to penalize <b>therapeutic</b> <b>abortion.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Catholic Church {{organised}} a {{march on}} the National Assembly on 6 October {{to demand that}} <b>therapeutic</b> <b>abortion</b> be criminalized in the penal code.

25|$|In late August, the Sandinista Renovation Movement (MRS) {{candidate}} Edmundo Jarquín {{stated that}} he supported <b>therapeutic</b> <b>abortion</b> when {{the life of the}} mother is at risk. Abortion under these circumstances had been legal in Nicaragua since 1891. Abortion other than therapeutic is punishable by imprisonment from one to three years.|$|E
40|$|<b>Therapeutic</b> <b>abortions</b> in California have {{increased}} from 5, 030 in 1968 to 15, 339 in 1969, and over 60, 000 are estimated for 1970. Also, there are pronounced regional differences in <b>therapeutic</b> <b>abortions</b> relative to live births. In 1969 the San Francisco Bay Area had {{six times as}} many abortions (115 per 1000 births) as did the Los Angeles Metropolitan Area (19). Preliminary figures for 1970 indicate this difference may be narrowed to a two-fold difference {{by the end of}} the year...|$|R
5000|$|Until 2004, Manitoba did not fund private {{abortion}} clinics. However, in July 2004 the province's only private {{abortion clinic}} {{was purchased by}} a non-profit organization, which then successfully sued the provincial government to pay for abortion procedures there. In December 2004, a Manitoba Justice ruled that the province must pay for all <b>therapeutic</b> <b>abortions.</b> [...] This was overruled in 2005 by the Manitoba Court of Appeal because the trial Justice should not have made a decision based on written documents only. [...] Leave {{to appeal to the}} Supreme Court of Canada was denied. [...] The same plaintiffs have launched a new court challenge to the government practice of not paying for <b>therapeutic</b> <b>abortions</b> outside of hospitals.|$|R
40|$|BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 {{mutation}} {{carriers are}} {{at increased risk}} for developing both breast and ovarian cancer. It has been suggested that carriers of BRCA 1 / 2 mutations may also be at increased risk of having recurrent (three or more) miscarriages. Several reproductive factors have been shown to influence {{the risk of breast cancer}} in mutation carriers, but the effects of spontaneous and <b>therapeutic</b> <b>abortions</b> on the risk of hereditary breast cancer risk have not been well studied to date. In a matched case-control study, the frequencies of spontaneous abortions were compared among 1, 878 BRCA 1 mutation carriers, 950 BRCA 2 mutation carriers and 657 related non-carrier controls. The rates of spontaneous and <b>therapeutic</b> <b>abortions</b> were compared for carriers with and without breast cancer...|$|R
25|$|Chile {{has some}} of the strictest {{abortion}} laws in the world. One of the last acts of the military government under Pinochet was to outlaw abortion in all circumstances. Chile's abortion law criminalizes abortion even when it would save a pregnant woman's life. <b>Therapeutic</b> <b>abortion</b> was legal between 1931 and 1989 but is now is illegal under all circumstances. There have been proposed bills from Chilean legislators and s on abortion and reproductive rights, but they have never been passed. Estimates range between 120,000 and 160,000 for the number of Chilean women who have illegal abortions each year. Chile is considered to have one of the highest abortion rates in Latin America. Every year, nearly 40,000 teenage girls become pregnant. Emergency contraception was banned in 2008, making the distribution of emergency contraception illegal under all circumstances.|$|E
500|$|Feed Us A Fetus, the 1986 LP by Canadian thrash band Dayglo Abortions, adapted a {{photograph}} of Mr. and Mrs. Reagan [...] with the U.S. Presidential Seal in the background, adding to it is a fetus being served to the president on a plate. Earlier in his political career, Ronald Reagan had signed the <b>Therapeutic</b> <b>Abortion</b> Act six weeks into his first gubernatorial term, bringing California's statewide total of legal abortion procedures from 518 in 1967 {{to an average of}} around 100,000 annually throughout his two terms as governor—more than any other state prior to Roe vs. Wade. In 1972 Nancy Reagan make a public statement regarding her husband's decision, saying, [...] "If we accept the right to take life before birth are we so far from making the decision after birth?" [...] She went on to say, [...] "I agree with the California abortion law passed under my husband, however, I believe it has been terribly abused". By the end of the Reagans' first term in the White House, they had changed their position on abortion, and in 1986 the president addressed a joint session of Congress, saying, [...] "Today there is a wound in our national conscience. America will never be whole as long as the right to life granted by our Creator is denied to the unborn". By the 1990s, Nancy Reagan reasserted her public opinion of being [...] "somewhere in the middle" [...] in not supporting abortion while believing in women's right to choose. The Dayglo Abortions's name caused the band problems in both the United States and Canada, and the cover of Feed Us A Fetus resulted in an obscenity charge that was ultimately brought before and overturned by the Supreme Court of Canada.|$|E

2500|$|This {{right has}} {{generated}} significant case law, as abortion in Canada was legalized in R. v. Morgentaler (1988) after the Supreme Court found the <b>Therapeutic</b> <b>Abortion</b> Committees breached women's security of person by threatening their health. Some judges also felt {{control of the}} body was a right within security of the person, breached by the abortion law. In , 2013 SCC 25, however, the Supreme Court found that [...] "security of the person" [...] {{could not be used}} to justify a mother's failure to report a stillbirth.|$|E
2500|$|Reasons for {{procuring}} induced abortions {{are typically}} characterized as either therapeutic or elective. An abortion is medically {{referred to as}} a <b>therapeutic</b> <b>abortion</b> when it is performed {{to save the life of}} the pregnant woman; prevent harm to the woman's physical or mental health; terminate a pregnancy where indications are that the child will have a significantly increased chance of premature morbidity or mortality or be otherwise disabled; or to selectively reduce the number of fetuses to lessen health risks associated with multiple pregnancy. An abortion is {{referred to as a}}n elective or voluntary abortion when it is performed at the request of the woman for non-medical reasons. Confusion sometimes arises over the term [...] "elective" [...] because [...] "elective surgery" [...] generally refers to all scheduled surgery, whether medically necessary or not.|$|E

5000|$|This step {{asks whether}} the legislation’s {{limitation}} of the Charter right have a rational connection to Parliament’s objective. The means used must be carefully designed to achieve the objective. They must not be arbitrary, unfair, or based on irrational considerations. Professor Peter Hogg, who used to argue the rational connection test was redundant, continues to argue the criterion is of little use. [...] An example of the rational connection test being failed {{can be found in}} R. v. Morgentaler (1988), in which Dickson was of the opinion that laws against abortion should be struck down partly because of a breach of health rights under section 7 and an irrational connection between the objective (protecting the fetus and the pregnant woman's health), and the process by which <b>therapeutic</b> <b>abortions</b> were granted. This process was considered unfair to pregnant women requiring <b>therapeutic</b> <b>abortions,</b> because committees meant to approve abortions were not formed or took too long. (The law afterwards failed the other two proportionality criteria as well).|$|R
50|$|Following {{standard}} section 7 analysis, Dickson examined whether the violation accorded {{with the principles}} of fundamental justice. He found that it did not, as the excessive requirements prevented smaller hospitals from providing such services thus preventing many women from even applying for certification. Moreover, he found that the administrative system failed to provide adequate evaluation criteria which allowed the committees to grant or deny <b>therapeutic</b> <b>abortions</b> arbitrarily.|$|R
5000|$|According to Archbishop Jose Antonio Eguren in Peru, {{indirect}} {{abortion is}} not the same as a <b>therapeutic</b> <b>abortion.</b> Eguren asserts that indirect abortion is an extraordinary moral case which has nothing to do ‘therapeutic abortion’ in Catholic doctrine, <b>therapeutic</b> <b>abortion</b> simply does not exist, since abortion is never a cure for anything.|$|E
50|$|Section 287 (then 251) of the Criminal Code is the {{abortion}} provision drafted by Trudeau and passed in 1969. Prior to 1969, {{taking steps to}} cause an abortion was an offence liable to life imprisonment. However, the Trudeau bill made an exception for abortions performed in a hospital {{with the approval of}} that hospital’s three-doctor <b>therapeutic</b> <b>abortion</b> committee. The committee would have to certify that the pregnancy would be likely to endanger the life or health of the pregnant woman. The term health was not defined, and <b>therapeutic</b> <b>abortion</b> committees were free to develop their own theories as to when a likely danger to “health” (which might include psychological health) would justify a <b>therapeutic</b> <b>abortion.</b>|$|E

50|$|By 1982, {{there were}} 66,319 legal abortions in Canada. The 1969 law was {{interpreted}} differently by different doctors and hospitals, leading to uneven access. The standard was the {{physical or mental}} well-being of the mother, {{to be decided by}} a hospital's <b>Therapeutic</b> <b>Abortion</b> Committee. However, there was no requirement for a hospital even to have a TAC or for it to meet, and only about one-third of hospitals had one. Some committees took a very liberal stance and allowed almost all requests, while others blocked almost all requests. Access to legal abortions was easy in major metropolitan areas, but much harder outside of large cities. In the province of Prince Edward Island the lone <b>Therapeutic</b> <b>Abortion</b> Committee shut down and there were no legal abortions in the province after 1982. The <b>Therapeutic</b> <b>Abortion</b> Committees often took days or weeks to make their decisions, pushing a pregnancy further along {{than it would have been}} otherwise.
