5000|$|While the {{government}} initiated awareness-raising efforts against human rights abuses, including forced labor, committed {{by its own}} forces during the year, it made no significant efforts to prevent other forms of human trafficking. The Ministry of Human Rights drafted, but did not disseminate, a document on the country's current trafficking situation, including challenges to addressing it and recommendations for action. In July 2009, the FARDC's Goma headquarters issued a press statement reminding all soldiers and commanders of their duty to protect the civilian population and noted [...] "zero tolerance" [...] for human rights abuses, specifically citing the crime of forced labor, among others. The notice warned commanders {{that they would be}} held accountable for actions committed by troops under their command; this notice was not enforced with concrete law enforcement action. In April 2010, Major Andoga, of the 1331th Battalion, conducted a sensitization campaign on human rights violations and the military's zero tolerance policy in both Kinshasa and the eastern provinces. Although the National Ministry of Labor is responsible for investigating forced child labor and it employs 150 inspectors nationwide, the ministry did not conduct any forced child labor investigations in 2009; inspectors often lacked means of transport or resources to carry out their work. The provincial Ministry of Labor in Katanga participated in a <b>tripartite</b> <b>dialogue</b> with unions and mining companies on the effect of the financial crisis on youth labor; the dialogue achieved no meaningful outcomes. Newly established provisional Worst Forms of Child Labor Committees in Katanga, Kasai Orientale, and Orientale (Ituri District) provinces - composed of staff from various provincial ministries and community members - developed annual work plans for 2010. With UNICEF funding, the members of the Katanga committee researched, drafted, and printed a brochure on its mandate that was distributed to local authorities, religious and traditional leaders, and community organizations as part of an awareness-raising campaign. The Kasai Orientale committee met with the governor and provincial assembly, after which the governor committed the provincial government to fighting child labor and establishing secondary schools. The government did not take any known measures during the reporting period to reduce the demand for forced labor or commercial sex acts.|$|E

The representatives {{of the people of}} Burma elected in the 27 May 1990 general elections, met to discuss the drastically changed political situation in Burma and to re-organize the NCGUB into a more effective force to support Daw Aung San Suu Kyi's political initiatives in Rangoon. The Convention supported Daw Aung San Suu Kyi's call for a genuine political dialogue and called on the Secretary-General of the United Nations to implement the UN General Assembly resolution which called for him to assist in the national reconciliation process in Burma. A <b>tripartite</b> <b>dialogue</b> between the Burmese military led by SLORC; the democracy movement led by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi; and Burma's ethnic leaders; was endorsed by the elected representatives. The Convention welcomed {{the release of}} Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and thanked all who worked for her release. Daw Aung San Suu Kyi's return to politics and her determination to continue working for democracy in Burma was applauded and welcomed. The leading role played by SLORC Chairman Senior General Than Shwe in Daw Aung San Suu Kyi's release was also recognized. To give the leadership more flexibility to deal with the rapidly changing situation, the government formed by elected representatives in Manerplaw on 18 December 1990 was officially dissolved by the Convention of Elected Representatives on 21 July 1995 in Bommersvik. The Convention unanimously re-elected Dr. Sein Win by secret ballot to head the new government. The new government re-affirmed its commitment to the establishment of a multiparty parliamentary democracy within the framework of a genuine federal union. The broad-based support of the new coalition government is reflected in the make up of the cabinet. The elected representatives were joined in their deliberations by representatives from the National Council of the Union of Burma, leaders of the National League for Democracy (Liberated Area), the United Nationalities League for Democracy, the All Burma Students Democratic Front, the Federation of Trade Unions of Burma, and NCGUB representatives.

40|$|The {{importance}} of a social dialogue {{in the process of}} consolidation of domestic law with the European Union law is hereby analyzed through the issues of level of development of institutional <b>tripartite</b> <b>dialogue,</b> development of social dialogue as a prerequisite that is ahead for the countries in the process of joining European integration and the mode of consolidation of domestic labour law with the EU law. Social dialogue in the countries that have passed through or are still under the process of transition of legal order, is being developed according to relevant model of the EU countries, which have recognized the social dialogue as an efficient way of reaching compromise and preserving social peace. The key importance in our country is given to <b>tripartite</b> <b>dialogue</b> within the economic social council. The functioning of the economic social council of the Republika Srpska can be a model of social dialogue, and its role is to consolidate labour and social laws as well as other laws that are at stake for social partners, with the European Union law. At the same time, {{the subject matter of the}} dialogue in this council is wider then the issue of the law consolidation, and covers a number of other areas, corresponding to trends of development of social dialogue that is prevailing in the EU countries. On the contrary, the absence or flaws in institutional social dialogue regarding its functioning especially at the local level, and having in mind unfavorable circumstances regarding the employees' associations in private companies and forming of the council of employees, are a limiting factor to development of autonomous labour law, as a part of the process of consolidation. In the process of joining the EU, the request for consolidation of labour legislature with the EU law has come out, which includes the necessity of further providing legal prerequisites for social dialogue. The greatest problem in that process, apart from enactment of new labour law, is defining relations between the governing institutions and social partners. In our country there is a trend of constantly widening the subject of social dialogue to matters outside of regulating rights and interests of employees and employers, as well as the widening of dialogue to non-governmental sector. In the last decade, social partners are having more and more participation in the government and a growing influence to participation of the country in the process of joining European integrations, through the economic social council and other forms of institutional <b>tripartite</b> <b>dialogue,</b> which leads to the change of traditional relations between the institutions of government and representatives of employees and employers...|$|E

40|$|A {{stratified}} sample of 72 nurses, physicians {{and members of}} the general public met together in small <b>tripartite</b> <b>dialogue</b> groups each month for 20 months, in order to mutually identify health care behaviors that effectively involve patients in their own health care. Content analysis of 200 hours of verbatim transcripts from the dialogue sessions yielded 1245 patient involvement behaviors. These behaviors were rated by all subjects for their degree of importance within the normative health care relationship through use of a Likert-type inventory. Analysis of the 656 behaviors from the inventory which were classified as essential for effective patient involvement produced 44 clusters, with inter-item correlations ranging from 0. 80 to 0. 95. Further reduction of the 44 clusters indicated six core clusters, suggesting key norms that existed regarding effective involvement of patients in their own care. Salient norms centered on overt contracts in health relationships, egalitarian communication between patient and professional, patient access to broad-based information, tailoring of treatment programs, self-care and lifestyle modification. The lack of congruence between these norms and the realities of health care is discussed. patient participation in health care patient-professional relationships responsibilities in health care...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that by late 2010, the crisis which {{affected}} the new Member States was drawing to an end, its negative effects were deeply felt across the region: increased rates of unemployment and lower living standards, rising public debts, a sluggish recovery in Bulgaria, and even a double-dip recession in Slovenia. The harshest downturn since the post-socialist transformational recessions have elicited frantic negotiations among the governments, employers, and unions on how to retain jobs, rein in the public deficits, increase competitiveness and restart growth in the region.

40|$|Corporations have {{increasingly}} turned to CSR-initiatives {{in order to}} monitor workers’ rights and responsibilities in global supply chains. This article argues {{that in order for}} these CSR- initiatives to succeed in enabling workers’ voice at the workplace, the shared benefits of the practice must be realized by all stakeholders. In this article, H&M’s social dialogue project in Bangladesh has been analyzed through the lens of social practice theory identifying three crucial elements which must exist or be created, linked and sustained in order to produce behaviour change, which in this case is social dialogue between factory workers and factory management. This article argues that H&M’s social dialogue project has all the essential elements and objectives to increase workers’ voice and improve industrial relations. It also points out the importance of not viewing bipartite social dialogue as the end goal. Instead, H&M’s implementation of bipartite social dialogue at their suppliers’ factories should serve as the stepping stone toward <b>tripartite</b> social <b>dialogue</b> where trade unions can empower workers in the readymade garment-sector. The trade unions have the unique right to bargain collectively and if corporations truly want to ensure workers’ rights, they must promote increased union activity in the industry. This research describes the key activities, training methodology, objectives and expected outcomes of H&M’s social dialogue project followed by an analysis of workers employed in Bangladeshi readymade garment-sector experiences, attitudes and associations to social dialogue. By analysing workers’ associations to social dialogue and H&M’s objectives of the social dialogue project, certain conditions have been identified as crucial in order to enable efficient social dialogue at the workplace. ...|$|R

I select {{three groups of}} poor people –petty criminals, prostitutes, and {{apprentices}} –and investigate their dramatic representation in three early modern plays –The Roaring Girl, The Honest Whore, and Sir Thomas More. To overcome their representational distortion, I carry out a <b>tripartite</b> <b>dialogue</b> between documentational evidence, dramatic allusion and poetic imagination. This thesis adopts its methodology from poststructuralist historicism, but my theoretical position on Renaissance studies diverges from it in several respects, which I elucidate in the introduction. The first chapter ascertains, by scrutinizing the hermaphroditic protagonist Moll, that her cross-dressing and protean identities represent the characteristics of early modern London. The second chapter argues that early modern capitalism combined with patriarchy {{plays a crucial role}} in giving rise to prostitution by examining the courtesan protagonist, Bellafront. The third chapter, which analyzes the 1517 Ill May Day apprentice riots {{in the context of the}} 1590 s London crisis, traces there presentational history of the popular insurgency and retrieves ideological implication from the early modern censorial regime.

40|$|What is {{the role}} played by {{collective}} bargaining in the regulation of the labour market in the context of European integration? What are the current developments in that role? Building on research conducted in the fifteen countries of the European Union since 1998, this article examines the contention that recent developments in collective bargaining in the member states of the European Union represent an innovation in the joint regulation of the labour market. The notion of joint regulation is defined in reference to Reynaud (1989, 2001), as sets of rules jointly defined by unions, employers and, in some cases, public authorities, as well as the processes by which these rules are created, transformed or suppressed. The issue of regulation of employment refers to bipartite or tripartite decisions on one or several of the major dimensions of the labour market: number of jobs, working hours, conditions of the access to the labour market, conditions for retirement, workforce flows in the labour market. In order to highlight recent trends in bargaining and concertation on employment in Europe, the article proposes an analytical framework that addresses three questions. First, are there currently in European countries tripartite bargaining processes of a national scope dealing with employment? Secondly, to what extent are there bipartite collective bargaining processes dealing with employment? Finally, are there different forms of joint regulation of the labour market and, if so, what are they? The article then examines recent national developments in terms of tripartite and bipartite bargaining on employment, and differentiates the forms adopted by these processes of joint regulation of the labour market {{at the end of the}} 1990 s in the European Union. Four types of joint regulation are identified. The first type refers to national situations where there is tripartite concertation of employment policies at national level as well as bilateral negotiation at lower levels. In these situations, it follows that the social partners contribute both to the determination of employment policies and to employment measures that are negotiated in branches, regions and companies. In these cases, there is real co-responsibility for the labour market as described by Freyssinet and Seifert (1999), in which employment measures and their implementation are handed over jointly to governments, employers and unions. A second type corresponds to countries in which the government and the social partners meet to determine together key aspects of employment policies, without the issue of employment necessarily being addressed in bilateral negotiations at industry or enterprise levels. In the third type, there is no tripartite bargaining on the tabour market, but industry and enterprise-level negotiators include the volume of tabour in the issues that they negotiate. Finally, in the fourth situation, employment as such does not figure in the programmes of <b>tripartite</b> <b>dialogue</b> or in bilateral agreements, and the tabour market is therefore not directly regulated by joint policies and agreements. In conclusion, it is asked to what extent are these joint regulation processes original? It is argued that they are innovative in several ways. First, they initiate specific solutions that seek to organize a rapidly changing tabour market within a converging European context, distinct national industrial systems and particular tabour market characteristics. Secondly, they reflect a stronger co-ordination between bargaining levels, resulting in guidelines that lead to a series of negotiations at industry and at company levels. Thirdly, they reflect a growing interdependency between public authorities and social partners and, consequently, between the respective fields of public policies for employment and collective bargaining. Finally, they favour multidimensional agreements, including indirect measures intended to increase the number of jobs and participation rates, while many questions concerning their impact, for instance on the quality of work, remain unanswered. These new processes of joint regulation do not, however, change fundamentally the institutional industrial relations systems as these latter retain their key characteristics within each national context...|$|E

30|$|Decentralisation {{has been}} the main trend in {{industrial}} relations since the 1980 s—reversing the long-term trend of previous decades, which reached its apex during the energy and currency upheavals of the 1970 s when many countries tried to respond to wage cost pressures with incomes policies based on central agreements and tripartite social pacts (Addison 1981; Armingeon 1982; Flanagan et al. 1983). Central, cross-industry wage agreements ended in the late 1970 s or early 1980 s in Austria, Denmark, the Netherlands, Spain and Sweden, some time later in Norway and, {{in the form of}} central award setting, in New Zealand and Australia in the 1990 s. They continued in Finland, Belgium and Greece, usually with much help or pressure from the government. Tripartite social pacts and agreements became the format for wage setting in Ireland from 1987 to 2009, during some years in the 1980 s and 1990 s in Portugal, from 1994 in Slovenia and from 2005 in Romania. There never were central wage agreements in Germany, Switzerland, the UK, Canada, the USA, Japan and the other non-European countries. The UK went through a phase of union-government ‘social contract’ bargaining in the 1970 s, and there were similar social pacts in Australia in the 1980 s, in South Korea during the Asian crisis (1997) and in Chile after the end of dictatorship in 1990. There were sparse pacts in CEE and the <b>tripartite</b> social <b>dialogue</b> over the national minimum wage, introduced in many CEE countries during or after transition, sometimes served as an Ersatz for wage negotiations based on bargaining power of employers and unions. Political and social considerations were often preponderant, but employers could retaliate by not complying and payment below the minimum or re-arranging employment contracts in works contracts outside the scope of minimum wage laws was a widespread practice (EC 2004).|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} in the field of development aid persuasively problematises aid relationships and begins to reveal their significance for the real-life application and effectiveness of international development cooperation. Until insights from such research percolate through aid machineries such as the OECD DAC and its workings, the country-level consequences of universal aid frameworks and prescriptions will continue to be insufficiently foreseen, and in some cases unexpectedly problematic. This paper is about an in-depth, qualitative study of the application of the Paris Declaration (PD) on Aid Effectiveness in Colombia. This middle-income, non aid-dependent country with a prolonged and complex internal armed conflict and a poor human rights record, hitherto on the margins of international aid circles, has fast assumed a high-profile role in them via its adoption of the PD. The study stemmed from a conviction that PD application in Colombia has unanticipated consequences, with under-appreciated impacts on the strategies of donors and social actors. Donors are subject to an attempt to push them (back) into a technocratic corner. In this politically complex context where donors’ presence owes at least as much to concerns over Colombia’s international human rights performance as to classic aid donor concerns with widespread extreme poverty, this is worrying and undesirable. It also has serious implications for the <b>tripartite</b> aid <b>dialogue</b> process established in 2003, involving Government, donors and social actors. This, for all its flaws and frustrations, is unique and important in a historic context of polarised, antagonistic and violent relationships between the state and left-wing advocates of human rights and social democratic principles. It will require skilful and opportunistic responses by both donors and social organisations to turn this conjuncture to their favour, in the sense of strengthening their leverage on the Government in relation to human rights, poverty, conflict and democratic governance...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the final}} version of the article. Available from the {{publisher}} via the DOI in this record. The use of health technology assessment (HTA) to inform policy-making is established in most developed countries. Compared to licensing agencies, HTA agencies have different interests and, therefore, different evidence requirements. Criteria for coverage or reimbursement decisions on pharmaceutical compounds vary; however, it is common to include, as part of the HTA, a comparative effectiveness evaluation. This type of clinical data might go beyond that required for market authorization, thus creating an additional evidence gap between the regulatory and the reimbursement submission. The relevance of submissions to HTA agencies is consistently increasing in a pharmaceutical company's perspective, as market prospects are strongly influenced by third-party payers' coverage. In this study, we aim to describe current HTA activities with a potential impact throughout the drug development process of pharmaceuticals, with a comparative emphasis on the systems in place in Italy and in the UK. Based on an extensive literature and website review, we identified three major classes of HTA activities, beyond mainstream HTA, with the potential to influence the drug development program: 1) horizon scanning and early HTA; 2) bipartite and <b>tripartite</b> early <b>dialogue</b> between manufacturers, regulators, and HTA assessors; and 3) managed market entry agreements. From early stages of clinical research up to postauthorization studies, there is a trend toward increased collaboration between parties, anticipation of market access evidence collection, and postmarketing risk-sharing. Heterogeneity of HTA practices increases the complexity of the market access environment. Overall, there are signals that market access departments are gaining importance in the pharmaceutical companies, but there is still a lack of evidence and reporting on how the increasing relevance of HTA has reshaped the way clinical development is designed and managed...|$|R
40|$|The Labour Code of Georgia has provoked, {{since its}} {{adoption}} in 2006, controversial discussions {{in the country}} and in the international community. On the one hand, this reform has been contested for the lack of <b>tripartite</b> social <b>dialogue,</b> and for the extent of deregulation which reduced the labour law to 56 articles in total. Critical comments expressed by the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the European Union (EU) were not taken into consideration. On the other hand, the Georgian government, with support from the World Bank, has presented this reform as a model for other countries in transition to the market economy. The objective of this note is to review the Labour Code of Georgia with specific focus on employment protection legislation (EPL) from international and comparative perspectives. The main references used are ILO standards, EPL indicators of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the labour law of selected jurisdictions. The assessment of the labour law of Georgia in this note does not pretend to be comprehensive. For instance, the regulation of freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining is not examined, as since 2006, the ILO Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations (CEACR) has provided extensive comments on the Labour Code of Georgia on these issues. The legal review of the Labour Code of Georgia in this note is complemented with some economic data, such as rates of unemployment and self-employment, wages, the growth of gross domestic product (GDP) and foreign direct investments in the country.

Compared to licensing agencies, HTA agencies have different interests and, therefore, different evidence requirements. Criteria for coverage or reimbursement decisions on pharmaceutical compounds vary; however, {{it is common}} to include, as part of the HTA, a comparative effectiveness evaluation. This type of clinical data might go beyond that required for market authorization, thus creating an additional evidence gap between the regulatory and the reimbursement submission. The relevance of submissions to HTA agencies is consistently increasing in a pharmaceutical company’s perspective, as market prospects are strongly influenced by third-party payers’ coverage. In this study, we aim to describe current HTA activities with a potential impact throughout the drug development process of pharmaceuticals, with a comparative emphasis on the systems in place in Italy and in the UK. Based on an extensive literature and website review, we identified three major classes of HTA activities, beyond mainstream HTA, with the potential to influence the drug development program: 1) horizon scanning and early HTA; 2) bipartite and <b>tripartite</b> early <b>dialogue</b> between manufacturers, regulators, and HTA assessors; and 3) managed market entry agreements. From early stages of clinical research up to postauthorization studies, there is a trend toward increased collaboration between parties, anticipation of market access evidence collection, and postmarketing risk-sharing. Heterogeneity of HTA practices increases the complexity of the market access environment. Overall, there are signals that market access departments are gaining importance in the pharmaceutical companies, but there is still a lack of evidence and reporting on how the increasing relevance of HTA has reshaped the way clinical development is designed and managed.
