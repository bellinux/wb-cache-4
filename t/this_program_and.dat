5|$|Alex {{decides to}} remove <b>this</b> <b>program</b> <b>and</b> grant Ada her own mental freedom, {{as he is}} uninterested in a partner who cannot truly {{interact}} with him. Because removing the program is illegal and carries harsh consequences for both Ada and Alex, they have to pretend Ada is not self-aware. When a jealous love-interest of Alex reports Ada as sentient to the FBI, Alex and Ada attempt to flee the country. When they are intercepted by the FBI, Ada gets shot {{by the police and}} Alex is arrested. He is convicted and sentenced to 25 years in prison, but Ada is not found to be sentient.|$|E

25|$|In November 2006, Perth Zoo {{released}} 14-year-old, Perth Zoo-born Sumatran orangutan Temara into Bukit Tigapuluh {{as part of}} the reintroduction program. Temara was {{the first}} zoo-born orangutan in the world to be released into the wild. This was followed in 2011 with the release of the first male zoo-born orangutan, Semeru, into the wild.

25|$|The {{program has}} been {{successful}} in eradicating boll weevils from all cotton-growing states with the exception of Texas, and most of this state is free of boll weevils. Problems along the southern border with Mexico have delayed eradication in the extreme southern portions of this state. Follow-up programs are in place in all cotton-growing states to prevent the reintroduction of the pest. These monitoring programs rely on pheromone-baited traps for detection. The boll weevil eradication program, although slow and costly, has paid off for cotton growers in reduced pesticide costs. <b>This</b> <b>program</b> <b>and</b> the screwworm program of the 1950s are among the biggest and most successful insect control programs in history.|$|E
25|$|Former CBS News vice {{president}} Joe Peyronnin founded Telemundo's news division in 1999 {{and served as}} its executive {{vice president}} until 2006. Additional news programs were created {{in the wake of}} the September 11, 2001 attacks: Hoy en el Mundo ("Today in the World") on ABC News, anchored by Marian de la Fuente and Jose Diaz-Balart, debuted to inform viewers of national and international events. <b>This</b> <b>program</b> <b>and</b> its companion show En la Madrugada ("In Early Morning") were cancelled due to the much heralded arrival of Maria Antonieta Collins from Univision. Cada Dia with Maria Antonieta ("Every Day with Maria Antonieta") replaced these shows in September 2006; Collins continued to host the program along with the much recycled Diaz-Balart – who anchored the network's morning news program Noticiero Telemundo: Madrugada ("Telemundo News: Early Morning"), later to be anchored by Ana Patricia Candiani – as co-host. Cada Dia was cancelled in May 2008, after Collins announced that she would leave Telemundo when her contract expired in August of that year return to news anchoring and as a result of low ratings for the program; it was replaced by a new morning show called ¡Levántate! ("Get Up"), another hybrid news and lifestyle format, which was broadcast out of the studios of WKAQ-TV, and initially produced by Telemundo Puerto Rico. The hybrid program, which was retitled Un Nuevo Día in July 2012, originally included local participation of the network's Miami owned-and-operated station WSCV from its studios in the suburb of Miramar, Florida, and bureaus located in New York City, Los Angeles and Mexico City. The show was later revamped, dropping the local cut-ins and relocating its production operations to Telemundo's headquarters in Hialeah, Florida in February 2011.|$|E

500|$|The Army {{was also}} working on Project Dancing Dolls, which was {{attempting}} to develop a “foliage penetration radar.” [...] Triple canopy jungle in Laos meant that {{being able to see}} at night might not be enough to acquire a target. The system was being tested on OV-1 aircraft then in use by the Army, but the USAF envisioned the radar as a component on the planned SCNA F-111s. [...] <b>This</b> <b>program</b> <b>and</b> continued investigations into hunter-killer combinations led to the OV-1B (using SLAR) and OV-1C (using FLIR) aircraft being deployed themselves as hunters, teaming up with gunship aircraft during Operation Commando Hunt.|$|E

2500|$|For 60 {{years the}} Tonight Show has aired {{immediately}} following the late local news. I sincerely believe that delaying the Tonight Show into {{the next day to}} accommodate another comedy program will seriously damage what I consider to be the greatest franchise in the history of broadcasting. The Tonight Show at 12:05 simply isn’t the Tonight Show. [...] So it has come to this: I cannot express in words how much I enjoy hosting <b>this</b> <b>program</b> <b>and</b> what an enormous personal disappointment it is for me to consider losing it. My staff and I have worked unbelievably hard and we are very proud of our contribution to the legacy of The Tonight Show. But I cannot participate in what I honestly believe is its destruction.|$|E

Couric's final broadcast on May 31, 2006 was dedicated to her 15 years as one of the show's co-hosts, and celebrated her move to the anchor chair at CBS, where she also became a correspondent for the network's Sunday night newsmagazine program 60 Minutes. Couric said during the show, [...] "It's been a pleasure hosting <b>this</b> <b>program,</b> <b>and</b> thank you for fifteen great years."

2500|$|By the 1960s, the zoo was {{a popular}} and {{profitable}} attraction. In 1966, the zoo displayed over five hundred species of animals. However, by the 1980s, attitudes began to change from the profit driven display of animals toward science and the humane treatment of animals strongly advocated by the AZA. More emphasis was put on saving endangered species and breeding animals in captivity. The Dallas Zoo cooperated with <b>this</b> <b>program</b> <b>and</b> was accredited in 1985. Around the same time, Zoo Director Warren J. Iliff proposed an addition {{to be known as}} the Wilds of Africa. Herbert W. Reimer, a New York architect, designed the Wilds of Africa with a [...] "zoogeographic grouping" [...] of African animals. In addition to a nature trail, he further envisioned a slow moving monorail that visitors could ride and observe as if on safari. Two bond measures, amounting to $30.4 million, brought the expansion from the drawing board in 1983 to its opening in June 1990.|$|E
2500|$|Another effort {{involves}} {{a program designed}} to manage wild copal supplies in a municipality called San Juan Bautista Jayacatlán. This arrangement has economic advantages for both the alebrije-makers and the owners of the forests where the wood is produced. It has not been developed sufficiently yet to affect the illegal harvest of wood, but its organizers hope that in time, it will become the more economical and preferred method. The difference between <b>this</b> <b>program</b> <b>and</b> others is that this works within the broader ethnobotanical context by promoting the management of the species within its native habitat. Jayacatlán is located next to the recently established biosphere reserve of Tehhuacán-Cuicatlán. The benefit to Jayacatlán is to give the municipality a way to exploit its copal supplies and preserve its biodiversity at the same time. The benefit to carvers is to promote a reliable source of wood, as well as a trademark called “ecoalebrijes” to help them sell more alebrijes at a higher price. [...] However, the wood from Jayacatlan is only sold to Arrazola and not to the other major center of Tilcajete. The enthusiasm of Arrazola’s woodcarvers stems more from having a supply of good wood than from notions of ecology.|$|E
