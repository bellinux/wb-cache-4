5|$|Although {{she writes}} under the pen name J. K. Rowling (pronounced rolling), her name, before her remarriage, was simply Joanne Rowling. Anticipating that <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>audience</b> of young boys {{might not want}} to read a book written by a woman, her {{publishers}} asked that she use two initials rather than her full name. As she had no middle name, she chose K (for Kathleen) as the second initial of her pen name, from her paternal grandmother. She calls herself Jo. Following her remarriage, she has sometimes used the name Joanne Murray when conducting personal business. During the Leveson Inquiry she gave evidence under the name of Joanne Kathleen Rowling and her entry in Who's Who lists her name also as Joanne Kathleen Rowling.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{providing}} thematic consistency with the original, {{the repetition of}} iconography also acted as a vital marketing tool. The marketing of the album was documented in an episode of the 1995 BBC television programme The Music Biz. Executives at Virgin Records {{thought that this was}} important to attract <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>audience,</b> who they believed no longer spent much time in record shops. They felt that similarities to the design of the first album, including Meat Loaf's name in Gothic typography, would entice consumers of the 1977 album to purchase this.The section from this episode about the marketing of Bat Out of Hell II, and the filming of this music video, has been reshown as part of BBC Learning Zone's media studies strand.|$|E

5|$|Since the 2002 {{publication}} of The Rise of the Creative Class, Florida has enjoyed academic and commercial success {{in his study}} and promotion {{of the concept of}} a creative class, or a cohort of highly innovative, highly creative individuals who are sought after by businesses. Who's Your City?, Florida's fourth book on the subject, combines scholarly research with a lighthearted self-help tone. Some critics questioned the assumption that <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>audience,</b> those easily able to move, would consult the book for advice on moving, but also found the book provides a valuable insight into the impacts of locational choices on the urbanized world.|$|E
5|$|Hsu {{described}} the localization {{work as a}} balancing act, and said that continuity and consistency was very important. To avoid situations where a small detail in one game is changed in localization, and then comes back as a major point in a sequel, Hsu avoided changing things unless necessary, such as when something in the original would not be understood by <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>audience.</b> One thing the localization team had {{to keep in mind}} was keeping the writing in-character: when substituting a Japanese joke with an English one, they had to consider whether it would be something that the character would say, and not simply that it was funny. They also worked towards having puns and references be appropriate for the dialogue, so that the dialogue still makes sense to players who do not get the reference or pun.|$|E
5|$|The {{localization}} of {{the game}} was outsourced to a company called Bowne Global, and was handled by writer Alexander O. Smith, who was {{not familiar with the}} Ace Attorney series prior to working on it, and editor Steve Anderson. While the Japanese version {{of the game}} takes place in Japan, the localized version is set in the United States. They would normally have left the setting vague while adapting cultural differences that <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>audience</b> would not understand, but because one of the episodes involves time zones, they had to specify where the game takes place, and chose the United States without thinking a lot about it. This became an issue in later games, where the Japanese setting was more obvious. All the voice roles in the localized version of the game were handled by localization staff; Takumi had wanted to do the English voice for Phoenix, but it was handled by Ben Judd.|$|E

5|$|The {{settings}} for {{the stories are}} primarily high fantasy worlds, with the producers opting not to use a dark or science fiction-based setting. An exception is Xillia 2, which mostly {{took place in a}} modern setting, and explored darker themes than usual. This direction was confirmed as a one-off experiment for the series. The main characters {{play a key role in}} the Tales games, as it is partially through them that the main theme of each entry is depicted. For Abyss, it was decided to take a risk and create an unorthodox protagonist that would be initially unlikable. For Vesperia, the team opted to raise the age limit of <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>audience,</b> showing this in the game by making the main protagonist a more mature type. A female main protagonist was included for the first time in Xillia in the form of Milla Maxwell alongside male protagonist Jude Mathis, although at the time it was stated that there were no solid plans to create a game with a single female protagonist. A sole main female character, called Velvet, was eventually included in Berseria. The way the characters interact with each other during the narrative forms one of the core aspects of designing each game. Another main priority is for players to see a part of themselves in the characters.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the needs of four {{potential}} <b>target</b> <b>audiences</b> that would be using the Utah Botanical Center (UBC) for educational purposes. <b>The</b> <b>target</b> <b>audiences</b> included school children, college students, nursery and landscape industry, and the general public. The UBC is relocating to a larger site that has wetlands and ponds. The UBC has taken this opportunity to define its mission and goals. Part of its mission is to broaden its educational programming from horticulture based to programming including natural resource conservation topics. This study provides recommendations regarding what educational topics should be covered at the UBC for <b>the</b> different <b>target</b> <b>audiences,</b> and what facilities might be necessary to advance this educational programming. In addition, this study reviews natural resource topics being covered at other botanical institutions, nature centers, and water conservation groups. The process for determining the needs of <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>audiences</b> began with <b>the</b> selection of representatives from <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>audiences.</b> Data was gathered through group meetings, personal interviews, and completion of questionnaires in which representatives from <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>audiences</b> were asked to fill out matrixes about specific topics and reply to open-ended questions. The matrixes asked for information about education topics and facilities, and the questions asked for information regarding the planning process. Data compiled from these matrixes was then analyzed to determine what topics these <b>target</b> <b>audiences</b> found to be important and what facilities they felt would be useful in the education process. Data was also gathered from horticulture and nature centers and water conservation organizations through phone interviews and requests for brochures from their educational programs. The questions asked through the phone interviews determined the facilities being used at these institutions and also solicited suggestions for planning educational programming. The requested brochures provided information about the education topics being covered at these institutions. This data was placed into matrixes that showed the topics and <b>the</b> <b>audiences</b> being <b>targeted.</b> <b>The</b> analyzed data from <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>audiences,</b> horticulture and nature centers, and water conservation organizations was then used to make recommendations for facilities and programming at the UBC. Recommendations were provided for each <b>target</b> <b>audience</b> for both topics and facilities. The topics that were recommended to the UBC included water resource management, water conservation, storm water management, wetland ecology, native plants, urban wildlife habitat, fish and wildlife habitat, composting, integrated pest management, residential landscape design, and landscape legacy. The facilities that were recommended included classrooms, an auditorium, hands-on demonstration areas, outdoor lecture facilities, and interpretive trails. In summary, it was recommended that the UBC focus on school children first for educational programming. It is also advised that they start out with a small high-quality program that is expandable. Good quality programing is important to ensure that <b>target</b> <b>audiences</b> return to visit the UBC...|$|R
