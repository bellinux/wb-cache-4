25|$|Because {{as early}} as the Torah's {{transcription}} the Scribe has been the highest position in Judaism, Hebrew was always regarded as <b>the</b> <b>language</b> <b>of</b> <b>Israel's</b> religion, history and national pride, and after it faded as a spoken language, it continued {{to be used as a}} lingua franca among scholars and Jews traveling in foreign countries. After the 2nd century CE when the Roman Empire exiled most of the Jewish population of Jerusalem following the Bar Kokhba revolt, they adapted to the societies in which they found themselves, yet letters, contracts, commerce, science, philosophy, medicine, poetry, and laws continued to be written mostly in Hebrew, which adapted by borrowing and inventing terms.|$|R

2500|$|The exact {{roles of}} Aramaic and Hebrew remain hotly debated. A trilingual {{scenario}} {{has been proposed}} for the land <b>of</b> <b>Israel.</b> Hebrew functioned as the local mother tongue with powerful ties to Israel's history, origins, and golden age and as <b>the</b> <b>language</b> <b>of</b> <b>Israel's</b> religion; Aramaic functioned as <b>the</b> international <b>language</b> with <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> the Middle East; and eventually Greek functioned as another international <b>language</b> with <b>the</b> eastern areas of the Roman Empire. According to another summary, Greek was <b>the</b> <b>language</b> <b>of</b> government, Hebrew <b>the</b> <b>language</b> <b>of</b> prayer, study and religious texts, and Aramaic was <b>the</b> <b>language</b> <b>of</b> legal contracts and trade. There was also a geographic pattern: according to Spolsky, {{by the beginning of}} the Common Era, [...] "Judeo-Aramaic was mainly used in Galilee in the north, Greek was concentrated in the former colonies and around governmental centers, and Hebrew monolingualism continued mainly in the southern villages of Judea." [...] In other words, [...] "in terms of dialect geography, at the time of the tannaim Palestine could be divided into the Aramaic-speaking regions of Galilee and Samaria and a smaller area, Judaea, in which Rabbinic Hebrew was used among the descendants of returning exiles." [...] In addition, it has been surmised that Koine Greek was the primary vehicle of communication in coastal cities and among the upper class of Jerusalem, while Aramaic was prevalent in the lower class of Jerusalem, but not in the surrounding countryside. After the suppression of the Bar Kokhba revolt in the 2nd century CE, Judaeans were forced to disperse. Many relocated to Galilee, so most remaining native speakers of Hebrew at that last stage would have been found in the north.|$|R

25|$|In the Modern Period, {{from the}} 19th century onward, the {{literary}} Hebrew tradition revived as <b>the</b> spoken <b>language</b> <b>of</b> modern <b>Israel,</b> called variously Israeli Hebrew, Modern Israeli Hebrew, Modern Hebrew, New Hebrew, Israeli Standard Hebrew, Standard Hebrew, and so on.

50|$|The Israeli {{population}} is a linguistically and culturally diverse community. The 19th edition of Ethnologue lists 35 languages and dialects spoken in local communities.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{examining}} Modern Hebrew conflict and military terminology – <b>the</b> <b>language</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israel</b> Defense Forces (IDF). Described by many Israelis as “a <b>language</b> within <b>the</b> language”, it must necessarily possess an identity {{of its own}} through special characteristics. On this basis, the major ambition of this thesis has been to identify the special “fingerprint” of the army speak in Israel – both in regard to technical or grammatical aspects, {{as well as the}} practical use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>language.</b> <b>The</b> reader also gets an insight in other various aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>language</b> within <b>the</b> military establishment and the security and intelligence community. This includes the current status <b>of</b> <b>the</b> professional <b>language</b> in <b>the</b> armed forces, in regard to efforts made to establish a common strategic, operational and tactical <b>language.</b> <b>The</b> <b>language</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> IDF and its predecessors has developed under almost continuous armed conflicts, starting during the first waves of Jewish immigrants over a century ago. The focus on Hebrew education has been strong due to operational factors, but it has also been a central pillar in the civil-military relations for decades. With limited influence from other <b>languages,</b> <b>the</b> <b>language</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> IDF has developed characteristics of its own, compared to the daily Hebrew used in the civil society. The major characteristics found are the extensive use of acronyms, a generous use of slang and, to a less degree, the integration of loanwords. Additionally, there are minor factors, like IDF’s traditional use of numbers and naming of military material. This thesis claims that the IDF experienced problems with the implementation of a common professional <b>language</b> in <b>the</b> post-modern period of RMA, EBO and network-centric warfare. A {{part of the reason is}} the IDF officer education, their non-academic approach in general and dislike of learning material not found in Hebrew. An imprecise and unclear language has led to poor performance in the field, as in the Second Lebanon war in 2006. Today, the IDF have initiated efforts to meet the problems identified. In some areas, like the use <b>of</b> a clear <b>language</b> when issuing orders and coordination between different arms, there are indicators of improvement. In other areas, like the establishment of a common professional <b>language</b> within <b>the</b> IDF, it is far too early to make conclusions, as it is likely to require continuous efforts over a long period of time...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with Algerian Jewish Sign <b>Language</b> (AJSL) and <b>the</b> Algerian Jewish Sign Language community. AJSL developed naturally in the Jewish quarter of Ghardaia, a town in the sub-Saharan part of Algeria. A high percentage of deaf people lived in this quarter, {{and because of that}} a sign language emerged, and was used by both deaf and hearing members of the community. Many members of the AJSL community migrated to Israel {{in the middle of the}} twentieth century, where they have continued to use AJSL with friends and family members. As a result, AJSL has persisted alongside <b>the</b> dominant sign <b>language</b> <b>of</b> <b>Israel,</b> which is Israeli Sign Language (ISL). This thesis uses data collected from nine members of the AJSL community to explore the sociolinguistic conditions of the AJSL community prior to, and following, the migration of AJSL community members to Israel. It considers how AJSL was used in Ghardaia, and how it has persisted in Israel alongside ISL, which is more prevalent and socially more powerful. The research participants shared narratives on life in Ghardaia and life in Israel, and were also asked about their attitudes towards AJSL and ISL. Specific recurring themes have been identified in their narratives, and these are used to build up a picture of the AJSL community in Ghardaia and <b>Israel.</b> Analysis <b>of</b> these data shows that, once in Israel, AJSL and Algerian culture were perceived negatively by the mainstream Deaf community in Israel, and so AJSL was relegated to the status <b>of</b> a minority <b>language,</b> used only with friends and family members. Deaf Algerian immigrants began to learn ISL, and used this more in public, but hearing Algerian immigrants had no motivation to learn ISL, and remained sign-monolingual in AJSL. For this study, just under 300 lexical items have been elicited from AJSL users in order to compare the lexica of AJSL and ISL. Lexical comparison suggests that AJSL has retained its own distinct lexical items over the past 60 years, and in this respect AJSL has been remarkably persistent. In light of the narratives shared by research participants, it is concluded here that the persistence <b>of</b> AJSL in <b>Israel</b> can be attributed to two main factors: its importance as a means of communication between deaf and hearing family members, and its rejection by the dominant community, the ISL users. In spite of the remarkable persistence of AJSL, however, it is clear that AJSL is an endangered language, since intergenerational transmission <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>language</b> has all but ceased. This thesis presents evidence to suggest that AJSL is a moribund <b>language,</b> on <b>the</b> grounds not only of intergenerational transmission, but also the relocation and dispersal of the AJSL community, the size of the AJSL community, contact with ISL, and the low status of AJSL in the period immediately following migration to <b>Israel.</b> The study <b>of</b> AJSL is interesting for many reasons. First, AJSL has characteristics both similar to and different from other village sign languages, and may shed light on the development and structure <b>of</b> such <b>languages.</b> Second, AJSL is unique as a sign language that has persisted in Israel, alongside a widely used sign <b>language,</b> where <b>the</b> sign <b>languages</b> <b>of</b> other immigrant communities have long since disappeared. The case is made in this thesis for the importance <b>of</b> documenting AJSL; <b>language</b> documentation is crucial, given that AJSL is now used only by older generations, and no longer acquired by younger generations...|$|R

The paper aims {{to provide}} a succinct {{introduction}} to Semitic studies. The name "Semitic" derives from Shem or Sem, Noah 2 ̆ 7 s eldest son, from whom most of the Semits were said to descend. It is believed that Semitic languages evolved from hypothetical proto-Semitic. The place of origin of proto-Semitic is disputed: Africa, Arabia and Mesopotamia are possible locations. Unique to Semitic is a triconsonantal root, which carries the basic meaning. Superimposed is a pattern of vowels (or vowels and consonants), indicating variations in meaning or serving in inflection. Another feature is that related consonants typically fall into three subtypes: voiced, unvoiced and emphatic. <b>The</b> Semitic <b>languages</b> are closely interrelated − {{about as much as}} Slavic, Germanic or Romanic. Semitic divides into three groups: I. Northeast or East Semitic; 2. Northwest or West Semitic; 3. Southwest or South Semitic. East Semitic includes only Akkadian, the oldest attested Semitic language. Akkadian is known from cuneiform texts and was spoken in Mesopotamia between cca 3000 BC and 100 CE, but remained in written usage until the 2 nd- 3 rd century CE. From cca 2000 BC, two dialects developed: Babylonian in the south and Assyrian in the north (both succeeded by Aramaic in the 6 th century BC). The main differences between East and Northwest (West) Semitic are in the verb system. Northwest Semitic includes: 1. Amorite and Ugaritic, 2. Canaanite and 3. Aramaic. Also, some twenty years ago, another language was found at the site of Elba, south of Aleppo in Syria. Passages in this language were interspersed with Sumerian texts from cca 2400 BC. Although heavily influenced by Akkadian, Eblaite shows similarities to Northwest Semitic. Amorite is a general term for a <b>language</b> attested from <b>the</b> first half of the 2 nd millennium BC by proper nouns inserted into Akkadian and Egyptian texts. The first Amorites were probably nomads. Ugaritic appears to be an early form of Canaanite. It was spoken and written in Ugarit (Ras Shamra) on the north coast of Phoenicia in the 14 - 13 th centuries BC, before this city was sacked. The first Ugaritic texts, discovered in the late 19202 ̆ 7 s, were written with alphabetic characters resembling cuneiform script. Canaanite constitutes a group of closely-related idioms from Palestina, Phoenicia and Syria. Records go back to cca 1500 BC. <b>The</b> major Canaanite <b>languages</b> are Phoenician, Punic, Moabite, Edomite, Hebrew and Ammonite. Initially all were written in Phoenician script. Letters from the 14 th century BC in Akkadian, <b>the</b> <b>language</b> <b>of</b> diplomacy at <b>the</b> time and discovered at Tell el-Amarna in Egypt, contain "mistakes", i. e. early Canaanite words and phrases. Phoenician records extend from cca 1000 BC (inscriptions from Lebanon, Syria, Israel, Cypms, etc.) to the early CE. Punic, developed from Phoenician in Phoenician colonies around the Mediterranean from the 9 th century BC., was still spoken in the 5 th century CE. Moabite, Edomite and Ammonite were spoken in present-day Jordan. Only a few short inscriptions and seals from the 9 - 5 th century BC survive in these languages, which were probably supplanted by Aramaic. The best-known text, in Moabite, is inscribed on the Mesha Stone from about 840 BC; in it Mesha, King of Moab, recounts his battles against King Omri <b>of</b> <b>Israel.</b> Aramaic is recorded from 850 BC in Syria (the Tell Fekheriye stele). It spread very quickly and by the 6 th century BC it was <b>the</b> administrative <b>language</b> and lingua franca in the entire Middle East. Aramaic supplanted many Semitic languages, including Akkadian and Hebrew. Only Greek rivaled it for dominance in the Middle East until the Arab conquest of the 7 th century CE. Aramaic of the pre-Christian era (Ancient Aramaic or Imperial Aramaic) is known from inscriptions, papyrus letters and documents, and from the Old Testament books of Ezra and Daniel. The Aramaic alphabet was derived from Canaanite script. By the 1 st century CE, written Aramaic divided into different forms based on the various types of script adopted by different religions. West Aramaic includes Nabataean, Palmyrene, Aramaic of Hatra, Jewish Palestinian Aramaic (or Galilean Aramaic), Samaritan Aramaic and Christian Palestine Aramaic (Palestinian Syriac). The inhabitants of the Nabataean kingdom (Petra and surroundings in south Jordan), Palmyra (Tadmor in northeast Syria) and Hatra (el-Hadr in nmih Iraq) were mainly Arabs, but from 100 BC to 350 CE they wrote in Aramaic, in their own variant scripts. Classical or Biblical Hebrew, known mainly from the Old Testament, was used in texts from a period of cca 1, 000 years. The earliest known Hebrew inscription, the Gezer Calendar, dates from cca 925 BC. Hebrew was first written in the Canaanite-Phoenician alphabet, but in the 4 th century BC the Jews adopted from Aramaic the square alphabet still used. By the 3 rd century BC Hebrew was spoken only in Judaea, and even there in form known as Mishnaic. Yet <b>the</b> <b>language</b> was maintained by Jews down the centuries as a sacred language and was resurrected (with modifications) in the 20 th century as <b>the</b> official <b>language</b> <b>of</b> <b>Israel.</b> <b>The</b> Southwest, or South Semitic includes: 1. South Arabian, 2. Arabic and 3. <b>the</b> Ethiopian <b>languages.</b> South Arabian is attested by ancient inscriptions and by living vernaculars in present-day Yemen and Oman. The South Arabian alphabet derived from the Canaanite script, brought to the area about 1300 BC from the North Arabia. South Arabian inscriptions (epitaphs, promises and deeds) date from 700 BC to 500 CE. <b>The</b> <b>language</b> comprised several dialects, e. g. Sabaean, Minaean (or Ma 2 ̆ 7 in), Qatabanian and Hadramauth. The modern South Arabian languages are not written and are giving way to Arabic. Best known are Mahr, Awr and Soqotr, spoken by less than one hundred thousand people. The precursors of Arabic proper were the idioms spoken by the tribes of Dedan, Liyn, Thamd and Saf. Thousands of short petroglyphs and graffiti have survived from the period 700 BC - 400 CE. The oldest Arabic texts in a script derived from the Nabataean alphabet date from the 4 th century CE. The cradle of Arabic lies in the North Arabia. It first made its mark as a literary language with pre-Islamic poetry and the Quran, and these sources have remained universal ideals. With the rise of lslam, Arabic rapidly spread over an area from Persia and Asia Minor to the Atlantic Ocean, Spain and the Sahara. Relatively few Arabs emigrated, but the inhabitants of the countries they conquered soon adopted <b>the</b> sacred <b>language</b> <b>of</b> Islam. <b>The</b> major dialect groups are those of Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, Egypt and North Africa (Maghreb). Their mutual comprehensibility is limited. <b>The</b> Ethiopian <b>languages</b> more closely resemble South Arabian than Arabic proper. The earliest known example is Ge 2 ̆ 7 ez, commonly called Ethiopian. It diverged from South Arabian around the beginning of the Christian era, reaching its greatest extension in the 4 th century CE, when it was spoken especially in the kingdom of Axum {{on both sides of the}} present border of Ethiopia and Eritrea. Although it died out around 1000 CE as a spoken language, Ge 2 ̆ 7 ez is still <b>the</b> liturgical <b>language</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Abyssinian Church...|$|R

From cca 2000 BC, two dialects developed: Babylonian in the south and Assyrian in the north (both succeeded by Aramaic in the 6 th century BC). The main differences between East and Northwest (West) Semitic are in the verb system. Northwest Semitic includes: 1. Amorite and Ugaritic, 2. Canaanite and 3. Aramaic. Also, some twenty years ago, another language was found at the site of Elba, south of Aleppo in Syria. Passages in this language were interspersed with Sumerian texts from cca 2400 BC. Although heavily influenced by Akkadian, Eblaite shows similarities to Northwest Semitic. Amorite is a general term for a <b>language</b> attested from <b>the</b> first half of the 2 nd millennium BC by proper nouns inserted into Akkadian and Egyptian texts. The first Amorites were probably nomads. Ugaritic appears to be an early form of Canaanite. It was spoken and written in Ugarit (Ras Shamra) on the north coast of Phoenicia in the 14 - 13 th centuries BC, before this city was sacked. The first Ugaritic texts, discovered in the late 1920 's, were written with alphabetic characters resembling cuneiform script. Canaanite constitutes a group of closely-related idioms from Palestina, Phoenicia and Syria. Records go back to cca 1500 BC. <b>The</b> major Canaanite <b>languages</b> are Phoenician, Punic, Moabite, Edomite, Hebrew and Ammonite. Initially all were written in Phoenician script. Letters from the 14 th century BC in Akkadian, <b>the</b> <b>language</b> <b>of</b> diplomacy at <b>the</b> time and discovered at Tell el-Amarna in Egypt, contain "mistakes", i. e. early Canaanite words and phrases. Phoenician records extend from cca 1000 BC (inscriptions from Lebanon, Syria, Israel, Cypms, etc.) to the early CE. Punic, developed from Phoenician in Phoenician colonies around the Mediterranean from the 9 th century BC., was still spoken in the 5 th century CE. Moabite, Edomite and Ammonite were spoken in present-day Jordan. Only a few short inscriptions and seals from the 9 - 5 th century BC survive in these languages, which were probably supplanted by Aramaic. The best-known text, in Moabite, is inscribed on the Mesha Stone from about 840 BC; in it Mesha, King of Moab, recounts his battles against King Omri <b>of</b> <b>Israel.</b> Aramaic is recorded from 850 BC in Syria (the Tell Fekheriye stele). It spread very quickly and by the 6 th century BC it was <b>the</b> administrative <b>language</b> and lingua franca in the entire Middle East. Aramaic supplanted many Semitic languages, including Akkadian and Hebrew. Only Greek rivaled it for dominance in the Middle East until the Arab conquest of the 7 th century CE. Aramaic of the pre-Christian era (Ancient Aramaic or Imperial Aramaic) is known from inscriptions, papyrus letters and documents, and from the Old Testament books of Ezra and Daniel. The Aramaic alphabet was derived from Canaanite script. By the 1 st century CE, written Aramaic divided into different forms based on the various types of script adopted by different religions. West Aramaic includes Nabataean, Palmyrene, Aramaic of Hatra, Jewish Palestinian Aramaic (or Galilean Aramaic), Samaritan Aramaic and Christian Palestine Aramaic (Palestinian Syriac). The inhabitants of the Nabataean kingdom (Petra and surroundings in south Jordan), Palmyra (Tadmor in northeast Syria) and Hatra (el-Hadr in nmih Iraq) were mainly Arabs, but from 100 BC to 350 CE they wrote in Aramaic, in their own variant scripts. Classical or Biblical Hebrew, known mainly from the Old Testament, was used in texts from a period of cca 1, 000 years. The earliest known Hebrew inscription, the Gezer Calendar, dates from cca 925 BC. Hebrew was first written in the Canaanite-Phoenician alphabet, but in the 4 th century BC the Jews adopted from Aramaic the square alphabet still used. By the 3 rd century BC Hebrew was spoken only in Judaea, and even there in form known as Mishnaic. Yet <b>the</b> <b>language</b> was maintained by Jews down the centuries as a sacred language and was resurrected (with modifications) in the 20 th century as <b>the</b> official <b>language</b> <b>of</b> <b>Israel.</b> <b>The</b> Southwest, or South Semitic includes: 1. South Arabian, 2. Arabic and 3. <b>the</b> Ethiopian <b>languages.</b> South Arabian is attested by ancient inscriptions and by living vernaculars in present-day Yemen and Oman. The South Arabian alphabet derived from the Canaanite script, brought to the area about 1300 BC from the North Arabia. South Arabian inscriptions (epitaphs, promises and deeds) date from 700 BC to 500 CE. <b>The</b> <b>language</b> comprised several dialects, e. g. Sabaean, Minaean (or Ma'in), Qatabanian and Hadramauth. The modern South Arabian languages are not written and are giving way to Arabic. Best known are Mahr, Awr and Soqotr, spoken by less than one hundred thousand people. The precursors of Arabic proper were the idioms spoken by the tribes of Dedan, Liyn, Thamd and Saf. Thousands of short petroglyphs and graffiti have survived from the period 700 BC - 400 CE. The oldest Arabic texts in a script derived from the Nabataean alphabet date from the 4 th century CE. The cradle of Arabic lies in the North Arabia. It first made its mark as a literary language with pre-Islamic poetry and the Quran, and these sources have remained universal ideals. With the rise of lslam, Arabic rapidly spread over an area from Persia and Asia Minor to the Atlantic Ocean, Spain and the Sahara. Relatively few Arabs emigrated, but the inhabitants of the countries they conquered soon adopted <b>the</b> sacred <b>language</b> <b>of</b> Islam. <b>The</b> major dialect groups are those of Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, Egypt and North Africa (Maghreb). Their mutual comprehensibility is limited. <b>The</b> Ethiopian <b>languages</b> more closely resemble South Arabian than Arabic proper. The earliest known example is Ge'ez, commonly called Ethiopian. It diverged from South Arabian around the beginning of the Christian era, reaching its greatest extension in the 4 th century CE, when it was spoken especially in the kingdom of Axum {{on both sides of the}} present border of Ethiopia and Eritrea. Although it died out around 1000 CE as a spoken language, Ge'ez is still <b>the</b> liturgical <b>language</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Abyssinian Church...|$|R
