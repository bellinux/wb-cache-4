40|$|In {{spite of}} the use of {{standard}} web security measures, swindlers often clone sensitive web sites and/or present false credentials, causing substantial damages to individuals and corporations. Several papers presented such web spoofing attacks, and suggested countermeasures, mostly by improved browser user interface. However, we argue that these countermeasures are inappropriate to most non-expert web users; indeed, they are irrelevant to most practical web-spoofing attacks, which focus on non-expert users. In fact, even expert users could be victim of these practical, simple spoofing attacks, resulting in identity theft or other fraud. We present the <b>trusted</b> <b>credentials</b> area, a simple and practical browser UI enhancement, which allows secure identification of sites and validation of their credentials, thereby preventing web-spoofing, even for naïve users. The <b>trusted</b> <b>credentials</b> area is a fixed part of the browser window, which displays only authenticated credentials, and in particular logos, icons and seals. In fact, we recommend that web sites always provide credentials (e. g. logo) securely, and present them in the <b>trusted</b> <b>credentials</b> area; this will help users to notice the absence of secure logo in spoofed sites...|$|E

Accurate trust establishment and maintenance {{is essential for}} secure and reliable message transmissions in autonomic networks.

In traditional networks, centralized trusted servers provide necessary <b>trust</b> <b>credentials</b> for <b>trust</b> establishment.

40|$|The {{management}} of autonomic networks has gained {{more and more}} attentions because of their wide applications and control difficulties. Autonomic networks are decentralized and self-organized. Without global knowledge on the states of autonomic networks, {{it is difficult to}} predict behaviors of such networks and thus to conduct proper network management and control. This dissertation is the starting point of my effort to theoretically understand the complex characteristics of autonomic networks. In particular, I focus on a specific application: distributed trust management. We view trust among users as a set of relations established on the basis of <b>trust</b> <b>credentials</b> and required by specified policies. Two important components of a distributed trust management system are studied in this work: <b>trust</b> <b>credential</b> distribution and <b>trust</b> evaluation. In autonomic networks, <b>trust</b> <b>credentials</b> are distributed throughout the network. Given the mobility and dynamics of the networks, it is important to properly distribute <b>trust</b> <b>credentials</b> such that users are able to efficiently obtain required credentials and update existing credentials. I present a <b>trust</b> <b>credential</b> distribution scheme based on network coding. After obtaining credentials in need, policies are required for users to evaluate trustworthiness of targets in a distributed way. In this dissertation, I model distributed trust evaluation as an estimation problem and trust evaluation policies based on local interactions are studied. I investigate the convergence of both deterministic and stochastic voting rules and prove their effectiveness with the present of misbehaving users. Autonomic networks rely on collaboration among users. The conflict between the benefit from collaboration and the required cost for collaboration naturally leads to game-theoretic studies. I study collaboration based on cooperative games with communication constraints and give the conditions under which users are willing to collaborate. The results in this dissertation show that a well-designed trust management system is helpful to enforce collaboration. Besides collaboration, I show that trust can be used to the utility optimization problems as well. The effect of trust values is that in the routing and scheduling problems the trustworthiness of the node will be automatically considered and used. For example, packets will not be routed frequently to suspicious nodes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Anonymous {{credentials}} {{provide a}} powerful tool for making assertions about identity while maintaining privacy. However, a limitation of today’s anonymous credential systems is the need for a <b>trusted</b> <b>credential</b> issuer — which is both a single point of failure and a target for compromise. Furthermore, the need for such a trusted issuer can make it challenging to deploy credential systems in practice, particularly in the ad hoc network setting (e. g., anonymous peer-to-peer networks) where no single party can be trusted with this responsibility. In this work we propose a novel anonymous credential scheme that eliminates the need for a <b>trusted</b> <b>credential</b> issuer. Our approach builds on recent results in the area of electronic cash that, given a public append-only ledger, do not need a <b>trusted</b> <b>credential</b> issuer. Furthermore, given a distributed public ledger, as in, e. g., Bitcoin, our system requires no credential issuer at all and hence is decentralized. Using such a public ledger and standard cryptographic primitives, we propose and provide a proof of security for a basic anonymous credential system that allows users to make flexible identity assertions with strong privacy guarantees without relying on trusted parties. Finally, we discuss a number of practical applications for our techniques, including resource management in ad hoc networks and prevention of Sybil attacks.

W 3 C XML Protocol Working Group {{has been developing}} standard techniques such as Web Services Description Language (WSDL), simple object access protocol (SOAP), universal description discovery and integration (UDDI). However, at this stage, there is no standard technique for access control in M-services. This paper describes a secure and flexible access control scheme and protocol for M-services based on role based access control (RBAC). The access control architecture involves a <b>Trusted</b> <b>Credential</b> Center (TCC), a Trusted Authentication and Registration Center (TARC) and a secure ticket based mechanism for service access. Users and service providers register with the TARC and are authenticated. Based on this, tickets are issued by the TCC to users. Tickets carry authorization information needed for the requested services. In particular, {{we are able to}} specify access control polices based on roles. The protocols between the various entities in the model are protected using appropriate security mechanisms such as signatures which are used to verify correctness of the requested service, as well as to direct billing information to the appropriate user. Our architecture supports efficient authentication of users and service providers over different domains and provides a secure access model for services to users. Our model is also able to support anonymity of users. Only the TARC is able to identify misbehaving users. We believe that the proposed architecture forms a good basis for achieving a secure and flexible M-service system...|$|R

30|$|In sum, {{we argue}} that the chance of being {{considered}} for a job is negatively associated with the presence and duration of unemployment. All else being equal, recruiters will evaluate applicants with long periods of unemployment less favourably than those with short unemployment or without any unemployment (hypothesis H 1). Switzerland seems especially suitable for analysing the signalling value of unemployment since it has a strong 1 and strongly standardised VET system with high specificity. This fosters a relatively smooth transition into the labour market because employers <b>trust</b> VET <b>credentials,</b> which facilitates the entrance of VET holders into the labour market (Breen 2005). The tight school-work linkage and low youth unemployment rate suggest that the negative signalling value of unemployment should be more pronounced (Biewen and Steffes 2010) and increase with growing duration of unemployment. If unemployment occurs, the corresponding gaps on a CV will draw recruiters’ attention and be evaluated cautiously.|$|R

40|$|Introduction In Web service environments, {{scalable}} {{access control}} methods are required, as requester populations are often large and dynamic. For this reason, requester identities {{are often not}} known in advance, and traditional access control models that rely on identity to determine access do not fit. Other models require requesters to submit credentials (i. e., signed assertions describing attributes of the owner) along with service invocations. These models often do not consider credentials to be resources, an assumption that does not hold when credentials may contain sensitive information. Trust negotiation addresses these problems by granting access based {{on the level of}} trust established in a negotiation between the requester and the provider. During this <b>trust</b> negotiation, <b>credentials</b> are exchanged to gradually build trust. However, several issues need to be addressed before trust negotiation can become a viable technology.

40|$|Exchange of {{attribute}} credentials is a {{means to}} establish mutual trust between strangers that wish to share resources or conduct business transactions. Automated Trust Negotiation (ATN) is an approach to regulate the flow of sensitive attributes during such an exchange. Recently, it has been noted that early ATN designs do not adequately protect the privacy of negotiating parties. While unauthorized access to credentials can be denied, sensitive information about the attributes they carry may easily be inferred based {{on the behavior of}} negotiators faithfully adhering to proposed negotiation procedure. Some proposals for correcting this problem do so by sacrificing the ability to e#ectively use sensitive credentials. We study an alternative design that avoids this pitfall by allowing negotiators to define policy protecting the attribute itself, rather than the credentials that prove it. We show how such a policy can be enforced. We address technical issues with doing this in the context of <b>trust</b> management-style <b>credentials,</b> which carry delegations and enable one attribute to be inferred from others, and in the context where credentials are stored in a distributed way, and must be discovered and collected before being used in ATN...|$|R

The original idea for an anonymous credential system was derived from blind signatures, but relied on a <b>trusted</b> party for <b>credential</b> transfer—the translation from one pseudonym to another. The blind signature scheme introduced by Chaum was based on RSA signatures and based on the discrete logarithm problem can be used for constructing anonymous credential systems.|$|R

Attribute authority sets and access control policy entries are embedded into pervasive devices defining initial trust relationships. Members of the attribute authority sets are <b>trusted</b> to issue <b>credentials</b> for the corresponding attributes that can then be used to gain access to services provided by smart devices. We allow these sets to grow dynamically without requiring manual reconfiguration facilitating decentralized administration, which is required in volatile pervasive environments, and attribute mapping to allow roaming among smart authority domains. ...|$|R
