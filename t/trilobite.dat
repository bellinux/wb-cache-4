5|$|The first Burgess Shale fossils {{were found}} on Mount Stephen in Canada's Rocky Mountains by a {{construction}} worker, whose reports of them reached Richard McConnell of the Geological Survey of Canada. McConnell found <b>trilobite</b> beds there in 1886, and some unusual fossils that he reported to his superior. These were misdiagnosed as headless shrimps with unjointed appendages, and were named Anomalocaris because of their unusual appendages– but {{turned out to be}} pieces of a puzzle that took 90years to solve.|$|E

25|$|In 1981, UNESCO {{recognised}} {{the importance}} of the Burgess Shale by naming it a World Heritage site. Access to the Fossil Ridge quarries and <b>Trilobite</b> beds is now possible only as part of a guided group, and the sites are under continuous surveillance by Parks Canada, with hefty fines for removing or defacing fossil material.|$|E
50|$|<b>Trilobites</b> {{appear to}} have been {{exclusively}} marine organisms, since the fossilized remains of <b>trilobites</b> are always found in rocks containing fossils of other salt-water animals such as brachiopods, crinoids, and corals. Within the marine paleoenvironment, <b>trilobites</b> were found in a broad range from extremely shallow water to very deep water. <b>Trilobites,</b> like brachiopods, crinoids, and corals, are found on all modern continents, and occupied every ancient ocean from which Paleozoic fossils have been collected. The remnants of <b>trilobites</b> can range from the preserved body to pieces of the exoskeleton, which it sheds in the process known as ecdysis. In addition, the tracks left behind by <b>trilobites</b> living on the sea floor are often preserved as trace fossils.|$|R
50|$|Redlichiina is a {{suborder}} of {{the order}} Redlichiida of <b>Trilobites.</b> The suborder contains three superfamilies: Emuelloidea, Redlichioidea and Paradoxidoidea. These <b>trilobites</b> {{are some of the}} oldest <b>trilobites</b> known. They originated {{at the beginning of the}} Cambrian Period and disappeared (possibly by evolving into members of the Ptychopariida order) at the end of the middle Cambrian.|$|R
5000|$|The {{earliest}} <b>trilobites</b> {{known from}} the fossil record are redlichiids and ptychopariid bigotinids dated to some [...] Contenders for the earliest <b>trilobites</b> include Profallotaspis jakutensis (Siberia), Fritzaspis spp. (western USA), Hupetina antiqua (Morocco) and Serrania gordaensis (Spain). All <b>trilobites</b> {{are thought to have}} originated in present-day Siberia, with subsequent distribution and radiation from this location.|$|R
25|$|The {{formation}} was {{deposited in}} a tidal-dominated deltaic environment at high southern paleolatitudes {{at the edge}} of the Paleozoic Paleo-Tethys Ocean. The Cuche Formation is highly fossiliferous; many Placoderm fish fossils, flora, bivalves, arthropods, crustaceans and ostracods have been discovered in the youngest Paleozoic strate of the Floresta Massif, while the underlying Floresta Formation is richer in <b>trilobite</b> biodiversity.|$|E
25|$|Cruziana are {{excavation}} trace marks {{made on the}} {{sea floor}} which have a two-lobed structure with a central groove. The lobes are covered with scratch marks made by {{the legs of the}} excavating organism, usually a <b>trilobite</b> or allied arthropod. Cruziana are most common in marine sediments formed during the Paleozoic era, particularly in rocks from the Cambrian and Ordovician periods. Over 30 ichnospecies of Cruziana have been identified. See also Isopodichnus.|$|E
25|$|The rounded smooth {{shape of}} Bumastus, {{as well as}} the almost {{complete}} effacement of its cephalon, {{is believed to have been}} an adaptation for burrowing. The presence of well-developed eyes also suggest that it may have kept them above the substrate by burrowing into sediments backward. They are situated in such a way that they provide the <b>trilobite</b> with a semicircular field of vision on each side, keeping them aware of movements near them.|$|E
50|$|Some other later <b>trilobites</b> {{also lost}} facial sutures secondarily. The type of sutures found in {{different}} species are used {{extensively in the}} taxonomy and phylogeny of <b>trilobites.</b>|$|R

25|$|Niles Eldredge's {{study of}} the Phacops <b>trilobite</b> genus {{supported}} the hypothesis that modifications to {{the arrangement of the}} trilobite's eye lenses proceeded by fits and starts over millions of years during the Devonian. Eldredge's interpretation of the Phacops fossil record was that the aftermaths of the lens changes, but not the rapidly occurring evolutionary process, were fossilized. This and other data led Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge to publish their seminal paper on punctuated equilibrium in 1971.|$|E
25|$|Andersen {{discovered}} an until then unknown area of Rogaland containing rock of the Cambrian-Silurian age {{on a much}} lower level than the surrounding bedrock. His collected fossiles from this area were deposited in the Paleontologic Museum at Tøyen in Oslo. In this material Professor Gunnar Henningsmoen {{discovered an}} until then unknown <b>trilobite</b> species, which was given the name (Ptychparia anderseni) for Andersen. During this fieldwork in the Lysefjord area, Andersen developed a method for determination of climatic conditions from the reconstruction of Ice Age glaciers which is still used by geologists and geographers.|$|E
25|$|Secondly, the paleocurrent data orientated from south-south west to north-north east {{is common}} to both Lesser Himalaya and Tethyan Himalaya, more {{specifically}} in the Tal Group and Kunzam La Formation, respectively. Moreover, the lithology of the two sequences connotes a fluvial depositional setting and the lithofacies of the rocks strongly supports {{the idea that the}} Lesser Himalaya and Tethyan Himalaya represent nearshore and offshore portions of a continental margin. Finally, both sequences contain the same Early Cambrian equatorial <b>trilobite</b> species, reinforcing the likelihood of the passive continental margin model.|$|E
50|$|During the Devonian Illinois {{was still}} {{covered by the}} sea and had not drifted far north from the equator. <b>Trilobites</b> were still present. Devonian <b>trilobites</b> from Illinois {{included}} Phacops and Odontocephalus.|$|R
50|$|Ocular sutures - are sutures {{surrounding}} {{the edges of}} the compound eye. <b>Trilobites</b> with these sutures lose the entire surface of the eyes when molting. It is common among Cambrian <b>trilobites.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Trilobites</b> {{had many}} lifestyles; some moved {{over the sea}} bed as predators, scavengers, or filter feeders, and some swam, feeding on plankton. Most lifestyles {{expected}} of modern marine arthropods are seen in <b>trilobites,</b> {{with the possible exception}} of parasitism (scientific debate continues). Some <b>trilobites</b> (particularly the family Olenidae) are even thought to have evolved a symbiotic relationship with sulfur-eating bacteria from which they derived food.|$|R
25|$|The cephalon (head segment) is {{very large}} and {{strongly}} convex. The facial sutures (the divisions by which the cephalon splits when the <b>trilobite</b> molts) is opisthoparian, with the suture ending along the hind cephalic margin. The genal angles of the cephalon - the edges where the lateral and rear margins of the cephalon meet - are rounded. The cephalon is effaced (smooth and mostly featureless), an evolutionary trend also seen in Illaenus and Trimerus, though not as pronounced as that of Bumastus. The glabella (the central lobe of the head) is almost fused to the fixigena.|$|E
25|$|This model {{fails to}} {{reconcile}} with detrital zircon ages, and paleontological evidence {{with respect to}} the similarities between Tethyan and Lesser Himalaya. Similar to the crystalline axis model, this model faces the same challenges {{with respect to the}} evidence that supports the passive margin model. <b>Trilobite</b> fauna, paleocurrent and lithological similarities would be unlikely if the rock units were formed in separate terranes as explained by Myrow et al. Earlier predictions that suggest a thrust/ shortening event in Tethyan Himalaya in the early Paleozoic, and the simultaneous formation of granitic intrusions under the sequence, were also undermined by the apparent rifting isotopic signatures in the granites.|$|E
25|$|Spriggina fossils {{represent}} {{the first known}} organisms with a bilaterally symmetric body plan. They had a head, tail and almost identical halves. They probably had sensory organs {{in the head and}} digestive organs in the tail which would have allowed them to find food more efficiently. They were capable of locomotion, which gave them an advantage over other organisms from that era that were either tethered {{to the bottom of the}} ocean floor or moved very slowly. Spriggina was soft bodied, which leave the fossils as faint imprints. It is most likely related to annelids, however there is some speculation that it could be related to arthropods since it somewhat resembles <b>trilobite</b> fossils.|$|E
40|$|Cambrian <b>trilobites</b> mainly {{lived on}} the sea floor, and up till now few, if any, {{unequivocally}} planktonic <b>trilobites</b> have been reported from earlier than the Ordovician. The late Cambrian (Furongian) to late Ordovician olenids are a distinctive group of benthic (sea-floor dwelling) or nekto-benthic <b>trilobites.</b> Here we show, however, that one recently described, miniaturized and very spiny olenid species, Ctenopyge ceciliae must have been planktonic (passively drifting or feebly swimming in the upper waters of the sea). This interpretation is based not only upon body form {{but also on the}} analysis of its visual system and {{may be one of the}} earliest records of the planktonic realm being invaded by <b>trilobites...</b>|$|R
50|$|Planiscutellum is a genus of <b>trilobites</b> in {{the order}} Corynexochida family Styginidae. These <b>trilobites</b> were nektobenthic detritivore. They lived in the Silurian period in the upper Ludlow epoch, from 422.9 ± 1.5 to 418.7 ± 2.8 million years ago.|$|R
50|$|Phillipsiidae is {{a family}} of proetid <b>trilobites,</b> the various genera of which {{comprise}} {{some of the very}} last of the <b>trilobites,</b> with a range that extended from the Kinderhookian epoch of the Lower Mississippian, to the Guadalupian epoch of the Middle Permian.|$|R
25|$|After Raymond's few excursions, the Burgess Shale faded {{somewhat}} into obscurity. Walcott's third wife, Mary Vaux, discouraged {{access to}} the collections, which gathered dust on high shelves in the Smithsonian Institution. Harry Whittington, then of Harvard University, was to prove the catalyst that renewed interest in the site. As he showed a visiting <b>trilobite</b> expert around Raymond's collections, {{the necessity of a}} restudy was pointed out to Whittington, who proceeded to lobby the Geological Survey of Canada (GSC) to revisit the locality. They did, and as a leading authority on trilobites, Whittington was the logical choice to head the palaeontological investigations in the arthropod-rich Shale. In the company of Jim Aitken and Bill Fritz, he led a GSC reconnaissance expedition in 1966; fellow trilobitologist David Bruton joined the crew the next year as they went out to quarry in force. Dynamite was used in only the smallest quantities, with closely spaced drill holes used to separate large blocks of rock, and large slabs were collected systematically from the Walcott and Raymond quarries. These were labelled with their stratigraphic level, helicoptered from the mountain face, and returned to Whittington's base at the Sedgwick Museum in Cambridge for further study. The 1967 operation resulted in the description of new animals, including the earliest known crinoid and a complete Anomalocaris. Initially, detailed descriptions were made {{of some of the most}} common arthropod-like organisms: Marrella, Sidneyia and Burgessia. These redescriptions were slow and laborious, making extensive use of the camera lucida technique for microscope drawing, with papers based extensively around detailed drawing of the fossil specimens. It soon became clear that the Burgess Shale was even more exceptional than previously thought - soft tissue was preserved to an exquisite quality, allowing insights into early life that had never before been dreamed of, and preserving a range of non-mineralising taxa which are otherwise invisible in the fossil record. With an overwhelmingly diverse fauna in need of cataloguing, Harry Whittington set his two new graduate students to the task, assigning Derek Briggs and Simon Conway Morris the arthropods and 'worms', respectively. This work began to lift the veil on an unexpectedly diverse ecosystem, with almost as much variety as seen in the modern oceans - the old theory that Cambrian life was simple, straightforwards and slightly dull disintegrated further with each new fossil described. This view was reinforced with the identification of other Burgess Shale-type deposits elsewhere in the world, a search for which was triggered by the discovery of the Chengjiang and Sirius Passet lagerstätten in 1984.|$|E
500|$|For its grown form, the [...] "Adult Trilobite", Max found {{inspiration}} from an arthropod-like creature from Earth's Cambrian period, and the alien octopus in Jean Giraud's illustrations for {{the comic strip}} The Long Tomorrow. Further inspiration came after Max found a formaldehyde-preserved giant squid, an image which met with Scott's approval. The film's last-unveiled creature, the [...] "Deacon", was named by Scott for its long, pointed head that he considered resembled a bishop's mitre. Scanlan aimed to represent the creature's genetic lineage, beginning with Shaw and Holloway who produce the <b>Trilobite</b> which impregnates the Engineer, in its design. However, the creature was given a somewhat feminine appearance, since [...] "it was born of a female before being born of a male." [...] Messing drew inspiration for the Deacon's birth scene from the birth of foals, and created an iridescent appearance for its skin, based on the equine placenta. The Deacon's protruding jaw {{was inspired by the}} goblin shark.|$|E
500|$|When writers Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett brainstormed for the {{original}} film, they decided to have an Alien impregnate a male orally {{as a metaphor for}} rape. O'Bannon suggested to Scott that his collaborator from the failed Dune adaptation, Swiss surrealist artist H. R. Giger, design the Alien. Scott chose the sketch Necronom IV, from Giger's Necronomicon, {{as the basis for the}} Alien because of its sexual ambiguity and phallic overtones. The Deacon, a creature predating the Alien which shares several biological traits, appears in the final scene of Prometheus after it explodes from a dead Engineer's chest. The Engineer was impregnated by a <b>trilobite</b> conceived by Elizabeth Shaw after sexual intercourse with an infected Charlie Holloway. Designer Neal Scanlan explained in the book Prometheus: The Art of the Film that the breed borrows physical traits such as femininity from Shaw.

500|$|Analysis of the Burgess Shale fossils {{has been}} {{important}} to {{the interpretation of the}} Precambrian and Cambrian fossil records, and thus to scientific {{understanding of the nature of}} early evolution. English geologist and palaeontologist William Buckland (1784–1856) realised that a dramatic change in the fossil record occurred around the start of the Cambrian period, [...] The earliest Cambrian <b>trilobite</b> fossils are about 530millionyears old, but were already both diverse and widespread, suggesting that the group had a long, hidden history. The earliest fossils widely accepted as echinoderms appeared at about the same time Because Darwin's contemporaries had insufficient information to establish relative dates of Cambrian rocks, they had the impression that animals appeared instantaneously. Charles Darwin regarded the solitary existence of Cambrian trilobites and total absence of other intermediate fossils as the [...] "gravest" [...] problem to his theory of natural selection, and he devoted an entire chapter of The Origin of Species on the matter. He speculated that the phenomenon, now known as the Cambrian explosion, was a product of gaps in the sequence of fossil-bearing rocks and in contemporary knowledge of those rocks.|$|E
500|$|Tapeats Sandstone averages 525million {{years old}} and is made of medium- to {{coarse-grained}} sand and conglomerate that was deposited on an ancient shore (see 3a in [...] ). Ripple marks are common in the upper members of this dark brown thin-bedded layer. Fossils and imprint trails of trilobites and brachiopods have also {{been found in the}} Tapeats. Today it is a cliff-former that is [...] thick. Bright Angel Shale averages 515million {{years old and}} is made of mudstone-derived shale that is interbedded with small sections of sandstone and shaly limestone with a few thin beds of dolomite. It was mostly deposited as mud just offshore and contains brachiopod, <b>trilobite,</b> and worm fossils (see 3b in figure 1). The color of this formation is mostly various shades of green with some brownish-tan to gray parts. It is a slope-former and is [...] thick. Glauconite is responsible for the green coloration of the Bright Angel. Muav Limestone averages 505million years old and is made of gray, thin-bedded limestone that was deposited farther offshore from calcium carbonate precipitates (see 3c in figure 1). The western part of the canyon has a much thicker sequence of Muav than the eastern part. The Muav is a cliff-former, [...] thick.|$|E
500|$|The {{discovery}} of Anomalocaris ("abnormal shrimp") was a comedy of errors. The name was initially {{given to a}} fossil that looked like the rear end of a shrimp-like crustacean. Walcott classified a ring-like fossil he called Peytoia {{as a kind of}} jellyfish, and another poorly preserved fossil he called Laggania as a holothurian (sea cucumber). After many plot twists, Derek Briggs started dissecting another ill-defined fossil in very thin slices and found a pair of Anomalocaris-like structures on one end of a specimen of Laggania, which also had a specimen of Peytoia attached just behind those of Anomalocaris. After dissecting more specimens and finding similar configurations, Briggs and Whittington concluded that the whole assemblage represented a single animal, which was named Anomalocaris because that was the earliest name assigned to any of its parts. This animal's body was fragile and usually disintegrated before it could be fossilized. But the complete animal had tough grasping appendages (Anomalocaris), a tough, ring-like mouth with teeth on the inner edge (Peytoia) and a long, segmented body (Laggania) with flaps on the sides that enabled it to swim with a Mexican wave motion, and perhaps to turn quickly by putting the flaps on one side into reverse. This monster was over [...] long when other animals were only a few inches at most. Nedin suggested in 1999 that the animal was capable of taking heavily armored trilobites apart, possibly by grabbing one end of their prey in their jaws while using their appendages to quickly rock {{the other end of the}} animal back and forth, causing the prey's exoskeleton to rupture and allowing the predator to access its innards. In 2009 Hagadorn found that anomalocarid mouthparts showed little wear, which suggests they did not come into regular contact with mineralised <b>trilobite</b> shells. Computer modeling of the Anomalocaris mouthparts suggests they were in fact better suited to sucking on smaller, soft-bodied organisms. Although Whittington and Briggs concluded that Anomalocaris did not fit into any known phylum, research since the 1990s has concluded that it was closely related to Opabinia and to the ancestors of arthropods. In 2009 a fossil named Schinderhannes bartelsi, an apparent relative of Anomalocaris, was found in the Early Devonian period, about 100million years later than the Burgess Shale.|$|E
