2500|$|Gibson began {{production}} on his film without securing outside funding or distribution. In 2002, he explained why {{he could not}} get backing from the Hollywood studios: [...] "This is a film about something that nobody wants to touch, shot in two dead languages. In Los Angeles <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> am insane, and maybe I am." [...] Gibson and his Icon Productions company provided the film's sole backing, spending about $30 million on production costs and an estimated $15 million on marketing. After early accusations of anti-Semitism, it became difficult for Gibson to find an American distribution company. 20th Century Fox had a first-look deal with Icon and passed on the film in response to public protests. In order to avoid the spectacle of other studios turning down the film and to avoid subjecting the distributor to the same intense public criticism he had received, Gibson decided to distribute the movie in the United States himself, with Newmarket Films.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2004, Gaahl again {{received}} a prison sentence, for aggravated assault. He appealed for a reduced sentence, and in February 2005 he was re-sentenced to fourteen {{months in prison}} and ordered to pay the victim 190,000 NOK (about 30,400 US$) in compensation. The incident happened in February 2002 during a late-night party at Gaahl's house in Espedal, when he became involved in a confrontation {{with a man who}} arrived at his house. Gaahl was accused of severely beating the man, collecting his blood into a cup and threatening to make him drink it. Gaahl said [...] "I {{was the one who was}} attacked, but <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> punished him too hard. As I always say, when people cross my line and I let them know where the line is many steps before they cross it, and still they choose to cross it, then I will be the one to decide what their punishment will be". He also claimed to have given the man the cup [...] "so that he would not make such a mess in my house with all the blood". In March 2006, Gaahl recorded vocals for Gorgoroth's next album, Ad Majorem Sathanas Gloriam. According to band members, he was in prison from April to December 2006.|$|E

2500|$|After United Artists {{declined}} to budget the film, Lucas and producer Gary Kurtz presented the film treatment to Universal Pictures, the studio that financed American Graffiti; however, it rejected its {{options for the}} film because the concept was [...] "a little strange", and it said that Lucas should follow American Graffiti with more consequential themes. Lucas said, [...] "I've always been an outsider to Hollywood types. <b>They</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> do weirdo films." [...] According to Kurtz, Lew Wasserman, the studio's head, [...] "just didn't think much of science fiction at that time, didn't think it had much of a future then, with that particular audience." [...] He said that [...] "science fiction wasn't popular in the mid-'70s ... {{what seems to be}} the case generally is that the studio executives are looking for what was popular last year, rather than trying to look forward to what might be popular next year." [...] Lucas explained in 1977 that the film is not [...] "about the future" [...] and that it [...] "is a fantasy much closer to the Brothers Grimm than it is to [...] ". He added: [...] "My main reason for making it was to give young people an honest, wholesome fantasy life, the kind my generation had. We had westerns, pirate movies, all kinds of great things. Now they have The Six Million Dollar Man and Kojak. Where are the romance, the adventure, and the fun that used to be in practically every movie made?" [...] Kurtz said, [...] "Although Star Wars wasn't like that at all, it was just sort of lumped into that same kind of [...] category." ...|$|E
