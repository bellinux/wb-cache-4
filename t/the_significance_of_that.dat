5|$|The {{altering}} of the qibla {{was precisely}} the reason the Rashidun caliph Umar, despite identifying the mosque which Muhammad used to ascend to Heaven upon his arrival at the Noble Sanctuary in 638, neither prayed facing it nor built any structure upon it. This was because <b>the</b> <b>significance</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> particular spot on the Noble Sanctuary was superseded in Islamic jurisprudence by the Kaaba in Mecca after the change of the qibla towards that site.|$|E

60|$|What Austen really felt, {{when he had}} grasped <b>the</b> <b>significance</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> fact, was relief--gratitude. A wave {{of renewed}} affection for his father swept over him, of affection and pity and admiration, and for the instant he forgot Mr. Flint.|$|E
60|$|The {{telegram}} came to Mason {{as he sat}} on {{the porch}} of the Herrick cottage.

60|$|Her {{speed was}} checked only an instant, {{for the top}} of the rock was knocked off by the force of the blow, and the ship passed swiftly on, but there could be no mistaking <b>the</b> <b>significance</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> shock.

60|$|But when I had {{penetrated}} to {{the little}} open space within that cluster of naked trees, I had proof overwhelming that the worst had befallen.

50|$|In the 2000s a new {{step was}} made by {{recognising}} <b>the</b> <b>significance</b> <b>of</b> ‘framing’; <b>that</b> is, <b>the</b> form of the spaces in which units of meaning were placed and transferred between.

6000|$|If {{we compare}} the skeletons of the orang or {{chimpanzee}} {{with that of}} man, we find them {{to be a kind}} of distorted copy, every bone corresponding (with very few exceptions), but altered somewhat in size, proportions, and position.

60|$|It may, of course, {{be argued}} that the belief in Creator is itself a myth.

50|$|Two {{problems}} with a stylistic analysis of poetry are noted by PM Wetherill in Literary Text: An Examination of Critical Methods. The first is {{that there may be}} an over-preoccupation with one particular feature that may well minimise <b>the</b> <b>significance</b> <b>of</b> others <b>that</b> are equally important (Wetherill. 1974, 133). The second is that any attempt to see a text as simply a collection of stylistic elements will tend to ignore other ways whereby meaning is produced (Wetherill. 1974, 133).|$|R
