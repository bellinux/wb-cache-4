[...] The Hartford Courants Roger Catlin did not think Grace's and Leo's marriage would last long. [...] "Are we to believe Will & Grace will now be about a married woman, {{her husband and her}} gay roommate? That they'll all still live together? That Connick will no longer have merely special-guest status? The inevitable breakup and annulment to come are as obvious as the sweeps-timing of the ceremony." ...|$|E

I think she’d have a plan. If there is a way to go forward with Laura and make her into what I'd like her <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>now,</b> then perhaps I would do it.

2500|$|Immediately {{prior to}} {{invasion}} in 1864, magistrate, John Eldon Gorst, wrote, [...] "The land around Rangiaowhia and Te Awamutu, extending {{to and including}} part of Kihikihi, belongs to natives of the great Waikato tribe[...] [...] Besides the great villages of Rangiaowhia, Kihikihi, and Kuakotari, numerous little hamlets are dotted about the country, consisting {{of three or four}} native houses surrounded by their patches of cultivated land. Even those parts of the country which appear to be only a barren waste of heavy fern land would be found, on enquiry, to have been once under cultivation, and <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>now</b> used as a pasturage for horses, cattle, or pigs [...] [...] [...] Rangiaowhia, for instance, is surrounded by a fence many miles in circuit; roads are made in various directions bridges have been thrown over impassible swamps; and a good many mill-dams have been constructed. A considerable part of the land was covered, a generation ago, with ancient forest, which the industry of the Waikatos has cleared." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} take {{decision}} the envoys of the Eastern Patriarchs asked the Bulgarian delegated the following question: [...] "When you took [...] Motherland, tell us under which authority {{it used to be}} and were there Latin or Greek priests?". They gave the prepared answer: [...] "We took [...] Motherland with arms from the rule of the Greeks and there we found not Latin but Greek priests." [...] In compliance with the response of the Bulgarian envoys, the Eastern Patriarchates pronounced their decision: [...] "If you have found Greek priests, it is clear that this land was under the rule of Constantinople... Therefore we adjudge, because the Bulgarian motherland, as we got to know, was previously under Greek ruler and had Greek priests, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>now</b> returned again through Christianity to the holy Church of Constantinople, from which it was separated through paganism." [...] The protests of the Roman legates were futile. They forged a letter in which the Pope allegedly warned the Patriarch of Constantinople not to interfere with the Bulgarian matters, but Ignatius ignored it. After the Council (in the very same year) the Latin priests had to leave Bulgaria and were substituted by Byzantine missionaries.|$|E

[...] At one point, the song begins to skip, reminiscent of a skipping compact disc. Parker included this as an extension of his fascination with glitches in playback. [...] "Nangs" [...] has been noted for its interlude-like composition and its woozy, psychedelic sound. [...] "Yes I'm Changing" [...] is a song Parker claims he does not remember making: [...] "A weird experience, because it was like it was someone else made the song. I had no memory of imagining it."

2500|$|Sharp used {{to treat}} poor Londoners at his house. One night, he was asked for help by a slave who had been beaten by his owner. Sharp treated the man but also {{discussed}} the case with his brother, Granville Sharp. The man was called Jonathan Strong {{and he had been}} so badly beaten that he was blind and required four months of treatment at St Bartholomew's Hospital. Sharp met the expense of Strong's recovery and arranging his employment with a pharmacist. However, two years later, while Strong was serving as a footman on the pharmacist's coach, he was seen by his owner, David Lisle, who sold him to a Jamaican planter and had him kidnapped. Strong got a message to Granville Sharp, who immediately took the matter up with the Lord Mayor of London, who called a hearing and declared Strong <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>now</b> free. Lisle challenged Granville Sharp to a duel, but he declined, later explaining [...] "David Lisle, Esquire, (a man of the law) called on me to demand gentlemanlike satisfaction. I told him that as he had studied the law so many years, he should want no satisfaction that the law could give him." [...] The English courts ultimately sided with the Sharp brothers, denying an application that they should pay Lisle two hundred pounds in damages for taking another man's property. From this encounter, Sharp's younger brother Granville went on to become an early advocate for the abolition of slavery and remained so for fifty years.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{scientists}} {{who study the}} ice ablation in Greenland consider that a two or three °C temperature rise {{would result in a}} complete melting of Greenland’s ice. Positioned in the Arctic, the Greenland ice sheet is especially vulnerable to climate change. Arctic climate is believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>now</b> rapidly warming and much larger Arctic shrinkage changes are projected. The Greenland Ice Sheet has experienced record melting in recent years since detailed records have been kept and is likely to contribute substantially to sea level rise as well as to possible changes in ocean circulation in the future if this is sustained. The area of the sheet that experiences melting has been argued to have increased by about 16% between 1979 (when measurements started) and 2002 (most recent data). The area of melting in 2002 broke all previous records. The number of glacial earthquakes at the Helheim Glacier and the northwest Greenland glaciers increased substantially between 1993 and 2005. In 2006, estimated monthly changes in the mass of Greenland's ice sheet suggest that it is melting {{at a rate of about}} [...] per year. A more recent study, based on reprocessed and improved data between 2003 and 2008, reports an average trend of [...] per year. These measurements came from the US space agency's GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) satellite, launched in 2002, as reported by BBC. Using data from two ground-observing satellites, ICESAT and ASTER, a study published in Geophysical Research Letters (September 2008) shows that nearly 75 percent of the loss of Greenland's ice can be traced back to small coastal glaciers.|$|E
