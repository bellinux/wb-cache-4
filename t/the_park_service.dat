5|$|Thirty years later, Congress passed {{legislation}} creating New Bedford Whaling National Historical Park, commemorating the city's past. It included the entire historic district within its boundaries, and <b>the</b> <b>park</b> <b>service</b> chose the old NBIS building as its visitors' center. In 2008, WHALE {{turned over the}} neighboring Corson Building, built 1875-84, to <b>the</b> <b>Park</b> <b>Service,</b> which it had renovated after a 1997 fire. Plans call {{for it to be}} used for educational purposes related to the park, with a 60-seat theater, archival space, seminar room, and similar features.|$|E
5|$|The National Register of Historic Places is {{administered}} by <b>the</b> <b>Park</b> <b>Service</b> (with nearly 79,000 entries) and automatically includes all National Park System areas designated because of their historic significance. This includes all National Historical Parks/Historic Sites, National Battlefields/Military Parks, National Memorials, and some National Monuments.|$|E
5|$|American {{black bears}} were a common {{attraction}} by the 1930s, but in 1929 alone 81people required treatment for bear-related injuries. Troublesome bears were marked with white paint before being relocated {{to other parts}} of the park, and repeat offenders were killed. Bear feeding shows were stopped in 1940, but <b>the</b> <b>Park</b> <b>Service</b> continued to kill bears that habitually raided camps; 200 were put down between 1960 and 1972. Park visitors are now educated about proper food storage.|$|E

5000|$|Herbert Maier (January 2, 1893 - February 23, 1969) was an American {{architect}} and public administrator, most notable {{as an architect}} for his work at Yosemite, Grand Canyon and Yellowstone National Parks. Maier, {{as a consultant to}} <b>the</b> National <b>Park</b> <b>Service,</b> designed four trailside museums in Yellowstone, three of which survive as National Historic Landmarks.

5|$|Bighorn sheep, {{which were}} driven locally extinct through hunting and disease, have been reintroduced {{in the east}} of the park. <b>The</b> <b>Park</b> <b>Service</b> and the Yosemite Fund have also helped {{peregrine}} falcons and great gray owls to re-establish themselves. Tule elk, which had been hunted almost to extinction, were housed in a pen in Yosemite before being moved to the Owens Valley in eastern California.|$|E
5|$|Ranger-led {{events at}} the {{monument}} have historically included indoor and outdoor talks, showings of an 18-minute orientation film, hikes in Blue Basin, Cant Ranch walking tours, and astronomy programs at the Painted Hills Unit. These events are free and most do not require reservations. Specific times for the activities are available from rangers at the monument. For students and teachers, <b>the</b> <b>Park</b> <b>Service</b> offers programs at the monument as well as fossil kits and other materials for classroom use.|$|E
5|$|The park can {{be divided}} into 5 {{sections}} for the day-user—Yosemite Valley, Wawona/Mariposa Grove/Glacier Point, Tuolumne Meadows, Hetch Hetchy, and Crane Flat/White Wolf.

5|$|After World War II, and {{following}} considerable controversy, the City of Philadelphia {{agreed that it}} would transfer custody of the bell and Independence Hall, while retaining ownership, to the federal government. The city would also transfer various colonial-era buildings it owned. Congress agreed to the transfer in 1948, and three years later Independence National Historical Park was founded, incorporating those properties and administered by the National Park Service (NPS or Park Service). <b>The</b> <b>Park</b> <b>Service</b> {{would be responsible for}} maintaining and displaying the bell. The NPS would also administer the three blocks just north of Independence Hall, which had been condemned by the state, razed, and developed into a park, Independence Mall.|$|E
5|$|Biscayne National Park {{includes}} {{a number of}} navigational aids, {{as well as an}} ornamental structure built to resemble a lighthouse. The Fowey Rocks Light is a skeleton-frame cast iron structure built in 1878. Already included within the boundaries of the park, the light was acquired by <b>the</b> <b>Park</b> <b>Service</b> on October 2, 2012. The unmanned Pacific Reef Light is about three miles (5 km) offshore from Elliott Key. The original 1921 structure was replaced in 2000 and its lantern was placed on display in a park in Islamorada.|$|E
5|$|Fort Bayard was an {{earthwork}} fort {{constructed in}} 1861 northwest of Tenleytown in the District of Columbia {{as part of}} the defenses of Washington, D.C. during the American Civil War. It never faced major opposition during the conflict and was decommissioned following the surrender of Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia. Named after Brigadier General George Dashiell Bayard, who was killed at the Battle of Fredericksburg, the site of the fort is in Boundary Park, located at the intersection of River Road and Western Avenue NW in Washington, D.C. and is maintained by the U.S. National Park Service. No trace of the fort remains, though a marker commemorating its existence has been constructed by <b>the</b> <b>Park</b> <b>Service.</b>|$|E

5|$|In March 2011, <b>the</b> <b>Park</b> <b>Service</b> {{installed}} two webcams at the Sheep Rock Unit. Both transmit continuous real-time images; one {{shows the}} paleontology {{lab at the}} Condon Center and the other depicts Sheep Rock and nearby features. In June 2011, work was finished on a new ranger residence in the Painted Hills Unit that makes the unit almost carbon-neutral. Solar panels generate enough electricity to power the house {{as well as the}} ranger's electric vehicle, on loan from its manufacturer for a year. The project is part of ongoing efforts to make the whole park carbon-neutral.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, the ATC made {{progress}} toward protecting the trail from development, thanks to efforts {{of politicians and}} officials. The National Trails System Act of 1968 designated the Pacific Crest Trail and Appalachian Trail as the first national scenic trails and {{paved the way for}} a series of National Scenic Trails within the National Park and National Forest systems. Trail volunteers worked with the National Park Service to map a permanent route for the trail, and by 1971 a permanent route had been marked (though minor changes continue to this day). By the close of the 20th century, <b>the</b> <b>Park</b> <b>Service</b> had completed the purchase of all but a few miles of the trail's span.|$|E
5|$|Lack of {{understanding}} of wildfire management by the media led to some sensationalist reporting and inaccuracies. Some news agencies gave the impression {{that most of the}} park was being destroyed. On August 30, an ABC News interview with Stanley Mott, apparently a tourist, incorrectly identified him as the Director of the National Park Service (William Mott). In another story, The New York Times stated that <b>the</b> <b>Park</b> <b>Service</b> policy was to allow natural fires to burn themselves out, whereas that of the U.S. Forest Service was to suppress all such fires—a mischaracterization of the policies of both agencies. The media also had some difficulty distinguishing between these two completely separate agencies. Sources quoted by The Washington Post, USA Today, and the Chicago Tribune later stated that comments attributed to them were fabricated, and one source commented that a September 8, 1988 report by the Chicago Tribune had more errors than facts. On the same day, The Washington Post associated the smoke and presence of military vehicles and helicopters overhead with the 1968 events in Da Nang, Vietnam, giving the impression of catastrophe. The fires had been very active in late July. In early August, fire managers reached a conclusion that the fires would not likely expand much further, {{due to a lack of}} fuel, and the Director of the National Park Service declared on August 11 that the fires were contained. When this optimistic announcement was followed by Black Saturday on August 20, and the fire that threatened the Old Faithful complex in early September, the media were again highly critical of <b>the</b> <b>park</b> <b>service</b> and their policies.|$|E
50|$|Within <b>the</b> National <b>Park</b> <b>Service,</b> {{authority}} to designate or affiliate with a cooperating association {{is assigned to}} the regional directors and cannot be re-delegated. In the case of organizations serving multiple regions, which includes Eastern National and Western National <b>Parks</b> Association, <b>the</b> Director of <b>the</b> National <b>Park</b> <b>Service</b> signs <b>the</b> agreements. In the fiscal year 2008, 71 associations operated more than 100 outlets in 325 units of <b>the</b> National <b>Park</b> <b>Service.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> National <b>Park</b> <b>Service</b> Organic Act (or simply [...] "the Organic Act" [...] within <b>the</b> National <b>Park</b> <b>Service,</b> conservationists, etc.) is a United States {{federal law}} that {{established}} <b>the</b> National <b>Park</b> <b>Service</b> (NPS), an agency of the United States Department of the Interior. The Act {{was signed into law}} on August 25, 1916, by President Woodrow Wilson, and is located in Title 16 of the United States Code.|$|R
50|$|The Old Administration Building at Bryce Canyon National Park, {{also known}} as the Bryce Canyon Nature Museum, was <b>the</b> first National <b>Park</b> <b>Service</b> {{building}} built within <b>the</b> <b>park.</b> Located near Sunrise Point in a heavily used portion of <b>the</b> <b>park,</b> <b>the</b> building was designed by <b>the</b> National <b>Park</b> <b>Service</b> Branch of Plans and Designs in <b>the</b> National <b>Park</b> <b>Service</b> Rustic style preferred at <b>the</b> time for <b>park</b> structures. It is in the immediate vicinity of the Bryce Inn.|$|R
5|$|Limited {{by their}} need for water, trees such as willows, alders, and ponderosa pines are found only near the monument's streams or springs. Serviceberry bushes and shrubs like {{mountain}} mahogany are found in places where moisture collects near rock slides and ledges. Elsewhere long-rooted rabbitbrush has adapted to survive in dry areas. Other shrubs with adaptive properties include greasewood, sagebrush, shadscale, broom snakeweed, antelope bitterbrush, and purple sage. Western junipers, which have extensive root systems, thrive in the dry climate; {{in the absence of}} periodic fires they tend to displace grasses and sagebrush and to create relatively barren landscapes. <b>The</b> <b>Park</b> <b>Service</b> is considering controlled burning to limit the junipers and to create open areas for bunchgrasses that re-sprout from their roots after a fire.|$|E
5|$|More recently, preservationists persuaded Congress to {{designate}} , or about 89% of the park, as the Yosemite Wilderness—a highly protected wilderness area. <b>The</b> <b>Park</b> <b>Service</b> has reduced artificial inducements {{to visit the}} park, such as the Firefall, in which red-hot embers were pushed off a cliff near Glacier Point at night. Traffic congestion in Yosemite Valley {{during the summer months}} has become a concern. Two electric buses commenced service in September 1995. The buses are quiet and do not emit pollutants. Eventually, all the buses in Yosemite will be electric.|$|E
5|$|Sunnyside walk-in campground, {{better known}} as Camp 4, was built in 1929. Rock climbers, who started to scale the cliffs of Yosemite in the 1950s, camped there. In 1997, a flood in Yosemite Valley {{destroyed}} employee housing in the valley. <b>The</b> <b>Park</b> <b>Service</b> wanted to build dormitories next to Camp 4, but Tom Frost, the American Alpine Club and others succeeded in killing the plan. Camp 4 was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on February 21, 2003, because of {{its role in the}} development of rock climbing as a sport.|$|E
50|$|The West Entrance Station at Glacier National Park {{was built}} by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1942. An example of <b>the</b> National <b>Park</b> <b>Service</b> Rustic style, it was {{designed}} by <b>the</b> National <b>Park</b> <b>Service</b> Branch of Plans and Design.|$|R
50|$|Under a 2014 edict from <b>the</b> National <b>Park</b> <b>Service,</b> model {{aircraft}} and other unmanned aircraft operations are prohibited on all land administered by <b>the</b> National <b>Park</b> <b>Service,</b> with some exceptions for preexisting {{model aircraft}} fields that were established {{prior to the}} adoption of this rule. Because <b>the</b> National <b>Park</b> <b>Service</b> does not have jurisdiction over airspace, which is exclusively governed by the FAA, this rule only applies to unmanned aircraft flown from National <b>Park</b> <b>Service</b> land. It does not apply to overflight of National <b>Park</b> <b>Service</b> land by unmanned aircraft operated elsewhere.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> National <b>Park</b> <b>Service</b> 100th Anniversary Commemorative Coin Act would {{direct the}} Secretary of the Treasury to mint and issue gold, silver, and half-dollar clad coins in {{commemoration}} of the 100th anniversary of the establishment of <b>the</b> National <b>Park</b> <b>Service</b> (NPS).|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>park</b> <b>service</b> gave {{priority}} {{to life and}} property {{in their efforts to}} suppress the fires. Of the more than 1,000 structures located in the park, only 67 were destroyed. There were 400 structures in the Old Faithful complex and only 19 of these were destroyed, 12 of which were concessionaire housing units and relatively inexpensive to replace. Major tourist locations in the park such as the one at Old Faithful were heavily staffed by fire fighting crews and equipment, especially at times of immediate danger. Fire fighters used a variety of methods to establish safe zones in and near these complexes, yet every single visitor complex was evacuated by non-critical personnel at least once during the fires.|$|E
5|$|The site of Pickett's Charge {{is one of}} the best-maintained {{portions}} of the Gettysburg Battlefield. Despite millions of annual visitors to Gettysburg National Military Park, very few have walked in the footsteps of Pickett's division. The National Park Service maintains a neat, mowed path alongside a fence that leads from the Virginia Monument on West Confederate Avenue (Seminary Ridge) due east to the Emmitsburg Road {{in the direction of the}} Copse of Trees. Pickett's division, however, started considerably south of that point, near the Spangler farm, and wheeled to the north after crossing the road. In fact, <b>the</b> <b>Park</b> <b>Service</b> pathway stands between the two main thrusts of Longstreet's assault—Trimble's division advanced north of the current path, while Pickett's division moved from farther south.|$|E
5|$|Visitors {{are allowed}} to snowshoe and do {{cross-country}} skiing and are not restricted to trails. The Teton Park Road between the Taggart Lake trailhead to Signal Mountain Campground is closed to vehicular traffic during the winter and {{this section of the}} road is groomed for skiing and snowshoeing traffic. <b>The</b> <b>park</b> <b>service</b> offers guided snowshoe tours daily from the main headquarters located in Moose, Wyoming. Overnight camping is allowed in the winter in the backcountry with a permit and visitors should inquire about avalanche dangers.|$|E
50|$|Mandatory {{appropriations}} {{are those}} items created by other congressional legislation {{that must be}} paid for. They include the Recreational Fee Demonstration Program, which requires the distribution and expenditure of fees collected by <b>the</b> National <b>Park</b> <b>Service.</b> Other Permanent Appropriations includes special funding categories to non-profit and state entities, which have been assigned to <b>the</b> National <b>Park</b> <b>Service</b> to manage. Miscellaneous Trust Funds includes funding sources that have been created {{by the federal government}} or private citizen, where <b>the</b> National <b>Park</b> <b>Service</b> or a specific park have been identified as the beneficiaries. And there is also the L&WCF Contract Authority which is the Land and Water Conservation Fund, a congressionally created source of revenues, managed by <b>the</b> National <b>Park</b> <b>Service.</b>|$|R
50|$|Bebb's {{original}} design {{consisted of a}} massive stone tower topped by a circular platform and fire observation cab, and accessed by a concrete ramp. Fred Arnold, head of <b>the</b> <b>park</b> <b>service's</b> Forest and Wildlife Protection branch, rejected {{the inclusion of the}} fire observation cab, arguing that while Clingmans Dome was the highest point in <b>the</b> <b>park,</b> it wasn't particularly useful for fire detection purposes. <b>Park</b> <b>service</b> director Conrad Wirth objected to the use of a ramp, favoring instead a spiral staircase. After John B. Cabot, head of <b>the</b> <b>park</b> <b>service's</b> Eastern Office of Design and Construction, convinced him of the ramp's usefulness, Wirth decided the stone tower would not be necessary, stating a single central support column would suffice.|$|R
25|$|The bill to dam Hetch Hetchy passed Congress in 1913, {{and so the}} Sierra Club {{lost its}} first major battle.
