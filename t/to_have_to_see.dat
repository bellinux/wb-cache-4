Coming within sound of them she had already spoken, and she took again, through her long-handled glass, all her amused and amusing possession. [...] "How much, poor Mr. Strether, you seem <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> about! But you can't say," [...] she gaily declared, [...] "that I don't do what I can to help you.

60|$|When {{the letter}} was completed, the two lawyers went away, and Cousin Henry was left to his own meditation. He {{sat there for a}} while, so astounded by the {{transaction}} of the morning as to be unable to collect his thoughts. All this that had agitated him so profoundly for the last month had been set at rest by the finding of the will. There was no longer any question as to what must be done. Everything had been done. He was again a London clerk, with a small sum of money besides his clerkship, and the security of lowliness into which to fall back! If only they would be silent;--if only it might be thought by his fellow-clerks in London that the will had been found by them without any knowledge on his part,--then he would be satisfied. A terrible catastrophe had fallen upon him, but one which would not be without consolation if with the estate might be made to pass away from him all responsibilities and all accusations as to the estate. That terrible man had almost promised him that a way of retreat should be made easy to him. At any rate, he would not be cross-examined by Mr Cheekey. At any rate, he would not be brought to trial. There was almost a promise, too, that as little should be said as possible. There must, he supposed, be some legal form of abdication on his part, but he was willing to execute that as quickly as possible on the simple condition that he should be allowed to depart without being forced to speak further on the matter to any one in Wales. Not <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the tenants, not to have to say even a word of farewell to the servants, not to be carried into Carmarthen,--above all, not to face Mr Cheekey and the Court,--this was all he asked now from a kind Fate.|$|E

6000|$|She told Nick that Lady Agnes had {{not been}} willing to disturb him at his work to say good-bye, knowing she should see him {{in a day or}} two in town. He was amused at the way his mother had stolen off--as if she feared further {{conversation}} might weaken the spell she believed herself to have wrought. The place was cleared, moreover, of its other visitors, so that, as Mrs. Gresham said, the fun was at an end. This lady expressed the idea that the fun was after all rather a bore. At any rate now they could rest, Mrs. Dallow and Nick and she, and she was glad Nick was going to stay for a little quiet. She liked Harsh best when it was not en fête: then one could see what a sympathetic old place it was. She hoped Nick was not dreadfully fagged--she feared Julia was completely done up. Julia, however, had transported her exhaustion to the grounds--she was wandering about somewhere. She thought more people would be coming to the house, people from the town, people from the country, and had gone out so as not <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> them. She had not gone far--Nick could easily find her. Nick intimated that he himself was not eager for more people, whereupon Mrs. Gresham rather archly smiled. [...] "And of course you hate me for being here." [...] He made some protest and she added: [...] "But I'm almost part of the house, you know--I'm one of the chairs or tables." [...] Nick declared that he had never seen a house so well furnished, and Mrs. Gresham said: [...] "I believe there are to be some people to dinner; rather an interference, isn't it? Julia lives so in public. But it's all for you." [...] And after a moment she added: [...] "It's a wonderful constitution." [...] Nick at first failed to seize her allusion--he thought it a retarded political reference, a sudden tribute to the great unwritten instrument by which they were all governed and under the happy operation of which his fight had been so successful. He was on the point of saying, [...] "The British? Wonderful!" [...] when he gathered that the intention of his companion had been simply to praise Mrs. Dallow's fine robustness. [...] "The surface so delicate, the action so easy, yet the frame of steel." ...|$|E
6000|$|It was {{of giving}} herself away just {{enough not to}} spoil for me my bargain over my {{treasure}} that Mrs. Briss's bribe would consist. She would let me see as far as I would if she could feel sure I would do nothing; and it was exactly in this {{question of how much}} I might have scared my couple into the sense I could [...] "do" [...] that the savour of my suspense most dwelt. I could have made them uneasy, of course, only by making them fear my intervention; and yet the idea of their being uneasy was less wonderful than the idea of my having, with all my precautions, communicated to them a consciousness. This was so the last thing I had wanted to do that I felt, during my swift excursion, how much time I should need in the future for recovery of the process--all of the finest wind-blown intimations, woven of silence and secrecy and air--by which their suspicion would have throbbed into life. I could only, provisionally and sketchily, figure it out, this suspicion, as having, little by little--not with a sudden start--felt itself in the presence of my own, just as my own now returned the compliment. What came back to me, as I have said, in waves and wider glimpses, was the marvel of their exchange of signals, the phenomenon, scarce to be represented, of their breaking ground with each other. They both had their treasure to guard, and they had looked to each other with the instinct of help. They had felt, on either side, the victim possibly slip, and they had connected the possibility with an interest discernibly inspired in me by this personage, and with a relation discoverably established by that interest. It wouldn't have been a danger, perhaps, if the two victims hadn't slipped together; and more amazing, doubtless, than anything else was the recognition by my sacrificing couple of the opportunity drawn by my sacrificed from being conjoined in my charity. How could they know, Gilbert Long and Mrs. Briss, that actively to communicate a consciousness to my other friends had no part in my plan? The most I had dreamed of, I could honourably feel, was to assure myself of their independent possession of one. These things were with me while, as I have noted, I made Grace Brissenden wait, and it was also with me that, though I condoned her deviation, she must take it from me as a charity. I had presently achieved another of my full revolutions, and I faced her again with a view of her overture and my answer to her last question. The terms were not altogether what my pity could have wished, but I sufficiently kept everything together <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that there were limits to my choice.
