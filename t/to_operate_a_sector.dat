40|$|We {{investigate}} {{trade and}} financial openness {{in a small}} developing country where entrepreneurs need bank financing <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> in <b>an</b> import-competing <b>sector</b> but banks do not observe their ability. This informational asymmetry causes adverse selection of low-ability individuals into entrepreneurship and also prevents poor but able individuals from being entrepreneurs.

Trade opening reduces an income gap {{between the rich and}} the poor, while financial opening affects this income gap ambiguously.
