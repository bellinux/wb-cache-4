5|$|Forensic {{evidence}} on the package eventually leads to Bardale, and then to The Judge. The Judge is arrested for questioning, and knowing {{that there is not}} enough evidence to warrant sentencing him, he offers Black a job with him. Black refuses, but The Judge is released. Bardale is incensed that <b>The</b> <b>Judge</b> <b>has</b> manipulated the law to his own ends, and passes sentence on him for hypocrisy. Finding Bardale alone in a farmhouse, Black discovers that the convict had fed The Judge to his pigs.|$|E
5|$|When the {{government}} seeks to burden a person's protected liberty interest or property interest, the Supreme Court has held that procedural due process requires that, at a minimum, {{the government}} provide the person notice, {{an opportunity to}} be heard at an oral hearing, and a decision by a neutral decision maker. For example, such process is due when a government agency seeks to terminate civil service employees, expel a student from public school, or cut off a welfare recipient's benefits. The Court has also ruled that the Due Process Clause requires judges to recuse themselves in cases where <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> <b>has</b> a conflict of interest. For example, in Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co. (2009), the Court ruled that a justice of the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia had to recuse himself from a case involving a major contributor to his campaign for election to that court.|$|E

25|$|Depending {{on whether}} <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> <b>has</b> {{determined}} that the election was valid or void, the election return is confirmed or altered. If the election is declared void, the President is empowered to order that another election {{be held in the}} electoral division concerned within one month of the determination. If the election of one MP in a GRC is determined to be void, the election of the other MPs for that constituency is also void.|$|E
25|$|In terms section 176(1) of the Constitution, {{judges of}} the Constitutional Court serve for a non-renewable term of 12 years or {{until they reach}} the age of 70, {{whichever}} is earlier; but these limits may be extended by an Act of Parliament. Section 4 of the Judges Remuneration and Conditions of Employment Act 47 of 2001 has extended the term limit to an effective term of 15 years including prior service on other courts: the effect is that judges who had served more than 3 years before their appointment to the Constitutional Court retain a 12-year term limit; {{those who did not}} have a longer tenure. The same section extends the retirement age to 75. However, in terms of section 3(2)(b), if <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> <b>has</b> already been a judge (in any court) for 15 years by the time she reaches the age of 65, she may voluntarily retire.|$|E
500|$|If a {{defendant}} {{at the time}} of trial claims he is insane, this hinges on whether or not he is able to understand the charge, the difference between [...] "guilty" [...] and [...] "not guilty" [...] and is able to instruct his lawyers. If he is unable to do these things, he can be found [...] "unfit to plead" [...] under Section 4 of the Criminal Procedure (Insanity) Act 1964. In that situation, <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> <b>has</b> wide discretion as to {{what to do with the}} defendant, except in cases of murder, where he must be detained in hospital.|$|E
50|$|Robert Wilson, {{a teacher}} and later principal, was {{likewise}} convicted of acts of cruelty involving vulnerable children but was cleared on appeal {{on the basis that}} <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> <b>had</b> made an error in his summing-up.

2500|$|On August 9, Justice Williams severed the charges, {{splitting}} {{them into}} {{one group of}} six counts and another group of 20 counts. The trial proceeded on the group of six counts. The remaining 20 counts could have been heard in a separate trial, but ultimately were stayed on August 4, 2010. [...] Because of the publication ban, full details of the decision are not publicly available; but <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> <b>has</b> explained that trying all 26 charges at once would put an unreasonable burden on the jury, as the trial could last up to two years, and have an increased chance for a mistrial. The judge also added that the six counts he chose had [...] "materially different" [...] evidence from the other 20.Office [...] of Inspector General Senior Investigator R.J. McDougald was case agent for the investigation.|$|E
2500|$|Clinton {{voted against}} the {{confirmation}} of John Roberts as Chief Justice of the United States, saying [...] "I {{do not believe that}} <b>the</b> <b>Judge</b> <b>has</b> presented his views with enough clarity and specificity for me to in good conscience cast a vote on his behalf," [...] but then said she hoped her concerns would prove to be unfounded. Roberts was confirmed by a solid majority, with half the Senate's Democrats voting for him and half against. She joined with about half of the Democratic Senators in support of the filibuster against the nomination of Samuel Alito to the United States Supreme Court, and subsequently voted against his confirmation along with almost all Democratic members of the Senate. On the Senate floor, Clinton said Alito would [...] "roll back decades of progress and roll over when confronted with an administration too willing to flaunt [...] the rules and looking for a rubber stamp." [...] Alito was confirmed in a vote split largely along party lines.|$|E

2500|$|Where {{a statute}} grants a power for a {{particular}} purpose, it is unlawful for the decision-maker to exercise that power for another purpose or to frustrate {{the object of the}} statute by exercising the power. The purpose for which the power was conferred is a question of law to be determined by the court by construing the statute as a whole. <b>The</b> <b>judge</b> <b>has</b> to place himself in the position of the statute's draftsman and [...] "ascertain what facts were within the draftsman's knowledge, and what statutory objectives he had both generally and as to the particular provision to be construed". After doing so, the judge will {{be in a position to}} read the statutory language in its [...] "primary and most natural sense which it bears in its context". In general, the court may not refer to the statement of a minister set out in Hansard (reports of parliamentary debates) concerning the scope of a statutory power, unless the minister has given [...] "a categorical assurance to Parliament that a power would not be used in a given situation, such that Parliament could be taken to have legislated on that basis," [...] which is unlikely to happen.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{conditions}} of probation and supervised release, such as compliance with drug tests, are made mandatory by statute, {{while others are}} optional. Some terms are recommended by the United States Sentencing Guidelines for specific situations; for instance, a requirement of participation in a mental health program is recommended when [...] "the court has {{reason to believe that}} the defendant is in need of psychological or psychiatric treatment." [...] <b>The</b> <b>judge</b> <b>has</b> broad discretion in deciding what optional conditions to impose, as long as those conditions are reasonably related to the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant, the need for the sentence imposed to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct, the need to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant, the need to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner; and involve no greater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably necessary for these purposes and are consistent with any pertinent policy statements issued by the United States Sentencing Commission. The possible length of supervision is specified by law, with recommendations for particular situations being provided by the sentencing guidelines. The length and {{conditions of}} supervision can be modified by the court after sentencing, although the defendant has a right to a hearing if changes are being proposed that would adversely affect him/her.|$|E
2500|$|One {{finds that}} the Legislation has not {{indicated}} {{what is meant by}} 'fair and reasonable,' what is the model or criterion by which fairness and reasonableness are to be determined. It is to be regretted that the Legislature has not given a definition of the words. It is the function of the Legislature, not of the Judiciary, to deal with social and economic problems; [...] it is for the Judiciary to apply, and, when necessary, interpret the enactments of the Legislature. But here this whole controversial problem, with its grave social and economic bearings, has been committed to a judge, who is not, at least directly, responsible, and who ought not to be responsible to public opinion. even if the delegation of duties should be successful in this case, it by no means follows that it will be so hereafter. I do not protest against the difficulty of the problem, but against the confusion of functions and against the failure to define, the shunting of legislative responsibility. It would be almost as reasonable to tell a Court to do what is 'right' with regard to real estate, and yet lay down no laws or principles for its guidance. In the course of the long discussion of this case, I have been convinced that the President of this Court is put in a false position. The strength of the Judiciary in the public confidence is largely owing to the fact that <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> <b>has</b> not to devise great principles of action as between great classes, or to lay down what is fair and reasonable between contending interests in the community; but has to carry out mandates of the Legislature evolved out of the conflict of public opinion after debate in Parliament. I venture to think that it will not be found wise to bring the judicial department within the range of political fire....|$|E
