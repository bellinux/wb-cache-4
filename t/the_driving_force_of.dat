By that time, he had substantial experience with Soviet literature and literature administration. The Soviets hoped that Cho would shape the cultural {{institutions of the}} new state based on the Soviet model. For the Soviets, the move was successful and Cho did not only that but also significantly developed socialist realism as it would become <b>the</b> <b>driving</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> North Korean literature and arts.|$|E

Simon Parkin of Eurogamer found that the story suffers without <b>the</b> <b>driving</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> Lightning's single-minded determination. VanOrd {{was disappointed}} that Lightning and Caius Ballad have relatively limited screen-time, since they come off as stronger characters than the protagonists.|$|E
5|$|St. John's, and the {{province}} as a whole, was gravely affected in the 1990s {{by the collapse}} of the northern cod fishery, which had been <b>the</b> <b>driving</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> the provincial economy for hundreds of years. After a decade of high unemployment rates and depopulation, the city's proximity to the Hibernia, Terra Nova and White Rose oil fields led to an economic boom that spurred population growth and commercial development. As a result, the St. John's area now accounts for about half of {{the province}}'s economic output.|$|E

5|$|In 1847 Swillington, to the {{south-east}} of Leeds, {{was still}} a rural community, although mining was starting to assert itself as <b>the</b> <b>driving</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> the local economy. Woodford was still the Provincial Grand Chaplain in Durham, while completing structural work on his church in Yorkshire. It was not until 1854 that he joined Philanthropic Lodge No 382 (now 304). The next year he was appointed Provincial Grand Chaplain for West Yorkshire. He was master of Philanthropic in 1856 and 1858, and the lodge history asserts that it thrived {{during the years of}} his regular attendance. He re-wrote their ritual in a unique form, which was shared with five daughter and granddaughter lodges.|$|E
5|$|When {{thermoplastics}} are moulded, typically pelletised {{raw material}} is fed through a hopper into a heated barrel with a reciprocating screw. Upon {{entrance to the}} barrel, the temperature increases and the Van der Waals forces that resist relative flow of individual chains are weakened {{as a result of}} increased space between molecules at higher thermal energy states. This process reduces its viscosity, which enables the polymer to flow with <b>the</b> <b>driving</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> the injection unit. The screw delivers the raw material forward, mixes and homogenises the thermal and viscous distributions of the polymer, and reduces the required heating time by mechanically shearing the material and adding a significant amount of frictional heating to the polymer. The material feeds forward through a check valve and collects {{at the front of the}} screw into a volume known as a shot. A shot is the volume of material that is used to fill the mould cavity, compensate for shrinkage, and provide a cushion (approximately 10% of the total shot volume, which remains in the barrel and prevents the screw from bottoming out) to transfer pressure from the screw to the mould cavity. When enough material has gathered, the material is forced at high pressure and velocity into the part forming cavity. To prevent spikes in pressure, the process normally uses a transfer position corresponding to a 95–98% full cavity where the screw shifts from a constant velocity to a constant pressure control. Often injection times are well under 1 second. Once the screw reaches the transfer position the packing pressure is applied, which completes mould filling and compensates for thermal shrinkage, which is quite high for thermoplastics relative to many other materials. The packing pressure is applied until the gate (cavity entrance) solidifies. Due to its small size, the gate is normally the first place to solidify through its entire thickness. Once the gate solidifies, no more material can enter the cavity; accordingly, the screw reciprocates and acquires material for the next cycle while the material within the mould cools so that it can be ejected and be dimensionally stable. This cooling duration is dramatically reduced by the use of cooling lines circulating water or oil from an external temperature controller. Once the required temperature has been achieved, the mould opens and an array of pins, sleeves, strippers, etc. are driven forward to demould the article. Then, the mould closes and the process is repeated.|$|E

25|$|During {{the period}} 1916–1932, the {{discipline}} of population genetics developed largely through {{the work of the}} geneticists Ronald Fisher, J.B.S. Haldane, and Sewall Wright.
