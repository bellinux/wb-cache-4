25|$|The usual {{intravenous}} dose is 10–20 mEq {{per hour and}} it is given slowly since it takes time for the electrolyte <b>to</b> <b>equilibrate</b> into the cells. When used in state-sanctioned lethal injection, bolus potassium injection affects the electrical conduction of heart muscle. Elevated potassium, or hyperkalemia, causes the resting electrical potential of the heart muscle cells to be lower than normal (less negative). Without this negative resting potential, cardiac cells cannot repolarize (prepare for their next contraction).|$|E

25|$|In the {{presence}} of an alkyl halide the carbanion can also undergo nucleophilic substitution with carbon-carbon bond formation. In substituted aromatic compounds an electron-withdrawing substituent, such as a carboxylic acid, stabilizes a carbanion and the least-substituted olefin is generated. With an electron-donating substituent the opposite effect is obtained. The reaction produces more of the less thermodynamically stable non-conjugated 1,4-addition product than the more stable conjugated 1,3-diene because the largest orbital coefficient of the HOMO of the conjugated pentadienyl anion intermediate is on the central carbon atom. Once formed, the resulting 1,4-cyclohexadiene is unable <b>to</b> <b>equilibrate</b> to the thermodynamically more stable product; therefore, the observed kinetic product is produced. Experimental alkali metal alternatives that are safer to handle, such as the M-SG reducing agent, also exist.|$|E
25|$|Hammond's {{postulate}} {{is especially}} important {{when looking at the}} rate-limiting step of a reaction. However, one must be cautious when examining a multistep reaction or one with the possibility of rearrangements during an intermediate stage. In some cases, the final products appear in skewed ratios in favor of a more unstable product (called the kinetic product) rather than the more stable product (the thermodynamic product). In this case one must examine the rate-limiting step and the intermediates. Often, the rate-limiting step is the initial formation of an unstable species such as a carbocation. Then, once the carbocation is formed, subsequent rearrangements can occur. In these kinds of reactions, especially when run at lower temperatures, the reactants simply react before the rearrangements necessary to form a more stable intermediate have time to occur. At higher temperatures when microscopic reversal is easier, the more stable thermodynamic product is favored because these intermediates have time to rearrange. Whether run at high or low temperatures, the mixture of the kinetic and thermodynamic products eventually reach the same ratio, one in favor of the more stable thermodynamic product, when given time <b>to</b> <b>equilibrate</b> due to microreversal.|$|E

40|$|The {{activity}} of a vapor-phase disinfectant is usually {{expressed in terms}} of the atmospheric relative humidity (RH). This study shows that, in β-propiolactone (BPL) vapor disinfection, the important factor is really the moisture content and location of water in the cell, and not necessarily the atmospheric RH. Previous studies revealed that only about 50 % of the bacterial spores <b>equilibrated</b> <b>to</b> 45 % RH were killed when exposed to the same RH to BPL vapor. On the other hand, all the spores <b>equilibrated</b> <b>to</b> and then exposed at 75 % RH to BPL were readily killed.

40|$|I {{study how}} {{regional}} populations respond to local labor demand shifts by quantifying how {{the collapse of}} Finnish-Soviet trade in early 1990 s affected regional working-age populations in Finland.

I find that the more local employment focused on the production of Soviet exported goods, the more region’s share of total working-age population decreased in response to the shock. The demand shifts affected regions' de-mographic compositions as the reductions were driven by young and more educated people. The findings suggest that regional population responses contribute <b>to</b> <b>equilibrating</b> local labor markets after asymmetric labor demand shocks...|$|R

In the pH range 4 to 9, complexation of Al(III) by HEDPA significantly enhanced dissolution of boehmite. This phenomenon was especially pronounced in the neutral pH region where the solubility of aluminum, {{in the absence of}} complexants, is limited by the formation of sparsely soluble aluminum hydroxides. At high pH levels, dissolution of synthetic boehmite was inhibited by HEDPA, likely due to sorption of Al(III) /HEDPA complexes. Addition of HEDPA <b>to</b> <b>equilibrated</b> U(VI) -synthetic boehmite suspensions yielded an increase in the aqueous phase uranium concentration.

40|$|Abstract: Markov chain Monte Carlo {{methods are}} very popular for {{computing}} expectations. Their efficiency and reliability {{are subject to}} two significant drawbacks. The first is the correlation between successive samples. This reduces efficiency and frustrates variance estimation. The second drawback is the dependence on starting values, which leads to discarding a large initial set of “atypical ” samples. The process of running the Monte Carlo method until getting an adequate starting value is called equilibration. Associated with this are two practical problems. One is to detect the onset of equilibration so that production may begin. The other is to characterize what it means <b>to</b> be <b>equilibrated</b> so {{that there might be}} a better understanding of how to initialize the equilibration process to reduce its running time. This article examines the statistical error of Monte Carlo method and proposes a definition of what it means <b>to</b> be <b>equilibrated,</b> which corresponds exactly to what is needed in practice and which is amenable to mathematical analysis...|$|R
