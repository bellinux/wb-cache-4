40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the possible mechanism and the clinical significance of transient atrioventricular block (AVB) during dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE). BACKGROUNDTransient AVB occurs rarely during DSE; however, the mechanisms responsible for blocks are unclear. METHODSA retrospective analysis of clinical, echocardiographic, catheterization, revascularization and head-up <b>tilting</b> <b>test</b> data was conducted in patients who developed transient AVB during DSE. RESULTSA total of 302 patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) underwent DSE before coronary angiography between November 1997 and August 1998. Transient AVB developed in 12 patients during the test. Mobitz I block was noted in six patients and Mobitz II block in the other six patients. Nine of these 12 patients were subsequently shown to have CAD and three had no significant coronary artery stenosis. Mobitz II block was observed only in patients with CAD, while Mobitz I block occurred in three patients with and three patients without CAD (p < 0. 05). Eight of the nine patients with CAD underwent a successful coronary angioplasty with or without stenting and a repeat DSE revealed no recurrence of heart block except in one patient. Head-up <b>tilting</b> <b>test</b> in the 12 patients revealed a positive response in three of the nine patients with and all three patients without CAD. A negative head-up <b>tilting</b> <b>test</b> was likely to be observed in patients with, as compared with those without, CAD in this study population (p < 0. 05). CONCLUSIONSTransient AVB is not an infrequent manifestation during DSE. Both myocardial ischemia and neurally mediated vagal reflex may be responsible for this phenomenon. The development of Mobitz II block during DSE is indicative of the presence of CAD. A successful revascularization in patients with CAD who develop transient AVB may abolish this phenomenon...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{usefulness}} of esmolol {{in predicting the}} efficacy of treatment with an oral beta-adrenergic blocking agent was evaluated in 27 consecutive patients with neurocardiogenic syncope. Seventeen patients had a positive head-up <b>tilt</b> <b>test</b> response at baseline and 10 patients required intravenous isoproterenol for provocation of hypotension. All patients were then given a continuous esmolol infusion (500 μg/kg per min loading dose for 3 min followed by 300 μg/kg per min maintenance dose) and rechallenged with a head-up <b>tilt</b> <b>test</b> at baseline or with isoproterenol. Of the 17 patients with a positive baseline <b>tilt</b> <b>test</b> response, 11 continued {{to have a positive}} response to esmolol challenge. Sixteen patients (including all 10 patients with a positive <b>tilt</b> <b>test</b> response with isoproterenol) exhibited a negative response to upright tilt during esmolol infusion. Irrespective of their response to esmolol infusion, all patients had a follow-up <b>tilt</b> <b>test</b> with oral metoprolol after an interval of ≥ 5 half-lives of the drug. All 16 patients (100 %) with a negative <b>tilt</b> <b>test</b> response during esmolol infusion had a negative <b>tilt</b> <b>test</b> response with oral metoprolol. Of the 11 patients with a positive <b>tilt</b> <b>test</b> response during esmolol infusion, 10 (90 %) continued to have a positive response with oral metoprolol. It is concluded that in the electrophysiology laboratory, esmolol can accurately predict the outcome of a head-up tilt response to oral metoprolol. This information may be helpful in formulating a therapeutic strategy at the initial head-up <b>tilt</b> <b>test</b> in patients with neurocardiogenic syncope...|$|R
40|$|Background: Syncope is an {{important}} and common clinical condition, and the neurally mediated syncope is the most frequent type of syncope. <b>Tilt</b> <b>testing</b> is considered as a first-line diagnostic test. Materials and Methods: We conducted the conventional and modified <b>tilt</b> <b>test</b> on 200 subjects in the age range of 5 - 20 years. In conventional protocol, the patient was tilted for up to 15 min without medication. If syncope did not develop, the patient received 0. 1 mg/kg sublingual isosorbide dinitrate. Then, the patient was continued to be tilted for another 15 min. In modified <b>tilt</b> <b>test,</b> before starting the test, the patient received 0. 1 mg/kg isosorbide dinitrate sublingually in supine position. Then, the table was tilted for a maximum of 25 min or until the test became positive. Results: In conventional <b>tilt</b> <b>test</b> group 79. 13 % and in modified <b>tilt</b> <b>test</b> group 87. 06 % of subjects showed positive results. In conventional <b>tilt</b> <b>test,</b> the mean of response time was 17. 67 ± 4. 74 min. The mean of the total time of conventional <b>tilt</b> <b>test</b> was 49. 81 ± 5. 57 min.

Furthermore, the means of both response and total times between two groups were significantly different (P < 0. 001). Conclusions: Our study showed that we can save about 15 - 20 min in total test time which may increase the cooperation and compliance of young patients and decrease their anxiety with this new protocol...|$|R
40|$|Objectives. This {{study was}} {{designed}} to prospectively evaluate the long-term outcome of drug therapy guided by head-up <b>tilt</b> <b>testing</b> for the management of unexplained syncope and near syncope. Background. Head-up <b>tilt</b> <b>testing</b> is used to evaluate patients with unexplained syncope. The validity of acute drug testing and the efficacy of long-term oral therapy for prevention of recurrent syncope have not been investigated in large patient groups. Methods. We studied 296 consecutive patients with unexplained syncope or near syncope who underwent 80 ° head-up <b>tilt</b> <b>testing</b> with and without isoproterenol challenge. The efficacy of intravenous and oral beta-blocker therapy was evaluated by repeat testing. Patients with both positive and negative responses to therapy were followed up for rates of recurrence of syncope. Results. A total of 193 patients (65 %) had a positive <b>tilt</b> <b>test</b> response; 89 % of these 193 required isoproterenol challenge to elicit this response. Patients with a positive <b>tilt</b> <b>test</b> result had lower values for heart rate at rest (mean ± SD 69 ± 13 vs. 74 ± 14 beats/min, p = 0. 046) and systolic blood pressure (137 ± 28 vs. 145 ± 30 mm Hg, p = 0. 0018) at baseline than did the patients with a negative <b>tilt</b> <b>test</b> result. Intravenous propranolol blocked the positive response in 163 (90 %) of 181 patients retested. Oral beta-blockers were effective by <b>tilt</b> <b>test</b> criteria in 118 (94 %) of 125 patients; 12 (10 %) had recurrent clinical symptoms while taking beta-blockers. Eight (42 %) of 19 patients who had a negative <b>tilt</b> <b>test</b> response during beta-blocker therapy had recurrent symptoms when they stopped therapy. Three (23 %) of 13 patients receiving empiric beta-blocker therapy had recurrent symptoms. The follow-up period for the patients with a positive <b>tilt</b> <b>test</b> result was 28 ± 11 months (range 5 to 48). Conclusions. Intravenous propranolol is effective in preventing neurocardiogenic syncope diagnosed during head-up <b>tilt</b> <b>testing</b> and predicts the response to oral beta-blocker therapy. Oral beta-blocker therapy prevents recurrent syncope in the majority of patients. Recurrence of syncope is lowest when efficacy of oral beta-blocker therapy is confirmed by repeat head-up <b>tilt</b> <b>testing...</b>|$|R
40|$|The correct {{assessment}} of the interfacial properties between the geosynthetic surfaces in composite liner systems, as landfill covers, {{is an important issue}} to prevent the occurrence of potential slip surfaces. Inclined Plane tests, using a Tilting Plane, are the most suitable tests for monitoring interface behaviour under low normal effective stress level. According to recent studies, the test procedure, ruled by the European Standard EN ISO 12957 - 2, could overestimate the interface friction angle between the geosynthetic surfaces. An original dual interpretation of this kind of test was recently proposed by the second and third authors: a complete understanding of a <b>tilting</b> <b>test</b> is based on the monitoring of the tangential displacement and/or of the force during the complete test. This new approach includes a light modification of the standard device. “Force Procedure” consists in measuring the force required to hold back the upper box.

40|$|The {{responses}} to orthostasis of fluid-electrolyte and endocrine indicators in persons subject and {{not subject to}} fainting during tilting are investigated, along {{with the effects of}} heat acclimatization and physical training on those responses. Plasma volume and electrolytes and plasma vasopressin and renin activity were determined in tilt-table tests conducted before and after an eight-day period of daily heat acclimation during exercise at 50 % maximal oxygen uptake at 40 C, or a control period of exercise at 24 C. Half of the 10 subjects in the study, regardless of exercise regime, showed improved orthostatic reactions in the second <b>tilting</b> <b>test,</b> related to increases in post-tilt plasma volume and potassium concentration, particularly in the nonfainters. In the first test, plasma renin activity is observed to increase fivefold and plasma vasopressin 50 times after the transition from the supine to the orthostatic positions; the respective increases were reduced by 50 and 75 % in the second test. The fainters also exhibit a greater increase in vasopressin and a lower increase in renin activity upon tilting than the nonfainters. Results indicate the orthostatic-induced vasopressin increase to be related to volume control independent of renin activity...|$|E
40|$|Background: Juvenile myoclonic {{epilepsy}} (JME) {{is characterized}} by myoclonic seizures on awakening and giant somatosensory evoked potentials. Those characteristics suggest that JME is related with dysfunction of the brainstem reticular formation. Cardiovascular reflex is also closely related with the brainstem reticular formation, and head-up tilt-table test (HUT) is frequently employed to evaluate the cardiovascular reflex. We performed HUT to assess the cardiovascular reflex in patients with JME and syncope/presyncope. Methods: We included 52 patients with alleged JME. HUT was performed in 20 of them {{with a history of}} presyncope or syncope. The protocol of HUT included 70 degree table <b>tilting</b> <b>test</b> and isoproterenol infusion test (1 ~ 5 μg/min). We determined the positive responses according to the change of blood pressure and heart rate. The positive responses were classified as vasodepressive, cardioinhibitory, or mixed types. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical findings and responses of HUT. Results: Syncope or presyncope occurred during the seizure-prone situation in 3 (15 %), and during the syncope-prone situation in 17 (85 %) patients. Fifteen (75 %) patients had positive responses in HUT. The positive responses were during the baseline test in 1 (5 %), during the low dose (≤ 3 μg/min) of isoproterenol infusion in 10 (50 %), and during the high dose (≥ 4 μg/min) of isoproterenol infusion in the remaining 4 (20 %) patients.

In the present paper, numerical simulations {{of a series of}} laboratory experiments performed at the Laboratory for Rock Mechanics of the EPF Lausanne were undertaken with the RASH 3 D and DAN 3 D numerical codes. They aimed at analysing the possibility to use calibrated ranges of parameters (1) in a code different from that they were obtained from and (2) to simulate potential-events made of a material with the same characteristics as back-analysed past-events, but involving a different volume and propagation path. For this purpose, one of the four benchmark laboratory tests was used as past-event to calibrate the dynamic basal friction angle assuming a Coulomb-type behaviour of the sliding mass, and this back-analysed value was then used to simulate the three other experiments, assumed as potential-events. The computational findings show good correspondence with experimental results in terms of characteristics of the final deposits (i. e., runout, length and width).

40|$|Background: Characterized as {{a sudden}} and {{temporary}} loss of consciousness and postural tone, with quick and spontaneous recovery, syncope is caused by an acute reduction of systemic arterial pressure and, therefore, of cerebral blood flow. Unsatisfactory results with the use of drugs allowed the nonpharmacological treatment of neurocardiogenic syncope was contemplated as the first therapeutic option. Objectives: To compare, in patients with neurocardiogenic syncope, the impact of a moderate intensity aerobic physical training (AFT) and a control intervention on the positivity of head-up <b>tilting</b> <b>test</b> (HUT) and orthostatic tolerance time. Methods: Were studied 21 patients with a history of recurrent neurocardiogenic syncope and HUT. The patients were randomized into: trained group (TG), n = 11, and control group (CG), n = 10. The TG was submitted to 12 weeks of AFT supervised, in cycle ergometer, and the CG to a control procedure that consisted in 15 minutes of stretching and 15 minutes of light walk. Results: The TG had a positive effect to physical training, with a significant increase in peak oxygen consumption. The CG did not show any statistically significant change before and after the intervention. After the intervention period, 72. 7 % of the TG sample had negative results to the HUT, not having syncope in the revaluation. Conclusion: The program of supervised aerobic physical training for 12 weeks was able {{to reduce the number of}} positive HUT, as it was able to increase tolerance time in orthostatic position during the HUT after the intervention period.

The analytical model and the dynamic model show the same natural frequencies, which justifies that the system model was properly built in the software GT-Suite. The dynamic variables have been evaluated and it has been found out that both the dual mass flywheel and the hydro motor are safe to use, as long as the resonant frequencies are passed {{in a short period of}} time without letting the resonant peak torques build up. The critical dynamic torque value for the dual mass flywheel 480 Nm, and the critical pressure value for the hydro elements 360 bars are both not exceeded. In both cases the simulation results show that the values do not even exceed 200. The frequency analysis shows that the critical areas are between 0 - 100 RPM and 800 - 900 RPM, where the resonant frequencies cross with the engine RPM and create high torque and rotational speed amplitudes. Finally, the future steps regarding the project are discussed, where a suggestion has been made to improve the analytical model by adding extra masses and torsional stiffness, while it is stated that its possible and needed to build a full engine model in 1 -D to be able to properly evaluate the transient engine starting and stopping conditions...|$|E
40|$|Studies into {{rockfill}} {{have advocated}} {{the use of}} a <b>tilt</b> <b>test</b> to characterise the shear strength of coarse granular materials. The <b>tilt</b> <b>test</b> employs a simple split box, which is filled with rubble and then tilted until the upper box half slides off the lower box half. The angle at which this occurs is related to strength characteristics of the tested material, but the interpretation of this result is less than straight forward.

The results show that the <b>tilt</b> <b>test</b> is not a good discriminator of shear strength in waste rock materials. The <b>tilt</b> <b>test</b> is very sensitive to particle size, particle shape and relative density, but because of its very low confining stress, it is insensitive to the physical strength of particles.

Basal heart rate was higher in the diabetic group (87. 8 ± 11. 2 bpm; mean ± SD) than in the control group (72. 9 ± 7. 8 bpm, P< 0. 05). The increase of heart rate at 5 s of tilting was 11. 8 ± 6. 5 bpm in diabetic patients and 17. 6 ± 6. 2 bpm in the control group (P< 0. 05). Systemic arterial pressure and RSA analysis did not reveal significant differences between groups.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe study {{investigated}} the clinical significance and mechanism of orthostatic blood pressure (BP) dysregulation in elderly hypertensive patients. BackgroundAlthough orthostatic hypotension (OHYPO), often found in elderly hypertensive patients, has been recognized as {{a risk factor for}} syncope and cardiovascular disease, both the clinical significance and the mechanism of orthostatic hypertension (OHT) remain unclear. MethodsWe performed a head-up <b>tilting</b> <b>test</b> and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 241 elderly subjects with sustained hypertension as indicated by ambulatory BP monitoring. We classified the patients into an OHT group with orthostatic increase of systolic blood pressure (SBP) of ≥ 20 mm Hg (n = 26), an OHYPO group with orthostatic SBP decrease of ≥ 20 mm Hg (n = 23), and a normal group with neither of these two patterns (n = 192). ResultsSilent cerebral infarcts were more common in the OHT (3. 4 /person, p < 0. 0001) and OHYPO groups (2. 7 /person, p = 0. 04) than in the normal group (1. 4 /person). Morning SBP was higher in the OHT group than in the normal group (159 vs. 149 mm Hg, p = 0. 007), while {{there were no significant differences}} of these ambulatory BPs between the two groups during other periods. The OHT (21 mm Hg, p < 0. 0001) and OHYPO (20 mm Hg, p = 0. 01) groups had higher BP variability (standard deviation of awake SBP) than the normal group (17 mm Hg). The associations between orthostatic BP change and silent cerebrovascular disease remained significant after controlling for confounders, including ambulatory BP. The orthostatic BP increase was selectively abolished by alpha-adrenergic blocking, indicating that alpha-adrenergic activity is the predominant pathophysiologic mechanism of OHT. ConclusionsSilent cerebrovascular disease is advanced in elderly hypertensives having OHT. Elderly hypertensives with OHT or OHYPO may have an elevated risk of developing hypertensive cerebrovascular disease...|$|E
40|$|IntroductionAutonomic {{disorders}} {{have been}} recognized as important Parkinson’s disease (PD) components. Some vulnerable structures {{are related to the}} central autonomic network and have also been linked to autonomic function alterations. The aims of the study are to evaluate the severity of the autonomic dysfunction and the cortical hypoperfusion using arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI. And then, possible relationships of significant between-group differences in perfusion pattern to clinical variables and autonomic functions were examined to determine the pharmaceutical effects of dopaminergic treatment on cerebral blood flow (CBF) in patients with PD. MethodsBrain ASL MRI was carried out in 20 patients with PD (6 men and 14 women, mean age: 63. 3 [*]±[*] 6. 4 [*]years) and 22 sex- and age-matched healthy volunteers to assess whole-brain CBF and the effects of dopaminergic therapy on perfusion. All subjects underwent a standardized evaluation of cardiovagal and adrenergic function including a deep breathing, Valsalva maneuver, and 5 -min head-up tilt test. Perfusion MRI data were acquired on a 3. 0 [*]T scanner with a pulsed continuous ASL technique. The CBF, autonomic parameters, and clinical data were analyzed after adjusting for age and sex. ResultsPatients exhibited a decline in autonomic function (rapid heart rate in response to deep breathing, low baroreflex sensitivity, high systolic and diastolic pressure, and altered <b>tilting</b> <b>test</b> response), widespread low CBF, and robust response to dopaminergic therapy. Lower perfusion in the middle frontal gyrus was associated with increased clinical disease severity (Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale I score, P[*]<[*] 0. 001). Lower perfusion in autonomic control areas, such as the frontal lobe and insula, were significantly associated with autonomic impairment (P[*]<[*] 0. 001). ConclusionsOur study indicates that PD is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that changes the perfusion of central nervous system and is associated with variable autonomic dysfunctions. Neuronal loss and sympathetic activation may explain the interaction between cortical autonomic region perfusion and cardiovascular autonomic function...|$|E

In each case <b>tilt</b> <b>test</b> was negative after 6 weeks treatment and they all remained free of symptom during a follow up of 6 ± 1 months. Only 3 of the 8 patients in group B with positive <b>tilt</b> <b>testing</b> at the 6 th week were controlled with metoprolol. The circulating catecholamines levels at baseline and during <b>tilt</b> <b>testing</b> were not significantly different between patients successfully treated by metoprolol or disopyramide. The changes of the neurohormones were not different during disopyramide and metoprolol treatments.

Adenosine is an ATP derivative implicated in cardiovascular disturbances that occur during head-up <b>tilt</b> <b>test.</b> The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate the impact of hyperoxia on adenosine plasma level and on hemodynamic changes induced by head-up <b>tilt</b> <b>testing.</b> Seventeen healthy male volunteers (mean age 35 AE 11 years) were included in the study. The experiment consisted of 2 head-up <b>tilt</b> <b>tests,</b> 1 session with subjects breathing, through a mask, medical air (FiO 2 ¼ 21 %) and 1 session with administration of pure oxygen (FiO 2 ¼ 100 %) in double-blind manner. Investigations included continuous monitoring of hemodynamic data and measurement of plasma adenosine levels. No presyncope or syncope was found in 15 of the 17 volunteers. In these subjects, a slight decrease in systolic blood pressure was recorded during orthostatic stress performed under medical air exposure. In contrast, hyperoxia led to increased systolic blood pressure during orthostatic stress when compared with medical air. Furthermore, mean adenosine plasma levels decreased during hyperoxic exposure before (0. 31 AE 0. 08 mM) and during head-up <b>tilt</b> <b>test</b> (0. 33 AE 0. 09 mM) when compared with baseline (0. 6 AE 0. 1 mM). Adenosine plasma level was unchanged during medical air exposure at rest (0. 6 AE 0. 1 mM), and slightly decreased during orthostatic stress. In 2 volunteers, the head-up <b>tilt</b> <b>test</b> induced a loss of consciousness when breathing air. In these subjects, adenosine plasma level increased during orthostatic stress. In contrast, during hyperoxic exposure, the head-up <b>tilt</b> <b>test</b> did not induce presyncope or syncope. In these 2 volunteers, biological study demonstrated a decrease in adenosine plasma level at both baseline and during orthostatic stress for hyperoxic exposure compared with medical air. These results suggest that hyperoxia was able to increase blood pressure during head-up <b>tilt</b> <b>test</b> via a decrease in plasma adenosine concentration. Our results also suggest that adenosine receptor antagonists are worth trying in neurocardiogenic syncope.

The age difference {{between males and females}} was statistically significant (P = 0. 002). The response to the diagnostic <b>tilt</b> <b>test</b> was: type 1 (mixed) in 74 patients; type 2 A (cardioinhibitory and bradycardia) in 6; type 2 B (cardioinhibitory and asystole) in 61; type 3 (vasodepressor) in 81. In all 222 patients the diagnostic <b>tilt</b> <b>test</b> was positive after 19 +/- 11 min (mean+/-SD), median time: 18 min. For the four types of syncope, the duration in minutes of the diagnostic <b>tilt</b> <b>test</b> was: type 1 (mixed) 19. 5 +/- 11. 4; type 2 A (cardioinhibitory) 24. 8 +/- 13. 6; type 2 B (cardioinhibitory and asystole) 14. 7 +/- 10. 2; type 3 (vasodepressor) 21. 6 +/- 11. 1. A significant difference was found between type 2 B and type 3 responses (P = 0. 002). Between males and females no significant differences in the duration of the diagnostic <b>tilt</b> <b>test</b> were found, neither for all responses, nor for the four subtypes. A type 2 B (cardioinhibitory and asystole) response occurred in 61 patients. The duration of asystole was 12. 8 +/- 10. 6 s (mean+/-SD; median 9, minimum 3, maximum 60). The head-up <b>tilt</b> <b>test</b> was repeated day after day: one session per day. The response became negative at the second session in 119 patients (54 %); at session 3 in 47 (21 %); at session 4 in 30 (13 %); at session 5 in 15 (7 %); at session 6 in 6 (3 %); at session 7 in 2 (1 %); at session 8 in 3 (1 %).

40|$|Objective. The head-up <b>tilt</b> <b>test</b> {{is widely}} used for {{evaluation}} of orthostatic intolerance. Although orthostatic symptoms usually reflect cerebral hypoperfusion, the cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFv) profile in orthostatic syndromes is not well described. This study evaluated CBFv and cardiovascular patterns associated with the <b>tilt</b> <b>test</b> in common orthostatic syndromes. Methods. This retrospective study analyzed the <b>tilt</b> <b>test</b> of patients with history of orthostatic intolerance. The following signals were recorded: ECG, blood pressure, CBFv using transcranial Doppler, respiratory signals, and end tidal CO 2. Results. Data from 744 patients were analyzed. Characteristic pattern associated with a particular orthostatic syndrome can be grouped into abnormalities predominantly affecting blood pressure (orthostatic hypotension, orthostatic hypertension syndrome, vasomotor oscillations, and neurally mediated syncope—cardioinhibitory, vasodepressor, and mixed), cerebral blood flow (orthostatic hypoperfusion syndrome, primary cerebral autoregulatory failure), and heart rate (tachycardia syndromes: postural tachycardia syndrome, paroxysmal sinus tachycardia, and inappropriate sinus tachycardia). Psychogenic pseudosyncope is associated with stable CBFv. Conclusions. The <b>tilt</b> <b>test</b> is useful add-on in diagnosis of several orthostatic syndromes. However diagnostic criteria for several syndromes had to be modified to allow unambiguous pattern classification. CBFv monitoring in addition to blood pressure and heart rate may increase diagnostic yield of the <b>tilt</b> <b>test...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background: There is {{debate about}} the {{advantages}} of different protocols usefulness of <b>tilt</b> <b>test</b> for the diagnosis of vasovagal collapse. Aim: To compare the sensitivity, specificity, adverse reactions, complications and time requirements of two different <b>Tilt</b> <b>test</b> protocols. Material and Methods: A <b>Tilt</b> <b>test</b> using isoproterenol in progressive doses (2 &# 956;g for 10 min and 5 &# 956;g for 5 min posteriorly was performed in 159 patients aged 9 to 84 years (59 males). Another <b>Tilt</b> <b>test</b> using sublingual nitroglycerine in doses of 0. 3 mg was performed in 201 patients aged 8 to 87 years (62 males). Also, 20 healthy volunteers were tested. Results: The positivity rates of the tests using isoproterenol and nitroglycerin were 75. 5 and 77. 6 % respectively (NS). The figures for sensitivity were 98. 4 and 99. 3 % (NS). The figures for specificity were 93. 2 and 98. 4 % (NS). The test using isoproterenol requires 15 more minutes. As adverse reactions, 38 % of participants experienced palpitations with isoproterenol and 22 % experienced headache with nitroglycerin.

40|$|Background: A {{systematic}} evaluation {{focused on}} {{sensitivity and specificity}} of head-up <b>tilt</b> <b>testing</b> (HUT) for diagnosing vasovagal syncope has not been previously performed. We conducted a meta-analysis of studies comparing HUT outcome between patients with syncope of unknown origin and control subjects without previous syncope. Methods: We searched Pubmed and Embase databases for all English-only articles concerning case-control studies estimating the diagnostic yield of HUT, and selected 55 articles, published before March 2012, including 4361 patients and 1791 controls. The influence of age, <b>test</b> duration, <b>tilt</b> angle, and nitroglycerine or isoproterenol stimulation on <b>tilt</b> <b>testing</b> outcome was analyzed. Results: Head-up <b>tilt</b> <b>testing</b> demonstrated {{to have a good}} overall ability to discriminate between symptomatic patients and asymptomatic controls with an area under the summary receiver-operating characteristics curve of 0. 84 and an adjusted diagnostic odds ratio of 12. 15 (p < 0. 001). A significant inverse relationship between sensitivity and specificity of <b>tilt</b> <b>testing</b> for each study was observed (p < 0. 001). At multivariate analysis, advancing age and a 60 ° tilt angle showed a significant effect in reducing sensitivity and increasing specificity of the test. Nitroglycerine significantly raised <b>tilt</b> <b>testing</b> sensitivity by maintaining a similar specificity in comparison to isoproterenol. Conclusions: The results from this meta-analysis show the high overall performance of HUT for diagnosing vasovagal syncope. Our findings provide useful information for evaluating clinical and instrumental parameters together with pharmacological stressors influencing HUT accuracy. This could allow the drawing of <b>tilt</b> <b>testing</b> protocols tailored on the diagnostic needs of each patient with unexplained syncope...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to assess the {{cardiovascular}} autonomic function and responses to <b>tilt</b> <b>test</b> in young and elderly patients with syncope of unknown origin. We evaluated two groups of patients with previous unexplained syncope: 192 older subjects (112 males, 80 females, mean age 67. 2 +/- 6. 8 years) and 188 young subjects (102 males, 86 females, mean age 25 +/- 9 years). All patients underwent ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring, to evaluate time domain indices of heart rate variability (HRV), and head-up <b>tilt</b> <b>test</b> in the morning after an overnight fast. The responses of positive <b>tilt</b> <b>test</b> were classified using the VAsovagal Syncope International Study (VASIS) criteria: mixed (VASIS- 1), cardioinhibition (VASIS- 2 A), severe cardioinhibition/asystole (VASIS- 2 B), pure vasodepression (VASIS- 3). All the time-domain HRV indexes were lower in the older than in young subjects. The rate of positive responses was not different in the two groups. In elderly group the positive head-up <b>tilt</b> <b>test</b> responses showed: a pure vasodepressive response (VASIS 3) in 126 patients (65 %), a mixed (VASIS- 1) response in 25 patients (13 %), a cardioinhibitory (VASIS- 2 A) response in 13 patients (7 %). Only 28 (14. 6 %) of elderly group patients had negative head-up <b>tilt</b> <b>test</b> response. In contrast, in young group the positive head-up <b>tilt</b> <b>test</b> responses showed: 114 patients (61. 2 %) a mixed (VASIS- 1) vasovagal response, 40 patients (22. 3 %) a cardioinhibitory (VASIS- 2 A) response, four (2. 1 %) patients a severe cardioinhibitory (VASIS- 2 B) and four (2. 1 %) patients a pure vasodepression (VASIS- 3) response, respectively. The <b>tilt</b> <b>test</b> was negative in response in 26 young patients (12. 2 %). Our results confirm that the head-up <b>tilt</b> <b>test</b> may be useful in assessing unexplained syncope, since it is seen to be positive in 85 % of elderly patients and 86 % in young patients. In our subjects, vasodepressive response was the most frequent cause of syncope in older subjects, while vasovagal response is the commonest cause of syncope of young patients. This different behaviour in the elderly may be is explained with physiological aging, which is associated with a reduction of sympathetic-parasympathetic control on the cardiac rhythm, demonstrated by reduction in all the time domain HRV indices...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectives. A {{double-blind}} randomised {{trial was}} designed to determine the efficacy of intravenous and oral disopyramide phosphate in preventing neurally syncope induced by a head-up <b>tilt</b> <b>test.</b> Background. Neurally mediated syncope is a frequent cause of syncope and may be induced by head-up <b>tilt,</b> <b>testing.</b> Recent uncontrolled trials have suggested that disopyramide may be an effective therapy in patients with neurally mediated syncope. Methods. Twenty-two consecutive patients with recurrent neurally mediated syncope and two or successive positive head-up <b>tilt</b> <b>test</b> responses were randomly allocated to receive either intravenous disopyramide or placebo. Head-up <b>tilt</b> <b>testing</b> at 60 ° was performed for 15 min. If presyncope or syncope was not provoked, isoproterenol infusion was started {{at a rate of}} 1 μg/min and the rate gradually increased until a 25 % increase in heart rate was achieved. Eleven patients were subsequently randomised in crossover fashion to receive oral disepyramide (800 mg/day) or placebo during 1 week. The primary end point was prevention of syncope or presyncope provoked by head-up <b>tilt</b> <b>testing.</b> Results. Head-up <b>tilt</b> <b>test</b> results were positive for syncope in 12 (75 %) of 16 patients receiving intravenous placebo and in 12 (60 %) of 20 patients receiving disopyramide (p = 0. 55 Fisher exact test, 95 % confidence interval [CI] − 14 % to 40 %). In the intravenous phase, complete crossover was achieved in 15 patients. Head-up <b>tilt</b> <b>test</b> results during this were positive in 13 patients (87 %) receiving placebo and in 12 patients (80 %) receiving disopyramide (p = 0. 50 Fisher exact test, 95 % CI − 19 % to 32 %) and were positive in all patients receiving their initially randomized drug or placebo. In the oral phase, head-up tilt results were positive in only two patients (18 %) assigned to placebo and in three patients (27 %) receiving disopyramide (p = 0. 54 Fisher exact test, 95 % CI − 42 % to 24 %). A mean follow-up time of 29 ± 8 months was obtained in 21 of the 22 patients. Syncope recurred in 3 (27 %) of the 11 patients receiving disopyramide and 3 (30 %) of the 10 patients not treated pharmacologically (p > 0. 05). Conclusions. Intravenous disopyramide was ineffective for the prevention of neurally mediated syncope provoked by head-up <b>tilt</b> <b>testing.</b> No significant effect was observed after oral therapy with disopyramide. There was a striking decrease in the incidence of positive <b>tilt</b> <b>test</b> results over time regardless of intervention, thus discouraging the use of head-up tilt as the single method of assessing therapeutic efficacy. Recurrence of syncope after the investigative protocol was infrequent over long-term follow-up regardless of treatment group...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The {{incidence}} of postflight orthostatic intolerance after short-duration spaceflight is about 20 %. How-ever, the incidence after long-duration spaceflight was unknown. The {{purpose of this}} study was to test the hypothesis that orthostatic intolerance is more severe after long-duration than after short-duration flight. Methods: We performed <b>tilt</b> <b>tests</b> on six astronauts before and after long-duration (129 – 190 days) spaceflights and compared these data with data obtained during stand tests before and after previous short-duration missions. Results: Five of the six astronauts studied became presyncopal during <b>tilt</b> <b>testing</b> after long-duration flights. Only one had become presyncopal during stand testing after short-duration flights. We also compared the long-duration flight <b>tilt</b> <b>test</b> data to <b>tilt</b> <b>test</b> data from 20 different astronauts who flew on the short-duration Shuttle missions that delivered and recovered the astronauts to and from the Mir Space Station. Five of these 20 astronauts became presyncopal on landing day. Heart rate responses to tilt were no different between astronauts on long-duration flights and astronauts on short-duration flights, but long-duration subjects had lower stroke volumes and cardiac outputs than short-duration presyncopal subjects, suggesting a possible decrease in cardiac contractile function. One subject had subnormal norepinephrine release with upright posture after the long flight but not after the short flight. Plasma volume losses were not greater after long flights. Conclusion: Long-duration spaceflight markedly increases orthostatic intolerance, probably with multiple contributing factors.

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} the clinical characteristics of subgroups {{of patients with}} unexplained syncope having electrophysiologic studies and head-up <b>tilt</b> <b>testing</b> and to assess the efficacy of various therapies. Design: Retrospective study. Setting: Inpatient services of a tertiary referral center. Patients: Eighty-six consecutively referred patients with unex-plained syncope. Measurements: All patients had electrophysiologic examinations. Patients with negative results subsequently had head-up <b>tilt</b> <b>testing.</b> Main Results: Twenty-nine (34 %) patients (group 1) had abnor-mal electrophysiologic results, with sustained monomorphic ven-tricular tachycardia induced in 72 %. Thirty-four (40 %) patients (group 2) had syncope provoked by head-up <b>tilt</b> <b>testing.</b> The cause of syncope remained unexplained in 23 (26 %) patients (group 3). Structural heart disease was present in 76 %, 6 %, and 30 % of groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. In group 1, pharmacologic or nonpharmacologic therapy was recommended based on electro-physiologic evaluation. All group 2 patients had negative results on head-up <b>tilt</b> <b>testing</b> while receiving oral beta blockers (27 patients) or disopyramide (7 patients). Group 3 patients did not receive any specific therapy. During a median follow-up period of 18. 5 months, syncope recurred in 9 (10 %) patients.
