50|$|A {{single thread}} {{filament}} is too thin {{to use on}} its own, so Thai women combine many threads <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>a</b> thicker, usable fiber.

The process is a tedious one as it takes nearly 40 hours <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>a</b> half kilogram of Thai silk.|$|R
5|$|A {{combination}} of favorable geographical features {{contributed to the}} success of ancient Egyptian culture, the most important of which was the rich fertile soil resulting from annual inundations of the Nile River. The ancient Egyptians were thus able <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>an</b> abundance of food, allowing the population to devote more time and resources to cultural, technological, and artistic pursuits. Land management was crucial in ancient Egypt because taxes were assessed based on the amount of land a person owned.|$|E

5|$|Although U.S. {{copyright}} law {{would have allowed}} him <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>an</b> unauthorized adaptation, Mansfield secured the American and British stage rights. Performing in Boston, he asked a local friend, Thomas Russell Sullivan, to write a script.

Although he doubted that the novella would make a good play, he agreed to help Mansfield with the project, and they worked quickly to complete the adaptation before other, unauthorized versions could be staged.|$|E
5|$|Because of its durability, {{titanium}} {{has become}} more popular for designer jewelry (particularly, titanium rings). Its inertness makes it {{a good choice for}} those with allergies or those who will be wearing the jewelry in environments such as swimming pools. Titanium is also alloyed with gold <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>an</b> alloy that can be marketed as 24-carat gold because the 1% of alloyed Ti is insufficient to require a lesser mark. The resulting alloy is roughly the hardness of 14-carat gold and is more durable than pure 24-carat gold.|$|E
