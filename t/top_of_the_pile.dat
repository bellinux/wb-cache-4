25|$|The EZ {{series of}} flat-6-cylinder engines, used in current Legacy products, {{replaced}} the EG series {{found in the}} Subaru SVX. Subaru has produced high-performance versions of the Legacy with a Bilstein suspension and tuned turbocharged engines equivalent to the homologated rally version WRX STI (generating 205kW (275hp) on manufacturer's figures for the 2.0L equivalent engine with manual transmission). Recent 3.0L engines move close to the 2.0L turbo output and share the Bilstein suspension. 2.0L-engined turbocharged models with the Bilstein suspension were named either the GT-B (for wagons), or Spec B, or B4-RSK (for sedans). The new 2003 model moved many models to simply B4 or even GT in some countries. In Australia, the 2.5GT (SatNav) marks the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pile</b> for the Legacy/Liberty range.|$|E
25|$|UDDTs with {{a single}} vault have {{interchangeable}} containers to collect the fecal material. Depending {{on the size of}} the vault, two or more containers can be stored inside. Containers should be limited to a maximum volume of approximately 50 litres, so that they still can be manually moved when they fill up. Once a container is full, it can be left for further dehydration or removed for further treatment. Removal of the container requires care due to fresh, potentially pathogen-loaded feces being on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pile</b> in the container. Because of the limited ventilation within a plastic bucket, such single-vault UDDTs may not reduce the pathogen load as effectively as double-vault UDDTs. Therefore, a post-treatment of the fecal material is usually required. This can be achieved through further dehydration, composting processes or heat treatments.|$|E

25|$|In Indonesia, sweet {{potatoes}} are locally known as ubi jalar (lit: spreading tuber) and are frequently fried with batter {{and served as}} snacks with spicy condiments, along with other kinds of fritters such as fried bananas, tempeh, tahu, breadfruits, or cassava. In the mountainous regions of West Papua, {{sweet potatoes}} are the staple food among the natives there. Using the bakar batu way of cooking (free translation: burning rocks), rocks that have been burned in a nearby bonfire are thrown into a pit lined with leaves. Layers of sweet potatoes, an assortment of vegetables, and pork are {{piled on top of}} the rocks. The <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pile</b> then is insulated with more leaves, creating a pressure of heat and steam inside which cooks all food within the pile after several hours.|$|E
25|$|After an {{incredible}} championship, which saw the three favourites fail to {{even make the}} semi-final stage, Cork and Clare emerged at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pile</b> to contest the All-Ireland final. In front of a crowd of 81,651, Clare started brightly with early scores from Darach Honan and Colin Ryan. Clare led by 0-12 to 0-10 at the break, and they continued to bring a remarkable intensity to the contest, forcing the Rebels into errors, which they exploited with further scores from Tony Kelly and the unerring Ryan, who steered over his sixth free for a four-point lead. Cork were far from finished, however, and when Pa Cronin saw his chance, he picked his spot with an accurate finish to the net, and the sides were level going into the final five minutes. Patrick Horgan appeared to have won it for them with his tenth score in stoppage-time, {{but there was still}} time for Domhnall O'Donovan to pop up with a dramatic leveller in the 73rd minute.|$|E
500|$|Tulsidas came to Varanasi and {{recited the}} Ramcharitmanas to Shiva (Vishwanath) and Parvati (Annapurna) at the Kashi Vishwanath Temple. A popular legend goes that the Brahmins of Varanasi, who were {{critical}} of Tulsidas for having rendered the Sanskrit Ramayana in the Awadhi, decided {{to test the}} worth of the work. A manuscript of the Ramcharitmanas was kept {{at the bottom of}} pile of Sanskrit scriptures in the sanctum sanctorum of the Vishvanath temple in the night, and the doors of the sanctum sanctorum were locked. In the morning when the doors were opened, the Ramcharitmanas was found at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pile.</b> The words Satyam Shivam Sundaram (Sanskrit: सत्यं शिवं सुन्दरम्, literally [...] "truth, auspiciousness, beauty") were inscribed on the manuscript with the signature of Shiva. The words were also heard by the people present.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{buildings}} <b>of</b> Venice {{are constructed}} on closely spaced wooden piles.

2500|$|The first {{guided tours}} {{in the cave}} were in 1894 run by the Lynches. They lasted 8 hours and were by candle or lantern. Visitors climbed through the sink hole on a [...] ladder down to the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pile.</b> Then you were {{instructed}} to slide down the pile to the bottom. You received a candle to guide your way. The tours included the Egyptian Room (now the Shoe Room), the Lakes Passage, and you saw formations such as the Great White Throne (now the Liberty Bell), and the Spring Room Sentinel (now just the Sentinel). After the Hershends started tours in 1950, they removed the wooden stairs, and added concrete stairs and paths through the cave. Current tours last for about an hour, and are limited to 60 people.|$|E
2500|$|The high {{academic}} standing of the University of Virginia {{in a national}} publication has added to the competitiveness between the two. In 2003, University of Maryland president C.D. Mote asserted that, in academic terms, Virginia was [...] "highly overrated these days ... U.S. News & World Report places them at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pile</b> with Berkeley, which is ridiculous." [...] Mote further stated that students {{from the state of}} Maryland paying a higher tuition cost to attend the University of Virginia [...] "don’t know any better." [...] While the University of Virginia president, John Casteen, said such remarks can be taken out of context, Virginia board of visitors member, William H. Goodwin, responded in The Cavalier Daily, [...] "I certainly think a college president should have more class, but you have to expect that from Maryland." ...|$|E

2500|$|The stope, {{which is}} the {{workshop}} of the mine, is the excavation from which the ore is extracted. Two methods of stope mining are commonly used. In the [...] "cut and fill" [...] or open stoping method, the space remaining following removal of ore after blasting is filled with waste rock and cement. In the [...] "shrinkage" [...] method, only sufficient broken ore is removed via the chutes below to allow miners working from the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pile</b> to drill and blast the next layer to be broken off, eventually leaving a large hole. Another method, known as room and pillar, is used for thinner, flatter ore bodies. In this method the ore body is first divided into blocks by intersecting drives, removing ore while so doing, and then systematically removing the blocks, leaving enough ore for roof support.|$|E
2500|$|After Mike Morreale {{left the}} Tiger-Cats in free agency, the team moved Amerson to the slotback {{position}}. The change of position placed him consistently on the starting roster {{for the first}} time in his career. Amerson's first receiving touchdown of the season tied a July game against the Stampeders, which the Tiger-Cats later won 34–31 in overtime. Two weeks later, he caught nine passes for 221 yards against the Ottawa Renegades. By the beginning of August, Amerson had emerged as [...] "the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pile</b> of Hamilton Tiger-Cats receivers" [...] (ahead of Hall of Famer Darren Flutie) and was second in the league for receiving yardage. After an injury to starting running back Troy Davis in September, the Tiger-Cats utilized Amerson both as their starting slotback and backup running back, as they lacked a third-string running back. The majority of his production continued to come as a slotback. He recorded 147 receiving yards in the first game after being listed as a running back on the roster, including a touchdown catch in overtime to win 35–28 against the Montreal Alouettes.|$|E
2500|$|During My Life, Stark Hesseltine told Reeve that he {{had been}} asked to {{audition}} for the leading role as Clark Kent/Superman in the big budget film, Superman (1978). Lynn Stalmaster, the casting director, put Reeve's picture and résumé on the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pile</b> three separate times, only to have the producers throw it out each time. Through Stalmaster's persistent pleading, a meeting between director Richard Donner, producer Ilya Salkind, and Reeve was set in January 1977 at the Sherry Netherland Hotel on Fifth Avenue. The morning after the meeting, Reeve was sent a 300-page script. He was thrilled that the script took the subject matter seriously, and that Richard Donner's motto was verisimilitude. Reeve immediately flew to London for a screen test, and on the way was told that Marlon Brando was going to play Jor-El and Gene Hackman was going to play Lex Luthor. Reeve still did not think he had much of a chance. Though standing , he was a self-described [...] "skinny WASP." [...] On the plane ride to London, he imagined how his approach to the role would be. He later said, [...] "By the late 1970s, the masculine image had changed... Now it was acceptable for a man to show gentleness and vulnerability. I felt that the new Superman ought to reflect that contemporary male image." [...] He based his portrayal of Clark Kent on Cary Grant in his role in Bringing Up Baby. After the screen test, his driver said, [...] "I'm not supposed to tell you this, but you've got the part." ...|$|E

Donning the costume, he would play the {{suggested}} role. Occasionally, when the Tickle Trunk would not open, Mr. Dressup sang a song and tickled the lock, hence its name. The trunk appeared to be magic as it always had the right costumes, in the right sizes, neatly folded at <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>piles</b> <b>of</b> costumes. Occasionally Mr. Dressup would need to make an accessory for his costume, such as a hat, which {{would lead to a}} craft.|$|R
