25|$|The company {{finally found}} a buyer in 1978, when Family Radio, owner of KEAR, struck a deal to {{purchase}} the station for $1 million. In accordance with FCC ownership guidelines at the time, Family Radio sold their station at 97.3 MHz to CBS Inc. for $2 million, and CBS in turn sold their lower-powered station at 98.9 MHz to a small local company, Golden Gate Radio, for $850,000. Golden Gate Radio decided to adopt the KMPX call letters and format for 98.9MHz, at least temporarily. The <b>three-way</b> <b>switch</b> occurred in September 1978, with 106.9 becoming the new location of KEAR's religious format.|$|E
50|$|A <b>three-way</b> <b>switch</b> is used {{to split}} a {{railroad}} track into three divergent paths rather than the more usual two. There {{are two types of}} three-way switches. In a symmetrical <b>three-way</b> <b>switch,</b> the left and right branches diverge at the same place. In an asymmetrical <b>three-way</b> <b>switch,</b> the branches diverge in a staggered way. Both types of three-way switches require three frogs.|$|E
50|$|The {{complexity}} of symmetrical switches usually results in speed restrictions, therefore <b>three-way</b> <b>switches</b> {{are most often}} used in stations or depots where space is restricted and low speeds are normal. Symmetrical switches were used quite often on Swiss narrow-gauge railways. Asymmetrical <b>three-way</b> <b>switches</b> are more common, {{because they do not}} have speed restrictions compared to standard switches. However, because of their higher maintenance cost due to special parts as well as asymmetric wear, both types of <b>three-way</b> <b>switches</b> are replaced with two standard switches wherever possible.|$|R
50|$|In {{areas with}} very low speeds, like depots, and on railroads {{that had to}} be built very cheaply, like logging railroads, <b>three-way</b> <b>switches</b> were {{sometimes}} built as stub switches.|$|R

5000|$|There {{are usually}} two <b>three-way</b> <b>switches</b> {{near the top}} of the floor lamp to operate the bulbs. One {{controls}} the three-way center bulb, and the other turns on one, two, or all three (or four) of the peripheral bulbs. The center bulb may be very high power (often a three-way, 100-200-300 watt bulb), where the others are usually 60 watts or less. Some models have a night light in the base operated by a foot switch.|$|R

5000|$|Modeled {{after the}} Telecaster guitar, the Squier Vintage Modified Telecaster and Telecaster Special basses feature a Telecaster guitar-shaped {{basswood}} body, Telecaster-style control plate and a 32"-scale maple neck/fretboard with 20 frets. The Vintage Modified Telecaster Bass sports a Duncan Designed PB-102 SCPB single-coil pickup and <b>three-way</b> <b>switching</b> among special tone circuits, which feature a modern bass sound (middle switch position, volume and tone controls), softer [...] "double bass" [...] sound (neck switch position, volume control only) and authentic tic-tac [...] "baritone" [...] sound (bridge switch position, volume control only). The Telecaster Bass Special {{has a large}} chrome-covered Fender-designed Wide Range humbucking neck pickup paired with a Duncan Designed JB-102B single-coil Jazz Bass bridge pickup and <b>three-way</b> blade <b>switching.</b> Other features include black [...] "barrel" [...] switch tip, knurled chrome control knobs, vintage style bridge with four chrome saddles, vintage-style tuners and strap buttons and a single-ply white or black pickguard. Available in Black and White Blonde finishes. Introduced in August 2012.|$|R
50|$|A <b>three-way</b> <b>switch</b> from a Brisbane tram depot {{is shown}} on the left. It shows the typical double points (point blades) on each side, {{allowing}} for three diverging routes. The points at each rail can both be set to one side, resulting in a vehicle turning off the straight track. Alternatively, the two blades can be separated if the vehicle must continue along the straight track.|$|E
50|$|Possibly as payback {{for staying}} up later than her, the player's little sister has taken {{all of the}} trains and is sending freight cars down the line toward a <b>three-way</b> <b>switch</b> under the player's control.

50|$|During {{the late}} 1970s and early 1980s, many guitar {{companies}} tried {{to capitalize on}} Van Halen's popularity by manufacturing Frankenstrat replicas. In an attempt to mislead these companies, the guitarist installed a non-functional red single-coil pickup in the neck position of the Frankenstrat. To confuse imitators further, he also screwed a <b>three-way</b> <b>switch</b> into the empty middle-pickup slot on the guitar's body. Like the neck pickup, it was purely decorative.|$|E

50|$|During the 1950s, Gibson {{released}} the Super 400 CES (Cutaway•Electric•Spanish). This had a slightly thicker top to reduce feedback, two P-90 pickups, and individual tone and volume controls, {{along with a}} <b>three-way</b> toggle <b>switch.</b> Later, the P-90 pickups were replaced with Alnico V pickups, then in 1957, humbucking pickups.|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{possible}} micromechanism applications (e. g. <b>three-way</b> <b>switches,</b> mechanical {{memory and}} multiplex optical switches) {{could benefit from}} a device with three stable equilibrium positions. In this paper, we present {{a new class of}} tristable mechanisms called double tensural tristable mechanisms (DTTMs) which are fully compliant (i. e. they are monolithic and get their motion from the deflection of elastic components) and can be fabricated at the micro scale. A pseudo-rigid-body model (PRBM) for the DTTM has been developed. DTTMs were fabricated in polysilicon using the SUMMiT V process and tested for tristability and force–deflection characteristics. The results successfully demonstrate tristable behavior and show that the PRBM can be used to identify tristable configurations and predict their performance.

5000|$|In January 2013 Fender {{added the}} Carved Maple Top Jazzmaster HH to its premium Select series. The {{instrument}} features an alder {{body with a}} carved maple top, a pair of new Wide Range Special humbuckers controlled by a <b>three-way</b> <b>switch,</b> volume and tone (with push-pull S-1 switch), and an Adjusto-Matic bridge and tailpiece arrangement. It also features an innovative [...] "channel-bound" [...] rosewood fingerboard, in which the fingerboard itself is inlaid into the maple neck.|$|E
5000|$|Considered as the [...] "extra sporty" [...] {{version of}} the Honda Civic Ferio, the Honda Civic Ferio Vi-RS 1.5-litre, four-Door sedan was sold in the Japanese {{domestic}} market only. It has the 1.5-liter D15B three-stage VTEC, a five-speed manual or automatic transmission. The Civic Vi-RS had a <b>three-way</b> <b>switch</b> installed {{on the right side}} of steering wheel marked D, S1, or S2. These settings affected which cam was used, the ECU's air-fuel mapping, and gearbox behaviour (on automatics). S2 was the sportiest mode.|$|E
5000|$|The SG Standard {{features}} pearloid trapezoid fretboard inlays, {{as well as}} fretboard binding and inlaid pearl [...] "Gibson" [...] logo and crown; the SG Special features pearloid dot inlays and an inlaid pearl [...] "Gibson" [...] logo, no crown. The Standard has {{a volume}} and a tone control for each individual pickup, and a <b>three-way</b> <b>switch</b> that allows the player to select either the bridge pickup, the neck pickup, or both together. The SG does not include switching to coil split the humbuckers in stock form.|$|E
5000|$|Where {{there is}} more than one pickup, a pickup {{selector}} switch is usually present. These typically select or combine the outputs of two or more pickups, so that two-pickup guitars have <b>three-way</b> <b>switches,</b> and three-pickup guitars have five-way switches (a Gibson Les Paul three-pickup Black Beauty has a three-position toggle switch which configures bridge, bridge and middle in middle position and neck pickups). Further circuitry sometimes combines pickups in different ways. For instance, phase switching places one pickup out of phase with the other(s), leading to a [...] "honky", [...] "nasal", or [...] "funky" [...] sound. Individual pickups can also have their timbre altered by switches, typically coil tap switches that effectively short-circuit some of a dual-coil pickup's windings to produce a tone similar to a single-coil pickup (usually done with push-pull volume knobs).|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Secondary {{distribution}} networks generally {{perform as}} well as its LV feeders are performing. The main problem that a feeder is experiencing would be the load unbalancing due to the stochastic nature of its individual single-phase loads: larger losses in certain phases accompanied by bad voltage regulation and voltage unbalance. In order to address this problem, it may be economical to install apparatus to automatically balance or partially balance the loads progressing {{from the end of the}} feeder towards the front using smart devices based on a <b>three-ways</b> <b>switch</b> selector and an artificial intelligence algorithm to minimize the neutral current. The main idea behind this paper is therefore to keep the three phases progressively balanced along the whole length of the line.

Other refinements include a maple neck with a 9.5”-radius rosewood fingerboard, 22 medium-jumbo frets, 24"-scale length, a stop tailpiece and a <b>three-way</b> toggle <b>switch.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Before pan pots were available, [...] "a <b>three-way</b> <b>switch</b> {{was used}} to assign the track to the left output, right output, or both (the center)".

5000|$|The Standard {{model of}} the James Burton Telecaster was {{introduced}} in 1996 and features a solid alder body finished in Two-Tone-Sunburst or Candy Apple Red with a 1-ply white pickguard. This model was inspired by Burton's third guitar, the 1953 Telecaster that he played on the seminal 1957 recording of [...] "Susie Q" [...] with Dale Hawkins. [...] The neck is a 1-piece maple 1960s vintage U-shape design with a satin finish and 1950s-style decals. The hardware includes a vintage six-saddle Telecaster bridge, a pair of Texas Special Tele single-coil pick ups, a <b>three-way</b> <b>switch</b> and vintage chrome Ping tuners. This instrument is made in Mexico.|$|E
50|$|September 2010 saw the {{introduction}} of the Mexican-made Black Top Jazzmaster HS.
