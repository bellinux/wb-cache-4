5|$|The {{speed of}} sound in helium is nearly three times the {{speed of sound}} in air. Because <b>the</b> <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequency</b> of a {{gas-filled}} cavity is proportional to {{the speed of sound}} in the gas, when helium is inhaled there is a corresponding increase in the resonant frequencies of the vocal tract. <b>The</b> <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequency</b> (sometimes called pitch) does not change, since this is produced by direct vibration of the vocal folds, which is unchanged. However, the higher resonant frequencies cause a change in timbre, resulting in a reedy, duck-like vocal quality. The opposite effect, lowering resonant frequencies, can be obtained by inhaling a dense gas such as sulfur hexafluoride or xenon.|$|E
5|$|For {{the most}} part Cage avoids using lower {{registers}} of the piano, {{and much of the}} music's melodic foreground lies in the soprano range. Of the forty-five prepared notes, only three belong to the three lowest octaves below F#3: D3, D2 and D1. Furthermore, D2 is prepared {{in such a way that}} the resulting sound has the frequency of a D4 (resulting in two variants of D4 available, one more prepared than the other). The portion of the keyboard above F#3 is divided into roughly three registers: low, middle, and high. The low register has the heaviest preparation, and the high register the lightest. Different methods are used: certain notes produce sounds that retain the original frequency and a pianistic character; others become drum-like sounds, detuned versions of the original notes, or metallic, rattling sounds that have no sense of <b>the</b> <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequency</b> at all. The use of the soft pedal, which makes the hammers strike only two of the three strings of each note (or one, for notes with only two strings), complicates the matter further. For example, the note C5 is a metallic sound with no fundamental discernible when the soft pedal is depressed, but it sounds fairly normal if the pedal is released. It appears that Cage was fully aware of the implications of this: certain sonatas feature interplay between two versions of one note, others place special emphasis on particular notes, and still others are very dependent on particular note combinations.|$|E

25|$|A termite-bored didgeridoo has an {{irregular}} shape that, overall, usually increases in diameter towards the lower end. This shape means that its resonances occur at frequencies {{that are not}} harmonically spaced in frequency.

25|$|When {{confronted by}} a {{periodically}} varying function, the standard approach is to employ Fourier series, a form of analysis that uses sinusoidal functions as a basis set, having frequencies that are zero, one, two, three, etc. times the frequency of a particular fundamental cycle.

25|$|When the {{original}} sound sources are perfectly periodic, the note consists of several related sine waves (which mathematically add to each other) called the fundamental and the harmonics, partials, or overtones.

The overtones vibrate faster than the fundamental, but must vibrate at integer multiples of <b>the</b> <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequency</b> for the total wave to be exactly the same each cycle.

25|$|A flute {{produces}} {{sound when}} {{a stream of}} air directed across {{a hole in the}} instrument creates a vibration of air at the hole. The airstream creates a Bernoulli or siphon. This excites the air contained in the usually cylindrical resonant cavity within the flute. The flutist changes the pitch of the sound produced by opening and closing holes {{in the body of the}} instrument, thus changing the effective length of the resonator and its corresponding resonant frequency. By varying the air pressure, a flutist can also change the pitch by causing the air in the flute to resonate at a harmonic rather than <b>the</b> <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequency</b> without opening or closing any holes.|$|E

500|$|Covering or {{uncovering}} the tone holes varies {{the length of}} the pipe, changing the resonant frequencies of the enclosed air column and hence the pitch. A clarinetist moves between the chalumeau and clarion registers through use of the register key; clarinetists call the change from chalumeau register to clarion register [...] "the break". The open register key stops <b>the</b> <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequency</b> from being reinforced, and the reed is forced to vibrate at three times the speed it was originally. This produces a note a twelfth above the original note. Most instruments overblow at two times the speed of <b>the</b> <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequency</b> (the octave), but as the clarinet acts as a closed pipe system, the reed cannot vibrate at twice its original speed because it would be creating a 'puff' of air at the time the previous 'puff' is returning as a rarefaction. This means it cannot be reinforced and so would die away. The chalumeau register plays fundamentals, whereas the clarion register, aided by the register key, plays third harmonics (a perfect twelfth higher than the fundamentals). The first several notes of the altissimo range, aided by the register key and venting with the first left-hand hole, play fifth harmonics (a major seventeenth, a perfect twelfth plus a major sixth, above the fundamentals). The clarinet is therefore said to overblow at the twelfth and, when moving to the altissimo register, seventeenth. By contrast, nearly all other woodwind instruments overblow at the octave or (like the ocarina and tonette) do not overblow at all. A clarinet must have holes and keys for nineteen notes, a chromatic octave and a half from bottom E to B, in its lowest register to play the chromatic scale. This overblowing behavior explains the clarinet's great range and complex fingering system. The fifth and seventh harmonics are also available, sounding a further sixth and fourth (a flat, diminished fifth) higher respectively; these are the notes of the altissimo register. This is also why the inner [...] "waist" [...] measurement is so critical to these harmonic frequencies.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{dynamical}} parameters conventionally used {{to specify}} the orbit of a test particle in Kerr spacetime are the energy E, the axial component of the angular momentum, Lz, and Carter’s constant Q. These parameters are obtained by solving the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for the dynamical problem of geodesic motion. Employing the action-angle variable formalism, on the other hand, yields {{a different set of}} constants of motion, namely, <b>the</b> <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequencies</b> ωr, ωθ and ωφ associated with the radial, polar and azimuthal components of orbital motion. These frequencies, naturally, determine the time scales of orbital motion and, furthermore, the instantaneous gravitational wave spectrum in the adiabatic approximation. In this article, it is shown that <b>the</b> <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequencies</b> are geometric invariants and explicit formulas in terms of quadratures are derived. The numerical evaluation of these formulas {{in the case of a}} rapidly rotating black hole illustrates the behaviour of <b>the</b> <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequencies</b> as orbital parameters such as the semi-latus rectum p, the eccentricity e or the inclination parameter θ − are varied. The limiting cases of circular, equatorial and Keplerian motion are investigated as well and it is shown that known results are recovered from the general formulas...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{considers}} sparse {{modeling and}} estimation of multi-pitch signals, i. e., signals whose frequency content {{can be described}} by superpositions of harmonic, or close-to-harmonic, structures, characterized {{by a set of}} <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequencies.</b> As <b>the</b> number of <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequencies</b> in a given signal is in general unknown, this thesis casts the estimation as a sparse reconstruction problem, i. e., estimates of <b>the</b> <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequencies</b> are produced by finding a sparse representation of the signal in a dictionary containing an over-complete set of pitch atoms. This sparse representation is found by using convex modeling techniques, leading to highly tractable convex optimization problems from whose solutions the estimates of <b>the</b> <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequencies</b> can be deduced. In the first paper of this thesis, a method for multi-pitch estimation for stationary signal frames is proposed. Building on the heuristic of spectrally smooth pitches, the proposed method produces estimates of <b>the</b> <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequencies</b> by minimizing a sequence of penalized least squares criteria, where the penalties adapt to the signal at hand. An efficient algorithm building on the alternating direction method of multipliers is proposed for solving these least squares problems. The second paper considers a time-recursive formulation of the multi-pitch estimation problem, allowing for the exploiting of longer-term correlations of the signal, as well as <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequency</b> estimates with a sample-level time resolution. Also presented is a signal-adaptive dictionary learning scheme, allowing for smooth tracking of frequency modulated signals. In the third paper of this thesis, robustness to deviations from the harmonic model in the form of inharmonicity is considered. The paper proposes a method for estimating <b>the</b> <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequencies</b> by, in <b>the</b> frequency domain, mapping each found spectral line to a set of candidate <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequencies.</b> <b>The</b> optimal mapping is found as the solution to a minimimal transport problem, wherein mappings leading to sparse pitch representations are promoted. The presented formulation is shown to yield robustness to varying degrees of inharmonicity without requiring explicit knowledge of the structure or scope of the inharmonicity.
