5|$|Queen Mary 2 is a post-Panamax ship. As a result, Queen Mary 2 must {{circumnavigate}} South America {{to cross}} between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. The {{decision not to}} constrain her size to transit the Panama Canal was taken as Queen Elizabeth 2 only transited once a year, during the world cruise. Cunard decided <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>up</b> the convenience of the occasional passage in favour of a greater passenger capacity.|$|E
5|$|A {{collaboration}} between the Welland Rivers Trust, the Wild Trout Trust and the Environment Agency {{has resulted in the}} construction of a rock ramp, to allow migrating sea trout <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>up</b> the river beyond the weir on the Maxey Cut, which was acting as a barrier. Some 300 tons of rock, with 50 tons of finer material forming a top layer, were used to create the ramp. The finer material ensures that water mainly flows over the ramp, rather than through it. The ramp also enables young eels or elvers to move up the river, and provides habitat for stone loach and bullheads.|$|E
5|$|At 08:00, two {{formations}} 18 Bf 109s of I and III./JG 77, led by Major Siegfried Freytag, {{took off}} with their pathfinders. At the same time 23 Bf 109s of II./JG 77 took off. Around the Bocholt area they formed up {{with the other two}} Gruppen. Heading south and still north of Antwerp, JG 77 passed Woensdrecht airfield. It was home to No. 132 Wing RAF and its five Spitfire squadrons; No. 331 Squadron RAF, No. 332 Squadron RAF (Norwegian), No. 66 Squadron RAF and No. 127 Squadron RAF, and No. 322 Squadron RAF (Dutch). Some pilots from II./JG 77 either mistakenly believed it to be Antwerp, or thought the opportunity was too good <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>up.</b> Two German fighters were claimed shot down, and one pilot captured. However, none of the JG 77 casualties fit this description.|$|E
40|$|Sexual regret was {{investigated}} across two disparate cultures: Norway (N = 853), a highly secular and sexually liberal culture, and the United States (N = 466), a more religious and more sexually conservative culture. Sex differences, {{individual differences in}} preferred mating strategy, religiosity, and cultural differences in sexual regret were analyzed. Men were {{significantly less likely to}} regret having had casual sex than women and were significantly more likely <b>to</b> regret <b>passing</b> <b>up</b> casual sexual opportunities than women. Participants who were more religious regretted having had casual sex more and regretted <b>passing</b> <b>up</b> casual sex less. Sexually unrestricted participants were less likely to regret having had casual sex and were more likely <b>to</b> regret <b>passing</b> <b>up</b> casual sex. Finally, North Americans and Norwegians did not differ significantly in overall amount of sexual regret nor in patterns of sex differences in sexual regret. Discussion focuses the robustness of sex differences across cultures, the importance of explaining individual differences within cultures, and on future directions for cross-cultural research...|$|R

5|$|The end {{came first}} for Virginia. Because the {{blockade}} was unbroken, Norfolk was of little strategic {{use to the}} Confederacy, and preliminary plans were laid to move the ship up the James River to the vicinity of Richmond. Before adequate preparations could be made, the Confederate Army under Major General Benjamin Huger abandoned the city on May 9, without consulting anyone from the Navy. Virginias draft was too great to permit her <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>up</b> the river, which had a depth of only , and then only under favorable circumstances. She was trapped and could only be captured or sunk by the Union Navy. Rather than allow either, Tatnall decided to destroy his own ship. He had her towed down to Craney Island in Portsmouth, where the gang were taken ashore, {{and then she was}} set afire. She burned {{through the rest of the}} day and most of the following night; shortly before dawn, the flames reached her magazine, and she blew up.|$|E

25|$|In 1847 William Armstrong {{established}} a huge factory in Elswick, west of Newcastle.

50|$|Therefore, {{the most}} {{important}} future challenge concerning firms as well as advertising agencies is certainly {{a better understanding of}} the benefits of corporate socio-ecological responsibility in communications. Especially advertising agencies often lack the technical expertise to ensure that the communications of new sustainable messages are credible and fail to ensure that there is alignment between a client's corporate practices and external communications. This often leads <b>to</b> <b>passed</b> <b>up</b> marketing opportunities and hinders the creation of positive brand value. To overcome those barriers advertising agencies must gain expertise and experience in the fields of sustainable advertising, so the promotion of sustainability issues becomes part of a real corporate philosophy advertised through all communication channels.|$|R

25|$|However, after a {{successful}} rehabilitation, the next opportunity for Hadlee {{to claim the}} test wicket world record was against India in India in 1988.

25|$|After Maitland {{became ill}} in September, he was {{replaced}} in turn by Generals John Mackenzie, William Henry Clinton, James Campbell, and John Murray, 8th Baronet. The last-named general repulsed Suchet's attack at the Battle of Castalla on 13 April 1813, but the overcautious Murray withdrew after his victory. At the prompting of Wellington, Murray mounted a sea-borne attack in June. In the Siege of Tarragona, Murray's timidity caused him <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>up</b> {{a chance to}} conquer the weakly defended port. Fearing relief efforts by Suchet and General of Division David-Maurice-Joseph Mathieu de La Redorte, he ordered a hasty retreat, needlessly abandoning 18 heavy siege cannons.

25|$|The {{original}} {{bridge was}} owned by the Teignmouth and Shaldon Bridge Company and opened on 8 June 1827. It had 34 wooden arches and was 1,671 feet long, which made it the longest wooden bridge in England when built. It had abutment walls of a considerable length at either end, and a swing bridge at the Teignmouth end to allow sailing ships <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>up</b> the estuary. It cost around £19,000 to build, but the overall expenditure was about £26,000 due to {{the costs of the}} necessary Act of Parliament and the purchase of the old ferry-rights.

25|$|This valve allows fluids <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>up</b> or be pumped {{down the}} {{production}} tubing. When closed the DHSV forms a barrier {{in the direction}} of hydrocarbon flow, but fluids can still be pumped down for well kill operations. It is placed as far below the surface as is deemed safe from any possible surface disturbance including cratering caused by the wipeout of the platform. Where hydrates are likely to form (most production is at risk of this), the depth of the SCSSV (surface-controlled, sub-surface safety valve) below the seabed may be as much as 1km: this will allow for the geothermal temperature to be high enough to prevent hydrates from blocking the valve.|$|E
25|$|Middle class women oftentimes delay {{motherhood}} {{until after}} the peak of their fertility at age 29–30, a delay that has become {{more common in the}} last two decades.

25|$|However, Krause {{also made}} many picks {{that did not}} help the team. In 1986, Krause planned on {{selecting}} a tall forward named Brad Sellers in the NBA Draft. Sellers, Krause reasoned, was too good a pick <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>up,</b> as he handled the ball very well for a big man, and also had a solid outside jumper. Jordan, on the other hand, pushed management to take a two-way guard from Duke named Johnny Dawkins. It looked as though Krause would take Dawkins even {{as late as the}} morning of the draft; the coaches and players had {{made it clear that they}} wanted him and not Sellers, and Krause did not particularly have a problem with Dawkins' game. The Bulls' head coach at the time, Doug Collins, even told Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski the night before the draft that the team would pick Dawkins. However, Krause ignored everyone and picked Sellers anyway, and spent the summer trying to sell him to Jordan. Jordan went after Sellers mercilessly in practice, and Sellers was traded after three seasons. He played six total seasons in the NBA, averaging 6.3 points per game. Dawkins played for nine seasons in the NBA and averaged 11.1 points per game, though he did suffer from various injuries throughout his career.|$|E

25|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{the reason}} for employing keelmen was the poor state of the navigation on the Tyne and Wear, which prevented ships from moving up river without danger of grounding. As time went by this situation gradually worsened. Colliers arriving at the river mouth would have a ballast of sand {{that had to be}} disposed of. The correct method of doing this was to deposit the sand on specified areas on the riverbank provided for the purpose or by depositing the sand in the sea. The Wear had ballast keels that were used to unload the ballast from colliers and take it out to sea. There were penalties for depositing ballast in the river, but this often occurred. The result was that the riverbed became silted up, causing even more navigational difficulties. Additionally, industry on the riverbanks often deposited its waste products in the river. The situation on the Tyne became so bad that in 1850 the Tyne Navigation Act was passed, which gave control of the river to the Tyne Improvement Commission. This body began an extensive program of dredging to substantially deepen the riverbed. This program was completed in 1888 so that the largest colliers could pass right up to Newcastle and beyond. This deepening of the river meant that colliers could load coal from the staithes without the need for keels to complete the work. In 1876 the existing bridge at Newcastle was replaced by the Swing Bridge, which rotated to allow ships <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>up</b> and down river. This allowed colliers to be loaded from staithes above Newcastle and so further sealed the fate of the keelmen.|$|E
25|$|When Susan Richards {{experienced}} {{problems with}} her second pregnancy while Reed was away, Johnny contacted Doom for help, correctly guessing that Doom {{will be unable}} <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>up</b> a chance to succeed where Reed failed (due to the complex events involving the then-recent resurrection of Galactus, this pregnancy is a 'repeat' of an earlier one where Sue miscarried). Doom not only saves Sue's daughter but also cured Johnny of a recent problem with his powers where Johnny was unable to 'flame off' without technological support after becoming overcharged with energy from the Negative Zone by channeling Johnny's excess energy into Sue to keep her alive. After the birth, Doom's only apparent condition for his aid is that he be allowed to name Sue and Reed's daughter, calling her 'Valeria' after his long-lost love. However, this inspires a new plan where Doom makes Valeria his familiar while seeking out her namesake {{as part of a}} deal with a trio of demons; by sacrificing his old lover, Doom is granted magical powers on the level he would possess if he had spent the past years studying sorcery rather than science. With this new power, Doom trapped Franklin in Hell, immobilised Doctor Strange, and then neutralises the FF's powers, torturing the other three while taunting Reed by leaving him in his magical library, comparing it to giving a dog a road-map as he concluded that it would be impossible for Reed to master sufficient magical skill to be a threat to him. However, Reed was able to release Doctor Strange's astral self from Doom's traps, allowing Strange to give Reed a sufficient crash-course in magic for Reed to free {{the rest of the team}} and trick Doom into angering his demonic benefactors, prompting them to take him to Hell. Determined to ensure that Doom cannot be a further threat, Reed takes control of Latveria to dismantle all of Doom's equipment, simultaneously subtly driving his family away so that he can trap Doom and himself in a pocket dimension so that he can make sure Doom never threatens anyone again. However, this plan backfires when the rest of the team attempt to rescue Reed, resulting in Doom transferring his spirit into Sue, Johnny and Ben respectively, forcing Reed to kill his best friend to stop his greatest enemy. Doom was returned to Hell, but Reed is later able to use the same machine Doom once tried to create to travel to Heaven and restore Ben to life. Doom remained in Hell until Mjolnir falls to Earth after the events of Ragnarok as it creates a dimensional tear during its fall that allows Doom to escape, although he decides to focus on rebuilding his power base when he proves unable to even lift the hammer. The events of this were deleted from Marvel Comics continuity in the 2015 series Secret Wars.|$|E
