5|$|As {{prosperity}} {{began to}} return in the 1980s, the city {{was stunned by the}} Wah Mee massacre in 1983, when 13 people were killed in an illegal gambling club in the Seattle Chinatown-International District. Beginning with Microsoft's 1979 move from Albuquerque, New Mexico, to nearby Bellevue, Washington, Seattle and its suburbs became home to a number of technology companies including Amazon.com, F5 Networks, RealNetworks, Nintendo of America, McCaw Cellular (now part of AT Mobility), VoiceStream (now T-Mobile), and biomedical corporations such as HeartStream (later purchased by Philips), Heart Technologies (later purchased by Boston Scientific), Physio-Control (later purchased by Medtronic), ZymoGenetics, ICOS (later purchased by Eli Lilly and Company) and Immunex (later purchased by Amgen). This success brought an influx of new residents with a population increase within city limits of almost 50,000 between 1990 and 2000, and saw Seattle's real estate become some of the most expensive in the country. In 1993, the movie Sleepless in Seattle brought the city further national attention. Many of the Seattle area's tech companies remained relatively strong, but <b>the</b> <b>frenzied</b> dot-com boom years ended in early 2001.|$|E

5|$|The {{next day}} at the tavern, Morrison meets Brown's wife (Agi Szirtes), and tells her that Brown is under {{suspicion}} for the theft and for the murder at the quayside. He asks for her help in finding him and repeats to her Mitchell's offer to Brown, but she remains silent. At home, Henriette tells Maloin she found a man in their hut at the seaside, and in fear locked the door and ran home. An agitated Maloin tells her not to tell anyone, and leaves for the hut. He unlocks the door, and receiving no response to his calling Brown's name, steps inside, closing the door behind. Minutes later he re-emerges, breathing heavily. After pausing to compose himself, he locks the door and leaves. In the next scene, Maloin presents the briefcase to Morrison in the tavern, and asks him to arrest him, confessing to having killed Brown an hour ago. Morrison leaves with Maloin for the hut, dismissing <b>the</b> <b>frenzied</b> inquiries of Brown's wife about her husband and handing the briefcase to the barkeep on the way out. Brown's wife follows the men to the hut, and emerges weeping with Morrison moments later. Back at the tavern, Morrison prepares two envelopes with {{a small portion of}} the recovered money in each. One he leaves with the grieving widow to whom he apologizes and wishes well, while the other he gives to Maloin, telling him that his case was one of self-defense. As he is preparing to leave, Morrison advises Maloin to go home and forget the whole affair. The camera focuses on the expressionless face of Brown's wife momentarily before fading to white.|$|E

50|$|The GameSpot {{review of}} the title praised its {{uniqueness}} and sense of humor, while noting that it rarely reaches <b>the</b> titular <b>frenzied</b> level of action, instead displaying a lack of sustained difficulty.

One of the two was shot, set on fire, and his head beaten to a pulp. Soon after, the crowd dragged the two mutilated bodies to Al-Manara Square in the city center and began an impromptu victory celebration.

25|$|Later, {{during the}} early stages of the Moro Rebellion in the Philippines, the 6mm round was criticized by some Marines for failing to stop <b>the</b> <b>frenzied</b> charges of bolo-wielding Moro juramentados at very close ranges. The {{possibility}} a 6mm bullet might lack shocking power (stopping power) had been raised as far back as 1895 when the cartridge was in the process of being developed for adoption. On the other hand, the Marine Legation Guard, which used the 6mm Lee in the defense of the foreign legations in Peking during the Boxer Rebellion of 1900, together with marines and navy bluejackets serving in the expedition relieving the besieged legations, apparently had no such criticisms.|$|E

The incident ended with the shooting of the elephant by Lansing police. Provoked by the growing crowd, Rajje's rampage took her through the men's wear, sporting goods and gift departments of a local Arlan's discount store before leading police on a two-mile chase in which she knocked down and injured a 67-year-old man, tried to move a car, and caused {{thousands of dollars in}} damage before being subdued.|$|E

25|$|Brodovitch {{released}} {{a book of}} these photographs in 1945, titled simply Ballet, through a small New York publisher. The book contains 104 photographs of several ballets and is divided into eleven segments, one for each ballet performance. On the contents page, Brodovitch introduces each chapter in a typographic style that emulates {{the feel of the}} dance it is describing. He photographed with a Contax 35mm camera, no flash, and with a slow film speed. The blurred figures of the dancers allow the viewer to not only feel the music, but also to follow the line of the dancer's limbs mid-step. The images beautifully capture the atmosphere on-stage, <b>the</b> <b>frenzied</b> behind-the-scenes action backstage, and the magical moments of the ballet. By bleeding the blurred, grainy pictures off the pages and into the gutters, he communicated the emotional impact of the dance without words.|$|E
25|$|Higher {{command and}} unit leadership. An inDuna guided each regiment, and he in turn {{answered}} to senior izinduna who controlled the corps grouping. Overall {{guidance of the}} host was furnished by elder izinduna usually with many years of experience. One {{or more of these}} elder chiefs might accompany a big force on an important mission. Coordination of tactical movements was supplied by the indunas who used hand signals and messengers. Generally before deploying for battle, the regiments were made to squat in a semicircle while these commanders made final assignments and adjustments. Lower level regimental izinduna, like the NCOs of today's armies, and yesterday's Roman centurions, were extremely important to morale and discipline. Prior to the clash at Isandhlwana for example, they imposed order on <b>the</b> <b>frenzied</b> rush of warriors eager to get at the British, and steadied those faltering under withering enemy fire during the battle.|$|E

500|$|<b>The</b> <b>frenzied</b> {{search for}} the flight {{recorders}} in early April 2014, due to the 30-day battery life of the underwater locator beacons (ULBs) attached to them, brought attention to {{the limitations of the}} ULBs.

Even if the flight recorders are located, the cockpit voice recorder memory has capacity to store only two hours of data, continuously recording over the oldest data. This length complies with regulations and it is usually only data from the last section of a flight that are needed to determine the cause of an accident. The events which caused Flight 370 to divert from its course and disappear happened more than two hours before the flight ended. Given these limitations and the importance of the data stored on flight recorders, Flight 370 has brought attention to new technologies that enable data streaming to the ground.|$|E

500|$|Various {{critics have}} written about the story's {{paradoxical}} themes of deformity and monstrosity. Not only does Henry Johnson suffer a literal and physical defacement that brands him a monster, but the Trescotts' suffer metaphorical loss of face when they are cast out by society. The trope of monstrosity takes on a second meaning when {{it becomes clear that}} the townspeople's actions make them more monstrous than the man they shun for his deformity; as professor and critic Lee Clark Mitchell asked in his essay, [...] "Face, Race, and Disfiguration in Stephen Crane's 'The Monster'", [...] "Is 'the monster' the disfigured black man or is it the town that comes to dis-figure him?" [...] Similarly, Harold Bloom called The Monster an example of the [...] "invasion myth", made worse {{by the fact that the}} [...] "monster" [...] is born from within the townspeople's collective mind. Henry-the-monster is therefore [...] "generated by its fears of social instability, its prejudices about appearance (including racism), and its all-consuming passion for gossip and drama." [...] Trescott, the only man in town not to see Henry as an invader, also becomes ostracized by <b>the</b> <b>frenzied</b> small-town mentality.|$|E

[...] While noting that [...] "Britney holds her own on the sexually charged 'Clumsy'," [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine suggested that Christina Aguilera would match better with the recording. Entertainment Weekly Nolan Feeney observed that [...] "the generic bass drop" [...] of the track is a [...] "missed opportunity." [...] Alex Macpherson of The Guardian was largely positive towards [...] "Clumsy", mentioning that it [...] "brings out grinding, Justice-style metallic synths, verses that jitter and hop uncontrollably, beery chants and an absurd moment when Spears' voice gets pitch-shifted thither and yon.
