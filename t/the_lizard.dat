5|$|Peter {{suspects}} Connors is <b>the</b> <b>Lizard</b> and unsuccessfully {{confronts the}} creature in the sewers. <b>The</b> <b>Lizard</b> learns Spider-Man's real identity via {{the name on}} an abandoned camera and follows Peter to school, where they fight. Police start a manhunt for both Spider-Man and <b>the</b> <b>Lizard.</b> The Police corner Spider-Man by taking off his mask and Captain Stacy discovers that Spider-Man is really Peter. <b>The</b> <b>Lizard</b> plans to make all humans lizard-like by releasing a chemical cloud from Oscorp's tower, to eliminate the weaknesses he believes plague humanity. Spider-Man eventually disperses an antidote cloud instead, restoring Connors and earlier victims to normal, but not before <b>the</b> <b>Lizard</b> mortally wounds Captain Stacy. Before his death, Captain Stacy requests Peter avoid Gwen, {{in order to keep}} her safe. Peter initially does so, but later at school, suggests to Gwen he may see her after all.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, the US Food and Drug Administration {{approved}} the drug exenatide (marketed as Byetta) {{for the management}} of type 2 diabetes. It is a synthetic version of a protein, exendin-4, derived from the Gila monster's saliva. In a three-year study with people with type 2 diabetes, exenatide led to healthy sustained glucose levels and progressive weight loss. The effectiveness is because <b>the</b> <b>lizard</b> protein is about 50% identical to glucagon-like peptide-1 analog (GLP-1), a hormone released from the human digestive tract that helps to regulate insulin and glucagon. <b>The</b> <b>lizard</b> protein remains effective much longer than the human hormone, helping diabetics keep their blood sugar levels under control. Exenatide slows the emptying of the stomach and causes a decrease in appetite, contributing to weight loss.|$|E
5|$|The babies {{discover}} a tiny lizard in Tommy Pickles' backyard {{that they are}} convinced is the offspring of Reptar, a fictitious green dinosaur and main character of many action movies of which the Rugrats are fond. After learning about the extinction of the dinosaurs, Tommy decides to return <b>the</b> <b>lizard</b> to Reptar just as his family has purchased tickets for a musical ice show based on the character. After Tommy's parents and grandfather have fallen asleep, the babies sneak into the ice rink and present <b>the</b> <b>lizard</b> to Leo, the actor portraying Reptar, who coincidentally happens to possess a phobia of lizards. Stu Pickles, Tommy's father, sees the rugrats and must retrieve them from the ice rink.|$|E
5000|$|A {{variation}} {{of this story}} is told in Douglas Adams' novel So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish, involving a democracy where people vote for lizards as their leaders. No one is happy with this situation, except for <b>the</b> <b>lizards,</b> but <b>the</b> people continue voting for <b>the</b> <b>lizards</b> [...] "because if they didn't vote for a <b>lizard</b> ... <b>the</b> wrong <b>lizard</b> might get in".|$|R

5|$|Twenty {{minutes after}} {{sighting}} the lighthouse, the ship ran aground violently {{at full speed}} amongst the rocks of Maenheere Reef, {{a quarter of a}} mile off <b>The</b> <b>Lizard.</b> Suevic was about 16 miles closer to the shore than her command crew believed.|$|E
5|$|After passing <b>The</b> <b>Lizard</b> {{the path}} turns northwards, {{continuing}} past Housel Bay and a building used by Guglielmo Marconi for radio experiments, then Bass Point with its Coastguard Station. <b>The</b> <b>Lizard</b> lifeboat station is a sheltered position in Kilcobben Cove. Passing through Cadgwith and across Kennack Sands, the path heads towards Black Head then into Coverack. Once around Lowland Point, The Manacles lie a mile offshore, a reef that has wrecked many ships. The path passes through Porthoustock and Porthallow, then around Nare Point lies Gillan Creek. This can be crossed {{at very low}} tide, but most walkers follow the lanes round {{the head of the}} creek to reach Dennis Head {{at the mouth of the}} Helford River. To cross this wider river means following it inland to Helford where there is a ferry across to Helford Passage on the north bank. Some people take a short cut from Gillan Creek to Helford by a path through Manaccan.|$|E
5|$|On October 11, 2010, Rhys Ifans was {{confirmed}} {{to be the}} unnamed villain, and two days later his character was revealed to be Dr. Curt Connors / <b>The</b> <b>Lizard.</b> Arad said that Lizard is his favorite Spider-Man villain, and he had long wanted to use him in a film. Well before the choice of villain, Arad had had conceptual drawings prepared for the character.|$|E
5|$|Bart and Marge take <b>the</b> <b>lizards</b> to <b>the</b> Springfield Birdwatching Society. Principal Skinner, {{a member}} of the society, {{explains}} that they are Bolivian tree lizards, a type of lizard that steals a bird’s eggs and leaves their own eggs to be watched after by the mother bird, which is then eaten by the offspring once they hatch. Skinner says <b>the</b> <b>lizards</b> must be killed by law, because they have killed many bird species. Bart escapes and runs away with <b>the</b> <b>lizards,</b> but before he can get away, Skinner catches up to him and they both struggle on top of the building. Suddenly, <b>the</b> <b>lizards</b> glide to <b>the</b> ground, where they start to eradicate pigeons in Springfield.|$|R

50|$|The insect's {{coloration}} {{was shown}} to be aposematic in an experiment of predation by little striped whiptail lizards. These brightly-colored grasshoppers were less attractive to <b>the</b> <b>lizards</b> as food than cryptically-colored Trimerotropis sp of similar size, even though <b>the</b> <b>lizards</b> were unfamiliar with the rainbow grasshopper, which was not present in their natural habitat. <b>The</b> <b>lizards</b> may previously have encountered other prey with warning colors such as stink bugs, seed bugs, or velvet ants. The rainbow grasshopper is also distasteful to birds.|$|R

Royal Edward was reported off <b>the</b> <b>Lizard</b> on the evening of the 28th, and had arrived at Alexandria on 10 August, a day after sister ship Royal George had sailed from Devonport. Royal Edward sailed for Moudros on the island of Lemnos, a staging point for the Dardanelles.|$|E
50|$|Its {{common name}} comes from the large frill around its neck, which usually stays folded against <b>the</b> <b>lizard's</b> body.

5|$|Some {{animals are}} capable of {{autotomy}} (self-amputation), shedding {{one of their own}} appendages in a last-ditch attempt to elude a predator's grasp or to distract the predator and thereby allow escape. The lost body part may be regenerated later. Certain sea slugs discard stinging papillae; arthropods such as crabs can sacrifice a claw, which can be regrown over several successive moults; among vertebrates, many geckos and other lizards shed their tails when attacked: the tail goes on writhing for a while, distracting the predator, and giving <b>the</b> <b>lizard</b> time to escape; a smaller tail slowly regrows.|$|E
5|$|Spider-Man enters <b>the</b> <b>lizard</b> {{room where}} Connors has taken refuge. Connors knocks {{him out and}} Eddie arrives to help him out. When he regains consciousness, Spider-Man {{comes up with a}} plan to trick him into the polar bear pond. They almost succeed when Connors is alerted by Spider-Man's {{cellphone}} ringing. Billy then arrives and tries to talk some sense into his father, but it is useless and Spider-Man leaps in to get Connors into the pond. Spider-Man pours the cleanser into the mouth of Connors who, as a result, returns to normal, his arm lost once more.|$|E
5|$|Texas {{honored the}} Texas horned lizard in 1993, but private Texas Christian University {{has had the}} {{associated}} mascot the Horned Frog since 1896. According to legend, the football team identified with the lizards found on the practice field as the athletes and reptiles were similarly scrappy. The college founder's son, Addison Clark Jr., a faculty member and the initiator of the football team, had been fascinated by the creatures. By 1897, <b>the</b> <b>lizard</b> appeared as a logo {{on the front of}} the school yearbook, which Clark had also started and was managing.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> horned <b>lizard</b> is popularly {{called a}} [...] "horned toad", [...] "horny toad", or [...] "horned frog", {{but it is}} neither a toad nor a frog. The popular names come from <b>the</b> <b>lizard's</b> rounded body and blunt snout, which give it a decidedly batrachian appearance. Phrynosoma {{literally}} means [...] "toad-bodied" [...] and cornutum means [...] "horned". <b>The</b> <b>lizard's</b> horns are extensions of its cranium and contain true bone.|$|R

5|$|The next day, Peter gets <b>the</b> <b>Lizard</b> photos {{published}} in the Bugle and gets the money he needs. However, when Gwen, Eddie, and the Connors find out, they are outraged that he ran off simply to take pictures and say he has lost their trust. Although Martha understands the difficult choices that Peter had, she fires him. He secretly grabs another vial of gene cleanser and returns home, frustrated about his reputation. Blaming the events that gave him his powers, {{he is about to}} take the vial when he sees a photo of himself with Ben. Realizing that he had saved Curt either way, he decides that Spider-Man is needed and hides the vial under his desk.|$|E
5|$|The rescue {{was led by}} the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI), and {{it became}} the largest rescue in that institution's 190-year history.

The operation took 16 hours to complete. As a result of the successful efforts of the rescuers, four silver RNLI medals were awarded to various volunteers and two were awarded to Suevic crew members for their actions. In March 2007 a ceremony was held to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the rescue.|$|E

5|$|In 2007, Raimi {{expressed}} interest in portraying the transformation of Dr. Curt Connors into his villainous alter-ego, <b>the</b> <b>Lizard,</b> a villain which had been teased since Spider-Man 2; the character's actor Dylan Baker and producer Grant Curtis were also enthusiastic about the idea. By December 2009, John Malkovich was in negotiations to play Vulture and Anne Hathaway would play Felicia Hardy, though {{she would not have}} transformed into the Black Cat as in the comics but a new superpowered figure, the Vulturess. According to sources online, an early draft of the film would have had the Vulture buying out the Daily Bugle, forcing Spider-Man to kill him. Felicia Hardy, Vulture's daughter in this version of the script, would have had an affair with Peter Parker in order to shatter his engagement with Mary Jane. These rumors were never confirmed. Raimi stated years later during an interview in 2013, however, that Hathaway was going to be Black Cat if Spider-Man 4 had been made.|$|E
5|$|Sony Pictures Entertainment built {{a promotional}} website, {{releasing}} many previews {{and launched a}} viral marketing campaign, among other moves. Tie-ins included a video game by Beenox. The film premiered on June 30 in Tokyo, and was released in the United States on July 3, ten years after release of Spider-Man (2002), in 2D, 3D and IMAX 3D and released in home media in November 2012. The reboot received generally favorable reviews, with critics praising mostly Andrew Garfield's performance, the visual style, James Horner's musical score, and the realistic portrayal of the title character, but {{the introduction of the}} character, <b>the</b> <b>Lizard,</b> was criticized for being too surreal for the film. The film was a box office success, grossing over $757 million worldwide, becoming the seventh-highest-grossing film of 2012. The film's sequel, The Amazing Spider-Man 2, was released on May 2, 2014.|$|E
5|$|The proto-Scotland landmass moved northwards, {{and from}} 460–430 Ma, sandstone, {{mudstone}} and limestone were {{deposited in the}} area that is now the Midland Valley.

The Ballantrae Complex near Girvan was formed from this ocean floor and is similar in composition to rocks found at <b>The</b> <b>Lizard</b> in Cornwall. Nonetheless, northern and southern Britain were far apart {{at the beginning of this}} period, although the gap began to close as the continent of Avalonia broke away from Gondwana, collided with Baltica and drifted towards Laurentia.
