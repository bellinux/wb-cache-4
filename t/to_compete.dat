5|$|Athletes will {{sometimes}} become citizens {{of a different}} nation so they are able <b>to</b> <b>compete</b> in the Olympics. This is often because they are drawn to sponsorships or training facilities in such places as the United States. It could also be because an athlete is unable to qualify from within their original country. The athlete may not qualify because there are already qualified athletes in the athlete's home country. Between 1992 and 2008, about fifty athletes emigrated to the United States <b>to</b> <b>compete</b> on the US Olympic team after having previously competed for another nation.|$|E

5|$|In 1986, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) {{voted to}} allow {{professional}} athletes <b>to</b> <b>compete</b> in Olympic Games starting in 1988. The National Hockey League (NHL) was initially reluctant to allow its players <b>to</b> <b>compete</b> because the Olympics {{are held in}} the middle of the NHL season, and the league would have to halt play if many of its players participated. However, NHL players were allowed <b>to</b> <b>compete</b> starting in 1998. The format of the tournament was adjusted to accommodate the NHL schedule; a preliminary round was played without NHL players or the top six teams—Canada, the Czech Republic, Finland, Russia, Sweden and the United States—followed by a final round which included them. The tournament format was changed again in 2006; every team played five preliminary games with the full use of NHL players.|$|E
