While there is still discussion as to the method of evolution, none the less, as a process sufficient to explain all biological phenomena, all differentiations of life into widely diverse species, families, and even kingdoms, evolution is flatly accepted. Likewise has been accepted its law of development: That, in the struggle for existence, the strong and fit and the progeny of the strong and fit have a better opportunity for survival than the weak and less fit and the progeny of the weak and less fit.|$|E

50|$|A few {{linguists}} {{have proposed}} even broader relationships, {{of which the}} Dene-Caucasian hypothesis {{is perhaps the most}} popular. Dene-Caucasian links the North Caucasian (including Northwest Caucasian), Basque, Burushaski, Yeniseian, Sino-Tibetan, and Na-Dene families. However, this is an even more <b>tentative</b> <b>hypothesis</b> than Nostratic, which attempts to relate Indo-European, Uralic, Kartvelian, Altaic, etc., and which is widely considered to be undemonstrated.|$|E
50|$|A {{striking}} {{feature of}} the disease is its very localized occurrence. There are approximately ten small areas where it occurs, all of them more or less rural, but nothing seems to connect those areas other than the occurrence of this illness. Tanchev and colleagues suggested that the condition was sui generis. Their initial <b>tentative</b> <b>hypothesis</b> for its cause was intoxication with heavy metals, because the affected villages were supplied with water coming from nearby Vratsa Mountain, a karst-type mountain.|$|E
50|$|According to a <b>tentative</b> <b>hypothesis</b> by Kamil Zvelebil, a pre-Dravidian Melanid {{population}} {{that forms the}} bulk of the Irulas anthropologically began to speak an ancient pre- or proto-Tamil dialect, which was superimposed almost totally on their native (pre-Dravidian) speech. That then became the basis of the language, which must have subsequently been in close contact with the other tribal languages of the Nilgiri area {{as well as with the}} large surrounding languages such as Kannada, Tamil and Malayalam.|$|E

Using ten classroom-specific scenarios as elements, we elicited approximately 800 constructs from a cohort of prospective teachers {{in the first stage}} of this awareness-raising project. From these, 12 constructs were selected to include in a repertory ratings grid. <b>Tentative</b> <b>hypotheses</b> about the meaning making within the group and for each indivudal were formulated.

50|$|The term Salt Line {{was created}} by Xavier Guichard, {{who was the first}} person to posit the {{existence}} of such lines in the 1920s and 1930s. After having looked at a map of France, Guichard had noticed a recurrent name which he linked to Alesia, the place where Julius Caesar defeated Gaulish leader Vercingetorix in 52 BC. At the time, Guichard thought the Bronze Age people had invented the 360-degree circle. But because the intervals between the lines were seemingly too small, nobody took him seriously at the time. It was only in the late 1990s that someone (namely Alan Butler) had a second look on Guichard's <b>tentative</b> <b>hypothesis.</b>|$|E

40|$|The damping {{capacity}} of several aluminum-copper alloys {{has been investigated}} during tensile elongation. This damping is shown to depend on strain rate, strain, temperature, alloy content, and heat treatment. A <b>tentative</b> <b>hypothesis,</b> based on the acceleration of solute atom diffusion by deformation-produced vacancies, is proposed {{to account for the}} observed behavior. Internal-friction maxima are observed in deformed aluminum and aluminum-copper alloys at - 70 deg and - 50 deg C. The peaks appear to be relatively insensitive to frequency and alloy content, but they disappear after annealing at temperatures nearing the recrystallization temperature...|$|E
50|$|The {{overwhelming}} scientific {{consensus is}} that creation science is a religious, not a scientific view. It fails to qualify as a science because it lacks empirical support, supplies no <b>tentative</b> <b>hypotheses,</b> and resolves to describe natural history in terms of scientifically untestable supernatural causes. Creation science is a pseudoscientific attempt to map the Bible into scientific facts, and is viewed by professional biologists as unscholarly and, even, as a dishonest and misguided sham, with harmful educational consequences.|$|R

A robust image-based similarity measure is used to verify the 3 D hypotheses and identify false positives. We performed experiments on a synthetic data set and on several real datasets. 1...|$|R
40|$|Notwithstanding the {{large-scale}} deinstitutionalization of the elderly, psychogeriatric patients {{continue to make}} up a significant portion of patients in U. S. state hospitals. This paper reports pilot data from a national survey assessing the current status of geriatric populations in state hospitals. Elderly patients still account for one-fifth of state hospital patients, and two-thirds of state hospitals still have separate geriatric units. The data suggest that, while deinstitutionalization of the elderly may be continuing in many state hospitals, in more than one-third of state hospitals the geriatric census is on the rise. <b>Tentative</b> <b>hypotheses</b> suggesting further research are discussed...|$|R

Results indicate that 75 % of the participating boys and 10 % of participating girls had witnessed the shooting, stabbing, robbing, or killing of another person in their own lives.

40|$|The author pleads for a {{modification}} of ethological science that allows for the presentation of even <b>tentative</b> <b>hypotheses,</b> based on what is at present disparagingly referred to as "anecdotal data". It is argued that such data are crucial for the neglected study of the habituation of free-ranging large mammals. In such studies of learning, relevant behavioural observations lie outside the ethologist's control, and can only be replicated by further chance encounters. Observations in their anecdotal form should therefore {{be made available to}} other ethologists despite their lack of quantifiable data. This would allow {{for the creation of a}} pool of more or less unique observations helping to better understand behaviour...|$|R
40|$|What Constitutes a Scientific Database? We {{propose that}} a {{scientific}} database should be inherently different from, say a business database. The difference {{is based on}} the nature of science itself, in which hypotheses, or logical implications, form {{an essential part of the}} discipline. Empirical observations give rise to <b>tentative</b> <b>hypotheses.</b> Individual hypotheses are then tested, refuted or refined, by further empirical observation. In the paper, we propose representing the observational data of science in a lattice format that also conveys all the logical implications that can be supported by those observations. We claim that such a structure can be incrementally created and that the hypotheses formed will adapt to new data. We demonstrate its practicality by presenting two real situations in which it has been used. Finally, we look at the rather considerable storage costs associated with this approach and discuss other limitations that are still unresolved in this new approach to the representation of scientific data. ...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades or so, it has become {{increasingly}} appparent that, out to quite large distances, galaxies are distributed in a quasi-fractal fashion with fractal dimension D ≈ 2. Whether or not this behaviour continues onto indefinitely large scales is a matter of live debate and is a question that can only be settled if, at some scale, there is an unambiguous transition to homogeneity. This point has not yet been reached and may never be. This paper has been written {{on the basis of the}} <b>tentative</b> <b>hypothesis</b> that quasi-fractal D≈ 2 behaviour is a persistent and fundamental feature of galaxy distribution on all scales and addresses the question of the origins of this putative fractality. Given this <b>tentative</b> <b>hypothesis</b> then, except for the device of putting the fractal behaviour into the initial conditions - which is to by-pass the question, there is no obvious explanation within the framework of conventional cosmology. So we adopt the position that fractality is per-se a signature that different thinking is required. We find that a beautiful solution flows deductively from elementary observations about the world in which we live when we take seriously a view of space and time that can be traced, via Mach, Berkeley and Leibnitz to Aristotle. In summary, we find that a globally inertial space and time can be irreducibly associated with a fractal, D= 2, distribution of material if we are prepared to review our understanding of what is meant by the notion of metric on astrophysical scales.

40|$|We {{test the}} <b>tentative</b> <b>hypothesis</b> that {{increasing}} quality {{of public service}} delivery leads to increasing trust in government and governmental institutions {{in a sample of}} 1, 000 Flemish respondents. The public service under study is the Department of Education, and more specifically the administration dealing with the distribution of scholarships (Dienst Studietoelagen). The clients in this case were mainly parents applying for their child(ren). We found no evidence of a positive association between satisfaction with this particular service delivery and trust in government. Trust in micro administrations and trust in macro government, on the other hand, are associated but dissimilar concepts.

40|$|Theory and {{practice}} of technology transfer and entrepreneurial behaviour of academics are novel. We draw upon the literature of business models, transaction costs, professional and organisational culture and of agency theory to formulate a framework for a technology transfer business model.

It illustrates the conceptual framework developed and has thus far been successful in its specific environment.

Shatter cones, {{a form of}} rock fracture in impact structures, apparently form as a shock front interacts with inhomogeneities or discontinuities in the rock. Topics discussed include morphology, conditions of formation, shock pressure of formation, and theories of formation. It is thought that shatter cones are produced within a limited range of shock pressures extending from about 20 to perhaps 250 kbar. Apical angles range from less than 70 deg to over 120 deg. <b>Tentative</b> <b>hypotheses</b> concerning the physical process of shock coning are considered.
