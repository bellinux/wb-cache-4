It was first broadcast on 2 October 1993 at 9am on BBC1. The original hosts were Andi Peters, Emma Forbes who had presented a cookery segment in Going Live!, and John Barrowman. For the second series, John was relegated to host <b>the</b> <b>showbiz</b> Electric Circus segment, leaving Andi and Emma to become the main hosts. He left after one series of Electric Circus to concentrate on acting. Comedy duo Trevor and Simon and Peter Simon, in the Run the Risk segment, were also regulars who had featured on Going Live!.|$|E

500|$|... "Hollywood", {{featuring}} guest vocals from Knowles, {{was included}} as the tenth track on Jay Z's ninth studio album, Kingdom Come (2006). It sees songwriting duties by Jay Z {{as well as}} R singer Ne-Yo, and utilizes production from Reggie [...] "Syience" [...] Perry. The song is an R intoned simple one, also containing elements of disco, which is a genre of dance music. According to Louis Pattison of New Musical Express, [...] "Hollywood" [...] expresses [...] "a weariness with <b>the</b> <b>showbiz</b> merry-go-round." [...] It was sent by Def Jam and Roc-A-Fella Records to US rhythmic radio for airplay on January 23, 2007, and to contemporary hit radio on February 6, 2007.|$|E
500|$|The A.V. Club cited several {{actions by}} the Fox network {{that contributed to the}} show's failure, most notably airing the episodes out of sequence, making the plot more {{difficult}} to follow. For instance, the double episode [...] "Serenity" [...] was intended as the premiere, and therefore contained most of the character introductions and back-story. However, Fox decided that [...] "Serenity" [...] was unsuitable to open the series, and [...] "The Train Job" [...] was specifically created to act as a new pilot. In addition, Firefly was promoted as an action-comedy rather than the more serious character study it was intended to be, and <b>the</b> <b>showbiz</b> trade paper Variety noted Fox's decision to occasionally preempt the show for sporting events.|$|E
500|$|Fark tweaked {{its site}} design {{a little more}} on June 1, 2011, with the comment, [...] "Fark's {{redesign}} will go live at 5PM EST. Heads-up {{for those of you}} who missed the other warning threads and need a place to completely lose your mind." [...] Having learned from the controversy caused by the 2007 redesign, Curtis introduced the new site as a preview one week (two weeks for TotalFark users) prior to June 1, to allow users to comment on the changes and provide feedback on where things were broken. The primary reason for the redesigned site is to make it easier to use and more intuitive. The site's tagline was changed from [...] "It's not news, it's FARK" [...] to [...] "We don't make news. We mock it." [...] The music tab was also dropped, due to low usage – content was rolled into <b>the</b> <b>Showbiz</b> or Video tab, where most of the content was already cross-posted anyway. An overhaul to the Fark Mobile Web site was not done at this time, but Curtis did say that small changes would be implemented over time to make the mobile site more consistent with the overall design of the new site.|$|E

2500|$|Collins {{adapted the}} novel for film herself, in {{collaboration}} with screenwriter Billy Ray and director Gary Ross. The screenplay remains extremely faithful to the original novel, with Ross saying he [...] "felt {{the only way to}} make the film really successful was to be totally subjective", echoing Collins' presentation of the novel in the first person present. Instead of Katniss' internal monologue about the Capitol's machinations, the screenplay expanded the character of Seneca Crane, the Head Gamemaker, to allow several developments to be shown directly to the audience. Ross explained, [...] "In the book, Katniss speculates about the game-makers' manipulations... in the film, we can't get inside Katniss's head, but we do have the ability to cut away and actually show the machinations of the Capitol behind the scenes. I created the game center and also expanded the role of Seneca Crane for those reasons. I thought it was tonally important." [...] Ross also added several scenes between Crane and Coriolanus Snow, the elderly President of Panem, noting that [...] "I thought that it was very interesting that there would be one generation [...] who knew that [...] were actually an instrument of political control, and there would be a successive generation who was so enamoured with the ratings and <b>the</b> <b>showbiz</b> and the sensations and the spectacle that was subsuming the actual political intention, and that's really where the tension is".|$|E
