40|$|A {{castellated}} magnetoresistive {{structure has}} been fabricated and evaluated for its application as a multi-track tape replay head. It {{has a higher}} field sensitivity and is less susceptible {{to the effect of}} demagnetizing fields at its edges than a conventional 'straight' element magnetoresistor. The inherently noisy magnetoresitive response attributed to its multi-domain structure has been found to reduce substantially as its film thickness is decreased below 250 Å. The unshielded castellated structure is simple to fabricate and offers an integral <b>tape</b> <b>flux</b> guiding system. Initial simple tape tests show that its replay performance compares favourably with the Philips DCC yoke-type MR replay head. A multi-track single turn thin-film inductive write head has been fabricated and tested. The head is built from a sandwich of two substrates each having an array of thin-film permalloy poles. The lower pole array is constructed with the patterned winding and gap layers, and the upper pole array with the front and rear permalloy yoke layers. The poles are optically aligned and the substrates glued together to complete the write structure...|$|E

The calibration {{of the expansion}} (decoding) unit for magnetic <b>tape</b> uses a <b>flux</b> level of 185 nWb/m, which is the level used on industry calibration tapes such as those from Ampex; this is set to 0 VU on the tape recorder playback and to Dolby Level on the noise reduction unit. In the record (compression or encoding) mode a characteristic tone (Dolby Tone) generated inside the noise reduction unit is set to 0 VU on the tape recorder and to 185 nWb/m on the tape.|$|R
40|$|Current-voltage {{characteristics}} {{in the range}} of very low electric field were analyzed from a relaxation of the magnetization using a SQUID magnetometer in a superconducting Bi- 2223 tape. It was found that the observed current-voltage {{characteristics in}} this range were scaled well as predicted by the vortex glass-liquid transition theory. However, the obtained transition field was much lower than that obtained from a scaling in the higher electric field range. At the same time, the dynamic critical index, z, was much larger than usual values. Hence, it is concluded that these parameters are not uniquely determined independently of the level of electric field. The experimental result was compared with the theoretical analysis using the flux creep-flow theory in which the distribution of the effective flux pinning strength was taken into account. It was found that the theoretical result explains approximately the observed result. This shows that the essential mechanism which governs the transport property in the superconducting <b>tape</b> is the <b>flux</b> pinnin...|$|R
40|$|Acknowledgements: We wish {{to thank}} F. Grilli from KIT for the {{courtesy}} of having provided the YBCO tape used in our experimentations. International audienceWe propose a useful contactless method for the characterization of superconducting tapes. It consists in imposing a constant flux density to the tape, thanks to permanent magnets. The superconductor being cooled at zero field, currents are induced in the conductor. A map of the flux density is then measured over the tape, using a Hall effect probe mounted on an x-y-z table. From these measurements and thanks to an inverse problem calculation, {{the distribution of the}} current flowing through the tape is computed. This operation is repeated for different applied flux densities, by varying the distance between the tape and the magnets, to obtain the field dependence of the current distribution. This result allows visualizing defects in the superconductor and their field dependence. Moreover, by fitting measurements by a current distribution model, we can obtain the critical current density {{as a function of the}} flux density and of the position on the tape. This method has been tested experimentally on an YBCO tape of 30 cm length. We therefore used a magnet assembly measuring 50 x 5 x 1 cm. It can impose to the <b>tape</b> a <b>flux</b> density varying from 7 to 180 mT with an inhomogeneity smaller than 3. 5 %. This method has the advantage of not only detect defects in superconducting tapes, but also to quantify them and to obtain a real measure of the critical current density. Moreover, its field dependence is also obtained...|$|R
40|$|The {{transport}} AC losses (Q tr) of YBCO pancake coils wound from n = 1, 2, 4 non-transposed parallel connected (n-tpc) tapes {{have been}} investigated experimentally and theoretically. It {{was found that the}} Q tr AC losses of the coils with several n-tpc tapes consist of hysteresis AC losses (Q h) and coupling AC losses (Q cc). AC losses Q h of these coils are nearly the same as the AC losses of single-tape coils (n = 1). In contrast, Q cc are unique for coils with n > 1 n-tpc tapes. We found that the distribution of the coupling currents in the coil turns is defined by the magnetic flux penetrating between n-tpc <b>tapes.</b> This <b>flux</b> is related to the self-field component of the coil parallel to the tape surface, which is antisymmetrically distributed (an odd function) with respect to the winding center. This antisymmetrical distribution leads to a compensation effect of the coupling currents if n-tpc tapes are insulated along the turn length, in spite of low resistance between n-tpc tapes in the soldered coil ends. Therefore, AC losses Q cc of such coils are negligibly small compared to AC losses Q h. On the other hand, AC losses Q cc per current cycle are frequency dependent and have a maximum defined by the time constant τ eff if tapes are non-insulated along the turn length. In this paper we estimated τ eff for several special cases. In particular, we found that Q tr of YBCO pancake coils wound from several n-tpc tapes are comparable to Q tr of single-tape coils if the operating frequency f is far from the characteristic frequency 1 /τ eff...|$|R
40|$|A {{magneto-optical}} apparatus {{has been}} designed to investigate flux and current distributions in various forms of high-temperature superconductor after the application of external magnetic fields, transport currents, and both in sequence. It is concluded that flux motion depends significantly on the superconductor characteristic flux pinning strength and geometry. The flux profiles at the surface of an isolated thin film strip, and thin films in x-array and shunted-x-array arrangements have been studied in detail. It has been found that the theoretical flux profile, characterised by a logarithmic singularity at its edges and a vertical slope at the flux front, become rounded when the sample thickness is taken into account. Experiment has confirmed that the current density reaches its critical value in the flux-penetrated region while there is a continuous non-zero current density in the central flux-free region. Also magnetic interactions exist between the strips. Band-shaped and dome-shaped flux distributions caused by geometrical barrier at different weak pinning strengths were observed in Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8 +x single crystals between 20 K and 70 K. The geometrical barrier also governs the transport current leading to a square-shaped distribution near the crystal edges at 20 K. Cracks and defects in Bi- 2223 /Ag tapes were visualised without destruction of the <b>tape.</b> The inhomogeneous <b>flux</b> distribution indicated that defects, including cracks, in superconducting filaments limit the current-carrying capacity of the tape. In addition, at 70 K a fraction of the transport current has been found to flow in the silver sheath. An investigation of the influence of the twin planes on vortex motion in a YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 -d single crystal has shown that after a twin barrier is initially overcome, the twin planes, regardless of their directions, act as an easy-flow channel for vortex penetration at low temperatures as the pinning strength in the twin planes is weaker than that in the untwinned region, whereas, they act as a barrier at high temperatures where the pinning strength in the twin planes is stronger. Furthermore, vortex penetration along the twin planes is a factor of four greater than that for the untwinned region at 25 K...|$|R
