5|$|Kierkegaard {{argues that}} Hegel's {{philosophy}} dehumanized life by denying personal freedom and choice through the neutralization of the 'either/or'. The dialectic structure of becoming renders existence far too easy, in Hegel's theory, because conflicts are eventually mediated and disappear automatically through a natural process that requires no individual choice {{other than a}} submission <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>will</b> <b>of</b> the Idea or Geist. Kierkegaard saw this as a denial of true selfhood and instead advocated the importance of personal responsibility and choice-making.|$|E
5|$|By gaining {{power through}} {{a vote of}} {{confidence}} from the people and then willingly surrendering power, Selvo, like many other Doges who underwent similar transitions, left a long-term impact on the succession process that would eventually become a model for peaceful, anti-nepotistic transitions of power in a classical republic. Although his deposition did not immediately change the system, it was one of many important changes of power in a society that {{was in the process of}} moving away from a monarchy and toward a government led by an elected official. Following the battles at Corfu, Selvo was seen by many as inept and incapable of handling the duties that a Doge must perform. His apparent squandering of nearly the entire fleet coupled with a decade-long distrust for his royal wife caused Selvo to become unpopular in Venice. By responding <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>will</b> <b>of</b> the people, Selvo helped shape a society that would eventually create a complicated system to check the power of its most influential members, create cooperative governmental branches that checked each other's power, and fuse the nation into a classical republic.|$|E
5|$|Historian Ban Zhao (45116 CE) {{wrote in}} her Lessons for Women that, like the {{opposite}} and complementary forces of yin and yang, men's great virtues were strength and rigidity, while a woman's great virtues were respect and compliance. Throughout her life, a Han woman was to bend <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>will</b> <b>of</b> first her father, then her husband, and then her adult son (三從四德). However, there are many recorded deviations from this rule, as some Han women are written to have engaged in heated arguments with their husbands over concubines (sometimes beating concubines out of jealousy and to punish the husband), wrote essays and letters for husbands serving as government officials, and sometimes husbands turned to their wives for advice on political affairs of the court. When a father died, the eldest son was theoretically the {{senior member of the}} family, yet as hinted in various works of Han literature, they still had to obey the will of their mother and she could even force them to kowtow to her when apologizing for an offense. Deviations from common customs regarding gender were especially pronounced in the imperial family. The empress was able to give orders to her male relatives (even her father) and if they disobeyed her, she could publicly reprimand and humiliate them.|$|E

50|$|According to Rousseau, {{by joining}} {{together}} into civil society through {{the social contract}} and abandoning their claims of natural right, individuals can both preserve themselves and remain free. This is because submission <b>to</b> <b>the</b> authority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> general <b>will</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people as a whole guarantees individuals against being subordinated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wills</b> <b>of</b> others and also ensures that they obey themselves because they are, collectively, {{the authors of the}} law.|$|R

5|$|Some historians {{allege that}} Jinnah's courting {{the rulers of}} Hindu-majority states and his gambit with Junagadh are {{evidence}} of ill-intent towards India, as Jinnah had promoted separation by religion, yet tried to gain the accession of Hindu-majority states. In his book Patel: A Life, Rajmohan Gandhi asserts that Jinnah hoped for a plebiscite in Junagadh, knowing Pakistan would lose, in the hope the principle would be established for Kashmir. However, when Mountbatten proposed to Jinnah that, in all the princely States where the ruler did not accede to a Dominion corresponding to the majority population (which would have included Junagadh, Hyderabad and Kashmir), the accession should be decided by an 'impartial reference <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>will</b> <b>of</b> the people', Jinnah rejected the offer.|$|E

The goal of the church's ministry is not <b>to</b> explain <b>the</b> <b>will</b> <b>of</b> god rationally: <b>the</b> church should assist the believer in distress {{to enter into a}} personal relationship with God. The pastor should have a true relationship with God and a sincere relationship should exist between pastor and church member. With these relationships as a basis, the believer can be led <b>to</b> accept <b>the</b> <b>will</b> <b>of</b> God in his her life as a loving, caring <b>will.</b> In practice, <b>the</b> ministry of the church should comprise five aspects: christological communication, father-centred integration, pneumatological assistance, eschatological vision and personal growth...|$|R

25|$|A theist is {{a person}} who {{believes}} that gods exist (monotheism or polytheism).

25|$|The Hadith are {{reported}} sayings of Muhammad and people around him. The Hadith containing Jesus legend {{have been influenced}} by the non-canonical ('heretical') Christianity that prevailed in the Arab peninsula and further in Abyssinia. The Hadith developed a canonical status in the third Muslim century as a source of authority for the Muslim community. The Muslim perception of Jesus emerging from the Hadith is of a miraculous, sinless, and eschatological figure, pointing people, again according to the Muslim's perspective of prophethood, to the Muslim faith (Muslim; one who submits <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>will</b> <b>of</b> God).|$|E
