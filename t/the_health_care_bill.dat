5|$|Both {{chambers}} {{worked to}} reconcile differences between their respective {{versions of the}} bill, and on April 1, 1994, the last regular day of the legislative session, the Senate passed a compromise bill, but the House killed it on a procedural motion. On April 15, {{the last day of}} the session, which legislators had set aside to override any gubernatorial vetos, <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>bill</b> was reintroduced and passed both houses of the General Assembly. Jones then reversed course and signed it. Among the reforms included in the bill were a mechanism making the policies of all companies uniform and the creation of a Health Policy Board to regulate rate increases. It ensured that insurance companies could not deny coverage because of a pre-existing condition and allowed workers to retain their insurance after changing jobs.|$|E

2500|$|Bob Turner {{recalled}} {{that he was}} motivated to join politics because of his opposition to <b>the</b> <b>Health</b> <b>care</b> <b>bill</b> and a perceived [...] "radical left turn" [...] that he felt the Obama administration was taking. He first ran for Congress in November 2010 against Anthony Weiner in New York's ninth congressional district, losing in a 60–40 split. During the 2010 campaign, he ran on a platform favoring minimal regulation of business and signed the Grover Norquist / Americans for Tax Reform pledge of [...] "no new taxes under any circumstances".|$|E
2500|$|Cravaack {{campaigned on}} a {{platform}} of free-market principles and government spending cuts. He attacked Oberstar's vote on <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>bill,</b> saying he would vote to repeal and replace it, and called an Oberstar-approved extension of the Clean Water Act to include wet meadows, a [...] "land grab" [...] by the federal government. He criticized the earmark process that Oberstar had used to fund infrastructure projects in the district, saying {{it was time for the}} spending to stop. Cravaack also attacked Oberstar's vote on [...] "cap and trade" [...] legislation to limit carbon emissions, saying it would result in higher energy prices. [...] In his first ad, Cravaack paid homage to Oberstar's service, saying that he ran against Oberstar [...] "with all due respect," [...] but accused him of having lost touch with the district.|$|E
2500|$|Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Police Commissioner Kelly were in Washington, D.C., {{to attend}} the 2010 White House Correspondents' Dinner, but {{returned}} immediately to New York after they were informed of the incident.

2500|$|Pelosi {{has been}} {{credited}} for spearheading President Obama's health care law {{when it seemed}} that it would go down in defeat. After Republican Scott Brown won Democratic Ted Kennedy's former senate seat in the January 2010 Massachusetts special election and thereby causing the Senate Democrats to lose their filibuster proof majority, Obama agreed with then chief of staff Rahm Emanuel's idea that he should do smaller initiatives that could pass easily. Pelosi, however, dismissed the president's fear and instead mocked his scaled-back ideas as [...] "kiddie care." [...] After convincing the president {{that this would be}} their only shot at health care because of the large Democratic majorities they currently had, she rallied her Democratic caucus as she began an [...] "unbelievable marathon" [...] of a two-month session to craft <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>bill,</b> which successfully passed the House with a 219-212 vote.

2500|$|On August 7, 2009 Palin {{released}} a statement on her Facebook page in which she said, [...] "The America I know and love is not one in which my parents or my baby with Down Syndrome will have {{to stand in front}} of Obama's 'death panel' so his bureaucrats can decide, based on a subjective judgment of their 'level of productivity in society,' whether they are worthy of health care." [...] The Associated Press reported: [...] "Palin and other critics are wrong." [...] The provision of <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>bill</b> to which Palin referred (on page 425) merely authorizes Medicare reimbursement for physicians who provide voluntary counseling about such subjects as living wills. Howard Dean, the former Chair of the Democratic National Committee, said that Palin [...] "just made that up. Just like the 'Bridge to Nowhere' that she supposedly didn't support." [...] Republicans were divided. Former Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Newt Gingrich agreed with Palin, saying that [...] "there are clearly people in America who believe in establishing euthanasia, including selective standards." [...] Palin's [...] "death panels" [...] comment was selected as the [...] "Lie of the Year" [...] by PolitiFact.com, the fact-checking website of the St. Petersburg Times. Palin was also criticized for having invoked her infant for political purposes.|$|E

5000|$|Section 309 of the Indian Penal Code {{was set to}} {{be limited}} in effect by <b>the</b> Mental <b>Health</b> <b>Care</b> <b>Bill,</b> 2013. <b>The</b> Mental <b>Health</b> <b>Care</b> <b>Bill</b> was {{introduced}} to the Rajya Sabha on August 19, 2013 and provides, in article 124, that [...] "Notwithstanding anything contained in section 309 of the Indian Penal Code, any person who attempts to commit suicide shall be presumed, unless proved otherwise, to be suffering from mental illness at the time of attempting suicide and shall not be liable to punishment under the said section." [...] It also provides that the Government shall have the duty to provide medical care to any such person attempting suicide.
