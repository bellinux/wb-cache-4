50|$|Antenna bridges {{have long}} {{been used in the}} {{broadcast}} industry to tune antennas. A bridge is available which measures complex impedance while the transmitter is operating, practically a necessity when tuning multi <b>tower</b> <b>antenna</b> systems. In more recent times the direct reading network analyzers have become more common.|$|E
500|$|Tokyo Tower, {{a member}} of the World Federation of Great Towers, is used by many {{organizations}} for broadcasting purposes. The structure was intended for broadcasting television, but radio antennas were installed in 1961 because it could accommodate them.

25|$|From a {{standing}} start in December 1954, {{many thousands of}} skilled workers were recruited, transported to the polar regions, housed, fed, and supplied with tools, machines, and materials to construct physical facilities – buildings, roads, tanks, <b>towers,</b> <b>antennas,</b> airfields, and hangars – {{in some of the}} most hostile and isolated environments in North America. The construction project employed about 25,000 people.|$|R
50|$|WTKT (1460 kHz, 1460 The Ticket) is an AM {{radio station}} in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The station {{broadcasts}} at 1460 kHz with 5,000 watts power daytime non-directional and 4,200 watts night time power from a three <b>tower</b> <b>antenna</b> array in Summerdale, Pennsylvania. WTKT is the flagship station for Harrisburg Senators minor league baseball.|$|E

50|$|A {{gas-filled}} tube {{can also be}} used as a shunt, particularly in a lightning arrestor. Neon and other noble gases have a high breakdown voltage, so that normally current will not flow across it. However, a direct lightning strike (such as on a radio <b>tower</b> <b>antenna)</b> will cause the shunt to arc and conduct the massive amount of electricity to ground, protecting transmitters and other equipment.|$|E
40|$|Before the {{developement}} of radar, television, {{and frequency}} modulated communications equipment, stations were operated at relatively low frequencies. The long wavelengths employed dictated {{the use of}} long wire or <b>tower</b> <b>antennas</b> with the inherent problems due to {{the proximity of the}} earth. Although these problems can be greatly reduced by using a dipole antenna mounted several wavelengths above the earth, all physical dimensions are too large except at high frequencies...|$|R
50|$|The station began {{broadcasting}} in 1958 as CJDV, {{until it}} changed {{to its current}} callsign in 1981. It is a Class B station broadcasting with a power of 50,000 watts, and using a two <b>tower</b> directional <b>antenna</b> daytime and a four <b>tower</b> directional <b>antenna</b> nighttime. In 2016, it adopted the CFCW branding, currently used by another Newcap radio station, CFCW, on 840 kHz, unifying branding between two AM Country music radio stations serving both Northern/Central Alberta, and Southern Alberta.|$|R
50|$|Kuala Lumpur Tower, {{a member}} of the World Federation of Great Towers, is {{utilised}} by several organisations for various broadcasting purposes. Originally intended only for television broadcasting, radio antennas were included during the construction. The tower now broadcasts free-to-air terrestrial television stations that use the <b>tower's</b> <b>antenna</b> include:Media telecommunications and broadcasting mast. Television stations which are transmitted from the tower includes private (commercial) station, NTV7 a subsidiary of Media Prima Berhad broadcasting through UHF obtained from an antenna by 200 metres.|$|R
50|$|During {{the time}} of the murder, Kenneth claimed he was in San Mateo, California, far from his house, looking at real estate. However, Craig Frost from Verizon Wireless {{examined}} the firm's cellular telephone records and determined that a Fitzhugh telephone call that happened just a few minutes before the murder did not use a cellular <b>tower</b> <b>antenna</b> in San Mateo but rather a Palo Alto antenna that served Fitzhugh's own neighborhood.|$|E
50|$|At the {{beginning}} DZRL was first housed at {{second floor of}} the Mangapit building, located {{just in front of the}} EUREKA High School in Batac Ilocos Norte, equipped with a brand new 1k NEC transmitter but without a <b>tower</b> <b>antenna,</b> limiting its signal reach. The following year DZRL transferred to a better and bigger location at Brgy. 7 Caunayan, Batac City, Ilocos Norte, situated along the Laoag-Manila Highway. The station is at this site to this day.|$|E
50|$|In 1983, WVON flipped its callsign to WGCI AM {{to match}} its FM partner. Into the early 1980s, WGCI FM and AM {{broadcast}} with 33,000 watts atop the Civic Opera House - Kemper Insurance Building at 20 North Wacker Drive at 625 feet above average terrain. It was from this transmitter location, that the station climbed {{to become the}} #1 FM and #1 station overall in Chicago. That location is a back-up, in emergency, to the Willis <b>Tower</b> <b>antenna.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Ground leases {{generally}} address <b>antenna</b> <b>towers</b> or billboards {{in which}} the landowner leases the space, or land, to the cellular provider to build the <b>tower.</b> [...] <b>Antenna</b> <b>towers</b> range between 50 to 300 feet tall. These large, free standing cellular towers can sometimes be “disguised” {{to blend in with}} the natural architecture of the building or the surrounding landscape. An example of this is a church property that may have a tower built to resemble, or in some cases built into an existing steeple. Alternatively, a property owner for another type of property may have a monopine or monopalm cellular structure. These are built to resemble pine or palm trees respectively.|$|R

50|$|In addition, {{being the}} first station on 640 kHz, KFI would not be {{required}} to erect a directional antenna system to protect other stations. Those that came on the air on 640 kHz following KFI would, instead, have to protect it. With its low operating frequency, its 50,000 watts of power, and its non-directional, 722-foot, single <b>tower,</b> <b>antenna</b> system, KFI's night-time signal could be heard over vast sections of the United States and various parts of the world.|$|E
5000|$|Programming on WCFO {{includes}} both nationally syndicated and locally produced news, information, and talk programs. CBS Radio News is carried {{at the top}} of most hours and radio personality Matthew Erich Muller, known on-air as [...] "Mancow", weekday mornings. WCFO broadcasts with a power of 50,000 watts during the day with a directional antenna pattern using a four <b>tower</b> <b>antenna</b> array, and 160 watts of power at night using one antenna tower in an omnidirectional antenna pattern.|$|E
50|$|The {{frequency}} of WTTH changed September 7, 1949 {{to the present}} day 1380 kHz using a directional three <b>tower</b> <b>antenna</b> array at the Dove Road site. It would remain there until December 1961 when a construction permit was filed to move the station south to St. Clair Township with a seven tower array and a power boost to 5,000 watts. The Times Hearld sold the station to Enterform in 1967 which was then followed by a call sign change to WPHM.|$|E
50|$|Along {{with the}} installers of the <b>tower</b> <b>antennas,</b> other crews climb the towers to perform {{condition}} checks of the towers, guy lines and lighting systems. One {{of the most}} demanding aspects of many tower climber jobs is hauling materials and tools up to the proper installation height on the tower. In most cases, the climber scales the tower to the desired height and lowers a rope to a ground crew member who then ties it to a needed part on the ground. The tower worker then pulls the piece up and secures the rope before installing the part onto the tower.|$|R

5000|$|A {{macrocell}} is a cell in {{a mobile}} phone network that provides radio coverage served by a high power cell site (<b>tower,</b> <b>antenna</b> or mast). Generally, macrocells provide coverage larger than microcell. The antennas for macrocells are mounted on ground-based masts, rooftops and other existing structures, at a height that provides a clear view over the surrounding buildings and terrain [...] Macrocell base stations have power outputs of typically tens of watts. Macrocell performance can be increased by increasing {{the efficiency of the}} transreciever.|$|E
50|$|WKXQ (1600 AM) was an American {{radio station}} {{licensed}} {{to serve the}} community of Reidsville, North Carolina. WKXQ {{was one of three}} radio stations licensed to operate in the city and one of seven that once operated in Rockingham County, North Carolina. The station was licensed to broadcast on 1600 kHz. Its power output was 1,000 watts and used a three <b>tower</b> <b>antenna</b> system, broadcasting both day and night at full power from the transmitter site located on North Carolina Highway 87, west of Reidsville.|$|E
