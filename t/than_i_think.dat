500|$|Stefani was {{the first}} artist Oxley wrote a song for outside of Keane, and the singer remarked that [...] "he's like Clark Kent-subtle, but Superman-talented. I'm lucky I was his first, because I'm sure he's going to go write with lots of girls after me." [...] Oxley would later {{collaborate}} with artists like Australian singer Kylie Minogue, and in an interview he talked about working with her and Stefani, saying [...] "I've been very lucky {{to work with people}} {{at the top of the}} industry. Both were very talented and more creative <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> they’re given credit for. They’re both very good writers and singers and they both work so hard, just grafting the whole time. Honing those pop sensibilities through writing with them was good fun".|$|E
500|$|Some {{brand and}} {{marketing}} experts {{have come out}} {{in support of the}} name change. Nigel Currie, director of sports marketing agency Brand Rapport, stated that [...] "the whole process has been conducted badly with the supporters, but [...] is a pretty sound idea." [...] Simon Chadwick, professor of Sport Business Strategy and Marketing at the Coventry University Business School, opined that the objective of opening up lucrative new markets for shirt sales, merchandise and broadcast deals shows commercial vision and could bring benefits, but [...] "this needs to be backed up by a proper marketing strategy and investment." [...] He said, [...] "it's no use thinking changing the name or the colour of the shirt will pay instant dividends." [...] David Stern, commissioner of the National Basketball Association in the United States, warned: [...] "I would say a wise owner [...] would view his ownership as something of a public trust, in addition to the profit motive, and you really do want to allow the fans a little bit more input <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> is being allowed, with respect to Hull." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{writers were}} new to screenwriting, so their film {{treatment}} ran to 110-pages; the average was 15 pages. Reitman and Simmons pitched it to various Hollywood studios. Simmons met with Ned Tanen, {{an executive at}} Universal Studios. He was encouraged by younger executives Sean Daniel and Thom Mount who were more receptive to the Lampoon type of humor; Mount had discovered the [...] "Seven Fires" [...] film treatment as Tanen's assistant, while investigating projects left by a fired studio executive. Tanen hated the idea. Ramis remembers, [...] "We went further <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> Universal expected or wanted. I think they were shocked and appalled. Chris' fraternity had virtually been a vomiting cult. And {{we had a lot}} of scenes that were almost orgies of vomit... We didn't back off anything". As the writers created more drafts of the screenplay (nine in total), the studio gradually became more receptive to the project, especially Mount, who championed it. The studio green-lighted the film and set the budget at a modest $3 million. Simmons remembers, [...] "They just figured, 'Screw it, it's a silly little movie, and we’ll make a couple of bucks if we're lucky—let them do whatever they want.' ...|$|E

2500|$|During an {{interview}} with The Blaze, O'Reilly said: [...] "And if that moron [...] doesn't {{think it was a}} war zone in Buenos Aires, then he's even dumber <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> he is." [...] This characterization by O'Reilly was disputed by former CBS colleague Eric Engberg who was in Buenos Aires at the time and challenged his (O'Reilly's) description of the riot as a [...] "combat situation". Engberg went on to say it was a moderate riot and he heard no [...] "shots fired" [...] and saw no [...] "ambulances or tanks" [...] in the streets. The following week O'Reilly contradicted Engberg's claims, presenting archived CBS video of the riot that ensued after Argentine's surrender. The video appears to show riot police firing tear gas and plastic bullets toward the crowd; additionally, former NBC bureau chief Don Browne referred to the riot as an [...] "intense situation", with many people hurt and tanks in the streets of Buenos Aires.|$|E
2500|$|Jobs {{would later}} credit his fourth grade teacher, Imogene 'Teddy' Hill, with turning him around: [...] "She taught an {{advanced}} fourth grade class {{and it took}} her about a month to get hip to my situation. She bribed me into learning. She would say, 'I really want you to finish this workbook. I'll give you five bucks if you finish it.' That really kindled a passion in me for learning things! I learned more that year <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> I learned in any other year in school. They wanted me to skip {{the next two years}} in grade school and go straight to junior high to learn a foreign language but my parents very wisely wouldn't let it happen." [...] Jobs skipped the fifth grade and transferred to the sixth grade at Crittenden Middle School in Mountain View where he became a [...] "socially awkward loner." [...] Jobs [...] "was often bullied" [...] and gave his parents an ultimatum: they had to either take him out of Crittenden or he would drop out of school.|$|E
