The inn was partly based on the Madonna Inn, which, as in the episode, {{features}} different kinds of sex-oriented rooms with unusual names that are supposed to spice up a couple's love life. The design of the old farmhouse was inspired by the house featured in the 1993 film Flesh and Bone. Bart's obsession with conspiracy theories was inspired by the writers' observation that children around Bart's age go through a stage where they become [...] "addicted" [...] to information about UFOs and paranormal phenomena. Bill Oakley himself had gone <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> when he was around 10 years old.|$|E
500|$|While he commended {{the album}} for its [...] "variable quality", Alexis Petridis for The Guardian felt the record {{would not be}} able to transcend its target market, a core {{audience}} aged approximately 8 to 12 and female: [...] "To anyone else, the mystery of One Direction's success – or at least the sheer scale of it – remains as opaque as ever." [...] The latter view was shared by Ben Rayner of the Toronto Star: [...] "Unless you’re in the target demographic or are, perhaps, a mom who lived <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> in her youth, there's no point in even going near this record, of course, but the rest of us were never meant to in the first place." [...] Writing for HitFix, Melinda Newman maintained that the album [...] "masterfully hits its target", and concluded as follows: [...] "I’m so far out of the One Dimension demographic, I practically need a GPS to find it." ...|$|E

Believing she is depressed, her mother Frannie urges her to attend a weekly cancer patient support group to help her make friends with individuals who are going <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing.</b> There Hazel meets Augustus Waters, a charming teenager who lost a leg from bone cancer but has since apparently been cancer-free. He invites Hazel to his house where they bond over their hobbies and agree to read each other's favorite book. Hazel recommends An Imperial Affliction, a novel about a cancer-stricken girl named Anna that parallels her experience, and Augustus gives Hazel Counter Insurgence. They keep in touch via text over the weeks that follow and grow closer. After Augustus finishes the book, he expresses frustration with its abrupt ending (it ends {{in the middle of}} a sentence). Hazel explains that the novel's mysterious author, Peter Van Houten (Willem Dafoe), retreated to Amsterdam following the novel's publication and has not been heard from since.|$|E

They all went <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing,</b> where you have a day where you just go, 'Wow, I can't seem to function!'".

She added that the cast were [...] "really nice" [...] and that she got used to the quick pace of filming. Badler's debut episode aired on 22 June 2010.

500|$|Props {{specialist}} Ken Hawryliw {{claimed the}} biggest challenge in producing the episode was finding Christmas paper from the 1980s for the flashback sequences. Casting director Corrine Mays had difficulty finding an actress to play Dana Scully's 1976 self before executive producer Robert Goodwin {{came up with the}} idea of using Gillian Anderson's fourteen-year-old sister Zoë for the role. Gillian Anderson, while liking the finalized episode, believed that she never was able to capture the complex relationship between herself and Emily, stating: [...] "I felt in the end that I was a little low energy, a little too melancholy. It was hard to find the right attitude for Scully in dealing with a child that's apparently hers; to find the right flavor of relationship to her and this disease she's going through, all mixed up with the aspect of the paranormal." [...] Anderson also admitted that another issue she had was that [...] "she had no history with this child" [...] so she was unable to [...] "play the kind of attachment I would feel if my own daughter, Piper, were going <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing.</b>|$|E

5000|$|In {{its first}} manifesto, also {{conceived}} by Brătianu, the paper exhorted the Romanians {{of both countries}} {{to reflect on their}} shared lineage: [...] "Romanians' interests are identical, they had to suffer <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>things,</b> and they have <b>the</b> <b>same</b> ideas about what they should do to make things better for themselves." [...] Bibliographer Eugène Hatin notes that, together with the more moderate Naționalul, the [...] "ultra-liberal" [...] Rosettist tribune had [...] "the greatest influence on those events which, in Romania, marked the years 1857 to 1859." [...] Românul hosted contributions from the archeologist and political agitator Cezar Bolliac, who spoke out against the anti-Wallachian government of Moldavia. Bolliac attacked separatist Nicolae Vogoride for having shut down the unionist mouthpiece Steaua Dunării, and demanded freedom of the press. C. A. Rosetti himself was Secretary of the Bucharest ad-hoc Divan, which confirmed the new Moldavian prince Alexander John Cuza as prince of Wallachia. Rosetti then journeyed to Moldavia, as president of the delegation which informed Cuza that the personal union had been effected. He is also credited with having put together the [...] "Red" [...] contingency plan, that of a [...] "revolution", had the Bucharest Divan opted not to elect Cuza.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the next}} few minutes, {{we are going to}} talk about what it’s like to have a family member with Bipolar Disorder. If you are the brother or sister of someone with this disorder, then this {{information}} is especially important for you. You probably have tons of questions about what your family is going through. Listening to this information will give you some good ideas for how to deal with this, and help you understand a little more about Bipolar Disorder. First, I would like to share with you a poem called “My Own Waves ” that was written by a boy named Travis who has Bipolar Disorder. Travis wrote this when he was 11 years old. His poem is about what he thinks it’s like to have Bipolar Disorder.

2500|$|The band {{released}} the album's first single [...] "This Is Music" [...] in May, and it reached No.35, their first single {{to reach the}} Top 40. It was followed by [...] "On Your Own" [...] in June which performed even better, reaching No.28. This single was particularly new for the Verve {{as it was a}} soulful ballad. The album reached the UK Top 20 upon its release in July, but Ashcroft broke up the band three months later, just before the release of the third single [...] "History", which reached No.24 in September. Ashcroft later stated: [...] "I knew that I had to do it earlier on, but I just wouldn't face it. Once you're not happy in anything, there's no point living in it, is there? But my addiction to playing and writing and being in this band was so great that I wouldn't do anything about it. It felt awful because {{it could have been the}} greatest time of our lives, with [...] "History" [...] doing well, but I still think I can look myself in the mirror in 30 years time and say, 'Yeah man, you did the right thing.'

2500|$|One {{must first}} learn to know himself before knowing {{anything}} else (γνῶθι σεαυτόν). Not until {{a man has}} inwardly understood himself and then sees the course he is to take does his life gain peace and meaning; only then is he free of that irksome, sinister traveling companion — that irony of life, which manifests itself {{in the sphere of}} knowledge and invites true knowing to begin with a not-knowing (Socrates) just as God created the world from nothing. But in the waters of morality it is especially at home to those who still have not entered the tradewinds of virtue. Here it tumbles a person about in a horrible way, for a time lets him feel happy and content in his resolve to go ahead along the right path, then hurls him into the abyss of despair. Often it lulls a man to sleep with the thought, [...] "After all, things cannot be otherwise," [...] only to awaken him suddenly to a rigorous interrogation. Frequently it seems to let a veil of forgetfulness fall over the past, only to make every single trifle appear in a strong light again. When he struggles along the right path, rejoicing in having overcome temptation's power, there may come at almost the same time, right on the heels of perfect victory, an apparently insignificant external circumstance which pushes him down, like Sisyphus, from the height of the crag. Often when a person has concentrated on something, a minor external circumstance arises which destroys everything. (As {{in the case of a}} man who, weary of life, is about to throw himself into the Thames and at the crucial moment is halted by the sting of a mosquito.) Frequently a person feels his very best when the illness is the worst, as in tuberculosis. In vain he tries to resist it but he has not sufficient strength, and it is no help to him that he has gone <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> many times; the kind of practice acquired in this way does not apply here.|$|E

After three or four ceremonies, you get accustomed to it, no doubt; but the first dip, everybody allows, is awful.|$|E

Samantha sees this and quickly goes to Taylor's house and finds her trying to commit suicide by {{overdosing}} with pills, but cannot get the cap off. Taylor is then sent to a hospital. Taylor's mom learns from the incident and takes on the school system and state legislation to prevent others from going <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> problem as her daughter.

Curious about Carl's missing eye, Negan asks him to remove his bandage, and when Carl expresses reluctance, he reminds him that he owes him for the two men he killed. When Carl reveals the huge hole where his right eye used to be, Negan begins to rave about how disgusting it is and asks if he can touch it. Humiliated, Carl starts crying. Upon seeing that his comments have upset Carl, Negan stops and apologizes to him for hurting his feelings. Negan advises Carl to leave the bandage off so nobody will mess with him, but then orders him to sing him a song as part of his debt; Carl sings [...] "You Are My Sunshine". After being asked about his mother, Carl explains that he shot her to prevent her from turning. Negan then takes him to witness Mark's branding with a hot iron as punishment for his infraction. This incident has a visible effect on Dwight, who went <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> exact <b>thing</b> himself after betraying Negan.|$|R

After two years of abuse her dad was transferred to another city and the trafficking stopped. It took Flores many years to speak about her experiences. Flores received her bachelor's degree from Ball State University in Social work and continued her education at the University of Dayton in Ohio, getting her Master's degree in Counseling Education, specializing in Human Development so she could help people who have gone <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> or similar <b>things</b> she has.|$|R
