2500|$|Since its {{inception}} in 2000, the Cuban Day Parade of New Jersey {{has become a major}} annual event in North Hudson, beginning in North Bergen and traveling south to its end in Union City. Union City has historically been a family-oriented city predominantly made up of brownstones, two-family homes and locally owned businesses. Beginning approximately in 2003, it underwent a period of development of modestly sized residences, spurred by similar development in neighboring Hoboken, and the city's attempt to attract developers to what had historically been a town unfriendly to them, according to Mayor Brian P. Stack. Through approval of varied construction projects {{to address the needs of}} residents of different incomes, improved rent control laws and community input on such issues, this [...] "Hobokenization" [...] resulted in positive comparisons with the redeveloped Hoboken of the mid-to-late 1990s, with new restaurants, bars and art galleries cited as evidence of renewal. The city recorded $192 million in new construction in 2007, and 600 certificates of occupancy, with 500-700 projected for 2008–2009, compared with previous years, in which 50 certificates was considered a high amount. This development continued for several years, reaching a milestone in 2008 with the completion of Union City's first high-rise condominium tower, The Thread, whose name evokes the city's historical association with the embroidery industry. Other such buildings have followed, such as the Altessa, Park City Grand, and The Lenox. In 2015 <b>the</b> <b>AARP</b> ranked Union City #6 on its list of the best small cities to live in.|$|E
