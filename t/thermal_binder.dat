40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{determining}} {{the criteria for}} defect formation {{during the early stages}} of <b>thermal</b> <b>binder</b> removal within an ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) polymer filled with submicron SiC ceramic powder. The only product of the early stage thermal degradation reaction of EVA within an inert atmosphere is acetic acid. This single component and well characterized organic reaction product has allowed the defect forming criteria to be definitively examined. It will be shown that bloating occurs {{in the early stages of}} binder removal as a result of pressure build-up in the specimen resulting from acetic acid formed from the thermal elimination reaction of EVA. The first part of this paper examines defect formation occurring in the pure polymer within a hot-stage optical microscope. Bubble formation is observed in the pure polymer. Next, bloating occurring in the molded system is examined. The affect of mineral oil on bloating is also discussed as well as the effect that molding pressure has on bloating. It was found that molding pressure effects defect formation. Finally, this paper presents binder removal maps that were developed for specimens up to 8 mm thick. These bloating maps indicate the existence of two primary bloating regimes...|$|E
40|$|Debinding {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{critical}} and time consuming stage in metal injection moulding (MIM). German and Bose (1997) reported that early debinding practice relied on <b>thermal</b> <b>binder</b> degradation, requiring up to 300 hours for complete binder removal. Today multi-stage debinding techniques are introduced cutting down the debinding time to as little as 2 hours. This work investigates solvent debinding variables for samples made by MIM Ti 6 Al 4 V powder prior to thermal debinding. Solvent debinding is carried out in n-heptane. Wax and stearic acid are the target binder components being leached out from the green bodies, with wax as the major constituent in the binder formulation. Debinding is conducted at 50, 55, 60 and 65 °C for 1 - 4 hours at each temperature. Weight loss measurements were done. For porosity and surface appearance, scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis and visual inspection were done. Samples debound at 65 °C showed an appreciable amount of mass loss; however, surface cracks and warping were observed. A 60 °C temperature and time of 4 hours demonstrated best results i. e. a satisfactory mass loss, absence of surface cracks and no warping. Mass loss is directly proportional to temperature and time. SEM results are discussed in the paper. [URL]...|$|E

Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) indicated that the thermal decomposition of PBXs based on mixture of HMX and TATB was occurred in a three-steps. The first step was mainly due to decomposition of HMX. The second step was ascribed due to decomposition of TATB, while the third step was occurred due to decomposition of the polymer matrices. The thermal decomposition % was increased with increasing HMX amount. The kinetics related to thermal decomposition were investigated under non-isothermal for a single heating rate measurement.

40|$|Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) {{concrete}} can {{be classified}} as a fire resistant construction material. However, spalling may occur in fire especially in high strength concretes. The need to address this spalling problem in fire has intensified since the use of high rise buildings. Geopolymer is a cementless concrete binder {{which is based on}} aluminosilicate reaction of fly ash, a power plant by-product and activated by alkaline solution. Recent research has shown that geopolymer concrete has great potential in resisting fire. In addition, without the presence of Portland cement in the concrete has led to more sustainable construction material since cement is the second highest CO 2 emitter after fossil fuels. In this research, the severity of large scale high strength concrete spalling under hydrocarbon fire was investigated. The results show that high strength OPC concrete severely spalled during the first 30 minutes of fire exposure in explosive manner. There is a thermal diffusivity drop when the temperature is between 110 oC and 155 oC due to water in concrete changing phase to steam. Maximum steam pressure corresponds to 155 oC temperature is 0. 44 MPa which shows that steam pressure alone is not a critical factor for concrete spalling. Further investigations on factors affecting concrete spalling show that larger specimen spalled more than smaller scale specimen based on 3 m x 3 m walls, 1 m x 1 m walls, columns and cylinders. Aggregates size effect was also observed with increasing spalling with decreasing aggregate size. No obvious trend observed for different aggregate types (granite and basalt). For making geopolymer, fly ashes from Gladstone, Tarong and Microash were examined for physical properties. Gladstone fly ash demonstrated the best workability compared with Tarong and Microash. The reasons for workability differences were investigated and the conclusion was agglomerated particle size distribution was the cause Effect of dry and wet condition on strength of geopolymer was investigated. Strength reduction of 17 % was observed. The high strength geopolymer 1 m x 1 m wall panels and two sizes of cylinders (150, 100 mm) were tested. From hydrocarbon fire test, high strength geopolymer concrete exhibited good fire resistance performance due to no explosive spalling observed. Two iii panels and all cylinders remained un-spalled. Less than 1 % spalling (excluding moisture loss) observed on 2 spalled panels. There are 11 % - 65 % of residual strengths observed on fire tested specimens as compared to OPC which has no remaining strength.
