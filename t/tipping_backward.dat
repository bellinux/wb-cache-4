30|$|A growing {{issue in}} the paralympic {{movement}} {{is the impact of}} equipment on performance. In this systematic review, equipment was defined as a covariate in relation to the study goal. Athletes are competitive by nature and will try to enhance their performance as well as limit the impact of impairment on performance by using optimised equipment. This use of equipment is sport specific and often based on experience. However, the equipment permitted in wheelchair court sports shows similarities across sports [12 - 14]. Studies in this review explored the use of belts and straps, wheelchair set up, seating configuration and functional electrical stimulation (FES). Two studies assessed the possible influence of equipment in relation to trunk impairment [36, 38] though equipment that is not used for wheelchair court sports was tested [13, 16]. The only study that assessed equipment used in court sports found that multidirectional reach improves in athletes with SCI by the use of a thigh or trunk belt [31]. Reach {{is only one of the}} many relevant activities for wheelchair court sport, and in addition to belting, the chair set up (position of the seat and the backrest and height of the backrest) is also believed to impact on reach [16]. In one study, FES of the trunk extensor muscles was used to improve unsupported seating and to lift objects with different weights [39]. Functional electrical stimulation primarily impacts on impairment in muscle strength. The use of implanted electrodes as a piece of equipment is new to moment in the paralympic movement. So far, there is no consensus if this equipment should be allowed during sport performance and whether or not this equipment should be part of athlete evaluation in classification [43]. On the other hand, in the study exploring the effect of trunk impairment on acceleration in wheelchair racing, athletes used their own custom designed wheelchair. It must be noted that a racing wheelchair seating configuration is quite different from the configuration of a wheelchair for court sports. Opposite to wheelchairs used for court sports, the racing wheelchair does not have rear castor wheels to prevent tipping when maximum force is applied on the wheel [44]. As a consequence of the absence of the castor wheel, the racing athletes in this study may not have been able to use maximum force in accelerating, because of the risk of <b>tipping</b> <b>backward.</b> This limits the generalisation of the results of this study regarding the impact of trunk impairment on acceleration to wheelchair court sports. Additional research is necessary to examine the acceleration in a court sports wheelchair with the typical rear castor wheels to determine if trunk muscle strength does impact on acceleration when tipping of the chair is prevented.|$|E

40|$|Comfortable {{propulsion}} and support, light weight, {{and small}} dimensions are important features that help preserve upper-limb integrity of manual wheelchair users and improve accessibility. The titanium wheelchair {{is a product}} developed {{in response to these}} goals, but none of the test results of titanium wheelchairs had been disclosed before this study was performed. We hypothesized that these titanium wheelchairs would be in compliance with American National Standards Institute (ANSI) /Rehabilitation Engineering and Assistive Technology Society of North America (RESNA) standards. We tested 12 ultralight titanium rigid-frame wheelchairs (4 models) using ANSI/RESNA testing procedures and compared the test results with previously tested ultralight and lightweight aluminum wheelchairs. All wheelchairs passed the forward braking effectiveness test, but eight wheelchairs <b>tipped</b> <b>backward</b> before inclining to 7 ° in the rearward braking effectiveness test. All wheelchairs passed the impact strength tests, but six wheelchairs failed in the static strength tests. Three wheelchairs successfully completed the fatigue tests, but the remaining wheelchairs failed prematurely.

40|$|A {{series of}} commercially {{available}} titanium ultralight wheelchairs were tested using ANSI/RESNA testing procedures, and their durability was compared with previously tested aluminum ultralight wheelchairs and light-weight wheelchairs. Three {{of each of}} the following titanium wheelchairs were tested: Invacare-TopEnd, Invacare-A 4, Quickie-Ti, and TiLite-ZRA. The Quickie-Ti wheelchairs had the most forward and rearward center of gravity adjustability. All of the titanium wheelchairs passed the forward braking effectiveness test, but two chairs of each model <b>tipped</b> <b>backward</b> before the platform inclining to 7 degree in the rearward braking effectiveness test. All titanium wheelchairs passed the impact strength tests, but two failed in the static strength tests: two Invacare-TopEnd wheelchairs and one Invacare-A 4 wheelchair failed due to deformation of the armrest mounting plates, and the handgrips of the TiLite-ZRA wheelchairs slid off the push handles. Two Invacare-A 4 and one Invacare-TopEnd successfully completed the double drum and curb drop tests, but the remaining 9 wheelchairs failed prematurely. No significant differences were found in the number of the equivalent cycles or the value among the four models. The titanium ultralight wheelchairs had less equivalent cycles and value than the aluminum ultralight wheelchairs that were tested in a previous study. The failure modes in the static strength tests and the fatigue tests were consistent within the model, and revealed important design issues for each model.

40|$|In mixing highly viscous materials, like polymers, foods, and rubbers, the {{geometric}} {{structure of the}} mixing device is a determining factor {{for the quality of}} the mixing process. In pitched-tip kneading disks (ptKD), a novel type of mixing element, based on conventional kneading disks (KD), the tip angle is modified to change the channel geometry as well as the drag ability of KD. We discuss the effects of the tip angle in ptKD on mixing characteristics based on numerical simulation of the flow in the melt-mixing zone under different feed rates and a screw rotation speed. It turns out that the passage of fluid through the high-stress regions increases in ptKD compared to conventional KD regardless of the directions and sizes of the tip angle, while the fluctuation in residence time stays at the same level as the conventional KD. Furthermore, pitched <b>tips</b> of <b>backward</b> direction increase the mean applied stress on the fluid elements during its residence in the melt-mixing zone, suggesting the enhancement of dispersive mixing quality in ptKD. These understandings {{of the role of the}} tip angle on KD can give a basic guide in selecting and designing suitable angle parameters of ptKD for different mixing purposes...|$|R

Particular attention was paid to the changed position of the upper segment in relation to the basal segment, compared with before and after active distraction. To monitor the position of the distracted upper bone segment, both the improvement in bony height and the angle of the distracted upper bone segment were scored using the menton-pogonion line as a reference plane. Surprisingly in nearly all patients there was a backward rotation of the segment with lingual-tipping of the upper segment by a mean of 12 degrees that meant that in such cases only 87 % of the maximum gain in bony height could be achieved.

40|$|PolyU Library Call No. : [THS] LG 51. H 577 P BSE 2017 Shenxxiv, 195 pages :color illustrationsIn this study, {{lightning}} initiation and propagation processes {{observed in}} both a negative rocket-triggered lightning discharge and a negative natural lightning discharge in southern China in 1999 were analyzed and discussed. Observations included a broadband VHF lightning interferometer and a slow antenna, {{both of which}} were located 90 m south of the rocket launcher, and a video camera, which was located 1. 3 km west of the launcher. First, by combining a picture from the camera with the VHF radiation source data from the interferometer, we obtained 3 D evolution of lightning processes in the triggered lightning discharge. The results showed that, while a classically-triggered negative discharge usually starts with a positive leader initiated from the tip of the ascending triggering-wire and moves upward, no such initial upward positive leader (UPL) was observed for the triggered discharge. This was probably due to the low resolution and sensitivity of the measurements. Instead, there was a downward negative leader (preliminary downward leader, PDL) at the preliminary stage of the discharge being observed, followed by an M-component-wise process and two leader/return-stroke processes. The PDL was most likely to be a leader process along the channel trace, possibly built by the undetected UPL, as its speed, which ranged from 3. 7 × 10 ⁶ m/s to 0. 3 × 10 ⁶ m/s, was similar to that of a dart leader in the existing literature. The M-component-wise process consists of a slow negative-going change stage (Ma), followed by a fast negative-going change stage (Mb) and a slow positive-going change stage (Mc). The Ma stage was found to be intra-cloud negative breakdowns moving towards the overhead position of the PDL trace. The Mb stage would be considered an M-component (channel brightening) that starts with a K breakdown in cloud (Mb 1) moving horizontally towards the overhead position of the previous PDL, followed by an event (Mb 2) moving up from ground to cloud along the PDL trace. As Mb 2 reached the cloud, more new K breakdowns (Mc) appeared in the cloud around the extremities of the pre-built channels by Ma and Mb. Each of the leaders before the return stroke with many VHF sources located could be divided into three stages; namely L 1 a, L 1 b and L 1 c and L 2 a, L 2 b and L 2 c. The elevations of VHF radiation sources showed a descending trend for L 1 a, a horizontally expanding trend for L 1 b and a sharply ascending trend for L 1 c, while the azimuths showed a slowly ascending trend for L 1 a and L 1 b, but a descending trend for L 1 c. The trends of L 2 a, L 2 b and L 2 c were similar. The leader preceding the first return stroke (L 1) started inside the cloud and propagated downward (L 1 a) to the triggering-wire trace, but with a different channel from that of the PDL. As the leader touched the triggering wire trace (L 1 b), it appeared to propagate upward (L 1 c) along the same channel of the PDL. The upward portion of the L 1 (L 1 c) could possibly be interpreted as a branching and reflection behavior of the L 1 current when it attached to the triggering-wire and PDL traces, due to the differences in conductivity and potential between the PDL and triggering wire traces and the L 1 channel. The speed of the downward portion of L 1 (L 1 a) decreased from 2. 32 × 10 ⁶ m/s to 0. 32 × 10 ⁶ m/s during descent, while that of the upward portion of L 1 (L 1 c) increased from 0. 85 × 10 ⁶ m/s to 2. 70 × 10 ⁶ m/s during ascent. The leader preceding the second return stroke (L 2) behaved similarly to L 1 but with higher speeds. Second, we proposed a new approach for estimating the line charge density along the channel of a downward negative leader, based on ground measurements of electric field change and leader spatial developments with a broadband interferometer system. In this approach, the two downward negative leaders in the triggered lightning flash were studied. Due to the limitations of the methods used, only the downward part of the first leader (L 1 a) and the second leader (L 2 a) were investigated in detail. The results showed that the line charge density of L 1 a showed a general trend to increase as it went down, with a few large pulses superposing on the general trend. These large pulses were most likely associated with the leader channel turns when comparing with the leader channel image. The line charge density of L 2 a was generally smaller than that of L 1 a but with a similar trend and pulses. The range of line charge density for both L 1 a and L 2 a was 0. 01 - 1. 00 mC/m. Third, we proposed a new approach for retrieving the pre-existing background electric field profile and, hence, the space charge distribution, along a lightning leader channel if the line charge density of the leader channel is given. This approach provides a new way to learn the electrical conditions of the initiation of lightning discharge in a thunderstorm. With this approach, and the line charge density data obtained in above study, the electric field profile and space charge distribution along the leader channels of L 1 a and L 2 a were obtained. The background electric field of L 1 a above 680 m high was almost linear and ranged from - 13 kV/m to 13 kV/m. The electric field under 680 m high was second order correlation with height and ranged from - 108 kV/m to 150 kV/m with some large bipolar pulses (1112 kV/m to 925 kV/m) superposing on the general trend. The results above are reasonable according to others' observations. The bipolar pulses of the background electric field meant that there were some positive charge groups when the leader propagated to the locations of the pulses. The space charge density of L 1 a increased as the leader developed. The general range of the space charge density of L 1 a under 680 m high was - 3 nC/m³ to 5 nC/m³, with some unipolar pulses (- 31 nC/m³ to 72 nC/m³). The space charge density of L 1 a above 680 m high was very small and ranged from - 0. 8 nC/m 3 to 0. 4 nC/m³. These pulses indicate that there were positive charge groups present. The allocations of the pulses of the space charge density were the same as for the bipolar pulses of the background electric field, the pulses of the negative line charge density, and for the big curves of the L 1 a channel. Therefore, the complexity of environmental electrical conditions can cause distortion of the leader channel. Similar conclusions can be drawn for the L 2 a channel, except in the smaller range of the space charge density. The range of the space charge density for L 2 a was from - 0. 4 nC/m³ to 0. 45 nC/m³, with some large pulses ranging from - 8 nC/m³ to 8 nC/m³. Due to the limitations of this approach, the ranges of the background electric field and space charge density may not be accurate, but the trends and the pulses further our understanding of the propagation of lightning discharge. Fourth, using a similar approach as for the triggered lightning discharge, we studied the spatial and electrical properties of natural lightning discharge. As we had no optical images of the natural lightning, its channel was rebuilt by the data of the VHF source radiation from the broadband interferometer with a presumed height of the lightning initiation position in the cloud. Based on the approximate channel that was rebuilt, it was found that this discharge was a downward stepped-leader initiated negative cloud-toground discharge with only one leader/return stroke process. The general speed of the leader when it propagated horizontally in the cloud was 0. 4 × 10 ⁶ m/s to 1 × 10 ⁶ m/s, and when it propagated vertically was about 3. 5 × 10 ⁴ m/s to 1. 5 × 10 ⁵ m/s. The average speed was 7. 0 × 10 ⁴ m/s. As it went downward, the leader branched significantly. Additionally, while the leader moved downward, the VHF sources (breakdown processes) within branches around the leader <b>tip</b> frequently showed <b>backward</b> movements (about 400 m) with a speed of about 2 × 10 ⁶ m/s, which is much faster than the average leader downward speed of 7. 0 × 10 ⁴ m/s. Electrical properties of the leader above 3000 m were also obtained based on a rough leader channel without branches and backward movements. With the development of the leader channel, the leader brought negative charges downward along the leader channel and the changes of the electric field increased. The estimated line charge density showed a trend to increase as the leader propagated downward, ranging from - 0. 1 mC/m to - 1. 1 mC/m. The pulses of the leader charge density show that the leader transported plenty of negative charge when it propagated along the leader channel, which may have caused the curves of the leader channel. Lastly, the findings and their scientific merits are summarized and discussed. Through our study of artificially-triggered lightning discharge and natural lightning discharge, we know that while the cases analyzed here are special, they have some common features. The range and the trend of the electrical and spatial properties show the applicability of the approaches and models in my study. The changes of electric field observed on the ground, the space evolution of the lightning leader channel and the propagation speed of the leader channel were closely related to the spatial initial environment of the lightning discharge. Differences in environment can cause different propagated movement of lightning discharge, depending on the results. This means that a different distribution of space charge or a complex environmental electric field profile can lead to a complex leader channel and movement. A stronger background electric field indicates stronger VHF radiation sources, a faster speed of the leader channel, a more complex lightning channel and more charge in the leader channel. In future research, we need to improve the methods of observation, to obtain more detail of the lightning discharge. With high resolution observations and more sophisticated detail for the lightning discharge, additional spatial evolution characteristics and electrical properties of the discharge, such as the charge density of the branches of the leader channel, can be analyzed. The accuracy of the results also will be improved. Lightning discharge with more complicated initial electrical environments also can be studied in the future, using observation and simulation.
