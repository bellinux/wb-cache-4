5|$|Lhermitte {{filed for}} and {{received}} a judgment of divorce before her trial; Moqadem at first appealed the decision but later withdrew his objection. Following the trial, Lhermitte {{was not able to}} pay for the trial costs, so under Belgian law it fell <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>now</b> ex-husband to pick up the bill. This conformed to the Law of Belgium, with the state seeking funds due to have been shared from the sale of their house under their divorce agreement. The overall court expenses and fines were 72,743 euros (about $93,000). Moqadem said he was “disgusted and revolted” by the injustice of this billing system. Moqadem’s attorney attempted to have the bill written off, calling for “administrative requirements to be balanced by decency” given the nature of the tragedy.|$|E

As a result, Tiana has become absorbed with her work and doesn't have time for anything else. Tiana finds hope when her wealthy childhood best friend Charlotte pays her a lump sum of money to make and serve beignets at a masquerade ball she is hosting for the handsome but disinherited Prince Naveen.|$|E

2500|$|Author Dorothy Hobson has {{described}} Ian and Cindy's relationship as [...] "one {{of the most}} tempestuous in any soap opera". The characters were reunited on-screen in 1992 but the relationship ended in adultery once again when Cindy began an affair with Simon's brother David Wicks, which culminated in Cindy hiring an assassin to shoot Ian in 1996 after he discovered the affair. Michelle Collins who played Cindy commented in 1996, [...] " [...] was not thinking properly when she contacted the hitman, and she is being quite erratic. Despite what she has done she never expected Ian to be so cruel <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> <b>Now</b> she cannot really see any other {{way out of the}} mess she is in. She has lost touch with reality– but in the end she can't see any other way of escaping Ian." [...] More than 18 million viewers tuned in to see Ian gunned-down, which was more than sixty-four per cent of available viewers. The plot facilitated Collins' desire to leave the programme following the birth of her child, and Cindy, implicated in the shooting, fled the country with Ian's two sons.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, I promise that," [...] {{she said}} at length, and Henry felt himself gratified by her {{complete}} sincerity, and began <b>to</b> tell <b>her</b> <b>now</b> about the coal-mine, in obedience <b>to</b> <b>her</b> love of facts.|$|R
60|$|He was {{so close}} <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>now</b> that the words died away upon her lips.|$|E
60|$|She murmured, {{considered}} her own life, {{but could not}} describe how it looked <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>now.</b>|$|E
60|$|Mary caressed and soothed her, {{and told}} her she could well guess it was sadder <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>now</b> than even at first.|$|E
60|$|Just {{those words}} would Lady Ella have said <b>to</b> <b>her</b> husband <b>now,</b> {{but she was}} capable of no such rhetoric.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, mother, I depute you <b>to</b> tell <b>her</b> <b>now,</b> {{and pray}} {{do it without}} delay. I offered <b>to</b> give <b>her</b> up a short time ago, but she refused to listen to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh--I don't {{know what}} it was," [...] replied Lenore, with quavering voice. <b>Her</b> {{strength}} began <b>to</b> leave <b>her</b> <b>now.</b> <b>Her</b> arms that had held him so firmly began to slip away.|$|R
6000|$|... "Somewhat {{among the}} reeds. Hark <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>now!</b> She is singing, {{somewhat}} {{more like an}} angel than a fiend, I will say for her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So it appears," [...] {{she said}} indifferently. What cared she to what shore {{she was being}} taken: every land save England was exile <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>now.</b>|$|E
60|$|He was {{so close}} <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>now</b> {{that he could see}} the faintest tremor on the face that had {{suddenly}} become grey and still in the thin clear sunshine.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{have offered}} <b>to</b> marry <b>her</b> <b>now</b> that I can; but she won't marry me. Now {{what would you}} think of her--I put it to you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Choose your girl, Coddy. You've got <b>to</b> choose <b>her</b> <b>now.</b> And you'll {{get your}} neck broken {{if you play}} any more of your tricks, my boy. You're settled now.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] said Beatrice sharply, {{like one}} in pain. He {{had found the}} way <b>to</b> move <b>her</b> <b>now,</b> and with the cunning of semi-madness he drove the point home.|$|R
6000|$|... "Half-crazy! Toothless! Old! What do you mean, Mr. Eden? She {{is young}} and beautiful, and though I am nothing <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>now</b> I love her still {{with all my}} heart." ...|$|E
60|$|He obeyed. She {{stood with}} {{her eyes on the}} {{crumpled}} heap of bills. They were not even tidily arranged. That seemed <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>now</b> an extreme aggravation of her offence.|$|E
60|$|So high did she tower {{above them}} that her cannon were of no avail <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>now,</b> and locked closely {{together}} the sailors and soldiers fought {{as if on}} land.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think you}} had better go to bed, Gerald," [...] she said steadily. Nothing about him seemed <b>to</b> touch <b>her</b> <b>now,</b> neither {{the sight of him}} nor his shameless misery.|$|R

6000|$|Sad! <b>To</b> {{remember}} <b>her,</b> as I did, the liveliest, happiest {{child that}} ever laughed the day through, and <b>to</b> see <b>her</b> <b>now,</b> in the flower of her age and her beauty, so broken and so brought down as this! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thanks," [...] said Andrew. [...] "I'm {{going off}} <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>now.</b> Try {{to get into}} Marshall's hut and make a fire. We'll have to wait some time for the doctor." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It {{is a thing}} I must {{carefully}} consider,' he said, {{with the}} same gloomy dryness which characterized all his words <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>now.</b> 'When I have considered, I will tell you.' ...|$|E
