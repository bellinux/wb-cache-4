5|$|Comets can loosely {{be divided}} into two categories: short-period and long-period—the latter being <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> {{originate}} in the Oort cloud. The two major categories of short-period comets are Jupiter-family comets (JFCs) and Halley-type comets. Halley-type comets, which are named after their prototype, Halley's Comet, are <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> have originated in the Oort cloud but to have been drawn into the inner Solar System by the gravity of the giant planets, whereas the JFCs are <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> have originated in the scattered disc. The centaurs are <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> be a dynamically intermediate stage between the scattered disc and the Jupiter family.|$|E

5|$|Heterodontosaurus is the eponymous {{and best}} known {{member of the}} family Heterodontosauridae. This family is {{considered}} one of the most primitive or basal groups within the order of ornithischian dinosaurs. In spite of the large tusks, Heterodontosaurus is <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> have been herbivorous, or at least omnivorous. Though it was formerly <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> have been capable of quadrupedal locomotion, it is now <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> have been bipedal. Tooth replacement was sporadic and not continuous, unlike its relatives. At least four other heterodontosaurid genera are known from the same geological formations as Heterodontosaurus.|$|E
5|$|Leeds is <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> {{have been}} {{the site of the}} Roman town of Cambodunum, {{abandoned}} when the Romans left Britain in around 400AD. The first church in Leeds is <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> have been built around 600AD.|$|E

5|$|The {{remains of}} Achanduin Castle west of Achnacroish is also <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> {{date back to}} the 13th century. Built by the MacDougalls around 1290, who held it {{throughout}} the 14th century, the castle is then <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> have been held by the Bishops of Argyll until the mid 16th century. The castle overlooks the island of Bernera.|$|E

5|$|With its low-crowned teeth, Ferugliotherium {{may have}} been an {{insectivore}} or omnivore, like similar multituberculates such as Mesodma, which is <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> have eaten insects, other arthropods, seeds, and/or nuts. The wear on Ferugliotherium teeth suggests that the animal may have eaten some plant material. The high-crowned sudamericids are <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> have been herbivores feeding on abrasive vegetation, although their precise diet is not known. In the evolutionary history of gondwanatheres, hypsodont teeth are <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> have evolved from brachydont precursors. Gurovich hypothesizes that the anterior molariforms of sudamericids may have evolved from bladelike premolars as seen in Ferugliotherium.|$|E

5|$|A basic {{sub-division}} is a {{grouping of}} the eight inner regular moons, which have nearly circular orbits near the plane of Jupiter's equator and are <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> have formed with Jupiter. The remainder of the moons consist of {{an unknown number of}} small irregular moons with elliptical and inclined orbits, which are <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> be captured asteroids or fragments of captured asteroids. Irregular moons that belong to a group share similar orbital elements and thus may have a common origin, perhaps as a larger moon or captured body that broke up.|$|E

5|$|Although Mirza, Microcebus, and Allocebus form a clade within Cheirogaleidae, {{the three}} {{lineages}} are <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> have diverged during a narrow window of time, so the relationships within this clade {{are difficult to}} determine and may change with further research. All three are <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> have diverged at least 20mya (million years ago), although another estimate using mtDNA places the divergence between Mirza and Microcebus at 24.2mya. Divergence between the two recognized species of giant mouse lemur is estimated at 2.1mya.|$|E

5|$|Although cholangiocarcinoma {{is known}} to have the {{histological}} and molecular features of an adenocarcinoma of epithelial cells lining the biliary tract, the actual cell of origin is unknown. Recent evidence has suggested that the initial transformed cell that generates the primary tumor may arise from a pluripotent hepatic stem cell. Cholangiocarcinoma is <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> develop through a series of stages - from early hyperplasia and metaplasia, through dysplasia, to the development of frank carcinoma - in a process similar to that seen in the development of colon cancer. Chronic inflammation and obstruction of the bile ducts, and the resulting impaired bile flow, are <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> play a role in this progression.|$|E
5|$|Although most white dwarfs are <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> be {{composed}} of carbon and oxygen, spectroscopy typically shows that their emitted light comes from an atmosphere which is observed to be either hydrogen or helium dominated. The dominant element is usually at least 1,000 times more abundant than all other elements. As explained by Schatzman in the 1940s, the high surface gravity is <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> cause this purity by gravitationally separating the atmosphere so that heavy elements are below and the lighter above., §5–6 This atmosphere, {{the only part of}} the white dwarf visible to us, is <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> be the top of an envelope which is a residue of the star's envelope in the AGB phase and may also contain material accreted from the interstellar medium. The envelope is believed to consist of a helium-rich layer with mass no more than 1/100 of the star's total mass, which, if the atmosphere is hydrogen-dominated, is overlain by a hydrogen-rich layer with mass approximately 1/10,000 of the stars total mass., §4–5.|$|E
5|$|Anomalocaridids, such as Anomalocaris, were {{organism}}s <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> be distantly {{related to}} the arthropods. These creatures looked quite unlike any organism living today—they had segmented exoskeletons, with lateral lobes used for swimming, typically large compound eyes, often set on stalks, and most strikingly, a pair of large, claw-like great appendages that resembled headless shrimp. These appendages are <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> have passed food to the animal's mouth, which resembled a ring of sliced pineapple.|$|E
