25|$|E: As I lay in {{bed that}} night, I overheard the three doctors tell my parents {{in the other room}} that their boy would be dead in the morning. I felt intense anger that anyone should tell a mother her boy would be dead by morning. My mother then came in with as serene a face as can be. I asked her to arrange <b>the</b> <b>dresser,</b> push it up {{against the side of the}} bed at an angle. She did not {{understand}} why, she thought I was delirious. My speech was difficult. But at that angle by virtue of the mirror on <b>the</b> <b>dresser</b> I could see through the doorway, through the west window of the other room. I was damned if I would die without seeing one more sunset. If I had any skill in drawing, I could still sketch that sunset.|$|E

25|$|A {{scene in}} which a {{character}} is threatened with blinding {{in the manner of}} Gloucester forms the climax of the 1973 parody horror Theatre of Blood. Comic use is made of Sir's inability to physically carry any actress cast as Cordelia opposite his Lear in the 1983 film of the stage play <b>The</b> <b>Dresser.</b> John Boorman's 1990 Where the Heart Is features a father who disinherits his three spoilt children. Francis Ford Coppola deliberately incorporated elements of Lear in his 1990 sequel The Godfather Part III, including Michael Corleone's attempt to retire from crime throwing his domain into anarchy, and most obviously the death of his daughter in his arms. Parallels have also been drawn between Andy García's character Vincent and both Edgar and Edmund, and between Talia Shire's character Connie and Kaede in Ran.|$|E

Lancashire described <b>The</b> <b>Dresser</b> as [...] "the greatest piece ever written about actors" [...] and found both working with and observing McKellen and Hopkins– [...] "two of the greatest actors ever"– an extraordinary experience.

500|$|Sheen {{played the}} title role in Peer Gynt in 1994. The Yukio Ninagawa {{production}} was staged in Oslo, Tokyo and at the Barbican Centre, London. The Times praised Sheen's [...] "astonishing vitality" [...] while The Independent found him [...] "sensationally good" [...] and noted that [...] "the Norwegian press were grudgingly captivated by the mercurial Welsh boyo". In other 1994 work, Sheen appeared in Le Livre de Spencer at the Odéon-Théâtre de l'Europe, Paris and starred in the cross-dressing farce Charley's Aunt at the Royal Exchange. In 1995, he appeared opposite Kate Beckinsale in a production of The Seagull at the Theatre Royal, Bath and, with the encouragement of Thelma Holt, directed and starred in <b>The</b> <b>Dresser</b> at the Theatre Royal, Plymouth. In addition, Sheen made his film debut that year, appearing opposite Kenneth Branagh in Othello. 1996 saw Sheen at the National Theatre for The Ends of the Earth, an original play by David Lan. A minor role in [...] Mary Reilly marked {{the first of three}} film collaborations with director Stephen Frears. Sheen's most significant appearance of 1997 was {{the title role}} in Henry V, staged by the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) at their Stratford-upon-Avon theatre, which earned him a second Ian Charleson Award nomination. The Times praised [...] "a blisteringly intelligent performance". Also in 1997, he appeared in a revival of Harold Pinter's The Homecoming at the National Theatre, directed by Roger Michell, and directed Badfinger, starring Rhys Ifans, at the Donmar Warehouse. The latter was staged by the Thin Language Theatre Company, which Sheen had co-founded in 1991, aiming to further Welsh theatre. He then appeared in the biographical film Wilde, playing Robbie Ross to Stephen Fry's Oscar Wilde. In early 1998 Sheen formed a production company, The Foundry, with Helen McCrory and Robert Delamere to promote the work of emerging playwrights, and produced A Little World of Our Own at the Donmar Warehouse, which gave Colin Farrell his West End debut.|$|E

2500|$|In October 2015, Hopkins {{appeared}} as Sir in a BBC Two production of Ronald Harwood's <b>The</b> <b>Dresser,</b> alongside Ian McKellen, Edward Fox and Emily Watson. <b>The</b> <b>Dresser</b> {{is set in}} a London theatre during the Blitz, where an aging actor-manager, Sir, prepares for his starring role in King Lear {{with the help of his}} devoted dresser, Norman. Hopkins described his role as Sir as “the highlight of my life”. “It was a chance to work with the actors I had run away from.

2500|$|Seven of {{the houses}} have similar furniture, with the beds and dresser in the same places in each house. <b>The</b> <b>dresser</b> stands against the wall {{opposite}} the door, {{and was the first}} thing seen by anyone entering the dwelling. Each of these houses had the larger bed {{on the right side of}} the doorway and the smaller on the left. Lloyd Laing noted that this pattern accorded with Hebridean custom up to the early 20thcentury suggesting that the husband's bed was the larger and the wife's was the smaller. The discovery of beads and paint-pots in some of the smaller beds may support this interpretation. Additional support may come from the recognition that stone boxes lie to the left of most doorways, forcing the person entering the house to turn to the right-hand, [...] "male", side of the dwelling. At the front of each bed lie the stumps of stone pillars that may have supported a canopy of fur; another link with recent Hebridean style.|$|E
