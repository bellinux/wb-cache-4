5|$|In 1871, Darwin {{published}} The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, {{which contained}} {{his views on}} human evolution. Darwin argued that {{the differences between the}} human mind and the minds of the higher animals were a matter of degree rather than of kind. For example, he viewed morality as a natural outgrowth of instincts that were beneficial to animals living in social groups. He argued that all the differences between humans and apes were explained by a combination of the selective pressures that came from our ancestors moving from <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> <b>to</b> the plains, and sexual selection. The debate over human origins, and over the degree of human uniqueness continued well into the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|The wasps {{preferentially}} {{hunt for}} female cicadas {{because they have}} more consumable tissue, but male cicadas are easier to locate, which explains the systemic bias towards male kills. They chiefly hunt for Tibicen duryi, Tibicen dealbata and Tibicen parallela. Cicada killers are capable of thermoregulation, which allows them to hunt for cicadas during the day, when the cicadas are most prominent. The species is mostly harmless to humans. Some males when emerging early fly into <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> <b>to</b> feed on sap, and the species {{has been known to}} feed on nectar.|$|E
5|$|The badnjak ceremony, {{originally}} performed {{only within}} the family, became a more public celebration. A custom developed before WorldWarI in the Kingdom of Serbia to lay the badnjak on a fire built in military barracks, so that the soldiers stationed there over Christmas could share in the holiday atmosphere. In the succeeding Kingdom of Yugoslavia, the military badnjak ceremony was standardized in army service regulations. On Christmas Eve, {{under the command of}} a specially appointed officer, the representatives of military units of a garrison formed a festive procession on horses, accompanied with music. Members of citizens' associations and other civilians of the garrison town usually joined the procession as it proceeded to the nearest wood to collect the badnjak. They felled a set number of trees, dedicated respectively to the Royal Palace, the military command of the town, the respective commands of units of the garrison, its oldest officer, and its officers' assembly house. The procession brought <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> <b>to</b> the barracks, in whose yard an open fire was built. The garrison commander then placed the trees ceremonially on the fire, and gave an appropriate address.|$|E

5|$|Sinclair {{took up the}} {{environmental}} cause of her birthplace, the Lord Howe Island, in 1982, when it was listed as an UNESCO World Heritage Site. Though the islanders were pleased with the heritage status accorded to the island, Sinclair was unhappy {{with many of the}} planning and management actions initiated by the Government of Australia to conserve the newly accorded heritage status, as it affected the basic rights of the islanders. Her objections were to the cutting of pine trees planted in the 19th century; she considered these trees (though not indigenous) as part of the island's heritage. When the trees were being felled she threatened to lie down between <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> <b>to</b> stop the tree cutters. Her argument was that the trees added to the aesthetic beauty of the island. She also objected to the neglect of maintenance of embankments that were built to extend the airport on the island, as the embankments were eroding. She objected to the garbage that was being dumped in the lagoon of the island as it was causing health hazards. The management plan proposed by the government to preserve the island's heritage status envisaged restricting the tourist accommodation to about 400 and limiting the number of cars on the island to 100, which she objected for the reason that it was limiting the opportunities to the islanders who had lived there for many years. Another of her protests was on the creation of an aquatic reserve {{in a part of the}} island. She considered this action as detrimental to the fishing rights of the local people who had fished in the area for several years. All her objections resulted in the Ministry of Planning and Environment agreeing to address the issues she had raised. In 1967, she worked in the Prime Minister's Department and dealt with public relations and facilitated the Montreal Expo.|$|E

This is {{also a part of}} the green belt that runs through the fairy world. It is all part of Aeval’s plant network. Though others may doubt it, Aeval always knew that the trees saw and remembered everything. Over time they have been used to hide treasures and secrets. In The Book of Air, someone within the fairy world has turned <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> <b>to</b> gold, keeping them from “speaking” with Aeval. The trees are being used to protect a key – the very key the Clockmaker needs to fix his Time Synchronization Machine.

25|$|Cliff's {{patterns}} are highly stylised and interpreted in strong colours, {{such as the}} 1933 Honolulu pattern. The trees are enamelled in red (coral) orange and yellow.

25|$|Cocoa trees grow in hot, rainy {{tropical}} {{areas within}} 20° of latitude from the Equator.

Pesticides are often applied to <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> <b>to</b> combat capsid bugs, and fungicides to fight black pod disease.|$|E

25|$|In {{commercial}} forestry, the transplanting of crop {{trees in}} new locales often requires an accompanying ectomycorrhizal partner. This {{is especially true}} of trees that have a high degree of specificity for their mycobiont, or trees that are being planted far from their native habitat among novel fungal species. This has been shown time and again in plantations involving obligate ectomycorrhizal trees, such as Eucalyptus and Pinus species. Mass planting of these species often require human addition of inoculum from native EcM fungi in order for <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> <b>to</b> prosper.|$|E
25|$|Infant sloths {{normally}} {{cling to}} their mothers' fur, but occasionally fall off. Sloths are very sturdily built and rarely die from a fall. In some cases, they die from a fall indirectly because the mothers prove unwilling {{to leave the}} safety of <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> <b>to</b> retrieve the young. Females normally bear one baby every year, but sometimes sloths' low level of movement actually keeps females from finding males for longer than one year. Sloths are not particularly sexually dimorphic and several zoos have received sloths of the wrong sex.|$|E
25|$|The {{outer edge}} of the {{floating}} fabric was attached to a 30.5centimeter (12inch) diameter octagonal boom, in sections, of the same color as the fabric. The boom was connected to the radial anchor lines, which extended from the anchors at the island to the 610 specially made anchors, spaced at 15.3meter (50ft) intervals, 76meters (250ft) beyond the perimeter of each island, driven into the limestone {{at the bottom of the}} Bay. Earth anchors were driven into the land, near the foot of <b>the</b> <b>trees,</b> <b>to</b> secure the inland edge of the fabric, covering the surface of the beach and disappearing under the vegetation.|$|E

25|$|Pseudotsuga macrocarpa, {{has several}} {{features}} to tolerate and survive wildfire, notably the very thick bark, {{and the presence}} of numerous adventitious buds on the upper side of the branches; this enables <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> <b>to</b> survive even crown fires which burn off all the branchlets, the apparently dead trees becoming green again the following spring. Wildfire frequencies in the chaparral habitats in which it often grows typically range from 15-50 year intervals. Bigcone Douglas-fir is closely associated with canyon live oak (Quercus chrysolepis) and often establishes itself in its shade; after about 50 years, it emerges above the oak canopy.|$|E
25|$|The land west of Narnia is an {{uninhabited}} {{region of}} rugged mountains {{known as the}} Western Wild. The land of Telmar lies somewhere beyond this region, but its exact location was never documented - forgotten even by the Telmarines who invaded Narnia - and beyond it are the western islands. In the Western Wild is the hill upon which grows a sacred walled grove of magical apple trees guarded by the phoenix. Upon Aslan's explicit instruction, Digory takes an apple from one of <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> <b>to</b> enable a tree of protection for Narnia to be sown. This task and the resistance of temptation to return with the apple directly to his mother is to atone for his violence {{in the hall of}} images and for bringing Jadis into Narnia.|$|E

It {{is in fact the}} case that the figures on the river-bank are not in the commune of Asnières, but are rather in Courbevoie, the commune bordering Asnières to the west. The bathers themselves are in the River Seine. The slope forming most of the left hand side of the painting was known as the Côte des Ajoux, {{near the end of the}} rue des Ajoux, on the north bank of the river. Opposite is the island of la Grande Jatte, the east tip of which is shown as the slope and <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> <b>to</b> the right, and which Seurat has pictorially extended beyond its actual length. The Asnières railway bridge, and the industrial buildings of Clichy are in the background.
