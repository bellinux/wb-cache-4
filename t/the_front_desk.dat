The borough is the police headquarters for the North Downs division, and is itself divided into three areas for the purposes of neighbourhood policing: Crawley East, Crawley West, and Crawley Town Centre.

5|$|Around {{midnight on}} Sunday morning, March 18, 1990, a red Dodge Daytona pulled {{up near the}} side {{entrance}} of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum along Palace Road. Two men with fake police uniforms waited {{for at least an}} hour in the car, possibly trying to avoid being noticed by people leaving a St. Patrick's Day party nearby. Later at around 1a.m., security guard Richard Abath returned to <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>desk</b> after patrolling the museum to switch positions with the other security guard. The two guards were the only people in the building. At this time, Abath opened and quickly shut the Palace Road door, claiming he was trained to do this to ensure the door was locked. He claimed security logs from other nights would show that he had done this many times previously. The FBI has seized the logs, but has not commented on the issue further.|$|E

5|$|On {{the night}} of Sunday 8 May to Monday 9 May 1977, about 100 people were staying in the Hotel Polen, {{including}} {{a large group of}} Swedish tourists. About 6:20am, the hotel staff were preparing for breakfast service, when one of them noticed smoke that seemed to be coming from the freight elevator (which had not been used since the café-restaurant on the ground floor had closed the previous evening). The night porter was alerted. Contrary to instructions, he did not call the fire department immediately; instead, he poured some buckets of water into the shaft, in an attempt to subdue the fire. By the time he decided to call the fire department, the hotel was filling with smoke. The night porter was unable to reach the phone at <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>desk</b> because the fire had already reached it. The porter then ran outside, where he stopped the driver of a laundry truck serving the hotel, and instructed him to drive to the Hotel Krasnapolsky to warn them and to call the fire department.|$|E

Motion detector records show that the only footsteps detected in the Blue Room that night were at 12:27a.m. and again at 12:53a.m. These times match to when Abath said he passed through on patrol. The frame for the painting was found on security chief Lyle W.

500|$|Ralph M. Cole, {{a member}} of the golf team of 1926-1928, later wrote of a humorous {{incident}} involving the septuagenarian Coach Trueblood. Cole recalled: [...] "As golf coach he could add very little about the mechanics of the game. But he added one piece of advice which was very helpful when followed, and which he drilled into us at every practice session. It was: 'Up and out in two, boys.' As any golfer would know, it meant, when hitting a short approach shot, get it close enough to the pin to make the next putt. [...] Now for the humorous part of that admonition. We had played Purdue in Lafayette on a Thursday and were to play Illinois on Friday. The Professor was to call us at 4:30a.m. to catch a 5:30 train for Urbana. Well, he got confused on our room number and awakened a man who called <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>desk</b> and told the night clerk that there must be some nut calling at 4:30a.m. and shouting, 'Up and out in two boys!'

According to the aforementioned written confession released by Peruvian authorities, Van der Sloot stated, [...] "I did not want to do it. The girl intruded into my private life [...] [...] [...] she didn't have any right. I went to her and I hit her. She was scared, we argued and she tried to escape. I grabbed her by the neck and hit her." [...] Van der Sloot reportedly stated that he was stoned on marijuana at the time. A detective linked to the case said that Van der Sloot considered getting rid of the body in a suitcase, but decided against it because he would have been stopped at <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>desk.</b> He then reportedly drank espresso and took amphetamines to counter fatigue before fleeing.|$|E

500|$|The {{hotel has}} a {{tradition}} of keeping a cat that has the run of the hotel. The practice dates to the 1930s, when Frank Case took in a stray male cat that was initially named [...] "Rusty." [...] Hotel lore says actor John Barrymore suggested the cat needed a more [...] "dignified" [...] name, so the cat was renamed [...] "Hamlet." [...] Nowadays, whenever the hotel has a male cat, he's named Hamlet; but if the hotel has a female cat, she's named [...] "Matilda." [...] The current Algonquin cat, a Matilda, is a Ragdoll that was named 2006 cat of the year at the Westchester (New York) Cat Show. [...] Visitors can spot Matilda on her personal chaise longue in the lobby; she can also be found in her favorite places: behind the computer on <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>desk,</b> or lounging on a baggage cart. The doormen feed her and the general manager's executive assistant answers Matilda's e-mail. During 2011, Matilda was temporarily confined to an upper floor or to the limits of a leash tethered to the check-in desk, due to a directive from the city Department of Health. As of late 2011, Matilda has been confined to the non-food areas of the lobby by an electronic pet fence.|$|E

The pool and poolhouse were also added. Inside, the maple bar was completely restored, and moved along with <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>desk</b> to its present location.

2500|$|However, Skinner {{recognized}} {{that a great}} deal of behavior, especially human behavior, cannot be accounted for by gradual shaping or the construction of response sequences.
