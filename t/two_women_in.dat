5|$|In 1981 McGovern {{joined the}} Capitol Hill staff of Joe Moakley, a Democratic U.S. Representative from Massachusetts. He was {{appointed}} by Moakley in 1990 to lead a House task force investigating the 1989 murder of six Jesuit priests and <b>two</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> El Salvador by the Salvadoran Army. He later advocated cutting off U.S. funding for the U.S. Army School of the Americas, where several of the military members had been trained.|$|E
5|$|Nick Offerman as Ron Swanson, {{the cynical}} {{director}} of the parks department and Leslie's boss. Due to his incredibly negative view of government, he regularly works to make his department as inefficient as possible. This leads him to butt heads with Leslie {{on a number of}} occasions, as her philosophy regarding government is the polar opposite. Despite that, both he and Leslie have a large amount of respect for one another. Ron has been married twice; both of his ex-wives are named Tammy. He despises and fears them greatly, as they are the only <b>two</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> the world that can control him.|$|E
5|$|Beatrice Hicks {{was born}} in 1919 in Orange, New Jersey, to William Lux Hicks, a {{chemical}} engineer, and Florence Benedict. Hicks decided {{at an early age}} that she wished to be an engineer. While her parents neither supported nor opposed Hicks' desired career path, some of her teachers and classmates tried to discourage her from becoming an engineer, viewing it as a socially unacceptable role for a woman. She graduated from Orange High School in 1935 and received a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering from Newark College of Engineering (now New Jersey Institute of Technology) in 1939, one of only <b>two</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> her class. During college, Hicks worked in the treasury office of an Abercrombie & Fitch store as a telephone operator, and in the university's library. After receiving her undergraduate degree, Hicks stayed at Newark College of Engineering for three years as a research assistant, where she studied the history of Edward Weston's inventions and took additional classes at night.|$|E

5|$|In May 1929 Baldwin {{called a}} general election. As {{a member of}} Labour's National Executive, Wilkinson helped to draft her party's manifesto, {{although}} her preference {{for a list of}} specific policy proposals was overruled in favour of a lengthy statement of ideals and objectives. In Middlesbrough she was re-elected with an increased majority over her Conservative and Liberal opponents. Overall, Labour emerged from the election as the largest party, with 288 members (nine of whom were women), while the Conservatives and Liberals won 260 and 59 respectively. MacDonald formed his second minority administration, and included <b>two</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> ministerial posts: Margaret Bondfield as Minister of Labour and Susan Lawrence as Parliamentary Secretary (junior minister) at the Ministry of Health. Wilkinson was not given office, but was made Lawrence's Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS), an indication that she was marked down for future promotion.|$|E
5|$|The {{opening scene}} begins with {{panoramic}} camera shots {{of a helicopter}} flying over Los Angeles, at night. Then during Rick Ross's verse the female {{members of the group}} appear posing in the background while Ross raps for the camera. Swizz Beatz and Rico Love make cameos alongside Ross. In a third scene, Diddy can be seen driving through the city at night in a black Bugatti Veyron. For the song's chorus, Dawn Richard and Kalenna Harper take the lead, ordering drinks in a bar and enjoying the night club. A fourth scene for T.I.'s verse sees the camera focus on T.I. serenading <b>two</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> an apartment. Throughout the video the images flicker between the various scenes. In the final part of the video, and during the bridge, all three members of the group appear outside against a backdrop of thick smoke and bright red fireworks. There is a final flash of fireworks before the camera fades completely, to black.|$|E
5|$|In August 1997, Carl Doyle and {{his wife}} Catherine Doyle were stabbed to death in Ballintubber, Co Roscommon by Mark Nash, a 25-year-old {{resident}} of Drumcondra in North Dublin. During his interview with the gardaí, he said that about three months prior to his arrest, as he was walking to Stoneybatter, he broke into a house through the back, and had stabbed <b>two</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> their sleep. In his statement, {{there were at least}} two aspects of the crime scene that were not known to the public at the time. Nash later retracted his confession. Nash's confession caused some consternation amongst the gardaí, as Dean Lyons had been charged at that point and was on remand awaiting trial. Two camps emerged within the gardaí, one which believed that Nash's confession threw doubt on Lyons' guilt, the other which believed that Lyons was the murderer. On 27 August 1997, the Garda Commissioner appointed Assistant Commissioner James McHugh to carry out a review of the available evidence. He released a preliminary report on 10 September 1997, and an interim report on 9 January 1998; while these reports did not come to a conclusion about Lyons' guilt, they did raise a number of doubts about his testimony.|$|E

5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Vives {{waking up and}} seeing <b>two</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> the bed with him. He remembers being seduced by them when he was drunk the night before. Realizing this, he packs his {{belongings}} and leaves the house. He is seen driving a car until it runs out fuel which forces him to travel by foot where he eventually arrives at a town. In another house, a woman (played by Fabián) wakes up recalling the events of her abusive husband (played by Zamora). She enters a church and says a prayer. Later, Vives is seen hanging out with two men at an outdoor bar when he spots the woman whom he immediately becomes smitten with. Afterwards, he {{and the two men}} are fishing on a boat when Vives sees the woman again. He begins having illusions of him and the woman having a happy life together which drives him insane in his room. That night, the woman finds her husband making love to another woman in a car. Upon discovering this, she leaves the house. At the same time, the town is holding a festival where Vives is celebrating with the townsfolk. The video concludes with him and the woman seeing each other once more and they decide to go out together.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{consensus}} on when or where Bundy began killing women. He told different stories to different people, and refused to divulge the specifics of his earliest crimes, even as he confessed in graphic detail to dozens of later murders in the days preceding his execution. He told Nelson that he attempted his first kidnapping in 1969 in Ocean City, New Jersey, but did not kill anyone until sometime in 1971 in Seattle. He told psychologist Art Norman that he killed <b>two</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> Atlantic City in 1969 while visiting family in Philadelphia. To homicide detective Robert D. Keppel, he hinted at a murder in Seattle in 1972, and another in 1973 involving a hitchhiker near Tumwater, Washington, but refused to elaborate. Rule and Keppel both believe {{that he may have}} started killing as a teenager. Circumstantial evidence suggests that he abducted and killed 8-year-old Ann Marie Burr of Tacoma in 1961 when he was 14, an allegation he denied repeatedly. His earliest documented homicides were committed in 1974 when he was 27 years old. By then he had (by his own admission) mastered the necessary skills—in the era before DNA profiling—to leave minimal incriminating evidence at a crime scene.|$|E
