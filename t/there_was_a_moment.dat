5|$|When Deep Purple's first line-up came {{together}} in 1967, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> of transition for the British music scene. Beat was still popular, especially in dance halls and outside the capital, but the tastes of young people buying records and filling up the clubs was rapidly changing in favour of blues rock, progressive rock and psychedelic rock. New bands like The Moody Blues, Procol Harum, and The Nice were pioneers in combining classical music with rock, using complex and daring arrangements. At the same time, psychedelia was making strides in the hedonistic swinging London society, where bands like Pink Floyd, The Pretty Things, The Jimi Hendrix Experience, Traffic and Cream experimented with different forms of drug-induced rock music, {{in line with the}} hippie subculture coming from the USA. Many well-known acts, including The Beatles, The Rolling Stones and The Who, were influenced by the changing feel and added many elements of progressive and psychedelic rock to their albums of that period.|$|E

25|$|The first Test was delayed, at the {{instigation}} of the SCG {{to allow}} time for Ranjitsinhji {{to recover from}} tonsillitis and because Andrew Stoddart's mother had died. In the event, Stoddart did not play, but Ranjitsinhji did, although he did drop down to seventh in the batting order. England were captained by Archie MacLaren for the first time. The Test was dominated by an innings of 175 by Ranjitsinhji. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> of controversy when Australian batsman Charlie McLeod was run out by Bill Storer when he left his crease after being bowled by a no-ball, when his deafness prevented him from hearing the umpire's call. England won comfortably by 9 wickets.|$|E

Prior to its release, Mandarin Films publicly launched the film's official website in Beijing on 6 April 2010. The film held a premiere press conference in Beijing on 21 April 2010, only seven days after the 2010 Yushu earthquake. Guests were asked to wear dark-colored clothing in show of mourning; <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> of silence {{for the victims of}} the disaster.

25|$|Benaud, who {{had gone}} in as nightwatchman, {{did not last long}} the next morning, but Simpson and O'Neill took the score to 154 before the former was third out for 91. So with seven wickets left, Australia only needed another 104. But wickets now fell steadily, {{including}} O'Neill for 48, Harvey and Davidson, all three dismissed by Worrell. When Burge was seventh out to Valentine for 53, Australia still needed another 8 runs to win. With four runs required, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> of controversy. Grout late cut Valentine for two runs, but the off bail had fallen to the ground. The umpires consulted, but ruled that the batsman was not out. Thus Australia were 256-7 instead of 254-8. Valentine had Grout's wicket without further addition to the score: 256-8. Still without addition, an easy chance given by Martin was missed, the batsmen taking a single to bring the scores level. Australia then edged home by two wickets, the winning run being a bye. Australia had scored at only 29 runs per 100 balls. At the death, Mackay scored his 3 not out off 51 balls. Worrell bowled 31 8-ball overs in conceding only 43 runs for his 3 wickets, and Gibbs bowled 41 overs in taking 2/68. Valentine took 3/60 in 21.7 overs.|$|E

500|$|Mikan's {{death was}} widely mourned by the {{basketball}} world, and also brought media {{attention to the}} financial struggles of several early-era NBA players. Many [...] felt that the current players of the big-money generation should rally for larger pensions for the pre-1965 predecessors in upcoming labor negotiations. Shaquille O'Neal paid for Mikan's funeral. He said: [...] "Without number 99 , there is no me." [...] Before Game 5 of the 2005 Eastern Conference Finals between the Heat and the Detroit Pistons, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> of silence to honor Mikan. Bob Cousy remarked that Mikan figuratively carried the NBA {{in the early days}} and single-handedly made the league credible and popular.

500|$|The Trojans did {{not escape}} injuries, as linebacker Clay Matthews, substituting for the {{recovering}} Brian Cushing, broke his thumb, causing Cushing {{to enter the}} game as his replacement. [...] The Trojans also suffered twoinjuries on kick returns: fullback Alfred Rowe suffered a mild concussion, and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> of worry when returner Vincent Joseph, after being tackled and fumbling the ball, lay on the turf for over 10minutes before being removed by stretcher with a bruised larynx and a neck sprain, but no serious injuries. Linebacker Rey Maualuga was flagged during a field goal attempt for the rarely called penalty of [...] "disconcerting", which is given for [...] "words or signals that disconcert opponents when they are preparing to put the ball in play".|$|E
500|$|I {{would say}} it was a directorial {{collaborative}} effort. We went to the rainforest and that was interesting.

I was involved every step of the way... I like a lot of the shots in the video... <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> where I had to do an additional water sequence with no director, just myself and a camera man with an underwater camera.

500|$|When Mendelsohn {{was giving}} a talk, she accidentally {{mentioned}} the crossover, as a result Variety was already inquiring about the crossover episodes [...] that same day. Mendelsohn eventually revealed the crossover at the Banff event in Canada. After the episode was taped, Lorre stated: [...] "The biggest challenge for us was doing a comedy with a murder in it. Generally our stories are a little lighter. Would our audience go with a dead body in it? <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> where it could have gone either way. I think the results were spectacular. It {{turned out to be}} a really funny episode." [...] "Fish in a Drawer" [...] was written by Carol Mendelsohn and Naren Shankar and directed by Jeff Melman. As an inside joke, George Eads, who plays crime scene investigator Nick Stokes on CSI made a cameo as a guest at the wedding reception. Three days after the initial airing of [...] "Fish in a Drawer", [...] "Two And a Half Deaths", the corresponding CSI episode, aired on CBS. However, in an early Zap2it interview, both Mendelsohn and Lorre stated that this might be the last time a crossover like this might occur.|$|E

500|$|In {{one scene}} of [...] "A Trip to the Dentist", Weevil (Francis Capra) accuses Logan (Jason Dohring) of having hit Lilly during their relationship. The series' writers were {{planning}} to develop that plot strand into a storyline, with it eventually being revealed that Duncan had hit Lilly in an epileptic fit. However, the storyline was abandoned {{in order to make}} time for other story arcs. Thomas commented, [...] "At the end of the day, I don't want people thinking that Logan hit Lilly. I did, however, want Weevil to believe it." [...] Although Veronica concludes in this episode that she had consensual sex with Duncan while they were both under the influence of roofies, more information about the night is later revealed in the show's second season finale, [...] "Not Pictured", in which it is revealed that Cassidy [...] "Beaver" [...] Casablancas raped her. When asked whether the writers knew that Beaver would be eventually revealed as the rapist when writing [...] "A Trip to the Dentist", Thomas responded, [...] "I wish I could claim that we were that clever." [...] The writers realized that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> in the episode's script where Beaver could have raped Veronica roughly a month after its airing.|$|E
500|$|Peter Horton, {{expressed}} that his plan of developing Chandra Wilson's character, Miranda Bailey, was {{to focus on}} the similarities between her and the actress, noting that [...] "there's not a mean bone in her body, but she's solid and steady, like a rock." [...] Wilson herself noted a significant evolution in her character's personality, noting a transition from the cold attitude that was characteristic to her in the past, to a maternal outlook on her interns. She also noted a number of similarities between her and her character, describing how considers Miranda Bailey an alter ego of hers, rather than someone living inside her. Wilson also assessed that being a real-life human is what makes Bailey an appreciated character: [...] "She gets to be flawed, she gets to be tired, she can be cranky, she can be grumpy." [...] Showrunner Shonda Rhimes explained that the idea of Miranda Bailey having a child was developed after Chandra Wilson had already been pregnant for six months. Cast member Kate Walsh deemed Wilson's portrayal of her character [...] "sweet and wonderful", naming her a professional: [...] "She makes you be a better actor, just by being there." [...] She also described her performance during her character's labor as [...] "heart-breaking, tender, powerful and wonderful", noting how she managed to transform the strong character into [...] "a weak woman, struggling to fight the unusual situation". Fellow cast member James Pickens, Jr. described Wilson's portrayal of Miranda Bailey as [...] "a breath of fresh air, literally and figuratively", also noting how the force she delivers is mainly due to the start of her career being in theater. Horton also described the production process of the two-part story arc, which he stated to have been planning {{since the beginning of the}} series. He stated that the plot of the episodes had to [...] "fill the demands of the Super Bowl", which was scheduled to air in the same night: [...] "We really wanted something different and Shonda [...] came up with the idea of this bomb, that we found simply outstanding!" [...] Visual effects supervisor Scott Milnex noted how [...] "breaking down the story boards was really the key to getting all the departments to work together". He also assessed that the necessity to use Primacord, an element they had been trying to avoid, for the explosion scene proved excessively dangerous, and was ultimately replaced with wood and clothing material. He described the filming process by emphasizing the transition from mannequin to the real actor: [...] "When we filmed it, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> a fraction of a second, when we changed the body with the actor." ...|$|E

[...] The Chiefs had a game scheduled at Arrowhead against the also-struggling Carolina Panthers the day after the murder-suicide. The game went on as scheduled, following discussions between the NFL, Crennel, and the Chiefs' team captains.
