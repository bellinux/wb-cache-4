The superior of {{a religious}} brotherhood, Muhyi ad Din, who had spent time in Ottoman jails for opposing the bey's rule, launched attacks against the French and their makhzen allies at Oran in 1832. In the same year, jihad was declared and to lead it tribal elders chose Muhyi ad Din's son, twenty-five-year-old Abd al Qadir. Abd al Qadir, who was recognized as Amir al-Muminin (commander of the faithful), quickly gained the support of tribes throughout Algeria. A devout and austere marabout, he was also a cunning political leader and a resourceful warrior. From his capital in Tlemcen, Abd al Qadir set about building a territorial Muslim state based on the communities of the interior but drawing its strength from the tribes and religious brotherhoods. By 1839, he controlled more than two-thirds of Algeria. His government maintained an army and a bureaucracy, collected <b>taxes,</b> <b>supported</b> education, <b>undertook</b> public works, and established agricultural and manufacturing cooperatives to stimulate economic activity.|$|R

40|$|This Article first {{explains}} how the prevailing discourse frames federal <b>tax</b> <b>support</b> {{for the middle}} class as either consumption or redistribution, both of which appear to be essentially unproductive and potentially destructive.

In contrast to <b>tax</b> <b>support</b> favoring the middle class, this upper-class support is accepted widely as necessary for productive economic development. Operating below the radar of prominent tax debates, this state and local tax policy reveals more starkly and perversely how prevailing views of tax rationalize inequality and austerity. This Article concludes by defending the core regulatory and productive function of the democratic tax system, grounded in the legitimate collective power of middle- and lower-income households to make the economy more responsible to their interests...|$|R

The third was the greater diffusion of voting power among the citizenry in much of the North, especially in rural communities.
