He used fMRI to explore whether the brain responses differ between sentences that subjects judged as <b>true,</b> <b>false,</b> or undecidable, {{across a wide}} range of categories including autobiographical, mathematical, geographical, religious, ethical, semantic, and factual statements.|$|E
25|$|If a {{statement}} includes a term {{such that the}} statement is false if the term has no instances, then the statement {{is said to have}} existential import with respect to that term. It is ambiguous whether or not a universal statement of the form All A is B is to be considered as <b>true,</b> <b>false,</b> or even meaningless if there are no As. If it is considered as false in such cases, then the statement All A is B has existential import with respect to A.|$|E

6000|$|The {{reader of}} Benjamin Constant's Adolphe, that sombre little {{study of a}} miserable passion, may {{sometimes}} be reminded of Helvétius. It begins with the dry surprise of youth at the opening world, for we need time, he says, to accustom ourselves to the human race, such as affectation, vanity, cowardice, interest have made it. Then we soon learn only to be surprised at our old surprise; we find ourselves very well off in our new conditions, just as we come to breathe freely in a crowded theatre, though on entering it we were almost stifled. Yet {{the author of this}} parching sketch of the distractions of an egoism that just fell short of being complete, suddenly flashes on us the unexpected but penetrating and radiant moral, La grande question dans la vie, c'est la douleur que l'on cause--the great question in life is the pain that we strike into the lives of others. We are not seldom refreshed, when in the midst of Helvétius's narrowest grooves, by some similar breath from the wider air. Among the host of sayings, <b>true,</b> <b>false,</b> trivial, profound, which are scattered over the pages of Helvétius, is one subtle and far-reaching sentence, which made a strong impression upon Bentham. [...] "In order to love mankind," [...] he writes, [...] "we must expect little from them." [...] This might, on the lips of a cynic, serve for a formula of that kind of misanthropy which is not more unamiable than it is unscientific. But in the mouth of Helvétius it was a plea for considerateness, for indulgence, and, above all, it was meant for an inducement to patience and sustained endeavour in all dealings with masses of men in society. [...] "Every man," [...] he says, [...] "so long as his passions do not obscure his reason, will always be the more indulgent in proportion as he is enlightened." [...] He knows that men are what they must be, that all hatred against them is unjust, that a fool produces follies just as a wild shrub produces sour berries, that to insult him is to reproach the oak for bearing acorns instead of olives.[135] All this is as wise and humane as words can be so, and it really represents the aim and temper of Helvétius's teaching. Unfortunately for him and for his generation, his grasp was feeble and unsteady. He had not the gift of accurate thinking, and his book is in consequence that which, of all the books of the eighteenth century, unites most of wholesome truth with most of repellent error.|$|E

5000|$|Ethical cognitivists {{hold that}} ethical {{sentences}} do express propositions: {{that it can}} be <b>true</b> or <b>false,</b> for example, that Mary is a good person, or that stealing and lying are always wrong. Cognitivists believe that these sentences do not just express feelings, as though we were saying, [...] "Hey!" [...] or [...] "Yay for Mary!"; they actually express propositions that can be <b>true</b> or <b>false.</b> Derivatively, a cognitivist or a realist would say that ethical sentences themselves are either <b>true</b> or <b>false.</b> Conversely, if one believes that sentences like [...] "Mary is a good person" [...] cannot be either <b>true</b> or <b>false,</b> then one is a non-cognitivist.|$|R

But these have never been implemented, presumably because of attending complexity.
