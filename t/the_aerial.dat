5|$|Reitman needed fifty days to film Up in the Air, {{eight of}} which were devoted to aerial shooting. <b>The</b> <b>aerial</b> shots {{turned out to be}} more {{difficult}} than expected. He was unable to use three days of <b>the</b> <b>aerial</b> filming. Many aerial shots, such as the crop circle on fire, are seen in the Paramount trailer, but are not used in the film.

5|$|Leaves : Simple, entire (smooth and even), linear, oval to {{filiform}} (thread-like), {{mostly with}} parallel veins, but occasionally net-veined. They are alternate (single and alternating direction) and spiral, {{but may be}} whorled (three or more attached at one node, e.g. Lilium, Fritillaria), cauline (arranged along <b>the</b> <b>aerial</b> stem) or sheathed in a basal rosette. They are rarely petiolate (stem attached before apex), and lack stipules. <b>The</b> <b>aerial</b> stem is unbranched.|$|E

5|$|On 8 September 1967, the {{electronic}} portion of Dyemarker was divided and <b>the</b> <b>aerial,</b> sensor-based portion was designated Muscle Shoals. On 1 June 1968, <b>the</b> <b>aerial</b> portion was redesignated Igloo White. That name {{became the most}} associated with the program though various elements received a number of separate codenames. All resources for Dyemarker/Muscle Shoals were redesignated Duck Blind in April 1968, and in June 1968 Muscle Shoals outright became Duel Blade. In October 1968 Duck Blind was changed to Duffel Bag.|$|E

5|$|Between 1950 and 1952, {{trials were}} {{conducted}} in Tanganyika, at Kikore and Stunyansa, to test arboricides and defoliants under tropical conditions. The chemicals involved were 2,4-D, 2,4,5-T, and endothall (3,6-endoxohexahydrophthalic acid). During 1952–53, the unit supervised <b>the</b> <b>aerial</b> spraying of 2,4,5-T over the Waturi peninsula in Kenya to assess the value of defoliants in the eradication of tsetse fly.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, {{researchers}} of Oman's Sultan Qaboos University published {{their findings}} from a chemical {{investigation into the}} leaves in which they found it contained semiglabrin, semigalbrinol, and a new flavanone named apollineanin. One 2014 study revealed that pseudosemiglabrin extracted from <b>the</b> <b>aerial</b> parts of Tephrosia apollinea had an antiproliferative effect on cancer cell lines.|$|E

5|$|Many of the {{original}} 1970s-era stations, especially <b>the</b> <b>aerial</b> stations, feature simple Brutalist architecture, but newer stations are a mix of Neomodern and Postmodern architecture.

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} Oak Leaves presentation, the Gruppe {{transferred}} from the Eastern Front to Sicily in Italy. Geißhardt destroyed nine enemy aircraft in <b>the</b> <b>aerial</b> battles of Malta {{by the end of}} October 1942 (83–91). He added nine more victories in the North African Campaign, among them his century on 10 November 1942. He was the 30th Luftwaffe pilot to achieve the century mark.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>aerial</b> {{game was}} also {{developed}} within the Sheffield game. While causing much amusement when the side visited London in 1866, the header {{would become an}} important feature of the national game. This {{was linked to the}} abolition of the fair catch in the same year that prevented all use of the hands by outfield players.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>aerial</b> robots vary {{in design}} from fixed wing airplanes, to {{conventional}} helicopters, to ducted fans, to airships, and beyond to bizarre hybrid creations. Because the competition focuses on fully autonomous behavior, the air vehicle itself is of less importance.|$|E
5|$|The {{operation}} {{became the}} most intense air/ground battle waged during the Cold War period; {{it was the most}} difficult such campaign fought by the United States since <b>the</b> <b>aerial</b> bombardment of Germany during World War II. Supported by communist allies, North Vietnam fielded a potent mixture of sophisticated air-to-air and surface-to-air weapons that created {{one of the most effective}} air defenses ever faced by American military aviators.|$|E
5|$|Third, <b>the</b> <b>aerial</b> {{resupply}} {{lines at}} Nà Sản were never severed, despite Viet Minh antiaircraft fire.

5|$|Aerial robots must be {{unmanned}} and autonomous, {{and must}} compete {{based on their}} ability to sense the semi-structured environment of the competition arena. They may be intelligent or preprogrammed, but they must not be controlled by a remote human operator. Computational power need not be carried on the air vehicle itself. Computers operating from standard commercial power may be set up outside the competition arena boundary and uni- or bi-directional data may be transmitted to/from the vehicles in the arena. Size or weight constraints are normally placed on <b>the</b> <b>aerial</b> robots, which must be equipped with a method of manually activated remote override of the primary propulsion system.|$|E
5|$|After the {{initiation}} of the strategic aerial bombardment of North Vietnam (Operation Rolling Thunder) in March 1965, Washington saw that program as its chief method of relaying signals to Hanoi to cease its support of the southern insurgency. When that failed as a strategy, <b>the</b> <b>aerial</b> effort was redirected {{to serve as an}} anti-infiltration campaign. After a million sorties were flown and more than three-quarters of a million tons of bombs were dropped, Rolling Thunder came to an end at the direction of President Lyndon B. Johnson on 11 November 1968.|$|E
5|$|As the 181st Brigade {{approached}} Tulkarm {{from the}} south-west, {{a number of}} aircraft bombed the town.

At 17:00 the 181st Brigade's 2/22nd Battalion, London Regiment with the 2/152nd Infantry on the right captured Tulkarm railway station and the town, while the 2/127th Baluch Light Infantry were held up at Qulunsawe.
