Twenty-one IPCs who work in nine countries were interviewed. Thematic analysis of these interviews resulted two analyses. The first examines the care roles taken on by caregiver-companions.

40|$|Abstract. Text {{detection}} {{in urban}} scenes {{is a hard}} task due to the high variability of text appearance: different text fonts, changes in the point of view, or partial occlusion {{are just a few}} problems. Text detection can be specially suited for georeferencing business, navigation, <b>tourist</b> <b>assistance,</b> or to help visual impaired people. In this paper, we propose a general methodology {{to deal with the problem}} of text detection in outdoor scenes. The method is based on learning spatial information of gradient based features and Census Transform images using a cascade of classifiers. The method is applied in the context of Mobile Mapping systems, where a mobile vehicle captures urban image sequences. Moreover, a cover data set is presented and tested with the new methodology. The results show high accuracy when detecting multi-linear text regions with high variability of appearance, at same time that it preserves a low false alarm rate compared to classical approaches. 1...|$|E
40|$|With {{the recent}} {{advances}} in mobile technologies and infrastructures, there are increasing demands for ubiquitous access to tourist information systems for service coordination and integration. However, disparate tourist information and service resources make it particularly difficult for mobile tourists to use them effectively during their trips. Neither can current tourist portals assist tourists proactively or adequately to overcome this problem. Motivated by the emerging technologies of multi-agent information systems (MAIS) that can effectively assist mobile users together with Semantic Web that can effectively organize information and service resources, we propose a ubiquitous <b>tourist</b> <b>assistance</b> system (UTAS) be built upon these technologies. In this paper, we formulate a scalable, flexible, and intelligent MAIS infrastructure for a proactive UTAS with agent clusters based on {{a case study of}} a large service-oriented travel agency. Each agent cluster comprises several types of agents to achieve the goals of the major processes of a tourist’s trip. We show how agents can make use of ontology from the Semantic Web to plan better as well as help tourists better understand and specify their requirements and preferences.

In this paper, {{the point of view of}} one such site, that of Passo di Corvo, shall be taken to illustrate project aims. The objective is to develop at the three sites a system which is able to adapt the suggestion of a visit path to the wishes and needs of various dynamic user profiles. Explanations on what is visible is dependent on the location of the user, which the system is able to detect in real time, as well as on user profile and history of the visit. The user may also connect to other information sources for a better understanding of the archaeological evidence, for example to a local museum where the findings have been stored, or to other sites in the PAST network to find answers about related subjects (e. g. how did they cook? how did they bury the deads?). The project shall exploit available technologies like voice interaction and digital imaging in order to provide <b>tourist</b> <b>assistance</b> in various languages and at varying level of details.

However, research has yet to understand how such CSR activities impact the beneficiary, namely tourist attractions. Thus, extending past CSR literature, we explore whether differing company CSR motivations can influence a tourists’ visiting intentions. The results of two experimental studies show low company altruism (e. g. demanding to acquire naming rights of the site), compared to high company altruism (e. g. demanding nothing in return), decreases visiting intentions. Furthermore, we show perceived authenticity of the site mediates this effect. Finally, we find the negative effect of low altruistic CSR is mitigated in the case of no heritage. Based on the results, we show tourist attraction managers should be wary of companies displaying non-altruistic intentions, as such activity may have harmful consequences...|$|R

Especially in see-through HMD applications it would be helpful if the user has a possibility to interact with the display content in an augmented reality setting while preserving hands-free operation. Such user interaction can be handled by an eye-tracker based on an integrated near-infrared (NIR) camera. Therefore integration of NIR camera photodetectors and AMOLED microdisplay into a single device will lead to a highly integrated, very light-weight, small-sized bi-directional microdisplay ("OLEDCAM"), which {{can be used}} as visual Input-/Output-Device (I/O) For personal information management (PIM) (see Fig. 1).
