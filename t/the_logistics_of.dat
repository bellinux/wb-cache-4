40|$|As {{the third}} profit source, {{logistics}} plays {{an extremely important}} role to reduce costs, improve efficiency and enhance the enterprise market competitiveness. This study describes <b>the</b> <b>logistics</b> capability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> supply chain in food production enterprise. <b>The</b> <b>logistics</b> capability is summarized {{as the ability to}} control <b>the</b> <b>logistics</b> cost, <b>the</b> ability <b>of</b> <b>logistics</b> service, <b>the</b> ability <b>of</b> <b>logistics</b> elements and <b>the</b> ability <b>of</b> <b>logistics</b> organization and management. Through <b>the</b> analysis <b>of</b> <b>logistics</b> capability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> supply chain in food production enterprise, this study establishes an evaluation system <b>of</b> <b>logistics</b> capability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> supply chain from the above four aspects. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is used to determine weights of the subspace dimension indicators and the membership function in fuzzy theory is used to determine the indicators of the level of the matrix. Combined with the theory of entropy, integrated weight <b>of</b> <b>logistics</b> capability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> supply chain of the matrix can be determined and quantified indicators will be achieved as an evaluation criterion. Finally, the indicator system and evaluation method are integrated to analyze <b>the</b> <b>logistics</b> capabilities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> supply chain in food production enterprise via a case study, which proves to be valid...|$|R

5|$|At {{the time}} of the invasion, many units of the 4th Army were still at their {{mobilisation}} centres or in their concentration areas, and {{only a small number of}} units had actually deployed into their planned positions to defend the border. A significant number of conscripts did not report to their mobilisation centres. <b>The</b> <b>logistics</b> <b>of</b> the 4th Army were in a poor state, mainly due to a lack of livestock and vehicles for transport, but also due to fifth column sabotage by the Ustaše and their sympathisers, to the extent that many units did not even have 10 per cent of their transport needs. It was also equipped poorly, lacking in many tools of modern warfare, including tanks, light artillery, anti-aircraft weapons and air support. These deficiencies affected both its fighting power and morale.|$|E

Personally {{overseeing}} <b>the</b> <b>logistics</b> <b>of</b> the tanks in their first combat use by U.S. forces, and reconnoitering the target area for their first attack himself, Patton ordered that no U.S. tank be surrendered. Patton commanded American-crewed Renault FT tanks at the Battle of Saint-Mihiel, leading the tanks from the front for much of their attack, which began on September 12. He walked in front of the tanks into the German-held village of Essey, and rode on top of a tank during the attack into Pannes, seeking to inspire his men.|$|E

30|$|The rest of {{the paper}} is {{structured}} as follows. Section 2 presents a literature review on <b>the</b> location <b>of</b> <b>logistics</b> facilities. Section 3 describes the methodology used for building an original database which gives us <b>the</b> location <b>of</b> <b>logistics</b> facilities and <b>the</b> services they provide in the Paris Region. In Section 4, we use our database to analyze the dispersion of facilities and their insertion into the urban fabric {{with a series of}} indicators, to draw <b>the</b> general <b>logistics</b> geography <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Paris Region. Section 5 puts this spatial analysis in perspective, describing <b>the</b> location <b>of</b> <b>logistics</b> facilities belonging to three specific market segments <b>of</b> <b>the</b> transport and <b>logistics</b> industry. We show the different location patterns <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>logistics</b> facilities <b>of</b> three market segments depending on the services they provide. In Section 6, we propose a statistical analysis based on the location indicators of <b>the</b> different kinds <b>of</b> <b>logistics</b> facilities to show the non-homogeneous location patterns <b>of</b> <b>logistics</b> facilities, with facilities offering different services sharing the same location patterns. Section 7, in conclusion, provides a summary of our main results.|$|R
5|$|In March 1916 Mexican forces {{loyal to}} Pancho Villa crossed into New Mexico and raided the border town of Columbus. The {{violence}} in Columbus killed several Americans. In response, the U.S. launched the Pancho Villa Expedition into Mexico. Chagrined {{to discover that}} his unit would not participate, Patton appealed to expedition commander John J. Pershing, and was named his personal aide for the expedition. This meant that Patton would have some role in organizing the effort, and his eagerness and dedication to the task impressed Pershing. Patton modeled much of his leadership style after Pershing, who favored strong, decisive actions and commanding from the front. As an aide, Patton oversaw <b>the</b> <b>logistics</b> <b>of</b> Pershing's transportation and acted as his personal courier.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Zvi Aharoni, {{one of the}} Mossad {{agents who}} had been {{involved}} in the Eichmann capture, was placed in charge of a team of agents tasked with locating Mengele and bringing him to trial in Israel. Inquiries in Paraguay gave no clues as to his whereabouts, and they were unable to intercept any correspondence between Mengele and his wife Martha, then living in Italy. Agents following Rudel's movements did not produce any leads. Aharoni and his team followed Gerhard to a rural area near São Paulo, where they located a European man believed to be Mengele. Aharoni reported his findings to Harel, but <b>the</b> <b>logistics</b> <b>of</b> staging a capture, budgetary constraints, and the need to focus on the nation's deteriorating relationship with Egypt led the Mossad chief to call a halt to the operation in 1962.|$|E

Most of the Starfleet uniforms had already been designed for the previous film, but Fletcher wanted to dress the main characters in civilian clothes. Fletcher developed a mythology behind each outfit; the stone ornaments on Sarek's robe, for instance, were intended to be representative of a Vulcan's level of consciousness.

5|$|By {{the time}} of the elder Joseph Terry's death in 1850, Terry's was {{becoming}} a household name due to its previous trade successes across the country. The younger Joseph, along with his two brothers, Robert and John, are credited with moving confectionery production to an industrial scale with the leasing of a factory at Clementhorpe, beside the River Ouse, in 1862. Its location was particularly advantageous, as the 22-year-old Terry had drawn inspiration from the manipulation of the railways initiated by his father, and saw the benefit of importing and exporting from the river using steamboats. Vessels from the River Humber supplied coal for the factory, while larger ships would import ingredients such as sugar and cocoa from around the world twice a week. The Clementhorpe factory also improved <b>the</b> <b>logistics</b> <b>of</b> the company, providing ample room for the construction of warehouses to store stock. Two years later, there were 400 separate items in the firm's price list, with around 13 of them consisting of chocolate as a main ingredient; others included various candied peels, cakes, biscuits and jams among other more exotic products such as cream balls.|$|E
5|$|For {{at least}} six months, the Mexican Armed Forces were trying to hunt down Antonio Ezequiel, nearly {{capturing}} him in two occasions. The drug lord managed to avoid capture in several occasions by relying on the armed squadron known as Los Escorpiones (The Scorpions), which served as his private army. Among the first operations to capture the drug lord occurred on 31 March 2010, when the Mexican military confronted Antonio Ezequiel's bodyguards at Tres Culturas neighborhood in Matamoros. On 7 April 2010, there were two shootouts in Matamoros between Mexican marines {{and members of the}} Gulf Cartel. The intelligence information collected in these shootouts allowed the Mexican Armed Forces to locate the domicile of Antonio Ezequiel on 14 September 2010 at Fraccionamiento Río in Matamoros. But heavily armed gunmen of the Gulf Cartel intercepted the raid and protected their leader, who escaped in an armored vehicle. Two military men were killed in the operation, but the government managed to gain more information on <b>the</b> <b>logistics</b> <b>of</b> the inner circle of Antonio Ezequiel. On 1 November 2010, the Mexican authorities learned once again that Antonio Ezequiel was spending the night in a safe house at the Expo Fiesta Oriente neighborhood in Matamoros.
