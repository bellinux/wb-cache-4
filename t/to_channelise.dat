The experimental approach follows the ‘similarity of processes’ concept and is therefore not scaled to a real world prototype. The experiments were conducted in the University of Exeter Sediment Research Facility using a 3 × 3 m fixed bed experimental table with controlled sediment and water supply fed to the fan apex, and evacuation of all sediment that passes the distal boundary. The evolution of the fan was recorded using high resolution time-lapse overhead photography to permit analysis of fan topography, flow patterns, channel migration and avulsion on the fan surface {{over the course of the}} experimental run. The qualitative observations from three experimental scenarios are discussed and evaluated in the context of current understanding of alluvial fan evolution. These demonstrate that in the absence of any change in the extrinsic variables there is an autogenic transition from sheetflow <b>to</b> <b>channelised</b> flow as the experimental fans evolve.

There is no systematic correlation between heat flow in the accretionary wedge and distance from the trench. A comparison with heat flow predicted by a simple analytical model suggests that there is little shear heating from within or beneath the wedge, despite the high basal friction suggested by the large taper angle of the wedge.

The interpretation of landforms reveals the glacial influence on recent sedimentary processes shaping the seafloor, including mass-wasting and turbidite flows. The timing of landform development points to a predominantly glacial origin of the sediment supplied to the continental margin, supporting the scenario of a Greenland Ice Sheet extending across the continental shelf, or even to the shelf-edge, during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Major sedimentary processes along the central section of the eastern Greenland Continental Slope, the Norske margin, suggest a relatively high glacial sediment input during the LGM that, probably triggered by tectonic activity, {{led to the development}} of scarps and channels on the slope and debris flows on the continental rise.

40|$|Hydrology is {{recognised}} as {{an important}} component of the glacial system in alpine environments. In particular, the subglacial drainage of surface meltwaters is known to exert a strong influence on the motion of glaciers and on their capacity to erode the underlying bedrock. This thesis examines the more poorly understood drainage system of the Greenland Ice Sheet, with specific focus on Leverett Glacier, a landterminating outlet glacier on the ice sheet’s western margin. Because of the vast size of the ice sheet, the influence of the drainage system could have wide ranging implications, most notably for sea level rise and continental scale landscape evolution. The thesis commences with an investigation into the morphology of the drainage system of the lower 14 km of Leverett Glacier. This is undertaken using a variety of field methods, including dye tracing and the monitoring of proglacial discharge, englacial water levels, surface melt rates and glacier motion. The data reveal that the drainage system of the glacier closely resembles that of alpine glaciers, undergoing an evolution from distributed <b>to</b> <b>channelised</b> drainage morphologies as the melt season progresses. Another aspect of the field data, the suspended sediment load evacuated from the subglacial system in the emerging proglacial river, is then examined to investigate the impact that this drainage system morphology has on the interaction between the glacier and the underlying bedrock or substrate. This demonstrates that the presence of large, efficient subglacial drainage channels allows for the removal of vast quantities of basal debris during much of the melt season, facilitating an erosion rate 1 - 2 orders of magnitude greater than previously proposed for ice sheet settings. The thesis then focuses on the relationship between discharge, water pressure and ice motion. Observations from Greenlandic and alpine glaciers demonstrate that glaciers generally decelerate through the melt season following a maximum velocity induced by the onset of melt in the spring. The data indicate that the evolution of the drainage system from a distributed <b>to</b> a <b>channelised</b> morphology occurs rapidly and so can only explain this trend in ice velocity during the early part of the melt season. Beyond this period, ice velocity patterns can instead be explained primarily by transient fluctuations in water pressure within the channelised drainage system. These transient pressure fluctuations result from the lag between changes to the rate of meltwater input to the glacier and the subsequent adjustment of channel cross section. This indicates that it is crucial to consider temporal variability in melt rate when seeking to link climate with the dynamics of ice sheets and glaciers. This process can be simulated, which is demonstrated by using the proglacial discharge record to model subglacial water pressure and ice velocity. In the following chapter, this model is built upon by considering how these variations in water pressure, originating in discrete subglacial channels, control sliding velocities across large areas of the glacier. Detailed examination of high-resolution ice velocity records from Leverett Glacier reveals that, in keeping with theory, horizontal ice velocity is dependent on both the volume of subglacial cavities and the rate-of-change of this volume. A simple model of subglacial water movement is then used to demonstrate how these changes in the cavity system could be driven by the pressure fluctuations predicted within the channelised drainage system. This enables a system scale model of glacier hydrology to be developed, which is presented in the final chapter, linking variations in surface melt rate to channel pressure, cavity volume and ultimately ice motion. In summary, this research has helped to illuminate the morphology and functioning of the drainage system of Leverett Glacier. This has improved our understanding of how hydrology influences both the motion of the Greenland Ice Sheet and its impact on the underlying topography, and enabled better prediction of how these processes are influenced by changes in climate...|$|R

The present study is an attempt to study the priority sector advances by the public, private and foreign bank groups. This study is based on the parameters like lending to priority sector by public, private sector and foreign bank groups, targets achieved by public, private sector and foreign bank group NPAs (Non-performing assets), while lending to priority sector. On the basis of these parameters, the study concludes that public sector banks have not achieved the target of 40 % while private sector banks have achieved the overall target.

40|$|The {{state of}} river {{channels}} and their riparian zones {{in terms of}} geomorphology and vegetation has {{a significant effect on}} water and sediment transport in headwater catchments. High roughness in natural rivers due to vegetation and geomorphological attributes generate drag on flowing water. This drag will slow water discharge, which in turn influences the sediment dynamics of the flow. The impacts of changes in the management of rivers and their riparian zone (either by catchment managers or river restoration plans) impacts both up- as well as downstream reaches, and should be assessed holistically prior to the implementation of these plans. To assess the river's current state as well as any possible changes in geomorphology and vegetation in and around the river, effective approaches to characterise the river are needed. In this paper, we present a practical approach for making detailed surveys of relevant river attributes. This methodology has the benefit of being both detailed – describing river depth, width, channel morphology, erosive features and vegetation types – but also being practical in terms of time management. This is accomplished by identifying and describing characteristic benchmark reaches (typical sites) in detail against which the remainder of the river course can be rated. Using this method, a large river stretch can be assessed in a relatively short period while still retrieving high quality data for the total river course. In this way, models with high data requirements for assessing the condition of a river course, can be parameterised without major investments on field surveys. In a small headwater catchment (23 km 2) in southwestern Poland, this field methodology was used to retrieve data to run an existing model (HEC-GeoRAS) which can assess the impact of changes in the riparian and channel vegetation and channel management on sedimentation processes and stream flow velocity. This model determines the impact of channel morphology and in-channel and riparian vegetation on stream flow and sediment transport. Using four return periods of flooding (2, 10, 20 and 100 years), two opposing channel management / morphology scenarios were run; a natural channel and a fully regulated channel. The modelling results show an increase in the effect of riparian vegetation / geomorphology with an increase in return period of the modeled peak discharge. More natural channel form and increased roughness reduces the stream flow velocity due to increasing drag from flow obstructions (vegetation and channel morphological features). The higher the flood water stage, the greater the drag due to vegetation on the floodplains of natural river reaches compared <b>to</b> <b>channelised</b> sections. Slower flow rates have an impact on sediment mobilisation and transport in the river. ...|$|R
