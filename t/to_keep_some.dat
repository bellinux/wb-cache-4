5|$|In the Senate, Nixon took a {{prominent}} position in opposing global communism, traveling frequently and {{speaking out against}} it. He maintained friendly relations with his fellow anti-communist, the controversial Wisconsin senator, Joseph McCarthy, but was careful <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>some</b> distance between himself and McCarthy's allegations. Nixon also criticized President Harry S. Truman's handling of the Korean War. He supported statehood for Alaska and Hawaii, {{voted in favor of}} civil rights for minorities, and supported federal disaster relief for India and Yugoslavia. He voted against price controls and other monetary restrictions, benefits for illegal immigrants, and public power.|$|E
5|$|In early December 1943, Lukačević's Chetniks {{participated in}} Operation Kugelblitz, {{the first of}} a series of German {{operations}} alongside the 1st Mountain Division, 7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen, and parts of the 187th Reserve Division, the 369th (Croatian) Infantry Division and the 24th Bulgarian Division. The Partisans avoided decisive engagement and the operation concluded on 18 December. Also during December, the Higher SS and Police Leader in the Sandžak, SS-Standartenführer Karl von Krempler, posted notices authorising local Serbs to join Lukačević's Chetniks. On 22 December, shortly after the conclusion of Operation Kugelblitz, Oberst (Colonel) Josef Remold issued an order of the day commending Lukačević for his enthusiasm in fighting the Partisans in the Sandžak, and allowed him <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>some</b> of the arms he had captured.|$|E
5|$|This {{sophisticated}} medieval form {{of government}} was {{handed over to the}} Normans and was the foundation of further developments. They kept the framework of government but made changes in the personnel, although at first the new king attempted <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>some</b> natives in office. By the end of William's reign most of the officials of government and the royal household were Normans. The language of official documents also changed, from Old English to Latin. The forest laws were introduced, leading to the setting aside of large sections of England as royal forest. The Domesday survey was an administrative catalogue of the landholdings of the kingdom, and was unique to medieval Europe. It was divided into sections based on the shires, and listed all the landholdings of each tenant-in-chief of the king as well as who had held the land before the conquest.|$|E

5|$|In a later {{version of}} the film, Auto comes to the docking bay to {{retrieve}} EVE's plant. The film would have its first cutaway to the captain, but Stanton moved that as he found it too early to begin moving away from WALL-E's point-of-view. As an homage to Get Smart, Auto takes the plant and goes into {{the bowels of the}} ship into a room resembling a brain where he watches videos of Buy n Large's scheme to clean up the Earth falling apart through the years. Stanton removed this <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>some</b> mystery as to why the plant is taken from EVE. The captain appears to be unintelligent, but Stanton wanted him to just be unchallenged; otherwise he would have been unempathetic. One example of how unintelligent the captain was depicted initially is that he was seen to wear his hat upside-down, only to fix it before he challenges Auto. In the finished film, he merely wears it casually atop his head, tightening it when he assumes real command of the Axiom.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} October 9, 2002 and wrapped by March 7, 2003. The quick shoot was only marred by two accidents: as Jack Sparrow steals the Interceptor, {{three of the}} ropes attaching it to the Dauntless did not break at first, {{and when they did}} snap, debris hit Depp's knee, though he was not injured, and the way the incident played out on film made it look like Sparrow merely ducks. A more humorous accident was when the boat Sparrow was supposed to arrive in at Port Royal sank. In October, the crew was shooting scenes at Rancho Palos Verdes, by December they were shooting at Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and in January they were at the cavern set at Los Angeles. The script often changed with Elliott and Rossio on set, with additions such as Gibbs (Kevin McNally) telling Will how Sparrow allegedly escaped from an island – strapping two turtles together with rope made of his back hair – and Pryce was written into the climactic battle <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>some</b> empathy for the audience.|$|E
5|$|The Catalans gave Walter a {{remarkable}} success, which brought him accolades and financial rewards from Pope Clement V, but the Duke now declined to fulfil {{his end of}} the deal and provide the remaining four months' pay. Instead, Walter picked the best 200 horsemen and 300 Almogavar infantry from the Company, paid them their arrears and gave them land so that they would remain in his service, while ordering the rest to hand over their conquests and depart his lands. In response, the Catalans offered to recognize him as their lord if they were allowed <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>some</b> of the land they had taken to establish themselves, but Walter rejected their proposal and began preparations to expel them by force. To this purpose, the Duke of Athens assembled a large army, comprising his own feudatories—among them the most prominent were Albert Pallavicini, Margrave of Bodonitsa, Thomas III d'Autremencourt, Lord of Salona and Marshal of Achaea, and the barons of Euboea, Boniface of Verona, George I Ghisi and John of Maisy—as well as reinforcements sent from the other principalities of Frankish Greece.|$|E

25|$|Many {{countries}} {{followed the}} US move. Yet Taiwan's strengthening {{economy in the}} 1970s and 1980s allowed the country <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>some</b> strongholds across the world, which supported ROC's diplomatic claim to the UN.

Although supporters of the planned Benjamin Banneker Historical Park and Museum in Oella, Maryland, had hoped to obtain these and several other items related to Banneker and the Ellicotts, a Virginia investment banker won most of the items {{with a series of}} bids that totaled $49,750.

25|$|Since reviewers are {{normally}} selected from {{experts in the}} fields discussed in the article, the process of peer review helps <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>some</b> invalid or unsubstantiated claims out {{of the body of}} published research and knowledge. Scholars will read published articles outside their limited area of detailed expertise, and then rely, to some degree, on the peer-review process to have provided reliable and credible research that they can build upon for subsequent or related research. Significant scandal ensues when an author is found to have falsified the research included in an article, as other scholars, and the field of study itself, may have relied upon the invalid research.|$|E

His efforts were curbed when he was exiled to Egypt Eyalet, where he {{spent the rest of}} his life, dying at an unknown date. Iorga argues that his burial place must be a parish church of the Byzantine Patriarchate of Alexandria. Gane also writes that Paisie died in Alexandria. Other records suggest that his destination and resting place was the Sinai, making him the first Wallachian or Moldavian Prince to have set foot in the peninsula.|$|E

25|$|Unlike its predecessor, the {{syndicated}} What's My Line? did not emphasize formality as the panelists dressed in normal attire. In addition, the panelists were simply {{referred to by}} name and only their first names were displayed in front of them. The show did manage <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>some</b> elements of the original series intact, as the intro used during the final two seasons on CBS was reused. The panelists also entered {{in the same manner}} as they had before with Soupy Sales (or the panelist occupying the seat furthest left when he was absent) coming out first and introducing the person sitting next to him, and continuing down the line to Arlene Francis (or whoever occupied her seat while she was absent), who would then introduce the host.|$|E
25|$|For a sweet wine, {{fermentation}} {{is stopped}} before its end <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>some</b> of the sugar: {{this is the}} Mutage (fortification). The fermentation can be stopped by adding Sulphur Dioxide (SO2) (sterilisation of wine), by sudden cooling (anaesthesia of yeasts), by sterile filtration (capturing the yeasts in a very fine mesh filter), {{or a combination of}} several of these methods. A rule of thumb for determining the point of mutage, which allows a good balance of acquired alcohol and residual sugar, is to leave as many potential degrees as the degrees acquired over 10% by volume. For sweeter dessert wines fermentation stops spontaneously by excess sugar and alcohol: Alcohol is waste from the yeast and it is poisonous in large doses. In the case of sweet wines an addition of wine alcohol stops the fermentation. FML is not done for sweet wines as the lactic bacteria preferentially degrades sugar which would give a lactic bite (sweet and sour wine). In addition, the balance of acidity and sugar in the wine supports vivacity.|$|E
25|$|With {{the ouster}} of {{conservative}} Antonio López de Santa Anna, Mexican liberals came to power. The Reform War (1858–1861) fought between Liberals, who favored federalism and sought economic development, decreased power of the Roman Catholic Church, and Mexican army, and Conservatives, who favored centralized autocratic government, retention of elite privileges, {{did not lead to}} any military battles in the state. Despite that it strongly affected Chiapas politics. In Chiapas, the Liberal-Conservative division had its own twist. Much of the division between the highland and lowland ruling families was for whom the Indians should work for and for how long as the main shortage was of labor. These families split into Liberals in the lowlands, who wanted further reform and Conservatives in the highlands who still wanted <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>some</b> of the traditional colonial and church privileges. For most of the early and mid 19th century, Conservatives held most of the power and were concentrated in the larger cities of San Cristóbal de las Casas, Chiapa (de Corzo), Tuxtla and Comitán. As Liberals gained the upper hand nationally in the mid-19th century, one Liberal politician Ángel Albino Corzo gained control of the state. Corzo became the primary exponent of Liberal ideas in the southeast of Mexico and defended the Palenque and Pichucalco areas from annexation by Tabasco. However, Corzo's rule would end in 1875, when he opposed the regime of Porfirio Díaz.|$|E

25|$|He {{joined the}} cruiser , and sailed for the West Indies for training. In Mexico and Venezuela, {{he was part}} of a force sent to protect British {{interests}} against revolutionaries. After courses at Halifax, Nova Scotia he joined another cruiser, , which patrolled off the eastern seaboard of the United States where she stopped shipping to search for German nationals of military age, who were removed. Since he spoke German, he was always a member of the boarding party. He was also involved in the escort of troopships to England. He was appointed to , an I-class destroyer. He was constantly at sea, patrolling to the Hook of Holland. He escorted hospital ships to and from France. He employed anti-submarine and minesweeping methods. Asdic, depth charges, and the hydrophones used in the Great War could not be used when a ship was underway, however they were used in action against enemy submarines. He was ordered to the Mediterranean Sea in April 1918. He performed convoy, anti-submarine, and rescue work. He found that social and sports activities ashore were much improved. At Brindisi, Italy, efforts made to seal the Adriatic against movement of enemy submarines were only partially effective, since the sea was too deep to blockade. He served as the Executive Officer of HMS Beaver. He ferried troops to the Dardanelles when Turkey surrendered. He entered the Sea of Marmara and proceeded to Constantinople. In October 1918 he participated in the bombardment of Durazzo, Albania. From Constantinople they sailed to Odessa, Russia where the German army and the White Russians were attempting <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>some</b> sort of civil order. Welcomed by the Rumanians, they sailed up the Danube where they attempted to keep the Rumanians and Bulgarians apart. In December 1918, he called at Sevastopol, Russia where he saw and visited the Russian Black Sea Fleet, which was largely abandoned and in a poor state of repair. He removed a number of political refugees from Odessa, Russia.|$|E
