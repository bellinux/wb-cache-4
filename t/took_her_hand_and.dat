5|$|The Pranotasani Tantra narrates {{that once}} Parvati longed {{to go back}} to her {{maternal}} house for some days and asked Shiva's permission to do so. The reluctant Shiva agreed on the condition that if she did not return in a few days, he would come to fetch her. Parvati agreed and went to her father Himalaya's place, where she stayed for many days. The lovesick Shiva went to Himalaya's abode disguised as an ornament seller and sold shell ornaments to Parvati. In order to test her fidelity, the disguised Shiva asked for sex in return. The disgusted Parvati was about to curse the ornament-seller, when she realizes by her yogic powers that it was none other than Shiva. She agrees to grant sexual favours but at the appropriate time. In the evening, Parvati returns to Shiva's abode disguised as a Chandala huntress. She is dressed in red and had a lean figure and large breasts and performs a seductive dance to lure him. She told Shiva that she had come to do penance. Shiva replied that he is the one gives fruit to all penance and <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> kissed her. Further, they made love when Shiva himself changed into a Chandala and recognized the Chandala woman as his wife. After the love-making, Parvati asked Shiva to grant her wish that her form as a Chandalini (the Chandala female form in which Shiva made love to her) might last forever as Ucchishta-Chandalini and that her worship in this form precede his for his worship to be considered fruitful. This tale is also found in many Bengali Mangalkavyas. In these texts, however, Parvati is not explicitly identified with Matangi.|$|E
500|$|Immediately {{after her}} arrival in Edmonton, she said, Brownlee had telephoned her—commenting that [...] "a little birdie" [...] {{had told him}} that she was in town—and invited her to his home to meet his family; she soon became a regular visitor there. [...] She alleged that in October 1930, while Brownlee was driving her home after one such visit, the premier <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> asked her what she knew [...] "about life". [...] On her {{response}} that she knew probably as much as any girl of eighteen, he invited her out the next evening for what she presumed would be some advice. [...] Instead, he drove her [...] west of town on Highway 16 and parked on a side road before asking her to have sex with him. [...] He said that he had been madly in love with her from the start, that he was lonely, {{that he and his wife}} had not lived together as man and wife in a long time, that his wife (an invalid) would be endangered by a pregnancy, and that he could not be premier any longer unless MacMillan agreed to have sex with him. [...] He told her that if she refused him, he would be forced to resume his sexual relationship with his wife, and that this would likely kill her. [...] MacMillan reacted fearfully, and asked if there was anything else she could do to help Brownlee and his wife; he replied that there was not.|$|E

60|$|Denis {{looked out}} over all this {{with a bit of}} a shiver. He had <b>taken</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> {{retained}} it in his almost unconsciously.|$|R

60|$|I {{could not}} resist, but, after putting the purse away, <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> kissed it.|$|E
60|$|But {{she would}} not let him go. She sought his mouth with <b>her</b> lips. He <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> tore them roughly apart and pushed her away.|$|R
60|$|She turned away, and Mr. Sharp, {{plucking}} up spirit, {{ventured to}} <b>take</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> squeeze it. A faint, a very faint, squeeze in return decided him.|$|R
60|$|What answer could I make? I {{could only}} <b>take</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> look at <b>her</b> with my whole heart {{as well as}} my eyes would let me.|$|R

60|$|I <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> held it a {{few moments}} without a word. Then she gently withdrew it.|$|E
60|$|From {{that moment}} {{she had won}} her pardon. He <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> made her sit by him.|$|E
