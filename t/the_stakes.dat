5|$|Khai's {{appeal was}} rebutted with {{an appeal to}} history, {{nationalist}} sentiment and a demand that the blame for death and destruction lay with the colonial forces and their Vietnamese assistants. Phan raised <b>the</b> <b>stakes</b> above family and village to the entire nation and its populace.|$|E
5|$|The {{victory in}} <b>the</b> <b>Stakes,</b> when {{combined}} with Secretariat's previous victories in the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes, meant he completed the Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing. This was significant as he was the ninth horse to complete the feat and broke a 25-year drought where a horse failed to complete the achievement.|$|E
5|$|That day at Belmont Park $7.9 {{million was}} wagered on the nine races that were held during the day, which {{includes}} $2.2 million from off-track betting. A total of $5.6 million was bet through the mutuels that day. <b>The</b> <b>Stakes</b> itself had $519,689 bet on it. Bettors holding 5,617 winning parimutuel tickets on Secretariat never redeemed them, presumably keeping them as souvenirs {{and also because}} the $2 was worth $2.20.|$|E
50|$|At {{the age of}} two, he won <b>the</b> Great Eclipse <b>Stakes,</b> <b>the</b> Futurity <b>Stakes,</b> <b>the</b> Great American <b>Stakes,</b> <b>the</b> Great Trial <b>Stakes,</b> <b>the</b> Hyde Park <b>Stakes,</b> <b>the</b> Matron <b>Stakes</b> and <b>the</b> Produce <b>Stakes.</b>|$|R
50|$|The ward PEC {{normally}} meets weekly while <b>the</b> <b>stake</b> PEC {{tends to}} meet twice a month. However, both committees often meet in ward or stake councils that involve more people. The ward council tends to {{also include the}} Relief Society president, the Young Women president, the Primary president, and the Sunday School president. <b>The</b> <b>stake</b> council includes <b>the</b> <b>stake</b> PEC, <b>the</b> <b>stake</b> Relief Society president, <b>the</b> <b>stake</b> Young Women president, <b>the</b> <b>stake</b> Young Men president, <b>the</b> <b>stake</b> Primary president, and <b>the</b> <b>stake</b> Sunday School president.|$|R
5000|$|The {{presiding}} {{officer in}} a stake {{is known as}} <b>the</b> <b>stake</b> president. <b>The</b> president is assisted by two counselors and the three together form a <b>stake</b> presidency. <b>The</b> <b>stake</b> presidency is assisted in turn by a twelve-member body, called <b>the</b> <b>stake</b> high council. <b>The</b> members of <b>the</b> <b>stake</b> presidency and stake high council hold the priesthood office of high priest. <b>The</b> <b>stake</b> presidency and <b>the</b> high council handle the administrative and judicial business of <b>the</b> <b>stake.</b> <b>The</b> three members of <b>the</b> <b>stake</b> presidency are given the honorific title [...] "President".|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>stakes</b> {{were raised}} in the {{conflict}} on 10 October, when the High Court declared valid the Act granting the territories two senators each. In a half-Senate election, most successful candidates would not take their places until 1 July 1976, but the territories' senators, and those filling Field's and Bunton's seats, would assume their seats at once. This gave Labor an outside chance of controlling the Senate, at least until 1 July 1976.|$|E
5|$|By early 1101, Henry's {{new regime}} was {{established}} and functioning, {{but many of}} the Anglo-Norman elite still supported Robert, or would be prepared to switch sides if Henry's elder brother appeared likely to gain power in England. In February, Flambard escaped from the Tower of London and crossed the Channel to Normandy, where he injected fresh direction and energy to Robert's attempts to mobilise an invasion force. By July, Robert had formed an army and a fleet, ready to move against Henry in England. Raising <b>the</b> <b>stakes</b> in the conflict, Henry seized Flambard's lands and, with the support of Anselm, Flambard was removed from his position as bishop. Henry held court in April and June, where the nobility renewed their oaths of allegiance to him, but their support still appeared partial and shaky.|$|E
5|$|In his {{breeding}} career, Springbok sired <b>the</b> <b>stakes</b> winners Audrain, East Lynne, Ethel, Huntress, and Vallera. Audrain, an 1881 stallion out of Alme by Planet, won the 1884 Latonia Derby, 1884 St. Louis Derby and the 1884 Hindoo Stakes. East Lynne was an 1882 mare out of Easter Planet by Planet. East Lynne won the 1885 Dixie Stakes and the 1885 Hunter Handicap. Ethel, an 1888 mare out of La Vena by Planet, won the 1890 Clipsetta Stakes and the 1891 Ashland Oaks. Huntress was an 1885 mare out of Edith by {{the imported}} stallion Saxon. Huntress won the 1887 Clipsetta Stakes, the 1888 St. Louis Oaks, and the 1889 Cincinnati Hotel Handicap. Vallera, an 1888 stallion out of Valasco by Pat Malloy, won the 1891 Tennessee Derby, 1891 Travers Stakes, and the 1891 Kenner Stakes.|$|E
50|$|Old Rosebud {{returned}} to racing {{at the age}} of 8. Overall, he won <b>the</b> Yucatán <b>Stakes,</b> <b>the</b> Spring Trial <b>Stakes,</b> <b>the</b> Harold <b>Stakes,</b> <b>the</b> Cincinnati Trophy <b>Stakes,</b> <b>the</b> Flash <b>Stakes,</b> <b>the</b> United States Hotel <b>Stakes,</b> and <b>the</b> Kentucky Derby.|$|R

5000|$|Gemma di Vergy (1854) won <b>the</b> Fernhill <b>Stakes,</b> <b>the</b> Reading <b>Stakes,</b> <b>the</b> Avon <b>Stakes,</b> <b>the</b> Nursery Handicap, <b>the</b> Whittlebury <b>Stakes</b> and <b>the</b> Racing <b>Stakes,</b> sire of Gemma-di-Vergy (1863) who was {{exported}} {{in utero}} to Australia {{where he was}} a sire.|$|R
5|$|There {{was much}} {{speculation}} going into <b>the</b> <b>Stakes</b> over Secretariat's {{bid for the}} Triple Crown. Since 1948, when Citation achieved the feat, there had been six horses that had won both the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes before failing in the Belmont Stakes. When comparing Secretariat to those six horses' health and fitness before the Belmont Stakes, writer Bonifice felt Secretariat {{was in the best}} shape, almost as good as when he entered the Kentucky Derby weeks prior. Just days before the Belmont, Secretariat ran five furlongs in just under a minute in a morning workout. Following that, Secretariat's jockey Ron Turcotte told reporters that Secretariat was ready for a top charge on Saturday.|$|E
5|$|With the Indian Division committed, Montgomery {{decided to}} raise <b>the</b> <b>stakes</b> further by {{bringing}} the British 5th Infantry Division from the relatively tranquil XIII Corps {{front in the}} high mountains on the left wing of the 8th Army and insert them between the New Zealand and Indian Divisions. This would allow the Indian division to narrow and concentrate their attack and give Montgomery four divisions to continue the attack between Orsogna and the sea. By 12 December, the British 17th Infantry Brigade—the first of 5th Division's brigades—was in place and under the New Zealand division's command. Once 5th Division headquarters and its other brigades had arrived, these two left hand divisions were to be organised {{under the command of}} XIII Corps, commanded by Lieutenant-General Miles Dempsey.|$|E
5|$|Djokovic and Murray met for {{the first}} time since the {{aforementioned}} French Open final in the championship match of the season-concluding ATP World Tour Finals in London in November. Of the five meetings (all in championship matches) that took place between the pair in 2016, this one had added significance, as for the first time in tournament history, the two finalists had the chance to become year-end number 1 by winning the title. <b>The</b> <b>stakes</b> were high in Djokovic's case, as a win would have seen him win his fifth consecutive year-end title, and sixth overall (matching the record held by Roger Federer); Murray, on the other hand, was shooting for his first year-end title, having qualified for the championship match for the first time. Ultimately, Murray won in straight sets, ensuring he ended the year ranked world number one, and also becoming the first man other than Djokovic, Federer or Rafael Nadal to finish the year at the top of the rankings since Andy Roddick in 2003.|$|E
5000|$|... as a two-year-old, Tompion won <b>the</b> Hopeful <b>Stakes,</b> {{and placed}} in <b>the</b> Champagne <b>Stakes,</b> <b>the</b> Hollywood Juvenile Championship <b>Stakes,</b> <b>the</b> Saratoga Special <b>Stakes</b> and <b>the</b> Sanford <b>Stakes.</b> He came third in <b>the</b> Garden State <b>Stakes</b> and <b>the</b> Haggin <b>Stakes.</b>|$|R
50|$|In each <b>stake,</b> one of <b>the</b> meetinghouses is {{designated}} <b>the</b> <b>stake</b> center. This {{building is}} usually the largest meetinghouse in <b>the</b> <b>stake,</b> but where stakes are large in area <b>the</b> <b>stake</b> center may be chosen {{because it is more}} centrally-located in the boundaries of <b>the</b> <b>stake.</b> <b>The</b> <b>stake</b> center is where functions of <b>the</b> <b>stake</b> such as stake conferences, stake meetings, and stake activities are usually held. There are usually offices for conducting <b>stake</b> business in <b>the</b> <b>stake</b> center. During <b>the</b> mid-to-late 19th and early-20th century, in areas with larger LDS populations, stake tabernacles were used for most of the larger activities now performed at <b>stake</b> centers, while <b>the</b> <b>stake</b> offices were located in what was known as a stake house. In areas with fewer members and no stake tabernacle, a stake house was used like a modern stake center for both meetings and offices.|$|R
5|$|As a three-year-old, Harry Bassett {{also won}} the Jerome Handicap, <b>the</b> Travers <b>Stakes,</b> <b>the</b> Reunion <b>Stakes,</b> <b>the</b> Kenner <b>Stakes,</b> <b>the</b> Champion <b>Stakes</b> and <b>the</b> Jersey Derby. He was undefeated in nine starts at age three.|$|R
5|$|Each of {{the seven}} books is set {{over the course of}} one school year. Harry struggles with the {{problems}} he encounters, and dealing with them often involves the need to violate some school rules. If students are caught breaking rules, they are often disciplined by Hogwarts professors. The stories reach their climax in the summer term, near or just after final exams, when events escalate far beyond in-school squabbles and struggles, and Harry must confront either Voldemort or one of his followers, the Death Eaters, with <b>the</b> <b>stakes</b> {{a matter of life and}} death – a point underlined, as the series progresses, by characters being killed in each of the final four books. In the aftermath, he learns important lessons through exposition and discussions with head teacher and mentor Albus Dumbledore. The only exception to this school-centred setting is the final novel, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, in which Harry and his friends spend most of their time away from Hogwarts, and only return there to face Voldemort at the dénouement.|$|E
5|$|In the end, Emir Habibullah {{returned}} to his vacillating inactivity. He was aware the mission had found support within his council and had excited his volatile subjects. Four days after the draft treaty was signed, Habibullah called for a durbar, a grand meeting where a jihad {{was expected to be}} called. Instead, Habibullah reaffirmed his neutrality, explaining that the war's outcome was still unpredictable and that he stood for national unity. Throughout the spring of 1916, he continuously deflected the mission's overtures and gradually increased <b>the</b> <b>stakes,</b> demanding that India rise in revolution before he began his campaign. It was clear to Habibullah that for the treaty to hold any value, it required the Kaiser's signature, and that for Germany to even attempt to honour the treaty, she would have to be in a strong position in the war. It was a good insurance policy for Habibullah.|$|E
5|$|Edward 'Ned' Trickett {{sought to}} win the Australian Championship from Rush. Trickett was outclassed by Rush at the 1874 and 1875 events, but {{afterwards}} competed at numerous regattas and in private matches, and his form was consistently improving. Trickett and his backers demanded that Rush contest the title on the Parramatta River where he won it from Hickey. Rush declined to row anywhere but on the Clarence River, and demanded that <b>the</b> <b>stakes</b> be not less than £500. By 1875, Rush had a wife and five children to support, {{as well as many}} business commitments, and could not afford to undertake a sporting endeavour involving a major investment in time and money, unless there was a chance of an adequate financial return. Dozens of letters and articles in the Australian press debated the issue for nearly two years, as Trickett and his supporters became increasingly incensed at Rush's stalling. Finally, former champion sculler and now a prosperous publican and backer of sculling events, offered to finance an attempt by an Australian sculler to topple the current holder of the World Sculling Championship, Englishman Joseph Sadler. Rush declined to travel to London. Trickett agreed to the journey, went to the Thames, beat Sadler, and brought home the World Championship to Australia. Rush challenged Trickett for the World title. Trickett demanded that the race be rowed on the Parramatta River, and the match came off on the afternoon of 30 June 1877.|$|E

25|$|The {{introduction}} of the Star Wheel also brought about {{a change in the}} bonus payout structure. Each section included several gold stars, which doubled <b>the</b> <b>stakes</b> if the wheel stopped on one of them. The maximum prize was thus $10,000 on the daytime series, and $20,000 on Match Game PM.|$|E
