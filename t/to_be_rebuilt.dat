5|$|When 74 Ts {{turbines}} {{were initially}} installed, {{the problems with}} them were so significant that all her power and propulsion machinery had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>rebuilt.</b> She was launched {{for a second time}} on 26 June 1914.|$|E
5|$|After {{winning the}} Battle of Hastings, William, Duke of Normandy was crowned King of England {{in the newly}} {{completed}} Westminster Abbey on Christmas Day 1066. William constructed the Tower of London, {{the first of the}} many Norman castles in England <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>rebuilt</b> in stone, in the southeastern corner of the city, to intimidate the native inhabitants. In 1097, William II began the building of Westminster Hall, close by the abbey of the same name. The hall became the basis of a new Palace of Westminster.|$|E

50|$|BNSF still rosters several SD9's. 4 <b>are</b> known <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> <b>rebuilt</b> into SD9-3's, numbers 1550-1553, {{and have}} modern EMD cabs.|$|R
5|$|Debts {{continued}} to increase, as the commissioners borrowed {{more money to}} fund the improvements. The new weir and lock at Pickerings failed in 1761 and both had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>rebuilt.</b> Work had started on Witton Brook in 1756, but the plans were revised in 1764 to increase the navigable depth to , and this work was completed in 1765.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{scorched}} earth {{tactics of}} retreating Wehrmacht troops, large areas in Northern Norway needed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>rebuilt.</b> In 1945, {{there was an}} overwhelming need for housing. An architectural competition produced several designs for simple, cost-effective, and rapidly assembled housing. The resulting houses were Spartan and broke with building standards, but met an immediate need for shelter.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Iniki's {{high winds}} caused {{extensive}} damage in Kauai. 1,421houses were destroyed, and 63 were lost {{from the storm}} surge and wave action. A total of 5,152homes were severely damaged, while 7,178 received minor damage. On the south coast, hotels and condominiums received severe damage as well. A few were restored quickly, though some took several years <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>rebuilt.</b> One hotel—the Coco Palms Resort famous for Elvis Presley's Blue Hawaii—never reopened after the hurricane.|$|E
50|$|The castle, {{originally}} a timber motte and bailey structure, <b>is</b> believed <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> <b>rebuilt</b> in {{stone in the}} later years of the 1100s.|$|R

5|$|In 1941, {{during the}} Second World War, the {{building}} was destroyed by an incendiary bomb in the London Blitz. Despite much lobbying for the hall <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>rebuilt,</b> the government decided against doing so. The main musical functions of the Queen's Hall were {{taken over by the}} Royal Albert Hall for the Proms, and the new Royal Festival Hall for the general concert season.|$|E
5|$|Millennium Park {{is built}} {{on top of a}} large {{underground}} parking garage. Construction started before the park's design was completed, and in January 2000, 17 additional caissons had {{to be added to the}} partially built garage to support the weight of Gehry's pavilion. In April the tops of all these caissons had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>rebuilt</b> for changes in the pavilion's foundation.|$|E
5|$|On William Cubitt's advice the two {{stations}} in the cemetery were built as temporary structures, in the expectation that they would need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>rebuilt</b> once the railway was operational and the issues with operating a railway of this unique nature became clearer. Both were designed by Sydney Smirke, who presented his designs to the LNC in March 1854.|$|E
50|$|After the Velvet Revolution, Nána (1990) and Obid (1998) became {{separate}} villages again. The Mária Valéria bridge <b>to</b> Hungary <b>was</b> <b>rebuilt</b> for {{the third}} time and opened in 2001, boosting the local economy.|$|R

50|$|The St. James market which <b>is</b> {{located near}} <b>to</b> Vidale Street <b>was</b> <b>rebuilt</b> {{during the last}} twenty years.|$|R
5|$|The Germans also {{suffered}} heavily; the 47th Panzer Corps had committed its last reserves into the battle and could hardly afford {{to maintain its}} defensive line, while the 47th Volksgrenadier Division had suffered over 4,300 casualties during the fighting and the 340th Division had lost nearly 2,000 soldiers. This latter division {{was replaced by the}} 363rd Volksgrenadier and 10th SS Panzer Divisions, as the 340th was pulled out in order <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>rebuilt.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Pittsburgh Locomotive and Car Works {{locomotive}} acquired {{along with}} them could not be restored. Built in 1902, this locomotive was {{the oldest of the}} five locomotives purchased and was determined to have too many problems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>rebuilt.</b> It was stored out of use in California for a period before being sold to an unknown locomotive broker. Some of its parts were used to help restore the four Baldwin locomotives, including its smokestack, which was fitted to the WDWRR's No. 4 locomotive.|$|E
5|$|The first station <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>rebuilt</b> was Old Saybrook, {{the busy}} eastern {{terminus}} of the line. The new high-level island platform and pedestrian bridge opened on November 1, 2002. Old Saybrook had previous {{had only a}} single side platform serving {{a relatively small number}} of Amtrak trains; the rebuilt has two platforms serving three tracks, to allow Amtrak trains in both directions to stop or pass even while a SLE train is at the station.|$|E
5000|$|The next known {{bridge was}} {{recorded}} as [...] "cut down" [...] by royalist besiegers of Gloucester in 1643 which suggests {{it might have}} been a wooden structure: It <b>is</b> known <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> <b>rebuilt</b> of timber.|$|R
50|$|In June 1940, {{the village}} was almost totally {{destroyed}} during the German invasion. The church had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> completely <b>rebuilt</b> and includes works by Couvègnes.|$|R
50|$|Reconstruction of {{each section}} of the {{southern}} portion of Louisiana has been addressed in the Army Corps LACPR (Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration) Final Technical Report, which identifies areas <b>to</b> not <b>be</b> <b>rebuilt</b> and areas where buildings need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> elevated.|$|R
5|$|The route was {{completed}} in 1975 through California, and by 1977 through Arizona, though the bridge over the Colorado River was not completed until 1978. Since then, the freeway through San Diego has been widened due to increasing congestion, and another portion in Imperial County had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>rebuilt</b> following damage by the remnants of Hurricane Kathleen.|$|E
5|$|During {{the night}} of 24/25 July, the Australians {{attacked}} again, but after establishing a new defensive line, the 11th was forced to withdraw after suffering heavily from both friendly and enemy shelling. In the morning of 25 July, further casualties were sustained by German artillery. German infantry then launched a counterattack on the battalion's right, but the Australians managed to hold their ground. They remained in the line throughout the day, before the 19th Battalion arrived {{as part of the}} 5th Brigade's relief of the 3rd Brigade. Having lost 19 officers and 512 other ranks killed, wounded or missing, the battalion had suffered the most of all the 3rd Brigade's battalions and was moved back to Berteaucourt <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>rebuilt.</b>|$|E
5|$|During the partnership, work {{continued}} on designing new churches and restoring older ones. In 1884–85 a chapel was built at Carlett Park at Eastham in the Wirral and in 1884–87 St Deiniol's Church {{was built in}} Criccieth, Caernarfonshire. Christ Church, Rossett (1886–92), St Paul's Church, Colwyn Bay (1887–88 with later additions), and St Andrew's Church, West Kirby (1889–91) followed. StJohn's Church in Barmouth, Merionethshire was built between 1889 and 1895. It {{is one of the}} largest of Douglas's churches, although in 1891, during its construction, the tower collapsed and had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>rebuilt.</b> Other churches built in North Wales were Christ Church in Bryn-y-Maen, Colwyn Bay, and All Saints, Deganwy (both 1897–99).|$|E
5000|$|WDM 3A R: Formerly WDM-2. It <b>is</b> a <b>rebuilt</b> with DBR fitted {{on short}} hood. It <b>is</b> not related <b>to</b> WDM-3. They <b>are</b> <b>rebuilt</b> at DLMW, Patiala ...|$|R
50|$|FXE 3227 appears <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> <b>rebuilt</b> from an SDP40, but the {{original}} locomotive number is unknown. The steam generator air intake was plated over during the rebuild, but it retained the full compartment and vertical rear steps.|$|R
50|$|The village <b>was</b> <b>rebuilt</b> by George Freke Evans, as a {{model village}} to designs by Humphry Repton. The church, {{dedicated}} <b>to</b> All Saints, <b>was</b> <b>rebuilt</b> in 1867 but retains a mediaeval tower.|$|R
5|$|Glen Leigh {{has eight}} named waterfalls in 0.64miles (1.03km). It is 1.8miles (2.9km) from PA 118 {{in the south}} to Waters Meet and the {{southern}} end of Glen Leigh. The glen is also accessible from the north; it is 1.04miles (1.67km) from the Lake Leigh trailhead parking lot by Lake Jean to Onondaga, the northernmost waterfall. The Highland Trail is the 1.2-mile (1.9km) path between the northern ends of Glen Leigh and Ganoga Glen. It meets the Falls Trail just north of Onondaga Falls and has a short connector to F. L. Ricketts, the next waterfall south. The Falls Trail by both of these northernmost waterfalls had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>rebuilt</b> in the early 2000s.|$|E
5|$|In 1983 and 1987, Davis made {{unsuccessful}} {{requests for}} all of the chapter house stones. After the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, the de Young museum was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>rebuilt,</b> {{and the future of the}} stones was reconsidered. In September 1993, museum director Harry Parker joined with Davis to sign an unconditional permanent loan of the chapter house stones to New Clairvaux. In 1994, the city approved the loan with the stipulation that the building be restored accurately and that it be occasionally open to the public. The stones were transported in 20 truckloads to Vina. Inside an old brick barn built by Stanford to make brandy, the stones began to be fitted together, laid flat on Burke's plywood templates.|$|E
5|$|In February 1989 {{one hundred}} {{construction}} workers were assembling temporary housing {{for themselves in}} Leninakan {{with a plan to}} start on the local population's housing {{by the end of the}} month, though schools and factories were also on the list of facilities <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>rebuilt.</b> Deputy chairman of a city building and architecture council said that updated building codes like those in the United States were being drafted (along with a strict requirement that the new protocols be respected) and that the new buildings would be no taller than four stories and would be located away from areas with the highest seismic risk. Other officials decided that the town would be relocated several miles to the southwest.|$|E
50|$|In 1774, the two mills at the {{entrance}} <b>to</b> the millpond <b>were</b> <b>rebuilt</b> as one mill known as the Kings's mill.|$|R
50|$|The part-medieval {{bridge over}} the River Teme, linking Tenbury <b>to</b> Burford, Shropshire <b>was</b> <b>rebuilt</b> by Thomas Telford {{following}} flood damage in 1795.|$|R
50|$|This dates <b>to</b> 1432 and <b>was</b> <b>rebuilt</b> in 1745/1746. Many of {{the statues}} {{held in the}} chapel <b>were</b> moved <b>to</b> the church.|$|R
