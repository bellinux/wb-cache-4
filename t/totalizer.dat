LMS-????????? ? ?????????? ??????????????? ???????? ???????? ?? ????????? ????????????? ??????????? ??? ?????? ????????????? ???????????? ??????? ????? ? ?????? ????????? ?????? ?????. Introduction. Two-stage digital {{automatic}} compensators {{of active}} noise interference based on LS and RLS-algorithms provide parallel processing of signals and capability to connect/disconnect additional compensation channel block. LMS-algorithm {{is widely used}} for synthesis of digital automatic compensators of active noise interference. Its advantage is low computational cost. When solving certain practical problems correlation characteristics of interference signals are either given or their estimates are obtained. Problem statement. The first stage of the two-stage digital automatic compensator provides compensation of interference in the main channel using compensation channel signals {{of one of the}} blocks and orthogonalization of signals in the other block. The second stage provides compensation of the residue interference using the obtained orthogonalized signals. Modules of the first and the second stage are single type weight <b>totalizers.</b> We need to determine weight coeeficient of the two-stage digital automatic compensator with orthogonalization of signals of part of compensation channels based on LMS-algorithms and interference correlation characteristics. Using LMS-algorithm there was obtained two-stage digital automatic compensator with orthogonalization of part of compensation channels that is quasi-optimal regarding the criterion of minimum mean square error and it?s feature is lower computational complexity compared to two-stage digital automatic compensators based on LS and RLS-algorithms. It can operate in modes when preocessing of the complete training package of the input data is carried out in the first and then in the second stage {{as well as in the}} mode of simultaneous operation of the stages. There have been acheived analytical expressions for defining weight coefficients of modules in the first and in the second stage of the automatic compensator determined on the basis of selective and precisely known correlation characteristics of input interference signals. LMS-method based two-stage digital automatic compensator efficiency analysis with simultaneously operating stages and its comparison with a known one-stage automatic compensator with the same number of compensation channels were conducted with the help of static modeling at various conditions of interference correlation matrix and various numbers of interference sources. Conclusions. The obtained two-stage digital automatic compensator with orthogonalization of part of compensation channels is quasi-optimal regarding the criterion of minimum mean square error and it has lower computational complexity compared to two-stage digital automatic compensators based on LS and RLS-algorithms. Weight coefficients of the automatic compensators determined on the basis of selective and precisely known correlation characteristics of input interference signals are optimal regarding the criterion of least squares and minimum mean square error respectively. The obtained two-stage digital automatic compensators provide capability to connect/disconnect additional compensation channel block and appropriate computational stage modules proportionately to the interference situation. ??????????? ?????? ??????????? ??????? ????????????? ???????????????? ???????????????? c ???????????????? ???????? ????? ??????????????? ??????? ?? ??????

40|$|Pseudo-Boolean constraints, {{also known}} as 0 - 1 Integer Linear Constraints, are used to model many {{real-world}} problems. A common approach to solve these constraints is to encode them into a SAT formula. The runtime of the SAT solver on such formula is sensitive to {{the manner in which}} the given pseudo-Boolean constraints are encoded. In this paper, we propose generalized <b>Totalizer</b> encoding (GTE), which is an arc-consistency preserving extension of the <b>Totalizer</b> encoding to pseudo-Boolean constraints. Unlike some other encodings, the number of auxiliary variables required for GTE does not depend on the magnitudes of the coefficients. Instead, it depends on the number of distinct combinations of these coefficients. We show the superiority of GTE with respect to other encodings when large pseudo-Boolean constraints have low number of distinct coefficients. Our experimental results also show that GTE remains competitive even when the pseudo-Boolean constraints do not have this characteristic. Comment: 10 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables.

Fuels and solvents were burned on a portion of OU 1 called the Fire Drill Area (FDA) during airport fire suppression training between 1962 and 1985. This activity resulted in soil and groundwater contamination in the unconfined A-aquifer. In the late 1980 's, soil excavation and bioremediation were successful in remediating soil contamination at the site. Shortly thereafter, a groundwater pump, treat, and recharge system commenced operation.

40|$|Graduation date: 1965 A {{technique}} for estimating {{gross primary production}} and respiration of periphyton communities, in situ, in small turbulent streams was developed using a photosynthesis-respiration chamber in a modified "light and dark bottle" method. Trays containing portions of the substrate bearing the benthic community were embedded in the stream, level with the bottom. A clear plexiglas cover could be clamped to a tray to make it part of a closed {{system in which the}} water was mixed, circulated, and exchanged to facilitate measurement of changes in the concentration of dissolved oxygen. The rates of gross primary production and respiration of the periphyton communities in two coastal streams in Oregon were estimated periodically during the six months from July through December 1964 by hourly determinations of the changes in concentration of dissolved oxygen in the chamber. The rates so determined were used to demonstrate seasonal trends in both processes and to obtain quantitative relationships between these processes and the environmental parameters known to control them. These relationships were determined by formulating multiple regression equations for both components of community metabolism using light intensity, water temperature, and plant biomass as the independent variables for gross production and the latter two plus the wet weight of the animal fraction of the community for respiration computations. Respective R² values of 0. 971 and 0. 800 for each stream indicated that most of the variability in the gross production process was accounted for and that the relationships involved were not the same in both streams. A single R² value of 0. 821 was obtained from the measurements of community respiration since differences in the variability between streams were not statistically significant. The resulting equations were also used to predict production and respiration on a monthly basis. A portable illumination <b>totalizer</b> was used to measure incident solar radiation striking the streams in gram-calories per cm². The influence of the canopy and surrounding topography in determining available light was found to be significant and varied for each stream. Approximately 75 to 95 percent of the total light energy was absorbed and reflected and did not reach the communities in the streams. The predicted range of gross production (0. 34 -l. 28 g O₂/m²/day) was substantially lower than results reported from other in situ investigations using the oxygen method. The most apparent reasons for these low levels were low light availability and instability of the bottom substrate. An asymptotic gross photosynthesis-light intensity curve was obtained by plotting actual dissolved oxygen changes against observed light intensities. The shape of the curve was similar to that obtained in a laboratory community. Predicted rates of respiration (0. 22 - 1. 60 g O₂/m²/day) were consistently higher than equivalent estimates of gross production until November, when the animal fraction of the community was reduced. For most of the season both streams were heterotrophic, obtaining a significant amount of their energy from the surrounding watershed...|$|E
