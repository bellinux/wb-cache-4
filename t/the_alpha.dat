5|$|In the Geiger–Marsden experiment, Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden (colleagues of Rutherford {{working at}} his behest) shot alpha {{particles}} at thin sheets {{of metal and}} measured their deflection {{through the use of}} a fluorescent screen. Given the very small mass of the electrons, the high momentum of <b>the</b> <b>alpha</b> particles, and the low concentration of the positive charge of the plum pudding model, the experimenters expected all <b>the</b> <b>alpha</b> particles to pass through the metal foil without significant deflection. To their astonishment, a small fraction of <b>the</b> <b>alpha</b> particles experienced heavy deflection. Rutherford concluded that the positive charge of the atom must be concentrated in a very tiny volume to produce an electric field sufficiently intense to deflect <b>the</b> <b>alpha</b> particles so strongly.|$|E

5|$|A {{few months}} later in 1974, {{researchers}} including Glenn T. Seaborg and Albert Ghiorso at the University of California, Berkeley, and E. Kenneth Hulet from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, also synthesized the element by bombarding a californium-249 target with oxygen-18 ions, using equipment similar to that which had been used for the synthesis of element 104 five years earlier, observing at least seventy alpha decays, seemingly from the isotope seaborgium-263m with a half-life of 0.9±0.2seconds. <b>The</b> <b>alpha</b> daughter rutherfordium-259 and granddaughter nobelium-255 had previously been synthesised and the properties observed here matched with those previously known, as did the intensity of their production.

40|$|The {{physical}} {{mechanisms that}} govern <b>the</b> variation of <b>alphas</b> of a silicon p-n-p-n device with current are investigated and an analytical expression for <b>the</b> small-signal <b>alphas</b> is derived.

A numerical example is worked out and <b>the</b> small-signal <b>alpha,</b> <b>the</b> d. c. <b>alpha,</b> <b>the</b> transport factor and the injection efficiency are plotted as functions of current for several values of base width of the p-n-p section of a p-n-p-n device.
