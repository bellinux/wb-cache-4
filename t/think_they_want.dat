500|$|Holley auditioned {{to become}} a {{featured}} vocalist on the American reality television show Dancing with the Stars. The audition consisted of him performing seven different sounds, ranging from Frank Sinatra to Sly Stone. He was successful and became a featured singer {{during the first three}} seasons of the series. Holley later noted that the concept of diversity in vocal performance was not a new experience for him. [...] "I've been at sessions where a producer has said he wants me to sound like Michael Jackson and Bruce Springsteen at the same time. I've had people say can you make it a little more green. Huh? It's tricky." [...] He added, [...] "Sometimes they <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> Sheryl Crow, because she has a hit single. But what they really want is magic, and that is whatever you, as an individual, can bring. It's a tough call between being a blank slate and being yourself." ...|$|E
500|$|Barkley is {{an outspoken}} {{supporter}} of gay rights. In 2006, he told Fox Sports: [...] "I'm a big advocate of gay marriage. If {{they want to}} get married, God bless them." [...] Speaking to Wolf Blitzer on CNN two years later, he said: [...] "Every time I hear the word 'conservative,' it makes me sick to my stomach, because they're really just fake Christians, as I call them. That's all they are. ... I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to be judge and jury. Like, I'm for gay marriage. It's none of my business if gay people want to get married. I'm pro-choice. And I think these Christians, first of all, they're not supposed to judge other people. But they're the most hypocritical judge of people we have in the country. And it bugs the hell out of me. They act like they're Christians. They're not forgiving at all." [...] During a 2011 Martin Luther King, Jr. Day double-header on TNT, Barkley responded to a statement made by Dr. King's daughter Bernice, by saying, [...] "People try to make it about black and white. [...] he talked about equality for every man, every woman. We have a thing going on now, people discriminating against homosexuality in this country. I love the homosexuality people. God bless the gay people. They are great people." ...|$|E

Whereas I want to do the Western. Because, you see, how else can you justify all of the punching and kicking and violence, except in the period of the West?" ...|$|E
5000|$|In a 1985 {{interview}} with People, Tullis said, [...] "They {{tried to say}} his intelligence was impaired, but it wasn't true. I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> {{to keep him out}} of the classroom because thought it would bother the other kids' parents." ...|$|R
25|$|Ian Meckiff had {{destroyed}} their batting lineup in the just-completed second Test and their bad luck continued when {{two of their}} players were injured in a car smash on their journey up to Wagga from Melbourne. I don't really <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> to play this match at all.|$|R
2500|$|The album {{divided the}} Pumpkins' fanbase. Corgan would later admit, [...] "I {{know a lot}} of our fans are puzzled by Zeitgeist. I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> this massive, grandiose work, but you don't just roll out of bed after seven years without a {{functioning}} band and go back to doing that".|$|R
2500|$|It later {{began to}} give cardholders 10% off {{selected}} products, {{as well as}} free hot drinks in store. Managing director Mark Price has said that this offer has made Waitrose the second largest provider of coffee in the UK, calling it a [...] "phenomenal" [...] response that showed schemes offering loyalty points to be meaningless. He told The Daily Telegraph: [...] "Giving free coffee or free newspapers is disruptive to the market, but I {{think that is what}} customers want, I don't <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> a point. I mean, what is a point? I think it's meaningless. It doesn't have the richness, it doesn't have the affinity you can gauge if you engage with your customers in a different way. It is about what do consumers value today, not what did they value historically. So green shield stamps, or points, were a response to what happened post-war [...] [...] [...] I just don't think that is where the world is now." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Do {{you mean}} my cousin? Oh, {{she has a}} visitor and doesn't want me. Then Miss Stackpole and Bantling have gone out to a cafe to eat an ice--Miss Stackpole delights in an ice. I didn't <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> me either. The opera's very bad; the women look like laundresses and sing like peacocks. I feel very low." ...|$|R

5000|$|Peg's Place {{was located}} at 4737 Geary Boulevard in the Richmond District of San Francisco and was popular during the 1970s and 80s. In 1975, it was {{described}} as a “sedate location for gay women to socialize”, featuring “unprepossing décor, a fake gas fed fireplace, pool and a Pong machine.” An ex-patron, interviewed in 2015 , said the bar in its early days was a place where [...] "you could wear pants, but not blue jeans.... "I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> you to be--maybe they call it classy. <b>They</b> didn't <b>want</b> to <b>think</b> <b>they</b> catered to bums or truck-driver types." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "To see her people? No, I don't <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> me {{very badly}}--and I didn't want very badly to go. Why should I? It's better for married {{people to be}} {{separated}} sometimes." ...|$|E
6000|$|Clavering nodded. [...] "He {{put them}} into lard. Now, the Brand Company hold Tillotson's biggest contract, and if it suited them they could break him. I don't <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to. Tillotson {{is a kind of}} useful man to them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't <b>think</b> <b>they</b> will <b>want</b> water, Master. <b>They</b> {{had as much}} as {{they could}} drink, before starting, and they are {{accustomed}} to drink when their work is over." ...|$|R
50|$|She's Crazy!: In this part, a {{woman is}} sitting {{in one of the}} subway's seat, when a man arrives and sits in her side. Despite the mans being totally innocent, the woman <b>thinks</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to date her. She tells them an absurd history about how dating her will be. The mans get annoyed and go away, calling her a crazy. Then, the woman repents and try to sweetly call them back, however, this never works.|$|R
5000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> more time, {{but it was}} {{impossible}} with my family commitments and my other activities," [...] Foster said. [...] "And I told them I wasn't able to move to Orange County. With my work in Europe, that would have been impossible. But my wife and I had gotten so excited about the possibility that we were considering moving back to the United States in a couple of years, to New York, so we could be midway between Southern California and Europe." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You don't suppose {{those poor}} Boers {{are going to}} let you out once they have got you in?" [...] went on the tormentor. [...] "Why, man, it's against human nature. You've got all their wool: now do you <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> you to have their skin too?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{can never}} get on common ground with them in that way," [...] said the minister. [...] "No doubt they <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to do them good; but good is from the heart, {{and there is no}} heart in what they propose. The working people would know that at once." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, it {{certainly}} was a good job done," [...] said the captain. [...] "But it makes me boil to <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to keep me off my own ship. On the ocean that would be mutiny, and I could hang every mother's son {{of them from the}} yardarm for it." ...|$|E
5000|$|Mitchell {{said that}} his {{performance}} on the Late Show with David Letterman as Hedwig was interesting: [...] "During rehearsal, a disembodied voice emanating from the control booth gently told me that I couldn't rip my wig off during the song ("Tear Me Down"). I asked why, {{but there was only}} silence from on high. So when we taped, I ripped it off after the song. They edited it out. I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> people to <b>think</b> I was a woman and not a man in drag." ...|$|R
2500|$|Cognitive {{liberty is}} not {{currently}} {{recognized as a}} human right by any international human rights treaty. While freedom of thought is recognized by Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), freedom of thought can be distinguished from cognitive liberty in that the former is concerned with protecting an individual’s freedom to <b>think</b> whatever <b>they</b> <b>want,</b> whereas cognitive liberty is concerned with protecting an individual’s freedom to <b>think</b> however <b>they</b> <b>want.</b> Cognitive liberty seeks to protect an individual’s right to determine their own state of mind and be free from external control over their state of mind, rather than just protecting the content of an individuals’ thoughts.|$|R
6000|$|... "I found it," [...] she answered. [...] "I {{felt that}} it was there. I have brought them up with me to see it. I <b>think</b> that <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to ask you some questions. But first, come and listen." ...|$|R
6000|$|But {{the idea}} here put forward did not suit the idea which was running in Mrs. Clavering's mind. [...] "Edward and Mary are very well off," [...] she said. [...] "His own {{property}} is considerable, and I don't <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> anything. Besides, he would hardly like {{to give up a}} family living." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{dare say}} they could if the spirits were on the table--in a bottle," [...] replied Wilson, with a curl of his pale lip. [...] "The people round here, when they're all sodden up with Irish whisky, may believe in such things. I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> a little {{education}} in this country." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Here are {{the dear}} children, Edmund," [...] Mrs. Hale said. [...] "What do you <b>think!</b> <b>They</b> <b>want</b> {{to buy the}} Madrono Ranch. They've been three years searching for it--I forgot to tell them we had searched ten years for Trillium Covert. Tell them all about it. Surely Mr. Naismith is still of a mind to sell!" ...|$|E
500|$|The band's new album, Zeitgeist, was {{released}} that same month on Reprise Records, entering the Billboard charts at number two and selling 145,000 copies {{in its first}} week. Zeitgeist received mixed reviews, {{with much of the}} criticism targeted at the absence of half of the original lineup. The album divided the Pumpkins' fanbase. Corgan would later admit, [...] "I know a lot of our fans are puzzled by Zeitgeist. I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> this massive, grandiose work, but you don't just roll out of bed after seven years without a functioning band and go back to doing that".|$|R
5000|$|Entry. The {{prospective}} {{client and}} Interim make initial contact {{and explore the}} requirement sufficiently for the client {{to be able to}} decide to engage the interim manager (or not) to address the situation. This is likely to involve a ‘preliminary’ assessment of what the client <b>thinks</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> and the scope of the interim manager’s contribution. It is also likely to involve a due diligence and interview process to make sure the interim manager is the right fit for the business. Typically the entry stage takes place over one or more initial meetings and results in the interim manager’s provisional engagement.|$|R
5000|$|Amy Cavanaugh in the Decider: DC writes [...] "With this spring's {{opening of}} Eatonville, his Zora Neale Hurston-themed restaurant, Andy Shallal {{is trying to}} mend a decades-old {{literary}} rift between the author and her contemporary, Langston Hughes, whom Shallal's Busboys And Poets chain is named in honor of. The two writers tried to collaborate on a play, Mule Bone, but things went sour: “They fought over copyright issues, but I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> to be friends,” says Shallal. Since the restaurants are {{across the street from}} each other, Shallal sees it as a chance to reunite the two writers." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They rode {{this morning}} {{back to the}} other Boers. I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to bring a party of them here to settle, if they like this place, as it is so easy to defend. They said they would return to-morrow, and that {{meanwhile}} we were quite safe, as they had sure tidings that all the Zulus were back over the Tugela, taking some of their wounded with them, and also the Boer cattle as an offering to Dingaan. But come to the house, Allan--our home that I had made ready for you as well as I could. Oh! my God! our home on the threshold of which I believed you would never set a foot. Yes, when the moon rose from that cloud I believed it, and look, they are still quite close together. Hark, what is that?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Subsequent {{remarks by}} Zuffa {{spokesperson}} Dana White however cast {{doubt as to}} what the new owners would actually do with Pride. After the sale officially closed on May 25, 2007, White remarked that he planned on bringing Pride's biggest names into UFC competition instead of keeping them in Pride and that they were still deciding on what to do with Pride itself. In later comments made in August 2007, White expressed doubt that Zuffa can resurrect Pride in Japan, claiming, [...] "I've we pulled everything out of the trick box that I can and I can't get a TV deal over there with Pride. I don't <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> us there. I don't <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> me there." ...|$|E
5000|$|He is {{a critic}} of the concept of Emotional Intelligence. In recent years, he has become an outspoken {{opponent}} of the animal rights movement, especially the organization People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.

5000|$|Personalization is {{also being}} {{considered}} for use in less overtly commercial applications to improve the user experience online. Internet activist Eli Pariser has documented that search engines like Google and Yahoo! News give different results to different people (even when logged out). He also points out social media site Facebook changes user's friend feeds based on what it <b>thinks</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to see. Pariser warns that these algorithms can create a [...] "filter bubble" [...] that prevents people from encountering a diversity of viewpoints beyond their own, or which only presents facts which confirm their existing views.|$|R
