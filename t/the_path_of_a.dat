5|$|Blast Corps is a 1997 action {{video game}} for the Nintendo 64 in which the player uses {{vehicles}} to destroy buildings in <b>the</b> <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> runaway nuclear missile carrier. In the game's 57 levels, the player solves puzzles by transferring between vehicles to move objects and bridge gaps. It was developed by Rare, published by Nintendo, and released in March 1997 in Japan and North America. A wider release followed {{at the end of}} that year.|$|E

5|$|Since the {{equations}} {{of general relativity}} are non-linear, a lump of energy made out of pure gravitational fields, like a black hole, would move on a trajectory which {{is determined by the}} Einstein equations themselves, not by a new law. So Einstein proposed that <b>the</b> <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> singular solution, like a black hole, would be determined to be a geodesic from general relativity itself.|$|E
5|$|Blast Corps is a single-player action video game. The player {{controls}} {{vehicles to}} destroy buildings, farms, and other structures in <b>the</b> <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> runaway nuclear missile carrier. The player fails if the carrier collides with an object. The eight demolition vehicles vary {{in the way}} they clear structures: the bulldozer rams, the dump truck drifts, the lightweight buggy crashes from higher ground, the tricycle shoots missiles, another truck presses outwards from its sides, and robot mechs tumble and stomp from the land and the air. The player must transfer between vehicles and other machinery to solve puzzles. Objectives include transporting timed explosive crates and bridging gaps. The game's puzzles increase in difficulty as the player progresses through its 57 levels.|$|E

5|$|Even in {{the absence}} of an impact, {{significant}} acceleration or deceleration of the head can cause TBI; however in most cases a combination of impact and acceleration is probably to blame. Forces involving the head striking or being struck by something, termed contact or impact loading, are the cause of most focal injuries, and movement of the brain within the skull, termed noncontact or inertial loading, usually causes diffuse injuries. The violent shaking of an infant that causes shaken baby syndrome commonly manifests as diffuse injury. In impact loading, the force sends shock waves through the skull and brain, resulting in tissue damage. Shock waves caused by penetrating injuries can also destroy tissue along <b>the</b> <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> projectile, compounding the damage caused by the missile itself.|$|E
5|$|Following this, the 31st Army drove {{towards the}} Baltic coast. The 331st {{captured}} the rail junction of Landsberg from the march, and Berestov ordered the division northward, unaware {{that it was}} coming into <b>the</b> <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> powerful German counterstrike to hold open a land link {{to the rest of}} Germany. Under pressure, the 331st fell back to the outskirts of Landsberg, and savage fighting ensued. Meanwhile, the German columns led by Waffen SS troops bypassed the town to the south and north, leaving the fighting elements of the division encircled for two days until they were relieved from outside. Meanwhile, the southern German column had rampaged through the mostly-defenseless rear elements of the division, destroying the medical-sanitation battalion, the motor pool, and other units; in total more than 300 men and women were killed and more wounded.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane King struck Miami {{around midnight}} local {{time with a}} very compact area of strong winds. Its eye was about 5.2miles (8.4km) in diameter; {{the western edge of}} the eye moved across Miami International Airport, which {{reported}} wind gusts of 125mph (202km/h), and the eastern side struck the Miami Weather Bureau office, which recorded sustained winds of 122mph (197km/h). The principal damage zone was sharply-defined in an area 14miles (23km) in diameter; the boundaries of the damage resembled <b>the</b> <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tornado, although a subsequent analysis indicated the majority of the damage was not tornadic in nature. There was one confirmed report of a damaging tornado in Davie. As it made landfall, Hurricane King produced lightning near its center, which was the first confirmed occurrence in Florida. The Weather Bureau considered King the severest hurricane since the 1926 Great Miami Hurricane to hit the area.|$|E

5|$|In the 18th century, the {{corridor}} {{of what is}} now MD194 was the HanoverFrederick portion of the Monocacy Road, a migration route that connected Philadelphia and Winchester, Virginia via York, Frederick, Boonsboro, and Williamsport. The Frederick County portion of the highway later became <b>the</b> <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pair of turnpikes. The Woodsboro and Double Pipe Creek Turnpike connected the namesake town and creek; the Woodsboro and Frederick Turnpike extended from Woodsboro south to the junction with the Liberty and Frederick Turnpike in Ceresville. The two turnpikes issuing from Ceresville were connected to Frederick by the Frederick and Woodsboro Turnpike. The Woodsboro and Frederick Turnpike was the last privately maintained toll road in Maryland when it was purchased by the Maryland State Roads Commission, the predecessor to the Maryland State Highway Administration, in 1921.|$|E
5|$|Often {{people try}} to avoid or outrun a tornado in a vehicle. Although cars can travel faster than the average tornado, the {{directive}} from the National Weather Service is for house-dwellers in <b>the</b> <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tornado to take shelter at home rather than risk an escape by vehicle. This {{is a result of}} several factors and statistics. An interior room inside a well-built frame house (especially one with a basement) provides a reasonable degree of protection from all but the most violent tornadoes. Underground or above-ground tornado shelters, as well as extremely strong structures such as bank vaults, offer almost complete protection. Cars, on the other hand, can be heavily damaged by even weak tornadoes, and in violent tornadoes they can be thrown large distances, even into buildings. High-profile vehicles such as buses and tractor trailers are even more vulnerable to high winds.|$|E

5|$|The sails {{belonged to}} a convoy of Indiamen which had {{gathered}} in Colombo on Ceylon before sailing together to China. By choosing to come up through the Bali Strait rather than through the Straits of Malacca, Farquharson had inadvertently led his fleet directly into <b>the</b> <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> French squadron whose six frigates were easily more powerful than his six East Indiamen. Farquharson was aware {{that he could not}} win a naval engagement with six frigates and so resolved instead to bluff the French into thinking his merchant convoy was a squadron of ships of the line. When he saw Cybèle approaching, Farquharson brought two ships forward to meet the frigate, gambling that in the low light Tréhouart might mistake the East Indiamen for warships. Farquharson compounded his ruse by raising Rainier's Blue ensign on Alfred and instructing the rest of the convoy to raise ensigns of their own.|$|E
5|$|The {{starting}} point for string theory {{is the idea that}} the point-like particles of quantum field theory can also be modeled as one-dimensional objects called strings. The interaction of strings is most straightforwardly defined by generalizing the perturbation theory used in ordinary quantum field theory. At the level of Feynman diagrams, this means replacing the one-dimensional diagram representing <b>the</b> <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> point particle by a two-dimensional surface representing the motion of a string. Unlike in quantum field theory, string theory does not yet have a full non-perturbative definition, so many of the theoretical questions that physicists would like to answer remain out of reach.|$|E
5|$|Two {{types of}} central forces—those that {{increase}} linearly with distance, F = Cr, such as Hooke's law, and inverse-square forces, , such as Newton's law of universal gravitation and Coulomb's law—have {{a very unusual}} property. A particle moving under either type of force always returns to its starting place with its initial velocity, provided that it lacks sufficient energy to move out to infinity. In other words, <b>the</b> <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bound particle is always closed and its motion repeats indefinitely, no matter what its initial position or velocity. As shown by Bertrand's theorem, this property is not true for other types of forces; in general, a particle will not return to its starting point with the same velocity.|$|E

All victories were against MiG-17s. Of these 24.5 were shot down with cannon fire (one victory was shared with an F-4), and three with AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles. One F-105F is unofficially credited with downing three MiGs—one by air-to-air missile, the second by cannon fire and the third by jettisoning the centerline rack full of bombs directly into <b>the</b> <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> surprised MiG.|$|E
5|$|Escaping Monarch {{during a}} time stutter, Jack rescues either Nick or Amy, {{students}} apprehended by Monarch who agree to help him. Working off a clue with Beth Wilder, a friend of Will's working as double agent inside Monarch, Jack heads to the abandoned Bradbury Swimming Pool, where he finds that Will has built his own time machine and a counter-measure to fix the fracture, called the Chronon Field Regulator (CFR), but the time machine is inoperable. Jack suggests they kidnap Dr. Sofia Amaral, Paul's head of chronon research. Learning she will be attending a Monarch gala, Jack surrenders to Monarch, and learns that Paul was accidentally sent {{to the end of}} time in the future, only escaping by traveling in Will's machine back to its first activation in 1999.

5|$|Higinbotham {{designed}} {{a game that}} used an oscilloscope to display <b>the</b> <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> simulated ball on a tennis court viewed from the side. The attached computer calculated {{the path of the}} ball and reversed its path when it hit the ground. The game also simulated the ball hitting the net if it did not achieve a high enough arc as well as changes in velocity due to drag from air resistance. Two aluminum controllers were attached to the computer, each consisting of a button and a knob. Pressing the button hit the ball, and turning a knob controlled the angle of the shot. Originally, Higinbotham considered having a second knob to control the velocity of the shot, but decided it would make the controller too complicated. The device was designed in a few hours with the help of colleague Dave Potter and was assembled over three weeks with the help of technician Robert V. Dvorak. While most of the circuitry was based on vacuum tubes and relays, the circuits to display the graphics on the oscilloscope used transistors, then beginning to replace vacuum tubes in the electronics industry. Excluding the oscilloscope and controller, the game's circuitry approximately took up the space of a microwave oven.|$|E
