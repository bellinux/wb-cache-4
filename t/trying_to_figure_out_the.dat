25|$|Paul Schneider as Mark Brendanawicz, a {{city planner}} {{who entered the}} field {{with a sense of}} optimism, but has since become jaded and disillusioned. Schneider said early in the series he was {{insecure}} in the role because he was still <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> character's motivations. Schneider left the cast after the second season and the character is not referenced at any point during the remainder of the show.|$|E
500|$|The South Park creators and animators {{said they}} were still {{developing}} the characters and <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> future direction of the show with [...] "Weight Gain 4000", which was more slow-paced than the series would eventually become. The 30-page script was shorter than in later episodes, which would average between 45 to 50 pages. The child protagonists also spoke slower. While recording their voice performances, the actors read the lines slowly and the dialogue was then sped up to create the characters' distinctive voices. At that time, Parker and Stone had not mastered the pace at which they needed to speak. The crowd shots in [...] "Weight Gain 4000" [...] took a particularly long time to animate due to {{the large number of}} people featured, and the animators were especially proud of the use of depth and motion in the perspective of the crosshairs in Mr. Garrison's rifle scope as he tried to assassinate Kathie Lee Gifford. Mr. Garrison's hatred for Gifford was foreshadowed in [...] "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe", where the sentence [...] "I'm not positive, but I think Cathy [...] Lee Gifford is much older than she claims to be", can be seen on his classroom's chalkboard. During a flashback scene in [...] "Weight Gain 4000", an eight-year-old Mr. Garrison is shown to already be bald on top with gray hair {{on the side of his}} ears. This led to an inconsistency in the first season episode [...] "Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut", in which he has a full head of hair during a flashback.|$|E
500|$|Nick Offerman portrayed Ron Swanson, the {{director}} of the parks and recreation department, and Aubrey Plaza played April Ludgate, a sarcastic and uninterested college intern. [...] The part was written specifically for Plaza. After meeting her, [...] casting director Allison Jones told Schur, [...] "I just met the weirdest girl I've ever met in my life. You have to meet her and put her on your show." [...] Schur of meeting her, [...] "Aubrey came over to my office and made me feel really uncomfortable for like an hour, and immediately I wanted to put her in the show," [...] although the writers were not immediately sure what direction her character would take. Rounding out the main cast was Paul Schneider, best known for his work in independent films such as Lars and the Real Girl and The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. He was cast as Mark Brendanawicz, a city planner and Leslie's unrequited love interest. She still harbors feelings for Mark from a one-night sexual encounter years ago. Schneider said that early in the season he was insecure in the role because he was still <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> character's motivations. Chris Pratt played Andy Dwyer, Ann's well-intentioned but lazy and simple-minded boyfriend. Although Pratt appeared in every episode of season 1, he was credited as guest star until the second season, when he was promoted to the main cast. Andy was originally supposed to appear only in the first season, but the producers liked Pratt so much that, almost immediately after casting him, they decided to make Andy a regular character if the show was renewed.|$|E

500|$|... "I Am the Walrus" [...] was {{met with}} mostly {{positive}} reviews from critics. Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club gave the episode a positive review. In his review for the episode, he opined: [...] "The episode itself didn't disappoint either, as [...] this was a quality half-hour of jokes. Kaiser praised the argument between Stan and Steve, calling it a [...] "superb sequence". Concluding his review, Kaiser went on to write, [...] "Despite all the absurdity, the episode even manages to successfully come around to an emotional resolution when Stan, realizing that Steve is an utter failure at attempted mating, resolves to see Steve as a son instead of potential masculine competition. Then [...] there's a rape joke. But, it being American Dad, it's actually a surprisingly funny rape joke." [...] He went on to give the episode an [...] "A-", scoring higher than The Simpsons episode [...] "Love Is a Many Strangled Thing", but scoring lower than Bob's Burgers episode [...] "Spaghetti Western and Meatballs". Jason Hughes of TV Squad also reacted positively, writing, [...] "It was good to have American Dad back in the lineup. Roger was in fine form, and I can at least appreciate that they're {{trying to figure out}} how to make Hayley and Jeff work in the family dynamic. They never quite got there with Hayley alone, so maybe things will work better this way." [...] However, he was more critical on the sub-plot. In his review for the episode, Hughes opined: [...] "The B-story left me wanting. The writers are still <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> new dynamic of having Hayley married and Jeff living in the house with the Smiths. The whole thing has been barely addressed, and this week we got a fairly weak exploration of them having fairly standard marital problems." ...|$|E

2500|$|Wilson's {{creative}} and songwriting interests were revamped upon hearing the Ronettes' 1963 song [...] "Be My Baby". [...] "Be My Baby" [...] {{is considered the}} epitome of Spector's Wall of Sound, a recording method that fascinated Wilson {{for the next several}} decades. The first time he heard the song was while driving, and he became so overwhelmed that he had to pull {{over to the side of}} the road and analyze the chorus. He bought the record and kept it on his living room jukebox, listening to it whenever the mood struck him. Copies of the song were located everywhere inside his home, as well as inside his car and in the studio.

At Kate's request, Frank is <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> {{horoscope}} of the Kellers' missing son Larry, who disappeared three years earlier. While Kate still believes Larry is coming back, the Kellers' other son, Chris, believes differently.

Joe and Kate react to this news with shock but are interrupted by Bert, the boy next door. In a game, Bert brings up the word [...] "jail", making Kate react sharply. When Ann arrives, it is revealed that her father, Steve Deever, is in prison for selling cracked cylinder heads to the Air Force, causing the deaths of 21 pilots in plane crashes. Joe was his partner but was exonerated of the crime. Ann admits that neither she nor her brother keep in touch with their father any more and wonders aloud whether a faulty engine was responsible for Larry's death. After a heated argument, Chris breaks in and later proposes to Ann, who accepts. Chris also reveals that, while leading a company, he lost all his men and is experiencing survivor's guilt. Meanwhile, Joe receives a phone call from George, Ann's brother, who is coming there to settle something.|$|E
2500|$|Mollie King {{spoke about}} the album's sound saying {{that she had been}} joining playing on the studio [...] "messing around" [...] with a certain track. [...] "30 Days" [...] is about being a part from the person you love and {{counting}} down the minutes until you're back together. [...] "The song really struck a chord with us - it's a situation all of us can relate to, and we think a lot of fans will relate to it as well." [...] Rochelle Humes explained the concept of the single, [...] "It’s a really amazing, catchy song but the sentiment behind it is being all excited and counting down the days to seeing someone when you’ve really been missing that person." [...] The band revealed that they wanted to create an album which was [...] "amazing", [...] "crazy" [...] and [...] "very pop". King said [...] "What About Us" [...] features [...] reggae pop music influence, a little different from what band usually record, but the track is still really [...] "dancey" [...] and [...] "upbeat", as well a good song to dance to on either stage or at a club. When Una Healy was asked what the song was about she said that she [...] "did not know" [...] what the song was exactly about. [...] "To be honest I was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> other day what exactly it's about. I could bullshit away telling you, but I really don't know. But I think it's all about someone driving you crazy." [...] She said she [...] "thinks" [...] that 'What About Us' part means [...] "me and you getting together". She did point out that she did know that the song was about [...] "making you happy" [...] and that the track was good for the summer and will get you on the dancefloor. Rochelle Humes said that the band had recorded a new track, which features a more [...] "edgy" [...] vibe than their previous material. She also said that the track would be released at the end of Summer, which was revealed to be [...] "Gentleman". She also said [...] "It's very dancey", and that they hoped to experiment with other types of music genres on the album, she said: [...] "It's {{going to be a lot}} more edgy than our previous stuff and what we are known for. I think we are definitely a pop band so we will carry on doing what we do best." [...] She said that her most favourite thing about being a singer is that she can try out different styles of genres. The band warned fans that the new album would have a [...] "fresh sound". Although, the said they weren't changing the sound too much. [...] "It's a fresh start for a new album as it's got that slight reggae vibe, but is still a dance pop record." ...|$|E
