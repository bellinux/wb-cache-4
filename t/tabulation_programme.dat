40|$|M. A. South Africa {{has more}} than 450 rural towns where 10 % of the population, {{comprising}} about 80 % of the country's poorest of the poor, live. To promote development and prevent the residents of these towns and the surrounding rural areas from migrating to the larger towns and cities in search of jobs (thereby putting more strain on the resources available there), it was imperative that these towns and the rural areas be developed. This was the ideal aspired to in the seventies and eighties. After two previous attempts the government stepped in and launched the S. A. Regional Industrial Development Plan (RIDP) in 1982. The plan identified several smaller towns as potential recipients of special government incentives, to attract investments from the cities to these communities. Nkowankowa {{was one of these}} towns that was declared as an industrial development point (IDP). The plan had both economic and political objectives. On the economic side the plan was an attempt at fostering economic growth and job creation to the benefit of the local communities, {{while at the same time}} alleviating the pressure of urban growth experienced by larger cities. On the political side, it was an attempt to contain the Black population within the Homelands. As in the case of similar programmes implemented in other countries, this programme was less successful in South Africa. Most of the IDP's that showed some early success, soon failed. Nkowankowa was one of them, It started off well but soon stagnated and even declined. Data collected from industrialists and Gazankulu Development Corporation (GDC) were analysed using a frequency and <b>tabulation</b> <b>programme.</b> Most industries were established between 1982 and 1985. From 1986 the rate of industrial establishment declined, This show that industrial development in Nkowankowa was less than originally planned. The high failure rate of industries at Nkowankowa is due to the heavy dependence on incentives, agricultural and wood inputs. Periods of protracted droughts negatively affected processing industries in Nkowankowa. The decrease in the amount of incentives also forced firms to close or relocate to metropolitan areas. It is recommended that the community in Ritavi district should be assisted with necessary skills to enable them to gain control over their own economic future. They should become more involved in the economic development and job creation of this area. More jobs can also be created by expanding agricultural activities and enlisting the help of tertiary institutions in supporting, training and advising this community...|$|E
