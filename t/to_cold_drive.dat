We also {{show that a}} thermal gradient {{can be used to}} move magnetic skyrmions in insulating chiral magnets: the induced magnon flow from the hot <b>to</b> the <b>cold</b> region <b>drives</b> the skyrmions in the opposite direction via a magnonic spin transfer torque. Both results are combined to compute the effect of skyrmion motion on the ac current generation and demonstrate that skyrmions in insulators are a promising route for spin caloritronics applications.

The photomixer using NTT uni-travelling carrier photodiode has been demonstrated to have high power of 2 m W at 100 GHz and low amplitude noise of < 7 − 17 K/µW in the frequency range of 98 − 105 GHz. This option simplifies the LO part of the cartridge in the baseline ALMA and retains a future possibility for a direct photonic option. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Oligomeric enzymes can {{undergo a}} {{reversible}} loss of activity at low temperatures. One such enzyme is tryptophanase (Trpase) from Escherichia coli. Trpase is a pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) -dependent tetrameric enzyme with a Mw of 210 kD. PLP is covalently bound through an enamine bond to Lys 270 at the active site. The incubation of holo E. coli Trpases at 2 °C for 20 h results in breaking this enamine bond and PLP release, {{as well as}} a reversible loss of activity and dissociation into dimers. This sequence of events is termed cold lability and its understanding bears relevance to protein stability and shelf life. Results We studied the reversible cold lability of E. coli Trpase and its Y 74 F, C 298 S and W 330 F mutants. In contrast to the holo E. coli Trpase all apo forms of Trpase dissociated into dimers already at 25 °C and even further upon cooling to 2 °C. The crystal structures of the two mutants, Y 74 F and C 298 S in their apo form were determined at 1. 9 Å resolution. These apo mutants were found in an open conformation compared to the closed conformation found for P. vulgaris in its holo form. This conformational change is further supported by a high pressure study. Conclusion We suggest that cold lability of E. coli Trpases is primarily affected by PLP release. The enhanced loss of activity of the three mutants is presumably due to the reduced size of the side chain of the amino acids. This prevents the tight assembly of the active tetramer, making it more susceptible <b>to</b> the <b>cold</b> <b>driven</b> changes in hydrophobic interactions which facilitate PLP release. The hydrophobic interactions along the non catalytic interface overshadow the effect of point mutations and may account for the differences in the dissociation of E. coli Trpase to dimers and P. vulgaris Trpase to monomers. </p...|$|R
25|$|A {{piezoelectric}} transformer {{is a type}} of AC voltage multiplier. Unlike {{a conventional}} transformer, which uses magnetic coupling between input and output, the piezoelectric transformer uses acoustic coupling. An input voltage is applied across a short length of a bar of piezoceramic material such as PZT, creating an alternating stress in the bar by the inverse piezoelectric effect and causing the whole bar to vibrate. The vibration frequency is chosen to be the resonant frequency of the block, typically in the 100kilohertz to 1megahertz range. A higher output voltage is then generated across another section of the bar by the piezoelectric effect. Step-up ratios of more than 1,000:1 have been demonstrated. An extra feature of this transformer is that, by operating it above its resonant frequency, it can be made to appear as an inductive load, which is useful in circuits that require a controlled soft start. These devices can be used in DC–AC inverters <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>cold</b> cathode fluorescent lamps. Piezo transformers {{are some of the most}} compact high voltage sources.|$|R

40|$|We {{detail the}} rich {{molecular}} story of NGC 1266, its serendipitous discovery within the ATLAS 3 D survey (Cappellari et al. 2011) {{and how it}} plays host to an AGN-driven molecular outflow, potentially quenching all of its star formation (SF) within the next 100 Myr. While major mergers appear {{to play a role}} in instigating outflows in other systems, deep imaging of NGC 1266 as well as stellar kinematic observations from SAURON, have failed to provide evidence that NGC 1266 has recently been involved in a major interaction. The molecular gas and the instantaneous SF tracers indicate that the current sites of star formation are located in a hypercompact disk within 200 pc of the nucleus (Fig. 1; SF rate ≈ 2 M ⊙ yr- 1). On the other hand, tracers of recent star formation, such as the Hβ absorption map from SAURON and stellar population analysis show that the young stars are distributed throughout a larger area of the galaxy than current star formation. As the AGN at the center of NGC 1266 continues <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>cold</b> gas out of the galaxy, we expect star formation rates to decline as the star formation is ultimately quenched. Thus, NGC 1266 is in the midst of a key portion of its evolution and continued studies of this unique galaxy may help improve our understanding of how galaxies transition from the blue to the red sequence (Alatalo et al. 2011) ...|$|R

40|$|Although {{sensitivity}} <b>to</b> <b>cold</b> {{is reported}} {{in more than}} half of Japanese females, there are few studies investigating it in young generations including male subjects. This study examined relationships between sensitivity <b>to</b> <b>cold</b> and the health status in elementary, middle, high school, and college students in order to collect basic data to provide health care support for young people. A self-administered questionnaire survey was conducted involving 81 elementary, 226 middle, and 353 high school students living in Nara Prefecture, and 521 college students in Kyoto Prefecture (549 males and 632 females). The survey included questions that asked about the presence or absence, region, and level of sensitivity <b>to</b> <b>cold,</b> and health status (physical and psychological symptoms), and the results were compared between age groups and gender. In total, 70 % of the female students and 30 % of the male students reported sensitivity <b>to</b> <b>cold,</b> and they increased with age in both genders. In female subjects, the level of sensitivity <b>to</b> <b>cold</b> increased with age, and, in male subjects, it was strongest in high school students. The health status was poorest in high school students of both genders, and female subjects presented significantly greater physical and psychological symptoms in all age groups than males. A significant positive correlation (r= 0. 66) was observed between the levels of sensitivity <b>to</b> <b>cold</b> and health status. Although sensitivity <b>to</b> <b>cold</b> and a poor (physical and psychological) health status were identified mostly in female subjects in all ages, sensitivity <b>to</b> <b>cold</b> was also present in many male subjects. A strong correlation between sensitivity <b>to</b> <b>cold</b> and the health status suggested the importance of implementing measures to improve symptoms of sensitivity <b>to</b> <b>cold</b> and providing health care guidance. The poorest health status among high school students in both genders also indicated the need to provide health care guidance particularly for high school students...|$|R

40|$|In Drosophila melanogaster {{the fitness}} of males {{depends on a}} broad array of {{reproductive}} traits classified as pre- and post-copulatory traits. Exposure <b>to</b> <b>cold</b> stress, can reduce sperm number, male mating ability and courtship behavior. Therefore, it is expected that the adaptation <b>to</b> <b>cold</b> stress will involve changes in pre- and post-copulatory traits. Such evolution of reproductive traits in response <b>to</b> <b>cold</b> stress is not well studied. We selected replicate populations of D. melanogaster for resistance <b>to</b> <b>cold</b> shock. Over 37 - 46 generations of selection, we investigated pre- and post-copulatory traits such as mating latency, copulation duration, mating frequency, male fertility, fitness (progeny production) and sperm competitive ability in male flies subjected <b>to</b> <b>cold</b> shock and those not subjected <b>to</b> <b>cold</b> shock. We found that post cold shock, the males from the selected populations had a significantly lower mating latency along with, higher mating frequency, fertility, sperm competitive ability and number of progeny relative to the control populations. While most studies of experimental evolution of cold stress resistance have documented the evolution of survivorship in response to selection, our study clearly shows that adaptation <b>to</b> <b>cold</b> stress involves rapid changes in the pre- and post-copulatory traits. Additionally, improved performances under stressful conditions need not necessarily trade-off with performance under benign conditions...|$|R
