5|$|Canterbury Castle, {{also known}} as Arlington Castle, was a private house located in {{southwest}} Portland, Oregon and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Constructed during 1929–1931, the house was designed by Jeter O. Frye to resemble England's Canterbury Castle on the exterior and <b>to</b> <b>evoke</b> <b>the</b> Art Deco styling of Hollywood of the 1920s on the interior. The house included castle features such as a moat, drawbridge and turret and attracted paying tourists immediately following its completion.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>evoking</b> <b>the</b> author's early revolt {{from the}} modest circumstances {{into which he}} was born, Bealby satirizes a variety of features of English life {{on the eve of}} World War I. These include the popularity of Hegelianism of the British Idealist school (the Lord Chancellor is an amateur philosopher), the fashion of weekend parties, the cultivation of wealthy patrons by political parties, the ill-prepared state of the British military, and the egotism of small entrepreneurs (represented by Mr. Benshaw, a Crayminster horticulturalist).|$|R

5|$|Valerian {{holds an}} {{imperial}} council in Byzantium, attended by several named dignitaries, {{none of them}} otherwise attested and some holding offices not known to exist until the following century, at which the general 'Ulpius Crinitus' (a name apparently chosen <b>to</b> <b>evoke</b> <b>the</b> military glories of the Emperor Trajan) takes the young Aurelian (destined to be another military Emperor) as his adopted son. There are no grounds to believe this is anything other than invention.|$|E
5|$|According to Stratton and Martin, {{movement}} is the game's most important pillar. To help keep movement fast, weapon reloading was excluded and levels {{were designed to}} discourage players from hiding. On January 25, Stratton confirmed the game's feature of non-linear exploration and stated that combat is the game's focus and that {{the difficulty of the}} game was raised with the aim of creating an ultimate first-person shooter. On March 31, 2016, the release date of the Doom beta, a cinematic trailer directed by Joe Kosinski was created <b>to</b> <b>evoke</b> <b>the</b> game's three core pillars: incessant combat, terrifying demons, and powerful guns.|$|E
5|$|Outside {{the temple}} {{building}} proper was the temple enclosure, {{surrounded by a}} rectangular brick wall that symbolically protected the sacred space from outside disorder. On occasion this function was more than symbolic, especially during the last native dynasties {{in the fourth century}} BC, when the walls were fully fortified in case of Persian invasion. In late temples these walls frequently had alternating concave and convex courses of bricks, so that the top of the wall undulated vertically. This pattern may have been meant <b>to</b> <b>evoke</b> <b>the</b> mythological waters of chaos.|$|E

5|$|Starting {{development}} as an action role-playing sequel to , it retained elements from the Final Fantasy series while having its own story and gameplay elements. The producer of The 4 Heroes of Light, Tomoya Asano, returned to produce Bravely Default. The story's writer was Naotaka Hayashi, who {{was brought in}} from 5pb. due to his work on Steins;Gate. The characters designs were handled by multiple artists, including art director Akihiko Yoshida and Atsushi Ōkubo. The game was influenced by western video games and television series, and individual elements were inspired by aspects of the Dragon Quest series and Higurashi When They Cry. The music, composed by Revo of Sound Horizon, was intended <b>to</b> <b>evoke</b> <b>the</b> feelings of classic series such as Dragon Quest and SaGa.|$|E
5|$|Winners were {{presented}} with the H.P.Lovecraft bust through the 2015 awards; at that ceremony the presenters announced that future ceremonies will no longer use the trophy. Although controversy had arisen in recent years over Lovecraft's history of racism, no explicit reason was given for the change. A new statuette, designed by Vincent Villafranca, was announced in April 2017 {{to be used for}} the 2016 awards on. The new award, which depicts a tree in front of a full moon, was intended <b>to</b> <b>evoke</b> <b>the</b> use of trees and night imagery in mythology, fantasy, and horror works.|$|E
5|$|Hope shows {{its central}} {{character}} alone, {{with no other}} human figures visible and without her traditional fellow virtues, Love (also known as Charity) and Faith. She is dressed in classical costume, based on the Elgin Marbles; Nicholas Tromans of Kingston University speculated that her Greek style of clothing was intentionally chosen <b>to</b> <b>evoke</b> <b>the</b> ambivalent nature of hope in Greek mythology over the certainties of Christian tradition. Her pose is based on that of Michelangelo's Night, in an intentionally strained position. She sits on a small, imperfect orange globe with wisps of cloud around its circumference, against an almost blank mottled blue background. The figure is illuminated faintly from behind, as if by starlight, and also directly from the front as if the observer {{is the source of}} light. Watts's use of light and tone avoids the clear definition of shapes, creating a shimmering and dissolving effect more typically associated with pastel work than with oil painting.|$|E

5|$|Lydford Castle {{does not}} seem to be {{primarily}} designed to have a military function, although in 1199 when King John succeeded to the throne he had the castle garrisoned and expensively equipped to prevent any potential unrest breaking out in the region. The castle lacked the usual military features of the time, such as external gatehouses, and its design seems to have been intended <b>to</b> <b>evoke</b> <b>the</b> authority of a traditional defensive fortification rather than to resist an actual attack. Instead, as well as helping to deal with the wider problems in 1195, the castle appears to have been built with the intention of enforcing the stannary and forest law in Devon. It is possible that the Crown originally intended that the castle took over the stannary law across the whole of Cornwall and Devon, although in practice its role extended only to governing the Devon stannaries.|$|E
5|$|Stern shot Changeling in {{anamorphic}} format on {{35mm film}} using Kodak Vision 500T 5279 film stock. The film was shot on Panavision cameras and C-Series lenses. Due {{to the large}} number of sets, the lighting rigs were more extensive than on other Eastwood productions. The crew made several ceilings from bleached muslin tiles. Stern lit the tiles from above to produce a soft, warm light that was intended <b>to</b> <b>evoke</b> <b>the</b> period through tones close to antique and sepia. The crew segregated the tiles using fire safety fabric Duvatyn to prevent light spilling onto neighboring clusters. The key light was generally softer to match the warm tones given off by the toplights. Stern used stronger skypans—more intense than is commonly used for key lighting—to reduce contrasts when applying daytime rain effects, as a single light source tended to produce harder shadows.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{conducted}} off the Florida {{coast and}} the Bahamas {{have shown that}} silky sharks are highly sensitive to sound, in particular low-frequency (10–20Hz), irregular pulses. Experiments in which these sounds were played underwater attracted sharks from hundreds of meters away. Silky sharks likely orient to these sounds because they {{are similar to the}} noise generated by feeding animals such as birds or dolphins, thus indicating promising sources of food. These studies have also demonstrated that a silky shark attracted by one sound will quickly withdraw if that sound abruptly changes in amplitude or character; this change need not be a sound produced by a predator <b>to</b> <b>evoke</b> <b>the</b> reaction. Over repeated exposures, silky sharks habituate to the sound change and stop withdrawing, though it takes them much longer to do so compared to the bolder oceanic whitetip shark.|$|E

5000|$|Many Pangool are {{spirits of}} early {{ancestors}} who had died. They represent both Pangool of the paternal line (pangool o kurcala) {{and those of}} the maternal line (pangool o ƭeen yaay). These ancestors guide and protect their descendants. Many [...] have a master of the cult who knows how <b>to</b> <b>evokes</b> <b>the</b> ancestor. The earlier Pangool were not human beings, but superior beings created by Roog at the time human beings were created. They were believed to have been created by the divine in order to help human kind. It is for this reason why the terms Pangool and Nguus (Serer word for genie) are sometimes used interchangeably. Because some Pangool are linked to Serer lineages, only the head of the lineage schooled in the rituals can make a libation to the relevant Pangool or Fangool (the ancestor).|$|R
