40|$|Abstract Background Previous studies {{investigating}} the travellers’ knowledge, {{attitudes and practices}} (KAP) profile indicated an important educational need among those travelling to risk destinations. Initiatives to improve such education should target all groups of <b>travellers,</b> including business <b>travellers,</b> those {{visiting friends and relatives}} (VFRs), and elderly <b>travellers.</b> Methods In the years 2002 to 2009, a questionnaire-based survey was conducted at the Dutch Schiphol Airport with the aim to study trends in KAP of travel risk groups towards prevention of malaria. The risk groups last-minute <b>travellers,</b> solo-travellers, business <b>travellers,</b> VFRs and elderly <b>travellers</b> were specifically studied. Results A total of 3, 045 respondents were included in the survey. <b>Travellers</b> to destinations with a high risk for malaria had significantly more accurate risk perceptions (knowledge) than <b>travellers</b> to low-risk destinations. The relative risk for malaria in <b>travellers</b> to high-risk destinations was probably mitigated by higher protection rates against malaria as compared with <b>travellers</b> to low risk destinations. There {{were no significant differences in}} intended risk-taking behaviour. Trend analyses showed a significant change over time in attitude towards more risk-avoiding behaviour and towards higher protection rates against malaria in <b>travellers</b> to high-risk destinations. The KAP profile of last-minute <b>travellers</b> substantially increased their relative risk for malaria, which contrasts to the slight increase in relative risk of solo <b>travellers,</b> business <b>travellers</b> and VFRs for malaria. Conclusions The results of this sequential cohort survey in Dutch <b>travellers</b> suggest an annual 1. 8 % increase in protection rates against malaria coinciding with an annual 2. 5 % decrease in intended risk-seeking behaviour. This improvement may reflect the continuous efforts of travel health advice providers to create awareness and to propagate safe and healthy travel. The KAP profile of last-minute <b>travellers,</b> in particular, substantially increased their relative risk for malaria, underlining the continuous need for personal protective measures and malaria chemoprophylaxis for this risk group. </p...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} EU {{low-cost}} airlines have reported {{their success in}} attracting business <b>travellers</b> on some of their routes. Recent research shows that business <b>travellers</b> working for small companies {{are more willing to}} trade in-flight service, frequency and FFP points for lower fares than those working for larger companies. A survey of short haul business <b>travellers</b> using a major carrier at Heathrow airport is compared with <b>travellers</b> of a low-cost airline at a secondary London airport. The hypothesis that business <b>travellers</b> using low-cost airlines form a separate market segment from business <b>travellers</b> using full-service airlines is not shown. Short haul business <b>travellers</b> are, en masse, becoming increasingly price sensitive. <b>Travellers</b> using network carriers use low-cost airlines and vice versa. Corporate influence in purchase decision making is more evident in <b>travellers</b> choosing network carriers and this is partly a function {{of the size of the}} company, with larger companies favouring such carriers. Marketing implications for both low-cost and full-service airlines are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Community {{policing}} {{initiatives that}} aim to address diversity are increasingly required {{to engage with}} Gypsies and <b>Travellers.</b> In this article the policing of Gypsies and <b>Travellers</b> is outlined through analysis of empirical research in the south-west of England. The {{research shows that the}} police work with multiple public and private agencies to control the movement and settlement of Gypsies and <b>Travellers,</b> but the engagement of Gypsies and <b>Travellers</b> in community policing initiatives is limited. The police primarily engage with Gypsies and <b>Travellers</b> through enforcement practice. Gypsies and <b>Travellers</b> are shown here to respond to their experiences of policing {{in a number of ways}} that attempt to place them beyond the gaze of formal agencies. In conclusion the article questions the degree to which policing agencies can reach Gypsies and <b>Travellers</b> via community policing approaches. Key Words diversity • governance • Gypsies and <b>Travellers</b> • policing This article will draw on research carried out with Gypsies and <b>Travellers</b> to discuss the reach of community policing in a diverse society. Initially the art-icle will contextualize the position of Gypsies and <b>Travellers</b> in England and Wales in late modern society before going on to address their governance. The article will identify how community policing initiatives have developed in work with Gypsies and <b>Travellers.</b> It will then go on to show that the majority of Gypsies and <b>Travellers</b> experience policing through enforcement, 367 - 390 CRJ- 082062. qxd 4 / 10 / 07 1 : 56 PM Page 36...|$|R

5|$|Porter {{edited the}} Constellation, a {{newspaper}} in New York City that published humorous stories. Porter became interested in sports, and concentrated on the emerging sports journalism field. In December 1831, Porter published {{the first issue of}} a new newspaper devoted to covering sports and other recreational activities, which he called The Spirit of the Times. Porter imitated Bell's Life in London, a contemporary English publication covering the same subjects. The first attempt at Spirit of the Times failed quickly, and Porter sold the magazine to C. J. B. Fisher, who merged it into Fisher's publication of the <b>Traveller,</b> and the Spirit was combined with the <b>Traveller</b> as the <b>Traveller</b> and Spirit of the Times. During the brief period that Porter operated the Spirit, he employed Horace Greeley as a typesetter. When Porter sold the Spirit, he then went to work at the New-Yorker, which was edited at the time by Horace Greeley. In January 1835 Porter purchased the <b>Traveller</b> and Spirit of the Times and renamed the newspaper back to Spirit of the Times, returning to editing it. This version of the Spirit managed to survive, although with some initial financial difficulties. Porter focused on selling his paper in the south and west of the United States, and emphasized subjects of use to his readers, such as cattle breeding, farm methods, books of interest, as well as sports. The newspaper was published weekly.|$|E
