5|$|Extant bats of Puerto Rico {{belong to}} five {{families}} (Noctilionidae, Mormoopidae, Phyllostomidae, Vespertilionidae, and Molossidae) {{and include a}} total of 13 species, of which six subspecies are endemic to the archipelago. Seven of the 13 species are insectivores, four can be considered frugivores, one species feeds on nectar and another on fish. The species total is a relatively low number {{in comparison to the}} other Greater Antilles. Jamaica, for example, with an area approximately 1.2 <b>times</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> Puerto Rico, has 21 species (1.6 <b>times</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> Puerto Rico). A possible explanation for this is the comparatively large distance between the archipelago and the mainland dispersion areas. Jamaica, for example, is closer to Cuba and Hispaniola which are themselves closer to the mainland dispersion areas of North and Central America.|$|E

5|$|The thermal {{conductivity}} of heliumII {{is greater than}} that of any other known substance, a million <b>times</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> heliumI and several hundred <b>times</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> copper.

HeliumII has no such valence band but nevertheless conducts heat well. The flow of heat is governed by equations that are similar to the wave equation used to characterize sound propagation in air. When heat is introduced, it moves at 20 meters per second at 1.8K through heliumII as waves in a phenomenon known as second sound.|$|E
