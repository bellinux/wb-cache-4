5|$|Wind {{is another}} {{resource}} that Wales has in abundance. The Gwynt y Môr {{is one of}} several offshore wind farms off the coast of North Wales and Anglesey, and is the second largest such wind farm in the world. Other wind farms are found on inland, mostly upland sites, but <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>none</b> in the Snowdonia and Brecon Beacons national parks.|$|E
5|$|The six {{pieces of}} painted Italian maiolica, or painted and tin-glazed earthenware, are all {{larger than the}} average, and <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>none</b> of the dishes that {{are the most common}} maiolica shape. The {{earliest}} piece is a large statue of Fortuna standing on a dolphin, holding a sail, by Giovanni della Robbia, made in Florence about 1500–10. This is a rare representative of the Early to High Italian Renaissance in the bequest.|$|E

5|$|As they {{continue}} walking, SpongeBob constantly sings {{a song about}} how the Krusty Krab pizza is the best pizza on the sea floor, which annoys Squidward. The two gradually become tired and hungry, so SpongeBob suggests they eat coral like the pioneers. Squidward immediately spits out the coral, disgusted by the taste, and demands SpongeBob hand over the pizza so he can eat it, having finally given up hope on getting back to civilization. SpongeBob refuses and a short chase ensues between the two. Just as Squidward is about to grab the pizza, SpongeBob notices a giant rock that he claims the pioneers drove for miles. Incredulous at this claim, Squidward tries to tell SpongeBob {{to forget about the}} pioneers, saying that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>none</b> left because of their unusual travelling methods. He quickly changes his mind after SpongeBob runs him over with the rock and they drive {{it all the way to}} the customer's house.|$|E

The kitchen wing to the north was placed asymmetrically, to highlight its difference in function.|$|E
25|$|West, for his part, cites a known {{software}} {{issue with}} phones like Hedgepeth's {{that resulted in}} inaccurate timestamps. He discounts the background sound as being music, since his analysis did not produce any sounds like percussion, a heavy bass or synthesizers.

5000|$|Sixth Dynasty (2345-2181 BCE) tomb artwork in Egypt {{has been}} {{thought to be}} the oldest {{documentary}} evidence of circumcision, the most ancient depiction being a bas-relief from the necropolis at Saqqara (c. 2400 BCE) with the inscriptions reading: [...] "The ointment is to make it acceptable." [...] and [...] "Hold him so that he does not fall". In the oldest written account, by an Egyptian named Uha, in the 23rd century BCE, he describes a mass circumcision and boasts of his ability to stoically endure the pain: [...] "When I was circumcised, together with one hundred and twenty men ... <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>none</b> thereof who hit out, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>none</b> thereof who <b>was</b> hit, and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>none</b> thereof who scratched and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>none</b> thereof who <b>was</b> scratched." ...|$|R

25|$|Rods cannot {{distinguish}} colours, but {{are responsible}} for low-light (scotopic) monochrome (black-and-white) vision; they work well in dim light as they contain a pigment, rhodopsin (visual purple), which is sensitive at low light intensity, but saturates at higher (photopic) intensities. Rods are distributed throughout the retina but <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>none</b> at the fovea and none at the blind spot. Rod density is greater in the peripheral retina than in the central retina.|$|E
25|$|The {{children}} {{find out}} that in Constance’s time they kill seals for their oil. They become angered by this because this is why <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>none</b> left in their time.

Mandy finds a sick seal pup and decided the only way to save the pup is to take it through the mirror, but trouble ensues.|$|E
25|$|In {{the overall}} population, a slight {{majority}} of melanomas do not form in an existing mole, but rather create a new growth on the skin. Somewhat surprisingly, this also applies to those with dysplastic nevi. They are at {{a higher risk of}} melanoma occurring not only where there is an existing mole, but also where <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>none.</b> Such persons need to be checked regularly for any changes in their moles and to note any new ones.|$|E

25|$|Meno now beseeches Socrates {{to return}} to the {{original}} question, how virtue is acquired, and in particular, {{whether or not it is}} acquired by teaching or through life experience. Socrates proceeds on the hypothesis that virtue is knowledge, and it is quickly agreed that, if this is true, virtue is teachable. They turn to the question of whether virtue is indeed knowledge. Socrates is hesitant, because, if virtue were knowledge, there should be teachers and learners of it, but <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>none.</b>|$|E
25|$|West Texas {{receives}} {{much less}} rainfall {{than the rest}} of Texas and has an arid or semiarid climate, requiring most of its scant agriculture to be heavily dependent on irrigation. This irrigation, and water taken out farther north for the needs of El Paso and Juarez, Mexico, has reduced the once mighty Rio Grande to a stream in some places, even dry at times. Much of West Texas has rugged terrain, including many small mountain ranges while <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>none</b> {{in other parts of the}} state.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{his lack}} of schooling, Sequoyah {{displayed}} {{a good deal of}} natural intelligence. As a child, he had devised and built milk troughs and skimmers for the dairy house that he had constructed. As he grew older and came in contact with more white men, he learned how to make jewelry. He became a noted silversmith, creating various items from the silver coins that trappers and traders carried. He never signed his pieces, so <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>none</b> that can be positively identified as his work.|$|E
