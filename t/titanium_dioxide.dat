Substrate dipping in a {{composite}} sol-gel solution {{was used to}} prepare smooth and rough thin films of <b>titanium</b> <b>dioxides</b> (TiO 2) on porous silicon (PS) and conductor glass.

The {{results show that the}} optical and electrical properties of the structures strongly depend on the deposition conditions of TiO 2. In addition, the band gap energy Eg and refractive index of the structure can be easily varied depending on TiO 2 thicknesses and calcination temperatures.

40|$|TiO 2 {{has been}} widely applied as white artistic pigment since 19 th century. And the photo-catalytic effect of TiO 2 makes it {{aggressive}} and causes degradation on painting surface. The damage of binder by TiO 2, also known as chalking, has been suggested as {{the main cause of}} the painting surface degradation and studied a lot. However, the danger to pigments used with TiO 2 together, especially the organic ones, is rarely noticed. In this study, artistic TiO 2 and industrial TiO 2 were studied: a Titanium white pigment from Kremer, industrial catalyst from Hombikat and Hombikat coated with Al 2 O 3 in an atomic layer deposition process. The <b>titanium</b> <b>dioxides</b> were mixed with five colorant pigments and linseed oil into paints. After drying, the paint films were illuminated under artificial light to reveal the surface change caused by TiO 2. After artificial light aging, the color, gloss and roughness of all films have changed. As expected, Hombikat TiO 2 is proved to induce most changes. The Hombikat TiO 2 degrades the binder and the colorant pigments in combination with light. The coating of Hombikat with Al 2 O 3 shows little effectiveness in preventing the degradation. The Kremer TiO 2 mainly degrades the binder to cause surface change. The degradation of the binder contributes to the roughness increase mostly.

The <b>titanium</b> <b>dioxides,</b> including several mesoporous structures were prepared by different synthesis procedures. The mesoporous TiO 2 synthesized using evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA) method exhibited the highest surface area (217.14  m 2 /g). The successful loading of the active manganese component (2  %) to TiO 2 supports showed high dispersion of MnO x [...] species in amorphous state. Characterizations of XRD, N 2 adsorption–desorption, pore size distributions, TEM, H 2 -TPR and XPS were applied to contrast their structure properties and correlated with the corresponding catalytic performance. The Mn/EISA exhibited the highest catalytic activity among the series of Mn/TiO 2 catalysts, which could completely oxidize CO into CO 2 at temperature as low as 270  oC, due to its highly ordered mesoporous channels, which effectively enlarge the surface area leading to promoting a strong interaction between MnO x [...] species (68  % Mn 3 +) and TiO 2 support.|$|R
40|$|Bare <b>titanium</b> <b>dioxides</b> (TiO₂) and doped {{with metal}} (Cu) or {{non-metal}} ion (F) were synthesized by a single-step flame spray pyrolysis (FSP) method. According to the BET, XRD, and TEM results, the Cu- and F-doped TiO₂ nanoparticles synthesized by FSP possess comparable features {{in terms of}} surface area, crystallite size and phase composition, and morphology. However, the F-doped TiO₂ exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity for the complete oxidation of acetaldehyde (ACE) even surpassing benchmarking Aeroxide TiO₂ (P 25). In contrast, Cu-doped TiO₂ had a detrimental effect on the ACE photocatalytic oxidation. The proportion of native terminal hydroxyl groups, evaluated using high-field ¹H MAS NMR, on the particle surface was varied by doping the TiO₂ with either Cu or F ions during FSP synthesis. A relationship, whereby decreased terminal hydroxyl group content corresponded to elevated acetaldehyde photodegradation, was subsequently uncovered.

40|$|Utilization of {{inorganic}} reducing agents, such as Fe(II) and sulfide for Cr(VI) reduction {{would result}} {{in an increase in}} solid waste production and subsequent treatment cost. Rapid decrease in Cr(VI) concentrations and less solid by-products are valuable in the remediation of Cr(VI) contamination. The enhancement of Cr(VI) reduction by organic compounds with activated surfaces allows us not only efficient uses of natural materials but also decrease of processing products. The experiments of this work were all conducted under the light in visible wavelength region. <b>Titanium</b> <b>dioxides</b> (TiO 2) could accelerate Cr(VI) reduction by citrate; however, illumination was necessary to initiate the redox reaction.

When develop remediation techniques for Cr(VI) contamination, natural sunlight or a cheaper light source (i. e., fluorescent light) can be used, instead of UV light which is often used in the current techniques of treatments of soil and water contamination.

40|$|The {{adsorption}} {{of hydrogen}} chloride and water vapors on five TiO 2 powders {{in both the}} anatase and rutile crystalline forms was studied {{as a function of}} temperature, pressure, and outgas conditions. The adsorbents were characterized utilizing X-ray powder diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, surface area analysis, indicator method, microelectrophoresis, XPS, and infrared spectroscopy. It was found that both outgas temperature and adsorption temperature influenced the adsorption of water vapor on TiO 2, while water vapor adsorption on TiO 2 was completely reversible. It is argued that the number of hydroxyl groups present on the surface determines the adsorption capacity of water on the different <b>titanium</b> <b>dioxides.</b> It was found that heats of immersion in water were affected significantly by outgas temperature. Hydrogen chloride adsorption isotherms at 30 C measured on TiO 2 after outgassing at 100 - 400 C showed that a part of the total HCl adsorbed was irreversibly adsorbed.

30|$|The {{photocatalytic}} {{activity of}} <b>titanium</b> <b>dioxides</b> was studied by exposing the TiO 2 sample, which contained a dye such as MB, to solar-like conditions. For photocatalytic reactions, the irradiation {{was carried out}} in a solution at 308 K, using a SOL 21500 lamp (SOL, Inc., Palm City, FL, USA). The SOL bulb yields a spectrum very {{similar to that of the}} natural sunlight ranging from ultraviolet to infrared radiation (approximately 295 to 3, 000 nm). For this purpose, an aqueous solution (0.05 % w/v) of reagent-grade MB was prepared for the impregnation of reference and synthesized TiO 2. The same amount (0.5 g) of each TiO 2 sample was inserted under very mild stirring in the same amount of solution (50 ml) and remained there for 2 to 3 min to complete the mixing. The solution was then placed under the solar-like light (50 to 60 mW/cm 2). Continuous stirring (200 rpm) and natural air flow (50 ml/min, 20 vol.% oxygen) were maintained during the photocatalytic reaction. The gas was passed underneath the reactor using a porous filter media (mesh size, 200), which dissipates the gas molecules (0.027 g O 2 min− 1 g− 1 TiO 2) to the MB solution. The photocatalytic decomposition reaction was monitored with an ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) spectrophotometer (UV- 1650, Shimadzu Corporation, Nakagyo-ku, Kyoto, Japan) in the transmission mode by investigating the evolution of the absorbed MB band upon light exposure.|$|R

Especially in dentistry the interaction between biomaterials like implant materials and the soft tissue in the oral cavity is in the focus of daily research. In this context the high importance of testing materials and their surfaces concerning their biocompatibility towards corresponding cells is very likely. For this purpose this study investigates cells derived from human gingival biopsies on different materials and surfaces. Methods: Cells {{in this study were}} cultivated out of human biopsies by a grow out explant technique and were sub cultivated on <b>titanium,</b> zirconium <b>dioxide</b> and collagen membrane specimens. To characterise the cells on the material surfaces used in this study immunohistochemical and histological staining techniques as well as different methods of microscopy (light microscopy and SEM) were applied. Results: With the aid of the explant technique and the chosen cell cultivation method it was possible to investigate the human gingiva derived cells on different materials. The data of the present study show that the human gingival cells attach and proliferate on all three tested materials by exhibiting characteristic gingival keratinocyte protein expression even after long periods of culture e. g. up to 70 days.

40|$|Detailed {{information}} on trace-element modes of occurrence in coal {{is essential to}} understanding and predicting trace-element transformations taking place during coal combustion. The USGS has developed quantitative and semi-quantitative methods for determining the mode of occurrence of trace elements in coal. This information is needed to generate predictive models for trace-element behavior, {{the ultimate goal of}} this integrated study. While the USGS has a relatively small part of the overall study, the results have direct bearing on the predictive equations being developed as the primary product of this program. The USGS procedure uses an iterative selective leaching protocol on whole coals in combination with a range of complementary studies. The sequence of leaching steps, and the intended results, are as follows: (1) exchangeable cations, and a fraction of the carbonate-hosted cations are removed by ammonium acetate; (2) cations primarily associated with carbonates and monosulfides such as galena, sphalerite and chalcopyrite are removed by hydrochloric acid; (3) silicate-associated cations are removed by hydrofluoric acid; and (4) elements associated with di-sulfides (pyrite and marcasite) are removed by nitric acid. The amount of an element leached by a given reagent is compared to concentrations of that element in the whole coal to obtain the fraction of an element having the indicated residence. Elements not leached by any of the four reagents may be present in the organic portions of the coal, or in insoluble phases such as zircon or <b>titanium</b> <b>dioxides.</b> Additionally, where mineral grains are completely encased by the organic matrix, these ''shielded'' grains may not be completely digested.
