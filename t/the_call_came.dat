5|$|USMC Col. Al Gray {{suggested}} a covert, land-based rescue operation. and Lt. Col. Andy Anderson, Commander of the Joint Personnel Recovery Center (JPRC, MACVSOG-80) ordered a ground rescue. In Saigon, Navy SEAL Lt. Thomas R. Norris, {{one of just}} three SEAL officers and nine enlisted men remaining in Vietnam, had just completed an assignment in the Mekong Delta. He was waiting for orders when <b>the</b> <b>call</b> <b>came</b> in for a commando operation to get Hambleton out. Norris was immediately dispatched to lead an operation to rescue Hambleton. He recruited five Vietnamese Sea Commando frogmen from the Lien Doc Nguoi Nhia (LDNN), Naval Advisory Detachment (NAD) in Da Nang.|$|E
25|$|Bowie County Sheriff W. H. Presley, {{leader of}} the investigation, was with his old friend Texas City Police Chief Jack N. Runnels when <b>the</b> <b>call</b> <b>came</b> in and they sped to the scene. They {{immediately}} launched a citywide investigation along with the Texas and Arkansas city police, the Department of Public Safety, Miller and Cass County sheriffs' departments and the FBI. No money was found on Griffin, nor was any found in Moore's purse. Family members claimed {{that they did not}} carry much money with them. By Monday morning, the Texas Rangers were called in.|$|E
25|$|This province, as a British colony, {{fought against}} the French during King George's War. The {{assembly}} was determined to control expenditures for this war and only weak support was given. When <b>the</b> <b>call</b> <b>came</b> for New York to help raise an expeditionary force against Louisburg, the New York assembly refused to raise troops and only appropriated a token three thousand pounds. The assembly was opposed to a significant war effort because it would interrupt trade with Quebec and would result in higher taxes. The French raid on Saratoga in 1745 destroyed that settlement, killing and capturing {{more than one hundred}} people. After this attack the assembly was more generous and raised 1,600 men and forty thousand pounds.|$|E

25|$|Mobbing {{calls are}} signals {{made by the}} mobbing species while harassing a predator. These differ from alarm calls, which allow con-specifics {{to escape from the}} predator. The great tit, a European songbird, uses such a signal to call on nearby birds to harass a perched bird of prey, such as an owl. This call occurs in the 4.5kHz range, and carries over long distances. However, when prey species are in flight, they employ an alarm signal in the 7–8kHz range. This call is less {{effective}} at traveling great distances, but is much more difficult for both owls and hawks to hear (and detect the direction from which <b>the</b> <b>call</b> <b>came).</b> In the case of the alarm call, it could be disadvantageous to the sender if the predator picks up on the signal, hence selection has favored those birds able to hear and employ calls in this higher frequency range.|$|E
500|$|Sultan Iskandar's public call {{to support}} Abdullah Badawi's {{administration}} in October 2006 created a minor stir among Mahathir's supporters, when he remarked that [...] "Mahathir should {{act like a}} pensioner". <b>The</b> <b>call</b> <b>came</b> {{at a time when}} Mahathir's spate of criticisms against Abdullah's were at its most vociferous period. The Sultan was the first state ruler to publicly defend the policy of the government during the period of Mahathir's criticisms against the Abdullah administration. Earlier sources however, noted Sultan Iskandar's concerns with the deepening rift between Mahathir and Abdullah and had asked to be photographed together with the two leaders during the United Malays National Organisations (UMNO) 60th anniversary celebrations in Johor Bahru.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} originally appeared for two episodes on 2 and 3 August2007, {{and then}} returned for four episodes between 7 and 11 January2008. Franks was asked to return again later in 2008 but could not make it, so Franks thought Rainie would not be seen again. She returned for the longer stint in 2010, starting on 3August. Franks {{did not expect to}} be asked to return in 2010, and said <b>the</b> <b>call</b> <b>came</b> as a surprise. She said it was [...] "ideal" [...] because it fitted in with another acting job she was undertaking at the time. She commented that Rainie would be [...] "unlikely to return without stirring up a bit of trouble". Rainie returned again on 12April2011 as a regular character, for Tanya's wedding to Greg Jessop, along with Tanya and Rainie's mother Cora, where Cora tries to build bridges between the sisters.|$|E

500|$|By lap 45, Vettel and Rosberg {{encountered}} backmarkers on track, {{which allowed}} Rosberg to {{move closer to}} his compatriot, trailing him by less than three seconds. On lap 49, Mercedes told Hamilton to increase his speed, without giving the driver an explanation. With Hamilton leading Vettel by 23 seconds, <b>the</b> <b>call</b> <b>came</b> unexpected. It later proved {{to be caused by}} the fact that Hamilton's left rear tyre had too little pressure at the start, leading the team to fear for a time penalty after the race. Fernando Alonso retired from the race on lap 50 due to loss of power. One lap later, Räikkönen moved into sixth place by overtaking the Force India of Sergio Pérez. With one lap to go, Rosberg was moving ever closer to Vettel in front, when his engine failed, forcing him to retire, handing Felipe Massa the final spot on the podium, who defended the position from teammate Bottas over the final lap. Lewis Hamilton finished the race to take victory on what he himself described as [...] "the best [...] I've ever driven". He finished more than 25 seconds ahead of Vettel.|$|E
500|$|Specific types: alarm; contact; duet; antiphonal duetting; food begging; flight; mobbing. A type of bird vocalization {{tending to}} serve such {{functions}} as giving alarm or keeping {{members of a}} flock in contact—as opposed to a bird's , which is longer and more complex and is usually associated with courtship and mating. Individual birds may be sensitive enough to identify each other through their calls. Many birds that nest in colonies can locate their chicks using their calls. Alarm calls are used to sound alarm to other individuals. Food-begging calls are made by baby birds to beg for food, such as the [...] "wah" [...] of infant blue jays. Mobbing calls signal other individuals in mobbing species while harassing a predator. They differ from alarm calls, which alert other species members to allow escape from predators. As an example, the great tit, a European songbird, uses such a signal to call on nearby birds to harass a perched bird of prey, such as an owl. This call occurs in the 4.5kHz range, and carries over long distances. However, when such prey species are in flight, they employ an alarm signal in the 7–8kHz range. This call is less effective at traveling great distances, but {{is much more difficult}} for both owls and hawks to hear (and detect the direction from which <b>the</b> <b>call</b> <b>came).</b> Contact calls are used by birds for the purpose of letting others of their species know their location. Relatedly, flight calls are vocalizations made by birds while flying, which often serve to keep flocks together. These calls are also used for when birds want to alert others that they are taking flight. Many birds engage in duet calls—a call made by two birds at or nearly at the same time. In some cases, the duets are so perfectly timed as to appear almost as one call. This kind of calling is termed antiphonal duetting. Such duetting is noted {{in a wide range of}} families including quails, bushshrikes, babblers such as [...] scimitar babblers and some owls and parrots.|$|E

2500|$|In the huddle, the Giants were incredulous when <b>the</b> <b>call</b> <b>came</b> in. [...] "Don't {{give me the}} ball", begged fullback Larry Csonka, {{the former}} Dolphins star. Other players asked Pisarcik to change the play, but he demurred. Gibson had berated him for {{changing}} a play the week before and threatened to have him waived if he ever did so again. Gibson {{did not take the}} time to explain his decision to Pisarcik. As a result, the rest of the offense simply viewed Gibson's call as a power trip. Because he was a second-year starting quarterback who still had not totally proven himself, in the era before free agency, Pisarcik lacked the stature to prevail in this kind of dispute.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the night}} of November 26, 1943, the Enterprise {{introduced}} the experiment in the co-operative control of Avengers and Hellcats for night fighting, when the three-plane team from the ship broke up {{a large group of}} land-based bombers attacking Task Group TG 50.2. O'Hare volunteered to lead this mission to conduct the first-ever Navy nighttime fighter attack from an aircraft carrier to intercept a large force of enemy torpedo bombers. When <b>the</b> <b>call</b> <b>came</b> to man the fighters, Butch O'Hare was eating. He grabbed up part of his supper in his fist and started running for the ready room. He was dressed in loose marine coveralls. The night fighter unit consisting of 1 VT and 2 VF was catapulted between 17:58 and 18:01. The pilots for this flight were Butch O'Hare and Ensign Warren Andrew [...] "Andy" [...] Skon of VF-2 in F6Fs and the Squadron Commander of VT-6, LCDR John C. Phillips in a TBF1-C. The crew of the TBF torpedo plane consisted of LTJG Hazen B. Rand, a radar specialist and Alvin Kernan, A. B., AOM1/c. The 'Black Panthers', as the night fighters were dubbed, took off before dusk and flew out into the incoming mass of Japanese planes.|$|E

2500|$|Burton {{tried to}} steer a course {{down the middle}} of all the {{competing}} interests. Like a majority in the state, he was strongly sympathetic towards the South, and a strong opponent of abolition, but he opposed Delaware’s possible secession. A delegation led by Mississippi Judge Henry Dickinson came from the Confederacy to attempt to persuade the General Assembly to enact secession, but the suggestion was rejected, and Delaware remained firmly in the Union. Meanwhile factions of armed supporters of both sides gathered arms and trained. Burton asked the groups favoring the South to disarm, but later withdrew the request. At the same time he appointed adjutant general and DuPont company president, Henry du Pont, to lead the state militia. du Pont was more decisive, and saw that when additional arms were secured from the federal government, they were directed toward loyal militia, and that the all-important powder mills of his company were properly protected. Du Pont would end up supplying over half the gunpowder used by the Union armies. When <b>the</b> <b>call</b> <b>came</b> for soldiers for the federal army, Burton again compromised by refusing to turn over the Delaware militia, or to pay for bounties, but did encourage enlistment. In fact, support for the Union was so strong that Delaware had a larger number of soldiers per size of population than any other state. This fact prompted U.S. President Abraham Lincoln to remark that “South of the Mason-Dixon line, noble little Delaware led off right from the first.” ...|$|E
