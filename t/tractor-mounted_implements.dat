50|$|There {{are four}} general types of harrows: disc harrows, tine harrows (including spring-tooth harrows, drag harrows, and spike harrows), chain harrows, and chain-disk harrows. Harrows were {{originally}} drawn by draft animals, such as horses, mules, or oxen, {{or in some}} times and places by manual labourers. In modern practice they are almost always <b>tractor-mounted</b> <b>implements,</b> either trailed after the tractor by a drawbar or mounted on the three-point hitch.|$|E
40|$|A {{survey was}} {{conducted}} from 50 randomly selected rice growers from 25 villages of Dera Ismail Khan, NWFP, Pakistan. The survey report revealed that 96 percent rice growers planted well-adapted high yielding coarse rice variety IR- 6. All the farmers followed recommendations regarding land preparation using tractor and <b>tractor-mounted</b> <b>implements.</b> Half of the population used their self-produced seed, which was kept under profaned conditions. Majority of the farmers raised rice nursery {{during the month of}} April to mainly escape from the attack of rice stem borer. More than half (56 %) used optimal age (30 - 40 -days-old) rice nursery. Almost all the population (96 %) used transplanting method but none of them used the line method of transplantation. Although, a big fraction (36 %) of the sampled population was illiterate, yet all were applying recommended doses of fertilizers. Similarly, most of the growers (70 %) were impelled to apply canal water at 4 - 8 days interval according to the water schedule given by the Revenue department. Majority of the population reported weeds and pest (stem borer) in rice crop. The per hectare rice yield of the farmers interviewed, although, exceeds the national average rice yield but none of the growers could fully exploit the potential yield of the cultivar. The frequency of the sampled population for getting information from nearby growers was very high mainly due to uncertain and insufficient knowledge provided by the other sources. Fifty-four percent of the farmers needed loan for the purchase of fertilizers, insecticides etc for rice crop and thirty-two percent declared banks as the suitable source of credit. Water shortage, high costs of inputs, non-availability of skilled labour during peak planting season, sub-optimal plant population, weeds and pest infestation, high dependence of knowledge on nearby growers and low price of rice in the local market were the major restrictions in higher yields of rice in Dera Ismail Khan, NWFP, Pakista...|$|E
50|$|The typical early horse-drawn {{hay rake}} was a dump rake, a wide two-wheeled {{implement}} with curved steel or iron teeth usually operated from a seat mounted over the rake with a lever-operated lifting mechanism. This rake gathered cut hay into windrows by repeated operation {{perpendicular to the}} windrow, requiring the operator to raise the rake, turn around and drop the teeth to rake {{back and forth in}} order to form the windrow. In some areas, a sweep rake, which could also be a horse-drawn or <b>tractor-mounted</b> <b>implement,</b> could then be used to pick up the windrowed hay and load it onto a wagon.|$|R
50|$|A {{subsoiler}} or flat lifter is a <b>tractor-mounted</b> farm <b>implement</b> {{used for}} deep tillage, loosening and breaking up soil at depths below the levels worked by moldboard ploughs, disc harrows, or rototillers. Most such tools will break up and turn over surface soil {{to a depth}} of 15-20 cm (6-8 in), whereas a subsoiler will break up and loosen soil to twice those depths. Typically a subsoiler mounted on a compact utility tractor will reach depths of about 30 cm (12 in) and typically have only one thin blade with a sharpened tip.|$|R
40|$|Two {{mathematical}} models describing {{one-dimensional flow}} from buried sources and in unsaturated soils were developed. One considered {{the consumption of}} water by roots. For the assumed distribution of the root consumption with time and depth, the 10 cm (4 -in.) deep source provided better water distribution than did 20 - and 30 -cm (8 - and 12 -in.) deep sources. Irrigation from zero depth, {{as in the case}} of trickle irrigation, appeared to be the best system for the given conditions. Plugging of emitters by particulate materials decreased as the cross-sectional area of the emitter opening was increased. Less than 0. 06 atm (1 psig) vacuum had little effect on the flow of emitters tested. Higher vacuum amounts caused the reopening of plugged orifice emitters, but caused plugging of labyrinth emitters. Vacuum-induced plugging of labyrinth emitters resulted from accumulation of silt and fine sand within the flow path. Operation at higher pressures caused limited flow recovery. A theory was proposed for determining pressure distributions in drip laterals where water is uniformly distributed along the lateral's length. The theory provided acceptable design in two tests. Computer-derived design curves were developed. Because 1000 or more emitters may be required for subirrigation of eachacre, emitters need to be both inexpensive and resistant to plugging. Four experimental emitters were designed and constructed. A modification of one microtube emitter is being produced commercially. Two moveable drip systems were proposed. Drip irrigation lines successfully trailed a center-pivot irrigation system. Also a <b>tractor-mounted</b> <b>implement</b> was developed for moving individual drip irrigation laterals...|$|R
