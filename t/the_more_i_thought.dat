2500|$|The Bulldogs {{left the}} WWF in 1988, {{in part due}} to {{backstage}} problems between the Bulldogs, specifically the Dynamite Kid, and the Rougeau Brothers over a prank pulled by Curt Hennig. The Bulldogs, noted ribbers (pranksters) in their own right, were blamed for the prank, leading to a series of confrontations that culminated in Jacques Rougeau knocking out four of the Dynamite Kid's teeth with a fist filled with a roll of quarters. Though there are various accounts of this situation, many suggest that Billington drew first blood by bullying Rougeau (among many others including The Honky Tonk Man, whom Dynamite, allegedly, brought to tears) in Miami. While Rougeau was playing cards backstage, from behind, Billington smacked Jacques in the ear and then punched and kicked him in the face several times and also struck Raymond, who was on crutches at the time. It was weeks before Jacques responded. Bret Hart wrote about the incident, in his book HITMAN: My Real Life in the Cartoon World of Wrestling: [...] "At first I was upset, and contemplated getting involved. But <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> about it the more I realized that Tom had been asking for this for years and that everyone who'd been bullied by him would rejoice at the news." [...] After no disciplinary action was taken against Jacques, Billington quit the WWF, and Smith followed suit.|$|E

She had the most delightful little voice, the gayest little laugh, the pleasantest and most fascinating little ways, that ever led a lost youth into hopeless slavery.

6000|$|... 147. Then began I with sad {{and careful}} heart to {{consider}} {{of the nature}} and largeness of my sin, and to search into the word of God, if I could in any place espy a word of promise, or any encouraging sentence, by which I might take relief. Wherefore I began to consider that of Mark iii. 28: All sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme. Which place, methought at a blush, did contain a large and glorious promise for the pardon of high offences; but considering <b>the</b> place <b>more</b> fully, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> it was rather to be understood, as relating more chiefly to those who had, while in a natural estate, committed such things as there are mentioned; but not to me, who had not only received light and mercy, but that had both after, and also contrary to that, so slighted Christ as I had done.|$|R
6000|$|Getting tired, I {{asked to}} be shown the house that was {{prepared}} for me, but the only reply I could get was, [...] "Wait a little," [...] and the parties went on talking as before. So I told them I could not wait, as I {{wanted to see the}} house and then to go shooting in the forest. This seemed to puzzle them, and at length, in answer to questions, very poorly explained by one or two bystanders who knew a little Malay, it came out that no house was ready, and no one seemed to have the least idea where to get one. As I did not want to trouble <b>the</b> Rajah any <b>more,</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> it best to try to frighten them a little; so I told them that if they did not immediately find me a house as the Rajah had ordered, I should go back and complain to him, but that if a house was found me I would pay for the use of it. This had the desired effect, and one of the head men of the village asked me to go with him and look for a house. He showed me {{one or two of the}} most miserable and ruinous description, which I at once rejected, saying, [...] "I must have a good one, and near to the forest." [...] The next he showed me suited very well, so I told him to see that it was emptied the next day, for that the day after I should come and occupy it.|$|R
6000|$|Later on in {{that year}} the women began a new attack. Day and night, and all through the long nights of the Budget sittings, at all the piers of the gates of New Palace Yard and at St. Stephen's Porch, stood women pickets, and watched us silently and reproachfully as we went to and fro. They were women of all sorts, though, of course, the {{independent}} worker-class predominated. There were grey-headed old ladies standing there, sturdily charming in the rain; battered-looking, ambiguous women, with something of the desperate bitterness of battered women showing in their eyes; north-country factory girls; cheaply-dressed suburban women; trim, comfortable mothers of families; valiant-eyed girl graduates and undergraduates; lank, hungry-looking creatures, who stirred one's imagination; one very dainty little woman in deep mourning, I recall, grave and steadfast, with eyes fixed on distant things. Some of those women looked defiant, some timidly aggressive, some full of the stir of adventure, some drooping with cold and fatigue. The supply never ceased. I had a mortal fear that somehow the supply might halt or cease. I found that continual siege of the legislature extraordinarily impressive--infinitely <b>more</b> impressive than <b>the</b> feeble-forcible [...] "ragging" [...] of <b>the</b> <b>more</b> militant section. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> of the appeal that must be going through the country, summoning the women from countless scattered homes, rooms, colleges, to Westminster.|$|R

60|$|Somehow {{or other}} this {{paragraph}} fascinated me. I read {{it over and}} over again.

40|$|This {{issue is}} tinged with some sadness {{as a result}} of the {{accident}} suffered by our President, Rina Hershkowitz, in January. I am sure everyone in PME wishes her a full recovery. This Newsletter brings detailed information of the programme and activities at PME 28 in Bergen – which looks like being a stimulating conference in many ways. The local organisers have worked hard to organise a particularly broad and thought provoking set of activities, which fit with the conference themes of Inclusion and Diversity. This will be a good opportunity for a really challenging experience in a country that has a rich cultural history. I hope this issue of the Newsletter will be of great interest to PME members, and I welcome any feedback or ideas you might have. This will be my final issue as Editor of PME News. From the next newsletter, the new editor will be Mamokgethi Setati. Curiously, I have enjoyed doing <b>the</b> newsletter <b>more</b> than <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> would and hope I have introduced some elements that members appreciate. I am sure Mamokgethi will continue this and I look forward now to receiving future issues of PME News, with eager expectation. See you all in Bergen I hope.

Even if I had about a {{thousand}} hours it would be the same, I’d love it all <b>the</b> <b>more.</b> And that’s <b>the</b> way with you darling; every time I see you, every time I kiss you, I love you all <b>the</b> <b>more.</b> <b>I</b> never <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> could love anyone as much as I love you, my darling. There’s only one trouble, I see too much of flying, and not enough of you. It’s snowing like hell up here now, it looks like it’s going to stick, too. I hope we have a white Christmas. I can’t remember one Christmas on which it’s been snowing on which (man—what grammar) I flew this afternoon for an hour and forty minutes, that leaves me just forty-five minutes to go, I ought to finish that tomorrow, if the snow’s not too bad. We’ve got our C. O. working on the delay en route now. He’s royally P. O. ’d about the deal we’ve been getting, ‘cause Cochran Field got delays, so maybe he’ll get results. He should, he’s a Colonel. If we can get it, that will give me about seven days. You know hon, we’ve only had one whole day together, and that was spent rushing around New York. If I get a lot of time, I’d like to go horseback riding sometime, or would it be too cold? With Ace home, I guess a horse is all I could have to get around on. That will rally cramp my style. I wonder if they have any two seaters, with a heater and a radio, huh? Honey, are you going to wait until after Christmas to get a job? I wish you would because if I do get some time off you wouldn’t have to work, and also I think you should take it easy, and log some sack time (solo!) for a couple of days, after I leave. And hon, go to the doctor’s this week, please. There’s nothing wrong with you of course darling, but a check-up now and then never hurts. You’re very sweet darling, I love you. I love you in a way that I can never describe. Like I love anything beautiful, anything sweet. You’re everything I’ve ever wanted, Dottie. I’m the luckiest guy in the world. I love you— All my LoveJudd P. S. —I gave Ruth the $ 2. 00. —I love you. [Transcription ends...|$|R
