5|$|For the Internet, the {{physical}} medium and {{data link protocol}} can vary several times as packets traverse the globe. This is because the Internet places no constraints on what physical medium or data link protocol is used. <b>This</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> adoption of media and protocols that best suit the local network situation. In practice, most intercontinental communication will use the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) protocol (or a modern equivalent) on top of optic fiber. This is because for most intercontinental communication the Internet shares the same infrastructure as the public switched telephone network.|$|E

5|$|In around 1 {{percent of}} infections, {{poliovirus}} spreads along certain nerve fiber pathways, preferentially replicating in and destroying motor neurons within the spinal cord, brain stem, or motor cortex. <b>This</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> development of paralytic poliomyelitis, {{the various forms}} of which (spinal, bulbar, and bulbospinal) vary only with the amount of neuronal damage and inflammation that occurs, and the region of the CNS affected.|$|E
5|$|After small planetesimals—about 1km in diameter—have {{formed by}} {{one way or}} another, runaway {{accretion}} begins. It is called runaway because the mass growth rate is proportional to , where R and M are the radius and mass of the growing body, respectively. It {{is obvious that the}} specific (divided by mass) growth accelerates as the mass increases. <b>This</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> preferential growth of larger bodies at the expense of smaller ones. The runaway accretion lasts between 10,000 and 100,000years and ends when the largest bodies exceed approximately 1,000km in diameter. Slowing of the accretion is caused by gravitational perturbations by large bodies on the remaining planetesimals. In addition, the influence of larger bodies stops further growth of smaller bodies.|$|E
5|$|Bacteria {{are further}} divided into lithotrophs that use {{inorganic}} electron donors and organotrophs that use organic compounds as electron donors. Chemotrophic organisms use the respective electron donors for energy conservation (by aerobic/anaerobic respiration or fermentation) and biosynthetic reactions (e.g., carbon dioxide fixation), whereas phototrophic organisms use them only for biosynthetic purposes. Respiratory organisms use chemical compounds {{as a source}} of energy by taking electrons from the reduced substrate and transferring them to a terminal electron acceptor in a redox reaction. This reaction releases energy {{that can be used to}} synthesise ATP and drive metabolism. In aerobic organisms, oxygen is used as the electron acceptor. In anaerobic organisms other inorganic compounds, such as nitrate, sulfate or carbon dioxide are used as electron acceptors. <b>This</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ecologically important processes of denitrification, sulfate reduction, and acetogenesis, respectively.|$|E

J.R. attempts to run both Kristin Shepard (Mary Crosby) and Alan Beam (Randolph Powell) out of town as they both plot revenge against him. He also attempts to move Sue Ellen Ewing (Linda Gray) back into a sanitarium. With Cliff Barnes (Ken Kercheval) having sought revenge upon J.R. based on an agreement he realized Jock Ewing (Jim Davis) and Digger Barnes (Keenan Wynn) had, J.R. has the oil fields stopped to keep Cliff from earning any royalties. Pamela Barnes Ewing (Victoria Principal) and husband Bobby Ewing (Patrick Duffy) move out of Southfork out of disgust at J.R.'s dealings. In the end, J.R. is shot while working late at the office.|$|E
5|$|Levels {{of genetic}} {{diversity}} within individual populations of B.cuneata are unusually high {{for a rare}} and endangered species, but the populations fall into two genetically distinct groups. These are separated not by geographical distance but by the Salt River, an ephemeral saline river system that provides a habitat unsuitable for both B.cuneata and the birds that pollinate it. It thus functions {{as a barrier to}} the exchange of genetic material, allowing populations on different sides of the river to diverge through genetic drift. The implication for conservation is that effort should be invested {{on both sides of the}} river in order to conserve as much genetic diversity as possible. It was suggested that one large population from each population group would probably be adequate. More recently, however, a model-based risk analysis found that the population size required to reduce extinction risk to acceptable levels is more than ten times the current population size. <b>This</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> conclusion that all populations, and all available habitat, should be protected.|$|E

5|$|Most {{bacteria}} {{enter the}} lungs via small aspirations of organisms {{residing in the}} throat or nose. Half of normal people have these small aspirations during sleep. While the throat always contains bacteria, potentially infectious ones reside there only at certain times and under certain conditions. A minority of types of bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Legionella pneumophila reach the lungs via contaminated airborne droplets. Bacteria can spread also via the blood. Once in the lungs, bacteria may invade the spaces between cells and between alveoli, where the macrophages and neutrophils (defensive white blood cells) attempt to inactivate the bacteria. The neutrophils also release cytokines, causing a general activation of the immune system. <b>This</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fever, chills, and fatigue common in bacterial pneumonia. The neutrophils, bacteria, and fluid from surrounding blood vessels fill the alveoli, resulting in the consolidation seen on chest X-ray.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of the hall is opulently, but {{by the standards of}} the day, simply decorated and furnished. Ornament is used with such restraint that it was possible to decorate both private and state rooms in the same style, without oppressing the former. The principal entrance is through the Marble Hall, which is in fact made of pink Derbyshire alabaster; <b>this</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> piano nobile, or the first floor, and state rooms. The most impressive of these rooms is the Saloon, which has walls lined with red velvet. Each of the major state rooms is symmetrical in its layout and design; in some rooms, false doors are necessary to fully achieve this balanced effect.|$|E
5|$|The {{process takes}} place in {{multiple}} stages. First, fat synthesized within the endoplasmic reticulum accumulates in droplets between {{the inner and outer}} phospholipid monolayers of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. As these droplets increase in size, the two monolayers separate further and eventually pinch off. <b>This</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> surrounding of the droplet in a phospholipid monolayer that allows it to disperse within the aqueous cytoplasm. In the next stage, lipid droplets then migrate to the apical surface of the cell, where plasma membrane subsequently envelops the droplet and extrudes together with it. It fully encases the fat droplet in an additional bilayer of phospholipids. The milk fat globule thus released into the glandular lumen, measuring 3-6 μm in average diameter, is surrounded by a phospholipid trilayer containing associated proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids derived primarily from the membrane of the secreting lactocyte. This trilayer is collectively known as MFGM.|$|E

5|$|Theses 30–34 {{deal with}} the false {{certainty}} Luther believed the indulgence preachers offered Christians. Since no one knows whether a person is truly repentant, a letter assuring a person of his forgiveness is dangerous. In theses 35 and 36, he attacks the idea that an indulgence makes repentance unnecessary. <b>This</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> conclusion that the truly repentant person, who alone may benefit from the indulgence, has already received the only benefit the indulgence provides. Truly repentant Christians have already, according to Luther, been forgiven of the penalty {{as well as the}} guilt of sin. In thesis 37, he states that indulgences are not necessary for Christians to receive all the benefits provided by Christ. Theses 39 and 40 argue that indulgences make true repentance more difficult. True repentance desires God's punishment of sin, but indulgences teach one to avoid punishment, since that is the purpose of purchasing the indulgence.|$|E
