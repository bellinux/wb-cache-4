5|$|The West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) {{contemplated}} {{whether it}} would be better to cancel all matches in Guyana or to sack Sobers; neither prospect was attractive. The crisis ended when Eric Williams, the Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago, wrote a letter of apology for Sobers to sign, which was relayed to the WICB and several governmental bodies in late October 1970. This was accepted, and the incident was soon largely forgotten. Sobers regained his overwhelming popularity with West Indian cricket fans, continued as team captain until 1972 and retired from cricket two years later. He thereafter retained his stance <b>that</b> <b>politics</b> should not interfere with sport. His Rhodesian visit has been cited as precursoring the South African rebel tours controversy of the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|While {{a boycott}} by the United States was {{suggested}} due to Germany's National Socialist regime, {{it was not}} implemented as the President of the United States Olympic Committee, Avery Brundage, felt <b>that</b> <b>politics</b> should be kept separate from sport. The other NOCs which threatened to boycott the Games {{for the same reason}} were the United Kingdom, France, Sweden, Czechoslovakia and the Netherlands. An alternative People's Olympiad was planned to take place in Barcelona, Spain, but was cancelled at the last moment following the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War after the athletes had already begun to arrive. The civil war also meant that Spain's NOC did not compete at the 1936 Games. While no NOCs ended up boycotting the Games on anti-Nazi grounds, a multinational Jewish-led boycott of the Games took place, with individual athletes refusing to take part. Also, the IAAFs' refusal to allow athletes from Northern Ireland to compete for the Irish Olympic Council in athletics events led the Irish Free State to boycott.|$|E

25|$|Priestley claimed {{throughout}} his life <b>that</b> <b>politics</b> did not interest him {{and that he did}} not participate in it. What appeared to others as political arguments were for Priestley always, at their root, religious arguments.

25|$|In 1980, the United States {{boycotted the}} Olympic Games in Moscow, Russia. Germ√°n Rieckehoff, {{who was then}} the {{president}} of the Puerto Rican Olympic Committee, was against the boycott because he believed <b>that</b> <b>politics</b> should not get involved with sporting events. He was, therefore, denied economic support from the local government. Rieckehoff did however, manage to send one athlete to represent Puerto Rico in boxing, Alberto Mercado, who became the only American citizen to participate in the 1980 Olympics.|$|E
25|$|Chomsky's {{political}} views have changed little since his childhood, {{when he was}} influenced by the emphasis on political activism that was ingrained in Jewish working-class tradition. He usually identifies as an anarcho-syndicalist or a libertarian socialist. He views these positions not as precise political theories but as ideals that he thinks best meet the needs of humans: liberty, community, and freedom of association. Unlike some other socialists, such as those who accept Marxism, Chomsky believes <b>that</b> <b>politics</b> lies outside the remit of science; however, he still roots his ideas about an ideal society in empirical data and empirically justified theories.|$|E
25|$|There was a {{widespread}} belief {{on all sides}} of the debate, confirmed by top Bush administration officials, <b>that</b> <b>politics</b> {{played a role in the}} decision to impose tariffs. Namely, the large and important Rust Belt swing states of Pennsylvania and West Virginia would benefit from the tariffs. The placement of the tariffs was an odd one for Bush, who has signed numerous free trade agreements during his term in office. This was widely believed to be a calculated political decision, insofar as the localities that stood to benefit were marginal ones. Both the George H. W. Bush administration and the Reagan administration also imposed import limits on steel.|$|E

25|$|From its outset, Wilson became {{disenchanted with}} {{resistance}} to his recommendations at Princeton; he ruminated on future political leadership. Prior to the Democratic presidential nominating convention in 1908, Wilson had dropped hints to some influential {{players in the}} Democratic Party of {{his interest in the}} Democratic ticket. While he had no real expectations of being placed on the ticket, he did leave instructions that he should not be offered the vice presidential nomination. He then left for a vacation in Scotland. Party regulars considered his ideas politically as well as geographically detached and fanciful, but the seeds had been sown. Wilson later commented <b>that</b> <b>politics</b> was less brusque than university administration.|$|E
25|$|The Rashtriya Janata Dal leader, Lalu Prasad's, {{support of}} social justice ensured <b>that</b> <b>politics</b> was {{dominated}} by Mandal politics and caste rather than development during this period. Also, the criminalisation of politics during this time created a business unfriendly climate {{and contributed to the}} economic collapse. The biggest crisis business faced was with organised kidnapping, which the local BJP leaders claimed was linked to the ruling RJD. The resulting crisis led to a flight of capital, middle class professionals, and business leaders to other parts of India. The flight of business and capital increased unemployment and this led to the mass migration of Bihari farmers and unemployed youth to more developed states of India.|$|E
25|$|In 1846, he emigrated {{overland}} to the unorganized Oregon Country {{and settled}} in Oregon City. Once in Oregon, Curry's experience in the newspaper business landed him a job editing the Oregon Spectator, an early newspaper owned by George Abernethy. Abernethy's views <b>that</b> <b>politics</b> should be {{kept out of the}} Spectator lead Curry to resign from the paper after only a year and a half. Curry's belief that this policy was censorship put him at odds with the paper's management. In 1848, he set up the Oregon Free Press in Oregon City in competition with his former employer, the same year as the creation of the Oregon Territory. The newspaper soon failed as the California Gold Rush temporarily drained the territory of people and advertisers.|$|E

25|$|In 1940, {{while still}} a student, Browne {{suffered}} a serious relapse of tuberculosis. His treatment at a sanatorium in Midhurst, Sussex {{was paid for}} by the Chance family. He recovered, passed his medical exams in 1942, and started his career as a medical intern at Dr Steevens' Hospital in Dublin. He subsequently worked in numerous sanatoria throughout Ireland and England, witnessing the ravages of the disease. He soon concluded <b>that</b> <b>politics</b> was the only way in which he could make an attack on the scourge of tuberculosis. Browne joined the new Irish republican party Clann na Poblachta and was elected to D√°il √âireann for the Dublin South-East constituency at the 1948 general election. To the surprise of many, party leader Se√°n MacBride chose Browne {{to be one of the}} party's two ministers in the new government. Browne became one of the few TDs appointed a minister on their first day in D√°il √âireann, when he was appointed Minister for Health.|$|E
25|$|However, {{during his}} imprisonment, PNI had been {{splintered}} by oppression of colonial authorities and internal dissension. The original PNI was disbanded by the Dutch, and its former members formed two different parties; the Partai Indonesia (Partindo) under Sukarno's associate Sartono who were promoting mass agitation, and the Pendidikan Nasional Indonesia (PNI Baroe) under Mohammad Hatta and Soetan Sjahrir, two nationalists who {{recently returned from}} studies in the Netherlands, and who were promoting a long-term strategy of providing modern education to the uneducated Indonesian populace to develop an intellectual elite able to offer effective resistance to Dutch rule. After attempting to reconcile the two parties to establish one united nationalist front, Sukarno chose to become the head of Partindo on 28 July 1932. Partindo had maintained its alignment with Sukarno's own strategy of immediate mass agitation, and Sukarno disagreed with Hatta's long-term cadre-based struggle. Hatta himself believed Indonesian independence would not occur within his lifetime, while Sukarno believed Hatta's strategy ignored the fact <b>that</b> <b>politics</b> can only make real changes through formation and utilisation of force (machtsvorming en machtsaanwending).|$|E
25|$|His {{simplified}} teachings {{were designed}} to appeal primarily {{to the poor and}} the peasants. He attempted to win supporters by cutting down on ceremonies and complex doctrines, eschewing the use of temples. He won over followers by offering free consultations and performing purported miracle cures with simple herbs and acupuncture, and preaching at street corners and canal intersections. He quickly built up a following in the southern Mekong Delta and was looked to by his disciples for guidance in their daily lifestyles. In a time of colonial occupation, a native religion appealed to the masses who were displaying nationalist sentiment. Unlike Gautama Buddha or Jesus, S·ªï was Vietnamese. As a result, S·ªï became a nationalist icon and became a wanted man for the French colonial authorities, having gained 100,000 followers in less than a year. He predicted <b>that</b> <b>politics</b> would be the cause of his premature death.The cult must stem much more from internal faith than from a pompous appearance. It is better to pray with a pure heart before the family altar than to perform gaudy ceremonies in a pagoda, clad in the robes of an unworthy bonze.|$|E

25|$|The {{constitutional}} monarchy {{was marked}} {{by a series of}} legislative proposals by the government of the day, which had its base in the idealism of Mouzinho da Silveira. During his terms in office Silveira promoted revolutionary legislation for both the absolutist and liberal governments of the time (1823‚Äì1833). Payment of rents to the State, relations between the people and the Church, and municipal governance remained {{as they were in the}} medieval era. Silveira realized, to the chagrin of other Portuguese politicians, <b>that</b> <b>politics</b> was an instrument dependent on socioeconomic conditions. Marginalized at first by both absolutists and liberals, his ideas and solutions were later adopted by the new generation of liberal politicians in the post-War era. Among his many proposals, successive governments adopted his policies of disengaging the economy from social conditions, limiting taxes to 5%, ending tithes, abolishing seigniorial fees, reducing export taxes to 1%, terminating the regulation of inter-community commerce and government intervention in municipal affairs, as well as separating the judiciary and administrative offices, liberating general commerce and prohibiting some monopolies (such as the sale of soap and of Porto wines). In general, his initiatives were legislated by the post-War regimes to eliminate the privileges of the elite classes, establish social equality, encourage liberalization of the economy and improve government performance.|$|E
