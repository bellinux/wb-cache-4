2500|$|Bryan {{eventually}} took {{command of}} the lead, pulling away from O'Connor and followers Eddie Sachs and Andy Linden. [...] By {{the end of the}} 63 laps, Bryan was leading O'Connor by three seconds, with Linden the only other driver finishing on the lead lap. [...] Bettenhausen, having rejoined the race after repairing the <b>throttle</b> <b>linkage,</b> was the only retirement after a sway bar broke on Lap 45. [...] The USAC entries dominated, earning the first seven positions. [...] Only Bob Veith's Phillips-Offy was unable to finish ahead of the trio of Jaguars.|$|E
2500|$|Since its {{introduction}} [...] "the Rambler American {{has done well}} at American Motors." [...] For its final model year, 1969, the [...] "American" [...] name was dropped as the car was now {{referred to as the}} [...] "American Motors Rambler". Continuing the tradition of minimal changes, the models received a new [...] "suspended" [...] accelerator pedal and cable <b>throttle</b> <b>linkage.</b> Additional safety equipment for the 1969 models included front shoulder belts and headrests for both front outboard seating positions and the front parking lights stayed on with the headlights. On the exterior, the center horizontal chrome grille bar was deleted.|$|E
5000|$|On many cars, the {{accelerator}} pedal motion is communicated via the throttle cable, {{to activate the}} <b>throttle</b> <b>linkages,</b> which move the throttle plate. In cars with electronic throttle control (also known as [...] "drive-by-wire"), an electric motor controls the <b>throttle</b> <b>linkages</b> and {{the accelerator}} pedal connects not to the throttle body, but to a sensor, which sends the pedal position to the Engine Control Unit (ECU). The ECU determines the throttle opening based on accelerator pedal position and inputs from other engine sensors.|$|R
50|$|Garth Tander limped home in twelfth place {{ahead of}} Mark Noske, Marcus Marshall and Fabrizio Giovanardi. Two {{of the hardest}} hit by tyre delaminations, Steve Ellery and Todd Kelly {{finished}} 16th and 17th and were the last fit cars home. Ingall limped his car home for some championship points ahead of Patrizi, while Rick Kelly and Dumbrell were classified in 20th position after the team rebuilt the <b>throttle</b> <b>linkages,</b> having lost 34 laps.|$|R
50|$|The {{carburetor}} {{works on}} Bernoulli's principle: the faster air moves, the lower its static pressure, {{and the higher}} its dynamic pressure. The <b>throttle</b> (accelerator) <b>linkage</b> does not directly control the flow of liquid fuel. Instead, it actuates carburetor mechanisms which meter the flow of air being pushed into the engine. The speed of this flow, and therefore its pressure, determines the amount of fuel drawn into the airstream.|$|R
2500|$|The first heat {{started on}} Sunday, with {{temperatures}} at the circuit reaching [...] [...] Bettenhausen slowly led {{the field to}} the starting line where an official waved the Italian flag to begin the race. [...] The trio of Jaguars, although starting at the back, managed to jump to an early lead due to their use of a four-speed gearbox, allowing them to out-accelerate the USAC roadsters with two-speed gearboxes. [...] Fairman led the first of 63 laps before the roadsters were able to build enough speed to catch and eventually pass the Jaguars. [...] Bettenhausen returned {{to the front of}} the field, but was forced to relinquish the lead during the fourth lap with a broken <b>throttle</b> <b>linkage.</b> [...] Pat O'Connor and Jimmy Bryan moved to the front and traded off the lead for half of the heat.|$|E
2500|$|The Chevette's {{front end}} {{featured}} a more aerodynamic-looking nose than the Kadett, based loosely {{on the design}} of the [...] "droopsnoot" [...] Firenza, itself said to be inspired by the Pontiac Firebird, a sister GM product. In contrast the Kadett had a more conventional, flat-fronted design. In 1980, the Chevette underwent a facelift with flush fitting headlights, giving it a [...] "family look" [...] alongside the larger Vauxhall Cavalier version of the Opel Ascona B. Mechanical changes included the introduction of Bosch distributors, revised heater ducting and a simplified <b>throttle</b> <b>linkage.</b> It also received new wheel designs, revised C-pillar vent covers and revamped interior trim with re-designed front seats to increase rear knee room marginally. However, it was effectively the beginning of a phase-out in favour of the newer Astra, Vauxhall's version of the front wheel drive Kadett D, which was launched in January 1980; although it was not produced in Britain until November 1981. The phasing-out of the Chevette continued in April 1983, when the hatchback model was discontinued due to the launch of the Spanish built Nova.|$|E
2500|$|The B31 {{made its}} racing debut in 1975 at the 1000 km of Mugello, which {{was part of}} the World Championship for Makes; KVG Racing entered John Hine and Ian Grob in a B31, and Team Italiano Chevron also ran the new car, {{choosing}} Eris Tondelli and Mauro Nesti to drive it. Team Italiano Chevron, however, had the B31 fitted with a 1.3-litre Cosworth straight-four engine in place of the Hart 420R; thus, whilst the KVG Racing car was classified in the Sports 2000 category, the Team Italiano Chevron car was classified in the Sports 1300 category. Although the 1300cc car retired, KVG Racing won the Sports 2000 class, and finished fifth overall. The 1300cc car was then entered {{in the second round of}} the Campionato Italiano Group 5 Sport, held at Varano; [...] "Bramen", its driver, was classified eighth in the Sports 1300 category. The car's next international event was the 800 km of Dijon, where KVG Racing were the only team to enter a B31; they took third overall, and the Sports 2000 class victory. At the 1000 km of Monza, Grob crashed his B31 in practice, leaving the car too damaged to compete in the race; instead, [...] "Bramen" [...] and Pasquale Anastasio were the only B31 drivers to compete in the race; they won the Sports 1300 class, and finished 13th overall. At the 1000 km of Spa, KVG Racing were once again the only entrants; this time, they finished third in the Sports 2000 class, and 14th overall. At the 1000 km of Pergusa, KVG Racing entered their car, whilst [...] "Bramen" [...] partnered Giancarlo Gagliardi in a 1.6-litre Cosworth FVA straight-four engined car that had been entered by Scuderia Citta dei Mille; although KVG Racing finished ninth overall and last (second in the Sports 2000 class), Scuderia Citta dei Mille won the Sports 1600 class (as they were the only entrant in that class to finish), and finished sixth overall. At the 1000 km of Nürburgring, both of the entered B31s featured Hart 420R engines; KVG Racing had entered one, as usual, but this time they were joined by Fisons Racing, who entered Martin Raymond and Tony Goodwin in their car. However, neither car had a successful race; the Fisons Racing car suffered an oil leak after 23 laps, and was forced to retire, whilst the KVG Racing car was classified eighth in the Sports 2000 class (26th overall), but suffered a <b>throttle</b> <b>linkage</b> failure after 30 laps, whilst leading its class. Four Hart 420R-engined B31s were entered in the European 2-Litre Championship (E2LC) opener, held at Brands Hatch; KVG Racing entered Hine and Grob in two separate cars, whilst Fisons Racing entered Raymond, and the fourth entrant did not show up. Although Raymond did not compete in the race, having blown his engine up, Hine won the first heat, and Grob finished fourth in that heat; in the second heat, Grob finished third, whilst Hine span, stalled, and was forced to retire. At the rain-shortened 1000 km of Zeltweg, Fisons Racing (now called Team Fisons) and KVG Racing both entered B31 Harts; the KVG Racing car blew its engine after nine laps, but the Team Fisons car finished 13th overall, and sixth in class. At the Hockenheim round of the E2LC, four B31 Harts were entered; KVG Racing entered Grob and Richard Lloyd, although the latter did not attend, whilst Team Fisons Racing entered Raymond, and Jörg Zaborowski entered as a privateer, but did not attend the race. Grob finished fourth in the first heat, whilst Raymond finished second; Grob's 21st in the second heat dropped him to 17th overall, but Raymond won the second heat, and won the event outright. This would prove to be the car's last major international event of the season, although Raymond did enter his B31 in the Interserie championship, as he had been doing throughout the season.|$|E
50|$|Arena's 2007 {{effort would}} suffer {{mechanical}} setbacks early, {{with the team}} struggling to finish races due to <b>throttle</b> cable <b>linkage</b> failures. The team was also forced to withdraw from Le Mans when a heavy accident during testing damage the car so badly that repairs could not be completed in the two weeks prior to the race. Arena was however able to finish in eighth place at the Nürburgring, earning them their first points of the season.|$|R
5000|$|Radio-controlled cars use {{a common}} set of {{components}} for their control and operation. All cars require a transmitter, which has the joysticks for control, or in pistol grip form, a trigger for throttle and a wheel for turning, and a receiver which sits inside the car. The receiver changes the radio signal broadcast from the transmitter into suitable electrical control signals for the other components of the control system. Most radio systems utilize amplitude modulation for the radio signal and encode the control positions with pulse width modulation. Upgraded radio systems are available that use the more robust frequency modulation and pulse code modulation. Recently however, 2.4 GHz frequency radios have become the standard for hobby-grade R/C cars. The radio is wired up to either electronic speed controls or servomechanisms (shortened to [...] "servo" [...] in common usage) which perform actions such as throttle control, braking, steering, and on some cars, engaging either forward or reverse gears. Electronic speed controls and servos are commanded by the receiver through pulse width modulation; pulse duration sets either the amount of current that an electronic speed control allows to flow into the electric motor or sets the angle of the servo. On these models the servo is attached to at least the steering mechanism; rotation of the servo is mechanically changed into a force which steers the wheels on the model, generally through adjustable turnbuckle linkages. Servo savers are integrated into all steering linkages and some nitro <b>throttle</b> <b>linkages.</b> A servo saver is a flexible link between the servo and its linkage that protects the servo's internal gears from damage during impacts or stress.|$|R
50|$|Automobile {{accelerator}} pedals {{have historically}} been mechanical assemblies which link the pedal to the engine <b>throttle</b> by mechanical <b>linkages</b> or a Bowden cable. With the advent of electronic throttle control, accelerator pedals consist of a spring-loaded pedal arm connected to an electronic transducer. This transducer, typically a potentiometer orHall effect sensor, converts {{the position of the}} pedal arm to an electronic signal which is sent to an electronic control unit (ECU).|$|R

50|$|After {{the race}} the problem, which denied Arrows, Bridgestone and Yamaha their first ever {{victories}} (in {{the case of}} Arrows and Yamaha, their only ever victories), was diagnosed as a <b>throttle</b> <b>linkage</b> failure, caused by a broken washer worth 50 pence.|$|E
2500|$|Since its {{introduction}} the AW119 Koala {{has developed a}} reputation as one of the safest helicopters in its class. Nicknamed [...] "Volvo of light helicopters" [...] by operators and technicians, it has proven a forgiving platform when exposed to extreme conditions and operational tempos. The AW119 incorporates a level of system redundancy unparalleled in its class; a few examples being: duel hydraulic pumps driven directly by its main rotor transmission on opposite sides, two separate stability augmentation systems, electronic engine control system coupled with a direct <b>throttle</b> control <b>linkage</b> to fuel metering unit and mechanical governor allowing for a MANUAL mode, two fuel tank boost pumps in addition to engine driven fuel pump, two heading GMU sensors, two independent VHF systems available, and primary and secondary GPS sources. A high-inertia rotor system coupled with a robust box structure and separated fuel bladder tank setup has contributed greatly to crash survivability.|$|R
40|$|It appears most {{probable}} that the Watts linkage {{of the aircraft}} has experienced a tensile overload superimposed with bending stresses during {{which one of the}} bolts of the fork connector between the pogo stick and the frame got sheared off. Evidences also suggest that both the bolts of the fork connector were present at the time of failure and there were no abnormalities in the assembly. Tell tale marks on the inner surface of the fork of the link assembly suggest that the bolt connecting the lever and the link assembly of the control linkage port PFCU was present prior to the accident. Evidences also suggest that this joint has experienced compressive force due to impact leading to shearing off of the bolt and subsequent dislodgement of all the attaching parts. Certain damages were seen on the bolts and/or nuts of control linkage starboard PFCU and engine <b>throttle</b> control <b>linkage</b> in question, which probably have been caused by split pins. This means that split pins were present in these bolts at some given time during their service life. It was not possible to ascertain whether or not these bolts were fitted with split pins prior to the accident. ...|$|R
50|$|Mister Transmission {{performs}} multi-check inspections. These inspections include: {{checking the}} transmission fluid, a road test, a lift inspection checking: neutral switch, engine rpm, <b>throttle</b> <b>linkage,</b> modulators, transmission mounts, u-joints, fluid retention, and electronic controls, while also doing a pan inspection which checks {{the inside of}} the transmission.|$|E
50|$|Fangio and Behra raced {{away into}} the {{distance}} {{as the rest of}} the field floundered. Moss's <b>throttle</b> <b>linkage</b> broke on the startline and he lost 10 laps having it fixed. The Ferraris were all suffering terribly with clutch problems, as both Collins and Musso burnt theirs out, whilst Hawthorn's was slipping badly.|$|E
50|$|May 31, 1974: A Beechcraft C35 Bonanza, {{registration}} number N1985D, was destroyed and its pilot and passenger seriously injured when it lost power and crashed in a farm field while circling Air Park-Dallas to land. The crash {{was attributed to}} improper maintenance; the craft's <b>throttle</b> <b>linkage</b> had fallen apart due to an improperly tightened bolt.|$|E
50|$|The {{brothers}} both piloted {{the aircraft}} {{many times in}} the Nottingham area, and flew it as far as Hatfield in June 1935 to attend a flying display. Performance on the Bristol Cherub engine was marginal; as originally built the Archaeopteryx was an Ultralight and as such the performance was adequate, so long as the pilot was no more than 11 stone, it was flown quite successfully for five years prior to it retirement, the throttle control was placed outside of the fuselage and a positive climb rate could only be obtained by the pilot moving his arms and elbows into the cramped cockpit to minimise drag. The external <b>throttle</b> <b>linkage</b> was not a feature of the original aircraft, this was a later addition when in 1975 it was restored to flight condition by the Shuttleworth trust who used the <b>throttle</b> <b>linkage</b> from a Tiger moth, The aircraft was difficult to control in pitch, especially on landing where a series of large bounces often developed.|$|E
50|$|Weber Carburetors {{are sold}} for both street and {{off-road}} use, with the twin choke sidedraught DCOE {{being the most}} common one. They are sold in what {{is referred to as}} a Weber Conversion kit. A Weber conversion kit is a complete package of Weber Carburetor, intake manifold or manifold adapter, <b>throttle</b> <b>linkage,</b> air filter and all of the necessary hardware needed to install the Weber on a vehicle.|$|E
50|$|Most {{automatic}} transmissions include some means of forcing a downshift (Throttle kickdown) into {{the lowest possible}} gear ratio if the throttle pedal is fully depressed. In many older designs, kickdown is accomplished by mechanically actuating a valve inside the transmission. Most modern designs use a solenoid-operated valve that is triggered by a switch on the <b>throttle</b> <b>linkage</b> or by the engine control unit (ECU) {{in response to an}} abrupt increase in engine power.|$|E
5000|$|After {{competing}} in the 2003 Indianapolis 500, Andretti retired from full-time IndyCar racing. He led the race for 28 of the opening 94 laps before a <b>throttle</b> <b>linkage</b> failure put him out of contention once again. That year he bought into the [...] "Team Green" [...] squad run by brothers Kim and Barry Green in CART. It became Andretti Green Racing and for 2003, the team moved to the Indy Racing League IndyCar Series.|$|E
5000|$|There {{were two}} Ram Air 400 CID L engines for 1970: the [...] L74 Ram Air III ( [...] in GTO) and the [...] LS1 Ram Air IV ( [...] in GTO) that were carried over from 1969. The {{difference}} between the GTO and Firebird engines was that the secondary carburetor's <b>throttle</b> <b>linkage</b> had a restrictor which prevented the rear barrels from opening completely, adjusting the linkage could allow full carburetor operation resulting in identical engine performance.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} {{parts in the}} <b>throttle</b> <b>linkage</b> are also unique to the TR7 Sprint, most {{obviously}} the link plate between the two carburettors (just visible in Figure 2, and partially obscuring the inlet manifold in Figure 3), which was not fitted to the Dolomite Sprint; and the throttle lever/link rod (visible just over the air box in Figure 3), which looks {{the same as the}} TR7 part, but is longer to allow for the carbs being further apart.|$|E
50|$|When {{the racing}} got under way, Carlos Pace led from pole in a Brabham 1-2 but was soon passed by Jody Scheckter and Carlos Reutemann after {{experiencing}} braking problems, and Patrick Depailler soon climbed to third. James Hunt retired {{with a broken}} <b>throttle</b> <b>linkage,</b> Vittorio Brambilla with oil cooler problems and Ian Scheckter crashed. Emerson Fittipaldi was challenging Depailler for 4th place when he suffered a cracked plug lead. Jody Scheckter held on from Reutemann for his only home win.|$|E
50|$|Throttle valves in the updraft {{carburettor}} throat {{were controlled}} by an automatic boost control through the <b>throttle</b> <b>linkage</b> {{to maintain the}} selected manifold pressure with changes in altitude. The valves were only partially open during ground and low-level operation to prevent overboosting of the engine. As air density decreases with increased altitude, the throttle valves were progressively opened {{in response to the}} reducing atmospheric pressure. This system provided full power within engine boost limitations up to the critical altitude of 26000 ft.|$|E
50|$|A runaway {{condition}} {{can also}} result from oil supplied by {{failure of the}} oil seals in a turbocharged diesel engine, from overfilling the crankcase with oil, or certain other mechanical problems such as a broken internal fuel pipe or a worn or incorrectly assembled <b>throttle</b> <b>linkage.</b> In vehicles or installations that use both diesel engines and bottled gas (e.g. propane, natural gas, acetylene) or operate {{in an area where}} vapors may accumulate, a gas leak drawn back into the engine air intake can supply unintended fuel.|$|E
50|$|Early Vega {{models were}} subject to two recalls. The first {{addressed}} backfiring on 130,000 cars fitted with L-11 option two-barrel carburetor, due to engine vibration loosening screws on the carburetor and causing over-fueling. The second, in the early summer of 1972, concerned a perceived risk that a component in the emission control system of 350,000 cars with the standard engine might fall into the <b>throttle</b> <b>linkage,</b> jamming it open. Faulty valve-stem seals caused excessive oil consumption, {{but this was not}} addressed until the release of the updated Dura-built engine in 1976.|$|E
50|$|After a {{disastrous}} {{start to the}} season which saw the cars almost fail to make the grid in Australia, the team improved, hiring John Barnard as Technical Director. Hill scored a point at Silverstone, but {{the highlight of the}} year came at the Hungarian GP, where he qualified third and led for most of the race. Unfortunately, the failure of a <b>throttle</b> <b>linkage</b> component saw him drop behind Jacques Villeneuve on the final lap, although second place was still a great success for the team. Diniz also scored two points at the Nürburgring.|$|E

50|$|At the French Grand Prix Button {{finished}} 8th, finally {{earning his}} and his team's first point of the season. This was a rare highlight as the car proved to be slow in subsequent races. The car put on its worst performance yet in Hungary where the RA107 {{proved to be the}} slowest car on the grid and Barrichello finished 18th and last. Honda debuted a front wing which looked very similar to the Spyker's wing. Button ran ahead of Adrian Sutil in the Spyker, but the RA107's <b>throttle</b> <b>linkage</b> failed before the Spyker could overtake during pitstops.|$|E

50|$|A {{gasoline}} engine is fed by either a carburetor with a butterfly valve or an air receiver with a throttle valve and fuel injectors. In {{both cases the}} operated valves (in case of car - the gas pedal), control the volume of air-fuel mixture taken into the engine and control engine speed. Finally the combustion cycle requires an ignition system in form of an electric spark, that is circuited to a switch (in case of car - the ignition key). Thus in the rare case of <b>throttle</b> <b>linkage</b> rupture, {{it is very easy}} to bring a runaway petrol engine to a stop by switching off the ignition.|$|E
50|$|At {{launch the}} {{innovative}} {{design of the}} Imp was underdeveloped, {{in part because of}} UK Government pressure to start production quickly in response to the job losses in shipbuilding. Mechanical and cooling system problems were commonplace in the early cars. At the end of 1965 a major revision to the Imp was introduced, effectively splitting the marque into Mk I and Mk II cars. The Mk I Imps had a pneumatic <b>throttle</b> <b>linkage</b> and an automatic choke, both of which were replaced by more conventional items on the Mk II. The Mk II also had improved front suspension geometry and several trim and detail changes. Although the car was constantly improved over its production life, there was no single change as significant as that in 1965.|$|E
