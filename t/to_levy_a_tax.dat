5|$|Final Fantasy XI has {{a largely}} player-based economy, {{with a heavy}} {{reliance}} on auction houses {{in each of the}} major cities of Vana'diel. There are certain economic controls in place mainly in the form of fees for putting items up for auction. Transportation, auction house, item storage, and fees do not go to players; these gil sinks effectively remove money from the economy to prevent inflation. The city of Jeuno used <b>to</b> <b>levy</b> <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> on bazaar purchases inside the city, but it was removed in a patch in the December 2008 version update.|$|E
25|$|For decades, {{the school}} was {{supported}} by tuition payments. But gradually the State began to assume {{a share of the}} financial responsibility. In 1820, a law authorized townships <b>to</b> <b>levy</b> <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> to pay the tuition of poor students. By 1828, townships had the power to tax for general school purposes. The State itself began to contribute money in 1830, and in 1846 every township was required to raise as much money each year for schools as the State itself contributed. The last tuition assessment for residents occurred in 1861, and thereafter the Columbia School was entirely supported by public taxation.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the taxes mentioned above, the cantons are free to introduce others. Several cantons levy an inheritance tax (Erbschaftssteuer / Imposta di successione) and a gift tax (Schenkungssteuer / Imposta di donazione), {{although there is a}} trend towards abolishing those. Moreover, the cantons are required by federal law <b>to</b> <b>levy</b> <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> on the profit from the sale of real estate (Grundstückgewinnsteuer / impôt sur les gains immobiliers / Imposta sugli utili immobiliari). Most also levy a tax on the value of the property sold (Handänderungssteuer / impôt sur les mutations / Tassa di mutazione) so as to discourage speculation in real estate. Taxes are also frequently levied on the ownership of dogs and motor vehicles, on lotteries, on the sale of tickets to public entertainments, or on overnight stays in certain tourist destinations.|$|E

2500|$|Proposition 218 {{requires}} two-thirds voter {{approval for}} any parcel <b>tax</b> <b>levied</b> by <b>a</b> local government. [...] However, Proposition 218 {{does not provide}} the legal authority <b>to</b> <b>levy</b> <b>a</b> parcel <b>tax.</b> [...] The legal authority <b>to</b> <b>levy</b> <b>a</b> parcel <b>tax</b> generally comes from state statutes (often referred to as enabling statutes) which usually include additional restrictions {{on the ability of}} <b>a</b> local government <b>to</b> <b>levy</b> <b>a</b> parcel <b>tax,</b> such as requiring <b>a</b> parcel <b>tax</b> to be imposed on a uniform basis. [...] The requirement that many parcel taxes apply uniformly to all taxpayers or all real property within <b>a</b> local <b>taxing</b> district is <b>a</b> result of statutory restrictions imposed by the California Legislature and not {{as a result of the}} constitutional restrictions of either Proposition 218 or Proposition 13.|$|R

25|$|In 1637, Grandmaster Giovanni Paolo Lascaris set out <b>to</b> <b>levy</b> <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> of 50,000 scudi on the Maltese for the {{construction}} of the Floriana Lines. The Grandmaster ignored a protest against the tax by the Maltese clergy, lodged with Pope Urban VIII. The Pope sided with the Order against the laity and the clergy, and the Grandmaster ordered taxmen to start their collections. The tax collectors met immediately with opposition and an uprising began in September in Żejtun, the first village where collection was attempted. The leaders hoped to assemble the people at Marsa, then to march on Valletta as a procession with a cross or some statue of a saint. The parish priest of Żejtun was alarmed at these preparations, particularly the suggestions to bear arms in the protest, and informed Bishop Miguel Juan Balaguer Camarasa. The Bishop sent the priest to the inquisitor, Fabio Chigi, later Pope Alexander VII, who ordered him to report everything to the grandmaster. The latter imprisoned the lay leaders of the revolt. Acting on Chigi's advice, the grandmaster did not arrest local priests, even if there were suspicions they were involved in the revolt.|$|E
25|$|Willem Kieft was {{appointed}} Director of New Netherland by the Dutch West India Company in 1639, {{with one of}} his orders to increase profits from pelts for the fur trade at Achter Kol and its port at Pavonia. Kieft attempted <b>to</b> <b>levy</b> <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> on the Tappan but was ignored. The payment of tribute was common among the tribes, and the British had forced upon it the Pequots. In February 1643, the Mahicans attacked Wappinger encampments in order to collect overdue payment. At first they fled to New Amsterdam, but after 14 days, fearing their for their safety they scattered themselves among the Hackensack and Tappan at Communipaw and to Corlears Hook. Kieft ordered they be attacked on February 25, 1643. The initial strike was a slaughter: 129 Dutch soldiers killed approximately 120 people (including women and children): eighty at Pavonia and thirty at Corlear's Hook (Lower East Side). Overcoming their other rivalries in face of a common enemy, the indigenous populations united and retaliated in October of the same year, attacking the plantations at Pavonia, with survivors fleeing to the fort at the tip of Manhattan. The brewery at Hoebuk survived, its roof not being made of thatch. De Vries, with interest in and better contact with the local population, was able to negotiate temporarily holding off attacks at his farm and the Achter Kol Colony, from which settlers were evacuated. In August 1643, Oratam (representing his people and other groups), agreed to a truce with the New Netherlanders. Unfortunately the peace did not hold and {{for the next two years}} the whole of the province was at war. It was not until August 30, 1645 that a treaty to cease hostilities was finally concluded.|$|E
2500|$|According to the Laws of Oléron the whalemen of Biarritz, Saint-Jean-de-Luz, and {{the rest}} of the French Basque country were exempt from taxation, {{although}} they voluntarily gave the whales' tongues to the church as a gift. It wasn't until the kings of England, acting as the Dukes of Guyenne, that charges began to be enacted against them. In 1197, the future King John of England (r. 1199–1216) gave Vital de Biole and his heirs and successors the right <b>to</b> <b>levy</b> <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> of 50 angevin livres on the first two whales taken annually at Biarritz, in exchange for the rent of the fishery at Guernsey. In 1257, William Lavielle gave the bishop and chapter of Bayonne a tithe of the whales caught by the men of the same port. This was paid until 1498. In 1261, an act of the Abbey of Honce announced, as a continuation of the tradition of giving the tongue as a gift to the church, a tithe was to be paid on the whales landed at Bayonne. Under a 1324 edict known as De Praerogativa Regis (The Royal Prerogative), Edward II (r. 1307–27) collected a duty on the whales caught in British waters, which included the French Basque coast. His successor, Edward III (r. 1327–77), continued this tradition by collecting a £6 tax for each whale taken and landed at Biarritz. In 1338, this was relinquished to Peter de Puyanne, admiral of the English fleet stationed at Bayonne.|$|E

60|$|When {{he entered}} the prison, his first and prayerful object was <b>to</b> <b>levy</b> <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> upon his affliction--to {{endeavour}} to draw honey from the carcass of the lion. His care was to render his imprisonment subservient to the great design of showing forth the glory of God by patient submission to His will. Before his commitment, he had a strong presentiment of his sufferings; his earnest prayer, for many months, was that he might, with composure, encounter all his trials, even to an ignominious death. This {{led him to the}} solemn consideration of reckoning himself, his wife, children, health, enjoyments, all as dying, and in perfect uncertainty, and to live upon God, his invisible but ever-present Father.|$|E
6000|$|The {{kings and}} princes disliked this {{alienation}} of property very greatly. In the place of feudal lords capable of military support, they found their land supporting abbeys and monks and nuns. And these lands were really under foreign dominion. Even before the time of Pope Gregory VII {{there had been a}} struggle between the princes and the papacy over the question of [...] "investitures," [...] the question that is of who should appoint the bishops. If that power rested with the Pope and not the King, then the latter lost control not only of the consciences of his subjects but of a considerable part of his dominions. For also the clergy claimed exemption from taxation. They paid their taxes to Rome. And not only that, but the church also claimed the right <b>to</b> <b>levy</b> <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> of one-tenth upon the property of the layman in addition to the taxes he paid his prince.|$|E
6000|$|If more {{evidence}} is needed {{as to the}} debauched estate of the Scottish clergy, we obtain it from Mary of Guise, widow of James V., the Regent then governing Scotland for her child, Mary Stuart. The Queen, in December 1555, begged Pius IV. to permit her <b>to</b> <b>levy</b> <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> on her clergy, and {{to listen to what}} Cardinal Sermoneta would tell him about their need of reformation. The Cardinal drew a terrible sketch of the nefarious lives of [...] "every kind of religious women" [...] in Scotland. They go about with their illegal families and dower their daughters out of the revenues of the Church. The monks, too, have bloated wealth, while churches are allowed to fall into decay. [...] "The only hope is in the Holy Father," [...] who should appoint an episcopal commission of visitation. For about forty years prelates have been alienating Church lands illegally, and churches and monasteries, by the avarice of those placed in charge, are crumbling to decay. Bishops are the chief dealers in cattle, fish, and hides, though we have, in fact, good evidence that their dealings were very limited, [...] "sma' sums." ...|$|E

But the court decided that Angelo could not sit in the board with him, either in public or executive sessions, {{and at the same}} time forbade the board to deny admission to Luigi, a fairly and legally chosen alderman. The case was carried up and up from court to court, yet still the same old original decision was confirmed every time. As a result, the city government not only stood still, with its hands tied, but everything it was created to protect and care for went a steady gait toward rack and ruin. There was no way <b>to</b> <b>levy</b> <b>a</b> <b>tax,</b> so the minor officials had to resign or starve; therefore they resigned.
