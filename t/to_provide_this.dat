5|$|Since medieval times, dubbin, a waxy product, {{was used}} to soften and {{waterproof}} leather; however, it did not impart shine. It was made from natural wax, oil, soda ash and tallow. As leather with a high natural veneer became popular in the 18th century, a high glossy finish became important, particularly on shoes and boots. In most cases, a variety of homemade polishes were used <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>this</b> finish, often with lanolin or beeswax as a base.|$|E
5|$|After a brief hiatus {{during the}} 1906 general election, which the Liberals {{won by a}} landslide, obtaining a {{majority}} of 126 seats in the House of Commons, Haldane {{turned his attention to}} the Tangier Crisis, which had almost brought France and Germany to war in December. Sir Edward Grey, the Foreign Secretary, had privately agreed to commit the Army to the aid of France, if attacked, and Haldane began to consider how best to accomplish this. He quickly concluded that there was a need for a regular expeditionary force, specifically prepared and trained for use as a continental intervention force. The question now became how <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>this</b> force, and after a short period Haldane settled on a strength of six infantry divisions and their supporting units. They would need to be organised in peacetime and prepared to mobilise in the United Kingdom, as they would be committed into action as soon as they reached the Continent.|$|E

5|$|The Port Authority {{voted to}} proceed with the {{scaled-down}} system in 1996. A final environmental impact statement (FEIS) for the JFK people mover, conducted by the Port Authority and released in 1997, examined eight possible transport improvements that could be constructed in order <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>this</b> direct connection. Ultimately, a light rail with the qualities of a people mover, tentatively called the JFK Light Rail System, was selected as the most feasible mode of transportation for the new system. It would replace the shuttle buses that traveled between the terminals as well as to and from Howard Beach. The FEIS determined that an automated system with frequent headways was the most optimal design. The light rail would run from the airport terminals to either Jamaica or Howard Beach. It had been almost 30 years between the first JFK rail link proposal and the approval of the light rail system; within that time period, there had been 21 proposals for direct rail links to New York-area airports, which were all canceled.|$|E
5|$|The {{question}} now became how <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>this</b> force, {{and after a}} short period Haldane settled on a strength of six twelve-battalion infantry divisions with supporting arms. They {{would need to be}} organised in peacetime and prepared to mobilise in the United Kingdom, as they would be committed into action as soon as they reached the Continent. Because the Army was now geared to a specific purpose, it could be reorganised to fit this role, and any elements which did not support it could be discarded. These reforms anticipated that the existing tripartite division of the Armythe Regular Army, the Volunteers/Yeomanry and the Militiashould be changed into a two-part structure, with an Expeditionary Force and a home-defence Territorial Force based on County Associations. The Volunteers and Yeomanry would form the basis for the Territorial Force, whilst the Militia would be used as a reserve for the all-Regular Expeditionary Force, fully liable for service overseas.|$|E
5|$|In January 2016, Wintory {{started a}} Kickstarter for a Journey Live concert tour, {{in which the}} fifteen-piece Fifth House Ensemble from Chicago will perform the music from the game while a player works {{their way through the}} game. The {{ensemble}} will react to the player's actions, using a specially-scored version of the soundtrack, composed by Patrick O'Malley with Wintory's oversight, that breaks the music into small pieces to enable this reaction. Wintory had wanted to do a performance of the Journey soundtrack in this interactive manner, but did not have the time to rework the soundtrack for this purpose. Wintory came to know Dan Visconti, the composer for Fifth House Ensemble, after Visconti published his praise for the Journey soundtrack and had encouraged other members of the ensemble to play the game. The group saw how Journeys soundtrack had been used for various Video Games Live concerts and believed they could pull off Wintory's vision of an interactive concert, doing most of the reworking of the soundtrack under Wintory's direction. Sony has provided Wintory with a version of the game developed by Tricky Pixels that disables the music to allow the ensemble <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>this,</b> and other modifications required for the concert performance. The Kickstarter was launched for $9,000 in funding for a four-city tour, but within a few days already surpassed its funding levels, allowing for more cities to be included.|$|E
