A combination of pulse- chase biosynthetic labeling protocols (using amino acids and sugars), subcellular fractionation, and electron microscope autoradiography was used in conjunction with inhibitors of glycosylation and agents (carboxyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone [CCCP] and monensin) which block Ig exit from the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) or Golgi cisternae. The data are consistent with the following conclusions: (1) Sugar addition and modification occur in three main steps: (a) en bloc addition of core sugars to nascent H chains, (b) partial trimming of these oligosaccharide chains in the RER, (c) quasiconcerted addition of terminal sugars (galactose, fucose, and sialic acid) in a very distal compartment between monensin-sensitive Golgi cisternae and the cell surface.

40|$|Experimental and {{numerical}} {{studies have}} been conducted to investigate the effect of microstructural fabric parameters such as major axis orientation, contact normal and branch vector distributions on dynamic load transfer behavior in two dimensional granular material. The experimental method utilizes the combination of high speed photography and dynamic photoelasticity to study the local load transfer behavior in granular assemblies subjected to explosive loading. Numerical studies employed a computational scheme based on the discrete element method. Results indicate that the microstructural fabric has significant effect on the load transfer phenomenon, such as stress wave velocity, load pulse wavelength and contact load attenuation. ^ An experimental investigation was also conducted to compare and contrast the dynamic load transfer process in single <b>chain</b> <b>assemblies</b> of two and three dimensional particles. The comparison shows that the average pulse velocity in disks is higher than in spheres and the pulse attenuation is lower in the disks. The results also show that there is a characteristic pulse which will propagate through a single chain of disks without significant dispersion. The characteristic pulse propagating in assemblies of spheres, however, shows dispersion. For both disks and spheres, when the input pulse is sufficiently long, it undergoes a ringing process which breaks the long pulse up into smaller signals of size approximately equal to the characteristic length. ^ Stress wave propagation phenomenon in granular assemblies of concave-convex particles was then studied. In particular, attention was focused on the effect of contact profile and granular media porosity on inter-granular load transfer, wave velocity, and wavelength of a stress wave. The stress wave was generated by an explosive loading. The experimental results indicate that the stress wave travels faster in the single <b>chain</b> <b>assemblies</b> with higher contact stiffness, which changes with the variation of contact profile. Also, stress wave propagates faster in single <b>chain</b> <b>assemblies</b> with lower porosity. Contact profile does not appear to change wavelength.

We screened all budding yeast E 2 s as APC coenzymes in vitro and found that two, Ubc 4 and Ubc 1, are the key E 2 partners for the APC. These proteins display strikingly different but complementary enzymatic behaviors: Ubc 4 supports the rapid monoubiquitination of multiple lysines on APC targets, while Ubc 1 catalyzes K 48 -linked polyubiquitin <b>chain</b> <b>assembly</b> on preattached ubiquitins. Mitotic APC function is lost in yeast strains lacking both Ubc 1 and Ubc 4. E 2 - 25 K, a human homolog of Ubc 1, also promotes APC-dependent chain extension on preattached ubiquitins.
