40|$|A major {{limitation}} in any high-performance {{digital communication}} {{system is the}} linearity region of the <b>transmitting</b> <b>amplifier.</b> Nonlinearities typically lead to signal clipping. Efficient communication in such conditions requires maintaining a low peak-to-average power ratio (PAR) in the transmitted signal while achieving a high throughput of data. Excessive PAR leads either to frequent clipping or to inadequate resolution in the analog-to-digital or digital-to-analog converters.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} system design and circuit {{implementation}} of a 24 GHz-band short-range radar receiver in CMOS technology. The propagation and penetration properties of EM wave offer the possibility of non-contact based remote sensing and through-the-wall imaging of distance stationary or moving objects. The feasibility of realizing these concepts in hardware with a small form factor could accelerate commercialization and initiate new product opportunities. Minimizing the receiver power consumption to the 15 mW range enables 4 hours of continuous operation from a 1. 2 gram button sized lithium battery. CMOS technology {{has the potential for}} realization of both the RF transceiver and baseband processor in a single chip. An understanding of the functional requirements is a prerequisite for system optimization. The 15 mW power budget necessitates the continuous nature of FMCW radar configuration, which obviates the requirement for a power-hungry <b>transmitting</b> <b>amplifier.</b> FMCW radar in short-range applications benefits from the phase noise correlation between transmitted and received waveforms, which may be exploited to lower the power consumption of the LO generation circuits. A choice for the heterodyne receiver architecture mitigates erroneous detection due to second-order intermodulation distortions caused by interfering radar transmitters nearby, accuracy degradation due to frequency pulling of the ultra-wideband VCO, and signal quality degradation due to flicker noise generated by CMOS transistors. The power dissipation and hardware overhead of a heterodyne receiver are relaxed by proper frequency planning and elimination of the image-reject filter due to frequency chirping property of the FMCW signal. A frequency downconverter for the radar receiver is realized by integrating a LNA, a Gilbert-type mixer, and a VCO running at the carrier frequency. A varactorless frequency tuning scheme is proposed for the VCO which breaks through the conventional trade-offs seen in continuous and wideband mm-wave frequency generation between capacitance tuning ratio, quality factor, and operating frequency in CMOS design. Inductive frequency tuning is enabled by a transformer resonant tank which exploits the gyration (90 degree) across the input/output terminal voltages of a transconductor. The parallel resonant frequency is controlled by sweeping the sign and magnitude of the transconductance. The VCO is frequency-agile, and is continuously tunable by altering the DC bias current of the transconductance cell. Adaptability between frequency tuning and power consumption is possible. Two VCO test circuits are reported in this thesis. (1) A proof of concept in 0. 13 um RF-CMOS consumes 43 mW from a 1. 2 V supply. The frequency coverage is from 23. 2 GHz to 29. 4 GHz (23. 6 % tunable range) and the phase noise is - 92. 6 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz frequency offset. (2) A miniaturized prototype is implemented in 90 nm CMOS for the radar receiver. It consumes 5. 7 mW from a 1. 0 V supply. Its maximum frequency range is from 18. 6 GHz to 21. 2 GHz (13. 1 % tunable range) and phase noise is at 1 MHz frequency offset. Operation of a CMOS LNA in the moderate inversion region and at a frequency approaching the transistor's operational limit deteriorates its power gain and noise figure. A two-step LNA optimization algorithm is proposed in this thesis which addresses both the device and circuit levels. Transistor dimensions and biasing are set for optimal power gain, noise figure, linearity, bandwidth, and matching network loss. Partitioning the limited power budget across multiple gain stages maximizes the overall power gain. Optimizing the transistor's interaction with bilateral power flows in a multi-stage amplifier is facilitated by Smith chart based visualization and a computer-aided design methodology. The advantages of this methodology are demonstrated by design examples. Current-feedback by a 3 -port transformer in a cascode LNA is proposed in this thesis in order to increase the power gain and lower the noise figure performance under low-power conditions. The feedback modifies the relationship between the input referred voltage and current noise sources of a common-gate MOS transistor, and thereby fulfills the internal interface impedance conditions in the cascode LNA for optimal power gain and noise figure matching. A two-stage, single-ended, current-feedback cascode LNA prototype is realized in 90 nm CMOS. Physical implementation with multiple magnetic components, signal integrity associated with current return path, and circuit simulations employing an S-parameter model are addressed and emphasized in the LNA development. Consuming just 3 mW from a 1 V supply, the LNA achieves 14. 5 dB peak power gain, a - 3 dB gain bandwidth of 5. 0 GHz. The noise figure varies from 4. 9 dB to 5. 6 dB across a 22 GHz and 26 GHz RF bandwidth, and the IIP 3 is - 6. 0 dBm. The frequency downconverter is realized by integrating the inductive-tuned VCO and current-feedback LNA with a differential Gilbert-type mixer. Isolation of the LNA single-ended current return path {{from the rest of the}} receiver is maintained by a 8 -port transformer balun preceding the mixer. This receiver RF front-end draws 10. 7 mW from a 1. 0 V supply, and delivers 12. 6 dB peak power gain, - 3 dB bandwidth of 1. 25 GHz. The noise figure varies from 10. 6 dB to 11. 5 dB across the RF bandwidth, and the IIP 3 of the downconverter is - 12. 1 dBm.

It is shown by using Monte Carlo simulations how the downlink carrier to interference ratio depends on the frequency reuse distance and on the MCPA linearity measured as its noise power ratio (NPR). For reuse factor one systems, which is made possible by use of multibeam antennas, the linear co-channel interference dominates the interference.

40|$|Use of {{companding}} for peak-to-average-power ratio (PAPR) {{control is}} explored for a link involving a non-linear <b>transmit</b> power <b>amplifier</b> with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). Specifically, {{the objective of}} the study was to determine if companding using u-law compression/expansion at the transmitter/receiver, respectively, provides end-to-end performance gains relative to a system without companding. We consider the use of companding to ameliorate the impact of nonlinearities in the <b>transmit</b> <b>amplifier.</b> In the absence of companding, transmitter operation near saturation raises the signal level at the receiver but, because of the nonlinearities in the amplifier response, also results in distortion that impacts overall link performance. As the transmit power is backed-off from saturation, amplifier distortion is reduced, but error components due to lower SNR at the receiver become more significant. When companding is introduced in the system, the system is able to operate closer to saturation without substantial transmit distortion. However, requisite expansion of the compressed signal at the receiver yields noise amplification which can counteract any of the performance gains that would otherwise accrue from the increased SNR at the receiver. At issue is whether or not operating conditions exist (e. g., backoff, SNR, amplifier linearity model, etc) for which companding enhances the end-to-end performance relative to the link performance without companding. System simulation models were employed using Rapp’s nonlinear power amplification models, where average symbol distance errors were used as performance metrics.

Both measurement results and theoretical analysis are presented. New transmit strategies are derived and compared to existing transmit strategies, such as beamforming and space time block coding (STBC). It is found that the best transmission algorithm is largely dependent on the channel characteristics, such as the number of transmit and receive antennas and the existence of a line of sight component. Rayleigh fading multiple input multiple output (MIMO) channels are studied using an eigenvalue analysis and exact expressions for the bit error rates and outage capacities for beamforming and STBC is found. In general are MIMO fading channels correlated and there exists a mutual coupling between antenna elements. These findings are supported by indoor MIMO measurements. It is found that the mutual coupling can, in some scenarios, increase the outage capacity. An adaptive antenna testbed is used to obtain measurement results for the SIMO channel.

However, the OFDM system also exhibits two weaknesses relative to its single-carrier counterparts: (1) the diversity achieved by the OFDM system can be less than a single-carrier system employing the same error control code in a signaling environment rich in diversity and (2) the baseband transmitted signal can exhibit significant amplitude fluctuation over time, thereby precluding efficient <b>transmit</b> <b>amplifier</b> operation. In this paper, nonstandard multidimensional signal sets matched to the OFDM framework are prescribed that address both of these issues. The proposed signal sets are chosen to maximize the diversity achieved by an uncoded system under a constraint to control the peak-to-mean envelope power ratio (PMEPR) of the baseband transmitted waveform. The cost of employing the proposed signal sets is an increase in decoding complexity, as essentially a small amount of controlled equalization has been added to the receiver; thus, the resulting system {{can be viewed as a}} hybrid between an OFDM system and a standard single-carrier system.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the peak-to-average-power-ratio (PAPR) issue, which {{typically}} affects the digital transmission on power line communication (PLC) systems. In these systems, the power line is exploited as a communication multicarriers channel, where the sub-channels are made mutually independent by using orthogonal frequencies (orthogonal frequency division multiplexing or OFDM). Each component carries a string of bits associated with both amplitude and phase, which then represents the routed information. On the other hand, depending on the phases of the sub-carriers, the OFDM signal which has to be transmitted could present high instantaneous peaks. These peaks could saturate the <b>transmitting</b> <b>amplifiers,</b> modifying {{the shape of the}} OFDM symbol and then affecting its information content. Furthermore, such spikes give rise to electromagnetic compatibility issues for the electric devices. In this paper, the selected mapping (SLM) method is applied to mitigate the PAPR phenomenon.

The determination of the optimal set of phase shifts is a very complex problem, so that the SLM approaches proposed in the literature all resort to iterative algorithms to solve it. On the other hand, as this calculation has to be performed online, both the computational cost and the effect on the bit error rate (BER) cannot be established a priori.
