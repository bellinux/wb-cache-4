5000|$|Historically in Europe, rebar is {{composed}} of mild steel material with a yield strength of approximately 250 MPa (36 ksi). Modern rebar {{is composed}} of high-yield steel, with a yield strength more typically 500 MPa (72.5 ksi). Rebar can be supplied with various grades of ductility. The more ductile steel is capable of absorbing considerably more energy when deformed - a behavior that resists earthquake forces and is used in design. These high yield strength ductile steels are usually produced using the <b>TEMPCORE</b> <b>process,</b> a method of thermomechanical processing. The manufacture of reinforcing steel by re-rolling finished products (e.g. sheets or rails) is not allowed. In contrast to structural steel, rebar steel grades are not harmonized yet across Europe, each country having their own national standards. However some standardization of specification and testing methods exist under EN 10080 and EN ISO 15630: ...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of DSC analysis of steel B 500 SP produced in the process of continuous casting, which is intended for the production reinforcement rods with high ductility. Studies were carried out in the temperature range below 1000 °C in a protective atmosphere of helium during samples heating program. The main objective {{of the study was to}} determine the temperature range of austenite structure formation during heating. As a result of performed experiments: Ac 1 s, Ac 1 f – temperatures of the beginning and finish of the eutectoid transformation, Ac 2 – Curie temperature of the ferrite magnetic transformation and the temperature Ac 3 of transformation of proeutectoid ferrite into austenite were elaborated. Experimental determination of phase transformations temperatures of steel B 500 SP has great importance for production technology of reinforcement rods, because good mechanical properties of rods are formed by the special thermal treatment in <b>Tempcore</b> <b>process...</b>|$|E
