5|$|Following the {{completion}} of I-287's New Jersey portion in 1993, more out-of-state tractor trailer drivers began to use the alignment of Route31 as a toll-free alternative to the New Jersey Turnpike. On July 16, 1999, oversize trucks were banned from using Route31 {{as part of a}} larger statewide ban imposed on New Jersey roads not a part of the National Highway System by then-governor Christine <b>Todd</b> <b>Whitman.</b> The legislation had a significant effect on trucks that followed Route31 as it forced them to use I-287 and the New Jersey Turnpike instead.

Shakur later published an extensive criticism of the NBC segment, which inter-spliced footage of Trooper Foerster's grieving widow with an FBI photo connected to a bank robbery of which Shakur had been acquitted. On March 10, 1998 New Jersey Governor Christine <b>Todd</b> <b>Whitman</b> asked Attorney General Janet Reno to do whatever it would take to return Shakur from Cuba.

The Senate President continued in the legislative role during his/her tenure as the state's acting chief executive, thus giving the person control over executive and legislative authority. The acting governor served either until the next general election, until the governor recovered from his/her injuries, or, if the governor died or resigned less than 16 months before end of the term, {{until the end of the}} term. Richard Codey served as acting governor of New Jersey until January 2006, following the resignation of Jim McGreevey in late 2004.

The road also increased truck traffic on other north–south corridors, such as Route31, from truckers wanting to bypass the New Jersey Turnpike by using these surface roads to get between the I-287 bypass of New York City and I-95 south to Pennsylvania. [...] On July16, 1999, Governor Christine <b>Todd</b> <b>Whitman</b> banned oversize trucks from using roads that {{are not part of the}} National Highway System, such as Route31. Trucks were therefore forced to use I-287 and the New Jersey Turnpike to travel across the state. In the 1990s, high-occupancy vehicle lanes were built along I-287 between Bedminster and Parsippany. These HOV lanes, along with the ones that had been built on I-80, were opened to all traffic in 1998 due to lack of HOV usage, and the state did not have to repay the federal government the $240 million to build the lanes. In 2011, a small section of the northbound side of the highway in Boonton collapsed into the Rockaway River due to Hurricane Irene. Near the end of that year, five people and a dog were killed when a small SOCATA TBM 700 airplane en route to Georgia crashed on the highway near exit33 in Morris Township.|$|E

In a March 2004 report, the inspector general of the agency concluded that the EPA [...] "has not developed a clear vision or a comprehensive strategic plan, and has not established values, goals, expectations, and performance measurements" [...] for environmental justice in its daily operations. Another report in September 2006 found the agency still had failed to review the success of its programs, policies and activities towards environmental justice.
