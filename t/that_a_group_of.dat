5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 18th century, a group of MacAulays migrated to the former counties of Caithness and Sutherland. William Buchanan of Auchmar's 18th-century account of the surname MacAulay stated <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> MacAulays in Caithness claimed to descend from the MacAulays of Ardincaple.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, {{he became}} {{involved}} in a controversy known as the Business Plot, when he told a congressional committee <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> wealthy industrialists were planning a military coup to overthrow Franklin D. Roosevelt, with Butler selected to lead a march of veterans to become dictator, similar to other Fascist regimes at that time. The individuals involved all denied {{the existence of a}} plot and the media ridiculed the allegations. A final report by a special House of Representatives Committee confirmed some of Butler's testimony.|$|E
5|$|Law professors (and brothers) Akhil Reed Amar and Vikram Amar {{defended the}} {{constitutionality}} of such a plan. They proposed <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> states, through legislation, form a compact wherein they agree to give all of their electoral votes to the national popular vote winner, regardless of the balance of votes in their own state. These state laws would only be triggered once the compact included enough states to control {{a majority of the}} electoral college (270 votes), thus guaranteeing that the national popular vote winner would also win the electoral college.|$|E

5|$|Recent {{editions of}} the race have been decided with attacks on the Mur de Huy.

No breakaway had won La Flèche Wallonne since 2003.|$|E
5|$|There is {{no formal}} {{sub-classification}} for the non-standard Type Ia supernovae. It {{has been proposed}} <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> sub-luminous supernovae that occur when helium accretes onto a white dwarf should be classified as Type Iax. This type of supernova may not always completely destroy the white dwarf progenitor and could leave behind a zombie star.|$|E
5|$|This {{research}} has shown that there was a single origin of ectomycorrhizal symbiosis in the Amanita genus.

5|$|After all the {{interviews}} concluded, {{the group of}} 208 men were convicted in summary courts-martial of disobeying orders, Article 4 of the Articles for the Government of the United States Navy (Rocks and Shoals). Each man was subject to forfeiture of three months' pay. A few of them were held as witnesses in the upcoming mutiny trial. The rest were split into smaller groups and shipped out to various places in the Pacific Theater. Carl Tuggle, one of the 208, said in 1998 <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> prisoners including himself were assigned menial tasks such as cleaning latrines and picking up cigarette butts at a series of Pacific islands. After returning from active duty they each received bad conduct discharges, which meant the loss of virtually all veterans' benefits.|$|E
5|$|An {{increasingly}} popular conspiracy theory among American right-wing populists {{is that the}} hypothetical North American Union and the amero currency, proposed by the Council on Foreign Relations and its counterparts in Mexico and Canada, {{will be the next}} milestone in the implementation of the New World Order. The theory holds <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> shadowy and mostly nameless international elites are planning to replace the federal government of the United States with a transnational government. Therefore, conspiracy theorists believe the borders between Mexico, Canada and the United States {{are in the process of}} being erased, covertly, by a group of globalists whose ultimate goal is to replace national governments in Washington, D.C., Ottawa and Mexico City with a European-style political union and a bloated E.U.-style bureaucracy.|$|E
5|$|Captain Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks) notifies Lieutenant Commander Jadzia Dax (Terry Farrell) <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> Trill {{scientists}} will be arriving soon at Deep Space Nine to perform experiments related to wormhole physics. The Trill are a species formed {{of both a}} humanoid host and a symbiont, which are implanted into them. The symbionts live far longer than the hosts, and are {{moved into a new}} host when the old one dies. Jadzia is the eighth host of the Dax symbiont. Sisko tells Dax that the head scientist is Lenara Kahn (Susanna Thompson), and offers to grant Dax a leave of absence while the Trill scientists are aboard, but she turns it down. Upon Dax and Kahn's first meeting, Major Kira Nerys (Nana Visitor) notices that they are very familiar with each other; Dax tells her that Kahn used to be her wife. Dr. Julian Bashir (Alexander Siddig) later informs Kira about the non-association rules that Trill follow regarding the family and friends of former hosts, and says that hosts of the Dax and Kahn symbionts have previously been married to each other.|$|E

5|$|In November 1934, Butler {{told the}} {{committee}} that one Gerald P. MacGuire told him <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> businessmen, supposedly backed by a private army of 500,000 ex-soldiers and others, intended to establish a fascist dictatorship. Butler {{had been asked to}} lead it, he said, by MacGuire, who was a bond salesman with Grayson M–P Murphy & Co. The New York Times reported that Butler had told friends that General Hugh S. Johnson, former head of the National Recovery Administration, was to be installed as dictator, and that the J.P. Morgan banking firm was behind the plot. Butler told Congress that MacGuire had told him the attempted coup was backed by three million dollars, and that the 500,000 men were probably to be assembled in Washington, D.C. the following year. All the parties alleged to be involved publicly said there was no truth in the story, calling it a joke and a fantasy.|$|E
5|$|In late antiquity, {{historic}} accounts {{become much}} more diffuse, and the Iazyges generally cease to be mentioned as a tribe. In the late 4thcentury, two Sarmatian peoples were mentioned, the Argaragantes and the Limigantes, who lived {{on opposite sides of}} the Tisza river. One theory is that these two tribes were formed when the Iazyges were conquered by the Roxolani, with the Iazyges becoming the Limigantes, and the Roxolani becoming the Argaragantes. Another theory is <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> Slavic tribesmen gradually migrated into the area, subservient to the Iazyges, and the Iazyges became known as the Argaragantes, and the Slavs were the Limigantes. Regardless of which is true, in the 5th century both of them were conquered by the Goths, and, by the time of Attila, they were absorbed into the Huns.|$|E
5|$|Later in the advance, Maxwell learnt from an English-speaking {{prisoner}} <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> Germans in {{the adjacent}} post wished to surrender, but were afraid to give themselves up. Accompanied by two privates and the prisoner—who was {{to act as an}} interpreter—Maxwell approached the post. The three Australians, however, were immediately surrounded by a group of twenty German soldiers and disarmed. They seemed set to become prisoners themselves, before an artillery barrage fell on the position. Taking advantage of the resulting confusion, Maxwell pulled out a concealed revolver and shot two of the Germans before escaping with his men under heavy rifle fire; one of the privates was subsequently wounded. Organising a party of men, he immediately attacked and captured the post.|$|E

5|$|Later, Weed {{encounters}} a dog named Yukimura, and learns <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> monkeys have been terrorizing the area. Leading them is Shōgun, a vicious baboon that feeds on young monkeys and puppies. Shōgun had previously attacked Yukimura and his family, permanently damaging his adopted father Saheiji. Weed, his comrades, Yukimura, and several rebellious monkeys attack Shōgun and his followers. Yukimura {{is able to}} injure Shōgun enough to ensure his death, but dies in the process. Saheiji reveals that Yukimura was Weed's brother: Sakura, too sick to care for all of her children, had given two of her puppies to Saheiji to raise as foster sons.|$|E
5|$|On 1 June Governor King issued {{directions}} for Integritys second voyage. With Lieutenant Houstoun again in command, the cutter was to transport Lieutenant-Colonel William Paterson {{to the north}} of Van Diemen's Land in order to found a new settlement at Port Dalrymple. To support the settlement, the cutter was also assigned to carry nineteen soldiers of the New South Wales Corps, a ship's surgeon and ten convicts. A further fifteen soldiers and eleven convicts would accompany the expedition aboard a privately owned vessel, Contest. Once Paterson had disembarked at Port Dalrymple, Integrity was to follow the coastline of Port Phillip Bay so that Houstoun could survey the shore and determine its suitability for future colonisation. The cutter would then proceed to Cape Barren Island, a remote location in Bass Strait, to investigate rumours <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> American sailors were establishing an unlawful trade in seal skins.|$|E
5|$|Square Enix {{has stated}} that the trade of items for real {{currency}} is officially {{a violation of the}} Terms of Service for Final Fantasy XI. In early 2006, Square Enix discovered <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> players had found a way to generate game currency and exchange it for real currency, which, in turn, drove up prices for all items across the game. In response, 700 accounts were permanently banned and 300billion gil was removed from circulation. In July 2006, Square Enix banned or suspended over 8,000 other accounts for similar manipulation and commerce. Since 2006, Square Enix has regularly banned accounts found to be in violation of the terms, some of them using third-party tools, effectively removing billions of gil from the in-game economy.|$|E

5|$|The word lesbian {{is derived}} from the name of the Greek island of Lesbos, home to the 6th-century BCE poet Sappho. From various ancient writings, historians {{gathered}} <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> young women were left in Sappho's charge for their instruction or cultural edification. Little of Sappho's poetry survives, but her remaining poetry reflects the topics she wrote about: women's daily lives, their relationships, and rituals. She focused on the beauty of women and proclaimed her love for girls. Before the mid-19th century, the word lesbian referred to any derivative or aspect of Lesbos, including a type of wine.|$|E
5|$|Matthias {{was staying}} in Moravia {{when he was}} {{informed}} <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> Hungarian prelates and barons had offered the throne to Casimir, a younger son of King Casimir IV of Poland. The conspiracy was initiated by Archbishop John Vitéz and his nephew Janus Pannonius, Bishop of Pécs, who opposed war against the Catholic Vladislaus Jagiellon. Initially, their plan {{was supported by the}} majority of the Estates, but nobody dared to rebel against Matthias, enabling him to return to Hungary without resistance. Matthias held a Diet and promised to refrain from levying taxes without the consent of the Estates and to convoke the Diet in each year. His promises remedied most of the Estates' grievances and almost 50 barons and prelates confirmed their loyalty to him on 21 September. Casimir Jagiellon invaded on 2 October 1471. With Bishop Janus Pannonius's support, he seized Nyitra (now Nitra in Slovakia), but only two barons, John Rozgonyi and Nicholas Perényi, joined him. Within five months Prince Casimir withdrew from Hungary, Bishop Janus Pannonius died while fleeing, and Archbishop John Vitéz was forbidden to leave his see. Matthias appointed the Silesian Johann Beckensloer to administer the Archdiocese of Esztergom. Vitéz died and Beckensloer succeeded him in a year.|$|E
5|$|The royal {{pages were}} {{adolescent}} boys {{and young men}} conscripted from aristocratic households and serving the kings of Macedonia perhaps from the reign of Philip II onward, although more solid evidence for {{their presence in the}} royal court dates to the reign of Alexander the Great. Royal pages played no direct role in high politics and were conscripted as a means to introduce them to political life. After a period of training and service, pages were expected to become members of the king's companions and personal retinue. During their training, pages were expected to guard the king as he slept, supply him with horses, aid him in mounting his horse, accompany him on royal hunts, and serve him during symposia (i.e. formal drinking parties). While conscripted pages would have looked forward to a lifelong career at court or even a prestigious post as a governor, they can also be regarded as hostages held by the royal court in order to ensure the loyalty and obedience of their aristocratic fathers. The abusive punishment of pages, such as flogging, carried out by the king at times, led to intrigue and conspiracy against the Crown, as did the frequent homosexual relations between the pages and the elite, sometimes with the king. Although there is little evidence for royal pages throughout the Antigonid period, it is known <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> them fled with Perseus of Macedon to Samothrace following his defeat by the Romans in 168 BC.|$|E
