5|$|The {{first phase}} of the project removed a parking lot that covered a two-block section of <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>in</b> the Getty Square {{neighborhood}} of downtown Yonkers. Ground was broken on December 15, 2010, and the work was completed in December 2011. Work on the second phase, to expose <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>in</b> the Mill Street Courtyard, began on March 19, 2014 and was completed by August 2016. The project stimulated real estate investment in the area.|$|E

5|$|American captain Robert Gray and British captain George Vancouver, who {{explored}} <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>in</b> 1792, {{proved that}} it was possible to cross the Columbia Bar. Many of the challenges associated with that feat remain today; even with modern engineering alterations to the mouth of the river, the strong currents and shifting sandbar make it dangerous to pass between the river and the Pacific Ocean.|$|E

5|$|As {{early as}} 1527 there are records of watermills on <b>the</b> <b>river.</b> <b>In</b> the 17th and 18thcenturies, {{there were several}} watermills which ground corn and made paper, with 13 mills on the Yeo at the peak, declining to seven by 1791 and just three by 1915.|$|E
5|$|Beginning August 5, these {{divisions}} initiated numerous crossing {{attempts to}} assault the UN {{forces on the}} other side of <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>in</b> an attempt to capture Taegu and collapse the final UN defensive line. The U.S. forces were successful in repelling North Korean advances thanks to training and support, but forces in the South Korean sectors were not as successful.

2500|$|Most of <b>the</b> <b>rivers</b> <b>in</b> Hainan {{originate}} in the central area of the island and flow radially in different directions. <b>The</b> Wanning <b>River</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{southern part of the}} island is <b>the</b> largest <b>river</b> surrounding Hainan.

5|$|By {{the early}} 20thcentury, major river-control {{projects}} {{had begun to}} take place. Levees were constructed along <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>in</b> most urban areas, and Portland built concrete walls to protect its downtown sector. In the following decades, many large dams were built on Cascade Range tributaries of the Willamette. The Army Corps of Engineers operates 13 such dams, which affect flows from about 40percent of the basin. Most {{of them do not}} have fish ladders.|$|E
5|$|Despite this reserve, early {{settlers}} {{extended their}} fences to <b>the</b> <b>river.</b> <b>In</b> 1791, the Land Board ordered that the fences be removed {{to permit the}} reserve's use as a public road. The Niagara Road quickly became the primary route between Fort Erie and Fort George. Its importance grew with the declaration of war against the Americans in June 1812. During the war, the road became vital for the movement of militia and supplies, and accordingly {{it was one of}} the primary frontiers of the war.|$|E

5|$|The city's {{land was}} {{acquired}} by the United States {{in a series of}} treaties and purchases negotiated with the Mdewakanton band of the Dakota and separately with European nations.

In 1805, Zebulon Pike purchased two tracts of land from the Dakota Indians. One tract was located at the mouth of the St. Croix River, while a second, larger tract ran from the confluence of the Minnesota and Mississippi Rivers to St. Anthony Falls, with a width of nine miles (14km) east and west of <b>the</b> <b>river.</b> <b>In</b> return, he distributed about $200 in trading goods and sixty gallons of liquor, and promised a further payment from the United States government.

5|$|The paper {{industry}} {{took off in}} Kajaani in the early 20th century in particular.

Kajaani Oy was eventually acquired by Valmet in 1983, and the subsidiary Kajaani Electronics was formed.
