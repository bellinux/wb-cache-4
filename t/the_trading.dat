40|$|Abstract: This paper {{examines}} {{the issue of}} whether harmonising taxes across <b>the</b> <b>traded</b> and nontraded sectors is desirable. Preferential treatment for <b>the</b> <b>traded</b> sector might be justified if either the output response of subsidies are higher in <b>the</b> <b>traded</b> sector or if the jobs generated in <b>the</b> <b>traded</b> sector are “better ” than those in the non-traded sector. I examine these two issues using a simple two sector small open economy model to analyse the first question and input-output analysis to analyse the second. I conclude that there is no compelling argument for lower taxes on <b>the</b> <b>traded</b> sector. ...|$|R
