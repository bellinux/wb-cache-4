40|$|International audienceCarbon fibre plates (20 x 5 mm) were characterised by {{scanning}} {{electron microscopy}} (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray-induced photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The 90 degrees peeling test was used (0. 5 mm s(- 1)) at the carbon fibre Panavia F-(R) interface. The fracture interfaces were analysed using both SEM and EDS. Panavia F-(R) was characterised from the theological point of view using a plate-plate fixture fitted on the Stress <b>Tech((R))</b> Rheometer. The fracture patterns were mixed, cohesive in the adhesive or interfacial between the adhesive and the carbon fibre plates. The presence of Panavia F-(R) between the carbon fibres was demonstrated on the fracture interfaces (EDS analyses) lending weight to the theory that this adhesive was mechanically retained on composite plates. Even so, {{the fact that the}} presence of O=C bonds was shown opened up the possibility of a chemical bond between the primary and the composite material...|$|E

Gperating {{on the principle of}} the free electron laser (FEL), the LCLS would extend the range of FEL operation to much shorter wavelength than the 240 mn that has so far been reached. We report the tesults of studies of the use of the SLAC linac to drive an LCLS at wavelengths from about 3 - 100 mn initially and possibly even shorter wavelengths in the fare. Lasing would be achieved in a single pass of a low emittance, high peak current, high energy electron beam through a long undulator. Most present FELs use an optical cavity to build up the intensity of the light to achieve lasing action in a low gain oscillator configuration. By eliminating the optical cavity, which is difficult to make at short wavelengths, laser action can be extended to shorter wavelengths by Self-Ampli&d-SpomaneousEmission (SASE), or by hatmonic generation from a longer wavelength seed laser. Short wavelength, single pass lasers have been extensively studied at severalaboratories and at recent workshops [5, 6]...|$|E
