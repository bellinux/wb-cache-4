As a halakhic movement we look to precedent to find the tools with which to shape the Torah. For the most part, we rely on the strategies of old.

25|$|A very {{different}} reason for Kol Nidre was {{suggested by the}} Zohar; God has already threatened and vowed terrible punishments upon the Jewish people for their sins, but by our own demonstration that we can unbind ourselves from vows using Kol Nidre we hope to persuade God to similarly annul His own vows of calamity. As stated in the Orot Sephardic mahzor: According to the holy Zohar, Kol Nidre is recited on Yom Kippur because, at times, the Heavenly judgment is handed down as an 'avowed decree' for which there can normally be no annulment. By reciting the Kol Nidre annulment of vows at this <b>time,</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> asking of God that He favor us by annuling any negative decrees of judgment that await us, even though we are undeserving of such annulment.|$|E

500|$|According to International Business Times India, {{the film}} {{received}} positive feedback from critics. Ranjani Rajendra of The Hindu called the film a [...] "compelling thriller {{that does not}} disappoint", adding that what the film [...] "boils down to is two sets of parents desperate to ensure their children's wellbeing and makes for a good watch". Sandhya Rao of Sify stated, [...] "For {{the first time in}} Telugu cinema do we see such an intense film.

500|$|Finally, Duerr {{once again}} criticises the {{approach}} of Western society and its anthropologists to studying [...] "archaic" [...] spiritual beliefs. He asserts that in these [...] "archaic" [...] cultures, people [...] "have a much clearer idea {{about the fact that}} we can not be only what we are if at the same <b>time,</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> also what we are not, and that we can only know who we are if we experience our boundaries". He denounces Western scientists and anthropologists for their approaches to the study of such cultures, arguing that they have misrepresented them by attempting to fit them within the Western ideas of objectivity. He argues that in future, anthropologists must reach their own boundaries, and recognize the wilderness of their consciousness before they can truly understand the worldview of [...] "archaic" [...] humans.|$|E
500|$|The Senate {{vetoed the}} text {{submitted}} by the Congress. The veto was proposed by the People's Party, which held {{the majority of the}} seats, and by the Democratic Union of Catalonia, and was approved by 131 [...] "yes" [...] and 119 [...] "no" [...] votes and 2 abstentions. As a result, the text was sent back to the Congress. On 30 June 2005, it was approved by Congress, which, in accordance with the constitutional provisions, overrode the Senate veto. This was achieved with 187 [...] "yes" [...] votes (including a member of the People's Party, Celia Villalobos), 147 [...] "no" [...] votes, and four abstentions. The veto override implied its approval as law. The vote was held after Zapatero unexpectedly took the floor of Parliament to speak in its support, saying We are expanding the opportunities for happiness of our neighbors, our colleagues, our friends and our relatives. At the same <b>time,</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> building a more decent society. Mariano Rajoy, the leader of the opposition People's Party, was denied the opportunity to address Parliament after Zapatero's appearance, and accused Zapatero of dividing Spanish society.|$|E
500|$|In July 1996, Radiohead started rehearsing and {{recording}} OK Computer in their Canned Applause studio, a converted shed near Didcot, Oxfordshire. Even without the deadline {{that contributed to}} the stress of The Bends, the band still had difficulties, which Selway blamed on their choice to self-produce: [...] "We're jumping from song to song, and when we started to run out of ideas, we'd move on to a new song... The stupid thing was that we were nearly finished when we'd move on, because so much work had gone into them." [...] The members worked with nearly equal roles in the production and formation of the music, though Yorke was still firmly [...] "the loudest voice" [...] according to O'Brien. Selway said [...] "we give each other an awful lot of space to develop our parts, but at the same <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> all very critical about what the other person is doing." [...] Godrich's role as co-producer was part collaborator, part managerial outsider. He said that Radiohead [...] "need to have another person outside their unit, especially when they're all playing together, to say when the take goes well... I take up slack when people aren't taking responsibility—the term producing a record means taking responsibility for the record... It's my job to ensure that they get the ideas across." [...] Godrich has produced every Radiohead album since, and has been characterised as Radiohead's [...] "sixth member", an allusion to George Martin's nickname as the [...] "fifth Beatle".|$|E

[...] "I really, really, really want to see where [...] is. I just {{want to know what happened}} to her and where she went and what she's doing now. My idea is that she actually like figures it out, and finds some success and does really well in a different hospital. She was always floundering you know, and so she was always one step behind the eight ball and I want to see that girl take some power back." [...] She later went on to say that she regrets leaving the show, [...] "Oh yeah, sometimes, yeah. You miss it. I miss my friends. It was a great work environment ... and it becomes a family. I spent six years together with these people every day ... you grow up together, in a way," [...] and again commented on Izzie possibly returning to the show, [...] "I always felt that if they wanted me to come back and sort of wrap up that storyline ... I want them to know that I'm down with it if they want me to, but I completely understand if it doesn't necessarily work ... They've got a lot of story lines going on there." [...] But in March 2012, Shonda Rhimes said that there are no plans at the moment for the character to return, [...] "I think it was really nice to hear her appreciating the show. At the same <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> on a track we have been planning. The idea of changing that track is not something we are interested in right now." [...] Three years later, Rhimes said she has completely moved on from the idea of Izzie coming back, “I’m done with that story. I’ve turned that idea over in my mind a thousand times and thought about how it would go. And I don’t think so.” ...|$|E

[...] In their 2004 song [...] "Average Girl", the three sisters likened themselves to Princess Aurora from Sleeping Beauty, falling into a deep sleep and resting in God until He sends a prince their way.
