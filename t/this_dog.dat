5|$|An {{important}} attribute in <b>this</b> <b>dog</b> was a tempered aggressiveness {{that would}} provide the necessary drive to pursue and bolt the fox, without resulting in physical harm to the quarry and effectively ending the chase, which was considered unsporting. Russell {{was said to have}} prided himself that his terriers never tasted blood. This line of terriers developed by John Russell was well respected for those qualities, and his dogs were often taken on by hunt enthusiasts. It is unlikely, however, that any dogs alive today can be proven to be descendants from Trump, as Russell was forced to sell all his dogs {{on more than one occasion}} because of financial difficulty, and had only four aged (and non-breeding) terriers left when he died in 1883.|$|E

25|$|A Bloodhound named Nick Carter is {{frequently}} {{cited as the}} archetype of the trailing Bloodhound and the extensive publicity <b>this</b> <b>dog</b> received may {{be the source of}} much bloodhound-related folklore.

25|$|This giant breed matures {{slowly in}} both mind and body, taking {{anywhere}} from 2 to 3 years. The objective in training <b>this</b> <b>dog</b> {{is for the}} owner to build trust through humane methods. As youngsters, they can be quite boisterous and they do require steady and reliable training to develop manners and physical self-control. As with all large, active working dogs, this breed should be well socialized early in life with other dogs and people, and be provided with regular activity and training.|$|E
25|$|The Wolfhound {{of today}} {{is far from}} the one that struck fear into the hearts of the Ancient Romans. Irish Wolfhounds are often favored for their loyalty, affection, {{patience}} and devotion. Although at some points in history they have been used as watchdogs, unlike some breeds, the Irish Wolfhound is usually unreliable in this role as they are often friendly toward strangers, although their size can be a natural deterrent. However, when protection is required <b>this</b> <b>dog</b> is never found wanting. When they or their family are in any perceived danger they display a fearless nature. Author and Irish Wolfhound breeder Linda Glover believes the dogs' close affinity with humans makes them acutely aware and sensitive to ill will or malicious intentions leading to their excelling as a guardian rather than guard dog.|$|E

500|$|Whippets were bred to hunt by sight, {{coursing}} game in open {{areas at}} high speeds. One can find numerous representations of small greyhound-like hounds in art {{dating back to}} Ancient Egyptian times. Pharaohs bred a small sighthound dog related to the greyhound to keep in their palaces, and <b>this</b> <b>dog</b> may be the ancestor of today's Whippets. [...] In medieval England, a small greyhound breed became popular {{for use as a}} ratting dog. The first written English use of the word whippet with regard to a type of dog was in 1610. However, the first dog to be called a Whippet was actually a greyhound-spaniel cross and {{has little to do with}} the modern Whippet.|$|E
500|$|Dr. Fred J. Pfeifer, from New London, Wisconsin, set up Wolf River Kennels {{in order}} to save the breed. Numbers held by the kennel fluctuated but at times went up to 132 dogs.

Part of a sales pitch that Pfeifer mailed to {{prospective}} dog owners read, [...] "The American Brown Spaniel is distinctively an American production. Hunters have known this type for years and it was through their efforts that <b>this</b> <b>dog</b> was propagated.... For years we have bred only selective stock, breeding for gameness, stability, courage, intelligence, and beauty.

500|$|Sergeant Stubby, a part bull terrier and a {{decorated}} World War I war dog, came to campus in 1921 with J. Robert Conroy who was attending Georgetown Law at the time. The school football team used Stubby {{as a popular}} halftime show where he would push a football across the field, which established him as a campus celebrity. After Stubby died in 1926, the team then chose a female bull terrier named Jazz Bo, who {{had been brought to}} campus by Georgetown College student Paul Van Laanen. Jazz Bo was retitled [...] "Hoya" [...] by the students, after the traditional [...] "Hoya Saxa" [...] school cheer.

500|$|A bitch puppy, the runt of the litter, was {{purchased}} for Â£48 in 1923 {{and she became}} Nagle's first dog to gain the title of Champion. Named Sulhamstead Thelma, she was declared the best Irish Wolfhound bitch and awarded the Challenge Certificate at three consecutive Crufts, in 1925, 1926 and 1927. Her next Champion was Sulhamstead Conncara, a male dog, born in 1925. Conncara was blind, possibly owing to an accident as a young puppy, but Nagle kept that secret until three years after his death, believing that his qualities would have been overlooked by other breeders if they had known. According to Nagle's biographer, Ferelith Somerfield, <b>this</b> <b>dog</b> was [...] "one of the great sires of all time in the breed" [...] and an [...] "outstanding show dog". A prepotent sire, he produced several Champions and other top-class show specimens.|$|E

The costume, first worn by student Pat Sheehan, has been updated numerous times, most recently in 2013.
