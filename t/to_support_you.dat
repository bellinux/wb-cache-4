500|$|When Taylor {{said the}} moves detracted from Hương and Suu's powers, the {{officers}} disagreed {{and said they}} supported the pair in full and that Hương had approved of the HNC's dissolution. Taylor was unimpressed by the reassurances, concluding with [...] "I don't know whether we will continue <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>you</b> after this...You people have broken a lot of dishes {{and now we have}} to see how we can straighten out this mess." [...] Taylor's deputy, U. Alexis Johnson felt the discussion had become counterproductive and was increasing the problem. He suggested that should the generals feel unwilling to alter their position immediately, they should refrain from actions that would preclude a later change of heart. He proposed they merely announce the removal of certain members of the HNC rather than the dissolution of the entire body, hoping the HNC could be reconstituted with figures they deemed to be more satisfactory. The four officers did not give a clear answer to Johnson's idea, indicating they had not made a concrete decision by saying [...] "the door is not closed".|$|E

Two months later Toronto FC became the second MLS team, and the first Canadian soccer team, <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>You</b> Can Play.

2500|$|Khánh's {{quartet of}} delegates responded to Taylor by {{responding}} in a circumlocutory way. They remained calm {{and did not}} resort to direct confrontation. Kỳ said the change was necessary, as [...] "the political situation is worse than it ever was under Diệm". Kỳ explained that the situation mandated {{the dissolution of the}} council, saying [...] "We know you want stability, but you cannot have stability until you have unity". He claimed that some HNC members were disseminating coup rumors and creating doubt among the population and that [...] "both military and civilian leaders regard the presence of these people in the High National Council as divisive of the Armed Forces due to their influence". Kỳ then promised that he would explain the decision at a media conference and that he and his colleagues would return to their military roles in the near future. Thiệu said [...] "I do not see how our action has hurt the Hương government ... Hương now has the full support of the Army and has no worries from the High National Council, which we have eliminated". When Taylor said that the moves detracted from Hương and Sửu's powers, the generals disagreed, and said that they supported the pair in full and that Hương had approved of the deposal of the HNC. Taylor was unimpressed by the reassurances, saying at the meeting's end, [...] "I don't know whether we will continue <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>you</b> after this ... ou people have broken a lot of dishes and now we have to see how we can straighten out this mess".|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{represents}} {{an attempt to}} use empirical methods to analyze the campaign period preceeding the general election of 1965 {{as a way of}} gaining some factual insights into the basic problems which beset the Canadian federation between 1960 and 1965. Data was collected from three basic sources: public opinion surveys, a sample of election candidates, and the editorial columns of twenty Canadian daily newspapers. It is the contention of the author that the 1965 campaign and certain related events constitute a microcosm of the period 1960 - 1965 and that this period represents a unique phase in the history of Canadian federalism. Evidence is adduced to illustrate the essential nature of the twin crises of English-French and federal-provincial relations and <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>thee</b> hypothesis that, while destined to interact, each of these problems had its own independent origin and source of dynamism. Finally, it is argued that, because of increasing regionalism, serious faults within the party system and other factors, neither problem was handled satisfactorily during the period under study...|$|R
