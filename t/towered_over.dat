5|$|Oakland {{became the}} city's {{predominant}} cultural and educational center, including three universities, multiple museums, a library, a music hall, and a botanical conservatory. Oakland's University of Pittsburgh erected what today {{is still the}} world's fourth-tallest educational building, the 42-story Cathedral of Learning. It <b>towered</b> <b>over</b> Forbes Field, where the Pittsburgh Pirates played from 1909–1970.|$|E
5|$|After {{some months}} of travel, Heraclius entered Constantinople in triumph and {{was met by}} the people of the city, his son Heraclius Constantine, and Patriarch Sergius, prostrating {{themselves}} in joy. His alliance with the Persians resulted in the recovery of the Holy Sponge which fastened to the True Cross in an elaborate ceremony on 14 September 629. The ceremonial parade went toward the Hagia Sophia. There, the True Cross was slowly raised up until it vertically <b>towered</b> <b>over</b> the high altar. To many, this was a sign that a new golden age was about to begin for the Byzantine Empire.|$|E
5|$|In the {{practice}} nets, the county players <b>towered</b> <b>over</b> Larwood; the veteran Test batsman George Gunn {{thought he looked}} more like a jockey than a cricketer. At first he bowled badly, and his efforts were unimpressive. As his confidence increased his bowling improved, and committee members began to revise their initial dismissive judgement; when the session ended, Larwood was offered a playing contract. He accepted instantly; the terms were 32 shillings (£1.60) per week—the same as his mining wages—and he was expected, when not playing, to carry out ground staff duties. Robert Larwood was angry that his son had not asked for more generous terms, but according to Hamilton, Harold would have agreed to anything to escape from the mine, even for a single summer.|$|E
50|$|Lemko churches {{most often}} used a three-section design with very tall gabled roofs and a <b>tower</b> <b>over</b> each section, with the <b>tower</b> <b>over</b> the {{entrance}} being the tallest. Topping each tower is a spire, resembling a Gothic spire, albeit constructed in Ukrainian style.|$|R

5|$|Following {{the power}} {{struggle}} after Stalin's death in 1953, Nikita Khrushchev {{emerged as the}} country's new leader. In a secret speech he gave in 1956, Khrushchev denounced Stalin and his domestic policies largely loosened the government's grip over the country. Khrushchev put more resources into the production of consumer goods and housing. Almost immediately, Armenia underwent a cultural and economic rebirth. Religious freedom, to a limited degree, was granted to Armenia when Catholicos Vazgen I assumed the duties of his office in 1955. One of Khrushchev's advisers and close friends, Armenian Politburo member Anastas Mikoyan, urged Armenians to reaffirm their national identity. In 1954, he gave a speech in Yerevan where he encouraged them to republish the works of writers such as Raffi and Charents. The massive statue of Stalin that <b>towered</b> <b>over</b> Yerevan was pulled down from its pedestal by troops literally overnight and replaced in 1962 with that of Mother Armenia. Contacts between Armenia and the Diaspora were revived, and Armenians from abroad began to visit the republic more frequently.|$|E
25|$|By {{this time}} the {{innovations}} introduced by the Lotus 49 and 72 had changed car design. Fully stressed engine and variable flexibility suspension was now the norm, most cars had wedge shaped bodywork and airboxes <b>towered</b> <b>over</b> driver's heads. The main innovation of this era came in 1975, when the Ferrari 312T appeared, its transverse gearbox allowing better weight distribution.|$|E
25|$|For a {{large portion}} of the 1900s, four massive grain {{elevators}} <b>towered</b> <b>over</b> Willow Bunch. They were owned by United Grain Growers Ltd., Saskatchewan Pool Elevators Ltd., McLaughlin Company Ltd., and McCabe Brothers Grain Co. Ltd. Today, only one elevator remains, built in 1983, originally owned by the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool, and now jointly owned and operated as Prairie Giant Processing Inc. It is used for grain storage and cleaning.|$|E

25|$|The {{spring at}} Banias {{initially}} originated {{in a large}} cave carved out of a sheer cliff face which was gradually lined {{with a series of}} shrines. The temenos (sacred precinct) included in its final phase a temple placed {{at the mouth of the}} cave, courtyards for rituals, and niches for statues. It was constructed on an elevated, 80m long natural terrace along the cliff which <b>towered</b> <b>over</b> the north of the city. A four-line inscription at the base of one of the niches relates to Pan and Echo, the mountain nymph, and was dated to 87 BCE.|$|E
25|$|The highway {{itself was}} planned {{as early as}} the 1920s. The {{above-ground}} Artery was built in two sections. First was the part north of High Street and Broad Street to the Tobin Bridge, built between 1951 and 1954. Immediately, residents began to hate the new highway and the way it <b>towered</b> <b>over</b> and separated neighborhoods. Due to this opposition, {{the southern end of the}} Central Artery through the South Station area was built underground, through what became known as the Dewey Square Tunnel. Eventually, the entire highway was moved underground as part of the Big Dig Project. The Dewey Square Tunnel was the one part of the original Artery not torn down; it now serves southbound traffic. The idea of building the entire Artery underground was first floated in the 1970s emanating from the central artery depression concept developed by the Boston Transportation Planning Review. The final section through the Dewey Square Tunnel and on to the Southeast Expressway at Massachusetts Avenue opened in 1959.|$|E
500|$|Sir John Gielgud, OM, CH ( [...] ; 1904–2000) was an English {{actor and}} theatre director. He {{appeared}} on stage, {{television and radio}} and in film in a career that spanned eight decades.

500|$|There were {{concerns}} about Edward's health as a child, {{and he fell}} ill in 1246, 1247, and 1251. Nonetheless, he became an imposing man; at 6feet 2inches (1.88m) he <b>towered</b> <b>over</b> most of his contemporaries, and hence perhaps his epithet [...] "Longshanks", meaning [...] "long legs" [...] or [...] "long shins". The historian Michael Prestwich states that his [...] "long arms gave him an advantage as a swordsman, long thighs one as a horseman. In youth, his curly hair was blond; in maturity it darkened, and in old age it turned white. [...] His speech, despite a lisp, {{was said to be}} persuasive." ...|$|E
500|$|Since it was {{necessary}} for the art department's interior sets to conform to the effects department's exterior plans, each team closely monitored the other's work. According to Sylvia Anderson, Bell's challenge was to produce complex interiors on a limited budget while resisting the effects department's push for [...] "more extravagant" [...] design. This task was complicated by the unnatural proportions of the puppets: Bell struggled to decide whether the sets should be built to a scale proportionate to their bodies or their oversized heads and hands. He used the example of FAB 1 to illustrate the problem: [...] "As soon as we positioned [...] standing alongside , they looked ridiculous, as the car <b>towered</b> <b>over</b> them." [...] He ultimately adopted a [...] "mix-and-match" [...] approach, in which smaller items, such as tableware, were scaled to their hands and furniture to their bodies.|$|E

500|$|The lodge's {{structure}} {{made it a}} stronghold. [...] The lodge, {{named after}} nearby Mount Asama, was a three-story wood and concrete edifice built {{into the side of}} the hill atop an exposed base of steel-reinforced concrete. [...] The upper floor was slightly larger than the two below, giving the lodge a mushroom appearance. [...] The building <b>towered</b> <b>over</b> the steep, snow-covered slopes below and the lodge's windows had heavy outer storm shutters. The building's maze-like floor plan and narrow staircases made it easy for the defenders to block off movement inside the building. [...] The radicals would spend most of their time on the uppermost floor, which contained a kitchen, dining room, tatami-mat sleeping room, and a commanding view of the surrounding valley and hills. The radicals placed large pieces of furniture and futon bedding around the doors and windows and secured them in place with wire. [...] When Muta's husband returned and saw the barricades he realized what had happened and quickly notified police. [...] The police immediately set up roadblocks and surrounded the lodge to cut off any avenues of escape for the radicals inside.|$|E
500|$|Spiegelman {{rendered}} the original three-page [...] "Maus" [...] and [...] "Prisoner on the Hell Planet" [...] in highly detailed, expressive styles. [...] Spiegelman planned to draw Maus {{in such a}} manner, but after initial sketches he decided to use a pared-down style, one little removed from his pencil sketches, which he found more direct and immediate. [...] Characters are rendered in a minimalist way: animal heads with dots for eyes and slashes for eyebrows and mouths, sitting on humanoid bodies. [...] Spiegelman {{wanted to get away}} from the rendering of the characters in the original [...] "Maus", in which oversized cats <b>towered</b> <b>over</b> the Jewish mice, an approach which Spiegelman says, [...] "tells you how to feel, tells you how to think". [...] He preferred to let the reader make independent moral judgments. [...] He drew the cat-Nazis the same size as the mouse-Jews, and dropped the stereotypical villainous expressions. [...] The contrast between the artwork in [...] "Prisoner on the Hell Planet" [...] and Maus drives home the effectiveness of the simpler artwork—"Prisoner" [...] is alienating, while Maus is more inviting, encouraging deeper contemplation and understanding.|$|E

Adult riders paid 40 cents, children a quarter. The trip up took about a minute and the drop down was over in 10 or 20 seconds. The official 1939 Fair guidebook describes the ride: ...|$|E
