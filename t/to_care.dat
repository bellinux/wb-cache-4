5|$|Coolbrith {{had hoped}} to tour the East Coast and Europe with Miller, but stayed behind in San Francisco because she felt obliged <b>to</b> <b>care</b> for {{her mother and her}} seriously ill, widowed sister Agnes who was unable <b>to</b> <b>care</b> for herself or for her two children. In late 1871 she took on the care of another {{dependent}} when Joaquin Miller brought her a teenaged Indian girl (widely rumored to be his own daughter) <b>to</b> <b>care</b> for while he went abroad again, this time to Brazil and Europe.|$|E

5|$|The {{characters}} were similarly well received. Bob Mackey of 1UP.com and Martin Robinson of Eurogamer called them believable and {{easy for the}} player <b>to</b> <b>care</b> about. IGN's Lucas M. Thomas was satisfied by development of each character, while Mike Manson of Nintendo Life considered each characters' motives to be unique and interesting. In contrast, Boosinger found the characters to be uncompelling and poorly written, and believed {{that there was little}} reason <b>to</b> <b>care</b> for them until their backstories were revealed.|$|E
5|$|The human toll of the Battle of Malvern Hill and the Seven Days Battles {{was shown}} clearly as both capitals, Washington and Richmond, set up {{numerous}} provisional hospitals <b>to</b> <b>care</b> for the dead, wounded and missing. Ships sailed from the Peninsula to Washington carrying the wounded. Richmond was nearest to the battlefields of the Seven Days, and the immense {{number of casualties}} overwhelmed hospitals and doctors. People from about the Confederacy descended upon Richmond <b>to</b> <b>care</b> for the conflict's casualties. Graves could not be dug quickly enough.|$|E

Some may embrace a traditional role of housewife, cooking and cleaning in addition <b>to</b> <b>caring</b> for children. Others see their primary role as that of child-care providers, supporting their children's physical, intellectual, emotional, and spiritual development while sharing or outsourcing other aspects of home care.|$|R

5|$|A {{footbridge}} {{crossing the}} River Pinn and leading to Long Meadow was replaced in 2007; the original {{had been built}} in 1977.

5|$|A {{recent study}} shows that both food {{availability}} and temperature affect the parental incubation of the eggs in northern mockingbirds. Increasing food availability provides the females with more time <b>to</b> <b>care</b> for the nest and perform self-maintenance. Increasing temperature, however, reduces the time the females spend at the nest and there is increased energy cost to cool the eggs. The incubation behavior is a trade-off among various environmental factors.|$|E

5|$|Although Godwin {{was fond}} of his children, he was, in many ways, ill-equipped <b>to</b> <b>care</b> for them. As Todd explains, he was {{constantly}} annoyed by their noise, demanding silence while he worked.

5|$|Although Shetlands {{are small}} and slow-growing {{compared}} to commercial breeds, they are hardy, thrifty, easy lambers, adaptable and long-lived. The Shetland breed has survived for centuries in difficult conditions and on a poor diet, but they thrive in better conditions. Shetlands retain many of their primitive survival instincts, so they are easier <b>to</b> <b>care</b> for than many modern breeds.|$|E

40|$|Control of {{symptoms}} in cancer patients {{on a home}} care program was studied, to identify problems related <b>to</b> <b>caring</b> for these patients at home. The study was based on independent physician assessments of patients' medical charts, as well as interviews with the home care providers. The results showed problems in control of pain, nausea and constipation; the causes were less than optimal care and non-compliance. There is an urgent need <b>to</b> improve palliative <b>care</b> <b>to</b> home <b>care</b> patients and <b>to</b> provide better, more frequent reassessment of patients with uncontrolled symptoms...|$|R
