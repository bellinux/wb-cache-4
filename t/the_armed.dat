5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Armed</b> Forces of Liberia (AFL) are <b>the</b> <b>armed</b> {{forces of}} the Republic of Liberia.

For {{virtually}} all of its history, the AFL has received considerable materiel and training assistance from the United States. For most of the 1941–89 period, training was largely provided by U.S. advisers, though this assistance has not prevented the same generally low levels of effectiveness common to most of <b>the</b> <b>armed</b> forces in the developing world.|$|E

5|$|By the 1980s, Suharto's grip {{on power}} was {{maintained}} by the emasculation of civil society, engineered elections, {{and use of the}} military's coercive powers.

5|$|Denning {{was told}} he would be ineligible to serve in <b>the</b> <b>Armed</b> Forces because of a {{systolic}} heart murmur, which he believed the doctor diagnosed because {{he was tired of}} sending young men off to die.
