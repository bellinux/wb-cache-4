After Shepard's squad returns, the team uses the Omega-4 Relay to reach the Collector base, located in the Galactic Center. The team rescues any surviving Normandy crew members and fights {{their way to the}} central chamber. Squad members will either survive or perish depending on their loyalty to Shepard, the upgrades made to <b>the</b> <b>Normandy,</b> and the tasks they are assigned in battle. In the central chamber, Shepard discovers that the Collectors have been constructing a new Human-Reaper made from the genetic material of the abducted colonists.|$|E

50|$|The {{area around}} Bayeux {{is called the}} Bessin, which was the {{bailiwick}} of <b>the</b> province <b>Normandy</b> until <b>the</b> French Revolution. During the Second World War, Bayeux was the first city of <b>the</b> Battle of <b>Normandy</b> to be liberated, and on 16 June 1944 General Charles de Gaulle made {{the first of two}} major speeches in Bayeux in which he made clear that France sided with the Allies. The buildings in Bayeux were virtually untouched during <b>the</b> Battle of <b>Normandy,</b> <b>the</b> German forces being fully involved in defending Caen from the Allies.|$|R
5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>Normandy</b> {{landings}} many {{of these}} units moved north. Replacements that joined Army Group G came to refit after the fighting in Normandy or on the Eastern Front. They were under strength, {{with little or no}} equipment.|$|E
5|$|By 1798 the British Royal Navy had {{successfully}} contained the French Navy {{within its own}} harbours, employing a strategy of close blockade to ensure dominance at sea during the French Revolutionary Wars. The strategy was particularly effective in the English Channel, where the proximity of British bases and the importance in limiting {{the movements of the}} French invasion forces stationed around Boulogne focused British attention on <b>the</b> <b>Normandy</b> coast. This was essential to prevent the concentration of a large force of invasion barges that had been constructed at various harbours under the guidance of a Captain Muskein. To improve the Royal Navy's ability to observe French movements on <b>the</b> <b>Normandy</b> coast, a force under the command of Captain Sir Sidney Smith seized, garrisoned, and fortified the uninhabited Îles Saint-Marcouf in 1795.|$|E
5|$|By 1944, the Free Belgian {{forces in}} the United Kingdom {{numbered}} some 4,500 men. Belgian soldiers formed the 1st Belgian Infantry Brigade (which also included an artillery battery of soldiers from Luxembourg) more often known as the Brigade Piron after its commanding officer, Jean-Baptiste Piron. The Brigade Piron was involved in <b>the</b> <b>Normandy</b> Invasion and the battles in France and the Netherlands until liberation.|$|E

5|$|During <b>the</b> <b>Normandy</b> {{landings}} of 6 June 1944, {{the brigade}} {{took part in}} Operation Mallard, holding the southern flank of <b>the</b> <b>Normandy</b> bridgehead over the River Orne. In August 1944, during {{the final stages of}} the Battle of Normandy, {{along with the rest of}} the 6th Airborne Division, the brigade took part in the advance to the River Seine. Withdrawn to England in September, the brigade, with the rest of the division, returned to mainland Europe in December to counter the German Army's surprise offensive in the Ardennes, better known as the Battle of the Bulge. Their final airborne mission of the war was Operation Varsity in March 1945, an airborne assault crossing of the Rhine, after which they advanced through Germany, reaching the Baltic Sea at Wismar by the end of the war.|$|E
5|$|Henry's {{network of}} allies in Normandy became {{stronger}} during 1103. Henry married Juliana, {{one of his}} illegitimate daughters, to Eustace of Breteuil, and another illegitimate daughter, Matilda, to Rotrou, the Count of Perche, on <b>the</b> <b>Normandy</b> border. Henry attempted to win over other members of <b>the</b> <b>Normandy</b> nobility and gave other English estates and lucrative offers to key Norman lords. Duke Robert continued to fight Robert of Bellême, but the Duke's position worsened, until by 1104, he had to ally himself formally with Bellême to survive. Arguing that Duke Robert had broken the terms of their treaty, Henry crossed over the Channel to Domfront, where he met with senior barons from across Normandy, eager to ally themselves with the King. Henry confronted his brother and accused him of siding with his enemies, before returning to England.|$|E
5|$|In 1944 the Allies finally {{focused on}} France and the Western Front. Bevan and the London Controlling Section were tasked with inventing an {{elaborate}} masquerade to cover <b>the</b> <b>Normandy</b> invasion, a vindication {{of the theory}} pioneered by Clarke and Wavell: that every real operation should have a complementary deception.|$|E

Two members of No.410 Squadron, Flight Lieutenant (F/L) Currie and Flying Officer (F/O) Rose, were the first members of the RCAF to see the German V-2 rocket in flight.|$|E
5|$|Operation Royal Flush formed part of Operation Bodyguard, a broad {{strategic}} military deception {{intended to}} confuse the Axis high command as to Allied intentions during the lead-up to <b>the</b> <b>Normandy</b> landings. Royal Flush developed a series of political misdirections in mid-1944 to support other deceptions between June and July. It evolved from Operation Graffham, a political deception aimed at Sweden between February and March 1944.|$|E
5|$|Shortly before World War II, Kentuckian was requisitioned by the War Shipping Administration {{and sailed}} between Trinidad and African ports, between New York and Caribbean ports, and in transatlantic convoys through mid 1944.

5|$|The Allied {{invasion}} of Southern France during the Second World War {{was given the}} code name Operation Dragoon. It would {{take place in the}} South of France, between Cannes and Toulon in August 1944. The landings would be undertaken by the U.S. Seventh Army, with the French First Army landing after the beachhead was secure. Following the success of <b>the</b> <b>Normandy</b> airborne landings, Allied planners wanted to use an airborne force to support the invasion. However the divisions in Europe, the American 82nd and 101st Airborne Division, had participated in <b>the</b> <b>Normandy</b> landings and were refitting for further operations to support the advance in France and the Low Countries. The two British divisions were also unavailable; the 1st Airborne Division was preparing for operations in Northern Europe and the 6th Airborne Division was still fighting in Normandy.|$|E
5|$|The British up-gunned the Sherman {{with their}} highly {{effective}} QF 17 pounder anti-tank gun, {{resulting in the}} Firefly; although {{this was the only}} Allied tank capable of dealing with all current German tanks at normal combat ranges, few (342) were available in time for <b>the</b> <b>Normandy</b> invasion. From D-Day to the end of <b>the</b> <b>Normandy</b> campaign, a further 550 Fireflies were built. A second British tank equipped with the 17pdr gun, the Cruiser Mk VIII Challenger, could not participate in the initial landings having to wait for port facilities to be ready to land. It was not until July 1944 that American Shermans, fitted with the 76-mm (3-inch) M1 tank gun, achieved a parity in firepower with the Panzer IV.|$|E
5|$|The Germans halted {{construction}} work at Mimoyecques as the Allies advanced {{up the coast}} following <b>the</b> <b>Normandy</b> landings. It fell to the Canadian 3rd Infantry Division on 5 September 1944 without resistance, {{a few days after}} the Germans withdrew from the area.|$|E
