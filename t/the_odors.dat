25|$|While infants are {{generally}} attracted to <b>the</b> <b>odors</b> produced by lactating women, infants are particularly responsive to their mother’s unique scent. These olfactory cues {{are used in}} mammals during maternal care for coordination of mother-infant interaction. Familiarization with odors that will be encountered after birth may help the baby adapt to the otherwise unfamiliar environment. Neural structures such as the olfactory bulb undergo extensive changes when exposed to infantile odors; providing {{a starting point for}} individual recognition by the mother. odors from the breasts of lactating women serve as attractants for neonates, regardless of feeding history of the infant. Maternal olfactory learning occurs due to the high state of plasticity and flux within the olfactory system during pregnancy and childbirth.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{measurement}} of <b>odor</b> concentration is <b>the</b> most widespread method to quantify odors. It is standardized in CEN EN 13725:2003. The method {{is based on}} dilution of an <b>odor</b> sample to <b>the</b> <b>odor</b> threshold (<b>the</b> point at which <b>the</b> <b>odor</b> is only just detectable to 50% of the test panel). The numerical value of <b>the</b> <b>odor</b> concentration {{is equal to the}} dilution factor that is necessary to reach <b>the</b> <b>odor</b> threshold. Its unit is the European Odour Unit, OUE. Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>odor</b> concentration at <b>the</b> <b>odor</b> threshold is 1 OUE by definition.|$|R

25|$|Although place cells {{primarily}} rely on visuospatial input, {{some studies}} suggest that olfactory input may {{also play a role}} in generating and recalling place fields. Relatively {{little is known about the}} interaction between place cells and non-visual sensory cues, but preliminary studies have shown that non-visual sensory input may have supplementary role in place field formation. A study by Save et al. found that olfactory information can be used to compensate for a loss of visual information. In this study, place fields in subjects exposed to an environment with no light and no olfactory signals were unstable; the position of the place field shifted abruptly and some of the constituent place cells stopped firing entirely. However, place cells in subjects exposed to a dark environment with olfactory signals remained stable despite a lack of visual cues. An additional study by Zhang et al. examined how the hippocampus uses olfactory signals to create and recall place fields. Similar to the Save et al. study, this study exposed subjects to an environment with a series of odors but no visual or auditory information. Place fields remained stable and even adapted to the rotation of the pattern of olfactory signals. Furthermore, the place fields would remap entirely when <b>the</b> <b>odors</b> were moved randomly. This suggests that place cells not only utilize olfactory information to generate place fields, but also use olfactory information to orient place fields during movement.|$|E

2500|$|Odors {{emitted by}} sewage {{treatment}} are typically {{an indication of}} an anaerobic or [...] "septic" [...] condition.

Other methods of odor control exist, including addition of iron salts, hydrogen peroxide, calcium nitrate, etc. to manage hydrogen sulfide levels.|$|E
30|$|Odor {{perception}} in water depends {{not only on}} <b>the</b> concentration of <b>odor</b> substances, but also on <b>the</b> <b>odor</b> threshold concentration (OTC).

While OAV[*]<[*] 1, it means that the concentration of the substance is lower than its OTC, and it contributes less to <b>the</b> <b>odor</b> intensity of water.|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} {{the correlation between}} <b>the</b> <b>odor</b> concentration and <b>the</b> chemical composition of environmental tobacco smoke (ETS). Three types of ETS samples were prepared: secondhand smoke (SHS), thirdhand smoke (THS), and field ETS samples from an outside smoking area. <b>The</b> <b>odor</b> concentrations of <b>the</b> ETS, SHS, and THS samples were determined by the triangle-odor-bag method, and the chemical compositions were determined by proton transfer mass spectrometry. <b>The</b> <b>odor</b> concentration of <b>the</b> SHS samples was three or four orders of magnitude {{higher than that of}} the field ETS samples, and three orders of magnitude higher than that of the THS samples. The concentration ratios of the constituent chemicals in THS to those in SHS were about 10 − 4, corresponding to the ratio of <b>the</b> <b>odor</b> concentration. <b>The</b> concentration ratios of the constituent chemicals in the field ETS samples were much lower than the ratios of <b>the</b> <b>odor</b> concentrations.

25|$|The {{defining}} {{feature of}} ORS is excessive thoughts of having offensive body odor(s) which are detectable to others. The individual may report that <b>the</b> <b>odor</b> comes from: <b>the</b> nose and/or mouth, i.e. halitosis (bad breath), the anus, the genitals, the skin generally, or specifically the groin, armpits or feet. The source(s) of <b>the</b> supposed <b>odor</b> may also change over time. There {{are also some}} who are unsure of the exact origin of <b>the</b> <b>odor.</b> <b>The</b> <b>odor</b> is typically reported to be continuously present. The character of <b>the</b> <b>odor</b> may be reported as similar to bodily substances, e.g. feces, flatus, urine, sweat, vomitus, semen, vaginal secretions; or alternatively {{it may be an}} unnatural, non-human or chemical odor, e.g. ammonia, detergent, rotten onions, burnt rags, candles, garbage, burning fish, medicines, old cheese. Again, the reported character of <b>the</b> <b>odor</b> complaint may change over time.

40|$|Recently, {{there are}} various types of display systems that can present aural, visual and haptic {{information}} related to the user’s position.

In this research, we constructed and evaluated a wearable olfactory display to present <b>the</b> spatiality of <b>odor</b> in an outdoor environment.
