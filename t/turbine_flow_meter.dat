As an important flow meter, turbine meter is widely used in many fields for its high accuracy, good repeatability, small size and light weight. However, with the viscosity of the measurement fluid increasing, the measured variation of the linearity becomes bad, which makes great influence on the meter factor. In this paper, the experiment on the viscosity impact of turbine flowmeter's performance was completed by adjusting {{the temperature of the}} mixture of diesel and lubricants, i. e. changing medium viscosity.

This was achieved through the combination of actual experimentation and numerical modeling of the fluid behavior of both liquid water and liquid methane as it passes through the test article designed, developed, and validated here within this study. The discharge coefficient of the cavitating venturi was determined through weigh flow calibration testing to determine an average mass flow rate. <b>Turbine</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> flow rate readings were used as a point of comparison and the discharge coefficient was computed. The discharge coefficient was then implemented into the Bernoulli Equation along with experimental pressure and temperature data to again calculate mass flow rate through the cavitating venturi. The agreement of the venturi flow rate data to that of the <b>turbine</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> effectively established its applicability as a passive flow control and metering feature. A preliminary CFD cavitation model was developed and validated for cavitating water flow regimes using ANSYS FLUENT. Agreement between mass flow rates obtained from the model to experimental data for cavitating water flow indicates that deviations in results for liquid methane analysis from experimental results could simply be the result of insufficiently defined fluid characteristics in the ANSYS FLUENT materials database.

40|$|In {{nuclear power}} plants and {{accelerator}} driven systems (ADS) for nuclear waste treatment, {{it is important to}} monitor the coolant flow rate in the reactor core and pipe-line. In such a strong irradiation, high pressure, and temperature environment, the existing flow measurement techniques (such as Electromagnetic <b>flow</b> <b>meters,</b> Ultrasonic <b>flow</b> <b>meters,</b> <b>Turbine</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meters,</b> etc.) are not accurate and reliable. The measurement of flow rates (mass flow rates or volume flow rate) plays a notable role in monitoring and controlling the experimental conditions. The bulk flow rates can be obtained through direct methods, which measure the amount of discharged fluids over a period of time. Alternatively, flow rates can also be obtained using indirect methods. For example, they can be derived through the measurement of fluid velocities. So far, the velocities have been found in strong correlation with signals of pressure, temperature, optical wave, ultrasonic wave, etc. based on diverse physical principles. Note that with some exceptions, the flow rate measurement systems require calibration or empirical corrections, especially after long term operation. In the application of liquid metal coolant flow rate measurement, the high temperature, pressure, and corrosion environment limit most <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> devices from being used in long term and maintenance-free operation.

Prior to each test session, a two-point gas calibration for oxygen and carbon dioxide (O 2 16.10 and 20.93  %; CO 2 0.00 and 5.20  %, respectively) and a <b>turbine</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> calibration (3 -L syringe) were performed according to the manufacturers’ recommendation. Fluctuations of breath-by-breath data were minimized using a six-breath smoothing and consequent 30 -s averaging.

VO 2 max was determined using the following criteria: a respiratory quotient (RQ) ≥ 1.15 or a plateau of VO 2 {{in spite of a}} load increase [15]. The GXT protocol used consisted of three stages: rest, exercise, and recovery. The resting stage of 2  min standing was performed to obtain baseline values.

40|$|Wet gas {{metering}} {{is becoming an}} increasingly important problem to {{the oil and gas}} industry. Much research has been done to measure the water and gas flow rates of two-phase flows using a Venturi meter. The Venturi meter is a favoured device for metering of unprocessed wet natural gas production flows. In this thesis, various combinations of techniques have been employed in annular gas-liquid two phase flows to measure the flow parameters (e. g. liquid film thickness, gas volume fraction and gas and water flow rates). One of the most useful techniques which was used and which has proven attractive for many previous multiphase flow applications is the electrical conductance technique used in conjunction with the Venturi. In this thesis, research has been done on designing a novel wet gas flow metering technique, which combines a Venturi with conductance sensors at the inlet and throat to measure the gas and the water flow rates and gas mass flow rate in vertical annular (wet gas) flows. Two ring conductance sensors at the inlet of the Venturi were used to measure the film velocity by cross correlation, one of the inlet ring conductance sensors was used to measure the film thickness and the inlet gas volume fraction. A ring conductance sensor at the throat was used to measure the gas volume fraction at the Venturi throat. A digital level sensor was also used to measure the film thickness (and the gas volume fraction) at the inlet of the Venturi. The reason for measuring the film thickness, the film velocity, the gas volume fraction at the inlet and the throat of the Venturi was to determine the gas and water flow rate and the gas mass flow rate in annular wet gas two phase flow using a variety of mathematical models of Venturis. This work included both static ‘bench’ and flow loop experiments. In the flow loop experiments, which were limited to air-water two-phase flow, the test section included a Venturi meter with a 50 mm inlet diameter with conductance sensors at inlet and the throat. Reference measurements of the water and air were made with a <b>turbine</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> and a variable area flow meter respectively. A Honeywell DP cell sensor was used to measure the differential pressure between the inlet and the throat of the Venturi. A NI USB 6009 data acquisition device was used to integrate the system measurements and to control the operation of the overall Venturi system. A program was created using Labview software to read the input signals from the throat conductance ring sensor; the inlet conductance ring sensors; the digital level sensor; the DP cell sensor; the variable area flow meter and the turbine meter. From these measurements the gas volume fraction at the Venturi inlet and the throat, the differential pressure between the inlet and the throat of the Venturi, the film thickness and the film velocity at the Venturi inlet were calculated and were used with appropriate mathematical models to calculate the gas volumetric rate; gas mass flow rate; and the water mass and volumetric flow rates. Reference values of the gas a water flow rates were also calculated from the turbine meter and variable area flow meter outputs...|$|E
40|$|In the {{international}} {{oil and gas}} industry multiphase annular flow in pipelines and wells is extremely important, but not well understood. This thesis reports the development of an efficient and cheap method for measuring the phase flow rates in two phase annular and annular mist flow, in which the liquid phase is electrically conducting, using ultrasonic and conductance techniques. The method measures changes in the conductance of the liquid film formed during annular flow and uses these to calculate the volumetric and mass flow rates of the liquid film. The gas velocity in the core of the annular flow is measured using an ultrasonic technique. Combined with an entrainment model and the liquid film measurements described above, the ultrasonic technique enables the volumetric flow rate of the gas in the core and the volumetric and mass flow rates of entrained liquid droplets to be measured. This study was based on experimental work and the use of modelling techniques. The practical investigation comprised a series of experiments conducted on a purpose built flow loop in which the test section was a Perspex pipe of 50 mm ID. The experimental work was limited to two-phase air-water flow. The flow loop was specifically designed to accommodate the different instruments and subsystems designed in this investigation including bespoke flow meters and a film extraction system. Most flow loop controls were automated using a MATLAB program. Reference measurement of the total water flow rate was made using a calibrated <b>turbine</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> and of the air flow rate using a calibrated rotameter. For the combined ultrasonic/conductance method investigated in this thesis, the velocity of the gas in the core was found using a novel Ultrasonic Flow Meter (USFM). The positioning and arrangement of the transducers have never been used previously. The flow velocity of the liquid film and the thickness of the film were measured using a novel Conductance Flow Meter (CFM). The CFM measured the liquid film thickness using novel wall conductance probes. By cross correlating the signals from a pair of such probes the film velocity was obtained. Good agreement of the experimental results obtained from the CFM and USFM with results published in the literature was found. Although not investigated experimentally in the work described in this thesis, annular flows encountered in the oil industry may contain a liquid phase comprising a mixture of oil and water. For such flows, the volume fractions of the oil and water can be measured using an automated bypass system developed during this project. The bypass system periodically extracts part of the liquid film, measures its density and then releases the sample back into the pipeline. The liquid phase volume fractions are determined from this density measurement which can be performed more than once per minute. An entrainment model was developed, which is required by the ultrasonic/conductance flow metering technique described in this thesis, in which the mass fraction of the liquid flowing as entrained droplets in the core can be determined from the liquid film thickness and velocity measurements. A mathematical model was also developed to describe the properties of the liquid film, such as liquid velocity profile within the film, and the model’s results were found to agree with the experimental results obtained during the project and also with previous work cited in the literature. The complexity of this latter model was reduced by making a number of simplifying assumptions, which are presented and discussed in the thesis, including the assumption that in annular flow there is a dynamic balance liquid entrainment and droplets being deposited back onto the film. The combination of the designed CFM and USFM with the bypass tube and the entrainment model offer the opportunity for a ‘wet gas’ flow meter to be developed to measure two and three phase annular flows at relatively low cost and with enhanced accuracy. Such a device would have the advantage that it would by substantially smaller than systems using separators and it could even be retrofitted onto off-shore platforms. The integration of the subsystems developed in this project into a single system capable of giving on-line measurements of annular flow would be a major benefit to the author’s sponsor, Petroleum Development of Oman.

40|$|The {{progressing}} {{cavity pump}} {{is a type}} of positive displacement pump that is capable of moving nearly any fluid. This type of pump transports fluids in a series of discrete cavities formed by the helical geometries of its rigid rotor and elastomeric stator. With appropriate materials for the rotor and stator, this pump can move combinations of liquids, suspended solids, and gasses equally well. Because of its versatility, the progressing cavity pump is widely used in the oil industry to transport mixtures of oil, water, and sediment; this investigation was prompted by a desire to extend the use of progressing cavity pumps to wet gas pumping applications. One of the progressing cavity pump's limitations is that the friction between the rotor and stator can generate enough heat to damage the rotor if the pump is not lubricated and cooled by the process fluid. Conventional wisdom dictates that this type of pump will overheat if it pumps only gas, with no liquid in the process fluid. If a progressing cavity pump is used to boost the output from a wet gas well, it could potentially be damaged if the well's output is too dry {{for an extended period of}} time. This project seeks to determine how a progressing cavity pump behaves when operating at gas volume fractions between 0. 90 and 0. 98. A progressing cavity pump manufactured by seepex, model no. BN 130 - 12, is tested at half and full speed using air-water mixtures with gas volume fractions of 0. 90, 0. 92, 0. 94, 0. 96, and 0. 98. The pump's inlet and outlet conditions are controlled to produce suction pressures of 15, 30, and 45 psi and outlet pressures 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 psi higher than the inlet pressure. A series of thermocouples, pressure transducers, and <b>turbine</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> measures the pump's inlet and outlet conditions, the flow rates of water and air entering the pump, and pressures and temperatures at four positions within the pump's stator. Over all test conditions, the maximum recorded temperature of the pump stator did not exceed the maximum safe rubber temperature specified by the manufacturer. The pump?s flow rate is independent of both the fluid's gas volume fraction and the pressure difference across the pump, but it increases slightly with the pump's suction pressure. The pump's mechanical load, however, is dependent only on the pressure difference across the pump and increases linearly with that parameter. Pressure measurements within the stator demonstrated that the leakage between the pump's cavities increases with the fluids gas volume fraction, indicating that liquid inside the pump improves its sealing capability. However, those same measurements failed to detect any appreciable leakage between the two pressure taps nearest the pump's inlet. This last observation suggests that the pump could be shortened by as much as 25 percent without losing any performance in the range of tested conditions; shortening the pump should increase its efficiency by decreasing its frictional mechanical load...|$|R
40|$|The U. S. Navy Public Works Center San Diego (PWCSD) was {{concerned}} about the accuracy of various <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> on steam and compressed air lines serving Naval facilities in San Diego, California. The <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> had experienced various inconsistencies that had not been resolved prior to July 1993. Pacific Northwest Laboratory, Richland, Washington, evaluated the operation of 10 out of 79 steam and compressed air <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> at PWCSD. The evaluation was limited to analysis of historical information and review of existing operating procedures. On-site investigation of the <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> was limited to external observations of the flow-sensing equipment and a check of the flow computer program. PNL did not remove installed sensing equipment (i. e., <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> or temperature or pressure sensors) to evaluate existing condition or check calibration. Although many of the <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> errors can be traced to improperly normalized readings and to meters improperly compensated for temperature and pressure, lack of regular maintenance, including proper calibration, was evidenced throughout this study. A strict calibration schedule should be established for all steam and air <b>flow</b> <b>meters,</b> including calibration of the temperature sensor, pressure sensor, and <b>flow</b> <b>turbine.</b> It is recommended that the most crucial <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> (such as the 10 evaluated in this study) be calibrated yearly. The remaining 69 <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> could be placed on a staggered, biyearly calibration schedule. Calibration should be done by qualified personnel only. Improper calibration is often worse than no calibration at all. An outside firm is recommended to be contracted with to perform all maintenance and calibration on <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> at the Naval facilities. Use of an outside firm would better facilitate regular, reliable calibration while removing liability for damaged parts...|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} {{different}} types of ultrasonic <b>flow</b> <b>meters.</b> Transmission (or contrapropagating transit-time) <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> can be distinguished into in-line (intrusive, wetted) and clamp-on (non-intrusive) varieties. Ultrasonic <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> that use the Doppler shift are called Reflection or Doppler <b>flow</b> <b>meters.</b> The third type is the Open-Channel <b>flow</b> <b>meter.</b>|$|R
50|$|Many {{types of}} flow instrumentation, such as <b>flow</b> <b>meters,</b> require a fully {{developed}} flow to function properly. Common <b>flow</b> <b>meters,</b> including vortex <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> and differential-pressure <b>flow</b> <b>meters,</b> require hydrodynamically fully developed flow. Hydraulically fully developed flow is commonly achieved by having long, straight sections of pipe before the <b>flow</b> <b>meter.</b> Alternatively, <b>flow</b> conditioners and straightening devices {{may be used}} to produce the desired flow.|$|R
