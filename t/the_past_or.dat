5|$|Planescape: Torment is {{primarily}} story-driven and combat is not prominently featured. The protagonist, known as The Nameless One, is an immortal {{who has lived}} many lives but has forgotten all about them, even forgetting his own name. The game focuses on his journey through the city of Sigil and other planes to reclaim his memories of these previous lives. Several characters in the game may join The Nameless One on his journey, {{and most of these}} characters have encountered him in <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>or</b> have been influenced by his actions in some way.|$|E
5|$|Human {{language}} is also unique {{in being able}} to refer to abstract concepts and to imagined or hypothetical events as well as events that took place in <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>or</b> may happen in the future. This ability to refer to events that are not at the same time or place as the speech event is called displacement, and while some animal communication systems can use displacement (such as the communication of bees that can communicate the location of sources of nectar that are out of sight), the degree to which it is used in human {{language is}} also considered unique.|$|E

5|$|The {{period of}} time between an injury and {{development}} of epilepsy varies, {{and it is not}} uncommon for an injury to be followed by a latent period with no recurrent seizures. The longer a person goes without developing seizures, the lower the chances are that epilepsy will develop. At least 80–90% of people with PTE have their first seizure within two years of the TBI. People with no seizures within three years of the injury have only a 5% chance of developing epilepsy. However, one study found that head trauma survivors are at an increased risk for PTE as many as 10years after moderate TBI and over 20years after severe TBI. Since head trauma is fairly common and epilepsy can occur late after the injury, it can be difficult to determine whether a case of epilepsy resulted from head trauma in <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>or</b> whether the trauma was incidental.|$|E
5|$|The {{producers}} {{were determined}} that the show be respectful of audience expectations for the Horrible Histories brand, maintaining its familiar visual style and content as far as possible. Early concepts for bringing it to the screen involved framing or interpretive devices, including a ghostly train carrying children into <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> <b>or</b> a wizard storyteller to act as their guide. Eventually Bradley with producer/director Dominic Brigstocke concluded that the material {{was strong enough to}} stand on its own, so they developed, in consultation with CBBC executives, a live-action sketch-comedy showcase. Once the writing was underway, the producers further discovered that sticking as closely as possible to the historical truth made it easier for them to find the humour within it. They then introduced a comedy style relying on parodies of familiar modern media conventions as a means of making these historical details more immediately accessible.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> {{definite}} <b>past</b> <b>or</b> di-past is used {{to assert}} that something did happen in <b>the</b> past.The inferential <b>past</b> <b>or</b> miş-past {{can be understood as}} asserting that a past participle is applicable now; hence it is used when the fact of a past event, as such, is not important; in particular, <b>the</b> inferential <b>past</b> is used when one did not actually witness <b>the</b> <b>past</b> event.|$|R

Likewise, screen right indicated progress or moving past their problems.|$|E
25|$|Descriptive verbs are {{a special}} class {{that can be}} used as either verbs or adjectives. One of these verbs {{followed}} by a pronoun is all that is needed to form a complete sentence in Mixtec. Descriptives are not conjugated: they always appear in the present tense. To give the same idea in <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>or</b> future tenses, a copulative verb must be used.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{difficulties}} in authenticating the longest human life span ever by modern verification standards, owing to inaccurate or incomplete birth statistics.

25|$|Archaeological {{features}} often leave earthworks - {{signs of}} {{some type of}} modification to the natural environment that often appear as cropmarks, soil marks, or even as plough marks in fields that, if historical, can indicate cultivation methods of <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> <b>or,</b> particularly if more recent, can lift archaeological material to the surface and, therefore, ruin the stratigraphic layering of materials from youngest to oldest). Features can be discovered by archaeologists both through excavation and through field survey.|$|E
25|$|In his speech, Alcibiades {{goes on to}} {{describe}} Socrates' virtues, his incomparable valor in battle, his immunity to cold or fear. On one occasion he even saved Alcibiades' life and then refused to accept honors for it (219e-221c). Socrates, he concludes, is unique in his ideas and accomplishments, unrivaled by any man from <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>or</b> present (221c).

25|$|Although {{stars in}} constellations appear near {{each other in}} the sky, they usually lie at a variety of {{distances}} away from the observer. Since stars also travel along their own orbits through the Milky Way, the constellation outlines change slowly over time. After tens to hundreds of thousands of years, their familiar outlines gradually become unrecognisable. Astronomers can predict <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>or</b> future constellation outlines by measuring their individual stars common proper motions or cpm by accurate astrometry and their radial velocities by astronomical spectroscopy.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, Ellington embraced {{recording}} with artists {{who had been}} friendly rivals in <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> <b>or</b> were younger musicians who focused on later styles. The Ellington and Count Basie orchestras recorded together. During a period when he was between recording contracts, he made records with Louis Armstrong (Roulette), Coleman Hawkins, John Coltrane (both for Impulse) and participated in a session with Charles Mingus and Max Roach which produced the Money Jungle (United Artists) album. He signed to Frank Sinatra's new Reprise label, but the association with the label was short-lived.|$|E
25|$|These novels often blend {{elements}} of other subgenres—including suspense, mystery, or chick lit—with their fantastic themes. A few paranormals are set solely {{in the past}} and are structured much like any historical romance novel. Others are set in the future, sometimes on different worlds. Still others have a time-travel element with either the hero or the heroine traveling into <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>or</b> the future. Between 2002 and 2004, the number of paranormal romances published in the United States doubled to 170 per year. A popular title in the genre can sell over 500,000 copies.|$|E
