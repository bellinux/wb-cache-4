40|$|Parallel {{execution}} of a program R (intuitively regarded as a partial order) is usually modeled by sequentially executing one of the total orders (interleavings) into which it can be embedded. Our work deviates from this serialization principle by using true concurrency [21] to model parallel execution. True concurrency is represented via completions of R to semi total orders, called <b>time</b> <b>diagrams.</b> These orders are characterized via a set of conditions (denoted by Ct), yielding orders or <b>time</b> <b>diagrams</b> which preserve some degree of the intended parallelism in R. Another way to express semi total orders is to use re-writing or derivation rules (denoted by Cx) which for any program R generates a set of semi-total orders. This paper includes a classification of parallel execution into three classes according to three different types of Ct conditions. For each class a suitable Cx is found and a proof of equivalence between the set of all <b>time</b> <b>diagrams</b> satisfying Ct and the set of all termina [...] ...|$|R
40|$|In {{previous}} work {{we have shown}} how modular code can be automatically generated from a synchronous block diagram notation where all blocks fire at all times. Here, we extend this work to triggered and <b>timed</b> <b>diagrams,</b> where some blocks fire only when their trigger is true, or at statically specified times. We show that, although triggers can be eliminated, this is not desirable since it destroys modularity and may also result in rejecting some diagrams that could be accepted. To avoid this we propose a modular code generation method that directly accounts for triggers. We also propose methods specialized to <b>timed</b> <b>diagrams.</b> Although <b>timed</b> <b>diagrams</b> are special cases of triggered diagrams, treating them directly allows us to obtain efficient code. We achieve this by enriching the interface of a macro block with firing time information and using this information to avoid firing the block unnecessarily. Existing firing time representations are generally conservative, {{in the sense that}} they cannot represent the exact set of firing times of a macro block, but a super-set. To remedy this, we devise a novel and accurate (exact) representation. This representation uses finite automata and is amenable to algebraic manipulation and generation of efficient code. ...|$|R
5000|$|Through the {{analysis}} of isotopic compositions of neodymium, DePaolo and Wasserburg [...] discovered that terrestrial igneous rocks closely followed the Chondritic Uniform Reservoir (CHUR) line. Chondritic meteorites are thought to represent the earliest (unsorted) material that formed {{in the solar system}} before planets formed. They have relatively homogeneous trace element signatures and therefore their isotopic evolution can model the evolution of the whole solar system and of the ‘Bulk Earth’. After plotting the ages and initial 143Nd/144Nd ratios of terrestrial igneous rocks on a Nd evolution vs. <b>time</b> <b>diagram,</b> DePaolo and Wasserburg determined that Archean rocks had initial Nd isotope ratios very similar to that defined by the CHUR evolution line.|$|E
5000|$|The Tipler {{cylinder}} {{was discovered}} {{as a solution}} to the equations of general relativity by Willem Jacob van Stockum in 1936 and Kornel Lanczos in 1924, but not recognized as allowing closed timelike curves until an analysis by Frank Tipler in 1974. Tipler showed in his 1974 paper, [...] "Rotating Cylinders and the Possibility of Global Causality Violation" [...] that in a spacetime containing a massive, infinitely long cylinder which was spinning along its longitudinal axis, the cylinder should create a frame-dragging effect. This frame-dragging effect warps spacetime {{in such a way that}} the light cones of objects in the cylinder's proximity become tilted, so that part of the light cone then points backwards along the time axis on a space <b>time</b> <b>diagram.</b> Therefore, a spacecraft accelerating sufficiently in the appropriate direction can travel backwards through time along a closed timelike curve or CTC.|$|E
5000|$|Despite {{the good}} fit of Archean plutons to the CHUR Nd isotope {{evolution}} line, DePaolo & Wasserburg (1976) {{observed that the}} majority of young oceanic volcanics (Mid Ocean Ridge basalts and Island Arc basalts) lay +7 to +12 ɛ units above the CHUR line (see figure). This led to the realization that Archaen continental igneous rocks that plotted within the error of the CHUR line could instead lie on a depleted mantle evolution line characterized by increasing Sm/Nd and 143Nd/144Nd ratios over time. To further analyze this gap between the Archean CHUR data and the young volcanic samples, a study was conducted on the Proterozoic metamorphic basement of the Colorado Front Ranges (the Idaho Springs Formation). [...] The initial 143Nd/144Nd ratios of the samples analyzed are plotted on a ɛNd versus <b>time</b> <b>diagram</b> shown in the figure. DePaolo (1981) fitted a quadratic curve to the Idaho Springs and average ɛNd for the modern oceanic island arc data, thus representing the neodymium isotope evolution of a depleted reservoir.

However, most systems do not catch synchronous stepping actions between right foot and left foot. For obtaining a precise gait pattern, a synchronous walking sensing system is developed, in which a pair of acceleration and angular velocity sensors are attached to left and right shoes of a walking person and their data are transmitted to a PC through a wireless channel. Walking data from 19 persons of the age of 14 to 20 are acquired for walking analysis.

The {{first step is}} to visualize variables on health outcomes using the demographic <b>time</b> <b>diagram.</b> The second step is pattern detection. We assess the primary time measures over which health outcomes appear to vary. Under the assumption that these patterns of temporal variation are empirically regular, we describe a method of standardizing health expectancy calculations for morbidity conditions whose prevalence is more closely related to thanatological age. Finally, we reason that period estimates of health expectancies for certain health conditions are biased when mortality has been or will-be changing, and comparisons of HLE between populations with different mortality are also biased. We conclude that comparisons of health expectancies might be biased in ways not previously documented.|$|E
40|$|A {{distributed}} system, where processes communicate via messages with unpredictable transmission times, {{is characterized}} by the fact that no process has an up-to-date and consistent view of the system's global state. Furthermore, the notion of global time does not exist a priori within such a system. However, by de ning time to be a partially ordered set of vectors forming a lattice structure, one gets a notion of logical time which is realizable in such a system and which represents the causality structure of events in an isomorphic way. With this de nition, the relations &quot; and the same time &quot; get a new and generalized but adequate interpretation. Interestingly, it turns out that this notion of time is similar in structure to Minkowski's relativistic space-time model. We motivate the concept of time&quot;, elaborate its properties, and discuss the analogy to relativistic space-time. 1 Distributed Computations and <b>Time</b> <b>Diagram...</b>|$|E
