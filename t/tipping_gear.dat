50|$|A {{gear motor}} (external gear) {{consists}} of two gears, the driven gear (attached to the output shaft {{by way of a}} key, etc.) and the idler gear. High pressure oil is ported into one side of the gears, where it flows around the periphery of the gears, between the <b>gear</b> <b>tips</b> and the wall housings in which it resides, to the outlet port. The gears then mesh, not allowing the oil from the outlet side to flow back to the inlet side. For lubrication, the gear motor uses a small amount of oil from the pressurized side of the gears, bleeds this through the (typically) hydrodynamic bearings, and vents the same oil either to the low pressure side of the gears, or through a dedicated drain port on the motor housing. An especially positive attribute of the gear motor is that catastrophic breakdown is less common than in most other types of hydraulic motors. This is because the gears gradually wear down the housing and/or main bushings, reducing the volumetric efficiency of the motor gradually until it is all but useless. This often happens long before wear causes the unit to seize or break down.|$|R
40|$|Following an {{interesting}} observation {{reported in the}} Wear of Materials 2009 by the present authors [1], the current paper will present an extensive investigation of dissimilar polymer gear contact, friction and wear behaviour. The unique polymer gear test rig employed will be briefly introduced. The most interesting observation from the experimental work is the significantly different wear behaviour when running acetal against nylon gears, especially the low wear rate when the acetal gear is the driver. To understand the interesting behaviour, detailed modelling work {{has been carried out}} to investigate the mechanisms of dissimilar gear engagements as well as which one is the driver. The advanced non-linear finite element method has been employed to simulate the gear tooth contact. It has been found that the gear contact force during the access process is higher than that in the recess process. Further work has been carried out on the high performance PEEK gear contacts, i. e. PEEK against steel, steel against PEEK and PEEK against PEEK. To improve the high friction and wear of the <b>gear</b> <b>tip,</b> a micron geometry modification method, tip relief, has been employed and significant frictional contact force reduction has been achieved...|$|R
40|$|A design {{procedure}} for sizing standard involute spur gearsets is presented. The procedure {{is applied to}} find the optimal design for two examples - an external gear mesh with a ratio of 5 : 1 and an internal gear mesh with a ratio of 5 : 1. In the procedure, the gear mesh is designed to minimize the center distance for a given gear ratio, pressure angle, pinion torque, and allowable tooth strengths. From the methodology presented, a design space may be formulated for either external gear contact or for internal contact. The design space includes kinematics considerations of involute interference, tip fouling, and contact ratio. Also included are design constraints based on bending fatigue in the pinion fillet and Hertzian contact pressure in the full load region and at the <b>gear</b> <b>tip</b> where scoring is possible. This design space is two dimensional, giving the gear mesh center distance {{as a function of}} diametral pitch and the number of pinion teeth.

40|$|The gear meshing is {{very complex}} process as high {{non-linearity}} behaviour is involved during the process. Normally most analysis of gear tooth contact {{is on the}} basis of a hypothesis that the contacted gear teeth are cantilever beams to obtain the approximate results quickly. However, many important factors have been ignored in simulating gear tooth contact using cantilever beam hypothesis, those factors include tooth profile variations, gear rotation speed and input torque, coefficient of friction and geometry distortion. Many of non-linear responses such as noise, vibration, abrasion and so on make the actual contact process much more complicated than those in the cantilever beam hypothesis although it is a reliable reference for integrated gear performance investigation. The main contribution of this thesis is in the investigation of the typical static and dynamic performances of meshing gears by simulating gears rolling-sliding contact processes using non-linear finite element method. A typical spur gear model has been proposed first for performance analysis and the model with integrated parameters could contribute reliable finite element conditions to simulate actual gear meshing. The bending stress and its resultant stress of contacted teeth with static model and dynamic model have been then simulated and the results can be used to provide information on the contacted teeth stresses distribution. The detailed investigation of transmission error in gear meshing has been carried out to understand harmful noise and vibration of gear set and a micro geometry modification of gear tooth profile has been proposed, i. e. <b>tip</b> relief. The <b>gear</b> contact pressure distributions and transmission errors have been then analyzed with micro geometry modification and the analysis is under static and dynamic boundary conditions. Finally, the most significant contribution of the thesis is the investigation of the frictional effect on dynamic performance, including dynamic stress and transmission errors.

40|$|The {{work done}} at SAAB Automobile AB in Trollh√§ttan {{is about to}} study if it is {{possible}} to introduce a new mode with focus on facilitating a more economic way of driving. This mode {{came to be known as}} the ECO mode, where ECO stands for Economy, which is supposed to ease and advise the driver during the driving itself, for example by <b>tipping</b> which <b>gear</b> should be chosen with a manual transmission, which is thought to be presented at the assistance display, or with an automatic transmission to increase the drivers means to drive more fuel-efficient. The driver is able to chose whether to follow those advices or not, which basically means that the ECO mode is not governing in any way. The ECO mode itself was initiated due to that CO 2 credit was promised, in order if car companies could prove positive real life fuel consumption. Practically this would mean, for example, to cut a couple of grams (CO 2 -emission) when certifying the emission values. Therefore, there is a need to study this scope of work. In this analysis, there is an interest in what effects the ECO mode would contribute with in a vehicle with automatic transmission. A possible introduction of the mode would probably bring both positive and negative signs within a couple of areas, where vehicle control and comfort belongs to the negatives, while fuel consumption, and therefore CO 2 emissions, is expected to improve. To answer these questions, data was collected from the standardized driving patterns US, EU and Saabs own defined cycle, the THN-VBG cycle. The tests were performed with two different calibrations, ECO and STD. A summary of the main results follow: EU-cycle Fuel consumption improved by 5 % with ECO mode. Minimal difference regarding the accelerator regulations between ECO & STD. Wider variation in the accelerator positions with ECO mode. Minimal difference in the ability to follow targeted speed between ECO & STD. US-cycle Fuel consumption improved by 5 % with ECO mode. Minimal difference regarding the accelerator regulations between ECO & STD. Wider variation in the accelerator positions with ECO mode. Minimal difference in the ability to follow targeted speed between ECO & STD. THN-VBG cycle Fuel consumption improved by 1, 7 % with the ECO mode. Moderate difference regarding the ability to follow instructions, 7 % more regulation with the STD mode. All cycles including real-life driving show an increased use of higher gears. Accelerations levels ‚Äì The STD calibration reaches a wider interval of acceleration: ranging from 0 m/s 2 ‚Äì 4 m/s 2 whilst the ECO calibrated car rarely passes 2, 8 m/s 2. This would indicate that the ECO calibration promotes a more restrained driving style as data is captured in real-life traffic...|$|R
40|$|The gears in a {{transmission}} are lubricated {{to prevent their}} premature failure {{as a result of}} pitting and wear on the tooth surfaces. Furthermore, the lubricant also limits the rise in surface temperature of the gears, which could otherwise lead to failure as a result of scuffing. The purpose of this thesis was to construct a fairly realistic theoretical lubrication model for spur and helical gears, the primary output parameters of this model being film thickness and flash temperatures, which would help in the identification of areas on the gear tooth surface prone to the aforementioned modes of failure. This thesis was carried out at the Gear Technology group in Scania CV AB in collaboration with the department of machine design at KTH. Gear lubrication is tricky as it entails the determination of parameters such as loads, curvatures, and velocities; which are different along the entire surface of the gear tooth. Primarily the loads are hard to obtain as they are dynamic in nature; the load is shared between different pairs of teeth during motion. The calculation of velocities and curvatures in an area of the gear surface called the tip relief can also not be done in a straightforward manner. These issues were simplified to a large extent with the assistance of a program called Helical 3 D; owing to its powerful contact analysis algorithm, values of the film thickness and flash temperatures could be determined in almost every region where contact occurred between the gear teeth. The results of the lubrication model showed a reduction in film thickness in the tip relief area of the gear tooth surface; which meant that there were higher chances for the incidence of pitting and wear in this region. This was later confirmed when photographs from experimental tests illustrated a pitting line in the tip relief region of the helical gear. It was also inferred from the model that the occurrence of pitting could be greatly reduced if a quadratic tip relief modification were applied when compared to the existing linear modification used at Scania. Another important conclusion drawn was that thermal effects contributed to a significant decrease in the film thickness. Furthermore, the model showed higher flash temperatures close to the <b>tip</b> of the <b>gear</b> tooth surface, and photographs from experiments conducted showed the prescence of scuffing marks there...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{optimize}} the goal, steel gear wheels regarding load-carrying capacity and wear, thin film coatings were tested. Different coating systems were examined numerically with the software ELASTICA¬Æ for their suitability. The characteristics of the coating systems were determined dependent on the material, its surface treatment {{as well as the}} diameters of relevant rolling partners. Differences were made between macroscopic rolling contacts between the teeth profiles and microscopic contacts with surface roughness and abrasion particles. First the four best suitable coating systems were deposited on simplified rollers and examined under different conditions. Two coating systems were determined, which show special suitability for the coating of the gear wheels. The first system is an a:C-H coating with an CrN interlayer. The second system is an a:C-H coating wtih an CrN interlayer on a plasma-nitrided substrat (Duplex-process). In order to protect the coatings on the teeth, their involute profile was provided with a <b>tip</b> relief. As <b>gear</b> wheel materials 16 MnCr 5, 42 CrMo 4 as well as the special steel ETG¬Æ 88 were used. Two kinds of flow fats were used as lubricants and additional the unlubricated operation was examined. The gear wheels were tested at three different speeds on a test machine especially built for it. The testing routine was carried out in so-called power-stages. Each stage means a defined number of contacts and a certain Hertzian stress on the teeth profiles. With each stage the Hertzian stress was increased. The end of operation time is the beginning of cavitation pitting. The test results showed that in particular with the steel 16 MnCr 5 and 42 CrMo 4 the used Duplex-systems leads to considerable increases of the load-carrying capacity of the tooth flanks and the wear resistance. This increase was observed both with fat-lubricated and with unlubricated gear wheels. The results for the special steel ETG¬Æ 88 were less promising. An unlubricated operation could be made possible by the described coatings, which {{would not have been possible}} without the coatings. However the results are not as good as the results of uncoated gear wheels wih use of minimum fat lubrication. The reason could be an insufficient nitriding-depth. For the selected steel the plasma-nitriding parameters were investigated with the goal of optimized nitriding-depth. Unfortunately up to the end of this project the gear wheels could not be treated with the optimized Duplex-Process. At present the attempts with optimally plasma-nitrided gear wheels are carried out. After that it would be possible to give recommendations for the plasma-nitriding process and the necessary coating as well as the selection of the fat...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{automotive}} {{applications such}} as transmission clutch plates, combustion chambers, diesel fuel injector <b>tips,</b> and axle <b>gears</b> and friction plates operate at temperatures that can exceed 250 ¬∞C and pressures of 40, 000 psia. Industrial practice is to add homopolymers and copolymers to base oils to modify bulk fluid viscosity and frictional properties for these demanding applications. However, designing polymeric additives for lubricants and predicting their performance {{is limited by the}} lack of available high-temperature high-pressure (HTHP) viscosity and density data needed to test contemporary lubricity models. Thus, a major objective of this thesis is the design, development, and commissioning of a rolling ball viscometer/densitometer (RBVD) capable of simultaneously determining fluid densities and viscosities at temperatures in excess of 250 ¬∞C and pressures of 40, 000 psia. Resulting data may then be generated to directly address the fundamental need for lubricant property data at these HTHP conditions. The design and development of the RBVD is described in detail to highlight the design iterations and modifications utilized to ensure robust operation at extreme conditions. Three significant and novel features of this RBVD apparatus that distinguish and differentiate it from other apparatus of this type are: (1) specially designed metal-to-metal and sapphire-to-metal seated surfaces capable of eliminating temperature- and chemically-sensitive elastomeric seals; (2) use of a bellows piston to eliminate significant temperature and operational constraints; and (3) incorporation of a linear variable differential transducer (LVDT) to simultaneously permit determination of solution density and viscosity. A detailed analysis of initial accumulated uncertainty for the experimental viscosity and density techniques revealed the need for key RBVD modifications. Final data are presented showing that the RBVD is capable of measuring viscosities with an accuracy of ¬± 2 to 3 percent and densities to ¬± 0. 7 percent, including at the extreme operating conditions targeted. A second objective of this thesis is the measurement of HTHP viscosities of star polymer-solvent mixtures to determine the impact of star polymer architecture on solution viscosity at extreme conditions similar to those that might be experienced in automotive applications. This objective is motivated by current challenges facing industry to identify polymeric additives that can be added to base oils to improve fuel economy and allow for the implementation of novel hardware technology that relies on enhanced lubricant properties. Relative to linear polymers, the unique architecture of star polymers enhances polymer solubility in base oils while having a more favorable impact on viscosity and density properties over a wide range of temperatures and pressures. Data are presented for an industrially-relevant star polymer in octane {{to assess the impact of}} the star configuration on solvent viscosity at extreme conditions. The star polymer used in this instance consists of an ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) core with poly(lauryl methacrylate-co-methyl methacrylate) (LMA-MMA) arms. The star polymer has a total weight averaged molecular weight (Mw) and Mw of each arm of 575, 000, and 45, 000, respectively. The copolymer arms of the star polymer have an LMA-to-MMA mole ratio of 0. 6. The results of further viscosity studies are presented for a model system of well-characterized commercially available narrow polydispersity index (PDI) star polystyrenes (PS) in toluene. Each PS is evaluated at a two percent by weight concentration in toluene to evaluate the effect of arm molecular weigh on viscosity. Each three-arm star polymer has arm and total molecular weights ([arm Mw] total star Mw) of ([15, 400] 41, 200), ([36, 000] 97, 600), and ([108, 000] 305, 000). In this instance, the viscosity of toluene increased by more than a factor of three for the star with the highest Mw arms...|$|R
