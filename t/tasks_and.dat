40|$|We {{consider}} {{the generation of}} mixed <b>task</b> <b>and</b> data parallel programs and discuss how a clear separation into a <b>task</b> <b>and</b> data parallel level can support the development of efficient programs.

40|$|In today’s {{competitive}} landscape, employees increasingly negotiate idiosyncratic deals (i-deals), {{referring to}} personalized work arrangements that address recipients’ unique work needs and preferences (Rousseau et al., 2006). While i-deals unfold in a dyadic context between subordinates and their managers, {{the consequences of}} i-deals concern everyone including co-workers and the organisation. Focusing on <b>task</b> <b>and</b> development i-deals, we propose a trickle-down model to explore whether and how organisations benefit from i-deals. First, we argue that managers’ <b>task</b> <b>and</b> development i-deals cascade down to their subordinates, leading them to have similar i-deals with downstream consequences for co-workers and the organisation. Furthermore, we propose that effective implementation of <b>task</b> <b>and</b> development i-deals are context-specific: we integrate the role of managers’ servant leadership as a boundary condition to explore the association between managers’ <b>and</b> subordinates’ <b>task</b> <b>and</b> development i-deals. We also integrate subordinates’ prosocial motives to explore the association between subordinates’ <b>task</b> <b>and</b> development i-deals and their work outcomes. We draw on work adjustment, social learning (SLT) and social information processing (SIP) theories to study our proposed associations. The results of a matched employee–manager dataset collected in the Philippines support our hypothesized model. This study contributes to i-deals research by: 1) testing whether <b>and</b> how <b>task</b> <b>and</b> development i-deals can be mutually beneficial for all the involved parties; and 2) revealing how the context, at the individual level, explains how <b>and</b> when <b>task</b> <b>and</b> development i-deals can best be implemented in workplaces.

Of the 54 assigned to the manual task, 17 truly performed the <b>task</b> <b>and</b> were truthful when interviewed about their activities; 18 performed the <b>task</b> <b>and,</b> when interviewed denied having performed the task; 19 read the instructions regarding the manual <b>task</b> <b>and</b> when interviewed falsely claimed to have performed the task.

The transcripts of interviews were rated by individuals trained in cognitive interviewing; forensic speech variables (response length, unique word count and type-token ratio (TTR)) were coded from transcripts. Human rater judgments and computer-based speech analysis performed better than chance; computer based judgments were superior to the human judgments (i. e., 80 % vs. 62 %, respectively).
