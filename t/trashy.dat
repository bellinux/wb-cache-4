His most famous novel, The Petty Demon (1902), {{was an attempt to}} create a living portrait of the concept known in Russian as poshlost' (an idea whose meaning lies somewhere between evil, <b>trashy</b> and banality or kitsch). His next large prose work, A Created Legend (a trilogy consisting of Drops of Blood, Queen Ortruda, and Smoke and Ash), contained many of the same characteristics but presented a considerably more positive and hopeful view of the world.|$|E

25|$|The {{aesthetics}} {{of the new}} rave scene {{are similar to those}} of the original rave scene, being mostly centred on psychedelic visual effects. Glowsticks, neon and other lights are common, and followers of the scene often dress in extremely bright and fluorescent colored clothing. New Rave has been defined more by the image and aesthetic of its bands and supporters, than by its music. Trash Fashion lead singer, Jet Storm, and Electro heroine Uffie, have been described as the scene's very own pin ups. Nevertheless, the use of electronic instruments, a musical fusion of rock and dance styles, and a particular anarchic, <b>trashy</b> energy are certainly key elements.|$|E

The song also debuted and peaked in the top ten in three other countries under similar circumstances, only improving upon its peak in Australia. The single was met with mixed reaction from music critics, some praised Kesha's unapologetic lyrics combined with an auto-tuned working hook, while others called it <b>trashy.</b> Although reviews were mainly positive, a common complaint amongst critics was the appearance of 3OH!3.|$|E

A more modern critic said, [...] "Who, except wretched schoolchildren, now reads Longfellow?" [...] A London critic in the London Quarterly Review, however, condemned all American poetry—"with two or three exceptions, there is not a poet of mark in the whole union"—but he singled out Longfellow as one of those exceptions.
