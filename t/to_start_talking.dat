25|$|Ralf is a hot-blooded {{person that}} only cares for action. He is also {{informal}} when talking with his partners or his commander Heidern although he tends <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>talking</b> {{in a more}} formal way. However, he is very determined to accomplish all his missions, normally becoming very sad when he fails, especially when he loses a war. Despite being the counterpart of Clark in many ways, they are always assigned to work together. He is especially protective of any new recruits that come under his command and will try his best to care for them, most notably with Whip.|$|E
25|$|Remi Cadoret {{wrote in}} the American Journal of Psychiatry that the typical age for the {{children}} <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>talking</b> about past-life memories (and often violent deaths) was two to four years, and generally they had stopped talking about them {{by the age of}} eight years. The descriptions would sometimes be accompanied by unusual behavior such as specific fears, and the children might have a birthmark the same shape as wounds on the body of the deceased person whose life was purportedly being recalled. The children claiming to have lived before might exhibit special skills, such as playing an instrument or speaking a language they appeared not to have learned.|$|E
500|$|Death Cab for Cutie {{had been}} {{contacted}} by major labels on-and-off for several years, {{but it was}} only after the proven success of Transatlanticism that they decided <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>talking</b> to labels about a potential deal. The fact that they had already achieved considerable success allowed the band to negotiate with a lot of creative freedom. According to their manager Jordan Kurland, the band had spoken to [...] "pretty much all of them", and then decided they were most satisfied with their offer from Atlantic Records. In November 2004, the band signed a “long-term worldwide deal” with Atlantic, leaving their long-time label Barsuk Records. Gibbard stated on the band's official website that nothing would change, except that [...] "next to the picture of Barsuk holding a 7", there will be the letter [...] "A" [...] on both the spine and back of our upcoming albums." [...] After signing to Atlantic, the band was still nervous about corporate economics, and encouraged fans to download its songs from the Internet.|$|E

2500|$|At this, {{the halfway}} point of the championship, Prost's lead over Senna had {{increased}} to 20 points; Britain was the 4th consecutive race Senna had retired from- and Prost had won 3 of those 4 races. Despite much talk, he downplayed {{the thought of a}} third championship. [...] "I don't want <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>talking</b> about the championship, getting into all that," [...] he said, [...] "but I'm much happier now, yes. Motivated again. I've had no engine problems since Mexico, which is nice, and also I'm pleased to see Ferrari getting more competitive: both Nigel and Gerhard can win races and that can only help me." ...|$|E
2500|$|On September 21, 2006, Pronk {{asked the}} warring parties in Darfur, {{including}} President Omar al-Bashir {{and the seven}} rebel movements, to observe a [...] "month of tranquility" [...] during Ramadan, which would begin September 23, 2006. His implicit call for a ceasefire in the western region of Sudan came after the Khartoum government withdrew its ultimatum for African Union peacekeepers to pull out. Other African states then agreed to extend their mandate {{until the end of}} 2006. By Pronk's request, they would finish the collision course, which would mean no fighting, no bombing, no changes of heart. Such a lull would help [...] "create an atmosphere" [...] for a new round of negotiations. The peace deal was [...] "in a coma": not dead but dying. In addition the rejectionist factions should end the quarrel <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>talking</b> about everything related to the Darfur peace agreement to improve it.|$|E
2500|$|On October 6, 2010, Palin {{spoke with}} reporters and fielded a {{question}} about Social Security. She stated, [...] "e {{are going to have}} to make some tough decisions today. Thomas Paine, one of our Founders, had said, 'If there is to be trouble, let it be in my day, so that my child may have peace.' What he meant way back then was that there should be an expectation that some sacrifices will have to be made, in our generation, so that future generations can have the opportunities that we've had to grow and thrive and prosper, so that our private sector can do what a private sector does best in creating jobs. So, yeah, with some practical things that have to be made, some decisions here, with perhaps changing, in future years, not adversely affecting those who are reliant on retirement benefits today, for instance, Social Security benefits, but changing, perhaps, the eligibility in future years. That has to be something that we're brave enough, courageous enough, <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>talking</b> about." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "The Revealing Science of God" [...] {{is based}} on the shruti class of Hindu scripture which Yogananda {{described}} as scriptures that are [...] "directly heard" [...] or [...] "revealed", in particular the Vedas. Regarding its title, Anderson said: [...] "It's always delicate <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>talking</b> about religious things ... should have just been [...] "The Revealing". But I got sort of hip." [...] According to Howe, the track was originally 28 minutes in length but six minutes were cut due to the time constraints of a vinyl record. His guitar solos on the track, performed on a Gibson ES-175, were influenced by his belief that Frank Zappa performed lengthy solos [...] "because the audience wanted it. I was thinking at one stage, [...] "I'll do that. They'll love it". Anderson was inspired to open the track with voices that gradually build from listening to Gregorian chants. The ongoing Vietnam War at the time provided a source for its lyrics. The [...] "Young Christians see it..." [...] section of the song originated from a take recorded during the Fragile recording sessions that was previously unreleased until the album's 2015 reissue, which contained the track named [...] "All Fighter's Past".|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} to Moral Majority founder Jerry Falwell's {{opposition to the}} nomination of Sandra Day O'Connor to the Supreme Court, of which Falwell had said, [...] "Every good Christian should be concerned", Goldwater retorted: [...] "Every good Christian ought to kick Falwell right in the ass." [...] (According to John Dean, Goldwater actually suggested that good Christians ought to kick Falwell in the [...] "nuts", but the news media [...] "changed the anatomical reference.") Goldwater also had harsh words for his one-time political protegé, President Reagan, particularly after the Iran–Contra Affair became public in 1986. Journalist Robert MacNeil, a friend of Goldwater's from the 1964 Presidential campaign, recalled interviewing him in his office shortly afterward. [...] "He {{was sitting in his}} office with his hands on his cane... and he said to me, 'Well, aren't you going to ask me about the Iran arms sales?' It had just been announced that the Reagan administration had sold arms to Iran. And I said, 'Well, if I asked you, what would you say?' He said, 'I'd say it's the god-damned stupidest foreign policy blunder this country's ever made!'", though aside from the Iran–Contra scandal, Goldwater thought nonetheless that Reagan was a good president. In 1988 during that year's [...] presidential campaign, he pointedly told vice-presidential nominee Dan Quayle at a campaign event in Arizona [...] "I want you to go back and tell George Bush <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>talking</b> about the issues." ...|$|E
