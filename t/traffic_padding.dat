First, {{we propose}} Shan-non’s perfect secrecy theory as a {{foundation}} for developing countermea-sures to traffic analysis attacks on information security systems. A system violating the perfect secrecy conditions can leak mission critical informa-tion. Second, we suggest statistical pattern recognition as a fundamental technology to test an information system’s security. This technology can cover a large category of testing approaches because of statistical pattern recognition’s maturity and abundant techniques. Third, researchers have proposed <b>traffic</b> <b>padding</b> as countermeasures to traffic analysis attacks. By applying the proposed information assurance testing framework, we find that constant rate <b>traffic</b> <b>padding</b> does not satisfy Shannon’s perfect secrecy conditions because of its implementation mechanism. We design a variant rate <b>traffic</b> <b>padding</b> strategy as an alternative, which is validated by both theoretical analysis and empirical results. I...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. While web-based {{applications}} {{are becoming increasingly}} ubiquitous, they also present new security and privacy challenges. In particular, recent research revealed that many high profile Web applications might cause private user information to leak from encrypted traffic due to side-channel attacks exploiting packet sizes and timing. Moreover, existing solutions, such as random padding and packet-size rounding, are shown to incur prohibitive cost while still not ensuring sufficient privacy protection. In this paper, we propose a novel k-indistinguishable <b>traffic</b> <b>padding</b> technique to achieve the optimal tradeoff between privacy protection and communication and computational cost. Specifically, we first present a formal model of the privacy-preserving <b>traffic</b> <b>padding</b> (PPTP). We then formulate PPTP problems under different application scenarios, analyze their complexity, and design efficient heuristic algorithms. Finally, we confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithms by comparing them to existing solutions through experiments using real-world Web applications. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} how to prevent traffic {{analysis}} for mission-critical QoS guaranteed networks in a dynamic environments. In an IP-based network, the headers of packets, including source and destination host addresses and type-of-service field, are readable by an observer (i. e., a potential enemy). Since significant information about operation modes and intentions of an opponent can be inferred by appropriately monitoring the pattern of traffic exchanged between its various communication nodes, {{it is important to}} develop means to render traffic analysis ineffective. We achieve prevention of traffic analysis by camouflaging the trac streams under a time invariant traffic pattern via host-based rerouting and appropriate <b>traffic</b> <b>padding.</b> Particular attention is given to carefully planning the <b>traffic</b> <b>padding,</b> so as to not violate real-time deadline requirements. When traffic streams enter and leave the system dynamically, appropriate admission control mechanisms must ensure that this can be done without a [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Suburban {{and rural}} horse farms can suffer from {{problems}} created by mud {{in areas of}} concentrated horse traffic. Because of the frequent trampling of wet ground, mud usually occurs at key locations on the farm—gates, loafing and feeding areas, and watering areas. Once mud appears, {{it is difficult to}} remediate, and the problem recurs with each rain. Depending on the enterprise, cost-share programs may be available that can offset the expense of installing high <b>traffic</b> <b>pads.</b> Excessively muddy conditions impact the health and well being of horses by creating a soft surface that makes walking and standing difficult. Extremely muddy areas may increase shoe loss for shod horses. Mud can harbor pests such as flies and mosquitoes as well as pathogens that may cause infection. Muddy areas can be dangerous and expensive for the horse owner as well. Such areas can become slippery and increase chances of falls and injuries. When the mud dries, the soil becomes compacted, prohibiting vegetation growth and creating an area with reduced infiltration and increased surface water runoff. Air spaces in the soil are removed, which reduces the insulation value of the soil and can cause water lines near livestock waterers to freeze. Exposed soil has a negative effect on water quality. The lack of vegetation allows nutrients, sediment, and possibly pathogens to be carried in runoff and discharged to surfac...|$|R
40|$|This paper studies {{countermeasures}} {{to traffic}} analysis attacks. A common strategy for such countermeasures is link padding. We consider systems where payload <b>traffic</b> is <b>padded</b> so that packets have either constant inter-arrival times or variable inter-arrival times. The adversary applies statistical recognition techniques {{to detect the}} payload traffic rates by using statistical measures like sample mean, sample variance, or sample entropy. We evaluate quantitatively {{the ability of the}} adversary to make a correct detection and derive closed-form formulas for the detection rate based on analytical models. Extensive experiments were carried out to validate the system performance predicted by the analytical method. Based on the systematic evaluations, we develop design guidelines for the proper configuration of a system in order to minimize the detection rate. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an IP-layer anonymizing infrastructure, called ANON, which allows server addresses to be hidden from clients and vice versa. In providing address anonymity, ANON uses a network resident set of IP-layer anonymizing forwarders that can forward IP packets with nested encryption and decryption applied to their source and destination addresses. To prevent adversaries from compromising the anonymity by learning the forwarding path, ANON incorporates {{a suite of}} countermeasures, including non-malleable, semantically secure link encryption and link padding. To lower the bandwidth cost of <b>padding</b> <b>traffic,</b> two novel algorithms are suggested: ondemand link padding and probabilistic link padding. To prevent inband denial of service (DoS) attacks through the anonymizing infrastructure itself, ANON uses rate limiting. Finally, ANON makes use of fault-tolerant transport networks to enhance its resilience against failures and outband attacks. 1...|$|R
40|$|The privacy {{preserving}} {{issues have}} received significant attentions in various domains. Various models and techniques {{have been proposed}} to achieve optimal privacy with minimal costs. However, side-channel leakages (such as, publicly-known algorithms of data publishing, observable traffic information in web application, fine-grained readings in smart metering) further complicate the process of privacy preservation. In this thesis, we make the first effort on investigating a general framework to model side-channel attacks across different domains and applying the framework to various categories of applications. In privacy-preserving data publishing with publicly-known algorithms, we first theoretically study a generic strategy independent of data utility measures and syntactic privacy properties. We then propose an efficient approach to preserving diversity. In privacy-preserving <b>traffic</b> <b>padding</b> in Web applications, we first propose a formal PPTP model to quantify the privacies and costs based on the key observation about the similarity between data publishing and <b>traffic</b> <b>padding.</b> We then introduce randomness into the previous solutions to provide background knowledge-resistant privacy guarantee. In privacy-preserving smart metering, we propose a light-weight approach to simultaneously preserving privacy on both billing and consumption aggregation based on the key observation about the privacy issue beyond the fine-grained readings...|$|E

Strong encryption and <b>traffic</b> <b>padding</b> are often used to hide message contents as well as traffic patterns. In dynamic environment, when real traffic pattern changes, i. e., the network switches its operation mode, determining an optimal cover mode such that the real traffic service is not degraded and the real traffic patterns are "covered" becomes a challenge. In this paper, we formulate this optimality problem and try to solve it through appropriate routing of end-to-end flows. Heuristic-based routing algorithm is proposed and evaluated...|$|E

30|$|The {{performance}} of NC, especially bit level NC, {{is limited by}} several factors such as packet length mismatch (the short packets are zero <b>padded),</b> <b>traffic</b> rate mismatch (some packets cannot be network-coded {{due to lack of}} pairing packets) and transmit rate mismatch. The last factor is neglected in most previous works. In the two-way relay scenarios, the rate mismatch may be formed due to two factors. One is the relay position (which leads to relatively stable differences in link qualities) and the other is fading. Even though the relay lies exactly in the middle of two nodes, the two relay links may have different instantaneous qualities. Since the network-coded packet is intended to be received by both nodes, the minimal rate is chosen for the NC transmission [3]. In this way, the transmission at a low rate on the link supporting a high rate wastes channel bandwidth.|$|R
40|$|The wide {{adoption}} of Web applications in various sectors of our society, such as government, finance, education, health care, media, etc., has implicitly introduced new security challenges. Among such challenges are side channel attacks that may disclose private user inputs from encrypted raffic. Such attacks {{might have a}} serious impact upon user privacy in such applications. In this thesis, we propose a new concept and algorithms that can preserve user privacy in Web applications. In order to achieve this, we define a new privacy model based on a well known concept, namely, differential privacy. The intent is to make <b>padded</b> <b>traffic</b> differentially private such that adversaries cannot infer private user inputs even when they possess prior knowlege about such inputs. At the same time, we intent to achieve a balance bewteen privacy and the incurred communication overhead.

50|$|One-time pads were {{employed}} by Soviet espionage agencies for covert communications with agents and agent controllers. Analysis {{has shown that}} these pads were generated by typists using actual typewriters. This method is of course not truly random, as it makes certain convenient key sequences more likely than others, yet {{it proved to be}} generally effective because while a person will not produce truly random sequences they equally do not follow the same kind of structured mathematical rules that a machine would either, and each person generates ciphers in a different way making attacking any message challenging. Without copies of the key material used, only some defect in the generation method or reuse of keys offered much hope of cryptanalysis. Beginning in the late 1940s, US and UK intelligence agencies were able to break some of the Soviet one-time <b>pad</b> <b>traffic</b> to Moscow during WWII as a result of errors made in generating and distributing the key material. One suggestion is that Moscow Centre personnel were somewhat rushed by the presence of German troops just outside Moscow in late 1941 and early 1942, and they produced more than one copy of the same key material during that period. This decades-long effort was finally codenamed VENONA (BRIDE had been an earlier name); it produced a considerable amount of information, including more than a little about some of the Soviet atom spies. Even so, {{only a small percentage of}} the intercepted messages were either fully or partially decrypted (a few thousand out of several hundred thousand).|$|R

40|$|The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) {{has been}} {{designed}} for reliable data transport over the Internet. The performance of TCP is strongly influenced by its congestion control algorithms that {{limit the amount of}} traffic a sender can transmit based on end-to-end available capacity estimations. These algorithms proved successful in environments where applications rate requirements can be easily anticipated, as is the case for traditional bulk data transfer or interactive applications. However, an important new class of Internet applications has emerged that exhibit significant variations of transmission rate over time. Variable-rate traffic poses a new challenge for congestion control, especially for applications that need to share the limited capacity of a bottleneck over a long delay Internet path (e. g., paths that include satellite links). This thesis first analyses TCP performance of bursty applications that do not send data continuously, but generate data in bursts separated by periods in which little or no data is sent. Simulation analysis shows that standard TCP methods do not provide efficient support for bursty applications that produce variable-rate traffic, especially over long delay paths. Although alternative forms of congestion control like TCP-Friendly Rate Control and the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol have been proposed, they did not achieve widespread deployment. Therefore many current applications that rely upon User Datagram Protocol are not congestion controlled. The use of non-standard or proprietary methods decreases the effectiveness of Internet congestion control and poses a threat to the Internet stability. Solutions are therefore needed to allow bursty applications to use TCP. Chapter three evaluates Congestion Window Validation (CWV), an IETF experimental specification that was proposed to improve support for bursty applications over TCP. It concluded that CWV is too conservative to support many bursty applications and does not provide an incentive to encourage use by application designers. Instead, application designers often avoid generating variable-rate <b>traffic</b> by <b>padding</b> idle periods, which has been shown to waste network resources. CWV is therefore shown to not provide an acceptable solution for variable-rate traffic. In response to this shortfall, a new modification to TCP, TCP-JAGO, is proposed. This allows variable-rate traffic to restart quickly after an inactive (i. e., idle) period and to effectively utilise available network resources while sending at a lower rate than the available rate (i. e., during an application-limited period). The analysis in Chapter five shows that JAGO provides faster convergence to a steady-state rate and improves throughput by more efficiently utilising the network. TCP-JAGO is also shown to provide an appropriate response when congestion is experienced after restart. Variable-rate TCP traffic can also be impacted by the Initial Window algorithm at the start or during the restart of a session. Chapter six considers this problem, where TCP has no prior indication of the network state. A recent proposal for a larger initial window is analysed. Issues and advantages of using a large IW over a range of scenarios are discussed. The thesis concludes by presenting recommendations to improve TCP support for bursty applications. This also provides an incentive for application designers to choose TCP for variable-rate traffic. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|Camouflaging {{is about}} making {{something}} invisible or less visible. Network camouflaging is about hiding certain traffic information (e. g. traffic pattern, traffic flow identity, etc.) from {{internal and external}} eavesdroppers such that important information cannot be deduced from it for malicious use. It {{is one of the}} most challenging security requirements to meet in computer networks. Existing camouflaging techniques such as <b>traffic</b> <b>padding,</b> MIX-net, etc., incur significant performance degradation when protected networks are wireless networks, such as sensor networks and mobile ad hoc networks. The reason is that wireless networks are typically subject to resource constraints (e. g. bandwidth, power supply) and possess some unique characteristics (e. g. broadcast, node mobility) that traditional wired networks do not possess. This necessitates developing new techniques that take account of properties of wireless networks and are able to achieve a good balance between performance and security. In this three-part dissertation we investigate techniques for providing network camouflaging services in wireless networks. In the first part, we address a specific problem in a hierarchical multi-task sensor network, i. e. hiding the links between observable traffic patterns and user interests. To solve the problem, a temporally constant traffic pattern, called cover traffic pattern, is needed. We describe two traf- fic padding schemes that implement the cover traffic pattern and provide algorithms for achieving the optimal energy efficiencies with each scheme. In the second part, we explore the design of a MIX-net based anonymity system in mobile ad hoc networks. The objective is to hide the source-destination relationship with respect to each connection. We survey existing MIX route determination algorithms that do not account for dynamic network topology changes, which may result in high packet loss rate and large packet latency. We then introduce adaptive algorithms to overcome this problem. In the third part, we explore the notion of providing anonymity support at MAC layer in wireless networks, which employs the broadcast property of wireless transmission. We design an IEEE 802. 11 -compliant MAC protocol that provides receiver anonymity for unicast frames and offers better reliability than pure broadcast protocol...|$|E
