50|$|For Long Range weapons, the SWAT team's Remington 700 {{destroyed}} {{the skull of}} its <b>target</b> <b>by</b> shooting it through the left eye.

In addition, the PSG1 was more accurate in hitting its <b>target</b> <b>by</b> {{a fraction of an}} inch, so it earned the advantage in long-ranged weapons.|$|R
