He appeared {{in the title role}} in a 1963 production of Bertolt Brecht's The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui, which did not succeed, but he had a great success in Peter Shaffer's The Royal Hunt of the Sun, playing conquistador Francisco Pizarro to David Carradine's Tony Award-nominated Atahuallpa. (In the 1969 film adaptation, Plummer would take the title role.) From May to June 1973, he appeared on Broadway as the title character in Cyrano, a musical adaptation of Edmond Rostand's 1897 play Cyrano de Bergerac by Anthony Burgess and Michael J. Lewis. For that performance, Plummer won the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical and a Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Performance. Later that year, he played Anton Chekhov in Neil Simon's adaptation of several Chekhov short stories, <b>The</b> <b>Good</b> <b>Doctor.</b>|$|E

[...] He {{was taken to}} Eastbourne Hospital but developed a chest infection and died on 4 July of left ventricular failure. [...] He left an estate of £402,970 and bequeathed £1000 to Percy Hoskins. Hoskins gave the money to charity. [...] Adams had been receiving legacies until the end.

2500|$|The 2017-18 season saw ABC {{acquire a}} {{breakout}} hit with <b>The</b> <b>Good</b> <b>Doctor,</b> {{which lead to}} the series getting an early full-season pickup. Additionally, ABC has revived former FOX series American Idol to premiere during the mid-season. As a result, veteran dramas [...] Once Upon a Time and Marvel Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. were displaced to Friday nights, while Shark Tank was moved to Sunday nights {{in order to accommodate}} a time slot for American Idol. Former ABC sitcom Roseanne, which originally ran from 1988 to 1997, is also scheduled to return for mid-season.|$|E

2500|$|Following {{the release}} of the Kinsey reports, she was once quoted as stating, [...] "I found no surprises in the Kinsey report. <b>The</b> <b>good</b> <b>doctor's</b> {{clinical}} notes were old hat to me... I've had many momentary love affairs. A lot of these impromptu romances have been climaxed in a fashion not generally condoned. I go into them impulsively. I scorn any notion of their permanence. I forget the fever associated with them when a new interest presents itself." ...|$|R

50|$|Following {{the success}} of Prince Achmed, Reiniger {{was able to make}} a second feature. Doktor Dolittle und seine Tiere (Doctor Dolittle and his Animals, 1928) was based on the first of the English children's books by Hugh Lofting. The film tells of <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>Doctor's</b> voyage to Africa to help heal sick animals. It is {{currently}} available only in a television version with new music, voice-over narration and the images playing at too many frames per second. The score of this three-part film was composed by Kurt Weill, Paul Hindemith and Paul Dessau.|$|R
6000|$|... "Happily no prescription, 'neither life, nor death, nor {{any other}} creature,' can cure that complaint," [...] said <b>the</b> <b>good</b> old <b>doctor,</b> [...] "though, alas! it is only too apt to dry up from within." ...|$|R

50|$|In Guilt, {{a series}} of horrifying events occur in quick {{succession}} in the same upscale L.A. neighborhood. A backyard renovation unearths an infant’s body, buried sixty years ago. And soon thereafter in a nearby park, another disturbingly bizarre discovery is made {{not far from the}} body of a young woman shot in the head. Helping LAPD homicide detective Milo Sturgis to link these eerie incidents is brilliant psychologist Alex Delaware. But even <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>doctor’s</b> vast experience with matters both clinical and criminal might not be enough to cut down to the bone of this chilling case—and draw out the disturbing truth.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh yes, sir!" [...] said Rose; {{and with}} {{reliance}} and hope, {{as if she}} had been speaking to a father, she explained their distress and perplexity, then stood in silence while <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>doctor,</b> a slow thinker, considered.|$|E
60|$|All {{that was}} ever known about that journey {{was that these}} {{travellers}} stopped at the hospital in New York, and went on better friends than before after hearing from <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>Doctor</b> all the pathetic story of little Midge.|$|E

60|$|The words escaped {{him before}} he could {{restrain}} himself. He {{looked at her with}} the tender sympathy, so precious to women, which she had not seen in the face of any human creature since the loss of her aunt. Even <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>doctor's</b> efforts to console her had been efforts of professional routine--the inevitable result of his life-long familiarity with sorrow and death. While Alban's eyes rested on her, Emily felt her tears rising. In the fear that he might misinterpret her reception of him, she made an effort to speak with some appearance of composure.|$|R

5000|$|Professor of Physiology {{from the}} Faculty of Nancy {{in charge of}} the {{infirmary}} at Toul, Dr. Lambert, was more enthusiastic about his portrait by Valmier than that of Gleizes, who writes:"The portrait that he Valmier made of the Doctor was excellent, a very good likeness that remained in the classical idiom. But for myself, I wanted to remain faithful to Cubism and not to play games with my own convictions. So the portrait I envisaged Portrait of an Army Doctor was a little surprising for <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>doctor's</b> habits of mind. He did not conceal his way of thinking, but he let me do what I wanted." [...] (Albert Gleizes, Souvenirs, c. 1942) ...|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>good</b> <b>doctor</b> {{was even}} with his word in the matter, and gave out some very sonorous discourses, without in the least {{stopping}} the round of gaieties kept up by these dissipated Katy-dids, which ran on, night after night, till the celebrated Jack Frost epidemic, which occurred somewhere about the first of September.|$|E
60|$|I went to Canterbury first, that I {{might take}} leave of Agnes and Mr. Wickfield (my old room in whose house I {{had not yet}} relinquished), and also of <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>Doctor.</b> Agnes was very glad to see me, {{and told me that}} the house had not been like itself since I had left it.|$|E
60|$|The {{matter was}} explained, and Mr. Wilmot {{was a great}} deal more struck by Dr. May's conduct than <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>doctor</b> thought it deserved. Every one was only too glad that Richard should come as Cocksmoor curate; and, though the stipend was very small--since Mr. Wilmot meant to have other assistance--yet, by living at home, it might be feasible.|$|E
6000|$|The {{history of}} George's life did more; {{he took to}} pitying him, and pity was, indeed, akin to love in <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>doctor's</b> mind. In fact, George {{was a man who}} could be liked, when once {{regarded}} as a belonging--a necessity, not a choice; for it was quite true that there was no harm in him, {{and a great deal of}} good nature. His constant kindness, and evident liking for Margaret, stood him in good stead; he made her a sort of confidante, bestowing on her his immeasurable appreciation of Flora's perfections, and telling her how well he was getting on with [...] "the old gentleman"--a name under which she failed to recognise her father.|$|R
60|$|I shared <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>Doctor's</b> hope, but my {{expectations}} {{of it were}} not increased {{by the appearance of}} my confrère. He was a young, bull-necked fellow about thirty years of age, dark-eyed and black-haired, with an exceedingly vigorous physique. I have never seen a more strongly built man, though he tended to run to fat in a way which showed {{that he was in the}} worst of training. His face was coarse, swollen, and brutal, with a pair of small black eyes deeply sunken in his head. His heavy jowl, his projecting ears, and his thick bandy legs all went to make up a personality which was as formidable as it was repellent.|$|R
60|$|That very year of our travels he {{took his}} degree of the Philosophical Faculty--and only then his true {{vocation}} declared itself. Obedient to the call he entered at once upon the four-year course of the Medical Schools. A day came when, {{on the deck of}} a ship moored in Calcutta, I opened a letter telling me of the end of an enviable existence. He had made for himself a practice in some obscure little town of Austrian Galicia. And the letter went on to tell me how all the bereaved poor of the district, Christians and Jews alike, had mobbed <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>doctor's</b> coffin with sobs and lamentations at the very gate of the cemetery.|$|R
