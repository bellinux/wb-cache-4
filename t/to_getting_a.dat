5|$|The {{first game}} was against Otago University on 10 September, which the home side won easily, 21–0. Jack Verge {{was the only}} one of the team to play well, {{preventing}} the home side scoring through his tackling. For the return match on 15 September, the younger Verge was brought in at five-eighth, which helped strengthen the team. No points were scored in the first half, although the visitors came close <b>to</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> try but were held up on the line. In the second half, Otago scored six points to Sydney's three, and again came away the winners. Verge missed scoring from a penalty kick, which hit the crossbar.|$|E

Jackson, an intensely private entertainer, had not given an interview in 14 years. The event was broadcast live from Jackson's Neverland Ranch and was watched by 90 million people worldwide. Jackson discussed missing out on a normal childhood and his strained relationship with his father, Joe Jackson. During the interview, Jackson attempted to dispel many of the rumors surrounding him and told Winfrey he suffered from the skin-pigment disorder known as vitiligo when asked about the change in the color of his skin. While admitting <b>to</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> nose job, he denied all other plastic surgery rumors.

25|$|From 1991–1993, Borg {{attempted}} a comeback on the men's professional tennis tour, coached by a Welsh karate expert named Ron Thatcher (aka Tai Honsai). Before his 1991 return, Borg grew his hair out {{as it had}} been during his previous professional tennis career and he returned to using a wooden racket; he had kept his hair cut and used modern graphite rackets in exhibitions he played during the late 1980s. Borg, however, failed to win a single match. He faced Jordi Arrese in his first match back, again at Monte Carlo but without practising or playing any exhibition matches, and fell in two sets. In his first nine matches, played in 1991 and 1992, Borg failed to win a single set. He fared slightly better in 1993, taking a set off his opponent {{in each of the three}} matches he played. He came closest <b>to</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> win in what turned out to be his final tour match, falling to Alexander Volkov.|$|E

He threw 113 pitches in the game, in addition <b>to</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> hit and a stolen base in his first postseason start. The Rockies evened the series in the second game, as Cole Hamels left the stadium early to be with his wife, who went into labor with their first child. The Phillies staged comebacks twice to bring them within a run of tying the game, but could not close the door as Huston Street saved the game for Aaron Cook.|$|E

Tucker still angrily insists he did not kill her, and he agrees to submit to a {{polygraph}} test. When Bayliss leaves, Pembleton speaks to Tucker in a soft and comforting tone, trying to get Tucker to trust him. Pembleton suggests Tucker had a drink and blacked out the night he killed Adena, and he seems close <b>to</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> confession before Tucker once again insists he is innocent. With four hours left before the deadline, Bayliss returns and says Tucker failed the polygraph test. Bayliss and Pembleton then aggressively team up on Tucker, talking quickly and intimidating him with repeated questions. They bring up a previously dropped statutory rape charge against Tucker involving a 14-year-old girl, then suggest he attempted {{to have sex with}} Adena and killed her because she resisted. They confront Tucker with gruesome crime scene photos of Adena and ask him if he is sure he didn't kill her, to which a frightened and confused Tucker replies, [...] "Not right now, I'm not." ...|$|E
500|$|His second no-hitter, on September 28, 1951, was an 8–0 {{defeat of}} the Boston Red Sox which allowed the Yankees to clinch at least a tie of the American League pennant. The Yankees {{clinched}} the pennant {{in the second half}} of the September 28 double-header. Reynolds struck out nine hitters. He walked four, but [...] "not one Boston batter seemed close <b>to</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> hit." [...] With two outs in the ninth inning, Ted Williams hit a pop fly to Yankees catcher Yogi Berra. Berra dropped the ball and prolonged the at bat against the dangerous Williams. Reynolds remained calm, telling Berra, [...] "Don't worry Yogi, we'll get him again." [...] Reynolds was correct and Williams once again popped up, but Berra caught this one. In the spring of 1953, Stengel made Reynolds predominantly a reliever, although he notched 15 starts and 5 complete games, because of Reynolds' ability to pitch without much rest and to use his blazing fastball late in the Yankees' afternoon games when the shadows crept over the mound. However, Reynolds injured his back in July when the team bus was on the way to the train station after a game in Philadelphia—robbing Reynolds of his control. During the '53 World Series—his final one—Reynolds started the opener at home and struggled because of his back injury, but recovered to appear in two more as a reliever—winning the sixth and final game of the Series.|$|E
500|$|Realising that an {{academic}} career would {{be barred from}} him by the right wing university authorities, Childe turned <b>to</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> job within the leftist movement. In August 1919, he became private secretary and speech writer to politician John Storey, a prominent member of the centre-left Australian Labor Party then in opposition to New South Wales' Nationalist government. Representing the Sydney suburb of Balmain on the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, Storey became state premier in 1920 when Labor achieved an electoral victory there. Working within the Labor Party allowed Childe to gain an [...] "unrivalled grasp of its structure and history", enabling him {{to write a book}} on the subject, How Labour Governs (1923). The greater his involvement, the more Childe became critical of Labor, believing that they betrayed their socialist ideals once they gained political power and moved to a centrist, pro-capitalist stance. He joined the Industrial Workers of the World, which in Australia served mostly as a centre of radical labourers within existing unions, and at the time was banned by the government as a political threat. In 1921 Childe was sent to London by Storey, {{in order to keep the}} British press updated about developments in New South Wales, but in December Storey died, and a few days later the New South Wales elections restored a Nationalist government under the premiership of George Fuller. Fuller thought Childe's job unnecessary, and in early 1922 terminated his employment.|$|E

500|$|The year 1947 {{became a}} career {{year for the}} now-sober Black. There was {{optimism}} in the Indians clubhouse regarding his talent, with manager Lou Boudreau saying that Black was [...] "a leading candidate for one of our starting jobs." [...] In his first pitching appearance of the season against the Detroit Tigers, a tough 53 victory, someone in the press box said, [...] "I wonder what he’d give for a slug of bourbon", to which he replied, [...] "All I wanted in that situation was a fresh stick of chewing gum. Bourbon doesn’t even tempt me." [...] He followed this with a 10 shutout win against the Chicago White Sox. A game against his former team, the Philadelphia Athletics, became the highlight of his career. On July 10, 1947, Black no-hit the Athletics 3-0 at Cleveland Stadium, allowing six walks and five strikeouts in besting Bill McCahan—himself a no-hit pitcher on September 3 of that 1947 season. Only Eddie Joost came close <b>to</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> hit on Black, hitting a ball {{in the eighth inning}} that just barely went foul. On top of his no-hit performance, Black had two singles and a squeeze bunt that day. He was modest about his performance afterwards, saying [...] "My control was pretty bad. I got behind on a lot of hitters, but they didn't seem to hit me." [...] Black finished the season with ten wins, 12 losses, a 3.92 ERA, eight complete games, and three shutouts. At the end of the season, he was planning to play in the Cuban Winter League along with fellow Indians Bob Feller and Al López, though this did not eventuate. During the off-season, Black returned to his hometown of Salix, where he was given a key to the city and made honorary mayor for a day.|$|E

When I was younger I went out and had a lot of fun, and there were moments when people criticised me for that, and you know what, I'm young, I'm going to do that, and anyone who is going to get on me for that ... I really didn't care." [...] She does not like to go clubbing for two reasons: First, she gets recognised by too many people. [...] Second, everyone wants to comment on her height. In response <b>to</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> hug from Yao Ming at the 2008 Summer Olympics during the closing ceremonies, internet rumours started that Jackson and the married Ming were romantically involved. [...] These rumours were incorrect. [...] Jackson said of them: [...] "When we came across this Yao Ming thing it was like, 'Oh...My...God! When I tell you we were in hysterics...because anybody who knows me knows that would be the last thing on my mind. A 7 foot 8 Chinese man? That's just not my thing. I really respect him as a player. And people who know me know I can be wild and over-the-top. I'm affectionate and that night I guess I was affectionate with the wrong person. I guess the Chinese people don't do that stuff very often, so the cultural [...] was a big thing. But I don't care. You have to laugh about things or you'll be crying, which I would probably have been doing anyway [...] I made the most of my last night at the Olympics and had a great time." [...] She partied a fair amount in her early 20s. By 2010, she was not able to stay out at night clubs until 5:30am any more because she lacked the stamina.|$|E
