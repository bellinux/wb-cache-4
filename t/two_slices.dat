30|$|All these {{functionalities}} {{are assigned}} to links of slices. The slice switch and the slice gateway transport data from a source link to a target link (the relationship is 1 to 1). The slice multiplexer and demultiplexer works on multiple links on one side (the Nto 1 or 1 toN relationship). It is not assumed here that source or target link(s) are from a single slice (the slice chaining concept is allowed described in [72], based on [73]). The slice’s switch can combine <b>two</b> <b>slice’s</b> links from the same layer in the common protocol stack. The slice gateway is slices’ switch that can combine <b>two</b> <b>slice’s</b> links from different layers or of different protocol stacks (or both). The slice multiplexer can merge multiple slices into a single slice, which could be later split up by a slice demultiplexer.|$|R

40|$|A novel {{omnidirectional}} wheeled mechanism, {{named as}} MY wheel, is developed {{based on the}} sliced ball structure in this paper. With mutual passive motion of <b>two</b> <b>sliced</b> balls on the same one active axis, an omnidirectional motion can be achieved. The passive rotational axes of <b>two</b> <b>sliced</b> balls are inclined with 45 degree in two parallel planes, which are perpendicular to the active axis, to realize continuous contact with the ground. This wheeled mechanism also improves the wheel intensity to carry a heavy burden, which is a key problem for omnidirectional mechanism. An omnidirectional mobile platform composed of three MY wheels is developed for validating MY wheel mechanism. Kinematic analyses are presented to verify the omnidirectional movement of this platform. Experimental results show the validity of this platform.

[...] "If health concerns sometimes make you feel guilty about loving bacon ... relax ...yes, it’s high in sodium and fat, but if eaten in moderation or used as a flavoring agent ... it is a guilt free indulgence," [...] writes Villas. Breakfast dishes include French Cheese and Bacon souffle, and Bacon Scrapple. A recipe for BLT sandwich is included in the section on sandwiches, but the majority of Villas's other sandwich recipes are more extreme, and include ingredients such as Jamaican smoked fish. Dishes that contain vegetables include Lima Bean and Bacon Casserole; and Spanish Chicken, Bacon, Meatball and Chickpea Stew.

500|$|The {{video was}} filmed {{in front of}} a live {{audience}} at the United Nations General Assembly in New York on August 10, 2012. SuperUber worked on integration between animations and technology, the structure design and projection mapping that took over the General Assembly Hall after it was invited by Kenzo Digital. 10 20K HLM Barco projectors were placed and mapping was done using Pandora's widget designer and 5 Pandora's Dual Box servers. The final video had an 8856 x 1664 resolution and was split into 10 slices of 1080 x 1664 pixels, since each projector was turned on its side and the images were projected vertically in order to cover the whole structure. <b>Two</b> <b>slices</b> were fed into each system and SuperUber did the warping and edge blending inside Pandora. The screen which was used was over 12,000 square feet; Lucas Werthein, a representative for SuperUber commented that it was the largest indoor temporary screen that was a tilted compound curve adding that from an engineering standpoint, it is [...] "extremely complex". It was custom-designed to mold {{to the inside of the}} General Assembly Hall. It spanned 68m X 15m and surrounded the audience with a 240 degree immersive projection. Ten synchronized and mapped projections covered the screen with 200,000 lumens, creating one continuous giant image. The screen which weighed 1000 pounds was sewn by forty five people. The whole structure, which was hanging off the UN ceiling weighed 6000 pounds. Werthein revealed, [...] "In order to create the proper tension for the screen to hold its shape we had to weld permanent rigging points into the dome of the general assembly." [...] Peter Kirn of Create Digital Motion wrote that the projection mapping was performed onto a fairly simple surface: [...] "What makes the mapping so effective is the way in which it can fill the space, making those pictures immersive on a grand architectural scale. It makes the image a real volume in which the performance can take place." [...] Russ Rive, SuperUber’s director said, [...] "It’s an ambitious project that has completely transformed an iconic location – seen as immutable and unchanging, with its goldplated panel and grand volume. By adding a virtual layer to it, we could digitally rebuild it, playing with the architectural elements, and therefore changing the notion of something static. The technology made the integration between animation and architecture. We used projectors to 'paint with light' the UN General Assembly’s Hall – a unique opportunity to transform such an emblematic place." ...|$|E
