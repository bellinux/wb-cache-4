5|$|Throughout the episode, Jack {{has been}} talking to Rose Nadler (L. Scott Caldwell). Rose's husband, Bernard Nadler (Sam Anderson), was in the <b>tail</b> <b>section</b> of the plane in the bathroom. He, {{along with the rest}} of the tail section's passengers, is {{believed}} by the survivors to be dead, but Rose is convinced that he is alive and that the <b>tail</b> <b>section</b> of the plane thinks that the middle section is dead.|$|E
5|$|In this episode, flashbacks reveal why Hurley is {{hesitant}} {{at his new}} job of distributing food {{found in}} the newly discovered Swan station. Meanwhile, a few castaways become worried that the raft sent by them for rescue may have not {{gone as far as}} they hoped. Jack and Sayid explore the hatch, while Sawyer, Jin, and Michael find out that their captors are from the <b>tail</b> <b>section</b> of the plane..|$|E
5|$|On 13 January 1964, a B-52D {{carrying}} two nuclear bombs suffered a structural failure in flight {{that caused the}} <b>tail</b> <b>section</b> to shear off. Four crewmen ejected successfully before the aircraft crashed near Cumberland, Maryland. Two crewmen subsequently perished on the ground because of hypothermia, while another, who was unable to eject, died in the aircraft; both weapons were recovered. This {{was one of several}} incidents caused by failure of the vertical stabilizer.|$|E
25|$|Trainers {{built from}} 1934 {{up to the}} early 1940s had a color scheme that {{featured}} a bright blue fuselage and yellow wings and <b>tail</b> <b>sections.</b> These wings and <b>tail</b> <b>sections</b> had control surfaces that actually moved {{in response to the}} pilot's movement of the rudder and stick. However, many trainers built during mid to late World War II did not have these wings and <b>tail</b> <b>sections</b> due to material shortages and critical manufacturing times.|$|R

5|$|At {{approximately}} 8:13pm, the aircraft's <b>tail</b> <b>section</b> {{sustained a}} sudden upward movement, significant enough to require trimming {{to bring the}} plane back to level flight. At approximately 10:15pm, Scott and Rataczak landed the 727, with the aft airstair still deployed, at Reno Airport. FBI agents, state troopers, sheriff's deputies, and Reno police surrounded the jet, as it {{had not yet been}} determined with certainty that Cooper was no longer aboard; but an armed search quickly confirmed that he was gone.|$|E
5|$|The {{stricken}} airliner crashed onto Mount Bliss in the San Gabriel Mountains at {{an elevation}} of approximately , where {{the bulk of the}} wreckage landed in a gorge. Fire department officials sent search and rescue helicopters to the crash site, but efforts were hampered by thick fog. Nine bodies were initially found at the crash site, a number of them intact and still strapped into their seats. News reports indicated that these bodies had apparently been thrown clear on impact, and had come to rest alongside the <b>tail</b> <b>section</b> of the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|On August 12, 1985, Japan Airlines Flight 123, a Boeing 747-146SR, {{suffered}} a rupture {{of the pressure}} bulkhead in its <b>tail</b> <b>section,</b> caused by undetected damage during a faulty repair to the rear bulkhead after a tailstrike seven years earlier. Pressurized air subsequently rushed out of the bulkhead and blew off the plane's vertical stabilizer, also severing all four of its hydraulic control systems. The pilots were {{able to keep the}} plane airborne for 32 minutes using differential engine power, but without any hydraulics or the stabilizing force of the vertical stabilizer, the plane eventually crashed in mountainous terrain. There were only 4 survivors among the 524 on board. This accident is the deadliest single-aircraft accident in history.|$|E

50|$|The European {{aircraft}} manufacturer Airbus uses knock-down kits to assemble A320 family aircraft outside Europe. The Airbus A320 {{final assembly line}} in Tianjin, China assembles fuselage, wing, and <b>tail</b> <b>sections</b> made in Europe with avionics and engines made in Europe or the United States and locally sourced components for interiors. Airbus has opened a similar A320 final assembly line in the United States in September 2015, located in Mobile, Alabama; again using European-made fuselages, wings, and <b>tail</b> <b>sections.</b> However, the Mobile final assembly line will use more locally sourced components than the Tianjin line; engines, interior components, and avionics will be sourced mainly from American suppliers. Both the Airbus Tianjin and Mobile plants receive their fuselages, wings, and <b>tail</b> <b>sections</b> from Europe via ocean freight using specially designed ships, as the plants are located in port cities.|$|R
5|$|The {{wreckage}} was too severely fragmented {{to determine}} the exact position of the rudders, elevators, flaps, and slats before impact and examination of eyewitness photographs showed only that the right wing slats were fully extended as the crew tried unsuccessfully to correct the steep roll they were in. The left wing slats could not be determined from the blurry color photographs, so they were sent to a laboratory in Palo Alto, California for digital analysis, a process that was pushing the limits of 1970s technology and necessitated large, complicated, and expensive equipment. The photographs were reduced to black-and-white, which {{made it possible to}} distinguish the slats from the wing itself and thus proved that they were retracted. In addition, it was also verified that the <b>tail</b> <b>section</b> of the aircraft was undamaged and the landing gear was down.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{similarity}} of the IAe-27a and Tank's redesign of the Ta 183, Juan Ignacio San Martín, {{the director of the}} Institute merged the two parallel projects as the IAe 33 Pulqui II. The fuselage of Tank's design was further adapted to use the IAe-27a's undercarriage. The shoulder-mounted, negative-incidence wings were swept back 40°, an even greater sweep angle than that of the Ta 183, and given a small amount of anhedral. Comparable to the Ta 183's engine placement, the Nene engine was situated aft of the cockpit, near the center of gravity with engine maintenance and service facilitated through the removal of the <b>tail</b> <b>section.</b> The airframe featured a graceful, 50° swept-back T-shaped empennage and a pressurized cockpit topped by a clear bubble-type canopy, faired into the dorsal fuselage. Armor was provided around the cockpit and a bulletproof windscreen was incorporated. Fuel capacity was initially 1,250 l (275 Imp. gal.) internally and 800 l (176 Imp. gal.) in the wings. Armament was planned to include four 20mm cannon, a pair mounted in a staggered, near-ventral position along each side of the fuselage slightly set back from the jet intake.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the crash}} Ana Lucia Cortez is {{an officer in the}} Los Angeles Police Department who becomes pregnant, but loses the baby after being shot by a suspect at a {{burglary}} scene. She spends several months in physical and psychological therapy, and when the suspect is arrested, she refuses to identify him. After his release, she kills him outside a bar. Ana Lucia decides to leave the force and eventually finds work as an airport security guard. She meets Christian Shephard (John Terry) at the airport bar, who asks her to accompany him to Sydney as a bodyguard, however in Sydney the two part ways. Ana Lucia buys a ticket on Oceanic Flight 815 to return to Los Angeles. In a brief flashback in the first season finale, she flirts with Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) at a bar at the airport, unaware he is Christian's son. The pair arrange to continue their conversation during the flight. During the flight the plane splits in half, with the two parts crashing on different sides of an island; Ana Lucia is one of the <b>tail</b> <b>section</b> survivors.|$|E

50|$|As {{there is}} {{increasing}} use of composite materials in aircraft construction (e.g. the Boeing 787 and the Airbus A350), delamination is an air safety concern, especially in the <b>tail</b> <b>sections</b> of the airplanes.|$|R

25|$|The fighter's wing {{collided}} with the top rear fuselage of the All American, almost cleaving the bomber's <b>tail</b> <b>section</b> off, leaving a large diagonal gash {{from the base of}} the All American's tail and severing the left horizontal stabilizer completely off the plane. Metal in the airframe near the right tailplane was the only thing keeping the <b>tail</b> <b>section,</b> housing the rear gunner, attached to the aircraft. The fighter broke apart, leaving some pieces in the bomber's fuselage.|$|E
40|$|AbstractLipid bilayer was {{deformed}} by the electrostatic/electrokinetic forces {{induced by}} the fixed charges on the top monolayer–solution interface. The strains, stresses and energy were simulated using finite element method. The elastic moduli of the heads were four times greater than those of <b>tails</b> <b>sections,</b> but were individually isotropic. The physics of the situation was evaluated using a coupled system of linear elastic equations and electrostatic–electrokinetic (Poisson–Nernst–Planck) equations. The Coulomb force (due to fixed charges in the electric field), and the dielectric force (due to uneven electric field and the solution-membrane permittivity mismatch) bend the membrane, but unevenly. Whereas the bottom monolayer extends vertically (towards charged surface), the top monolayer compresses. In contrast the top monolayer extends horizontally, but the bottom monolayer compresses. The horizontal normal stress is higher in the heads than in the <b>tails</b> <b>sections,</b> but is similar in two monolayers, whereas the vertical normal stress is small. The horizontal normal stress is associated with horizontal normal strain, and vertical with both vertical and horizontal strain. Surprisingly, the shear stress (an indicator where the membrane will deform), is greater in the <b>tails</b> <b>sections.</b> Finally, the elastic energy (which is clearly greater in the heads sections) is dominated by its horizontal component and peaks {{in the middle of}} the membrane. The shear component dominates in the <b>tails</b> <b>sections,</b> and is minimal in the membrane center. Even spatially uniform external force thus leads to complex membrane deformation and generates complex profiles of stress and elastic energy...|$|R
