5|$|An {{additional}} {{cause of}} delay, according <b>to</b> <b>Professor</b> Williams, was the long pause after the debacle of the Battle of Curupayty when the Allies overestimated the strength {{both of the}} opposing army and of Humaitá: they allowed López almost a year to rebuild his forces, devastated at the Battle of Tuyutí.|$|E

5|$|The {{belief of}} many {{followers}} that their founder was {{the incarnation of}} the Supreme God has also drawn criticism. According <b>to</b> <b>Professor</b> Raymond B.

Swaminarayan responded that he accepts gifts for the emancipation of his followers.|$|E

The Spannocchi bank, which housed much of Borja's wealth, was said to have nearly crashed after the conclave due to the velocity of transactions.|$|E
5|$|According <b>to</b> <b>professor</b> Nalini Natarajan of the University of Puerto Rico, Nargis's Mother India is a metonymic {{representation}} of a Hindu woman, reflecting high Hindu values, with virtuous morality and motherly self-sacrifice. Film scholar Jyotika Virdi wrote that Mother India could {{also be seen as}} a metaphor of the trinity of mother, God, and a dynamic nation. Vijay Mishra, in his 2002 book Bollywood Cinema: Temples of Desire, opined that the Mother India figure is an icon in several respects—being associated with a goddess, her function as a wife, as a lover, and even compromising her femininity {{at the end of the}} film by playing the role of Vishnu the Preserver and Shiva the Destroyer, masculine gods.|$|E
5|$|According to the Yugoslav {{census of}} 1931, the {{population}} of eastern Herzegovina comprised 4 per cent Croats, 28 per cent Muslims, and 68 per cent Serbs. According <b>to</b> <b>Professor</b> Jozo Tomasevich, the estimated population of the districts of Bileća, Gacko and Nevesinje was only around 1.1 per cent Croat, so in those areas nearly all the NDH government appointments and local Ustaše units were staffed by Muslims, an ethnic group that made up about 23.7 per cent of the local population. The poor Muslim peasants of eastern Herzegovina largely sided with the Ustaše. The NDH government immediately tried to strengthen their position by vilifying the Serbs, who, according to Tomasevich, comprised around 75 per cent of the population.|$|E

While they find the device works with inanimate objects, the living creatures they use it on always seem to die. When Dr. Patricia Hill (Mary Peach) arrives, she helps them fix the error, making Steiner think the problem has been solved. Meanwhile, Dr. Blanchard (Norman Wooland), Steiner's boss and head of the institute he works for, is being blackmailed by Mr. Latham (Derrick De Marney), who wants credit for Steiner's discovery. He forces Blanchard to demand Steiner to give a premature presentation <b>to</b> <b>Professor</b> Lembach (Gerard Heinz).|$|E

5|$|In 1826, Holmboe was {{appointed}} a lecturer at the Royal Frederick University.

5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1914, van Meegeren moved his family to Scheveningen. That year, he {{completed}} the diploma examination at the Royal Academy of Art in The Hague.

In March 1915, his daughter Pauline was born, later called Inez. To supplement his income, Han sketched posters and painted pictures for the commercial art trade, generally Christmas cards, still-life, landscapes, and portraits. Many of these paintings are quite valuable today.|$|E
