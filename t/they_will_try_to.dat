As in {{the final version of}} the episode, a narration scene with Rick speaking to Morgan on the walkie-talkie was included, but was re-shot with modified dialog that served to replace the above material, allowing the premiere to begin with the group putting Atlanta behind them. Rick sports his full sheriff's wardrobe in the reshoot, whereas in the original version he is wearing the white undershirt he was wearing in the Season 1 finale.|$|E

However, Danny feels {{comfortable}} talking to Ana, who seems to understand what he has been through. Ana assures Angie she is not going anywhere. Meanwhile, Katherine (Dana Delany) speaks to her psychiatrist at a mental clinic. She says the medicine is working, but she now realizes the person she has become and how much she has hurt her neighbors and friends. Karen (Kathryn Joosten) visits her and asks {{her to come back}} to Wisteria Lane, but Katherine says she will not come back because she does not feel she will be forgiven. Later, Karen returns with Bree, Lynette, Gabrielle and Susan, who comfort Katherine and say <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> forgive her.|$|E

25|$|Jewel spiders are {{considered}} harmless, though their web aggregations {{can be a}} nuisance to bushwalkers. They are not aggressive and will invariably flee from potential threats. When disturbed, <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> escape by clambering upside down along their support threads to nearby surfaces (albeit slowly due to their short stubby legs). Failing that, they will drop to the ground.|$|E

25|$|Prey {{is often}} flushed out of tall grass by the birds stomping on the {{surrounding}} vegetation. It also waits near fires, eating anything it can {{that is trying}} to escape. They can either catch prey by chasing it and striking with the bill and swallowing (usually with small prey), or stamping on prey until it is rendered stunned or unconscious enough to swallow. Larger or dangerous prey, such as venomous snakes, are instead stunned or killed by the bird jumping onto their backs, at which point <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> snap their necks or backs. There are some reports that, when capturing snakes, the secretary birds will take flight with their prey and then drop them to their death, although this has not been verified. Even with larger prey, food is generally swallowed whole through the birds' considerable gape. Occasionally, like other raptors, they will tear apart prey with their feet before consuming it.|$|E
25|$|In episode 4, Agnes urges Kat {{to return}} to Spain, and when Dermott learns of this, he confronts Agnes about taking him from his mother. In episode 5, Agnes tells Dermott to keep Kat away from the christening of Bernie Kelly's (Susan Ateh) baby, but Dermott says Kat has made him feel welcome and invited him to meet his {{brothers}} in Spain, so Agnes reveals that Dermott has a twin sister. Dermott confronts Kat over this, {{who said she was}} waiting for the right time and insists there is nothing else that Dermott does not know. In episode 6, Bernie, a local garda, asks Kat about the last time she saw Lance and Kat wonders if she suspects something happened, but Bernie denies this. Meanwhile, Kat is unaware that Alfie is having an operation on his brain tumour. Alfie asks Dermott to find Kat and bring her to the hospital, as it means they are unable to go back to Spain. Bernie works out that Dermott was involved in Lance's death, and sees him on the beach with Kat. Kat tells Dermott that Bernie was asking about him. He sees the garda arriving so takes Kat in a boat, saying <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> find the whale that was recently seen off the coast. Bernie shouts at him to stop and calls the coastguard. Kat asks Dermott if he did something to Lance. Dermott then accidentally crashes the boat into a rock and Kat is thrown into the water and then cut by the propellor. Dermott gets Kat out of the sea but there is nobody around to help. Meanwhile, Alfie has his operation but loses his pulse and the medical staff start to resuscitate.|$|E

According to the researchers, a mammoth cannot be recreated, but <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> eventually grow a hybrid elephant with some woolly mammoth traits in an [...] "artificial womb".|$|E
50|$|As an {{individual}} develops mortality salience, i.e. becomes {{more aware of}} the inevitability of death, <b>they</b> <b>will</b> instinctively <b>try</b> <b>to</b> suppress it out of fear. The method of suppression usually leads to mainstreaming towards cultural beliefs, leaning for external support rather than treading alone. This behavior may range from simply thinking about death to severe phobias and desperate actions.|$|R

2500|$|An {{estimated}} 150 million mammoths {{are buried}} in the frozen Siberian tundra. The use of this preserved genetic material to recreate or de-extinct living mammoths, has long been discussed theoretically but has only recently become the subject of formal effort due to advances in molecular biology techniques. As of 2015, there are several major ongoing projects, {{such as those of}} Akira Iritani of Japan and the Long Now Foundation, attempting to create a mammoth-elephant hybrid. According to the researchers, a mammoth cannot be recreated, but <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> eventually grow in an [...] "artificial womb" [...] a hybrid elephant with some wooly mammoth traits.|$|E

2500|$|Confucius' {{political}} beliefs were rooted in {{his belief that}} a good ruler would be self-disciplined, would govern his subjects through education and by his own example, and would seek to correct his subjects with love and concern rather than punishment and coercion. [...] "If the people be led by laws, and uniformity among them be sought by punishments, <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> escape punishment and {{have no sense of}} shame. If they are led by virtue, and uniformity sought among them through the practice of ritual propriety, they will possess a sense of shame and come to you of their own accord" [...] (Analects 2.3; see also 13.6). Confucius' political theories were directly contradictory to the Legalistic political orientations of China's rulers, and he failed to popularize his ideals among China's leaders within his own lifetime.|$|E
2500|$|Confucius's {{political}} thought {{is based upon}} his ethical thought. He argued that the best government is one that rules through [...] "rites" [...] (lǐ) and people's natural morality, and not by using bribery and coercion. He explained {{that this is one}} of the most important analects: [...] "If the people be led by laws, and uniformity sought to be given them by punishments, <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> avoid the punishment, but have no sense of shame. If they be led by virtue, and uniformity sought to be given them by the rules of propriety, they will have the sense of the shame, and moreover will become good." [...] (Translated by James Legge) in the Great Learning (...) [...] This [...] "sense of shame" [...] is an internalisation of duty, where the punishment precedes the evil action, instead of following it in the form of laws as in Legalism.|$|E
2500|$|Rusty James meets up {{with the}} Motorcycle Boy {{the next day in}} a pet store, where the latter is strangely fascinated with the Siamese {{fighting}} fish, which he refers to as [...] "rumble fish". Officer Patterson suspects <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> rob the store. The brothers leave and meet their father, who explains to Rusty James that, contrary to popular belief, neither his mother nor brother are crazy, but rather they were both born with an acute perception. The brothers go for a motorcycle ride through the city and arrive at the Pet Store where the Motorcycle Boy breaks in and starts to set the animals loose. Rusty James makes a last-gasp effort to convince his brother to reunite with him, but the Motorcycle Boy refuses, explaining that the differences between them are too great for them to ever have the life Rusty James speaks of. The Motorcycle Boy takes the fish and rushes to free them in the river, but is shot by Officer Patterson before he can. Rusty James, after hearing the gunshot, finishes his brother's last attempt while a large crowd of people converges on his body.|$|E
25|$|Female {{resistance}} {{has rarely}} {{been found to be}} effective. Male mammals and birds are usually larger than females, and the sheer size and strength difference makes this very difficult. However, it has been observed in some species, such as squirrel monkeys, patas monkeys, vervets, and captive chimpanzees, that females can “gang up” on males when they are being aggressive. <b>They</b> <b>will</b> even <b>try</b> <b>to</b> protect a female in distress. Females have even been observed to kill immigrant males in wild red colobus monkeys.|$|R

2500|$|When the {{families}} finally meet for the eventual “pamamanhikan” at the palatial Fuentebella residence, what starts as a civilized encounter between two families escalates into a hilarious rich-versus-poor mano-a-mano where Tracy's grandfather (Jaime Fabregas) insulted the Polotan's family, {{a scenario that}} turns the mansion into a madhouse of outlandish proportions which resulted in Rock and Tracy's separation. Rock got depressed and did not leave his room for three days. [...] He was confronted by his mother Rose, saying that life must go on. Rose thinks her son is still young for fatherhood, so she is {{not in favor of}} the marriage. Nick thinks the family would be in shame if Tracy will raise a child with no father, so he wants the wedding to push through as soon as possible. Elaine, who also got pregnant at a young age does not want her daughter to experience a forced marriage and get trapped in a loveless marriage as {{what had happened to her}} and her husband, Nick. Elaine suggested that it would be better if Tracey would just go to the USA and give birth there, but before Tracy's departure, Rock was able to sneak into Tracy's room, and they elope. The two then sent an MMS to their families stating that they got married in the City hall. The two parties become so depressed because of Rock and Tracey's decision. Elaine seems to be disappointed with Nick. She thinks that Nick is not a good father to Tracy so their daughter grew up to be imperfect person. She decides to leave, but on her way out of the estate, Nick stops her and professes his undying love, stating that it would be best if <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> start again. On the other hand, Rose and Pol also renew their love. Meanwhile, Brent (Coleta), Rock's best friend who is a closeted gay and is secretly in love with Rock, professes his love when they were drunk but the two remain best friends. In the end, the two families are able to accept the fate of Rock and Tracy who become parents at 19. The movie ends with the cast singing [...] "Pag-Ibig", and [...] "I Do Bidoo Bidoo".|$|E
