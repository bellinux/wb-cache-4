25|$|Technology {{is often}} a {{consequence}} of science and engineering, although technology as a human activity precedes the two fields. For example, science might study the flow of electrons in electrical conductors by using already-existing tools and knowledge. This new-found knowledge may then be used by engineers to create new <b>tools</b> <b>and</b> <b>machines</b> such as semiconductors, computers, {{and other forms of}} advanced technology. In this sense, scientists and engineers may both be considered technologists; the three fields are often considered as one for the purposes of research and reference.|$|E

2500|$|Technology can be most {{broadly defined}} as the entities, both {{material}} and immaterial, created by the application of mental and physical effort {{in order to achieve}} some value. In this usage, technology refers to <b>tools</b> <b>and</b> <b>machines</b> that may be used to solve real-world problems. It is a far-reaching term that may include simple tools, such as a crowbar or wooden spoon, or more complex machines, such as a space station or particle accelerator. <b>Tools</b> <b>and</b> <b>machines</b> need not be material; virtual technology, such as computer software and business methods, fall under this definition of technology. W. Brian Arthur defines technology in a similarly broad way as [...] "a means to fulfill a human purpose." ...|$|E

In one wing of the Visitor Center is a life-size replica of the Wright brothers' 1903 Flyer, the first powered heavier-than-air aircraft in history to achieve controlled flight (the original being displayed at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington D.C.). [...] A full-scale model of the Brothers' 1902 glider is also present, having been constructed under the direction of Orville Wright himself. Adorning the walls of the glider room are portraits and photographs of other flight pioneers throughout history.|$|E
2500|$|Evans {{was born}} in Stroud, Gloucestershire, England on 1 January 1941. His mother was a teacher. His father {{maintained}} a mechanical workshop and taught Evans to use <b>tools</b> <b>and</b> <b>machines</b> including a lathe. Evans was close to his grandfather who was a choir master at a Baptist Church for over 40 years, and whose main interests were music, poetry, and the Baptist Church. His mother's brother was a professor of astronomy at the University of Cambridge. As a boy Evans was quiet, shy and inquisitive. He liked science, and his parents encouraged his education. He remembers loving old science books and receiving an electric experimental set which he wanted for Christmas. He attributes to a chemistry set, from which he learned basic chemistry, {{for the development of}} one of his [...] "greatest amateur passions". He went to middle school at St Dunstan's College, an independent school for boys in South East London, where he started chemistry and physics classes, and studied biology. He worked hard studying for the University of Cambridge entrance exams. At school {{he was one of the}} best pupils, although not at the top of the class.|$|E

40|$|Paper {{describes}} {{means and}} methods for computer based optimisation of production processes {{using a new}} approach based on technological database (TDB) with genetic algorithm incorporated into a database management system (DBMS). The TDB serves as a store of <b>tools</b> <b>and</b> <b>machine</b> <b>tools</b> from which they can be assigned to different work operations. Work operations are basic entities of orders placed into queues. The goal of the model is to find available resources from the TDB in order to empty the queue in shortest time with lowest costs. To this purpose the model consist the technological database whose DBMS includes a genetic algorithm based optimiser. It checks the orders queue and searches for appropriate combinations of <b>tools</b> <b>and</b> <b>machine</b> <b>tools</b> from the TDB, which can be combined into needed work operations. It also performs an optimisation of time and costs according to so called static parameters of <b>tools</b> <b>and</b> <b>machine</b> <b>tools...</b>|$|R

60|$|Kit mused while Adam beckoned a mulatto steward, {{who brought}} him a glass and some ice. His uncle's {{character}} was complex. Sometimes he was hard and exacted all that was his; sometimes he was rashly generous. Ostensibly, he was a merchant, shipping <b>tools</b> <b>and</b> <b>machines,</b> particularly supplies for sugar mills, to the countries round the Caribbean, and taking payment in native produce. Kit, however, knew the cases landed from the Rio Negro did not always hold the goods the labels stated, and that Adam's money sometimes helped to float an unpopular government over a crisis and sometimes to turn another out. It was a risky business, carried on with people who had a talent for dark revolutionary intrigue.|$|E
60|$|The Earl of Carbury was a youngish {{man with}} no sort of turn for being a nobleman. He could {{not bring himself to}} behave as if he was anybody in particular; and though this passed for perfect {{breeding}} whenever he by chance appeared in his place in society, on the magisterial bench, or in the House of Lords, it prevented him from making the most of the earldom, and was a standing grievance with his relatives, many of whom were the most impudent and uppish people {{on the face of the}} earth. He was, if he had only known it, a born republican, with no natural belief in earls at all; but as he was rather too modest to indulge his consciousness with broad generalizations of this kind, all he knew about the matter was that he was sensible of being a bad hand at his hereditary trade of territorial aristocrat. At a very early age he had disgraced himself by asking his mother whether he might be a watchmaker when he grew up, and his feeble sense on that occasion of the impropriety of an earl being anything whatsoever except an earl had given his mother an imperious contempt for him which afterward got curiously mixed with a salutary dread of his moral superiority to her, which was considerable. His aspiration to become a watchmaker was an early symptom of his extraordinary turn for mechanics. An apprenticeship of six years at the bench would have made an educated workman of him: as it was, he pottered at every mechanical pursuit as a gentleman amateur in a laboratory and workshop which he had got built for himself in his park. In this magazine of toys--for such it virtually was at first--he satisfied his itchings to play with <b>tools</b> <b>and</b> <b>machines.</b> He was no sportsman; but if he saw in a shop window the most trumpery patent improvement in a breechloader, he would go in and buy it; and as to a new repeating rifle or liquefied gas gun, he would travel to St. Petersburg to see it. He wrote very little; but he had sixteen different typewriters, each guaranteed perfect by an American agent, who had also pledged himself that the other fifteen were miserable impostures. A really ingenious bicycle or tricycle always found in him a ready purchaser; and he had patented a roller skate and a railway brake. When the electric chair for dental operations was invented, he sacrificed a tooth to satisfy his curiosity as to its operation. He could not play brass instruments to any musical purpose; but his collection of double slide trombones, bombardons with patent compensating pistons, comma trumpets, and the like, would have equipped a small military band; whilst his newly tempered harmonium with fifty-three notes to each octave, and his pianos with simplified keyboards that nobody could play on, were the despair of all musical amateurs who came to stay at Towers Cottage, as his place was called. He would buy the most expensive and elaborate lathe, and spend a month trying to make a true billiard ball at it. At the end of that time he would have to send for a professional hand, who would cornet the ball with apparently miraculous skill in a few seconds. He got on better with chemistry and photography; but at last he settled down to electrical engineering, and, giving up the idea of doing everything with his own half-trained hand, kept a skilled man always in his laboratory to help him out.|$|E
