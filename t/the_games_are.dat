5|$|Chrono Cross employs story arcs, characters, {{and themes}} from , a Satellaview side story to Chrono Trigger {{released}} in Japan. An illustrated text adventure, Radical Dreamers {{was created to}} wrap up an unresolved plot line of Chrono Trigger. Though it borrows from Radical Dreamers in its exposition, Chrono Cross is not a remake of Radical Dreamers, but a larger effort to fulfill that game's purpose; the plots of <b>the</b> <b>games</b> <b>are</b> irreconcilable. To resolve continuity issues and acknowledge Radical Dreamers, the developers of Chrono Cross suggested the game happened in a parallel dimension. A notable {{difference between the two}} games is that Magus—present in Radical Dreamers as Gil—is absent from Chrono Cross. Director Masato Kato originally planned for Magus to appear in disguise as Guile, but scrapped the idea due to plot difficulties. In the DS version of Chrono Trigger, Kato teases the possibility of an amnesiac Magus.|$|E
5|$|Ivy's {{alternate}} character {{designs in}} <b>the</b> <b>games</b> <b>are</b> {{a contrast to}} her primary designs, with the secondary from Soulcalibur to Soulcalibur III consisting of countess attire of either blue or red pants, vest, and jacket, with white boots covering her feet and her hair combed back. In Soulcalibur II, a tertiary alternate design was added consisting of a red leotard and gloves with gold trimming, with red stockings on her legs; in addition, a fourth design resembling her appearance {{at the conclusion of}} Soulcalibur was considered, incorporating a cloak and the symbol of caduceus on the front of her leotard cupping her breasts, but was unused. In Soulcalibur III, a long, rose-themed dress with hat and veil was used as a tertiary alternate, one of several considered designs. For Soulcalibur IV, a similarly themed black dress was used as her sole alternate design for the game.|$|E
5|$|Like {{previous}} Pokémon games, Diamond and Pearl chronicle {{the adventures}} of a young Pokémon trainer as he/she trains and battles Pokémon while also thwarting the schemes of a criminal organization. The games add many new features, such as Internet play over the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection and changes to battle mechanics and Pokémon Contests, along with addition of 107 new Pokémon. <b>The</b> <b>games</b> <b>are</b> independent of each other but feature largely the same plot and while both can be played separately, {{it is necessary to}} trade between them in order to complete the games' Pokédexes.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>game</b> <b>was</b> {{developed}} by Bet Technology, {{a small company}} based in Carson City, Nevada. The patent on <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>was</b> filed in 1993.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>game</b> <b>was</b> {{developed}} by Insanity.

5|$|Pokémon HeartGold Version and SoulSilver Version are {{enhanced}} remakes of Pokémon Gold and Silver. <b>The</b> <b>games</b> <b>are</b> {{part of the}} Pokémon {{series of}} role-playing video games, and were developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo DS. First released in Japan on September 12, 2009, the games were later released to North America, Australia, and Europe during March 2010. Game director Shigeki Morimoto aimed to respect the feelings of those who played the previous games, while also ensuring that {{it felt like a}} new game to those that were introduced to the series in more recent years. Reception to the games was highly positive, the two being amongst the highest rated DS games of all time on Metacritic. Commercially, the two are among the best-selling Nintendo DS games of all time, with combined sales of 10million units as of July 29, 2010.|$|E
5|$|Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver are {{role-playing}} {{video games}} with adventure elements. The basic mechanics of <b>the</b> <b>games</b> <b>are</b> largely {{the same as}} their predecessors'. As with all Pokémon games for hand-held consoles, gameplay is viewed from a third-person overhead perspective, and consists of three basic screens: a field map, in which the player navigates the main character; a battle screen; and the menu, in which the player configures his party, items, or gameplay settings. The player begins the game with one Pokémon and can capture more using Poké Balls. The player can also use the Pokémon to battle or deceive others, often forming alliances or trends via the Team Rocket networks.|$|E
5|$|Pokémon Red and Blue allow {{players to}} trade Pokémon between two {{cartridges}} via a Game Link Cable. This method of trading {{must be done}} to fully complete the Pokédex since certain Pokémon will only evolve upon being traded and each of the two games have version-exclusive Pokémon. The Link Cable also makes it possible to battle another player's Pokémon team. When playing Red or Blue on a Game Boy Advance or SP, the standard GBA/SP link cable will not work; players must use the Nintendo Universal Game Link Cable instead. Moreover, the English versions of <b>the</b> <b>games</b> <b>are</b> incompatible with their Japanese counterparts, and such trades will corrupt the save files, as the games use different languages and therefore character sets.|$|E
50|$|In bandy, <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>is</b> {{restarted}} with a face-off when <b>the</b> <b>game</b> has <b>been</b> temporarily interrupted. The face-off is executed on {{the place}} where the ball <b>was</b> situated when <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>was</b> interrupted. If <b>the</b> ball was inside the penalty area when <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>was</b> interrupted, <b>the</b> face-off is moved to the nearest free-stroke point on the penalty line.|$|R

5|$|Shattered Memories was {{published}} by Konami for the Wii in North America on 8 December 2009; in Europe on 26 February 2010; and in Japan on 25 March 2010. The Australian release was delayed until 22 June 2010, due to European supply problems caused by the economic effects of the 2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull. Major Australian retailers struggled to confirm available copies of the game for several months after the delayed release, potentially damaging initial sales of the game. The PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable versions were published in North America on 19 January 2010; in Europe on 26 February 2010; in Japan on 25 March 2010; and in Australia on 22 Apri 2010.

Compatibility with PS Vita was planned but cancelled; <b>the</b> <b>games</b> <b>are</b> currently only available for the PSP.|$|E
5|$|Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels is a 1986 side-scrolling, {{platform}} {{video game}} developed {{and published by}} Nintendo as the first sequel to their 1985 bestseller Super Mario Bros. <b>The</b> <b>games</b> <b>are</b> similar in style and gameplay, apart from a steep increase in difficulty. Like the original, Mario or Luigi venture to rescue the Princess from Bowser. Unlike the original, the game has no two-player option and Luigi is differentiated from his twin plumber brother with reduced ground friction and increased jump height. The Lost Levels also introduces setbacks such as poison mushroom power-ups, counterproductive level warps, and mid-air wind gusts. The game has 32 levels across eight worlds, and five bonus worlds.|$|E
5|$|The Kingdom Hearts games contain {{elements}} of action role-playing video games with hack-and-slash elements. <b>The</b> <b>games</b> <b>are</b> {{driven by a}} linear progression from one story event to the next, usually shown {{in the form of}} a cutscene, though there are numerous side quests available that provide bonus benefits to the characters. In most games, the player primarily controls the principal protagonist of the series, Sora. Sora is usually accompanied by Donald Duck and Goofy, who are artificial intelligence-controlled non-playable characters that aid Sora in battle. In the first and third game, their behavior can be altered to suit different combat objectives. The games feature real-time combat that incorporates physical attacks, magic, and summonings, though each game handles battles differently. The game also allows for items to be used on the field of battle to heal oneself or one's party members.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>game</b> <b>was</b> {{announced}} by Sega at the SCEJA Press Conference in September 2013 prior to <b>the</b> Tokyo <b>Game</b> Show. <b>The</b> <b>game</b> <b>was</b> {{described as having}} a strong storyline, and emphasis on the single player mode.

5|$|The Main Media Centre of the 2010 Commonwealth Games managed media-related activities, and {{comprised}} the International Broadcasting Centre and the Main Press Centre. It {{was set up}} in close proximity to the Games Village and the main venues at Pragati Maidan. State owned agencies managed both centres, with host broadcaster Prasar Bharti managing the International Broadcasting Centre and the Press Information Bureau managing the Main Press Centre. It was believed that by the time <b>the</b> <b>Games</b> <b>are</b> held, New Delhi would stop analogue broadcast and begin digital broadcast through a conditional access system, for which it is the first city in India to do so.|$|E
5|$|The closing {{ceremony}} of the Commonwealth Games takes place after all sporting events have concluded. Flag-bearers from each participating country enter the stadium, {{followed by the}} athletes who enter together, without any national distinction. The president of the organizing committee and the CGF president make their closing speeches and <b>the</b> <b>Games</b> <b>are</b> officially closed. The CGF president also speaks about {{the conduct of the}} games. The mayor of the city that organized the Games transfers the CGF flag {{to the president of the}} CGF, who then passes it on to the mayor of the city hosting the next Commonwealth Games. The next host nation then also briefly introduces itself with artistic displays of dance and theater representative of its culture. Many great artists and singers had performed at the ceremonies of the Commonwealth Games.|$|E
5|$|The first live {{coverage}} of a Belgian sporting event occurred on 3May 1931, when journalist Gust De Muynck commentated on the football game between Belgium and the Netherlands on radio. Later, football broadcasts were also televised. As 60 per cent of Belgians speak Dutch and 40 per cent French, commentaries for the national team matches are provided in both languages. <b>The</b> <b>games</b> <b>are</b> not broadcast in German—Belgium's third official language. During Belgium's tournament appearances in the 1980s and the early 1990s, Rik De Saedeleer crowned himself the nation's most famous football commentator with his emotional and humorous reports.|$|E
