40|$|In {{the present}} work two {{different}} metal deposition processes for the electroless nickel immersion gold (ENIG) surface plating are characterized in “Deep Eutectic Solvents” (DES). It is shown {{for the first}} time that the immersion nickel deposition on copper substrates in a DES based electrolyte can be realized despite the fact that in aqueous solutions the redox potentials would not allow the displacement deposition. For the immersion gold process an electrolyte is developed which allows a defined immersion gold deposition on nickelphosphorus alloys, without environmentally harmful cyanide as a complexing agent. The immersion nickel deposition in DES is a promising alternative <b>to</b> the <b>palladium</b> <b>plating</b> commonly used for the "activation of the copper surface“ before the reductive plating of nickel-phosphorus alloys in the ENIG process. By the spectroscopic and electrochemical characterization of the copper and nickel electrolytes it is demonstrated that the prerequisite for an exchange process during the immersion gold deposition is constituted by the superposition of the reduction of the nickel complex and the oxidation of copper at the mixed potential. The required anodic shift of the reduction potential is made possible due to the low water and high chloride content of the DESs and the resulting formation of the electroactive tetrachloronickelate(II) complex [NiCl 4] 2 -. The immersion deposition of nickel in these electrolytes with a resulting thickness of approximately 3 nm on the copper substrate is sufficient to catalyze the following deposition of the nickel-phosphorous alloy. First soldering and bonding tests with the “immersion nickel activated” ENIG substrates show that the materials science requirements are fulfilled. The gold electrolyte developed in this work contains sodium tetrachloroaurate Na[AuCl 4] as metal source. The electroactive gold complex in the DES based electrolytes is identified as the trivalent tetrachloroaurate complex [AuCl 4]- via UV-Vis spectroscopy. Electrochemical measurements reveal that the reduction of [AuCl 4]- proceeds either in one broad reduction wave or in two separated steps, dependent on the nucleation overpotential of the substrate. The monovalent chloroaurate complex [AuCl 2]- is formed as an intermediate during the deposition and the dissolution of gold. In contrast to aqueous solutions where [AuCl 2]- disproportionates quickly it is stabilized in the DES. Due to the enhanced stability of the monovalent chloride complex the potential difference between the nickel oxidation and the gold reduction is lowered. This offers the possibility for a uniform immersion gold deposition with a thickness of about 50 nm without toxic complexing agents like cyanide in the electrolyte. Both deposition processes are further characterized using in-situ measurements with an electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (ECQCM). In addition ex-situ techniques like Xray fluorescence (XRF) and Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) are used to underline the experimental results with information about the thickness and the morphology of the deposited layers. Diffusion coefficients for the chloroaurate complex are determined using a rotating disc electrode (RDE) ...|$|R

Although {{there is evidence that}} platinum refinery workers may also be sensitized to other precious metals, such as palladium or rhodium, no instances of occupational asthma due to an isolated sensitization <b>to</b> <b>palladium</b> have been reported. A case is reported of occupational rhinoconjunctivitis and asthma in a previously healthy worker exposed to the fumes of an electroplating bath containing palladium.

The skin-prick test was positive with Pd(NH 3) 4 Cl 2, but not with (NH 4) 2 PdCl 4. Corresponding salts of platinum were all negative. A bronchial provocation test with Pd(NH 3) 4 Cl 2 (0. 0001 % for a total of 315 s, followed by 0. 001 % for a total of 210 s) led to an early decrease in forced expiratory volume in one second (- 35 %).
