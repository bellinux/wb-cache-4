50|$|Modern {{influence}} mines {{such as the}} BAE Stonefish are computerised, {{with all}} the programmability that this implies e.g. the ability to quickly load new acoustic signatures into fuzes, or program them to detect a single, highly distinctive <b>target</b> <b>signature.</b> In this way, a mine with a passive acoustic fuze can be programmed to ignore all friendly vessels and small enemy vessels, only detonating when a very large enemy target passes over it. Alternatively, the mine can be programmed specifically to ignore all surface vessels regardless of size and exclusively target submarines.|$|E

Launched using an elevating ramp, two solid rocket boosters provided initial thrust upon launch, with the ramjets igniting {{at a speed}} of Mach 1.7. Command guidance was used for control; the aircraft could be fitted with electronic enhancers and flares to boost its <b>target</b> <b>signature.</b> Two types were produced, the CT.41A for high-altitude use, and the CT.41B for low-altitude training. If the drone was not shot down, recovery was via parachute.|$|E

40|$|The Multiple Instance Hybrid Estimator for discriminative target {{characterization}} from imprecisely labeled hyperspectral data is presented. In many hyperspectral target detection problems, acquiring accurately labeled {{training data}} is difficult. Furthermore, each pixel containing target {{is likely to}} be a mixture of both <b>target</b> and non-target <b>signatures</b> (i. e., sub-pixel targets), making extracting a pure prototype <b>signature</b> for the <b>target</b> class from the data extremely difficult. The proposed approach addresses these problems by introducing a data mixing model and optimizing the response of the hybrid sub-pixel detector within a multiple instance learning framework. The proposed approach iterates between estimating a set of discriminative <b>target</b> and non-target <b>signatures</b> and solving a sparse unmixing problem. After learning <b>target</b> <b>signatures,</b> a signature based detector can then be applied on test data. Both simulated and real hyperspectral target detection experiments show the proposed algorithm is effective at learning discriminative <b>target</b> <b>signatures</b> and achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art comparison algorithms...|$|R

50|$|Modern {{influence}} mines {{are designed}} to discriminate against false inputs and are therefore much harder to sweep. They often contain inherent anti-sweeping mechanisms. For example, they may be programmed {{to respond to the}} unique noise of a particular ship-type, its associated magnetic signature and the typical pressure displacement of such a vessel. As a result, a mine-sweeper must accurately guess and mimic the required <b>target</b> <b>signature</b> in order to trigger detonation. The task is {{complicated by the fact that}} an influence mine may have one or more of a hundred different potential target signatures programmed into it.|$|E

50|$|The entire {{electromagnetic}} spectrum highlighting the infrared part located between the visible {{and the radio}} waves, is depicted in the figure. The IR spectrum can be subdivided into 5 regions, although this definition is somehow arbitrary and it differs from one author to another. The subdivision presented here {{is based on a}} combination of the atmospheric transmittance windows, i.e. the wavelengths regions in which infrared radiation is better transmitted through the atmosphere, the detector materials used to build the infrared sensors and the main applications. In this way, the Near Infrared (NIR) band is mostly used in fiber optic telecommunication systems since silica (SiO2) provides a low attenuation losses medium for the infrared, whilst the Short Wave Infrared (SWIR) band allows to work on long-distance telecommunications (remote sensing) using a combinations of detector materials. The Medium Wavelength Infrared (MWIR) and the Long Wavelength Infrared (LWIR) bands find applications in Infrared Thermography for military or civil applications, e.g. <b>target</b> <b>signature</b> identification, surveillance, NonDestructive Evaluation, etc. The Very Long Wavelength Infrared (VLWIR) band is used in spectroscopy and astronomy.|$|E

40|$|An {{approach}} for predicting radar <b>signatures</b> of <b>targets</b> located behind wind farms is proposed in this paper. Due {{to the complexity}} of a realistic scenario, a high-frequency method based on ray tracing is used for simulating the influence of wind turbines on the <b>target's</b> <b>signature.</b> The simulations require either an unambiguous range larger than the whole scenario or time-gating of the received signals, in order to eliminate aliasing effects caused from scattering centers outside the range cell of interest. Both approaches show that the simulated data contains enough information for detecting a target even at large distance behind a wind farm, which is a prerequisite for investigating the influence of wind turbines on <b>target</b> <b>signatures...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{theory of}} {{institutions}} does not assume {{anything about the}} nature of the logical system. That is, models and sentences may be arbitrary objects; the only assumption is that there is a satisfaction relation between models and sentences, telling whether a sentence holds in a model or not. Satisfaction is inspired by Tarski's truth definition, but can in fact be any binary relation.A crucial feature of institutions now is that models, sentences and their satisfaction are always being considered to live in some vocabulary or context (called signature) that defines the (non-logical) symbols that may be used in sentences and that need to be interpreted in models. Moreover, signature morphisms allow to extend signatures, change notation etc. Nothing is assumed about signatures and signature morphisms except that signature morphisms can be composed; this amounts to having a category of signatures and morphisms. Finally, it is assumed that signature morphisms lead to translations of sentences and models in a way that satisfaction is preserved. While sentences are translated along with signature morphisms (think of symbols being replaced along the morphism), models are translated (or better: reduced) against signature morphisms: for example, in case of a signature extension, a model of the (larger) <b>target</b> <b>signature</b> may be reduced to a model of the (smaller) source signature by just forgetting some components of the model.|$|E

40|$|Signature-based {{detectors}} for hyperspectral target detection rely on {{knowing the}} specific <b>target</b> <b>signature</b> in advance. However, <b>target</b> <b>signature</b> are often {{difficult or impossible}} to obtain. Furthermore, common methods for obtaining target signatures, such as from laboratory measurements or manual selection from an image scene, usually do not capture the discriminative features of target class. In this paper, an approach for estimating a discriminative <b>target</b> <b>signature</b> from imprecise labels is presented. The proposed approach maximizes {{the response of the}} hybrid sub-pixel detector within a multiple instance learning framework and estimates a set of discriminative target signatures. After learning target signatures, any signature based detector can then be applied on test data. Both simulated and real hyperspectral target detection experiments are shown to illustrate the effectiveness of the method...|$|E
40|$|Practical {{aircraft}} design for sonic boom minimization {{is a complex}} process that needs significant manual iteration to obtain configurations that match the <b>target</b> <b>signatures.</b> The <b>target</b> <b>signatures</b> have traditionally {{been the result of}} application of classical sonic boom minimization theory. However, traditional <b>target</b> <b>signatures</b> are not ideal to the {{aircraft design}} problem for several reasons. Firstly, they are not flexible enough with respect to the trade-off between boom minimization and other performance measures. Additionally, they do not offer a mechanism to allow practical front and aft shaped ground signatures or control over the volume constraints in aircraft design. Feasible design practices call for a procedure wherein not only the aircraft geometry is modified to reach a target equivalent area distribution, but also the target distribution itself is modified while still resulting in a low boom signature on the ground. This adds additional flexibility to the process of target matching as the designer has more degrees of freedom at his/her disposal. This paper proposes a generalized analytical F-function, extends the classical sonic boom minimization theory and demonstrates the equivalence of the optimal analytical formulation and the minimization theory in the generation of front and aft shaped profiles...|$|R

40|$|We {{developed}} {{four new}} techniques to visualize hyper spectral image data for man-in-the-loop target detection. The methods respectively: (1) display the subsequent bands {{as a movie}} (movie), (2) map the data onto three channels and display these as a colour image (colour), (3) display {{the correlation between the}} pixel signatures and a known <b>target</b> <b>signature</b> (match) and (4) display the output of a standard anomaly detector (anomaly). The movie technique requires no assumptions about the <b>target</b> <b>signature</b> and involves no information loss. The colour technique produces a single image that can be displayed in real-time. A disadvantage of this technique is loss of information. A display of the match between a <b>target</b> <b>signature</b> and pixels and can be interpreted easily and fast, but this technique relies on precise knowledge of the <b>target</b> <b>signature.</b> The anomaly detector signifies pixels with signatures that deviate from the (local) background. We performed a target detection experiment with human observers to determine their relative performance with the four techniques,. The results show that the match presentation yields the best performance, followed by movie and anomaly, while performance with the colour presentation was the poorest. Each scheme has its advantages and disadvantages and is more or less suited for real-time and post-hoc processing. The rationale is that the final interpretation is best done by a human observer. In contrast to automatic target recognition systems, the interpretation of hyper spectral imagery by the human visual system is robust to noise and image transformations and requires a minimal number of assumptions (about signature of target and background, target shape etc.) When more knowledge about target and background is available this may be used to help the observer interpreting the data (aided target detection) ...|$|E
