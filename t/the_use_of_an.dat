He uses electronic music technology that integrates synthesizers, electric guitars and keyboards, drum machines, rhythm boxes and MIDI with large orchestras that feature traditional instruments such as the veena, venu, nadaswaram, dholak, mridangam and tabla as well as Western lead instruments such as saxophones and flutes.|$|E
5|$|Porosity, {{often not}} visible {{without the use}} of {{advanced}} nondestructive testing methods, is a serious concern because it can potentially weaken the weld. Another defect affecting the strength of the weld is poor fusion, though it is often easily visible. It is caused by low current, contaminated joint surfaces, or <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> improper electrode.|$|E

25|$|Each {{state may}} {{determine}} the extent to which <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> jury is <b>used.</b> <b>The</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> jury is optional for civil trials in any Australian state. <b>The</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> jury in criminal trials is generally by unanimous verdict of 12 lay members of the public. Some States provide exceptions such as majority (11-to-1 or 10-to-2) verdicts where a jury cannot otherwise reach a verdict. Sometimes a state law may allow an accused person to elect to use a judge-only trial rather than the default jury provision.|$|R
5|$|Sloped, {{vertical}} or upside-down welding {{requires more}} operator skill, and often necessitates <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> electrode that solidifies quickly {{to prevent the}} molten metal from flowing out of the weld pool. However, this generally means that the electrode melts less quickly, thus increasing {{the time required to}} lay the weld.|$|E
5|$|The drop itself became {{computerized}} through <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> electric winch synced {{with the}} National Institute of Standards and Technology's time signal; {{the new system}} was not without issues, however, as a glitch caused the ball to pause for a short moment halfway through its descent.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> {{aluminium}} {{body was}} controversial, and international experts {{recommended that the}} tram company should not choose that solution. The goal was to decrease the weight so the trams could operate with less-powerful motors, giving a lower cost. The first prototype was a full-scale model of a tram, built at Homansbyen Depot in 1935, using an undercarriage from disused horsecars.|$|E

5|$|Ape Escape is a {{platform}} video game, developed by SCE Japan Studio {{and published by}} Sony Computer Entertainment. It was released for the PlayStation in May 1999 in North America, and June 1999 in Japan. The first in the Ape Escape series, the game {{tells the story of}} an ape named Specter who gains enhanced intelligence and a malevolent streak through <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> experimental helmet. Specter produces an army of apes, which he sends through time in an attempt to rewrite history. Spike, the player character, sets out to capture the apes with the aid of special gadgets.|$|E
5|$|As Jolie {{preferred}} to dedicate {{herself to her}} humanitarian work, her cinematic output remained infrequent. First They Killed My Father (2017), a drama set during Cambodia's Khmer Rouge era, again enabled her to combine both interests. In addition to directing the film, she co-wrote the screenplay with her longtime friend Loung Ung, whose memoirs about the regime's child labor camps served as its source material. Intended primarily for a Cambodian audience, the film was produced directly for Netflix, which allowed for <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> exclusively Khmer cast and script. Jolie is next contracted to reprise the role of Maleficent in Disney's sequel.|$|E

5|$|During {{the first}} stage of development, the game had no {{co-operative}} multiplayer mode; it focused on the story instead of the cyberpunk element. A year after development began, the game was sent for reworking because the studio thought they had not captured the essence of the Syndicate series. The team had little experience in making a co-operative games due to technological restraints, but decided to experiment with it. The internal reception of the co-op prototype was positive; testers said it fit with the canonical fiction of the franchise. The team had once worked on a competitive multiplayer mode for the game, but thought it was not original enough for inclusion. As the game lacked a cooperative multiplayer element, the developers abandoned <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> online pass, unlike most EA games at that time.|$|E
5|$|Healthcare {{reform was}} a major topic during the 2008 Democratic presidential primaries. As the race narrowed, {{attention}} focused on the plans presented by the two leading candidates, Hillary Clinton and the eventual nominee, Barack Obama. Each candidate proposed a plan to cover the approximately 45million Americans estimated to not have health insurance at some point each year. Clinton's proposal would have required all Americans to obtain coverage (in effect, an individual mandate), while Obama's proposal provided a subsidy but rejected <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> individual mandate.|$|E
5|$|In 1867 the world's first {{football}} tournament, the Youdan Cup, {{was played}} under the rules. The tournament involved 12 local sides and was played during February and March. The tournament committee decided on <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> off-field referee to award free kicks for infringements. The final {{took place on}} 5 March and was only the second football match to take place at Bramall Lane. A crowd of 3,000, a world record attendance, watched Hallam F.C. claim the cup by scoring two rouges {{in the last five}} minutes to win two rouges to one. The Sheffield Football Association was founded following the tournament. The 12 teams involved in the tournament were joined by Sheffield F.C. to become the founding members. The association adopted the Sheffield Rules without any changes. They were the first of several regional Football Associations that sprung up over the following decade.|$|E

5|$|In the 1820s {{a number}} of {{proposals}} for a railway between Manchester and Bolton were made, some well advanced enough to be submitted to Parliament. One, in 1825, was for a line from New Bailey in Salford, to Park Field in Bolton, and included a branch line to the Mersey and Irwell Navigation. The plan included <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> inclined plane at Clifton to allow the railway to access the higher ground from thereon. Another scheme was {{to connect with the}} planned Liverpool and Manchester Railway near Eccles, and would reach Bolton via Moorside and Farnworth. Neither of these schemes progressed beyond the early stages of planning. In 1830 two more proposals to connect the towns were made. The Manchester to Preston Railway was unsuccessful, leaving open the way for the second scheme, which would become known as the Manchester and Bolton Railway.|$|E
5|$|In {{their early}} years, Leicester played at {{numerous}} grounds, but have only played at two since {{they joined the}} Football League. When first starting out they played on a field by the Fosse Road, hence the original name Leicester Fosse. They moved from there to Victoria Park, and subsequently to Belgrave Road. Upon turning professional the club moved to Mill Lane. After eviction from Mill Lane the club played at the County Cricket ground while seeking a new ground. The club secured <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> area of ground by Filbert Street, and moved there in 1891.|$|E
5|$|It {{is largely}} an {{empirical}} procedure, {{and has a}} reasonable safety record {{within the scope of}} its intended application. Advantages are reduced overall decompression time and for some versions, easy estimation of decompression by the use of a simple rule-based procedure which can be done underwater by the diver. It requires the use of specific gas mixtures for given depth ranges. The advantages claimed are flexibility in that if the depth is not known accurately, the schedule can be adjusted during the dive to allow for the actual depth, and that it allows deep dives without <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> expensive trimix dive computer.|$|E

Willow recites {{what he thinks}} is the {{appropriate}} spell, but turns the goat into an ostrich, a peacock, a tortoise, and finally a tiger, before returning her to normal. ILM supervisor Dennis Muren considered using stop motion animation for the scene.

5|$|On December 7, 2016, Microsoft {{announced}} that {{as part of}} a partnership with Qualcomm, it planned to support the PC version of Windows 10 on Qualcomm Snapdragon systems-on-chip in 2017, beginning with a focus on laptops. Unlike Windows RT, these devices will support <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> x86 processor emulator to support Win32 desktop applications, along with universal apps. On May 2, 2017, Microsoft unveiled Windows 10 S, an edition of Windows 10 designed for low-end mobile devices targeting the education market (which have led critics to compare the product line to Chrome OS). Similarly to Windows RT, it restricts software installation to applications obtained via Windows Store, but it may be upgraded to Windows 10 Pro for a fee to remove these restrictions.|$|E
