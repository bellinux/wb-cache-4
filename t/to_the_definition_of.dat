This was an important contribution <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> design as a core element in business. At Philips Design, Stefano Marzano became CEO and Chief Creative Director in 1991, continuing the work of Robert Blaich to align design processes with business processes and furthering design strategy as an important asset of the overall business strategy.|$|E
5|$|Psittacosaurus {{is known}} from {{hundreds}} of individual specimens, of which over 75 have been assigned to the type species, P. mongoliensis. All Psittacosaurus fossils discovered {{so far have been}} found in Early Cretaceous sediments in Asia, from southern Siberia to northern China, and possibly as far south as Thailand. The most common age of geologic formations bearing Psittacosaurus fossils is from the late Barremian through Albian stages of the Early Cretaceous, or approximately 126 to 101mya (million years ago). Many terrestrial sedimentary formations of this age in Mongolia and northern China have produced fossils of Psittacosaurus, leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> this time period in the region as the Psittacosaurus biochron.|$|E
5|$|Two spur routes {{were added}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> Route30 in 1914. One of these, a route {{connecting}} Lockport to Medina, utilized {{what is now}} NY31 from the Lockport city line to NY77 and from Gasport Road in Gasport to Medina (via modern NY31E). On March1, 1921, several routes were altered or eliminated {{as part of a}} partial renumbering of the legislative route system. Among these was Route30, which was modified to follow Ridge Road instead between Ridgeway and Rochester. Its former routing from Medina eastward and the Lockport spur of Route30 mostly became part of an extended Route20, which now began in North Tonawanda and followed modern NY425 and Lower Mountain, Gothic Hill, and Upper Mountain Roads north and east through Cambria Center to Lockport. From Middleport to Medina, however, Route20 was routed on modern NY31 instead. East of Rochester, the section of Route20 between Fairport and Macedon was reconfigured to utilize what is now NY250 and NY31.|$|E

5|$|The Kingdom of This World is {{considered}} to be Alejo Carpentier's first great novel. He is praised for his skillful inclusion of Haitian voodoo, myth, and history in the work, as well as for contributing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> Latin American identity. Although the presence of magic realism in The Kingdom of This World has been acclaimed by critics and discussed at length within the academic community, this concern is paralleled by a lack of interest in Carpentier's technical work in the novel. In particular, his vision of time has been widely ignored. The Kingdom of This World has also been criticized for its narrative organization, which predominantly relies on opposition rather than on succession: the novel does not present history in terms of a sequence of events and their consequences. The gaps within chronological time that occur throughout this novel as well as the sudden changes of perspective and minimal transitional narrative have led some to criticize the book for the chaotic first impression it gives the reader.|$|E
