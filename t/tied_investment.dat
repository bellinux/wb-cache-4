40|$|This {{research}} {{examined the}} effects of social capital on entrepreneurial opportunity perception and weak <b>tie</b> <b>investment</b> using individual-level data from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor linked with national-level data on social capital. Consistent with a social capital perspective, this study found that a resident of a country with higher generalized trust and breadth of formal organizational memberships was more likely to perceive entrepreneurial opportunities. A resident of a country with higher generalized trust was also more likely to invest in an entrepreneur with whom he or she had a weak personal tie than was a resident of a country with lesser generalized trust.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} role of {{entrepreneurs}} in <b>investment</b> <b>tie</b> formation in science-based entrepreneurial firms. Specifically, we address why <b>investment</b> <b>tie</b> formation is path dependent for some firms but more amenable to intentional management for others. Using longitudinal case studies, our evidence suggests that early <b>investment</b> <b>tie</b> formation is path dependent because scientific entrepreneurs typically approach only {{one or a few}} prospective investors from within their institutional context. Differences in experience between early investors affect the professionalization of entrepreneurial teams (or lack thereof), which influences the extent to which subsequent <b>investment</b> <b>tie</b> formation becomes more amenable to intentional management or remains path dependent...|$|R

40|$|Account {{managers}} {{invest in}} two distinct, compensatory social ties to achieve social capital, namely peripheral knowledge ties and implementation support ties. The first <b>ties</b> require communal <b>investments,</b> which consist of organizational citizenship behaviors and peripheral information sharing. The second <b>ties</b> require instrumental <b>investments</b> that encompass reciprocity norms and strategic information sharing. Hypotheses are tested on {{a sample of}} 164 account managers who sell financial products/services to large customers. The findings show that account managers invest in both ties to attain peripheral knowledge accretion and implementation support which in turn result in improved performance. reciprocity;account management;social capital;organizational citizenship behaviors...|$|R

40|$|In economics, {{the human}} capital model (Becker, 1962) <b>ties</b> <b>investments</b> in {{education}} and training to later returns {{in the form of}} higher wages. This model describes the decision-making process of pursuing additional education as weighing the direct costs (e. g., tuition) and indirect costs (e. g., forgone wages) of obtaining a particular level of education against the additional returns in the form of higher wages that this educational level will bring. As long as the present value of the returns is greater than the costs, then the model assumes that a rational individ-ual would pursue more education. This model may explain why females in the past tended to obtain lower levels of college edu-cation relative to males. With fewer years in the labor market due to caregiving needs for children or other family members, women received a lower return on their educational investment and hence invested in less education. Additionally, this model may explain why females tend to congregate in certain occupa-tions, such as clerical work, where there is less loss of the educa-tional investment with more time away from the labor marke...|$|R

40|$|Natural {{resource}} {{industries are}} characterized by vertical relationships involving <b>tied</b> irreversible <b>investment.</b> Unless prevented by external circumstances, {{it is usually the}} case that the owners of extraction and processing capital are also the owners of the basic resource itself. But if the resource is not owned outright, capital owners usually have secure long term contracts over the basic resource supply. But since these contracts are incomplete, in combination with <b>tied</b> irreversible <b>investment</b> this provides a powerful incentive for vertical integration. The paper examines the investment efficiency of vertical integration when the basic resource can yield non-marketed goods with special emphasis on the case of forest land resources. This has implications for the private/public ownership issue because public ownership prevents the investment efficiency gains from vertical integration but is more likely to recognize the value of non-marketed goods from the forest resource when making land allocation decisions. This issue is also examined empirically by comparing investment levels in the Pacific Northwest of the United States where the industry is substantially vertically integrated with the Coastal British Columbia industry in Canada, which relies primarily on public timber supply. Other historical data on the vertical integration of the industries in the two countries is also examined and compared...|$|R

The investment is looked after by a family member in return for some monetary compensation. The model focuses on two different cases: statecontingent transfers (transfers are <b>tied</b> to <b>investment</b> outcomes) and fixed transfers (transfers are mainly of altruistic motive). As the migrant derives utilities from consumption, his consumption-investment decision is driven by preferences and future investment prospects. The transfers are to increase with both business encouraging and income compensatory effects. ...|$|R

The economy is analyzed numerically and specific policy recommendations are provided for individual recipient countries. ...|$|R
