This change in color has been interpreted to reflect bleaching beneath an unconformity that separates red beds of the Nankoweap Formation from dark-gray dolomites of the Galeros Formation.

40|$|International audienceUnderstanding the {{compressive}} behaviour of mortarless joints {{is necessary}} to optimise refractory masonry structures. This study investigates joint closure using Digital Image Correlation, a contactless measuring method. Results show that the gap thickness of the dry joint is mainly due to the nonplanarity of contacting surfaces, the surface roughness playing a secondary role. The process of joint closure involves roughness crushing and the adjustment of surfaces, and is strongly heterogeneous, orthotropic and nonlinear. Local joint opening is observed during {{the first stage of}} the global joint closureprocess. This phenomenon is due to rigid body motion which induces a plane rotation of <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>contacting</b> bricks...|$|R

They assigned the Shurtz Sandstone Tongue (new) and Lamb Point Tongue (new) to the Navajo Sandstone, and Cedar City Tongue (new) and Tenney Canyon Tongue (new) to the Kayenta Formation. In 1957 Harshbarger and others created an overview and revision that assigned the Moenave Formation and divided the Wingate Sandstone into newly the named Rock Point and Lukachukai members.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>upper</b> <b>contact</b> of the Kaibab Limestone (Harrisburg Member) {{with the}} {{overlying}} Moenkopi Formation is an erosional unconformity and disconformity.

These paleovalleys are often filled with conglomerates and breccias that are known as the Rock Canyon conglomerate. Within the Marble Canyon and eastern Grand Canyon regions and south into Verde Valley, upper contact of the Kaibab Limestone with the Moenkopi Formation is an erosional disconformity. This disconformity exhibits little relief and is identified by marked differences in color, topography, and rock types between tan, ledge-forming, calcareous sandstones and of the Kaibab Limestone and red, slope-forming siltstones of the Moenkopi formation.

5000|$|Mercury relays {{consist of}} a {{vertical}} (usually glass) tube containing liquid mercury. They have isolated contacts {{at the bottom of}} the tube and partway up, usually in a side arm of the glass. The relay works by displacement. A pool of mercury fills the lower portion of the tube, but is insufficient to bridge the contacts. A magnetic slug of iron or steel is placed in the tube, where it sinks by gravity so as to displace the mercury. The displaced mercury rises in the tube, sufficiently to bridge the contacts and complete the circuit between them. Around the top part of the tube is placed the coil. When energised, this coil attracts the slug, lifting it upwards and out of the mercury pool. The mercury is no longer displaced, so flows downwards, away from <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>contact</b> and the circuit opens. This allows for normally closed operation. For the more traditional normally open relay operation, the side contact is arranged somewhat higher up (or the volume of mercury is reduced) so that contact is not made when the iron slug is freely floating on the pool of mercury. The control coil is mounted below the rest level of the slug and when energised draws down the slug deeper into the pool displacing additional mercury thus raising the level to the previously uncovered side contact and closing the circuit.|$|E
