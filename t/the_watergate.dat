5|$|As <b>the</b> <b>Watergate</b> saga unfolded, the ACLU {{became the}} first {{national}} organization to call for Nixon's impeachment. This, following the resolution opposing the Vietnam war, was a second major decision that caused critics of the ACLU, particularly conservatives, {{to claim that the}} ACLU had evolved into a liberal political organization.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the episode}} {{primarily}} mocks the Republican Party, the writers included several jokes {{at the expense}} of the Democratic Party, liberal and conservative politics, to try to be as neutral as possible.

5|$|Chris Carter was {{inspired}} to write this episode based on an interest in dendrochronology, a subject that involves analyzing annual growth rings found in non-tropical tree species. Carter credits the episode's ominous ending with his experience {{growing up in the}} era following <b>the</b> <b>Watergate</b> scandal, having spent his life coming to mistrust the government profoundly.|$|E
5|$|Control of Sandwedge {{was passed}} to G.

5|$|After {{graduating from}} Yale Law School, Clinton {{returned}} to Arkansas {{and became a}} law professor at the University of Arkansas. In 1974, he ran for the House of Representatives.

5|$|As a Republican {{representing}} heavily-Democratic Maryland, Mathias faced {{a potentially}} difficult re-election {{bid for the}} 1974 election.

Mathias was renominated by Republicans, fending off a primary election challenge from conservative doctor Ross Pierpont. Pierpont was never a substantial threat to Mathias, whose lack of competition was due in part to fallout from <b>the</b> <b>Watergate</b> scandal.|$|E
