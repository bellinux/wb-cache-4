On a similar list {{compiled}} by Mojo in 2006, the song appeared at number 27. In his commentary for the magazine, Brian Wilson described it as his [...] "all time favourite Beatles track", saying that while the Beatles were [...] "genius songwriters", this song was distinguished by a [...] "heart-and-soul melody". Wilson concluded: [...] "When they broke up I was heartbroken. I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> have kept going." ...|$|E

In 2002, when asked what she hoped to accomplish, she stated, [...] "Awareness of the plight of these people. I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> be commended for what they have survived, not looked down upon." [...] To that end, her 2001–02 field visits were chronicled in her book Notes from My Travels, {{which was published in}} October 2003 in conjunction with the release of her humanitarian drama Beyond Borders.|$|E
500|$|Morehead {{was later}} {{transferred}} to Fort Warren in Boston Harbor. He complained to his captors {{about the conditions}} in the prison; specifically, the difficulty of writing letters when confined with nine other men {{in a room that}} measured just ten feet by twenty feet. Petitions for Morehead's release were delivered to President Lincoln, but Lincoln told Secretary of State Seward that Morehead and those arrested with them would be released [...] "when James Guthrie and James Speed [...] <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> be". Later, Guthrie told Lincoln that Morehead's arrest had [...] "not been beneficial" [...] to their cause in Kentucky. Morehead was paroled on January 6, 1862, on the condition that he swear an oath not {{to take part in the}} Confederate insurgence. On March 19, 1862, he was unconditionally discharged from his parole.|$|E

Cameron announces to Chase that she <b>thinks</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> have non-committal sex, and House and Wilson {{go out to}} breakfast, as House resigns himself to not getting any samples of Hannah's spinal nerve.|$|R
500|$|Barrett, by the {{beginning}} of the recording sessions for A Saucerful of Secrets, was already shrinking into a delirious state of mind, exacerbated by his feelings of alienation from the rest of the band. The common interpretation of the lyrics is that they reflect his schizophrenia and it has been argued that they could also be read as a criticism of the other band members for forcing him out. King said of the song: [...] "The most alienated, extraordinary lyrics. It's not addressed to the band, it's addressed to the whole world. He was completely cut off." [...] Jenner said [...] "I think every psychiatrist should be made to listen to those songs [...] I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> be part of the curriculum of every medical college along with those Van Gogh paintings like The Crows." ...|$|E
500|$|Long an {{advocate}} for gender equality in climbing, Hill has argued {{that men and women}} can climb the same routes: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> have women compete on the same climbs as the men, and if the women can't do the climbs, then they shouldn't be competing". For example, she argued that both sexes compete on the same routes in World Cup competitions. However, Hill later revised her view, noting that while she could and did compete with men [...] "spectators want to see people get to the top. And since most women aren't climbing at the same level as the top men, it's necessary to design a route that's a little easier for women". In answer to a question about whether or not women [...] "will ever equal or surpass men in climbing", Hill gave a detailed response, focused on body composition, size, and psychology, explaining that climbing [...] "favors people with high strength-to-weight ratios", less body fat, and greater height, articulating that such characteristics often favor men but that women [...] "have the advantage of being relatively light, with the capacity for tremendous endurance". She explained that [...] "theoretically somebody as short as me could be {{the best in the world}} because it doesn't depend so much on height now... And it's a psychological thing more than a physical thing." ...|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} of Quagmire's wedding, Lois' breasts have gotten very large after {{deciding}} to wean Stewie, {{on the advice of}} Brian. While at the reception, the top of her shirt rips open. Peter notices that Quagmire is staring at Lois' huge breasts, and deliberately spills champagne on them. Peter then [...] "helps" [...] Lois by shaking her, which makes her large breasts jiggle. This arouses Quagmire, and he realizes that he has made a mistake by marrying Joan. He informs Joan that some of his friends <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> get an annulment after discussing it with Peter, Joe and Cleveland, but she threatens to cut herself and him if he annuls their marriage. As a result, Peter decides to help Quagmire fake his death. He shows Joan a video of Quagmire being attacked by a ninja (Joe), a Nazi (Cleveland), a [...] "pots and pans" [...] robot (Peter), and the body being consumed by a dinosaur held by Peter (to the theme of Jurassic Park). Joan is unconvinced by the video. Peter and his friends then operate plan B, which consists of Quagmire pretending to suffer a heart attack and die. Quagmire is buried in a coffin with enough oxygen to last him {{a short period of time}} so Peter can return after the funeral has finished and dig him up. However, when Mayor West announces that all coffins must be buried in concrete (to guard against zombies), Peter exclaims that Quagmire is not dead, and brings him out of the coffin, alive. Death shows up to retrieve his body. Joan pleads for Quagmire's life, and touches Death's arm, which kills her instantly. Death takes Joan instead, as [...] "she was suicidal and her last name was Quagmire." [...] However, before he leaves, Quagmire asks Death to leave the body for another five minutes, thus turning him back into his old usual self.|$|E

50|$|In an interview, Gregory {{identified}} prisons as {{an important}} political issue that libertarians at large have tended not to care {{about as much as}} he <b>thinks</b> <b>they</b> <b>should.</b> Gregory's chief criticisms include the imprisonment of non-violent drug offenders, the imprisonment of innocent people due to low evidentiary standards, and the use of methods of imprisonment that are tantamount to torture.|$|R

Leonard replies that he has and still <b>thinks</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> go ahead with it. Penny therefore agrees and then smiles.|$|R

[...] The state parole board {{received}} approximately 20 letters, the majority of which expressed their sympathy and support for Biechele, some going as far as to describe him as a [...] "scapegoat" [...] with limited responsibility.|$|E
2500|$|The other {{threat to}} the {{security}} of our tradition, I believe, lies at home. It is the current fear of radical ideas and of people who propound them. I do not agree with the extremists of either the left or the right, but I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> be allowed to speak and to publish, both because they themselves have, and ought to have, rights, and once their rights are gone, the rights {{of the rest of us}} are hardly safe … ...|$|E

He argues that the [...] "order and regularity" [...] of bureaucracy is more harmful than valuable, and elaborates that rules do not apply equally in practice and are more [...] "instruments through which the human imagination is smashed and shattered".|$|R

2500|$|Sam, who [...] "just turned forty", is {{in therapy}} with Dr. Sergius whose {{presence}} is heard throughout {{the story as}} a judgmental voice in Sam's head. Sam speaks {{in the language of}} psychoanalysis to his wife and friends, usually saying the direct opposite of what he is feeling. His wife and friends are equally pretentious and miserable, and the impression throughout the novella is that they do and say what they <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> rather than what they want to do, making them full of regrets, bitterness, and self-loathing. Finally, Sam is a radical [...] "out of habit, but without enthusiasm and without a cause" [...] for the Communist Party; he and Marvin [...] "are wary of politics today" [...] and only discuss what should be done, rather than participating in the process.|$|E

2500|$|The fourteenth {{series of}} Big Brother {{introduced}} several {{changes to the}} format. One of the changes implemented in the fourteenth series was the return of [...] "Vote to Evict". This way of voting had not been used since Ultimate Big Brother. Another change was Big Brother sometimes revealing the number of nominations each nominee received to the housemates, and it also saw the three or more housemates with the most nominations facing the public vote each week, with the nominated housemate who had the fewest votes to evict after lines had been frozen usually being saved during a live segment in the Wednesday highlights show. Voting lines then reopened. During the live eviction show, for the first time, nominated housemates were given thirty seconds to broadcast a 'plea' explaining why they <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> stay in the house.|$|E
