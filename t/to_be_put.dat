5|$|Construction of the {{new power}} station started in 1930, but the Second World War delayed its full {{completion}} until 1951.

The first units were commissioned in January 1933.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the failure}} to gain even local air superiority in the Battle of Britain, Operation Sea Lion was {{postponed}} indefinitely.

5|$|A racehorse {{was named}} after the paper in 1991, which was owned by a {{consortium}} of 250Echo readers. The gelding won races at Hamilton, Redcar, Newcastle upon Tyne and Haydock in the early 1990s, but had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>put</b> down on 17 February 1996 after pulling up badly lame during a routine morning gallop. The Echo was also used in a display at the Science Museum in London in 1999, to show how writing can be made simpler for people with reading difficulties, and a specially printed edition of the newspaper appeared on the TV show Touching Evil, starring Robson Green, in the same year.|$|E

5|$|Adams was {{concerned}} about the new Constitution and made an attempt to re-enter national politics. He allowed his name <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>put</b> forth as a candidate for the United States House of Representatives in the December 1788 election, but lost to Fisher Ames, apparently because Ames was a stronger supporter of the Constitution, a more popular position. Despite his defeat, Adams continued to work for amendments to the Constitution, a movement that ultimately resulted in the addition of a Bill of Rights in 1791. Adams subsequently became a firm supporter of the Constitution, with these amendments and the possibility of more.|$|E
5|$|After {{winning the}} December elections, the Fraser {{government}} took {{the approach that}} trade with Southeast Asia and political ties with Southeast Asia were too important <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>put</b> at risk for what {{was seen as a}} lost cause. Australia abstained from the 1976 and 1977 UN General Assembly Resolutions, and by 1978 became the only government to officially recognise East Timor as a province of Indonesia.|$|E
5|$|Blaine had {{considered}} {{running for the}} United States House of Representatives from Maine’s 4th district in 1860, but agreed to step aside when Anson P.

Morrill was successful, but after redistricting placed Blaine in the 3rd district for the 1862 elections, he allowed his name <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>put</b> forward. Running on a campaign of staunch support for the war effort, Blaine was elected with an ample majority despite Republican losses across the rest of the country.|$|E

5|$|Breathitt enraged Chandler by {{charging}} that, when Chandler was a senator, he had {{voted in favor}} of declaring World War II, but soon after resigned his commission as a reserve army captain. According to Chandler's version of events, after he {{voted in favor of}} the war declaration, he called Secretary of War Henry Stimson and asked <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>put</b> on active duty. Chandler said Stimson told him he would rather have a senator than a captain, after which Chandler resigned his commission. Chandler's explanation did not stop Breathitt from repeating the charge often on the campaign trail.|$|E

He died on 13 May 2001, in Chennai at the age of 94.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to their appearance in the film, Green Day recorded {{its own version of}} the Simpsons theme, and released it as a single. Zimmer turned the Spider-Pig song into a choral piece, which was a joke he never intended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>put</b> into the film. Zimmer also had to write foreign-language lyrics for the 32 dubbed versions of the song when the film was released internationally. He found translating the song into Spanish the hardest to write. The same choir learned to sing the piece for each of the foreign-language dubs.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} said that an error of fact {{involves}} a situation where there are new or different primary facts yet <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>put</b> before the court, such as a new witness, or what people saw or heard, whereas an error of law involves a misinterpretation of a statutory word or phrase with regard to such facts. However, this distinction is debatable, and the view has been taken that courts sometimes simply regard a matter as one involving an error of law if they wish to adopt an interventionist approach, and seek to allow judicial review to take place.|$|E
