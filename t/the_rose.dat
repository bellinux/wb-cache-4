5|$|Aigler {{also played}} an {{important}} role in securing the Big Ten's long-term contract with <b>the</b> <b>Rose</b> Bowl. Prior to the 1947 season, the visiting spot in <b>the</b> <b>Rose</b> Bowl was open to all conferences, and the Big Ten champion only appeared in <b>the</b> <b>Rose</b> Bowl on rare occasions. In November 1946, Aigler was appointed to a five-person steering committee assigned to negotiate an exclusive contract with <b>the</b> <b>Rose</b> Bowl. The Big Ten approved the exclusive arrangement by a vote of 7 to 2, with Illinois and Minnesota the only opponents. The relationship was negotiated at meetings between Aigler and the Big Ten steering committee and the Pacific Coast Conference held in Berkeley, California in November 1946. Aigler traveled to California again in May 1947 with William Reed to negotiate administrative details of <b>the</b> <b>Rose</b> Bowl arrangement with Pacific Coast Conference representative William C. Ackerman. The University of Michigan was the first Big Ten participant in the new Rose Bowl arrangement, defeating the USC Trojans 490 in the game held on January 1, 1948.|$|E
