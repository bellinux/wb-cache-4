5|$|At {{a hearing}} on May 22, 1990, Judge Brett {{announced}} his refusal to reconsider the seven dismissed claims, ending the lawsuit, and ruled all remaining pending motions moot. At the hearing, Brett said that the issue {{at the heart of}} the suit was the highway's effect on area residents. While this was a legitimate interest, <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> <b>said,</b> it was not covered by the environmental laws under which the plaintiffs chose to challenge the project. Brett also pointed out that the environmental questions were at that time under review by the appropriate federal agencies.|$|E
5|$|Dietrich's other {{argument}} {{was that the}} trial judge should have used discretionary powers and granted an adjournment until Dietrich was able to provide counsel himself, and that the {{failure to do so}} caused a miscarriage of justice. Dietrich had asked the trial judge for an adjournment during the trial, but <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> <b>said</b> that since more than a year had passed since the offence occurred, it was {{in the interests of the}} community that the matter be dealt with promptly.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>judge</b> <b>said</b> {{there were}} three crucial points, in no {{particular}} order. Did the jury believe Julie Mugford or Jeremy Bamber? Were they sure that Sheila was not the killer who then committed suicide? He said this question involved another: was the second, fatal, shot fired at Sheila with the silencer on? If yes, {{she could not have}} fired it. Finally, did Nevill call Bamber {{in the middle of the}} night? If there was no such call, it undermined the entirety of Bamber's story; the only reason he would have had to invent the phone call was that he was responsible for the murders.|$|E

5|$|Seattle filed {{a lawsuit}} on September 23, 2007 {{in an attempt to}} keep the Sonics from leaving before the end of their lease in 2010. The trial was set for June 16, 2008. On April 10, 2008, Seattle asked the Federal District Court to order the NBA to release {{documents}} related to the financial situation of each team, the claim that the SuperSonics' lease with KeyArena was financially unworkable, and the league's involvement in requiring PBC to make a good-faith effort to stay in Seattle. On April 28, the trial's presiding judge, Loretta Preska, ruled that the NBA must supply the internal documents about the possible relocation of the Sonics that the city of Seattle had requested. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> <b>said</b> that Stern could be deposed at a later day should the need arise. The city hoped the documents would aid in building its legal case, and cited an email conversation among members of the ownership group that suggested they were privately discussing intent to move the team while publicly insisting that they would not attempt to do so.|$|E

25|$|On May 21, 2012, Judge Glenn Berman sentenced Ravi to 30 days in jail, 3 years probation, 300 {{hours of}} {{community}} service, a $10,000 fine, and counseling on cyberbullying and alternate lifestyles. “It wasn’t my deal,” <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> <b>said.</b> “It was the state’s.” Lead prosecutor Julia McClure had sought a five-year prison term and on May 23, 2012 filed a motion appealing the sentence.|$|E
25|$|It transpired that Gough {{had been}} convicted of common assault against his wife in 1942 and she had left him in July of that year, {{applying}} for a separation order on the grounds of persistent cruelty on 6 August 1942, but had later returned to live with him. <b>The</b> <b>judge</b> <b>said</b> that he took this into account before sentencing her, but her own ill-treatment was no excuse for her neglect of the boys.|$|E

25|$|On September 16, 2004, Justice Douglas Yard of the Manitoba Court of Queen's Bench {{declared}} the then-current definition of marriage unconstitutional. <b>The</b> <b>judge</b> <b>said</b> that his {{decision had been}} influenced by the previous decisions in B.C., Ontario and Quebec. This decision followed suits brought by three couples in Manitoba requesting that they be issued marriage licences. Both the provincial and federal governments had made it known that they would not oppose the court bid. One of the couples, Chris Vogel and Richard North, had legally sought marriage in a high-profile case in 1974 but had been denied.|$|E
25|$|Arizona Court of Appeals Judge Philip Espinosa sued Manilow {{over the}} volume of a December 23, 1993, concert he {{attended}} with his wife. <b>The</b> <b>judge</b> <b>said</b> in a lawsuit {{he has had a}} constant ringing in his ears and nearly blew his ears out. Espinosa sought unspecified damages, and the trial was set for September 23, 1997. The suit also named Manilow's production company, an Arizona concert promoter and the city of Tucson, Arizona, which runs the convention center where the concert was held. In July 1997, to settle the suit it was reported that Manilow donated $5,000 to American Tinnitus Association, an ear-disorder association.|$|E
25|$|The {{prosecution}} {{also moved}} to introduce into evidence a recorded conversation between Constand's mother Gianna Constand and Cosby discussing the alleged assault. The defense moved {{to have the}} deposition from Andrea Constand's 2005 civil deposition thrown out. <b>The</b> <b>judge</b> <b>said</b> he would rule on all these motions at a later date. On September 16, 2016, O'Neill ruled that the recorded call between Constand's mother and Cosby {{would be allowed to}} be played in court. In his ruling he said that since the call was recorded in Canada, which deems recordings lawful with consent from only one party, it would be admissible. On December 5, 2016, O'Neill ruled that the deposition in the Constand civil case and any other evidence gathered by using it, would be allowed into the trial.|$|E

25|$|Fabrizio ruled for {{the state}} that News 12 had {{to turn over the}} complete, {{unedited}} interview. While News 12 had argued that the state had failed to demonstrate any basis for supposing that Bonie had confessed to the crime off camera, <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> <b>said</b> that the prosecution sought to learn whether he had made admissions relevant to the case. Raimundi's narration described Bonie making positive statements about his relationship with Moore. Even the defense agreed the issue of the Section 8 applications was a central and relevant one in the case. The judge did not find that Bonie had been promised confidentiality by News 12, and there was no possible other way {{for the state}} to find out what he might have said that was not broadcast. The judge's one concession to News 12 was that he would review the recorded interview in camera and release to the prosecution only those sections that discussed Bonie and Moore's landlord-tenant relationship and/or the Section 8 issue.|$|E
25|$|Under Bradlee's leadership, The Washington Post took {{on major}} {{challenges}} during the Nixon administration. In 1971 The New York Times and the Post successfully challenged the government {{over the right}} to publish the Pentagon Papers. One year later, Bradlee backed reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein as they probed the break-in at the Democratic National Committee Headquarters in the Watergate Hotel. According to Bradlee: You {{had a lot of}} Cuban or Spanish-speaking guys in masks and rubber gloves, with walkie-talkies, arrested in the Democratic National Committee Headquarters at 2 in the morning. What the hell were they in there for? What were they doing? The follow-up story was based primarily on their arraignment in court, and it was based on information given our police reporter, Al Lewis, by the cops, showing them an address book that one of the burglars had in his pocket, and in the address book was the name 'Hunt,' H-u-n-t, and the phone number was the White House phone number, which Al Lewis and every reporter worth his salt knew. And when, the next day, Woodward—this is probably Sunday or maybe Monday, because the burglary was Saturday morning early—called the number and asked to speak to Mr. Hunt, and the operator said, 'Well, he's not here now; he's over at' such-and-such a place, gave him another number, and Woodward called him up, and Hunt answered the phone, and Woodward said, 'We want to know why your name was in the address book of the Watergate burglars.' And there is this long, deathly hush, and Hunt said, 'Oh my God!' and hung up. So you had the White House. You have Hunt saying 'Oh my God!' At a later arraignment, one of the guys whispered to a judge. <b>The</b> <b>judge</b> <b>said,</b> 'What do you do?' and Woodward overheard the words 'CIA.' So if your interest isn't whetted by this time, you're not a journalist.Ensuing investigations of suspected cover-ups led inexorably to congressional committees, conflicting testimonies, and ultimately to the resignation of Richard Nixon in 1974. For decades, Bradlee was one of only four publicly known people who knew the true identity of press informant Deep Throat, the other three being Woodward, Bernstein, and Deep Throat himself, who later revealed himself to be Nixon's FBI associate director Mark Felt.|$|E

5000|$|At the {{conclusion}} of <b>the</b> round, <b>the</b> <b>judges</b> placed 4 contestants (Kaushik, Malavika, Krishna & Shakthi) into the danger zone. <b>The</b> <b>judges</b> <b>said</b> that Krishna (together with Saicharan and Sathyaprakash) {{was one of the}} most technically sound singers left in the competition, [...] "but the soul in the singing of film songs" [...] is something Krishna still needs to understand. <b>The</b> <b>judges</b> also <b>said</b> that Kaushik and Krishna lacked confidence in their singing. In <b>the</b> end, <b>the</b> <b>judges</b> eliminated Krishna.|$|R

500|$|<b>The</b> <b>judge</b> <b>said</b> that Kasztner's {{failure to}} do more to warn the {{community}} that they were being sent to the gas chambers, not resettled, had helped Eichmann maintain order, and that the Kasztner train had been a payoff. Tom Segev called the ruling [...] "one of the most heartless in the history of Israel, perhaps the most heartless ever". The Supreme Court of Israel overturned most of the verdict in January 1958, ruling that the lower court had [...] "erred seriously", but Kasztner was assassinated in 1957 {{as a result of the}} earlier judgment.|$|E
500|$|On 16 June 2008, British {{newspaper}} The Sun {{reported the}} presence of an in-game Internet resource titled Little Lacy Surprise Pageant — a reference to the fake commercials featured in [...] (2006).

In November 2008, 19-year-old Ryan Chinnery was jailed for performing two sex attacks on women at night.
