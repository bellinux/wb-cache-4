5|$|Shortly afterwards, 14 Devastators from Torpedo Squadron 6 (VT-6) from Enterprise, led by Lieutenant Commander Eugene E. Lindsey, attacked. Lindsey's {{aircraft}} {{tried to}} sandwich Kaga, but the CAP, reinforced by 4 additional Zeros launched by Hiryū at 09:37, shot down all but 4 of the Devastators, and Kaga dodged the torpedoes. Hiryū launched another trio of CAP Zeros at 10:13 after Torpedo Squadron 3 (VT-3) from Yorktown was spotted. Two of her Zeros {{were shot down}} by Wildcats escorting VT-3 and another was forced <b>to</b> <b>ditch.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Vought OS2U Kingfisher was {{a lightly}} armed two-man {{aircraft}} designed in 1937. The Kingfisher's high operating ceiling of 13,000 feet (nearly four kilometers) made it well-suited for its primary mission: {{to observe the}} fall of shot from a battleship's guns and radio corrections back to the ship. The floatplanes used in World War II also performed search and rescue for naval aviators who were shot down or forced <b>to</b> <b>ditch</b> in the ocean.|$|E
5|$|At dusk, the Japanese {{turned away}} to the {{northwest}} to regroup and to refuel and the Americans turned west to close the distance. They discovered the retiring Japanese fleet during {{the afternoon of the}} following day and Vice Admiral Marc Mitscher ordered an air strike launched. They found the ships of the Second Carrier Division and hit Jun'yō with two bombs near her island. The ship was not badly damaged, but flight operations had to be suspended. Air Group 652 claimed seven American aircraft shot down and four more probably shot down, but lost eleven Zeros, plus another three that had <b>to</b> <b>ditch.</b> The air group was disbanded on 10 July with many of its remaining personnel being assigned to Air Group 653.|$|E
5|$|Don instructs the Jaguar team <b>to</b> <b>ditch</b> the {{mistress}} concept {{because it is}} vulgar. Later, Harry praises Peggy's work on Chevalier Blanc. She tells Don the client ultimately went with the same ad as before, only in a Paris setting. Don says Ginsberg will take over once the Jaguar pitch is finished, prompting Peggy to reply {{that she is not}} in charge of everything. Don pulls some money from his wallet and condescendingly tosses it in Peggy's face, telling her that if she wants to go to Paris, she should just go. Ken tries to comfort her, saying that Don is just upset about Jaguar, to which she replies that she does not care.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the pilots}} flashed {{the seat belt}} signs just prior <b>to</b> <b>ditching,</b> the {{understanding}} in the cabin was insufficient that the aircraft was about to touch down. Consequently, {{an unknown number of}} passengers and crew were either standing up, or had their seat belts unfastened when the aircraft struck the water.|$|R
50|$|City Creek was channeled {{along its}} western fork, and canals were dug {{on either side}} of every street of Salt Lake City. Water was {{delivered}} by opening gates to street canals.

5000|$|Anti-tank trenches, {{also called}} {{anti-tank}} ditches, are ditches dug into and around fortified positions {{to hold up}} the advance of enemy tanks. Anti-tank ditches were first used in World War I by Germany in an effort to protect their trenches against the newly developed British tanks. An anti-tank <b>ditch</b> has <b>to</b> be wide enough and deep enough to prevent a tank from crossing. Armies have been known <b>to</b> disguise anti-tank <b>ditches</b> <b>to</b> enable the <b>ditch</b> <b>to</b> disable an enemy tank.|$|R
5|$|Junyō {{was hit by}} two bombs {{near her}} island. The ship was not badly damaged, but the damage did stop flight operations. Air Group 652 claimed 2 Grumman F6F Hellcat fighters and 9 Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo bombers shot down, but lost 11 aircraft, plus another 3 that had <b>to</b> <b>ditch.</b> By {{the end of the}} battle, the air group only {{consisted}} of 11 A6M5s, 5 A6M2s and 1 B6N and it was disbanded on 10 July.

5|$|Nagumo {{was now in}} a quandary. Rear Admiral Tamon Yamaguchi, leading Carrier Division 2 (Hiryū and Sōryū), {{recommended}} that Nagumo strike immediately with the forces at hand: 18 Aichi D3A1 dive bombers each on Sōryū and Hiryū, and half the ready cover patrol aircraft. Nagumo's opportunity to hit the American ships was now limited by the imminent return of his Midway strike force. The returning strike force needed to land promptly or it would have <b>to</b> <b>ditch</b> into the sea. Because of the constant flight deck activity associated with combat air patrol operations during the preceding hour, the Japanese never {{had an opportunity to}} position ("spot") their reserve planes on the flight deck for launch.|$|E

5|$|Smith {{reported}} in his autobiography, during one run from Omaha to Cheyenne, {{that he had}} had <b>to</b> <b>ditch</b> into a pasture, landing on a cow. He sent a laconic telegram to his division supervisor at headquarters in College Park, Maryland, reporting the mishap. Crashes were part of the job. Engines were unreliable, and pilots were using road maps. Unpredictable, bad weather was a constant risk. In {{the first five years of}} US Post Office air mail service the average forced landing was every 800 miles and a pilot was killed about every 80,000 miles. Thirty-five pilots died during the Postal Service's operation of air mail flights; most deaths were between 1920 and 1925.|$|E
5|$|The few {{aircraft}} on the Japanese flight decks at {{the time}} of the attack were either defensive fighters or, in the case of Sōryū, fighters being spotted to augment the Combat Air Patrol. Spotting his flight decks and launching aircraft would have required at least 30 minutes. Furthermore, by spotting and launching immediately, Nagumo would be committing some of his reserve to battle without proper anti-ship armament; he had just witnessed how easily unescorted American bombers had been shot down. Poor discipline caused many of the Japanese bombers <b>to</b> <b>ditch</b> their bombs and attempt to dogfight intercepting F4Fs.|$|E
5|$|William Ellis (Bill) Newton, VC (8June 1919– 29March 1943) was an Australian {{recipient}} of the Victoria Cross, the highest decoration for gallantry {{in the face of}} the enemy that can be awarded to a member of the British and Commonwealth armed forces. He was honoured for his actions as a bomber pilot in Papua New Guinea during March 1943 when, despite intense anti-aircraft fire, he pressed home a series of attacks on the Salamaua Isthmus, the last of which saw him forced <b>to</b> <b>ditch</b> his aircraft in the sea. Newton was still officially posted as missing when the award was made in October 1943. It later emerged that he had been taken captive by the Japanese, and executed by beheading on 29March.|$|E
50|$|Dunes Creek {{suffers from}} E. coli {{contamination}} likely related <b>to</b> <b>ditching</b> and draining of wetlands rather than anthropogenic point sources.

50|$|The Turkish {{military}} dropped leaflets on al-Bab on 12 December, urging {{civilians to}} seek shelter as the rebels advanced.

5|$|Fuel was pumped {{from the}} port storage tanks to the {{starboard}} side to correct the list and Lexington began recovering damaged aircraft and those that were low on fuel at 11:39. The Japanese had shot down three of Lexingtons Wildcats and five Dauntlesses, plus another Dauntless crashed on landing. At 12:43, the ship launched five Wildcats to replace the CAP and prepared to launch another nine Dauntlesses. A massive explosion at 12:47 was triggered by sparks that ignited gasoline vapors from the cracked port avgas tanks. The explosion killed 25 crewmen and knocked out the main damage control station. The damage did not interfere with flight deck operations, although the refueling system was shut down. The fueled Dauntlesses were launched and six Wildcats that were low on fuel landed aboard. Aircraft from the morning's air strike began landing at 13:22 and all surviving aircraft had landed by 14:14. The final tally was three Wildcats shot down, plus one Wildcat, three Dauntlesses and one Devastator that were forced <b>to</b> <b>ditch.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Garuda Indonesia Flight 421 had <b>to</b> <b>ditch</b> {{in a river}} {{because of}} hail-induced engine flameouts, killing a flight {{attendant}} and injuring dozens of passengers. Prior to this accident, there were several other incidents of single or dual flameouts due to these weather conditions. After three incidents through 1998, CFMI made modifications to the engine to improve {{the way in which}} the engine handled hail ingestion. The major changes included a modification to the fan/booster splitter (making it more difficult for hail to be ingested by the core of the engine) and the use of an elliptical, rather than conical, spinner at the intake. These changes did not prevent the 2002 accident, and the investigation board found that the pilots did not follow the proper procedures for attempting to restart the engine, which contributed to the final result. Recommendations were made to better educate pilots on how to handle these conditions, as well as to revisit FAA rain and hail testing procedures. No further engine modifications were recommended.|$|E

50|$|Flooding {{can be a}} {{major cause}} of {{recurring}} crop loss—particularly in heavy soils—and can severely disrupt urban economies as well. Subsurface drainage <b>to</b> <b>ditches</b> offers a way to remove excess water from agricultural fields, or vital urban spaces, without the erosion rates and pollution transport that results from direct surface runoff. However, excess drainage results in recurring drought induced crop yield losses and more severe urban heat or desiccation issues.|$|R
5|$|Pegasus was {{converted}} to the prototype fighter catapult ship in November 1940, carrying three Fairey Fulmar fighters from 807 Squadron between 1 December and 10 February 1941, which {{were replaced by}} aircraft from 804 Squadron between 10 February and 23 July. These fighters were supposed to defend convoys against attacks from Focke-Wulf Fw 200 maritime patrol bombers and {{to prevent them from}} radioing location reports to U-boats. If out of range of land, the fighters would have <b>to</b> <b>ditch</b> at sea and hope to be recovered by a ship from their convoy. The ship escorted nine convoys between December 1940 and July 1941. At some point during the war, the ship's anti-aircraft armament was supplemented with a pair of Oerlikon 20mm light anti-aircraft guns mounted in the bow, the ship's bridge was enlarged and the mast was replaced with a tripod mast bearing a Type 291 air warning radar. The ship then became a seaplane training ship again, hosting 763 Squadron aboard from 20 April 1942 to 13 February 1944. Pegasus then became a barracks ship until May 1946 and was then listed for disposal in June.|$|E
5|$|The ship {{departed}} on 1 September to refuel, but did {{not return}} to the Shanghai area. Accompanied by Ryūjō, she sailed to the South China coast and began operations against Chinese forces near Canton on 21 September. On that day, Hōshō contributed six fighters to escort bombers attacking airfields at Tienho and Paiyun. They claimed six enemy aircraft shot down, but the range proved to be too long. Five of the fighters ran out of fuel and had <b>to</b> <b>ditch</b> in the sea, although the aircrews were rescued. Hōshō and Ryūjō bombers continued with almost daily attack missions until the end of September. Hōshō and Ryūjō returned to the Shanghai area on 3 October and Hōshō's aircraft were temporarily transferred to Kunda airfield to support ground operations. On 17 October, Hōshō transferred all of her aircraft to Ryūjō and returned to Japan.|$|E
5|$|When the Japanese {{attacked}} Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, Saratoga {{was entering}} San Diego Harbor to embark her air group, {{which had been}} training ashore while the ship was refitting. This consisted of 11 Grumman F4F-3 Wildcat fighters of VF-3 ({{under the command of}} Lieutenant Jimmy Thach), 43 Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bombers of VB-3 and VS-3, and 11 Douglas TBD Devastator torpedo bombers of VT-3. The ship also was under orders to load 14 Marine Corps Brewster F2A-3 Buffalo fighters of VMF-221 for delivery in Oahu. The following morning the ship, now the flagship of Carrier Division One, commanded by Rear Admiral Aubrey Fitch, sailed for Pearl Harbor. Saratoga arrived at Pearl on 15 December, refueled, and departed for Wake Island the following day. The ship was assigned to Task Force (TF) 14 under the command of Rear Admiral Frank Jack Fletcher; VF-3 had been reinforced by two additional Wildcats picked up in Hawaii, but one SBD had been forced <b>to</b> <b>ditch</b> on 11 December.|$|E
