5|$|Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace is {{the sixth}} studio album by rock band Foo Fighters, {{released}} on September 25, 2007 by RCA Records. The album is noted for {{a blend of}} regular rock and acoustic tracks with shifting dynamics, which emerged from the variety of styles employed on the demos the band produced. It also marks the second time the band worked with producer Gil Norton, whom frontman Dave Grohl brought to fully explore the potential of his compositions and have a record that sounded different from their previous work. Grohl <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> songs with messages that resonated on the audience, writing reflective lyrics which drew inspiration from {{the birth of his}} daughter.|$|E
5|$|The couple put {{extra effort}} into {{avoiding}} {{the issues that}} had caused strife before their separation: Despite being an indifferent cook and housekeeper, Green <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> cooking and keeping the new house cleaner, while Farrar vowed to curtail his work hours {{so that he could}} spend more time with the family. The improvements lasted mere months, however, {{and by the end of}} 1994, both Green and Farrar had fallen back to their old habits and the marriage was again floundering. Fearful of another confrontation with Green, and looking forward to a trip to Peru the family had planned for June 1995, Farrar nevertheless decided to wait until after the trip to raise the issue of a divorce again.|$|E
500|$|The lyrics try to {{illustrate}} Bond's psyche in Casino Royale, described by Cornell as a conflicted and tough spy with more emotional depth, not the [...] "superconfident, seemingly invincible, winking kinda ladies' man superspy" [...] {{of the previous}} incarnations. Cornell <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> the existential dilemmas and possible sacrifices of secret agents - [...] "There's an isolation in that; the stakes are very high. I've {{done a lot of}} living in my 42 years, and it wasn't hard for me to relate to that." [...] The song also served as an introduction to the character, even though he was featured in many other movies before - hence the title [...] "You Know My Name" [...] - dealing with Bond's action such as his first assassination, [...] "introducing himself to what may be {{the rest of his life}} and how he will live it and what it will mean." ...|$|E

500|$|The lyrics on {{the rock}} album <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> [...] "general themes that {{everyone}} can get their hands on", while the acoustic had introspective lyrics that are [...] "vulnerable and revealing", with things Grohl [...] "wouldn't say out loud, wouldn't even admit to myself." [...] Grohl declared that [...] "when you're writing songs that {{have a sort of}} anthemic quality, you can't really go lighthearted and sing about bullshit. You have to dig into a deeper place to find the words", and that [...] "I don't know what it is about, this album, that makes it sound more heartfelt or deeper or more emotional, but when I listen to it, it really is." [...] These include [...] "Friend of a Friend", a song which Grohl wrote in the 1990s about himself and his former Nirvana bandmate Kurt Cobain during the time they shared an apartment together in 1990, and [...] "Still", talking about a suicide Grohl saw when he was ten in Virginia, by a boy who jumped on the train tracks. Much of the album's theme and content, including the title, came after Grohl spent time on the campaign trail with John Kerry during the 2004 presidential election. [...] "We'd pull in to small towns, and thousands of people would come to be rescued by this man", said Grohl. [...] "It's not a political record, but what I saw inspired me." ...|$|E
500|$|With Black Ice, Brendan O'Brien {{tried to}} {{recapture}} the rock sound of AC/DC's early work on albums such as Highway to Hell and Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap. He thought the two previous studio albums, Ballbreaker and Stiff Upper Lip, were blues-influenced. O'Brien <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> the choruses, which he felt were {{the best part of}} the AC/DC songs, and encouraged the band to emphasise the [...] "hooky, melodic side" [...] of its song-writing, which Angus complimented, since he had [...] "never been great with harmonies". Mike Fraser said the band aimed [...] "towards The Razors Edge era, a little bit more up-tempo stuff." [...] O'Brien made suggestions about the band's performance, got Angus to play slide guitar on [...] "Stormy May Day", and told Johnson to swap some screaming for [...] "soul crooning" [...] as Johnson was a soul singer. Johnson was worried that the rest of the band would think this did not suit the band's style of hard rock and roll, but the band was quite receptive. Because of the highly demanding singing style, Johnson only recorded his vocals for one hour a day. The rhythm section continues the basic structure from other AC/DC records; Cliff Williams played bass lines of eighth notes, and Phil Rudd's drumming was a consistent 4/4 time, mostly on his snare, kick drum and hi-hat cymbal. Both musicians expressed contentment with their roles in the band; Rudd said, [...] "I'm not repressing skills. Most drummers are scared to try this", and Williams admitted he plays [...] "the same thing in every song, for the most part", but added [...] "n AC/DC's music, the song is more important than any individual's bit in it".|$|E

2500|$|In 1989, Unger curated a {{show called}} “In a Dark Vein,” at the Sculpture Center in New York. It {{featured}} work by women who used the human figure to shape feelings of fear, loss, and pain and was inspired by Unger's own struggle with cancer. [...] In this show, she <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> a more naked and physical reality {{and the search for}} experience that is shared and elemental. [...] Unger included her bonded iron sculpture, Guardian, which both expresses and mediates suffering. [...] It shows a nude woman, cut off at the waist, with her hands on her hips. [...] The sculpture's mouth is like a pit facing the sky and her arms are like wings. [...] The earthly figure suggests a fertility goddess insisting on her ability to reproduce and crying to get out of her skin. “In a Dark Vein” was filled with representations of the female body shaped by a woman’s hand.|$|E
2500|$|When Denzel Washington {{took the}} role of Malcolm X in the play, When the Chickens Come Home to Roost, which dealt with the {{relationship}} between Malcolm X and Elijah Muhammad, he admitted he knew little about Malcolm X and had not yet read The Autobiography of Malcolm X. [...] Washington prepared by reading books and articles by and about Malcolm X and went over hours of tape and film footage of speeches. [...] The play opened in 1981 and earned Washington a warm review by Frank Rich, {{who was at the}} time the chief theater critic of The New York Times. Upon being cast in the film, he interviewed people who knew Malcolm X, among them Betty Shabazz and two of his brothers. Although they had different upbringings, Washington <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> what he had in common with his character: Washington was close to Malcolm X's age when he was assassinated, both men were from large families, both of their fathers were ministers, and both were raised primarily by their mothers.|$|E

2500|$|For {{the soundtrack}} to Ring of Fates, Tanioka <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> [...] "creating a new {{landscape}} containing the same atmosphere". She returned to using instruments in an [...] "ethnic manner" [...] again in composing the soundtrack for Echoes of Time. The piano {{performances in the}} Ring of Fates soundtrack were done by Kumi Tanioka. She did the performances herself rather than use an outside performer as most Final Fantasy soundtracks have done primarily because she [...] "likes to play piano", and they were done without any sheet music, as she preferred instead to improvise. She took extensive piano lessons as a child, and lists piano and choral music as the biggest influences on her musical style. She also claims to {{have been influenced by}} music {{from a wide variety of}} cultures, like Indonesian, Irish and Balinese music. Tanioka has performed live at several events, including 2011's Final Fantasy XI-themed VanaCon; she likes to do live performances as she feels it connects her with the listener's response to her music, unlike when composing where she can only imagine audience's responses to hearing her music.|$|E
2500|$|Ambient {{musician}} and English record producer Brian Eno produced the album. Coldplay moved to [...] "The Bakery", after finishing up their Latin American Tour, building a studio there. The songs written during their {{time at the}} studio are lyrically [...] "much more abstract, much more visual than before", and musically [...] "less straight-forward, more oblique". Additionally, Martin {{wanted to make a}} vocal transition from his trademark falsetto to a lower register. This is explored in [...] "Yes", where the main characteristic of the Velvet Underground-inspired song is the lowest vocals Chris Martin ever recorded - this was suggested by the producer Brian Eno, to make every single song sound different. The band's drummer Will Champion said in an interview for MTV: [...] "One of the main things we <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> with this record is changing vocal identities, because Chris has a very recognizable voice." [...] Coldplay sparked an interest at Hispanic influences after having recorded in churches and in Spanish-speaking countries such as in Mexico in North America and Spain in Europe, such as Barcelona. However, it was stressed that the influence was not in any specific sound but a general feel to the songs taken as a whole. On their website, the band also described taking acoustic guitars and basic recording equipment to churches and experimenting with particular sounds.|$|E
