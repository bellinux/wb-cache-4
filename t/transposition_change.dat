40|$|This study {{attempts}} {{to evaluate the}} types and accuracy of two translation strategies, i. e. <b>transposition</b> (<b>change</b> of grammatical category) and modulation (change in point of view) used to translate tourism texts from English into Indonesian. The study {{is intended to be}} a descriptive and qualitative method. The data sources are obtained from documents and inter-raters. The documents are tourism texts along with their translations taken from Garuda Indonesia magazine. To reveal the types of transposition and modulation, the English and Indonesian texts were analyzed by the researcher. To know the accuracy of transposition and modulation, the translations were rated by three expert raters. The results of the analysis show that: (1) there are three types of transposition: (a) the change from singular to plural (and vice versa), or in the position of the adjective, (b) the change in grammatical structure from SL to TL because the SL grammatical structure does not exist in TL and (c) an alternative to when literal translation of SL text may not accord with natural usage in TL; (2) {{there are two types of}} modulation: (a) obligatory modulation and (b) free modulation; (3) the transposition used is generally accurate. Of the 174 sentences analyzed, 158 sentences (98. 8 %) are accurate, 5 sentences (2. 8 %) are less accurate and 11 sentences (6. 4 %) are inaccurate; and (4) the modulation used is generally less accurate. Of the 172 sentences analyzed, 30 sentences (17. 4 %) are accurate, 87 sentences (50. 6 %) are less accurate and 55 sentences (32 %) are inaccurate. The findings imply that transposition and modulation might be fundamental for translation strategies, a distinction which has been taken for granted in translating activities...|$|E
25|$|In {{traditional}} Western notation, {{the scale}} {{used for a}} composition is usually indicated by a key signature at the beginning to designate the pitches that make up that scale. As the music progresses, the pitches used may change and introduce a different scale. Music can be transposed from one scale to another for various purposes, often to accommodate the range of a vocalist. Such transposition raises or lowers the overall pitch range, but preserves the intervallic relationships of the original scale. For example, transposition from the key of C major to D major raises all pitches of the scale of C major equally by a whole tone. Since the interval relationships remain unchanged, transposition may be unnoticed by a listener, however other qualities may <b>change</b> noticeably because <b>transposition</b> <b>changes</b> {{the relationship of the}} overall pitch range compared to the range of the instruments or voices that perform the music. This often affects the music's overall sound, as well as having technical implications for the performers.|$|R
50|$|Systems with weights of 1, 3, 7, or 9, {{with the}} weights on {{neighboring}} numbers being different, are widely used: for example, 31 31 weights in UPC codes, 13 13 weights in EAN numbers (GS1 algorithm), and the 371 371 371 weights used in United States bank routing transit numbers. This system detects all single-digit errors and around 90% of transposition errors. 1, 3, 7, and 9 are used {{because they are}} coprime to 10, so changing any digit changes the check digit; using a coefficient that is divisible by 2 or 5 would lose information (because 5×0 + 5×2 + 5×4 + 5×6 + 5×8 + 0 modulo 10) and thus not catch some single-digit errors. Using different weights on neighboring numbers means that most <b>transpositions</b> <b>change</b> the check digit; however, because all weights differ by an even number, this does not catch transpositions of two digits that differ by 5, (0 and 5, 1 and 6, 2 and 7, 3 and 8, 4 and 9), since the 2 and 5 multiply to yield 10.|$|R
5000|$|Music written {{within the}} tonal system is {{generally}} analysed by defining a certain note {{as the primary}} or [...] "Tonic" [...] note and the derived triad is the [...] "Tonic" [...] chord. Other notes and chords are subservient to the Tonic and in a strict hierarchy: the [...] "Dominant" [...] note/chord is second in importance, others are lower down still. One example of this style of analysis is called Schenkerian analysis. However, this form of analysis {{cannot be applied to}} Atonal music since the very point is to make all the notes and chords equal: there is no hierarchy. Instead, notes/chords can be described in terms of their properties and relationships at any particular moment: whether one note is higher than another, whether one chord has more notes than another, whether one chord is more widely spaced than another, and so on. One can also compare and contrast different strings of notes as <b>transpositions</b> (<b>change</b> in pitch) or inversions (change in note order) of each other. These terms are also used to compare chords. These methods of analysis have been used for centuries but became more important as music began to lose its tonal basis. One also needs to consider other aspects, such as how two or more simultaneous melodies relate to each other (counterpoint) and the same tools are used for this.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Chromosomes evolve through genome {{rearrangement}} events, including inversions, transpositions, and inverted <b>transpositions,</b> that <b>change</b> {{the order}} and strandedness of genes within chromosomes. In this paper we present a method for estimating evolutionary histories for chromosomes based upon such events. The fundamental mathematical challenge of our approach is to estimate the true evolutionary distance between every pair of chromosomes, where the true evolutionary distance {{is the number of}} rearrangement events {{that took place in the}} evolutionary history between the chromosomes. We present two techniques, Exact- and Approx-IEBP, for estimating true evolutionary distances and prove guarantees about the accuracy of these techniques under a very general stochastic model of chromosomal evolution. We then show how we can use these estimated distances to obtain highly accurate estimates of chromosomal evolutionary history, significantly improving upon the previous best techniques...|$|R

To that end, we conducted an experiment in Uyghur, an agglutinative language from the Turkic family that employs an Arabic-based script in which both consonants and vowels are explicitly written. Participants had to reproduce the correct word forms in rapid serial visual presentation sentences that either contained jumbled words (with the same ligation or different ligation) or were intact. The results revealed that readers had more difficulty correctly reporting the target words in the jumbled sentences when the letter <b>transposition</b> involved <b>changes</b> in the ligation pattern, thus demonstrating that posi-tion-dependent allography affects letter position coding.

50|$|With the {{emergence}} of electronic commerce in the 2000s, some traditional sheet publishers, {{as well as new}} entrants, developed online retailer websites to offer sheet music in an electronic manner. The first to offer the service online was Sheet Music Direct (1997) but quickly followed by MusicNotes and Sheet Music Score who were able to offer interactive features like <b>transposition</b> and <b>change</b> of instrument using scorch (Avid) technology. New comer Sheet Music Plus only recently (2011) entered the market, offering PDF files only. Those commercial services started as worldwide retailers with a large base of licensed sheet music and fast delivery, but progressively offered digital print, ranging from PDF-files to more dynamic offerings such as Scorch technology (Avid) which allowed for midi accompaniment, and on-the-fly change of keys and instruments. In addition, the popular use of digital sheet music required interchangeable digital formats. As such, MusicXML became a common format to share sheet music files between applications and to archive sheet music files for future use.|$|R

40|$|The most {{frequent}} complication of the venous redirection (Mustard or Senning) operation for transposition {{of the great}} arteries is cardiac arrhythmia. Drug treatment of tachyarrhythmia often worsens bradyarrhythmia. Pacemakers can now treat both arrhythmias. The technique for implantation of pacemakers after redirection for <b>transposition</b> has <b>changed</b> over time from thoracotomy to subxiphoid to transvenous. Atrial pacing is almost always the mode of choice since the electrophysiologic abnormality is sinus node dysfunction with intact atrioventricular conduction. Twenty-nine patients aged 3 to 19 years (mean 9. 6) had implantation of a pacemaker a mean of 5. 5 years (range 1 to 14) after undergoing the Mustard operation for transposition of the great arteries. Symptoms referable to bradycardia were eliminated in each case. Four patients who received an antitachycardia pacemaker no longer have symptomatic tachycardia. Four patients have required reoperation, three because of lead problems and one because of traumatic erosion of the pacemaker. Pacemakers provide excellent relief of symptoms after the Mustard or Senning operation. Transvenous atrial automatic antitachycardia pacemakers offer the best combination of ease of implantation and symptomatic relief...|$|R

40|$|A plasmid, pDLL 4, was {{isolated}} from a Tn 5 tac 1 mutagenesis experiment with plasmid pZAQ. When pDLL 4 {{was transformed into}} wild-type rod-shaped cells, it caused cells in the population to become curved (C-shaped or convoluted). The Tn 5 tac 1 transposon was integrated within the carboxyl end of the ftsA gene in pDLL 4. This mutation was designated ftsAc. Subcloning ftsAc DNA into another plasmid vector verified that the curved-cell phenotype {{was caused by the}} expression of this altered gene. DNA sequence analysis of the ftsAc mutation revealed that the <b>transposition</b> event <b>changed</b> the DNA so that the last 28 amino acids of the FtsA protein were lost and 5 new amino acids were added. A radioactive peptide band corresponding to this truncated FtsAc protein was identified by a T 7 promoter-T 7 polymerase protein labeling system. Observations of thin sections of these curved cells with an electron microscope revealed aggregates of striated cylindrical structures traversing the cytoplasm. The ends of these aggregates appear to be at or near the cell membrane. The linear periodicity of the cylinders was approximately 11 nm, and the diameter of a cylinder was about 15 nm. Aggregates of as many as five cylinders were arrayed diagonally to the long axis of the curved cells, a finding that suggests that some type of internal organization may be causing the curved cell shape...|$|R
50|$|With the {{increased}} use of professional and personal computers during the 1980s, different programmers started working on desktop publishing music notation software. Various boxed music notation software applications appeared on the market, allowing users to input and edit sheet music digitally. In the beginning, the software only permitted printing on paper. It took some time before other virtual formats became possible (e.g. standard MIDI file, audio (wav, mp3) and MusicXML export). These files allowed manipulation such as instrument <b>changes,</b> <b>transposition</b> and even MIDI playback. In particular, software projects Finale and Sibelius grew to become successful commercial products and to define certain standards in digital music notation. Many free software projects also appeared (see list of scorewriters). Consequently, computer keyboard entry in combination with synthesizer keyboard entry became the most common method for music data entry in current digital use.|$|R

40|$|Existing audio-score {{alignment}} methods {{assume that}} the au-dio performance is faithful to a fully-notated MIDI score. For semi-improvised music (e. g. jazz), this assumption is strongly violated. In this paper, we {{address the problem of}} aligning semi-improvised music audio with a lead sheet. Our approach does not require prior training on performances of the lead sheet to be aligned. We start by analyzing the problem and propose to represent the lead sheet as a MIDI file together with a structural information file. Then we propose a dynamic-programming-based system to align the chromagram representations of the audio performance and the MIDI score. Techniques are proposed to address the chromagram scaling, key <b>transposition</b> and structural <b>change</b> (e. g. a performer unexpectedly repeats a section) problems. We test our system on 3 jazz lead sheets. For each sheet we align a set of solo piano performances and a set of full-band commercial recordings with different instrumentation and styles. Results show that our system achieves promising results on some highly improvised music. 1...|$|R

Its data were obtained through content analysis and analyzed by Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL) perspective as proposed by Halliday (1994) and translation technique as proposed by Molina and Albir (2002). The result indicates the followings. First, inauguration speech states inclination, probablity, obligation and usuality. It is dominated by median level of modality, then followed by high and low level. Its attitudes are expressed through subjective implicit, as the most frequent orientation, objective implicit, subjective explicit and objective explicit. Second, the first news media uses some translation techniques including established equivalent, reduction, combination and transposition.

In {{this paper}} an academic text with long sentences and an abstract content is translated and adapted for a larger target reader group.

Furthermore, long sentences have been broken into two or more shorter ones and in this process the importance of connectors has increased to keep the information together.

How and where genomic RNA are identified for retrovirus and retrotransposon assembly, and how translation and assembly processes are coordinated is poorly understood. To understand this process, the subcellular localization of Ty 3 RNA and capsid proteins and virus-like particles was investigated. We demonstrate that mRNAs, proteins, and virus-like particles of the yeast Ty 3 retrotransposon accumulate in association with cytoplasmic P-bodies, which are sites of mRNA translation repression, storage, and degradation. Deletions of genes encoding P-body proteins decreased Ty 3 <b>transposition</b> and caused <b>changes</b> {{in the pattern of}} Ty 3 foci, underscoring the biological significance of the association of Ty 3 virus-like protein components and P-bodies. These results suggest the hypothesis that P-bodies may serve to segregate translation and assembly functions of the Ty 3 genomic RNA to promote assembly of virus-like particles. Because Ty 3 has features of a simple retrovirus and P-body functions are conserved between yeast and metazoan organisms, these findings may provide insights into host factors that facilitate retrovirus assembly...|$|R

In the current study, we aimed to better understand the genetic mechanisms contributing to S. haemolyticus diversity in the hospital environment and their impact on the population structure and clinical relevant phenotypic traits. The analysis of a representative S. haemolyticus collection by multilocus sequence typing (MLST) has identified a single highly prevalent and diverse genetic lineage of nosocomial S. haemolyticus clonal complex (CC) 29 accounting for 91 % of the collection of isolates disseminated worldwide. The examination of the sequence changes at MLST loci during clonal diversification showed that recombination had a higher impact than mutation in shaping the S. haemolyticus population. Also, we ascertained that another mechanism contributing significantly to clonal diversification and adaptation was mediated by insertion sequence (IS) elements. We found that all nosocomial S. haemolyticus, belonging to different STs, were rich in IS 1272 copies, as determined by Southern hybridization of macrorestriction patterns. In particular, we observed that the chromosome of a S. haemolyticus strain within CC 29 was highly unstable during serial growth in vitro which paralleled with IS 1272 <b>transposition</b> events and <b>changes</b> in clinically relevant phenotypic traits namely, mannitol fermentation, susceptibility to beta-lactams, biofilm formation and hemolysis.

DNA synthesis typically {{extends from the}} 3 '-OH of the acceptor stem, which is complementary to sequences on the retroelement mRNA (the primer binding site, PBS). However, for some retrotransposons, including the yeast Ty 5 elements, sequences in the anticodon stem-loop of the initiator methionine tRNA (IMT) are complementary to the PBS. We {{took advantage of the}} genetic tractability of the yeast system to investigate the mechanism of Ty 5 priming. We found that transposition frequencies decreased at least 800 -fold for mutations in the Ty 5 PBS that disrupt complementarity with the IMT. Similarly, transposition was reduced at least 200 -fold for IMT mutations in the anticodon stem-loop. Base pairing between the Ty 5 PBS and IMT is essential for <b>transposition,</b> as compensatory <b>changes</b> that restored base pairing between the two mutant RNAs restored transposition significantly. An analysis of 12 imt mutants with base changes outside of the region of complementarity failed to identify other tRNA residues important for transposition. In addition, assays carried out with heterologous IMTs from Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Arabidopsis thaliana indicated that residues outside of the anticodon stem-loop have at most a fivefold effect on transposition.

Eight of 13 intact open reading frames of unknown function identified in pYVe 8081 had homologues in Yersinia pestis plasmid pCD 1 or in Y. enterocolitica serotype 0 : 9 plasmid pYVe 227. A region of approximately 17 kbp showed no DNA identity to pCD 1 or pYVe 227 and contained six potential new genes, a possible new replicon, and two intact insertion sequence (IS) elements. One intact IS element, ISYen 1, was a new IS belonging to the IS 256 family. Several vestigial IS elements appeared different from the IS distribution seen in the other LCR plasmids. The RepA proteins encoded by Y. enterocolitica serotype 0 : 8 pYVeWA and pYVe 8081 were identical. The putative pYVe 8081 replicon showed significant homology to the IncL/M replicon of pMU 407. 1 but was only distantly related to the replicons of pCD 1 and pYVe 227.

The insertion of En at a new location was confirmed by crosses of the stable mutants to responsive tester lines. The position of En at the primary transposition site was determined by backcrossing to an al et line using standard three-point tester lines. Secondary transpositions were detected by Chi-square comparisons of progeny to parental En linkage studies;Although En positions were found throughout the segment of chromosome examined, their distribution was not random and some regions of the chromosome were more likely to contain an inserted En. En 2 ̆ 7 s from all three autonomously mutating source alleles showed the same regional preferences and distributions of transposed En 2 ̆ 7 s from the three alleles were not significantly different in Chi-square tests. Both primary and secondary sites of insertion were located within these regions.
