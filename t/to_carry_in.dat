25|$|Vénus was {{too small}} and too weak for the Royal Navy (RN) to take her in as a sixth-rate frigate or even a post-ship. She was {{designed}} for short-range privateering in the Channel and the Bay of Biscay, rather than the longer-range escort or patrol work of a British sloop. Accordingly, she couldn't stow {{as much in the}} way of stores as the Admiralty needed; reducing her armament, relative to her French establishment, would have permitted her to carry the larger weight of stores she had <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>in</b> RN service.|$|E
25|$|Since E. imperialis is an {{important}} pollinator to orchid species, they experience excessive loads <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>in</b> their hind tibiae for maneuvers, nectar loading, and mate or prey transport. Thus, aerial agility and mobility is a necessary adaptation that bees of this species must acquire. Studies {{have shown that the}} energy E. imperialis bees expend on hovering in normal atmospheric conditions is not representative of their maximum aerodynamic performance capabilities. Bee muscle power output is proportional to the product of contraction frequency, muscle strain, and myofibrillar stress; for E. imperialis, the easiest method of enhancing power output is solely relying on increasing muscle strain by increasing the wing stroke amplitude approximately 40-50%. In short, the total inertial power required can be stored in the elastic elements of the thorax, and then subsequently released to reaccelerate the wings for greater lift.|$|E
25|$|With other European MPs Mullen tabled {{amendments}} {{to protect the}} right to life of the unborn and was also vocal on behalf of migrants’ human rights, freedom of conscience and victims of human trafficking in the Council. In October 2010 Mullen together with the Chairperson of the European People's Party at the Council of Europe, Luca Volontè, led the way in pushing through 29 {{amendments to}} the McCafferty Report. The McCafferty Report initially intended to severely restrict the right of medical staff to refuse to participate in procuring an abortion, but in the end was transformed into a resolution affirming the right to conscientiously object to abortion. Christine McCafferty, a former British MP and main author of the original resolution, said during deliberations that she sought to force private and religious hospitals and clinics to perform abortions.

25|$|In 1861, Goggin {{moved back}} to Virginia, {{entering}} the Confederate States Army on July 1, 1861 as a major in the 32nd Virginia Volunteer Infantry Regiment where {{he was assigned to}} lead a battalion. Goggin and the 32nd Virginia Infantry served under Maj. Gen. John B. Magruder in 1861 and into 1862 during the Peninsula Campaign. Goggin joined the First Corps, Army of Northern Virginia in April 1862, serving on the staff of Maj. Gen. Lafayette McLaws as his assistant adjutant general. He served in this capacity during all of the First Corps' engagements, in both the Army of Northern Virginia and the Army of Tennessee, until the spring of 1864. During the Battle of Fort Sanders in November 1863, Goggin carried a message from McLaws to Lt. Gen. James Longstreet, informing him that the attack was beginning to fail and it was futile <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>in</b> on. When McLaws was replaced with Maj. Gen. Joseph B. Kershaw in May 1864, Goggin served as his assistant adjutant general as well. His service in this post was highly praised by Goggin's superiors.|$|E
500|$|A Moldavian banner also survives in hand-colored {{versions}} illustrating Johannes de Thurocz's Chronica Hungarorum, {{with varying}} tinctures. These were first identified as Stephen's flags by Constantin Karadja, and described by later authors as {{a version of}} the or-an-vert scheme in the coat of arms. Other clues suggest that the field was a solid one of or, charged with an aurochs of or, but also that the preferred [...] "single Moldavian" [...] color was gules. Gules is also the color of Stephen's alleged war flag, defaced with an icon of Saint George and the Dragon and donated by the prince himself to Zograf monastery. However, scholar Petre Ș. Năsturel cautions that this may not be a heraldic object of any kind, but rather a votive offering. The [...] "war flag", he notes, is to small <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>in</b> battle, and does not match with images in either Thurocz or Marcin Bielski, nor with the description in Alexander Guagnini.|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} {{description of}} carbon monoxide poisoning dates to at least 200 BC by Aristotle. Documented cases {{of carbon monoxide}} {{being used as a}} method of suicide date to at least 100 BC in ancient Rome. In the AD 350s, the Roman emperor Julian suffered from carbon monoxide poisoning in Paris, and later described it in his work Misopogon: [...] "though the winter weather prevailed and continually increased in severity, even so I did not allow my servants to heat the house, because I was afraid of drawing out the dampness in the walls; but I ordered them <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>in</b> fire that had burned down and to place in the room a very moderate number of hot coals. But the coals, though there were not very many of them, brought out from the walls quantities of steam and this made me fall asleep. And since my head was filled with the fumes I was almost choked. Then I was carried outside." [...] This misunderstanding of the causes of carbon monoxide poisoning may have caused the death of Julian's successor, Jovian.|$|E

500|$|The season's {{visual effects}} were {{produced}} by Anthem Visual Effects, with the company's Lee Wilson serving as co-producer and visual effects supervisor. Because it was filmed in green screen, each episode contains an estimated 400 visual effect shots. In contrast, an average episode of Stargate SG-1, which Tapping starred in, contained only 12. One {{of the larger}} visual effects sequences was the opening sequence of the premiere, which took three months to produce. Each visual effect produced in the original webisodes was remastered. Among the characters, the movement of two-faced guy's rear face were made with Computer-generated imagery (CGI), {{though it was a}} difficult effect to produce. A prosthetic application was added to the back of Campbell's head when the second face is not talking. The mermaid character, Sally, was entirely a visual effect, with the face of Mandy May, wife of director Steven A. Adelson, rendered onto it. Creating the eponymous abnormals in [...] "Nubbins" [...] and their predator was what Sam Egan described as [...] "a proper budget-driven issue" [...] because rendering several CGI creatures at once and having them move would be difficult. It was decided to have them camouflaged in an attempt to make work easier for the visual effects team, but it did not work out as well as the producers hoped. To achieve Nubbin interaction with the cast, guide versions, nicknamed Oompa-Loompas, were made for them <b>to</b> <b>carry.</b> <b>In</b> designing Tesla's transition to a vampire, the producers, realizing vampires were included in several other works in the past, wanted to make them look unique.
