5|$|Adverse weather {{such as a}} storm or hail could devastate crop {{fields and}} orchards, and thus {{jeopardize}} the livelihood of farmers in <b>the</b> <b>affected</b> <b>area.</b> A role of zduhaći, according to folk tradition, was to lead storms and hail clouds away from their family estates, villages, or regions, to save their crops. A zduhać could take the storms and hail clouds over the territory of another zduhać to destroy its crops. The other zduhać would fly up to confront the bringer of bad weather, {{and there would be}} a fight between the zduhaći.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the most}} {{damaging}} tornado of the outbreak sequence occurred in Greensburg on the 4th, twenty-five tornadoes were confirmed that day. That number exploded to 84 the following day (May 5th), with many tornadoes near <b>the</b> <b>affected</b> <b>area</b> from the previous night. Most were in open country, but there were injuries {{in at least two}} spots in Kansas, and one death reported near a county lake in Ottawa County. 14 more tornadoes were confirmed on May 6th in the region before the outbreak finally ended.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Kenna was the third-strongest Pacific {{hurricane}} {{to make landfall}} on record. It {{was also}} the second-strongest October hurricane in any season, and the third strongest Pacific hurricane overall. In San Blas, Nayarit, 8,800people were affected; 1,540houses were damaged or destroyed, which was 80% to 90% of houses in the town. In Santiago Ixcluintla, 3,770houses were damaged. Agriculture in <b>the</b> <b>affected</b> <b>area</b> was disrupted. Farmers required aid, and many fruit crops were destroyed. Tourism in Puerto Vallarta was disrupted, {{with much of the}} damage to hotels. Insurance companies reported that Kenna's total damage was $96million (2002 USD).|$|E
5|$|Non-septic prepatellar {{bursitis}} can {{be treated}} with rest, the application of ice to <b>the</b> <b>affected</b> <b>area,</b> and anti-inflammatory drugs, particularly ibuprofen. Elevation of the affected leg during rest may also expedite the recovery process. Severe cases may require fine-needle aspiration of the bursa fluid, sometimes coupled with cortisone injections. However, some {{studies have shown that}} steroid injections may not be an effective treatment option. After the bursitis has been treated, rehabilitative exercise may help improve joint mechanics and reduce chronic pain.|$|E

5|$|Prepatellar {{bursitis}} {{is caused}} by either a single instance of acute trauma to the knee, or repeated minor trauma to the knee. The trauma can cause extravasation of nearby fluids into the bursa, which stimulates an inflammatory response. This response occurs in two phases: The vascular phase, in which the {{blood flow to the}} surrounding area increases, and the cellular phase, in which leukocytes migrate from the blood to <b>the</b> <b>affected</b> <b>area.</b> Other possible causes include gout, sarcoidosis, CREST syndrome, diabetes mellitus, alcohol abuse, uremia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Some cases are idiopathic, though these may be caused by trauma that the patient does not remember.|$|E
5|$|Some {{treatments}} for stroke are time-critical. These include clot dissolution or surgical {{removal of a}} clot for ischaemic strokes, and decompression for haemorrhagic strokes. As stroke is time critical, hospitals and even pre-hospital care of stroke involves expedited investigations – usually a CT scan to investigate for a haemorrhagic stroke and a CT or MR angiogram to evaluate arteries that supply the brain. MRI scans, not as widely available, {{may be able to}} demonstrate <b>the</b> <b>affected</b> <b>area</b> of the brain more accurately, particularly with ischaemic stroke.|$|E
5|$|THSRC has {{established}} a system to respond to natural disasters and unexpected intrusion onto the right-of-way, called DWS (Disaster Warning Systems). This system consists {{of a network of}} sensors installed along the rail route to detect unexpected situations such as earthquakes, strong winds, heavy rainfall, floods, landslides, and intrusions. In case of an unexpected situation, the DWS will send signals to the OCC (Operation Control Center) immediately; it will also activate contingency measures {{to ensure the safety of}} the passengers and trains, including decelerating or stopping trains in <b>the</b> <b>affected</b> <b>area.</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} make <b>the</b> <b>affected</b> <b>areas</b> receive urgent relief service timely and {{accurately}} after the disasters, the effective operation of emergency logistics and quick response to the urgent demands in <b>the</b> <b>affected</b> <b>areas</b> is very critical. In this paper, firstly, the emergency supply chain management in disasters is presented, {{and the risk of}} disasters and urgent relief decision-making are analyzed, then the support mechanism of emergency logistics including infrastructure support, unified command and network coordination, law guarantee, contingency plan and emergency transportation channel is analyzed. Secondly, the evaluating indicators are specified by introducing the salvable degree concept, the salvable degrees of <b>the</b> <b>affected</b> <b>areas</b> which lie on the impact degrees of relief demands in <b>the</b> corresponding <b>affected</b> <b>areas</b> are analyzed and evaluated by the extension technique, and then a two-objective optimization model with the urgent relief demand time-varying fill rate maximization and the urgent relief distribution time-varying window minimization is developed in order to distribute urgent relief to <b>the</b> identified <b>affected</b> <b>area</b> sets. Finally, a numerical example demonstrates our conclusions...|$|R

5|$|Adjuvant {{radiotherapy}} {{is commonly}} used in early-stage (stage I or II) endometrial cancer. It can be delivered through vaginal brachytherapy (VBT), which is becoming the preferred route due to its reduced toxicity, or external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). Brachytherapy involves placing a radiation source in the organ affected; {{in the case of}} endometrial cancer a radiation source is placed directly in the vagina. External beam radiotherapy involves a beam of radiation aimed at <b>the</b> <b>affected</b> <b>area</b> from outside the body. VBT is used to treat any remaining cancer solely in the vagina, whereas EBRT can be used to treat remaining cancer elsewhere in the pelvis following surgery. However, the benefits of adjuvant radiotherapy are controversial. Though EBRT significantly reduces the rate of relapse in the pelvis, overall survival and metastasis rates are not improved. VBT provides a better quality of life than EBRT.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, he {{designed}} the Racz catheter, a flexible, spring-wound catheter {{with a small}} fluoroscopic probe. In 1989, he developed epidural lysis of adhesions, {{sometimes referred to as}} percutaneous adhesiolysis, or simply the Racz procedure. It is a minimally invasive, percutaneous intervention for treating chronic spinal pain often due to scarring after post lumbar surgery syndrome, sometimes called failed back surgery, and also low-back and radicular pain from spinal stenosis, a disease of aging. The procedure is somewhat similar to an epidural and is used when conventional methods have failed. The Racz procedure may employ the use of a wire-bound catheter to mechanically break-up or dissolve scar tissue, also called epidural adhesions or fibrosis, which have formed around the nerve roots, and allows for local anesthetics, saline, and steroids to be injected into <b>the</b> <b>affected</b> <b>area.</b>|$|E
5|$|Every {{game in the}} SmackDown vs. Raw series used to {{have the}} amount of damage inflicted to the player's chosen superstar, {{measured}} with a meter on the HUD, where a design of a male figure presented the damage. As a move was performed against a superstar, <b>the</b> <b>affected</b> <b>area</b> of the body flashed—the more damage that is done to that specific body part, {{the more likely it}} is for the superstar to submit. Colors were used to represent the amount of damage done to a specific body area; yellow represented minimal damage, orange represented moderate damage, and red represented maximum damage. This was however taken out of WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2010. Now the only way to tell how damaged the opponent is to watch their physical body actions that indicate how hurt they are. The more damage inflicted to opponents, {{the more likely it is}} for them to lose the match. There are four ways to win a match in every game: by pinfall, submission, knockout, countout; alternatively, the match could end in a draw. With the introduction of an on-screen referee in WWF SmackDown! Just Bring It, the ability to win by disqualification was also included.|$|E

5|$|The {{electric}} {{shock of the}} common torpedo can be severe, but is not life-threatening. In classical antiquity, the electrogenic properties of this species led it (and other strongly electric fishes) {{to be used in}} medicine for the treatment of pain and diseases such as gout. For example, the Roman physician Scribonius Largus, in his Compositiones medicae (c. 50 AD), recommended that chronic headaches be treated by the application of a live torpedo to <b>the</b> <b>affected</b> <b>area.</b> The common torpedo is edible, but is little-valued by commercial or artisanal fisheries and is mostly discarded when caught. Because of its shallow-water habits, it may survive being captured and discarded relatively well. It is susceptible to several types of demersal fishing gear, including bottom trawls and trammel nets; fishing activity is heavy within its range but no specific data regarding this species are available. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it under Data Deficient. The common torpedo has been kept in aquariums, but requires live fish for food.|$|E
5|$|On March20, the {{government}} of Madagascar appealed {{to the international community}} for assistance, due to the heavy damage from the cyclone. In response to the request, various governments and international organizations provided assistance to Madagascar, including $490,000 from the European Economic Community for food and blankets, as well as $125,000 from UNICEF for medicine and building supplies. Catholic Relief Services donated clothing, rice, and milk from Caritas Madagascar. Countries that provided assistance included China, France, the United Kingdom, the United States, West Germany, Holy See, Mauritius, Canada, Finland, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Soviet Union, and Switzerland. Collectively, the international community provided $3.37million worth of aid to Madagascar. The United States Pacific Command flew from the Philippines to Madagascar to deliver medicine. The nation had earlier helped Madagascar recover from Cyclone Kamisy in 1984 with housing rebuilding projects, and transferred materials due to the impacts from Honorinina to the Toamasina area. The Malagasy government also set up a National Relief Committee to facilitate relief efforts, including an initial inspection of <b>the</b> <b>affected</b> <b>area</b> to determine needs. Workers delivered about 19tons of material to Toamasina and nearby Brickaville, including milk, blankets, and clothing. The World Bank estimated the cost for repairing commercial areas would be over $27million (1986USD). The agency also allocated funds toward repairing damaged power facilities, ports, roads, and airports. The International Monetary Fund also approved a $37.8million loan to the country in 1986, half of which for emergency aid. Many houses and buildings had to be closed for repairs due to flood damage, including hotels, churches, and schools.|$|E
25|$|The Malaysian API {{does not}} have a capped value; hence its most {{hazardous}} readings can go above 500. Above 500, a state of emergency is declared in <b>the</b> <b>affected</b> <b>area.</b> Usually, this means that non-essential government services are suspended, and all ports in <b>the</b> <b>affected</b> <b>area</b> are closed. There may also be prohibitions on private sector commercial and industrial activities in <b>the</b> <b>affected</b> <b>area</b> excluding the food sector. So far, state of emergency rulings due to hazardous API levels were applied to the Malaysian towns of Port Klang, Kuala Selangor and the state of Sarawak during the 2005 Malaysian haze and the 1997 Southeast Asian haze.|$|E
