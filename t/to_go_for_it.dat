25|$|In {{order to}} stay in the top flight, Middlesbrough needed relegation rivals Newcastle and Hull City to lose, while they needed a five-goal swing to Hull in goal difference. Stewart Downing's injury kept him out of a Premier League game {{for the first time since}} November 2006, also {{throwing}} doubt on a possible summer transfer, and Tuncay captained the side. Boro had <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> <b>it,</b> but instead they fell behind. Gary O'Neil temporarily brought his side level, but they again conceded and lost 2–1. With Newcastle and Hull both losing, the opportunity to escape was there for Middlesbrough, but they had failed to take it.

25|$|Once {{the second}} quarter commenced, both Brown and Gresham moved the ball for a {{touchdown}} on three different plays. Tech started their next drive at their own 38 and advanced the ball through the air to eventually get to the Oklahoma 15. Two incompletions caused the Red Raiders to face a 4th-and-3. Tech decided <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> Woods was unable to catch a pass by Harrell to convert and Tech turned the ball over on downs. Murray rushed the ball for 23yards on Oklahoma's first play of the drive. Murray followed with a 31-yard reception, which put {{the ball on the}} Tech 30. After two rushes by Brown, Gresham scored a touchdown on a 19-yard catch, and the subsequent extra point extended the Sooners lead to 21–0. Oklahoma's defense forced Tech to four plays on the next drive, with the fourth play being a 4th-and-4, Tech's second 4th down conversion attempt. With 9:31 remaining, Oklahoma completed a 1:44 scoring drive, which was capped by Juaquin Iglesias' 28-yard scoring reception.

25|$|Iowa {{started the}} second half with the ball but they would punt the ball to Wisconsin after three plays. Wisconsin {{would do the same}} as they punted the ball back to Iowa. The Hawkeyes drive the ball to the Badgers 35-yard line. On fourth-and-one, Iowa decided <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> and failed as the Badgers defense stuffed the run up the middle. Still the Badgers {{struggled}} to move the ball on the Iowa defense and punted it back to the Hawkeyes. The Wisconsin punt was downed at the Iowa 1-yard line. On the first play, Iowa tried to pass out of their own end zone. The pass was intercepted by CB Darius Hillary at the Iowa 20-yard line. During that play Iowa starting QB Jake Rudock was injured and would not return to the game. On the very next play, Joel Stave connected with WR Jared Abbrederis on a 20-yard touchdown pass. Jared Abbrederis was injured on the touchdown catch and he would not return to the game. Iowa's backup QB C.J. Beathard would come in but failed to pick up a first down so they punted.

Iowa would again get into the red zone at the Wisconsin 12-yard line but once again they were forced to settle for a 29-yard field goal. Wisconsin would have the ball as the third quarter came to a close with the Badgers holding onto a slight 14–9 lead. The Badgers got to midfield put punted the ball back to the Hawkeyes. The Badgers would get pressure on the Iowa backup QB and forced a bad throw that hit off an Iowa helmet, popped {{up in the air and}} was intercepted by DE Pat Muldoon at the Iowa 25-yard line.

Wisconsin took over at their own 24-yard line and on the second play of the drive, James White broke loose for a 59-yard run down to the Iowa 17. The Iowa defense tried to hold Wisconsin but finally James White punched it in with a 2-yard touchdown run giving the Badgers a 28–9 lead.
