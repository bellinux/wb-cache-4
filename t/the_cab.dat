5|$|On June 2, 1956, the Republican National Committee {{announced}} that Chotiner {{would have no}} role in the upcoming campaign. On June 6, a House subcommittee disclosed that the California attorney had written to President Eisenhower asking the President to intercede on behalf of Stanley Weiss's low-cost charter line North American Airlines (NAA) before the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB). The attorney admitted inquiring of White House aides concerning the case, but denied using any influence on behalf of any client.

5|$|The {{accident}} was investigated by <b>the</b> <b>CAB</b> and included two hearings where, among others, the surviving captain and flight engineer testified. Based on their investigation, <b>the</b> <b>CAB</b> {{concluded that the}} momentary fuel pressure fluctuations in the number 3 and 4 (right side) engines noticed by the flight engineer during takeoff, were most likely caused by a boost pump failure, and did not necessitate any action {{as long as the}} engines kept running normally. According to <b>the</b> <b>CAB,</b> by opening the cross-feed valves between the number 3 and 4 fuel tanks, and leaving them open with the boost pump on for much of the flight, the flight engineer most likely caused the number 4 tank to run dry, resulting in the failure of both right side engines due to fuel exhaustion or starvation during the final flight segment.|$|E

5|$|The main design {{differences}} with the Nclass included <b>the</b> <b>cab</b> front, exhaust arrangements, {{and the addition of}} an extra (inside) cylinder between the frames to drive the centre driving axle. Clayton had revised the layout of <b>the</b> <b>cab</b> front spectacle plates (small windows on the front of <b>the</b> <b>cab)</b> to improve forward visibility. This incorporated two large single panes of glass either side of the boiler instead of the four smaller windows used on the Nclass. The inside cylinder was to be actuated by Holcroft's design of conjugated valve gear, which consisted of mechanical links fitted to both sets of outside Walschaerts gear, eliminating the need for a separate set of valve gear between the frames to operate the inside cylinder. The result would be a reduction in weight and the amount of mechanical equipment located in this inaccessible part of the locomotive.|$|E
5|$|After {{extensive}} evaluation, the 166th Aviation Brigade completed {{training for}} the Combat Aviation Brigade (CAB), 34th Infantry Division on 4 August 2008.

30|$|Besides the {{responsible}} authorities, the municipalities {{are the main}} actors in terms of knowledge. The MSB sees the municipalities as the key users of the assessments and risk/hazard maps. As such, knowledge of their needs is crucial to rendering the material as useful as possible for them. Open meetings bringing together the municipalities and <b>the</b> <b>CABs</b> are planned, where different municipal departments will need to participate. The MSB also sees the municipalities as the main contributors to the flood risk management plans. <b>The</b> <b>CABs</b> {{tend to focus on}} the flood risk maps. If needed, the municipalities will be asked for complementary data. For the flood risk management plans, the general picture provided is that <b>the</b> <b>CABs</b> will develop preliminary plans that will then be discussed with the municipalities concerned.|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} years of the railway, brakemen just had an open seat. <b>The</b> first <b>cabs</b> {{appeared}} around 1880. The number of brakeman's cabs occupied in a given train depended on the conditions of the route and the speed of the train; on some trains all <b>the</b> <b>cabs</b> might be occupied. Communication between engine driver and brakemen was by train whistle signals which required the design of <b>the</b> brakeman's <b>cab</b> to be partially open to the elements.|$|R
5|$|An unusual {{fault with}} the first engines of the class was fore-and-aft vibration, strong enough to prompt {{passengers}} to complain and to cause fire-irons stowed in a longitudinal compartment {{on top of the}} tender to work their way forward into <b>the</b> <b>cab.</b> The passengers' complaints were dealt with by reducing the tension in the drawbar spring.|$|E
5|$|Both {{weapons were}} to be {{sufficiently}} compact to be carried hands-free on the user's person at all times, whether in <b>the</b> <b>cab</b> of a vehicle or the cockpit of an aircraft, and were to perform effectively in all environments and weather conditions.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, the UK's most {{disastrous}} SPAD ever {{occurred at}} Harrow and Wealdstone, in which No. 46242 City of Glasgow was severely damaged. The {{lack of an}} ATC system on most of Britain's railways was at last seen as an urgent issue. From 1956 the BR-designed Automatic Warning System (AWS) was installed. It was similar to ATC but relied on an induced magnetic field rather than an electric current and featured a visual indicator in <b>the</b> <b>cab.</b> The receiving system was installed on the Coronation class locomotives from 1959 onwards. The outward evidence of on-board AWS comprised a protective shield behind the front screw coupling, a box to house the necessary batteries immediately in front of <b>the</b> <b>cab</b> {{on the right-hand side}} and a cylindrical vacuum reservoir above the right-hand running plate.|$|E
