5|$|Eventually, Shashthi came to {{represent}} all goddesses and forces responsible for causing diseases {{in children and}} their mothers, who needed to be propitiated on <b>the</b> <b>sixth</b> day after childbirth to prevent these illnesses. Consequently, Shashthi came to personify <b>the</b> <b>sixth</b> day of a child's life. <b>The</b> <b>sixth</b> day of the lunar fortnight is itself called Shashti, a name derived from {{the name of the}} goddess. The Yajnavalkya Smriti, composed during Gupta rule between the 3rd and 5th centuries CE, describes the rites of Shashthi Puja in which Shashthi is worshipped on <b>the</b> <b>sixth</b> day after childbirth to ensure the protection of the newborn baby. According to one explanation for the worship of Shashthi on this day, folk belief associates this critical time in an infant's life with great susceptibility to diseases related to childbirth, such as puerperal fever and tetanus, and that worship of Shashthi is performed to help ward off these diseases.|$|E

50|$|Classical {{harmonic}} theory would notate {{the substitution}} as an augmented sixth chord on II (<b>the</b> augmented <b>sixth</b> being enharmonic to the dominant/minor seventh). <b>The</b> augmented <b>sixth</b> chord {{can either be}} <b>the</b> Italian <b>sixth</b> It+6, which is enharmonically equivalent to a dominant seventh chord without the fifth; <b>the</b> German <b>sixth</b> Gr+6, which is enharmonically equivalent to a dominant seventh chord with the fifth; or <b>the</b> French <b>sixth</b> Fr+6, which is enharmonically equivalent to the Lydian dominant without the fifth but with a sharp eleven, all of which serve in a classical context {{as a substitute for}} the secondary dominant of V.|$|R

5|$|By November <b>the</b> <b>Sixth</b> Army had {{occupied}} most of Stalingrad, pushing the defending Red Army {{to the banks}} of the Volga River. By this stage, there were indications of an impending Soviet offensive which would target Wehrmacht forces around the city, including increased Soviet activity opposite <b>the</b> <b>Sixth</b> Army's flanks, and information gained through the interrogation of Soviet prisoners. However, the German command was intent upon finalizing its capture of Stalingrad. In fact, head of Army General Staff General Franz Halder had been dismissed in September after his efforts to warn about the danger which was developing along the over-extended flanks of <b>the</b> <b>Sixth</b> Army and the Fourth Panzer Army. As early as September the Soviet Stavka (high command) began planning a series of counteroffensives to encompass the destruction of German forces in the south, fighting in Stalingrad and in the Caucasus, and against Army Group Center. Ultimately, command of Soviet efforts to relieve Stalingrad was put under the leadership of General Aleksandr Vasilevsky.|$|E
