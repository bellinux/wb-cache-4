5|$|On the upland farms of Wales, Welsh ponies and cobs {{would often}} have <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> from {{ploughing}} a field to carrying a farmer to market or driving {{a family to}} services on Sunday. When coal mining became important to the economy of England, many Welsh ponies were harnessed for use in mines, above and below ground.|$|E

5|$|Skelton {{believed}} that his life's work {{was to make}} people laugh; {{he wanted to be}} known as a clown because he defined it as being able <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>everything.</b> He had a 70-year career as a performer and entertained three generations of Americans. His widow donated many of his personal and professional effects to Vincennes University, including prints of his artwork. They are part of the Red Skelton Museum of American Comedy at Vincennes.|$|E

50|$|The {{hospital}} is also committed <b>to</b> <b>doing</b> <b>everything</b> possible <b>to</b> preserve {{and improve the}} quality of life. To that end, Laniado often provides expensive and often non-reimbursable medical services which exceed its annual operating budget of $50 million. The hospital relies heavily on private donations to make up its budget shortfall.|$|R
5|$|The scandal {{began as}} an {{operation}} to free seven American hostages being held in Lebanon by Hezbollah, a paramilitary group with Iranian ties connected to the Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution. It was planned that Israel would ship weapons to Iran, and then the United States would resupply Israel and receive the Israeli payment. The Iranian recipients promised <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> {{in their power to}} achieve the release of the hostages. Large modifications to the plan were devised by Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North of the National Security Council in late 1985, in which a portion of the proceeds from the weapon sales was diverted to fund anti-Sandinista, or Contras, in Nicaragua.|$|E
5|$|Chadwick {{accepted}} that the Americans {{did not need}} British help, but that it could still be useful in bringing the project to an early and successful conclusion. Working closely with {{the director of the}} Manhattan Project, Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., he attempted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> he could to support the effort. He also endeavoured to place British scientists in as many parts of the project as possible in order to facilitate a post-war British nuclear weapons project to which Chadwick was committed. Requests from Groves via Chadwick for particular scientists tended to be met with an immediate rejection by the company, ministry or university currently employing them, only to be overcome by the overriding priority accorded to Tube Alloys. As a result, the British team was critical to the Project's success.|$|E
5|$|Themistocles now {{developed}} a second strategy. The route to southern Greece (Boeotia, Attica and the Peloponnesus) {{would require the}} army of Xerxes to travel through the very narrow pass of Thermopylae. This could easily be blocked by the Greek hoplites, despite the overwhelming numbers of Persians; furthermore, to prevent the Persians bypassing Thermopylae by sea, the Athenian and allied navies could block the straits of Artemisium. However, after the Tempe debacle, it was uncertain whether the Spartans {{would be willing to}} march out from the Peloponnesus again. To persuade the Spartans to defend Attica, Themistocles had to show them that the Athenians were willing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> necessary for the success of the alliance. In short, the entire Athenian fleet must be dispatched to Artemisium.|$|E

Indeed, Salieri, {{who has been}} a devout Catholic all his life, cannot believe that God would choose Mozart over him for such a gift.

MacNeill was briefly persuaded to go along with some sort of action when Mac Diarmada revealed to him that a German arms shipment was about to land in County Kerry. MacNeill believed that when the British learned of the shipment they would immediately suppress the Volunteers, thus the Volunteers would be justified in taking defensive action, including the planned manoeuvres.|$|E

25|$|After {{his failure}} to win the Italian {{championship}} with Fiorentina, Batistuta started considering a transfer to a bigger team. In {{an effort to keep}} Batistuta, Fiorentina hired Giovanni Trapattoni as coach and promised <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> to win the Scudetto. After an excellent start to the season, Batistuta suffered an injury that kept him out of action for more than a month. Losing momentum, Fiorentina lost the lead and finished the season in third place, although the result enabled them to participate in the Champions League the following season.|$|E
25|$|In June, {{after the}} last of the {{primaries}} had taken place, Obama secured the Democratic nomination for President, with the help of multiple super delegate endorsements (most of the super delegates had refused to declare their support for either candidate until the primaries were completed). He was the first African American to win the nomination of a major political party in the United States. For several days, Clinton refused to concede the race, although she signaled her presidential campaign was ending in a post-primary speech on June 3 in her home state of New York. She finally conceded the nomination to Obama on June 7. She pledged her full support to the presumptive nominee and vowed <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> she could to help him get elected.|$|E

In {{exchange}} for that wish, however, that girl must become a magical girl who must fight against witches, creatures born from despair {{that are responsible for}} accidents, disease, and suicide. In the city of Mitakihara, a girl named Madoka Kaname is approached by a creature named Kyubey with the offer of becoming a magical girl. Meanwhile, another magical girl named Homura Akemi seeks <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> in her power to stop Madoka from becoming one. Madoka soon learns that the life of a magical girl is not the dreamlike fantasy she imagined and is instead filled with tragedy and despair.|$|E
