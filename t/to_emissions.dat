The 351M used the 400's tall deck block, and shared its connecting rods and intake manifold, so more parts were shared than between the 400 and 351C saving Ford production costs. The 351M and 351W had no appreciable power output difference; due <b>to</b> <b>emissions</b> standards, the 351M was not available in California.|$|E
25|$|Of most {{concern in}} these {{anthropogenic}} factors is {{the increase in}} CO2 levels. This is due <b>to</b> <b>emissions</b> from fossil fuel combustion, followed by aerosols (particulate matter in the atmosphere), and the CO2 released by cement manufacture. Other factors, including land use, ozone depletion, animal husbandry (ruminant animals such as cattle produce methane, as do termites), and deforestation, are also of concern in the roles they playnbsp&– both separately and {{in conjunction with other}} factorsnbsp&– in affecting climate, microclimate, and measures of climate variables.|$|E
25|$|From 2002, {{the policy}} of the Labour-led Clark Government was to {{implement}} a carbon tax in 2007. The proposed carbon tax would have applied to the whole economy, except for emissions of agricultural methane and nitrous oxide. The tax would have been $15 per tonne of carbon dioxide or equivalent, based on approximating the international price of emissions. It would have been capped at $25 per tonne. The carbon tax policy was intended to be a precursor <b>to</b> <b>emissions</b> trading when it became internationally established.|$|E

25|$|While {{monitoring}} and controlling environmental releases of plants has been difficult, the EPA has been enforcing their policies regarding air quality {{over the last}} decade under President Barack Obama. While the Clean Air Act postulates regulations and rules limiting the emissions of greenhouse gases, other laws are concerned with standards of power plants and initiatives to enforce these laws have been formed. The impacts of mining are diverse and have possible negative effects for humans and the biosphere. Among these are acid mine drainage, subsidence and mine workers' health risks, to prevent which there are regulations regarding mining practices like strip mining. Even though regulations seek to address environmental impacts, they often do not provide remedy for the social and health disparities created by exposure <b>to</b> <b>emissions</b> from electric power plants.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} argued that {{regardless}} of the economic, scientific and technical aspects, the difficulty of achieving concerted political action on global warming requires other approaches. Those arguing political expediency say the difficulty of achieving meaningful emissions cuts and the effective failure of the Kyoto Protocol demonstrate the practical difficulties of achieving carbon dioxide emissions reduction by the agreement of the international community. However, others point to support for climate engineering proposals among think tanks with a history of global warming skepticism and opposition <b>to</b> <b>emissions</b> reductions as evidence that the prospect of climate engineering is itself already politicized and being promoted as part of an argument against the need for (and viability of) emissions reductions; that, rather than climate engineering being a solution to the difficulties of emissions reductions, the prospect of climate engineering is being used as part of an argument to stall emissions reductions in the first place.|$|E

25|$|Architectural copper is, however, {{susceptible}} to corrosive attack under certain conditions. Oxidizing acids, oxidizing heavy-metal salts, alkalis, sulfur and nitrogen oxides, ammonia, and some sulfur and ammonium compounds can expedite copper corrosion. Precipitation {{in areas with}} a pH less than 5.5 may corrode copper, possibly before a patina or protective oxide film has the time to form. Acidic precipitation, known as acid rain, is due <b>to</b> <b>emissions</b> from fossil fuel combustion, chemical manufacturing, or other processes that release sulfur and nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere. Erosion corrosion may occur when acidic water from a non-copper roof that does not neutralise the acidity, such as tile, slate, wood, or asphalt, falls on a small area of copper. Line corrosion can occur if the drip edge of an inert roofing material rests directly on copper. A solution to this may be to raise the lower edge of the shingles with a cant strip, or to provide a replaceable reinforcing strip between the shingles and the copper. Proper water-shedding design and detailing, which reduces the dwell time of acidic water on metal surfaces, can prevent the majority of atmospheric corrosion problems.|$|E
25|$|Most {{truck drivers}} are {{employed}} as over-the-road drivers, meaning they are hired to drive long distances {{from the place}} of pickup {{to the place of}} delivery. During the short times while they are in heavily polluted urban areas, being inside the cab of the truck contributes much to avoiding the inhalation of toxic emissions, and on the majority of the trip, while they are passing through vast rural areas where there is little air pollution, truck drivers in general enjoy less exposure to toxic emissions in the air than the inhabitants of large cities, where there is an increased exposure <b>to</b> <b>emissions</b> from engines, factories, etc., which may increase the risk of cancer and can aggravate certain lung diseases, such as asthma in the general public who inhabit these cities. However, the few drivers who are hired to drive only within urban areas do not have this advantage of spending more time away from toxic emissions that is enjoyed by over-the-road drivers. Other conditions affecting the health of truck drivers are for example vibration, noise, long periods of sitting, work stress and exhaustion. For drivers in developing countries there are additional risks because roads are in appalling conditions and accidents occur more frequently. Truck drivers are even a high-risk group for HIV-infection in those countries.|$|E
