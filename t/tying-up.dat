Meanwhile, the seven dressed-up young men were arrested and their arms tied with rope in Miquit-a-sicu fashion (tied elbows meeting at one’s back), the Spanish military method of <b>tying-up</b> prisoners, that was guaranteed to produce intense and continuous pain at the shoulders, elbows and chest. They were then taken to the town of Baculud (now Bacolor), then the capital of Pampanga, where the provincial jail was located. They were never heard from again to this day, however, two were identified – Cornelio Manalang and Crispulo Punsalan.|$|E

60|$|Afternoon is all {{warm and}} golden. Oat sheaves are lighter; they whisper {{to each other}} as they freely embrace. The long, stout stubble tinkles as the foot brushes over it; the scent of the straw is sweet. When the poor, {{bleached}} sheaves are lifted out of the hedge, a spray of nodding wild raspberries is disclosed, with belated berries ready to drop; among the damp grass lush blackberries may be discovered. Then one notices that the last bell hangs from the ragged spire of fox-glove. The talk is of people, an odd book; of one's hopes—and the future; of Canada, where work is strenuous, but not life; where the plains are wide, and one is not lapped in a soft valley, like an apple that falls in a secluded orchard. The mist steals over the face of the warm afternoon. The <b>tying-up</b> is all finished, and it only remains to rear up the fallen bundles into shocks. The sun sinks into a golden glow in the west. The gold turns to red, the red darkens, like a fire burning low, the sun disappears behind the bank of milky mist, purple like the pale bloom on blue plums, and we put on our coats and go home.|$|E

Differential diagnoses for grass sickness are varied and include any other cause of colic and weight loss, <b>tying-up,</b> laminitis, botulism, choke and dental problems.|$|E
50|$|Methocarbamol, {{sold under}} the trade name Robaxin, is a muscle relaxant {{commonly}} used in horses to treat muscle pain secondary to spasticity, tetanus, or <b>tying-up.</b> Both oral and injectable forms are on the market. Its use is regulated by many equine competitive governing bodies, since it {{is thought to have}} a CNS depressant effect and produces the metabolite guaifenesin, which is a pre-anesthetic veterinary drug. Guaifenesin has been found in the plasma of horses receiving oral, but not intravenous, methocarbamol, likely due to the high first-pass effect of the drug.|$|E

50|$|Warren Ellis's run would refocus {{the stories}} and redefine the cast of {{characters}} while <b>tying-up</b> the first volume (with issue #47) and spanning the entire 12-issue run of the second volume. His version of Stormwatch injected sexual and horror elements, thinly-disguised political commentary and criticism of the United States government into the stories. The accompanying art was toned down from the more-exaggerated 1990s superhero-style, which dominated the early Image Comics, helping to emphasize the science fiction aspect of the storylines. During this period Ellis used Stormwatch to introduce {{the concept of the}} Bleed, a space between parallel universes which later featured in Planetary and other comics set in the Wildstorm Universe. By the end of volume one Ellis made Henry Bendix a manipulative villain.|$|E

40|$|Some unfortunate horses develop stiffness, painful muscle contractures, profuse sweating, and {{elevated}} respiratory rates during or following exercise. The term “tying-up ” {{is used to}} describe horses with these clinical signs. In severe cases, horses {{may be unable to}} move their hindquarters after exercise, and muscle breakdown results in dark urine due to the release of myoglobin. Horses may be so painful with <b>tying-up</b> that they will paw and roll resembling colic. Other terms for this syndrome include azoturia, Monday morning disease, exertional rhabdomyolysis, and chronic intermittent rhabdomyolysis. It has been implied or assumed that there is one underlying cause for <b>tying-up</b> in horses. In 1917, Dr. Steffin commented on <b>tying-up,</b> saying “no one disease in the horse has been subject to so many theories and hypothetical suggestions as this one. ” This statement remains true. Veterinarians and owners have noted improvement in their horses’ signs of <b>tying-up</b> with various new diets or supplements. The variable response of horses to these treatments has fueled the controversy regarding <b>tying-up</b> and its actual basis. In this article, we provide a brief review of the history of tying-u...|$|E
40|$|Although horses {{share similar}} {{clinical}} signs of acute rhabdomyolysis, numerous etiologies exist for <b>tying-up.</b> In Quarter Horses <b>tying-up</b> is often {{caused by a}} heritable glycogen-storage disorder called polysaccharide storage myopathy that can be managed by a fat-supplemented, hay-based diet, and regular daily exercise. In Thoroughbreds recurrent exertional rhabdomyolysis (RER) is often due to a heritable disorder of muscle contractility that is intermittently expressed during stress and excite-ment. RER is best managed by decreasing excitement and nervousness in combination with a diet designed to meet but not exceed caloric requirements. Authors ’ address: Depts. of Clinical an...|$|E
40|$|Exercise related myopathies {{of horses}} have been {{recognized}} by horse owners and veterinarians for more than 100 years. Symptoms ranging from mild alterations in gait and attitude to severe muscle spasm, immobility, and myoglobinuria are common. Exertional myopathy has had many names: azoturia, Monday morning disease, <b>tying-up,</b> cording-up, paralytic myoglobinuria, paralytic hemoglobinuria, exertional rhabdomyolysis, and simply myositis, {{have been used to}} describe it in the literature. Many clinicians feel that azoturia and <b>tying-up</b> represent two different diseases with different etiologies. Most, however, {{have come to believe that}} there is one disease process, more appropriately termed exertional myopathy, with a wide range in severity of clinical signs...|$|E
40|$|PosterAgroforestry systems which combine {{woody plants}} with arable crops and/or {{grassland}} provide ecological {{as well as}} economic benefits. Agroforestry systems are characterised by higher overall productivity {{and at the same time}} they are expected to provide improved resource conservation and contribute to enhanced biodiversity. Whether this potential can be effectively realised and whether or not it is offset by possible drawbacks such as more complicated farm management, long term <b>tying-up</b> of land etc. can only be tested using empirical data. For this purpose, a monitoring tool was developed containing indicators relating to productivity, labour costs, economic viability, management strategies, environmental factors and the perception of those working the land (Kuster et al. 2012). An initial survey was conducted on existing plots of land belonging to three farms and has been repeated annually. The approach will be presented and first experiences from its application will be summarized...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} thesis the {{localization}} and activation of signaling proteins, known from human studies, in equine muscle were investigated {{under conditions of}} rest, after an acute bout of exercise and before and {{after a period of}} (intensified) training. Proteins of interest (protein kinase C (PKC), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and heat shock protein 27 (HSP 27)) were studied using histological and biochemical techniques. PKC isoforms were differentially expressed in muscle fiber types and the subcellular localization at rest was different among PKC isoforms. MAPKs and HSP 27 were differentially activated upon an acute bout of exercise in muscle of horses, whereas a normal or intensified training program did not result in clear long-term adaptations of these signaling proteins. In order to investigate training-induced fiber transitions, MHC content was determined as well. Changes were found in MHC content between muscles. However, training did not induce a change in MHC content which suggests no conversion of muscle fiber types upon training. In addition, {{for the first time in}} horses, proteomic technology was used in rhabdomyolysis and used to elucidate (intensified) training-induced muscle adaptation at the protein level. In cases of acute <b>tying-up,</b> horses expressed an altered form of creatine kinase M chain. Furthermore, the expression level of various proteins changed upon normal or intensified training. From the overall findings of this thesis we hypothesize that, like in human muscle, PKC isoforms, p 38 MAPK, JNK and HSP 27 play a major role in equine muscle cell signaling. Since these proteins are involved in the insulin signaling cascade, the findings emphasize the importance of the equine muscle in glucose homeostasis as well. The similarities between human and equine muscle cell signaling make the horse an excellent model to study biological markers for guiding training and preventing overtraining in humans and horses. Moreover, the application of such markers could increase the welfare of the equine athlete in clinical practice. The unraveling of the equine genome would facilitate the identification of new markers using proteomic technology. Despite the similarities between the human and equine athlete and the way they adapt to training, it remains to be elucidated whether or not other aspects (mental, neuro-endocrine, metabolic) act analogous in the process of developing overtraining...|$|E
