Secondly, the corresponding migration of the XML data is largely induced by <b>the</b> DTD <b>transformations.</b> <b>The</b> presentation focuses on concepts of format evolution, namely roles of corresponding <b>transformations,</b> properties of <b>the</b> <b>transformations,</b> and expressiveness to implement <b>the</b> <b>transformations...</b>|$|R
