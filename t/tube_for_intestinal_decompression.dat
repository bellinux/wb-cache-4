40|$|Objective 　To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} the small <b>intestinal</b> <b>decompression</b> on intra -abdominal hypertension(IAH) in critically ill patients. Methods 　Fourteen IAH patients received small <b>intestinal</b> <b>decompression</b> under the X ray in Navy General Hospital of PLA from August 2013 to August 2015, and the heart rate, mean arterial pressure, breathing rate, abdominal perimeter, urea nitrogen, creatinine, urine output per hour, 24 -h intra-abdominal pressure after decompression, and lactic acid before and after the decompression were examined and recorded. Results 　After decompression all the patients' heart rate, breathing rate, abdominal perimeter, intra-abdominal pressure significantly decreased (P 0. 05). Conclusion 　Transnasal small <b>intestinal</b> <b>decompression</b> is safe and effective for the critically ill patients with intra-abdominal hypertension.

40|$|Stoma {{surgery in}} {{patients}} with obstructive rectal cancer is not a rare case. That is why we studied a possibility of conservative treatment with large bowel obstruction (LBO) using the method of endoscopic recanalization. Material and methods. We enrolled 117 rectal cancer patients with acute or partial LBO. Fifty-eight patients were treated with endoscopic recanalization of lumen. After achieving <b>intestinal</b> <b>decompression,</b> the patients received preoperative chemoradiotherapy (40 – 60 Gy, tegafur 300 mg/м 2, 1 – 28 days) followed by surgery. The control group consisted of 59 patients who were treated with surgery followed by chemoradiotherapy. Results. Decompression was successful in 48 patients (82. 7 %). Partial recanalization was observed in 8 patients, {{but it was not}} obstacle to perform chemoradiotherapy. Two patients developed complications (paracolic abscess), requiring unplanned emergency surgery. The frequency of sphincter-preserving surgical procedures was 82. 6 % in the study group and 28. 8 % in the control group, p< 0. 001. Conclusion. The proposed method of <b>intestinal</b> <b>decompression</b> allowed the number of sphincter-sparing surgery to be increased without worsening the disease prognosis. </p...|$|R

CASE REPORT: We report {{the case of}} an adult male with abdominal pain, constipation and vomiting. This patient underwent surgical separation of adhesions, reduction of torsion and <b>intestinal</b> <b>decompression.</b> Postoperative pathological findings confirmed the rare diagnosis of intestinal duplication. CONCLUSION: Adult intestinal duplication is quite rare. Its clinical manifestations are nonspecific. From this finding of intestinal duplication originating at {{the opposite side of the}} mesenteric margin, a further extension of the existing anatomical classification is proposed...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackgroundThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{clinically}} evaluate a coil tube that we recently designed for bowel decompression in patients with a small bowel obstruction. MethodsThe coil tube was composed of a stainless steel coil, a polyolefin tube, and a rubber adaptor. The tube was inserted under fluoroscopic guidance in 14 consecutive patients with small bowel obstructions. Technical success was defined as insertion of the distal end of the tube into at least the proximal jejunum, and clinical success was defined as <b>intestinal</b> <b>decompression</b> and relief of obstructive symptoms. ResultsThe technical success rate was 100 %. Clinical success was achieved in 12 patients (86 %). The clinical failures were a patient with peritoneal carcinomatosis and an ileocolic fistula, and a patient with bezoars following intestinal hemorrhage. No coil-related complications occurred. ConclusionOur newly designed coil tube was safe and effective in patients with bowel decompression associated with a small bowel obstruction. In addition, our tube has several advantages over other currently used tube types...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the outcomes in candidates and noncandidates <b>for</b> <b>intestinal</b> transplantation, and to compare the outcomes with and without transplant surgery. Patients and methods: The clinical records of children admitted to hospital from 1997 to 2008 because of intestinal failure were reviewed <b>for</b> etiology of <b>intestinal</b> failure, age at start of parenteral nutrition, duration of parenteral nutrition, indications <b>for</b> <b>intestinal</b> transplantation, and outcome. Results: Thirty-four children were enrolled. Median age at start of parenteral nutrition was 13. 1 (median 20. 7) months. There was no difference in survival rate between candidates and noncandidates <b>for</b> <b>intestinal</b> transplantation.

40|$|Objective: This work {{aimed to}} study the safety and {{efficacy}} of preoperative <b>intestinal</b> stent <b>decompression</b> combined with laparoscopic surgery to treat left-sided colorectal cancer with obstruction (LCCO). Methods: Retrospective analysis was conducted on data obtained from 21 LCCO patients admitted to The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medicine University during March 2008 and December 2011. To remove the intestinal obstruction, preoperative intestinal stent placement under colonoscopic guidance was performed. Approximately 7 to 10 days after the operation, laparoscopic radical surgery of colorectal cancer was conducted. Results: Among the 21 cases studied, laparoscopic surgery was successful in 20 patients. Emergent laparotomy was conducted in one patient because of tumor invasion in the ureter. The duration of the operation ranged from 180 to 320 min, and the average time was 220 min. The recovery time for bowel function ranged from 2 to 5 days with an average time of 3 days. Postoperative infection of the incision occurred in one case. No anastomotic leakage was observed {{in any of the}} cases. Conclusion: Preoperative <b>intestinal</b> stent <b>decompression,</b> combined with primary stage laparoscopic surgery, is a safe and effective method for the treatment of LCCO...|$|R
40|$|Transplantation {{using an}} Active Porto-Caval Shunt. J. Vis. Exp. (99), e 52055, doi: 10. 3791 / 52055 (2015). The success of liver {{transplantation}} {{has resulted in}} a dramatic organ shortage. Each year, a considerable number of patients on the liver transplantation waiting list die without receiving an organ transplant or are delisted due to disease progression. Even after a successful transplantation, rejection and side effects of immunosuppression remain major concerns for graft survival and patient morbidity. Experimental animal research has been essential to the success of liver transplantation and still plays a pivotal {{role in the development of}} clinical transplantation practice. In particular, the porcine orthotopic liver transplantation model (OLTx) is optimal for clinically oriented research for its close resemblance to human size, anatomy, and physiology. <b>Decompression</b> of <b>intestinal</b> congestion during the anhepatic phase of porcine OLTx is important to guarantee reliable animal survival. The use of an active porto-caval-jugular shunt achieves excellent <b>intestinal</b> <b>decompression.</b> The system can be used for short-term as well as long-term survival experiments. The following protocol contains all technical information for a stable and reproducible liver transplantation model in pigs including post-operative animal care...|$|R
