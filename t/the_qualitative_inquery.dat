40|$|We {{consider}} {{qualitative and}} quantitative model-checking problems for probabilistic pushdown automata (pPDA) and various temporal logics. We prove that <b>the</b> <b>qualitative</b> and quantitative model-checking problem for ω-regular properties and pPDA is in 2 -EXPSPACE and 3 -EXPTIME, respectively. We also prove that model-checking <b>the</b> <b>qualitative</b> fragment of <b>the</b> logic PECTL ∗ for pPDA is in 2 -EXPSPACE, and model-checking <b>the</b> <b>qualitative</b> fragment of PCTL for pPDA is in EXPSPACE. Furthermore, model-checking <b>the</b> <b>qualitative</b> fragment of PCTL is shown to be EXPTIME-hard even for stateless pPDA. Finally, we show that PCTL model-checking is undecidable for pPDA, and PCTL + model-checking is undecidable even for stateless pPDA...|$|R

40|$|Towards a {{critique}} of the "qualitative method" This article is based on a plenary speech (Sw. Sociological Association) in which several critical remarks were directed against the frequent and popular use of ’qualitative methods’ in contemporary sociology. The various types of remarks were: (1) Is <b>the</b> <b>qualitative</b> method anti-positivistic (2) Does it draw upon a different form of rationality than the quantitative method (3) Is <b>the</b> <b>qualitative</b> method more suitable for women than for men, and finally (4) Is <b>the</b> <b>qualitative</b> method ”deconstructivist” and/or ”postmodern”? The article ends with a critical discussion of which the possible consequences may be for the sociological discipline as such, when <b>the</b> <b>qualitative</b> method (or for that matter, women) come to dominate.

40|$|We {{aimed to}} verify doctor's {{perception}} of <b>the</b> <b>qualitative</b> research method, via a qualitative study {{of interviews with}} questions on the academic profile of doctors and on the methodology. We interviewed 42 professionals, of which 18 had experience with <b>the</b> <b>qualitative</b> method and 24 with the quantitative method. The results showed that knowledge on <b>the</b> <b>qualitative</b> method was virtually nil among "quantitative researchers", who did not value qualitative research, although some of those realized {{that it would be}} important to be more accepting in clinical practice.

40|$|As a {{proxy for}} a Pareto-efficient market economy, we adopt the two-party Nash Bargaining model {{featuring}} a <b>qualitative</b> bias in <b>the</b> treatment of {{the contributions of the}} parties. The Piketty inequality here is the share in total welfare accruing to the richer party over total welfare attained at agreement point. We show that this inequality can never exceed the inequality in initial contributions if <b>the</b> <b>qualitative</b> bias is zero. The rising Piketty inequality requires that <b>the</b> <b>qualitative</b> bias exceed a positive threshold. The Piketty trajectory emerges if <b>the</b> <b>qualitative</b> bias oscillates around the threshold due to changing social and economic environment...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} emerging {{findings from}} an ongoing longitudinal study into poverty dynamics and life trajectories in rural Bangladesh. The study integrates a quantitative panel survey of 1787 core households with a sub-sample of 293 qualitative life history interviews. In this paper, we report findings based on {{two-thirds of the}} study sites (908 households and 184 life history interviews). While both <b>the</b> <b>qualitative</b> and quantitative data shows movements {{into and out of}} poverty, <b>the</b> <b>qualitative</b> data reveal fewer poverty transitions than the quantitative data. Such mismatches appear to be due to the higher, more relative poverty &# 039;line&# 039; used in <b>the</b> <b>qualitative</b> data, together with measurement error and lumpy expenditures in the quantitative data. Individual life trajectories are also shown to be dominated by upward or downward &# 039;saw tooth&# 039; patterns, in which gradual improvements are reversed by periodic crises. Similar opportunities and crises are observed in both <b>the</b> <b>qualitative</b> and quantitative data. Although {{it is not possible to}} reconcile all <b>the</b> <b>qualitative</b> and quantitative findings, we believe an integrated and sequenced approach to the study of poverty dynamics helps to compensate for the blind spots of any single approach, and strengthens the overall research proces...|$|R
