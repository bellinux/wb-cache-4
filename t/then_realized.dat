While developing Frog Fractions, Crawford said that {{he came up with}} a lot of other video game ideas, but he <b>then</b> <b>realized</b> that he could implement them immediately into Frog Fractions rather than start a new project, due to the game's unpredictable nature.|$|E

Although two warships, the frigate Lizard (26 guns) and the sloop-of-war Hunter (16 guns), kept up a constant patrol to prevent a river crossing, Arnold was able to procure sufficient watercraft for his men, and crossed to the Quebec City side on November 11. He <b>then</b> <b>realized</b> his force was {{not strong enough to}} capture the city, so he retreated several miles and waited for Montgomery.|$|E
5|$|Production on {{the game}} started at the {{beginning}} of 2001 with a team of only four programmers. Since Resident Evil was one of Capcom's first titles developed for the GameCube, the development team had to study the system's performance during the first stages of development. Initially, the team considered the possibility of creating the game's environments with computer graphic animation, but <b>then</b> <b>realized</b> that this approach would require too much hardware capacity and processing to achieve realistic graphics. As a result, the graphical style of the remake features 3D models over pre-rendered backgrounds like the Resident Evil games for the PlayStation. Despite this, the camera is more dynamic and can track the player at varying angles. The backgrounds also make use of particle effects and full motion video layers to simulate effects such as rushing water or swaying tree branches. Causing fear to the player was a high priority, and many of the game's backgrounds were designed to have a high contrast between dark and light so that enemies could appear unexpectedly.|$|E

5|$|Austen met, danced with, {{and perhaps}} {{fell in love}} with Thomas Lefroy during the Christmas {{holidays}} in 1795. However, Lefroy departed to begin his law studies in January 1796 and he and Jane never saw each other again. Samuel Blackall, a Fellow of Emmanuel College, Cambridge, and a friend of Mrs. Anne Lefroy, was seriously interested in marrying Austen in 1797. Austen family tradition holds that Jane and an unnamed young clergyman fell in love while the Austen family visited the seaside at Sidmouth in the summer of 1801. Cassandra is said to have approved of this young man, but he died unexpectedly several months later, before he and Jane could be together again. Austen received her only proposal of marriage from Harris Bigg-Wither, brother of her friends Alethea, Elizabeth and Catherine Bigg, while visiting them at their home in December 1802. Austen at first accepted the proposal, <b>then</b> <b>realized</b> she had made a mistake and withdrew her acceptance the next day. Austen biographer Park Honan suggests that Jane may have received a proposal of marriage from Edward Bridges, a brother of Edward Austen's wife Elizabeth, in 1805, but biographer Claire Tomalin dismisses this claim.|$|E

A few hours later all three of Grant's corps pushed forward but were again met with heavy resistance, suffering heavy losses from Lieutenant General Pemberton's troops. Grant <b>then</b> <b>realized</b> Vicksburg could not be taken by storm, so resolved to take Vicksburg by siege while reinforcements poured in from Memphis, swelling his troop strength to over 80,000.|$|E

On that, the centre again refused to listen and instructed him to take resident position in the Kabul residency by 1974. On 30 April 1978, Taraki, despite being cut off from any support, led the coup which later became known as April Revolution, and became the country's President, along with Hafizullah Amin being Deputy-Prime Minister and Vice-President. On 5 December of that same year, Taraki compared the April Revolt to the Russian Revolution, which struck Vladimir Kryuchkov, the FCD chief of that time.|$|E

25|$|In {{an effort}} to {{bootstrap}} the GNU operating system, Richard Stallman asked Andrew S. Tanenbaum, {{the author of the}} Amsterdam Compiler Kit (also known as the Free University Compiler Kit) if he could use that software for GNU. When Tanenbaum told him that while the Free University was free, the compiler was not, Stallman decided to write his own. Stallman's initial plan was to rewrite an existing compiler from Lawrence Livermore Laboratory from Pastel to C with some help from Len Tower and others. Stallman wrote a new C front end for the Livermore compiler, but <b>then</b> <b>realized</b> that it required megabytes of stack space, an impossibility on a 68000 Unix system with only 64KB, and concluded he would have to write a new compiler from scratch. None of the Pastel compiler code ended up in GCC, though Stallman did use the C front end he had written.|$|E
25|$|During the screening, {{people began}} walking out; Goodman thought {{the film was}} bombing, until {{he learned that the}} viewers were {{actually}} leaving because they were so frightened. He <b>then</b> <b>realized</b> a remake was unwise. Paramount Pictures, which acquired DreamWorks in 2005, bought the domestic rights to the film, and worldwide rights to any sequels, for USD$350,000. When the film was taken in by Paramount, several changes were made. Some scenes were cut, others added, and the original ending was scrapped, with two new endings being shot. The ending shown in theaters during the film's worldwide release {{is the only one of}} the three to feature visual effects, and it differs from the endings previously seen at the Screamfest and Burbank screenings. The theatrical release was delayed indefinitely because Paramount had put all DreamWorks productions on hold. Meanwhile, a screening for international buyers resulted in the sale of international rights in 52 countries. Only after Goodman became production chief at Paramount in June 2009 did the film finally get slated for a fall release.|$|E
