5|$|Although {{only one}} bomb fell on <b>the</b> <b>Tower</b> <b>of</b> London in the First World War (it landed harmlessly in the moat), the Second World War left a greater mark. On 23 September 1940, during the Blitz, high-explosive bombs damaged the castle, {{destroying}} several buildings and narrowly missing the White Tower. After the war, {{the damage was}} repaired and <b>the</b> <b>Tower</b> <b>of</b> London was reopened to the public.|$|E

5|$|He spent £58,000 on {{his royal}} castles, {{carrying}} out major works at <b>the</b> <b>Tower</b> <b>of</b> London, Lincoln and Dover. Both the military defences {{and the internal}} accommodation of these castles were significantly improved. At Windsor, a huge overhaul of the castle produced a lavish palace complex, whose style and detail inspired many subsequent designs in England and Wales. <b>The</b> <b>Tower</b> <b>of</b> London was extended to form a concentric fortress with extensive living quarters, although Henry primarily used the castle as a secure retreat {{in the event of}} war or civil strife. Henry also kept a menagerie at the Tower, a tradition begun by his father, and his exotic specimens included an elephant, a leopard and a camel.|$|E

5|$|Since 1990, <b>the</b> <b>Tower</b> <b>of</b> London {{has been}} {{cared for by}} an {{independent}} charity, Historic Royal Palaces, which receives no funding from the Government or the Crown. In 1988, <b>the</b> <b>Tower</b> <b>of</b> London {{was added to the}} UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites, in recognition of its global importance and to help conserve and protect the site. However, recent developments, such as the construction of skyscrapers nearby, have pushed the Tower towards being added to the United Nations' Heritage in Danger List. The remains of the medieval palace have been open to the public since 2006. Visitors can explore the chambers restored to their former glory, once used by past kings and queens. Although the position of Constable of the Tower remains the highest position held at the Tower, the responsibility of day-to-day administration is delegated to the Resident Governor. At least six ravens are kept at the Tower at all times, in accordance with the belief that if they are absent, the kingdom will fall. They are under the care of the Yeomen Warders. The earliest known reference to a Tower raven is a picture from 1883. As well as having ceremonial duties, the Yeoman Warders provide guided tours around the Tower. Just over 2.7 million people visited <b>the</b> <b>Tower</b> <b>of</b> London in 2016.|$|E

5|$|When RichardII was crowned in 1377, {{he led a}} {{procession}} from the Tower to Westminster Abbey. This tradition began in at least the early 14thcentury and lasted until 1660. During the Peasants' Revolt of 1381 <b>the</b> <b>Tower</b> <b>of</b> London was besieged with the King inside. When Richard rode out to meet with Wat Tyler, the rebel leader, a crowd broke into the castle without meeting resistance and looted the Jewel House. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Simon Sudbury, took refuge in StJohn's Chapel, hoping the mob would respect the sanctuary. However, he was taken away and beheaded on Tower Hill. Six years later there was again civil unrest, and Richard spent Christmas in {{the security of the}} Tower rather than Windsor as was more usual. When Henry Bolingbroke returned from exile in 1399, Richard was imprisoned in the White Tower. He abdicated and was replaced on the throne by Bolingbroke, who became King HenryIV. In the 15thcentury, there was little building work at <b>the</b> <b>Tower</b> <b>of</b> London, yet the castle still remained important as a place of refuge. When supporters of the late RichardII attempted a coup, HenryIV found safety in <b>the</b> <b>Tower</b> <b>of</b> London. During this period, the castle also held many distinguished prisoners. The heir to the Scottish throne, later King James I of Scotland, was kidnapped while journeying to France in 1406 and held in the Tower. The reign of HenryV (1413–1422) renewed England's fortune in the Hundred Years' War against France. As a result of Henry's victories, such as the Battle of Agincourt, many high-status prisoners were held in <b>the</b> <b>Tower</b> <b>of</b> London until they were ransomed.|$|E

5|$|A legend {{developed}} that England would not fall {{to a foreign}} invader {{as long as there}} were ravens at <b>the</b> <b>Tower</b> <b>of</b> London; although this is often thought to be an ancient belief, the official Tower of London historian, Geoff Parnell, believes that this is actually a romantic Victorian invention.|$|E

5|$|After {{winning the}} Battle of Hastings, William, Duke of Normandy was crowned King of England {{in the newly}} {{completed}} Westminster Abbey on Christmas Day 1066. William constructed <b>the</b> <b>Tower</b> <b>of</b> London, {{the first of the}} many Norman castles in England to be rebuilt in stone, in the southeastern corner of the city, to intimidate the native inhabitants. In 1097, William II began the building of Westminster Hall, close by the abbey of the same name. The hall became the basis of a new Palace of Westminster.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{was rarely}} in London, EdwardI {{undertook}} an expensive remodelling of the Tower, costing £21,000 between 1275 and 1285, over double that {{spent on the}} castle during the whole of HenryIII's reign. EdwardI was a seasoned castle builder, and used his experience of siege warfare during the crusades to bring innovations to castle building. His programme of castle building in Wales heralded {{the introduction of the}} widespread use of arrowslits in castle walls across Europe, drawing on Eastern influences. At <b>the</b> <b>Tower</b> <b>of</b> London, Edward filled in the moat dug by HenryIII and built a new curtain wall along its line, creating a new enclosure. A new moat was created in front of the new curtain wall. The western part of HenryIII's curtain wall was rebuilt, with Beauchamp Tower replacing the castle's old gatehouse. A new entrance was created, with elaborate defences including two gatehouses and a barbican. In an effort to make the castle self-sufficient, EdwardI also added two watermills. Six hundred Jews were imprisoned in <b>the</b> <b>Tower</b> <b>of</b> London in 1278, charged with coin clipping. Persecution of the country's Jewish population under Edward began in 1276 and culminated in 1290 when he issued the Edict of Expulsion, forcing the Jews out of the country.|$|E
5|$|As part of {{his efforts}} to secure England, William ordered many castles, keeps, and mottes built– among them the central keep of <b>the</b> <b>Tower</b> <b>of</b> London, the White Tower. These fortifications allowed Normans to retreat into safety when {{threatened}} with rebellion and allowed garrisons to be protected while they occupied the countryside. The early castles were simple earth and timber constructions, later replaced with stone structures.|$|E
