5|$|An {{appeal for}} holiday {{pictures}} and postcards of Europe announced on the BBC produced over ten million items, {{some of which}} proved useful.

5|$|During the Boer War, the {{importance}} of coordinating <b>troop</b> <b>movements</b> and synchronizing attacks against the highly mobile Boer insurgents was paramount, {{and the use of}} wristwatches subsequently became widespread among the officer class. The company Mappin & Webb began production of their successful 'campaign watch' for soldiers during the campaign at the Sudan in 1898 and ramped up production for the Boer War a few years later.|$|E

5|$|In December 1943, the LRDG re-organised {{into two}} squadrons of eight patrols. Each patrol {{contained}} one officer and 10 other ranks. Major Moir Stormonth Darling was given {{command of the}} British Squadron and Major Kenneth Henry Lazarus the Rhodesian Squadron. Patrols were then parachuted north of Rome to obtain information about German <b>troop</b> <b>movements,</b> and also carried out raids on the Dalmatian Islands and Corfu.|$|E
5|$|A March 1779 {{letter from}} Washington to Scott, still on {{furlough}} in Virginia, {{ordered him to}} recruit volunteers in Virginia and join Washington at Middlebrook on May 1. Men and supplies proved difficult to obtain, delaying Scott's return; during the delay, Washington ordered the recruits to South Carolina to join Benjamin Lincoln, who was {{in command of the}} militia forces there. Reports of significant British <b>troop</b> <b>movements</b> toward Georgia had convinced Washington that the enemy was preparing an invasion from the south.|$|E
5|$|After the {{surrender}} of Japan {{at the end of}} World War II, the Kuomintang government revealed that Tang Shengming and Xu Lai had been sent by Dai Li to serve as secret agents in the Wang Jingwei regime. The couple took great personal risks to obtain intelligence about Japanese spies and <b>troop</b> <b>movements</b> and pass it to the resistance. Xu Lai reportedly discovered the identity of a Japanese spy while playing mahjong with Zhou Fohai's wife, and personally delivered messages to Chinese agents in Shanghai in urgent situations.|$|E

5|$|Didsbury {{was one of}} the {{few places}} between Stretford and Stockport where the River Mersey could be forded, which made it {{significant}} for <b>troop</b> <b>movements</b> during the English Civil War, in which Manchester was on the Parliamentarian side. The Royalist commander, Prince Rupert, stationed himself at Didsbury Ees, to the south of Barlow Moor. It is also likely that Bonnie Prince Charlie crossed the Mersey at Didsbury in 1745, in the Jacobite march south from Manchester to Derby, and again in his subsequent retreat.|$|E
5|$|In particular, {{intelligence}} gathering {{played a major}} role. Around 6,000 Belgian civilians were involved in gathering intelligence on German military installations and <b>troop</b> <b>movements</b> and communicating {{it back to the}} Allied armies. The organization was run through a large number of independent groups and included, notably, the large Dame Blanche (White Lady) network. Alongside {{intelligence gathering}} were similar organisations which helped men wishing to join the Belgian Army on the Yser Front escape occupied Belgium, usually to the neutral Netherlands. Around 32,000 were successfully smuggled out which boosted the size of the Belgian force considerably.|$|E

On August 15, {{he received a}} coded letter from André with Clinton's final offer: £20,000 and no indemnification for his losses. Neither side knew for some days that the other was in agreement with that offer, due to difficulties in getting the messages across the lines. Arnold's letters continued to detail Washington's <b>troop</b> <b>movements</b> and provide information about French reinforcements that were being organized. On August 25, Peggy finally delivered to him Clinton's agreement to the terms.|$|E

5|$|The Sri Lankan {{military}} began attacking Kilinochchi {{from three}} directions on 23 November 2008.

Heavy monsoon rains affected both sides during the months of November and December, with floods covering a large area in and around Kilinochchi. <b>Troop</b> <b>movements</b> were limited by this, and mines had been scattered around the area by the flood waters. Throughout the offensive, the Sri Lanka Air Force carried out numerous air strikes against Kilinochchi in support of the SLA.|$|E

5|$|The {{debate over}} the {{proposed}} national constitution became moot when news of Italian <b>troop</b> <b>movements</b> in Tyrol and near the Venetian border reached Vienna in April 1866. The Austrian government ordered partial mobilization in the southern regions; the Italians responded by ordering full mobilization. Despite calls for rational thought and action, Italy, Prussia, and Austria continued to rush toward armed conflict. On 1 May, Wilhelm gave von Moltke command over the Prussian armed forces, {{and the next day}} he began full-scale mobilization.|$|E
5|$|When an {{infected}} person sneezes or coughs, {{more than half}} a million virus particles can be spread to those close by. The close quarters and massive <b>troop</b> <b>movements</b> of World War I hastened the pandemic, and probably both increased transmission and augmented mutation; the war may also have increased the lethality of the virus. Some speculate the soldiers' immune systems were weakened by malnourishment, as well as the stresses of combat and chemical attacks, increasing their susceptibility.|$|E

Nearly 600 messages were sent through agents, who were used extensively and at considerable risk of exposure.

The Gasmata party was discovered by the Japanese while en route to its destination and eliminated, but the other teams were in place by the end of October.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the success}} of the Chinese First Phase Campaign, the UN {{planners}} still believed that China had not intervened in Korea on a large scale. The suddenness of the Chinese withdrawal {{in the face of a}} victory further reinforced this belief. Working on the assumption that only 30,000 Chinese troops could remain hidden in the hills, General Douglas MacArthur ordered the bombing of the bridges over the Yalu River in an effort to cut off Chinese reinforcements. Confident that the UN air force could detect and disrupt any <b>troop</b> <b>movements</b> across the Yalu River, MacArthur launched the Home-by-Christmas Offensive on November 24 to rout the remaining Chinese and North Korean forces and to end the Korean War.|$|E
5|$|Following this {{successful}} demonstration, Tarrare became employed officially {{as a spy}} of the Army of the Rhine. Although General deBeauharnais {{was convinced}} of Tarrare's physical capacity to carry messages internally, {{he was concerned about}} his mental state and reluctant to entrust him initially with significant military documents. Tarrare was ordered as his first assignment to carry a message to a French colonel imprisoned by the Prussians near Neustadt; he was told that the documents were of great military significance, but in reality deBeauharnais had merely written a note asking the colonel to confirm that the message had been received successfully, and if so to return a reply of any potentially useful information about Prussian <b>troop</b> <b>movements.</b>|$|E
