50|$|It {{has been}} shown that leaving {{comments}} alongside grades is just as ineffective as giving solely a numerical/letter grade (Butler 1987, 1989). This {{is due to the fact}} that students tend to look at <b>their</b> <b>grade</b> and disregard any comments that are given to them. The next thing students tend to do is to ask other students in the class for <b>their</b> <b>grade,</b> and they compare the <b>grade</b> to <b>their</b> own <b>grade.</b>|$|R

25|$|There is some pre-primary {{education}} for children aged 4 to 6 years but provision is patchy. Primary school education has two cycles from age 7 to 10 years (grades 1 to 4) and from age 11 to 14 years (grades 5 to 8).

Secondary education has two cycles from age 15 to 16 years (grades 9 and 10) and from age 17 to 18 years (grades 11 to 12) leading up to the national exams. The Ethiopian General Secondary Education Certificate Examination (EGSECE) is taken {{at the end of}} grade 10 and requires a pass in at least 5 subjects to pass to the next level.

25|$|In 2004, Nancy Weiss Malkiel, the Dean of the College, {{implemented}} a grade deflation policy {{to curb the}} number of A-range grades undergraduates received. Malkiel's argument was that an A was beginning to lose its meaning as {{a larger percentage of}} the student body received them. While the number of A's has indeed decreased under the policy, many argue that this is hurting Princeton students when they apply to jobs or graduate school. Malkiel has said that she sent pamphlets to inform institutions about the policy so that they consider Princeton students equally, but students argue that Princeton graduates can apply to other institutions that know nothing about it. They argue further that as other schools purposefully inflate <b>their</b> <b>grades,</b> Princeton students' GPAs will look low by comparison. Further, studies have shown that employers prefer high grades even when they are inflated. The policy remained in place even after Malkiel stepped {{down at the end of}} the 2010–2011 academic term. The policy deflates grades only relative to their previous levels; indeed, as of 2009, or five years after the policy was instituted, the average graduating GPA saw a marginal decrease, from 3.46 to 3.39.|$|E

2500|$|With {{the growing}} number of {{international}} business, military placements, and immigration there has been a growing number of TCKs.

This would create an effective and optimal environment for their learning and adjusting abilities.
