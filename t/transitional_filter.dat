40|$|A new {{approximation}} {{to design}} continuoustime and discrete-time low-pass filters, {{presented in this}} paper, based on the product of Gegenbauer polynomials, provides the ability of more flexible adjustment of passband and stopband responses. The design is achieved taking into account a prescribed specification, leading to a better trade-off among the magnitude and group delay responses. Many well-known continuous-time and discrete-time <b>transitional</b> <b>filter</b> based on the classical polynomial approximations(Chebyshev, Legendre, Butterworth) are {{shown to be a}} special cases of proposed approximation method...|$|E
40|$|The TCC (Transitional-Chebyshev-Chebyshev) -filter are {{examined}} in some detail. Closed-form expressions for pole-locations are obtained, where possible. In cases {{where it is}} not possible, algorithms or geometrical iterative methods have been enunciated {{in order to determine}} the pole-locations. Performance indices for certain low-order <b>transitional</b> <b>filters</b> have been computed and tabulated. These clearly illustrate the transitional nature of these filters...|$|R

40|$|It is wen {{known that}} the poles of a Butterworth filter (BF) are uniformly placed on the unit circle in the s-plane. If {{the order of the}} filter is a binary power (i. e., n = 2 (k), k being an integer), then the pole-locations of such Butterworth filters exhibit very {{interesting}} symmetry properties in the s-plane. In this paper, first we point out that the pole-vectors of the Butterworth filters (of order n = 2 (k)) can be subjected to ''prescribed symmetrical swinging'', such that certain symmetry properties present in the original pole-pattern can be maintained invariant. Then, we introduce a new family of filters called ''Complementary Pole-Pair Filters (CPPFs) '', generated by judiciously exploiting the symmetry-invariant property referred to above. The Q-constraint can be easily incorporated into the design considerations of the new family of filters; accordingly, the CPPFs are classified as Low-Q filters (LQFs) and High-Q Filters (HQFs). Performances of LQFs and HQFs are analyzed and compared with that of the generic Butterworth filter. Also, the possibility of generating additional <b>transitional</b> <b>filters</b> is indicated. Design constraints are derived. Numerical examples are worked out for illustrations. A new transformation referred to as the ''Pore-Parameter Transformation (PPT) '', which modifies the pole-parameters of a given reference filter to obtain a low-Q(p) filter, but with increased order of complexity, is formulated. This enables us to generate new families of <b>Transitional</b> <b>Filters.</b> The <b>transitional</b> nature involved between Butterworth and Chebyshev filters is brought out. The performance of new filters obtained are compared with those available in the literature. The CPP Filters coupled with the PPT provide a basis for generating a large family of <b>transitional</b> <b>filters,</b> and serves to commendably place the known classical filters as particular members of a large general family...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} pole parameter analysis (PPA) as {{a novel approach}} {{useful in}} obtaining the realisable transfer functions to meet the prescribed specifications of a filter. Analytical expressions are obtained for the design parameters and performance indices, in terms of pole parameters omega(p) and theta(p) that are introduced {{as the basis of}} PPA. Details have been given for the second order case and extensions to higher order filters are indicated. Perspectives obtained through this approach indicate the possibilities of generating new families of <b>transitional</b> <b>filters.</b> A practically useful class of higher order filters which make use of (second order) identical section filters (ISFs) in cascade is studied in detail. ISFs are also desirable in limiting the component-spread in the fabrication using IC technology. The elegant manner in which the effect of component-spread can be incorporated at the design stages using the PPA approach is a so discussed...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedExpressions for a generalized Modified <b>Transitional</b> Butterworth-Chebyshev (MTBC) <b>filter</b> are derived. The characteristics of this filter {{as applied to}} digital filter design are investigated. It is shown that by adjusting location and order of the inserted zeros, the cut-off slope rate of the filter can be traded for maximum attenuation in the stop-band. The performance of this MTBC filter is {{compared to that of}} Butterworth, Chebyshev, <b>transitional</b> Butterworth-Chebyshev <b>filters</b> together with those suggested by other investigators [1]-[3]. It is shown that the stop-band attenuation can be significantly increased without great sacrifice of cut-off slope rate. Step response of this MTBC filter is also obtained and compared with other filters. Various tabulations as well as graphs of this filter are given for design purposes. A computer program is developed for the design of this filter. [URL] Turkish Nav...|$|R
