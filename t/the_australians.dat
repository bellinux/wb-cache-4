5|$|At Sunderland, 11, 12 August. <b>The</b> <b>Australians</b> (282) drew with Durham (73/5).|$|E
5|$|Authors and {{military}} analysts {{have speculated that}} had Kingsbury not attacked, the Japanese might have destroyed the battalion. The Japanese had been attacking in waves, and had started to climb a steep hill to outflank <b>the</b> <b>Australians,</b> {{in an effort to}} win the battle. <b>The</b> <b>Australians</b> were low on supplies and the Japanese {{were on the verge of}} breaking through the Australian line. Had they broken through, they would have been able to isolate the battalion's headquarters from the soldiers on the flanks. This would have prevented <b>the</b> <b>Australians</b> from retreating to Alola, allowing the Japanese to overrun them.|$|E
5|$|By 5 December, <b>the</b> <b>Australians</b> {{had managed}} to {{stockpile}} enough supplies in forward areas to enable the 2/24th Infantry Battalion, which had been engaged in moving the stores, {{to be released from}} this task and thrown back into the fighting. In order to bypass the Japanese position, elements from the 2/23rd along with one company from the 2/24th carried out flanking manoeuvres {{to the west of the}} track were undertaken before <b>the</b> <b>Australians</b> established themselves in defensive positions short of Peak Hill. On 6 December, the remaining three companies of the 2/24th came up and as <b>the</b> <b>Australians</b> continued to advance towards Peak Hill they found considerable Japanese positions which had been abandoned. As movement was seen in Wareo, which was visible in the distance, an artillery bombardment was called in by <b>the</b> <b>Australians.</b> In the afternoon, <b>the</b> <b>Australians</b> cut the branch track that turned towards Kwatingkoo before an attack was put in on Peak Hill. The Japanese defences held and the attack beaten off, <b>the</b> <b>Australians</b> attempted to outflank to the north but they were prevented from doing so by the thick jungle and as the sun set, they had to be content to dig-in on the western approach to Peak Hill.|$|E

5|$|Casualties {{during the}} {{fighting}} around Isurava have been variously reported. In the immediate post war era, Australian sources tended {{to report a}} ratio of around five Japanese killed for every one Australian, with <b>the</b> <b>Australians</b> estimating that they had killed around 700 Japanese; however, in recent times this has been revised. The Japanese also initially over-estimated the casualties they inflicted on <b>the</b> <b>Australians,</b> claiming 1,000 killed, before reducing this to 300. It is now thought that the casualties were more even, although still favouring <b>the</b> <b>Australians.</b> For <b>the</b> <b>Australians,</b> casualties are now reported as 99 killed and 111 wounded while the Japanese {{are thought to have}} lost 140 killed and 231 wounded.|$|E
5|$|Making slow going amidst {{considerable}} resistance, <b>the</b> <b>Australians</b> nevertheless reached KB Mission {{late in the}} day. A {{force of}} Japanese remained there, and <b>the</b> <b>Australians</b> attacked with bayonets fixed. In the fighting that followed 60 Japanese were killed or wounded. <b>The</b> <b>Australians</b> were then able to firmly establish themselves at the mission. Meanwhile, the two companies from the 9th Battalion took up positions at Kilarbo and between the Gama River and Homo Creek with orders to establish blocking positions to allow the 2/12th to continue its advance the following morning.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Australians</b> seized {{their good}} fortune and set their fastest time to date with 11.0seconds (s). Having been beaten twice after leading out, <b>the</b> <b>Australians</b> sat back before {{sweeping}} past the Germans and Americans {{in the final}} lap. Australia were again drawn against South Africa in their quarter-final, who had defeated them easily in the heats. This time they equalled the fastest team in the competition over the final 200m, clocking 10.8s to progress to the final, where they faced the Italy. Giuseppe Ogna and Cesare Pinarello {{appeared to be in}} control {{at the start of the}} final lap. They had moved alongside <b>the</b> <b>Australians</b> with one and a half laps to go, but <b>the</b> <b>Australians</b> surprised them at the start of the final lap. The Italians came back to pull level at the start of the back straight, but <b>the</b> <b>Australians</b> held them off and pulled away to win by a length and a half. The Italians lodged a protest for interference but it was dismissed. <b>The</b> <b>Australians</b> finished in a time of 10.8s and Browne later claimed that he was convinced by the performance that they would win the gold medal.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Porton Plantation {{ended in}} defeat for <b>the</b> <b>Australians,</b> as the landing was repulsed and the Japanese {{remained}} {{in possession of}} the beachhead. Amidst a campaign where largely <b>the</b> <b>Australians</b> dominated – {{it was the only}} defeat – the battle represented a shift in momentum in the northern sector, which was in part due to the shift in resources south, a fact which continued to impact Australian operations in the sector {{until the end of the}} war. During the course of the landing and the subsequent withdrawal, <b>the</b> <b>Australians</b> suffered 23 killed or missing, presumed dead, and 106 wounded, while the Japanese lost 26 killed. Both sides seem to have overestimated the casualties that they inflicted, with <b>the</b> <b>Australians</b> believing that they had killed between 147 and 197 Japanese, and the Japanese estimating Australian losses to have been around 60 killed and 100 wounded.|$|E
5|$|A {{month after}} disappearing the Viet Cong 274th Regiment had emerged without warning and had caught 7 RAR by surprise, with the {{unexpected}} {{presence of a}} Viet Cong Main Force regiment in the Hat Dich forcing <b>the</b> <b>Australians</b> to change their tactics {{for the remainder of}} Operation Ballarat. <b>The</b> <b>Australians</b> became more cautious as a result and while 7 RAR continued its search and destroy mission, only two companies patrolled while the other two remained on standby in fire support bases nearby to provide support if required. Additional artillery support was also made available, with 161st Field Battery, Royal New Zealand Artillery airlifted into Fire Support Base Giraffe. Meanwhile, Graham placed 2 RAR on standby to fly into the area if needed and US forces were also positioned to the north. In this manner Ballarat continued until 16 August, however there was only minor contact which resulted in two more Viet Cong killed, two wounded and one captured for no further loss to <b>the</b> <b>Australians.</b>|$|E
5|$|An {{innings of}} 60 by Lord Harris helped Kent {{recover from a}} first innings deficit before <b>the</b> <b>Australians,</b> batting last, {{collapsed}} to lose by 96 runs at Canterbury. The first match against Gloucestershire was drawn, W. G. Grace scoring 116 not out for his county. <b>The</b> <b>Australians</b> won the second match convincingly with an innings total of 402 (Giffen 91, Billy Murdoch 89) before dismissing Gloucestershire for only 83. This began a good finish to the tour as <b>the</b> <b>Australians</b> won five of the last seven matches following the third Test. They twice defeated the South by an innings, Spofforth taking a total of 24 wickets in these two matches, but were again beaten by the North, for whom Dick Barlow scored a century and took ten wickets in the match.|$|E

5|$|At 19:00 that evening, {{following}} the clearance of nearby Pakchon by D Company 3 RAR, <b>the</b> <b>Australians</b> sent two companies {{across the river}} to establish a bridgehead and prevent the North Koreans from consolidating their position on the western bank. A and B Companies subsequently established defensive positions {{on either side of}} the road. Shortly afterwards North Korean forces were detected forming up for an assault on the right flank against B Company, and these preparations were broken up with mortars. The North Koreans then engaged the forward Australian companies with mortar fire which was largely ineffective. However, by 22:30 North Korean activity increased significantly, with heavy small arms fire causing a number of casualties among <b>the</b> <b>Australians</b> which perilously had to be evacuated under fire by boat across the fast flowing tidal river. Further artillery support was called-in by <b>the</b> <b>Australians</b> at 23:00 in response to renewed concentrations by the North Koreans in preparation for an assault. Meanwhile, <b>the</b> <b>Australians</b> sent another platoon across the river to reinforce the companies on the western bank.|$|E
