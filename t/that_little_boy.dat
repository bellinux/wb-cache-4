2500|$|In {{an episode}} of The Simpsons, Abe Simpson listens to a parody of Paul Harvey's radio {{commentary}} [...] "The Rest of the Story," [...] which dealt with famous people in history whose lives took unexpected turns. Simpson hears: [...] "And <b>that</b> <b>little</b> <b>boy</b> whom nobody liked ... {{grew up to be}} ... Roy Cohn." [...] Frugal expert Chuck Garabedian claims his suit was cheap because [...] "Roy Cohn died in it".|$|E
2500|$|Spitz {{was born}} in Modesto, California, {{the first of three}} {{children}} of Lenore Sylvia (Smith) and Arnold Spitz. His family is Jewish; his father's family was from Hungary and his mother's, originally surnamed [...] "Sklotkovick", were from Russia. When he was two years old, Spitz's family moved to Honolulu, Hawaii, where he swam at Waikiki beach every day. [...] "You should have seen <b>that</b> <b>little</b> <b>boy</b> dash into the ocean. He'd run like he was trying to commit suicide," [...] Lenore Spitz told a reporter for Time in 1968. At age six, his family returned to Sacramento, California, and he began to compete at his local swim club. At age nine, he was training at Arden Hills Swim Club in Sacramento with swimming coach Sherm Chavoor, who mentored seven Olympic medal winners including Spitz.|$|E
2500|$|When UK pop/R group Rixton {{were asked}} which bands they had {{looked up to}} when they were younger, Jake Roche said [...] "I listened {{to a lot of}} McFly when I was growing up. I was a part of that era." [...] He {{continued}} [...] "these guys came out with instruments and they played and wrote all their own stuff and I was like, that's great – [...] I want to do that." [...] Band member Charley Bagnall agreed, saying [...] "McFly was a huge part of my life." [...] Roche's mother, English singer and TV presenter Coleen Nolan, said [...] "To me he's still <b>that</b> <b>little</b> <b>boy</b> I watched singing and dancing around to McFly records...I took him to their show in Manchester when he was nine or 10 and he said to me, 'Mum, one day that will be me up there.'" [...] Other acts to cite McFly as musical influences include R5.|$|E
60|$|I {{asked her}} to explain her meaning, but she only said <b>that</b> <b>little</b> <b>boys</b> couldn't {{understand}} those things.|$|R
60|$|They {{both went}} {{away with a}} {{qualified}} joy: That coward, Old PAUL, chose a very small boy, And {{when no one was}} looking, in spite of his fears, He set to work boxing <b>that</b> <b>little</b> <b>boy's</b> ears.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Strike him how you like, sir,' {{interrupted}} Squeers, 'only hit {{him hard}} enough, that's all--and with that, I'll say good-morning. Here!--just chuck <b>that</b> <b>little</b> <b>boy's</b> hat off <b>that</b> corner peg, and lift {{him off the}} stool will you?' ...|$|R
2500|$|Kevin Harvick {{dominated}} {{the race to}} score the victory. [...] "Wow. I guess that's {{what it feels like}} to hit a walkoff in extra innings. I mean this thing -- both races here -- has been bad to the bone," [...] Harvick said after winning his fourth race at this 1-mile oval in the last five tries. Harvick would not have made the final four to race for the title without a win. I could tell that we were going to have to win because everybody was running in the front of the pack that we were racing against. I think this says a lot about our team. We had our backs against the wall. We're in victory lane and we get to go on." [...] In the final turn, Ryan Newman sent Kyle Larson into the wall to secure his place in the championship race. “I just gave it my all,” Newman said. “I wasn’t proud of it but did what I had to get to this next round. <b>That</b> <b>little</b> <b>boy</b> has got a lot of things coming in this sport and he used me up like that in a truck at Eldora a couple years ago. From my standpoint, I call it even but I think if he was in my position, he’d have done the same thing.” [...] "Coming to the finish, there were a lot of cars racing really hard,” said Larson today. “I knew (Newman) was right around me and knew he needed to gain some spots to keep from getting eliminated from the Chase. It's a little upsetting he pushed me up to the wall, but I completely understand the situation he was in,” said Larson, “(I) can't fault him for being aggressive there. I think a lot of drivers out here would have done something similar if they were in that position." [...] Kevin Harvick (with the much-needed win), Joey Logano, Denny Hamlin, and Ryan Newman were the four drivers who will race for the championship, which also meant that NASCAR will be having a new Sprint Cup Series champion. Jeff Gordon, Carl Edwards, Brad Keselowski, and Matt Kenseth were the four drivers eliminated.|$|E
60|$|Duncan Campbell. Why, at <b>that</b> <b>little</b> <b>boy</b> {{that goes}} along with the lamb I speak of, and it was then he made me the appointment.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I don't, sir; and I'm sure <b>that</b> <b>little</b> <b>boy</b> wasn't such a fool as to {{lose the}} money. He minded his grandma's wishes, and kept it all." ...|$|E
60|$|So what wonder <b>that</b> the <b>little</b> <b>boy</b> {{was quite}} {{at a loss}} to guess the meaning of these strange figures.|$|R
60|$|Jims {{tried the}} door of the blue room. Yes, it was locked. He had hoped Aunt Augusta might have {{forgotten}} to lock it; but when did Aunt Augusta forget anything? Except, perhaps, <b>that</b> <b>little</b> <b>boys</b> were not born grown-ups--and that was something she never remembered. To be sure, she was only a half-aunt. Whole aunts probably had more convenient memories.|$|R
6000|$|... 'If I saw <b>that</b> poor <b>little</b> <b>boy,</b> Aunt Jo, I'd {{love him}} lots!' said Freddy, {{with a world}} of pity in his {{beautiful}} child's eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear," [...] said Mrs McTougall {{one evening}} to the doctor, [...] "since <b>that</b> <b>little</b> <b>boy</b> Slidder {{came to stay}} with us things have become worse and worse; in fact, the house is almost unbearable." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{seem to see}} {{the figure}} of <b>that</b> <b>little</b> <b>boy,</b> drawn and repelled. And {{it was very clear}} in his mind, too, though why it should be so was never explained, that his father would be very angry if he went in through that door.|$|E
60|$|The Squire's daughter, {{hearing the}} angry tones of her father's voice, now {{came out to}} see what was amiss, and when she heard <b>that</b> <b>Little</b> <b>Boy</b> Blue had failed in his trust she was deeply grieved, for she had loved the child for his pretty ways.|$|E
6000|$|... 'My poor, dear brother! Well, it ought, you know. Indeed {{it would}} {{if it had}} not been for <b>that</b> dear <b>little</b> <b>boy.</b> My poor Herbert!' ...|$|R
60|$|Here Mr. Weller, whose {{feelings}} {{were in a}} perpetual conflict between pride in his grandson's achievements {{and a sense of}} his own responsibility, and the importance of impressing him with moral truths, burst into a fit of laughter, and suddenly checking himself, remarked in a severe tone <b>that</b> <b>little</b> <b>boys</b> as made their grandfathers put 'em over posts never went to heaven at any price.|$|R
6000|$|The woman {{rose and}} curtsied; and Wandering Willie sanctioned his own praises with a nod, and the ejaculation, 'All is true <b>that</b> the <b>little</b> <b>boy</b> says.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... [While he {{was making}} this speech his little boy Willie lifted a two-dollar greenback out of his vest pocket and {{vanished}} with it, and I would wager anything that if my stranger were to call on <b>that</b> <b>little</b> <b>boy</b> to-morrow {{he would make a}} false return of his income.] ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It must be horrid to be a man," [...] {{said the}} Black Sheep, [...] "and {{not to have}} any wool grow on you at all. I 'm sorry for <b>that</b> <b>little</b> <b>boy</b> that lives in the lane, for he {{will never be able to}} keep warm unless we give him some of our wool." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{think if}} you give me a full and {{unlimited}} commission to bully Giles, and <b>that</b> <b>little</b> <b>boy,</b> Brittles, I can manage it. Giles is a faithful fellow and an old servant, I know; but you can make it up to him in a thousand ways, and reward him for being such a good shot besides. You don't object to that?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look, cousin--look at <b>that</b> droll <b>little</b> <b>boy</b> {{with the}} big brown eyes; his hair is like a--what you call him?--scrubbing-brush. Oh, what a droll little boy!" ...|$|R
60|$|Now, {{the whole}} of Daffydowndilly's life had {{hitherto}} been passed with his dear mother, who had a much sweeter face than old Mr. Toil, and who had always been very indulgent to her <b>little</b> <b>boy.</b> No wonder, therefore, that poor Daffydowndilly found it a woful change, to be sent away from the good lady's side, and put {{under the care of}} this ugly-visaged schoolmaster, who never gave him any apples or cakes, and seemed to think <b>that</b> <b>little</b> <b>boys</b> were created only to get lessons.|$|R
5000|$|The Ransom of Red Chief (1910) by O. Henry [...] - [...] two kidnappers find <b>that</b> the <b>little</b> <b>boy</b> they're holding for ransom is more {{dangerous}} than the law ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because it ain't {{good to talk}} about. Gabriel dear," [...] she continued, with {{a slight}} quivering of the upper lip, [...] "sometimes I think the people round yer look upon us sorter queer. <b>That</b> <b>little</b> <b>boy</b> that came here with the {{emigrant}} family wouldn't play with me, and Mrs. Markle's little girl said that we did dreadful things {{up there in the}} snow. He said I was a cannon-ball." ...|$|E
60|$|Look at <b>that</b> <b>little</b> <b>boy</b> {{sleeping}} {{there under}} the railway arch in the East End of London--not {{the boy with}} the black hair and the hook nose and the square under-jaw, but {{the one with the}} curly head, the extremely dirty face, and the dimpled chin, on the tip of whose snub nose the rising sun shines with a power that causes it to resemble a glowing carbuncle on a visage still lying in shadow.|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{moved on}} and forgot <b>that</b> <b>little</b> <b>boy.</b> But I did not move; I gazed after them, {{not so much}} {{disappointed}} as disconcerted by this prince so utterly unlike a prince in a fairy tale. They moved very slowly across the room. Before reaching the other door the Prince stopped, and I heard him--I seem to hear him now--saying: 'I wish you would write to Vienna about filling up that post. He's a most deserving fellow--and your recommendation would be decisive.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just look at <b>that</b> poor <b>little</b> <b>boy,</b> Amy," [...] {{said the}} taller of the two. [...] "He is almost frozen, I believe. Why doesn't Caroline hurry {{and open the}} door?" ...|$|R
60|$|Once {{there was}} a bad <b>little</b> <b>boy</b> whose name was Jim--though, if you will notice, you will find <b>that</b> bad <b>little</b> <b>boys</b> are nearly always called James in your Sunday-school books. It was strange, but still it was true, that this one was called Jim.|$|R
6000|$|... "And you {{remember}} <b>that</b> two <b>little</b> <b>boys</b> had just {{got into a}} canoe, and were pushing off to enjoy themselves, when you ran down, turned them out, and took the canoe to yourself?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>That</b> <b>little</b> <b>boy</b> {{whom you}} observe {{standing}} {{under the shadow}} of yonder hull--his hands in his pockets (of course), his mouth open (probably), and his eyes gazing up fixedly at the workmen, who cluster like bees on the ribs and timbers of yonder infant ship has stood there for more than an hour, and he will stand there, or thereabout, for many hours to come; for it happens to be a holiday with him, and he dotes on harbours and dockyards. His whole being is wrapped up in them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wife," [...] he answered, [...] "it is this. In the dorp yonder I {{met a man}} who {{had come}} from Port Elizabeth. He told me that there at the port were two Englishmen, who had {{recently}} arrived, a Scotch lord, and a lawyer with red hair. When the Englishmen heard that he was from {{this part of the country}} they fell into talk with him, saying that they came upon a strange errand. It seems that when the great ship was wrecked upon this coast ten years ago there was lost in her a certain little boy who, if he had lived, would to-day have been a very rich noble in Scotland. Wife, you may know who <b>that</b> <b>little</b> <b>boy</b> was without my telling you his name." ...|$|E
60|$|But for {{all this}} March had not a single enemy. He did his companions many a kind turn; never an unkind one. He fought for love, not for hatred. He loved a dog--if any one kicked it, he fought him. He loved a little boy--if any one was cruel to <b>that</b> <b>little</b> <b>boy,</b> he fought him. He loved fair play--if any one was guilty of foul play, he fought him. When he was guilty of foul play himself (as was {{sometimes}} the case, for who is perfect?) he felt inclined {{to jump out of}} his own body and turn about and thrash himself! And he would have done so often, had it been practicable. Yes, there is no doubt whatever about it March Marston was mad--as mad, after a fashion, as any creature, human or otherwise, you choose to name.|$|E
40|$|What are <b>little</b> <b>boys</b> made of? Snips and snails, and puppy dog tails, is <b>that</b> what <b>little</b> <b>boys</b> {{are made}} of? What are little girls made of? Sugar and spice, and {{everything}} nice, is <b>that</b> what <b>little</b> girls are made of? The answer might be obvious, but the questions still bear asking, says Catherine Scott...|$|R
60|$|So I {{think it}} is no wonder <b>that</b> the <b>little</b> <b>boys</b> like to go after the cows, and I wish that {{hundreds}} and thousands of pale-faced and thin-legged little fellows had cows to go after.|$|R
6000|$|... "And now {{you know}} me," [...] I said, [...] "do {{you want to be}} like me still? I am a curious person to attach oneself to, Paterson; don't you see that even David often smiles at me when he thinks he is unobserved. I work very hard to retain <b>that</b> <b>little</b> <b>boy's</b> love; but I shall lose him soon; even now I am not what I was to him; {{in a year or two}} at longest, Paterson, David will grow out of me." ...|$|R
