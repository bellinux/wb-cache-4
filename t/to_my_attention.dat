Inquiries were {{received}} concerning bank names: Banco de Asia, Guardian Savings & Guaranty and Express Bank among others. Investigations that these entities had bank charters from the DOM and obtained through an entity named Consortium Finance Corporation headquartered in Lake Tahoe, California. Further investigation disclosed a principal alternately named John Hayden and Branch Vinedresser. Shortly thereafter the FBI took Branch Vinedresser into custody and revealed that he was Mark Pedley, who then was charged with violations of his parole.|$|E
500|$|According to a 2010 VA memo, {{the problem}} of [...] "gaming strategies" [...] inside the VA to meet {{performance}} goals dates to at least 2008. VA Deputy Undersecretary for Health Administrative Operations William Schoenhard wrote, [...] "It has come <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>attention</b> {{that in order to}} improve scores on assorted access measures, certain facilities have adopted use of inappropriate scheduling practices..." [...] Schoenhard listed 24 tactics identified in a 2008 study as inappropriately reducing the official measures of patient wait times.|$|E
500|$|The idea {{to create}} a story {{involving}} the 731 unit came from series creator Chris Carter. He noted, [...] "Unit 731 first came <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>attention</b> {{at the same time}} as it did for a lot of other people, when I read it in the New York Times about what the Japanese did to prisoners of war during the Second World War." [...] Carter decided that an episode based around former war criminals who had received [...] "clemency so [...] could use their science" [...] would be [...] "interesting".|$|E

500|$|During {{her show}} at the Olympic Stadium in Rome, Madonna {{dedicated}} her song [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] to Pope Benedict XVI. She stated, [...] "I'm gonna dedicate this song to the Pope, because, I know he loves me. I am a child of God! And you know what else?...." [...] Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera called the dedication a surprising provocation. During the 2009 leg, at the Bucharest concert in Romania, Madonna began talking about gypsy discrimination in East-European countries. She said that [...] "It has been brought <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>attention</b> ... {{that there is a}} lot of discrimination against Romanies and Gypsies in general in Eastern Europe. [...] It made me feel very sad." [...] Immediately boos and [...] resounded from the 60,000 crowd. Madonna added that [...] "e don't believe in discrimination [...] we believe in freedom and equal rights for everyone." [...] Although some applauded this statement, many others continued booing when Madonna mentioned discrimination against gay people. Madonna's publicist Liz Rosenberg issued a statement saying that [...] "Madonna has been touring with a phenomenal troupe of Roma musicians who made her aware of the discrimination toward them in several countries so she felt compelled to make a brief statement, [...] She will not be issuing a further statement." [...] In January 2009, Florin Cioabă, self-proclaimed King of Roma, announced that he wished to present Madonna with a gold plaque to thank the singer for criticising discrimination against the Roma people.|$|E

He said [...] "My son brought it <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>attention</b> and said: 'Doesn't that sound like 'Foreigner Suite?'" [...] Islam said that any legal action he might take [...] "depends on how well Satriani does." [...] Coldplay drummer Will Champion denied the claim, stating, [...] "We're confident we haven't done anything wrong." [...] In June 2009, Islam later said, [...] "They did copy my song but I don't think they did it on purpose," [...] adding, [...] "I don't want them to think I am angry with them. I'd love to sit down and have a cup of tea with them and let them know it's okay." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{interest}} in a bout with Amir Khan, Mayweather {{announced that he would}} fight 30 year old Marcos Maidana (35–3, 31 KOs) on May 3, 2014, in a unification bout at MGM Grand Garden Arena, with Mayweather's WBC and The Ring welterweight titles at stake, as well as Maidana's WBA (Super) welterweight title. Maidana won the WBA tite in December 2013 against Mayweather friend, Adrien Broner. Mayweather tweeted the news the day after his 37th birthday. The Barclays Center in Brooklyn also made a case to showcase the fight. Mayweather explained why he chose Maidana, [...] "Marcos Maidana's last performance immediately brought him <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>attention.</b> He is an extremely skilled fighter who brings knockout danger to the ring. I think this is a great fight for me and he deserves the opportunity to see if he can do what 45 others have tried to do before him – beat me." [...] Maidana was a 12-to-1 underdog going into the fight.|$|E

2500|$|In May 2013, O'Day, Bex, Richard and Fimbres began {{talks about}} a {{possible}} reunion and have since then posted photos of the group in the recording studio. An announcement {{with regard to their}} reunion was made at the 2013 Video Music Awards on MTV. During the 2013 MTV VMAs pre-show, the four remaining members of Danity Kane announced that they were reuniting, returning on their own terms without Diddy. They announced that a single would be released soon titled [...] "Rage", produced by The Stereotypes, the same producers who were responsible for Danity Kane's biggest single to date, [...] "Damaged". Original group member D. Woods did not take part in the reunion. Although no reason was given for the absence, she has stated: [...] "It has been brought <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>attention</b> that my former group members of Danity Kane will be reuniting and while I will not {{be a part of the}} reunion, I wish the ladies blessings and much success on their endeavors." ...|$|E
2500|$|Upon hearing {{news of the}} speech, Paul Cravath, Chairman of the Board of Trustees, asked McKenzie for a report. On June 8, 1925, McKenzie {{forwarded}} Cravath a six-page letter {{addressing the}} matter. McKenzie recognized the ramifications of Du Bois's address. [...] "The whole situation {{is one that is}} very serious indeed", and reported after the speech, [...] "the audience was tumultuous in its applause and so carried away that it seemed to almost trample over Mrs. McKenzie and me after the address." [...] McKenzie acknowledged that [...] "the dominant view of the colored people today is more or less sympathetic with Dr. Du Bois on the race issue," [...] and conceded that today [...] "nothing is so popular with colored audiences as denunciation of the whites, and nothing so unpopular as its absence." [...] But McKenzie refuted Du Bois' accusations that were [...] "not more than partially true." [...] He learned that at the first of the two concerts [...] "the manager of the Auditorium helped in the sale of tickets and not very tactfully turned the colored people to one window, her object being to get two streams of people in accordance with their destination. This matter was brought <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>attention</b> that night by one of our alumni and the situation was changed the next morning." [...] He further noted that [...] "we recently widened the amount of space allowed the colored people, so much so that at the last concert, in May, hundreds of white people overflowed into the colored section, mingling indiscriminately with the colored people." [...] Shortly after Du Bois's speech, Fisk trustees drafted a formal letter vigorously supporting the policies McKenzie pursued at Fisk." [...] However, Fisk trustee William DeBerry, the Black leader of St. John's Congregational Church in Springfield, Massachusetts, one of the largest Black Congregational churches in the United States, refused to sign the letter. DeBerry told Wood, [...] "I must confess that I share to some extent with many others of the Fisk alumni in a grave anxiety and fear as to the ultimate outcome of what they consider an ultra conciliatory attitude on the part of Dr. McKenzie toward southern sentiment as regards the Negro problem." [...] "I do not agree with Dr. Du Bois in all he is reported to have said in his recent address at Fisk, nor do I approve of the maneuver in which attack on Dr. McKenzie was made." ...|$|E

60|$|Pounding wearily {{through the}} darkness, I found myself {{at a loss}} to fathom the mentality of men like Jeeves's Uncle Cyril. What on earth he could see funny in a {{disaster}} which had apparently involved the complete extinction of a human creature--or, at any rate, of half a human creature and half another human creature--was more than I could understand. To me, the thing {{was one of the most}} poignant tragedies that had ever been brought <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>attention,</b> and I have no doubt that I should have continued to brood over it for quite a time, had my thoughts not been diverted by the sudden necessity of zigzagging sharply in order to avoid a pig in the fairway.|$|E

Urged by this view, I refused, and I did right in refusing, to create a companion for the first creature. He showed unparalleled malignity and selfishness in evil; he destroyed my friends; he devoted to destruction beings who possessed exquisite sensations, happiness, and wisdom; nor do I know where this thirst for vengeance may end. Miserable himself that he may render no other wretched, he ought to die. The task of his destruction was mine, but I have failed. When actuated by selfish and vicious motives, I asked you to undertake my unfinished work, and I renew this request now, when I am only induced by reason and virtue.|$|E
60|$|The most {{wonderful}} bit of bird surgery {{that has ever}} come <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>attention</b> {{is that of the}} woodcock that set his broken leg in a clay cast, as related in a previous chapter; but there is one other almost as remarkable that opens up a question that is even harder to answer. One day in the early spring I saw two eider-ducks swimming about the Hummock Pond on the island of Nantucket. The keen-eyed critic will interfere here and say I was mistaken; for eiders are salt-water ducks that haunt only the open sea and are supposed never to enter fresh water, not even to breed. That is what I also supposed until I saw these two; so I sat down to watch a while and find out, if possible, what had caused them to change their habits. At this time of year the birds are almost invariably found in pairs, and sometimes a flock a hundred yards long will pass you, flying close to the water and sweeping around the point where you are watching, first a pretty brown female and then a gorgeous black-and-white drake just behind her, alternating with perfect regularity, female and male, throughout the whole length of the long line. The two birds before me, however, were both females; and that was another reason for watching them instead of the hundreds of other ducks, coots and sheldrakes and broadbills that were scattered all over the big pond.|$|E

"Well, then," [...] said Olive, [...] "if you object {{so much to}} Rupert--you {{must not}} forget {{that it would be}} Rupert that I would really marry if I became the wife of Mr. Hemphill--do you advise me to take Mr. Locker? And I will tell you this, he is not to be rudely set aside; he has warm-hearted points which I did not suspect at first. I will tell you what he just said to me. As I was coming up-stairs he hurried toward me, and his face showed that he was very anxious to speak to me. So before he could utter a word, I told him that he was too early; that his hour had not yet arrived. Then that good fellow said to me that he had seen I was in trouble, and that he had been {{informed}} it had been caused by bad news from my family. He had made no inquiries because he did not wish to intrude upon my private affairs, and all he wished to say now was that while my mind was disturbed and worried he did not intend to present his own affairs <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>attention,</b> even though I had fixed regular times for his doing so. But although he wished me to understand that I need not fear his making love to me just at this time, he wanted me to remember that his love was still burning as brightly as ever, and would be again offered me just as soon as he would be warranted in doing so." ...|$|E
