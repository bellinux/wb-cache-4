6000|$|... "I have to <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>coming,</b> but I {{am going}} to talk plainly," [...] he said. [...] "You connived at the {{meetings}} between my daughter and the rascally adventurer who has married her?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes, I saw you, Mr. Davies, only I {{could not}} stop the song to say how do you do. By the way, I have to <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>coming</b> to inquire after me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You did quite right," [...] {{said the}} captain, [...] "and I <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>coming.</b> I {{told him he}} might go up there occasionally, but I {{particularly}} warned him against giving any annoyance to the neighbours." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I was in bed," [...] {{she said}} shortly. [...] "I can't have gentlemen callers {{there at all}} now. Father's gone off on tour. <b>Thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>coming</b> to meet me, but I don't think you'd better stop." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "There {{was no one}} in it but me, and I {{was sorry}} it wasn't entirely empty. The sides are so steep I can't climb out, so {{there was nothing to be}} done but sleep until someone found me. <b>Thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>coming.</b> If you'll please let down a rope, I'll empty this hole in a hurry." ...|$|R

6000|$|The old Count rode {{into the}} court, {{and to the}} foot of the steps, where he dismounted, Alberic holding his stirrup. He had not taken many steps upwards before Richard came voluntarily to meet him (which he had never done before), held out his hand, and said, [...] "Welcome, Count Bernard, welcome. <b>Thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>coming</b> to guard me. I am very glad to see you once more." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have to <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>coming</b> to me, Violet," [...] said Lord Chiltern. There {{was still}} in his face {{something}} of savagery,--an expression partly of anger and partly of resolution to tame the thing with which he was angry. Violet did not regard the anger half so keenly as she did that resolution of taming. An angry lord, she thought, she could endure, but she could not bear the idea of being tamed by any one.|$|R

The format of the evening is as follows: I will ask questions and the Justice will answer them...|$|R

"I {{might have}} waited a little while," [...] said Don Ippolito weakly, {{speaking}} in a hollow voice that was the shadow of his old deep tones, [...] "but you will know how to forgive the impatience of a man not yet quite master of himself.

50|$|In 2007, {{the band}} {{released}} two additional CDs that were unique. In early 2007, they released Wide-Eyed and Simplified, which contained new versions of 8 songs from Wide-Eyed and Mystified, {{in addition to}} three popular songs from earlier releases. Later in 2007, the band released Thunder After Lightning (The Uncut Demos). This album contained 15 previously unreleased demos which were considered for use on Wide-Eyed and Mystified but were not used. The CD also contained demo versions of two songs which were used on Wide-Eyed and Mystified. In April 2007, Downhere released <b>Thank</b> <b>You</b> <b>for</b> <b>Coming</b> (The Live Bootlegs), a six-song collection of live songs recorded in 2007 while on tour with Jason Gray and Lanae Hale.|$|R

6000|$|Entering the house, Mr. Staples {{led the way}} to the dining-room, {{where there}} was a large empty table {{in the middle of the}} room, and in the deep bay of the window a smaller one, laid out with wine and dessert, where sat 'old Fulbert.' Having always heard him so called, the {{brothers}} were surprised to find him no more than elderly. He must have been originally a thorough florid handsome Underwood, and had the remains of military bearing, though with an air of feebleness and want of health, and a good deal of asthmatic oppression on his breath. He did not rise, but held out his hand, saying, 'Good evening. <b>Thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>coming</b> to see a sick man.' ...|$|R

5000|$|Meat Loaf {{cancelled}} some {{concerts in}} April due to ill health.During a performance in Newcastle upon Tyne, UK on October 31, 2007, {{at the opening}} of [...] "Paradise by the Dashboard Light" [...] he suggested that the crowd of thousands should enjoy the performance as it was the last of his career. He attempted to sing the first line of the song, but instead said [...] "Ladies and gentlemen, I love <b>you,</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>coming,</b> but I can no longer continue." [...] Removing the jacket he was wearing, he thanked the audience for 30 years, said [...] "goodbye forever" [...] and left the stage. The next day his tour promoter, Andrew Miller, refuted that this was the end for Meat Loaf and that he would continue touring after suitable rest.|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish to {{ask your}} pardon," [...] said the old soldier, [...] "because I have wronged you by a moment of unjust suspicion.

I myself just flew in from the coast, and boy are my arms tired (polite chuckles from Posner and Kelman). As you know, we are gathered here to consider several propositions regarding the common law, although I suspect we may at times expand the scope of our discussion to confront some broader issues of so-called 2 ̆ 2 natural law. 2 ̆...|$|R

50|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} at the BankUnited Center in the University of Miami, Florida, on July 2009, with Thalía being accompanied to twelve musicians, and before a selected audience of approximately 300 guests. Before beginning to sing, Thalía expressed {{with a low}} and fragile voice and tears {{that she wanted to}} return to singing like the little girl she once was, the one that sang openly and honestly in front of her mirror. The private concert lasted about two hours and it costed more than 1 million $US, according to Billboard, which is an extraordinary cost for Spanish-language recording productions. During the performance, Thalía was wearing cowboy trousers and a plain white blouse, without making any wardrobe changes. The closing of the recital was with the song «Mujeres», written by Ricardo Arjona. Her final words were : «I missed the stage...I missed the microphones, <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>coming</b> and all this is exclusively for you».|$|R
