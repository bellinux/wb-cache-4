5|$|H. G. Wells' 1898 novel The War of The Worlds {{included}} a chaotic rush to board trains at Liverpool Street as the Martian machines overran military defences in the West End, {{and described the}} crushing of people under <b>the</b> <b>wheels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> steam engines.|$|E
5|$|The front {{landing gear}} is offset to the aircraft's right to allow {{placement}} of the 30mm cannon with its firing barrel along the centerline of the aircraft. During ground taxi, the offset front landing gear causes the A-10 to have dissimilar turning radii. Turning to the right on the ground takes less distance than turning left. <b>The</b> <b>wheels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main landing gear partially protrude from their nacelles when retracted, making gear-up belly landings easier to control and less damaging. All landing gears are hinged toward the aircraft's rear; if hydraulic power is lost, a combination of gravity and aerodynamic drag can open and lock the gear in place.|$|E
5|$|On February 12, 2010, a Red Line train derailed {{at about}} 10:13am as {{it left the}} Farragut North station in {{downtown}} Washington. After leaving the station, the train entered the pocket track north of the station. As it continued, an automatic derailer {{at the end of}} the pocket track intentionally derailed the train as a safety measure. If the train had continued moving forward on the pocket track, it would have entered the path of an oncoming train. <b>The</b> <b>wheels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first two cars in the six-car, White-Flint-bound train were forced off the tracks, stopping the train. Almost all of the estimated 345 passengers were evacuated from the damaged train by 11:50am and the NTSB arrived on the scene by noon. Two minor injuries were reported, and a third passenger was taken to George Washington University Hospital. The NTSB ruled the crash was due to the train operator's failure to follow standard procedures and WMATA management for failure to provide proper supervision of the train operator which resulted in the incomplete configuration of the train identification and destination codes leading to the routing of the train into the pocket track.|$|E

25|$|The {{cars have}} to follow {{specific}} guidelines (e.g. <b>the</b> <b>wheels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> car must be {{in contact with the}} track at all times). The cars are raced on a 20m long track with two lanes, to allow two cars to be raced simultaneously.|$|E
25|$|For {{a reason}} that is not fully understood, <b>the</b> <b>wheels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> replica were built with very narrow treads. It is {{possible}} that wheels were scaled off a model in the London Science Museum. As a result, it was unable to travel over modern pointwork.|$|E

25|$|The line {{operated}} without serious incident until 7 October 2013, when two Variotram railcars derailed within {{the space of}} 20 minutes. Sections of track were replaced in September and it is thought the new track damaged <b>the</b> <b>wheels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vehicles. All services were suspended and replaced by buses. Services resumed between The Star and Lilyfield on 18 October, and along {{the full length of}} the line on 30 October.|$|E
25|$|The MiG-21 uses a {{tricycle}} type undercarriage. On most variants {{the main}} landing gear uses tires that are 800mm in diameter and 200mm in width. Only the MiG-21F variants use tires with the size 660x200mm. <b>The</b> <b>wheels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{main landing gear}} retract into the fuselage after rotating 87° and the shock absorbers retract into the wing. The nose gear retracts forward into the fuselage under the radar.|$|E

25|$|The Chennai MRTS uses 9-car {{electrical}} {{multiple unit}} trains, although the 9-car trains are more prevalent during peak hours and from Aug-2015 onwards all services are 9-cars only. The trains use overhead catenary for power supply and are broad gauge. A 9-car rake is typified by 3 motor coaches each at the front, the middle and the last. The motors are used to run <b>the</b> <b>wheels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> train at a stipulated speed limit. The MRTS coaches have entry and exit on both sides. The EMU coaches are manufactured by the Integral Coach Factory, Chennai.|$|E
25|$|Imboden's {{journey was}} one of extreme misery, {{conducted}} during the torrential rains that began on July 4, in which the 8,000 wounded men were forced to endure {{the weather and the}} rough roads in wagons without suspensions. The train was harassed throughout its march. At dawn on July 5, civilians in Greencastle ambushed the train with axes, attacking <b>the</b> <b>wheels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wagons, until they were driven off. That afternoon at Cunningham's Cross Roads, Union cavalry attacked the column, capturing 134 wagons, 600 horses and mules, and 645 prisoners, about half of whom were wounded. These losses so angered Stuart that he demanded a court of inquiry to investigate.|$|E

25|$|The Normandy Society (military history club) {{was formed}} in 1994 by LTC David W. Bauer (Class of 1956) and named to honor {{those who participated in}} the 1944 Normandy Invasion. The Normandy Society is open to all cadets, but full {{membership}} and election to officers require satisfactory grades and citizenship. Meetings are held in the Baer Memorial Library on Wednesday nights to study military history campaigns and events. Classic war movies, weapons displays, and field trips are used to educate and interest MMI cadets. The cadets in this organization have raised money for worthy projects at MMI through sales of souvenir items and clothing as well as through individual donations. Previously, Normandy Society donated money to replace <b>the</b> <b>wheels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Reveille Cannon on the Quadrangle. This year they decided to help replace the video and sound system in the chapel, a greatly needed improvement.|$|E
25|$|Imboden's train {{consisted}} {{of hundreds of}} Conestoga-style wagons, which extended 15–20 miles along the narrow roads. Assembling these wagons into a marching column, arranging their escorts, loading supplies, and accounting for the wounded took until late afternoon on July 5. Imboden himself left Cashtown around 8 p.m. to join {{the head of his}} column. The journey was one of extreme misery, conducted during the torrential rains that began on July 4, in which the wounded men were forced to endure the weather and the rough roads in wagons without suspensions. Imboden's orders required that he not stop until he reached his destination, which meant that wagons breaking down were left behind. Some critically wounded men were left behind on the roadsides as well, hoping that local civilians would find and take care of them. The train was harassed throughout its march. At dawn on July 5, civilians in Greencastle ambushed the train with axes, attacking <b>the</b> <b>wheels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wagons, until they were driven off. That afternoon at Cunningham's Cross Roads (current day Cearfoss, Maryland), Capt. Abram Jones led 200 troopers of the 1st New York Cavalry and 12th Pennsylvania Cavalry in attacking the column, capturing 134 wagons, 600 horses and mules, and 645 prisoners, about half of whom were wounded. These losses so angered Stuart that he demanded a court of inquiry to investigate.|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 1820s, several further mineral {{railways}} were {{constructed in the}} west of Scotland: the Monkland and Kirkintilloch Railway, opened in 1826, proved a remarkable success in carrying coal from the collieries near Airdrie and was quickly followed by the Ballochney Railway. These [...] "coal railways" [...] used horse traction (mostly) and short cast iron rails on stone block sleepers. The key technical advance was that they used [...] "edge rails": the guidance was provided by flanges on <b>the</b> <b>wheels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wagons. These lines showed the way forward.|$|E

500|$|With no {{reported}} {{injuries from}} this incident, <b>the</b> <b>wheels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> derailed Phoenix were remounted on the rails and the journey continued. After crossing the Sankey Viaduct, the trains passed Warrington Junction, where George Stephenson's Warrington and Newton Railway was {{under construction in}} the expectation of eventual extension southwards to link the L to Birmingham and London. After passing Warrington Junction, the parade of trains passed through the historic market town of Newton-le-Willows, roughly at {{the midpoint of the}} line. Fifty-five minutes after leaving Liverpool the procession was scheduled to stop for the locomotives to take on water at Parkside railway station, half a mile east of Newton-le-Willows and [...] from Liverpool.|$|E
