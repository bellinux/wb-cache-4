25|$|In {{the course}} of normal use, there are three {{predominant}} types of wear on a pointe shoe that will determine its useful lifetime. The {{most important of these}} is shank wear. As the body of the shoe is repetitively flexed, <b>the</b> <b>shank</b> gradually weakens and loses its ability to provide support. A pointe shoe is no longer serviceable when <b>the</b> <b>shank</b> breaks or becomes too soft to provide support. The second is the softening of the box and especially the platform on which the dancer balances.|$|E
5000|$|Shank hobble: A strap, bar or {{chain that}} connects <b>the</b> <b>shanks</b> of a curb bit {{at the bottom}} of the bit. Serves to {{stabilize}} the bit, prevent a lasso or other object from being caught on <b>the</b> <b>shanks.</b>|$|R

25|$|Two {{styles of}} auger bit are {{commonly}} used in hand braces: the Jennings or Jennings-pattern bit has a self-feeding screw tip, two spurs and two radial cutting edges. This bit has a double flute starting from the cutting edges, and extending several inches up <b>the</b> <b>shank</b> of the bit, for waste removal. This pattern of bit was developed by Russell Jennings in the mid-19th century.|$|E
25|$|Another ancient {{method of}} holding the work is the hold fast or {{holdfast}}. A holdfast looks like a shepherd's crook. <b>The</b> <b>shank</b> goes into {{a hole in the}} bench top and the tip of the hook is pressed against the work from above. The holdfast is set by rapping the top with a mallet, and released by hitting the back side. A good holdfast works remarkably well, and is inexpensive and easy to install.|$|E
25|$|Drill bits {{are cutting}} tools used to remove {{material}} to create holes, almost always of circular cross-section. Drill bits come in many {{sizes and shapes}} and can create different kinds of holes in many different materials. In order to create holes drill bits are usually attached to a drill, which powers them {{to cut through the}} workpiece, typically by rotation. The drill will grasp the upper end of a bit called <b>the</b> <b>shank</b> in the chuck.|$|E
50|$|Examples of such {{nonlinear}} sequence transformations are Padé approximants, <b>the</b> <b>Shanks</b> transformation, and Levin-type sequence transformations.|$|R
40|$|THE {{degree of}} {{pigmentation}} of <b>the</b> <b>shanks</b> is one factor determining the selling price of live chickens. Among buy-ers of live broilers a shank possessing a deep shade of yellow is preferred to one having a light shade of yellow. Certain poultry diseases influence {{the degree of}} skin and shank pigmentation. Bleaching of <b>the</b> <b>shanks,</b> for example, {{is one of the}} early signs of the presence of coccidiosis. Respiratory diseases also mod-ify <b>the</b> degree of <b>shank</b> pigmentation in <b>the</b> growing chicken...|$|R

25|$|The Pequod sails {{northeast}} toward Formosa {{and into}} the Pacific Ocean. Ahab, with one nostril, smells the musk from the Bashee isles, and with the other, the salt of the waters where Moby Dick swims. Ahab goes to Perth, the blacksmith, with bag of racehorse shoenail stubs to be forged into <b>the</b> <b>shank</b> of a special harpoon, and with his razors for Perth to melt and fashion into a harpoon barb. Ahab tempers the barb in blood from Queequeg, Tashtego, and Daggoo.|$|E
25|$|Hook sizes {{generally}} {{are referred to}} by a numbering system that places the size 1 hook {{in the middle of}} the size range. Smaller hooks are referenced by larger whole numbers (e.g. 1, 2, 3...). Larger hooks are referenced by increasing whole numbers followed by a slash and a zero (e.g. 1/0 (one aught), 2/0, 3/0...) as their size increases. The numbers represent relative sizes, normally associated with the gap (the distance from the point tip to <b>the</b> <b>shank).</b> The smallest size available is 32 and largest 20/0.|$|E
25|$|Care {{needs to}} be taken when {{handling}} hooks as they can 'hook' the user. If a hook goes in deep enough below the barb, pulling the hook out will tear the flesh. There are three methods to remove a hook. The first is by cutting the flesh to remove it. The second is to cut the eye of the hook off and then push the remainder of the hook through the flesh and the third is to place pressure on <b>the</b> <b>shank</b> towards the flesh which pulls the barb into the now oval hole then push the hook out the way it came in.|$|E
40|$|Three {{carotenoid}} bands {{were isolated}} from <b>the</b> <b>shanks</b> of broilers fed pure lutein. Following saponification and rechromato-graphic purification these {{were identified as}} lutein and its mono- and diesters. Four major and two minor bands were isolated from <b>the</b> <b>shanks</b> of broilers fed alfalfa, corn gluten meal, or their respective extracts and were identified as lutein, zeaxanthin, cryptoxanthin, and zeinoxanthin, and their esters. Proportions of xanthophylls found in <b>the</b> broiler <b>shanks</b> {{were similar to those}} of the xanthophyll supplements included in the diets. The xanthophylls in the extracts prepared from alfalfa and corn gluten meals were more available than the xantho-phylls in either meal...|$|R
5000|$|Lip strap: a small strap {{used on a}} few curb bit designs, {{attaches}} between <b>the</b> bit <b>shanks</b> of a curb bit at {{the halfway}} point, used to keep the curb chain properly positioned and may prevent the horse from grabbing at <b>the</b> <b>shanks</b> with its lips.|$|R

25|$|Commonly {{referred}} {{to parts of}} a fish hook are: its point - the sharp end that penetrates the fish's mouth or flesh; the barb - the projection extending backwards from the point, that secures the fish from unhooking; the eye - {{the end of the}} hook that is connected to the fishing line or lure; the bend and shank - that portion of the hook that connects the point and the eye; and the gap - the distance between <b>the</b> <b>shank</b> and the point. In many cases, hooks are described by using these various parts of the hook. Example: Wide gap, 2X Long Shank, Hollow Point, Turned Down Ring Eye Bait hook.|$|E
25|$|Thrilling is {{the process}} of {{threading}} and drilling (accomplished in the reverse order) internal threads using a specialized cutting tool on a CNC mill. The cutting tool tip is shaped like a drill or center-cutting endmill, while the body has a thread-shaped form with a countersink cutter form near <b>the</b> <b>shank.</b> The cutter first plunges to drill the hole. Then the thread is circularly interpolated just like the multiple-form cutter described above. This tool drills, chamfers, and threads a hole all in one compact cycle. The advantage is this process eliminates a tool, tool-holder, and tool change. The disadvantage is that the process is limited to hole depth no greater than three times the diameter of the tool.|$|E
25|$|Of {{the above}} traits, scroll chucks offer always № 1 and № 2; usually № 3; to varying extents № 4 (depending on the situation); but not {{reliably}} № 5. Independent-jaw chucks offer always № 3; usually № 4; reliably № 5 (but {{at the expense}} of paying a skilled user to spend time achieving it); never № 2; and generally not № 1. Meanwhile, a collet chuck can deliver all reliably, and with no need for a skilled user (№s 3 to 5 do depend on the object being clamped closely matching {{the size and shape of}} the collet's clamping surface. This constraint is usually not a problem when the object is good-quality bar stock; <b>the</b> <b>shank</b> of a well maintained drill bit, reamer, end mill, etc.; or a previously machined part that is being rechucked for additional cutting operations).|$|E

5000|$|Kielland forceps (1915, Norwegian) are {{distinguished}} by having no angle between <b>the</b> <b>shanks</b> and <b>the</b> blades and a sliding lock. The pelvic {{curve of the}} blades is identical to all other forceps. The common misperception {{that there is no}} pelvic curve has become so entrenched in the obstetric literature that it may never be able to be overcome, but it can be proved by holding a blade of Kielland's against any other forceps of one's choice. Probably the most common forceps used for rotation. The sliding mechanism at the articulation can be helpful in asynclitic births (when the fetal head is tilted to the side), since the fetal head is no longer in line with the birth canal. [...] Because <b>the</b> handles, <b>shanks</b> and blades are all in the same plane the forceps can be applied in any position to effect rotation. Because <b>the</b> <b>shanks</b> and handles are not angled the forceps cannot be applied to a high station as readily as those with the angle since <b>the</b> <b>shanks</b> impinge on <b>the</b> perineum.|$|R
25|$|Shanks are {{typically}} made from leather, plastic, cardstock, or layers of glue-hardened burlap. The flexibility of a shank {{is determined by}} its thickness {{and the type of}} material used. A shank's thickness may be consistent throughout or it may vary along its length to produce different strengths at select points. For example, slits may be cut across a shank at demi-pointe to enhance roll through. Also, a shank's thickness may transition at some point along its length in order to implement differing strengths above and below the transition. Standard pointe shoes typically have a full shank, in which <b>the</b> <b>shank</b> runs the full length of the sole, or fractional (e.g., half or three-quarter) length shanks. Many pointe shoe manufacturers offer a choice of shank materials, and some will build shoes with customized shanks of varying stiffness and length.|$|E
25|$|In 1979, as {{recommended}} in the Expedition's report, {{the opportunity to}} conserve one of the bower anchors was realised when grant funding became available. The SUHR collaborated with the SA Government and the Kangaroo Island Scuba Club {{to carry out the}} recovery. Assistance to the project was also provided by another 23 government agencies, private organisations and individuals. On 31 March 1980, an anchor shank was recovered from the wreck site followed by its stock on 1 April. Both parts were temporarily stored in the waters of West Bay for eventual collection and transfer by the fishing vessel, Lady Buick, to Kingscote respectively during April and May 1980. <b>The</b> <b>shank</b> and the stock were then respectively conveyed to Port Adelaide on MV Troubridge and on HMAS Banks. Conservation was carried out by Amdel in Adelaide. The conserved anchor was returned to Kangaroo Island where it was placed on display at the Flinders Chase Homestead in the Flinders Chase National Park, following a formal ceremony on 26 March 1982 attended by David Wotton, the SA Minister of Environment and Planning.|$|E

2500|$|The Irwin or solid-center {{auger bit}} is similar, the only {{difference}} being {{that one of the}} cutting edges has only a [...] "vestigal flute" [...] supporting it, which extends only about [...] up <b>the</b> <b>shank</b> before ending. The other flute continues full-length up <b>the</b> <b>shank</b> for waste removal. The Irwin bit may afford greater space for waste removal, greater strength (because the design allows for a center shank of increased size within the flutes, as compared to the Jenning bits), or smaller manufacturing costs. This style of bit was invented in 1884, and the rights sold to Charles Irwin who patented and marketed this pattern the following year.|$|E
