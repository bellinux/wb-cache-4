5|$|A {{secret trust}} is an {{arrangement}} between a <b>testator</b> and a trustee to benefit a person {{without having to}} specify that person in a will. The trustee is transferred property {{under the terms of}} the will which he or she then holds on trust for others.|$|E
5|$|The courts {{recognise}} {{two forms}} of secret trust. Fully secret trusts are trusts not referred to {{at all on the}} face of the will. Instead, an agreement made between the <b>testator</b> and trustees elsewhere. The trustee will instead be named only a beneficiary. In the case of a half-secret trust, the fact that the beneficiary holds as trustee only is declared {{on the face of the}} will, but not the other terms of the trust.|$|E
5|$|As {{a form of}} express trust, {{charitable}} trusts {{are subject}} to certain formalities, {{as well as the}} requirements of the three certainties, when being created. These vary depending on whether the gift that creates the trust is given in life, given after death, or includes land. If the gift is given after death through a will, the will must comply with Section 9 of the Wills Act 1837, which requires that the will be in writing and signed by the <b>testator</b> (or somebody else present, at the testator's instruction), {{it is clear that the}} <b>testator</b> intended to give effect to the will, and the signature is made or noted by two or more witnesses. If these are all carried out, the will is a valid document, and the gift made as part of it can create a charitable trust. If the gift is of land and made during the donor's lifetime, it must comply with Section 53(1)(b) of the Law of Property Act 1925, which requires that the agreement be a written document signed by the person giving it. If the gift is of personal property and made inter vivos, there are no formal requirements; it is enough that an oral declaration is made creating the trust. Once constituted properly, a charitable trust, like all express trusts, cannot be undone unless there is something allowing that within the trust instrument.|$|E
5|$|If {{a secret}} trust cannot be established, the {{beneficiary}} will hold outright. If a secret trust can be shown, but not its terms (or communication post-dated the <b>testator's</b> death), then the would-be trustee will hold on resulting trust for the <b>testator's</b> estate.|$|R
50|$|A will which {{contains}} the <b>testator's</b> expressed will.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>testator's</b> {{signature}} must {{be placed}} {{at the end of}} the will. If this is not observed, any text following the signature will be ignored, or the entire will may be invalidated if what comes after the signature is so material that ignoring it would defeat the <b>testator's</b> intentions.|$|R
5|$|In English law, secret trusts are a {{class of}} trust defined as an {{arrangement}} between a <b>testator</b> and a trustee, made to come into force after death, that aims to benefit a person without having been written in a formal will. The property {{is given to the}} trustee in the will, and he would then be expected to pass it on to the real beneficiary. For these to be valid, the person seeking to enforce the trust must prove that the <b>testator</b> intended to form a trust, that this intention was communicated to the trustee, and that the trustee accepted his office. There are two types of secret trust — fully secret and half-secret. A fully secret trust is one with no mention in the will whatsoever. In the case of a half-secret trust, the face of the will names the trustee as trustee, but does not give the trust's terms, including the beneficiary. The most important difference lies in communication of the trust: the terms of a half-secret trust must be communicated to the trustee before the execution of the will, whereas {{in the case of a}} fully secret trust the terms may be communicated after the execution of the will, as long as this is before the testator's death.|$|E
5|$|Both the High Court and the Charities Commission are {{authorised}} {{to establish}} schemes administering charities. These can come about when {{money has been}} left for a charitable purpose which is not specified, or with no suggestion as to {{how it should be}} administered. The scheme may be used to appoint new trustees, except when the trustee's identity is crucial to the intentions of the <b>testator,</b> as in Re Lysaght. Schemes may also be used to fix administrative difficulties caused by uncertainty, as in Re Gott, or even to completely defeat the gift. Schemes can also be used, on the application of trustees, to extend powers of investment or consolidate funds. The trustees may apply to change the core purpose of the trust, which while enacted through a scheme, follows the doctrine of Cy-près.|$|E
25|$|The person {{providing}} {{the property is}} called the donor or disponer, or <b>testator</b> or deceased {{in the case of}} inheritance; the person receiving the property is called the beneficiary, donee or disponee, or the successor in the case of inheritance.|$|E
60|$|Besides the <b>testator's,</b> {{there were}} two {{signatures}} of witnesses.|$|R
5000|$|The {{legal issue}} {{was whether the}} <b>testator’s</b> bequest {{constituted}} a vested legacy to Samuel, in which case his share was his (and his estate’s after his death); or whether Samuel’s legacy lapsed because Samuel died before Ruth died, and thus before the <b>testators</b> {{had the power to}} sell the house.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{exception}} {{occurs in}} the case of a joint will, in which the <b>testators</b> have “massed” their property. If, after the death of one of the <b>testators,</b> the survivor has accepted benefits under the joint will, he or she cannot revoke his or her portion of the joint will.|$|R
25|$|Re Hobley adopts the {{unconscionability}} rationale {{such that}} {{the imposition of a}} constructive trust is only justified by unconscionability, therefore there must be detrimental reliance. This would appear to be analogous to the doctrine of estoppel. Another consequence of this approach is that the trust must come into existence before the death of the first <b>testator</b> as otherwise {{the subject matter of the}} trust would be uncertain and could possible be avoided by inter vivos dispositions.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{the death}} of a Muslim, his or her estate shall be {{distributed}} according to sharia law. This is called the Faraid or the Islamic law of Inheritance. A Muslim is allowed to make a will, called a wasiat, but only one-third of his estate shall be disposed of according to the will. Furthermore, the requirement under sharia law is that disposition according to wills shall not benefit any person opposed to Islam as a religion. This situation applies throughout Peninsula Malaysia and Sabah. In Sarawak, a Muslim <b>testator</b> may dispose one-third of his property to anyone he or she wishes.|$|E

50|$|White v Jones 1995 2 AC 207; In this case, {{which was}} carried {{by only a}} 3:2 majority, a {{solicitor}} was told {{to draw up a}} new will, splitting the <b>testator's</b> estate between the two plaintiffs, his daughters. He negligently failed to do this {{by the time of the}} <b>testator's</b> death, and the estate passed in accordance with the <b>testator's</b> wishes expressed in a previous will. The daughters sued the solicitor in negligence. It was held that the solicitor had assumed a special relationship towards them, creating a duty of care which he had carried out negligently, and therefore had to indemnify them for their loss. Once again, that extended Hedley Byrne liability to a proximate third party.|$|R
500|$|Where a {{beneficiary}} under {{a secret}} trust predeceases the <b>testator,</b> {{his or her}} personal representative will inherit instead, as in Re Gardner. If the gift had been made directly as part of testator's will it would have lapsed and formed part {{of his or her}} residuary estate by the beneficiary's death, but since he or she inherits {{as a result of a}} separate secret trust that rule does not apply. Where the trustee of a secret trust predeceases the <b>testator,</b> or renounces his trusteeship before the death of the <b>testator,</b> the position of the secret trust in unclear. In the case of a half-secret trust, the trust ought to be good on the basis that [...] "equity will not allow a trust to fail for want of a trustee". Of a fully secret trust, it was indicated by Lord Buckmaster in Blackwell v Blackwell that such a trust might not fail: [...] "the legatee might defeat the whole purpose by renouncing the legacy... I entertain no doubt that the Court, having once admitted the evidence of the trust, would interfere to prevent its defeat." [...] Against this, it has been argued that the arrangement is the result of a personal obligation as thus fails if renounced or if the trustee predeceases the <b>testator.</b>|$|E
500|$|The rule {{came out}} of the case of Knight v Knight. The <b>testator,</b> after giving away his {{personal}} and real property, added {{to the end of his}} will that [...] "I trust to the justice of my successors, in continuing the estates in the male succession, according to the will of the founder of the family". Langdale MR, hearing the case, held that this was not specific enough to create a valid trust; furthermore, to be held as valid, trust instruments would have to have: ...|$|E
500|$|In June 1537 in {{his will}} among many provisions, Francesco {{returned}} Lisa's dowry to her, gave her personal clothing and jewelry and provided for her future. Upon entrusting her care to their daughter Ludovica and, should she be incapable, his son Bartolomeo, Francesco wrote, [...] "Given the affection and love of the <b>testator</b> towards Mona Lisa, his beloved wife; in consideration {{of the fact that}} Lisa has always acted with a noble spirit and as a faithful wife; wishing that she shall have all she needs…".|$|E
5000|$|If no such clause is present, {{however, the}} residuary estate will {{pass to the}} <b>testator's</b> heirs by intestacy.|$|R
25|$|The {{granting}} of probate {{is the first}} step in the legal process of administering the estate of a deceased person, resolving all claims and distributing the deceased person's property under a will. A probate court decides the legal validity of a <b>testator's</b> (deceased person's) will and grants its approval, also known as granting probate, to the executor. The probated will then becomes a legal instrument that may be enforced by the executor in the law courts if necessary. A probate also officially appoints the executor (or personal representative), generally named in the will, as having legal power to dispose of the <b>testator's</b> assets in the manner specified in the <b>testator's</b> will. However, through the probate process, a will may be contested.|$|R
5000|$|A legatee, {{in the law}} of wills, is any {{individual}} or organization bequeathed any portion of a <b>testator's</b> estate.|$|R
500|$|Since {{allowing}} the {{trustee of the}} will to retain the property {{is at the heart}} of the [...] "fraud", it is not clear why courts have considered the appropriate remedy to recognise a trust on behalf of others, rather than a resulting trust in favour of the estate (the residuary legatee). To this it has been argued that, since the <b>testator</b> is dead, a resulting trust is often reversing the beneficiary's claims since the <b>testator</b> cannot make any attempt to revoke or undo the trust terms. Save in case of a will and except the plain reading of clauses within the will, having admitted external evidence as operating under the proper introduction of the doctrine of incorporation by reference, a conclusive claim that it is necessary to observe further the formality requirement cannot be disregarded, because Will Act clearly set out the requirements of property transfer in case of failure has to be based on result trust that a party ultimately intended. The enforcement of the secret trust as a response to perceived fraud also opens the door to a further form of deceit, whereby the trustee funnels the trust monies to the wrong beneficiary. In light of evidential burden of proof, when establishing the identity of the secret beneficiary, ...|$|E
500|$|The most {{important}} distinction between half-secret and fully secret trusts concerns the communication {{of the terms}} of the trust. Communication must be either at or before the execution of the will, in contrast to fully secret trusts, when it may postdate the will so long as it predates the death of the <b>testator.</b> In Blackwell, Viscount Sumner said that: [...] " [...] <b>testator</b> cannot reserve to himself a power of making future unwitnessed dispositions by merely naming a trustee and leaving the purposes of the trust to be supplied afterwards", a passage given its traditional interpretation in cases such as Re Keen, becoming a [...] "cornerstone" [...] of what has become known as the 'prior acceptance rule'. Although that interpretation has been confirmed as the law in further cases, Professor John Mee said that Viscount Sumner suggested that acceptance by the trustee (whether of a half-secret or fully secret trust) must take place within the testator's lifetime before the execution of the will. Mee hoped High Court would make clarification on whether prior acceptance exists and therefore the law regarding acceptance should be different between half-secret and fully secret trusts. Acceptance of the half-secret trust is not entirely different to fully secret trusts but there are subtle and decisive variations; it can be communicated either directly, or tacitly.|$|E
500|$|The {{will was}} not signed by Polo, but was {{validated}} by the then-relevant [...] "signum manus" [...] rule, {{by which the}} <b>testator</b> only had to touch the document to make it legally valid. Due to the Venetian law stating that the day ends at sunset, the exact date of Marco Polo's death cannot be determined, but according to some scholars it was between the sunsets of January 8 and 9, 1324. Biblioteca Marciana, which holds the original copy of his testament, dates the testament in January 9, 1323, and gives the date of his death {{at some time in}} June 1324.|$|E

500|$|Evidential issues also exist. Because secret trusts are by {{definition}} secret, they {{are difficult to}} prove in court. The parol evidence rule states that where there is written evidence, oral testimony cannot be introduced to the court if it contradicts that evidence. Since secret trusts are oral and normally exist outside of the will (a written document) this causes problems. In Re Keen, the issue came up, and the Court of Appeal decided that the parol evidence rule extended to secret trusts, and such trusts could not be enforced if they contradicted written documents. More generally, the problem is proving that the <b>testator</b> intended to create a trust. As in McCormic v Grogan, the standard is high; the person trying to enforce the trust must show [...] "most clearly and distinctly" [...] that it exists.|$|E
500|$|As such, simply {{giving the}} {{trustees}} this power {{was not enough}} to defeat uncertainties. If, however, the <b>testator</b> [...] "had sufficiently defined" [...] the way in which trustees should exercise their judgement, it would be valid. The final device is to give the trustees the power to give trust property to [...] "anyone in the world" [...] or to [...] "anyone whom the trustees consider appropriate". This has two problems; firstly, the class could be too broad to be administratively workable, and second, the courts are unable to judge if the power has been exercised appropriately. However, in Re Hay's Settlement Trust, Megarry V-C held that, exercised properly, this sort of agreement could be administratively workable, and would not be immediately void. But if the gift were given to a wide class of people for a charitable purpose, it will be valid.|$|E
500|$|There is the {{question}} as to what to do with proposed [...] "compromise" [...] agreements where it is not certain that a benefit will ensue. In this situation, the courts have sometimes agreed to take the chance, as in Re Holt's Settlement; on other occasions, as in Re Cohen's Settlement Trusts [...] 3 All ER 139, they have found that if the claimant, a member of a class of beneficiaries, applies and cannot benefit (although other members of the class can), the court is obliged to refuse the request. It is debatable as to whether the intentions of the <b>testator</b> should be taken into account; in Re Steed's Will Trusts [...] 1 All ER the courts refused to alter a trust document, partially due to the testator's wishes; in Re Remnant's Settlement Trusts [...] 2 All ER 554, however, the court took the opposite view.|$|E
50|$|A second {{exception}} to the rule that a person must be dead {{can be found in the}} case of estate massing. When estates are massed, the entire estates or parts of the estates of various <b>testators</b> are consolidated into a single economic unit for the purpose of testamentary disposal. The effect of estate massing is that the surviving <b>testator’s</b> estate dissolves according to the will of the first-dying whilst he or she is still alive.|$|R

Snyder, 63 P. 170 (Cal. 1900), {{was a case}} {{decided by}} the Supreme Court of California holding that a will could not serve to {{transfer}} a <b>testator's</b> dead body away from the next of kin, and that the next of kin's right to custody of a dead body defeats any right of the executor. The holding was at least partly superseded by statute in 1947, permitting <b>testators</b> to dispose of their remains via will for certain purposes.|$|R
