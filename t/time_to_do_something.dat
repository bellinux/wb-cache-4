Dondon Monteverde, co-founder of Reality Entertainment, {{said that many}} studios were impressed by the script but were reluctant to finance an expensive action film. The production team considered reducing the film's budget, but decided not to, hoping to shift away from making low-budget films; Monteverde recalled arguing that it was [...] "really <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> big-budget and showcase it, rather than making something small and claiming budgetary restrictions. This time we didn't give ourselves any excuses. We went all the way". The production cost for the film amounted to ₱47 million (about US$1.1 million in 2013).|$|E
500|$|Speaking to The Times {{about the}} ending of the show in 1989, Curtis hinted that the {{collaborative}} writing process caused tensions amongst the cast: [...] "Everybody on the show thinks they can put in good jokes, despite the fact that Ben Elton and I think there are already quite a few good ones in there to start with. It does usually end up funnier, but it's <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> over which I have more control." [...] Twenty years on, Curtis recalled in the documentary Blackadder Rides Again that: [...] "They would literally sit around for the entire time discussing the script...sometimes we would just say to them [...] "if you stood up and tried to act this script out, you would find out things about it." [...] Ben Elton stated that by opening it up, they allowed the cast to question every aspect of the script.|$|E
500|$|Miss Freda Whitlam (born 1920), {{sister of}} Prime Minister Gough Whitlam was {{principal}} between 1958 and 1976. It {{was a period}} of great social transition. [...] In 1968 Miss Whitlam wrote: 'Ours is a world where each year we become more conscious of how quickly and radically our environment is changing. [...] Technology is taking the drudgery out of our lives and opening up exciting opportunities for those who have a good general education and are willing to think positively and creatively. [...] Here we help the girls with this aim in view.' In 1970, after the Rev. Bill McLeod spoke to some of the seniors and advised those intending to become a nurse or a teacher to learn Greek or Italian (to aid communication with immigrants), Miss Whitlam took up the suggestion: 'We have people with <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> after the exams {{at the end of each}} year - let's organise Greek classes for them'. In March 1972 the school also produced a newsletter ΕΛΛΗΝΙΚΑ ΝΕΑ providing background on Greek culture and language and a bibliography of relevant books in the school library.|$|E

50|$|Stottlemeyer and Disher {{arrive and}} talk to Archie, {{learning}} his reasons for hiring the hit man: he had never given up being a cop, and late at night, he often searched his employees' offices and desks. He discovered the report and realized that Lorber had pillaged the pension fund, and knowing that Lorber was not likely going <b>to</b> get hard <b>time,</b> had <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> about it.|$|R

We did 7 {{albums and}} 131 shows... almost 200 songs {{recorded}} in our studio, and life just really became to a natural, if not dramatic, conclusion {{for me in}} Santa Barbara, I had a pretty traumatic accident, where I was hospitalized; I was jilted romantically in a pretty bad way and I didn't react to that very well, and I kinda' went crazy for awhile. I went off my head, and I {{went to work at}} sea. I took a job on a ship for awhile....|$|E
2500|$|In 2003, Faulkner co-authored with Steve Andreas {{to write}} NLP: The New Technology of Achievement. In the book, they write, “Lengthy {{struggle}} without success {{is a sign}} that what we’re doing isn’t working. It’s <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> else, anything else. It’s time to realize that pain, struggle, suffering and waiting are signs that it’s time for another approach…." [...] The following year, he attended the NLP Conference and Festival at the University of Bristol, England. There Faulkner presented [...] "Awakening to the Social – An Introduction to Irresistible Influence." [...] The following year he presented [...] "Expository Cartography," [...] an introduction to advanced mind mapping techniques {{that could be used to}} disengage habitual biases and systematically enrich any model including the more complex ones such as the four-quadrant model of Ken Wilber. In 2006 at the NLP Conference in London, he presented [...] "Training is for Dogs and Horses", a bold challenge to the limiting approach in which NLP had previously been taught. In September 2007 Faulkner lectured at the London School of Economics to The Society for Organisational Learning(SOL-UK).|$|E

5000|$|Speaking of both Of Rivers and Religion and After the Ball in a 1998 {{interview}} for The Wire, Fahey recalled, [...] "I don't {{understand why they}} got bad reviews. It's like every <b>time</b> I wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> other than play guitar I got castigated." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] he murmured. [...] "Don't {{forget that}} when {{we can no longer}} smile we can only swell and burst.

60|$|And {{so on and}} so on, {{the ship}} {{meanwhile}} rushing on her way with a heavier list, a noisier splutter, a more threatening hiss of the white, almost blinding, sheet of foam to leeward. For the best of it was that Captain S- seemed constitutionally incapable of giving his officers a definite order to shorten sail; and so that extraordinarily vague row would go on till at last it dawned upon them both, in some particularly alarming gust, that it was <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something.</b> There is nothing like the fearful inclination of your tall spars overloaded with canvas to bring a deaf man and an angry one to their senses.|$|E
60|$|Occurrences {{like the}} {{crossing}} of the bar just now were extremely alarming to his prospects. He {{did not want to}} be left behind by some swift catastrophe. Massy being on the bridge, the old man had to brace himself up and make a show, he supposed. But it was getting very bad with him, very bad indeed, now. Even Massy had been emboldened to find fault this time; Sterne, listening at the foot of the ladder, had heard the other's whimpering and artless denunciations. Luckily the beast was very stupid and could not see the why of all this. However, small blame to him; it took a clever man to hit upon the cause. Nevertheless, it was high <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something.</b> The old man's game could not be kept up for many days more.|$|E
60|$|I went to-day to R. L. S.'s ship, {{which is}} at the Albert Dock, about 20 minutes in the train from Fenchurch Street. Its sailing has been put off till Monday forenoon, so there is more <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something.</b> I couldn't, after all, get on the ship--as she stood off from the dock, without a {{convenient}} approach, and both the captain and the steward (whom I wanted to see) were not there, as I was told by a man on the dock who was seeing some things being put on by a crane in which I couldn't be transferred. The appearance of the vessel was the reverse of attractive, though she is rather large than small. I write to-night to Mrs. Stevenson, to ask if they are really coming up to sail--that is if nothing has interfered at the last moment. If they are, there is nothing to be done to deter them, that I see. I shall ask her to telegraph me an answer. I shall feel that I must go again (to the ship), as I don't very well see how things are to be sent there. I will telegraph you what she telegraphs me and what I decide to do.|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Rolling Stone magazine, Franklin said she wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> [...] "a record with a younger sound to it.
