The Norden was unable to work at night at all; the bomb aimer had to locate the target long in advance of the drop point using a built-in telescope and targets were simply not visible at the required distances in low light.|$|E

5|$|Flight tests {{revealed}} difficult handling, {{and a lack}} of power due to the non-availability of the intended ACh-30BF engines. Flight tests continued without the waist guns and their gunner until the ACh-30BF's were fitted between May and July 1944. Despite modifications, the aircraft still suffered from poor controllability at low speeds and high weights as well as very poor gliding performance. Throughout the flight tests the engines performed satisfactorily in the air, but were found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> difficult to start in low ambient temperatures and had slow response to throttle movements. Further development was canceled.|$|E
5|$|George's {{arrangement}} remained current until 1996, when Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges {{published an}} arrangement informed by a cladistic analysis of morphological characteristics. They retained George's subgenera {{and many of}} his series, but discarded his sections. Banksia ser. Abietinae was found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> nearly monophyletic, and so retained. It further resolved into four subclades, so Thiele and Ladiges split it into four subseries. Banksia sphaerocarpa appeared in the second of these, initially called the ' grossa clade' for its most basal member. As with George's classification, B.grossa and B.micrantha emerged as close relatives of B.sphaerocarpa.|$|E
