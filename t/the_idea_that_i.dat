It's a wider dialogue. I'm talking to people who are older than me and younger than me, and our generation as well." [...] He said that much of the record was [...] "an attempt to go back to what's important at a musical core and build it outward."

While he {{acknowledged}} that he [...] "might be ridiculed" [...] for doing so, Benn said that [...] "But 'Wedgie Benn' and 'the Rt Honourable Anthony Wedgwood Benn' {{and all that stuff}} is impossible. I have been Tony Benn in Bristol for a long time." [...] In October 1973, he announced on BBC Radio that he wished to be known as Mr. Tony Benn rather than Anthony Wedgwood Benn, and his book Speeches from 1974 is credited to [...] "Tony Benn". Despite this name change, social historian Alwyn W. Turner writes that [...] "Just as those with an agenda to pursue still call Muhammed Ali by his original name ... so most newspapers continued to refer to Tony Benn as Wedgwood Benn, or Wedgie {{in the case of the}} tabloids, for years to come (some older Tories were still doing so three decades later)." ...|$|E
500|$|Night of the Blood Beast was one {{of several}} films {{produced}} by B movie filmmaker Roger Corman and his brother, Gene Corman. The two also partnered together in making Hot Car Girl (1958), Beast from Haunted Cave (1959), Attack of the Giant Leeches (1959) and The Premature Burial (1962). Jerome Bixby, the science fiction screenwriter who wrote It! The Terror from Beyond Space (1958), was originally approached for the job, but Bixby was working on another project and recommended his close friend Martin Varno for the job. Varno, the son of veteran actor Roland Varno, was 21 years old at the time. He met with Roger and Gene Corman, who discussed with him what Varno called [...] "some sort of a weird idea for the picture". They offered Varno a couple hundred dollars for the job, which was below the minimum compensation rates known as [...] "scale", but Varno {{was not part of the}} Writers Guild of America at the time and did not know about the guidelines. He accepted the offer and signed a contract. Although Varno had a rough idea it would be a low-budget film, he said the Cormans set no specific guidelines for him: [...] "I gave them the impression that I knew pretty much what I was doing, and they sort of got <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> wasn't going to use 50,000 extras and things." ...|$|E

In an article in the December 2004 edition of the {{magazine}} Royalty Digest: A Journal of Record Peter de Malama wrote that his cousin, Dmitri Yakovlevich Malama, an officer in the Imperial Russian Cavalry, met Tatiana when he was wounded in 1914 and a romance later developed between Tatiana and the young man when he was appointed an equerry to the court of the Tsar at Tsarskoye Selo. Dmitri Malama gave Tatiana a French bulldog she named [...] "Ortipo" [...] in September 1914. [...] "Forgive me about the little dog," [...] Tatiana wrote to her mother on 30 September 1914. [...] "To say the truth, when he asked should I like to have it if he gave it to me, I at once said yes. You remember, I always wanted to have one, and only afterwards when we came home I thought that suddenly you might not like me having one. But I really was so pleased at <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> forgot about everything." [...] The dog died, but Malama gave her a replacement puppy. Tatiana took it with her to Yekaterinburg, where it died {{with the rest of the}} family. Malama paid the imperial family a visit some eighteen months after he gave Tatiana the first dog. [...] "My little Malama came for an hour yesterday evening," [...] wrote Alexandra to Nicholas on 17 March 1916. [...] "...Looks flourishing more of a man now, an adorable boy still. I must say a perfect son in law he w(ou)ld have been â€“ why are foreign P(rin)ces not as nice!" [...] Malama was killed in August 1919 while commanding a unit of the White Russians fighting the civil war against the Bolsheviks in the Ukraine, according to Peter de Malama.|$|E

The vision has been to create a collection that will allow women to enjoy an active lifestyle while remaining fashionable at the same time. I'm thrilled with everything we've created to launch EleVen." [...] Venus's line, EleVen made its debut at the 2012 New York fashion week. It was modeled by athletes as opposed to models, a choice made by Venus herself to feature the sort of people the line was designed for.

2500|$|Former {{stand-up}} comic John Ridley {{had originally}} written the screenplay, then titled Spoils of War, {{as an experiment}} to see how fast he could write and sell a film. The writing took him seven days, and Warner Bros. bought the script 18 days later. When the studio showed a list of their purchased scripts to Russell, the one-sentence description of Spoils of War, [...] "heist set in the Gulf War", appealed to him. Although Russell claimed he never read Ridley's script, so as not [...] "to pollute my own idea", he admits that [...] "John gets credit where it's due. The germ of <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> took was his." [...] Ridley maintains that Russell shut {{him out of the}} process, saying [...] "I never heard a word while he was shooting the movie. Never saw any of the script changes. And then finally, a year later, I get a copy of the script, and my name isn't even on it." [...] Although Warner Bros. worked out a deal to give Ridley a [...] "story by" [...] credit, Ridley remains unhappy with the experience, and has blocked Russell's efforts to publish the Three Kings screenplay in book form.|$|E

30|$|Over {{the last}} century, we have embraced fire as a {{variable}} in the ecology of many natural systems and organisms. We no longer consider all fires to be disturbances in otherwise fire free systems. Instead, {{we are beginning to}} see a world of ecosystems and organisms that have evolved with fire. It is now considered very reasonable to suggest that some features in organisms may represent adaptations to fire. As our species and its progenitors have been living closely with fire for many millennia, if not millions of years, it seems reasonable to suggest that this association has influenced our development as a species. <b>The</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have proposed here are not intended to replace other hypotheses of human evolution, but simply to suggest that we consider the role of fire when we speculate about human origins.|$|R
