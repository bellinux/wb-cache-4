40|$|The {{two sides}} of the Taiwan Strait perform {{mutually}} dependent but complementary activities in the global manufacturing supply-chain. As a result, trade between Taiwan and China grew in double digits annually in the 1990 s. With growing economic ties, direct air links are inevitable. In this research, we analyzed government documents and interviewed the air cargo carriers and airlines that currently serve the Taiwan-China air cargo market. This information enabled us to tabulate the trade, estimate the airport-to-airport air cargo demand and calibrate the international and domestic freight tariffs. We used a connectivity measurement and classified Chinese airports into national, regional and local classes in a hub-and-spoke air cargo network. We developed a mathematical model and a branch-and-bound algorithm. The results showed that at least two <b>transit</b> <b>airports</b> are economically necessary for a Taiwan-China air link. Shanghai and Xiamen were always the top two <b>transit</b> <b>airports.</b> The third airport would be Changsha if the decision becomes three air-links. These links are different from the top three passenger <b>transit</b> <b>airports,</b> Fuzhou, Xiamen and Shanghai, even though the cost saving is moderate. ...|$|R

5000|$|In 1939 the Italian Government of Benito Mussolini {{was granted}} {{authorization}} by the Portuguese colonial government to begin construction on a <b>transit</b> <b>airport</b> to service its flights flying between Europe and South America. Very simple pre-fabricated facilities were built. However, {{as a consequence}} of World War II, the Italian involvement in the airport project ceased. In 1945 the Portuguese purchased the airport installation from the Italians and by 1949 the Ilha do Sal airport was a fully operational transit facility. The airport has been gradually improved ever since. Small houses were erected in several areas immediately adjacent to the airport. Near Morro Curral, workers from nearby Sao Nicolau named the civilian area [...] "Preguiça" [...] after the port village on their home island. Espargos is the city's official name. No longer after the airport opened, the track became the island's first paved road and was basalt. Since 1977, Espargos has been the principal commercial and government center of the island.

5000|$|By December 1992 {{the airline}} became a joint stock company, as a {{transitional}} step towards partial privatisation, which was effected in late 1999, with ownership then allocated thusly: State Treasury [...] - [...] 67.97% of {{shares in the}} company; Regionalny Fundusz Gospodarczy S.A. [...] - [...] 25.1%; the employees [...] - [...] 6.93%. In 1994 the airline signed a code-sharing agreement with American Airlines on flights to and from Warsaw as well as onward flights in the United States and Poland operated by both companies; flights to Thessaloniki, Zagreb and Nice were inaugurated, and according to an IATA report, in this year LOT had the youngest fleet of any airline in the world. After years of planning, in 1997 LOT set up a sister airline, EuroLOT, which, essentially operating as its parent airline's regional subsidiary, took over domestic flights. The airline was developed {{with the hope that}} it would increase transit passenger-flow through Warsaw's Chopin Airport, whilst at the same time providing capacity on routes with smaller load factors and play a part in developing LOT's reputation as the largest transit airline in Central and Eastern Europe. By 1999 LOT had purchased a number of small Embraer 145 regional jets in order to expand its short-haul fleet, and had, with the approval of the Minister of the State Treasury, begun a process of selling shares to the Swiss company SAirGroup Holding, this then led to the airline's incorporation into the then-nascent Qualiflyer Group.Expansion of LOT's route network continued in the early 2000s and the potential of the airline's hub at Warsaw Chopin Airport to become a major <b>transit</b> <b>airport</b> was realised with more and more success. In 2000 LOT took delivery of its largest ever order of 11 aircraft and by 2001 had reached a milestone passengers-carried figure of 3 million customers in one year; such an expansion led to the reconstruction of much of LOT's ground infrastructure, and by 2002 a new central Warsaw head office was opened on Ul. 17 Stycznia. On 26 October 2003, LOT, {{after the collapse of the}} Qualiflyer Group, became the 14th member of the Star Alliance. By 2006 a new base of operations, with the reconstruction of Warsaw Chopin Airport, had opened, thus allowing LOT's full transit airline potential to be developed for the first time ever. The new airport is much larger than any previous airport in Poland. In that same year Pope Benedict XVI returned to Rome on a LOT flight following his pilgrimage to Poland.|$|E

40|$|Assessing {{wildlife}} hazards to aviation in {{the airport}} environment is typically initiated by conducting a Wildlife Hazard Assessment (WHA).

In association with GIS software, these data can be queried to provide hazard and risk mapping on the airfield and in the approach/departure corridors, as well as the air traffic pattern. The use of radar in combination with traditional wildlife observation techniques could significantly increase the amount of information available for analyses during a WHA. At MCAS Cherry Point we used radar observations to document winter waterfowl movements at night (including migration departures) as well as diurnal bird movements. These movements included incursions into the approach/departure corridors and the initial location of the waterfowl presenting the hazard. Although radar has its benefits, such as detecting wildlife at night and greater distances than can be accomplished visually, it also has its shortcomings. These include reduced sensitivity during heavy precipitation (e. g., X- and K-band radars) and the inability to identify the species of the birds detected...|$|E
