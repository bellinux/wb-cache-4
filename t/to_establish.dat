Analyses examined the effect of receptivity to tobacco marketing at baseline on progression <b>to</b> <b>established</b> smoking, controlling for significant covariates. RESULTS: Adolescents who, at baseline, owned a tobacco promotional item and named a brand whose advertisements attracted their attention were {{more than twice as}} likely <b>to</b> become <b>established</b> smokers (odds ratio = 2. 70) than adolescents who did neither. CONCLUSIONS: Participation in tobacco marketing often precedes, and is likely to facilitate, progression <b>to</b> <b>established</b> smoking.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: We {{examined}} {{the impact of}} a statewide antismoking media campaign on progression <b>to</b> <b>established</b> smoking among Massachusetts adolescents. METHODS: We conducted a 4 -year longitudinal survey of 592 Massachusetts youths, aged 12 to 15 years at baseline in 1993. We {{examined the}} effect of baseline exposure to television, radio, and outdoor antismoking advertisements on progression <b>to</b> <b>established</b> smoking (defined as having smoked 100 or more cigarettes), using multiple logistic regression and controlling for age; sex; race; baseline smoking status; smoking by parents, friends, and siblings; television viewing; and exposure to antismoking messages not related to the media campaign. RESULTS: Among younger adolescents (aged 12 to 13 years at baseline), those reporting baseline exposure to television antismoking advertisements were significantly less likely <b>to</b> progress <b>to</b> <b>established</b> smoking (odds ratio = 0. 49, 95 % confidence interval = 0. 26, 0. 93). Exposure to television antismoking advertisements had no effect on progression <b>to</b> <b>established</b> smoking among older adolescents (aged 14 to 15 years at baseline), and there were no effects of exposure to radio or outdoor advertisements. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the television component of the Massachusetts antismoking media campaign may have reduced the rate of progression <b>to</b> <b>established</b> smoking among young adolescents...|$|R
