40|$|ABSTRACT. The Late Cretaceous {{magmatism}} {{controls the}} evolution of the metallogenic processes in the Panagyurishte ore region. The Upper Cretaceous sedimentary and volcanic rocks transgressively overlay the basement of different older rocks. Turonian <b>terrigenous</b> <b>complex,</b> Panagyurishte volcano-sedimentary Group and Popintsi sedimentary Group are distinguished in the Upper Cretaceous section. The coal-bearing and sandstone suites are determined in the Turonian <b>terrigenous</b> <b>complex.</b> The Panagyurishte volcano-sedimentary Group is divided on Chelopech, Vozdol, Petelovo, Vrankamik, Assarel, Ovchepoltsi, Elshitsa and Pesovets Formations. The Popintsi sedimentary Group is compound by the known Mirkovo and Chugovitsa Formations. The paleontological data about the age of the quoted lithostratigraphic units are shown, as well as the data for their absolute age.

40|$|International audienceUpper Oxfordian {{deposits}} in NE Iberian Range, from Hauffianum to Galar biozones, are mainly developed in terrigenous carbonate facies (the so-called Talamantes Member; Aldealpozo Formation), being markedly thicker in the NW {{sector of the}} platform. This <b>terrigenous</b> <b>complex</b> is interpreted as the front part of a pro-delta sedimentary system prograding towards the southeast. From Galar Biozone onwards sedimentation becomes progressively more carbonate. Bivalve associations reveal a progressive replacement of infaunal by epifaunal communities. Similarly, ammonite succession shows the replacement at this point of representatives of Ataxioceratinae genera Orthosphinctes and Subnebrodites by genus Planites. This fact, underlined by the record of Sutneria galar (OPPEL) in the Sot de Chera Formation, makes the Planula-Galar biozone boundary an acceptable possibility for the Oxfordian-Kimmeridgian stage boundary, thus giving further support to recent proposals within the Oxfordian-kimmeridgian boundary Working Group of the ISJS...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{influence}} of natural metal chelators on the bio-available iron input {{to the ocean}} by river water was studied. Ferrous and ferric ions present as suspended colloidal particles maintaining the semblance of a dissolved load are coagulated and settled as their freshwater carrier is mixed with seawater at the continental boundary. However, we might argue that different iron-binding colloids become sequentially destabilized in meeting progressively increasing salinities. By use of a 59 Fe tracer method, the partitioning of the iron load from the suspended and dissolved mobile fraction to storage in the sediments was measured with high accuracy in mixtures of natural river water with artificial sea water. The results show a characteristic sequence of sedimentation. Various colloids of different stability are removed from a water of increasing salinity, {{such as it is}} the case in the transition from a river water to the open sea. However, the iron transport capacities of the investigated river waters differed greatly. A mountainous river in the Austrian Alps would add only about 5 % of its dissolved Fe load, that is about 2. 0 µg L - 1 Fe, to coastal waters. A small tributary draining a sphagnum peat-bog, which acts as a source of refractory low-molecular-weight fulvic acids to the river water, would add approximately 20 % of its original Fe load, that is up to 480 µg L - 1 Fe to the ocean's bio-available iron pool. This points to a natural mechanism of ocean iron fertilization by <b>terrigenous</b> fulvic-iron <b>complexes</b> originating from weathering processes occurring in the soils upstream...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} {{implement}} secondary and enhanced oil recovery processes in <b>complex</b> <b>terrigenous</b> formations as is usual in turbidite deposits, a precise {{knowledge of the}} spatial distribution of shale grains is a crucial element for the fluid flow prediction. The reason {{of this is that}} the interaction of water with shale grains can significantly modify their size and/or shape, which in turn would cause porous space sealing with the subsequent impact in the flow. In this work, a methodology for stochastic simulations of spatial grains distributions obtained from scanning electron microscopy images of siliciclastic rock samples is proposed. The aim of the methodology is to obtain stochastic models would let us investigate the shale grain behavior under various physico-chemical interactions and flux regimes, which in turn, will help us get effective petrophysical properties (porosity and permeability) at core scale. For stochastic spatial grains simulations a plurigaussian method is applied, which is based on the truncation of several standard Gaussian random functions. This approach is very flexible, since it allows to simultaneously manage the proportions of each grain category in a very general manner and to rigorously handle their spatial dependency relationships in the case of two or more grain categories. The obtained results show that the stochastically simulated porous media using the plurigaussian method adequately reproduces the proportions, basic statistics and sizes of the pore structures present in the studied reference images...|$|R
40|$|The lower Vidiakot section (Chitral, Pakistan) {{comprises}} {{the lower part}} (Yarkhun Formation and {{the base of the}} Vidiakot Formation) of the <b>terrigenous</b> <b>complex</b> transgressively overlying the crystalline basement of Northern Karakorum. From this section, 8 of 15 samples contain moderately abundant and poorly preserved acritarchs and rare, badly preserved chitinozoans. Three different palynological assemblages have been distinguished which are referable to the chronological interval early Arenig-earliest Llanvirn. The presence of Arbusculidium, Coryphidium, and Striatotheca in most samples confirms the paleogeographic attribution of the Northern Karakorum Terrane to the northern Gondwana margin (Lower to Middle Ordovician Mediterranean acritarch Palaeoprovince). Refined correlation with other areas and with the previously studied Ishkarwaz section (upper Yarkhun Valley, Chitral) enables the authors the Yarkun Formation to be dated as early Arenig (British lower nitidus graptolite Zone) to latest Arenig (uppermost graptolite hirundo Zone). The base of the overlying Vidiakot Formation is here correlated with the uppermost hirundo - lowermost artus graptolite Zones (latest Arenig-earliest Llanvirn).  </p...|$|E
40|$|The article {{highlights}} {{the problem of}} oil bearing of the Domanic Formation on {{the territory of the}} Republic of Tatarstan. Comparing the geochemical characteristics of bitumen of the Semilukskian horizon and oils of the Eifelian-Frasnian <b>terrigenous</b> <b>complex,</b> it was concluded that in the Semilukskian horizon, mobile bitumen are present along with the syngenetic dispersed matter, which, according to gas-liquid chromatography, are identical to the oil of the underlying terrigenous deposits of the Pashian and Timanian horizons. These bitumens are migratory and reflect the process of upward vertical oil migration, which is responsible for the formation of industrial deposits in the Semilukskian, Sargaevskian, and Rechitskian horizons in those areas where the lithological features of the rocks and the development of superficial fracturing in them make it possible to create a collecting space. The rocks of the Domanic facies should be considered as accumulation or accumulation-generation system, oil deposits of which were formed due to oil systems generated in other sources. New methods of search are needed that allow us to quickly assess the content of migratory hydrocarbons and syngenetic organic matter. This is possible {{on the basis of a}} rapid study of the sludge, which will allow to assess the presence of mobile hydrocarbons and their quantity during drilling. An analysis of the spatial distribution of migratory hydrocarbons will allow localizing oil migration channels...|$|E
