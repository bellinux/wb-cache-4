He then convinces his friends that if they want the economy to be strong, they must have faith in it. Upon hearing of this heresy, Randy and his makeshift economic council decide that they must kill Kyle. Cartman, in his desire to obtain a copy of , says that he will deliver Kyle to Randy and his friends in exchange for the game.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> {{generally}} such as {{to provide}} riches. Neither is it one {{which used to}} require large towns as other than external markets in which to sell. The population is therefore dispersed. The exception to this is the town of Oyonnax, in the Ange valley which is parallel with the Ain. According to the legend, St Léger gave the monopoly of comb making to Oyonnax in 630. The traditional small products of the region, wood-turning, horn combs and trinkets {{led to the development}} of a specialism in the injection moulding, vacuum forming and so on of plastics, beginning with celluloid in 1880. The town's population in 1999 was 24,636 but it is the exception for the river basin (ext links).|$|E

The legal profession {{has a strong}} presence, especially {{in the west and}} north (i.e., towards the Inns of Court). Retail businesses were once important, but have gradually moved to the West End of London, though it is now Corporation policy to encourage retailing in some locations, for example at Cheapside near St Paul's. The City has a number of visitor attractions, mainly based on its historic heritage as well as the Barbican Centre and adjacent Museum of London, though tourism is not at present a major contributor to the City's economy or character. The City has many pubs, bars and restaurants, and the [...] "night-time" [...] economy does feature in the Bishopsgate area, towards Shoreditch. The meat market at Smithfield, wholly within the City, continues to be one of London's main markets (the only one remaining in central London) and the country's largest meat market. In the east is Leadenhall Market, a fresh food market that is also a visitor attraction.|$|E

50|$|Piero Sraffa (1898-1983) came to England from Fascist Italy in the 1920s, {{and became}} a member of the Cambridge Circus. In 1960 he {{published}} a small book called Production of Commodities by Means of Commodities, which explained how technological relationships are the basis for production of goods and services. Prices result from wage-profit tradeoffs, collective bargaining, labour and management conflict and the intervention of government planning. Like Robinson, Sraffa was showing how the major force for price setting in <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> necessarily market adjustments.|$|R
50|$|The term {{originated}} {{to rebut}} {{the idea that}} {{reducing the number of}} hours employees are allowed to labour during the working day would lead to a reduction in unemployment. The term is also commonly used to describe the belief that increasing labour productivity, immigration, or automation cause an increase in unemployment. Whereas some argue immigrants displace domestic workers, others believe this to be a fallacy by arguing that the number of jobs in <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> fixed and that immigration increases the size of the economy, thus creating more jobs.|$|E
50|$|A persistent, large {{output gap}} has severe {{consequences}} for, among other things, a country's labor market, a country's long-run economic potential, and a country's public finances. First, {{the longer the}} output gap persists, the longer the labor market will underperform, as output gaps indicate that workers {{who would like to}} work are instead idled because <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> producing to capacity. The United States' labor market slack is evident in an October 2013 unemployment rate of 7.3 percent, compared with an average annual rate of 4.6 percent in 2007, before the brunt of the recession struck.|$|E

Scotland had been near a vote on devolution before the outbreak of World War I; although economic problems <b>were</b> <b>not</b> new, they <b>were</b> <b>not</b> a case for nationalism before 1914. Governmental intervention was social in nature from 1832 to 1914, when the major issues were social welfare and the educational system.
