5|$|At the 500hPa level, the air <b>temperature</b> averages −7°C (18°F) {{within the}} tropics, but {{air in the}} tropics is {{normally}} dry at this level, giving the air room to wet-bulb, or cool as it moistens, to a more favorable <b>temperature</b> that can then support convection. A wetbulb <b>temperature</b> at 500hPa in a tropical atmosphere of −13.2°C is required to initiate convection if the water <b>temperature</b> is 26.5°C, and this <b>temperature</b> requirement increases or decreases proportionally by 1°C in the sea surface <b>temperature</b> for each 1°C change at 500hpa.|$|E
5|$|The {{biology of}} life {{operates}} {{within a certain}} range of temperatures. Heat {{is a form of}} energy that regulates <b>temperature.</b> Heat affects growth rates, activity, behaviour, and primary production. <b>Temperature</b> is largely dependent on the incidence of solar radiation. The latitudinal and longitudinal spatial variation of <b>temperature</b> greatly affects climates and consequently the distribution of biodiversity and levels of primary production in different ecosystems or biomes across the planet. Heat and <b>temperature</b> relate importantly to metabolic activity. Poikilotherms, for example, have a body <b>temperature</b> that is largely regulated and dependent on the <b>temperature</b> of the external environment. In contrast, homeotherms regulate their internal body <b>temperature</b> by expending metabolic energy.|$|E

5|$|Charging {{an empty}} dive {{cylinder}} also causes a <b>temperature</b> rise as the gas inside the cylinder is compressed by the inflow of higher pressure gas, though this <b>temperature</b> rise may initially be tempered because compressed gas from a storage bank at room <b>temperature</b> decreases in <b>temperature</b> when it decreases in pressure, so {{at first the}} empty cylinder is charged with cold gas, but the <b>temperature</b> of the gas in the cylinder then increases to above ambient as the cylinder fills to the working pressure.|$|E

5|$|Cylinder working {{pressure}} is specified at a reference <b>temperature,</b> usually 15°C or 20°C. and cylinders {{also have a}} specified maximum safe working <b>temperature,</b> often 65°C. The actual pressure in the cylinder will vary with <b>temperature,</b> as described by the gas laws, but this is acceptable {{in terms of the}} standards provided that the developed pressure when corrected to the reference <b>temperature</b> does not exceed the specified {{working pressure}} stamped on the cylinder. This allows cylinders to be safely and legally filled to a pressure that is higher than the specified working pressure when the filling <b>temperature</b> is greater than the reference <b>temperature,</b> but not more than 65°C, provided that the filling pressure does not exceed the developed pressure for that <b>temperature,</b> and cylinders filled according to this provision will be at the correct working pressure when cooled to the reference <b>temperature.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cylinders {{may also}} be filled without water-bath cooling, and may be charged to above the nominal working {{pressure}} to the developed pressure appropriate to the <b>temperature</b> when filled.

5|$|<b>Temperature</b> is {{a measure}} of the kinetic energy of a sample of matter. <b>Temperature</b> is the unique {{physical}} property that determines the direction of heat flow between two objects placed in thermal contact. If no heat flow occurs, the two objects have the same temperature; otherwise heat flows from the hotter object to the colder object. <b>Temperature,</b> within meteorology, is measured with thermometers exposed to the air but sheltered from direct solar exposure. In most of the world, the degree Celsius scale is used for most <b>temperature</b> measuring purposes. However, the United States is the last major country in which the degree Fahrenheit <b>temperature</b> scale is used by most lay people, industry, popular meteorology, and government. Despite this, METAR reports from the United States also report the <b>temperature</b> (and dewpoint, see below) in degrees Celsius.|$|E
