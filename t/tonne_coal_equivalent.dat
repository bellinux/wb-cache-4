40|$|In 2003 China’s energy {{consumption}} amounted to 1678 million <b>tonnes</b> <b>coal</b> <b>equivalent</b> (MTCE), making China the world’s second largest consumer behind only the United States. China is now {{also one of}} the largest oil importers in the world. With an economy which is expected to maintain a rate of growth of 7 to 8 per cent for decades, China’s role in the world energy market becomes increasingly influential. This makes it important to predict China’s future demand for energy. The objective {{of this paper is to}} apply the Bayesian vector autoregressive methodology to forecast China’s {{energy consumption}} and to discuss potential implications. The results of this paper suggest that total energy consumption should increase to 2173 MtCE in 2010, an annual growth rate of 3. 8 per cent which is slightly slower than the average rate in the past decade. The slower growth reflects an expected slower economic growth and the decline in energy consumption due to structural changes in the Chinese economy.

40|$|The {{establishment}} of low-carbon cities {{has been suggested}} all over the World, since cities are key drivers of energy usage and the associated carbon emissions. This paper presents a scenario analysis of future energy consumption and carbon emissions {{for the city of}} Beijing. The Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning (LEAP) model is used to simulate a range of pathways and to analyze how these would change energy consumption and carbon emissions from 2007 to 2030. Three scenarios have been designed to describe future energy strategies in relation to the development of Beijing city, namely a reference scenario (RS), control scenario (CS), and integrated scenario (IS). The results show that under the IS the total energy demand in Beijing is expected to reach 88. 61 million <b>tonnes</b> <b>coal</b> <b>equivalent</b> (Mtce) by 2030 (59. 32 Mtce in 2007), 55. 82 % and 32. 72 % lower than the values under the RS and the CS, respectively. The total carbon emissions in 2030 under the IS, although higher than the 2007 level, will be 62. 22 % and 40. 27 % lower than under the RS and the CS, respectively, with emissions peaking in 2026 and declining afterwards. In terms of the potential for reduction of energy consumption and carbon emissions, the industrial sector will continue to act as the largest contributor under the IS and CS compared with the RS, while the building and transport sectors are identified as promising fields for achieving effective control of energy consumption and carbon emissions over the next two decades. The calculation results show that an integrated package of measures is the most effective in terms of energy savings and carbon emissions mitigation, although it also faces the largest challenge to achieve the related targets...|$|R
30|$|According to the BP Statistical Review of World Energy (2015 a), China is the world’s largest energy consumer, {{with the}} total energy {{consumption}} of about 4.3 billion <b>tonnes</b> of <b>coal</b> <b>equivalent,</b> which accounts for about 23  % of the world’s total energy consumption. Although coal consumption still accounts for an absolutely dominant proportion, about 66  % of the total energy consumption, oil consumption accounts for 17.5  %, and natural gas accounts for 5.6  % in 2014 (BP 2015 a). Plans aiming to adjust China’s energy structure are already on schedule. The State Council of China has claimed that by 2020, natural gas consumption is planned to account for 10  % of the primary energy consumption, the proportion of non-fossil fuel consumption {{would be more than}} 15  %, and the proportion of coal consumption should be controlled to below 62  % (State Council of China 2014). To successfully achieve the goal, it is urgent to take effective actions to reduce carbon emissions, to fully explore the potential of natural gas and non-fossil energy, and to have clean energy sources as feasible alternatives.|$|R

40|$|Input-output {{analysis}} {{has been proven}} to be a powerful instrument for estimating embodied (direct plus indirect) energy usage through economic sectors. Using 9 economic input-output tables of years 1987, 1990, 1992, 1995, 1997, 2000, 2002, 2005, and 2007, this paper analyzes energy flows for the entire city of Beijing and its 30 economic sectors, respectively. Results show that the embodied energy consumption of Beijing increased from 38. 85 million <b>tonnes</b> of <b>coal</b> <b>equivalent</b> (Mtce) to 206. 2 Mtce over the past twenty years of rapid urbanization; the share of indirect energy consumption in total energy consumption increased from 48 % to 76 %, suggesting the transition of Beijing from a production-based and manufacturing-dominated economy to a consumption-based and service-dominated economy. Real estate development has shown to be a major driving factor of the growth in indirect energy consumption. The boom and bust of construction activities have been strongly correlated with the increase and decrease of system-side indirect energy consumption. Traditional heavy industries remain the most energy-intensive sectors in the economy. However, the transportation and service sectors have contributed most to the rapid increase in overall energy consumption. The analyses in this paper demonstrate that a system-wide approach such as that based on input-output model can be a useful tool for robust energy policy making...|$|R
30|$|China has {{achieved}} {{rapid economic growth}} since beginning its reform and opening up in the 1980 s, with an average annual GDP growth rate of 9.8 % from 1978 to 2014 (NBSC 2015). China has now become the second-largest {{economy in the world}} after the USA. This great achievement could not have been possible without high energy consumption. From 1978 to 2014, China’s total annual energy consumption increased from just over 570 million <b>tonnes</b> of <b>coal</b> <b>equivalent</b> per year (Mtce/year) to 4260  Mtce/year, representing an average annual growth rate of 5.8 % (NBSC 2015). Moreover, most of this energy has been from fossil fuels. In 2014, for example, China’s total fossil fuel consumption was 3780  Mtce/year (coal, 2810  Mtce; oil, 730  Mtce; gas, 240  Mtce), accounting for just under 90 % of total energy consumption (the remaining 10 % is renewable energy) (NBSC 2015). A large number of studies have indicated that fossil fuels will continue to dominate China’s energy consumption and that demand for these fuels will keep increasing in future, although the rate of this increase may be much lower than in the past, and the structure may also be changed (i.e. stabilizing oil’s share, increasing gas’s share, and reducing coal’s share in primary energy use) (Yuan et al. 2016; IEA 2014). It is thus very important for China to understand its supply status in terms of fossil fuel resources.|$|R

By the time of July, 2016, EU-ETS is the worlds largest carbon trading system, with a carbon market of two billion tonnes per year. the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) announced that eight sectors would be included in this market, these eight sectors are petrochemicals, chemicals, building materials, steel, ferrous metals, paper-making, power-generation and aviation.
