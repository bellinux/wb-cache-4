40|$|Abstract. We {{analyze the}} design of optimal {{environmental}} policy when environmental damage is uncertain and investments in abatement technologies are irreversible. We assume that the investment in the new abatement technology {{can be used for}} two periods and that the true extent of environmental damage will become known in the second period. Consistent with intuition, we find that an increase in expected damage unambiguously calls for higher environmental taxes (or <b>tradeable</b> <b>emission</b> <b>permit</b> prices) in period 2. However, taxes should be reduced in period 1 if firms are sufficiently homogeneous. JEL classification: D 80, D 92, Q 20.

40|$|This paper investigates {{in detail}} the design {{parameters}} {{of the two most}} prominent U. S. <b>tradeable</b> <b>emission</b> <b>permit</b> program - the U. S. EPA Sulfur Allowance Trading Program and the South Californian Regional Clean Air Incentives Market (RECLAIM). In contrast to expectations and the existing literature the two programs turn out to be rather different in several important design parameter choices. Common elements emerge primarily in the existence of an ambitious, quantified environmental target, stringent emission monitoring methods and high penalties for non-compliance, the importance of a competitive permit market, and some compromises necessary in order to gain political acceptability for the instrument and program. ...|$|E

The discussion of how to manage air-quality in an era of shrinking public budgets and the trend towards deregulation has led to a rethinking of the present system in the urban region of Vienna. This paper is an attempt to contribute to these considerations by a comparative study of the "command&control" type of system operative in Austria (as regulated in the Austrian "Clean Air Act") and the new <b>tradeable</b> <b>emission</b> <b>permit</b> approach introduced in the urban region of Los Angeles (L. A.), California (the so called RECLAIM program) to reduce SOx and NOx emissions from stationary sources. The study utilized a survey of companies included in the respective pollution control programs in L. A. and Vienna, experts as well as administrators active in air quality management as a data base for the analysis. The survey is based on a mix of written responses to a questionnaire as well as personal interviews (conducted in 1996 and 97). Three main issues constituted the core of the analysis investigating {{the pros and cons of}} the approaches in practice: ? How much flexibility and discretionary latitude do the different policy systems grant the decision makers in the companies in the program to adopt the most efficient response to the request to reduce emissions? ? Which cost implications do the different systems have for the companies and the public management bodies? ? Which stimuli are provided in the long-run to innovate and promote emission reducing technical progress? Additionally the question was adressed which institutional changes were considered to have been the most troublesome in phasing out the old "command&control" type of system in L. A. and introducing the new RECLAIM program in 1994. Some basic propositions are developed how to introduce a tradeable permit system in the Vienna urban region. The results of the study do partly confirm some of the theses found in the theoretical literature, but offer additional insights on the institutional as well as political problems of intoducing a tradable emissions` permit scheme. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We compare three {{different}} {{views on the}} long run efficiencies of emission taxes which include thresholds (inframarginal exemptions), and of <b>tradeable</b> <b>emission</b> <b>permits</b> where some permits are initially free. The differences are caused by different assumptions about whether thresholds and free permits should be subsidies given only to firms that produce, or full property rights.

Such flexibility could be very important in achieving efficient control of greenhouse gas emissions. Key words: efficiency, emission taxes, exemptions, thresholds, tradeable permit...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} paper, we analyse the {{interaction}} of a competitive market for <b>emission</b> <b>permits</b> with an oligopolistic product market. It {{is well known that}} a competitive permits market achieves the cost minimizing distribution of abatement effort among the polluting firms for a given reduction in emissions. However, when the product market is oligopolistic, it may redistribute production inefficiently among firms. It has been suggested that this inefficiency can outweigh the gains obtained from using <b>emission</b> <b>permits</b> instead of command and control. Although this argument is clearly correct under full information, it is shown in the present paper that it reverses under incomplete information.

40|$|When {{the market}} of {{tradable}} <b>emissions</b> <b>permits</b> is perfectly competitive, free allocation of permits through some discretionary rules corresponds to lump sum transfers and cannot have strategic effects. This conclusion is reversed when transactions costs are {{introduced in the}} TEP market. Transactions costs proportional {{to the value of}} permits exchanged create a gap between selling and the buying price, thus resulting in lower opportunity costs for the holder of excess permits. This can be effectively exploited by a government in order to encourage its firm to gain larger share in an international market. When costs per transaction are fixed, the above effects disappear for those firms participating in the market. For small firms, however, participation may be prohibitively expensive, turning the opportunity cost of any permits hold, equal to zero. This suggests that free permits may create strategic effects within the hands of small firms but not when granted to larger firms. <b>Tradeable</b> <b>Emissions</b> <b>Permits,</b> strategic trade policy. ...|$|R
40|$|On {{the agenda}} of {{environmental}} problems, the enhanced greenhouse effect has nowadays acquired a prominent place. Although {{there is still much}} uncertainty about its extent and its consequences, there is an important rationale for addressing the possible problem of climate change now: whatever the specific consequences may be, they are to a large extent determined by the actions we take (or do not take) today. Emissions from greenhouse gases will determine the atmospheric concentrations of these gases for centuries to come. Because of the increase in anthropogenic CO 2 emissions, starting with the industrial revolution and the rise in the use of fossil fuels which it has caused, the concentration of CO 2 in the atmosphere has risen by 25 percent since 1750. If we want to limit the increase of CO 2 concentrations, action must be taken now. Within the broad area of research on climate change, one specific strand of economic research has focused on {{the problem of how to}} reduce emissions from greenhouse gases, especially the emission of carbondioxide, which is the main greenhouse gas. Taking as a starting point the assumption that a CO 2 emission reduction target has been set, the objective of these studies is to determine the optimal way of reducing these emissions. From the start, it has been pointed out by environmental economists that economic instruments are suitable for implementing a policy of reducing emissions of greenhouse gases. With economic instruments, emissions will be reduced in an efficient manner, according to the theory. This has been argued and illustrated in a large number of studies which deal with economic instruments like taxes or charges and <b>tradeable</b> <b>emission</b> <b>permits</b> (see e. g. Barrett 1992, UNCTAD 1992, OECD 1992 a and 1992 b, Smith 1992). In this study, the instrument of <b>tradeable</b> carbon <b>emission</b> <b>permits</b> (TCP’s) is studied in more detail. The central issue is: the design of a feasible system of TCP’s and the study of the consequences of implementing such a system. Up till now, the focus of research in this area has been predominantly on the efficiency of reducing CO 2 emissions by means of <b>tradeable</b> <b>emission</b> <b>permits</b> or taxes. Less attention has been paid to the design of such a system, which is the subject of chapter 2. In this chapter the outlines are sketched of a feasible system of <b>tradeable</b> <b>emission</b> <b>permits</b> for the European Union. The proposed system is in essence a system of (carbon in) fuel rationing with tradeability of quota between citizens. Points under consideration are a. o. the characteristics of the fuel permit, the distribution of the permits (either the government sells them or gives them away for free), the market allocation of the permits, the time path by which the number of permits available is reduced, monitoring and enforcement of the system and the consequences which a system of <b>tradeable</b> <b>emission</b> <b>permits</b> might have for business location choice. Moreover it is studied whether a system of TCP’s can operate on a national base in one member state of the European Union or if it should be implemented at the European level. Last, the requirements of a EU-wide system are sketched. A study of the implications of reducing CO 2 emissions by means of TCP’s (or any other instrument) can not be complete without studying the economic consequences of such a system. To predict some of the consequences of introducing an instrument like TCP’s in an industry a micro-economic approach is necessary in which the influence on one or more facets of economic behaviour is studied in detail. For example, attention has been given to the potential misuse of market power in the permit market (see Tietenberg 1985 and Hahn 1984). On the other hand hardly any attention has been paid up till now to the possible effects of <b>tradeable</b> <b>emission</b> <b>permits</b> on entry into industries. This is especially interesting because it has been practice to grandfather permits to existing sources while new sources, potential entrants, have to buy them. Many people, and even economists have the intuition that in particular such a system of grandfathering will erect barriers to potential entrants, whereas a system of auctioning permits to all firms, established ones and entrants, would not have such an impact, or at least a much weaker negative effect on entry. In chapter 3 and 4 it is analyzed how far this idea is true. The question is addressed whether, how and to what extent a system of tradeable permits might create barriers to entry in the product market. Several forms of entry barriers which might be caused or increased by tradeable permits are identified and analyzed. Subsequently, it is studied whether these forms of entry barriers are likely to occur in the system of TCP’s which is outlined in chapter 2. An effort is made to determine to what extent entry will be affected when entry barriers are raised due to the TCP system. The above questions are important, not only from a static point of view, but also if a dynamic view is taken. If a TCP-system for reducing CO 2 emissions raises entry barriers, it will affect the whole economy, affecting long-term industry dynamics. This in turn might reduce the efforts on research and development and reduce economic activity and efficiency in the longer run in the whole economy. The approach taken here is to study the micro-economic consequences of a system of tradeable carbon permits with respect to entry barriers, both with grandfathering and with auctioning of CO 2 <b>emission</b> <b>permits.</b> The results will be compared with the results achieved under two other instruments, taxes and standards. The possible occurrence of entry barriers is analyzed both theoretically and empirically. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the issue of whether the power of allocating <b>tradeable</b> <b>emission</b> <b>permits</b> within a federal system (or an {{economic}} union) should be centralized or delegated to the single states/nations. To this end, we develop a simple two stage game played by two governments and their respective industries producing a homogeneous output that is sold in a third country. We show that when <b>emission</b> <b>permits</b> are traded competitively at a federal (or economic union) level, a decentralized emission trading system (DETS) would result in a lower than optimal price of permits, as well as in an aggregate emission target which is larger than the socially optimal target that would arise under a centralized system (CETS). This result partly hinges on standard international externality considerations; on the other hand, we find a new "channel" through which decentralized permits distribution could lead to distortions: under a DETS, national governments play a Cournot game, and choose the amount of allowances to be distributed to domestic firms without accounting for the spillover such distribution generates on the other country via the price of allowances...|$|R
40|$|This paper explores {{abatement}} {{investment and}} location responses to environmental policy, which {{takes the form}} of <b>emission</b> taxes or <b>tradeable</b> <b>emission</b> <b>permits</b> and subsidies against the costs of abatement investment, under uncertainty and irreversibility.

Uncertainty is modeled by It“ stochastic differential equations, and the problem is analyzed by using optimal stopping methodologies. Continuation intervals during which firms do not engage in abatement investment or relocate and intervals during which firms take the irreversible decision of undertaking abatement expenses or relocating are defined. Free boundaries are characterized for a variety of cases that include output price uncertainty expressed both in terms of continuous fluctuations of permit prices and unpredictable policy changes, and combined policy and technological uncertainty. An optimal environmental policy is defined as the combination of policy parameters that makes the free boundary corresponding to the profit maximization problem coincide with the free boundary corresponding to a social optimization problem. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to show how to initiate a market for carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases by introducing a feasible system of <b>tradeable</b> <b>emission</b> <b>permits,</b> which can be applied as an efficient instrument of environmental policy in single countries and in the whole European Community after the EC internal market is in force. Part one of the paper summarizes the relevant framework conditions of the CO 2 problem and briefly reviews possible instruments for CO 2 control. Based on this, part two develops an alternative to traditional permit systems. It describes the notion of <b>tradeable</b> <b>emission</b> coupons and applies this concept to CO 2 emissions. It deals with the intertemporal allocation of CO 2 emissions, opts for the initial distribution of CO 2 coupons by auction, stipulates the carbon content of fuel as the assessment base, selects importers and producers as the appropriate addressees of the coupon system for CO 2 and solves the (system's initial) problem with end-of-pipe technologies. Finally, it shows how to extend the coupon system to other greenhouse gases. Part three of the paper studies the performance of the system in the framework of the EC's future internal market. And finally, part four deals with a possible application of the emission coupon system to pollutants other than greenhouse gases. ...|$|R
40|$|Markets {{are often}} {{considered}} {{enemies of the}} environment. A traditional view is that environmental issues are grounded on market externalities because, in cases such as smoking, one individual's consumption is irrevocably linked to those of others. This leads to ill defined private choices and {{to the failure of}} market efficiency. Markets can therefore induce overconsumption of environmental resources, such as clean air. Reciprocally, environmental concerns are often blamed for undermining market performance. Environmental regulation can lead to undue costs and prevent the unfettered behavior needed for achieving market efficiency. Yet recent evidence points in the opposite direction. Markets have evolved some of the most innovative and useful solutions for global environment problems. This includes new and profitable products such as catalytic converters, industrial scrubbers and waste management technologies, as well as new financial instruments such as <b>tradeable</b> <b>emission</b> <b>permits,</b> profit - sharing environmental ventures, and debt for nature swaps. One observes a groundswell of positive interest in the environment arising from all levels of the business community.

40|$|The term ‘discourse’ {{can have}} {{different}} {{applications in the}} social and policy sciences to refer variously to generalised ideas, beliefs and assertions. In particular there is a clear difference between discourse as knowledge and discourse as ideology. Epistemically the two are very different, with each making different types of claim. The paper examines the influence of an ideological discourse on international forest policy, namely neoliberalism. A variant of classical liberalism, neoliberalism emphasises an increased role for markets, an enhanced role for the private sector and voluntary regulation. It is argued that all three of these principles have systemically penetrated the international soft law on forests that has been negotiated since 1992 and up and including the 2007 Non-Legally Binding Instrument on all Types of Forests. Neoliberal policies also underpin forest certification schemes and the <b>tradeable</b> <b>emission</b> <b>permits</b> systems adopted under the Kyoto Protocol and the European Union's Emissions Trading Scheme. Adopting a Foucauldian approach the paper views the construction of neoliberal discourse and its reiteration in the forests issue area as an expression of power that establishes the limits of international forest policy, tending towards certain policies and inhibiting the selection of others. It is argued that contrary to what is often asserted, neoliberalism depends on a strong state, one that introduces market-based disciplines to new areas and creates political space that can be occupied by private sector businesses...|$|R

40|$|JOHN QUIGGIN {{spells out}} the {{arguments}} for <b>tradeable</b> <b>emissions</b> <b>permits</b> NOW that nearly everyone is agreed {{on the need for}} a market-based policy instrument to reduce CO 2 emissions, the biggest unresolved question is whether to implement carbon taxes, <b>tradeable</b> <b>emissions</b> <b>permits</b> or some hybrid of the two. I support tradeable permits, but I’ve never really spelt out my reasons for doing so. It’s important before doing this to observe that {{the differences between the two}} approaches are more limited than most of the discussion suggests. Both ensure the existence of a price for CO 2 emissions and both can be set up to distribute the costs of emissions in a lot of different ways. That said, tradeable permits have some significant advantages in my view. I have three main reasons for preferring permits, which I will list in order of significance. First, while the natural starting point for both systems is one in which the government collects the entire implied value of emissions, either as tax revenue or as the proceeds from auctioning <b>permits,</b> the <b>emissions</b> trading system allows for (but doesn’t require) free allocation of some permits. Particularly in transitional stages when not all sources are covered, this can be used to offset unanticipated distributional consequences of the scheme, and thereby increase its political feasibility. * It’s important not to issue too many free permits, as was done with the first round in the European Union, but some limited issue might be beneficial. I don’t want to overstress this point as much the same outcome can be achieved by paying cash compensation out of tax revenue. Second, since we are uncertain about the elasticity of demand for emissions we are faced with a choice between allowing this uncertainty to be reflected in uncertainty about reaching the targeted level of reductions in emissions, uncertainty about the price, or some mixture of the two. Given the risk that we will fail altogether if individual countries fall short of their targets, I’d prefer some uncertainty about the price. Third, and most importantly, the ultimate solution has to be an international agreement to reduce emissions in the most cost-effective way possible. The obvious way to do this is through the creation of international markets for <b>emissions</b> <b>permits.</b> Although a full-scale global market might be some way off, regional or multiregional markets linked through something like the existing Clean Development Mechanism could be set up reasonably easily. By contrast, I can’t see how, in a world of sharply varying exchange rates, it would be possible to set up a coordinated global system of carbon taxes. I should say, though, that Warwick McKibbin had a piece arguing for something like this in the 7 July edition of the Australian Financial Review. Whether or not these arguments are conclusive, it seems pretty certain that emissions trading (perhaps with some modest hybrid elements) is the way we are going to go. At this point, it’s more important to push for urgent action than to get hung up in disputes about the details. • * Obviously, if you’re strongly opposed to any compensation of existing emitters and are prepared to risk total failure rather than concede on point, this is a disadvantage rather than an advantage.

40|$|This paper uses {{analytical}} and numerical general equilibrium models {{to study the}} costs of achieving pollution reductions under a range of environmental policy instruments in a second-best setting with pre-existing factor taxes. We compare the costs and efficiency impacts of emissions taxes, emissions quotas, fuels taxes, performance standards, and mandated technologies, and explore how costs change with the magnitude of pre-existing taxes {{and the extent of}} pollution abatement. We find that the presence of distortionary taxes raises the costs of pollution abatement under each instrument relative to its costs in a first-best world. This extra cost is an increasing function of the magnitude of pre-existing tax rates. For plausible values of pre-existing tax rates and other parameters, the cost increase for all policies is substantial (35 % or more). The impact of pre-existing taxes is large for non-auctioned emissions quotas, the cost increase can be several hundred percent. Earlier work on instrument choice emphasized the potential reduction in compliance cost from converting fixed <b>emissions</b> quotas into <b>tradeable</b> <b>emissions</b> <b>permits.</b> Our results show the regulator's decision to auction or grandfather emissions rights can have important cost impacts. Similarly, the choice of how to recycle revenues from environmentally motivated taxes can be as important to cost as whether the tax takes the form of an emissions tax or fuel tax, particularly when modest emissions reductions are involved. In both first- and second-best settings, the cost differences across instruments depend on the extent of pollution abatement under consideration. Total abatement costs differ markedly at low levels of abatement. Strikingly, for all instruments except the fuel tax these costs converge to the same value as abatement levels approach 100 percent. ...|$|R
40|$|Using {{a simple}} {{analytical}} model incorporating costs and benefits, stock decay, time discounting, and uncertainty, we uncover several important principles governing {{the choice of}} price-based policies (e. g., taxes) relative to quantity-based policies (e. g., tradeable permits) for controlling stock externalities. As in Weitzman (1974), the relative slopes of the marginal benefits and costs of controlling the externality continue to be critical determinants of the efficiency of prices relative to quantities, with flatter marginal benefits and steeper marginal costs favoring prices. But we can say more. The relative slopes also help determine the optimal control path, with convergence to a steady state proceeding slowly as long as marginal benefits are relatively flat. On this basis we conclude that the conditions typically characterizing long-lived stock externalities—in particular, that the optimal control path involves long-term changes in the stock level—tend to favor price-based policies. While this result holds {{over a wide range}} of conditions, it depends on several key variables. Positive correlation of cost shocks across time, in particular, as well as low rates of time discounting and stock decay, will tilt the balance back toward quantity controls. These results are potentially applicable {{to a wide range of}} market failures involving stock externalities. In addition to the obvious application to stock pollutants, one can view species preservation, land-use policy, education, and research as areas where policymakers wish to regulate a stock-like externality. This analysis provides a useful framework for comparing alternative policy instruments for regulating such problems. Regarding climate change, for example, these results suggest that the use of <b>tradeable</b> <b>emission</b> <b>permits</b> rather than <b>emission</b> fees to slow growth in the stock of greenhouse gases is probably inefficient. Optimal policy would involve either tradeable permits that quickly stabilize the stock, or emission fees that gradually slow its growth. ...|$|R
40|$|In December 1997, 34 industrialized {{countries}} signed the Kyoto Protocol committing to targets and timetables to reduce 6 greenhouse gases (GHGs). Why {{were the only}} signatories {{industrialized countries}}? Two reasons are usually put forth. The first is pragmatism, in that only this group, as opposed to developing countries, can afford the costs of mitigating GHGs. Still, this explanation is imperfect since 12 of the signatories are transitional economies of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. The second reason is fairness, in that industrialized countries {{are responsible for the}} vast majority of the GHGs already built-up in the atmosphere and are responsible for over 60 % of the current emissions. The fairness explanation is further supported by the fact that "differentiation" was invoked in Kyoto, i. e., not all signatories agreed to equal cutbacks, several citing special economic circumstances. In the future, both pragmatism and fairness will be relevant to the question of when and how developing countries will sign a global GHG agreement. Another major influence will be the pursuit of economic efficiency or, at least, cost-effectiveness, i. e., making sure that the targets are met at the lowest global cost. This can be fine-tuned in future agreements by the use of incentive-based instruments and the timing of commitments. Efficiency may also be affected by relative burden-sharing, since this will influence the number of countries that make mitigation commitments in the future. The purpose of this paper is to analyze fairness, or equity, aspects of the current Kyoto Protocol and its extension to a truly global agreement that includes developing countries. This is done in the context of a policy approach gaining increasing favor - <b>tradeable</b> <b>emission</b> <b>permits.</b> A dynamic model of intercountry CO 2 permit trading is used to address the following questions: 1) To what extent does permit trading lower global CO 2 mitigation costs? 2) How are intercountry welfare impacts influenced by alternative permit distributions according to various equity criteria? 3) How might developing countries be brought into the agreement without requiring CO 2 reductions, yet promoting global efficiency gains by utilizing their relatively lower cost mitigation capabilities? 4) To what extent does allowing for permit trading over time further lower global mitigation costs? 5) How are intercountry welfare impacts distinguished by not just static definitions of equity but also dynamic versions, such as sustainability criteria?...|$|R

40|$|The {{textbook}} economists' {{model of}} a tradable permit system cannot usually be applied perfectly at either the domestic or international scale {{because of the difficulty}} and/or expense of defining allocations to and monitoring emissions of some groups, as well as for political reasons. It may be impossible to bring these groups fully into a tradeable permit system but it is often possible to find compromise solutions to gain some benefits from trade. This paper explores this problem {{in the context of the}} Joint Implementation mechanism associated with the Kyoto Protocol. This paper starts by outlining the current international rules governing Joint Implementation. We provide a summary of key jargon for those who are unfamiliar with the complex Kyoto language. We then discuss two key international issues that are still unresolved: baseline development and monitoring. We then turn to domestic governance of Joint Implementation and how the private sector might engage in Joint Implementation. At this point we consider how Joint Implementation fits within the suite of Kyoto flexibility mechanisms, why sellers and buyers might choose to engage in each, and how the different mechanisms might interact in the market for tradeable units. We conclude with some thoughts about productive directions for future research. Climate, Joint Implementation, <b>tradeable</b> <b>permits,</b> <b>emissions</b> trading...|$|R
40|$|Green {{taxes are}} used widely {{overseas}} and increasingly in Australia. There are four main categories. 1. Taxes, levies, fees and other charges, including development taxes, rezoning charges, emission charges, emission licence fees, environmental protection charges, input taxes, resource rents and royalties, sliding charges for utilities, and product levies. 2. Tradeable, bankable and marketable rights and credits, including <b>tradeable</b> <b>emission</b> rights, emission reduction credits, transferable development credits, tradeable resource quotas, and <b>tradeable</b> <b>emission</b> leases. 3. Other economic instruments such as refundable deposits, performance bonds and guarantess, and subsidies, 4. Income tax concessions and differential sales taxes and import duties. Recent High Court authority suggests that whilst {{some of these}} instrucments would be excises and hence could be imposed only by the Commonwealth, most could also be imposed by state government and some also by local government.

40|$|This report {{describes}} the Dutch transport scenarios for the OECD project on Environmental Sustainable Transport (EST). The EST project contains a business-as-usual scenario (BAU) and three EST scenarios which attain the EST criteria (i. e. {{a reduction of}} CO 2 by 80 %, NOx by 90 %, VOC by 90 %, PM 10 by 90 %) : (i) a "high-technology" scenario containing only technological changes, (ii) a "mobility-management" scenario containing only mobility changes, (iii) a combination scenario containing a combination of technological and mobility changes. Furthermore, the report describes possible instrument packages {{for the implementation of}} EST and the social and economic impacts of EST. The main conclusions are: (1) only if a high increase in technological developments and/or very stringent behaviour adaptations and changes in spatial and economic structures at the national and international level are assumed, the EST criteria can be met, (2) if EST is to be realised, measures will have to be taken in the short term and innovative policy instruments must be developed and implemented. The implementation of the <b>tradeable</b> CO 2 <b>emission</b> <b>permit</b> system for passenger and freight transport is crucial for the attainment of EST, (3) a timely implementation of the policy instruments for the attainment of EST means that the current policy life cycle must radically change, (4) the level of material wealth (expressed in GDP) and employment will be somewhat slower in EST compared to BAU, but several social factors will improve. Firstly, differences between societal groups in (a) travel behaviour, (b) the level of accessibility of economic and social opportunities and (c) (perceived) environmental quality will decrease. Secondly, the level of motorised transport will be strongly reduced which will improve traffic safety and reduce health problems caused by local air pollution and noise nuisance from road traffic and aviation...|$|R

Emphasis is on the principles for the allocation of <b>emission</b> <b>permits</b> to firms, and in particular on the role of free <b>emission</b> <b>permits</b> in the design of environmental policies. It is shown that to allocate <b>emission</b> <b>permits</b> free of charge to certain firms may play a potentially important role in the design of environmental policies. When the allocation criteria are carefully chosen, the use of free <b>emission</b> <b>permits</b> might ensure both higher national welfare and a better environment...|$|R

The three mechanisms considered were a combinatorial sealed bid (CSB) auction, a sequential English clock (SEC) auction, and a combinatorial English clock (CEC) auction. We find the SEC and CEC mechanisms to be superior the CSB when demand is relatively elastic. <b>Tradeable</b> <b>emission</b> allowances Combinatorial auctions Experimental economics...|$|R
40|$|A {{game between}} governments that solve {{environmental}} problems through tradable <b>emission</b> <b>permits</b> is analysed. We find that emission levels are chosen according to Pigouvian rule, while internationally mobile firms may receive free <b>emission</b> <b>permits</b> as a location incentive. The equilibrium number of free <b>emission</b> <b>permits</b> {{is shown to}} depend on the type of environmental problem (local vs. global), the effect of firm entry on abatement costs {{in the rest of the}} economy, whether <b>emission</b> <b>permits</b> are internationally tradable or not, and the existing level of profit taxes. The introduction of tradable <b>emissions</b> <b>permits</b> fundamentally changes previous results in the literature on endogenous plant location. For instance, the NIMBY (Not In My Back Yard) type of environmental policy will no longer be implemented...|$|R
40|$|Three topics {{dominate}} the formulation an international greenhouse-gas regime {{as part of}} an effective global environmental policy. Efficiency, equity, and uncertainty. And three major policy instruments are discussed as regards the implementation of the 1992 Framework Convention on Climate Change: A carbon tax/C 02 -charge, joint implementation, and <b>tradeable</b> <b>emission</b> certificates. This paper tries to answer a question that has not been rigidly asked before: How could <b>tradeable</b> <b>emission</b> certificates be tailored {{in such a way as}} to be of benefit to the developing countries, to facilitate global environmental protection and economic development at the same time, and to meet both the efficiency and the equity criterion in international relations. Next to market organization and rules of procedure, allocation of the entitlements is crucial. The author suggests a dynamic formulae, by which the initial allocation of certificates starts on the basis of current greenhouse-gas emissions but over time turns towards equity in the form of equal per capita emissions. In this way, making <b>emission</b> entitlements <b>tradeable</b> among countries implies not only that a globally effective limit to total emissions is attained with certainty, but also that the current unfair allocation of emission entitlements is consecutively shifted in favour of the poor countries.

We also examine the optimality of a transferable <b>emissions</b> <b>permit</b> system when abatement costs and enforcement costs are considered. We show that under incomplete information, regulation based on each firm-specific emissions standards cannot be less costly than a transferable <b>emissions</b> <b>permit</b> system. In addition, we find that the distribution of emissions that minimize aggregate program costs differ from the distribution of emissions generated by a competitive transferable <b>emissions</b> <b>permit</b> system. environmental policy, cost-effectiveness, enforcement costs, incomplete information...|$|R
