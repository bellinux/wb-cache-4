5|$|Richard Nixon's jowly, beard-shadowed face, the {{ski-jump}} {{nose and}} the widow's peak, the arms upstretched in the V-sign, {{had been so}} often pictured and caricatured, his presence had become such a familiar one in the land, {{he had been so}} often in the heat of controversy, <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> to realize the nation really would not 'have Nixon to kick around anymore'.|$|E
5|$|According to {{consolidated}} {{figures the}} episode was watched by 3.28 million viewers on its BBC two debut, aggregated to 4.74 million viewers after {{taking into consideration}} two repeat broadcasts the same week. Reviews of the episode ranged from mostly negative to very positive. Most commentators praised the larger role of Rhys in the episode, the performance of actor Kai Owen and the realism of the acting and dialogue overall. However, {{a large proportion of}} reviewers criticised the special effects used to create the alien and it was subsequently compared by some to resembling a sock puppet or hand puppet. Whilst some reviewers identified with the plight of the alien, others felt that its poor realisation meant <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> to feel any sympathy for it.|$|E

25|$|According to {{the award-winning}} 2004 BBC {{documentary}} The Power of Nightmares, al-Qaeda was so weakly linked together <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> {{to say it}} existed apart from bin Laden and a small clique of close associates. The lack of any significant numbers of convicted al-Qaeda members, despite {{a large number of}} arrests on terrorism charges, was cited by the documentary as a reason to doubt whether a widespread entity that met the description of al-Qaeda existed.|$|E

25|$|There {{were reports}} of drunken grave-diggers making graves for Ebola {{patients}} too shallow, {{and as a}} result wildlife came and dug up and ate at the corpses. In addition, in some cases bodies were not buried for days, because no one came to collect them. One problem was <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> to care for local health care workers, and there was not enough money to evacuate them. Meanwhile, other diseases like malaria, pneumonia, and diarrhea were not being treated properly because the health system was trying to deal with Ebola patients. On 7 October 2014 Canada sent a C-130 loaded with 128,000 face shields to Freetown.|$|E
25|$|The type of {{railroad}} tie {{used on the}} predecessors of the first true railway (Liverpool and Manchester Railway) consisted {{of a pair of}} stone blocks laid into the ground, with the chairs holding the rails fixed to those blocks. One advantage of this method of construction was that it allowed horses to tread the middle path without the risk of tripping. In railway use with ever heavier locomotives, it was found <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> to maintain the correct gauge. The stone blocks were in any case unsuitable on soft ground, such as at Chat Moss, where timber ties had to be used. Bi-block ties with a tie rod are somewhat similar.|$|E
25|$|TLATA {{came into}} force on 1 January 1997 {{and was a}} result of a {{recognised}} need for reform in the part of the Law of Property Act 1925 which dealt with trusts. Some problems included the fact <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> to establish a trust without it coming {{under the auspices of the}} Settled Land Act 1925, which brought with it a range of problems. In particular, the co-owners of property were regarded as having beneficial interests in money and not in the land. Problems arose where partners disagreed over when they wanted to sell a property – usually in the case of separation, and this led to situations where spouses and children might find themselves homeless.|$|E

You take up another one, and that too <b>is</b> <b>hard,</b> green, and sour. The shopman offers you a third; but, before biting it, you examine <b>it,</b> and find <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> and green, and you immediately say that you will not have it, as <b>it</b> must <b>be</b> sour, like those that you have already tried.|$|R
25|$|In 1069, Vijayabahu I of Ceylon asked Anawrahta for aid {{against the}} Chola invaders from Tamil country. Anawrahta sent ships of {{supplies}} in aid of Buddhist Ceylon. In 1071, Vijayabahu who had defeated the Cholas asked Anawrahta for scriptures and monks. The Chola invasions {{had left the}} original home of Theravada Buddhism with so few monks <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> to convene a chapter and make valid ordinations. Anawrahta sent the monks and scriptures, and a white elephant as present for Vijayabahu. The Burmese monks ordained or re-ordained the entire clergy of the island. In return, the Ceylonese king gave {{a replica of the}} Buddha Tooth of which Ceylon was the proud possessor. The replica was then enshrined in the Lawkananda Pagoda in Pagan.|$|E
25|$|Internal {{beta testing}} of the game within Blizzard began in 2012. A closed beta was {{launched}} in August 2013, while the game was put into open beta in January 2014. These beta testing periods were {{used to evaluate the}} game's balance, adjusting cards they found to be too powerful or too weak, and making sure no single Hero or deck type dominated the game. As they approached the game's release in March 2014, Blizzard found <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> to generate interest in getting people to try the game, believing that once they tried it they would be drawn into the game; those they asked to try the game felt that Hearthstone wasn't the type of game they would be interested in playing. At this point, Blizzard opted to make Hearthstone free to play supported by microtransactions for less patient players. This helped to significantly boost the game's popularity on release.|$|E
25|$|COR {{was founded}} in November 1952. Before <b>that,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> to get legitimately kosher meat in Toronto {{because there was no}} regulation. The Canadian Jewish Congress was asked to set up a system to ensure {{legitimacy}} of the kosher status of meat in Toronto. In 1954, a Rabbinical Board called the “Vaad Hakashruth of the Canadian Jewish Congress of the Central Region” was established. It then consisted of 12 Rabbis, having grown to 26 members as of 2017. In June 1956, the name of the Vaad Hakashruth was changed to the Council of Orthodox Rabbis, the source of the abbreviation COR. In the early 1960s, COR successfully appealed to Prime Minister John G. Diefenbaker to have Shechita legally approved by the federal government and protected by Canadian law. For many years, Rabbi Gedalia Felder was the chairman of the Vaad Hakashruth, and in 2006, his son Rabbi Yacov Felder became the vice chairman, and eventually the chairman.|$|E

25|$|In another {{paper with}} Simon Johnson at Massachusetts Institute of Technology called The Colonial Origins of Comparative Development: An Empirical Investigation, the authors use a natural {{experiment}} {{in history to}} show that different institutions result in different levels of economic growth. The paper examines institutional choices {{during the colonial period}} of several nations in relation to the same nations' economic development today. It found that in countries where the disease environment meant <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> for colonizers to survive (high mortality rate), they tended to set up extractive regimes, which resulted in poor economic growth today. In places where it was easier for colonizers to survive (low mortality rates), however, they tended to settle down and duplicate institutions from their country of origin—especially from Britain, as {{we have seen in the}} colonial success of Australia and United States. Thus, the mortality rate among colonial settlers several hundred years ago has determined the economic growth of today's post-colonial nations by setting institutions on very different paths.|$|E

However, {{none of the}} lyrics were officially adopted by Yeltsin or the Russian government.

Other complaints raised about the song were <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> to remember, uninspiring, and musically complicated. It {{was one of the few}} national anthems that lacked official lyrics during this period. [...] The only other wordless national anthems in the period from 1990 to 2000 were [...] "My Belarusy" [...] of Belarus (until 2002), [...] "Marcha Real" [...] of Spain, and [...] "Intermeco" [...] of Bosnia and Herzegovina ...|$|E

500|$|In {{regard to}} the episode, Rhimes commented before it {{originally}} aired {{that it was difficult}} to write, largely because of the death of a main character. She compared it to writing the season six finale, by explaining that the former was [...] "more painful" [...] to write. After the episode aired, Rhimes repeated in a tweet <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> for her to write the finale, adding: [...] "I did not enjoy it. It made me sick and it made me sad." [...] Rhimes also explained the departure of Leigh, whose character died after the plane crash, by saying that the two came to an agreement on the decision to kill Lexie, after extensive discussion. Speaking of Raver's departure whose character left Seattle Grace for MEDCOM, Rhimes elaborated that Raver was offered a contract renewal, but declined.|$|E
500|$|Vanmarcke {{said that}} he was [...] "pleased with second place" [...] as he had had a {{difficult}} race.

He {{said that he}} was very tired at the end of the race and <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> to beat Sagan and Cancellara. Cancellara said [...] "for sure it’s happy Easter day but it’s not happy Gent-Wevelgem day" [...] as he finished fourth out of four riders in the final sprint.

500|$|Criticism {{was aimed}} at the game's camera angles, which Eurogamer felt were [...] "idiotic" [...] at times, giving the example of boss fights in which the camera centers on the boss rather than being freely movable.

[...] Some criticisms were also aimed at the story, with GameSpy saying that the game became predictable, boring, and [...] "just bland". Reviewers {{also noted that the}} first half of the game was [...] "yawn inducing", but once the player reaches planet Rilgar, it becomes much more intense and difficult; GamePro found that the player does not [...] "engage a single thought process" [...] for the first parts of the game.|$|E
