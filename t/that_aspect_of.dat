5|$|During {{this period}} the {{population}} of the nearby village of Burnside was expanding and required a new water supply. First Creekwhich runs down Waterfall Gully and enters the River Torrens near today's Botanic Gardenswas seen as the perfect solution to the water shortage. A weir was built during 1881 and 1882, and was made to hold approximately two megalitres (530,000USgallons) of water. A pipeline was constructed to the reservoir at Burnside South, and from there the water was used throughout the surrounding area. As a side effect, the weir also reduced the volume of water available to the local market gardeners, and over many years <b>that</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> the region disappeared.|$|E
5|$|A {{week after}} When Worlds Collide, Perro Aguayo {{followed}} up his steel cage win {{by winning the}} IWC World Heavyweight Championship from Konnan in a match that was originally designed {{to be part of}} the storyline in which Konnan turned tecnico after Los Gringos were unable to help him retain his title, but <b>that</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> the storyline was dropped a few weeks later. Konnan turned tecnico in the wake of Barr's death and teamed up again with Perro Aguayo, especially as they fought against Los Capos (brothers Cien Caras and Máscara Año 2000) in what would be the new main storyline in AAA leading to Triplemanía III. Aguayo and Konnan ended up challenging for both the IWC World Heavyweight Championship and the UWA World Heavyweight Championship but lost by disqualification. By 1996 Konnan had also left AAA and would begin to work for WCW on a regular basis. After Triplemanía III, Aguayo began teaming with his son Perro Aguayo Jr. as the latter began his professional wrestling career.|$|E
5|$|He {{also promised}} to seek income tax law changes {{that he said}} would help to lower federal deficits and would stimulate {{economic}} growth. These included: reducing individual income tax rates across the board by 20percent, maintaining the Bush administration-era tax rate of 15percent on investment income from dividends and capital gains (and eliminating this tax entirely for those with annual incomes less than $200,000), cutting the top tax rate on corporations from 35 to 25percent, and eliminating the estate tax and the Alternative Minimum Tax. He promised {{that the loss of}} government revenue from these tax cuts would be offset by closing loopholes and placing limits on tax deductions and credits available to taxpayers with the highest incomes, but said that <b>that</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> the plan could not yet be evaluated because details would have to be worked out with Congress.|$|E

He had a 73 {{record and a}} 2.00 ERA in 12 games before being promoted to the Nashville Sounds of the Southern League, the Yankees' AA affiliate. With Nashville, he had a 52 record and 2.05 ERA in nine appearances. Wever's pitching coach in Nashville was Hall of Famer Hoyt Wilhelm. Wilhelm felt he had the ability but not the confidence to pitch in the majors, and spent his time in Nashville working on <b>that</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> Wever's game. The following season, Weber was almost unanimously named to the Southern League All-Star team, thanks to 11 wins and 116 strikeouts {{through the end of}} June. He improved to a 16-6 record, a 2.78 ERA, and 191 strikeouts, won the Southern League Pitcher of the Year award, and accomplished the pitcher's Triple Crown, leading the league in wins, ERA, and strikeouts. He led Nashville to the Southern League championship, and right after doing so, the Yankees called Wever up to the major leagues.|$|E

25|$|The {{reformed}} Indian Army {{was to be}} {{stationed in}} operational formations and concentrated {{in the north of}} the sub-continent.

Five divisions were to be grouped on the Lucknow – Peshawar – Khyber axis, and four divisions on the Bombay – Mhow – Quetta axis. However, the cost of abandoning some thirty-four stations and building new ones in the proposed corps areas was considered prohibitive, and <b>that</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> the plan had to be modified.|$|E

25|$|He often {{referred}} to Le Sage's theory in his lectures on physics at the University of Göttingen. However, around 1796 Lichtenberg changed his views after being persuaded by the arguments of Immanuel Kant, who criticized any kind of theory that attempted to replace attraction with impulsion. Kant {{pointed out that the}} very existence of spatially extended configurations of matter, such as particles of non-zero radius, implies the existence of some sort of binding force to hold the extended parts of the particle together. Now, that force cannot be explained by the push from the gravitational particles, because those particles too must hold together in the same way. To avoid this circular reasoning, Kant asserted that there must exist a fundamental attractive force. This was precisely the same objection that had always been raised against the impulse doctrine of Descartes in the previous century, and had led even the followers of Descartes to abandon <b>that</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> his philosophy.|$|E
25|$|Wilfred Bion's {{observations}} {{about the role}} of group processes in group dynamics are set out in Experiences in Groups and other papers, written in the 1940s but compiled and published in 1961, where he refers to recurrent emotional states of groups as 'basic assumptions'. Bion argues that in every group, two groups are actually present: the work group, and the basic assumption group. The work group is <b>that</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> group functioning which {{has to do with the}} primary task of the group—what the group has formed to accomplish; will 'keep the group anchored to a sophisticated and rational level of behaviour'. The basic assumption group describes the tacit underlying assumptions on which the behaviour of the group is based. Bion specifically identified three basic assumptions: dependency, fight-flight, and pairing. When a group adopts any one of these basic assumptions, it interferes with the task the group is attempting to accomplish. Bion believed that interpretation by the therapist of this aspect of group dynamics would, whilst being resisted, also result in potential insight regarding effective, co-operative group work.|$|E

He chose the title Tender Mercies, from the Book of Psalms, for its relation to the Rosa Lee character, who he said seeks only [...] "certain moments of gentleness or respite, [...] grandness or largeness". Foote sought to portray each character as realistic and flawed, but not unsympathetic.
