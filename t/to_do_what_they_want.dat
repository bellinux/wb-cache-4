500|$|When {{discussing}} {{the central theme}} of Batman, director Tim Burton explained, [...] "the whole film and mythology of the character is a complete duel of the freaks. It's a fight between two disturbed people", adding that [...] "The Joker {{is such a great}} character because there's a complete freedom to him. Any character who operates on the outside of society and is deemed a freak and an outcast then has the freedom <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>want...</b> They are the darker sides of freedom. Insanity is in some scary way the most freedom you can have, because you're not bound by the laws of society".|$|E

[...] The UK re-release of 18 May 1987 consisted of a 7" [...] and a 12" [...] that were also limited editions, along with a widely available 12". [...] The re-release included the tracks [...] "Ivum Naya (Ibo Version)" [...] (a version of [...] "All You Need Is Love" [...] with Chike on lead vocals), and [...] "Rap, Rhyme and Scratch Yourself" [...] (an instrumental version of the song, [...] "a stripped down beatbox track for anybody to feel free <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> with" [...] according to King Boy D).

500|$|The episode [...] "T.A.H.I.T.I." [...] {{introduces}} the Kree alien {{race to the}} MCU, members of which {{play a significant role}} in Guardians of the Galaxy. This begins a storyline that recurs throughout the series, and introduces Inhumans to the MCU, with Jed Whedon saying that it was something [...] "in the works" [...] for a long time, as Marvel Studios had plans for an Inhumans film, and this would be [...] "one of the first instances where we get to start planting the seeds on the show before the film." [...] The third season {{introduces the}} concept of the Secret Warriors, with new Inhuman characters inspired by the comic of the same name, while also retconning the history of Hydra in the MCU, tying it into the Inhumans storyline. Gregg noted in January 2016 that the [...] "writer and director [...] will have free rein <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to do with the Inhumans, but hopefully there'll be some way that our Inhumans connect to that." [...] When the film was removed from Marvel Studios' release schedule, Whedon noted that the series had [...] "a little more freedom" [...] and were [...] "able to do a little bit more" [...] with the species going into the fourth season, including the potential of introducing some of the [...] "classic" [...] Inhumans. Marvel's Inhumans, a television series centered on Black Bolt and other members of the Inhuman Royal Family, was announced in November 2016 to air on ABC in September 2017. It is not intended to be a spin-off of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.|$|E
500|$|Writing [...] "The Sleeper" [...] {{sees the}} {{characters}} in a different light. Although they are the protagonists who work to prevent terrorist threats, the episode sees the MI5 team going {{to great lengths to}} get the sleeper agent, Fred Roberts, <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> him to do so that the producers can make the audience sympathise with the character, as well as despise the main characters on some level for their methods. There were other instances of the main character going through great lengths to solve the case, including Adam's interrogation methods, brinking on torture, in [...] "Frequently Asked Questions". [...] "Love and Death" [...] sees Danny and Zoe ordered to carry out an assassination. Wolstencroft did not want to do it lightly, as he wanted somebody like Danny going through [...] "something dreadful." [...] He previously did it before with the death of Helen Flynn in [...] "Looking After Our Own", but [...] "Love and Death" [...] did this in {{the point of view of}} the killer, not the victim. [...] "Celebrity" [...] introduces a new plot style, which does not involve terror threats. Brenton wrote it as a more light-hearted episode that saw the characters emmeshed in a world they cannot handle. Despite this, Collins stated that MI5 do other duties other than fighting terrorism, though they would not gain as much media attention. Penhale also stated MI5 in the episode are in a way protecting the country, as if a national icon is under threat, the country's morale could drop. [...] "Who Guards the Guards?" [...] and [...] "Frequently Asked Questions" [...] were considered for the second series, but because there was not room for them, the producers bumped the episodes back to the third series.|$|E
2500|$|In Season 6, a new {{aspect of}} Endurance called the Magic Box was introduced. This is a {{challenge}} where teams compete {{for the chance to}} gain an advantage over the other teams. Leslie Powell and Will Cuddy (the Green team) won the first Magic Box in the episode [...] "Mana Kisi". Inside, the Magic Box contained one free round at the Temple of Fate, to be used before the Temple of Fate challenge begins. In addition to winning a Magic Box, teams are allowed <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> with the information given. They decided to lie about it. In the end when the Green Team was sent up to temple with their friends the Orange Team, they used their advantage against them and sent the Orange Team home.|$|E

2500|$|The Liber Iudiciorum makes several {{striking}} {{differences from}} Roman law, especially concerning {{the issue of}} inheritance. [...] According to the Liber Iudiciorum, if incest is committed, the children can still inherit, whereas in Roman law the children were disinherited and could not succeed. [...] Title II of Book IV outlines the issue of inheritance under the newly united Visigothic Code: section 1, for instance, states that sons and daughters inherit equally if their parents die instate, section 4 says that all family members should inherit if no will exists to express {{the intentions of the}} deceased, and the final section expresses a global law of Recceswinth, stating that anyone left without heirs has the power <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> with their possessions. [...] This statement recalls the Roman right for a person to leave his possessions to anyone in his will, except this Visigothic law emphasizes males and females equally, whereas, in Roman law, only males (particularly the pater familias) are allowed to make a will.|$|E
2500|$|Marquis {{was on the}} Cardinals roster {{for their}} first-round playoff matchup against the San Diego Padres, but did not make an {{appearance}} in the series and was not included on the roster for either the NLCS or for the 2006 World Series, which the Cardinals won. [...] "Obviously, I'm very disappointed", he said. [...] " [...] year was a little bittersweet", he said. [...] "Because you bust your butt for three years for a manager, you give it your all and don't complain, and you contribute {{so much in the}} regular season, then to have it taken away in the postseason ... But managers are going to make their decisions. You really can't question them or change them because they're going <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> anyway. You have {{to go out there and}} work hard and be thankful for what you have." [...] His teammates still voted him a full playoff/World Series share. He was also given a World Series ring.|$|E
2500|$|To an extent, Mahagonny is {{an opera}} that satirizes operas. Brecht said that [...] "t attacks {{the society that}} needs operas of such a sort" [...] and Weill said that it [...] "pays {{conscious}} tribute to the irrationality of the operatic form". Both thought operas had become too full of ritual and bereft of substance, and Mahagonny in part sought to deflate the pompous arrogance of traditional opera. With this aim, many traditional operatic themes are subverted and made grotesque; love becomes a commodity, the deus ex machina tells everyone to go to hell, the law is run by criminals, etc. A traditional opera theme is true love, but in Mahagonny the closest such thing is the love between Jimmy and the prostitute Jenny. Furthermore, when given the choice to pay off Jimmy's debt and save his life, she tearfully regrets that while she loves him and will miss him dearly, she cannot part with her money. This commodification of love is brought to a grotesque apex after the hurricane spares Mahagonny; the residents now feel free <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>want,</b> and naturally they want to love. Consequently, in act 2 scene 3, the largely male population take turns having sex with the prostitutes. In contrast to the supposed theme of love, the scene portrays a perverse form of love; the prostitutes are carted around like giant slabs of meat and the [...] "love" [...] is regimented by the queue of men each waiting impatiently for his own turn. The [...] "Mandalay Song" [...] also heightens the ongoing tension. At no point is the music entirely tonal, and while the tune is seemingly jazzy and carefree, the tonalities betray an uneasiness about the whole business. In Mahagonny, operatic love is mutated from a grand aspiration to a mere commodity.|$|E
