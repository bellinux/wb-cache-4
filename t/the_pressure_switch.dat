40|$|At the {{gas spring}} {{manufacturing}} company Strömsholmen AB {{there is the}} needfor {{a way to make}} the load alleviating gas springs more robust, endurable andmaintenance free. A small high pressure compressor with a control systemshould solve these problems. The system would have to raise the pressure in the gas spring if it were to drop under a level and let some pressure out if it were to increase over a certain level. The construction of this Micro Compressor system is presented in this master's thesis. At first, {{a deeper understanding of the}} task at hand was gathered resulting in a design specification, followed by a concept study generated by the systematic design method. The evaluation of the concept study resulted in a chosen concept for prototype production. This prototype system consists of a control system with a pressure switch, a pressure reducing valve and a Micro Compressor that raises the pressure when needed. An electric system was also designed to work with <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>switch,</b> actuating the compressor when needed. Thoughts of converting the Micro Compressor system to pneumatic drive were also considered to increase the scope of use.

40|$|Fluid {{compressibility}} has a {{major influence}} on the efficiency of switch-mode hydraulic circuits due to the release of energy stored in fluid compression during each switching cycle and the increased flow rate through the high-speed valve during transition events. Multiple models existing in the literature for fluid bulk modulus, the inverse of the compressibility, are reviewed and compared with regards to their applicability to a switch-mode circuit. In this work, a computational model is constructed of the primary energy losses in a generic switch-mode hydraulic circuit with emphasis on losses created by fluid compressibility. The model is used in a computational experiment where <b>the</b> system <b>pressure,</b> <b>switched</b> volume, and fraction of air entrained in the hydraulic fluid are varied through multiple levels. The computational experiments resulted in switch-mode circuit volumetric efficiencies that ranged from 51 % to 95 %. The dominant energy loss is due to throttling through the ports of the high-speed valve during valve transition events. The throttling losses increase with the fraction of entrained air and the volume of fluid experiencing pressure fluctuations, with a smaller overall influence seen as a result of <b>the</b> system <b>pressure.</b> <b>The</b> results of the computational experiment indicate that to achieve high efficiency in switch-mode hydraulic circuits, it is critical to minimize both the entrained air in the hydraulic fluid and the fluid volume between the high-speed valve and the pump, motor, or actuator.
