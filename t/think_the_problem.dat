While they find the device works with inanimate objects, the living creatures they use it on always seem to die. When Dr. Patricia Hill (Mary Peach) arrives, she helps them fix the error, making Steiner <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> has been solved. Meanwhile, Dr. Blanchard (Norman Wooland), Steiner's boss and head of the institute he works for, is being blackmailed by Mr. Latham (Derrick De Marney), who wants credit for Steiner's discovery. He forces Blanchard to demand Steiner to give a premature presentation to Professor Lembach (Gerard Heinz).|$|E

I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> is that she wants control over everything – that's one of the themes of the book, and secondly she seems to be almost disowning her past at the moment. She's reinventing herself as an upper-class, English aristocrat, and the former vegetarian who now goes hunting, fishing and shooting. My door's always open – Madonna's welcome to my house for a cup of tea.|$|E

60|$|In {{his many}} travels, Edgar Caswall had been {{accustomed}} to use the sextant, and was now {{an expert in the}} matter. By the aid of this and other instruments, he was able to fix the position of the kite and the point over which it hung. He was startled to find that exactly under it--so far as he could ascertain--was Diana's Grove. He had an inclination to take Lady Arabella into his confidence in the matter, but he thought better of it and wisely refrained. For some reason which he did not try to explain to himself, he was glad of his silence, when, on the following morning, he found, on looking out, that the point over which the kite then hovered was Mercy Farm. When he had verified this with his instruments, he sat before the window of the tower, looking out and thinking. The new locality was more to his liking than the other; but the why of it puzzled him, all the same. He {{spent the rest of the}} day in the turret-room, which he did not leave all day. It seemed to him that he was now drawn by forces which he could not control--of which, indeed, he had no knowledge--in directions which he did not understand, and which were without his own volition. In sheer helpless inability to <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> out satisfactorily, he called up a servant and told him to tell Oolanga that he wanted to see him at once in the turret-room. The answer came back that the African had not been seen since the previous evening.|$|E

At first she did not <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> were caused by the treatment until many months later.

50|$|Some <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> {{lies with}} a lack of {{interest}} in the career field of Library and Information Science. If minorities do not desire to become librarians, they will not seek to obtain an MLS or MLIS and therefore will not fill high job roles in libraries. Some recommended solutions are to create a great experience for all racial groups early on in life. This may inspire more young children to become interested in the career field later on in life. Another method suggested by employers is to grant free education to minorities who currently work in libraries at an entry level position if they pursue a degree that will further them in their current job.|$|E
