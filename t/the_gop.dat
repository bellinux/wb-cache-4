5|$|After {{dropping}} out, Huntsman still received votes due to him having ballot {{access to}} every state besides Arizona and Virginia, due to failure to collect enough signatures.

Hence, every person who has won <b>the</b> <b>GOP's</b> nomination has won Sanilac County, Michigan.|$|R

This issue would become a major talking point during the campaign.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the 1998 midterm elections, where <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> lost five House seats and failed to make a net gain of seats in the Senate, House Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia stood down for the speakership and declined to take his seat for an 11th term.

Two years later, the DFL regained control of both houses, and with Governor Dayton in office, the party had same-party control of both the legislative and executive branches for the first time since 1990. Two years later, the Republicans regained control of the Minnesota House in the 2014 election, and in 2016, <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> also regained control of the State Senate.|$|E

5|$|Pittsburgh was a Republican stronghold {{starting}} in the 1880s, and the Republican governments provided jobs and assistance for the new immigrants {{in return for their}} votes. But the Great Depression {{starting in}} 1929 ruined <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> in the city. The Democratic victory of 1932 meant an end to Republican patronage jobs and assistance. As the Depression worsened, Pittsburgh ethnics voted heavily for the Democrats, especially in 1934, making the city a stronghold of the New Deal Coalition. By 1936, Democratic programs for relief and jobs, especially the WPA, were so popular with the ethnics that a large majority voted for the Democrats.|$|E
5|$|The Democrats {{held their}} {{convention}} {{the next month}} in New York City. The convention soon deadlocked, and after 103 ballots, the delegates finally agreed on a compromise candidate, John W. Davis, with Charles W. Bryan nominated for vice president. The Democrats' hopes were buoyed when Robert M. La Follette Sr., a Republican senator from Wisconsin, split from <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> {{to form a new}} Progressive Party. Many believed that the split in the Republican party, like the one in 1912, would allow a Democrat to win the presidency.|$|E
5|$|The Republicans {{convened in}} Chicago and {{nominated}} former Speaker of the House James G. Blaine of Maine for {{president on the}} fourth ballot. Blaine's nomination alienated many Republicans who viewed Blaine as ambitious and immoral. <b>The</b> <b>GOP</b> standard bearer was weakened by alienating the Mugwumps, and the Conkling faction, recently disenfranchised by President Arthur. Democratic party leaders saw the Republicans' choice {{as an opportunity to}} win the White House {{for the first time since}} 1856 if the right candidate could be found.|$|E

5|$|In early 1974, {{the group}} Americans for Democratic Action rated Mathias {{the most liberal}} member of <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> in the Senate based on twenty key votes in the 1973 {{legislative}} session. At 90 percent, his score was higher than most Democrats in the Senate, and was fourth highest amongst all members. Issues considered when rating senators included their positions on civil rights, mass transit, D.C. home rule, tax reform, and reducing overseas troop levels. The League of Women Voters gave Mathias a 100% on issues important to them, and the AFL-CIO agreed with Mathias on 32 out of 45 key labor votes. Conversely, the conservative group Americans for Constitutional Action stated Mathias agreed with their positions only 16% of the time.|$|E
5|$|The state's {{conservative}} {{white voters}} began to support Republican presidential candidates by the mid-20th century. After this period, they supported Republicans for {{local and state}} offices as well, and most whites became Republican Party members. The party also attracted some minorities, but many have continued to vote for Democratic candidates. The shift to the Republican Party is much-attributed {{to the fact that}} the Democratic Party became increasingly liberal during the 20th century, and thus increasingly out-of-touch with the average Texas voter. As Texas was always a conservative state, voters switched to <b>the</b> <b>GOP,</b> which now more closely reflected their beliefs. Commentators have also attributed the shift to Republican political consultant Karl Rove, who managed numerous political campaigns in Texas in the 1980s and 1990s. Other stated reasons included court-ordered redistricting and the demographic shift in relation to the Sun Belt that favored the Republican Party and conservatism.|$|E

25|$|The Democrats elected {{majorities}} to Congress almost continuously after 1932 (<b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> {{won only}} in 1946 and 1952), but the Conservative Coalition blocked practically all major liberal proposals in domestic policy. After 1945, the internationalist wing of <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> cooperated with Harry Truman's Cold War foreign policy, funded the Marshall Plan, and supported NATO, despite the continued isolationism of the Old Right.|$|E
25|$|For decades, Lancaster County {{has been}} a Republican stronghold. <b>The</b> <b>GOP</b> {{controls}} {{the vast majority of}} state, county and municipal elected offices in Lancaster County.
