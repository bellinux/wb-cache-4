25|$|Defending {{against a}} penalty kick {{is one of}} the most {{difficult}} tasks a goalkeeper can face. Owing to the short distance between the penalty spot and the goal, there is very little time to react to the shot. Because of this, the goalkeeper will usually start his or her dive before the ball is actually struck. In effect, the goalkeeper must act on his best prediction about where the shot will be aimed. Some goalkeepers decide which way they will dive beforehand, thus giving themselves a good chance of diving in time. Others <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> the kicker's motion pattern. On the other side, kickers often feign and prefer a relatively slow shot in an attempt to foil the goalkeeper. The potentially most fruitful approach, shooting high and centre, i.e., in the space that the goalkeeper will evacuate, also carries the highest risk of shooting above the bar.|$|E
500|$|On 15 July 1928 {{the first}} German machine-enciphered {{messages}} were broadcast by German military radio stations. [...] Polish monitoring stations began intercepting them, and cryptologists in the Polish Cipher Bureau's German section {{were instructed to}} <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> them. [...] The effort was fruitless, however, and was eventually abandoned. [...] There remained very slight evidence of the effort, {{in the form of}} a few densely written-over sheets of paper and the commercial-model Enigma machine. On 15 January 1929 Major Gwido Langer, after a tour of duty as chief of staff of the 1st Legion Infantry Division, became chief of the Radio-Intelligence Office, and subsequently of the Cipher Bureau. The Bureau's deputy chief, and the chief of its German section (BS-4), was Captain Maksymilian Ciężki.|$|E
500|$|The song {{begins with}} a brief {{introduction}} in which Eminem says while the chorus plays underneath, [...] "Yeh, it's been a ride. I guess I {{had to go to}} that place to get to this one." [...] When he begins the first verse, his lyrics threaten people who have looked down on him: [...] "You can <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em/ But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em." [...] On the second verse, Eminem says that he has indeed made mistakes, commenting on his Relapse album: [...] "That last Relapse CD was ehh/ Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground/ Relax, I ain't going to do that now." [...] When he says [...] "All I'm trying to say is get back, click clack, pow", a gunshot is heard. Approaching {{the end of the second}} verse, Eminem raps about his personal experiences: [...] "But I think I'm still trying to figure this crap out/ Thought I had it mapped out, but I guess I didn't/ It's time to exercise these demons/ These motherfuckers are doing jumping jacks now." [...] After the chorus, Eminem sings a bridge and focuses on a positive change, as he says [...] "I just can't keep living this way, so starting today I'm breaking out of this cage." [...] Before the final chorus, he says that he [...] "shoots for the moon". The song features a choir composed of Kip Blackshire, Christal Garrick II, Terry Dexter, Rich King, Kristen Ashley Cole and Sly Jordan.|$|E

Then they both <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> it, turning it in every {{conceivable}} direction, and holding it at every possible distance from their eyes, but still without success. Then {{they came to the}} conclusion that they could [...] "make nothing of it at all at all," [...] which was not surprising, for neither of them could read a word.|$|R

2500|$|We might {{recognise}} {{this claim}} as {{the sort of}} absurdity many philosophers <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> into the pragmatism of William James. James, however, would not agree that the meaning of [...] "the 100th decimal of Pi is 9" [...] and [...] "the 100th decimal of Pi is 6" [...] mean the same thing until someone has a reason to care about any possible difference. Schiller, in constast, does mean to say this.|$|E
