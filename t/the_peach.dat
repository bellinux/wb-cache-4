5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1986, the Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce (MACOC) took over <b>the</b> <b>Peach</b> Bowl. The bowl {{executive}} director {{at the time was}} Dick Bestwick, and he encouraged the Chamber to step up its support of the game over what had been provided by the Lions Club. In 1986, <b>the</b> <b>Peach</b> Bowl had no contractual obligations with college football conferences, as its successor, the Chick-fil-A Bowl, does today. Team selections were made by <b>the</b> <b>Peach</b> Bowl committee, a board of Atlanta community members, business leaders, and organizers of <b>the</b> <b>Peach</b> Bowl. To form one half of the matchup, the committee selected second-place Atlantic Coast Conference team NC State, which accepted the bowl bid on November 22, 1986, the day of their final regular-season game. The other half of the matchup was Virginia Tech, a football independent that had finished with nine wins, one loss, and one tie during the regular season and received its invitation one week after the regular season concluded.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Peach</b> Bowl {{game was}} created in 1968 by the Lions Club of Atlanta {{as a means to}} attract tourism to the city. First played at Grant Field on the campus of Georgia Tech, the game was moved to Fulton County Stadium in 1971. By the mid-1980s, <b>the</b> <b>Peach</b> Bowl was facing hard times. At the time, NCAA {{guidelines}} for bowls required 75percent of gross receipts to go to participating schools, with 33percent of tickets to the game also required to go to each school. In 1983, the NCAA threatened to revoke <b>the</b> <b>Peach</b> Bowl's charter when ticket sales hovered around 25,000 with a week to go before the bowl. Last-minute sales saved the game, as attendance at the 1983 game climbed to 40,000 and a new television contract allowed the bowl to make a payout of $580,000 to each team. Still, the bowl's future was in doubt.|$|E

5|$|Following the Iron Bowl, Alabama's bowl {{destination}} was unclear {{due to the}} SEC championship game, which determined the conference champion on December 5. Until then, speculation centered on Alabama potentially attending any of four games: <b>the</b> <b>Peach</b> Bowl, Independence Bowl, Sun Bowl, or Music City Bowl. By {{the time of the}} championship game, the Sun Bowl had been eliminated as an option. After Tennessee won the SEC championship game and a bid to the Fiesta Bowl, other teams were selected by <b>the</b> <b>Peach</b> Bowl and Independence Bowl, leaving Alabama to be selected for the inaugural Music City Bowl. The choice was made official on December 6, and Alabama began preparing for its matchup with Virginia Tech.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Peach</b> Bowl was {{the final}} game as head coach of Virginia Tech for Bill Dooley, who had {{accumulated}} a record of 62381 for the Hokies since assuming the head coaching job in 1978. Tech president William Lavery had long disagreed with Dooley {{about the role of}} football at Virginia Tech, and prior {{to the beginning of the}} season, Lavery told Dooley that his tenure as coach would end on January 1, 1987. This fact was revealed to the football team and the general public after Tech's third game of the season. At the time, Dooley was the winningest head coach in Virginia Tech history, but was under investigation for recruiting violations and had settled a breach-of-contract lawsuit against the university for $3.5 million. As part of the out-of-court settlement, Dooley was required to quit his position following <b>the</b> <b>Peach</b> Bowl. In the weeks leading up to the game, Dooley dodged questions about his future. On December 23, it was announced that Murray State head coach Frank Beamer would replace Dooley after <b>the</b> <b>Peach</b> Bowl.|$|E

5|$|As Longstreet's left division, under Maj. Gen. Lafayette McLaws, advanced, they {{unexpectedly}} found Maj. Gen. Daniel Sickles's III Corps {{directly in}} their path. Sickles had been {{dissatisfied with the}} position assigned him on {{the southern end of}} Cemetery Ridge. Seeing ground better suited for artillery positions a half mile (800m) to the west— centered at the Sherfy farm's Peach Orchard—he violated orders and advanced his corp to the slightly higher ground along the Emmitsburg Road, moving away from Cemetery Ridge. The new line ran from Devil's Den, northwest to <b>the</b> <b>Peach</b> Orchard, then northeast along the Emmitsburg Road to south of the Codori farm. This created an untenable salient at <b>the</b> <b>Peach</b> Orchard; Brig. Gen. Andrew A. Humphreys's division (in position along the Emmitsburg Road) and Maj. Gen. David B. Birney's division (to the south) were subject to attacks from two sides and were spread out over a longer front than their small corps could defend effectively. The Confederate artillery was ordered to open fire at 3:00p.m. After failing to attend a meeting at this time of Meade's corps commanders, Meade rode to Sickles' position and demanded an explanation of the situation. Knowing a Confederate attack was imminent and a retreat would be endangered, Meade refused Sickles' offer to withdraw.|$|E
5|$|Deities {{were present}} {{not only in}} the heavens, but also in the human body itself.

The Great Unity lived in the head, along with Lordling and White Prime, who could descend into the liver and lungs. The Director of Destinies lived in the heart and sexual organs, and finally, <b>the</b> <b>Peach</b> Child lived in the lower dantian. Normally these deities resided in the heavens, but they could be activated by scriptural recitations to descend into the body.|$|E
