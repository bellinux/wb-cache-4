5|$|Set in the 24th century, {{the series}} follows {{the adventures of}} the Starfleet and Maquis crew of the {{starship}} USS Voyager after they were stranded in the Delta Quadrant far {{from the rest of}} the Federation. In this episode, the Voyager crew discover a ship sent from Starfleet that could <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>back</b> to the Alpha Quadrant in just 3 months, but it will mean abandoning their vessel. However, it is all revealed to be an elaborate trap as the alien Arturis (Ray Wise) attempts to gain his revenge on the crew for preventing the destruction of the Borg.|$|E
5|$|The next day, June 25, Black Hawk's party {{encountered}} a militia battalion commanded by Major John Dement. In the Second Battle of Kellogg's Grove, Black Hawk's warriors drove the militiamen inside their fort and commenced a two-hour siege. After losing nine warriors and killing five militiamen, Black Hawk broke off the siege {{and returned to}} his main camp at Lake Koshkonong. This would prove to be Black Hawk's last military success in the war. With his band running low on food, he decided to <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>back</b> across the Mississippi.|$|E
5|$|At the school, {{they find}} a secure {{building}} and leave Randall there with a knife. As they leave, Randall pleads to <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>back,</b> and then says {{he had gone to}} school with Maggie Greene (Lauren Cohan) and knows her father Hershel (Scott Wilson), suggesting he knows the farm's location. Shane prepares to kill Randall, but Rick tackles him. During the fight that follows, Rick is able to defeat Shane, who angrily breaks a window that releases a horde of walkers in the building. Shane takes safety in a school bus while Rick rescues Randall back to their vehicle. After contemplating leaving Shane, Rick returns to help Shane get to safety as well. They regag Randall and return to the farm. Rick tells Shane that he will need to follow his orders to remain part of the group.|$|E

5|$|Each of the Christian forces {{felt betrayed}} by the other. A new plan was made to attack Ascalon and Conrad took his troops there, but no further help arrived, {{due to the lack}} of trust that had {{resulted}} from the failed siege. This mutual distrust would linger for a generation due to the defeat, to the ruin of the Christian kingdoms in the Holy Land. After quitting Ascalon, Conrad returned to Constantinople to further his alliance with Manuel. Louis remained behind in Jerusalem until 1149. The discord also extended to the marriage of Louis and Eleanor, which had been falling apart during the course of the Crusade. In April 1149, Louis and Eleanor, who were barely on speaking terms by this time, pointedly boarded separate ships to <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>back</b> to France.|$|E
5|$|Later in the evening, 1st Battalion, 34th Infantry counterattacked the {{positions}} {{but was unable}} to <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>back,</b> in the face of machine gun and small arms fire, and was forced to withdraw by nightfall. After this failed attempt to retake the equipment, Dean ordered {{the positions}} where the captured equipment was located to be destroyed by an airstrike. With the 1st Battalion having taken heavy casualties and the 3rd Battalion forced to move to counter North Korean attacks, the northwest flank of the American line had been beaten back. The North Korean 4th Division began crossing the river, only slightly impeded by US aircraft attacking its boats.|$|E
5|$|On 17 December, {{orders for}} the {{complete}} evacuation of the peninsula were issued. The regiment started leaving the next day, when six officers and 155 other ranks left for Lemnos before dawn. Those left behind {{had to make it}} appear that the trenches were fully occupied. At 21:30 two thirds of the remainder were evacuated. Other smaller parties left the trenches between 01:40 and 02:05, when the last officer and eleven other ranks moved down to the beach and were evacuated. The surviving 375 men of the regiment camped on Lemnos until transport was available to <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>back</b> to Egypt. Their involvement in the Gallipoli Campaign had cost the regiment a total of 640 casualties.|$|E

5|$|After their crews {{arrived to}} <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>back</b> to Austria-Hungary in early 1886, both vessels {{were taken into}} the navy's {{shipyard}} in Pola, where their armament was installed {{over the course of}} 1887, to include their torpedo tubes. Both ships took part in the Barcelona Universal Exposition, which saw a squadron of ironclads and cruisers sent to represent Austria-Hungary at the opening ceremonies. Coincidentally, both ships ran aground during training operations in late June 1888. The two cruisers spent much of the early 1890s laid up, with Panther being reactivated in 1896 for a major training cruise in the Pacific Ocean from May 1896 to February 1898, and Leopard returning to service in 1897 to participate in an international naval demonstration off the island of Crete during the Greco-Turkish War. Leopard went on a training cruise in the Pacific in 19001901 for naval cadets, while Panther spent those years in reserve. The latter went on a cruise to Morocco in 1902, and to eastern Africa in 1905 to arrange a trade treaty with Ethiopia before embarking on another cruise in the Pacific. In the meantime, Leopard served with the main Austro-Hungarian fleet in home waters in the mid-1900s.|$|E
5|$|The Lunar Module (LM) was {{designed}} to descend from lunar orbit to land two astronauts on the Moon and <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>back</b> to orbit to rendezvous with the Command Module. Not designed to fly through the Earth's atmosphere or return to Earth, its fuselage {{was designed}} totally without aerodynamic considerations, and was of an extremely lightweight construction. It consisted of separate descent and ascent stages, {{each with its own}} engine. The descent stage contained storage for the descent propellant, surface stay consumables, and surface exploration equipment. The ascent stage contained the crew cabin, ascent propellant, and a reaction control system. The initial LM model weighed approximately , and allowed surface stays up to around 34 hours. An Extended Lunar Module weighed over , and allowed surface stays of over 3 days. The contract for design and construction of the Lunar Module was awarded to Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation, and the project was overseen by Thomas J. Kelly.|$|E
5|$|The {{expedition}} {{arrived back}} in Cairo in late September 1829 where the expedition bought 10,000 francs worth of antiquities, a budget extended {{to them by}} minister Rochefoucauld. Arriving in Alexandria, they were notified that the French boat that would <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>back</b> was delayed, {{and they had to}} stay here two months until the sixth of December. On their return to Alexandria, the Khedive Muhammad Ali Pasha, offered the two obelisks standing at the entrance of Luxor Temple to France in 1829, but only one was transported to Paris, where it now stands on the Place de la Concorde. Champollion and the Pasha spoke often and on the Pasha's request Champollion wrote an outline of the history of Egypt. Here, Champollion {{had no choice but to}} challenge the short Biblical chronology arguing that Egyptian civilization had its origins at least 6000 years before Islam. The two also spoke about social reforms, Champollion championing education of the lower classes – a point on which the two did not agree.|$|E

5|$|There {{were some}} {{attempts}} to conserve the huia, {{but they were}} few, poorly organised and poorly enforced legally: the conservation movement in New Zealand was {{still very much in}} its infancy. There were successive sharp declines in numbers of huia in the 1860s and in the late 1880s, prompting the chiefs of the Manawatu and the Wairarapa to place a rāhui on the Tararua Range. In February 1892, the Wild Birds Protection Act was amended to include the huia, making it illegal to kill the bird, but enforcement was not taken seriously. Island sanctuaries were set up for endangered native birds after this act, but the new bird sanctuaries, including Kapiti Island, Little Barrier Island and Resolution Island, were never stocked with huia. Although attempts were made to capture birds for transfer, no huia were ever transferred. The Kapiti Island attempt is documented as being particularly poorly managed. A live pair destined to be transferred to the island in 1893 was instead appropriated by Buller, who bent the law to <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>back</b> to England as a present for Lord Rothschild, along with the last collected live pair of laughing owls.|$|E
5|$|Wounded, he {{is taken}} to a Resistance safehouse in Brooklyn. With the Germans {{controlling}} the U.S. Eastern Seaboard, it is revealed that the aliens, known as the Na'kuhl, have sworn allegiance to Nazi Germany. Further, they are providing them with advanced weapons and technology in exchange for material and supplies to build a conduit that will <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>back</b> to their own time period. Meanwhile, Silik (John Fleck), {{the leader of the}} Suliban Cabal, had boarded Enterprise and manages to steal a shuttlepod to fly to Earth. Tucker and Mayweather are then sent to find Silik along with the shuttlepod. Archer contacts Sub-commander T'Pol (Jolene Blalock) using a stolen communicator and is transported back to Enterprise. Before dying, Daniels asks Archer to stop the Na'Kuhl from using the conduit and becoming even more dangerous. On Earth, the away team find and destroy the shuttlepod, but are captured and taken in for interrogation.|$|E
5|$|Sercey's voyage started badly, losing Cocarde to an {{accident}} on the French coast and Bonne Citoyenne and Mutine to British frigate patrols in the Bay of Biscay. Once out of European waters, however, his passage was unchallenged, watering at La Palma, where Vertu joined the squadron, and capturing the whaler Lord Hawkesbury in the South Atlantic. Baco and Burnel proved a bigger problem: at one stage the squabbling pair attempted to kill {{one another and}} had to be pulled apart by Sercey. The squadron took a Portuguese Indiaman off Cape Agulhas on 24 May and the following day encountered and unsuccessfully pursued HMS Sphynx. On 3 June Sercey seized a British Indiaman and his squadron arrived at Île de France unopposed on 18 June, the blockade squadron having departed the coast a few days earlier. The Colonial Assembly had been forewarned of the arrival of the government agents, possibly by Sercey, and they were met with armed troops. The agents demanded Magallon attack the colonial troops, but he refused to do so, and Baco and Burnel were forced onto the corvette Moineau. Moineau was instructed to take the agents to Manila, but once at sea they overruled the captain and ordered him to <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>back</b> to France.|$|E

25|$|On 7 February 1919, the Royal Navy {{formally}} transferred H15 and {{her sister}} H14 to the Royal Canadian Navy. The two boats, both in Bermuda still, had lain unused since December.

25|$|In the parashah, Moses {{told the}} Israelites {{that all the}} people stood before God {{to enter into the}} covenant, {{violation}} of which would bring on curses, but if they returned to God and heeded God’s commandments, then God would <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>back</b> in love and bring them together again from the ends of the world.
