5|$|With {{his father}} usually not home (and {{eventually}} meeting his death) {{because of a}} military career, Van Rensselaer's mother sent him to apprentice with his uncle, Wolfert van Bijler, a jeweler and diamond merchant. At the time, the gem trade was a prosperous enterprise to join, being a well-developed craft. In those days, the diamond trade was nearly always combined with the trade in pearls, other articles of luxury, and rarities of every description. Dutch jewelers found a ready market for their valuable wares at the Dutch imperial court and the smaller German courts. <b>This</b> <b>realm</b> of work promoted Van Rensselaer {{to a life of}} economic success.|$|E

5|$|According to Hinduism, {{the souls}} of three {{preceding}} generations of one's ancestor reside in Pitru–loka, a realm between heaven and earth. <b>This</b> <b>realm</b> is governed by Yama, the god of death, who takes {{the soul of a}} dying man from earth to Pitru–loka. When a person of the next generation dies, the first generation shifts to heaven and unites with God, so Shraddha offerings are not given. Thus, only the three generations in Pitru–loka are given Shraddha rites, in which Yama plays a significant role. According to the sacred Hindu epics, at the beginning of Pitru Paksha, the sun enters the zodiac sign of Libra (Tula). Coinciding with this moment, it is believed that the spirits leave Pitru–loka and reside in their descendants' homes for a month until the sun enters the next zodiacScorpio (Vrichchhika)and there is a full moon. Hindus are expected to propitiate the ancestors in the first half, during the dark fortnight.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, Grant {{began the}} second Typhonian Trilogy with Nightside of Eden, {{in which he}} {{discussed}} {{some of his own}} personal magical ideas, outlining magical formulae with which to explore a dark, dense realm that he variously called 'Universe B' and 'the Tunnels of Set', conceived as a 'dark side' of the Qabalistic Tree of Life. Grant made connections between <b>this</b> <b>realm</b> and the extramundane deities of H.P. Lovecraft's horror fiction. The book proved controversial among occultists and Thelemites, and starkly divided opinion. The sequel appeared in 1980 as Outside the Circles of Time, and introduced Grant's thoughts on the relevance of Ufology and insectoid symbolism for occultism. This would prove to be the final Grant volume published by Muller, who would merge with Blond and Briggs in 1984, while the publishing rights to his works reverted to him the following year. His next book would not appear for another eleven years after Outside the Circles of Time.|$|E
5|$|The Bhagavata Purana {{describes}} Naraka as {{beneath the}} earth: between the seven realms {{of the underworld}} (Patala) and the Garbhodaka Ocean, which is {{the bottom of the}} universe. It is located in the South of the universe. Pitrloka, where the dead ancestors (Pitrs) headed by Agniṣvāttā reside, is also located in this region. Yama, the Lord of Naraka, resides in <b>this</b> <b>realm</b> with his assistants. The Devi Bhagavata Purana mentions that Naraka is the southern part of universe, below the earth but above Patala. The Vishnu Purana mentions that it is located below the cosmic waters {{at the bottom of the}} universe. The Hindu epics too agree that Naraka is located in the South, the direction which is governed by Yama and is often associated with Death. Pitrloka is considered as the capital of Yama, from where Yama delivers his justice.|$|E

According to the Brahmajāla Sutta, a Mahā brahmā is a being from the Ābhāsvara worlds who falls into a lower world through exhaustion of his merits and is reborn alone in the Brahma-world; forgetting his former existence, he imagines himself to have come into existence without cause.|$|R
5|$|The {{majority}} of 4 consists of mid-tempo pieces, {{but unlike the}} filler that might have occupied this pacing on previous albums, many of this album’s greatest strengths lie in <b>this</b> <b>realm.</b> Perhaps best exemplifying this spirit is the André 3000 and Kanye West assisted, 'Party' in which Beyoncé relaxes into a beat that, while {{not be easy to}} grind to, still works perfectly as a party anthem. Beyoncé reminds us that a party is not only meant for dancing. It is a place where you go to enjoy the company of others and oftentimes, that involves real human conversation and interaction. Echoing this sentiment, André’s verse is tranquilized from his customarily rapid-fire delivery to a drawl more reminiscent of Lil’ Wayne than his traditional work with Outkast. 'Party' like much of 4, is a conversation, and André 3000 wants to be heard.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{inheritable}} {{nature of}} coats of arms the College {{have also been}} involved in genealogy since the 15th century. The College regularly conduct genealogical research for individuals with families in the British Isles of all social classes. As the College is also the official repository of genealogical materials such as pedigree charts and family trees. The College's extensive records within <b>this</b> <b>realm</b> of study dates back over five centuries. An individual could, if he so wishes, have his family's pedigree placed inside the College's records. This would require the services of {{an officer of the}} College who would then draft a pedigree. The officer would ensure that the pedigree was in the correct format and also advise the client on the documentary evidences necessary to supports such a draft. After this is done, the officer would submit the pedigree to a chapter of two other officers, who would then examine the pedigree for any mistakes or in some cases demand more research. After this examination is completed the pedigree would then be scrivened and placed into the pedigree register of the College.|$|E
5|$|Fates is {{primarily}} {{set in the}} territories of the kingdoms of Hoshido and Nohr. Their royalty share a similar line of descent from ancient dragons, but each kingdom worships different dragon deities, and so exist {{in a state of}} war. Little do they know that there is also another dragon deity; the dragon Anankos, ruler of the kingdom of Valla. <b>This</b> <b>realm</b> is located under the Bottomless Canyon which separates Hoshido and Nohr. Anankos has usurped the throne of Valla and is intentionally provoking war between the two kingdoms. In the Hidden Truths DLC, it is revealed that Anankos was formerly a kind dragon who gave wisdom to humanity, but his growing power and inability to ascend to the spirit realm with the world's other dragons began corrupting him. After he killed Valla's king in an uncontrolled fit of bestial rage, he finally went mad: his remaining sanity and kindness took temporary shelter in a human form and fathered the Avatar before dying, while his dragon self began an insane crusade to destroy humanity.|$|E

5|$|James {{asserted}} {{his authority}} not only over the nobility but also upon the Church and lamented that King David I's benevolence towards the Church proved costly to his successors {{and that he}} was 'a sair sanct to the croun'. James also considered that the monastic institutions in particular needed improvement and that they should return to being strictly ordered communities. Part of James's solution was to create an assembly of overseeing abbots and followed this up by establishing a Carthusian priory at Perth to provide other religious houses with an example of internal conduct. He also sought to influence Church attitudes to his policies by having his own clerics appointed to the bishoprics of Dunblane, Dunkeld, Glasgow and Moray. In March 1425, James's parliament directed that all bishops must instruct their clerics to offer up prayers for the king and his family; a year later, parliament toughened up this edict insisting that the prayers be given at every mass under sanction of a fine and severe rebuke. This same parliament legislated that every person in Scotland should 'be governed under the king's laws and statutes of <b>this</b> <b>realm</b> only'. From this, laws were enacted in 1426 to restrict the actions of prelates whether it was to regulate their need to travel to the Roman Curia or their ability to purchase additional ecclesiastical positions while there. In James's parliament of July 1427, it is evident that statute being enacted had the purpose of reducing the powers of the church jurisdiction.|$|E

These beings are reborn in another realm after their evil karma has run its course, they die, and they get another chance. <b>This</b> <b>realm</b> is not similar to afterlife hell in Christianity, states Damien Keown, because in Buddhism there is no realm of final damnation and existence in <b>this</b> <b>realm</b> is also a temporary state.|$|E
