5|$|Tripathi had {{initially}} decided <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> on {{the philosophy of}} evil, but was dissuaded by his family members, so he decided <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> on Shiva, one of the Hindu Gods. He decided to base his story on a radical idea that all Gods were once human beings; it was their deeds in the human life that made them famous as Gods. After finishing writing The Immortals of Meluha, Tripathi faced rejection from many publication houses. Ultimately when his agent decided to publish the book himself, Tripathi embarked on a promotional campaign. It included posting a live-action video on YouTube, and making {{the first chapter of}} the book available as a free digital download, to entice readers.|$|E

The work was published {{as part of a larger}} government publication in the late 1970s. He thought it deserved better, and republished it as The Emerald Route (Indian Thought Publications, 1980). The book contains his personal perspective on the local history and heritage, but being bereft of his characters and creations, it misses his enjoyable narrative. The same year, he was elected as an honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters and won the AC Benson Medal from the Royal Society of Literature. Around the same time, Narayan's works were translated to Chinese for the first time.|$|E
5|$|Through the association, Riley became {{acquainted with}} most of the notable writers in the midwestern United States, {{including}} humorist Edgar Wilson Nye of Chicago. After completing his lecture circuit in 1885, Riley formed a partnership with Nye and his agent to begin a new tour. The Redpath Bureau agreed to allow Riley to tour with Nye, provided he maintained his financial agreements with them. In addition to touring, Riley and Nye collaborated <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> <b>book,</b> Nye and Riley's Railway Guide, a collection of humorous anecdotes and poems intended to parody popular tourist literature of the day. Published in 1888, the book was somewhat successful and had three reprints.|$|E
5|$|Five {{years after}} his death, sons Robert and Samuel Wilberforce {{published}} a five-volume biography about their father, and subsequently a collection of his letters in 1840. The biography was controversial in that the authors emphasised Wilberforce's role in the abolition movement and played down the important work of Thomas Clarkson. Incensed, Clarkson came out of retirement <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> refuting their version of events, and the sons eventually made a half-hearted private apology to him and removed the offending passages in a revision of their biography. However, {{for more than a}} century, Wilberforce's role in the campaign dominated the history books. Later historians have noted the warm and highly productive relationship between Clarkson and Wilberforce, and have termed it one of history's great partnerships: without both the parliamentary leadership supplied by Wilberforce and the research and public mobilisation organised by Clarkson, abolition could not have been achieved.|$|E

5|$|The {{bad feeling}} between the McCanns and the Pol√≠cia Judici√°ria reached such a height that Chief Inspector Gon√ßalo Amaral, {{the officer who}} coordinated the {{investigation}} from May to October 2007, resigned in June 2008 <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> alleging that Madeleine had died in an accident in the apartment, and that the McCanns had faked an abduction. Amaral {{had been removed from}} the case in October 2007 after telling a Portuguese newspaper that the British police pursued leads helpful to only the McCanns. Three days after the case closed in July 2008, his book, Maddie: A Verdade da Mentira ("Maddie: The Truth of the Lie"), was published in Portugal by Guerra & Paz. By November 2008 it had sold 180,000 copies, and was later translated into six languages. A documentary based on the book was broadcast on TVI in Portugal in April 2009, watched by 2.2 million.|$|E
5|$|Plantard then {{enlisted the}} aid of author G√©rard de S√®de <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> based on his {{unpublished}} manuscript and forged parchments, alleging that Sauni√®re had discovered a link to a hidden treasure. The 1967 book L'or de Rennes, ou La vie insolite de B√©renger Sauni√®re, cur√© de Rennes-le-Ch√¢teau ("The Gold of Rennes, or The Strange Life of B√©renger Sauni√®re, Priest of Rennes-le-Ch√¢teau"), which was later published in paperback under the title Le Tr√©sor Maudit de Rennes-le-Ch√¢teau ("The Accursed Treasure of Rennes-le-Ch√¢teau") in 1968, became a popular read in France. It included copies of the found parchments (the originals were, of course, never produced), though it did not provide the decoded hidden texts contained within them. One of the Latin texts in the parchments was copied from the Novum Testamentum, an attempted restoration of the Vulgate by John Wordsworth and Henry White. The other text was copied from the Codex Bezae. Based on the wording used, the versions of the Latin texts found in the parchments can be shown to have been copied from books first published in 1889 and 1895, which is problematic considering that de S√®de's book {{was trying to make}} a case that these documents were centuries old.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Paine was a noted {{writer and}} {{political}} theorist whose work had influenced and helped drive the American Revolution. Having returned to England, he decided <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> addressing {{the arguments of}} Edmund Burke, a prominent conservative strongly fearful of the French Revolution. This was simply titled Rights of Man. The first part was published in 1791, and attracted no attention from Pitt's administration. The second, published on 16 February 1792, advocated, amongst other things, {{the right of the}} people to replace their government if they thought it appropriate. The work was an immediate success, selling a million and a half copies, and generated public support for various reform movements. It also brought Paine to the attention of the government and made him a subject to its crackdown. While Paine was visiting an aunt in Kent, Pitt had a writ issued against J.S. Jordan, Paine's publisher, prosecuting him for seditious libel‚Äîa crime based on the concept that the executive was beyond reproach, that made it illegal to criticise the government. Paine returned to London and began to campaign for Jordan, finding him a lawyer and agreeing to pay his legal fees. Jordan, however, most likely frightened for his life, pleaded guilty and turned his files over to the court. With this additional evidence, a writ was issued for Paine on 21 May, charging him with the same crime. His trial date was set for 8 June, and later rescheduled for 18 December.|$|E
