5|$|An initial UN counteroffensive out of Masan proved {{ineffective}} in stopping the North Koreans from advancing. In the subsequent fight, the 35th Infantry {{was able to}} repel the North Koreans at the Battle of Nam River and were highly regarded for these actions. However, the 24th Infantry performed very poorly at the battles of Blue Mountain and Haman, forcing the 25th Division <b>to</b> <b>muster</b> reserves to counter the North Korean gains against the 24th.|$|E
5|$|At {{first the}} {{operation}} went well, with little {{resistance from the}} North Vietnamese. By early March 1971 the situation was changing. Hanoi {{made the decision to}} stand and fight. It began <b>to</b> <b>muster</b> forces which would eventually number 60,000 PAVN troops as well as several thousand allied Pathet Lao troops and Lao irregulars, outnumbering the ARVN by almost three to one.|$|E

50|$|The Old Agora, the {{predecessor}} of the Classical Agora, {{was used in}} the fifth century and before as a rallying point, and references in Andokides and Thucydides <b>to</b> <b>musters</b> at the Anakeion in 415 and 411 BCE have led scholars to conclude that the Anakeion may have lain within the vicinity of the Old Agora, perhaps to the east of the Acropolis.|$|R

5|$|Boris {{was the son}} of Eufemia of Kiev, King Coloman of Hungary's second wife, {{whom the}} king {{expelled}} on the charge of adultery before Boris's birth. According to the chronicler Bishop Otto of Freising, Boris approached Conrad III of Germany to seek his assistance against Géza at the end of 1145. Upon the recommendation of Vladislav II of Bohemia, the German monarch authorized Boris <b>to</b> <b>muster</b> an army of mercenaries in Bavaria and Austria. Boris stormed Hungary and took the fortress of Pressburg (present-day Bratislava in Slovakia). The royal forces soon imposed a blockade on the fortress and convinced Boris's mercenaries to surrender without resistance in exchange for compensation.|$|E

5|$|Early {{mediation}} {{attempts in}} March 1499 had failed because of mutual distrust between the parties. But {{after the battle}} of Dornach, the Swabian League was war-weary and had lost all confidence in the king's abilities as a military leader, and thus refused Maximilian's demands <b>to</b> <b>muster</b> a new army. The Swabian and Habsburg armies had suffered far higher human losses than the Swiss, and were also short on artillery, after repeatedly having lost their equipment to the Swiss. The Swiss also had no interest to prolong the war further, though they refused a first peace proposal that Maximilian presented at Schaffhausen in August 1499.|$|E
5|$|Ferens also intervened {{on behalf}} of his {{constituency}} and its inhabitants. In April 1913 he drew the attention of the Postmaster-General to the case of a post office sorting-clerk who was having difficulties claiming his pension. On 10 August 1916, after a fatal raid by a Zeppelin in the early of the previous morning, against which the city had been able <b>to</b> <b>muster</b> only a single searchlight and one gun, he asked that adequate defences be provided and brought to action where necessary.|$|E
5|$|In 481 BC, after roughly {{four years}} of preparation, Xerxes began <b>to</b> <b>muster</b> the troops for the {{invasion}} of Europe. Herodotus gives the names of 46 nations from which troops were drafted. The Persian army was gathered in Asia Minor {{in the summer and}} autumn of 481 BC. The armies from the Eastern satrapies was gathered in Kritala, Cappadocia and were led by Xerxes to Sardis where they passed the winter. Early in spring it moved to Abydos where it was joined with the armies of the western satrapies. Then the army that Xerxes had mustered marched towards Europe, crossing the Hellespont on two pontoon bridges.|$|E
50|$|On June 3, 1865 the 140th Regiment was mustered {{out near}} Alexandria, VA {{under the command}} of Colonel W.S. Grantsyne, and Lieutenant Colonel W. James Clark. The men not <b>to</b> be <b>mustered</b> out with the {{regiment}} were transferred to the 5th New York Veteran Infantry.

Five months later the service was extended to the Radford Boulevard/Hartley Road junction at Radford. Negotiations were opened {{for the purchase of}} the ten horse buses of a Mr. Mann but these negotiations fell through, and two new ones were purchased from James Hudson of London for the opening of a service to Sneinton.|$|R
5|$|Infighting between Barclay's {{subordinates}} repeatedly {{prevented the}} Russian commander from committing his forces to battle. Barclay's fellow generals and the Russian court viewed the constant retreat as {{a reluctance to}} fight; consequently, he was removed from command and replaced by Prince Mikhail Kutuzov on 29 August 1812. Although the 67-year-old General Kutuzov was not seen by his contemporaries as the equal of Napoleon, he possessed the ability <b>to</b> <b>muster</b> a good defence. He was favoured over Barclay because he was Russian whereas Barclay was of Scottish descent and officers subordinate to Barclay could accept Kutuzov, thereby uniting the army. On 18 August Kutuzov arrived at Sarevo to greet the army.|$|E
5|$|Morehead {{was elected}} the Thirtieth and Thirty-first Congresses, serving from March 4, 1847 until March 3, 1851. During the Thirty-first Congress, the Whig caucus {{considered}} {{him as a}} candidate for Speaker of the House. The voting for speaker began December 3, 1849. The caucus first chose Robert C. Winthrop as their candidate, but after several ballots, Winthrop was still unable to obtain a majority because of sectional rivalries within the caucus. Some Whigs from northern states voted for David Wilmot, a Free Soiler, while five southern Whigs steadfastly voted for Meredith Gentry. The Democrats were similarly unable <b>to</b> <b>muster</b> a majority for their candidate, Howell Cobb.|$|E
5|$|New regiments {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>muster</b> {{into service}} at Indianapolis. The 28th Regiment U.S. Colored Troops, organized between December 24, 1863, and March 31, 1864, {{was the only}} black regiment formed in Indiana during the war. The regiment trained at Camp Fremont, near Fountain Square. It included 518 enlisted men who signed on for a term of three years, but the war was effectively over within a year, cutting short its term of service. The regiment lost 212 men before it mustered out of service on November 8, 1865.|$|E

50|$|On the muster {{out of the}} {{original}} regiment, in October, 1864, the veterans, together with new recruits, were again organized into a regiment. The Regiment was ordered to Arizona Territory, August 15, 1865, by {{the order of the}} Department of California. It was posted at Camp on San Pedro River from October 1865 to December 31, 1865 (later renamed Camp Grant, Arizona), until it was recalled <b>to</b> be <b>mustered</b> out at San Francisco, April 16. Company H was the last unit of the Regiment <b>to</b> be <b>mustered</b> out July 2, 1866.|$|R
5|$|The disproportion was {{so great}} at parting, {{that it was almost}} impossible, in Drury Lane, <b>to</b> <b>muster</b> up a {{sufficient}} number to take in all the parts of any play; and of them so few were tolerable, that a play must of necessity be damned, that had not extraordinary favour from the audience. No fewer than sixteen (most of the old standing) went away; and with them the very beauty and vigour of the stage; they who were left being for the most part learners, boys and girls, a very unequal match for them that revolted.|$|E
5|$|The {{moderate}} Conservatives were Conservatives in name only, and did {{not support}} the saquarema ideology and leadership. During the years following 1857, successive cabinets quickly collapsed, unable <b>to</b> <b>muster</b> a majority in the Chamber of Deputies, as the two Conservative wings undercut each other in a fight for dominance. The Emperor asked Caxias to head a new cabinet on 2 March 1861. Among his ministers were José Maria da Silva Paranhos (later Viscount of Rio Branco), whom Caxias had met and befriended during the Platine War while serving as secretary to Paraná.|$|E
5|$|The {{story for}} The Battle for Middle-earth II {{is divided into}} Good and Evil Campaigns. The Good Campaign focuses on Glorfindel, an Elf who is alerted to a planned attack on the Elven {{sanctuary}} of Rivendell. With help from the Dwarves and other Good forces, the Elves attempt to eliminate Sauron and his army to restore peace in Middle-earth. In the Evil Campaign, Sauron sends the Mouth of Sauron and the Nazgûl <b>to</b> <b>muster</b> wild Goblins. With his army, Sauron moves forward with his plan to destroy the remaining Good forces in the North.|$|E

5|$|To {{do battle}} with an enemy {{expected}} <b>to</b> <b>muster</b> four or five carriers, Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, Commander in Chief, Pacific Ocean Areas, needed every available U.S. flight deck. He already had Vice Admiral William Halsey's two-carrier (Enterprise and Hornet) task force at hand, though Halsey was stricken with severe dermatitis {{and had to be}} replaced by Rear Admiral Raymond A. Spruance, Halsey's escort commander. Nimitz also hurriedly recalled Rear Admiral Frank Jack Fletcher's task force, including the carrier Yorktown, from the South West Pacific Area.|$|E
5|$|Upon Philip's return, he {{dispatched}} Alexander {{with a small}} {{force to}} subdue revolts in southern Thrace. Campaigning against the Greek city of Perinthus, Alexander {{is reported to have}} saved his father's life. Meanwhile, the city of Amphissa began to work lands that were sacred to Apollo near Delphi, a sacrilege that gave Philip the opportunity to further intervene in Greek affairs. Still occupied in Thrace, he ordered Alexander <b>to</b> <b>muster</b> an army for a campaign in southern Greece. Concerned that other Greek states might intervene, Alexander made it look as though he was preparing to attack Illyria instead. During this turmoil, the Illyrians invaded Macedonia, only to be repelled by Alexander.|$|E
5|$|After Governor Adair's term {{expired in}} 1825, he was succeeded by another Relief Party member, General Joseph Desha. Desha and Sharp had been colleagues in Congress, and Desha re-appointed Sharp as {{attorney}} general. The Relief faction {{in the legislature}} passed several measures favorable to debtors, but the Kentucky Court of Appeals struck them down as unconstitutional. Unable <b>to</b> <b>muster</b> the votes to remove the hostile justices on the Court of Appeals, Relief partisans in the General Assembly passed legislation to abolish the entire court and create a new one, which Governor Desha promptly stocked with sympathetic judges. For a time, two courts claimed authority as Kentucky's court of last resort; this period {{was referred to as}} the Old Court-New Court controversy.|$|E
