5|$|Although most {{patients}} present without any known risk factors evident, {{a number of}} risk factors {{for the development of}} cholangiocarcinoma have been described. In the Western world, <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>of</b> these is primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), an inflammatory disease of the bile ducts which is closely associated with ulcerative colitis (UC). Epidemiologic studies have suggested that the lifetime risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma for a person with PSC is on the order of 10%–15%, although autopsy series have found rates as high as 30% in this population. The mechanism by which PSC increases the risk of cholangiocarcinoma is not well understood.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{always being}} found in {{combination}} with the other rare-earth elements in minerals such as monazite and bastnäsite, cerium is easy to extract from its ores, as it can be distinguished among the lanthanides by its unique ability to be oxidized to the +4 state. It is <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>of</b> the lanthanides, followed by neodymium, lanthanum, and praseodymium. It is the 26th most abundant element, making up 66ppm of the Earth's crust, half as much as chlorine and five times as much as lead.|$|E
5|$|Heart {{conditions}} in the Sussex Spaniel can include pulmonary valve stenosis, which is <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>of</b> the congenital heart defects. Essentially, in an animal with this condition, the pulmonary valve is improperly formed which causes the heart to work much faster to pump blood around the body. The final results of this condition can be swelling of fluid in the chambers of the heart, thickening of the heart muscle known as ventricular hypertrophy leading to eventual heart failure.|$|E
5|$|Hyndum repandum is a {{mycorrhizal}} fungus. The fruit bodies grow singly, scattered, or {{in groups}} {{on the ground or}} in leaf litter in both coniferous and deciduous forests. They can also grow in fairy rings. Fruiting occurs from summer to autumn. The species is widely distributed in the northern temperate zone, and is one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>of</b> the tooth fungi. It has been recorded from Australia, Europe, northern Asia, and North America. In Europe, it has been listed as a vulnerable species in the Red Data Lists of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany; Sweden lists it as being of Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|Many {{over-the-counter}} and prescription-only medications contain paracetamol.

5|$|Stars {{are given}} a single-letter {{classification}} according to their spectra, ranging from type O, which are very hot, to M, which are so cool that molecules may form in their atmospheres. The main classifications in order of decreasing surface temperature are: O, B, A, F, G, K, and M. A variety of rare spectral types are given special classifications. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>of</b> these are types L and T, which classify the coldest low-mass stars and brown dwarfs. Each letter has 10 sub-divisions, numbered from 0 to 9, in order of decreasing temperature. However, this system breaks down at extreme high temperatures as classes O0 and O1 may not exist.|$|E
5|$|The {{alkali metals}} and their {{hydrides}} react with acidic hydrocarbons, for example cyclopentadienes and terminal alkynes, to give salts. Liquid ammonia, ether, or hydrocarbon solvents are used, <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>of</b> which being tetrahydrofuran. The {{most important of}} these compounds is sodium cyclopentadienide, NaC5H5, an important precursor to many transition metal cyclopentadienyl derivatives. Similarly, the alkali metals react with cyclooctatetraene in tetrahydrofuran to give alkali metal cyclooctatetraenides; for example, dipotassium cyclooctatetraenide (K2C8H8) is an important precursor to many metal cyclooctatetraenyl derivatives, such as uranocene. The large and very weakly polarising alkali metal cations can stabilise large, aromatic, polarisable radical anions, such as the dark-green sodium naphthalenide, Na+−, a strong reducing agent.|$|E
5|$|The {{common loon}} {{produces}} {{a variety of}} vocalizations, <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>of</b> which are the tremolo, the yodel, the wail, and the hoot. Each of these calls communicates a distinct message. The frequency at which it vocalizes {{has been shown to}} vary based on time of day, weather, and season. It is most vocally active between mid-May and mid-June. The wail, yodel, and tremolo calls are sounded more frequently at night than during the day; calls have also been shown to occur more frequently in cold temperatures and when there is little to no rain.|$|E

5|$|Women {{are more}} likely to develop {{hypothyroidism}} than men. In population-based studies, women were seven times {{more likely than men to}} have TSH levels above 10 mU/l. 2–4% of people with subclinical hypothyroidism will progress to overt hypothyroidism each year. The risk is higher in those with antibodies against thyroid peroxidase. Subclinical hypothyroidism is estimated to affect approximately 2% of children; in adults, subclinical hypothyroidism is more common in the elderly, and in Caucasians. There is a much higher rate of thyroid disorders, <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>of</b> which is hypothyroidism, in individuals with Down syndrome and Turner syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Carabane, {{also known}} as Karabane, is an island and a village located in the extreme {{south-west}} of Senegal, {{in the mouth of}} the Casamance River. This relatively recent geological formation consists of a shoal and alluvium to which soil is added by accumulation in the branches and roots of the mangrove trees which cover most of the island. Along with the rest of Ziguinchor Region, Carabane has a tropical climate, cycling between a dry season and a wet season. The island was once considered an arid location where no useful plants were likely to grow, but it now supports several types of fruit tree, <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>of</b> which are mangos and oranges. Although the nearby Basse Casamance National Park and Kalissaye Avifaunal Reserve have been closed for years because of the Casamance Conflict, Carabane has continued to attract ornithologists interested in its wide variety of birds. Various species of fish are plentiful around the island, but there are very few mammals.|$|E

5|$|Koalas {{have few}} predators; dingos and large pythons may prey on them, while {{birds of prey}} (such as {{powerful}} owls and wedge-tailed eagles) are threats to young. They are generally not subject to external parasites, other than ticks in coastal areas. Koalas may also suffer mange from the mite Sarcoptes scabiei, and skin ulcers from the bacterium Mycobacterium ulcerans, but neither is common. Internal parasites are few and largely harmless. These include the tapeworm Bertiella obesa, commonly found in the intestine, and the nematodes Marsupostrongylus longilarvatus and Durikainema phascolarcti, which are infrequently found in the lungs. In a three-year study of almost 600 koalas admitted to the Australian Zoo Wildlife Hospital in Queensland, 73.8% of the animals were infected {{with at least one}} species of the parasitic protozoal genus Trypanosoma, <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>of</b> which was T.irwini.|$|E
5|$|Over 152 {{species of}} birds are known or {{suspected}} {{to live in the}} Big Butte Creek watershed, including the northern goshawk and the northern spotted owl, a vulnerable species. Bald eagles nest around Willow Lake. Amphibians such as the vulnerable Oregon spotted frog and the near threatened Cascades frog inhabit some regions of the watershed. Black-tailed deer, Roosevelt elk, cougars, and black bears are <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>of</b> the 63 species of mammals found in the watershed. Fishers and American martens have also been spotted. The gray wolf and the vulnerable grizzly bear once lived in the watershed, but are now considered extirpated.

5|$|Seven turumas {{were built}} for the Swedish navy before the Russian war of 1788-90, and another six were {{complete}} during the war, with one more built after 1790. Altogether fourteen turumas were completed, making it <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>common</b> <b>of</b> the four archipelago frigate types. At the outbreak of war in 1788, they formed {{the core of the}} archipelago flotilla in Finland. They were used to support amphibious operations and to conduct raids on the Russian archipelago fleet, {{while at the same time}} acting as a sea-borne flank support for the Swedish army on the Finnish mainland. Turumas fought in both the first and second battles of Svensksund. In the first in August 1789, six turumas made up the bulk of the firepower of the larger Swedish vessels, while at the second in July 1790, it was reduced to just one ship.|$|E
