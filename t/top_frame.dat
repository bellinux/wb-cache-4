25|$|Demeter got hot {{again in}} the last half of June, hitting six home runs over a period of nine games. He had his second multi-homer outing on June 19 at Cincinnati in a 6-5 loss in 10 innings, but had 10th inning heroics of his own on June 25 at Pittsburgh when he {{launched}} a home run in the <b>top</b> <b>frame</b> against Pirates reliever Harvey Haddix. Demeter suffered another minor injury on July 28 when Don Drysdale of the Dodgers hit him on his right forearm, resulting in several more missed games on the season.|$|E
500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the video, Rowland is seen dressed in waist-high trousers, a white blouse, and a black tie. The first scene of the video features Rowland and her love interest, played by Alvino Lewis, arguing. During the song's build-up, she is dressed in a black-and-white netted catsuit, standing in front of pink and red streamers. Just before the chorus, she appears in a low cut corset against a dark backdrop with her hair tied in a tight bun. In the chorus, she appears in a gold dress on a turntable surrounded by smoke, spliced with scenes of the argument and a blue-tinged image of Rowland. As she sings the hook of the song, the camera flicks to a scene where she is surrounded by windswept rose petals (<b>top</b> <b>frame).</b> During the second verse, the blue tinged image of Rowland is seen again, as is a new scene where she is on the turntable again dressed in a black ball gown with frills around the neck and shoulder. This is spliced with more scenes of Rowland in her gold dress. As the chorus builds for a second time, Rowland is seen wearing a tube dress before switching to the dark corset scene where it begins to rain. Rowland is then seen surrounded by white doves (bottom frame) which fly around her while she spins on the circular trap. The bridge of the song focuses on the dark corset scenes where the rain increases and Rowland's facial expressions display deep sadness. Billboard commented on the last scenes: [...] "In the end, Rowland finally takes those 'Rose Colored Glasses' off – the ones that have prevented her from seeing how truly damaging her relationship is – punching through a glass wall before pastel-colored butterflies appear in representation of her breakthrough." [...] The video ends with blue-tinged images, where she sheds a single tear.|$|E

[...] It serves as the <b>top</b> <b>frame</b> for the building’s large windows. [...] The windows are symmetrically places in sets of five in two main banks on {{the north and south}} sides of the building. There are also three sets of two windows on the south side below the gable where the original entrance was once located. [...] All the windows are eight-over-eight double-hung wood sash windows.

[...] There is a single pair of eight-over-eight windows near the north end on the east and west sides of the building. [...] Both the east and west sides of the building have a double-door entrance with a fifteen-pane transom window above the doors.|$|E

2500|$|The stripes {{are about}} four inches wide. The tent itself is {{about four feet}} wide by three feet deep, and inside {{headroom}} is well over six feet. A long white zipper runs up {{the middle of the}} front, while the back is open and contoured to fit the bus. The frame consists of four metal poles which fit into pockets inside the top of the tent and lock together to form a square. Legs on two of the poles fit into brackets which were bolted to the camper's roof. Two additional poles dogleg into the <b>top</b> <b>frame</b> and have small chain-hooks to hold the doors open. The lower ends of these poles fit into holes in the jack supports. Rubber grommets help protect the paint on the doors and the jack points. The lower edge of the tent is secured to the ground with about a dozen metal stakes. Each stake is about six inches long and is formed from hardened 1/4" [...] rods with a loop at one end. Two storage bags made of (usually matching) canvas with leather straps are supplied for the tent and poles.|$|E

50|$|The GWR {{absorbed the}} Cambrian Railways in 1923, {{but with the}} Cambrian main line being lightly built, {{permanent}} way restrictions debarred the use of heavier locomotives, meaning {{that only a few}} classes of GWR locomotive were allowed to run over it, including the Duke Class. However, by the 1930s the Duke class engines were past their estimated life, and in particular the frames were in poor condition. At the same time the heavier Bulldog Class was becoming redundant and being withdrawn, and later members of this class had an improved straight <b>topped</b> <b>frame</b> design.|$|R

Using {{the tenets of}} social amplification of risk framework, agenda setting, and framing theory, a content analysis of articles from newspapers in the Southeast Asian countries of Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam was conducted. Results reveal that a freer press status fosters more stories and use of frames while a precautionary biotech policy favors the citing of more sources. The diversity of sources, however, produced a more polarized coverage that tended to be negative toward this innovation. Across the nations, the most dominant sources cited were politicians and government institutions followed by international and local NGOs.

5000|$|According to Charles Roeder, a {{professor}} of civil engineering at the University of Washington in Seattle, through-truss bridges were a common bridge design in the 1950s (there are 10,200 through-truss bridges in the US), but [...] "if you take {{out some of the}} <b>top</b> <b>framing,</b> you set that bridge up for a stability failure." [...] Before computers, bridge engineers analyzed truss forces by slide rule, with each calculation being time-consuming. Although the finite element method and plastic design theory, both capable of analyzing redundant structures, had recently been formulated and had seen occasional use, they required significantly more calculation than the simple calculation methods for statically determinate structures, which precluded the use of redundant structural members. A great number of bridges were being designed at that time, and there were insufficient design engineers available to design many bridges as indeterminate structures.|$|R
