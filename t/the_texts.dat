50|$|The key insight in this {{algorithm}} {{is that if}} the end of the pattern is compared to <b>the</b> <b>text,</b> then jumps along <b>the</b> <b>text</b> can be made rather than checking every character of <b>the</b> <b>text.</b> <b>The</b> reason that this works is that in lining up the pattern against <b>the</b> <b>text,</b> <b>the</b> last character of the pattern is compared to the character in <b>the</b> <b>text.</b> If <b>the</b> characters do not match, {{there is no need to}} continue searching backwards along <b>the</b> <b>text.</b> If <b>the</b> character in <b>the</b> <b>text</b> does not match any of the characters in the pattern, then the next character in <b>the</b> <b>text</b> to check is located n characters farther along <b>the</b> <b>text,</b> where n is the length of the pattern. If the character in <b>the</b> <b>text</b> is in <b>the</b> pattern, then a partial shift of the pattern along <b>the</b> <b>text</b> is done to line up along the matching character and the process is repeated. Jumping along <b>the</b> <b>text</b> to make comparisons rather than checking every character in <b>the</b> <b>text</b> decreases <b>the</b> number of comparisons that have to be made, which is the key to the efficiency of the algorithm.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} develop a {{definition}} of technological literacy, I will draw on some definitions of literacy, numeracy and competence which reflect some concern for social justice. In defining what is involved in critical reading, Freebody and Luke (1990) say that the reader has to assume four roles.
