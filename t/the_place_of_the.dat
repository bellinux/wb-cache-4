5|$|Although {{archaeology}} {{shows that}} the myth reflects an actual custom, the placement of coins with the dead was neither pervasive nor confined to a single coin in the deceased's mouth. In many burials, inscribed metal-leaf tablets or Exonumia take <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coin, or gold-foil crosses during the early Christian period. The presence of coins or a coin-hoard in Germanic ship-burials suggests an analogous concept.|$|E
5|$|Bulgarian {{historians have}} had mostly {{negative}} assessments of Ivan Shishman. He is {{often viewed as}} having intruded onto the throne due to the intrigues {{of his mother and}} thus taking <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rightful successor, his elder brother Ivan Sratsimir. This eventually resulted in the division of the country {{on the eve of the}} Ottoman invasion. There are no direct historical sources to suggest any significant attempts by Ivan Shishman to fight off the Turks. The inconsistent policy of Ivan Shishman has been described as revealing his weakness and inability to cope with the situation. His rule, however, was still remembered in the 16th century. In a treaty signed in 1519 between the Ottoman sultan Selim I and Louis II of Hungary, some of the lands in question were referred to as terra cesaris Sysman, “the land of emperor Shishman”.|$|E

5|$|During the September term, a {{jury was}} finally selected, {{and the trial}} {{consumed}} {{the rest of the}} term. Much of the same evidence was presented, and the second jury also voted for a guilty verdict. The date for Desha's execution was set for July 14, 1826. Harry O. Brown, the judge in the case, had been temporarily appointed by Governor Desha to fill a vacancy. He set aside the verdict, ruling that the prosecution had failed to prove that the murder occurred in Fleming County, as charged in the indictment. The prosecution unsuccessfully argued that because a change of venue had already been granted, <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> murder was immaterial.|$|E
5|$|Egyptologist and {{archaeology}} pioneer Sir Flinders Petrie {{surveyed the}} Giant, probably during the First World War, and published his {{results in a}} Royal Anthropological Institute paper in 1926. Petrie says that he made 220 measurements, and records slight grooves across the neck, and from the shoulders down to the armpits. He also notes a row of pits suggesting <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spine. He concludes that the Giant {{is very different from}} the Long Man of Wilmington, and that minor grooves may have been added from having been repeatedly cleaned.|$|E
5|$|His elder {{daughter}} Elizabeth, {{the heir}} presumptive, took on more royal duties as her father's health deteriorated. The delayed tour was re-organised, with Elizabeth and her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, taking <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> King and Queen. The King was {{well enough to}} open the Festival of Britain in May 1951, but on 23 September 1951, his left lung was removed by Clement Price Thomas after a malignant tumour was found. In October 1951, Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh went on a month-long tour of Canada; the trip had been delayed for a week due to the King's illness. At the State Opening of Parliament in November, the King's {{speech from the throne}} was read for him by the Lord Chancellor, Lord Simonds. His Christmas broadcast of 1951 was recorded in sections, and then edited together.|$|E

5|$|In 1929, Walter Lowenfels jokingly {{suggested}} that Aldington should {{produce a new}} Imagist anthology. Aldington, by now a successful novelist, took up the suggestion and {{enlisted the help of}} Ford and H.D. The result was the Imagist Anthology 1930, edited by Aldington and including all the contributors to the four earlier anthologies with the exception of Lowell, who had died, Cannell, who had disappeared, and Pound, who declined. The appearance of this anthology initiated a critical discussion of <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Imagists in the history of 20th-century poetry.|$|E

5|$|In many cases, {{large groups}} of {{immigrant}} Han would unite under a common surname to form a brotherhood. Brotherhoods were used {{as a form of}} defense, as each sworn brother was bound by an oath of blood to assist a brother in need. The brotherhood groups would link their names to a family tree, in essence manufacturing a genealogy based on names rather than blood, and taking <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kinship organizations commonly found in China. The practice was so widespread that today's family books are largely unreliable. Many Plains Aborigines joined the brotherhoods to gain protection of the collective as a type of insurance policy against regional strife, and through these groups they took on a Han identity with a Han lineage.|$|E

5|$|Many fire temples, {{with their}} four axial arch openings, were usually turned into mosques simply by setting a mihrab (prayer niche) on <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> arch nearest to qibla (the {{direction}} of Mecca). Zoroastrian temples converted into mosques {{in such a}} manner could be found in Bukhara, as well as in and near Istakhr and other Persian cities. Urban areas where Arab governors made their quarters were most vulnerable to such religious persecution, great fire temples were turned into mosques, and the citizens were forced to conform or flee. Many libraries were burnt and much cultural heritage was lost.|$|E

5|$|Opponents of dam removal {{state that}} the {{estimated}} demolition cost of $3–10 billion is a poor investment, especially in regards of the resulting loss of renewable hydroelectric power, which {{would have to be}} replaced by polluting fossil fuel generation. Although there are several options available to replace San Francisco's water, none are of the purity currently supplied by Hetch Hetchy. There is also no guarantee that the valley can be successfully restored, as the original valley floor was actually the product of thousands of years of intensive controlled burning and management by the native Paiute and Miwok peoples that once lived in the area. Without this intervention, a forest would grow in <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> valley's renowned meadows. Finally, the increased pressure of new tourism could cause its own environmental damage, as has been demonstrated in the crowded Yosemite Valley.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This paper {{presents}} <b>the</b> results <b>of</b> <b>the</b> numerical calculations concerning <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>placing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> developing gaseous gap in a mould {{based on}} <b>the</b> thickness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> forming shell, {{and the temperature}} distribution on the strand length. A cast slab with dimensions of 1100 mm x 220 mm was analysed. The calculations were performed on various heights <b>of</b> <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gap in the mould. Other process parameters, i. e. the casting speed, melt temperature, and the cooling intensity in the secondary cooling zone, were maintained at a constant level. Design/methodology/approach: <b>The</b> numerical model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> steel continuous casting process, developed with the ProCAST software was used. In the study <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> height <b>of</b> <b>the</b> air gap development was examined for five variants. In the heat transfer in the gap model, two basic heat transfer mechanisms were assumed: by radiation and by conductivity. Findings: <b>The</b> numerical model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> steel continuous casting process with influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>placing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> developing gaseous gap in a mould was developed. <b>The</b> verification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> calculation results obtained, after conducting a number or mathematical simulations, concerned the shell thickness and its dependence on <b>the</b> height <b>of</b> <b>the</b> air gap. <b>The</b> simulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> temperature distribution was made for the whole strand. Research limitations/implications: <b>The</b> numerical model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> steel continuous casting process, with the curved mould {{should be used to}} determine <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>placing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> developing gaseous gap.
