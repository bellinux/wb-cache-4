60|$|There is, of course, much to deplore in {{the present}} state of affairs--much that is very melancholy. The {{constitution}} is not a model one, and no prospect of even comparative liberty of the Press has been offered. At the same time, I hope still. As tranquillity is established, there will be certain modifications; this, indeed, has been intimated, and I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>Press</b> will by degrees attain to its emancipation. Meanwhile, the 'Athen√¶um' and other English papers say wrongly that there is a censure established on books. There is a censure on pamphlets and newspapers--on books, no.

50|$|JESSICA YELLIN, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: I wouldn't go that far. I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>press</b> corps {{dropped the}} ball at the beginning. When the lead-up to the war began, the press corps was under {{enormous}} pressure from corporate executives, frankly, {{to make sure that}} this was a war that was presented in a way that was consistent with the patriotic fever in the nation and the president's high approval ratings.|$|E
40|$|When {{speaking}} {{today of}} media, we immediately <b>think</b> of <b>the</b> <b>press,</b> TV, internet, films etc., therefore {{implying that the}} traditional society had no media, no form of public communication. This note would like to show that, in the past, the performance of religious dances in public throughout Bhutan had contributed to the dissemination of values and religious ideas; and how, today, they are still used to transmit messages to the public, however with a new concern: {{the risk of being}} misunderstood or misinterpreted by outsiders to the culture is now present...|$|R

"Our {{articles}} poked fun at respected people, challenged long-established {{ideas and}} disproved widely-accepted 'facts' - not because these points were {{especially important in}} themselves but because they got {{people to think about}} queer things in new ways. Ideas come and go, but our beliefs about the bigger picture will always affect how we respond to new ideas in <b>the</b> future. I <b>think</b> Stonewall will be a very different organisation in a couple of years, I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> gay <b>press</b> will be different and I think London Mardi Gras will be a thing of the past. None of that will be down to Outcast directly, but we've done our bit. We've contributed to the debate, and the debate goes on." ...|$|R
5000|$|I have a theory, {{but it is}} only a theory.

40|$|Is your {{organisation}} {{ready for}} the year 2000 ? If you, your colleagues, your customers, or your suppliers use computers for any part of your work, you could be affected by possible problems. Most computers in the world were designed {{to work on a}} system of dates where the year is expressed in the last two digits of the number. This year is ' 99 ', and next year is ' 00 ', which means that a computer may think that the year is really ' 0000 ', ' 1900 ', or ' 2000 ', and things could go wrong. Computers are used in more places than most people <b>think.</b> <b>The</b> <b>press</b> and other media mostly mention possible problems in aircraft, large hospitals, or electricity power plants. But computers, or computer chips, are also used in other places and equipment near you: irrigation pumps, cold storage, videos, and even in motor engines. All of these could break down {{at the turn of the}} century. No one is quite sure what will happen, although billions of dollars have been spent to try to prevent problems. Organisations such as the World Bank have provided grants to national governments to prepare for these possible problems, largely in the banking, security, and health sectors. Little attention seems to have been paid to agriculture, and, of course, little has been done for people who got their computer software from, let's say, the informal sector. If you use a computer for your work (stock control, accounting, management of savings and credit funds, laboratory tests) or equipment with a chip, it could be worthwhile to find out if your system can cross trouble-free to the next century.

50|$|There are {{two primary}} areas of media agenda-setting: (i) the media {{tells us the}} news and (ii) tells us what to <b>think</b> about <b>the</b> news. <b>Press</b> {{coverage}} sends signals to audiences {{about the importance of}} mentioned issues, while framing the news induces the unsuspecting viewer into a particular response. Additionally, news that is not given press coverage often dissipates, not only because it lacks a vehicle of mass communication, but because individuals may not express their concerns for fear of ostracization; this further creates the spiral of silence effect.|$|R

It is of no use pretending to them that you are on <b>the</b> <b>Press,</b> because they don't want the Press; they don't <b>think</b> anything of <b>the</b> <b>Press.</b> It is no good writing to the acting manager, because there is no acting manager.

5000|$|In his own Targ Editions volume, Abacus Now, William Targ wrote: [...] "Print {{can be as}} {{beautiful}} as music; it {{has the power to}} move, it is as volatile as stage magic. As a typophile and bookman, now on my own, I look more closely into the genius and works {{of the men and women}} who enriched our lives with beautiful books. I observe closely the contemporary typographic scene, the people engaged with the magical 26 letters by which we live... I don't <b>think</b> <b>the</b> private <b>press</b> printer will save the world; but I think that if we are seeking the pure of heart and a wholesome commitment, such a person may be found more readily beside a hand press than, say, in an advertising agency or in the House of Representatives - or in City Hall." [...] William Targ died on July 22, 1999, at the age of 92, in his Manhattan home. He was survived by his wife, Roslyn, of Manhattan, a literary agent; a son, Russell, of Palo Alto, California; two grandchildren, one of whom is Elisabeth Targ, and four great-grandchildren.|$|R

40|$|Eugenics is {{a social}} {{philosophy}} that advocates the improvement of human hereditary traits through social intervention. The goals have been to create more intelligent people, save society?s resources, lessen human suffering, and to reduce health problems.

The United States and Germany were two prominent examples.
