50|$|At first glance, the {{placement}} of weight would have induced <b>tendency</b> to <b>roll,</b> but the weight was evenly supported by lift from the wings.|$|R
50|$|Manufacturers of SUVs often post {{warnings}} on the driver's sun-visor. Among {{the vehicles}} which have received publicity for <b>tendencies</b> to <b>roll</b> over are the Ford Bronco II, Suzuki Samurai, Jeep CJ, Mitsubishi Pajero/Montero, and Isuzu Trooper.|$|R
5000|$|On 5 August 1914, the {{squadron}} had eight ships: , , , , , , [...] and Zealandia. The squadron of eight King Edward VII-class pre-dreadnought battleships were nicknamed [...] "the wobbly eight" [...] after their slight <b>tendency</b> to <b>roll</b> under way.|$|R
5000|$|The second {{generation}} Isuzu Trooper (1995-1997) models were rated [...] "Not Acceptable" [...] by Consumer Reports for their <b>tendency</b> to <b>roll</b> over during testing. After the report Trooper sales never recovered {{and two years}} later production ceased.|$|R
5000|$|The active {{roll control}} system (RoCS) was needed because the flight test vehicle had a <b>tendency</b> to <b>roll</b> around its axis of forward motion. The RoCS for Ares I-X {{consisted}} of two modules containing engines originally used on now-decommissioned Peacekeeper missiles. The RoCS performed two primary functions: ...|$|R
50|$|The springs are all semi-elliptic and are {{supplied}} with hydraulic shock absorbers. The springs are set wide to minimise any <b>tendency</b> to <b>roll.</b> On the radius-rod-controlled front axle they are shackled forwards, flat, splayed {{and held out}} of centre. The back springs are under the axle and outside the chassis frame.|$|R
50|$|The Mark 1 had a <b>tendency</b> to <b>roll,</b> {{affecting}} its directional stability. This was remedied by Navy Lieutenant Gregory C. Davison who {{proposed a}} two-stage turbine design that drove contra-rotating propellers. This cancelled the torque {{effect of the}} single-stage design, improving directional stability. All Bliss-Leavitt variants after the Mark 1 would carry this design feature.|$|R
50|$|A {{bilge keel}} {{is used to}} reduce a ship's <b>tendency</b> to <b>roll.</b> Bilge keels are {{employed}} in pairs (one for {{each side of the}} ship). A ship may have more than one bilge keel per side, but this is rare. Bilge keels increase hydrodynamic resistance to rolling, making the ship roll less. Bilge keels are passive stability systems.|$|R
5000|$|The Parasail was {{developed}} as {{a variant of the}} Parasailor, and is a great light wind performer. With very little <b>tendency</b> to <b>roll,</b> it is ideal for small crews. It can be used with a spinnaker pole but it is not necessary. The Parasail has a single-skinned wing as opposed to the double-layer wing of the Parasailor ...|$|R
5000|$|The system selects the [...] "HARD" [...] {{selection}} and determines that at high speeds, it assumes a more rigid configuration for better ride stability, {{and to reduce}} <b>roll</b> <b>tendencies.</b>|$|R
25|$|Verdia is a dullahan {{and former}} knight. He becomes hostile towards Kazuma's party after Megumin keeps using his castle for Explosion practice. He is weak against water and is {{defeated}} by Aqua's purifying magic. Though {{he had a}} sense of honor from his knighthood days, he also had a <b>tendency</b> to <b>roll</b> his head underneath Wiz's skirt as she walked by.|$|R
50|$|Bilge keel - a longitudinal, external, {{underwater}} member used {{to reduce}} a ship's <b>tendency</b> to <b>roll.</b> In Britain twin bilge keels are often used on small boats moored in estuaries with a large tidal range so the boat stay upright when dried out. With their much shallower draft yachts of this type can be sailed in shallow waters. Not as hydro dynamically efficient as a fin keel.|$|R
50|$|Harriman had the {{steamship}} SS George W. Elder refitted for the expedition. The remodeled ship featured lecture rooms, {{a library}} with over 500 volumes on Alaska, a stable for animals, taxidermy studios, and luxury rooms for the team. Some on the expedition {{referred to the}} ship as the George W. Roller, for its <b>tendency</b> to <b>roll</b> in the waves, causing seasickness among many of the passengers.|$|R
50|$|She {{displayed}} poor performances {{during her}} trials, {{especially with a}} <b>tendency</b> to <b>roll,</b> and was generally considered a failure. Stability problems were to some extent compensated with stabilisator fins, but no other unit of the type was built. The outcome of the project led the French Navy {{to return to a}} more traditional design with the next generation of ships, which would lead to Bretagne.|$|R
50|$|The vessels had {{a compact}} design, {{with a high}} mast and large turrets for main and {{secondary}} artillery. Foreign comments on their design ranged from puns to praise. Not truly designed for open sea operations, the ships had a <b>tendency</b> to <b>roll</b> slowly and widely even in moderate seas. Travel on them was unpleasant, but deemed safe. Additional keels were later fitted, which improved the situation somewhat.|$|R
5000|$|Flowers is {{regarded}} as a prominent frontman of the new wave revival in the 2000s. As a solo artist Flowers first exhibited elements of heartland rock as well as new wave-style alternative rock. On his sophomore album, Flowers exhibited greater pop <b>tendencies,</b> prompting <b>Rolling</b> Stone Magazine to dub The Desired Effect, [...] "the best straight-up pop album made by a rock star in recent memory." ...|$|R
25|$|The {{prototype}} B6N1 {{made its}} maiden flight on 14 March 1941. Following continued testing, however, several problems became evident. In particular, the aircraft exhibited an alarming <b>tendency</b> to <b>roll</b> while in flight, {{the cause of}} which was traced to the extreme torque developed by the four-bladed propeller. To compensate, the aircraft's tail fin was thinned down and moved 2 degrees ten minutes to port. This modification greatly improved the plane's handling characteristics.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} seven {{vehicle classes}} return, including, {{for the first}} time, Monster Trucks. The Monster Truck can handle any terrain, just like the Mud Pluggers. Not only surprisingly fast, it is also considerably deadly, since it can run over and crush other vehicles, including other Monster Trucks and Big Rigs. It is, however, quite vulnerable in crashes, and due to a high centre of gravity they have a <b>tendency</b> to <b>roll</b> over.|$|R
50|$|Spinnerbait with oversized, swivel-mounted blades or {{that are}} {{retrieved}} too fast have a <b>tendency</b> to <b>roll</b> over due to torque {{created by the}} spinning blade. This decreases the odds of getting a solid hook-up. Ideally, the bait should run true, meaning the overhead arm and the hook are vertical during the horizontal retrieve. Spinnerbaits with spinner blades attached on separate in-line frames are relatively free from torque-induced roll-over and, consequently, achieve higher hook-up ratios.|$|R
5000|$|The second-generation Trooper {{received}} negative {{press in}} the United States when the 1995-1997 models were rated [...] "Not Acceptable" [...] by Consumer Reports for an alleged <b>tendency</b> to <b>roll</b> over under testing. In response to a petition from the publication's publisher, Consumers Union, the National Highway Traffic Administration conducted its own tests and found no issue {{that could lead to}} a need for a recall. However, the magazine's claims had hurt sales of the vehicle.|$|R
5000|$|This shape {{was used}} to create d120 dice using 3D printing. More recently, the Dice Lab has used the Disdyakis triacontahedron to mass market an {{injection}} moulded 120 sided [...] die. It is claimed that the d120 is {{the largest number of}} possible faces on a fair dice, aside from infinite families (such as right regular prisms, bipyramids, and trapezohedra) that would be impractical in reality due to the <b>tendency</b> to <b>roll</b> for a long time.|$|R
500|$|The {{shareholders}} {{of the company}} again provided further funding to try and solve the problems. The six-bladed propeller was dispensed with and replaced with the original four-bladed, cast iron design. The third mast was removed, and the iron rigging, which had proven unsatisfactory, was replaced with conventional rigging. In a major alteration, two [...] bilge keels were added to each side {{in an effort to}} lessen her <b>tendency</b> to <b>roll.</b> These repairs and alterations delayed her return to service until the following year.|$|R
5|$|The {{four-bladed}} propeller {{was replaced}} by a slightly smaller three-bladed model, and the bilge keels, previously added to reduce the <b>tendency</b> to <b>roll,</b> were replaced by a heavy external oak keel for the same purpose. The five-masted schooner sail-plan {{was replaced by}} four masts, two of which were square-rigged. With the refit complete, Great Britain went back into service on the New York run. After only one further round trip she was sold again, to Antony Gibbs & Sons, which planned to place her into England-Australia service.|$|R
50|$|The {{shareholders}} {{of the company}} again provided further funding to try and solve the problems. The six-bladed propeller was dispensed with and replaced with the original four-bladed, cast iron design. The third mast was removed, and the iron rigging, which had proven unsatisfactory, was replaced with conventional rigging. In a major alteration, two 110 ft bilge keels were added to each side {{in an effort to}} lessen her <b>tendency</b> to <b>roll.</b> These repairs and alterations delayed her return to service until the following year.|$|R
5000|$|In 1988, Consumer Reports {{announced}} {{during a}} press conference that the Suzuki Samurai had demonstrated a <b>tendency</b> to <b>roll</b> and deemed it [...] "not acceptable." [...] Suzuki sued in 1996 after the Samurai was again mentioned in a CR anniversary issue. In July 2004, after eight years in court, the suit was settled and dismissed with no money changing hands and no retraction issued, but Consumers Union did agree no longer {{to refer to the}} 16-year-old test results of the 1988 Samurai in its advertising or promotional materials.|$|R
50|$|The {{improved}} crossflow behaviour also benefits lateral characteristics {{by reducing}} yaw-induced roll, especially during landing and takeoff of delta-winged aircraft. This in turn helps reduce roll-yaw coupling and any <b>tendency</b> to Dutch <b>roll.</b> However chines {{have also been}} found to reduce lateral stability in some configurations, due to abrupt asymmetric vortex breakdown effect.|$|R
5000|$|In 2010, {{his family}} won $131 {{million in a}} lawsuit filed against the Ford Motor Company, {{claiming}} that the Ford Explorer (the car Cole was driving) is [...] "defective and unreasonably dangerous for the uses {{for which it was}} marketed because the vehicle has an unreasonable <b>tendency</b> to <b>roll</b> when used as Ford marketed it to be used a station wagon replacement, and that the vehicle is also defective and unreasonably dangerous from an occupant protection or 'crashworthiness' standpoint because the safety belt failed to remain locked and permitted Brian to be thrown from the car and killed." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Aerobie {{allows for}} throws over unusually long distances. It flies faster and farther than a common flying disc. When well tuned, it can fly in a {{straight}} line, [...] "like a puck on an invisible sheet of ice". It {{does not have the}} <b>tendency</b> to <b>roll</b> when thrown level, as a flying disc does. But similarly to a disc, an Aerobie can be thrown in a curved path by throwing it in a slant. Its lift depends on its speed relative to the air. Therefore, throwing into the wind makes it fly higher. Throwing with the wind makes it fly lower.|$|R
5000|$|The hook grip is {{more secure}} than grips {{in which the}} thumb remains outside the other fingers, like the closed grip or the natural grip. During a snatch or clean, the lifter can exert forces up to 2-3 times {{the weight of the}} loaded barbell at rest, and the hook grip allows an athlete to {{maintain}} a grip on the bar during the phase of highest bar acceleration, the second pull. The hook grip does this by preventing the bar from rolling in the hands, whereas the bar would have a <b>tendency</b> to <b>roll</b> towards the fingertips in a normal overhand grip.|$|R
5000|$|The SLX omitted some of {{the options}} {{available}} on Troopers from concurrent model years, including the manual transmission and certain engines. From 1996 to 1997 the SLX was only available with the 3.2-litre DOHC V6 engine, switching to the new 3.5-litre DOHC V6 engine in 1998. The SLX received a restyled front end for the 1998 model year, but continued to sell poorly and was ultimately discontinued after 1999. It is said that sales were affected by bad press when the 1996 to 1997 models were rated [...] "Not Acceptable" [...] by Consumer Reports for their <b>tendency</b> to <b>roll</b> over during testing.|$|R
40|$|A large piloted {{vertical}} motion simulator {{was used to}} assess the performance of a preliminary decoupling control law for an early version of the F- 8 oblique wing research demonstrator airplane. Evaluations were performed for five discrete flight conditions, ranging from low-altitude subsonic Mach numbers to moderate-altitude supersonic Mach numbers. Asymmetric sideforce as a function of angle of attack was found to be the primary cause of both the lateral acceleration noted in pitch and the <b>tendency</b> to <b>roll</b> into left turns and out of right turns. The flight control system was shown to be effective in generally decoupling the airplane and reducing the lateral acceleration in pitch maneuvers...|$|R
50|$|The air flask {{pressure}} of the Bliss-Leavitt Mark 1 was 2250 pounds per square inch; the earlier Whitehead models had a lower flask {{pressure of}} 1500 psi. The air in the Mark 1 was heated by burning alcohol in a chamber upstream from the engine; the increased air flask pressure and heated air served to increase {{the range of the}} Bliss-Leavitt Mark 1 to 4000 yards at 27 knots. However, it used a single vertical turbine wheel rotating about the torpedo's longitudinal axis and driving a single propeller. This caused an unbalanced torque that was sufficient to cause the Mark 1 to have a <b>tendency</b> to <b>roll.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Profly goaltenders {{tend to have}} {{an easier}} time [...] "skating" [...] on their knees, also known as the [...] "backside push", or the [...] "butterfly slide". This term {{describes}} where one leg is down, and one is up. The goaltender pushes with his/her leg up laterally from the heel, laterally toward the down leg. This allows for a slide from the up leg to the down leg without getting off the ice completely. If a goaltender is on the inside corners or if the pad faces as in non-progressed [...] "butterfly" [...] styles, the push results in a <b>tendency</b> to <b>roll</b> over onto one's chest and belly.|$|R
40|$|The NASA Ames Research Center {{developed}} an oblique-wing research plane from NASA's digital fly-by-wire airplane. Oblique-wing airplanes show large cross-coupling {{in control and}} dynamic behavior which is not present on conventional symmetric airplanes and must be compensated for to obtain acceptable handling qualities. The large vertical motion simulator at NASA Ames-Moffett {{was used in the}} piloted evaluation of a proposed flight control system designed to provide decoupled handling qualities. Five discrete flight conditions were evaluated ranging from low altitude subsonic Mach numbers to moderate altitude supersonic Mach numbers. The flight control system was effective in generally decoupling the airplane. However, all participating pilots objected to the high levels of lateral acceleration encountered in pitch maneuvers. In addition, the pilots were more critical of left turns (in the direction of the trailing wingtip when skewed) than they were of right turns due to the <b>tendency</b> to be <b>rolled</b> into the left turns and out of the right turns. Asymmetric side force as a function of angle of attack was the primary cause of lateral acceleration in pitch. Along with the lateral acceleration in pitch, variation of rolling and yawing moments as functions of angle of attack caused the <b>tendency</b> to <b>roll</b> into left turns and out of right turns...|$|R
25|$|Prince David, {{in company}} with Prince Henry, left Halifax on 12 January 1941 for work-ups off Bermuda. Crews of both ships {{were given a}} good {{introduction}} to the quick rolling characteristics of the 'Princes' during a stormy passage to Hamilton, Bermuda. Even as cruise ships, the three 'Princes' were known for their <b>tendency</b> to <b>roll</b> in heavy seas. As a gun platform, {{this was not an}} ideal trait and extra care and practice was needed to overcome the tendency to a quick rolling motion. Added to this was the age of the 6-inch guns themselves, which made it necessary to devote more care to the armament than was desirable in a hectic engagement.|$|R
500|$|After her {{commissioning}} in August 1881, Bayern {{was placed}} in reserve. She was not activated for service with the fleet until 1884; this in part {{had to do with}} the poor performance of her sister [...] in the fleet maneuvers of 1880. Among the problems associated with the Sachsen-class ships was a <b>tendency</b> to <b>roll</b> dangerously due to their flat bottoms, which greatly reduced the accuracy of their guns. The ships were also poorly armored, compared to their contemporaries. In addition, they were slow and suffered from poor maneuverability. Nevertheless, Bayern and her three sisters served as the I Division in the 1884 fleet maneuvers, under the command of Rear Admiral Alexander von Monts.|$|R
