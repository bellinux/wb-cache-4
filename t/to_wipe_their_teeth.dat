5000|$|Hanabuddah days: Hanabuddah is most {{commonly}} seen on {{young children who}} neglect <b>to</b> <b>wipe</b> <b>their</b> runny noses. Thus, hanabuddah days refers to one's youth in Hawaii.|$|R
50|$|Once the du'a {{has been}} completed, {{it is most}} common for the supplicant <b>to</b> <b>wipe</b> <b>their</b> face with their hands, and this act signals {{the end of the}} du’a.|$|R
5000|$|Then in the 16th century, {{people in}} Europe began to carry kerchiefs in <b>their</b> pockets <b>to</b> <b>wipe</b> <b>their</b> {{forehead}} or their nose. To distinguish {{this kind of}} kerchief from the one used to cover the head, the word [...] "hand" [...] was added to [...] "kerchief".|$|R
50|$|A {{portable}} raised {{basketball court}} was {{assembled in the}} center of the space and wooden boardwalks led spectators from the entrance to the concession stand and bleachers. Basketball players were obliged <b>to</b> <b>wipe</b> <b>their</b> feet after emerging from the dressing rooms and before stepping up to the court.|$|R
60|$|Albert and Edgar {{had learned}} the use of them in Flanders. Lady Agatha and Aline {{said that they were}} charming, but Sir Ralph {{declared}} that he greatly preferred using his fingers. After the meal was concluded, water was brought round in a silver bowl, with a damask napkin for them <b>to</b> <b>wipe</b> <b>their</b> fingers on.|$|R
50|$|Originally, the maniple {{was likely}} {{a piece of}} linen which clerics used <b>to</b> <b>wipe</b> <b>their</b> faces and hands and has been {{described}} by some modern commentators as being akin to a handkerchief. It appears to have been used in the Roman liturgy since at least the 6th century. The maniple can vary widely in size, shape, and degree of embroidery and ornamentation.|$|R
6000|$|They all gave {{a perfect}} screech. [...] "Why, it's Christmas Eve, 1900, and [...] {{every one of}} your friends has been eaten up long ago," [...] says old First [...] Premium, {{and he began to}} cry over her, and the old hen-turkey and the [...] little turkey chicks began <b>to</b> <b>wipe</b> <b>their</b> eyes on the backs of their [...] wings.|$|R
500|$|In Royal Navy slang, a {{midshipman}} {{is sometimes}} referred to as a [...] "snotty". Two popular stories give origins for the term: the first claims that it arose from a shortage of handkerchiefs among midshipmen, who would consequently use <b>their</b> sleeves <b>to</b> <b>wipe</b> <b>their</b> noses. Prince William, later William IV, is sometimes cited as a notorious example of this practice among midshipmen. [...] The other story claims that the three buttons formerly sewn onto midshipmen's jacket cuffs were placed there to prevent them from <b>wiping</b> <b>their</b> noses on their sleeves.|$|R
60|$|But these nice Gentlemen are {{infinitely}} outdone {{in these}} Countries, for these Solunarians by a true Church turn, not only refuse to transpose their Allegiance, but pretend <b>to</b> <b>wipe</b> <b>their</b> Mouths as <b>to</b> former taking Arms, {{and return to}} their old Doctrins of absolute Submission, boast of Martyrdom, and boldly reconcile the contraries of taking up Arms, and Non-Resistance, charging all their Brethren with Schism, Rebellion, Perjury, and the damnable Sin of Resistance.|$|R
2500|$|As far as Heydler's {{accusation}} {{about having}} been spiked, the 2004 book concludes, [...] "contemporaneous reporting does not validate it. [...] Perhaps coincidentally, {{a reference to}} Heydler in 1898 did include a reference to spiking. [...] Ren Mulford Jr. of the Cincinnati Post wrote, ‘Umpire John Heydler's backbone {{is said to be}} badly in need of stiffening. [...] He is foolish if he permits any diamond gentleman <b>to</b> <b>wipe</b> <b>their</b> spiked shoes on him this year.’" [...] The 2004 book added, [...] "Mulford wrote colorfully, and letting players <b>wipe</b> <b>their</b> spiked shoes was figurative for letting them argue at will." ...|$|R
60|$|As {{she came}} in sight, their dusty and sweaty shirts grew biting as the {{poisoned}} shirt of the Norse myth, their bare feet in the brown dirt grew distressingly flat and hoof-like, and their huge, dirty, brown, chapped and swollen hands grew so repulsive that the mere remote possibility of {{some time in the}} far future standing a chance of having an introduction to her caused them <b>to</b> <b>wipe</b> <b>their</b> palms on their trousers' legs stealthily.|$|R
25|$|Before eating, most dining places provide {{either a}} {{hot or cold}} towel or a plastic-wrapped wet napkin (o-shibori). This is for {{cleaning}} hands before eating (and not after). It is rude {{to use them to}} wash the face or any part of the body other than the hands, though some Japanese men use <b>their</b> o-shibori <b>to</b> <b>wipe</b> <b>their</b> faces in less formal places. Accept o-shibori with both hands when handed the towel by a server. When finished, fold or roll up the oshibori and place it on the table. It is impolite to use o-shibori towels <b>to</b> <b>wipe</b> any spills on the table.|$|R
500|$|Upon its invention, Cope {{commented on}} the multi-functional ability of The Terrible Towel, [...] "I'll tell 'em they can use the towel <b>to</b> <b>wipe</b> <b>their</b> seats clean. They can {{use it as a}} muffler against the cold. They can drape it over their heads if it rains." [...] However, the towel is often used by fans who do not attend games. Fans often drape the towel over their radios or {{television}} sets; some even dress their pets or babies with it.|$|R
50|$|A typical o-shibori, made of cloth, is {{dampened}} {{with water}} and wrung. It is then placed on the dining table for customers <b>to</b> <b>wipe</b> <b>their</b> hands before or during the meal. The o-shibori is often rolled or folded and given to the customer {{on some kind of}} tray. Even if a tray is not used, it is usually rolled up into a long, thin shape, although this is not necessarily the case with o-shibori provided with, say, bentō lunch boxes.|$|R

5000|$|The Weapon X {{organization}} {{appears in}} the Wolverine portion of Hulk Vs. Professor Andre Thorton sends Team X (consisting of Omega Red, Sabretooth, Deadpool and Lady Deathstrike) to capture both Hulk and Wolverine in Professor Andre Thorton's plan <b>to</b> <b>wipe</b> <b>their</b> memories and use them as weapons. Short scenes of Logan past with Weapon X are shown in the movie like how he was captured and later cloned (a ref. to X-23). The Weapon X headquarters was destroyed during Team X's fight with Wolverine and Hulk.|$|R
5000|$|In slums like West Point, 70,000 {{residents}} {{have access to}} four public toilets. In 2009, {{a visit to a}} toilet in West Point cost 2.5 US cents. The young men running the latrines said there were around 500 users a day. The facilities [...] "can be smelled 50 metres away, with the floor of each squalid cubicle 15cm deep in soiled newspaper that residents use <b>to</b> <b>wipe</b> <b>their</b> posteriors. Staff use gloved hands to scoop the used paper into a wheelbarrow, which they dump in the nearby river or beach".|$|R
5000|$|In Taiwan too, similar {{incidents}} {{have been}} reported, where many female {{members of his}} organization were ordered to undress for a [...] "health check", be subjected various forms of sexual abuse, including having sex with him <b>to</b> <b>wipe</b> off <b>their</b> sins.|$|R
50|$|The {{quality of}} care offered by the {{hospital}} is poor. The compound has a 100-year-old drainage system and has erratic water supply. This led to some defecating patients <b>to</b> <b>wipe</b> with <b>their</b> clothes. The quality of uniform worn by the patients are also poor.|$|R
60|$|Blacksmiths, tall stout {{men with}} knotted muscles, sleepy eyes, and great fair beards, {{came out of}} their forges <b>to</b> stretch and <b>wipe</b> <b>their</b> brows, and stare at him.|$|R

5000|$|Anne was {{responsible}} for the housing and education for many of the aristocracy's children including Diane de Poitiers and Louise of Savoy. She is credited with instructing these young people with the new [...] "refined" [...] manners such as not using <b>their</b> fingers <b>to</b> <b>wipe</b> <b>their</b> noses but a [...] "piece of fabric". Louise of Savoy would act as regent several times when her son Francis was king. By being raised by Anne, she was able to learn about France and its governance from up close. Anne also oversaw the education of Margaret of Austria, who had been intended as a bride for Anne's brother Charles. Margaret would later become Governor of the Habsburg Netherlands.|$|R
5000|$|... "Welcome to the 23rd century. The {{world has}} been at peace for the last 100 years. Nano-technology has become a reality and disease and hunger have been {{virtually}} wiped out by tiny Nano-robots created to serve every purpose known to man. Increasingly sophisticated, the Nano-robots have recently gained sentience and are systematically attempting <b>to</b> <b>wipe</b> out <b>their</b> creators, humankind." ...|$|R
50|$|In The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, the Soldier {{with the}} Green Whiskers (real name not yet revealed) {{is the head}} guard of the Royal Army of Oz. His job {{is to protect the}} Emerald City and its residents. He gladly escorts the four main protagonists Dorothy, the Scarecrow, Tin Woodman and Cowardly Lion through the streets of the Emerald City upon their first visit. He leads them all to the royal palace of the Wizard of Oz, where he forces them <b>to</b> <b>wipe</b> <b>their</b> feet upon a plush green carpet before entering. When he blows upon his green whistle, a pretty maid dressed in green silk named Jellia Jamb appears to show the four guests to their private rooms while staying in Oz's palace.|$|R
5000|$|Summaries of napkin history {{often say}} that the ancient Greeks used bread <b>to</b> <b>wipe</b> <b>their</b> hands. This is {{suggested}} by a passage in one of Alciphron's letters (3:44), and some remarks by the sausage seller in Aristophanes' play, The Knights. The bread in both texts {{is referred to as}} apomagdalia, which simply means bread from inside the crust known as the crumb, and not special [...] "napkin bread". The use of paper napkins is documented in ancient China, where paper was invented in the 2nd century BC. Paper napkins were known as chih pha, folded in squares, and used for the serving of tea. Textual evidence of paper napkins appears in a description of the possessions of the Yu family, from the city of Hangzhou.|$|R
5000|$|In [...] "LOTUS", Arthur rescues the Winchesters and Castiel {{from the}} Secret Service and orders Castiel <b>to</b> <b>wipe</b> <b>their</b> memory before {{introducing}} himself. That night, Arthur explains that {{his job is}} to [...] "strongly encourage" [...] the Winchesters cooperation with the British Men of Letters and was sent by Mick Davies after Sam called him and hung up. Arthur has Castiel confirm that he's not lying and shows them his arsenal of weapons, including a hyperbolic pulse generator capable of exorcising a demon from its vessel. Recognizing its potential, Sam asks to borrow it and for Arthur to trust them. Arthur eventually gives the Winchesters the generator, enabling them to force Lucifer from Jefferson Rooney and send Lucifer back to his Cage.|$|R
5000|$|Copy-robots - Androids {{which are}} given to Permen from Superman to help keep their secret. Each one {{transforms}} into a clone {{of the person who}} pushes a button on its nose. The memories of that copy robot can also be transferred to the original person by placing both foreheads against each other. In the first series, the robot had a red nose that remained visible even after the transformation, and they often were deactivated by well-meaning people trying <b>to</b> <b>wipe</b> <b>their</b> noses clean. The duplication procedure also copies whatever clothing or items that are on the activator's person, which landed Mitsuo in trouble on a few occasions for abusing this property. These made a cameo in the Doraemon series as one of his many gadgets from the future.|$|R
50|$|During the French and Indian War, Jeffery Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst, Britain's {{commander}} in chief in North America authorized the use of smallpox <b>to</b> <b>wipe</b> out <b>their</b> Native American enemy. In his writings to Colonel Henry Bouquet {{about the situation in}} western Pennsylvania, Amherst suggested that the spread of disease would be beneficial in achieving their aims. Colonel Bouquet confirmed his intentions to do so.|$|R
50|$|There is {{a secret}} plot of black {{genocide}} concocted by the nefarious Monroe Feather (Jay Robinson), {{the leader of a}} secret Neo-Nazi, white supremacist organization. Their chief scientist, Dr. Fortrero (Richard Angarola), has developed a lethal poison that only affects African Americans. They plan to deploy the serum into the water systems of Washington D.C., Detroit, and Los Angeles, in order <b>to</b> <b>wipe</b> out <b>their</b> black populations.|$|R
25|$|Responding to a journalist's {{question}} {{regarding the}} Mastung Massacre, Aslam Raisani, chief minister of Balochistan, said, The population of Balochistan is in millions, 40 dead in Mastung, {{is no big}} deal. When asked about {{what he could do}} for the grieving families of the victims, he replied, I can send truckload of tissue paper for them <b>to</b> <b>wipe</b> <b>their</b> tears. Mahmood Khan Achakzai, and Sardar Akhtar Mengal, the exiled Baloch leaders, have also condemned the killings and demanded that the Pakistani security establishment take stern action against those involved in terrorism and acts of violence against civilians. In his reaction on March 29, 2012, Sardar Akhtar Mengal accused the Pakistani military establishment of trying to sow hatred and division among the oppressed peoples by promoting religious extremism and intolerance, which his people regarded against their traditions.|$|R
50|$|As late as {{the late}} 1970s, long after the {{invention}} of the videocassette reduced the storage space that was necessary for a vault, American companies that syndicated game shows, such as Odyssey Productions, were more likely <b>to</b> <b>wipe</b> all <b>their</b> videotapes than the three networks were. The syndicated game show Dealer's Choice, which ran throughout 1975 and 1976 in syndication throughout the United States, {{is believed to have been}} almost entirely destroyed.|$|R
5000|$|SSU, in particular, {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{significant}} parts of the Diablo release, as it eliminates the flash-based upgrade system of previous Maemo releases which required the user <b>to</b> completely <b>wipe</b> <b>their</b> device with each upgrade. With SSU, the user can receive [...] "over-the-air" [...] updates. This also decouples bundled software updates from the major system updates, as was required with the flash-based method, so Nokia can release more frequent updates to individual packages than before.|$|R
50|$|When the runaways are time-displaced to 1907, it was {{revealed}} the runaways had landed in a time the Yorkes were visiting, where the Yorkes are the heads of a super powered street gang known as the Sinners. When Chase reveals Gert is dead to Dale, he snaps, prompting him to almost assault Chase with his fiery gloves. Later on, Dale reveals the Yorkes have several kingdoms through time, and plan on destroying all of 1907 New York {{for the sake of}} <b>their</b> daughter. Unable <b>to</b> <b>wipe</b> <b>their</b> memories as she had already used that spell, Nico stops the Yorkes with her most complex spell yet ("The show must go on"), revealing a painful secret about the Yorkes: the Yorkes will remember everything they now know about their daughter's upcoming death as well as their own, but are enchanted to be unable to act on this knowledge in any way, even to each other; they cannot change the future or say anything that would cause a Grandfather Paradox.|$|R
50|$|There {{were two}} {{political}} factions {{at the time}} Myeongjong came to power; Greater Yoon, headed by Yoon Im, Injong's maternal uncle, and Lesser Yoon, headed by Myeongjong's maternal uncles, Yoon Won-hyeong and Yoon Wonro. (Yoon Im and Yoon Brothers were close relatives by that period's standards - Yoon Im's great-grandfather was older brother of Yoon Brothers' great-great-grandfather.) Greater Yoon took power in 1544, when Injong succeeded Jungjong; but they failed <b>to</b> <b>wipe</b> out <b>their</b> opposition, since Queen Munjeong protected the Lesser Yoon faction and other opposition officials.|$|R
40|$|Morality is {{associated}} with bodily purity in the custom of many societies. Does that imply moral purity is a universal psychological phenomenon? Empirically, {{it has never been}} examined, as all prior experimental data came from Western samples. Theoretically, we suggest the answer is not so straightforward—it depends on the kind of universality under consideration. Combining perspectives from cultural psychology and embodiment, we predict a culture-specific form of moral purification. Specifically, given East Asians’ emphasis on the face as a representation of public self-image, we hypothesize that facial purification should have particularly potent moral effects in a face culture. Data show that face-cleaning (but not hands-cleaning) reduces guilt and regret most effectively against a salient East Asian cultural background. It frees East Asians from guilt-driven prosocial behavior. In the wake of their immorality, they find a face-cleaning product especially appealing and spontaneously choose <b>to</b> <b>wipe</b> <b>their</b> face clean. These patterns highlight both culturally variable and universal aspects of moral purification. They further suggest an organizing principle that informs the vigorous debate between embodied and amodal perspectives...|$|R
