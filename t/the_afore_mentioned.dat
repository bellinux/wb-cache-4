2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>afore</b> <b>mentioned</b> {{critics are}} {{consistent}} with the point argued by Stephen Booth in Shakespeare's Sonnets/ Edited with Analytic Commentary by Stephen Booth, that the [...] "fools" [...] are not necessarily [...] "witnesses", but rather [...] "exhibits" [...] whose deaths are called to offer a cautionary tale of those whose crimes have caught up to them. In his article [...] "Politics, Heresy, and Martyrdom in Shakespeare's Sonnet 124" [...] John Klause argues against this view, noting that [...] " [...] One does not 'call' exhibits, but witnesses. It is more likely that the fools are being summoned to testify from beyond the grave... If the foolish are to speak, it is to be on behalf of constant love". He believes that the most plausible identity for those who have died as exemplars of constant love are the martyrs, arguing, [...] "But martyrs will have chosen a foolish goodness over a wise compliance that would have saved them from crime. I n the fatal choice they evoke admiration in a poet who feels that their love in some way establishes a precedent for his own". While this explanation certainly seems plausible, Russell Fraser in his work Young Shakespeare claims that, [...] "Martyrs,Protestand or Catholic, were only grist to Shakespeare's mill. To prove Klause's logic would require more conclusive evidence of Shakespeare's sympathy for martyrs.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{reassessment}} to {{the hypothesis that}} the persistence of current earnings performance is decreasing in the magnitude of the accrual component of earnings and increasing in the magnitude of the cash flow component of earnings. For this purpose, a threshold autoregressive panel unit root approach is proposed using a Fisher-type. This approach allowed us to distinguish between unconditioned and conditioned measures of persistence, making it possible to infer whether the earnings components condition its persistence. The approach was applied to a sample of 126 Brazilian firms in the period from 1995 to 2007. Our main results are the finding of relevant earnings persistence heterogeneity between the firms in the sample, a relatively lower unconditioned measure of earnings persistence, and a partial rejection of <b>the</b> hypothesis <b>afore</b> <b>mentioned,</b> specifically about <b>the</b> effects of the accruals components over the earnings persistence. ...|$|R

In the Fibre Composites Design and Development Centre (FCDD), University of Southern Queensland (USQ) many researches and experiments on new lightweight materials and structures have been carried out. In the previous research, FCDD found that the composites made from vinyl ester resins suffer considerable shrinkage during hardening. This problem could cause the tensile test result to not be accurate. With this issue in mind, research on the more appropriate methods have been carried out to get more accurate results and also compensate the data collected. The material used was thirty three (33) percent by weight flyash particulate reinforced vinyl ester composite [VE/FLYASH (33 per cent) ]. Unfortunately, the tensile test result of the composites cured under ambient conditions is still in doubt.

40|$|According to {{the logic}} of industrialism thesis during industrialization, the {{influence}} of, achieved characteristics on mate selection increased, while the influence of ascribed, characteristics decreased. Other processes that accompanied industrialization, such as, the development of mass communication, urbanization, increasing regional mobility, modern transport, and educational expansion, were hypothesized to break down, cultural differences and cause a decline of status based mate selection. This study, provides a first direct test of these hypotheses by analyzing a large dataset on, marriages in the Dutch province Zeeland between 1811 and 1915, a period before and, during industrialization.

6000|$|In {{consulting}} the excellent commentary of St. Thomas Aquinas on the Parva Naturalia of Aristotle, I was struck at once with its close resemblance to Hume's Essay on Association.

But some time after Mr. Payne showed Sir James Mackintosh some odd volumes of St. Thomas Aquinas, partly perhaps from having heard that he had in his Lectures passed a high encomium on this canonized philosopher; but chiefly from the fact, that the volumes had belonged to Mr. Hume, and had here and there marginal marks and notes of reference in his own hand writing.
