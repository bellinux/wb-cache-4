5|$|NATO {{increased}} its naval presence in <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> <b>Sea</b> significantly following the Russian invasion, with ships docking in Georgian ports, {{and according to}} the US Navy, delivering humanitarian aid. NATO said that its presence in <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> <b>Sea</b> was not related to the Georgian crisis; its vessels were conducting typical visits and preplanned naval exercises with Romania and Bulgaria. Russian General Anatoliy Nogovitsyn reminded NATO of the limit on the number of vessels allowed in <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> <b>Sea</b> under the 1936 Montreux convention. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev questioned the claim that ships going to Georgia were bringing only humanitarian assistance, alleging the delivery of military material. According to political analyst Vladimir Socor, the US maintained a continual presence in <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> <b>Sea.</b> The ships were rotated {{from time to time in}} <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> <b>Sea</b> because of the constraints on ship's weight and length of visits set by the Montreux Convention.|$|E
5|$|Russia saw <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> <b>Sea</b> {{coast and}} {{the border with}} Turkey as {{invaluable}} strategic attributes of Georgia. Russia had more vested interests in Abkhazia than in South Ossetia, since the Russian military presence on <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> <b>Sea</b> coast was seen as vital to Russian influence in <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> <b>Sea.</b> Before the early 2000s, South Ossetia was originally intended {{as a tool to}} retain a grip on Georgia.|$|E
5|$|After Romania {{joined the}} war {{on the side of}} the Triple Entente in August and was quickly overrun by the Central Powers, the Russian efforts in <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> <b>Sea</b> in the second half of 1916 were focused in the west. Because German {{submarines}} never really accomplished all that much in <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> <b>Sea,</b> the February 1917 resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare led the Germans to temporarily abandon <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> <b>Sea</b> in lieu of the more target-rich Mediterranean. UB-14s whereabouts and activities during the latter half of 1916 and the first few months of 1917 are unreported in sources.|$|E

There, Iron Duke was involved in the destruction of warships and other materiel that might be used by the Bolsheviks.

5|$|The Ekaterina II {{class were}} {{a class of}} four battleships built for the Imperial Russian Navy in the 1880s. They were the first battleships built for <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> <b>Sea</b> Fleet. Their design was highly unusual in having the main guns on three barbettes grouped in a {{triangle}} around a central armored redoubt, two side-by-side forward {{and one on the}} centerline aft. This was intended to maximize their firepower forward, both when operating in the narrow waters of the Bosphorus and when ramming. Construction was slow because they were the largest warships built until then in <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> <b>Sea</b> and the shipyards had to be upgraded to handle them.|$|E
