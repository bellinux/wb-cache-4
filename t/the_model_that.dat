5|$|The Straight Eight was {{the first}} car in series {{production}} in the United States with a straight-eight engine. The engine had a cast iron block, a detachable cast iron cylinder head, and an aluminum lower crankcase and oil pan. The crankshaft ran in three main bearings. While the prototype Straight Eight shown at the model's introduction had horizontal valves of the type used in earlier Duesenberg-designed marine and racing engines, <b>the</b> <b>model</b> <b>that</b> entered production had a shaft-driven single overhead camshaft which used rockers to operate two valves per cylinder in a hemispheric combustion chamber.|$|E
5|$|While the Stallions {{experienced}} a successful {{year on the}} field, and finished second to Edmonton in average attendance, the city's excitement of 1994 died down. Attendance declined, with season ticket sales dropping to around 17,000. Later reports suggested that attendance numbers had been inflated by giveaways and the team projected some losses in 1995. Despite these difficulties, the Stallions remained <b>the</b> <b>model</b> <b>that</b> lent expansion credibility; other American owners looked to Baltimore in deciding {{on the future of}} their own teams.|$|E

25|$|While the zarzuela {{tradition}} {{flourished in}} Madrid and other Spanish cities, Catalonia developed its own zarzuela, with librettos in Catalan. The atmosphere, the plots, {{and the music}} were quite different from <b>the</b> <b>model</b> <b>that</b> triumphed in Madrid; the Catalan zarzuela was looking to attract a different public, the bourgeois classes. Catalan zarzuela was turned little by little into what is called, in Catalan, teatre líric català ("Catalan lyric theater"), with a personality of its own, and with modernista lyricists and composers such as Enric Granados or Enric Morera.|$|E
25|$|By the 1970s, new {{problems}} such as overpopulation, limited natural resources and pollution {{that could not be}} solved by normal hierarchical systems had arrived. Jay Forrester stated that he knew how to solve this problem. He applied systems theory to the problem and drew a cybernetic system diagram for the world. This was turned into a computer model, which predicted population collapse. This became the basis of <b>the</b> <b>model</b> <b>that</b> was used by the Club of Rome, and the findings from this were published in The Limits to Growth. Forrester then argued for zero growth in order to maintain a steady equilibrium within the capacity of the Earth.|$|E

25|$|Bayesian {{decision}} analysis {{can also be}} applied to the channel selection process. In order to help provide further information the method can be used that produces results in a profit or loss aspect. Prior information can include costs, expected profit, training expenses and any other costs relevant to the decision as well as managerial experience which can be displayed in a normal distribution. Bayesian decision making under uncertainty lets a marketing manager assess his/her options for channel logistics by computing the most profitable method choice. A number of different costs can be entered into <b>the</b> <b>model</b> <b>that</b> helps to assess the ramifications of change in distribution method. Identifying and quantifying all of the relevant information for this process can be very time consuming and costly if the analysis delays possible future earnings.|$|E
25|$|The new empire was characterised {{by a great}} {{enthusiasm and}} vigor. There was a rash of heroic artwork in {{imitation}} of Greek and Roman styles, and the nation possessed a vigorous, growing industrial economy, while {{it had always been}} rather poor in the past. The change from the slower, more tranquil order of the old Germany was very sudden, and many, especially the nobility, resented being displaced by the new rich. And yet, the nobles clung stubbornly to power, and they, not the bourgeois, continued to be <b>the</b> <b>model</b> <b>that</b> everyone wanted to imitate. In imperial Germany, possessing a collection of medals or wearing a uniform was valued more than the size of one's bank account, and Berlin never became a great cultural center as London, Paris, or Vienna were. The empire was distinctly authoritarian in tone, as the 1871 constitution gave the emperor exclusive power to appoint or dismiss the chancellor. He also was supreme commander-in-chief of the armed forces and final arbiter of foreign policy. But freedom of speech, association, and religion were nonetheless guaranteed by the constitution.|$|E

25|$|There {{has been}} much {{research}} conducted based on Masters and Johnson's model. However, inaccuracies {{have been found in}} the descriptions of the stages of sexual response. For example, Roy Levin identified a few areas of <b>the</b> <b>model</b> <b>that</b> had not been touched upon. First, Masters and Johnson state that only the vagina is lubricated during the arousal stage; Levin argues that the labia produce their own lubricant. Levin also presents research which shows that the first signs of physiological arousal in women is increased blood flow to the vagina, not lubrication. He also dispels information about men and their sexual response; Masters and Johnson report that pleasure was positively associated with the volume of ejaculate released, but Rosenberg, Hazzard, Tallman, and Ohl gave a group of men a questionnaire and found that significantly more men reported that physical pleasure was associated with the strength of the ejaculation compared to the volume. Moreover, some researchers have found that some men can have multiple orgasms, despite what Masters and Johnson had reported.|$|E
25|$|In Wright's {{first public}} {{demonstration}} of Spore, {{he created a}} tripedal reptilian creature in the creature editor (this creature was dubbed the Willosaur by fans, after Wright, {{and became one of}} the mascots for the game, appearing prominently in the game's first trailer.). The game then determined how a lizard with three legs and a prehensile tail should walk. Other animations of the lizard including hunting, eating, swimming, dragging objects, mating, playing a drum and dancing, all of which were procedurally generated based on <b>the</b> <b>model</b> <b>that</b> the player created. Wright then revealed several pre-made creatures which moved realistically, despite their exotic design: large, insectile creatures with multiple heads and six legs, Tweety Bird the SUV: a walking bird whose massive head caused it to tilt while turning, and a dog-like creature with a set of unusually branching limbs. Wright also humorously demonstrated a creature that looked like a Care Bear (claiming it would be a vicious carnivore), indicating that players could create animals similar to those found in nature or popular culture. This also applied to vehicles such as space ships, as demonstrated in the Gadgetoff video, in which Wright was seen piloting a UFO similar to the USS Enterprise.|$|E
25|$|Since 1998, the {{insurance}} company Western QBE had been Glory's title (front-of-shirt) sponsor. However, when ownership of the Glory was handed to FFA, Western QBE decided not to sponsor the club for the 2006–07 season. This left the Glory in a tough position—a lack of sponsorship and owners meant a lack of money, a lack of quality players, poor results and poor football, poor crowd attendances and low ticket sales. This is <b>the</b> <b>model</b> <b>that</b> had affected so many NSL clubs and led to their demise, and had led {{to the demise of}} the New Zealand Knights. Therefore, the Glory knew they needed to find a sponsor quickly, and transitional owners FFA knew they needed to find good owners in a timely fashion as well. 18 rounds into the 2006–07 season, Western QBE returned as title sponsor, signing for the remaining three rounds and {{until the end of the}} 2007–08 A-League season. This brought much-needed stability to the club; the funds helped to secure the supporters' faith, which set off another chain-reaction: fans meant more money, which meant more advertisement, which meant survival, which meant potential owners felt more secure about bidding for the club's licence. This all led to a much larger and more highly respected squad for the 2007–08 season.|$|E

40|$|Most waste {{management}} activities are decided upon {{and carried out}} in a public or semi-public arena, typically involving the {{waste management}} organization, one or more regulators, and often other stakeholders {{and members of the}} public. In these environments, simulation modeling can be a powerful tool in reaching a consensus on the best path forward, but only if <b>the</b> <b>models</b> <b>that</b> are developed are understood and accepted by all of the parties involved. These requirements for understanding and acceptance of <b>the</b> <b>models</b> constrain <b>the</b> appropriate software and <b>model</b> development procedures <b>that</b> are employed. This paper discusses requirements for both simulation software and for <b>the</b> <b>models</b> <b>that</b> are developed using the software.
