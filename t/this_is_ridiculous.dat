Criss offered the insight: [...] "Blaine definitely had his moment in the sun. I think it's time to focus back on the characters that fans of the show really know and love. Completely objectively from watching the show, I was like, 'Why does Blaine get all these songs? <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>ridiculous.</b> I want to hear other people doing stuff.' I think we're focusing a little more back on New Directions and taking {{a little bit of a}} break from the Warblers." ...|$|E

2500|$|On the {{afternoon}} of December 23, 2013 Tolokonnikova was released from a prison hospital in Krasnoyarsk, where she was being treated for an unspecified illness. According to Yelena Pimonenko, senior prosecutor assistant of the Krasnoyarsk Krai, Tolokonnikova was released because the article [...] "hooliganism" [...] of the Russian Criminal Code falls under the newly introduced amnesty bill. Putin’s amnesty was seen by the freed prisoners and numerous critics as a propaganda stunt as Russia prepared to host the 2014 Winter Olympics in February. Tolokonnikova said [...] "... releasing people {{just a few months}} before their term expires is a cosmetic measure... That includes the case of Khodorkovsky, who didn't have much time left on his prison term. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>ridiculous.</b> While Putin refuses to release those people who really needed it. It is a disgusting and cynical act" [...] and urged countries to boycott the 2014 Winter Olympics. She and Alyokhina said they would form a human rights movement for prison reforms. On March 6, 2014, Tolokonnikova and Alyokhina were assaulted and injured at a fast food outlet by local youths in Nizhny Novgorod.|$|E

60|$|Lister's heart beat. He felt <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>ridiculous,</b> {{because he}} had persuaded himself {{it did not matter}} whether he got the post or not. Now, however, when the moment to try his luck had come, he shrank from the plunge he had {{resolved}} to make if he were not engaged. After all, he knew and liked his occupation; to let it go and try fresh fields would be something of a wrench.|$|R

Well, Morgan starts griping that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>ridiculous,</b> that Hornsby hit [...]358 in his career, and Morgan never hit [...]358, and so on. And there it was, perfectly aligned—Joe Morgan the announcer arguing against Joe Morgan the player." ...|$|R

In addition, James decided to supplement his fortune by smuggling drugs and stolen jewelry through the fashion company he bought for Barbara. Finally, Barbara found out about the affair and the illegal activities. Though James was able to talk Barbara into giving their marriage a chance, it became clear that Barbara was becoming disenchanted.|$|R
