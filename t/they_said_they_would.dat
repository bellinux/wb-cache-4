5|$|Because of {{scheduling}} issues, Rucka and Lark {{were behind}} on the series from the start. After several late issues, the team announced a four-month hiatus between issues 21 and 22 to allow Lark {{to get ahead of}} schedule. <b>They</b> <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> not solicit any additional issues until the next story arc was completed, and the hiatus actually lasted six months, in part because of miscommunication between Image Comics and Diamond Distribution. During the hiatus, they released a sourcebook providing additional, non-essential background on the Carlyle family. Despite the break, five months passed between the fourth and fifth chapters of the Cull arc. A second sourcebook detailing the Hock Family was released in April 2017.|$|E
5|$|Customers' {{reactions}} to the merger varied. Most of the public understood {{the need for the}} merger of two small companies, which were both operating in a very limited market and trying to challenge the mass producers. Some loyal Vanaja customers were astounded at the decision to discontinue the make. Some customers were upset because the last long-nosed Vanajas were equipped with cabins from Jyry-Sisu; <b>they</b> <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> never buy Sisu and moved to imported vehicles. Many proven technical solutions used in Vanajas were soon implemented on Sisus. The drop in the truck market was short-lived and sales soon returned to the levels experienced by Vanaja and Sisu combined in the mid-1960s. The last Vanaja vehicles were mobile cranes produced at the end of 1971; subsequently all vehicles made in the SAT Hämeenlinna works were badged as Sisus.|$|E

25|$|Intimidation {{was also}} prevalent, with Kurdish separatist PKK militants {{allegedly}} raiding shops and cafes in the Kurdish-majority south east and demanding {{votes for the}} HDP. It was also alleged that the state-owned Anatolia Agency press organisation marked a voter's house in Diyarbakır after <b>they</b> <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> not vote for the HDP. Controversies also arose {{in regards to the}} HDP's political adverts, which were perceived to be threatening violence if the party didn't cross the 10% threshold and also regarding whether Recep Tayyip Erdoğan would invite the opposition to form a government should the AKP not win a parliamentary majority.|$|E
25|$|Dave Bartlett and Vanessa Hunt, the two paramedics {{who were}} called {{to the scene of}} Kelly's death, have since gone public with their opinion that there was not enough blood at the {{location}} to justify the belief that he had died from blood loss. Bartlett and Hunt told The Guardian that they had seen a small amount of blood on plants near Kelly's body and a patch of blood the size of a coin on his trousers. <b>They</b> <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> expect to find several pints of blood at the scene of a suicide involving an arterial cut. Two forensic pathologists, Chris Milroy of Sheffield University and Guy Rutty of Leicester University, dismissed the paramedics' claims, saying it is hard to judge blood loss from the scene of a death, as some blood may have seeped into the ground. Milroy also told The Guardian that Kelly's heart condition may have made it hard for him to sustain any significant degree of blood loss.|$|E

25|$|The Republic of Texas era {{with the}} Indians {{can be divided}} into three phases: the {{diplomacy}} of Houston during his first term, the hostility of Lamar, and the resumed diplomatic efforts of Houston's second term. Sam Houston led the Republic to negotiate with the Comanche. <b>They</b> <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> stop raiding if they were given sufficient amounts of what they considered prerequisites for peaceful relations: gifts, trade, and regular face-to-face diplomacy. Houston, who enjoyed a good reputation among Indians, had married a mixed-race woman of Cherokee descent. He had lived in Indian Territory for years and learned about their cultures. He was willing to meet with the Comanche on their terms and believed, as a matter of policy, that it was worth it to buy a few thousand dollars worth of presents. The Republic could not support the huge cost of a standing army for defense, and it {{might not be able to}} defeat the assembled might of the entire Comanche-Kiowa alliance, especially if they received Mexican help.|$|E
25|$|The Star Sapphires {{are first}} {{mentioned}} {{in the context of}} a group during a conversation between Carol Ferris and Hal Jordan immediately after Ferris has just recovered from having been possessed by the Star Sapphire stone during Mystery of the Star Sapphire. Ferris explains that while under the possession of the stone, she learned a number of things about its history and capabilities. She says that it told her that billions of years ago, when the Guardians of the Universe decided to form the Green Lantern Corps, a tribe of women left Oa because they did not agree with the Guardians' belief in living a life without emotion. <b>They</b> <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> continue on their own existence living with emotions, starting with love. They searched the universe for billions of years for the thing the Guardians feared, and eventually found it on a planet called Zamaron. They learned of love from the first Star Sapphire gem, which was discovered locked between the embrace of two crystallized skeletons inside a cave. She explains to him that despite the fact that he had been able to defeat the various incarnations of the Star Sapphire he'd encountered up until then, other Green Lanterns had not been as fortunate. She describes another Star Sapphire falling in love with a Green Lantern and encasing his world in violet crystal so that the two could be together forever. She also mentions that the Star Sapphire gem is like the green power rings used by Green Lanterns and the yellow power rings used by Sinestro Corps members.|$|E

Advisers and Brotherhood leaders acknowledged that outside his core base of Islamist supporters Morsi felt increasingly isolated {{in the political arena}} and even within his own government. Opposition leaders {{said in a statement that}} Morsi's 6 December dialogue offer failed to meet [...] "the principles of real and serious negotiations" [...] and displayed [...] "the complete disregard" [...] for the opposition's demands. <b>They</b> <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> not negotiate with Morsi until he cancels his 22 November decree and calls off the 15 December referendum on the draft constitution. Opposition protesters marched on the presidential palace and breached a security perimeter built by the military's elite Republican Guard – charged with protecting the palace – which withdrew behind the palace walls.

2500|$|In September 1928, Jews praying at the Wall on Yom Kippur placed {{chairs and}} a mechitza, {{consisting}} of a few wooden frames covered with cloth which separated the men and women. Jerusalem's British commissioner Edward Keith-Roach, while visiting the Muslim religious court overlooking the prayer area, pointed out the screen, mentioning {{that he had never}} seen it at the wall before. This precipitated emotional protests and demands from the assembled sheiks that it be removed. Unless it was taken down, <b>they</b> <b>said,</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> not be responsible for what happened. The screen was described as violating the Ottoman status quo that forbade Jews from making any [...] "construction" [...] at the Western Wall area and played into Muslim fears of Zionist expropriation of the site, though such screens had been put up from time to time. Keith-Roach told the beadle that the screen had to be removed because of the Arabs' demands. The beadle requested that the screen remained standing {{until the end of the}} prayer service, to which Keith-Roach agreed. When the Jewish beadle failed to remove the screen as agreed, ten armed men were sent in, urged on by Arab residents who were shouting, [...] "Death to the Jewish dogs!"

2500|$|Fuchs and Reagan then {{met with}} representatives of the General Services Administration (GSA) who {{suggested}} that the exchanges be conducted without going through the Air Force Museum, and instead have the Forest Service become directly involved. In this version of the plan, the Air Force would declare that the aircraft were [...] "excess property" [...] and transfer them to GSA, who could then legally make the planes available to other government agencies, but with the provision that any agencies receiving them would be required to retain ownership. This plan was agreed upon, and Fuchs was given responsibility for coordinating the exchange program for the Forest Service. He did not, however, discuss the plan with the Forest Service's Office of General Counsel. The letter authorizing the program on behalf of the Forest Service stated that it complied with various provisions of the federal regulations, when in actuality it did not. In addition, Fuchs provided bills of sale to the contractors, transferring actual ownership of the planes to the companies, in violation of the applicable regulations, as well as the provisions laid down by the GSA. Further, Fuchs told his USFS superiors that the transfer of ownership had been approved by the GSA when in fact it had not. In the ensuing criminal trial, three Air Force generals testified that they were not aware that the government would be losing title to the aircraft; if they had, <b>they</b> <b>said,</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> not have approved the program.|$|E
