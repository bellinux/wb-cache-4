5|$|England {{reached the}} final again in 2007, where they faced South Africa, {{who had won}} 36–0 when the two teams met during the pool stage. South African full-back Percy Montgomery scored three {{penalties}} to Wilkinson's one to give South Africa a 9–3 lead at half-time. England had a try disallowed in the first minutes of the second half, when Mark Cueto was adjudged <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> before scoring. A penalty from Wilkinson and a further two from Montgomery reduced the gap but did not prevent South Africa from winning 15–6 and secure their second World Cup victory. The 2011 final pitted hosts New Zealand against France {{for the second time}} in the tournament, after their first encounter in the pool stage resulted in a 37–17 win for New Zealand. The host team scored the first points of the match, with a try in the 15th minute through prop Tony Woodcock. Nine minutes later, New Zealand's third-choice fly-half Aaron Cruden went off injured and was replaced by Stephen Donald, who had only been called into the squad following injuries to first-choice fly-halves Dan Carter and Colin Slade. Donald extended New Zealand's lead in the second half with a penalty; a minute later, French captain Thierry Dusautoir scored a try, which was converted by François Trinh-Duc to leave France one point behind New Zealand. Despite constant pressure from the French for the remainder of the final, they were unable to score more points and New Zealand won the match 8–7 to lift their second World Cup trophy.|$|E

25|$|The Greening of Harlem Coalition {{is another}} example of an ecofeminist movement. In 1989, Bernadette Cozart founded the coalition, which is {{responsible}} for many urban gardens around Harlem. Cozart's goal is to turn vacant lots into community gardens. This is economically beneficial, and also provides a way for very urban communities <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> with nature and each other. The majority of people interested in this project (as noted in 1990) were women. Through these gardens, they were able to participate in and become leaders of their communities. Urban greening exists in other places as well. Beginning in 1994, a group of African-American women in Detroit have developed city gardens, and call themselves the Gardening Angels. Similar garden movements have been occurring globally.|$|E

As communication technology has become more ubiquitous, it <b>is</b> possible <b>to</b> always <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> with friends and relatives in the periphery of one’s attention, e. g. through instant messaging and online social networks. This research investigated the effect of such social information on people’s sense of connectedness. Also, it was studied how such communication application can be integrated into the fabric of our everyday life as awareness systems. It was found that despite the subtlety, mediated social awareness has a measurable effect on social connectedness. Also, the findings strongly suggest that ambiguity <b>in</b> social cues <b>is</b> a strong enabler of the feeling of being connected.
