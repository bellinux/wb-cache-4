The research subjects were seven <b>student</b> <b>teachers</b> of <b>the</b> seventh semester of English Department University of Muhammadiyah Malang who practiced teaching English at SMAN I Malang. To collect the data, this study used observation, questionnaire, and interview. The non­participant observation was used to get the data {{that could not be}} found on the questionnaire.

The research findings showed that <b>the</b> <b>student</b> <b>teachers</b> faced <b>the</b> non­linguistic problems in teaching English at SMAN I Malang. The problems concerned with syllabus, lesson plan, material, time, student, facility and supervising teacher. In solving lesson plan problems, <b>the</b> <b>student</b> <b>teachers</b> shared <b>the</b> lesson plans with other <b>student</b> <b>teachers.</b> In solving time and <b>student</b> problems, <b>the</b> <b>student</b> <b>teachers</b> gave <b>the</b> <b>students</b> a lot of works in order that they didn’t have time to be noisy and to do other things. In solving material problems, <b>the</b> <b>student</b> <b>teachers</b> looked for it in the school library, browsed from the internet, and borrowed it from <b>the</b> English <b>student</b> <b>teachers</b> in other school. In solving facility problems, <b>the</b> <b>student</b> <b>teachers</b> utilized <b>the</b> facilities which were available in the classroom as the substitution of those available in language laboratory.

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{influence}} of the mentor’s approach and <b>the</b> <b>student</b> <b>teacher’s</b> relationship with his mentor on <b>the</b> <b>student</b> <b>teacher’s</b> perceived learning outcomes, measured by his perceived knowledge productivity. In a comparative case-based design including 12 couples of <b>student</b> <b>teachers</b> and their mentors we compared <b>the</b> <b>student</b> <b>teacher’s</b> perceived knowledge productivity for groups based on the experienced mentor’s approach in the mentoring conversation and <b>the</b> <b>student</b> <b>teacher’s</b> relationship with his mentor. The findings of this study suggest that: •	The mentor’s approach in the mentoring conversation does not significantly influence <b>the</b> <b>student</b> <b>teacher’s</b> perceived knowledge productivity. We compared two approaches: a scaffolding and prescriptive ‘high road’ approach and an exploring ‘low road’ approach. •	<b>Student</b> <b>teachers</b> who have a positive relationship with their mentor have higher perceived knowledge productivity. <b>The</b> <b>student</b> <b>teacher’s</b> relationship with his mentor was measured on three variables: <b>student</b> <b>teacher’s</b> satisfaction with his mentor, experienced effect of the mentoring and closeness in the mentoring relationship. Our findings indicate that <b>the</b> relationship between <b>student</b> <b>teacher</b> and mentor influences <b>the</b> <b>student</b> <b>teacher’s</b> perceived learning outcomes. Therefore more attention in matching <b>student</b> <b>teachers</b> and mentors is desirable. A high closeness in the relationship also has a positive influence on <b>the</b> <b>student</b> <b>teacher’s</b> perceived learning outcomes. It would be recommendable to reconsider the detached way a teacher educator is currently mentoring his <b>student</b> <b>teacher.</b> Although no significant influence for mentor’s approach to perceived knowledge productivity is found, we did see slightly higher scores for <b>the</b> group of <b>student</b> <b>teachers</b> who experienced a ‘low road’ approach. This suggests that our ‘low road’ might facilitate learning. If this finding can be generalized to all mentoring, mentors can deliberately use this approach to increase <b>student</b> <b>teacher’s</b> learning outcomes. We also found that the experimental model on mentor’s approach used in this study might not be correct or complete. We suggest improving the instrument used to measure the mentor’s approach by adding a category ‘explanation of practical knowledge’ and suggest changing the level of measurement from propositions to paragraphs or turns taken in the conversation...|$|R

The {{results of this study}} show that 39. 6 % of <b>the</b> <b>student</b> <b>teachers</b> and 32. 6 % of the general population reported voice complaints at the moment and/or over the past year (p= 0. 198). The association between various risk factors (vocal loading factors, physical factors, environmental factors and psycho-emotional factors) and voice complaints were examined. Vocal load was reported in both <b>the</b> <b>student</b> <b>teachers</b> and <b>the</b> general population (p= 0. 322). Among the subjects with voice complaints, <b>the</b> <b>student</b> <b>teachers</b> were significantly more of the opinion than the general population that environmental irritants in the classroom (p= 0. 001) and the composition of the group they communicate with (p= 0. 033) have a negative influence on their voice.

Remarkably, over a third of <b>the</b> <b>student</b> <b>teachers</b> and one fifth of the general population with voice complaints were of the opinion that decrease of hearing has a negative influence on their voices (p= 0. 113). There {{was no significant difference in}} Voice Handicap Index (VHI) scores (p= 0. 284) and impact of voice complaints among <b>student</b> <b>teachers</b> and <b>the</b> general population. Over 15 % of <b>the</b> <b>student</b> <b>teachers</b> and <b>the</b> general population with voice complaints reported being or having been disabled due to the voice problem, probably reflecting the severity of the voice problem (p= 0. 838). The groups reporting voice complaints and disability in relation to their voice complaints have significantly higher VHI scores than those without voice complaints and disability, which indicates a higher psychosocial impact of voice complaints. Only around a third of <b>the</b> <b>student</b> <b>teachers</b> and <b>the</b> general population with voice complaints sought paramedical care (p= 0. 656) /treatment (p= 0. 361) for their voice complaint. Only a minority of <b>student</b> <b>teachers</b> (18. 6 %) and the general population (29. 5 %) with voice complaints were of the opinion that the number of people they communicate with has a negative influence on their voice (p= 0. 120). Only around a third of <b>the</b> <b>student</b> <b>teachers</b> and less than a tenth of the general population with voice complaints were of the view that they would develop a voice complaint due to their profession (p= 0. 003). Less than half of <b>the</b> <b>student</b> <b>teachers</b> and less than one fifth of the general population with voice complaints were aware of the potential risks of their profession on their voice (p= 0. 002). Voice complaints appear to have a multifactorial genesis. <b>The</b> <b>student</b> <b>teachers</b> are not sufficiently aware of the impact of the various risk factors on their voice.
