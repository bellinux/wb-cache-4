Against {{the advice of}} his doctors, he {{returned to}} the Marquesas, where the tropical climate was particularly unsuitable for his lungs. In June, after selling the Askoy II, he rented a small house in Atuona on the island of Hiva-Oa. In July, he renewed his pilot's licence and took advanced flying lessons with his friend Michel Gauthier. He purchased a <b>twin-engine</b> <b>plane,</b> which he named Jojo in memory of his lost friend. This enabled him to travel more easily from Hiva-Oa to Tahiti. He also used the private plane to transport food and other supplies to the inhabitants of the neighbouring islands.|$|E

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} a forecast of air traffic in the future. In detail it {{is dedicated to the}} two largest producers in the market, Airbus and Boeing. The thesis analyzes which airliners of these manufacturers are likely to be successful in the future. In particular it focuses on new or being developed aircraft. In the final part it explores which factors influence future demand and how the orders may regionally differ. From the bachelor thesis follows that in the future the greatest interest will be in the single-aisle aircrafts for short routes. In terms of the medium and long routes, the widebody <b>twin-engine</b> <b>planes</b> will be mostly demanded...|$|R

Upon obtaining her license, she received two job offers: {{one as a}} flight-instructor at the Royal Aviation Club, and the other as a co-pilot for <b>twin-engine</b> <b>planes</b> with the Air-Asseman Airline. However, {{she was unable to}} pursue a career or further her training in this field due to the revolution in Iran.

2500|$|In October 2013 at the Seoul International Aerospace & Defense Exhibition, two concept {{models for}} the KF-X fighter were displayed. [...] KAI's model, the KFX-E, was {{designed}} by the company as a single-engine aircraft with most systems developed for the T-50 trainer and no internal weapons bays. [...] Experience from the T-50, and support provided by Lockheed for that aircraft, {{was seen as a}} cost-effective approach, as KAI officials saw a smaller and cheaper proposal to finally get the program to launch and enter service around the mid-2020s. [...] There are two versions of the KFX-E available, the standard one with a single fin and an optional one with two that would require more development work but has less radar reflection. [...] Although the KFX-E was smaller than the F-35 Lightning II, it was heavier than both the T-50 and F-16, with a 14 percent higher internal fuel capacity than the F-16C Block 40 at 6.36 tons. [...] Its larger wing compared to the F-16 would produce more drag and make it accelerate slower. [...] The other model was designed by Seoul's Agency for Defense Development, who became a competitor to KAI when they judged the ADD design for a <b>twin-engine</b> <b>plane</b> requiring more domestic systems development as too ambitious. [...] There are actually two ADD proposals, the C103 and C203, both weighing 11 tons empty. [...] They propose initially fielding a low-observable aircraft, then later versions would have full stealth and internal weapons bays. [...] The ADD designs have the advantage of being worked on with Indonesia, the main foreign partner. [...] The C103 and KFX-E have similar tail-aft sections, while the C203 has forward horizontal stabilizers.|$|E
