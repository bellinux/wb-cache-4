5|$|Similar to {{his actions}} in leaving Lyon, Ben Arfa responded <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>statement</b> {{by telling the}} French sports {{newspaper}} L'Equipe {{that he would not}} be returning to La Commanderie, Marseille's training facility, and would not play with the team for the remainder of the season. He also stated that his relationship with Deschamps had turned sour and was beyond repair. Ben Arfa confirmed his intentions by travelling to Newcastle upon Tyne, without authorization, with hopes that Newcastle and Marseille would come to an agreement. After returning to Marseille, he missed several training sessions with his parent club and was, subsequently, left off the match day squad for two league matches against Valenciennes and Lorient. Ben Arfa's number 10 was later given to new signing André-Pierre Gignac, which signaled a transfer was imminent.|$|E

30|$|Segments for {{reasoning}} episodes {{begin with}} a statement concerning a particular topic or concept that conveys useful information for others. The episode was extended when additional <b>statements</b> from <b>the</b> same person or others served <b>to</b> supplement <b>the</b> initial <b>statement.</b> <b>The</b> segment could end in three ways: (1) no responses from others regarding the topic before a new topic is initiated, (2) general agreement among team members, or (3) with a conflicting statement rather than supplementing statement (which begins a “conflict episode”). The reasoning episodes include three categories as observational, calculation, and procedural. The observational category refers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>statements</b> that are inferred from given text, information, or data. The calculation category refers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>statements</b> that include calculation procedures initiated and completed by team members by using given information or data. And the procedural category refers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>statements</b> that indicate propositions about the course of action through reasoning or hypotheses.|$|R
