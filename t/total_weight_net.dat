40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} endophyte effect on plant earliness, compatible host-endophyte combinations including four genotypes of tall fescue and two genotypes of meadow fescue were selected {{and used in}} this study. One tiller-part of each genotype was treated using a fungicide mixture of Propiconazole and Folicur. New tillers of endophyte-infected and endophyte-free plants were planted in the field according to a complete block design with three replications. The traits including days to head emergence, days to 50 % anthesis, days to maturity initiation, number of heads (as a weekly measurement), <b>total</b> seed <b>weight,</b> <b>net</b> seed <b>weight</b> and empty seed weigh were measured. Results showed that endophytes can enhance head emergence, maturity initiation and periodical seed yield. Days to 50 % anthesis, and days to maturity initiation were also reduced. Head numbers in some genotypes increased up to 2 times. Increase in net seed yield may show some physiological alterations in plant such as hormonal balance alteration which may provide better seed setting in infected plants. Based on this study, we concluded that endophytic fungi can induce earliness in infected host plants...|$|R
5000|$|The UKRA has {{negotiated}} {{an exemption}} so that model rocket fliers can obtain some AP motors in limited quantities {{without the need}} for an explosives licence. Since 4 December 2007, model rocketeers have been able to purchase AP motors with a <b>net</b> <b>weight</b> less than 1 kg of propellant without an Explosives Licence. They can also store motors up to a <b>total</b> <b>net</b> <b>weight</b> of 5 kg without needing an Explosives Licence or Registered Store Certificate. They will still require an RCA document. This can be obtained from the UK HSE by writing an appropriate letter to them requesting an exemption for model rocket motors.

40|$|The {{floating}} cage device {{described in the}} present study is {{the first of its kind}} in Indian seas and consists of a cylindrical {{floating cage}} structure along with suitable netting materials for mariculture of finfishes and shellfishes in open sea. The cage structure was made of high density polyethylene (HDPE) top support, inner and outer rings and a middle catwalk. The inner and outer collar had provisions for connecting outer predator, inner growout and bird nets. Catwalk in the middle served for regular cage management and safety of the workers. There were HDPE vertical and diagonal supports for the cage frame. Ballast was used at the bottom to maintain the shape of the cage. The <b>total</b> <b>weight</b> of the cage frame was 447. 7 kg in air and 74. 2 kg in water. The floatation force of the cage was 211. 2 kg while the effective floatation force was 131. 8 kg. The <b>total</b> <b>weight</b> of <b>netting</b> materials including rope was 46. 7 kg in air and 5. 2 kg in water. A floating net cage device of 6 m inner and 8 m outer collar dia with 6 m net depth and an effective inner volume of 169. 7 m 3 was designed and successfully tested in open sea, during the present study. The floating sea cage structure and nets were designed and standardised in such a way to suit the current and wave conditions of Indian seas...|$|R
