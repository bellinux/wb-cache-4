5|$|At the Springfield Derby, Duncan {{wins the}} race. Enraged, the furious jockeys chase after Homer and Bart {{wielding}} swords to hunt {{them down and}} destroy them. With the help of Marge and Lisa, who spray water on the jockeys with a hose, Homer is able to put the jockeys into a garbage bag and get them sent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dump.</b> Afterwards, Homer and Bart prepare for Duncan's retirement from racing {{to start a new}} life as a stud. President Clinton then shows up at the Simpsons's house to see Lisa, presenting her with a plaque. Clinton says that Ogdenville was wrong to use glowsticks and that Springfield Elementary's band is the true champion.|$|E

500|$|By season 8, {{the show}} {{had begun to}} explore episodes {{revolving}} around secondary characters. Reverend Lovejoy was selected for this episode because, aside from being noted as [...] "the priest who didn't care", he had not had much character development. This was the first episode that Donick Cary wrote for The Simpsons. He was disappointed that his first story was about [...] "Marge's crisis with faith." [...] The trip <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dump</b> was inspired by Donick Cary's youth, {{in which he would}} often go [...] "dump picking". This led to the writers deciding to have Homer's face on a discarded box, which became the Mr. Sparkle subplot. To help create the advertisement, the writers watched videos of many Japanese commercials. An original scene from Lovejoy's flashback showed that Jasper Beardley preceded him as minister of the First Church of Springfield. The solution for how Mr. Sparkle resembles Homer was written by George Meyer, after hours of time had been spent {{trying to come up with}} a realistic ending. Matsumura Fishworks was named after Ichiro Matsumura, a friend of David X. Cohen.|$|E
2500|$|On 20 October, {{aircraft}} of 11 Squadron on photographic reconnaissance near Douai, {{were attacked}} by , which shot down two aircraft and damaged two more. Nine aircraft of 27 Squadron made a long-range attack on Aulnoye junction near Maubeuge, for no loss and 70 Squadron aircraft which photographed Valenciennes and Le Quesnoy returned. Thirty-three German aircraft crossed the British front line and made many attacks on British aircraft; three German aircraft were shot down and seventeen claimed damaged. German night bombers attacked Querrieu, Corbie and Longueau, where an ammunition waggon was blown up; British aircraft attacked Vélu and Péronne. After the German morning attack on [...] (Schwaben Redoubt) on 21 October, the British attack planned for the afternoon followed up the German repulse, {{with the assistance of}} contact patrols from two squadrons, which in good visibility directed artillery-fire and destroyed ten gun-pits, damaged fourteen and blew up seven ammunition pits. Zone calls from British aircraft silenced many German guns, including nine German batteries firing on the Canadian troops attacking Regina Trench. Long-range bombers attacked an ammunition dump at Ath (near Mons) which had been reported by a French spy. An aircraft bombed from [...] and set fire <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dump,</b> before the formation returned safely. Quéant station was bombed by thirty more aircraft and escorts, which were intercepted over the target and one bomber shot down. An escort pilot flying a Nieuport 17 turned back, after the bombers reached British lines but was then forced down in a dogfight with a faster German aircraft. On other parts of the Somme front two German aircraft were shot down, three damaged and ten driven down.|$|E

25|$|Now <b>the</b> {{city had}} <b>to</b> {{react to this}} revelation. Later the same year, the real {{property}} committee of the city forbade the disposal of waste oil and other hazardous waste materials at <b>the</b> <b>dumping</b> ground, but later, due to financial considerations, it had <b>to</b> allow <b>the</b> use of the site as <b>the</b> <b>dumping</b> ground of <b>the</b> Helsinki City Gas Works.

50|$|But, {{the high}} levels of ammonia and {{phosphorus}} due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dumping</b> of sewage wastewater have led to excessive algae growth in the lake. When these excessive algae growths die, bacteria decompose the dead algae using large quantities of oxygen, which causes eutrophic and low-oxygen conditions. The low oxygen levels lead <b>to</b> <b>the</b> choking out of fish and plants, especially in the deeper areas of the lake.|$|R

40|$|Very high {{resolution}} seismic investigations {{were carried out}} over a munition dumpsite in the Bornholm Basin, south-western Baltic Sea. After WW 2 over 32, 000 tons of chemical weapons were dumped in this area. The aim of <b>the</b> investigations was <b>to</b> image <b>the</b> internal structure of <b>the</b> dumpsite and <b>to</b> identify possible natural hazards with regard <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dumped</b> war material. Two geophysical surveys were {{carried out in the}} summers of 2006 and 2007. During the surveys, acoustic sources with a distinct frequency spectrum (parametric echosounder, sparker, boomer) were deployed simultaneously. This approach proved very fruitful as it allowed <b>to</b> study <b>the</b> sediments in a wide depth range and in the highest possible detail. In total, seven seismic-stratigraphic units have been identified, related to different stages in the Holocene and late glacial history. Water depths range roughly between 96 m in the north and 70 m in the south where the basin shallows and older glacial sediments are outcropping. The seafloor topography at the dumpsite is generally quite flat, locally marked by small pit-like features that are probably related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dumping</b> impact. Small-scale fluid escape features are present throughout the dumpsite area. Large-scale doming occurs locally and is possibly linked <b>to</b> <b>the</b> migration of deep thermogenic gas. A large number of buried objects were identified on the acoustic data. Their burial depth is generally less than 1 m. The data confirm the wide variety of dumped war material, ranging from bombs and shells to encasements and containers. The distribution of <b>the</b> objects seems <b>to</b> be very heterogeneous, with locally high concentrations and areas of low object density. Four different shipwrecks were identified but their relation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dumped</b> warfare is not clear...|$|R

This pre-empted the publication of DNV's report, which endorsed Shell's initial estimates for many pollutants. Greenpeace noted that its opposition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>dumping</b> had never been solely based on {{the presence or absence}} of oil, however, and that opposition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> disposal plan was part of a larger campaign opposing <b>the</b> <b>dumping</b> of all waste into the North Sea.|$|R
