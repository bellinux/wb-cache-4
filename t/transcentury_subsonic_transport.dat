40|$|Long-haul {{transport}} plane configurations are discussed {{that are considered}} technically feasible within a practical level of near-term technology. Supersonic and transonic aircraft are considered, as well as different types of <b>subsonic</b> <b>transports.</b> It is indicated that superior second-generation supersonic transports are quite feasible technically; in particular, it is shown that problems of fuel consumption, efficient overland flight, and questions on noise and nitric oxides have straightforward engineering solutions. Transonic aircraft are practical but {{would have to have}} a different geometry than subsonic aircraft to provide the versatility necessary to compete at one end of their capability with supersonic transports and at the other end, for shorter ranges, with <b>subsonic</b> <b>transports.</b> The shape of <b>subsonic</b> <b>transports</b> is not expected to change noticeably, although recent advances of airfoil technology imply that new <b>subsonic</b> <b>transports</b> would have wings with higher aspect ratios and somewhat less sweep.

40|$|The first AIAA Drag Prediction Workshop (DPW), held in June 2001, {{evaluated}} {{the results from}} an extensive N-version test {{of a collection of}} Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes CFD codes. The code-to-code scatter was more than an order of magnitude larger than desired for design and experimental validation of cruise conditions for a <b>subsonic</b> <b>transport</b> configuration.

40|$|There {{are many}} {{technologies}} under development {{that have the}} potential to enable large fuel burn reductions in the 2025 timeframe for <b>subsonic</b> <b>transport</b> aircraft relative to the current fleet. This paper identifies a potential technology suite and analyzes the fuel burn reduction potential of these technologies when integrated into advanced <b>subsonic</b> <b>transport</b> concepts. Advanced tube-and-wing concepts are developed in the single aisle and large twin aisle class, and a hybrid-wing-body concept is developed for the large twin aisle class.
