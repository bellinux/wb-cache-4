2500|$|The kype grows rapidly from bony needles proliferating {{from the}} tip of the dentary (the {{anterior}} and largest of the bones making up the lower jaw). The needles form a mesh, but do not interfere with <b>the</b> <b>connective</b> <b>tissues</b> used by bone marrow. At the snout, the needles strengthen into Sharpey's fibres. The speed at which the kype skeleton develops results in many osteoblasts and proteoglycans appearing along the growth zone. The dentary itself is made of compact bone, but the kype tissue contains chondrocytes and cartilage. [...] The kype formation process has been described as [...] "making bone as fast as possible and with as little material as possible".|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{laterally}} positioned flap {{has been}} shown to effectively treat gingival recession. The average percentage of root coverage obtained with laterally positioned flap was 68 %. When full-thickness laterally positioned flap was combined with <b>connective</b> <b>tissue</b> graft, <b>the</b> average percentage of root coverage was 88 %. The purpose of this case report was to evaluate percentage of root coverage by laterally positioned double flap with <b>the</b> <b>connective</b> <b>tissue</b> graft. Patients and Methods: A patient with Miller class III gingival recession of 9 mm was treated by laterally positioned double flap with <b>the</b> <b>connective</b> <b>tissue</b> graft. <b>The</b> <b>connective</b> <b>tissue</b> graft was obtained by "trap-door" technique. Result: At the end of twelve months 83 % root coverage was successfully achieved. Conclusion: The laterally positioned double flap with <b>the</b> <b>connective</b> <b>tissue</b> graft can be used for treatment of gingival recession defect successfully...|$|R
