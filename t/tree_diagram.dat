Most current theories no longer allow the ternary tree structure of (9a) and (9b), so the theme and the goal/recipient are seen in a hierarchical relationship within a binary branching structure.|$|E

25|$|Richard Kayne {{proposed}} {{the idea of}} unambiguous paths {{as an alternative to}} c-commanding relationships, which is the type of structure seen in examples (8). The idea of unambiguous paths stated that an antecedent and an anaphor should be connected via an unambiguous path. This means that the line connecting an antecedent and an anaphor cannot be broken by another argument. When applied to ditransitive verbs, this hypothesis introduces the structure in diagram (8a). In this tree structure {{it can be seen that}} the same path can be traced from either DP to the verb. <b>Tree</b> <b>diagram</b> (7b) illustrates this structure with an example from English. This analysis was a step toward binary branching trees, which was a theoretical change that was furthered by Larson's VP-shell analysis.|$|E
500|$|Darwin proposes sexual selection, {{driven by}} {{competition}} between males for mates, to explain sexually dimorphic {{features such as}} lion manes, deer antlers, peacock tails, bird songs, and the bright plumage of some male birds. He analysed sexual selection more fully in The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex (1871). Natural selection was expected to work very slowly in forming new species, but given the effectiveness of artificial selection, he could [...] "see no limit {{to the amount of}} change, to the beauty and infinite complexity of the coadaptations between all organic beings, one with another and with their physical conditions of life, which may be effected in the long course of time by nature's power of selection". Using a <b>tree</b> <b>diagram</b> and calculations, he indicates the [...] "divergence of character" [...] from original species into new species and genera. He describes branches falling off as extinction occurred, while new branches formed in [...] "the great Tree of life... with its ever branching and beautiful ramifications".|$|E

2500|$|In the <b>tree</b> <b>diagram</b> on the right, as {{adopted from}} Poljakov, names for (original) Baltic tones have been equated {{with those of}} modern Standard Lithuanian and the falling tone in Latvian is {{depicted}} as derived from a Baltic rising tone. According to some it was Lithuanian that [...] "switched places" [...] the Baltic tones. This might explain why most languages call a rising tone [...] "acute" [...] while in Baltic terminology a falling tone is [...] "acute." [...] Some controversy surrounds Poljakov's model, it has been harshly criticized by Frederik Kortlandt. Kortlandt contends that broken tone in Latvian and Žemaitian is a reflex of a now disappeared glottal stop in Balto-Slavic not preserved in Aukštaitian (Standard Lithuanian) or Slavic languages and not a recent development of acute.|$|E

50|$|In the {{original}} calculation, gauge anomalies, mixed anomalies, and gravitational anomalies {{were expected to}} arise from a hexagon Feynman diagram. For the special choice of the gauge group SO(32) or E8 x E8, however, the anomaly factorizes and may be cancelled by a <b>tree</b> <b>diagram.</b> In string theory, this indeed occurs. The <b>tree</b> <b>diagram</b> describes the exchange of a virtual quantum of the B-field. It is somewhat counterintuitive to see that a <b>tree</b> <b>diagram</b> cancels a one-loop diagram, but in reality, both of these diagrams arise as one-loop diagrams in superstring theory in which the anomaly cancellation is more transparent.|$|E
