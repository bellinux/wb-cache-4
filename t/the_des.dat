5|$|The first {{inhabitants}} {{of what would}} become the village of Lincolnshire were Native American Potawatomi migrants from Canada and Wisconsin. The tribesmen left these northern places in the 16thcentury in search of a warmer, more temperate climate. The first Europeans to visit the area were the French Jesuit explorers Father Jacques Marquette and Louis Jolliet. Shortly after arriving in 1673 at the site of what later became Waukegan, they sailed down <b>the</b> <b>Des</b> Plaines River and made contact with the local Potawatomi, who would dominate the area by 1768. One of the Potawatomi villages that they encountered stretched along the west bank of <b>the</b> <b>Des</b> Plaines River, from what later became Illinois Route 22 south to Aptakisic Road, the first real settlement in the Lincolnshire and Half Day region.|$|E

5|$|US136 was {{designated}} nationally in 1951. In the Keokuk area, it was overlaid upon US61 from west of Alexandria, Missouri, over <b>the</b> <b>Des</b> Moines River into Iowa, and into downtown Keokuk. South of downtown, it replaced Iowa161, which crossed the Mississippi River on the Keokuk Rail Bridge. Since its designation, the route has largely remained the same.

5|$|After the six 735kV wires {{split up}} {{into two groups}} of three power lines each, the HVDC line follows the eastern group, and the western set diverges away. The line remains {{overhead}} until it reaches {{the north shore of}} the Saint Lawrence River near Grondines, where the 450kV HVDC line descends into an underwater tunnel traversing the river. The power line surfaces on the south shore near Lotbinière substation. After the river crossing, the line enters into the Nicolet terminal near Sainte-Eulalie, northeast of Drummondville. South of the terminal, the line heads south and after a relatively short distance, it enters <b>the</b> <b>Des</b> Cantons close to Sherbrooke.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-1960s, {{directors}} of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., declared {{the need for a}} new building. Paul Mellon, a primary benefactor of the gallery and a member of its building committee, set to work with his assistant J. Carter Brown (who became gallery director in 1969) to find an architect. The new structure would be located to the east of the original building, and tasked with two functions: offer a large space for public appreciation of various popular collections; and house office space as well as archives for scholarship and research. They likened the scope of the new facility to the Library of Alexandria. After inspecting Pei's work at <b>the</b> <b>Des</b> Moines Art Center in Iowa and the Johnson Museum at Cornell University, they offered him the commission.|$|E
5|$|Lincolnshire is {{a village}} in Vernon Township, Lake County, in the U.S. state of Illinois. The village is a {{northern}} suburb of Chicago. The population of Lincolnshire was 7,275 at the 2010 census. Lincolnshire was incorporated on August 5, 1957, from the unincorporated Half Day area when land was purchased to build a residential subdivision. The community underwent an aggressive era of expansion from 1983 to the 1990s. <b>The</b> <b>Des</b> Plaines River bisects the village, passing from north to south; Illinois Route 22 also divides the village into two parts, crossing the village from east to west.|$|E
5|$|Lincolnshire {{lies in a}} {{floodplain}} region, {{a consequence}} of the presence of <b>the</b> <b>Des</b> Plaines River and the proximity a fork of the Chicago River on the far east border. A third factor involves small Indian Creek, which runs north of Lincolnshire. The village participates in the National Flood Insurance Program, a Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) project, to alleviate a portion of the costs of flood damage that may overtax affected village residents. The village also implements the Community Rating System, a disaster readiness plan.|$|E

5|$|Taylor formed Stone Sour in 1992, {{playing in}} <b>the</b> <b>Des</b> Moines area, {{and working on}} a demo. He joined Slipknot in 1997 to replace their {{original}} vocalist and has subsequently released five studio albums with them.

Taylor was also found, by VVN Music, to possess the second-widest vocal range of any known singer in popular music {{with a range of}} five and a half octaves. He was beaten only by Mike Patton (six octaves).|$|E
5|$|The Village of Lincolnshire {{negotiated}} {{and signed}} an agreement with the City of Highland Park in 1982 to create a more efficient means of obtaining water by purchasing filtered water from Lake Michigan. The Village of Lincolnshire also monitors the public pumps and water meters of private residents. Lincolnshire is served by a sanitary sewer that connects to the Lake County Sewage Treatment Plant, which lies on <b>the</b> <b>Des</b> Plaines River outside the Village limits; the disposal of wastewater is left to the government of Lake County rather than the Village of Lincolnshire itself. Lincolnshire also runs a network of storm drains that run directly into <b>the</b> <b>Des</b> Plaines River; to protect the river's cleaniness, the village government has outlawed dumping of most chemicals into the network of storm drains. A plan to repair city streets was also implemented in 1982, and continues; the Village also offers public services to clear the streets during the fall and winter from fallen leaves and snow respectively, although on its arterial roads (Illinois Routes 22, 45, and Aptakisic Road) residents are provided with bags to clear their curbs during autumn months as it is not possible for the Village to safely clear these roads of leaf debris. The Village of Lincolnshire regularly sweeps other streets within its borders.|$|E
5|$|The oldest {{artifacts}} {{found in}} Iowa are Clovis points, large lanceolate points found occasionally {{in all parts}} of the state except for <b>the</b> <b>Des</b> Moines Lobe. Possible sources of game were giant Pleistocene megafauna, including mammoth, mastodon, and giant forms of bison, all of which are now extinct. While widespread, only two Clovis sites have been excavated in Iowa. The Rummells-Maske site is a Clovis site in Cedar County; unfortunately, this site was damaged by plowing, although 20 points and point fragments were recovered. The Carlisle Clovis Cache Site in Warren County contained 38 unfinished stone tools that appear to date to the Clovis period, but these results have not yet been published.|$|E
