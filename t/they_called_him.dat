25|$|Robert Antoine Pinchon {{was born}} into an artistic and {{literary}} environment. His father, Robert Pinchon, a librarian, journalist, playwright and drama critic, was an intimate friend of Guy de Maupassant and also became a close protege of Gustave Flaubert. Maupassant and Robert Pinchon (La Tôque, as <b>they</b> <b>called</b> <b>him)</b> co-wrote in 1875 a script for a play entitled A la Feuille de Rose, Maison Turque, {{on the subject of}} eroticism and prostitution. The piece was presented officially on 15 May 1877 at the studio of Maurice Leloir, in front of Gustave Flaubert, Émile Zola, Ivan Turgenev and eight elegantly dressed masked women.|$|E

The decision actually got backfired for his parents but worked in the well-being of Nepali cricket. For {{a guy who was}} bowling over 130 kmmph, he was already a national team material. <b>They</b> <b>called</b> <b>him</b> for the camps in Kathmandu and now, impressive with the raw pace and the physique he carries, Karan is now expected to be the next generation seamer of Nepali cricket.

25|$|Cutolo openly {{supported}} the young inmates, who were confronted with abuse, brutality, physical aggression and rape. He {{provided them with}} advice and protection from the brutalities of other inmates. At {{the same time they}} learned how to behave as a good picciotto, the lowest entry level into the Camorra. Cutolo challenged the old Camorra bosses and gave the youngsters a structure to belong to: “The new Camorra must have a statute, a structure, an oath, a complete ceremony, a ritual that must excite people {{to the point that they}} would risk their lives for this organization.” Cutolo was revered by his soldiers. <b>They</b> <b>called</b> <b>him</b> Prince and kissed his left hand as if he were a bishop.|$|E
500|$|Speaking {{about the}} way the season reveals the name Daredevil, DeKnight {{explained}} that several options had been brought up, such as [...] "one of the versions in the comics where {{when he was a kid}} people used to taunt him with the name Daredevil", which did not fit in the world of the series, or having Ben Urich give the character the name, but the timing for that did not work due to Urich's death before the final Daredevil suit was introduced. It was decided that instead of having the name Daredevil said onscreen, it would be easier to introduce it through the media as a newspaper headline. On why this was not done for Wilson Fisk as Kingpin, DeKnight stated that he felt it would [...] "get a little bit silly.... we went, 'Oh <b>they</b> <b>called</b> <b>him</b> Daredevil! Oh <b>they</b> <b>called</b> <b>him</b> Kingpin!'," [...] and was unable to come up with another natural way for the name Kingpin to come up, so it was decided to leave that for a later time.|$|E
500|$|As part {{of press}} junkets {{promoting}} the album, Idol reportedly insisted attending journalists {{be familiar with}} cyberpunk fiction. It was also revealed that Idol was not entirely as familiar with the genre as he had proclaimed. William Gibson reported in an interview, [...] "A London journalist told me when Billy did his 'Cyberpunk' press junket over there, he made it a condition of getting an interview with him, that every journalist had to have read Neuromancer...Anyway, they all did but when they met with Billy, {{the first thing that}} became really apparent was that Billy hadn't read it. So <b>they</b> <b>called</b> <b>him</b> on it, and he said he didn't need to..he just absorbed it through a kinda osmosis." ...|$|E

500|$|The Orioles were {{planning}} to keep Ripken in Rochester through 1981, but searching for improvement {{in the second half}} of the 1981 season, <b>they</b> <b>called</b> <b>him</b> up on August 7. Manager Earl Weaver planned to have Ripken take over the role of utility infielder Wayne Krenchicki, who had been sent down to make room for Ripken on the roster. He made his debut on August 10 as a pinch runner for Ken Singleton in the 12th inning of a game against the Kansas City Royals. Ripken scored on a hit by John Lowenstein, giving the Orioles the win. His first major league hit came six days later against Dennis Lamp of the Chicago White Sox. Ripken finished the season batting [...]182 without an extra-base hit as the Orioles finished fourth {{in the second half of}} the season.|$|E

He said he was [...] "100% sure Blythe pushed Nosek with both hands." [...] He further said that Blythe's {{behavior}} deviated from all the concerts he had attended in the past, commenting that Blythe was visibly furious. He further claimed that Nosek {{was not the first}} person to be chased off the stage by Blythe, with another fan being kicked, choked and receiving a punch from Blythe. Jebavý corroborated Blythe's testimony that Blythe asked [...] "Are you okay?" [...] after Nosek fell and that the crowd gave him a positive reply. However, as Nosek fell sick after the concert, <b>they</b> <b>called</b> <b>him</b> an ambulance. According to Jebavý, the band had not warned the fans against getting on stage and the security guards did not pay much attention to it.|$|E

500|$|The Marshalls never officially adopted Morrison {{because they}} {{believed}} that {{to go through the}} procedure while his parents were still living would appear unusual to the public. Wanting to keep the situation private, they instead made a special arrangement with his parents. President Wilson felt obliged to acknowledge the boy as theirs and sent the couple a note that simply said, [...] "With congratulations to the baby. Wilson". Morrison lived with the Marshalls {{for the rest of his}} life. In correspondence they referred to him as Morrison Marshall, but in person <b>they</b> <b>called</b> <b>him</b> Izzy. Lois took him to see many doctors and spent all her available time trying to nurse him back to health, but his condition worsened and he died in February 1920, just before his fourth birthday. His death devastated Marshall, who wrote in his memoir that Izzy [...] "was and is and ever will be so sacred to me".|$|E
500|$|After {{two months}} of planning, Ravel made a four-month tour of North America in 1928, playing and conducting. His fee was a {{guaranteed}} minimum of $10,000 and a constant supply of Gauloises cigarettes. He appeared {{with most of the}} leading orchestras in Canada and the US and visited twenty-five cities. Audiences were enthusiastic and the critics were complimentary. At an all-Ravel programme conducted by Serge Koussevitzky in New York the entire audience stood up and applauded as the composer took his seat. Ravel was touched by this spontaneous gesture and observed, [...] "You know, this doesn't happen to me in Paris." [...] Orenstein, commenting that this tour marked the zenith of Ravel's international reputation, lists its non-musical highlights as a visit to Poe's house in New York, and excursions to Niagara Falls and the Grand Canyon. Ravel was unmoved by his new international celebrity. He commented that the critics' recent enthusiasm was of no more importance than their earlier judgment, when <b>they</b> <b>called</b> <b>him</b> [...] "the most perfect example of insensitivity and lack of emotion".|$|E

2500|$|The {{widely publicized}} lynching of Leo Frank, a Jew, in Georgia in 1915 by {{a mob of}} Southerners caused many Jews to [...] "become acutely {{conscious}} of {{the similarities and differences}} between themselves and blacks." [...] Some had an increased sense of solidarity with blacks, as the trial exposed widespread anti-Semitism in Georgia. The trial also pitted Jews against blacks because Frank's defense attorneys suggested black janitor Jim Conley was guilty of the murder of the white girl. <b>They</b> <b>called</b> <b>him</b> a [...] "dirty, filthy, black, drunken, lying, nigger."
