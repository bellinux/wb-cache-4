5|$|Toward {{the end of}} 1950, the executors of {{the estate}} of Thomas S.

The Don Lee Broadcasting System, with its major station groups KHJ in Los Angeles and KFRC in San Francisco and its shares in the Mutual Broadcasting System, was sold to General Tire (which already had a stake in Mutual via its Yankee Network holdings). Around the same time, Mutual acquired the television broadcast rights to the World Series and All-Star Game for the next six years. Mutual may have been reindulging in TV network dreams or simply taking advantage of a long-standing business relationship; in either case, the broadcast rights were sold <b>to</b> <b>NBC</b> in time for the following season's games at an enormous profit.|$|E
