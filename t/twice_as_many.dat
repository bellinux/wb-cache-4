5|$|More {{than half}} of the state's households, based on an average family size of four persons, contributed a family member to fight in the war, making the effects of the {{conflict}} widely felt throughout the state. More Hoosiers died in the Civil War than in any other conflict. Although <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> Hoosiers served in World War II, almost <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> died in the Civil War. After the war, veterans programs were initiated to help wounded soldiers with housing, food, and other basic needs. In addition, orphanages and asylums were established to assist women and children.|$|E

5|$|Regardless of age, TBI {{rates are}} higher in males. Men suffer <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> TBIs as women do {{and have a}} {{fourfold}} risk of fatal head injury, and males account for two thirds of childhood and adolescent head trauma. However, when matched for severity of injury, women appear to fare more poorly than men.|$|E
50|$|The Bükk {{people lived}} a very {{different}} life from {{the residents of the}} long houses. Bükk homes are individual and rectangular, a few meters wide and about <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> long. <b>Many</b> are dug into the earth as wholly or partly subterranean. Others are wholly above ground, wattle and daub construction. The Bükk people sited their homes on hills, slopes, or in ravines. They used caves for sacred purposes, but may have lived there as well.|$|R
50|$|The Chinese Communist (CCF intervention) {{caused the}} group to move <b>twice</b> in <b>as</b> <b>many</b> weeks, first to Suwon AB (K-13), South Korea, then to Chinhae (K-10). From there the 18th FBG {{continued}} to support ground forces and carry out armed reconnaissance and interdiction missions. From November 1950 through January 1951, it earned a Distinguished Unit Citation for destroying roughly 2,400 enemy vehicles and severely damaging almost 500 more.|$|R
50|$|The Weinan Weihe Grand Bridge {{is a part}} of the Zhengzhou-Xi'an High-Speed Railway which connects Zhengzhou and Xi'an, in China. The {{bridge is}} 79732 m (49.5 Miles) long {{crossing}} the Wei River <b>twice,</b> <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>many</b> other rivers, highways and railways.

5|$|The D± signals used by low, full, {{and high}} speed are carried over a twisted pair (typically, unshielded) to reduce noise and crosstalk. SuperSpeed uses {{separate}} transmit and receive differential pairs, which additionally require shielding (typically, {{shielded twisted pair}} but twinax is also mentioned by the specification). Thus, to support SuperSpeed data transmission, cables contain <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> wires and are thus larger in diameter.|$|E
5|$|With {{the bowl}} game, Maryland {{finished}} {{the season with}} an 8–5 record. The win was Maryland's 600thin school history. Ralph Friedgen's postseason record improved to 4–2, which gave him <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> bowl wins as any other head coach in school history. For the 2008 season, Maryland stood 5–1in games decided by seven points or less and 8–0in games kicked off during daylight hours.|$|E
5|$|After {{the release}} of the Pocket PC version, in 2006 Chahi created a new Windows version {{targeted}} at Windows XP. Emmanuel Rivoire increased the resolution to 1280×800 pixels and Chahi created more detailed backgrounds. He found that his original choice to use polygons for the game characters enabled him to use the original character art at a higher resolution. The game still supports the original 320×200 resolution, as well as the original background art (as an option), and it features <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> checkpoints as the original, which makes it somewhat easier, as well as newly remixed sounds.|$|E
50|$|HD 173936 is a 6th {{magnitude}} star in {{the constellation}} Lyra, approximately 1200 light years away from Earth. It is a bluish white star of the spectral type B6V.

He also qualified for the U.S. Open on several occasions and represented Canada in three World Cups.|$|R
50|$|Some {{functional}} {{classes of}} genes {{are more likely}} to be bidirectionally paired than others. Genes implicated in DNA repair are five times more likely to be regulated by bidirectional promoters than by unidirectional promoters. Chaperone proteins are three times more likely, and mitochondrial genes are more than <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> likely. <b>Many</b> basic housekeeping and cellular metabolic genes are regulated by bidirectional promoters.The overrepresentation of bidirectionally paired DNA repair genes associates these promoters with cancer. Forty-five percent of human somatic oncogenes seem to be regulated by bidirectional promoters - significantly more than non-cancer causing genes. Hypermethylation of the promoters between gene pairs WNT9A/CD558500, CTDSPL/BC040563, and KCNK15/BF195580 has been associated with tumors.|$|R
5|$|Arizona won {{the game}} 49–48 after scoring two touchdowns {{in the final two}} minutes to come back for the victory. As expected, the game was {{dominated}} by offense; Arizona and Nevada combined for 1234 total yards and 70 first downs. Despite losing the game, Nevada possessed the ball nearly twice as long and gained <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> rushing yards as Arizona. Arizona quarterback Matt Scott was named the game's offensive most valuable player (MVP), and teammate Marquis Flowers, a linebacker, was named the game's defensive MVP.|$|E
5|$|Britain, {{which had}} {{concluded}} in 1892 {{that it needed}} <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> cruisers as any potential enemy to adequately protect its empire's sea lanes, responded to the perceived threat by laying down its own large armoured cruisers. Between 1899 and 1905, it completed or laid down seven classes of this type, a total of 35 ships. This building program, in turn, prompted the French and Russians to increase their own construction. The Imperial German Navy began to build large armoured cruisers for use on their overseas stations, laying down eight between 1897 and 1906.|$|E
5|$|Dowding's {{insistence on}} waiting for AI led {{directly}} to his dismissal on 24 November 1940. Many historians and writers, including Bowen, have suggested his dismissal was unwise, and that his identification of AI radar as the only practical solution was ultimately correct. While this may be true, the cat's eye force did result {{in a number of}} kills during the Blitz, although their effectiveness was limited and quickly overshadowed by the night fighter force. In May 1941 cat's eye fighters claimed 106 kills to the night fighters' 79, but flew <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> sorties to do so.|$|E
50|$|In the 2006 summer, Vargas {{began playing}} abroad, his first stop being with Cyprus' APOP Kinyras FC, being {{instrumental}} as the side managed {{to remain in}} the First Division during his stay. He moved clubs in the same country in the January transfer window of 2009, signing with AEL Limassol and rejoining former Sporting (youth), Alverca and Leiria teammate Pedro Torrão; again an undisputed starter he provided several assists to his team's goals, also scoring <b>twice</b> in <b>as</b> <b>many</b> wins (against Doxa Katokopias F.C. for the game's only and at Nea Salamis Famagusta FC, a 3-1 win, both in the 2009-10 campaign).|$|R
50|$|When Peterborough were relegated {{from the}} First Division, Adcock {{was sold to}} Luton Town for £20,000 in August 1994, where he could only manage two {{substitute}} appearances, before being persuaded to return to Colchester United by manager Steve Wignall. Adcock returned {{in the summer of}} 1994, and he bagged another 28 league goals, featuring for the club at Wembley Stadium <b>twice</b> in <b>as</b> <b>many</b> years, losing in the 1997 Football League Trophy Final on penalties to Carlisle United, and gaining promotion to Division Two in the 1998 Football League Third Division play-off Final win over Torquay.|$|R
50|$|The season would, however, end in disappointment. On 19 August the Jets {{suffered}} {{their first}} domestic defeat in 3 {{years at the}} hands of the London Blitz, losing 28-24. This meant that the Jets would finish 2nd in the inaugural BAFL Premier division. The Jets would find themselves once more heading to Sheffield, having overcome the Bristol Aztecs in a hard fought battle which went to the wire, 13-7. They would be up against the Blitz, who had beaten previous perennial champions London Olympians <b>twice</b> in <b>as</b> <b>many</b> weeks. The game would end in defeat for the Jets, losing 14-6.|$|R
5|$|German {{intelligence}} {{suggested that}} the RAF was down to just 300 serviceable fighters on 17 August 1940, taking into consideration German pilots' claims and their estimates of British production capabilities. In fact, there were 855 machines serviceable, with another 289 at storage units and 84 at training units. These resources were included {{in a total of}} 1,438 fighters, <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> as at the beginning of July 1940. Expecting weakening opposition, the Luftwaffe prepared for a major action against RAF Sector Stations on 18 August.|$|E

In the Democratic primary Wolf faced and defeated Barnstable County Commissioner Sheila Lyons with nearly <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> votes. In the general election Wolf defeated Republican real estate developer James H. Crocker Jr. In his 2012 bid for re-election Wolf faced no competition in either a primary or general election. In 2014 Wolf was re-elected to his third term, defeating Republican Ron Beaty in the general election.|$|E
5|$|In {{a second}} major defeat for the Polish right wing, the {{elections}} were won by an SLD candidate, Aleksander Kwaśniewski, who received 51.72% of votes. A Solidarity call for new elections went unheeded, but the Sejm {{still managed to}} pass a resolution condemning the 1981 martial law (despite the SLD voting against). Meanwhile, the left-wing OPZZ trade union had acquired 2.5 million members, <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> as the contemporary Solidarity (with 1.3 million).|$|E

Comprehensive home wins against Doncaster Rovers, Carlisle United (in the League Cup) and Southampton followed, before a win away against Norwich City saw Rangers put together a five-game unbeaten streak.|$|R
5|$|Many {{objective}} measures {{show the}} positive impact of Hubble data on astronomy. Over 9,000 papers based on Hubble data {{have been published}} in peer-reviewed journals, and countless more have appeared in conference proceedings. Looking at papers several years after their publication, about one-third of all astronomy papers have no citations, while only 2% of papers based on Hubble data have no citations. On average, a paper based on Hubble data receives about <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>many</b> citations as papers based on non-Hubble data.

50|$|Oregon {{finished}} their first {{possession of the}} second quarter with a 28-yard field goal from Matt Wogan to put the game at 11-0, but {{the remainder of the}} quarter would belong to Michigan State. The Spartans would go on a 24-7 run, scoring points on all four of their second quarter possessions. While the Spartan defense did allow a 70-yard touchdown pass from Marcus Mariota to track star Devon Allen early in the quarter, they forced the Ducks to punt the ball <b>twice</b> in <b>as</b> <b>many</b> possessions, while also getting two quarterback sacks. Going into half time with the score at 24-18 and the Ducks on the ropes, the Spartans looked to be on their way to victory.|$|R
