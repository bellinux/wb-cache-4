5|$|Displays are {{classified}} as deimatic or aposematic by <b>the</b> <b>responses</b> <b>of</b> the animals that see them. Where predators are initially startled but learn to eat the displaying prey, the display is classed as deimatic, and the prey is bluffing; where they continue to avoid the prey after tasting it, the display is taken as aposematic, meaning the prey is genuinely distasteful. However, these categories are not entirely mutually exclusive. It is possible for a behaviour to be both deimatic and aposematic, if it both startles a predator and indicates the presence of anti-predator adaptations.|$|E

Chess identifies three aspects of the Slender Man mythos that tie it to folklore: collectivity (meaning that it is created by a collective, rather than a single individual), variability (meaning that the story changes depending on the teller), and performance (meaning that the storyteller's narrative changes to reflect <b>the</b> <b>responses</b> <b>of</b> his/her audience).|$|E

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>response</b> <b>of</b> liquid storage tanks subjected to ground induced lateral excitations is presented. Wall flexibility affects <b>the</b> <b>response</b> coefficients <b>of</b> tall tanks significantly. In general, response coefficients for tanks are relatively insensitive to super-structure parameters. A simplified procedure for evaluating inertial interaction effects is considered. While foundation translation dominates <b>the</b> <b>response</b> <b>of</b> broad tanks, foundation rocking {{is important for}} tall tanks. Exact values and approximate expressions reveal {{that the effects of}} interaction are a function of the relative flexibilities of the medium and super-structure. Effects of ground motion incoherence are evaluated by formal stochastic and approximate semi-deterministic approaches. Kinematic interaction reduces <b>the</b> <b>response</b> <b>of</b> tanks. <b>The</b> reductions are generally small, particularly for tall tanks. Inertial interaction effects are generally substantially larger than corresponding kinematic interaction effects.
