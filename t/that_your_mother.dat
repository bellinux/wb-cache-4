5|$|David Yarritu: I heard <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> used to {{make these}} little tin flowers and sell them to help support you in the early days.|$|E
2500|$|Then {{looking at}} him darkly Zeus who gathers the clouds spoke to him:"Do not sit beside me and whine, you {{double-faced}} liar.To me {{you are the most}} hateful of all gods who hold Olympus.Forever quarrelling is dear to your heart, wars and battles.…And yet I will not long endure to see you in pain, sinceyou are my child, and it was to me <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> bore you.But were you born of some other god and proved so ruinouslong since you would have been dropped beneath the gods of the bright sky." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{afterward}} {{you told}} us <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> was a she-ape, and that you had never known your father?" [...] she asked incredulously.|$|E
6000|$|... "Young! Is not <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother's</b> teaching? Why, {{those were}} her very words {{when she came}} to me at my house. I did not know that youth was any excuse for falsehood." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am told <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother's</b> {{name was}} Sarah Dunkirk, {{and that she}} ran away from her friends {{to go on the}} stage. Also, <b>that</b> <b>your</b> father was at one time much {{emaciated}} by illness. May I ask if you can confirm these statements?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear young lady," [...] I protested, [...] "I do {{not think}} that you must say <b>that.</b> <b>Your</b> <b>mother's</b> {{conditions}} are necessary. In fact, whether she made them or not, I think that they would be inevitable." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Boo!" [...] exclaimed the wizard, {{varying the}} {{expression}} of his contempt. [...] "It is well <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> has only a small family." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You must control yourself, Gillian,' he said gravely. 'Stop <b>that!</b> <b>Your</b> <b>mother</b> is tired, {{and has to}} dress! Don't worry her. Go, if you cannot leave off.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should like}} it, yes," [...] I answered, looking into my lover's handsome, glowing face. [...] "You are sure <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> will not mind--that she approves?" ...|$|E
6000|$|But when Strether {{presently}} spoke it wasn't in answer. [...] "It's not, I gather, <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother's</b> physically ill; her health, on the whole, this spring, {{seems to}} have been better than usual. But she's worried, she's anxious, and it appears to have risen within the last few days to a climax. We've tired out, between us, her patience." ...|$|R
5000|$|If you analyze <b>your</b> history, <b>that</b> of <b>your</b> <b>mother,</b> <b>that</b> of <b>your</b> grandmother, <b>that</b> of <b>your</b> aunts, what do {{you think}} Is it going to be the destiny of your daughters? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Too poor?' {{returned}} {{the blind man}} with a sigh. 'Ay. <b>That's</b> bad. <b>Your</b> <b>mother,</b> poor soul, would be happier if she was richer, Barnaby.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will take}} care <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> doesn't beat you. I am a doctor myself; and I {{want to see the}} lady before we get the medicine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Only <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> {{longs to}} see you.' He had been {{specially}} instigated to induce {{her to come}} as soon as possible. 'You may imagine how anxious she is.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{ought to}} think {{yourself}} lucky <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> didn't find {{you here in}} the sweet-clover patch. If it hadn't been for me she would have," [...] said Peter Rabbit.|$|E
60|$|LADY MARY (hurriedly {{thinking}} things out). I know. I--I think, George, <b>that</b> before <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> comes I {{should like}} {{to say a word}} to father.|$|R
6000|$|... "Number Four Frame! <b>That</b> was <b>your</b> <b>mother's</b> pet comb once," [...] whispered Melissa to the Princess. [...] "Many's {{the good}} egg I've watched her lay there." ...|$|R
6000|$|Isabel {{reflected}} a moment, then {{answered with a}} question of her own. [...] "Why {{do you call it}} a remarkable act? <b>That's</b> what <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> thinks too." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What!" [...] exclaimed the captain, {{unable to}} repress his surprise, [...] "son of the widow {{who owns the}} new Evening Star? then that proves <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> must be alive?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'If you'll {{think again}} you'll find that I didn't say {{anything}} of the kind. I said <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> {{said that you were}} to scoop me out of my shell,' said Slow-and-Solid.|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{have been}} many cases of this deep trance, Victor, and we must not permit the coroner to come till we are {{absolutely}} convinced <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> has gone out never to return." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Is it true {{that you}} wish to remain with Effie and Tishy? <b>That's</b> what <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> calls it when she means that you will give me up.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Margaret, you can't help {{seeing now}} <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother's</b> {{judgment}} was right. Holt Dalrymple once {{may have been}} very interesting and attractive for a friend, but as a prospective husband he was impossible. The worst I hear of {{him is that he}} drinks and gambles. I know you liked him and I don't want to be unjust. But he has kept other and better young men away from you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... '"Goddess of the Silver Bow,"' {{suggested}} Owen. 'Wasn't it <b>that</b> which <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> disapproved, Fanny, {{because it}} was worshipping idols to sing about great Diana of the Ephesians?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "For {{me it is}} nothing, Hester," [...] he answered, [...] "and I hope <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> {{will not}} worry about it. They all behaved very nicely, and we need not see much of them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{believe that}} Feurgéres was right," [...] I answered. [...] "I believe <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> {{would wish to}} see you in your {{rightful}} place. I believe that it is your duty to claim it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{am going}} to treat you like a man, {{but it is a}} sorrowful history that I have to tell you. You know <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> and Aunt Wilmet are twin sisters ?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then {{by every}} sacred power I revoke every blessing <b>that</b> since <b>your</b> birth I have poured upon your head. I recall the prayers that every night I have invoked upon your being. Great God! I cancel them. You have betrayed your cousin; you have deserted <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> and myself; you have first sullied the honour of our house, {{and now you}} have {{destroyed}} it. Why were you born? What have we done <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother's</b> womb should produce such a curse? Sins of my father, they are visited upon me! And Glastonbury, what will Glastonbury say? Glastonbury, who sacrificed his fortune for you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I presume {{the lady}} {{is not a}} {{prisoner}} in <b>your</b> <b>mother's</b> house, and <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother's</b> hospitality is not so restricted but that her guest may see an old friend under her roof." [...] This Colonel Osborne said with an assumed look of almost righteous indignation, which {{was not at all}} lost upon Bozzle. They had returned back towards the bookstall, and Bozzle, with his eyes fixed on a copy of the [...] "D. R." [...] which he had just bought, was straining his ears to the utmost to catch what was being said.|$|R
6000|$|... "Boy," [...] said Mr. Turveydrop, [...] "it is well <b>that</b> <b>your</b> sainted <b>mother</b> is spared this pang. Strike deep, {{and spare}} not. Strike home, sir, strike home!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You still suspect <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> {{knows where}} our Aurelia is?" [...] said Betty. [...] "When I {{think of her}} demeanour, I can hardly believe it! But did you hear nothing of your little sisters?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should feel}} it the {{greatest}} honour. Still my first {{duty is to}} you, and you have told me <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> wished you to keep your brother {{out of the way}} of his schoolfellow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It may be <b>that</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> wishes you away, George!" [...] Mrs. Mountain continued, wagging her head. [...] "It may be, my poor deluded boy, {{that you}} will find a {{father-in-law}} when you come back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So Mrs. Chang Lucy says," [...] Li Faa observed. [...] "She says <b>that</b> <b>your</b> honourable <b>mother</b> often {{complains}} to {{her that}} she has never made you cry." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Remember what I have heard, <b>that</b> before <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> died {{you were}} able to tell Nuflo and the priest what her wish was. Can you not, in the same way, tell me why she cried?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{speak from}} what I see. She has {{arranged}} in secret <b>that,</b> without <b>your</b> <b>mother's</b> knowledge, you should by stealth go {{to a place}} where you both know Lady Elizabeth would be shocked to hear of you.' ...|$|R
