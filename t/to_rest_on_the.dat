5|$|As {{an active}} civil airfield, {{operations}} at Duxford are {{regulated by the}} Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). In 2002 a privately operated Aero L-39 Albatros suffered a braking failure on landing, overran the runway and came <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> M11 motorway, a student pilot being killed after ejecting at ground level. An Air Accidents Investigation Branch inquiry recommended a review of arrangements for aircraft taking off or landing towards the M11. As a result, the CAA and Duxford agreed {{to a reduction in}} the runway's 1500m declared length, from 1350m to 1200m, in order to provide a greater margin of error.|$|E
5|$|The Shortest Way {{with the}} Dissenters; or, Proposals for the Establishment of the Church is a {{pamphlet}} consisting of twenty-nine pages. It opens with the fable of the Cock and the Horses. The Cock, lacking any perch in the stable, is forced <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground and {{in fear of}} the Horses moving around and stepping on him, advises: “Pray, Gentlefolks! let us stand still! for fear we should tread upon one another!” The speaker then applies this to the contemporary situation, with the Cock representing the Dissenters.|$|E
5|$|In 1889 Waterloo Station (renamed from Waterloo Bridge {{station in}} 1886) was {{equipped}} with new signals, which required a gantry spanning all the lines into the station. In return for the LSWR cladding the LNC's entrance on Westminster Bridge Road with white glazed brick, the LNC gave consent for the stanchion supporting the gantry <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> LNC's platform, while reserving the right to demand the gantry be removed. At this time the LSWR also leased a small plot of land west of the Westminster Bridge Road entrance {{to serve as the}} site of new offices for the LNC, designed by Cyril Bazett Tubbs.|$|E

50|$|The {{shells of}} Armenoceras are {{straight}} and medium to large in size with a circular to subcircular cross section. The siphuncle is large, located subcentrally <b>to</b> <b>resting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ventral margin. Segments are wider than long, broadly expanded into the camerae. Septal necks short with wide brings {{that may be}} in contact with posterior surface of septa. In most the canal system within the siphuncle in is of the double arc type. Cameral deposits are rare.|$|R

5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of January 4, the KPA I Corps, the PVA 38th Corps and the PVA 50th Corps entered Seoul, but they were only greeted by an empty city in flames. Most of the civilians had either fled south through the frozen Han River or evacuated to the nearby countryside. The South Korean government in Seoul, which was reduced to essential personnel before the battle, also left the city with little difficulties. A Chinese platoon reached the Seoul City Hall at about 13:00 and raised the North Korean flag. On January 5, Peng ordered the PVA 50th Corps and the KPA I Corps to seize Gimpo and Incheon while instructing all other units <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> northern bank of the Han River. By January 7, Peng halted the Third Phase Campaign due to troop exhaustion and to prevent {{a repeat of the}} Incheon landing.|$|E
5|$|Rajab {{was one of}} {{the founders}} of the first migrant workers {{protection}} committee in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, the Migrant Workers Protection Group (in 2003). On 28 April 2007, the Bahraini Parliament passed a law banning unmarried migrant workers from living in residential areas. BCHR issued a press release condemning this decision as discriminatory and promoting negative racist attitudes towards migrant workers. Rajab, then BCHR vice president, said: It is appalling that Bahrain is willing <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> benefits of these people’s hard work, and often their suffering, but that they refuse to live with them in equality and dignity. The solution is not to force migrant workers into ghettos, but to urge companies to improve living conditions for workers – and not to accommodate large numbers of workers in inadequate space, and to improve the standard of living for them.|$|E
5|$|This {{efficient}} long-distance travelling {{underlies the}} albatross's {{success as a}} long-distance forager, covering great distances and expending little energy looking for patchily distributed food sources. Their adaptation to gliding flight makes them dependent on wind and waves, however, as their long wings are ill-suited to powered flight and most species lack the muscles and energy to undertake sustained flapping flight. Albatrosses in calm seas are forced <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ocean's surface until the wind picks up again. The North Pacific albatrosses can use a flight style known as flap-gliding, where the bird progresses by bursts of flapping followed by gliding. When taking off, albatrosses {{need to take a}} run up to allow enough air to move under the wing to provide lift.|$|E

25|$|On 27 November 1984, a Beechcraft Baron 58, {{registration}} VH-ETV, {{operating a}} charter {{flight to the}} airport, suffered a left landing gear failure and was substantially damaged.

25|$|When Flight 420 {{was near}} the runway threshold, the {{severely}} damaged left wing failed. The aircraft then rotated 90 degrees to the left: fuel spilled from the aircraft and ignited. The aircraft spiralled and crashed, coming <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left side of Runway 24L. All 2 crew members and 9 passengers on board were killed. 2 passengers initially survived the crash, but ultimately died of their injuries.|$|E

25|$|On January 12, 1992, Graham Sellers, {{the pilot}} and only {{occupant}} of a Piper Twin Comanche two-engine four-seater plane, died when both engines failed on his final approach to land at the airport. Sellars was test flying the aircraft after it had been serviced for engine problems. His plane clipped the treetops, crashed through the airport's perimeter chain link fence and came <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grass next to Runway 33.|$|E
25|$|During World War II, Normandie {{was seized}} by U.S. {{authorities}} at New York and renamed USS Lafayette. In 1942, the liner caught fire while being converted to a troopship, capsized onto her port side and came <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mud of the Hudson River at Pier 88, {{the site of the}} current New York Passenger Ship Terminal. Although salvaged at great expense, restoration was deemed too costly and she was scrapped in October 1946.|$|E

25|$|On 9 November 2012, BFL509, a Curtiss C-46A (C-GTXW), {{landed at}} Yellowknife Airport {{and when it}} rolled to the runway 16/34 intersection, the left main landing gear collapsed. The {{aircraft}} then came <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left wing and suffered substantial damage. The aircraft was repaired and returned to service. The cause of the accident was that a hammer, lodged between the inboard drag strut and sliding member, caused the landing gear to collapse.|$|E
25|$|During {{the impact}} and short ground roll, the nose gear collapsed, the right main gear {{separated}} from the aircraft, penetrating the central fuel tank and cabin space, and the left main gear was pushed up through the wing. The aircraft came <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> threshold markings {{at the start of}} the runway. A significant amount of fuel leaked, but there was no fire. Four crew members and eight passengers received minor injuries, and one passenger received serious injuries (concussion and a broken leg).|$|E
25|$|Another early {{technique}} involved {{complete removal}} of brush and woody vegetation from an area. Tsetse tend <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{trunks of trees}} so removing woody vegetation made the area inhospitable to the flies. However, the technique was not widely used and has been abandoned. Preventing regrowth of woody vegetation requires continuous clearing efforts, which is only practical where large human populations are present. The clearing of woody vegetation {{has come to be}} seen as an environmental problem more than a benefit.|$|E
