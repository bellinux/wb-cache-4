5|$|I-80 {{follows the}} routes {{of two major}} auto trails through the state. In western Utah, I-80 follows the {{historical}} route of the Victory Highway from Wendover at the Nevada state line to the junction of US-40 near Park City. Throughout Utah, I-80 is signed as the modern route of <b>the</b> <b>Lincoln</b> Highwayexcept through Salt Lake City, where <b>the</b> <b>Lincoln</b> Highway is routed along State Route 201 and Parley's Way. The route of <b>the</b> <b>Lincoln</b> Highway across Utah was generally derived from {{the route of the}} Pony Express and the Central Overland Route. However, much of the original route of <b>the</b> <b>Lincoln</b> Highway west of Salt Lake City is inaccessible. The original route of <b>the</b> <b>Lincoln</b> Highway proceeded southwest from Tooele towards Ely, Nevada. This area is now used for military bases, such as the Dugway Proving Ground and Tooele Army Depot. The area was closed to the public when these bases were established. I-80 and US-93 are the modern signing of <b>the</b> <b>Lincoln</b> Highway between those two cities. East of Salt Lake City, I-80 closely parallels the original route of <b>the</b> <b>Lincoln</b> Highway.|$|E

In 1927, <b>the</b> <b>Lincoln</b> Highway was renumbered as Route 27 between Trenton and Newark. U.S. Route 1 was designated on this portion of the road until it was relocated by the 1940s. U.S. Route 206 followed the route from Trenton to Princeton until 1953, when the southern terminus of Route 27 was cut back to Princeton to avoid the concurrency with U.S. Route 206.|$|E
