5|$|A feature {{coming into}} wide use in modern shortwave {{receivers}} is DSP technology, short for digital signal processing. DSP {{is the use}} of digital means to process signals, and a primary benefit in shortwave receivers is the ability to tailor the bandwidth of the receiver to current reception conditions and <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> signal being listened to. A typical analog-only receiver may have a limited number of fixed bandwidths, or only one, but a DSP receiver may have 40 or more individually selectable filters.|$|E
5|$|During the investigation, {{unsuccessful}} {{attempts were}} made to match a knife taken from Beauchamp upon his arrest <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> wound observed on Sharp's body. Efforts to match a footprint found near Sharp's house to Beauchamp were similarly unsuccessful. The posse that arrested Beauchamp had taken a bloody handkerchief from the crime scene, but had lost it on the trip back to Frankfort after the arrest. The best evidence presented by the prosecution was the testimony of Sharp's wife Eliza that she heard the killer's voice and that it was distinctly high-pitched. When given the opportunity to hear Beauchamp's voice, she identified it as that of the killer.|$|E

5|$|Even {{among other}} festive music written by Bach, this work's scoring for four {{trumpets}} is unusual. It is characterised {{by a very}} solemn character and the attributes of courtly homage music, such as the opening chorus {{in the form of}} a French overture or fanfare-like trumpet interjections in the bass recitative. Bach created a work that in musical terms corresponds less to sacred music and more <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> secular music for a princely court, as had been required of him during his time in office in Köthen. Only in its final two movements does Bach again use simple forms to emphasize the work's character of a church cantata, implying that earthly powers do not last, but God – the supreme ruler – is entitled to have the last word.|$|E
5|$|Modern animal {{husbandry}} relies on production systems adapted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> land available. Subsistence farming is being superseded by intensive animal farming {{in the more}} developed parts of the world, where for example beef cattle are kept in high density feedlots, and thousands of chickens may be raised in broiler houses or batteries. On poorer soil such as in uplands, animals are often kept more extensively, and may be allowed to roam widely, foraging for themselves. Most livestock are herbivores, except for the pig which is an omnivore. Ruminants like cattle and sheep are adapted to feed on grass; they can forage outdoors, or may be fed entirely or in part on rations richer in energy and protein, such as pelleted cereals. Pigs and poultry cannot digest the cellulose in forage, and require cereals and other high-energy foods.|$|E
5|$|Polymerases are {{enzymes that}} {{synthesize}} polynucleotide chains from nucleoside triphosphates. The sequence {{of their products}} is created based on existing polynucleotide chains—which are called templates. These enzymes function by repeatedly adding a nucleotide to the 3′ hydroxyl group {{at the end of}} the growing polynucleotide chain. As a consequence, all polymerases work in a 5′ to 3′ direction. In the active site of these enzymes, the incoming nucleoside triphosphate base-pairs to the template: this allows polymerases to accurately synthesize the complementary strand of their template. Polymerases are classified according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> template that they use.|$|E

5|$|Session Attacks are {{combination}} {{attacks that}} can be triggered by targeting an enemy's weakness. If another party member possesses a Session Skill linking <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> attack used, they will automatically perform a pursuit attack, which may then trigger another attack and so on. For example, if one party member attacks with an ice attack, another party member with an Ice-Elec skill will follow up with an electrical attack. Session Attacks may also {{be carried out by}} the enemy if they target a party member's weakness. By building up a special meter through attacks, players can earn SP which can be used to trigger Performance attacks, which can be earned through Unity and by completing side-stories. These are called Duo Attacks which are performed by a partner's Mirage. Dual Attacks, on the other hand, can be triggered during a Session Attack to extend the combo at random times. Additionally, party members can learn Ad-lib Performances which may randomly activate while performing certain skills.|$|E
5|$|The {{algorithms}} {{are classified}} according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> input they require. Sequence-based algorithms require only {{the sequence of}} two proteins {{in order to create}} an alignment. Sequence methods are generally fast and suitable for searching whole genomes for circularly permuted pairs of proteins. Structure-based methods require 3D structures of both proteins being considered. They are often slower than sequence-based methods, but are able to detect circular permutations between distantly related proteins with low sequence similarity. Some structural methods are topology independent, meaning that they are also able to detect more complex rearrangements than circular permutation.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} uses for enzyme inhibitors are as drugs to treat disease. Many of these inhibitors target a human enzyme and aim {{to correct a}} {{pathological}} condition. However, not all drugs are enzyme inhibitors. Some, such as anti-epileptic drugs, alter enzyme activity by causing more or less of the enzyme to be produced. These effects are called enzyme induction and inhibition and are alterations in gene expression, which is unrelated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> enzyme inhibition discussed here. Other drugs interact with cellular targets that are not enzymes, such as ion channels or membrane receptors.|$|E

5|$|Cells {{are known}} to {{eliminate}} three types of damage to their DNA by chemically reversing it. These mechanisms do not require a template, since the types of damage they counteract can occur in {{only one of the}} four bases. Such direct reversal mechanisms are specific <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> damage incurred and do not involve breakage of the phosphodiester backbone. The formation of pyrimidine dimers upon irradiation with UV light results in an abnormal covalent bond between adjacent pyrimidine bases. The photoreactivation process directly reverses this damage by the action of the enzyme photolyase, whose activation is obligately dependent on energy absorbed from blue/UV light (300–500nm wavelength) to promote catalysis. Photolyase, an old enzyme present in bacteria, fungi, and most animals no longer functions in humans, who instead use nucleotide excision repair to repair damage from UV irradiation. Another type of damage, methylation of guanine bases, is directly reversed by the protein methyl guanine methyl transferase (MGMT), the bacterial equivalent of which is called ogt. This is an expensive process because each MGMT molecule can be used only once; that is, the reaction is stoichiometric rather than catalytic. A generalized response to methylating agents in bacteria is known as the adaptive response and confers a level of resistance to alkylating agents upon sustained exposure by upregulation of alkylation repair enzymes. The third type of DNA damage reversed by cells is certain methylation of the bases cytosine and adenine.|$|E
5|$|In the west, the 26th Infantry Brigade {{had begun}} patrolling {{operations}} north of Sattelberg on 27 November, moving towards the Song River. The distance to Wareo was , but due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> terrain, the actual distance to be traversed was about quadruple that. The 2/23rd Infantry Battalion {{was given the}} task of leading the Australian advance in this sector and after striking north from Masangkoo, they moved towards Fior, with the task for finding a river crossing for the brigade. No crossing could be found. At {{the same time the}} 2/24th set out from Palanko in search of jungle tracks towards the river. Flank protection on the left was provided by the 2/4th Commando Squadron and a platoon from the Papuan Infantry Battalion. The search was unsuccessful and after minor clashes occurred, the Australians dispatched two platoons to Fior in an effort to link up with the 2/23rd. Short of Fior, the Japanese had established themselves in strength in well dug-in positions amidst a thick bamboo grove. As the 2/24th's platoons approached, they were fired upon and forced to halt their advance, establishing a night defensive position.|$|E
5|$|Preliminary {{examination}} of the bullet can exclude {{a large number of}} weapons by examining the general characteristics of a recovered bullet. By determining general aspects of the fired ammunition, a number of weapons can be immediately excluded as being incapable of firing that type of bullet. The make and model of the weapon can also be inferred from the combination of different class characteristics that are common to specific manufactures. The three main class characteristics of all bullets are the lands and grooves, the caliber of the bullet, and the rifling twist. All three can be tied directly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> barrel that was used to fire the bullet. The lands and grooves of barrel are the bumps and valleys created when the rifling is created. The caliber is the diameter of the barrel. The twist is the direction of the striations left by the barrel's rifling, clockwise (right-handed) or counterclockwise (left-handed). Most barrels will have a right-handed twist with the exception of weapons created by the Colt's Manufacturing Company which uses left-handed twists. Weapon barrels that match the class characteristics of recovered bullets can be examined further for individual characteristics to determine if the bullet came from that particular weapon.|$|E
