Zhang Renliang, the top official of Jing'an District, said that Shanghai residents and foreign workers would be compensated equally.

30|$|It {{should be}} noted that <b>the</b> negative-sequence <b>compensation</b> {{mentioned}} here is referred to as <b>the</b> symmetrical <b>compensation</b> in a broad sense.

The results were as follows; as a result of analyzing <b>the</b> body <b>compensation</b> image according to changes in the shoulder height and width of power shoulder raglan sleeve jacket, five factors were selected; <b>the</b> shoulder <b>compensation</b> factor, <b>the</b> bust <b>compensation</b> factor, <b>the</b> waist <b>compensation</b> factor, <b>the</b> arm <b>compensation</b> factor and <b>the</b> neck <b>compensation</b> factor.

5|$|Johnson {{believed}} that Congressional business was too slow and tedious, {{and that the}} per diem system of compensation encouraged delays {{on the part of}} members.

(At the time, this had the effect of increasing the total compensation from about $900 to $1500. Johnson noted that congressmen had not had a pay increase in 27 years, and that $1500 was less than the salaries of the 28 clerks employed by the government.) Johnson's bill provided that if a congressman was absent, his salary would be reduced proportionally.|$|E
