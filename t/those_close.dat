5|$|On 31 January 1952, despite {{advice from}} <b>those</b> <b>close</b> to him, the King went to London Airport to see off Princess Elizabeth, {{who was going}} on her tour of Australia via Kenya.

5|$|Tyndall also {{engaged in}} Holocaust denial, {{declaring that the}} Holocaust was a hoax created by Jews to gain sympathy for {{themselves}} and thus aid their plot for world domination.

The close quarters and massive troop movements of World War I hastened the pandemic, and probably both increased transmission and augmented mutation; the war may also have increased the lethality of the virus. Some speculate the soldiers' immune systems were weakened by malnourishment, as well as the stresses of combat and chemical attacks, increasing their susceptibility.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{its large}} size, the overall {{appearance}} of Deinosuchus was not considerably {{different from that}} of modern crocodilians. Deinosuchus had an alligator-like, broad snout, with a slightly bulbous tip. Each premaxilla contained four teeth, with the pair nearest to the tip of the snout being significantly smaller than the other two. Each maxilla (the main tooth-bearing bone in the upper jaw) contained 21 or 22teeth. The tooth count for each dentary (tooth-bearing bone in the lower jaw) was at least 22. All the teeth were very thick and robust; <b>those</b> <b>close</b> {{to the rear of the}} jaws were short, rounded, and blunt. They appear to have been adapted for crushing, rather than piercing. When the mouth was closed, only the fourth tooth of the lower jaw would have been visible.|$|E
5|$|Rix Nicholas {{continued}} to experience success in her exhibitions and with regular favourable reviews in the press, such {{as for her}} show in the Queen Victoria Markets in September 1920. Nevertheless, Pigot has argued that {{her place in the}} Australian art world at the time was complex, and her style was affected by vigorous debate around the emergence of modernism, which was being resisted by local critics. Her experience of this more conservative Australia, and the effects of the deaths of all <b>those</b> <b>close</b> to her, contributed to Rix Nicholas abandoning her more experimental art, and returning to more academic and figurative subjects. This ultimately had a detrimental effect on the long-term trajectory of her career. Pigot also argues that her refusal to conform to the gendered expectations of the Australian artistic establishment led to her rejection.|$|E

Seymour and Sir Anthony Browne, the Master of the Horse, rode to collect Edward from Hertford and brought him to Enfield, where Lady Elizabeth was living. He and Elizabeth were then told of the death of their father and heard a reading of the will.|$|E
5|$|With {{the paparazzi}} taking {{photographs}} of her wherever they could, Winehouse obtained an injunction against a leading paparazzi agency, Big Pictures, under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997; the resultant court order {{issued by the}} High Court in 2009 banned them from following her. Photographers were also banned from following her within 100 metres of her London home and photographing Winehouse in her home or the homes of her friends and relatives.

5|$|Clark Kent first {{appears in}} the pilot episode of Smallville as a teen with superhuman {{abilities}} that he uses to help others. Clark is adopted by Jonathan and Martha Kent (John Schneider and Annette O'Toole) as an infant, when he crash lands on Earth {{on the day of}} the Smallville meteor shower in 1989. Twelve years later, trying to find his place in life after being told he is an alien by his adoptive father, Clark saves the life of Lex Luthor (Michael Rosenbaum), the son of billionaire Lionel Luthor (John Glover), and the pair become quick friends. During season one, Clark struggles with the burden of keeping his powers a secret from <b>those</b> <b>close</b> to him. In particular, he is afraid to open up to Lana Lang (Kristin Kreuk) for fear that she would not accept him if she learned of his supernatural abilities.|$|E

5|$|Kirchner soon distanced {{himself from}} Duhalde, {{removing}} <b>those</b> <b>close</b> to the former president from the government to reduce his political influence. He also sought supporters across {{the social and political}} spectrum to counter Duhalde's influence in the party. Although Duhalde was not initially against Kirchner, Kirchner tried to prevent the presence of alternative leaderships within the PJ. However, they put their differences behind them during the October 2003 legislative elections. Their dispute was fanned by the political weight of Buenos Aires province (the most populous in Argentina, with almost 40 percent of the national vote), and continued through the 2005 midterm elections. Without consensus in the PJ for a candidate for senator in the Buenos Aires province, both leaders had their wives run for office: Hilda González de Duhalde for the PJ and Cristina Fernández de Kirchner for the Front for Victory, which contested the election as a different party. Cristina Kirchner won the election. As in 2003, the elections were defined by Peronist factions; the opposition parties could not put up a united national front. The victory gave Kirchner the confidence to remove Lavagna, Rafael Bielsa, Jose Pampuro, and Alicia Kirchner from his cabinet and replace them with ministers who, though less well-known, had perspectives closer to his own.|$|E
5|$|Over time, Jackson's facial {{structure}} {{changed as}} well. Surgeons speculated {{he also had}} a rhinoplasty, a forehead lift, cheekbone surgery, altered his lips, and had a cleft put in his chin. <b>Those</b> <b>close</b> to the singer estimated that, by 1990, he had undergone around ten procedures. According to Taraborrelli, Jackson had his first rhinoplasty after breaking his nose during a complex dance routine in 1979. However, the surgery was not a complete success, and he complained of breathing difficulties that would affect his career. He was referred to Steven Hoefflin, who performed his second rhinoplasty in 1981. Katherine Jackson, though, has {{said in a recent interview}} that Michael intentionally got his first nosejob from Steven Hoefflin. Taraborrelli stated Jackson had a third rhinoplasty three years later and a fourth in 1986. Jackson wrote in his 1988 autobiography Moonwalk that, in addition to the two rhinoplasties, {{he also had a}} dimple created in his chin. From 1986 onward he was a regular client of Arnold Klein, a dermatologist who specializes in dermal filler injection, a non-surgical cosmetic procedure.|$|E
