50|$|After {{the death}} of the Tiferes Yosef, his {{followers}} appointed his only son, Rabbi Shmuel Shlomo Leiner, as Radzyner Rebbe. At first, the Rebbe refused to take over his father's position. Only due to the enormous pressure put on him by the thousands of Radziner Chassidim, did he finally consent. The final push was the pressure put on him by his great-uncle, Rav Mottel Leiner, son of the Beis Yaakov, and Rav Michel Rashes of Brisk, {{one of the most prominent}} Radziner Chassidim. The Rebbe led his followers with a very sharp and extreme leadership, similar to that of his grandfather, the Orchos Chaim. This caused many chassidim <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> Radzin. The Rebbe went as far as to close various shteiblach, which he believed were not appropriate of being called Radziner Shtieblech. His greatest strength of character was brought to light during the years of the holocaust. The Rebbe was known for encouraging resistance to the orders of the Nazis and the Judenrat, and for urging people to break out of the ghettos, flee to the forests and take up arms. The Nazis searched for him greatly, and he was eventually shot to death on 29 Iyar 5702 (1942). He was buried in Wladawa.|$|R
