40|$|The {{study shows}} an {{alternative}} solution to existing efforts at {{solving the problem}} of how to centrally manage and synchronise users’ Multiple Profiles (MP) across multiple discrete social networks. Most social network users hold more than one social network account and utilise them in different ways depending on the digital context (Iannella, 2009 a). They may, for example, enjoy friendly chat on Facebook 1, professional discussion on LinkedIn 2, and health information exchange on PatientsLikeMe 3 In this thesis the researcher proposes a framework for the management of a user’s multiple online social network profiles. A demonstrator, called Multiple Profile Manager (MPM), will be showcased to illustrate how effective the framework will be. The MPM will achieve the required profile management and synchronisation using a free, open, decentralized social networking platform (OSW) that was proposed by the Vodafone Group in 2010. The proposed MPM will enable a user to create and manage an integrated profile (IP) and share/synchronise this profile with all their social networks. The necessary protocols to support the prototype are also proposed by the researcher. The MPM protocol specification defines an Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) extension for sharing vCard and social network accounts information between the MPM Server, MPM Client, and social network sites (SNSs).. Therefore many web users need to manage disparate profiles across many distributed online sources. Maintaining these profiles is cumbersome, time-consuming, inefficient, and may lead to lost opportunity. The writer of this thesis adopted a research approach and a number of use cases for the implementation of the project. <b>The</b> <b>use</b> <b>cases</b> <b>were</b> created to capture the functional requirements of the MPM and to describe the interactions between users and the MPM. In the research a development process was followed in establishing the prototype and related protocols. <b>The</b> <b>use</b> <b>cases</b> <b>were</b> subsequently used to illustrate the prototype via the screenshots taken of the MPM client interfaces. The use cases also played a role in evaluating the outcomes of the research such as the framework, prototype, and the related protocols. An innovative application of this project is in the area of public health informatics. The researcher utilised the prototype to examine how the framework might benefit patients and physicians. The framework can greatly enhance health information management for patients and more importantly offer a more comprehensive personal health overview of patients to physicians. This will give a more complete picture of the patient’s background than is currently available and will prove helpful in providing the right treatment. The MPM prototype and related protocols have a high application value as they can be integrated into the real OSW platform and so serve users in the modern digital world. They also provide online users with a real platform for centrally storing their complete profile data, efficiently managing their personal information, and moreover, synchronising the overall complete profile with each of their discrete profiles stored in their different social network sites...|$|E
40|$|A {{case study}} was {{undertaken}} {{to examine and}} apply the UML use-case notation version 1. 3. This study shows that the notation is open to interpretation and the semantics of the use-case relationships are confusing. The attempt to bolt on the object-oriented inheritance structure to the use-case notation is shown to cause problems with users. Generalisation tries to give use cases an object-oriented feel {{despite the fact that}} use cases are fundamentally orthogonal to object-orientation [1]. The case study undertaken involved students developing a use-case diagram and descriptions for a proposed application. We describe a general explanation of the findings. The first finding is that there are risks in making use cases too generic. For example, in this study two of <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>cases</b> <b>were</b> combined into one by many of the students. This unification makes some sense, as the two functions appear to be the same except for what appeared to be small details. However, the requirements are very different: one is to request new equipment; the other is to move existing equipment to another room or computer. One could argue that the overall requirement would be to install equipment (hardware and/or software) but the effects on the problem domain would be different. The second finding was a concern that arose over the communication association lines. That is, how does one show a passive actor receiving some information? For example, a use case "Reply to Requests " show...|$|E

30|$|The {{pathways}} {{generated by}} the model, and the visualization that makes them accessible, will enable law enforcement {{to take full advantage}} of the interconnected elements of identity in our modern world. From the beginning, the SuperIdentity project has used a user-centric design approach. An early activity in the SuperIdentity project was the collection of use cases (Developing the use cases Section) to explore how various law enforcement roles could interact with the model. The aim of this activity was twofold. The initial aim was to understand how various types of end users undertook the task of identifying individuals, including the data used, the initial evidence that was usually available, the desired outcome of the identification, and the amount of uncertainty that could be tolerated. Secondly, the information obtained in these use cases helped to guide the development of the model for identity and the visualization to support those same end users. <b>The</b> <b>use</b> <b>cases</b> <b>were</b> collected through interviews with law enforcement personnel and illustrate difference scenarios in identifying individuals or in enriching the identification of an individual. These use cases helped researchers understand how law enforcement personnel go about doing identification tasks and problems and constraints in this work. Exemplar use cases were developed from current use cases and illustrate how new types of identity traits could facilitate identification tasks. The application has been developed using exemplar use cases that have helped identify useful visualization techniques. A user-centered evaluation is also planned for later in the year and will be discussed in the Future Work section.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Today, {{computer}} aided {{assessment of}} ultrasound video sequences {{is considered the}} gold standard. Ultrasound analysis forms {{an integral part of}} the medical research studies performed at the DLR. Currently, two studies are being performed that obtain ultrasound measurements of vascular structures. In this project, a software is developed that supports these and future studies in providing a framework for ultrasound analysis. Furthermore a method for obtaining assessment of diameter measurements from vascular structures in ultrasound video material is provided. Following the problem analysis based on scenarios and tasks <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>cases</b> <b>were</b> constructed and used for an system design. A virtual window was derived from the requirements specification—use cases. After consulting the customer with the virtual window, it was later realized by implementing the GUI. The developed software is clearly structured and focuses on extensibility. To be able to achieve this goal, the softwares main components clearly separated by integrating the model view controller pattern into the software’s architecture. The facade pattern is utilized to provide easy access to the frameworks interface models and hides the complexity. In the approach of developing the image processing, the image material was examined in depth and characteristics defined. The approach for determining the edges on the vessel walls for diameter measurement is to differentiate the image with a first order derivate of a Gaussian filter. The edges are then detected by analyzing the differentiated image. Diameter measurement between the edges follows certain assumptions that have been made. The diameter measurement algorithm was later evaluated. The evaluation of the diameter measurement algorithm showed that there is considerable variability between the gold standard of manual measurement and the software results. Furthermore, it was shown that the video quality and the definition of the region of interest have an impact on measurement accuracy. Concluding the software developed here delivers a framework for ultrasound image analysis and enables the further refinement of the measurement algorithm and flexible implementation into future ultrasound applications...|$|E
40|$|This CASSANDRA LL 2 final {{deliverable}} {{contains all}} {{information regarding the}} CASSANDRA Living Lab Europe – USA via Bremerhaven including information from two intermediate reports (CASSANDRA D 4. 21 and D 4. 22) about the very same Living Lab handed in during runtime of the Living Lab. CASSANDRA Living Lab 2 shows in a practical way how to improve security and visibility of transatlantic supply chains embedded in the overall CASSANDRA ideas and structure. The enhanced security concepts combine technological, organisational and operational measures also in line with governmental supply chain security programmes such as AEO or C-TPAT. Mechanical and electronic devices such as HS-Seals, e-Seals or advanced monitoring systems {{can be used to}} physically secure container transport whereas associated data may use digital watermarks to verify information sources or encryption methods as protection against manipulation. The aim of CASSANDRA is to demonstrate methods for enhancing supply chain security beyond state-of-the-art by integrating existing data management systems to create a Data Pipeline and introduce a Risk-Based Approach across entire logistics chains and is totally inline with the proposed Multilayer Approach. These types of approach have also been advocated in government publications {{from the beginning of the}} project such as the Joint Statement on supply-chain security (EU and US, July 2011) and National Strategy for Global Supply Chain Security (US, Jan. 2012). In General the Living Lab was organized and executed during the runtime of the CASSANDRA project. This living lab is centered around the 6 Use Cases, each representing specific obstacles stakeholders face at daily work. This is derived from the high-tech environment US transports are embedded and the used levels of abstraction to pinpoint single problems. The used process for the successful LL 2 can be summarized as follows: The LL started with discussions among the partners to get a common understanding about the objectives and steps to be taken. This was mainly done in the CASSSANDRA WP 3. The first part was to create a white paper to inform parties not involved in the consortium about the project in general and this living lab in particular. These parties (EU and US Authorities, Shippers) were informed, involved and Use Cases showing the current obstacles in US trades created. <b>The</b> <b>Use</b> <b>Cases</b> <b>were</b> then used as the content for demonstration, discussion and evaluation of the LL. All this information was passed to LL 2 partners responsible for creating demonstration systems such as the business and the customs dashboard, not as the goal in itself but as a system of systems needed for discussion and evaluation of general CASSANDRA ideas in an environment which is dominated by technical solutions as a proof of security to fight attacks to countries as a whole. These discussions were done when the visualisation systems were in a final stage late in the project. During runtime 3 reports were created, which were the MS 4 report and two LL 2 intermediate reports. These two are not part of the initial DoW but were seen to be useful for reporting purposes due to postponement of this report by DoW amendment. The consortium partners in LL 2 are the two freight forwarders Kühne + Nagel from Vienna, Austria (K+N) and Deutsche Handels-Logistik (DHL) from Bonn, Germany. Data is collected in the CASSANDRA backbone hub, processed and visualised in a Business Dashboard by The Descartes Systems Group Inc. (Descartes) from Lier, Belgium. The relevant Port Community System for all Ports in Bremen and Bremerhaven in charge (Bremer Hafentelematik (BHT)) is run by the Datenbank Bremische Häfen (dbh) located in Bremen, Germany. Additional visualization of Customs Data is provided by IBM, NL and Intrasoft, GR.
