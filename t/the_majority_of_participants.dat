5|$|Sociological {{investigation}} {{indicates that}} certain {{sectors of society}} {{are more likely to}} engage in New Age practices than others. <b>The</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>participants</b> are from the middle and upper-middle classes of Western society. Sutcliffe noted that although most influential New Age figureheads were male, approximately two-thirds of its participants were female.|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{very few}} people in Wales had seen an opera, {{and they had no}} idea what it was like. The opera {{programmes}} provided explanations, especially that the singers would wear costumes but would not be acting. Those who were members of Welsh nonconformist churches needed reassurance {{that this was not a}} theatrical performance, as acting and theatres were held in as much contempt as taverns. Parry was raised in the nonconformist Annibynwyr Chapel and adhered to the tenets of his faith for his entire life. <b>The</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>participants</b> in the first performance of Blodwen were music students of Parry; his two older sons were also part of the production, playing piano and harmonium. Before the performance, Parry spoke to the audience. He repeated what had been printed in the programmes: that the participants were not acting and explained to those gathered what an opera was. Despite this, there were some clergymen who were not pleased.|$|E
25|$|The King's South Africa Medal {{was awarded}} {{only to those}} troops who fought in 1902, and who had served for 18 months. Even with {{continuous}} service, the recipient {{would have had to}} have served from 1 December 1900 to have 18 months service before the war ended on 31 May 1902. Service therefore had to have commenced before the death of Queen Victoria on 22 January 1901 and, as a result, <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>participants</b> qualified for the award of the Queen's South Africa Medal only.|$|E

25|$|In {{spite of}} their many functions, WUB have in many cases limited {{capacity}}. PSI carried out a study of their capacity during the first phase, in the coast, where {{the state of the}} art irrigation practices are found. The study established that only 65% of them have acceptable water management. As a result, PSI held training and capacity building programs and found that <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>participants</b> were male. However, women do most of the agriculture work in rural areas as a result of male migration to the cities. Nevertheless, their representation in WUB is limited. Furthermore, in the board, most times they hold non relevant positions or their presence is nominal.|$|E
25|$|Whether people {{naturally}} {{adhere to}} an incompatibilist model {{of free will}} has been questioned in the research. Eddy Nahmias has found that incompatibilism is not intuitive – it was not adhered to, in that determinism does not negate belief in moral responsibility (based on an empirical study of people's responses to moral dilemmas under a deterministic model of reality). Edward Cokely has found that incompatibilism is intuitive – it was naturally adhered to, in that determinism does indeed negate belief in moral responsibility in general. Joshua Knobe and Shaun Nichols have proposed that incompatibilism {{may or may not}} be intuitive, and that it is dependent to some large degree upon the circumstances; whether or not the crime incites an emotional response – for example if it involves harming another human being. They found that belief in free will is a cultural universal, and that <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>participants</b> said that (a) our universe is indeterministic and (b) moral responsibility is not compatible with determinism.|$|E

2500|$|During summer 2003 {{a survey}} {{commissioned}} by Peter Strieder, Berlin's Senator for City Development and Traffic, and Deutsche Bahn director Hartmut Mehdorn was conducted among Berlin residents {{with the intention}} of selecting a name for the station. Of the three possibilities listed on the survey, <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>participants</b> opted for Lehrter Bahnhof; nevertheless, the station remained [...] "Berlin Hauptbahnhof – Lehrter Bahnhof", an option that was not listed. It was decided early in 2005 that the station would be renamed [...] "Berlin Hauptbahnhof" [...] on the date of its opening, 28 May 2006, to avoid confusing rail passengers. On the same day, Berlin Papestraße station, which was rebuilt as the city's second-largest station, opened officially under its new name, Berlin Südkreuz (South Cross), similar to the existing Ostkreuz and Westkreuz stations. It is also on the new north-south route. Although it was intended to open a further station as Berlin-Nordkreuz (North Cross), the name Berlin-Gesundbrunnen was retained for what became Berlin's fourth biggest railway station for commuter and long distance trains, located in a more northern part of Berlin, where the circle and north-south-line of the S-Bahn cross each other.|$|E

40|$|The study aims {{to explore}} the views of pre-service {{teachers}} {{about the use of}} open-ended items in largescale assessment in Turkey, through a phenomenological approach.

The research group of the study consists of 96 pre-service teachers at Ankara University, Turkey. As a result of the study, the most notable positive theme is that advanced mental skills can be better measured through the use of open-ended items. However, <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>participant</b> pre-service teachers had negative views about the use of open-ended questions in largescale assessment.
