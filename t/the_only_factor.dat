5|$|Despite the storm's {{intensification}} and well-organized satellite appearance, {{the circulation}} failed {{to become better}} defined. In their first discussion on Iris, the NHC mentioned {{the potential for the}} system to degenerate into a tropical wave if it maintained its fast forward speed. One forecaster noted that the center was fragile and that the cyclone could dissipate quickly if it encountered stronger wind shear to its south. Although its overall appearance did not change significantly, the Hurricane Hunters reported a closed eye with a diameter 23mi (37km) and a stadium effect (eyewall curvature) on October6. Later that day, Iris reached hurricane strength just southwest of the southern tip of the Dominican Republic, and the NHC remarked that land interaction with the Greater Antilles was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>factor</b> impeding further development. After Iris reached winds of 85mph (140km/h) early on October7, its intensity remained steady for about 24hours. During that time, the satellite appearance became slightly ragged as its outflow became restricted, possibly due to an upper-level low. By late on October7, the area of hurricaneforce winds associated with Iris extended only 25mi (35km) from its 16mi (22km) wide eye.|$|E

5|$|In 2001, twenty-one {{northwest}} Washington tribes, {{joined by}} the United States filed a Request for Determination in U.S. District Court, asking the court {{to find that the}} State of Washington has a treaty-based duty to preserve fish runs and habitat sufficiently for the tribes to earn a “moderate living,” and sought to compel the state to repair or replace culverts that impede salmon migration. On August 22, 2007, the district court issued a summary judgment order, holding that while culverts impeding andromadous fish migration are not <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>factor</b> diminishing their upstream habitat, in building and maintaining culverts that impede salmon migration, Washington State had diminished the size of salmon runs within the case area and thereby violated its obligation under the Stevens Treaties. On March 29, 2013, the court issued an injunction ordering the state to significantly increase the effort for removing state-owned culverts that block habitat for salmon and steelhead, and to replace the state-owned culverts that have the greatest adverse impact on the habitat of andromadous fish by 2030.|$|E
5|$|The atomic radii of the {{alkali metals}} {{increase}} {{going down the}} group. Because of the shielding effect, when an atom {{has more than one}} electron shell, each electron feels electric repulsion from the other electrons as well as electric attraction from the nucleus. In the alkali metals, the outermost electron only feels a net charge of +1, as some of the nuclear charge (which is equal to the atomic number) is cancelled by the inner electrons; the number of inner electrons of an alkali metal is always one less than the nuclear charge. Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>factor</b> which affects the atomic radius of the alkali metals is the number of electron shells. Since this number increases down the group, the atomic radius must also increase down the group.|$|E
5|$|During late August {{and into}} early September 1961, an unusual series of {{low-level}} disturbances developed over Central and West Africa {{and into the}} eastern Atlantic Ocean. One of these systems, that probably formed over Central Africa {{at the end of}} August, became increasingly organized as it moved over Nigeria on September1. As the disturbance travelled steadily westward, its mid-level circulation became well defined, and the accompanying low-level centre gradually followed suit. An upper-level anticyclone accompanied the storm during this entire period, providing a favorable upper-air regime for strengthening. According to a post-storm study in 1962, all the necessary environmental ingredients were available to the disturbance while it was over land; <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>factor</b> inhibiting earlier development was a lack of access to the warm waters. Around 1200UTC on September5, the low emerged off the coast of Senegal as a strong tropical depression or tropical storm. By this time, the system had a central pressure below 1006mbar (hPa; 29.71inHg), and sustained winds of 35mph (55km/h) were reported in Bissau, Guinea-Bissau. As the system neared Cape Verde, it continued to intensify and by the evening of September6, reports from the nearby Danish tanker Charlotte Maersk indicated that the system was already at or near hurricane intensity.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of this {{analysis}} an important point appears: all the fictitious accelerations must be included to obtain the correct trajectory. In particular, besides the Coriolis acceleration, the centrifugal force plays an essential role. It is easy to get the impression from verbal discussions of the cannonball problem, which focus on displaying the Coriolis effect particularly, that the Coriolis force is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>factor</b> that must be considered, but that is not so. A turntable for which the Coriolis force is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>factor</b> is the parabolic turntable. A somewhat more complex situation is the idealized example of flight routes over long distances, where the centrifugal force of the path and aeronautical lift are countered by gravitational attraction.|$|E
