500|$|Peter Applebome, {{an editor}} of The New York Times, wrote in 2003 of his {{experience}} as an adult participating with his son in Scouting activities, [...] "I feel lucky to have had this unexpected vehicle <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>my</b> son's youth, to shape it, and to be shaped by it as well." [...] He concluded that, although Scouting is viewed by some as old-fashioned, [...] "Scouting's core values...are wonderful building blocks for a movement and a life. Scouting's genuinely egalitarian goals and instincts are more important now than they've ever been. It's {{one of the only}} things that kids do that's genuinely cooperative, not competitive." ...|$|E
500|$|His detractors {{include his}} {{extended}} {{family and his}} father's former secretary, Barbara Wilson. She told reporters that Bamber used to provoke his parents, riding in circles around his mother on a bicycle, wearing make-up to upset his father, and once hiding a bag of live rats in the secretary's car. Whenever Bamber visited the farm, there were arguments, she said. Tension had apparently increased {{in the weeks before}} the murders; she said Nevill had remarked to her about foreseeing a [...] "shooting accident". Bamber's girlfriend, Julie Mugford, alleged that he had talked about killing his family. A farm worker testified that Bamber had once said of Sheila: [...] "I'm not going <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>my</b> money with my sister." [...] In March 1985 he reportedly told a cousin: [...] "I could kill anybody...I could easily kill my parents". Bamber denied having said any of these things.|$|E

He started all the games he played in and averaged team bests of 15.6 ppg, 8.0 rpg, 1.56 bpg, while shooting 60.7 percent from the field. At the Olympics itself, the team lost three games on its way to a bronze medal. The record represented more losses in a single year than in the 68 previous years combined. It was also the first time since NBA professionals became eligible that the U.S. men's basketball team returned home without gold medals at the Olympics.

500|$|This Is What the Truth Feels Like {{features}} {{a range of}} genres; including pop, reggae, disco and dancehall, R, hip hop and [...] "punky" [...] electro-pop music. Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly viewed it as [...] "an album so directly torn from Stefani's recent, much-documented romantic upheavals {{that it could be}} called 'The Ballad of Blake and Gavin". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic added that: [...] "Stefani spends roughly half of the record singing breezy songs of liberation." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine commented: [...] "While an artist converting personal tragedy into creative capital is hardly new, the nakedness with which Stefani assesses the ruins of her relationship is stark, especially compared to the self-proclaimed guilty pleasures of Love. Angel. Music. Baby. and The Sweet Escape." [...] On writing about both relationships, Stefani claimed: [...] "I don't have any secrets; I don't have anything to hide. I haven't done anything wrong. I'm happy <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>my</b> story. [...] is really the only record I've written that's mostly happy; all the others are about heartbreak. And there's some of that on here—it needed that, to make the rest feel as good as it feels." ...|$|E
