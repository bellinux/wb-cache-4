6000|$|... 'What becomes {{of those}} dear little girls? They {{want to make}} {{themselves}} a present to me, and say <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> would like it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They say <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> knocked Andrew Felps down," [...] went on Dudder, {{finding some}} {{consolation}} {{in the fact}} that Ham was in difficulties too.|$|E
6000|$|... "He is right," [...] said Sakr-el-Bahr. [...] "But {{the truth}} is that they will not fire to sink us because <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> to be aboard." ...|$|E
6000|$|TOUCHIT.--I have {{a mind to}} {{tell those}} two ladies what I think of Miss Julia Prior. If <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> as I <b>know</b> <b>you,</b> O Julia Prior, what a short reign yours would be! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps {{it may be}} quietly arranged," [...] {{said the}} lawyer. [...] "If <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> had {{discovered}} the false registration of these men, they would never dare vote them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He did!" [...] exclaimed Kells {{under his}} breath. Then he laughed. [...] "Can't fool that gang. I guess it doesn't matter. Maybe it'd be well if <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> shot me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{it was the}} Frobishers {{who saved}} you by sending off a rescue party!" [...] she exclaimed when he had finished. [...] "But how did <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> were in danger?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never be too sure, Sir Terence. Matters here must ever {{be under}} discussion. There are your {{secretaries}} and the ladies--and Samoval {{has a great}} way with the women. What <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> may wager that he knows." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Foster grimly, [...] "you're taking steep chances just now. The {{police will}} be here to-morrow and there'll be trouble if <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> tried to help their {{prisoner}} escape. Where's the telegram he threw you down?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Gerard," [...] she protested, [...] "you are {{treating}} {{me as if}} I was a young lady. What would they say at the great house, if <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> had done that?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "And this is life eternal, that <b>they</b> should <b>know</b> <b>thee</b> {{the only}} true God" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{wife has}} been telling me that <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> at home, Whitney; and {{that she and her}} people did you some terrible injustice, somehow. But she wouldn't go into the matter. Curious, isn't it, your meeting at this end of the world; and that, too, at such a moment?" ...|$|R
6000|$|GERALD. Good night.--They're very bucked to see {{me sitting}} here with a woman--a young lady as they'll say. I guess your name will be flying round to-morrow. They stop partly {{to have a good}} look at you. Do <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>you,</b> do you think? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, you mustn't go there. <b>They</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> now. It {{was some}} of El Orobo's men you shot up day before {{yesterday}} when you took their steers from them. They recognized the pony, {{and one of them}} had seen you in Cuivaca the night of the robbery. They would be sure to get you, Billy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{of course}} he was right," [...] said Dulphemia with emphasis. [...] "Exactly; he was {{perfectly}} right. <b>They</b> <b>know,</b> <b>you</b> know. We were afraid that there might be trouble, but Mr. Newberry went and saw Franklin afterwards and he behaved very well over it. But suppose we go and dress? It's half-past six already and we've only an hour." ...|$|E
50|$|HCSB: May <b>they</b> <b>know</b> that <b>You</b> alone— {{whose name}} is Yahweh— are the Most High over all the earth.|$|R
6000|$|For a full minute, in dead silence, Serviss {{debated the}} matter, then rose to comply. Mrs. Lambert met him with cordial hand, saying, in a whisper: [...] "We did not <b>know</b> <b>you</b> were coming; but <b>they</b> <b>knew.</b> <b>They</b> want <b>you</b> {{closer to the}} manifestation." ...|$|R
6000|$|Toby now grew angry, and, {{not realizing}} how wholly {{he was in}} the man's power, he retorted: [...] "If you think I'm going round with a dirty face, even if it is speckled, for a dollar a week, you're mistaken, that's all. How many folks would eat your candy if <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> handled it over before you washed your hands?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{not exactly}} dead; we amalgamated it," [...] winked Clodd {{in answer to}} Danvers' inquiry. [...] "It was just a trifle too high-class. Besides, the old gentleman was not getting younger. It hurt him a little at first. But then came Tommy's great success, and that has {{reconciled}} him to all things. Do <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> are in England?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For the present!" [...] ejaculated the Hon. Morison. [...] "You cannot {{mean that}} you expect to return to live among them? Come, come, what foolishness are we talking! The very idea! You are {{spoofing}} me, Miss Meriem. You have been kind to these baboons here and <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> and do not molest you; but that you once lived among them--no, that is preposterous." ...|$|E
60|$|A. I {{think the}} resolutions of right {{will give them}} very little concern if they are never {{attempted}} to be carried into practice. The colonies will probably consider themselves {{in the same situation}} in that respect with Ireland: <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> claim the same right with regard to Ireland, but you never exercise it. And they may believe you never will exercise it in the colonies any more than in Ireland, unless on some very extraordinary occasion.|$|E
5000|$|CSB: May <b>they</b> <b>know</b> that <b>you</b> alone— {{whose name}} is the LORD [...] are the Most High over the whole earth.|$|R
60|$|KEITH. [Moving {{from the}} wall] Curse! I must have left that door. [Suddenly-turning up the light] You told me <b>they</b> didn't <b>know</b> <b>you.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "They don't <b>know</b> <b>you.</b> When <b>they</b> do, they will. Now {{they only}} see what looks like--forgive me, Lena--caprice and coquetry; <b>they</b> will <b>know</b> <b>you</b> in earnest, {{if you will}} let them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "La! little woman," [...] he {{said with}} {{enforced}} lightness, even whilst his voice quivered with the intensity of passion engendered by her presence, her nearness, the perfume of her hair, [...] "how little <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>you,</b> eh? Your brave, beautiful, exquisite soul, shining now through your glorious eyes, would defy the machinations of Satan himself and his horde. Close your dear eyes, my love. I shall go mad with joy if I drink their beauty in any longer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mademoiselle de Marny {{knocked at}} my door an hour ago. She had gone to your room to see you, and, not finding you there, she searched the house for you, and finally, in her anxiety, came to me. We did not dare to tell my mother. I won't ask you where you have been, Anne Mie, but another time, remember, little one, that the streets of Paris are not safe, and that those who love you suffer deeply, when <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> to be in peril." ...|$|E
60|$|Suppose David {{had known}} {{what was to}} happen before he came to you, are you sure he would have come? Undoubtedly there is an unwritten compact in such matters between {{a mother and her}} first-born, and I desire to point out to you that he never breaks it. Again, what will the other boys say when <b>they</b> <b>know?</b> <b>You</b> are outside the {{criticism}} of the Gardens, but David is not. Faith, madam, I believe you would have been kinder to wait and let him run the gauntlet at Pilkington's.|$|E
5000|$|... "Angels Would Fall" [...] {{is about}} a desperate crush Etheridge had on someone else's girlfriend during her {{shattered}} relationship with Julie Cypher. In the verses, she describes the pain she feels because she can tell nobody about her feelings (“The rope that's wrapped around me is cutting through my skin...”), while in the chorus she is singing the desired person's praises (“Angels never came down ... but if <b>they</b> <b>knew,</b> if <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> at all, angels would fall...”).|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, {{do you go}} {{into the}} kitchen. <b>They</b> all <b>know</b> <b>you</b> there. Make {{yourself}} comfortable. I will give orders that you shall be well served." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Surely, my son, <b>they</b> have <b>known</b> <b>you</b> {{too long}} and too well not to respect your motives, and know that {{conscience}} is first with you." ...|$|R
6000|$|This I say of me, {{but think}} of you, Love! This to you--yourself my moon of poets! Ah, but that's the world's side, there's the wonder, Thus they see you, praise you, think <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>you!</b> [...] 190 There, in turn I stand with them and praise you-- Out of my own self, I dare to phrase it. But the best is when I glide from out them, Cross {{a step or two}} of dubious twilight, Come out on the other side, the novel Silent silver lights and darks undreamed of, Where I hush and bless myself with silence.|$|E

6000|$|... "No, it wasn't {{altogether}} that." [...] Mrs. Larkin {{raised her}} thin hand {{and laid it}} appealingly on Jane's. [...] "I don't like to tell you. But--it's this: I told all my friends what you wanted. <b>They</b> <b>know</b> <b>you,</b> care for you, and they said for me to trust Fay to you. Women will talk, you know. It got to the ears of Mormons--gossip of your love for Fay and your wanting her. And it came straight back to me, in jealousy, perhaps, that you wouldn't take Fay as much for love of her as because of your religious duty to bring up another girl for some Mormon to marry." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>you</b> <b>know</b> what I said before. Do <b>they</b> <b>know</b> that <b>you</b> love me? Does {{your father}} know it, and your sister? Why did {{they ask me}} to come here?" ...|$|R
60|$|EMILY--[Spitefully.] Perhaps <b>they</b> <b>know</b> {{more than}} <b>you</b> think they do.|$|R
2500|$|... "Oh my lord, I <b>know</b> that <b>you</b> {{are always}} with me, {{help me to}} obey your commandments. And lead me to share my faith with others, so that <b>they</b> may <b>know</b> <b>you</b> and love you." ...|$|R
