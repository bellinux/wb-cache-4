5000|$|Fuller {{information}} for Coombe Hill Meadows (...) {{is provided in}} the Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust nature reserves handbook. The north meadow part of the reserve is a 55 ha site of wet grassland and drainage ditches. With {{the addition of the}} south meadow the full site (canal and meadows) is a 105 ha reserve. Historically, management of the area included drainage with some of the meadows ploughed (reducing wildlife interest). Restoration work includes control of drainage to enhance the wildlife interest. Ditches have been restored by widening and re-profiling to improve their wildlife value. The rare <b>true</b> <b>fox</b> <b>sedge</b> may be found in some of the ditches.|$|E

50|$|Carex vulpinoidea is {{a species}} of sedge known by the common name <b>fox</b> <b>sedge</b> or American fox-sedge. It is native to North America, {{including}} most of Canada, the Dominican Republic, the United States and parts of Mexico, and it is known in Europe and New Zealand as an introduced species. The sedge lives in wet and seasonally wet habitat, and grows easily as a roadside weed. It produces clumps of stems up to a meter tall. The inflorescence is a dense, tangled cluster of many flower spikes up to about 10 centimeters long. Tolerates fluctuating water levels and periods of drying.|$|R

5000|$|Vulpes [...] is a genus of the Canidae. The {{members of}} this genus are colloquially {{referred}} to as <b>true</b> <b>foxes,</b> meaning they form a proper clade. The word [...] "fox" [...] occurs on the common names of species. <b>True</b> <b>foxes</b> are distinguished {{from members of the}} genus Canis, such as dogs, wolves, coyotes, and jackals, by their smaller size (5-11 kg) and flatter skulls. They have black, triangular markings between their eyes and noses, and the tips of their tails are often a different color from the rest of their pelts. The typical lifespan for this genus is between two and four years, but can reach up to a decade.|$|R

50|$|This genus is {{omnivorous}} {{and prone}} to scavenging. The foods of choice for Vulpes consist of invertebrates, a variety of small vertebrates, grasses, and some angiosperms. The typical intake per day is about 1 kg. <b>True</b> <b>foxes</b> exhibit hoarding behavior or caching where they store away food for another day out of sight from other animals.|$|R
5000|$|The Tibetan sand fox (Vulpes ferrilata) is {{a species}} of <b>true</b> <b>fox</b> endemic to the high Tibetan Plateau, Ladakh plateau, Nepal, China, Sikkim, and Bhutan, up to altitudes of about 5300 m. It is classed as of [...] "least concern" [...] for {{extinction}} by the IUCN, on account of its widespread range in the Tibetan Plateau's steppes and semi-deserts.|$|R
50|$|Other {{members of}} the wider dog family, the Canidae, such as South American canids, <b>true</b> <b>foxes,</b> bat-eared foxes, or raccoon dogs which diverged seven to ten million years ago, are less closely related to and cannot {{hybridize}} with the wolf-like canids because the red fox has 34 metacentric chromosomes and from 0 to 8 small B chromosomes, the raccoon dog has 42 chromosomes, and the fennec fox has 64 chromosomes.|$|R
50|$|Among the <b>true</b> <b>foxes,</b> their skulls are {{the most}} {{specialised}} {{in the direction of}} carnivory; they are longer in their condylobasal length and in mandible and cheek tooth length than those of hill foxes. Their cranial region is shorter than that of hill foxes, and their zygomatic arches narrower. Their jaws are also much narrower, and their foreheads concave. The canine teeth of Tibetan foxes are also much longer than those of hill foxes.|$|R

50|$|The South American foxes (Lycalopex), {{commonly}} called raposas in Portuguese, or zorros in Spanish, are a genus of the Canidae family from South America. Despite their name, {{they are not}} <b>true</b> <b>foxes,</b> but are a unique canid genus, which some somewhat resemble foxes and are named after them. The South American gray fox, Lycalopex griseus, {{is the most common}} species, and is known for its large ears and a highly marketable, russet-fringed pelt.|$|R
5000|$|Known predators of New England cottontails include weasels (Mustela), {{domestic}} cats (Felis catus), <b>true</b> <b>foxes</b> (Vulpes), {{birds of}} prey (Falconiformes), coyotes (Canis latrans), and bobcats (Lynx rufus). To avoid predators, the New England cottontails run for cover; [...] "freeze" [...] and rely on their cryptic coloration; or, when running, follow a zig-zag pattern to confuse the predator. Because New England cottontail habitat is small and has less vegetative cover, they must forage more often in the open, leaving them vulnerable.|$|R
25|$|The {{species was}} {{previously}} {{classified in the}} genus Fennecus, but has since been reclassified to the genus Vulpes which includes {{a variety of other}} types of foxes. Scientists have noted that while there are similarities, there are many differences that set the fennec fox apart from other fox species, including both physical and social traits. This has led to two conflicting classifications: Vulpes zerda, implying that the fennec <b>fox</b> is a <b>true</b> <b>fox,</b> and Fennecus zerda, implying that the fennec fox belongs to its own genus.|$|R
500|$|The red fox (Vulpes vulpes), {{largest of}} the <b>true</b> <b>foxes,</b> has the {{greatest}} geographic range of {{all members of the}} Carnivora order, being present across the entire Northern Hemisphere from the Arctic Circle to North Africa, North America and Eurasia. It is listed as least concern by the IUCN.

5|$|The red fox {{originated}} from smaller-sized ancestors from Eurasia during the Middle Villafranchian period, and colonised North America {{shortly after the}} Wisconsin glaciation. Among the <b>true</b> <b>foxes,</b> the red fox represents a more progressive form {{in the direction of}} carnivory. Apart from its large size, the red fox is distinguished from other fox species by its ability to adapt quickly to new environments. Despite its name, the species often produces individuals with other colourings, including albinos and melanists. Forty-five subspecies are currently recognised, which are divided into two categories: the large northern foxes, and the small, basal southern foxes of Asia and North Africa.|$|R

50|$|The tribe Canini (Fischer de Waldheim, 1817) is {{the sister}} {{group to the}} <b>true</b> <b>foxes</b> (Vulpes), and is {{represented}} today by two sub-tribes: Canina, which includes the genus Canis (wolves, jackals, the coyote, and the domestic dog), {{as well as the}} dhole and the African wild dog; and Cerdocyonina, which includes the so-called foxes of South America. The critical features that mark the Canini as a monophyletic group include: the consistent enlargement of the frontal sinus, often accompanied by the correlated loss of the depression in the dorsal surface of the postorbital process; the posterior expansion of the paroccipital process; the enlargement of the mastoid process; and the lack of lateral flare of the orbital border of the zygoma.|$|R

50|$|The {{teeth of}} the bat-eared fox are much smaller and reduced in {{shearing}} surface formation than teeth of other canid species. This is an adaptation to its insectivorous diet. Due to its unusual teeth, the bat-eared fox was once considered as a distinct subfamily of canids (Otocyoninae). However, according to more recent examinations, it is {{more closely related to}} the <b>true</b> <b>foxes</b> of the genus Vulpes. Other research places the genus as an outgroup which is not very closely related to foxes. The bat-eared fox is an old species that was widely distributed in the Pleistocene era. The teeth are not the bat-eared fox's only morphological adaptation for its diet. The lower jaw has a step-like protrusion called the subangular process, which anchors the large muscle to allow for rapid chewing. The digastric muscle is also modified to open and close the jaw five times per second.|$|R

40|$|The {{roles of}} dietary polyphenols, such as {{resveratrol}} found in {{red wine and}} grape seed extract, have become an increasingly more popular research topic. Dietary polyphenols have even achieved media success for their potential benefits on human health and disease. The success is frequently attributed to the compounds’ antioxidant and reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging abilities. Not only are polyphenols highlighted as the benefitial health constituents of herbal remedies, {{but there are also}} two plant-polyphenol drugs approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration, Crofelemer (a proanthocyanidin oligomer from Croton lechleri) and Veregen (catechins from Camellia sinensis). Due to the demand for novel polyphenolic lead compounds, three major classes were chosen to be explored as part of this dissertation: stilbenes, gallotannins, and ellagitannins. The investigation of stilbenes includes an invited literature update on novel natural stilbenes, which have been isolated and identified since 2009. The review concludes by discussing the biological activities and potential health benefits of this polyphenol sub-class. Additionally, two new monomeric stilbenes, namely, vulpinoideols A and B, along with ten known compounds were isolated from a <b>fox</b> <b>sedge</b> (Carex vulpinoidea) acetone seed extract. All of the isolates were evaluated for their tyrosinase enzyme inhibitory activity, along with the well-known competitive inhibitor, arbutin. A synthetic route for naturally isolated gallotannins, namely, maplexins F and J, previously isolated from red maple (Acer rubrum) tree bark, was developed. Additionally, the ligand-enzyme interaction between the gallotannins and their target enzyme, α-glucosidase, was evaluated using biophsyical tools including isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), fluorescence, and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopic methods. Finally, a synthetic route was also developed for the ellagitannin gut-microbial metabolites, urolithins (dibenzopyranone derivatives), along with analytical UFLC-MS/MS methods to study the cellular and tissue uptake of the urolithins, as well as other dietary polyphenolic metabolites of interest. ...|$|R
