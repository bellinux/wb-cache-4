2500|$|I shrank {{from giving}} a recital {{of these events}} on the account of their {{magnitude}} and abhorrence. [...] Even now I come reluctant to the task, for who would deem it a light thing to sing the death song of Islam and the Muslims or {{find it easy to}} tell this tale? O <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> not given me birth! ...|$|E
2500|$|William Wood {{summed up}} the {{feelings}} of most ex-Confederate soldiers when he wrote, [...] "I was glad to don clean citizen's clothes, <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> kept for me through the war, and to eat a good dinner. Though greatly crushed by the final outcome of our struggle, I felt proud that I had been permitted to do my part, and even to suffer for the cause I loved. Some comfort {{was derived from the}} contemplation {{that there would be no}} more blood shed; but peace, with all it meant to a tired soldier, was at hand." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "True," [...] she replied. [...] "There's {{not much}} good in {{thinking}} of it now. It was unfortunate, by the way, <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> me called Castalia." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Since that I have {{suffered}} a great deal," [...] said Lucius. [...] "Of course you know <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>has</b> been staying at The Cleeve?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Is it indeed?' cried he. 'Well, now, many is {{the time}} <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>has</b> said, when I played her a trick, <b>that</b> <b>my</b> end would be that I should hang {{on the bridge of}} Dublin.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You do not understand; do {{not know}} that I am almost glad <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>has</b> gone--passed safely beyond. She was a good Catholic. If she had lived--" [...] he rose to his feet and stood before the {{trembling}} sister--"if she had lived to know the truth she might have rebelled, have doubted." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{played at}} cards every night, {{if we were}} so inclined," [...] said George, smiling; [...] "and my {{grandfather}} loved Shakspeare so much, <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> not a word to say against her father's favourite author." ...|$|E
6000|$|O that {{my father}} had ne'er on me smil'd; [...] O <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> ne'er to me sung! [...] O that my cradle had never been rock'd; [...] But that I had died when I was young! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If I were {{to enter}} {{a room full of}} people," [...] said the fishy-eyed young man, [...] "and tell them <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> been run over by an omnibus, they would think it the funniest story they had heard in years." ...|$|E
6000|$|P.S. I {{dare say}} you <b>have</b> heard <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>has</b> gone to [...] {{make a long}} stay with a sister at Torquay, and I have let [...] our Cropstone Wood house at quite a nice profit. I am [...] staying {{for a few weeks}} with Lady Powers, who was at school [...] with me.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{see your}} drift, Gil. You {{want to be}} a comfort to me, but I've been digging down into my memory, and I know now <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>has</b> been trained into these habits, these delusions, for over twenty years. It won't be an easy thing {{to get her out of}} them. She is as much deceived as the rest. I am sure of that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's right, Bill. You see {{you ought}} to do it, not only to please your mother, but to please God. <b>That's</b> what <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>has</b> told me over and over again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is. What {{it means}} I do not know, {{but it was}} given to me because of some dream <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> the night before I was born. Do you tell me what it means, since you seem to know so much." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you. Well, {{you must}} know <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> a {{beautiful}} voice-- O! much more beautiful than mine. Indeed, I do not joke, so you need not laugh. It was so sweet that men were always forced to listen till she was done. They could not help it." ...|$|E
6000|$|Those {{were the}} words! Hardly an hour had elapsed since Mrs. Van Brandt's own lips {{had told me}} that our union was impossible. Not even half an hour had passed since I had given the {{directions}} which would restore to liberty the man who was the one obstacle to my marriage. And this was the time <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> innocently chosen for consenting to receive as her daughter-in-law Mrs. Van Brandt! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Bartol {{suggests}} <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> may <b>have</b> been hypnotized by Pettus {{and made}} to work his will, and I think he's right. He thinks the whole thing comes down to illusion--to hypnotic control and telepathy." ...|$|R
5000|$|In January 2002, Channel 4 {{broadcast}} a documentary film on Sara and Flora Keays. In it Flora said: “I {{would like to}} see him. If he loved me, he would want to see me and be in my everyday life... I think my father has behaved very badly towards me. I feel jealous <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>has</b> known him but I haven’t, and jealous of other people who go on holiday with their fathers, when I don’t.” Sara Keays is shown telling her daughter that her father has never seen her because [...] "he didn't {{want anything to do with}} us." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{curriculum}} I now pursued was so {{vastly different}} from <b>that</b> which <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> bidden Fra Gervasio to set me, and my acquaintance with the profane writers advanced so swiftly {{once it was}} engaged upon, that I acquired knowledge as a weed grows.|$|R
60|$|I {{could hardly}} find the door, through {{the tears that}} stood in my eyes. I was so sorry for my mother's distress; but I groped my way out, and groped my way {{up to my room}} in the dark, without even having the heart to say good night to Peggotty, or to get a candle from her. When her coming up to look for me, an hour or so afterwards, awoke me, she said <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> gone to bed poorly, and that Mr. and Miss Murdstone were sitting alone.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Mum as a mouse,' said he, and {{pressing}} my hand turned {{away into the}} darkness. When I returned to the sitting-room I found <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> hurried into the kitchen, where the crackling of sticks showed that she was busy in building a fire. Decimus Saxon was seated {{at the edge of}} the iron-bound oak chest at the side of my father, and was watching him keenly with his little twinkling eyes, while the old man was fixing his horn glasses and breaking the seals of the packet which his strange visitor had just handed to him.|$|E
60|$|I was at {{the time}} a lad in my thirteenth year, but I was well-grown and strong beyond my age, despite the fact <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> {{restrained}} me from all those exercises of horsemanship, of arms, and of wrestling by which boys of my years attain development. I stood almost as tall then as Falcone himself--who was accounted of a good height--and if my reach fell something short of his, I made up for this by the youthful quickness of my movements; so that soon--unless out of good nature he refrained from exerting his full vigour--I found myself Falcone's match.|$|E
6000|$|... "If I {{presume to}} make another remark," [...] said the prince calmly, but pale, [...] "it is only, believe me, sir, from the {{profound}} respect I feel for you. Do not misunderstand these feelings, sir. They are not unbecoming the past. Now <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>has</b> departed, {{there is no one}} to whom I am attached except yourself. I have no feeling whatever towards any other human being. All my thought and all my sentiment are engrossed by my country. But pardon me, dear sir, for so let me call you, if I venture to say that, in your decision on my conduct, you have never taken into consideration the position which I inherited." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But an {{occasion}} {{should have been}} made," [...] said Lucius. [...] "It is monstrous <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> should <b>have</b> been subjected to this accusation for months {{and that no one}} till now should have spoken out to show how impossible it is that she should have been guilty." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{know that}} I behaved badly," [...] she murmured, [...] "but think how poor we were, and oh, how weary I was of poverty. If I had refused Major Delahaye I think <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> would <b>have</b> turned {{me out of}} doors. I wrote and told you all about it." ...|$|R
60|$|But I {{dressed and}} wrapped up expeditiously without waking Charley or any one {{and went down}} to Mr. Bucket, who was the person {{entrusted}} with the secret. In taking me to him my guardian told me this, and also explained how it was that he had come to think of me. Mr. Bucket, in a low voice, by the light of my guardian's candle, read to me in the hall a letter <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> left upon her table; and I suppose within ten minutes of my having been aroused I was sitting beside him, rolling swiftly through the streets.|$|E
60|$|This was the crisis. She had to {{come home}} without the boys, and though they arrived long before any of the {{authorities}} knew of their absence, she owned with tears {{that she could not}} conscientiously be responsible any longer for Griffith,--who not only openly defied her authority, but had found out how little she knew, and laughed at her. I have reason to believe also <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> discovered that she frequented the preachings of Rowland Hill and Baptist Noel; and had confiscated some unorthodox tracts presented to the servants, thus being alarmed lest she should implant the seeds of dissent.|$|E
60|$|On {{that same}} {{occasion}} I learned, {{for the first}} time, from Miss Abbot's communications to Bessie, {{that my father had}} been a poor clergyman; <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> married him against the wishes of her friends, who considered the match beneath her; that my grandfather Reed was so irritated at her disobedience, he cut her off without a shilling; that after my mother and father had been married a year, the latter caught the typhus fever while visiting among the poor of a large manufacturing town where his curacy was situated, and where that disease was then prevalent: that my mother took the infection from him, and both died within a month of each other.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>that</b> <b>my</b> dear <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> more command over herself! She {{can have}} no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual {{reflections}} on him. But I will not repine. It cannot last long. He will be forgot, and we shall all be as we were before." ...|$|R
60|$|That the old man-at-arms {{should have}} exerted a strong {{attraction}} upon my young mind, you will readily understand. His intimate connection with that dimly remembered father, who stood secretly {{in my imagination}} in the position <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> would <b>have</b> had St. Augustine occupy, drew me to his equerry like metal to a lodestone.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} keeping you here, Father, because I doubt not <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>has</b> been {{breaking}} the news to the girls, of their mother's slaughter. I said nought to them about it. They knew the hold was burnt, and I told them that Allan was wounded; but I thought that, if I gave them {{the worst part of}} the news, it would throw them into such deep grief as to unfit them for the journey. It might not have been discovered till two hours after we had started that they had escaped, and in that case we should have been mounted before the Bairds overtook us, {{and it would have been}} a ride for life, and the girls would have needed all their strength and courage to keep them up." ...|$|R
60|$|Suddenly, like a manna to my {{starving}} soul, {{came the}} memory of the last talk I had with Fra Gervasio and the solemn warning he had given me. That memory inspired me rightly. To-morrow--despite Messer Fifanti's orders--I would take horse and ride to Mondolfo, there to confess myself to Fra Gervasio and to be guided by his counsel. My mother's vows concerning me I saw in their true light. They were not binding upon me; indeed, I should be doing a hideous wrong were I to follow them against my inclinations. I must not damn my soul for anything <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> vowed or ever I was born, however much she might account that it would be no more than filial piety so to do.|$|E
60|$|Morning {{and evening}} {{appeared}} my father's great {{face in the}} doorway, his eyebrows lifted high above his spectacles. To see his misery I almost wished that I might die to spare him more. When Dr Grose gave him permission, he sat down beside my bed and stooping low, told me <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> remembered our last speech together on the staircase, {{and he gave me}} her last message. A thousand and one remembrances of her patience and impulsiveness, of our long hours of solitude together, of her fits of new life {{as if she were a}} tree blossoming in the Spring, of her voice, her dignified silence with Miss Fenne, her sallies with my grandfather, her absent musings--these all return to me.|$|E
60|$|Also I {{was pleased}} with another thing, namely, <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> told me that I should live my life and not die that day by the hand of Frenchmen; and that in my life I should find love, of which to tell truth already I knew a little of a humble sort, for I was a comely youth, and women did not run away from me, or if they did, soon they stopped. I wanted to live my life, I wanted to see great adventures and to win great love. The {{only part of the}} {{business}} which was not to my taste was that command of my mother's, that I should go to London to sit in a goldsmith's shop. Still, I had heard that there was much to be seen in London, and at least it would be different from Hastings.|$|E
60|$|But it {{was found}} {{eventually}} in the first box-the box, <b>that</b> is, <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>had</b> intended to search first, but which, acting on Anna's suggestion, she had reserved till the last. This caused <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> to be quite short with Anna, who she said had wasted her time. But by Tuesday afternoon all stood ready: we were to start early Wednesday morning.|$|R
6000|$|July 21.--Letter from Caroline. Query: Is 'a {{friend of}} ours and the Marlets,' of whom she now {{anonymously}} and mysteriously speaks, the same personage as the 'M. de la Feste' of her former letters? He must be the same, I think, from his pursuits. If so, whence this sudden change of tone? [...] . I have been lost in thought {{for at least a}} quarter of an hour since writing the preceding sentence. Suppose my dear sister is falling in love with this young man--there is no longer any doubt about his age; what a very awkward, risky thing for her! I do hope <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>has</b> an eye on these proceedings. But, then, poor mother never sees the drift of anything: she is in truth less of a mother to Caroline than I am. If I were there, how jealously I would watch him, and ascertain his designs! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then, you see, {{if we want}} {{a little}} more time, a horse may cast its shoe, {{or some of the}} baggage may be missing, or perhaps an {{important}} paper somehow gets mislaid. It is curious how often these things happen. Then, when they arrive here they find that I have, as usual, gone off for a fortnight's hunting among the mountains; and <b>that,</b> perhaps, <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>has</b> started for Nerac.|$|R
