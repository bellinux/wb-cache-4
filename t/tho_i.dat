60|$|As for Arbitrary Power {{of taking}} men into custody, for matters {{that had no}} {{relation}} to Privileges of Parliament, he says they have erred with their Fathers. If he confess that they have erred, let it be with all their Generation, still they have erred: and an error of the first digestion, is seldom mended in the second. But I find him modest in this point; and knowing too well {{they are not a}} Court of Judicature, he does not defend them from Arbitrary Proceedings, but only excuses, and palliates the matter, by saying, that it concern'd the Rights of the People, in suppressing their Petitions to the Fountain of Justice. So, when it makes for him, he can allow the King to be the Fountain of Justice, but at other times he is only a Cistern of the People. But he knows sufficiently, however he dissembles it, that there were some taken into custody, to whom that crime was not objected.

Dette er ei avansert tablettmaskin som svært nøyaktig måler distansen tablettstempelet har gått (på mikrometernivå) og kor stor kraft som er involvert under komprimeringa (samantrykkinga av pulveret). Pektin med metoksyleringsgrad under 10 % (også kalla pektinsyrer) gav dei mekanisk sterkaste tablettane, og er såleis den pektintypen det bør fokuserast på i framtidige forsøk med pektin som eit tabletthjelpestoff. Høgmetoksylert pektin, dvs. meir enn 50 % metoksylering, var ueigna i tablttering ettersom dei ikkje gav samanhengande tablettar. Hovudsakleg skjedde det ein elastisk deformasjon med pektinpartiklane, og sidan dette generelt er ugunstig med hensyn på binding og mekanisk sterke tablettar vart det undersøkt kva mekanismar som bidreg til at tablettane heng saman. Det vart funne at ei viss grad av fragmentering skjedde i pektinsyrene. Plastisk deformasjon var det lite av. Avhandlinga viser at pektinsyrene og til dels andre pektintypar med metoksylering mindre enn eller lik 40 % er veleigna som eit tabletthjelpestoff som kan fungere som ein bærar av ein aktiv substans til tjukktarmen. This thesis is dedicated to direct compression studies of pectin, a natural polysaccharide with potential as a pharmaceutical excipient due to its ability {{to act as a}} carrier for colon-specific drug delivery as well as for sustained drug release purposes. The main objective of this thesis was to study the suitability of pectin as a matrix former in tablets. The compressibility and compactibility of pectin powders were studied as a function of various degree of methoxylation (DM) grades and different particle sizes. Pectin powders with similar powder characteristics were compressed by direct compression on a compaction simulator and an instrumented tablet press, respectively. The results showed that pectin powders, irrespective of DM and particle size, were classified as class IIA powders, showing a low degree of particle rearrangement and a relatively low degree of fragmentation. The powders were relatively soft and resembled the deformation behaviour of pregelatinized starch, an elastically deforming material. The pectinic acids (DM ≤ 10 %) were slightly more viscoelastic than the other pectin grades. However, in general terms, it should be emphasized that the DM had a limited effect on the compression behaviour (i. e. compressibility) although an increased DM gave slightly softer and slightly less brittle particles. On the contrary, the compactibility was strongly dependent on both DM and initial particle size. The low-methoxylated (LM) pectin (DM < 50 %) and especially pectinic acids (DM ≤ 10 %) produced mechanically strong tablets, whereas the high-methoxylated (HM) pectins did not produce coherent tablets. The tensile strength increased with decreasing initial particle size. Pectin also proved to have a high dilution potential as a binder/matrix former, as coherent tablets were produced even when 70 % of an inert material was incorporated. To summarize, the results showed that pectins with DM ≤ 40 % have potential as direct compression excipients in tablets...|$|E

These gave way to various societal changes in the area, such as population increase, new jobs and rise in housing prices, {{in addition to a}} range of side effects on the service factor. The aim {{of this article is to}} explore if women in the area describe new employment opportunities accompanying these changes. The results are derived from in-depth interviews with 34 women in East Iceland. The interviews unfold the view that a certain ‘modernization’ of the east Icelandic society can be attributed to the smelter construction. However, the women interviewed have difficulty defining whether and how they themselves had profited from the constructions and none of those interviewed in this research named working in the smelter as one of their employment opportunities. Among the reasons discussed were the twelve-hour shifts, lack of flexibilities, long distances and the binding to the workplace during work-hours. Results indicate that an unequal gender balance still remainsin the area.

40|$|Transcription begins] Mar 2, 1944 Bryant Service Club Bryant College Dear Friends, Thank you {{for your}} letter of Dec 8 th. It has been chasing me over {{a good portion of}} New Guinea I guess thus the delay. As yet your xmas package has not arrived. I suspect that it too is having {{difficulty}} finding me. At present I’m at an advance Air Base helping to establish facilities for our sqdn when it moves up. The Japs at one point are within four miles of here. They’re pocketed up in the mountains by American + Aussie units. Our own dive bombers have been coming over every day pounding gun positions and personell [sic]. It’s been a thrilling spectacle to watch. Tojo won’t last much longer here and soon life will settle down to the dull routine that marks a squadron’s operation – for the ground personell [sic] at any rate. Our group thus far has established an amazing record against Tojo. It holds the win-loss record for any group in the Air Corps. To date they’re knocked down 177 Japs and <b>tho</b> <b>I</b> can’t state losses it is extremely small. During the December landing at Cape Gloucester our group knocked down 53 Japs to the loss of none- a world’s record. Col. Neal Kearby our former group C. O. holds the record for enemy planes shot down in the S. W. P. area. His plane carries 23 Jap flags. He’s the chap awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for shooting down six Japs in one mission. The reason for this marked superiority of Tojo is at times hard to believe – It can only be explained by superior tactics and a great plane. The P- 47 is a hard plane to knock down as many a dead Jap pilot could testify if he were still alive. I hope I haven’t bragged too much about my outfit but I am proud {{to be a part of}} the organization. Everyone, from the top down, is doing a swell job under difficult conditions. We live primatively [sic] and are constantly on the move. We hope to be relieved soon this being our tenth month of combat operation. We look for a couple of months in Australia to catch up on our long neglected social life. Then back home or maybe to China. SO much for now- Thanks for writing and I shall confirm receipt of your xmas gift when it arrives. Regards to my old friends at Bryant and to my classmates of ’ 36 wherever they may be. Sincerely, Warren [Transcription ends...|$|E
