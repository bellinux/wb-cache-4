5|$|Because with Calcraft's methods the {{condemned}} took several minutes to die, to hasten death Calcraft would sometimes dramatically pull on legs or climb on shoulders {{in an effort}} to break a victim's neck. It has been speculated that Calcraft used these methods partly <b>to</b> <b>entertain</b> <b>the</b> crowds, sometimes numbering 30,000 spectators or more.|$|E

5|$|The fear of {{national}} disintegration were played upon military leaders close to Suharto and remained {{as one of}} Indonesia's strongest justifications for refusing <b>to</b> <b>entertain</b> <b>the</b> prospect of East Timorese independence or even autonomy until the late 1990s. The military intelligence organisations initially sought a non-military annexation strategy, intending to use APODETI as its integration vehicle.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} was {{also involved in}} the provision of social, educational and cultural institutions to Belgian refugees. In 1942, the government sponsored the creation of the Belgian Institute in London <b>to</b> <b>entertain</b> <b>the</b> Belgian refugee community in London. By 1943, there were also four Belgian schools in Britain with 330 pupils between them, in Penrith, Braemar, Kingston and Buxton.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the Second World War Gielgud volunteered for active service, but was told that men of his age, thirty-five, would not be wanted for at least six months.

5|$|On November 4, 1824, {{just months}} after the election, the state capitol {{building}} was destroyed by a fire. Some furnishings and records were saved, but the four-year-old building was a total loss. When Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette toured the United States in 1825, a new capitol {{had not yet been}} constructed and the governor's mansion was too small to host a proper reception, so the governor had <b>to</b> <b>entertain</b> <b>the</b> dignitary at Weisiger's Tavern.|$|E

5|$|The first festival {{was held}} in 1974, {{organised}} by Royce Creasey and friends, as a small event, for the local musicians <b>to</b> <b>entertain</b> <b>the</b> local community. The first festival took place over four successive weekends with bands playing from a stage improvised from a flat bed truck. Bristol City Council donated £50. The following year the festival took place over one weekend and was located near to Ashton Court mansion. After this, new organisers came on board and fund-raising gigs were held enabling the event to grow steadily through the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|The {{successful}} crossing {{was greeted}} with enthusiastic cheers, the tunes of the Young Australian Band, the Albion Brass Band and Cooper and Bailey's International Show Band, who had all come <b>to</b> <b>entertain</b> <b>the</b> crowds, and the shrilling of the steamers' whistles. L'Estrange soon reappeared in a small row boat to greet the crowds, although many had already rushed the steamers to leave, resulting in a few being jostled into the harbour.|$|E
5|$|Because {{remarriage}} {{was often}} {{thought to be}} a sacrilege—common belief (contrary to the Gospel – Luke 20:27–40 and Matthew 22:29–30) was that the sacrament of marriage extended beyond death—it was censured by the community. Thus the purpose of the Bal des Ardents was twofold: <b>to</b> <b>entertain</b> <b>the</b> court and to humiliate and rebuke Isabeau's lady-in-waiting—in an inherently pagan manner, which the Monk of St Denis seemed to dislike. A ritual burning on the wedding night of a woman who was remarrying had Christian origins as well, according to Veenstra. The Book of Tobit partly concerns a woman who had seven husbands murdered by the demon Asmodeus; she is eventually freed of the demon by the burning of the heart and liver of a fish.|$|E

Bear. Several members have noted the shows as a highlight {{of their time in}} the group and over the years it became common for the performance to be the final concert of departing members. Hi-5 did not perform at the Carols between 2013 and 2015, and during this time, appeared at local Christmas events. Hi-5 returned to Carols by Candlelight in 2016 as part of their reestablished partnership with Nine.|$|E
5|$|Relatively isolated, gentry {{families}} {{spent much}} of their time visiting family, friends or neighbours. As a result, hospitality was an important part of life. Leisure activities pursued by the gentry included hunting, cards and chess. Music remained important in noble houses, with accounts listing professional musicians hired <b>to</b> <b>entertain</b> <b>the</b> family and guests. However, professional musicians were expensive to maintain. In the eighteenth century members of the household often provided musical entertainment on the harpsichord, organ and piano. House libraries often contained considerable quantities of music, as at Dalkeith Palace, where the Duke of Buccleuch's daughter collected vocal music between 1780 and 1800. In the nineteenth century it was the women of the family who were the chief performers and men were not expected to play the piano in drawing rooms.|$|E
5|$|The {{pattern of}} {{intermarriage}} continued, as many KMT soldiers married aboriginal {{women who were}} from poorer areas and could be easily bought as wives. Modern studies show {{a high degree of}} genetic intermixing. Despite this, many contemporary Taiwanese are unwilling <b>to</b> <b>entertain</b> <b>the</b> idea of having an aboriginal heritage. In a 1994 study, it was found that 71% of the families surveyed would object to their daughter marrying an aboriginal man. For much of the KMT era the government definition of aboriginal identity had been 100% aboriginal parentage, leaving any intermarriage resulting in a non-aboriginal child. Later the policy was adjusted to the ethnic status of the father determining the status of the child.|$|E

However, they learn that Scaramanga plans to eliminate Bond when the weekend is over. Bond's true identity is confirmed by a KGB agent and Scaramanga makes new plans <b>to</b> <b>entertain</b> <b>the</b> gangsters and the KGB agent by killing Bond while they are riding a sight-seeing train to a marina. However, Bond manages to turn the tables on Scaramanga and, {{with the help of}} Leiter, kill most of the conspirators. Wounded, Scaramanga escapes into the swamps, where Bond pursues him. Scaramanga lulls Bond off-guard and shoots him with a golden derringer hidden in his palm. Bond is hit but returns fire and shoots Scaramanga several times, killing him at last.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{cancellation}} of the German 500 at EuroSpeedway Lausitz due to financial difficulties, {{it was announced that}} the race at Rockingham was going ahead as scheduled. The chief executive of the track invited German CART fans to attend the Rockingham 500. Franchitti, considered by the media to be the pre-race favourite, said a victory at Rockingham would be the highlight of his season and that he wanted <b>to</b> <b>entertain</b> <b>the</b> spectators. Having finished second in the previous year's race, Kenny Bräck believed he could continue his good run of results in Europe and hoped the racing would be competitive. Da Matta said his team had made a large number of adjustments to his car's setup on ovals and hoped his vehicle would be better than it was in Motegi. He believed the Rockingham 500 was important and hoped to secure a top-three finishing position. Carpentier said although he was disappointed with his previous result at the track, he was convinced {{he would be able to}} improve his performance.|$|E
5|$|Kroonland {{returned}} to Saint-Nazaire in May and loaded Major General Joseph E.

The band of the 304th Engineers gave concerts on deck every evening on the voyage home <b>to</b> <b>entertain</b> <b>the</b> men. Though initially bound for Newport News, Kroonlands crew received orders in mid ocean to head instead to New York, where they arrived on 29 May. After completing another passage to Newport News in late June, Kroonland sailed on 19 July with 3,642 passengers—including officers, men, thirteen war brides, and one war baby—from Saint-Nazaire, in the final transport departure from that port before it was closed as a port of embarkation by U.S. military authorities. Among the passengers was Brigadier General Samuel D. Rockenbach, {{the founder of the}} United States Tank Corps.|$|E
