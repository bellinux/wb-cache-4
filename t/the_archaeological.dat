5|$|Merrifield opens The Archaeology of Ritual and Magic by {{discussing}} how archaeologists have understood magic and ritual practices in past societies, opining {{that on the}} whole {{it had been a}} neglected area of study. Looking at <b>the</b> <b>archaeological</b> evidence for ritual activity in the pre-Roman Iron Age and the Roman Iron Age of Britain, he discusses animal and human sacrifice, as well as the offering of votive deposits in rivers and other bodies of water. He moves on to explore the rituals surrounding death and burial, suggesting areas where this ritual activity is visible in the burial record of multiple societies. Merrifield goes on to discuss <b>the</b> <b>archaeological</b> evidence for ritual practices in Christian Europe, highlighting areas of ritual continuance from earlier pagan periods, in particular the deposition of metal goods in water. Looking at the evidence for foundation deposits in European buildings that likely had magico-religious purposes, he then looks at several examples of written charms and spells which have survived in <b>the</b> <b>archaeological</b> record.|$|E
