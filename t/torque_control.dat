Since the aircraft regulates power turbine speed with blade pitch, the reaction caused the aircraft to go airborne with the <b>Torque</b> <b>Control</b> Lever (TCL, or throttle) at idle. [...] The aircraft rose [...] {{into the air}} (initial estimates suggested 20 to 30 feet) and then {{fell to the ground}} causing damage its starboard wing; the damage was valued at approximately US$7 million. [...] It was later found that a miswired Cannon plug to one of the engine's two Full Authority Digital Engine Controls (FADEC) was the cause. The FADEC software was also modified to decrease the time needed for switching between the redundant FADECs to eliminate the possibility of a similar mishap occurring in the future. [...] The aircraft was found to be damaged beyond repair and in July 2009 stricken from Navy list.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – The {{efficiency}} of induction motors decreases at light loads. Efficiency optimizer control systems adjust the motor flux value {{to achieve the}} best efficiency {{in a wide range}} of load variations. Reduced flux operation has some other benefits such as power factor improvement and torque ripple reduction.

In this paper, the effect of flux reference value on the torque ripple of a direct <b>torque</b> <b>controlled</b> induction motor is analyzed. The effect of flux value on torque ripple {{in a wide range of}} speed variations is investigated.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{formulate}} a novel hierarchical controller for walking of <b>torque</b> <b>controlled</b> humanoid robots. Our method uses an online whole body optimization approach which generates joint torques, given Cartesian accelerations of different {{points on the}} robot. Over such variable translation, we can plan our desired foot trajectories in Cartesian space between starting and ending positions of the foot on the ground. On top level, we use the simplified Linear Inverted Pendulum Model {{to predict the future}} motion of the robot. With LIPM, we derive a formulation where the whole system is described by the state of center of mass and footstep locations serve as discrete inputs to this linear system. We then use model predictive control to plan optimal future footsteps which resemble a reference plan, given desired sagittal and steering velocities determined by the high-end user. Using simulations on a child-size <b>torque</b> <b>controlled</b> humanoid robot, the method tolerates various disturbances such as external pushes, sensor noises, model errors and delayed communication in the control loop. It can perform robust walking over slopes and uneven terrains blindly and turn rapidly at the same time. Our generic dynamics model-based method does not depend on any off-line optimization, being suitable for typical <b>torque</b> <b>controlled</b> humanoid robots. 1 I...|$|R

40|$|The <b>torque</b> {{coordination}} <b>control</b> during mode {{transition is}} a very important task for hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) with a clutch serving as the key enabling actuator element. Poor coordination will deteriorate the drivability of the driver and lead to excessive wearing to the clutch friction plates. In this paper, a novel <b>torque</b> coordination <b>control</b> strategy for a single-shaft parallel hybrid electric vehicle is presented to coordinate the motor torque, engine torque, and clutch torque so that the seamless mode switching can be achieved. Different to the existing model predictive control (MPC) methods, only one model predictive controller is needed and the clutch torque is taken as an optimized variable rather than a known parameter. Furthermore, the successful idea of model reference control (MRC) is also used for reference to generate the set-point signal required by MPC. The parameter sensitivity is studied for better performance of the proposed model predictive controller. The simulation results validate that the proposed novel <b>torque</b> coordination <b>control</b> strategy has less vehicle jerk, less torque interruption, and smaller clutch frictional losses, compared with the baseline method. In addition, the sensitivity and adaptiveness of the proposed novel <b>torque</b> coordination <b>control</b> strategy are evaluated...|$|R
