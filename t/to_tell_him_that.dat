On January 11, 1841, Crittenden replied that he expected to be named attorney general and believed he could accept the post before Letcher's preferred deadline.

Alcibiades responded in kind, sending to the authorities at Samos a letter against Phrynichus, stating what he had done, and requiring that he should be put to death. Phrynichus in desperation wrote again to Astyochus, offering him a chance to destroy the Athenian fleet at Samos. This also Astyochus revealed to Alcibiades who informed the officers at Samos that they had been betrayed by Phrynichus. Alcibiades however gained no credit, because Phrynichus had anticipated Alcibiades's letter and, before the accusations could arrive, told the army that he had received information of an enemy plan to attack the camp and that they should fortify Samos as quickly as possible.|$|E
5|$|At 9a.m. on 11 November, Whitlam, {{together}} with {{deputy prime minister}} Frank Crean and Leader of the House Fred Daly, met with the Liberal and Country party leaders.

Whitlam informed the Coalition leaders {{that he would be}} advising Kerr to hold a half-Senate election on 13December, and he would not be seeking interim supply for the period before the election. Thinking it unlikely that Kerr would grant the election without supply, Fraser warned Whitlam that the Governor-General might make up his own mind about the matter. Whitlam was dismissive and after the meeting broke, telephoned Kerr <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> he needed an appointment to advise him to hold a half-Senate election. Both men were busy in the morning, Kerr with Remembrance Day commemorations, and Whitlam with a caucus meeting and a censure motion in the House which the Opposition had submitted. The two discussed a meeting for 1:00p.m., though Kerr's office later called Whitlam's and confirmed the time as 12:45. Word of this change did not reach the Prime Minister. Whitlam announced the request for a half-Senate election to his caucus, which approved it.|$|E

5|$|Takumi {{learns that}} he is an artificial, {{delusional}} clone with fabricated memories, created by Shogun – the real Takumi. His sister Nanami is being held in the location of the real Noah II, where she is made to awaken as a gigalomaniac and obtain a Di-Sword. Rimi – also a gigalomaniac – tries to save her, but is attacked by Norose and is taken prisoner in Nanami's stead. Shogun again meets with Takumi <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> he had intended to stop Nozomi from taking over humanity with Noah II, but that his body – aged from disease and overuse of gigalomaniac powers – hindered him, prompting him to create Takumi to do it in his stead. Takumi obtains a Di-Sword, and destroys the transmitters, revealing the nurse Hazuki to be the New Gen killer in the process by reading her memories and projecting them onto the screens on the buildings. An earthquake occurs, destroying much of Shibuya; Takumi rescues the other gigalomaniacs from the destruction, and continues to the location of Noah II. He fights Norose, but Noah II activates its self-defense mode, overwhelming Takumi with delusions; he reaffirms his existence, and destroys Norose and Noah II with his Di-Sword. As he lies in the ruins of Shibuya, depending on what delusions the player has chosen, he either gives up his life along with the dying Shogun's, or stays alive with Rimi.|$|E
