5|$|After {{the events}} of Iron Man 3, Mike Peterson is out with his son, Ace, when {{the top floor of}} a nearby {{building}} explodes. Peterson uses enhanced strength to save a trapped woman from the building, and is filmed doing so by Skye, a member of the hacktivist group <b>the</b> <b>Rising</b> Tide. S.H.I.E.L.D. deputy director Maria Hill interviews Grant Ward for a new team under Agent Phil Coulson, who is officially dead. Coulson assigns Ward level 7 security clearance, and reveals the team's first mission is to investigate <b>the</b> <b>Rising</b> Tide. Coulson also recruits the reluctant Agent Melinda May, who had previously retired from field duty.|$|E

30|$|The right {{panel of}} Fig.  4 shows the {{relationship}} between the amplitude and <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> time of <b>the</b> PI. The vertical axis indicates the magnetic field amplitude of the PI. The horizontal axis indicates <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> time of <b>the</b> PI. <b>The</b> <b>rise</b> times in <b>the</b> speed jump simulations are shorter than those in the density jump simulations. <b>The</b> <b>rise</b> time is determined by the time in which the solar wind discontinuity passes through the effective length of the magnetosphere. The solar wind velocity in the speed jump simulations is higher than that in the density jump simulations. Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> times in <b>the</b> speed jump simulations are shorter than those in the density jump simulations. In both the speed jump and density jump simulations, the PI amplitude increases as <b>the</b> PI <b>rise</b> time decreases. This tendency {{is the same as the}} relation between <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> time and <b>the</b> amplitude of the DL investigated by Araki et al. (2004). On the other hand, a difference is that <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> time of <b>the</b> PI is shorter than that of <b>the</b> DL. <b>The</b> <b>rise</b> time of <b>the</b> PI is at most 90 s, while <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> time of <b>the</b> DL is at least 1.5 – 9 min. We can estimate the effective length of the PI from the product of the solar wind velocity and <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> time in our simulation results, which is ~ 3.5 Re from the speed jump simulations. This indicates that the effective region of the PI is more localized than that of the DL, which has an effective length of 30 Re. The reason for <b>the</b> short PI <b>rise</b> time is that the dynamo generating the FAC is localized in the dayside magnetosphere. We next discuss the mechanism by which the dynamo generates the magnetic field disturbance on the ground via the magnetosphere-ionosphere current system.|$|R

40|$|After {{violence}} has been stopped in conflicts {{the international community}} has attempted to build durable peace in the conflict regions. Previous research focused on the success of and the criticism on UN-led peacebuilding while not considering unilateral peacebuilding in detail. This thesis hypothesizes that peacebuilding by the US before <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> of <b>the</b> UN is more successful than unilateral peacebuilding thereafter. Furthermore, a US peacebuilding mission before <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> of <b>the</b> UN will be more expansive with regard to the instruments used than a mission after <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> of <b>the</b> UN. 15 cases that took place before and after <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> of <b>the</b> UN confirm that US peacebuilding efforts were indeed more successful before <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> of <b>the</b> UN. These cases reveal that peacebuilding not necessarily became less expansive after <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> of <b>the</b> UN but that the nature of peacebuilding shifted towards democratization and financial aid, for instance...|$|R

30|$|The {{amplitude}} of the PI is larger when <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> time is shorter. This {{is consistent with}} the relationship between <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> time and {{amplitude of}} the DL, and <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> time of <b>the</b> PI is shorter than that of the DL because the effective length of the PI, i.e., the dynamo region, is shorter than that of the DL. Also, <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> time of <b>the</b> PI is shorter at an enhanced speed than at an enhanced density. It is therefore suggested that a high-speed solar wind is needed to create a rapid magnetic variation.|$|R
