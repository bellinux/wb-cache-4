40|$|A {{research}} project {{was carried out}} in which a DAF engine was equipped with a two-stage turbocharging system. Objectives were to investigate an engine concept with very high BMEP (25 - 30 bars), maintaining acceptable emissions and fuel consumption, while concentrating on the control system and transient performance. Two-stage turbocharging has several advantages compared with single stage turbocharging. Two-stage turbocharging enables high specific power levels across a broad speed range. In addition transient behaviour of a two-stage turbocharged engine is improved because of the combination of a small (and fast) High Pressure turbocharger and a larger Low Pressure turbocharger. Especially at high intake manifold pressures (pressure ratio > 3. 5) the overall efficiency of two-stage turbocharging is better than with single state turbocharging. The two-stage system on the engine that was tested consists of two parallel Low Pressure turbochargers, a High Pressure turbocharger with controlled <b>by-pass</b> <b>valve,</b> and a cooler behind the High Pressure compressor. With this configuration BSFC was optimised, while maintaining EURO III emission levels. Also transient tests were carried out, whereby the transient behaviour was compared with that of the current DAF engine. In the development of the control algorithms for the <b>by-pass</b> <b>valve,</b> simulatons were used with a complete engine model built in Matrixx. These simulations were also used to estimate transient performance of the engine concept, prior to the test program. In addition the engine model was used to analyse the measured data, and to understand several transient effects that play a role. The results show that two-stage turbocharging is an effective way to increase specific power output while maintaining acceptable fuel consumption and transient performance...|$|R

Finite Element Method (FEM) model of a high pressure (HP) <b>by-pass</b> <b>valve</b> body and a steam turbine rotor shaft (used in a coal power plant) is presented. The main damaging factor in both cases is fatigue due to cycles of rapid temperature changes. The crack initiation, occurring at a relatively low number of load cycles, depends on alternating or alternating-incremental changes in plastic strains. The crack propagation is determined by the classic fracture mechanics, based on finite element models and the most dangerous case of brittle fracture.

40|$|Turbocharging is {{becoming}} a key technology for automotive spark ignition engines (fed with both liquid and gaseous fuel) as a support to the downsizing concept {{in order to reduce}} fuel consumption and exhaust emissions.

40|$|The {{operating}} temperature of a loop heat pipe (LHP) {{is governed by}} the saturation temperature of its compensation chamber (CC); the latter is in turn determined by the balance among the heat leak from the evaporator to the CC, the amount of subcooling carried by the liquid returning to the CC, {{and the amount of}} heat exchanged between the CC and ambient.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an experimental study carried out on a prototype of a hermetic scroll expander, integrated into a gas cycle test rig, whose working fluid is HFC- 245 fa. This system was designed to test only the performance of the expander. It is mainly made up of a scroll compressor, a scroll expander, a heat exchanger and a <b>by-pass</b> <b>valve.</b> The latter is used to adjust the pressure ratio imposed to the expander. The expander is originally a compressor designed for heat pump applications and characterized by a nominal power input of 2. 5 kWe. Performance of the expander is evaluated in terms of isentropic effectiveness and filling factor as function of the main operating conditions. The study also investigates the impact of oil mass fraction on the expander performance. Maximum overall isentropic effectiveness of 71. 03 % is measured, which is partly explained by the good volumetric performance of the machine. Using the experimental data, parameters of a semi-empirical simulation model of the expander are identified. This model is used to analyze the measured performance of the expander.

40|$|In {{regulated}} two-stage sequential turbocharging systems, a smaller, {{high pressure}} (HP), and a larger, low pressure (LP), turbocharger are sequentially positioned {{to recover the}} energy available in the exhaust gases and deliver acceptable level of boost to the intake of an internal combustion engine. Due to the different sizes of the turbochargers, <b>by-pass</b> <b>valves</b> are placed in the system to control operations. Due to the turbocharging system layout, {{it is clear that}} the air pressurized by the LP compressor enters nonuniformly the HP compressor. This is caused by the rotating radial compressor and the interconnecting bends which cause swirl and velocity to scatter, respectively. Furthermore, the heat transfer in the two turbochargers may have an effect on the apparent efficiencies. For these reasons, the standard mapping approach for turbochargers is not able to take into account the effect of non-uniform flow and heat transfer. In this paper, a novel approach for mapping the two-stage turbocharging system is proposed and performed into a monodimensional simulation code. Although, flow non-uniformity and turbochargers heat transfer effects on the performance of the turbocharging system are not considered, at this present time, the study centralizes on the investigation and the validation of the mapping approach. In fact, a two-stage sequential turbocharging system has been considered for the study and a simulation code to investigate the mapping technique has been implemented...|$|R
40|$|The authors examine in {{this paper}} the {{response}} of a micro gas turbine (MGT) combustor when supplied with gaseous fuels from biomass treatment or solid waste pyrolysis or from an anaerobic digestion process. Actually, a sort of off-design operation is induced by the employment of low calorific value fuels both in the combustor and in the whole micro turbine system. The objective is to optimize the combustor behaviour under {{the point of view}} of combustion efficiency and pollutant control. The first part of the paper discusses preliminary pollutant estimation, basing on a non-dimensional, time-dependent model that solves the kinetic equations for nitric oxides formation in the residence time domain. The initial conditions are derived from a thermo-fluid dynamic analysis of the MGT system under several conditions induced by the activation of a recuperator <b>by-pass</b> <b>valve.</b> In the second part of the paper, a CFD study employs as boundary conditions those obtained from the thermo-fluid dynamic MGT simulation and it relies on different methods for approaching the fuel oxidation process. In particular, the partially stirred reactor hypothesis combined with a flamelet model is able to describe the mechanisms of both primary oxidation and pollutant formation. Several solutions are also examined in order to improve the combustion efficiency with poor calorific value fuels. The simultaneous objective of nitric oxide reduction is attained through a proper choice of an alternate location of the pilot injector aiming at exploiting a sort of internal EGR...|$|R
40|$|The {{continually}} growing demands {{over the}} quality of the environment, followed by the progressive legislation aimed at controlling pollutants, have created a need for a further development of the engine design and the exhaust gas after treatment systems as well. In order to achieve extensive reduction of the pollutants and appropriate engine performance, an optimization of an ethanol fueled version of the Volvo TD 73 diesel engine was performed based on a computerized analysis of measured engine parameters. A back pressure regulator (ATR) is mounted on the turbocharger outlet; therefore the engine was forced to work against a back pressure, particularly at light loads where the emission levels are expected to be undesirable. Hence, by reducing air intake, an increase of cylinder gas temperature was certainly expected and a continuous decline in emissions with increase of back pressure was obtained. Furthermore, the effect of a <b>by-pass</b> <b>valve,</b> installed between intercooler and intake manifold, on emission levels were investigated and optimized. Oxidation catalysts effects on regulated emissions, especially unburned fuel, carbon monoxide and unregulated emissions such as formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and acetic acid were investigated. In correlation with the back pressure regulator, a promoting faster catalyst Warm-up was achieved, and their conversion efficiencies were improved. In order to gain more extensive information to base specification of the engine emissions and catalyst selection, different test cycles such as European R 49 - 13 mode, steady state adoption of the Braunschweig cycle, 24 specific steps cycle, as well as conditioning, activating and transient cycles were used. As a result it has been found that the performance of ethanol engine version was mentained and the significant emissions, well below the goal, were achieve...|$|R
40|$|The {{adoption}} of two stage serial turbochargers {{in combination with}} internal combustion engines can improve the overall efficiency of powertrain systems. In conjunction {{with the increase of}} engine volumetric efficiency, two stage boosting technologies are capable of increasing torque and pedal response of small displacement engines. In two stage serial turbocharges, a high pressure (HP) and a low pressure (LP) turbocharger are connected by a series of ducts. The former can increase charge pressure for low air mass flow typical of low engine speed. The latter has a bigger size and can cooperate with higher mass flows. In serial configuration, turbochargers are packaged {{in a way that the}} exhaust gases access the LP turbine after exiting the HP turbine. On the induction side, fresh air is compressed sequentially by LP and HP compressors. <b>By-pass</b> <b>valves</b> and waste-gated turbines are often included in two stage boosting systems in order to regulate turbochargers operations. One-dimensional modelling approaches are considered for investigating the integration of boosting systems with internal combustion engines. In this scenario, turbocharger behaviour are input in the powertrain models through previously measured compressor and turbine maps in turbocharger gas stands. However, this procedure does not capture all the effects that occur on engine application such as heat transfer, friction and flow motion that influence the turbochargers operations. This is of particular importance for two stage serial turbochargers where the LP compressor may induce a swirling motion to the flow at the entry of the HP compressor. In addition, flow non-uniformities caused by bends between the two compressors can make the HP compressor perform differently. In this paper, a review of the available literature containing approaches to quantify the effects of heat transfer on turbocharger efficiency and the flow influence in the prediction of two stage serial turbochargers performance is explored...|$|R
40|$|Because of {{the high}} {{complexity}} of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell hybrid systems, a transient analysis is mandatory to implement a control system able to maintain safe operation during disturbances or regular operational load variations. In fact, several parameters, such as the turbine rotational speed, the surge margin, the temperatures within the fuel cell, the turbine inlet temperature, the differential pressure between the anodic and the cathodic side and the Steam-To-Carbon Ratio need to be monitored and kept within safe limits. On the other hand, the system response to load variations is required to be as quick as possible {{in order to meet}} the energy demand. To develop a control strategy for these cycles, the work starts from the implementation of a transient model necessary to simulate a hybrid system based on the tubular SOFC technology. In fact, the first goal of this work is the analysis of the response to a step decrease in the fuel mass flow rate of the uncontrolled system, focusing the attention on the time scales of the transient phenomena and discussing the results from electrochemical, fluid dynamic and thermal point of view. The simulation shows that while the cathodic side is driven only by the temperature variation, because of the rotational speed is assumed to be constant, the anodic side is characterized by three different time-scale phenomena. In fact, all the plant properties show a negligible fluid dynamic delay, a depressurization time delay and a thermal long time-scale effect mainly due to the high thermal inertia of the cell. The considerations, carried out with the uncontrolled system, are used in the second part of the work to develop a control strategy to follow the power demand over time avoiding malfunctions or risk situations. The paper focuses the attention on a detailed presentation of the control system layout based on the <b>by-pass</b> <b>valve</b> between the compressor outlet and the turbine inlet, necessary to overcome the difficulty due to the difference between the small mechanical inertia of the microturbine shaft and the very high thermal inertia of the fuel cell stack. The simulations, carried out with a load step decrease, show the transient behaviour of the controlled SOFC hybrid system, presenting, over time, the values of the main critical parameters. Finally, the paper presents the results obtained with a power step increase to investigate the limitations of this control strategy focusing the attention on the fuel cell average temperature and the fuel utilization factor...|$|R

An effective method to reduce the noise that does not impair the system performance and efficiency is needed. This article reports on initial investigations of an active valve for pressure pulsation attenuation in switched inertance hydraulic systems (SIHS) based on in-series and by-pass structures. The in-series structure represents a valve arranged in line between the SIHS and the load providing a controlled pulsating pressure drop, whilst for the <b>by-pass</b> structure the <b>valve</b> was arranged in parallel with the load providing a controlled pulsating bleed-off flow.
