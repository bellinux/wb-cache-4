50|$|<b>Synchro</b> <b>transmitters</b> {{can also}} feed synchro to digital converters, which provide a digital {{representation}} of the shaft angle.|$|R
50|$|<b>Synchro</b> <b>transmitters</b> are as described, but 50 and 60-Hz synchro {{receivers}} require rotary dampers to {{keep their}} shafts from oscillating when not loaded (as with dials) or lightly loaded in high-accuracy applications.|$|R
50|$|Differential synchros {{are another}} category. They have three-lead rotors and stators like the stator {{described}} above, {{and can be}} transmitters or receivers. A differential transmitter is connected between a <b>synchro</b> <b>transmitter</b> and a receiver, and its shaft's position adds to (or subtracts from, depending upon definition) the angle defined by the transmitter. A differential receiver is connected between two transmitters, and shows the sum (or difference, again as defined) between the shaft positions of the two transmitters. There are synchro-like devices called transolvers, somewhat like differential synchros, but with three-lead rotors and four-lead stators.|$|R
50|$|On a {{practical}} level, synchros resemble motors, {{in that there}} is a rotor, stator, and a shaft. Ordinarily, slip rings and brushes connect the rotor to external power. A <b>synchro</b> <b>transmitter's</b> shaft is rotated by the mechanism that sends information, while the synchro receiver's shaft rotates a dial, or operates a light mechanical load. Single and three-phase units are common in use, and will follow the other's rotation when connected properly. One transmitter can turn several receivers; if torque is a factor, the transmitter must be physically larger to source the additional current. In a motion picture interlock system, a large motor-driven distributor can drive as many as 20 machines, sound dubbers, footage counters, and projectors.|$|R
50|$|The forward Mk 38 Director (pictured) was {{situated}} {{on top of}} the fire control tower. The director was equipped with optical sights, optical Mark 45 Rangefinder (the long thin boxes sticking out of each side), and a Mark 13 Fire Control Radar antenna (the rectangular shape sitting on top). The purpose of the director was to track the target's present bearing and range. This could be done optically by the men inside using the sights and Rangefinder, or electronically with the radar. (The FC radar was the preferred method.) The present position of the target was called the Line-Of-Sight (LOS), and it was continuously sent down to the Mk 8 Rangekeeper in the plotting room by <b>Synchro</b> <b>transmitters.</b> Also, when not using the radar's display to determine Spots, the director was the optical spotting station.|$|R
50|$|Single phase {{units have}} five wires: two for an exciter winding (typically line voltage) and three for the output/input. These three are bussed {{to the other}} synchros in the system, and provide the power and {{information}} to align the shafts of all the receivers. <b>Synchro</b> <b>transmitters</b> and receivers must be powered by the same branch circuit, so to speak; the mains excitation voltage sources must match in voltage and phase. The safest approach is to bus the five or six lines from transmitters and receivers at a common point. Different makes of selsyns, used in interlock systems, have different output voltages. In all cases, three-phase systems will handle more power and operate a bit more smoothly. The excitation is often 208/240 V 3-phase mains power. Many synchros operate on 30 to 60 V AC also.|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} cockpit mounted head-up type {{display system}} {{was developed and}} evaluated by LaRC pilots during the landing phase of light aircraft operations. The Landing Site Indicator (LASI) system display consists of angle of attack, angle of sideslip, and indicated airspeed images superimposed on the pilot's view through the windshield. The information is made visible to the pilot {{by means of a}} partially reflective viewing screen which is suspended directly in frot of the pilot's eyes. <b>Synchro</b> <b>transmitters</b> are operated by vanes, located at the left wing tip, which sense angle of attack and sideslip angle. Information is presented {{near the center of the}} display in the form of a moving index on a fixed grid. The airspeed is sensed by a pitot-static pressure transducer and is presented in numerical form at the top center of the display...|$|R
5000|$|A synchro is, in effect, a {{transformer}} whose primary-to-secondary coupling may be varied by physically changing the relative {{orientation of the}} two windings. Synchros are often used for measuring the angle of a rotating machine such as an antenna platform. In its general physical construction, it is much like an electric motor. The primary winding of the transformer, fixed to the rotor, is excited by an alternating current, which by electromagnetic induction, causes currents to flow in three Y-connected secondary windings fixed at 120 degrees {{to each other on}} the stator. The relative magnitudes of secondary currents are measured and used to determine the angle of the rotor relative to the stator, or the currents can be used to directly drive a receiver synchro that will rotate in unison with the <b>synchro</b> <b>transmitter.</b> In the latter case, the whole device may be called a selsyn (a portmanteau of self and synchronizing).|$|R
