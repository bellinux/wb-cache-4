50|$|The {{next stage}} in his {{business}} career was {{the purchase of the}} Chester-road Mills, from the Manchester silk firm of Taylor, Harrop, and Pearce and the construction of a large shed to house power looms.During this period Mr. Birchenough also had a silk <b>throwster</b> business in partnership with Joseph Arnold, which they carried out at the Prestbury road mills. After his partner’s death Birchenough kept the business.|$|E
50|$|Apprenticed to a Spitalfields silk weaver in 1775, George Courtauld first {{worked on}} his own as silk <b>throwster.</b> Between 1785 and 1794 he {{made a number of}} visits to America. In 1794 he {{established}} his own textile business at Pebmarsh under the name George Courtald & Co. However by 1816 the business was in financial difficulty: that year George's son Samuel took over the business and built it into one of the largest textile businesses in the United Kingdom.|$|E
50|$|He was {{a cousin}} of sailor and writer Robert Knox. Born in Houndsditch, London, {{he was the son}} of John Strype, or van Stryp, a member of a Huguenot family who, in order to escape {{religious}} persecution within Brabant, had settled in East London. Located in what has now become known as Strype Street in Petticoat Lane, he was a merchant and silk <b>throwster.</b> The younger John was educated at St Paul's School, and on 5 July 1662 entered Jesus College, Cambridge; he went on from there to Catharine Hall, where he graduated B.A. in 1665 and M.A. in 1669.|$|E
50|$|Crimplene is a texturised {{continuous}} fibre produced by modifying Terylene. The patent {{was taken out}} by Mario Nava of Chesline and Crepes Ltd of Macclesfield, and sold to ICI Fibres. ICI licensed the product to various <b>throwsters.</b> The largest producer by far was William Tatton of Leek, and the Golbourne factory was at one time capable of taking the entire output of ICI's Wilton production of Terylene.|$|R
50|$|Some buttons were traded by chapmen, {{but others}} were sent via Manchester and {{exported}} through Bristol and London to the Netherlands, New York and Moscow. John Brocḱlehurst {{was such a}} chapman and he enter partnership in 1745 with Messrs Acton and Street who were 'putters out'. Charles Roe was a silk button merchant. Woven silk {{was obtained from the}} Huguenots in Spitalfield, who in turn used the yarn supplied by the silk <b>throwsters</b> in small shades or throwing houses in Macclesfield.|$|R
50|$|The {{union was}} founded in 1919 with the merger of six local unions, all based in north Staffordshire or {{southern}} Cheshire: the Amalgamated Society of Silk Pickers, Amalgamated Society of Braid Workers and Kindred Trades, Amalgamated Society of Silk and Cotton Dyers, Amalgamated Society of Women Workers, Amalgamated Society of Silk Spinners, <b>Throwsters</b> and Reelers, and the Leek Spun Silk Dressers Union. Several of the unions were led by William Bromfield, and {{he became the first}} secretary of the new union, serving until 1942.|$|R
50|$|Mary Ann {{was born}} on 14 December 1753 at Spital (then Spittal) Square, London, the {{youngest}} child of James Maze (d. 1794), a prosperous Huguenot (i.e. French Protestant) silk <b>throwster</b> and merchant. She was bilingual and said to be very intelligent. Her childhood friends were the siblings Dorothy (1755-1836) and Thomas Kilner (1750-1812). The two girls wrote to one another constantly during their childhood and teenage years. On 18 September 1774 Mary Ann married Thomas and moved to her husband's home at 33 Spital Square. They had five children, of whom Eliza (b. 1776), Frances (b. 1783) and George (born 1791) survived.|$|E
50|$|Communications from David Erskine Baker {{were printed}} in the Philosophical Transactions, but he married the actress Elizabeth Clendon on 6 August 1752, and joined a company of actors. In 1764 he {{published}} his Companion to the Play House. A revised edition, under the title of Biographia Dramatica, appeared in 1782, edited by Isaac Reed. In the second edition, Baker's name is given among the list of dramatic authors, and {{we are told that}} 'being adopted by an uncle who was a silk <b>throwster</b> in Spital Fields, he succeeded him in his business; but wanting the prudence and attention which are necessary to secure success in trade he soon failed'. In compiling his Companion Baker was largely indebted to Gerard Langbaine. He adds little concerning the early dramatists. but his work is useful for the history of the stage {{during the first half of}} the eighteenth century.|$|E
40|$|A new {{apparatus}} {{for measuring}} critical disolution time of 10 samples simultaneouslly, is described. The results are registered throught a printer. The {{factors that can}} influence on the precision of the results and their reproducibility and analysed, giving solutions for each case. An operating process for handling this new apparatus is described. It offers great opportunities in the measurements of critical disolution time techniques, for research, quality control of synthetic fibres production (production line and type of product), intermediate stages of production, finisher product, <b>throwsters</b> and textile testing laboratories...|$|R
50|$|In 1700, the Italians {{were the}} most technologically {{advanced}} <b>throwsters</b> in Europe and had developed two machines capable of winding the silk onto bobbins while putting a twist in the thread. They called the throwing machine, a filatoio, and called the doubler, a torcitoio. There is an illustration of a circular hand-powered throwing machine drawn in 1487 with 32 spindles. The first evidence of an externally powered filatoio comes from the thirteenth century, and the earliest illustration from around 1500. Filatorios and torcitoios contained parallel circular frames that revolved round each other on a central axis. The speed of the relative rotation determined the twist. Silk would only cooperate in the process if the temperature and humidity were high.|$|R

50|$|The {{years between}} 1815 and 1820 were ones of recession, {{followed}} by the boom of the 1820s. Twenty six throwing mills were established, and the <b>throwsters</b> often attached weaving sheds. The workforce was divided equally between the employed and outworkers and weaving was all done by hand. In 1821 the population was 21,819, and about 10,000 were employed in the silk factories- some of course would {{come in from the}} surrounding villages. They worked a 62-hour week, men earning eleven shillings. Duties on finished silk and raw silk were reduced in 1824, 1825 and 1826. Firms went bankrupt and while there were 70 silk mills in 1826 by 1832 there were only 41. Wages halved, and workers were put on short time. Recessions continued on a ten yearly cycle and as fewer firms survived, the techniques were refined, new products were produced, and management became more adept. Brocklehursts was the largest of these firms.|$|R
5000|$|The fibres {{are then}} unwound {{to produce a}} {{continuous}} thread. Since a single thread is too fine and fragile for commercial use, anywhere from three to ten strands are spun {{together to form a}} single thread of silk.Colloquially silk throwing can be used to refer to the whole process: reeling, throwing and doubling, and silk <b>throwsters</b> would speak of throwing as twisting or spinning. Silk throwing was originally a hand process relying on a turning a wheel (the gate) that twisted four threads while a helper who would be a child, ran the length of a shade, hooked the threads on stationary pins (the cross)and ran back to start the process again. The shade would be a between 23 and 32m long. The process was described in detail to Lord Shaftesbury's Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Employment of Children in 1841:For twisting it is necessary to have what are designated shades which are buildings of at least 30 or 35 yards in length, ... the upper storey is generally occupied by children, ... or grown women as 'piecers', 'winders' and 'doublers' attending to their reels and bobbins is, driven by the exertions of one man... He (the boy) takes first a rod containing four bobbins of silk from the twister who stands at his gate or wheel, and having fastened the ends, runs to the 'cross' at the extreme end of the room, round which he passes the threads of each bobbin and returns to the 'gate'. He is despatched on a second expedition of the same kind, and returns as before, he then runs up to the cross and detaches the threads and comes to the roller. Supposing the master to make twelve rolls a day, the boy necessarily runs fourteen miles, and this is barefooted.|$|R
40|$|The study assesses how {{the county}} of Hertfordshire along the Grand Junction Canal {{developed}} economically and socially between 1790 and 1840. It considers {{the impact of the}} canal upon the various industries of the region, and shows that it was rather greater than has been presented by previous writers. Some paper makers in the west of the county started to use the canal {{as soon as it was}} available, and paper went on to become a significant industry: but the silk and cotton <b>throwsters</b> and the brewers used it to a much smaller effect. Agriculture, although really needing a different, less linear, form of transport, was able to take some advantage of the canal to take hay and wheat to London and bring back ???manures??? for the soil: but the benefit to farmers was limited. The parishes through which the canal passed were affected in one of two ways. The towns, especially those close to the line of the canal, had an influx of materials and goods through their wharfs as well as the development of some industry. The villages, with nothing round industry could coalesce, gained very little. Population growth, always slow, hardly changed, and the small towns remained so. The pre-existing turnpike which paralleled the canal for most of its course through Hertfordshire saw some loss of tolls, and remained a local rather than a trunk route. This dissertation concludes that the population of western Hertfordshire was not big enough to sustain true industry, and did not generate enough employment to alter the strongly agrarian nature of the area. The towns changed under the influence of the canal, and those who could afford to buy goods had the chance to do so, but the labouring poor could not. The Grand Junction Canal allowed some industry to develop in the area and so paved the way for the railway, but cannot be said to have made a fundamental difference to western Hertfordshire through which it passed...|$|R
5000|$|The skeins {{were placed}} into bales {{and taken to}} the mill for processing. Three sorts of yarn were {{commonly}} produced: no-twist which was suitable for weft, tram that had received a slight twist {{making it easier to}} handle, and organizine which had a greater twist and was suitable for use as warp. [...] Reeling is the process where the silk that has been wound into skeins, is cleaned, receives a twist and is wound onto bobbins. Silk throwing is the process where the filament from the bobbins is given its full twist. The process where filaments or threads from three or more bobbins are wound together is called doubling.The last two processes can occur more than once and in any order. Tram was wound, thrown and doubled, organzine was wound, doubled then thrown and doubled again. Sewing silk could receive further doubling and throwing. No-twist was often three single filaments doubled together. Many other combinations were possible. Colloquially silk throwing can be used to refer to the whole process: reeling, throwing and doubling, and silk <b>throwsters</b> would speak of throwing as twisting or spinning.
