50|$|The present name of <b>the</b> <b>alley</b> first {{appears in}} {{historical}} records in 1440 as stenbadzstufwo grændinne, thus {{referring to the}} city's stone sauna located in <b>the</b> <b>alley.</b> As early as 1515, however, <b>the</b> <b>alley</b> is called Wruaders gränd in references to Nils Månsson Urväder who bought a brewery in <b>the</b> <b>alley</b> in 1485. <b>The</b> latter name was the one used until 1925, when <b>the</b> <b>alley</b> was given back its old name {{in order to avoid}} confusion with the street on Södermalm also called Urvädergränd. <b>The</b> <b>alley</b> used to stretch through the present block all the way to Myntgatan on the opposite side. In connection to the enlargement of Kanslihuset ("The Chancellery House") during World War II, which resulted in Kanslihusannexet ("The Chancellery Annex") and its circular courtyard (Brantingtorget), <b>the</b> <b>alley</b> was transformed into the short tunnel it is today.|$|R

25|$|Some houses had {{outbuildings}} {{which are}} also included as contributing properties. Most are stables or carriage houses later converted to garages. These were usually utilitarian gabled sheds with a bay for a single horse and wagon (the exception being those that served the upscale homes of Franklin Square). A few later ones were built for automobiles. Their main impact on the district {{was the creation of}} <b>the</b> <b>alleys</b> in mid-block, later expanded into streets in their own right.|$|E
25|$|In Worcester {{skittles}} all pins {{are live}} until they {{land in the}} pit behind the diamond, or leave the alley on an open side. They can rebound off a side wall back into the diamond taking down other pin(s). In some alleys, such as the Saracens Head in Worcester, the Diamond is flanked by two side walls making {{the possibility of a}} spare, achieved by bouncing pins off the wall more of a possibility. It is more than common to hear the cries of 'let it roll' go out in <b>the</b> <b>alleys</b> of the city to stop an over enthusiastic 'sticker up' (a young lad or girl employed to put the pins back up after they have been knocked down) removing a pin from the alley before it has finished knocking down the others. However, if a ball hits the cush, or wall or passes through the diamond and bounces back out of the pit before felling pins the frame must be reset.|$|E
25|$|Sometime in {{the first}} century AD the {{settlement}} was occupied by Roman settlers. Expansion of the Roman Empire into the region has left evidence in the oppidum at Briteiros, in the form of coins (those of Augustus and Tiberius are the most numerous found, with smaller numbers of coins of the Republic, and the Flavians and the Antonines) ranging from the 1st century BCE to the 2nd century CE. A small number of amphorae and red pottery pieces have been found, and there is some evidence of Romanization in the architecture of <b>the</b> <b>alleys</b> and buildings of the eastern slope, but overall the visible impact of Roman occupiers is not strong. The reduced number of later coin and pottery finds suggests that occupation of the oppidum was declining from the 1st century CE, resulting in the 2nd century with very few people living within the ramparts. Evidence shows that there was a transitory reoccupation in the High Middle Ages, which included the building of a medieval chapel and graveyard on the acropolis.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Alley</b> Theatre {{is one of}} {{the three}} oldest {{resident}} theatres in the United States.Under the leadership of Nina Eloise Whittington Vance (1914-1980), <b>the</b> <b>Alley</b> Theatre first started in a “former dance studio with an opening on Main Street. A brick corridor led from Main {{to the back of the}} studio, hence <b>the</b> name <b>Alley</b> Theatre.” In 1948, early paying members scouted Houston for a new location for <b>the</b> <b>Alley,</b> finally landing on an abandoned fan factory on Berry Avenue. <b>The</b> <b>Alley</b> re-opened on February 8, 1949, with a production of Lillian Helman’s The Children’s Hour. In 1954, Ms. Vance brought in Albert Dekker to ‘guest-star’ in Death of a Salesman. <b>The</b> <b>Alley</b> then became a fully professional/Equity company.|$|R

5000|$|The street {{appears in}} {{historical}} records in 1666 as Funckens grendh, {{named after the}} burgher Tomas Funck (1580-1645) who moved to Stockholm from Stralsund. The Funck family owned several properties in <b>the</b> <b>alley,</b> except for <b>the</b> so-called Funck House (Funckska huset) on 53, Kornhamnstorg, also one {{on the opposite side}} of <b>the</b> <b>alley.</b> [...] As <b>the</b> daughter-in-law of Tomas Funck, Elisabet Hansdotter, bought other neighbouring properties in 1680 and 1698, most of <b>the</b> <b>alley</b> belonged to <b>the</b> family, and as <b>the</b> <b>alley's</b> earlier name Bredgränd (17th century) was used for other streets, the family therefore gave its name to <b>the</b> <b>alley.</b> In <b>the</b> middle of 16th century it was named Stråbucksgränd or Henrik Stråbucks gränd.|$|R

The force of 1,000 troops also included Shayetet 13 and Duvdevan Unit special forces, the Armoured Corps, and Combat Engineers with armored bulldozer for neutralizing the roadside bombs that would line <b>the</b> <b>alleys</b> of the camp according to Military Intelligence. Anticipating the heaviest resistance in Nablus, IDF commanders sent two regular infantry brigades there, assuming they could take over the Jenin camp in 48–72 hours with just the one reservist brigade. The force's entry was delayed until April 2 due to rain. The 5th Infantry Brigade did not have any experience in close quarters combat and did not have a commander when Operation Defensive Shield started, since the last commander's service ended a few days earlier. His substitute was a reserve officer, Lieutenant Colonel Yehuda Yedidia, who got his rank after the operation began. His soldiers were not trained for urban fighting.|$|E

50|$|The part of <b>the</b> <b>alley</b> east of Själagårdsgatan appears under {{different}} names reflecting the various activities dominating it: In 1557, {{it is called}} Tynnebindare gaten referring to a hooper (e.g. maker of barrels) Peder Tunnbindare ("Peter Barrel-binder") known to have lived here in 1538. Located {{on the north side}} of <b>the</b> <b>alley</b> was, however, <b>the</b> potent Vårfrugillet av den tyska nationen ("Our Lady's guild of the German Nation"), which gave <b>the</b> <b>alley</b> <b>the</b> name Gillestugegaten ("Guild's Cottage's Street") in 1579. During the 18th century, <b>the</b> <b>alley</b> is also referred to as Persiljegränd ("Parsley Alley"), possibly a corruption (jocular or not) of the name of the extended block east of <b>the</b> <b>alley,</b> Perseus.

500|$|The {{uncertainty}} {{over the future}} of the North Circular Road has blighted properties on and near it, particularly around Bounds Green. Around 1972, approximately 400 homes on the road were compulsory purchased by the Greater London Council in conjunction with widening schemes that were then cancelled. The properties have suffered from a lack of long-term care. [...] Since TfL took responsibility for the road, land for future schemes has been left dormant, resulting in urban decay with derelict properties. Compulsory purchased properties were let out to various short-term tenants, which led to them housing prostitutes and migrant workers living in increasing squalor. Pedestrians have become too frightened to use underpasses along the road, particularly to access North Middlesex Hospital. Areas close to the road, such as <b>the</b> <b>alleys</b> behind properties on the Telford Road section, have suffered from fly tipping and anti-social behaviour.|$|E
500|$|By 1660, {{like her}} fellow Londoner Damaris Page, Mother Cresswell was {{regarded}} as one of the great figures of the London scene, with a talent for self-promotion. She declared she had [...] "Beauties of all Complexions, from the cole-black clyng-fast to the golden lock'd insatiate, from the sleepy ey'd Slug to the lewd Fricatrix". She had a network of agents across the country who found her pretty young girls. Among her brothels, she owned one in Lincoln's Inn Fields by Whetstone Park where she sold [...] "strong waters and fresh-faced wenches to all who had guineas to buy them with." [...] Her headquarters were in a brothel on Back Alley off Moor Lane, near Cripplegate, where Moorgate station stands today. She also ran an office in Millbank to organise whores for local noblemen and owned both a mansion in Clerkenwell and a [...] "House of Assignation" [...] where women old and young could discreetly meet their lovers. She took on a cohort of Cavalier gentlewomen from formerly high circles of society who had supported the parliamentarian uprising, their standing destroyed by the civil war. This network of women worked <b>the</b> <b>alleys</b> close to the Gresham Royal Exchange in the city, and so were known as the [...] "Countesses of the Exchange" [...] or [...] "side-pillows".|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>alley</b> {{was known}} as Doktor Belows gränd during {{the end of the}} 17th century, {{probably}} in reference to a major proprietor in the block constantly disputing the use of <b>the</b> <b>alley</b> with his neighbours. It is most likely <b>the</b> <b>alley</b> named Herr Henning Pinnows gränd ("Alley of Mr. Henning Pinnow") and Herr Måns Erikssons gränd ("Alley of Mr. Måns Eriksson") in the 15th century, the former known to have sold a house to the latter in 1472. In 1513, <b>the</b> <b>alley</b> was then named after Gunilla Johansdotter Bese (1473-1553), wife of Erik Turesson Bielke (-1511) and mother to the grandfather of Queen Gunilla Bielke (1568-1597), and in 1674 <b>the</b> <b>alley</b> was even referred to as Sancta Gunillas gränd ("Alley of St Gunilla").|$|R

500|$|The drug {{addiction}} of Towelie, {{a living and}} talking towel, is growing so overwhelming that the South Park boys make attempts to help him. Towelie's history is shown, using head interviews and on-screen captions (in a parody of Intervention), starting with years of {{drug addiction}} to cannabis, crystal meth, heroin and crack. He previously had a girlfriend named Rebecca and conceived a child with her (a washcloth), but he {{was kicked out of}} their home due to his persistently getting high. Having run out of money for hard drugs, Towelie starts getting high off of cans of computer duster. His life continued in a downward spiral, leaving him in heavy debt and offering oral sex to strangers for money in <b>the</b> <b>alleys.</b> The boys help him get a job at Lake Tardicaca, a summer camp for kids with physical and mental disabilities, as a towel to dry off the campers. However, Towelie persists in drug use and fellating strangers in the supply closet, and is fired by the camp. The boys confront Towelie and make emotional speeches to him as a plea to help him from killing himself (except for Cartman, who uses this opportunity to read what appears to be several tens of thousands of pages of anti-Semitic remarks on television, which the psychiatrist allows to continue in respect of the [...] "no interruptions" [...] rule). Towelie refuses their pleas until Butters reveals he has brought Towelie's child, [...] "Washcloth", which finally prompts him to accept the offer to go to a rehabilitation clinic in Southern California. Later, Towelie reveals he has completed rehab and is now living with his girlfriend and son.|$|E
