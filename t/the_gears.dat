5|$|The {{disadvantages}} of the turbine were eventually overcome. The solution which eventually was generally adopted was the geared turbine, where gearing reduced the rotation {{rate of the}} propellers and hence increased efficiency.

5|$|The story {{picks up}} {{approximately}} {{two weeks after}} the events of Guilty Gear X. In the time following Dizzy's disappearance, the mysterious Post-War Administration Bureau begins secretly investigating <b>the</b> <b>Gears</b> and fighters from previous tournaments for their own needs and ambitions. To achieve their goals the organization has created several mechanical copies of Ky Kiske, the “Robo-Kys”. In addition, fighters find themselves in a reality beyond their control, most notably in the manipulative hands of the villainess I-No, who is revealed to be a servant of “That Man”, the creator of <b>the</b> <b>Gears.</b> Each character provides a different ending to Guilty Gear X2.|$|E

50|$|September 21, 1992 KORL, CESSNA 210L, N2013S, Injuries: 1 Uninjured: Pilot {{stated that}} while {{attempting}} to extend <b>the</b> landing <b>gear</b> <b>the</b> <b>gear</b> hydraulic motor operated but <b>the</b> <b>gear</b> did not extend. After several seconds of <b>gear</b> motor operation <b>the</b> circuit breaker for <b>the</b> <b>gear</b> motor popped. Further attempts to extend <b>the</b> <b>gear</b> by normal and emergency procedures were unsuccessful. A gear up landing was made. After the accident the aircraft was raised and <b>the</b> landing <b>gear</b> was extended by use of <b>the</b> manual <b>gear</b> extension emergency hydraulic pump. According to maintenance personnel a wire to <b>the</b> nose landing <b>gear</b> squat switch was chafed and grounded which caused the system to be signaled for gear up at all times. They further stated the pilot could not extend <b>the</b> <b>gear</b> by use of the backup hydraulic pump because <b>the</b> <b>gear</b> down solenoid had overheated during attempts to lower <b>the</b> <b>gear</b> and froze in <b>the</b> <b>gear</b> up position. After the solenoid cooled after landing {{they were able to}} manually lower <b>the</b> <b>gear.</b> Probable cause(s): Undetected chafing and grounding of a wire to <b>the</b> nose landing <b>gear</b> squat switch which resulted in <b>the</b> landing <b>gear</b> being signaled at all times for gear up when electrical power was applied to the system. Contributing to the accident was the overheating of <b>the</b> <b>gear</b> down solenoid which caused it to stick in <b>the</b> <b>gear</b> up position and prevented <b>the</b> <b>gear</b> from being manually extended.|$|R
50|$|This {{shows that}} if <b>the</b> output <b>gear</b> GB has more teeth than <b>the</b> input <b>gear</b> GA, then <b>the</b> <b>gear</b> train amplifies <b>the</b> input torque.

50|$|<b>The</b> input <b>gear</b> in this {{gear train}} has 13 teeth and <b>the</b> idler <b>gear</b> has 21 teeth. Considering only these <b>gears,</b> <b>the</b> <b>gear</b> ratio between <b>the</b> idler and <b>the</b> input <b>gear</b> can be {{calculated}} as if <b>the</b> idler <b>gear</b> was <b>the</b> output <b>gear.</b> Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>gear</b> ratio is driven/drive = 21/13 ≈1.62 or 1.62:1.|$|R

The game was released in North America, Europe and Australia on November 7, 2008 and was released in Japan on July 30, 2009. The game expands technically on the previous game by using a modified Unreal Engine 3 engine. The development team brought in comic book writer Joshua Ortega to help write the plot for the game.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Gear</b> Master was an {{accessory}} for <b>the</b> Sega Game <b>Gear</b> handheld game console.

40|$|Abstract. <b>The</b> <b>gear</b> {{processing}} {{technology can}} be analyzed by testing <b>the</b> <b>gear</b> noise. For this purpose, a set of gear noise test system was developed. A DSP hardware system was designed to test and analyze <b>the</b> <b>gear</b> noise. <b>The</b> signals were transferred to the PC through the USB module for further comparative analysis. <b>The</b> <b>gear</b> noise signal spectrum analysis {{was carried out in}} the PC signal processing software. The experimental results show that the system can accurately acquire and process <b>the</b> <b>gear</b> noise signals, and {{it can be used to}} analyze <b>the</b> <b>gear</b> processing...|$|R
50|$|Similarly, {{since the}} Shuttle landed {{at high speed}} and could not abort its landing attempt, <b>the</b> <b>gear</b> had to deploy {{reliably}} {{on the first try}} every time. <b>The</b> <b>gear</b> were unlocked and deployed by triple redundant hydraulics, with <b>the</b> <b>gear</b> doors actuated by mechanical linkages to <b>the</b> <b>gear</b> strut. If all three hydraulic systems failed to release <b>the</b> landing <b>gear</b> uplocks within one second of the release command, pyrotechnic charges automatically cut the lock hooks and a set of springs deployed <b>the</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|R
5|$|On January 21, 1813, eight city commissioners visited Redheffer {{to inspect}} the machine. They had to do so through a barred window, as Redheffer was {{concerned}} anyone going near the machine might damage it. One of the inspectors, Nathan Sellers, was accompanied by his son Coleman, who noticed something odd about <b>the</b> <b>gears.</b> The machine itself {{was said to be}} powering a separate device through a series of gears and weights. Coleman noticed that the cogs were worn on the wrong side and suggested that the device was in fact powering the machine.|$|E
5|$|With {{the fuel}} price {{increases}} of the 2000s, the EPA and many companies {{have sought to}} increase diesel truck fuel economy. One such example is the hydraulic hybrid vehicle, which stores energy in hydraulic tanks and hydraulic motors (as opposed to the electric hybrid vehicle which uses batteries and regenerative brakes). Electric hybrid vehicles are another option, with savings of 35 to 60 percent over traditional vehicles. Drivers themselves may improve fuel efficiency by using a method called progressive shifting, in which the driver shifts through <b>the</b> <b>gears</b> (typical trucks may have between 10 and 18 gears) {{in such a manner}} as to optimize the power range of the engine.|$|E

Abandoning his crew, Big Boy flees to a drawbridge and ties Tess to <b>the</b> <b>gears</b> before he is confronted by Tracy. Their fight is halted when the Blank appears and holds both men at gunpoint, offering to share the city with Tracy after Big Boy is dead. Big Boy takes advantage of a distraction and opens fire before Tracy sends him falling to his death in the bridge gears. Mortally wounded, the Blank is revealed to be Breathless Mahoney, who kisses Tracy before dying. All charges against Tracy are dropped.|$|E

5|$|The 37mm M5 gun had a {{manually}} operated breechblock. The tank commander doubled as loader, {{like many other}} tanks of the time. There was no turret basket in the M2A4 light tank; the commander stood on the right side, while the gunner stood on the left side. The commander turned the turret onto {{the general direction of}} target. The gunner would then bring the target into the M5 telescopic sight. The M20 combination mount had 20° of traverse; this could either be by a handwheel driving the rack and pinion traverse gear mechanism or pressure on the gunners shoulder rest overcoming the friction in the mechanism. Depression and elevation of the gun was either through a geared mechanism or, with <b>the</b> <b>gears</b> disengaged, free through movement of the gunner's shoulder rest.|$|E
5|$|The work {{performed}} by breaker boys was hazardous. Breaker boys {{were forced to}} work without gloves {{so that they could}} better handle the slick coal. The slate, however, was sharp, and breaker boys would often leave work with their fingers cut and bleeding. Breaker boys sometimes also had their fingers amputated by the rapidly moving conveyor belts. Others lost feet, hands, arms, and legs as they moved among the machinery and became caught under conveyor belts or in gears. Many were crushed to death, their bodies retrieved from <b>the</b> <b>gears</b> of the machinery by supervisors only {{at the end of the}} working day. Others were caught in the rush of coal, and crushed to death or smothered. Dry coal would kick up so much dust that breaker boys sometimes wore lamps on their heads to see, and asthma and black lung disease were common. Coal was often washed to remove impurities, which created sulfuric acid. The acid burned the hands of the breaker boys.|$|E

25|$|In 1813, William Hedley and Timothy Hackworth {{designed}} a locomotive (Puffing Billy) {{for use on}} the tramway between Stockton and Darlington. Puffing Billy featured piston rods extending upwards to pivoting beams, connected in turn by rods to a crankshaft beneath the frames which, in turn, drove <b>the</b> <b>gears</b> attached to the wheels. This meant that the wheels were coupled, allowing better traction. A year later, George Stephenson improved on that design with his first locomotive Blücher, {{which was the first}} locomotive to use single-flanged wheels.|$|E
