And the final suggestion is that the most practical and effective means of bringing about dialogue and understanding is to be bilateral education, in which both military and civilian elites would jointly attend specialized schools. Such schooling would emphasize military-strategic thinking, American history and political philosophy, military ethics, and the proper relationship between civil and military authority.|$|E

Some federal agencies also refer to MD&A as the “overview. ” The basic concept that underlies the standards for MD&A is: Each general purpose federal financial report (GPFFR) should include a section devoted to management’s discussion and analysis (MD&A). It should address the reporting entity’s performance measures, financial statements, systems and controls, compliance with laws and regulations, and actions taken or planned to address problems. The discussion and analysis of these subjects may be based partly on information contained in reports other than the GPFFR. MD&A also should address significant events, conditions, trends and contingencies that may affect future operations.

To achieve the objectives, the distribution of live load and dynamic impact effects for different types of farm vehicles on three general bridge types—steel-concrete, steel-timber, and timber-timber—were investigated through load testing and analytical modeling. The types of vehicles studied included, but were not limited to, grain wagons/grain carts, manure tank wagons, agriculture fertilizer applicators, and tractors. Once the effects of these vehicles had been determined, a parametric study was carried out to develop live load distribution factor (LLDF) equations that account for the effect of husbandry vehicle loads. Similarly, recommendations for dynamic effects were also developed. The live load distribution factors and dynamic load allowances are covered in the first volume of the report. Finally, suggestions on the analysis, rating, and posting of bridges for husbandry implements were developed. <b>Those</b> <b>suggestions</b> <b>are</b> covered in the second volume of the report.

THESIS. The 1 stConsultant: Dr. Ngadiso, M. Pd.;The 2 nd Consultant: 2 : Dr. Abdul Asib, M. Pd. Program Study English Education Department of Graduate School of SebelasMaret University. The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to reveal whether: (1) Problem Based Learning technique ismore effective than Discussion technique to teach speaking; (2) The students having high self-actualization have better speaking skill than those having low self-actualization; and (3) There is an interaction between teaching techniques and students’ self-actualization in teaching speaking. This research applied an experimental study. The research was done in Universitas Islam Kadiri (UNISKA) Kediri. The population was the second semester students in the academic year of 2014 / 2015 totally consisting of 80 students. The sampling used was cluster random sampling. The samples were 40 students where 20 students were in the experimental class (2. B 1) and 20 students were in the control class (2. B 2). Students in each class were categorized into two groups: students having high and low self-actualization. The instruments used were self-actualization questionnaire and speaking test which were designed by the researcher. Before being applied, those instruments had been tried out to know the readability of the test instruction, the validity and reliability of selfactualization questionnaire. The data obtained were analyzed using ANOVA 2 x 2 and continued by using TUKEY test. The result of data analysis shows that: (1) Problem Based Learning technique is more effective than Discussion technique to teach speaking; (2) The students having high self-actualization have better speaking skill than those having low self-actualization; and (3) There is an interaction between teaching techniques and students’ self-actualization in teaching speaking.

40|$|Located {{just south}} of Downtown Albuquerque, New Mexico, the {{historic}} community of Barelas is a revered place of culture, tradition, and identity, described as a one-of-a-kind Heart of Aztlan, by authors like Rodolfo Anaya. Throughout its history, the neighborhood has undergone significant periods of development, investment, disinvestment, distress, revitalization, strengthening and uncertainty. Though one of Albuquerque’s poorest neighborhoods in average income, Baraleños love the neighborhood’s many long-time families, vibrant cultural festivities like the Christmas Posadas, and places of the heart. Those places include the Barelas Community Center with its murals, the Barelas Senior Center and its weekly dances, 4 th Street and its many small local businesses, the Barelas Coffee House as a regional attraction, Sacred Heart Church and its annual fiestas, the formerly vacant and now revived Coronado Elementary, and the National Hispanic Cultural Center with its aim of celebrating and preserving the area’s culture. The neighborhood {{has a long history}} of community activism and many of the positive results of that mobilization remain today. The development of the Barelas Community Center, for example, resulted from organizing among Barelas residents, the League of United Latin American Citizens and the National Youth Administration Center during the 1940 s. Many streetscape improvements and business façade improvements were made possible by local business organizations during the 1990 s. During the first decade of the millennium, the neighborhood has also played successful defense against blights on the neighborhood, including a fight to close the former A&P Bar on 3 rd Street and an effort to prevent the gas station at 8 th and Avenida Cesar Chavez from expanding its liquor sales. In 2010, the neighborhood successfully achieved the removal of a long-abandoned and dilapidated apartment complex at 7 th and Iron that had served as a magnet for criminal activity and a nuisance for surrounding neighbors (Rodriguez, 2010). The property is now being developed as a site of permanently affordable housing with the Sawmill Community Land Trust. However, today and in light of many aligning external pressures, the community stands at a crossroads. “Gentrification,” has begun to become visible in the neighborhood and this paper will provide insight on how that trend is occurring. Barelas neighbors are working hard to defend the neighborhood’s extraordinary sense of place and desirability for long-time Barelas families. This paper will both highlight those efforts and provide technical support to the neighborhood’s strategies. To better understand gentrification and to identify how its dynamics are impacting Barelas, I begin with a study of peer-reviewed literature on the topic to provide a definition of the gentrification trend. I then examine several case studies of communities in other cities said to be “gentrified,” followed by an assessment of how economic indicators have changed in Barelas over recent years. With mostly anecdotal information suggesting gentrification is happening in Barelas, this paper provides data to verify whether <b>those</b> <b>suggestions</b> <b>are</b> accurate. With neighborhood activists striving to prepare the neighborhood for significant changes to come, it also provides recommendations for how they can most effectively address the consequences tied to the trend of gentrification. The paper provides two matrices to help with this understanding. One identifies the symptoms of gentrification in the neighborhood according to traits identified by literature and data in Barelas from the United States Census Bureau and other research. The other provides a template Kellogg Logic Model which, given the Kellogg Foundation’s significant support of Barelas’ community organizations, provides neighborhood leaders with one methodology in which to measure, evaluate and fortify their hard work to defend the Heart of Aztlan...|$|E
40|$|We live in {{the time}} of great media {{influence}} and we often found ourselves hearing warnings about nature conservation. Most people think that nature conservation means only separate collection of waste and waste recycling. Even though this is commendable, it does not help much to bring nature back to its former beauty in its original state. Many authors, whose thoughts will be presented in this diploma thesis, say that nature conservation consists of many wide specters of actions. Unfortunately, the world today is used to deal with aftereffect consequences only, while causes to problems are mistakenly left aside. In this diploma thesis, entitled The Influence of the Forest Pedagogy on the Development of Environmental Ethics in Preschool Children, I mostly wrote about nature conservation and environmental ethics. The important part of this diploma thesis also consists of environmental education idea and forest kindergartens principle, that is mostly known for its unique way of spending time in nature. Forest pedagogy was also explained as a strong connection between environmental ethics and nature kindergarten. The main purpose of this diploma thesis was to enlighten the importance of nature conservation through "play and learn principle". I chose three important dilemmas to research them in the logic of this main purpose. In the timeline of one month of play in nature with preschool children, I tried to research next assumptions: I wanted to find out which playground suits preschool children better. Was it the kindergarten playroom, kindergarten outside playground, or some natural space? Knowing that this question was asked before nature activities and after them, I expected some variations {{between the first and second}} answers. I wanted to find out what children think about nature protection and what their ideas for more productive and successful nature conservation were. I also wanted to find out if forest pedagogy does indeed influence children to accept nature as part of themselves and if the influence is strong enough for children to become nature protectors. For more practical and explicit experiences, I offered children large, unstructured natural space. It is a space where abundance of sensory perception and freedom with opportunity to take risks can occur. Autonomy and creative play have been also observed in the process. Based on interviews and observations, I soon came to the conclusion that a child would always chose the opportunity that represents challenge and a more complex experience. After experienced playing in the natural places, most of the children chose nature as the most suitable place for playing. Children knew that conservation of natural spaces is important. They also proposed many suggestions for more efficient natural conservation. Some of <b>those</b> <b>suggestions</b> <b>are</b> really suitable for applying in our world. It would be interesting to see results of such actions. When only some of the principles of the forest pedagogy were applied in the way of education that was commonly known to children, first reactions were soon observed. It was soon strongly understandable that in one month of natural experiences, children developed even more powerful connection with nature. It is a true fact that nature has, as the pioneer of nature conservations Rachel Carson said, gifts for everybody if only he or she is willing to accept them. In this one month of natural play, the children experienced many positive moments which were all in connection with nature and natural spaces. Mine major guidance on this path was to give the children the opportunity to fully accept nature into their hearts and to, consequently, show full respectful relationship with it, without adult educator to suggest children this action. In one month, the group of preschool children that I guided showed remarkable results. Not only that they helped in removing the process of aftereffect consequences as a result of unacceptable relationship to nature (collecting waste and recycling them, efficient use of electricity …) but they also took the first steps towards taking care of the reason for all these consequences, as no person, that consider nature as part of himself or herself, will destroy it, pollute it, or exploit it. And that was the most important thought I used when I were conducting researches for the aimed dilemmas. ...|$|E

To promote education for all, the concept of inclusion class will be an innovation in education system. An inclusion class consists of regular and disabled students who have very different learning needs as well as proficiency levels. To handle this condition, the teacher should collaborate with other teachers. Collaborative teaching (co-teaching) approach is then implemented in an inclusion class. The study was conducted at SDN Sumbersari II Malang due to some consideration: (1) the location is not far from researcherâ€™s campus so it helps the researcher to collect the data more easily, (2) the number of special students in each class is quite adequate for the study; it is around 1 to 5 special students in each class. This study was intended to describe the implementation of model of co-teaching approach in English teaching in an inclusion class at SDN Sumbersari II Malang focusing on (1) the implementation of teaching technique of co-teaching approach, and (2) the regular studentsâ€™ responses toward the co-teaching approach in an inclusion class. The design of this study is descriptive. The subjects of this study were the English and the special teacher, and the first grade students of SDN Sumbersari II Malang. The instruments of this study were observation checklist, field notes and interview guide.

40|$|This {{study has}} been {{conducted}} within a farmers’ association in Western France (Loire- Atlantique) promoting sustainable agriculture: the CIVAM DEFIS. The goal was to evaluate a two years training program by identifying the profiles of the farmers who enroll in it and how their systems have evolved. The targeted systems are dairy farms, cow/calf and sheep operations, main livestock farms found in this geographical area. The program itself is being carried out {{with the objective of}} helping farmers to implement thrifty and self-sufficient grazing systems on their farms. The desired outcome of such systems is to obtain viable and more sustainable farms by decreasing expenses. This is done through the development of grazing proportion in the ration by a technique of rotational grazing in paddocks. Semi-directive interviews were conducted with 22 former and current trainees. As a result of these discussions it was found {{that a majority of the}} farmers who enroll in the program came to refine their technique and develop the grazing part but were already farming with grass beforehand. This fact raises the question of why more intensive systems are not interested in grazing systems. It seems that livestock grazing is perceived as obsolete and that farmers are in some ways pressured into sticking to more “conventional” ways of farming. As for the training program itself, it was found to be relatively efficient as 64 % of the trainees have succeeded in evolving their systems towards more thrifty and self-sufficient ones. The remaining 36 % are farmers who had less grass-oriented systems at the enrollment time and for whom two years of training seems to be too short of a time to implement all the necessary changes both on their farms and in their way of thinking. Consequently suggestions of posttraining coaching were made such as individual support or the creation of local groups. If <b>those</b> <b>suggestions</b> <b>were</b> to be applied they could improve the program’s effectiveness into promoting thrifty and self-sufficient grazing systems as they are highly profitable on many levels. They are beneficial for farmers as individuals since they allow to improve both their income and working conditions. The entire society can also gain from them as they help to preserve farmers’ sovereignty and to produce healthy food at a fairly good level of productivity per hectare while preserving the environment...|$|R
50|$|In 1872 the Hungarian Temporary Monuments Commission was established, with Imrich Henszlmann was the {{commission}} secretary. A major reconstruction was realized between 1877-1896 {{and was the}} main priority of the Monuments Commission. It was financed mostly from the state budget of the Hungarian government. Imrich Steindl, a professor of Medieval Architecture of Budapest Technical University and the most famous architect of the Hungarian Neo-Gothic, was named as the main architect of the reconstruction works. Based on the ruptures in arches he decided that pillars' allocation in the aisles was {{the main reason for}} the state of a disrepair of the cathedral statics. He worked out a completely new purist projection of the cathedral's reconstruction where the three-aisle cathedral was rebuilt to a five-aisle cathedral and added arches in side aisles. Originally medieval star arches at the main as well as the side aisles were rebuilt to network ones. An old choir was removed and on its place Steindl built expanded replicas with more pillars. The next works involved the exterior - adjusting the external walls and gavels, supporting the columns, the water-chutes and windows' carved works, the portals' decoration and the change of Matthias' tower roof. A Late Gothic chapel of St Joseph at the north part of the cathedral was completely removed. A Neo-Gothic tower which was crossing the main and the side aisles, flèche was created. Steindl's primary plan was to rebuild all the Neo-Gothic additional building and components in the cathedral. But <b>those</b> <b>suggestions</b> <b>were</b> declined by {{the commission}} and they requested a cheaper exchange of old stone parts for the new ones. Re-Gothic (re-gothisation) of towers was not realized due to lack of money. This was reflected in a cheaper construction material. During the Exchange of a base system in 1878-1882 cheap but low-quality sandstone from the nearby stone-pit Spiššké Vlachy was used. Its quick dilapidated outer surface resulted in removal of pinnacles and gargoyles because they endangered pedestrians.|$|R
40|$|What {{follows is}} a {{personal}} reflection on the challenges that may face the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) Foundation in the next 10 years, {{and is based on}} two conference presentations and the debate at <b>those</b> conferences. The <b>suggestion</b> <b>is</b> that the character {{of the members of the}} International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) in its second decade is different from that of the founding board, and is more pragmatic than crusading. It is mooted that the board will need to address second-order issues of the organisation and policy, and that Europe will try to take a more influential role. The article observes that existing issues of funding, complexity and differential reporting may become more urgent and will need to be addressed for the organisation to continue to evolve...|$|R
5000|$|On 28 July 2005, the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions {{formally}} {{announced that}} they had no provable evidence to proceed with any criminal case against Vizard. The Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions Damian Bugg QC along with ASIC Chairman Jeff Lucy vigorously denied assertions by some sections of the media that they had [...] "gone soft" [...] on Vizard. ASIC Chairman Lucy made clear to the Parliament in his report of 13 September 2005 that there had never been any provable criminal case against Vizard despite the most vigorous examination by ASIC, and that this lack of any criminal case against Vizard was a view shared by both ASIC and the Attorney General:"In this case, criminal charges were not pursued against Mr. Vizard because the DPP was not satisfied that there was admissible, substantial and reliable evidence of the offence and therefore there were not reasonable prospects of securing a conviction…Whilst this was a decision for the DPP, it was also consistent with senior counsel advice that ASIC had independently received....When ASIC announced on 4 July that we were pursuing civil penalties against Mr. Vizard, there <b>were</b> some <b>suggestions</b> in the press that we had gone soft or that we had somehow been nobbled by government. I have unequivocally rejected <b>those</b> <b>suggestions.</b> They <b>are</b> entirely without foundation." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to discuss the {{requirements}} of simulation output analysis software from different viewpoints: statistics, computational and user interface. The impact of lack of software support for simulation output analysis on the use of statistical techniques is discussed and confronted with <b>those</b> viewpoints. Finally, <b>suggestions</b> <b>are</b> made concerning the most relevant characteristics of simulation output analysis software. 1 # INTRODUCTION Simulation is a statistical sampling experiment. Therefore, the analysis of the output data generated by experiments is one of the main steps to be performed in a simulation project. Only by means of statistical analysis of output data obtained from a model it is possible to obtain scientific support for the decision making based on this model (Law and Kelton, 1991). Experience has shown that the majority of simulation users pay little attention to output data analysis. Users calculate considerably fewer statistics than would be [...] ...|$|R

5000|$|Ronalds {{introduced}} {{several new}} ideas, however, in Chapter I. His experiments and observations {{led him to}} describe and illustrate the trout's Window of vision, a concept an understanding of which is still essential today. Vincent Marinaro, in his classic work In the Ring of the Rise (1976), credits Ronalds with discovering and documenting this window and includes a reproduction of plate II-Optical diagrams in his book. [...] Ronalds’ physicist brother Sir Francis Ronalds quantified the phenomenon for Alfred using his knowledge of optics. In the sub-chapter [...] "Haunts", through discussion and illustration (plate I), Alfred Ronalds introduces the idea known today as reading the water to help the angler identify the most likely locations in the stream to find trout. The real meat of Ronalds' book was Chapter IV: Of a Selection of Insects, and Their Imitations, Used in Fly Fishing. Here, for the first time, the author discussed specific artificial fly imitations by name, associated with the corresponding natural insect. Organized by their month of appearance, Ronalds was the first author to begin the standardization of angler names for artificial flies. Prior to The Fly-fisher's Entomology, anglers had <b>been</b> given <b>suggestions</b> for artificial flies to be used on a particular river or {{at a particular time}} of the year, but <b>those</b> <b>suggestions</b> <b>were</b> never matched to specific natural insects the angler might encounter on the water. [...] The following is a typical discussion: No. 28. Green Drake XIII. This fly, proceeding from a water nympha, lives three or four days as shown; then the female changes to the Grey Drake (No. 29.), and the male to the Black Drake (see p. 89.). The Green Drake cannot be said to be in season quite three weeks on an average. Its season depends greatly upon the state of the weather; and it will be found earlier upon the slowly running parts of the stream (such as mill dams) than on the rapid places.*Imitation**Body. The middle part is of pale straw coloured floss silk, ribbed with silver twist. The extremities are of a brown peacock's herl, tied with light brown silk thread.** Tail. Three rabbit's whiskers.** Wings and Legs. Made buzz from a mottled feather of the mallard, stained olive. (See Dyes, Chap. II. p. 35. article 4.) To make it with wings in their state of rest, part of a feather similarly stained must be used, and a pale brown Bittern's hackle, or in case of need, a partridge feather must be wrapped round the same body under the wings.
