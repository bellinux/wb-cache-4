His eventual successor Philip Allen regarded him as operating in the tradition of preserving the liberty of the subject wherever possible; those who had worked under him also noted his highly prized commitment to keeping the politicians in charge of the department out of trouble at all costs.|$|E

25|$|Thiago's first {{introduction}} to tennis happened {{when he first}} saw his brother watching Gustavo Kuerten on TV, being eight years old. Monteiro trained football at an Academy near where his brother used to play tennis. He played {{it for the first time}} when his football class was cancelled and his brother called him to hit the ball. Thiago soon started training and disputing local tournaments: in early 2004 he won his first tournament, being only nine years old. Thiago would leave his hometown, Fortaleza, in late 2008 to enter the Larri Passos Academy in Balneário Camboriú to improve his game. Thiago says that if he didn't made that change, he would probably be a football player. Now as a professional player, Thiago uses his spare <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>enjoy</b> movies and spend it with friends and family. He attends college online and has been dating fellow brazilian tennis player, Beatriz Haddad Maia since March 2016.|$|E
25|$|As {{governor}} of Hangzhou, Bai Juyi realised that the farmland nearby {{depended on the}} water of West Lake, but, due to the negligence of previous governors, the old dike had collapsed and the lake had dried out {{to the point that}} the local farmers were suffering from severe drought. He ordered the construction of a stronger and taller dike, with a dam to control the flow of water, thus providing water for irrigation, relieving the drought, and improving the livelihood of the local people over the following years. Bai Juyi used his leisure <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>enjoy</b> the beauty of West Lake, visiting the lake almost every day. He ordered the construction of a causeway to allow walking on foot, instead of requiring the services of a boat. A causeway in the West Lake (Baisha Causeway, 白沙堤) was later referred to as Bai Causeway in Bai Juyi's honour, but the original causeway built by Bai Juyi named Baigong Causeway (白公堤) no longer exists.|$|E

500|$|Hay sailed for Paris {{at the end}} of June 1865. There, {{he served}} under U.S. Minister to France John Bigelow. The {{workload}} was not heavy, and Hay found <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>enjoy</b> the pleasures of Paris. When Bigelow resigned in mid-1866, Hay, as was customary, submitted his resignation, though he was asked to remain until Bigelow's successor was in place, and stayed until January 1867. He consulted with Secretary of State William H. Seward, asking him for [...] "anything worth having". Seward suggested the post of Minister to Sweden, but reckoned without the new president, Andrew Johnson, who had his own candidate. Seward offered Hay a job as his private secretary, but Hay declined, and returned home to Warsaw.|$|E

Jacques sold around 1500 acre {{of the property}} in 1929 to Lawrence Richey, {{one of the two}} Secretaries to the President under Herbert Hoover (1929-1933). He constructed a main lodge, which he named Richey Lodge, and several cabins, one of which was later named after Hoover. The president visited several <b>times</b> <b>to</b> <b>enjoy</b> the trout fishing, which was said to be some {{of the best in the}} state.

500|$|In 1985, Eckhart {{moved to}} Australia {{and settled in}} Sydney, where he {{attended}} American International School of Sydney for his high school senior year; he further developed his acting skills in productions like Waiting for Godot, where {{he admits that he}} gave a [...] "terrible" [...] performance. In the autumn of his senior year, Eckhart left school to take a job at the Warringah Mall movie theater. He eventually earned his diploma through an adult education course. This also allowed Eckhart <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>enjoy</b> a year of surfing in Hawaii and France, as well as skiing in the Alps. In 1988, Eckhart returned to the United States and enrolled as a film major at Brigham Young University–Hawaii, but later transferred to Brigham Young University (BYU) in Provo, Utah. He graduated in 1994 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree. His fortunes changed for the better when he was offered the role of George in the film Erin Brockovich, which gave his failing career a much needed boost. He was then flooded with film offers and before long established himself as a respected character actor in Hollywood.|$|E
500|$|Parliamentary business, in {{the form}} of the hotly contested Reform Bill campaign, delayed his taking command until May. His youth and inexperience, {{compared}} with that of the battle-tested officers whom he led (some were veterans of the battle of Waterloo) drew his naturally punctilious nature to manifest itself in petty-minded bullying. In 1833 he was publicly censured for [...] "reprehensible...conduct" [...] in a court martial held to determine charges he had laid against Captain Augustus Wathen, a subordinate. Brudenell was dismissed, by order of King William, early in 1834. He had, however, influence at court and he asked his sister Harriet, married to Queen Adelaide's chamberlain, Lord Howe, to get the decision reversed. He pestered senior officers and politicians until in March 1836 he was allowed command of the 11th Light Dragoons (later restyled the 11th Hussars), notwithstanding the view of his commander-in-chief, Lord Hill, that he was [...] "constitutionally unfit for command". After a leisurely passage with his wife, he joined his new command in India in October of the following year, just in <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>enjoy</b> some tiger-shooting before seeing the regiment off for Britain at the end of its long posting. He travelled separately in a hired vessel, disdaining to share the discomforts of the warship carrying his troops. Of the two years following his appointment, only four weeks were spent with his regiment.|$|E
500|$|The {{writer of}} the {{scenario}} is unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. He was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. The comedy of the situation derives from Jenks' own attempts to manufacture some free <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>enjoy</b> himself, only to regret the action because of the resultant circumstances. Advertising for the film confirms this by stating, [...] "Jenk's day off was a day of woe instead of the day of joy he meant it to be. It taught him to never, never leave his wife's side - not even for a day!" [...] Jenks' swimming in a secluded spot, inferring swimming in the nude through {{the lack of a}} swimming suit, sets the stage for the comedy when his clothes are swapped for those of the cross-dressed convict. With no other option, Jenks dons the clothes and responds to the call for help. The lady identifies Jenks as the convict, wearing her clothes, and the film concludes with a chase that leads to the arrest and humiliation of Jenks. This comedy predates the well-known cross-dressing antics of Fatty Arbuckle and Charlie Chaplin by a few years. The film director is unknown, but it may have been Barry O'Neil. Film historian Q. David Bowers does not attribute a cameraman for this production, but at least two possible candidates exist. Blair Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser company, but he was soon joined by Carl Louis Gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. The cast is uncredited because their identities are unknown. Bowers states that most of the credits are fragmentary for 1910 Thanhouser productions. Known and more prominent members of the cast to appear in productions include the leading ladies, Anna Rosemond and Violet Heming, and the leading man was Frank H. Crane.|$|E
