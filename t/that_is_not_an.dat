5|$|A B {{movie or}} B {{film is a}} low-budget {{commercial}} movie, but one <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> arthouse film. In its original usage, during the Golden Age of Hollywood, the term more precisely identified films intended for distribution as the less-publicized bottom half of a double feature (akin to B-sides for recorded music). Although the U.S. production of movies intended as second features largely ceased {{by the end of}} the 1950s, the term B movie continues to be used in its broader sense to this day. In its post–Golden Age usage, there is ambiguity on both sides of the definition: on the one hand, the primary interest of many inexpensive exploitation films is prurient; on the other, many B movies display a high degree of craft and aesthetic ingenuity.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from his}} operas, Wagner {{composed}} relatively {{few pieces of}} music. These include a symphony in C major (written {{at the age of}} 19), the Faust Overture (the only completed part of an intended symphony on the subject), some overtures, and choral and piano pieces. His most commonly performed work <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> extract from an opera is the Siegfried Idyll for chamber orchestra, which has several motifs in common with the Ring cycle. The Wesendonck Lieder are also often performed, either in the original piano version, or with orchestral accompaniment. More rarely performed are the American Centennial March (1876), and Das Liebesmahl der Apostel (The Love Feast of the Apostles), a piece for male choruses and orchestra composed in 1843 for the city of Dresden.|$|E

25|$|Azathioprine is a prodrug, a {{substance}} <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> active drug itself but is activated in the body. This happens in several steps; {{at first it}} is slowly and almost completely converted to 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) by reductive cleavage of the thioether (–S–). This is mediated by glutathione and similar compounds in the intestinal wall, the liver and on red blood cells, {{without the aid of}} enzymes. 6-MP is metabolized analogously to natural purines, giving thioguanosine triphosphate (TGTP) and thio-deoxyguanosine triphosphate (TdGTP) via thioinosine monophosphate (TIMP) and several further intermediates. On a second path, the sulfur atom of 6-MP and TIMP is methylated. The end products of azathioprine metabolism are thiouric acid (38%) and various methylated and hydroxylated purines, which are excreted via the urine.|$|E

25|$|The Apollonian {{networks}} do {{not form}} {{a family of}} graphs that is closed under the operation of taking graph minors, as removing edges but not vertices from an Apollonian network produces a graph <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> Apollonian network. However, the planar partial 3-trees, subgraphs of Apollonian networks, are minor-closed. Therefore, according to the Robertson–Seymour theorem, they can be characterized by {{a finite number of}} forbidden minors. The minimal forbidden minors for the planar partial 3-trees are the four minimal graphs among the forbidden minors for the planar graphs and the partial 3-trees: the complete graph , the complete bipartite graph , the graph of the octahedron, and the graph of the pentagonal prism. The Apollonian graphs are the maximal graphs that do not have any of these four graphs as a minor.|$|E

500|$|Encountering a MissingNo. Pokémon is {{the result}} of three {{computing}} events. The first is the game's random battle encounter system; each area assigns values to Pokémon in a data buffer, which the game accesses for the player's encounters with wild Pokémon. However, no values are assigned to this buffer on the east coast of the Cinnabar and Seafoam Island locations—the information from the previously visited area is used instead. The second factor is the in-game tutorial, which temporarily stores the player's name in the data buffer. This causes the game to access the hexadecimal values of the player's name for Pokémon encounters at Cinnabar and Seafoam Island. The third factor is the game's error handling system; if the game selects a value from the data buffer <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> existing Pokémon, a subroutine is triggered that causes the appearance of a Pokémon named MissingNo., short for [...] "Missing Number".|$|E
