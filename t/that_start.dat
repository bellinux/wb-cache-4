5|$|The {{original}} 2-way design {{consisted of}} two 150-4C bass drivers with 4-inch coils, and two H5038P-100 elliptical horns. The 5038s are essentially midrange drivers <b>that</b> <b>start</b> rolling off at 15kHz. In 1960, after feedback from foreign distributors, the Paragon {{was made into a}} 3-way loudspeaker by adding two 075 ring radiators (tweeters) mounted {{in the back of the}} cabinet and aimed at the central 'sweet spot'. Bass–mid crossover was at 500Hz and mid–treble frequencies crossed over at 7kHz.|$|E

5|$|Lung cancer, {{also known}} as lung carcinoma, is a {{malignant}} lung tumor characterized by uncontrolled cell growth in tissues of the lung. This growth can spread beyond the lung {{by the process of}} metastasis into nearby tissue or other parts of the body. Most cancers <b>that</b> <b>start</b> in the lung, known as primary lung cancers, are carcinomas. The two main types are small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) and non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). The most common symptoms are coughing (including coughing up blood), weight loss, shortness of breath, and chest pains.|$|E
5|$|Termites {{construct}} shelter tubes, {{also known}} as earthen tubes or mud tubes, <b>that</b> <b>start</b> from the ground. These shelter tubes {{can be found on}} walls and other structures. Constructed by termites during the night, a time of higher humidity, these tubes provide protection to termites from potential predators, especially ants. Shelter tubes also provide high humidity and darkness and allow workers to collect food sources that cannot be accessed in any other way. These passageways are made from soil and faeces and are normally brown in colour. The size of these shelter tubes depends on the amount of food sources that are available. They range from less than 1cm to several cm in width, but may extend dozens of metres in length.|$|E
40|$|Stability {{and change}} of moral {{disengagement}} {{were examined in}} a sample of 366 adolescents from ages 14 to 20 years. Four developmental trajectories were identified: (a) nondisengaged group <b>that</b> <b>started</b> with initially low levels followed by an important decline, (b) normative group <b>that</b> <b>started</b> with initially moderate levels followed by a decline, (c) later desister group <b>that</b> <b>started</b> with initially high-medium levels followed by an increase from 14 to 16 years and an even steeper decline from 16 to 20 years, and (d) chronic group <b>that</b> <b>started</b> with and maintained medium-high levels. The results attest that adolescents who maintained higher levels of moral disengagement were more likely to show frequent aggressive and violent acts in late adolescence...|$|R

5|$|The flame tree {{does not}} rely on fire but shoots its seeds through the air when {{the two sides of}} its long pods crack apart explosively on drying. The {{miniature}} cone-like catkins of alder trees produce seeds that contain small droplets of oil that help disperse the seeds on the surface of water. Mangroves often grow in water and some species have propagules, which are buoyant fruits with seeds <b>that</b> <b>start</b> germinating before becoming detached from the parent tree. These float on the water and may become lodged on emerging mudbanks and successfully take root.|$|E
5|$|While the {{development}} of wings in insects is clearly defined in those {{who are members of}} Endopterygota, which undergo complete metamorphosis; in these species, the wing develops while in the pupal stage of the insects life cycle. However, insects that undergo incomplete metamorphosis do not have a pupal stage, therefore they must have a different wing morphogenesis. Insects such as those that are hemimetabolic have wings <b>that</b> <b>start</b> out as buds, which are found underneath the exoskeleton, and do not become exposed until the last instar of the nymph.|$|E
5|$|William Lane Craig criticised Oppy's {{study as}} too vague for useful classification. Craig argued that an {{argument}} can be classified as ontological if it attempts to deduce the existence of God, along with other necessary truths, from his definition. He suggested that proponents of ontological arguments would claim that, if one fully understood the concept of God, one must accept his existence. William L. Rowe defined ontological arguments as those <b>that</b> <b>start</b> from the definition of God and, using only a priori principles, conclude with God's existence.|$|E

5|$|Following its predecessors, Brawl uses {{a battle}} system {{unlike that of}} typical {{fighting}} games. Players can choose from a large selection of characters, each attempting to knock their opponents off the screen as they fight on various stages. The characters in Brawl include most of the same ones as the predecessors, such as the well-known Mario and Pikachu. Instead of using traditional health bars <b>that</b> <b>start</b> at a maximum value and lose value, Brawl characters start the game with 0%; the value rises as they take damage and may rise over 100% {{to a maximum of}} 999%. As a character's percentage increases, the character flies further back when hit. When a character is knocked beyond a stage's boundary and disappears from the screen, the character loses either a life, a point, or coins, depending on the mode of play. Brawl includes a function which allows players to create profiles with personalized button configurations for each control method along with their chosen username.|$|E
5|$|Like many earthstars, {{the fungus}} uses {{the force of}} falling raindrops to help {{disperse}} the spores, which are ejected in little bursts when objects (such as rain) strike the outer wall of the spore sac. The gleba is brown to grayish-brown, with a cotton-like texture that, when compressed, allows the endoperidium to flex quickly and create a puff of air that is forced out through the ostioles. This generates a cloud of spores that can then be carried by the wind. There are columellae (sterile structures <b>that</b> <b>start</b> {{at the base of}} the gleba and extend through it), which are usually not evident in the mature gleba, but apparent {{at the base of the}} spore sac. The columellae are not connected to the ostioles, but rather, terminate within the gleba at some distance from them. The capillitia (sterile strands within the gleba) are long, slender, free, tapering, unbranched, and 2–5μm thick, with thickened walls. The spores are spherical, nonamyloid, and are ornamented with irregularly shaped flaring protuberances up to 2μm high. They measure 3.9–4.8μm in diameter (without ornamentation), and 5.4–7.0μm including the ornamentation.|$|E
5|$|Pierce's 1954 {{season was}} {{interrupted}} when he reported {{pain in his}} left arm in a May 25 win over Cleveland; after several days of difficulty in determining the problem, he had oral surgery to remove an infected wisdom tooth and adjacent molar on June 3. He did not pitch again until June 20, but a lack of arm strength caused him to be ineffective in <b>that</b> <b>start</b> before slowly coming back with two relief appearances and another poor start, finally picking up wins with consecutive 3–0 shutouts on July 5 and 11, the latter being his fourth career two-hitter. It was later reported that the tooth problem had possibly existed as early as spring training, when Pierce initially suffered arm problems. But although he recorded only nine wins that season, {{he was one of}} just four pitchers to defeat the Indians three times as they racked up a league-record 111 victories, after also having been one of four pitchers to defeat the champion Yankees four times in 1953.|$|E

Thus, the prefix shows up as 'n' on words <b>that</b> <b>start</b> with t or d, e.g. ntaba 'goat', but as 'm' on words <b>that</b> <b>start</b> with b or p (e.g. mbisi 'fish'). There is also a prefixless class 9a and 10a, exemplified by sánzá → sánzá 'moon(s) or month(s)'. Possible ambiguities are solved by the context.|$|E

25|$|This {{is done by}} {{dividing}} the sums adding to n+1 in a different way, this time by {{the location of the}} first 2. Specifically, the first group consists of those sums <b>that</b> <b>start</b> with 2, the second group those <b>that</b> <b>start</b> 1+2, the third 1+1+2, and so on, until the last group, which consists of the single sum where only 1's are used. The number of sums in the first group is F(n), F(n−1) in the second group, and so on, with 1 sum in the last group. So the total number of sums is F(n)+F(n−1)+...+F(1)+1 and therefore this quantity is equal to F(n+2).|$|E
