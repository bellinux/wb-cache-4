5|$|Castelli {{understood}} that the British force only aspired to annex <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> British Empire, and resigned to avoid swearing allegiance to Britain. Santiago de Liniers liberated Buenos Aires a short time later, but Saturnino Rodríguez Peña helped Beresford escape, hoping to influence an eventual second invasion to implement reforms supported by Burke and Miranda. The second British invasion, however, ended the patriot's hopes of British support, and they fought against their former allies.|$|E
5|$|I-37 {{transitions}} to a rural setting once {{outside of the}} Corpus Christi city limits {{on its way to}} Mathis and Lake Corpus Christi. It continues on to the northwest and intersects US 59 (future I-69W) east of George West. It begins paralleling US 281 to the east before the two intersect and have a concurrency north of Three Rivers near Choke Canyon Reservoir. U.S. Highway 281 Alternate (US281Alt) splits off from I-37 near Sunniland and parallels I-37 before rejoining north of Campbellton. The two routes remain concurrent until US 281 splits off to head to Pleasanton, while I-37 bypasses <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east. After US 281 leaves towards the northwest, I-37 turns to the north towards San Antonio.|$|E
5|$|In 335 BC, Alexander {{fought against}} the Thracian tribe of the Triballi at Haemus Mons and along the Danube, forcing their {{surrender}} on Peuce Island. Shortly thereafter, the Illyrian king Cleitus of the Dardani threatened to attack Macedonia, but Alexander took the initiative and besieged the Dardani at Pelion (in modern Albania). When Thebes had once again revolted from the League of Corinth and was besieging the Macedonian garrison in the Cadmea, Alexander left the Illyrian front and marched to Thebes, which he placed under siege. After breaching the walls, Alexander's forces killed 6,000 Thebans, took 30,000 inhabitants as prisoners of war, and burned <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground as a warning that convinced all other Greek states except Sparta not to challenge Alexander again.|$|E

5|$|In 66, the Jews of the Judaea Province revolted {{against the}} Roman Empire. Cestius Gallus, the legate of Syria, {{was forced to}} retreat from Jerusalem and {{defeated}} {{at the battle of}} Beth-Horon. The pro-Roman king Agrippa II and his sister Berenice fled <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Galilee where they later gave themselves up to the Romans. Nero appointed Vespasian to put down the rebellion, who was dispatched to the region at once with the fifth and tenth legions. He was later joined by Titus at Ptolemais, bringing with him the fifteenth legion. With a strength of 60,000 professional soldiers, the Romans quickly swept across the Galilee, and by 68 marched on Jerusalem.|$|E
5|$|In {{parallel}} {{with the construction of}} the works, trunk sewers were built to convey sewage from <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> works. These was a major programme of expansion to the sewer network in 1910, to ensure that it could cope with the expected volumes of effluent produced. Because British sewers are also expected to handle rainwater, a series of storm sewage overflows were provided, which resulted in diluted sewage being discharged into the River Don in times of heavy rainfall.|$|E

5|$|M-43 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with BL I-196 in South Haven. Known locally as Bailey Avenue, the road heads out of <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> southwest, intersecting County Road A-2 before running over Interstate 196 (I-196). From there, the road continues {{to the southeast}} near the airport through the rural areas of Van Buren County. The road runs through mixed woodland and fields before passing through Bangor. After Bangor, the route heads due east past Glendale and then intersects M-40 north of Paw Paw.|$|E
5|$|Midway between Morristown and Ogdensburg, NY37 enters St. Lawrence State Park, {{one of many}} New York {{state parks}} located on the {{southern}} bank of the river. The route exits the park and heads northeast to Ogdensburg, where it meets NY68 (the former routing of NY37 into Ogdensburg) west of the city. While NY68 continues into downtown, NY37 turns eastward, then northeastward and bypasses <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south. Near the Ogdensburg International Airport, NY37 meets NY812 at an interchange. Here, NY812 joins NY37 and the two routes intersect NY68 once more before leaving Ogdensburg.|$|E
5|$|Now {{with the}} city under Gorgopas' command the {{defenders}} became reinvigorated. The siege was proving more difficult until Flamininus arrived with 4,000 Roman soldiers. With {{the arrival of the}} new soldiers, the allied soldiers were encouraged and began bombarding the city again with their siege engines while the Rhodian and Pergamese fleet continued to put pressure on the Spartans from the sea. The Spartans knew {{that they did not have}} much of a chance of withstanding the renewed allied assault and Gorgopas decided to surrender <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Romans under the condition that the garrison was allowed to leave the city unharmed.|$|E

5|$|On 18 October, Vittorio Emanuele and {{her three}} sisters, along with three cruisers and several destroyers and torpedo boats escorted a convoy that carried half of the 2nd Infantry Division to Benghazi. When the Ottomans refused to {{surrender}} the city before the amphibious assault, the Italian fleet opened fire on the Turkish defenders at 08:00, while landing parties from the ships and the Army infantry went ashore. The Italians quickly forced the Ottomans to withdraw into the city by evening. After a short siege, the Ottoman forces withdrew on 29 October, leaving <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Italians.|$|E
5|$|Once the Ionian revolt {{was finally}} {{crushed by the}} Persian victory at the Battle of Lade, Darius began to plan to subjugate Greece. In 490 BC, he sent a naval task force under Datis and Artaphernes across the Aegean to subjugate the Cyclades, and then to make punitive attacks on Athens and Eretria. Reaching Euboea in mid-summer after a {{successful}} campaign in the Aegean, the Persians proceeded to put Eretria under siege. The siege lasted six days before a fifth column of Eretrian nobles betrayed <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Persians. The city was plundered, and the population enslaved on Darius's orders. The Eretrian prisoners were eventually taken to Persia and settled as colonists in Cissia.|$|E
5|$|One {{suggested}} {{route for}} an O-Bahn was for an alignment {{adjacent to the}} Noarlunga Centre railway line from <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Tonsley railway line. The O-Bahn would end there, with buses continuing on the Southern Expressway through the far south. Construction of this O-Bahn would require moving the railway track slightly to fit the O-Bahn alongside. In addition, Emerson Crossing and the Goodwood tram overpass would require alteration. The estimated cost of construction, $182million, was considered too expensive, and the proposal was suspended in 2001. Since then, the Government has focused on road upgrades and an inner-city light rail extension.|$|E
