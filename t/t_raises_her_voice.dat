60|$|Marie <b>raised</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice,</b> {{and called}} Miss Ophelia, {{from the other}} room.|$|R
60|$|We {{were now}} near the gate {{opposite}} the theatre. She <b>raised</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice.</b>|$|R
60|$|The wife <b>raised</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> to that wild, animal-like pitch a woman uses when desperate.|$|R
60|$|Josephine laughed. Then she saw Phipps {{standing}} {{in the background and}} she <b>raised</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> a little.|$|R
6000|$|... "Silly old Concertina! Hark at him, George!" [...] She <b>raised</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice.</b> [...] "Don't sing that, you old Walrus, you! Sing 'I'm afloat!'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Aweel! aweel! Ellangowan,' {{said the}} lady, <b>raising</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> as the Laird left the room, 'I wish ye may {{understand}} them yoursell, that's a'!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I dont know." [...] Then, <b>raising</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> {{so as to}} be overheard, {{she exclaimed}} [...] "Here is a stupid man coming into our carriage." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, {{only the}} words of an old rhyme that keeps running in my head,' {{answered}} the old woman; and she <b>raised</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> and went on: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He might eat all {{the cake}} {{in the house}} for what I care," [...] said Mrs. Chinnery, turning very red, and <b>raising</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> a little.|$|R
60|$|She {{saw that}} her mother wished to speak, and leaned down over her, for Madame Duchesne could not as yet <b>raise</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> above a whisper.|$|R
60|$|She <b>raised</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> at each entreaty {{until it}} almost reached a shriek, {{and then her}} whole frame seemed to sink down into the bed from exhaustion.|$|R
6000|$|... "'They are poets still--incorrigible!' {{answered}} the lady; then slightly <b>raising</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> of silver, as a beautiful appearance in a toga drew near, she cried 'Catullo mio!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, we don't want them," [...] {{retorted}} Miss Kybird, <b>raising</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice,</b> [...] "and I don't {{want any}} of your impudence. Get up out of our chair." ...|$|R
5000|$|She has Attended 27th Human Rights Council in United Nations Organization at Geneva , Switzerland in 2014 and <b>raised</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> {{for women}} rights , sex {{discrimination}} , child rights etc.|$|R
6000|$|The hymn {{died away}} in its low cadence, and then, ere Eustacie had {{had time to}} think of the {{consequences}} of thus <b>raising</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice,</b> the new-comer demanded: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ho! carn’t I?" [...] {{said the}} lady, <b>raising</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> a little. [...] "You go an’ {{tell him that}} his lawful wedded wife, what he deserted, is aboard." ...|$|R
60|$|She did not <b>raise</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> above <b>her</b> breath, or address us, {{but said}} this to the night sky; then stood profoundly quiet, looking at the gloomy water.|$|R
6000|$|... "Remember, I want {{to belong}} to your society--remember," [...] she added, having to <b>raise</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> a little, and {{shutting}} the door upon {{the rest of her}} words.|$|R
6000|$|... "Be careful. That {{woman is}} a cat. Stay and talk to me. Please don't bother, Mr. Lessingham. Won't you ring the bell instead?" [...] she continued, <b>raising</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice.</b>|$|R
60|$|At {{this moment}} {{there was a}} loud ring at the bell, and I could hear Mrs. Hudson, our landlady, <b>raising</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> in a wail of expostulation and dismay.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, no," [...] she said, {{quite in}} a whisper; and, indeed, {{she could hardly}} <b>raise</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> above a whisper, fearing that tears would fall from her {{tell-tale}} eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "And Annie's," [...] said Jane, <b>raising</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> {{above the}} din. [...] "I don't know which has {{improved}} the most. I'm sure {{the way they}} both drink their tea now--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Time we started," [...] said Mrs. Banks, <b>raising</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> {{above the}} din. [...] "Cap’in Barber, you and Mr. Gibson {{and the other}} gentlemen had better get to the church." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "George!" [...] cried Mrs. Fillson, {{who was a}} fine woman, <b>raising</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> {{almost to}} a scream {{in the effort to}} make herself heard above the winch of a {{neighbouring}} steamer.|$|R
60|$|The child nodded, gratefully. Then, {{leaning against}} {{the face of the}} cliff, she <b>raised</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> and warbled clearly the bit of song that served as the signal to her father.|$|R
60|$|She had <b>raised</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> a little, {{thinking}} the man might be asleep. But no sound answered her, save {{from outside the}} cry of a bird frightened by some midnight prowler.|$|R
6000|$|<b>Raising</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> {{in a tone}} {{of gentle}} pleading, she said, [...] "I came over the sea. I am hungry, and so is the child. Will you not give us some milk?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{had to drop}} {{behind a}} little," [...] said Miss Nugent, <b>raising</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice.</b> [...] "Aunt and Dr. Murchison will talk about their {{complaints}} to each other! They have been exchanging prescriptions." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{might be}} a' {{dead and buried}} too," [...] said Maggie, [...] "for onything ye wad ken about it;"--and then, <b>raising</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> to the stretch of her mother-in-law's comprehension, she added, ...|$|R
50|$|Rita will be thorny {{in their}} business. She will not trust anybody. She makes {{impossible}} demands {{and when it}} didn't meet her expectations, she evicted her employees. Even if she doesn't <b>raise</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice,</b> <b>her</b> cold treatment is enough to scare the people around her. Because of her habit, many people became angry with her.|$|R
6000|$|... "And now--" [...] whispered Madame, {{suddenly}} turning: [...] "What {{about this}} Ciccio, hein?" [...] It was ridiculous {{that she would}} not <b>raise</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> above a whisper, upstairs there. But so it was.|$|R
50|$|A typical meganekko, Hakase is tech-savvy and intelligent. Although she isn't talking much, she is {{far from}} shy and will <b>raise</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> if {{necessary}} (i.e. if it's a topic she feels knowledgeable in).|$|R
60|$|Madam <b>raised</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> {{in saying}} this, and nodded significantly; but a mild snore {{from the other}} room seemed to assure her that it was a waste of shot to fire in that direction.|$|R
6000|$|... "They did not consider," [...] said Altiora, <b>raising</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice</b> {{and going}} right over me, [...] "that I had allowed {{sufficiently}} {{for the inevitable}} development of an official administrative class in the modern state." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And how did {{you like}} the girl, Agnes?" [...] she said, <b>raising</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice.</b> Agnes had fetched Charlie in, and they were looking {{together}} down into the street while their mother was talking to Guy.|$|R
60|$|Hall {{tried to}} convey {{everything}} by grimaces and dumb show, but Mrs. Hall was obdurate. She <b>raised</b> <b>her</b> <b>voice.</b> So Hall and Henfrey, rather crestfallen, tiptoed {{back to the}} bar, gesticulating to explain to her.|$|R
