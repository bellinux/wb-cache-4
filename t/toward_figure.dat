50|$|The broader {{category}} of multi-core processors, by contrast are usually designed to efficiently run both parallel and serial code, and therefore place {{more emphasis on}} high single thread performance (e.g. devoting more silicon to out of order execution, deeper pipelines, more superscalar execution units, and larger, more general caches), and shared memory. These techniques devote runtime resources <b>toward</b> <b>figuring</b> out implicit parallelism in a single thread. They are used in systems where they have evolved continuously (with backward compatibility) from single core processors. They usually have a 'few' cores (e.g. 2,4,8), and may be complemented by a manycore accelerator (such as a GPU) in a heterogeneous system.|$|R

40|$|Investigated {{the effects}} of musical soundtracks on 25 undergraduates' attitudes <b>toward</b> <b>figures</b> in a short {{animated}} film. In a preliminary study and in the main experiment, Ss saw the film accompanied by 1 of 2 soundtracks or with no soundtrack, or heard 1 of the 2 soundtracks alone. In the main experiment, semantic differential judgments on activity and potency dimensions of the music predicted effects of the soundtracks on corresponding ratings of the film compared with ratings in a no soundtrack condition. Ratings on the activity dimension of the film characters themselves were altered by the soundtracks. It is hypothesized that stimulus features and concepts that are initially encoded as disjunctive conjoin in perception and memory. Source type: Electronic(1...|$|R

40|$|Political {{campaign}} on 2004 {{was marked by}} monologue campaigns {{in the form of}} mass rally and mass gathering. Information dissemination for the mass was carried out by placing signpost, banners, and pamphlets depicting party 2 ̆ 7 s symbol. This kind of campaign belonged to one way communication. Both political party and political leaders were failed to gain feedback from the mass, whereas feedback reflected public 2 ̆ 7 s needs and wishes. As consequences, monologue campaigns provide us with low quality campaign oriented <b>toward</b> <b>figures,</b> not their programs. Considering this, a dialogues form of campaign is offered for repairing ineffective political communication between party and people. Dialogical campaigns establish a two-way-communication between party and public, provide ways to clearly communicate problems surrounding the whole situation packaged with party 2 ̆ 7 s point of view and its solutions. By conducting dialogical campaign which reflected a-two-way- communication, campaigners and policymakers would benefit from the exchange of public aspirations along the process...|$|R

40|$|Oppositional-defiant {{disorder}} (ODD) {{refers to}} a recurrent pattern of negativistic, defiant, disobedient, and hostile behavior <b>toward</b> authority <b>figures.</b> Research has shown that children with ODD and comorbid mood disorders may be at particular risk for long-term adverse outcomes, including conduct disorder. In this study, the authors examined {{the effectiveness of a}} cognitive–behavioral model of intervention—called collaborative problem solving (CPS) —in comparison with parent training (PT) in 47 affectively dysregulated children with ODD. Results indicate that CPS produced significant improvements across multiple domains of functioning at posttreatment and at 4 -month follow-up. These improvements were in all instances equivalent, and in many instances superior, to the improvements produced by PT. Implications of these findings for further research on and treatment selection in children with ODD are discussed. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4 th ed.; DSM–IV; American Psychiatric Association, 1994), oppositional-defiant disorder (ODD) {{refers to a}} recurrent childhood pattern of developmentally inappropriate levels of neg-ativistic, defiant, disobedient, and hostile behavior <b>toward</b> author-ity <b>figures.</b> ODD-related behaviors have been shown to hav...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} attitudes and behavioral intentions of eight-grade students <b>toward</b> <b>figures</b> (representing hypothetical peers) of varying body weight (average, overweight, and obese). The primary {{aim of this}} study was to investigate how weight impacts students’ attitudes toward and interactions with peers. Second, impact of the rater’s gender was explored. It was hypothesized that girls would rate average-weight figures more positively than overweight figures and overweight figures more positively than obese figures. It was also hypothesized that boys would rate average-weight figures more positively than overweight and obese figures, with less discrepancy between their ratings of overweight and obese figures. One-hundred seventy primarily Caucasian, eight-grade students (72 male, 98 female; mean age = 13. 61, SD =. 49) were identified as part of a convenience sample from a public elementary school and were randomly assigned to view a target photo of their same gender in one of three conditions: average-weight, overweight, obese. Participants rated attitudes <b>toward</b> the <b>figures</b> on the Adjective Checklist and behavioral intentions on the Shared Activity Questionnaire-B (SAQ-B). Results showed the hypotheses to be partially supported. Students’ responses on the SAQ-B showed they were statistically significantly more willing to interact with an overweight peer (M = 16. 33, SD = 4. 19) than an obese peer (M = 14. 30, SD = 3. 83) for active-recreational activities. The overall effect size (males and females combined) was moderate (. 51), with a small effect size for females (. 42) and a moderate effect size for males (. 64). There were no other statistically significant differences on the SAQ-B subscales of active-recreational, academic, and social, or on the Adjective Checklist. Although differences were not significant, effect sizes for social domain for average versus obese and overweight versus obese were mostly small to medium. Conversely, almost all effect sizes for academic were nonmeaningful. Therefore, it appears weight has less impact in academic interactions than the other two areas. Effect sizes were larger for males than females for overweight versus obese on the Adjective Checklist and SAQ-B social and active recreational, showing that males tended to hold more negative views of obesity than females in these areas...|$|R

Then-unknown political consultant James Carville commissioned the creation of commercials that emphasized Scranton's use of recreational drugs as a college student and his open practice of transcendental meditation; as a result, Casey appeared as the more socially conservative candidate, which helped him to garner a surprisingly high vote total in rural regions of the state.|$|R
