5|$|As Warden, and {{afterwards}} Master, of the Royal Mint, Newton estimated that 20 {{percent of the}} coins taken in during the Great Recoinage of 1696 were counterfeit. Counterfeiting was high treason, punishable by the felon being hanged, drawn and quartered. Despite this, convicting even the most flagrant criminals could be extremely difficult. However, Newton proved equal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>task.</b>|$|E

5|$|Already 40 years old, Bacon {{viewed the}} {{exhibition}} as his last chance and applied himself <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>task</b> with determination. Because he had destroyed all his {{output of the}} last three years, he {{had little choice but to}} present new works. He did not have a grand plan when he agreed to the show, but eventually found themes that interested him in his Head I of the previous year, and executed five progressively stronger variants in the final weeks before the November exhibition, completing the series barely in time for the opening.|$|E
5|$|Another problem {{exposed by}} Rolling Thunder was the unpreparedness of the Air Force for the {{operations}} it was undertaking. Its aircraft {{had been designed}} and its pilots trained for strategic operations against the Soviet Union – for nuclear, not conventional war. The new campaign exposed years of neglect in conventional tactics, while aircraft capabilities and armament were ill-suited <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>task</b> at hand. The Air Force was also embarrassed {{by the fact that}} the Navy was better prepared. It possessed the only all-weather bomber in the U.S. inventory in the new A-6 Intruder and was also responsible for the development of the F-4 Phantom fighter-bomber, which became ubiquitous during the Vietnam War.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from these}} more {{spectacular}} pieces of resistance, {{in some places}} chantry priests continued to say prayers and landowners to pay them to do so. Opposition to the removal of images was widespread—so much so that when during the Commonwealth, William Dowsing was commissioned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>task</b> of image breaking in Suffolk, his task, as he records it, was enormous. In Kent and the southeast, compliance was mostly willing and for many, the sale of vestments and plate {{was an opportunity to}} make money (but it was also true that in London and Kent, Reformation ideas had permeated more deeply into popular thinking).|$|E
5|$|At Easter, 1151, Theobald {{took over}} the {{management}} of the chapter's estates, as the new prior, Walter Parvus, was not up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>task.</b> At first, there were no disputes, but soon the monks felt that Theobald was cheating them and imposing too rigorous a definition of poverty, and asked that the stewardship of the estates be restored to Parvus. Theobald refused and the monks attempted to appeal to the papacy. Their envoys, however, were caught by agents of the archbishop and the appeal went nowhere. Theobald then deposed Parvus and appointed a new prior. Theobald's relations with the monks after this point seem to have been without incident.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the war, Australia's {{military}} forces were focused upon the militia and what Regular forces existed were mostly serving in the artillery or engineers and were assigned in most part <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>task</b> of coastal defence. Due to the provisions of the Defence Act 1903, which precluded sending conscripts overseas, upon the outbreak of war it was realised that a totally separate, all volunteer force would need to be raised. This force was known as the Australian Imperial Force (AIF).|$|E

5|$|Captain Merrill T. Kinnecommander of the Port Chicago {{facility}} {{at the time}} of the explosionhad served in the Navy from 1915 to 1922 and had returned to the Navy from civilian life in 1941 to be posted aboard a general cargo ship. Prior to his being sent to command Port Chicago, Kinne had no training in the loading of munitions and very little experience in handling them. White loading officers serving underneath Kinne had not been trained in supervising enlisted personnel or in handling munitions until they had been posted to Mare Island Navy Yard, after which they were considered adequate <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>task</b> by the Navy.|$|E
5|$|Cray had {{intended}} to use gallium arsenide circuitry in the Cray-2, which would not only offer much higher switching speeds but also used less energy and thus ran cooler as well. At the time the Cray-2 was being designed, the state of GaAs manufacturing simply was not up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>task</b> of supplying a supercomputer. By the mid-1980s, things had changed and Cray decided {{it was the only}} way forward. Given a lack of investment on the part of large chip makers, Cray decided to invest in a GaAs chipmaking startup, GigaBit Logic, and use them as an internal supplier.|$|E
5|$|Distressed by the {{occupation}} of Khafji, Saudi commander General Khaled bin Sultan appealed to American General Norman Schwarzkopf for an immediate air campaign against Iraqi forces {{in and around the}} city. However this was turned down because the buildings would make it difficult for aircraft to spot targets without getting too close. It was instead decided that the city would be retaken by Arab ground forces. The task fell to the 2nd Saudi Arabian National Guard Brigade's 7th Battalion, composed of Saudi infantry and two Kuwaiti tank companies attached <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>task</b> force. These were supported by U.S. Army Special Forces and Marine Reconnaissance personnel.|$|E

5|$|During 1913-19, {{advocates of}} woman {{suffrage}} {{drew on the}} educational and advertising techniques of the national parties and the lobbying tactics of the women's club movement. They also tapped into popular culture, successfully using popular symbolism and traditional ideals to adapt community festivals and social gatherings <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>task</b> of political persuasion. The Dallas Equal Suffrage Association developed a suffrage campaign based on social values and community standards. Community and social occasions served as recruiting opportunities for the suffrage cause, blunting its radical implications with the familiarity of customary events and dressing it in the values of traditional female behavior, especially propriety.|$|E
5|$|During {{the final}} days of Operation Goodwood Royal Navy {{planners}} decided not to order further Fleet Air Arm operations against Kaafjord. The planners accepted that the Germans were now able to cover Tirpitz in smoke before Barracudas could reach the battleship, and these aircraft could not carry bombs large enough to inflict heavy damage. Further consideration was given to attacking Kaafjord using Mosquitos launched from aircraft carriers, but the light bombers continued to be in short supply and it was judged that they were not well suited <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>task.</b> Moreover, there was a growing need to transfer the carriers to the Pacific to strengthen Britain's contribution to the war against Japan.|$|E
5|$|Guitarist Chris Poland {{and drummer}} Gar Samuelson had been {{expelled}} from the band following {{the conclusion of the}} Peace Sells tour for disruptive behavior, including Poland's habit of pawning band equipment to pay for drugs.

At first, the band hired guitarist Jay Reynolds from the band Malice, but Reynolds was not up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>task</b> of recording, and was subsequently replaced by his guitar teacher, Jeff Young. Dave Mustaine has since stated his regret for the way he handled Reynolds's firing.|$|E
