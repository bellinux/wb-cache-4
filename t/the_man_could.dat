5|$|Blamey became {{involved}} in his first and greatest scandal soon after taking office. During a raid on a brothel in Fitzroy on 21 October 1925, the police encountered a man who produced Blamey's police badge, No. 80. Blamey later {{said that he had}} given his key ring, which included his badge, to a friend who had served with him in France, so that <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>could</b> help himself to some alcohol in Blamey's locker at the Naval and Military Club. His story was corroborated by his friend Stanley Savige, who was with him at the time. Blamey protected the man in question, who he said was married with children, and refused to identify him. The man has never been identified, but the description given by the detectives and the brothel owner did not match Blamey.|$|E

25|$|By law and custom, Muscovite Russia was {{a patriarchal}} society that subordinated women to men, {{and the young}} to their elders. Peter the great relaxed the second custom, but not the {{subordination}} of women. A decree of 1722 explicitly forbade any forced marriages by requiring both bride and groom to consent, while parental permission still remained a requirement. But during Peter's reign, only <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>could</b> get rid of his wife by putting her in a nunnery.|$|E
25|$|To {{start off}} the {{procedures}} the male intending to marry goes through Ukuthwalwa which entails him choosing his future bride and making his intentions of marriage known. In modern day, {{the man and}} woman would most likely have been in courtship or a relationship prior to Ukuthwalwa. Decades before Ukuthwalwa would entail legal bridal abduction, where <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>could</b> choose a woman of his liking to be his bride and go into negotiations with the family of the bride without her knowledge or consent. She would have to abide to the marriage as per tradition.|$|E
25|$|For Taoists, sex was {{not just}} about {{pleasing}} the man. The woman also had to be stimulated and pleased in order {{to benefit from the}} act of sex. Sex should not happen if one or the other partners desire it more. If sex were performed in this manner, the woman would create more jing, and <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>could</b> more easily absorb the jing to increase his own qi. Women were also given a prominent place in the Ishinpō, with the tutor being a woman. One of the reasons women {{had a great deal of}} strength in the act of sex was that they walked away undiminished from the act. The woman had the power to bring forth life, and did not have to worry about ejaculation or refractory period.|$|E

25|$|In the {{continuation}} of the reading, Moses instructed that when the Israelites had settled in the land, they were to divide the land into three parts and set aside three Cities of Refuge, so that any manslayer could have a place to which to flee. And if the Israelites faithfully observed all the law and God enlarged the territory, then they were to add three more towns to those three. Only a manslayer who had killed another unwittingly, without being the other's enemy, might flee there and live. For instance, if a man went with his neighbor into a grove to cut wood, and as he swung an axe, the axe-head flew off the handle and struck and killed the neighbor, then <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>could</b> flee to one of the cities of refuge and live.

25|$|Carmine Avellino – current {{captain in}} the Lucchese family. He is the brother of Salvatore Avellino who was the driver of {{deceased}} Lucchese crime family boss Tony Ducks Corallo. He {{is alleged to have}} been the trigger man in a double-murder dating back to 1989. Avellino was sent to prison for conspiracy to commit extortion from 1997 to 2004. In 2014, Avellino was charged with ordering two Lucchese family associates to assault a 70-year-old man over a late payment of $100,000 in 2010. When <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>could</b> not pay the remainder of the debt, 3 of the associates and member' used intimidation and threats of violence to obtain the payment. On August 12, 2016, Avellino was the last to plead guilty, Daniel and Michael Capra plead had plead guilty earlier. On May 23, 2017, Avellino was sentenced to 1 year of house arrest, 5 years probation and fined $100,000. His lawyer said at the trial that Avellino has suffered 2 heart attacks and is suffering from Parkinson's disease.|$|E
25|$|Just before Centaur {{left the}} rock, {{a party of}} slaves made a clandestine visit at night to trade fruits and bananas. They brought the news that a French {{lieutenant}} colonel of engineers had arrived at their plantation to survey the heights opposite for a mortar battery with which to shell the rock. One of the slaves had been sold by his English owner to the French when the owner left the islands. He did not like his new master and claimed {{the protection of the}} British flag. Hood granted him that protection, and promised that <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>could</b> serve in the Royal Navy as a free man in return for guiding a landing party to his now-former master's house. A 23-man landing party, including the guide, and under Lieutenant Reynolds, landed at midnight, walked the four kilometers to the plantation house, and took the engineer and 17 soldiers prisoner, before returning safely to Centaur. Apparently the lieutenant colonel was the only engineer on Martinique, and so no mortar battery materialized.|$|E

500|$|After Edson's Ridge, he {{was placed}} {{in command of the}} 5th Marine Regiment. In this capacity, {{he was one of the}} primary leaders in the Matanikau actions from September 23 to October 9, 1942. [...] He also {{commanded}} the 5th Marines during the Battle for Henderson Field and until the regiment was withdrawn from Guadalcanal, along with the rest of the 1st Marine Division, in November 1942. Shortly after, another officer stated [...] "that officers and men would willingly follow him anywhere—the only problem was to keep up with him". A combat correspondent testified that [...] "he is not a fierce Marine. In fact he appears almost shy. Yet Colonel Edson is probably among the five finest combat commanders in all the United States armed forces." [...] It was also said that he was not readily given to a show of emotion but when his personal runner of several months' service was killed at the Matanikau River on Guadalcanal, witnesses said he [...] "cried like a baby", and later stated that <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>could</b> never be replaced.|$|E

[...] England's 1966 FIFA World Cup-winning captain Bobby Moore commented: [...] "Pelé was the most {{complete}} player I've ever seen, he had everything. Two good feet. Magic in the air. Quick. Powerful. Could beat people with skill. Could outrun people. Only five feet and eight inches tall, yet he seemed a giant of an athlete on the pitch. Perfect balance and impossible vision. He was the greatest because he could do anything and everything on a football pitch. I remember Saldhana the coach being asked by a Brazilian journalist who was the best goalkeeper in his squad. He said Pelé. <b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>could</b> play in any position". Former Manchester United striker and member of England's 1966 FIFA World Cup-winning team Sir Bobby Charlton stated; [...] "I sometimes feel as though football was invented for this magical player." [...] During the 1970 World Cup, a British television commentator asked; [...] "How do you spell Pelé?", with the response; [...] "Easy: G-O-D." ...|$|E
2500|$|Among the Chu, {{there was}} a man selling shields and spears. He praised the former saying, [...] "My shields are so solid nothing can {{penetrate}} them".

2500|$|Another {{important}} {{concept of}} [...] "The Joining of the Essences" [...] {{was that the}} union {{of a man and}} a woman would result in the creation of jing, a type of sexual energy. When in the act of lovemaking, jing would form, and <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>could</b> transform some of this jing into qi, and replenish his lifeforce. By having as much sex as possible, men had the opportunity to transform more and more jing, and as a result would see many health benefits.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{different}} methods to control ejaculation prescribed by the Taoists. In {{order to avoid}} ejaculation, <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>could</b> do one of several things. He could pull out immediately before orgasm, a method which Joseph Needham termed [...] "coitus conservatus". A second method involved the man applying pressure on the perineum, thus retaining the sperm. While, if done incorrectly can cause a retrograde ejaculation, the Taoists believed that the jing traveled up into the head and [...] "nourished the brain." ...|$|E

2500|$|Flynn was {{reunited with}} Davis, Curtiz, and de Havilland in The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex (1939), playing Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex. Flynn's {{relationship}} with Davis during filming was quarrelsome; Davis allegedly slapped {{him across the}} face far harder than necessary during one scene. Flynn attributed her anger to unrequited romantic interest, but according to others, Davis resented sharing equal billing with a man she considered incapable of playing any role beyond a dashing adventurer. [...] "He himself openly said, 'I don't know really anything about acting'", she told an interviewer, [...] "and I admire his honesty, because he's absolutely right." [...] Years later, however, de Havilland recounted that during a private screening of Elizabeth and Essex, an astounded Davis exclaimed, [...] "Damn it! <b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>could</b> act!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Prior to the {{emergence}} of Islam, the Arabian Peninsula was characterized by a wide range of marriage practices—both polygynous and polyandrous alike, as well as monogamous. As Leila Ahmed states in her work, Women and Gender in Islam, [...] "evidence suggests that among the types of marriage practiced was matrilineal, uxorilocal marriage, found in Arabia, including Mecca, about the time of the birth of Muhammad (circa 570)--the woman remaining with her tribe, where <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>could</b> visit or reside with her, and the children belonging to the mother's tribe--as well as polyandrous and polygamous marriages." [...] Thus, it is widely accepted that polygyny was not the only type of matrimony practiced during the jahiliyya (pre-Islamic era), but one part of a highly variegated and diverse pool of matrimony types.|$|E
2500|$|Since the 19th century, {{likely due to}} The Great Hunger, {{the name}} Tubridy spread out from County Clare into the New World as well as across the Irish Sea to Great Britain.

In the myth specifically related to the Tubridys the tale says, a Spaniard who survived the sinking was swept ashore the West Coast of Clare, was given refuge by a woman surnamed O'Riada, hiding in a dry well near her house. As <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>could</b> not speak either English or Irish, he was known as [...] "O'Tiobraide", meaning in English [...] "of the well of Reidy(O'Riada)". [...] Modern genetic tests show a strong connection between Irish people and the Basques, with the gene patterns passed down through the male line of the two described as [...] "strikingly similar".|$|E
