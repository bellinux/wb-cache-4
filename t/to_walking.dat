5|$|The {{relative}} size of {{the hands}} and feet in pterosaurs (by comparison with modern animals such as birds) may indicate the type of lifestyle pterosaurs led on the ground. Azhdarchid pterosaurs had relatively small feet compared to their body size and leg length, with foot length only about 25%â€“30% {{the length of the}} lower leg. This suggests that azhdarchids were better adapted <b>to</b> <b>walking</b> on dry, relatively solid ground. Pteranodon had slightly larger feet (47% the length of the tibia), while filter-feeding pterosaurs like the ctenochasmatoids had very large feet (69% of tibial length in Pterodactylus, 84% in Pterodaustro), adapted <b>to</b> <b>walking</b> in soft muddy soil, similar to modern wading birds.|$|E

5|$|The {{middle toe}} is greatly elongated, and the hind one is only {{slightly}} developed, while the talons of all the toes are comparatively straight and blunt. The feet are thus more adapted <b>to</b> <b>walking,</b> and are of little use as weapons or organs of prehension as in birds of prey and Old World vultures. The beak is hooked, and adapted to tear rotting meat. The irises of the male are brown, while those of the female are deep red. The eyelids lack eyelashes. Contrary to the usual rule for sexual dimorphism among birds of prey, the female is smaller than the male.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Assessing {{the contextual}} factors that {{influence}} walking for transportation is important to develop more walkable environments and promote physical activity. To advance previous research focused on residential environments and overall walking for transportation, {{the present study investigates}} objective environmental factors assessed around the residence, the workplace, the home [...] work itinerary, and the home [...] supermarket itinerary, and considered overall walking for transportation but also <b>walking</b> <b>to</b> work and to shops. METHODS: Data from the RECORD Study involving 7290 participants recruited in 2007 - 2008, aged 30 - 79 years, and residing in the Paris metropolitan area were analyzed. Multilevel ordinal regression analyses were conducted to investigate environmental characteristics associated with self-reported overall walking for transportation, <b>walking</b> <b>to</b> work, and <b>walking</b> <b>to</b> shops. RESULTS: High individual education was associated with overall walking for transportation, with <b>walking</b> <b>to</b> work, and <b>walking</b> <b>to</b> shops. Among workers, a high residential neighborhood education was associated with increased overall walking for transportation, while a high workplace neighborhood education was related to an increased time spent <b>walking</b> <b>to</b> work. The residential density of destinations was positively associated with overall walking for transportation, with <b>walking</b> <b>to</b> work, and with <b>walking</b> <b>to</b> shops, while the workplace density of destinations was positively associated with overall walking for transportation among workers. Environmental factors assessed around the itineraries were not associated with <b>walking</b> <b>to</b> work or to the shops. CONCLUSION: This research improves our understanding {{of the role of the}} environments on walking for transportation by accounting for some of the environments visited beyond the residential neighborhood. It shows that workers' walking habits are more influenced by the density of destinations around the workplace than around the residence. These results provide insight for the development of policies and programs to encourage population level active commuting...|$|R
5|$|The {{middle toe}} of the California condor's foot is greatly elongated, and the hind one is only {{slightly}} developed. The talons of all the toes are straight and blunt, and are thus more adapted <b>to</b> <b>walking</b> than gripping. This is more similar to their supposed relatives the storks than to birds of prey and Old World vultures, which use their feet as weapons or organs of prehension.|$|E
5|$|Imprisonment is {{considered}} any restraint on {{the freedom of}} movement, for however short a time. In Austin and another v Metropolitan Police Commissioner, seven hours was considered a sufficient {{period of time to}} constitute false imprisonment (although the claim was ultimately rejected due to the circumstances of a potentially hostile crowd of demonstrators). The requirement is complete restraint; in Bird v Jones, the defendant fenced off part of a footpath for use as a viewing point for a boat race. The claimant, accustomed <b>to</b> <b>walking</b> across it, climbed into the enclosure; the defendants refused to let him pass. They were found not liable for false imprisonment, as another way across existed. There is on the other hand no requirement that the claimant actually attempt to leave, as in Grainger v Hill, or even that he knows he is being prevented from leaving, as in Meering v Graham-White Aviation Co Ltd.|$|E
5|$|The ship {{dropped the}} torch off in Bari at 12:30pm on 19 July. It was run north through several Italian cities before {{crossing}} the Simplon Pass into Brig, Switzerland on 23 July. From {{there it was}} run west until leaving the country at Perly-Certoux, and entering France at Saint-Julien-en-Genevois. The route then detours from the direct route to take in Luxembourg and into Belgium before re-entering France at Lille on 28 July, finally departing the country at Calais. HMS Bicester carried the torch across the English Channel to Dover, arriving at 8:25pm on 28 July. It travelled through several towns in the South East of England until it arrived at Wembley, where it arrived only thirty seconds late after the entire journey. That delay may have only been in the final few hundred yards of the relay down Olympic Way outside of Empire Stadium as {{the pressure of the}} crowds on the torch carrier and their escorts reduced the pace <b>to</b> <b>walking</b> speed. Special celebrations were held at each border crossing, and at Pierre de Coubertin's tomb in Lausanne, Switzerland.|$|E

5|$|As the game's {{emphasis}} is on stealth, players are encouraged to focus on concealment, evasion, distraction, misdirection, and subtle takedowns, rather than on outright confrontation; the player's character can engage in sword-based combat when the need arises, and can perform three different attacks as well as parrying, but has limited proficiency and damage resistance in such circumstances. To do so, players must remain aware of their surroundings. To assist them in remaining hidden, a special meter on the heads-up display (HUD), {{in the form of}} a gem, helps to indicates the player's visibility to NPCs; the brighter it is, the more easier they can be visually detected, thus sticking to dark, shady spots where the gem dims, ensures the player is hidden, though NPCs can still find them if they get to close in front of them. To remain quiet, players must be careful of how much noise they produce, as well as what surfaces they are moving over; walking on soft surfaces like carpets and grass, is preferable as footsteps remain quiet, compared <b>to</b> <b>walking</b> over metal floors and ceramic tiles, which produce a lot of noise. NPCs also produce noise, either from whistling, or walking about for example, which can help player's determine where how far away they are to their own position. Noise can be used by the player to mislead/distract NPCs, such as throwing an object to lure them elsewhere.|$|E

25|$|However, when 1877 approached, dresses moulded {{to fit the}} figure, as {{increasing}} slimmer silhouettes were favoured.

25|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that young hadrosaurs would have walked on only their two hind legs, while adults would have walked on all four.

25|$|The Chattanooga Police Department {{dates from}} 1852. Starting in 1883, it hired black police officers, making Chattanooga {{one of the}} first major Southern cities to have them. But after the state {{legislature}} imposed segregation, black police officers were dropped from the force. They were hired again on a permanent basis beginning on August 11, 1948, years before other major cities in the Southeast, such as Birmingham, Alabama and Jackson, Mississippi, integrated their police departments. The first seven black officers in 1948, Thaddeus Arnold, Singer Askins, W.B. Baulridge, C.E. Black, Morris Glenn, Arthur Heard, and Thomas Patterson, were initially restricted <b>to</b> <b>walking</b> beats in black neighborhoods. In 1960, black police officers were authorized to patrol all neighborhoods and arrest white citizens.|$|E

Most {{of the rest of}} the main campus may be accessed using the B trains of the Green Line between the Blandford Street and Babcock Street stops. Crowding on the busy Commonwealth Avenue branch of the MBTA Green Line is very seasonal; during the summer, ridership falls by more than half, as some students leave and others arrive, and more riders switch <b>to</b> <b>walking</b> or bicycling. The South Campus area of campus can be accessed using the Fenway stop on the D trains.|$|E
25|$|With {{his health}} in decline, in 1948 Burdon moved from his farm to Wellington. He was {{contracted}} by the War History Branch, {{the section of}} the Department of Internal Affairs tasked with the production of a history of New Zealand's contribution to the Second World War, to produce an account of the 24th Battalion. One of several volumes of the Official History of New Zealand in the Second World War 1939â€“45, his book was published in 1953 and was followed two years later with a biography of Richard Seddon. A study of the Christchurch academic, Alexander Bickerton, was produced the next year. Having already had to resort <b>to</b> <b>walking</b> with the assistance of a cane for several years, his research abilities were becoming compromised by his physical condition, which affected his abilities to undertake serious archival work. In 1965, he produced The New Dominion, a social history of New Zealand from 1919 to 1939, but critics noted it was heavily based on newspapers and secondary sources.|$|E
