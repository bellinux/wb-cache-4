5|$|Henry Fuseli {{would later}} create {{one of the}} more famous portrayals of <b>the</b> <b>Three</b> Witches in 1783, {{entitled}} The Weird Sisters or <b>The</b> <b>Three</b> Witches. In it, the witches are lined up and dramatically pointing at something all at once, their faces in profile. This painting was parodied by James Gillray in 1791 in Weird Sisters; Ministers of Darkness; Minions of the Moon. Three figures are lined up with their faces in profile in a way similar to Fuseli's painting. However, <b>the</b> <b>three</b> figures are recognisable as Lord Dundas (the home secretary at the time), William Pitt (prime minister), and Lord Thurlow (Lord Chancellor). <b>The</b> <b>three</b> of them are facing a moon, which contains the profiled faces of George III and Queen Charlotte. The drawing is intended to highlight the insanity of King George and the unusual alliance of <b>the</b> <b>three</b> politicians.|$|E
