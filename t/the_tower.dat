5|$|The {{relevance}} of Strype's reference to <b>the</b> <b>Tower</b> {{was more than}} geographical.

5|$|All the WindSeekers have {{speakers}} {{mounted to}} the inside of the gondola structure. They play 18 different tracks, among which are Hedwig's theme from the Harry Potter films, the theme songs from E.T., , and Superman, and songs from Flight of the Valkyries. At Cedar Point and Kings Island, the WindSeeker sign changes colors during night operation. At Cedar Point, as the gondola makes its way up <b>the</b> <b>tower,</b> the LED lights at the top of <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> go out, making <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> invisible, though the LED lights on the gondola remains lit. When the gondola comes back down, the lights at the top of <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> come on again.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>towers</b> were {{originally}} designed to separate the men and women. <b>The</b> women's <b>tower</b> was <b>the</b> north <b>tower</b> and <b>the</b> men's <b>tower</b> was <b>the</b> south <b>tower.</b> <b>The</b> evidence of {{this used to be}} found in the bathrooms; <b>the</b> south <b>tower</b> had urinals but <b>the</b> north <b>tower</b> did not. <b>The</b> bathrooms of <b>the</b> south <b>tower</b> were renovated in 2006.

40|$|How were <b>the</b> Frankish <b>towers</b> in Greece used? This is the {{question}} that this thesis addressed by comparing <b>the</b> <b>towers</b> in Boeotia in Greece and <b>the</b> <b>towers</b> in West Europe. Before discussing <b>the</b> <b>towers</b> themselves, <b>the</b> settings and societies in which <b>the</b> <b>towers</b> were built were discussed. The feudal system, which was present in both societies, was not written down for the local aristocracy in Greece, which resulted in that aristocracy welcoming in the Franks who would give make their position of power legal. The chapters on <b>the</b> <b>towers</b> themselves were divided in three parts: origin, which dealt with how <b>the</b> <b>towers</b> came to be {{and when they were}} first built; Architecture, in which the physical appearance and features were discussed; and lastly the function-part which dealt with {{the question}} on how <b>the</b> <b>towers</b> were used. From the material evidence we can conclude that the main function of <b>the</b> <b>towers</b> was not military. The symbolic function seems to have been present in both <b>the</b> European <b>towers</b> and <b>the</b> Greek <b>towers,</b> though <b>the</b> European ones are way better dressed and the question remains why this was not deemed necessary or not possible in Greece. Although it was assumed that <b>the</b> <b>towers</b> were lived in by the different lords, the material seems to point towards the idea that <b>the</b> <b>towers</b> were not built for habitation. The lack of both lighting and heat would make continuous habitation uncomfortable at best. In the last chapter this data was combined to see where the differences and similarities were between <b>the</b> <b>towers,</b> this was followed by a possible explanation for these differences and similarities. The thesis concluded with the suggestion that the areas around <b>the</b> <b>towers</b> should be excavated to provide insight in possible other buildings around <b>the</b> <b>towers</b> which could provide a lot of information on the activities in and around <b>the</b> <b>towers...</b>|$|R
50|$|The Disneyland Hotel {{started a}} major {{renovation}} in 2009, beginning with <b>the</b> Dreams <b>Tower.</b> Renovation of <b>the</b> hotel included new windows, wallpaper, carpeting, and decor. <b>The</b> Dreams <b>Tower,</b> completed in 2010, became <b>the</b> Adventure <b>Tower.</b> <b>The</b> Wonder <b>Tower</b> became <b>the</b> Frontier <b>Tower</b> after its completion in 2011, and <b>the</b> Magic <b>Tower</b> became <b>the</b> Fantasy <b>Tower</b> in 2012.|$|R
5|$|Among those {{held and}} {{executed}} at <b>the</b> <b>Tower</b> was Anne Boleyn. Although the Yeoman Warders were once the Royal Bodyguard, by the 16th and 17thcenturies their main duty had become {{to look after}} the prisoners. <b>The</b> <b>Tower</b> was often a safer place than other prisons in London such as the Fleet, where disease was rife. High-status prisoners could live in conditions comparable to those they might expect outside; one such example was that while Walter Raleigh was held in <b>the</b> <b>Tower</b> his rooms were altered to accommodate his family, including his son who was born there in 1605. Executions were usually carried out on Tower Hill rather than in <b>the</b> <b>Tower</b> of London itself, and 112people were executed on the hill over 400years. Before the 20thcentury, there had been seven executions within the castle on Tower Green; {{as was the case with}} Lady Jane Grey, this was reserved for prisoners for whom public execution was considered dangerous. After Lady Jane Grey's execution on 12 February 1554, Queen MaryI imprisoned her sister Elizabeth, later Queen ElizabethI, in <b>the</b> <b>Tower</b> under suspicion of causing rebellion as Sir Thomas Wyatt had led a revolt against Mary in Elizabeth's name.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the heavy security, {{businesses}} around <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> had seen decreased patronage due to less foot traffic around the heavily secured area. Protests around <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> subsided after his inauguration in January 2017, and by summer 2017, the security measures around <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> had been loosened somewhat, owing to the fact that most security measures were implemented only when Trump was actually in <b>the</b> <b>tower.</b> However, several businesses at the tower's base had closed by then because of a {{reduction in the number of}} customers.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} many minor {{problems}} all WindSeekers had in 2011, the first major accident occurred on June 2, 2012, on the Cedar Point installation. According to numerous news and rider reports, WindSeeker operated normally as the gondola made its way up <b>the</b> <b>tower.</b> Attached to <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> and gondola are a set of electrical cables that are located inside a plastic casing and are secured by two side panels to prevent the cables from moving around. At the top of <b>the</b> <b>tower,</b> winds were reportedly strong enough to push the electrical cables out of the socket on <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> causing the cables to move around freely. According to a rider riding WindSeeker {{at the time of}} the accident, as the gondola made its way back down <b>the</b> <b>tower,</b> the cables got stuck in the rotating gondola. The plastic casing began to be ripped apart as well as the cables causing the ride to come to a complete stop just over halfway up <b>the</b> <b>tower.</b> Because the electrical cables had been damaged, Cedar Point employees had to manually bring down the gondola. Riders were stuck on the ride for over an hour and no one was injured. WindSeeker at Cedar Point remained closed until the cause of the accident was found and fixed. The ride reopened on June 5, 2012.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>towers</b> {{elicited}} mixed {{reactions from}} the general public when first unveiled. <b>The</b> <b>towers</b> were appreciated by some as modernist architectural icons. However, many Melbourne residents regarded <b>the</b> <b>towers</b> as eyesores and criticised their size and placement. <b>The</b> <b>towers</b> were considered to have cut the city off from the river and also detracted from Saint Paul's Cathedral and the heritage facades along Flinders Street. <b>The</b> <b>towers</b> were much larger {{than any of the}} surrounding buildings and were said to have dominated the surrounding context.|$|R
25|$|The first cables {{were hung}} from <b>the</b> <b>towers</b> in 2004â€”as a time-saving measure, {{this was done}} before <b>the</b> <b>towers</b> were wholly completed. Sections of the deck were built outward from each of <b>the</b> <b>towers</b> as more cables were hung.|$|R

5|$|At {{the end of}} the 16th century, the House of Lords {{began to}} use <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> to store its {{parliamentary}} records, building a house alongside it {{for the use of the}} parliamentary clerk, and extensive improvements followed in 1621. <b>The</b> <b>tower</b> continued as the Lords' records office through the 18th century, and several sets of renovations and building work were carried out to improve its fire-proofing and comfort, creating the current appearance of <b>the</b> <b>tower.</b> In 1834, <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> was one of only four buildings to survive a terrible fire in Westminster, and in the aftermath the records were moved to a new, purpose-built archive.|$|E
5|$|By the 19th century, <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> was {{obscured}} by the surrounding buildings, and was accessed through the brick-built office in front of it, according to the antiquarian and engraver John Smith. <b>The</b> <b>tower</b> began to become too small for storing all the House of Lords' records, and from 1827 onwards only the acts, journals and minute-books were kept in <b>the</b> <b>tower.</b>|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 19th century, the medieval {{structure}} of the property had become quite limiting for the owners. The buildings {{on either side of}} <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> were then pulled down to allow for the construction of Hall Farm, including a more modern farm house; only <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> survived to become an ancillary farm building. In 1973 the Lonsdale Estate, who owned Hall Farm, placed <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> into the guardianship of the Department of the Environment, who decided to open it to the public. An archaeological excavation of the site took place between 1977 and 1979, making it {{one of only a handful}} of such sites in Cumbria to have been investigated in this way. In the 21st century <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> is in the care of English Heritage as a tourist attraction, and is protected under UK law as a scheduled monument.|$|E
5000|$|The cathedral has twin 89 meter towers (with weather-vanes 92.31 m) {{referred}} to as <b>the</b> north <b>tower</b> and <b>the</b> south <b>tower.</b> Like several major romanesque churches, Bremen Cathedral has a second choir in <b>the</b> west. <b>The</b> <b>towers</b> were constructed flanking this western choir, forming the west {{front of the church}} since 1215 and 1253. In 1346 <b>the</b> <b>towers</b> were strengthened and given pyramidal tops of uneven heights.

50|$|In television, <b>the</b> <b>towers</b> were <b>the</b> {{headquarters}} of the fictional private detective Remington Steele, the main character of the eponymous NBC series, which ran from 1982 to 1987. Nearly every episode included an exterior establishing shot of <b>the</b> <b>towers.</b> <b>The</b> <b>towers</b> have also served as the backdrop for several television commercials, including adverts for Samsung, Buick, Volvo, and Kia Motors. In film, <b>the</b> <b>towers</b> were prominently featured in 2011's The Green Hornet.|$|R
50|$|The {{exterior}} of <b>the</b> <b>towers</b> is constructed of pre-cast reinforced concrete. The lower sections {{are faced with}} polished granite. All aluminum work has a dark anodized finish in a medium gray tone. A glass-enclosed walkway connects the four-story building to <b>the</b> <b>towers.</b> Like <b>the</b> <b>towers,</b> <b>the</b> low building's facade is made of concrete and glass. Overall, the exterior lacks ornamentation, instead displaying a stark functionality. Bands of windows wrap around the towers; corner windows have rounded edges. The bases of <b>the</b> <b>towers</b> have arcades with entrances set back beneath a covered area supported by piers. The tops of <b>the</b> <b>towers</b> are distinguished by metal louvers. An exposed glass atrium connects <b>the</b> two <b>towers</b> at <b>the</b> ground level. A glass-enclosed walkway connects the four-story building to <b>the</b> <b>towers.</b> Like <b>the</b> <b>towers,</b> <b>the</b> low building's facade is made of concrete and glass. Vertical slabs form piers that interrupt the horizontality {{of the building and}} create the off-center entrance, which is articulated by a cantilevered porch. A protruding second story creates a covered pathway to shelter visitors.|$|R
5|$|Certain {{events can}} take place while {{managing}} <b>the</b> <b>tower.</b> For example, terrorists may phone the player {{to let them know}} that they have hidden a bomb in the building, and that they demand a ransom. If the ransom is not paid, then security services must find the bomb before it detonates, or else <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> will incur significant damages. If the player builds facilities underground, the game may notify them that their workers have discovered gold treasure, which gives the player a significant amount of funds. At random intervals during the game, there are notifications that state that a VIP will be visiting <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> soon, so the player must prepare for their visit. If the VIP enjoys their visit because of variables such as a comfortable hotel suite and efficient navigation, the VIP will give <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> a favorable rating. A favorable rating would then allow <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> to advance to the next star level, assuming the other qualifications are met. Although it does not have any impact on <b>the</b> <b>tower,</b> at the end of the fourth quarter every year in the game, Santa Claus and his reindeer fly across <b>the</b> <b>tower.</b>|$|E
5|$|During Edward II's reign (1307â€“1327) {{there was}} {{relatively}} little activity at <b>the</b> <b>Tower</b> of London. However, {{it was during}} this period that the Privy Wardrobe was founded. The institution was based at <b>the</b> <b>Tower</b> and responsible for organising the state's arms. In 1321, Margaret de Clare, Baroness Badlesmere became the first woman imprisoned in <b>the</b> <b>Tower</b> of London after she refused Queen Isabella admittance to Leeds Castle and ordered her archers to fire upon Isabella, killing six of the royal escort. Generally reserved for high-ranking inmates, <b>the</b> <b>Tower</b> was the most important royal prison in the country. However it was not necessarily very secure, and throughout its history people bribed the guards to help them escape. In 1322 Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March, was aided in his escape from <b>the</b> <b>Tower</b> by the Sub-Lieutenant of <b>the</b> <b>Tower</b> who let Mortimer's men inside. They hacked a hole in his cell wall and Mortimer escaped to a waiting boat. He fled to France where he encountered Edward's Queen. They began an affair and plotted to overthrow the King. One of Mortimer's first acts on entering England was to capture <b>the</b> <b>Tower</b> and release the prisoners held there. For three years he ruled while EdwardIII was too young to do so himself; in 1330, Edward and his supporters captured Mortimer and threw him in <b>the</b> <b>Tower.</b> Under EdwardIII's rule (1312â€“1377) England experienced renewed success in warfare after his father's reign had put the realm on the backfoot against the Scots and French. Amongst Edward's successes were the battles of CrÃ©cy and Poitiers where King John II of France was taken prisoner, and the capture of the King David II of Scotland at Neville's Cross. During this period, <b>the</b> <b>Tower</b> of London held many noble prisoners of war. EdwardII had allowed <b>the</b> <b>Tower</b> of London to fall into a state of disrepair, and by the reign of EdwardIII the castle was an uncomfortable place. The nobility held captive within its walls were unable to engage in activities such as hunting which were permissible at other royal castles used as prisons, for instance Windsor. EdwardIII ordered that the castle should be renovated.|$|E

5|$|During {{the coming}} decades, however, the {{suitability}} of <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> {{for the work of}} the department came into question. The condition of the roof remained problematic, and steel girders had to be added to support the main timbers. Increasing traffic levels around <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> led to subsidence and high levels of vibration, effecting the operation of the delicate instruments, and worsened after the opening of Lambeth Bridge in 1932. Some of the department's work was transferred to their Bushy House facility in Teddington in the 1920s, and in 1938 the department relinquished <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> altogether.|$|E
5|$|During {{the course}} of its investigation, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) {{discovered}} that tower staffing levels at Blue Grass Airport violated an internal policy as reflected in a November 16, 2005, memorandum requiring two controllers during the overnight shift: one in <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> working clearance, ground, and tower frequencies, and another, either in <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> or remotely at Indianapolis Center, working TRACON (radar).
