5|$|After 1978, {{a number}} of astronomers kept up the search for Lowell's PlanetX, {{convinced}} <b>that,</b> <b>because</b> Pluto {{was no longer a}} viable candidate, an unseen tenth planet must have been perturbing the outer planets.|$|E

5|$|Insurers claimed <b>that</b> <b>because</b> {{they have}} access to and collect patient data that allow {{evaluations}} of interventions, they are essential to ACO success. Large insurers formed their own ACOs. Many hospitals merged and purchased physician practices. The increased market share gave them more leverage in negotiations with insurers over costs and reduced patient care options.|$|E
5|$|It was {{reported}} in January 2012 <b>that</b> <b>because</b> of arthritis {{and the effects of}} an old spinal injury he was no longer able to operate a telescope. However, he was still able to present The Sky at Night from his home.|$|E
5|$|Matt Baggott—who when Madeleine {{disappeared}} {{was chief}} constable of Leicestershire Police, {{the force that}} coordinated the British side of the case—told the inquiry <b>that,</b> <b>because</b> the Portuguese {{were in charge of}} the case, he had made a decision not to correct reporters. His force's priority, he said, was to maintain a good relationship with the Polícia Judiciária with a view to finding Madeleine.|$|E

5|$|On the Matoikas {{third and}} final return voyage from Italy, begun on 17May, U.S. Customs Service agents at New York seized $150,000 worth of cocaine—along with {{valuable}} silks and jewels—being smuggled into the United States. Officials speculated <b>that</b> <b>because</b> of a maritime strike, members of a smuggling ring were able to infiltrate {{the crew of the}} ship.|$|E

5|$|Reflective of the {{documentary}} theme, Yamaguchi saw the album expressing {{the ups and downs}} of regular days, more so than previous albums. Despite the inspiration taken from the heavy events of the earthquake, Yamaguchi felt <b>that</b> <b>because</b> the album featured three singles that were tailored to be heard by a wide audience, which pushed the album into a brighter sound.|$|E

5|$|Some {{historians have}} commented on this failure; Gerard Devlin argues <b>that</b> <b>because</b> of {{this lack of}} {{aircraft}} the remaining two divisions were forced to shoulder the operation by themselves.|$|E
5|$|The E-1s {{came off}} the {{production}} line in February 1938, {{in time for a}} number of these aircraft to serve in the Condor Legion during the Spanish Civil War in March 1938. The RLM thought <b>that</b> <b>because</b> the E variant could outrun enemy fighters in Spain, {{there was no need to}} upgrade the defensive weaponry, which would prove to be a mistake in later years.|$|E
5|$|The first argues <b>that</b> <b>because</b> {{there is}} no medieval {{documentary}} evidence, then the Giant {{was created in the}} 17th century, perhaps by Lord Holles, who resided in Cerne Abbas, and perhaps as a parody of Oliver Cromwell.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the varied}} mix of {{cultures}} in Darjeeling, {{the local and}} ethnic food of Darjeeling is also quite varied. Rice, noodle and potatoes seems to make the dominant part <b>that's</b> <b>because</b> <b>that</b> suits well with the cool climate in there.|$|R

5|$|A {{localized}} {{earthquake in}} New York City damages only one building, killing nearly all inside. The Fringe team discovers {{that a second}} building appeared at the same location as the first, fusing the structure and people inside together. Walter (John Noble) realizes that the second building has been pulled from the parallel universe by Thomas Jerome Newton, using the technology that Walter and William Bell had discovered years ago. Walter warns <b>that</b> <b>because</b> of conservation of mass, a building of similar mass will be taken from the prime universe to the parallel one {{sometime in the next}} few days.|$|E
5|$|After seeing Ned Flanders reject {{an offer}} from a crooked cable man to get an illegal cable hook-up for $50, Homer chases after the cable man and takes the offer. Homer likes the new {{channels}} and {{spends a lot of}} time watching the television along with his family. Lisa, however, feels suspicious about the cable hook-up. Following a Sunday school lesson regarding the existence and nature of Hell, Lisa becomes terrified of violations of the Ten Commandments, the adherence to which she is assured will keep one's soul safe from Hell. She fears <b>that</b> <b>because</b> Homer violated the Eighth Commandment, he will go to Hell when he dies.|$|E
5|$|After the Japanese {{occupied}} the Dutch East Indies in 1942, Soeman {{was made a}} school supervisor by occupying forces. He soon became involved in politics, being elected to the Shūsangikai, a Japanese-sponsored regional representatives' council, for Riau. He later recalled <b>that,</b> <b>because</b> he had been elected rather than selected by the Japanese forces—and thus had strong backing among the community, {{which could be used}} for revolution—he had felt as though he was under constant surveillance. This situation continued until after the Japanese withdrew from Indonesia and Sukarno proclaimed an independent Indonesia.|$|E

5|$|Although Sedna {{is officially}} {{considered}} a scattered-disc object by the MPC, its discoverer Michael E. Brown has suggested <b>that</b> <b>because</b> its perihelion distance of 76 AU is too distant {{to be affected}} by the gravitational attraction of the outer planets it should be considered an inner-Oort-cloud object rather than a member of the scattered disc. This classification of Sedna as a detached object is accepted in recent publications.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the chronicle}} {{indirectly}} implies that Rögnvaldr {{was also a}} son of Finnguala, {{there is evidence that}} strongly suggests that he had a different mother. Within a letter from Óláfr to HenryII, King of England, Óláfr describes Rögnvaldr as a bastard. Further evidence is found within a Gaelic praise-poem of Rögnvaldr, which states that he was a son of Sadb, an otherwise unknown Irishwoman who may have been an unrecorded wife or concubine of Guðrøðr. The chronicle records <b>that</b> <b>because</b> Óláfr was only a child {{at the time of his}} father's death, the Manxmen chose Rögnvaldr to rule instead, describing him as a vigorous and hardier man. The chronicle states that Rögnvaldr began his reign the following year, in 1188.|$|E
5|$|Another {{factor in}} Wallace's {{thinking}} was his belief <b>that,</b> <b>because</b> {{of the action}} of natural selection, organisms were {{in a state of}} balance with their environment, and that everything in nature, even disease-causing organisms, served a useful purpose in the natural order of things; he feared vaccination might upset that natural balance with unfortunate results. Wallace and other anti-vaccinationists pointed out that vaccination, which at the time was often done in a sloppy and unsanitary manner, could be dangerous.|$|E
