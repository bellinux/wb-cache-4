25|$|Louis {{started making}} chocolates {{in his kitchen}} for friends and family, but when he started selling the chocolates to local businesses, he had to move the {{operation}} to the garage. Chokolit was founded in 2005 and funded with a local grant of £5,000 and a £500 loan from his grandparents to buy a special machine that regulates chocolate temperature. The name of the company was chosen because <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> used to spell chocolate due to his dyslexia.|$|E
25|$|In sources, Ardashir's {{religious}} {{relations and}} his father being a cleric are mentioned; {{so it can be}} deduced that Ardashir had no connections with royal houses and was only a cleric's son who knew about religion, but was not a cleric himself; and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>he,</b> by his religious knowledge, found the chance to be the first person in his inscriptions receiving the royal ring from Ahura Mazda, something a Persian nobleman did not need and only a newcomer had to claim to be from the line of gods. It should be mentioned that it was not precedent to Ardashir to take a royal ring from Ahura Mazda, and it is not seen even in Achaemenid inscriptions.|$|E
2500|$|Starting in November 2015, in {{connection}} with his presidential campaign, Sanders's announcements suggested {{that not only was}} he running as a Democrat, but that he would run as a Democrat in future elections. When challenged by Clinton about his party commitment, he said, [...] "Of course I am a Democrat and running for the Democratic nomination." [...] During the campaign, news sources often referred to him as a Democrat. Since he remained a senator, elected as an independent, the United States Senate website continued to refer to Sanders as an independent during the campaign and upon his return to the Senate. He confirmed {{at the end of the}} campaign that he remained an independent in the senate for the balance of his term, since <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> was elected.|$|E

One working on concentration needs strong unification, since <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> reaches absorption; and one working on insight needs strong understanding, since <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> reaches penetration of characteristics; but with the balancing of the two he reaches absorption as well."

2500|$|After being a stalwart of chat shows, in {{the mid-1980s}} Monkhouse {{presented}} his own for the BBC, The Bob Monkhouse Show. The show lasted two series and showcased comedians of every age. Monkhouse was criticised for sycophancy towards his guests but {{said that they were}} all heroes of his and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> really felt about them. Monkhouse was known as a keen supporter of new comedy and he used the show to introduce audiences to new comedians such as Kelly Monteith, Robin Williams and Jim Carrey. The format of the interviews varied between [...] "true" [...] chat and analysis of comedy, to scripted routines in which Monkhouse would willingly play the role of the guest's stooge as he did with Bob Hope. On one occasion the guest was the comedian Pamela Stephenson who, after prior arrangement with the show's producer, appeared in a series of fake plaster casts, apparently the result of accidents whilst at home. During the interview she produced a handgun and fired it on several occasions, destroying a plant pot on the set and a series of lights in the studio roof. She then presented a rocket launcher which she promptly [...] "fired" [...] destroying a camera. The gun, launcher and camera were props. None of this was known to Monkhouse who appeared genuinely frightened (although the production crew were aware).|$|E
2500|$|Dillahunt took {{inspiration}} from Andrew Cunanan, {{the man who}} killed Gianni Versace, when he recalled the brutality in which Cunanan murdered a man just for his car. Dillahunt recalls how an FBI profiler noted that this type of rage is typically directed toward someone the perpetrator knows, yet Cunanan managed to pull some element from his own life and place it on this random person who attempted to stand his ground against the would-be carjacker. To Dillahunt, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> wanted to approach Krug. To him, Mari actually shows that she is not afraid of Krug, which causes him to go [...] "crazy". That being said, the actor felt like the scene where his character rapes Mari was {{one of the hardest things}} emotionally to film. He notes that part of him was happy that Sara Paxton was cast as Mari, because they had worked together in the past, so they knew each other. On the other hand, he felt uncomfortable acting out such a scene with a person he considered to be a friend. Paxton echoed his sentiments to Craven, who stated the actress expressed to him a greater feeling of trust that the person who would have to do these [...] "horrible" [...] things to her was someone she knew, and as a result made them at least partially more bearable to act.|$|E

60|$|Robert merely laughed. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> {{took the}} scorn and {{condemnation}} of his fellow-men. He had goaded them to desperation with his shameless depravity till they spoke openly of putting {{him to a}} violent death, and he laughed.|$|E

60|$|And <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> {{tried to}} dismiss her. He {{never thought of}} her personally. Everything deep in him he denied.

Sometimes, later, he came down from his {{afternoon}} sleep, white and cowering.|$|E
6000|$|Quietly happy, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> felt {{now that}} it was all over. The white heat of emotion had {{subsided}} to a gentle glow of contentment conducive to thought.

5000|$|Although {{his parents}} {{could not afford}} his musical education, Vukašin studied by himself, {{learning}} from the books and Internet. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> acquired his keyboards and guitar skills.

He also sang in the choir, danced in the dance studio [...] "Luna" [...] {{and was a member}} of a drama club. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> gained experience in public performances and contests.

60|$|Rutherford {{looked at}} {{the girl in the}} doorway with interest. So this was Peggy.

The face beneath the picture-hat was small and well-shaped, the nose delicately tip-tilted, the chin determined, the mouth a little wide and suggesting good-humour. A pair of grey eyes looked steadily into his before transferring themselves to the statuesque being at the table.|$|E
6000|$|People have {{wondered}} why he fancied himself such a sinner? He confesses to having been a liar and a blasphemer. If I may guess, I fancy that this was merely the literary genius of Bunyan seeking for expression. His lies, I would go bail, were tremendous romances, wild fictions told for fun, never lies of cowardice or for gain. As to his blasphemies, he had an extraordinary power of language, and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> gave it play.
