500|$|In his 1997 book Starlight, Starbright: The Early Tamil Cinema, Randor Guy {{described}} Kalidas as a [...] "crude experiment" [...] {{that had}} poor lip sync; when characters opened their mouths <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>sound,</b> and when dialogue or song was heard, artistes remained silent. He said the public {{did not care}} about technical niceties and flocked to see the film. Film critic and journalist Kalki Krishnamurthy, in his review of the film for Ananda Vikatan, noted that he was awestruck by the costumes used. He praised Rajalakshmi's performance and her dancing but criticised her singing, saying {{that she had to}} go see a doctor to get her vocal chords fixed. The Tamil newspaper Swadesamitran printed a favourable review for Kalidas on 29 October 1931, two days prior to its theatrical release, where the reviewer, in contrast to Krishnamurthy's comments, appreciated Rajalakshmi's singing.|$|E
500|$|Katy Stevens {{notes that}} the {{dialogue}} in [...] "The Body" [...] was recorded with microphones {{very close to the}} actors, making variations in their voices—cracks, rises, and whispers—more prominent to the audience, to close the distance between the actors and the viewer. Conversely, the scene in which Dawn is told of Joyce's death was shot through a large classroom window, muffling Dawn's emotional reaction, to isolate Buffy and Dawn from the class and the audience. Several moments of silence follow this scene. Whedon shot the conversation up close several times, filming over-the-shoulder and reaction shots, but eventually went with a more distanced point of view. Michelle Trachtenberg later said of this effect, [...] "obviously you know in the end result <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>sound</b> and I thought that was actually one of the most brilliant ideas [...] ever had because it allows everyone to sort of attach their own emotional plug into whatever might have happened in your life. I think it allowed the audience to really connect with Dawn for the first time." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1953, British {{psychiatrist}} Harold Bourne {{published a}} paper entitled [...] "The insulin myth" [...] in the Lancet, {{in which he}} argued that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>sound</b> basis for believing that insulin coma therapy counteracted the schizophrenic process in a specific way. If treatment worked, he said, it was because patients were chosen for their good prognosis and were given special treatment: [...] "insulin patients tend to be an elite group sharing common privileges and perils". Prior to publishing [...] "The insulin myth" [...] in The Lancet, Bourne had tried to submit the article to the Journal of Mental Science; after a 12-month delay, the Journal informed Bourne they had rejected the article, telling him to [...] "get more experience".|$|E

6000|$|Endowed with {{enlarged}} {{powers of}} audition as of vision, we are struck [...] by the mournful taciturnity that prevails. Nature is mute. Save [...] for the incessant flogging of the wind-broken and lacerated horses [...] <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>sounds.</b>|$|R
50|$|This {{explains}} why <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>sound</b> when the flame is heating the gauze: all air {{flowing through the}} tube is heated by the flame, so when it reaches the gauze, it is already hot and no pressure increase takes place.|$|R

25|$|Problematic point(s):, linguistically speaking, {{these do}} not {{constitute}} an actual compound (because the meaning is not institutionalized), so <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>sound</b> reason for writing them in one word.
