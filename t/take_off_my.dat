25|$|When evening comes, I go back home, {{and go to}} my study. On the threshold, I <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>my</b> work clothes, {{covered in}} mud and filth, and I put on the clothes an {{ambassador}} would wear. Decently dressed, I enter the ancient courts of rulers who have long since died. There, I am warmly welcomed, and I feed on the only food I find nourishing and was born to savour. I am not ashamed {{to talk to them}} and ask them to explain their actions and they, out of kindness, answer me. Four hours go by without my feeling any anxiety. I forget every worry. I am no longer afraid of poverty or frightened of death. I live entirely through them.|$|E
2500|$|This {{letter to}} Zweig was intercepted by the Gestapo {{and sent to}} Hitler. Strauss was {{subsequently}} dismissed from his post as Reichsmusikkammer president in 1935. The 1936 Berlin Summer Olympics nevertheless used Strauss's Olympische Hymne, which he had composed in 1934. Strauss's seeming relationship with the Nazis in the 1930s attracted criticism from some noted musicians, including Arturo Toscanini, who in 1933 had said, [...] "To Strauss the composer I <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>my</b> hat; to Strauss the man I {{put it back on}} again", when Strauss had accepted the presidency of the Reichsmusikkammer. Much of Strauss's motivation in his conduct during the Third Reich was, however, to protect his Jewish daughter-in-law Alice and his Jewish grandchildren from persecution. Both of his grandsons were bullied at school, but Strauss used his considerable influence to prevent the boys or their mother being sent to concentration camps.|$|E
60|$|CONJURER. I will <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>my</b> cloak {{when you}} take off your coat.|$|E
60|$|I followed, accordingly, and <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>my</b> new hat to her, {{the best}} that I was able.|$|R
60|$|I <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>my</b> hat and bowed. It was {{the first}} time I had ever been {{addressed}} civilly by any English consular authority.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{forgot about}} that, mamma, I had <b>taken</b> <b>off</b> <b>my</b> ulster, and had my little scarlet flannel underbody, {{so as to}} make a better soldier.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very good, sir," [...] assented the old man; [...] "lay your load upon my shoulders, and <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>my</b> parcel, {{putting it}} upon your own back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is so; you're rather clever," [...] said Kit, {{who looked}} at the broken strap. [...] "Well, I'll find a block where I can <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>my</b> boot." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, well," [...] he {{retorted}} coolly, [...] "if that's the way {{you look}} at it! But if you're not in a desperate hurry, I'll <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>my</b> jacket." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't run {{off with}} it. I found it {{drifting}} along the shore, and I <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>my</b> shoes and socks and waded in after it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I've pulled grass from my husband's grave to cure it--wove {{the blades}} into true lover's knots; <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>my</b> shoes upon the sod; but, avast, my shipmate,--' ...|$|R
60|$|It was {{impossible}} for me to make any answer to this woman, but I <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>my</b> hat and bowed. The sail filled, and we glided away.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wot things?" [...] exclaimed the boy angrily. Then {{suddenly}} recollecting himself, he added, [...] "Go along! You can't fool me! Think you'll make me <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>my</b> hat--don't you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We shall {{only want}} a little water. I will <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>my</b> sash, and dip it in the stream; that will give us plenty, when it is wrung out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Won't you <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>my</b> shoes, darling?" [...] she said, sinking {{among the}} {{cushions}} of the settee. Leslie kneeled again before her, and she {{bent her head}} and watched him.|$|E
60|$|I <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>my</b> coat, and baring my arm, {{showed him}} the ring hanging by {{a few inches of}} strong chain from the bracelet. He {{examined}} the design curiously.|$|R
60|$|Then, {{handing the}} rifle to Hans, I <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>my</b> hat, pushed the gate a little wider open, slipped {{through it and}} called {{attention}} to my presence by coughing.|$|R
6000|$|... "You're {{not going}} to marry her now!" [...] {{interposed}} Mrs. Baggs, indignantly. [...] "Bear witness, indeed! I won't bear witness till I've <b>taken</b> <b>off</b> <b>my</b> bonnet, and put my hair tidy!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I shall <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>my</b> hat, and salute them, {{whenever}} I {{pass the}} gate," [...] cried the young man, [...] "if {{the king and}} the whole court are standing by!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh! Well, as {{a matter}} of fact, you know, I was going to <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>my</b> tie. I always do, {{especially}} at night. It's a sort of habit I've got into.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{rock the}} cradle for 'ee, mother," [...] said the {{daughter}} gently. [...] "Or I'll <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>my</b> best frock {{and help you}} wring up? I thought you had finished long ago." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is your {{pleasure}} to say so, sir, but I cannot {{tell you what}} a load your kind offer <b>takes</b> <b>off</b> <b>my</b> mind. The future has seemed very dark to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, I {{want to talk}} to {{you about}} something; when I've <b>taken</b> <b>off</b> <b>my</b> hatband, that is; for it would be hardly lucky to mention such matters with a hatband on." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'We {{have no time}} to waste, Mr. Fulton. Let us go in, and let me get to work. I {{dare say}} the cook will be back before I have <b>taken</b> <b>off</b> <b>my</b> gloves.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Cease weeping, fair BACKSHEESH! I willingly swear Cork {{jackets and}} {{trousers}} I always will wear, And I also {{throw in a}} large number of oaths That I never--no, NEVER--will <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>my</b> clothes!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{shall not}} <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>my</b> mother's {{bracelet}} for {{a gift from}} a man I never knew," [...] she said. [...] "I hate diamonds. I wish those who like such things might have them." ...|$|E
60|$|As {{they went}} out, Mr. Bucket made me {{sit down in}} a corner by the fire and <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>my</b> wet shoes, which he turned up to dry upon the fender, talking all the time.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am. Everything {{is fixed}} up; the bother of {{collecting}} supplies and getting porters has been <b>taken</b> <b>off</b> <b>my</b> shoulders, and all I {{have to do}} is to get along as quickly as possible.' ...|$|R
60|$|Going to {{the spring}} near which we were outspanned, I <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>my</b> shirt {{to have a good}} wash, still chuckling at the memory of all the hocus-pocus of my old friend, the Opener-of-Roads.|$|R
60|$|DE LEVIS. Locked {{the door}} and left the key in. Put back <b>my</b> sponge, and <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>my</b> dressing-gown and put it there. [He points to the footrails of the bed] Then I drew the curtains, again.|$|R
60|$|MANGAN. I don't boast. But when I meet a {{man that}} makes a hundred {{thousand}} a year, I <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>my</b> hat to that man, and stretch out my hand to him and call him brother.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mrs. Brice is a fool and you're another," [...] Bill said. [...] "Now, ooman, just <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>my</b> boots for oim main tired. What be you staring at, Jack? Were you nearly pinning Mother Brice too?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Emily—and George—are in {{the front}} room," [...] said the mother quietly, for it was Sunday afternoon. I {{satisfied}} the little ones; I said {{a few words to}} the mother, and sat down to <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>my</b> clogs.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not when I {{can get my}} Mother Carey all to myself. You go and {{lie down}} in the dressing-room, and I'll come as soon as I have <b>taken</b> <b>off</b> <b>my</b> boots and ordered some coffee for you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is a confirmation," [...] she said. [...] "Mr. Brinkworth {{has been}} found out--the woman is married to him--Geoffrey is free. Oh, my dear friend, what a load of anxiety you have <b>taken</b> <b>off</b> <b>my</b> mind! That vile wretch--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "With that I <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>my</b> {{coat and}} laid it on a bench. I reckon they saw that I was in earnest, and they just sat as mum as mice. Then the little man said, in a quieter sort of voice,-- ...|$|R
