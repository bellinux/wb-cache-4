40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to determine the level of relevance of the economic development and the level of pollution of thirteen states that joined the European Union (EU) in the last three enlargement rounds (2004, 2007, and 2013), with the length of <b>transitional</b> <b>periods,</b> i. e. the number of regulations that have agreed <b>transitional</b> <b>periods.</b> The initial assumption is that the level of economic development of countries joining the EU and the level of pollution are affecting the length of <b>transitional</b> <b>periods</b> and the number of regulations that are agreed upon <b>transitional</b> <b>periods.</b> Accordingly, the paper points to the level of economic development (measured by GDP) and the level of pollution (emissions measured by CO 2 /pc and CO 2 /gdp). All the states are grouped into five regional groups (Mediterranean, Central Europe, the Baltics, South-East Europe and the member states of the former Yugoslavia). Separate part of the paper analyzes in detail the types of regulations relating to the agreed <b>transitional</b> <b>periods,</b> and the number and length of <b>transitional</b> <b>periods</b> that are contracted by the states of the five groups. For the analysis we used the <b>transitional</b> <b>periods</b> in the field of energy, environment and transport, given their potential importance for CO 2 emissions. The final part of the paper analyses perceived relevance between the level of economic development, levels of pollution, the length of <b>transitional</b> <b>periods</b> and the number of regulations that are agreed upon <b>transitional</b> <b>periods...</b>|$|R

5|$|The Wonder World Tour {{has been}} {{described}} as part of Cyrus' <b>transitional</b> <b>period,</b> with more elaborate and edgier characteristics. Each concert was divided into seven segments, each of which bared different themes, the subject of matter for the tour's title. The show opened with Cyrus performing rock-oriented songs. It also featured her and backup dancers being suspended above the stage with aerial rigging various times. At one point, she mounted a Harley-Davidson motorcycle as it was elevated and made its path across the venue. Cyrus also rendered a tribute to the deceased singer Michael Jackson and performed two Hannah Montana-credited songs as herself.|$|E

The author uses the latest data from the “Dublin Foundation” (EFILWC) on migration potential in Europe in conjunction with known migration destination preferences in the new MS for individual EU countries, including Austria, from earlier studies and comes to the conclusion that with an estimated 100, 000 immigrants there is no reason for alarmism. ...|$|R
5|$|The use {{of horses}} in World War I marked a <b>transitional</b> <b>period</b> in the {{evolution}} of armed conflict. Cavalry units were initially considered essential offensive elements of a military force, but {{over the course of the}} war, the vulnerability of horses to modern machine gun and artillery fire reduced their utility on the battlefield. This paralleled the development of tanks, which would ultimately replace cavalry in shock tactics. While the perceived value of the horse in war changed dramatically, horses still played a significant role throughout the war.|$|E
5|$|A modern {{review was}} given by University of York Professor Judith Buchanan. Buchanan recognizes that the film's acting was commended for its action and {{highlights}} the acting of the fool, placed prominently in the foreground, and says that {{it seems as if}} he has been imported from King Lear. This fool serves as an exaggerated proxy for the audience and filters a set of responses for the audience and goes on to steal the reunion scene with his expressions. Buchanan says that adapting the Shakespeare play to the one reel format required foreknowledge of the subject for audiences to intelligibly follow the subject. Buchanan also notes that this <b>transitional</b> <b>period</b> included lecturers who were hired to give supplementary lectures or commentary on the film being exhibited and the additional commentary for Shakespeare adaptations was desirable.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal's run of 49 league games unbeaten {{came to an}} {{end with}} a 2–0 defeat at Manchester United on 24 October 2004. The team under Wenger's {{management}} enjoyed another relatively strong league campaign in 2004–05, but finished second to Chelsea, who ended the season 12 points in front. Consolation again came in the FA Cup; Arsenal defeated Manchester United on penalties, after a goalless final. The emergence of Cesc Fàbregas in the starting lineup prompted Wenger to sell Vieira to Juventus in July 2005. He noticed the two as a midfield pairing was ineffective, and felt keeping Fàbregas would benefit the club's future. The 2005–06 season marked the beginning of a <b>transitional</b> <b>period</b> for Arsenal as it was the club's final season at Highbury. The team finished fourth in the Premier League and outside the top two for the first time under Wenger's tenure. In Europe, however, Wenger assembled an inexperienced defence that beat Real Madrid, Juventus and Villarreal and conceded no goals in the knockout stages of the Champions League. They progressed to the final in May 2006, but ended the competition as runners-up to Barcelona.|$|E

5|$|The {{period of}} Iconoclasm, roughly {{corresponding}} to the 7th to 9th centuries, is poorly documented but {{can be considered a}} <b>transitional</b> <b>period.</b> The cathedral of Sofia has an unsettled date of construction, ranging from the last years of Justinian {{to the middle of the}} 7th century, as the Balkans were lost to the Slavs and Bulgars. It combines a barrel-vaulted cruciform basilica plan with a crossing dome hidden externally by the drum. It resembles some Romanesque churches of later centuries, although the type would not be popular in later Byzantine architecture. Part of the 5th century basilica of St. Mary at Ephesus seems to have been rebuilt in the 8th century as a cross-domed church, a development typical of the 7th to 8th centuries and similar to the cross-domed examples of Hagia Sophia in Thessaloniki, St. Nicholas at Myra, St. Clement's at Ankara, and the church of the Koimesis at Nicaea.|$|E
5|$|The {{previous}} {{season was}} a <b>transitional</b> <b>period</b> for Arsenal. The club transferred {{a number of}} first-team players such as defenders Sol Campbell and Lauren to Portsmouth and winger Robert Pirès to Spanish club Villarreal. After lengthy negotiations, Ashley Cole moved to Chelsea {{on the final day}} of the summer transfer window, in exchange for £5million and defender William Gallas. Arsenal played their home games at the newly constructed Emirates Stadium and drew their first game against Aston Villa. After a defeat by Bolton Wanderers, manager Arsène Wenger admitted that his team were unlikely to make a serious challenge for the Premier League. Despite being a young and inexperienced team, however, Arsenal reached the final of the League Cup, where they were beaten 2–1 by Chelsea. Elimination in the UEFA Champions League in the knockout stage (two-legged matches played home and away) and FA Cup in the space of four days followed – the club lost three games in succession for the first time since October 2002. Arsenal eventually finished fourth in the league, level on points with third-placed Liverpool.|$|E
5|$|The {{third group}} of {{requested}} amendments pertained to eastern Slavonia. Owen and Stoltenberg requested its status {{to be left}} unresolved, instead of gradually reverting to Croatian control {{over a five-year period}} and applying the postwar ethnic composition of the area as a formula for the ethnic mix of the local police and establishing a joint Croatian-Yugoslav company to extract crude oil in Đeletovci. The proposal was turned down, but it led to local autonomy for Serb villages in the area and reduced the <b>transitional</b> <b>period</b> to two years. The fourth group of proposed amendments, tabled by Owen, included a proposal for continued Serb armed presence in Krajina and additional authority for Krajina concerning mineral resources and international treaties. After the proposals, the text of the plan became the subject of lengthy discussions between the contact group countries, the EU and the ICFY co-chairs. The co-chairs began drafting their version of the plan; Stoltenberg stalled the plan through Norwegian diplomat (and ICFY ambassador) Kai Eide, creating a conflict between Eide and Galbraith.|$|E

5|$|With {{the decline}} in the empire's {{resources}} following losses in population and territory, domes in Byzantine architecture were used as part of more modest new buildings. The large-scale churches of Byzantium were, however, kept in good repair. The upper portion of the Church of Hagia Irene was thoroughly rebuilt after an earthquake in 740. The nave was re-covered with an elliptical domical vault hidden externally by a low cylinder on the roof, in place of the earlier barrel vaulted ceiling, and the original central dome from the Justinian era was replaced with one raised upon a high windowed drum. The barrel vaults supporting these two new domes were also extended out over the side aisles, creating cross-domed units. By bracing the dome with broad arches on all four sides, the cross-domed unit provided a more secure structural system. These units, with most domes raised on drums, became a standard element on a smaller scale in later Byzantine church architecture, and all domes built after the <b>transitional</b> <b>period</b> were braced with bilateral symmetry.|$|E
5|$|As a {{video game}} company with {{different}} production teams, Square had wished for its employees to efficiently share their know-how and technology even before the merger with its competitor Enix. The desire for a common development infrastructure and engine {{dates back to the}} 1997 role-playing video game Final Fantasy Tactics, which was created in the <b>transitional</b> <b>period</b> from 2D to 3D game production. Back then, the artists working on the game asked programmer Taku Murata for a fast way to check how their work would look in the final game. As the development was carried out on personal computers, the graphics were displayed on computer monitors. This looked very different from the PlayStation console's actual graphics displayed on a television screen. Initially, a faithful preview of the game's visuals was too time-consuming because all data had to be transferred from PC to console first. To evade this step, Murata created an instant preview tool. With this, he soon witnessed a boost in the artists' productivity and in the quality of their work. For 2000's Vagrant Story, the developers opted to reuse this instant preview tool rather than programming a new one from scratch. Murata and his colleagues added new functions to create a unified preview and cutscene tool tailored to the game's fully polygonal 3D graphics. With 2001's PlayOnline service, the company then made its first foray into introducing a common software for all its divisions.|$|E

40|$|We use {{population}} {{data from}} the U. S. Census to track regional patterns of growth from 1790 through 1990. At the county level, we find that an initial general tendency towards population convergence lasting roughly through the 1800 s becomes reversed: particularly in the post-WWII period, regional populations have diverged. The finding of divergence hinges on two factors: the exclusion of transition dynamics {{and the level of}} aggregation. Regarding the former, state-level populations exhibit consistent patterns of transitional population growth over roughly two- to six-decade periods surrounding the admission of states to the union, followed by long periods of relatively steady growth. When <b>transitional</b> <b>periods</b> are included in our county-level analysis, divergent steady state patterns of growth become masked. Regarding the latter, when we aggregate to the state level, divergent county-level patterns of growth are again masked: even when <b>transitional</b> <b>periods</b> are excluded, state-level populations exhibit tendencies towards convergence. ...|$|R
