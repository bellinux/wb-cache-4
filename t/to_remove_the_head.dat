In Alaska, pike are native north and west of the Alaska Range, but have been illegally introduced to south-central Alaska by game fishermen. In south-central Alaska, no limit is imposed in most areas. Pike are seen as a threat to native wild stocks of salmon by some fishery managers.|$|E

Although the University paid for the {{construction}} of the building, the ornamentation was funded by public subscription, and much of it remains incomplete.

When funding dried up, they offered to work unpaid, but they were accused by members of the University Convocation of [...] "defacing" [...] the building by adding unauthorised work. According to Acland, the O'Shea brothers responded by caricaturing the members of Convocation as parrots and owls in the carving over the building's entrance. Acland insists that he forced them <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>the</b> <b>heads</b> from these carvings.|$|R

50|$|There are two {{variations}} {{of this game}} depending on whether it is played at a seaside town or inland. In a seaside town, a long rope is suspended between a pole on the quay and the mast of a boat. A dead goose (previously live geese were used too) is suspended head {{down in the middle}} of the rope. Teams now have to row out and a designated person must jump up, grab the goose, hang on to it and try <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> before falling off. At the same time, sailors at both ends of the rope try their best to shake the person clinging to the goose off. The team that collects the most heads wins. Inland, the rope is suspended over the ground and the same goal must be achieved from horseback.|$|E

Turkey hunters usually wear full camouflage, from head to toe, to conceal themselves from the wild turkey's excellent eyesight. This includes pants, shirt, hat, boots, gloves, and a mask. Many hunters wear a turkey vest with a cushion to sit on and compartments to carry their calls and dead turkeys.|$|E
5000|$|Noble {{resisted}} the drive towards unionization being felt across Argentinas vast publishing industry during the 1960s, a development primarily {{a result of}} publishing workers union leader Raimundo Ongaro, whose Socialist ideology put him {{at odds with the}} paramount CGT labor federation.

[...] Attempts on the part of Clarín employees to organize were likewise met with swift dismissals, a policy facilitated by Argentinas return to military dictatorship in 1966. Noble had, however, not supported the 1966 coup against the moderate Arturo Illia.

Besides, from this sample base, a pipe came where back pressure is applied. The axial displacement transducer was placed beneath the ramp of the cell chamber.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The authors {{precisely}} {{examined the}} topography of the duodenum, pancreas, bile duct, and supplying vessels {{from the perspective}} of performing duodenum-preserving resection of the pancreatic head. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Little has been reported regarding the detailed surgical anatomy that is crucial in this procedure. METHODS: The authors precisely examined the local anatomy of the pancreas head and duodenum, using materials from 40 autopsy cases. RESULTS: Arcade formation between the anterior superior pancreaticoduodenal (ASPD) artery and the anterior inferior pancreaticoduodenal (AIPD) artery was found in all of the cases. After departing from the gastroduodenal artery, the ASPD ran toward a point 1. 5 cm below the papilla of Vater, then turned to the posterior aspect of the pancreas to joint the AIPD. In 88 % of the cases, an arcade was found between the posterior superior pancreaticoduodenal (PSPD) artery and the posterior inferior pancreaticoduodenal (PIPD) artery. The ASPD, AIPD, PSPD, PIPD, or their branches to the duodenum, the bile duct, and the papilla of Vater were not completely buried in the pancreatic parenchyma in any of these cases. Generally, it was easy to dissect the pancreas from the duodenum because of the loose connection. Near the accessory papilla, however, dissection of the vessels was difficult, and the pancreatic parenchyma sometimes was found in the wall of the duodenum. Dissection of the pancreas from the common bile duct and identification of the main pancreatic duct at the junction with the terminal portion of the bile duct were straightforward in all cases. CONCLUSIONS: It may be possible <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> of the pancreas while preserving of the vascular arcades and their branches to the duodenum, the bile duct, and the papilla of Vater...|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 83 {{individuals}} {{participated in the}} experiments. Three subjects were excluded for failing to complete the training for experiment 1, four were excluded for failing to comply with instructions, and two were excluded for being unable to distinguish the target faces (responding that the morphed faces came from a single gender or identity on more than 85 % of the trials). After exclusion, there were 12 subjects {{in each of the}} 7 experiments. Ten individuals participated in two of the experiments, and no individual participated in more than two experiments. Ages ranged from 20 to 43 years. All subjects were naïve to the goals of the study. The Institutional Review Board of the National Institutes of Health approved all procedures and written informed consent was obtained for all subjects. Stimuli Target face stimuli for all experiments were constructed from photographs of 18 male and 18 female frontal-view faces with neutral expressions from the Karolinska Directed Emotional Faces stimulus set (KDEF) [1]. Each image was converted to grayscale and cropped with a uniform oval that removed all non-facial features. Morpheus Photo Morpher ™ was used to morph between pairs of male faces for experiment 1 (Figure 1 B) and to create male-to-female face morph continua (Figure 1 E) for all other experiments. Body (Figures 1 D and 1 F) and face stimuli were resized using Photoshop to best fill a grey square presented {{in the middle of the}} screen that subtended approximately 6. 5 ˚ of visual angle. In experiment 1, body-face pairings to be used during training were created using Photoshop. For each pairing, a male head from the KDEF was blended onto a photograph of a male body edited <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>the</b> <b>head.</b> Five different versions of each of the body-face pairings were created by cropping the full-length images at the knees, waist, chest, and neck (see Figure 1 A). During training, subjects learned that the face-body images were individuals named “Horace ” and “Barrett. ” The face-body pairings were counterbalanced such that “Horace’s ” face appeared on body A and “Barrett’s ” face appeared on body B for half the subjects.
