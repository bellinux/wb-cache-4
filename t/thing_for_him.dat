25|$|Danforth and Hale summon Elizabeth {{and ask her}} {{to persuade}} John to confess. She is bitter towards Hale, both for doubting her earlier and for wanting John to give in and ruin his good name, but agrees to speak with her husband, if only to say goodbye. She and John have a lengthy discussion, during which she commends him for holding out and not confessing. John says he is refusing to confess not out of {{religious}} conviction but through contempt for his accusers and the court. The two finally reconcile, with Elizabeth forgiving John and saddened {{by the thought that}} he cannot forgive himself and see his own goodness. Knowing in his heart that it is the wrong <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to do, John agrees to falsely confess to engaging in witchcraft, deciding that he has no desire or right to be a martyr.|$|E
25|$|Retirement didn't last long. Astaire {{returned}} {{to the big screen}} to replace the injured Kelly in Easter Parade (1948) opposite Judy Garland, Ann Miller, and Peter Lawford and for a final reunion with Rogers (replacing Judy Garland) in The Barkleys of Broadway (1949). Both of these films revived Astaire's popularity and in 1950 he starred in two musicals - one for M-G-M - Three Little Words with Vera-Ellen and Red Skelton and one on loan-out to Paramount - Let's Dance with Betty Hutton. While Three Little Words did quite well at the box office, Let's Dance was a financial disappointment. Royal Wedding (1951) with Jane Powell and Peter Lawford proved to be very successful, but The Belle of New York (1952) with Vera-Ellen was a critical and box-office disaster. The Band Wagon (1953), which is considered {{to be one of the}} finest musicals ever made, received rave reviews from critics and drew huge crowds. But because of its excessive cost, it failed to make a profit on its first release. Soon after, Astaire, along with all the other remaining stars at M-G-M, was let go from his contract because of the advent of television and the downsizing of film production. In 1954, Astaire was about to start work on a new musical, Daddy Long Legs (1955) with Leslie Caron at 20th Century Fox, when his wife Phyllis became ill and suddenly died of lung cancer. Astaire was so bereaved that he wanted to shut down the picture and offered to pay the production costs out of his own pocket. However, Johnny Mercer (the film's composer) and Fox studio executives convinced him that work would be the best <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> at that time. When Daddy Long Legs was released in 1955, it did only moderately well at the box office. His next film for Paramount, Funny Face (1957), teamed him with Audrey Hepburn and Kay Thompson and despite the sumptuousness of the production and the strong reviews from critics, it failed to make back its cost. Similarly, Astaire's next project - his final musical at M-G-M, Silk Stockings (1957), in which he co-starred with Cyd Charisse, also lost money at the box office. As a result, Astaire withdrew from motion pictures for two years.|$|E

Executive producer Jed Whedon discussed the writer's intentions to expand their depiction of S.H.I.E.L.D. with the episode, saying, [...] "We're trying to flesh out the world of S.H.I.E.L.D. with the established characters and the characters we're introducing to build out the larger organization that we operate in." [...] This includes the introduction of high-ranking S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Victoria Hand, who is shown lying to Coulson in the episode.

500|$|... "Why Don't You Love Me" [...] is {{different}} from Knowles' previous dance-pop songs as it makes use of a retro style. It is an upbeat track that draws from the genre of R. The song also contains elements of up-tempo disco and funk music. It consists of energetic tribal beats, a drum loop, funky guitars and a bassline {{that was designed to}} make it a groovy and dance song. According to the lyrics of [...] "Why Don't You Love Me", Knowles impersonates a woman who questions her love interest about the reason for which he does not value her fabulousness, convincing him she's the best <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> as she sings: [...] "Why don't you love me... when I make me so damn easy to love?... I got beauty... I got class... I got style and I got ass...". The singer further tells her love interest that the decision not to choose her is [...] "entirely foolish".|$|E

A fourth consecutive title followed a week later in the Legg Mason Tennis Classic in Washington, D.C., where he recorded a victory over Viktor Troicki, becoming the first player in ATP history to win his first four career titles in as many tournaments. [...] "I don't really understand what I did. It is difficult to believe that I have won four consecutive titles", del Potro said, crediting coach Franco Davín for his impressive run.

500|$|Republican Congresswoman Barbara Layton (Cherry Jones) {{starts a}} {{campaign}} against publicly funded NIH projects into sexual diseases. The attack {{is based on a}} list of seemingly useless projects, but by association, her real target becomes the president's daughter Ellie, who is working on a study into the Human papillomavirus that researched conditions for prostitutes in Puerto Rico. The President is infuriated at having a family member dragged into political battles, and Toby tries to discredit the attack by finding its source. At first the list seems to originate from a far-right group called the [...] "Traditional Values Alliance", but Toby's assistant Rena uncovers an updated list that shows it came from within the administration. Toby immediately suspects the Vice President's office. When confronted, Will takes full responsibility, and assures that the list was compiled purely for internal use and not leaked on purpose.

500|$|Lasseter also {{explained}} that the film started with pencil and paper designs, saying: [...] "Truth to materials. Starting with pencil-and-paper designs from production designer Bob Pauley, and continuing through the modeling, articulation, and shading of the characters, and finally into animation, the production team worked hard to have the car characters remain true to their origins." [...] Character department manager Jay Ward also explained how they wanted the cars to look as realistic as possible, saying: [...] "John didn't want the cars to seem clay-like or mushy. He insisted on truth to materials. This was a huge <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> He told us that steel needs to feel like steel. Glass should feel like glass. These cars need to feel heavy. They weigh three or four thousand pounds. When they move around, {{they need to have}} that feel. They shouldn't appear light or overly bouncy {{to the point where the}} audience might see them as rubber toys." [...] According to directing animator James Ford Murphy, [...] "Originally, the car models were built so they could basically do anything. John kept reminding us that these characters are made of metal and they weigh several thousand pounds. They can't stretch. He showed us examples of very loose animation to illustrate what not to do." ...|$|E
500|$|He {{started in}} Oxford's {{first game of}} the 2007–08 season, a 1–0 home win against Forest Green Rovers, coming on at half-time. Eight days later, he scored his first goal of the {{campaign}} in the club's 2–1 away win at the Pirelli Stadium against Burton Albion, latching onto Eddie Odhiambo's cross to score from six yards. He started his first game in a 0–0 draw against Stevenage at Broadhall Way in late August 2007, and started once more in a game against Altrincham at Moss Lane a month later, scoring in injury-time to seal a 3–1 victory, having previously assisted the first goal. Odubade's third goal of the campaign came in Oxford's 2–1 home win against Salisbury City, scoring from just inside the area. He also scored a consolation goal for Oxford in the club's 3–1 away loss to relegation candidates Droylsden, as well as scoring twice in the following game as Oxford raced into a three-goal lead against Torquay United, although the game ended 3–3. Odubade scored again against Northwich Victoria in the FA Cup in November 2007, but failed to net again until January 2008 – scoring Oxford's goal in a 3–1 loss away to Salisbury City. After a 0–0 draw against Grays Athletic, a game in which Odubade was substituted on 64 minutes, he failed to start a game for three months. Subsequently, in March 2008, he was transfer-listed by manager Darren Patterson. Shortly after Odubade had been transfer-listed, it was announced that he had played his last game for the club, with Patterson saying [...] "I think the best <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> and us is that we go our separate ways". However, just a week later, Odubade was told by Patterson that he [...] "must start producing performances" [...] if he wants to be taken off the transfer list. He was taken off of the list after scoring three goals in four games {{at the end of the}} season, as well as starting in the club's last two games of the season. Patterson said that Odubade was removed from the transfer list because [...] "he's now putting in a shift" [...] every game. He finished the season as Oxford's top goalscorer, as Oxford finished the season in ninth place. In total, Odubade played 43 games in all competitions, scoring 11 times as Oxford finished in ninth place.|$|E

2500|$|Sacchetti's version differs: [...] "When I {{proposed}} to Lucio my original treatment for Per Sempre, which {{was nothing more}} than a sequel to The Postman Always Rings Twice in which a dead man returns to life, he became really enthusiastic and had my story read by a producer friend of his who then commissioned me to write a finished script. At that time, Fulci assumed that he would direct it. Later, for various reasons, problems arose and the film was never made. Four years later, (Lamberto) Bava used my script to make Per Sempre and Fulci, who was not working much at the time, got angry with me and started hurling these accusations.
