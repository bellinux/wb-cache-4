5|$|Airship Industries {{managed a}} major {{marketing}} coup with {{the inclusion of}} their Skyship 500 series blimp in the film. At the time Airship Industries were producing a fleet of blimps which were recognisable over many capitals of the world offering tours, or advertising sponsorship deals.

5|$|The {{taxonomy}} of Verbascum has not undergone any significant revision since Svanve Mürbeck's monographies in the 1930s, {{with the exception}} of the work of Arthur Huber-Morath, who used informal group in organizing the genus for the florae of Iran and Turkey to account for many intermediate species. Since Huber-Morath's groups are not taxonomical, Mürbeck's treatment is <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>current</b> one available, as no study has yet sought to apply genetic or molecular data extensively to the genus. In Mürbeck's classification, V.thapsus is placed in section Bothrospermae subsect. Fasciculata (or sect. Verbascum subsect. Verbascum depending on nomenclatural choices) alongside species such as Verbascum nigrum (black or dark mullein), Verbascum lychnitis (white mullein) and Verbascum sinuatum (wavy-leaved mullein).|$|E

The list is not complete, as it does not feature some heads of state that took power by coups, nor national authorities in the times when there wasn't yet a designated presidential office (notably Governor Juan Manuel de Rosas). Currently, the busts are only made for presidents who {{have been out of}} office for at least two presidential mandates; <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>current</b> one is that of Raúl Alfonsín.|$|E
25|$|In October 2010, a {{draft report}} from the Civil Rights Commission was posted on the {{political}} website TPM Muckraker, stating that political officials had been extensively involved {{in the decision to}} dismiss the case, and that the Department of Justice had attempted to conceal their involvement. Civil Rights Commission chairman Gerald A.

The Justice Department denied the allegations in the report.|$|E
25|$|The taxonomic {{division}} of Streptococcus dysgalactiae into its two subspecies {{has been the}} origin of much confusion, and a matter of ongoing debate. Although no official taxonomic gold standard exists, <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>current</b> and widely supported definition was published by Vieira et al. in 1998. It defines S.dysgalactiae subspecies dysgalactiae solely as the alpha-haemolytic phenotype harbouring the Lancefield group C antigen. The rest are classified as S.dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis, are (mostly) beta-haemolytic and can harbour carbohydrate antigens of Lancefield group A, C, G or L. However, a recent study indicates that the SDSE strains of animal and human origin are genetically divergent, and future taxonomic reclassifications are conceivable.|$|E

The cumulative total from 1998 to June 2014 is 67,280,854 evangelistic contacts with a reported 12,640,017 decisions made for Christ (18.8 percent of contacts) and 5,261,310 (41.6 percent of decisions) initial discipleship follow-ups.

25|$|In {{addition}} to normal breakdown {{ratings of the}} device, power BJTs are subject to a failure mode called secondary breakdown, in which excessive current and normal imperfections in the silicon die cause portions of the silicon inside the device to become disproportionately hotter than the others. The electrical resistivity of doped silicon, like other semiconductors, has a negative temperature coefficient, meaning that it conducts more current at higher temperatures. Thus, the hottest {{part of the die}} conducts <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>current,</b> causing its conductivity to increase, which then causes it to become progressively hotter again, until the device fails internally. The thermal runaway process associated with secondary breakdown, once triggered, occurs almost instantly and may catastrophically damage the transistor package.|$|E
25|$|The next Might and Magic {{game was}} {{released}} in 2002 as Might and Magic IX for Windows. Abandoning the now-dated Might and Magic VI engine {{in favor of the}} Lithtech engine (also used in Legends of Might and Magic), Might and Magic IX was the first game in the series to be rendered entirely in 3D. Unfortunately, the release of the game was rushed, and the finished product was received poorly by critics, who noted the numerous software bugs remaining in the final release, most of which were not fully resolved by the sole patch released before New World Computing's dissolution. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>current</b> game, released by Ubisoft in 2014, is Might and Magic X.|$|E
