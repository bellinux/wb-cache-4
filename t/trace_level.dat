40|$|The rate {{of carbon}} dioxide {{corrosion}} is conventionally recognized to be independent of the flow velocity at ambient temperatures. However {{in the presence of}} <b>trace</b> <b>levels</b> of dissolved oxygen (greater than 15 ppb) it has been found that the rate {{of carbon dioxide}} corrosion can exhibit a strong flow dependence. Corrosion rates determined using the jet impingement technique illustrate a three fold increase in the corrosion rate in the presence of <b>trace</b> <b>levels</b> of dissolved oxygen (greater than 15 ppb) at a Reynolds number of 61000. It is theorized that <b>trace</b> <b>levels</b> of dissolved oxygen affect the rate of hydration of carbon dioxide and may develop a surface which can facilitate the hydrogen evolution reaction. The practical implication of this interference can not be underestimated and is likely to be strongly associated with severe pitting and flow induced localized corrosion. <b>Trace</b> <b>levels</b> of dissolved oxygen are inevitably present in oil and gas process streams and most conventional laboratory testing of carbon dioxide corrosion...|$|R

However, it is not practical to use naturally-occurring 14C for tracer studies. Instead it is made by neutron irradiation of the isotope 13C which occurs naturally in carbon at about the 1.1% level. 14C has been used extensively to trace the progress of organic molecules through metabolic pathways.|$|E
30|$|Surface-enhanced Raman {{scattering}} {{has been}} proven a powerful means in the fast detection and recognition of chemicals at <b>trace</b> <b>levels,</b> while quantitative analysis especially the compositional analysis of trace chemical mixtures remains a challenge. We report here a “triangle-rule” based on the principal component analysis (PCA) of surface-enhanced Raman scattering spectra, to calculate the composition of individual component of ternary chemical mixtures at <b>trace</b> <b>levels,</b> which can be simplified into the “balance-rule” for binary mixtures. We demonstrated {{the validity of the}} triangle-rule and balance-rule in estimating the composition of ternary and binary mixtures of methyl orange, methylene blue, and crystal violet with different molecular structures, and the validity for ternary and binary mixtures of three isomers of monochlorobiphenyl with very similar molecular structures. This idea might be also applicable to mixtures of more components at the <b>trace</b> <b>levels.</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{method has}} been {{developed}} for the determination of <b>trace</b> <b>levels</b> of alpha-endosulfan, beta-endosulfan, endosulfan sulfate, and endosulfan diol in rat plasma and tissue samples. Endosulfan and its metabolites in the plasma samples were extracted with solid-phase extraction Chromabond-end-capped C 18 cartridges and analyzed by a Shimadzu QP- 5050 A gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GCMS) with quadrupole detector in selected-ion-monitoring mode. The analysis of endosulfan and its metabolites in liver and kidney samples involved solvent extraction, Florisil solid-phase-extraction cleanup, and quantitation by GCMS. Recovery experiments for the plasma and tissue samples were conducted over concentration ranges of 10 - 100 ng mL(- 1) and 100 - 1000 ng mL(- 1), respectively. The method {{was applied to the}} analysis of <b>trace</b> <b>levels</b> of endosulfan and its metabolites in plasma and tissue samples collected from an animal study. <b>Trace</b> <b>levels</b> of alpha-endosulfan and beta-endosulfan in the ranges of undetectable to 3. 11 mug g(- 1) and undetectable to 1. 19 mug g(- 1), respectively, were detected in the kidney samples, whereas <b>trace</b> <b>levels</b> of endosulfan sulfate in the range of 0. 02 - 0. 22 mug g(- 1) were detected in the liver samples of rats.

50|$|Methanogens are coccoid (spherical shaped) or bacilli (rod shaped). There {{are over}} 50 {{described}} species of methanogens, {{which do not}} form a monophyletic group, although all methanogens belong to Archaea. They are anaerobic organisms and cannot function under aerobic conditions. They {{are very sensitive to}} the presence of oxygen even at <b>trace</b> <b>level.</b> Usually, they cannot sustain oxygen stress for a prolonged time. However, Methanosarcina barkeri is exceptional in possessing a superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzyme, and may survive longer than the others in the presence of O2. Some methanogens, called hydrogenotrophic, use carbon dioxide (CO2) as a source of carbon, and hydrogen as a reducing agent.|$|E
50|$|To achieve {{comparability}} of VOC measurements, reference standards traceable to SI-units are required. For {{a number}} of VOCs gaseous reference standards are available from specialty gas suppliers or national metrology institutes, either {{in the form of}} cylinders or dynamic generation methods. However, for many VOCs, such as oxygenated VOCs, monoterpenes, or formaldehyde, no standards are available at the appropriate amount of fraction due to the chemical reactivity or adsorption of these molecules. Currently, several national metrology institutes are working on the lacking standard gas mixtures at <b>trace</b> <b>level</b> concentration, minimising adsorption processes, and improving the zero gas. The final scopes are for the traceability and the long-term stability of the standard gases to be in accordance with the data quality objectives (DQO, maximum uncertainty of 20% in this case) required by the WMO/GAW program.|$|E
5000|$|DOCK8, or [...] "dedicator of {{cytokinesis}} 8", is {{a protein}} involved in regulating the actin skeleton of the cell. It {{may also be}} a tumor suppressor, since DOCK8 is lost in many cancers and people with DOCK8 deficiency are prone to developing malignancies. When it is mutated, an incorrect protein is produced, so there is, at most, a <b>trace</b> <b>level</b> of functional DOCK8 protein in the cell. There are a variety of loss-of-function mutations in DOCK8 that can cause deficiency and hyperimmunoglobulin E, including frameshift mutations, nonsense mutations, microdeletions, and, most commonly, large deletions. The low number of T cells (T cell lymphopenia) and other lymphocytes appears to be responsible for the susceptibility to infections, and the poor humoral immunity is responsible for low response to vaccines. However, how DOCK8 is involved in the loss of T cells is not known.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} copper, chromium, and zinc ions, at <b>trace</b> <b>levels,</b> on the {{performance}} of a simulated activated sludge process were investigated. The results of batch adsorption experiments showed that the adsorption of copper, chromium, and zinc ions followed both the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms. The presence of <b>trace</b> <b>levels</b> of these three metals not only reduced the adsorption rate of organic matters but also the chemical oxygen demand adsorption capacity (CAC) of the activated sludge. Metal ions competed with the organic substrate for adsorption binding sites on the surfaces of activated sludge bioflocs and reduced the CAC. Studies performed in a sequential batch reactor (SBR) showed that the presence of <b>trace</b> <b>levels</b> of heavy metal ions in wastewater affected the SBR performance to different extents depending on the hydraulic retention time (HRT). When the reactors were operated at short HRTs of 2. 5 d or less, the presence of <b>trace</b> <b>levels</b> of heavy metal ions reduced substantially the CAC of activated sludge, which, in turn, affected significantly the performance of the SBR. However, under longer HRTs (e. g., 5 d), the heavy metal ions in the wastewater reduced the CAC but had no significant effect on the chemical oxygen demand removal efficiency.
