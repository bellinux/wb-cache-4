As the tungsten carbide button is worn away the softer steel matrix containing it is also worn away, exposing yet more button insert.|$|E

50|$|Some {{quarries}} used primitive <b>top</b> <b>hammer</b> {{machines that}} carried the jack hammer on a mast - the slenderness of the drill rods working with a relatively large diameter drill bit caused bore holes to deviate which sometimes meant that a bore hole might finish dangerously close to its neighbour or indeed {{be closer to the}} face of the quarry than had been intended. In any event boreholes that are not aligned correctly which are then loaded with high explosive can be extremely dangerous, resulting in rock being projected beyond the intended site.|$|E
5000|$|He {{achieved}} the selection as the <b>top</b> <b>hammer</b> thrower from the highly competitive country of Ukraine during the 2012 season that saw him improve his personal {{best in the}} event out to 79.42 m at a meet in Jablonec, Czech Republic, four days after his 46th birthday. At the time, {{it had been the}} #2 throw in the world that year. [...] His previous personal best of 77.86 m was set almost 22 years earlier in 1990, when he was the 22nd ranked hammer thrower in the world while competing for the Soviet Union. That mark improved his standing world record in the age group by over 4 metres (13 feet). This was not a fluke throw, throughout the 2012 season Dryhol has had several competitions beyond the 77 meter range. [...] Throughout the 2011 season, Dryhol was also a top ranked hammer thrower, peaking at the 75.27, but gave up his spot to compete in the 2011 IAAF World Championships to Andriy Martynyuk, the 2009 European Junior Champion who was born 15 days after Dryhol had set his personal best to that time.|$|E
40|$|Large {{geotechnical}} {{structures such as}} embankment {{dams and}} tailings dams are subject to high safety requirements. One of the key requirements is long-term stability {{in order to avoid}} incidents and failures as well as to ensure environmental safety during and after the operational phases. To ensure security, the instrumentation of existing embankment dams and tailings dams, using drilling technologies, is necessary for surveillance. Drilling in the structures of dams or in their foundations, however, always entails certain risks. Therefore, the selection of drilling technologies must be carried out carefully, taking into account the condition and sensitivity of each dam section. A continuous evaluation and development of existing drilling requirements is an important safety aspect. The main objective of this comparative study, implemented in collaboration between LKAB, Wassara AB, Sweco Infrastructure AB and Luleå University of Technology in Malmberget, Sweden, is to analyse the influence on surrounding soil of a water powered DTH hammer system and <b>top</b> <b>hammer</b> drillings with different setups during the drilling process. Covering an area of 800 m², an artificial dam with a height of 3 m was built and compacted in layers. The soil used was characterised as gravelly sand. Drillings were done vertical and inclined. Weight sounding tests before and after drilling, excavation of boreholes as well as soil sampling for further laboratory analysis have all been conducted. Complementing this research project, one vertical borehole with a depth of 30 m has been drilled with Wassara’s Lost Hammer concept (LHC) in the tailings dam of LKAB in Malmberget. This study concludes by stating that, for the analysed drilling formation, the average radius of influence on soil was identical (0. 49 m along the borehole axis) for both the water powered DTH and the hydraulic <b>top</b> <b>hammer</b> system with a pre-drilling protective casing. <b>Top</b> <b>hammer</b> drillings in combination with a casing drilling system (Symmetrix) indicate an increased average zone of influence of 0. 72 m around the boreholes. Measurements collected while drilling, correlated with laboratory analyses and weight sounding tests, reveal that the rearrangement of soil particles depends on the interaction of applied down-thrust, the vibration of the drill string, the amount of drained flushing water towards the adjacent soil and existing pressure conditions within the embankment structure.

5000|$|The F/A was {{a select}} fire, force fed, {{blowback}} paintball gun {{based on the}} Pro-Am/Pro-lite body, with the Star feed apparatus on the side. It {{can be said that}} the F/A's Star feed, which is close in function to the modern Cyclone feed, is the predecessor to the A-5. The F/A could be switched between safe, semi, and fully automatic firing via a fire selector lever. The full-auto setting changed the sear from a disconnecting version (used in semi-auto) to a full open sear. It used a hydraulic key/linkage/shock style system to slow the rate of fire by dragging 2 sets of keys on the <b>top</b> of the <b>hammer.</b> Although the rate of fire was adjustable from a few shots a second to around 20, the adjustments were seen as [...] "tricky" [...] by some users (although that was {{a small price to pay}} for such awesome firepower). Also, the Star feed required manual winding, and no other loaders on the market could feed a marker at that rate of fire. This feed system was prone to breaking paint, partially due to the spring tension, and partially due to the heavy action of older Tippmanns. The F/A, like the Pro-Lite and Carbine series, shares barrel threading and basic valve design with the A-5.|$|R
