5|$|Obesity {{is mostly}} {{preventable}} {{through a combination}} of social changes and personal choices. Changes to diet and exercising are the main treatments. Diet quality can be improved by reducing the consumption of energy-dense foods, such as those high in fat and sugars, and by increasing the intake of dietary fiber. Medications may be used, along with a suitable diet, to reduce appetite or decrease fat absorption. If diet, exercise, and medication are not effective, a gastric balloon or surgery may be performed to reduce stomach volume or length of the intestines, leading <b>to</b> <b>feeling</b> full earlier or a reduced ability to absorb nutrients from food.|$|E
5|$|Climate Change Denial: Heads in the Sand {{presents}} {{a detailed analysis}} and refutation of climate change denial. In her foreword to the book, Naomi Oreskes writes that people fall victim to the phenomenon of denial due <b>to</b> <b>feeling</b> frightened. The book examines several arguments against global warming, and uses peer-reviewed evidence from the scientific consensus to back-up rationale for disputing the validity of each argument. The methodology of those denying climate change is assessed, including: cherry picking data purporting to support their specific viewpoints, maintaining a high bar for evidence of climate change by those denying it, and criticism {{of the values of}} climate scientists themselves. The book puts forth an explanation why certain individuals, and the wider public, have a tendency to deny the scientific consensus for climate change.|$|E

30|$|Statements {{relating}} <b>to</b> <b>feelings</b> of ‘integration’ (seen as {{the more}} desirable form of acculturation balance) also had a considerably high number of participants in agreement; however, the strong agreement with statements relating to ‘separation’ is not favorable. Out {{of all of the}} respondents, there were only three that agreed with all three statements relating <b>to</b> <b>feelings</b> of ‘integration’ (three statements being the maximum), but two out of these three respondents also expressed agreement with the two of the three statements associated with ‘separation’. Statements that were relating <b>to</b> <b>feelings</b> of ‘assimilation’ and ‘marginalization’ were amongst the lowest out of the four categories.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, Sulan kills Durst and grafts {{his face}} {{over his own}} to appear more {{appealing}} to the Klingon Torres. Klingon Torres escapes from Sulan's laboratory, and rescues her human version. After arguing about their respective weaknesses, and past expulsion from Starfleet Academy, the two halves formulate a plan. Human Torres suggests shutting down the shields for the complex so that Voyager can transport them to the ship, while the Klingon Torres deals with guards. Chakotay, disguised as a Vidiian guard {{with the help of}} , breaks into the facility at the same time Torres deactivates the shields. Klingon Torres sacrifices herself to protect {{the rest of the crew}} members from Sulan. Transported back to Voyager, Klingon Torres refuses medical help to die an honorable death. The Doctor explains that Human Torres would not survive without her Klingon half and restores her to her original self by reintegrating the Klingon DNA. Human Torres admits <b>to</b> <b>feeling</b> incomplete without her Klingon half. After being restored, she realizes that she will spend the rest of her life dealing with her inner conflict.|$|E

When Michael Moon (Steve John Shepherd) tells his brother Tyler about Whitney's recent ordeal, he rejects her but later gives her his special Moon pendant {{to make up for}} it. Whitney agrees to go on a date with Tyler and they agree to have sex but Whitney is unsure as she remembers her past and runs out, telling Tyler she never wants to see him again. Tyler is hurt. He later tells Fatboy she needs a shrink which Whitney overhears. She runs out and kisses Fatboy and starts a relationship with him. Fatboy publicly declares his love for Whitney, but when he is unable to give her a driving lesson, Lucy (now Hetti Bywater) suggests that Tyler do it, because she knows that Tyler likes Whitney. Whitney starts to feel smothered by Fatboy's affections. Lucy teases Tyler by telling him that Fatboy plans to publicly propose to Whitney, so Tyler tells Whitney he likes her but Whitney says it is too late. Tyler then surprises Whitney by kissing her. Whitney, feeling guilty, refuses to go on holiday with Fatboy, and tells him to kiss her. He does, but she says it is like kissing her best friend. She then admits she wants Tyler, and Fatboy is heartbroken. Whitney then goes to see Tyler but finds him with Lucy, kissing. She then tells Tyler to leave her alone. However, Tyler later tells Whitney that he cannot, as he loves her. Whitney admits <b>to</b> <b>feeling</b> the same way, and they begin a relationship.|$|E

25|$|The {{reported}} {{reasons for}} self-harm {{differ from the}} reasons for suicide attempts. Nearly 70% of people with BPD self-harm without trying to end their life. Reasons for self-harm include expressing anger, self-punishment, generating normal feelings (often in response to dissociation), and distracting oneself from emotional pain or difficult circumstances. In contrast, suicide attempts typically reflect a belief that others {{will be better off}} following the suicide. Both suicide and self-harm are a response <b>to</b> <b>feeling</b> negative emotions. Sexual abuse can be a particular trigger for suicidal behavior in adolescents with BPD tendencies.|$|E

25|$|Elderspeak can in fact {{contribute}} to decreased comprehension, and can increase confusion. Early social scientists first identified elderspeak and estimated that 20% {{of the communication}} occurring in nursing homes is actually elderspeak (Caporael, 1981). Caretakers of nursing home residents must be particularly careful when using elderspeak. Although elderspeak {{has been shown to}} help older adults with dementia and Alzheimer’s in language comprehension, they are not immune <b>to</b> <b>feeling</b> disrespected when it is used. Resisting care is an ongoing problem with dementia patients, as well as violent behaviour, and residents of nursing homes are more likely to resist care when their nurse uses elderspeak. Care givers may assume that the elder prefers the nurturing of elderspeak but older adults think of it as demeaning. Older adults in both institutional settings and those receiving home care services report that as many as 40% of their caregivers use speech they perceive as demeaning, and 75% of the interactions that elderly people have are with the staff of the nursing homes.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this paper}} is to examine the role of consumer's affect and gender in new {{products}} evaluations in advertising signaling processes. A factorial experiment is conducted comprising three factors: the valence of the consumers' mood, managed at two levels (positive and negative), the level of openness <b>to</b> <b>feelings,</b> which was not manipulated but measured and considered at two levels (low and high) and the sex of the respondent (male and female). The results suggest that the consumers' mood, when they are exposed to advertising signaling actions, does not influence their judgment of new products. However, supporting the hypotheses, an interactive effect between the level of openness <b>to</b> <b>feelings</b> and the individual's mood is identified in these processes, as well as a direct effect of the gender. Furthermore, the results also show a direct effect of the level of openness <b>to</b> <b>feelings</b> in the evaluation of the product quality...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} most video game {{enjoyment}} {{can be understood}} in terms of the type of feedback used, the rules set out by the game and the social elements of the game - concepts that have been identified as critical to video games. Self-determination theory (SDT) is used as a lens for understanding the mechanism by which these traits might lead to enjoyment. Specifically, the argument is that feedback, rules, and social elements of games will fulfill the dimensions of SDT - competence autonomy, and relatedness. Then, the dimensions of SDT will predict enjoyment. Participants were presented with a game that emphasized feedback, rules, or social elements. Games that emphasized flexible rules led <b>to</b> <b>feelings</b> of competence while games that emphasized social elements led <b>to</b> <b>feelings</b> of relatedness. Competence and elatedness then led <b>to</b> <b>feelings</b> of enjoyment. In doing so, this study identifies key elements of video games while illuminating ways to understand video game enjoyment...|$|R
