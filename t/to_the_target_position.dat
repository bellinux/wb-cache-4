50|$|To provide best {{acoustic}} performance, some drive manufacturers {{may limit}} the maximum seek {{velocity of the}} heads for AAM operation. This degrades performance by increasing the average seek time: some head movements are forced to wait an additional disk rotation before accessing data because the head was unable to move <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>position</b> during the first rotation due to velocity limits. For example, benchmark tests with SiSoftware Sandra Lite on a Samsung HD154UI (1.5TB, SATA300, 3.5", 5400rpm, 32MB Cache) hard drive showed no measurable performance impact for an AAM setting of 190, but the drive did become noticeably more quiet than the disabled setting (0). Selecting the most-quiet setting (128) caused average random access time to increase about 10% while quieting improved noticeably over the middle setting. On this drive, some quieting is available without performance impact, and even more quieting is available if some performance degradation is acceptable.|$|E
