500|$|Joey Santiago later recalled: [...] "The {{tour manager}} asked, 'Hey, Arsenio Hall {{wants you to}} come on the show.' We said, 'Well, what do they want to hear?' He said, 'Here Comes Your Man.' No way. We <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>we</b> would love to go on, only if we did the song 'Tame'. And they said, 'No, thank you.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|On March 2, 2008 Hill {{said in an}} {{interview}} in Beijing that US diplomatic relations with Korea were possible before the end of the Bush administration if Korea completely dismantled its nuclear program. [...] "We've <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>we</b> are not prepared to do that until they give up their nuclear materials", said Hill. [...] "We can begin the process of discussing what we are going to do, whether we are going to open embassies, that sort of thing. But we will not have diplomatic relations with a nuclear North Korea." ...|$|E
2500|$|Outmanned by Army, Crisler {{unveiled}} a platoon {{system in which}} separate groups played offense and defense. [...] According to one account, Crisler developed the two-platoon system [...] "in a bout of desperation." [...] Crisler later recalled, [...] "I reported the plan to the players and <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>we</b> might {{have a lot of}} fun. [...] At the end of three periods we were tied 7–7 and I knew it couldn't last. I knew sooner or later Army would overpower us. And that's what happened. We lost 28 to 7—but {{we had a lot of}} fun." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, but we're {{a scratch}} lot. Have you <b>told</b> <b>'em</b> <b>we</b> shall need a {{substitute}} even if Crandall can play?" [...] said a Lieutenant of Engineers with a D.S.O. to his credit.|$|R
60|$|We {{returned}} to the others and <b>told</b> <b>them</b> everything that <b>we</b> had learned from Shadrach.|$|R
6000|$|... "The men did {{not know}} their destination. True, she might have seen us despite our precautions, but you forget that she <b>told</b> <b>them</b> how <b>we</b> were {{to act in the}} event of our being seen. That is what perplexes me." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "When {{ten years}} old, I {{was in my}} first battle on the Tongue River. It was an {{overland}} train of covered wagons who had soldiers with them. The way it was started, the soldiers fired on the Indians, our tribe, {{only a few of}} us. We went to our friends and <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>we</b> had been fired on by the soldiers, and they surrounded the train and we had a fight with them. I do not know how many we killed of the soldiers, but they killed four of us. After that we had a good many battles, but I did not take any scalps for a good while. I cannot tell how many I killed when a young man." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{can make}} us out now plainly enough, Peters, and the firing will of course have <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>we</b> are the vessel {{that they are in}} search of. I don't think that there is any getting away from them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If you had <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>we</b> were going, dear," [...] said Mrs. March, {{when the}} couple were {{themselves}} gone, [...] "we should have been as old as ever. Don't let us tell anybody, this morning, that we're going. I couldn't bear it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{have taken}} Jacob, an' he has <b>told</b> <b>them</b> where <b>we</b> are," [...] I {{said on the}} impulse of the moment, not meaning to cast reproach upon the lad, but knowing what fiendish means those wretches {{employed}} in order to extort information.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I don't {{believe he}} <b>told</b> <b>them</b> just what <b>we</b> wanted; and, at any rate, I'm done with agents. Tomorrow I'm going entirely by advertisements." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, you {{had better}} go to-morrow and see them, and tell them, as I have <b>told</b> <b>them</b> already, <b>we</b> are very sorry for the goings on of these people, {{but it is not}} our fault. You have no fear that they will hurt you, have you? Because if so, don't you go." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pat {{has gone}} home and <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>we</b> are all right, and mamma knows we can manage here well {{enough for one}} night, so don't worry, Gwen, but take a nap, and I'll lie on the rug and see to the fire." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Say, Helen, let me {{tell you}} something," [...] said the colonel, resting on his spade and looking at her quizzically. [...] "I <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>we</b> hadn't had enough frost yet to ripen hickory-nuts and chestnuts. But they went anyhow. Will did {{remember}} to say if you came along, to tell you he'd bring the colored leaves you wanted." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You--you {{were the}} drummer boy, I remember, and {{strutted}} {{in front of}} the regiment as if you were the colonel. Egad, I remember how you fooled the Kaskaskians when you <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>we</b> were going away." [...] He looked at me, but his eyes were still fixed on the point beyond. [...] "You were always older than I, Davy. Are you married?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Their guns will be {{of little}} use to them, for few of them can ever have had {{firearms}} in their hands before; do not fire a shot, MacIntosh, until I give the order. It is clear that someone must have <b>told</b> <b>them</b> that <b>we</b> have thrown up this intrenchment today, or {{they would not have}} wasted their ammunition." ...|$|R
5000|$|On Saturday, September 6, 2008, Pakistan {{blocked a}} fuel route {{supplying}} U.S. {{and other western}} forces operating in Afghanistan {{in response to the}} raid. [...] "We have <b>told</b> <b>them</b> that <b>we</b> will take action and we have already taken action today. We have stopped the supply of oil and this will tell how serious we are," [...] said Pakistani Defence Minister Ahmad Mukhtar.|$|R
6000|$|Our {{friends in}} Chicago smiled when I <b>told</b> <b>them</b> where <b>we</b> had been. Lorado said, [...] "A Honeymoon {{in the heart}} of the Rockies is just like you"--but I cared nothing for his gibes so long as Zulime was content, and I had but to over-hear her account of her trip to be reassured. To her it had been a noble {{exploration}} into a marvelous country.|$|R
6000|$|... 'So Allo carried word {{back to the}} Winged Hats that {{we would}} not fight them if they did not fight us; and they (I think they were a little tired of losing men in the sea) agreed to a sort of truce. I believe Allo, who being a horse-dealer loved lies, also <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>we</b> might some day rise against Maximus as Maximus had risen against Rome.|$|E
60|$|Here William and I, and {{the other}} two, our {{faithful}} comrades, debated what we should do; and here William and I resolved to separate from the other two, they resolving {{to go with the}} Dutchman into Holland, by the means of some Dutch ship which lay then in the road. William and I <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>we</b> resolved to go and settle in the Morea, which then belonged to the Venetians.|$|E
6000|$|... “But he won’t pull those chaps around, {{from the}} look of it,” he added, {{pointing}} at the Macedonia’s third boat, for which I had been steering and which was now nearly abreast of us. “That’s Horner’s and Smoke’s work. I <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>we</b> wanted live men, not carcasses. But the joy of shooting to hit is a most compelling thing, when once you’ve learned how to shoot. Ever experienced it, Mr. Van Weyden?” ...|$|E
60|$|I {{waited until}} they were quite close enough to hear me, and then I hailed <b>them.</b> I <b>told</b> <b>them</b> that <b>we</b> were friends of the Mezops, {{and that we were}} upon a visit to Ja of Anoroc, to which they replied that they were at war with Ja, and that if we would wait a minute they'd board us and throw our corpses to the azdyryths.|$|R
60|$|When {{another day}} had come, and the rations were reduced in {{size as the}} commandant had said they would be, there was a hum of dissatisfaction all over the fort, even those whom we counted as being the stoutest-hearted doing their full share of grumbling, and wholly because the commandant had so lately <b>told</b> <b>them</b> that <b>we</b> had {{sufficient}} of food for many days.|$|R
6000|$|... "We must go {{in another}} {{direction}} to-night," [...] he <b>told</b> <b>them,</b> [...] "where <b>we</b> shall find children I have never yet visited. And we must travel fast and work quickly, for my sack is full of toys and running over the brim!" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{was as much}} {{affected}} at {{the sight}} as any of them; but, for all that, I could not bear the thoughts of going back again. I <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>we</b> had marched 700 miles of our way, {{and it would be}} worse than death to think of going back again; and that, if they thought the desert was not passable, I thought we should rather change our course, and travel south till we came to the Cape of Good Hope, or north to the country that lay along the Nile, where, perhaps, we might find some way or other over to the west sea; for sure all Africa was not a desert.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nine {{worn-out}} and footsore oxen {{will not}} draw the waggon," [...] he said; [...] "also {{in all probability}} the place is already surrounded by Matabele, who merely let us in {{to be sure of}} the guns which their spies must have <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>we</b> were carrying. Lastly, having spent so much and come so far, I do not mean to go without what we seek. Still, if you think that your daughter's danger is greater within these walls than outside of them, you might try, if we can hire servants, which I doubt. Or possibly, if any rowers are to be had, you could go down the Zambesi in a canoe, risking the fever. You and she must settle it, Clifford." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, incos, we {{lie down}} in little bush behind there. We send horse back to first wood and tell man to bring him every night to bottom of the hill, or if he sees us from a {{distance}} coming down the hill with Kaffirs after us, to come to meet us. We lie down till morning. Then when they go on, we go on too, little time afterwards, as you said, and follow as far as first wood; look-out think we belong to big party; then we hide there till one of my men come back. I <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>we</b> should be somewhere in wood, and he is to make signals as he walks along. We will push on {{as far as we}} can, so that we don't come upon kraals." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It {{must be the}} grown-up {{people who}} have changed all this,' said Alice. 'WE couldn't have changed it, {{if we had been}} so inclined, and we never should have been. Or perhaps Miss Grimmer IS a wicked fairy after all, and won't act up to it because the grown-up people have persuaded her not to. Either way, they would make us ridiculous if <b>we</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> what <b>we</b> expected.' ...|$|R
5000|$|On January 1, 1986, Michigan {{defeated}} Nebraska (ranked #7 in the AP Poll), 27-23, in the 1986 Fiesta Bowl. Nebraska led 14-3 at halftime, but Michigan scored 24 unanswered {{points in}} the third quarter, fueled by two Nebraska fumbles and a blocked punt recovered at Nebraska's six-yard line. Asked about his halftime speech {{that led to the}} third-quarter turnaround, Coach Schembechler said, [...] "I'm not Knute Rockne. I don't have to yell all the time at halftime. I simply <b>told</b> <b>'em</b> <b>we</b> had to stop their first drive, get the ball and score." [...] Michigan running back Jamie Morris rushed for 156 yards on 22 carries and was named the game's offensive MVP. Quarterback Jim Harbaugh completed only 6 of 15 passes for 63 yards, but scored two touchdowns on runs of one and two yards. Nebraska outgained Michigan 370 yards to 234.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] said Miss Miniver--she {{went on in}} a {{regularly}} undulating voice--"we DO please men. We {{have that}} gift. We can see round them and behind them and through them, {{and most of us}} use that knowledge, in the silent way we have, for our great ends. Not all of us, but some of us. Too many. I wonder what men would say if we threw the mask aside--if <b>we</b> really <b>told</b> <b>them</b> what <b>WE</b> thought of <b>them,</b> really showed <b>them</b> what <b>WE</b> were." [...] A flush of excitement crept into her cheeks.|$|R
60|$|My shipmates visited me by stealth, and I {{pointed out}} to them, as clearly as in my power, the folly, {{as well as the}} wickedness, of our {{contemplated}} mutiny. I <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>we</b> had come on board the ship voluntarily, and we had no right to be judges in our own case; that we should have done a cruel thing in deserting a ship at sea, with women and children on board; that the Malays would probably have cut our throats, and the vessel herself would have been very apt to be wrecked. Of all this mischief, we should have been the fathers, and we had every reason to be grateful that our project was defeated. The men listened attentively, and promised to abandon every thought of executing the revolt. They were as good as their words, and I heard no more of the matter.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, we're not proud," [...] she {{answered}} after a moment. [...] "I'm {{not sure that}} we're quite proud enough." [...] Yet she changed the next instant that subject too. She could only do so, however, by harking back--as {{if it had been}} a fascination. She might have been wishing, under this renewed, this still more suggestive visitation, to keep him with her for remounting the stream of time and dipping again, for the softness of the water, into the contracted basin of the past. [...] "We talked about it--we talked about it; you don't remember so well as I. You too didn't know-- and it was beautiful of you; like Kitty and Dotty you too thought we had a position, and were surprised when I thought we ought to have <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>we</b> weren't doing for them what they supposed. In fact," [...] Maggie pursued, [...] "we're not doing it now. We're not, you see, really introducing them. I mean not to the people they want." ...|$|E
6000|$|As we {{sat at a}} late {{breakfast in}} the hotel at Allerheiligen, next morning, these young people entered and took places near us without observing us; but {{presently}} they saw us and at once bowed and smiled; not ceremoniously, but with the gratified look {{of people who have}} found acquaintances where they were expecting strangers. Then they spoke of the weather and the roads. We also spoke of the weather and the roads. Next, they said they had had an enjoyable walk, notwithstanding the weather. We said that that had been our case, too. Then they said they had walked thirty English miles the day before, and asked how many we had walked. I could not lie, so I told Harris to do it. Harris <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>we</b> had made thirty English miles, too. That was true; we had [...] "made" [...] them, though we had had a little assistance here and there.|$|E
6000|$|... "You see, Boduoc, had we {{run down}} {{there when we}} heard the cries it would have gone hard with us. The troops {{certainly}} spent no time in questioning; the women might have <b>told</b> <b>them,</b> perhaps, that <b>we</b> had come to their assistance; still {{it is just as}} well that we keep clear of the matter." ...|$|R
60|$|The hysterics {{called up}} Peggotty. The moment my aunt was restored, she flew at Peggotty, and calling her a silly old creature, hugged her {{with all her}} might. After that, she hugged Mr. Dick (who was highly honoured, but a good deal surprised); and after that, <b>told</b> <b>them</b> why. Then, <b>we</b> were all happy together.|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeet it was, t'ough; I {{mentioned}} it several times, and <b>told</b> <b>them</b> how long <b>we</b> {{had been on}} the roat, and how you trove, and how you had sold the sleigh and horses already, and a dozen other t'ings. Oh! we talket a great deal of you, Corny; that is, I dit, and the girls listened." ...|$|R
