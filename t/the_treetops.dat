5|$|Realising {{that his}} advance {{was going to}} be contested, Bowen {{requested}} reinforcements. Consequently, as an interim measure, 59men from Warrego and Yarra were landed under Lieutenant G.A. Hill, until infantry could arrive from Berrima, which was still steaming towards Kabakaul from Karavia Bay. Meanwhile, Bowen pushed on and the Australians were again fired upon by the well concealed Germans and their Melanesian troops, as well as by snipers in <b>the</b> <b>treetops.</b> By 09:30the situation had become grave, and the Australians suffered their first casualty of the war, with Able Seaman Billy Williams mortally wounded. Also among the casualties was the medical officer, Captain Brian Pockley, who died of his wounds in the afternoon after being evacuated to Berrima.|$|E
5|$|The {{flight time}} of the adults or imagines begins {{in the late summer}} to early autumn, but the date depends on the region and climate. The males hatch out earlier than females and create swarms which gather around <b>the</b> <b>treetops.</b> The females seek out leks and couple with the males on the {{uppermost}} shoots. Then the females search for suitable host trees, if possible choosing weak and dry wood. They orient on monoterpene hydrocarbon compounds, which weakened trees produce. When a tree is stressed through dryness or exterior injuries, the compounds pervade osmotic barriers and escape from the bark.|$|E
25|$|The {{flight of}} the mime also resembles that of the model, fluttering, neither weak nor strong, {{sometimes}} staying {{close to the ground}} and at other times flying strongly up into <b>the</b> <b>treetops.</b> It mud-puddles on stream banks in summer. Known to bask and usually sits with the wings spread wide open while feeding on nectar from flowers.|$|E

25|$|In 1939, Baden-Powell and Olave {{moved to}} a cottage he had {{commissioned}} in Nyeri, Kenya, near Mount Kenya, where he had previously been to recuperate. The small one-room house, which he named Paxtu, was located {{on the grounds of}} the Outspan Hotel, owned by Eric Sherbrooke Walker, Baden-Powell's first private secretary and one of the first Scout inspectors. Walker also owned <b>the</b> <b>Treetops</b> Hotel, approximately 17km out in the Aberdare Mountains, often visited by Baden-Powell and people of the Happy Valley set. The Paxtu cottage is integrated into the Outspan Hotel buildings and serves as a small Scouting museum.|$|E
25|$|The lumber {{boom that}} {{swept through the}} hills and forests of Pennsylvania did not reach Laurel Hill Valley until 1886. At this time the area {{was one of the}} last in Pennsylvania that had not been touched by the lumbermen. The {{mountains}} were stripped of the old-growth forests of hemlock and white pine. The lumbermen took the logs to the sawmill where they were cut into lumber. Smaller logs were used to reinforce the mine shafts of the many coal mines throughout southwestern Pennsylvania and West Virginia. The bark of the hemlock tree was used as a source of tannin at the tanneries of the area. The only thing the lumbermen left behind was <b>the</b> <b>treetops.</b> These tree tops were left to dry. The passing steam locomotives on the railroads would ignite this dry brush causing massive wildfires that swept through the mountains and valleys. The Laurel Hill area was left to waste. The forests struggled to regrow in the wake of the wildfire. The hills began to erode. The streams were dying and wildlife was scarcely found.|$|E

25|$|The lumber {{boom that}} {{swept through the}} hills and forests of Pennsylvania did not reach the Great Trough Creek area until 1910. At this time the area was a {{thriving}} second growth forest that had grown {{in place of the}} forests that were stripped during the industrial era. The mountains were stripped by the lumbering operation of Caprio and Grieco who had built a railroad into the area and built a sawmill at Paradise Furnace. The lumbermen took the logs to the sawmill where they were cut into lumber. Smaller logs were used to reinforce the mine shafts at the Broad Top Coal and Mineral Company mines in Jacobs, Pennsylvania.

25|$|The planet Yavin {{made its}} first {{appearance}} in the original film Star Wars (later retitled Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope), released in 1977. The planet is shown in space during {{the approach of the}} Millennium Falcon spaceship as a large red gas giant planet; orbiting this planet, Yavin 4 (or Yavin IV), the fourth moon, appears on screen as a green/blue-colored Earth-like world. Scenes showing the Rebel Base are all set on this Moon, which is covered in dense, mist-covered jungles. The Rebel Alliance has established its base hidden in a complex of ancient temple ruins, known as the Massassi ruins. Tall observation towers stand above <b>the</b> <b>treetops</b> to monitor entries and exits from the base. Once discovered by the Galactic Empire, the Yavin Base is threatened by the Death Star, the Empire's giant space station which has the capability of destroying entire planets. The Rebellion launches an attack on the Death Star with X-wing and Y-wing starfighters; with seconds remaining before the Yavin moon is to be destroyed, Luke Skywalker launches proton torpedoes and successfully destroys the Death Star. The film concludes with a triumphant award ceremony on Yavin in which the heroes are decorated for their bravery.|$|E
500|$|At about 10:30p.m. (accounts differ as to {{the exact}} time), Blanchard began her ascent, {{carrying}} a white flag and wearing a white dress and a white hat topped with ostrich plumes. The wind was blowing strongly, and it appears the balloon struggled to rise. By shedding ballast Blanchard managed to get some lift, but the balloon brushed through the trees as it ascended. Once she had cleared <b>the</b> <b>treetops</b> Blanchard began the display by waving her flag. The balloon was illuminated by baskets containing [...] "Bengal fire", a slow-burning, coloured pyrotechnic.|$|E

500|$|Social birds, blue-faced {{honeyeaters}} can be noisy {{when they}} congregate. When feeding in groups, birds seem {{to keep in}} {{contact with each other}} by soft chirping calls. In Mackay, a bird would fly up [...] above <b>the</b> <b>treetops</b> calling excitedly to its flock, who would follow and fly around in what was likened to an aerial corroboree, seemingly at play. A single bird was recorded aping and playing with an immature Australian magpie (Gymnorhina tibicen) in Proserpine, Queensland. The blue-faced honeyeater has been reported to be fond of bathing; a flock of 15â€“20 birds were observed diving into pools one bird at a time, while others were perched in surrounding treetops preening.|$|E

2500|$|American Airlines Flight 1572 (12 November 1995) â€“ The crew {{incorrectly}} set the altimeter on {{approach to}} Bradley International Airport in Hartford, Connecticut, {{so they were}} flying 70 feet lower than they thought they were. This led to them crashing into <b>the</b> <b>treetops</b> {{as they tried to}} perform a night landing.

2500|$|The Rockingham Mausoleum. A three-storey {{building}} 90ft (27 m) high, [...] {{situated in}} woodland, where {{only the top}} level is visible over <b>the</b> <b>treetops.</b> It was commissioned in 1783 by the Earl Fitzwilliam as a memorial to the late first Marquess of Rockingham; it was designed by John Carr, whose first design, for an obelisk, was rejected, in favour of an adaptation of the Roman Cenotaph of the Julii at Saint-RÃ©my-de-Provence, near Arles. The ground floor is an enclosed hall containing a statue of {{the former prime minister}} by Joseph Nollekens, plus busts of his eight closest friends. The first floor is an open colonnade with Corinthian columns surrounding the (empty) sarcophagus. The top storey is a Roman-style cupola. Like Hoober Stand, the Mausoleum is open on summer Sunday afternoons.|$|E
2500|$|The tall {{forest canopy}} also favored the defenders. Artillery fire was fused to {{detonate}} as tree bursts. [...] "Tree bursts" [...] {{is a technique}} of using air bursts by timing artillery shells set to go off in <b>the</b> <b>treetops.</b> This causes hot metal shrapnel and wood fragments to rain down. Since American soldiers had been trained to react to incoming artillery fire by hitting the ground, the technique proved particularly deadly, until American GIs changed tactics to [...] "hug a tree" [...] during bombardment. While defenders were protected from shell fragments (and wooden splinters from the trees) by their dug-in defensive positions, attackers in the open were much more vulnerable. Conversely, U.S. mortar platoons needed clearings in which to work: these were few and dangerous, being pre-ranged by German troops, so mortar support was often unavailable to rifle platoons.|$|E
2500|$|The native {{population}} of Pennsylvania {{was forced out}} by disease and the American Revolutionary War [...] The Sinnemahoning area was left largely unsettled and wild until the late 19th century when the logging boom that spread throughout the mountains of Pennsylvania arrived.

2500|$|Herbivores can {{be divided}} into two general groups on the basis of nutrition, which grade into each other morphologically: [...] "foregut fermenters" [...] and [...] "hindgut fermenters". The border region is {{correlated}} to bulk: up to [...] are the former; over it, the latter. In foregut fermentation, the animal must [...] "browse" [...] to select the most nutritious plants and then ruminate {{to make up for the}} shorter digestive tract. The hind-gut fermenters are [...] "bulk-feeders": they ingest large quantities of low-nutrient food, which they process for a longer time in a much longer intestine. The main food in that category is grass, indicating that Elasmotherium, like the elephants, was probably a grassland [...] "grazer" [...] moving over long distances to take advantage of the growth phases of grass in different regions. The standard is not without exception, as Indricotherium, the largest land mammal ever, with a weight of 15â€“20tons, subsisted by browsing <b>the</b> <b>treetops.</b>|$|E
2500|$|One Fw 189 survives today.

Approximately 31 minutes after taking off, V7+1H was attacked by Lend-Lease-acquired Soviet Hawker Hurricane fighters. The aircraft dived to escape the fighters, but owing to damage already suffered, could not pull out in time, and it struck <b>the</b> <b>treetops.</b> The tail was torn off, and the crew nacelle left hanging upside down within the trees. The pilot, Lothar Mothes, survived but one crewman was killed in the crash and the third died from blood loss {{as a result of a}} severed leg. Incredibly, Mothes was able to survive two weeks in sub-zero temperatures, evading Soviet patrols while eating bark and grubs as he walked back to his base. Mothes spent the next nine months in a hospital recovering from severe frostbite before returning to the front line, eventually to fly another 100 missions.|$|E
