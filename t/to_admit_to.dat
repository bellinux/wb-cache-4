She visits Northcott, but he refuses to tell her if he killed her son. Northcott is executed the next day.|$|E
5|$|During oral argument, Justice Antonin Scalia {{responded to}} this by {{suggesting}} that some interests a person might express, such as recreational drugs, signified a willingness to violate social norms {{regardless of whether the}} conduct was illegal or not. Paul Larkin, who appeared for the government, had <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>to</b> that there was no case law on entrapment where something that had previously been permitted was now prohibited. At one point, trying to argue that Jacobson did not have access to the defense of entrapment by estoppel (where the government persuades an actor that it is legal to do something, only to prosecute them for it), Scalia told Larkin he'd lost him.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} innovation of the 4th {{century was}} the corps of protectores, which contained cadet senior officers. Although protectores {{were supposed to be}} soldiers who had risen through the ranks by meritorious service, it became a widespread practice <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>to</b> the corps young men from outside the army (often the sons of senior officers). The protectores formed a corps that was both an officer training-school and pool of staff officers available to carry out special tasks for the magistri militum or the emperor. Those attached to the emperor were known as protectores domestici and organised in four scholae under a comes domesticorum. After a few years' service in the corps, a protector would normally be granted a commission by the emperor and placed in command of a military regiment.|$|E

The other 39 districts (around 40% of all district courts) extend admission <b>to</b> certain lawyers <b>admitted</b> in other states, although conditions vary from court to court. For example, the district courts in New York City (Southern District of New York and Eastern District of New York) extend admission <b>to</b> attorneys <b>admitted</b> <b>to</b> the bar in Connecticut or Vermont and to the district court in that state, but otherwise require attorneys <b>to</b> be <b>admitted</b> <b>to</b> the New York bar.

5|$|Max tracks down Stacey to a flat where Stacey {{explains}} {{that she was}} angry at Archie and was worried about what Bradley would do to him after he {{found out about the}} baby. A minute after Bradley confronted Archie, she found Archie on the floor and pushed the bust onto his head, but ran after his fingers twitched, fearing he would call the police. Max eventually tells Stacey that nobody else needs to know that she killed Archie and sends her home. Becca continues to live with Stacey, and tries to exclude Stacey's mother Jean Slater (Gillian Wright) from her life. However, when Jean reveals Becca's involvement in Bradley's death, Stacey slaps Becca, which causes her to have a meltdown leading to getting kicked out by Jean as Stacey tells her mother she can trust her again. Later, Stacey figures out that Ryan must be her baby's father but decides not to tell him so as to not complicate his rekindled relationship with Janine, even when he is with her in the hospital as she gives birth to her daughter Lily. Several months later, at Janine and Ryan's wedding reception, Stacey confesses her fear about Archie still being alive to Peggy, who tells Stacey that Archie is dead and that Bradley killed him, accidentally causing Stacey to confess the truth to her. Peggy wants to call the police but after a fire at The Queen Victoria, Peggy tries to convince Stacey <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>to</b> arson as the sentence would be a lot less than that for murder. She leaves Walford while letting Stacey take care of Lily who needs her. Stacey also tells Ryan that he is Lily's father, and although he initially refuses to acknowledge her, he later bonds with her and gets used to the idea of being a father while Janine and Stacey are arrested on a night out. Upset with this, Janine attempts to sabotage his relationship with Stacey, but her actions inadvertently cause them to realise their growing attraction to each other.|$|E

25|$|The {{charge of}} {{conspiracy}} {{appears to have}} been untrue. Volynsky was tortured twice but even under torture he refused <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>to</b> conspiracy, while admitting the ancillary charge of taking bribes (of which no Russian official of the time was innocent). Volynsky's draft of a General Project of Internal Affairs of the State contained many suggestions for reforms of administration but avoided altogether the subject of imperial succession and prerogatives.|$|E
25|$|After the {{ceremony}} on live television, NBC's Jim Gray repeatedly asked Rose {{if he was}} ready <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>to</b> betting on baseball and apologize. Many people were outraged over Gray's aggressive questioning, feeling that it detracted from {{the ceremony}}. In protest, Yankees outfielder Chad Curtis refused to speak with Gray after his game-winning home run in Game 3. Earlier that season, Rose had been ranked at number 25 on The Sporting News list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players.|$|E

50|$|According to Maimonides, God is an incorporeal {{being that}} caused all other existence. In fact, God {{is defined as}} the {{necessary}} existent that caused all other existence. According <b>to</b> Maimonides, <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> corporeality <b>to</b> God is tantamount <b>to</b> <b>admitting</b> complexity <b>to</b> God, which is a contradiction to God as the First Cause and constitutes heresy. While Hasidic mystics considered the existence of the physical world a contradiction to God's simpleness, Maimonides saw no contradiction.|$|R

25|$|The Saga of the Jomsvikings relates {{that the}} Jomsvikings were highly {{selective}} in deciding whom <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>to</b> their order.

In order to gain admission, prospective members were required to prove themselves with a feat of strength, often taking the form of a ritual duel, or holmgang, with a Jomsviking.|$|E
25|$|The {{separation}} of the independent or open brethren from the Exclusive Brethren occurred when John Nelson Darby denounced Benjamin Wills Newton, an elder of the Plymouth assembly, {{at that time the}} largest of the Brethren assemblies, over disagreements concerning prophecy and church organisation. Darby forced him <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>to</b> theological errors, then attacked George Müller and Henry Craik at Bethesda Chapel in Bristol for accepting two others of that assembly, even though they were not implicated in any of Newton's errors.|$|E

As Brody leaves, Saul contacts Carrie and informs her that Walker (Chris Chalk) is alive and was the POW who was turned. Carrie tries to apologize to Brody, but he rebuffs her {{and goes back to}} his family.|$|E

25|$|The {{colleges are}} self-governing {{institutions}} {{with their own}} endowments and property, founded as integral parts of the university. All students and most academics are attached to a college. Their importance lies in the housing, welfare, social functions, and undergraduate teaching they provide. All faculties, departments, research centres, and laboratories belong to the university, which arranges lectures and awards degrees, but undergraduates receive their supervisions—small-group teaching sessions, often with just one student—within the colleges. Each college appoints its own teaching staff and fellows, who are also members of a university department. The colleges also decide which undergraduates <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>to</b> the university, in accordance with university regulations.|$|E
25|$|In 1917 Switzerland's {{neutrality}} {{came into}} question when the Grimm–Hoffmann Affair erupted. Robert Grimm, a Swiss socialist politician, travelled to Russia as an activist {{to negotiate a}} separate peace between Russia and Germany, in order {{to end the war}} on the Eastern Front in the interests of socialism and pacifism. Misrepresenting himself as a diplomat and an actual representative of the Swiss government, he made progress but had <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>to</b> fraud and return home when the Allies found out about the proposed peace deal. Neutrality was restored by the resignation of Arthur Hoffmann, the Swiss Federal Councillor who had supported Grimm but had not consulted his colleagues on the initiative.|$|E
25|$|Organizational memory {{can only}} be applied {{if it can be}} accessed. To make use of it, {{organizations}} must have effective retrieval systems for their archives and good memory recall among the individuals that make up the organization. Its importance to an organization depends upon how well individuals can apply it, a discipline known as experiential learning or evidence-based practice. In the case of individuals' memories, organizational memory's veracity is invariably compromised by the inherent limitations of human memory. Individuals' reluctance <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>to</b> mistakes and difficulties compounds the problem. The actively encouraged flexible labor market has imposed an Alzheimer's-like corporate amnesia on organizations that creates an inability to benefit from hindsight.|$|E

Jaggar coerces the Council into granting him complete executive power and then has them shot. Immediately after assuming power Jaggar puts down an imminent coup by Stopa, who has been corrupted by the fleshly pleasures of Zind.|$|E
25|$|They entered Derby on 4 December, only 125 miles (200km) from London, with a resentful Charles by then barely on {{speaking}} terms with Murray.

While Charles was determined to press on in the deluded belief that their success was due to soldiers of the regulars never daring to fight against their true prince, his Council and Lord George Murray pointed out their position. The promised English support had not materialised, both Wade and Cumberland were approaching, London was heavily defended {{and there was a}} fictitious report from a government double agent of a third army closing on them.|$|E
25|$|Born August 26, 1990 {{and named}} after his hated father {{who left the}} family, Tory is an asocial self-proclaimed genius with a {{photographic}} memory, adept at playing arcade games. So unchallenged by academics that he resorts to other means of exhausting his energy, he is overly obsessive when something or someone catches his interest, and keeps tabs on every event he deems significant in his life, recording the exact time (down to the minute or second) and place in which they occur. When Colin moves into the apartment across the street, he instantly becomes hooked on tracking his every move. He chases after Colin, blinding himself {{with the prospect of}} uncovering his secrets; he is unwilling <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>to</b> himself the circumstances surrounding his feelings towards the other boy.|$|E
