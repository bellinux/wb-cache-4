25|$|T. aquaticus {{has become}} famous {{as a source}} of <b>thermostable</b> enzymes, {{particularly}} the Taq DNA polymerase, as described below.|$|E
25|$|PA also {{forms an}} octameric pre-channel structure. The octameric form {{was shown to}} be more <b>thermostable</b> than the heptameric form, and hence the octameric {{oligomer}} can persist in the plasma of the host during an anthrax infection.|$|E
25|$|Many {{compounds}} {{of industrial}} and technological importance contain imidazole derivatives. The <b>thermostable</b> polybenzimidazole (PBI) contains imidazole fused to a benzene ring and linked to a benzene, and acts as a fire retardant. Imidazole {{can also be found}} in various compounds that are used for photography and electronics.|$|E
25|$|Miniprimer PCR: uses a <b>thermostable</b> {{polymerase}} (S-Tbr) {{that can}} extend from short primers ("smalligos") {{as short as}} 9 or 10 nucleotides. This method permits PCR targeting to smaller primer binding regions, and is used to amplify conserved DNA sequences, such as the 16S (or eukaryotic 18S) rRNA gene.|$|E
25|$|Studies of this extreme {{thermophilic}} bacterium {{that could be}} grown in cell culture was initially centered on attempts to understand how protein enzymes (which normally inactivate at high temperature) can function at high temperature in thermophiles. In 1970, Freeze and Brock published an article describing a <b>thermostable</b> aldolase enzyme from T. aquaticus.|$|E
25|$|The Yellowstone {{hot springs}} are {{important}} for their diversity of thermophilic bacteria. These bacteria have been useful in studies {{of the evolution of}} photosynthesis and as sources of <b>thermostable</b> enzymes for molecular biology. Although the smell of sulfur is common and there are some sulfur fixing cyanobacteria, it has been found that hydrogen is being used as an energy source by extremophile microbes.|$|E
25|$|Researchers {{commonly}} replicate DNA {{in vitro}} using the {{polymerase chain reaction}} (PCR). PCR uses a pair of primers to span a target region in template DNA, and then polymerizes partner strands in each direction from these primers using a <b>thermostable</b> DNA polymerase. Repeating this process through multiple cycles amplifies the targeted DNA region. At {{the start of each}} cycle, the mixture of template and primers is heated, separating the newly synthesized molecule and template. Then, as the mixture cools, both of these become templates for annealing of new primers, and the polymerase extends from these. As a result, the number of copies of the target region doubles each round, increasing exponentially.|$|E
25|$|Kary Mullis {{conceived}} PCR in 1985 as an {{in vitro}} simplified {{reproduction of the}} in vivo process of DNA replication. Taking advantage of the chemical properties of DNA {{and the availability of}} <b>thermostable</b> DNA polymerases, PCR allows for the enrichment of a DNA sample for a certain sequence. PCR provides the possibility to obtain a large quantity of copies of a particular stretch of the genome, making further analysis possible. It is a highly sensitive and specific technology, which makes it suitable for all kinds of genetic diagnosis, including PGD. Currently, many different variations exist on the PCR itself, {{as well as on the}} different methods for the posterior analysis of the PCR products.|$|E
25|$|PCR greatly amplifies {{the amounts}} of a {{specific}} region of DNA. In the PCR process, the DNA sample is denatured into the separate individual polynucleotide strands through heating. Two oligonucleotide DNA primers are used to hybridize to two corresponding nearby sites on opposite DNA strands in such a fashion that the normal enzymatic extension of the active terminal of each primer (that is, the 3’ end) leads toward the other primer. PCR uses replication enzymes that are tolerant of high temperatures, such as the <b>thermostable</b> Taq polymerase. In this fashion, two new copies of the sequence of interest are generated. Repeated denaturation, hybridization, and extension in this fashion produce an exponentially growing number of copies of the DNA of interest. Instruments that perform thermal cycling are readily available from commercial sources. This process can produce a million-fold or greater amplification of the desired region in 2 hours or less.|$|E
25|$|Misoprostol is {{also used}} to prevent and treat post-partum bleeding. Orally {{administered}} misoprostol was marginally less effective than oxytocin. The use of rectally administered misoprostol is optimal in cases of bleeding; it was shown to be associated with lower rates of side effects compared to other routes. Rectally administered misoprostol was reported in a variety of case reports and randomised controlled trials. However, it is inexpensive and <b>thermostable</b> (thus does not require refrigeration like oxytocin), making it a cost-effective and valuable drug to use in the developing world. A randomised control trial of misoprostol use found a 38% reduction in maternal deaths due to post partum haemorrhage in resource-poor communities. Misoprostol is recommended due to its cost, effectiveness, stability, and low rate of side effects. Oxytocin must also be given by injection, while misprostol can be given orally or rectally for this use, making it much more useful in areas where nurses and physicians are less available.|$|E
500|$|Thermophiles prefer {{temperatures}} from , whilst hyperthermophiles grow {{better at}} temperatures {{as high as}} [...] As they have heat-stable enzymes that retain their activity even at high temperatures, they {{have been used as}} a source of <b>thermostable</b> tools, that are important in medicine and biotechnology, for example in manufacturing antibiotics, plastics, detergents (by the use of heat-stable enzymes lipases, pullulanases and proteases), and fermentation products (for example ethanol is produced). Among these, the first discovered and the most important for biotechnology is Thermus aquaticus. The fact that such bacteria exist also stretches our imagination about life on other celestial bodies, both within and beyond the solar system.|$|E
500|$|Extremophile archaea, {{particularly}} those resistant either to heat or to extremes of acidity and alkalinity, {{are a source}} of enzymes that function under these harsh conditions. These enzymes have found many uses. For example, <b>thermostable</b> DNA polymerases, such as the Pfu DNA polymerase from Pyrococcus furiosus, revolutionized molecular biology by allowing the polymerase chain reaction to be used in research as a simple and rapid technique for cloning DNA. In industry, amylases, galactosidases and pullulanases in other species of Pyrococcus that function at over [...] allow food processing at high temperatures, such as the production of low lactose milk and whey. Enzymes from these thermophilic archaea also tend to be very stable in organic solvents, allowing their use in environmentally friendly processes in green chemistry that synthesize organic compounds. This stability makes them easier to use in structural biology. Consequently, the counterparts of bacterial or eukaryotic enzymes from extremophile archaea are often used in structural studies.|$|E
2500|$|Initialization: This step is only {{required}} for DNA polymerases that require heat activation by hot-start PCR. It consists of heating the reaction chamber to {{a temperature of}} , or [...] if extremely <b>thermostable</b> polymerases are used, which is then held for 1–10 minutes.|$|E
2500|$|RNase H-dependent PCR (rhPCR): a {{modification}} of PCR that utilizes primers with a 3’ extension block that can be removed by a <b>thermostable</b> RNase HII enzyme. [...] This system reduces primer-dimers and allows for multiplexed reactions to be performed with higher numbers of primers.|$|E
2500|$|Also {{early in}} 1985, the group began using a <b>thermostable</b> DNA {{polymerase}} (the enzyme {{used in the}} original reaction is destroyed at each heating step). [...] At the time only two had been described, from Taq and Bst. [...] The report on Taq polymerase was more detailed, so it was chosen for testing. [...] The Bst polymerase was later found to be unsuitable for PCR. [...] That summer Mullis attempted to isolate the enzyme, and a group outside of Cetus was contracted to make it, all without success. [...] In the Fall of 1985 Susanne Stoffel and David Gelfand at Cetus succeed in making the polymerase, and it was immediately found by Randy Saiki to support the PCR process.|$|E
2500|$|DNA {{polymerase}} {{was first}} isolated from T. aquaticus in 1976. The first advantage found for this <b>thermostable</b> (temperature optimum 80°C) DNA polymerase {{was that it}} could be isolated in a purer form (free of other enzyme contaminants) than could the DNA polymerase from other sources. Later, Kary Mullis and other investigators at Cetus Corporation discovered this enzyme could be used in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) process for amplifying short segments of DNA, eliminating the need to add enzyme after every cycle of thermal denaturation of the DNA. The enzyme was also cloned, sequenced, modified (to produce the shorter 'Stoffel fragment'), and produced in large quantities for commercial sale. In 1989 Science magazine named Taq polymerase as its first [...] "Molecule of the Year". In 1993, Dr. Kary Mullis was awarded the Nobel Prize for his work with PCR.|$|E
2500|$|Magnesium is {{required}} as a co-factor for <b>thermostable</b> DNA polymerase. Taq polymerase is a magnesium-dependent enzyme and determining the optimum concentration to use {{is critical to}} the success of the PCR reaction. Some of the components of the reaction mixture such as template concentration, dNTPs and the presence of chelating agents (EDTA) or proteins can reduce the amount of free magnesium present thus reducing the activity of the enzyme. Primers which bind to incorrect template sites are stabilized in the presence of excessive magnesium concentrations and so results in decreased specificity of the reaction. Excessive magnesium concentrations also stabilize double stranded DNA and prevent complete denaturation of the DNA during PCR reducing the product yield. Inadequate thawing of MgCl2 may result in the formation of concentration gradients within the magnesium chloride solution supplied with the DNA polymerase and also contributes to many failed experiments [...]|$|E
