5|$|Supernova {{searches}} {{fall into}} two classes: those focused on relatively nearby events and those looking farther away. Because of <b>the</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe,</b> the distance to a remote object with a known emission spectrum can be estimated by measuring its Doppler shift (or redshift); on average, more-distant objects recede with greater velocity than those nearby, and so have a higher redshift. Thus the search is split between high redshift and low redshift, with the boundary falling around a redshift range of z=0.1–0.3—where z is a dimensionless measure of the spectrum's frequency shift.|$|E
5|$|This metric {{contains}} a scale factor, which {{describes how the}} size of the universe changes with time. This enables a convenient choice of a coordinate system to be made, called comoving coordinates. In this coordinate system, the grid expands along with the universe, and objects that are moving only because of <b>the</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe,</b> remain at fixed points on the grid. While their coordinate distance (comoving distance) remains constant, the physical distance between two such co-moving points expands proportionally with the scale factor of the universe.|$|E
5|$|Through {{observation}} of the light curves of many Type Ia supernovae, {{it was discovered that}} they appear to have a common peak luminosity. By measuring the luminosity of these events, the distance to their host galaxy can be estimated with good accuracy. Thus this category of supernovae has become highly useful as a standard candle for measuring cosmic distances. In 1998, the High-Z Supernova Search and the Supernova Cosmology Project discovered that the most distant Type Ia supernovae appeared dimmer than expected. This has provided evidence that <b>the</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> may be accelerating.|$|E

5|$|In 1964 Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson serendipitously {{discovered}} the cosmic background radiation, an omnidirectional signal {{in the microwave}} band. Their discovery provided substantial confirmation of the big-bang predictions by Alpher, Herman and Gamow around 1950. Through the 1970s the radiation {{was found to be}} approximately consistent with a black body spectrum in all directions; this spectrum has been redshifted by <b>the</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe,</b> and today corresponds to approximately 2.725K. This tipped the balance of evidence in favor of the Big Bang model, and Penzias and Wilson were awarded a Nobel Prize in 1978.|$|E
5|$|Independent {{lines of}} {{evidence}} from Type Ia supernovae and the CMB {{imply that the}} universe today is dominated by a mysterious form of energy known as dark energy, which apparently permeates all of space. The observations suggest 73% of the total energy density of today's universe is in this form. When the universe was very young, it was likely infused with dark energy, but with less space and everything closer together, gravity predominated, and it was slowly braking the expansion. But eventually, after numerous billion years of expansion, the growing abundance of dark energy caused <b>the</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> to slowly begin to accelerate.|$|E
5|$|Negative {{pressure}} {{is believed to}} be a property of vacuum energy, but the exact nature and existence of dark energy remains one of the great mysteries of the Big Bang. Results from the WMAP team in 2008 are in accordance with a universe that consists of 73% dark energy, 23% dark matter, 4.6% regular matter and less than 1% neutrinos. According to theory, the energy density in matter decreases with <b>the</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe,</b> but the dark energy density remains constant (or nearly so) as the universe expands. Therefore, matter made up a larger fraction of the total energy of the universe in the past than it does today, but its fractional contribution will fall in the far future as dark energy becomes even more dominant.|$|E

5|$|At the Carnegie Institution, Rubin {{began work}} {{related to her}} {{controversial}} thesis regarding galaxy clusters with Ford, making hundreds of observations using Ford's image-tube spectrograph. This instrument allowed Rubin to amplify starlight seen through the telescope so they could view astronomical objects that were previously too dim to see. The Rubin–Ford effect, an apparent anisotropy in <b>the</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> {{on the scale of}} 100 million light years, was discovered through studies of spiral galaxies, particularly the Andromeda Galaxy, chosen for its brightness and proximity to Earth. First appearing in journals in 1976, the idea of peculiar motion on this scale in the universe was a highly controversial proposition, dismissed by leading astronomers but ultimately shown to be valid. The effect is now known as large scale streaming. The pair also briefly studied quasars, which had been discovered in 1963 and were a popular topic of research.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, {{at a time}} {{known as}} recombination, {{electrons}} and nuclei formed stable atoms, which are transparent to most wavelengths of radiation. With photons decoupled from matter, the Universe entered the matter-dominated era. Light from this era could travel freely, and it can still {{be seen in the}} Universe as the cosmic microwave background (CMB). After around 100 million years, the first stars formed; these were likely very massive, luminous, and responsible for the reionization of the Universe. Having no elements heavier than lithium, these stars also produced the first heavy elements through stellar nucleosynthesis. The Universe also contains a mysterious energy called dark energy, the density of which does not change over time. After about 9.8 billion years, the Universe had expanded sufficiently so that the density of matter was less than the density of dark energy, marking the beginning of the present dark-energy-dominated era. In this era, <b>the</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> is accelerating due to dark energy.|$|E
5|$|Some redshifts are {{an example}} of the Doppler effect, {{familiar}} in the change of apparent pitches of sirens and frequency of the sound waves emitted by speeding vehicles. A redshift occurs whenever a light source moves away from an observer. A special instance of this is the cosmological redshift, which is due to <b>the</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe,</b> and sufficiently distant light sources (generally more than a few million light years away) show redshift corresponding to the rate of increase in their distance from Earth. Finally, gravitational redshift is a relativistic effect observed in electromagnetic radiation moving out of gravitational fields. Conversely, a decrease in wavelength is called blueshift and is generally seen when a light-emitting object moves toward an observer or when electromagnetic radiation moves into a gravitational field. However, redshift is a more common term and sometimes blueshift is referred to as negative redshift.|$|E

5|$|The {{proportions}} {{of all types}} of matter and energy have changed over the history of the Universe. Today, ordinary matter, which includes atoms, stars, galaxies, and life, accounts for only 4.9% of the contents of the Universe. The present overall density of this type of matter is very low, roughly 4.5 × 10−31 grams per cubic centimetre, corresponding to a density of the order of only one proton for every four cubic meters of volume. The nature of both dark energy and dark matter is unknown. Dark matter, a mysterious form of matter that has not yet been identified, accounts for 26.8% of the contents. Dark energy, which is the energy of empty space and is causing <b>the</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Universe</b> to accelerate, accounts for the remaining 68.3% of the contents.|$|E

He leaves both parents and runs away towards an unknown future. This ambiguous choice somehow leads to him and Anna reuniting happily. The film returns to old Nemo on his death bed. The calculated time arrives and Mr. Nobody's last words are watched by the world. <b>The</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> comes to a halt and time appears to reverse.

5|$|Since Georges Lemaître first {{noted in}} 1927 that an {{expanding}} universe could {{be traced back}} in time to an originating single point, scientists have built on his idea of cosmic expansion. The scientific community was once divided between supporters of two different theories, the Big Bang and the Steady State theory, but a wide range of empirical evidence has strongly favored the Big Bang which is now universally accepted. In 1929, from analysis of galactic redshifts, Edwin Hubble concluded that galaxies are drifting apart; this is important observational evidence consistent with the hypothesis of an expanding universe. In 1964, the cosmic microwave background radiation was discovered, which was crucial evidence in favor of the Big Bang model, since that theory predicted the existence of background radiation throughout the universe before it was discovered. More recently, measurements of the redshifts of supernovae indicate that <b>the</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>universe</b> is accelerating, an observation attributed to dark energy's existence. The known physical laws of nature can be used to calculate the characteristics of the universe in detail {{back in time to}} an initial state of extreme density and temperature.|$|E
