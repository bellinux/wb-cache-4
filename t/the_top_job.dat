5|$|In 2007, the Roosters {{became the}} first club to play 100 seasons of first grade rugby league; {{they were the only}} outfit to play in each season since the competition's {{inception}} in 1908. They appointed Chris Anderson as coach in 2007 and 2008 following two relatively unsuccessful years under Ricky Stuart. On 9 July 2007, Anderson resigned after a 56–0 loss to the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles. Assistant Coach Fittler acted as the caretaker {{for the remainder of the}} 2007 season, before being appointed in August to <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>job</b> for two years. With eight rounds remaining in a disappointing 2009 season in which the Roosters finished with the wooden spoon for the first time in 43 years, Fittler was informed he would not be the coach in 2010, his position to be taken by veteran coach Brian Smith. The Roosters wound up winning only five games for the entire season; twice against Cronulla and once against each of Canberra in Canberra, eventual grand finalists Parramatta and Newcastle in Newcastle.|$|E
25|$|Following the 2008 {{season in}} which the Bombers were {{defeated}} in the division semifinals, Doug Berry (the head coach) was fired. Mike Kelly was chosen to replace him. At {{the end of the}} Cal Murphy era, Mike Kelly was the offensive coordinator and was passed over for <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>job</b> in favour of Jeff Reinebold. With Milt Stegall's early-season knee surgery and drop in production, it was once again speculated that Milt Stegall would retire.|$|E
25|$|Tsang is {{the eldest}} of the five sons and one daughter. His younger brother Tsang Yam-pui, retired as the Police Commissioner in December 2003, after a career with the police in which {{he worked his way}} up to <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>job</b> from the rank of Probationary Inspector. His younger sister Katherine Tsang is {{chairperson}} of Standard Chartered Hong Kong. He married to Selina Pou Siu-mei in 1969 and has two sons, Simon Tsang Hing-yin and Thomas Tsang Hing-shun.|$|E

50|$|After 20 years leading Amgen, it was {{announced}} that Sharer would retire at the end of 2012. A spokesperson for Amgen credited Sharer with the company's success. During his tenure annual revenue had reached nearly $16 billion with operations in 55 countries, up from $3.6 billion in revenue and a presence in 17 countries before he assumed <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>jobs.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In {{his inaugural}} Shadow Cabinet, 17 out of 31 members were women, {{making it the}} first frontbench team in British {{parliamentary}} history to comprise a female majority. Corbyn was criticised for giving what are traditionally seen as <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>jobs</b> (Chancellor, Home Secretary and Foreign Secretary) to men, although he insisted that positions such as Education and Health Secretary were just as important.|$|R
25|$|The {{aftermath}} {{of the world cup}} was similar to the last, as coach John Mitchell was dropped. Only two coaches applied for the position of All Blacks head coach, Mitchell who re-applied and Graham Henry. Graham Henry was the former coach of the Blues and was told he would never receive <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>job</b> after leaving New Zealand shores to take up a contract with the Wales national team. Henry's experience in New Zealand and overseas, as well as the skill shown in turning around the Welsh team worked in his favour and he secured the job.|$|E
25|$|A {{few days}} later in the Second Test at Melbourne, with Benaud still absent, Simpson led Australia for the first time. Simpson's {{appointment}} to <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>job</b> raised eyebrows in some quarters, as he {{had a reputation for}} being abrasive, and others had been more successful and experienced at domestic level. Lawry had led Victoria to the Sheffield Shield in 1962–63 and Western Australia's Barry Shepherd had also been praised for his aggressive and bold leadership. At the time Simpson had scored only 1246 runs at 32.78 and taken 22 wickets at 39.40 in 23 Tests and had not scored a century.|$|E
25|$|Thirdly, {{the deputy}} chief judge is no longer {{guaranteed}} the automatic right of succession to <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>job.</b> Under the new system the deputy only becomes acting chief judge {{in the event of}} a vacancy in the highest office, and only becomes chief judge in his own right if subsequently elected. This procedure was first invoked when Volt himself died and Deputy Chief Judge Hershey became acting chief judge in 2121, winning the second election to chief judge in 2122. Even this rule only applies to a deputy chief judge who was appointed by an elected chief judge. A deputy chief judge appointed by an unelected chief judge does not become acting chief judge; instead there must be an election.|$|E
5|$|Betts was one {{of several}} {{longtime}} editors to leave Vogue around the new millennium. A year later, Sykes, another putative successor, left to concentrate on her best-selling novels set in the city's upper classes and a screenplay. A number of other editors also left to assume <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>jobs</b> at other publications. While some of their replacements didn't last, a new group of core editors formed.|$|R

50|$|This, in turn, gave Botha {{free rein}} in {{constructing}} his cabinet. Smuts was the clear favourite {{to take one}} of <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>jobs,</b> but Botha had other ideas. Of nine cabinet offices, Botha offered Smuts three key positions: Minister for the Interior, Minister for Mines, and Minister for Defence. This gave Smuts control of virtually every area of government; Botha and Smuts now ruled all of South Africa in tandem.|$|R
25|$|He {{scored a}} duck and 55 not out, {{being at the}} crease as Australia scored the winning runs to take a 1–0 lead in the series. Benaud then {{informed}} the Board of Control {{that he would be}} retiring at season's end, so it was arranged for Benaud to return to the team and play under Simpson to give the latter experience for the forthcoming tour of England. Australia lost the Fourth Test heavily by ten wickets, the other two matches were drawn, and the series finished 1–1. Simpson scored half-centuries in both the Third and Fourth Tests and ended the series with 361 runs at 40.11 average. His combination with Lawry consistently propelled Australia to solid starts, posting at least 50 in each of their opening stands. However, he continued to be plagued by an inability to convert his starts into large scores at the highest level of competition. He passed 25 in 8 of his 10 innings for the series, but could only manage three fifties. As a captain, Simpson was less willing to bowl, taking only two wickets for the Test series, and only four wickets in seven first-class matches since taking up <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>job.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1967, a {{transition}} to an elected government was scheduled, and after a power struggle within the military, Thiệu ran for the presidency with Kỳ as his running mate--both men had wanted <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>job.</b> To allow the two to work together, their fellow officers had agreed to have a military body controlled by Kỳ shape policy behind the scenes. The election was rigged to ensure that Thiệu and Kỳ's military ticket would win, and strong executive powers meant that junta, in effect, still ruled. Leadership tensions persisted, and Thiệu prevailed, sidelining Kỳ supporters from key military and cabinet posts. Thiệu then passed legislation to restrict candidacy eligibility for the 1971 election, banning almost all would-be opponents; Kỳ and the rest withdrew as {{it was obvious that}} the poll would be a sham; Thiệu went on to win more than 90 percent of the vote and the election uncontested, while Kỳ retired. With the fall of Saigon, Kỳ fled to the United States. He continued to heavily criticize both the communists and Thiệu, and the former prevented him from returning. However, in 2004, he became the first South Vietnamese leader to return, calling for reconciliation between communists and anti-communists.|$|E
500|$|Ruiz {{permanently}} {{joined the}} Phillies' roster {{on opening day}} 2007, after eight seasons in the minor leagues. He ultimately [...] "grabbed hold of <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>job</b> [...] and never let go". The Phillies signed Rod Barajas before the season {{because of concerns about}} Ruiz's ability to catch, hit, and generally hold up over a full season at the major league level, as seasons there are longer than in the minor leagues. During the season, he honed his confidence and earned the trust of the Phillies' pitching staff, including veteran Jamie Moyer, who commented, [...] "I see a real assuredness to his body language. He's not cocky or brash. He just seems very confident in what's going on." [...] On June 26, Ruiz stole home on the front end of a double steal in an 11–4 home win over the Cincinnati Reds, becoming the first Phillie to steal home since Scott Rolen in 1997. [...] He eventually played 115 games over the season, and from then on was the Phillies' regular starting catcher. Statistically, he committed only two errors, which tied for second-best among MLB catchers with at least 100 games played. He had 27 multi-hit games, hit 6 home runs and 51 RBIs with a [...]259 batting average. At the conclusion of the season, he was named to the Topps All-Star Rookie Team.|$|E

In 2004, the Great Falls Tribune called him [...] "one {{of the most}} influential coaches and educators in the city's history." [...] His successor was assistant principal William Salonen, who led the school from 1983 to 1988. Karol K. Johnson, former dean of students at C.M. Russell High, held the principal position from 1988 to 1990. Johnson's successor was former boys' basketball coach and assistant principal Gary Davis, who held <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>job</b> from 1990 to 1999.|$|E
2500|$|In the October 2012 general election, Regenvanu was re-elected MP for Port Vila, with 2,250 votes, [...] "in {{excess of}} 1000 votes {{more than any}} other {{candidate}} in the country", beating his own previous national record for the highest victory in a parliamentary election. His Land and Justice Party obtained four seats in Parliament. Jenny Hayward-Jones, for the Lowy Institute for International Policy, commented: [...] "The country's young people [...] are likely to have their eye on 43 year old Ralph Regenvanu [...] He is ambitious and offers a younger constituency a more effective voice in the parliament than that often delivered by the country's leaders. Whether he has what it takes to rise to <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>job</b> however, is less certain".|$|E
50|$|During the consultations, Juncker and the EPP {{agreed to}} {{cooperation}} with the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D), the second largest group in the new parliament, as well as secured the backing of all but two member state leaders.

40|$|The {{past three}} decades have been a period of {{exceptional}} change for women. The face of the professions and much of middle management in Scotland is increasingly female. The gender profile of politics has changed significantly. But the face of poverty is also {{most likely to be}} a woman's face while <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>jobs</b> are still predominantly male. These changes have been accompanied by demographic developments with significant implications for Scottish society. It is a tempting story to present the positive developments in women's role as the product of feminist activism. That activism has played a part but we need to look to the structural changes in the economy for the primary causal factors. Economic change presented new opportunities in the labour market. Women grasped them and employers used them. But these opportunities also presented a new set of dilemmas for men and women that are unlikely to be resolved positively without substantial intervention in the labour market. The challenge for Scotland is to continue the progress in women's educational and occupational achievements while creating the conditions for population renewal and also tackling the two extremes of under-representation in <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>jobs</b> and over-representation {{in some of the most}} poorly paid. The big question is whether these objectives can all be combined...|$|R
2500|$|Journalist Martin Bashir {{interview}}ed Diana for the BBC {{current affairs}} show Panorama. [...] The interview was broadcast on 20 November 1995. In reference to {{her relationship with}} Hewitt, the Princess said to Bashir, [...] "Yes, I adored him. Yes, I {{was in love with}} him. But I was very let down [...]" [...] Referring to her husband's affair with Camilla Parker Bowles, she said, [...] "Well, there were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded." [...] Of herself, she said, [...] "I'd like to be a queen of people's hearts." [...] On the Prince's suitability for kingship, she stated, [...] "Because I know the character I would think that <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>job,</b> as I call it, would bring enormous limitations to him, and I don't know whether he could adapt to that." ...|$|E
2500|$|A second {{important}} {{topic was}} {{the reorganization of}} the command structure of army and navy. The office of captain general and admiral general was a federal office. In {{the absence of the}} usual occupant of that office, the stadtholder of Holland, the question was who would now fill it. A possibility would have been to appoint Willem Frederik, who was after all a stadtholder, but in view of his role in the coup of the previous year, {{he did not have the}} confidence of Holland. It was therefore decided to leave this office also vacant, and to divide its functions between the States General and the Raad van State jointly (as far as appointments and promotions of officers was concerned) and the Holland nobleman Jan Wolfert van Brederode as commander-in-chief of the army with the rank of Field Marshal. The latter was only a temporary solution, however, as Brederode soon after died, which caused another round of intrigues to keep Willem Frederik from <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>job</b> in the army. As the function of admiral general had usually been only symbolic, the actual command of the fleets [...] having been left in the hands of the lieutenant-admirals of the five Admiralties, this office did not pose a similar political problem.|$|E
2500|$|In 1965 Hillery succeeded Lynch {{again by}} taking over as Minister for Industry and Commerce. [...] This {{department}} was {{considered one of}} the most important in kick-starting Ireland's economy. [...] Hillery only remained in this position for just over a year, becoming the country's first Minister for Labour in 1966, as industrial disputes began to take their toll. [...] This new department had been a dream of Lemass's for several years and Hillery had the honour of being the first incumbent. [...] Lemass resigned as Taoiseach and leader of Fianna Fáil in November 1966, a shock to many of his political friends. [...] Hillery was invited by Lemass to allow his name to go forward for the leadership of the party, however, he declined explaining that he had no interest. [...] Many historians have suggested that Hillery was Lemass's first choice to succeed him, however others have said that the Lemass pecking order went as follows: Jack Lynch, Hillery and George Colley. [...] In spite of this Hillery was not interested in <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>job</b> in government and, in the end, Lynch succeeded Lemass after a leadership contest with Colley. [...] Hillery retained his post as Minister for Labour following Lynch's reshuffle of the Cabinet, serving until 1969.|$|E
50|$|On 31 July 1879 he was {{appointed}} chairman of the Royal Commission on Finance, which ran for nearly three years.

2500|$|Despite this, Thiệu {{agreed to}} join the coup against Ngô Đình Diệm in November 1963 {{in the midst of}} the Buddhist crisis, leading the siege on Gia Long Palace. Diệm was {{captured}} and executed and Thiệu made a general. Following Diệm’s death, there were several short-lived juntas as coups occurred frequently. Thiệu gradually moved up the ranks of the junta by adopting a cautious approach while other officers around him defeated and sidelined one another. In 1965, stability came to South Vietnam when he became the figurehead head of state, while Air Marshall Nguyễn Cao Kỳ became prime minister, leading a junta that ended the cycle of coups with two years of continuity, although the men were rivals.
