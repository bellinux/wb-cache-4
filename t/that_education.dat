5|$|In {{the nineteenth}} century, anti-feminism was mainly focused on {{opposition}} to women's suffrage. Later, opponents of women's entry into {{institutions of higher}} learning argued <b>that</b> <b>education</b> was too great a physical burden on women. Other anti-feminists opposed women's entry into the labour force, or their right to join unions, to sit on juries, or to obtain birth control and control of their sexuality.|$|E

5|$|Under the new Royalist regime, the Champollion {{brothers}} invested much {{of their}} time and efforts in establishing Lancaster schools, in an effort to provide the general population with education. This was considered a revolutionary undertaking by the Ultra-royalists, who did not believe <b>that</b> <b>education</b> should be made accessible for the lower classes. In 1821 Champollion even led an uprising, in which he and a band of Grenobleans stormed the citadel and hoisted the tricolore instead of the Bourbon Royalist flag.

5|$|Compulsory {{education}} or grunnskóli (lit. “basic school”), is {{the period of}} education which is compulsory for all. The legislation concerning compulsory education was passed in 2007, and in 1996 municipalities took over the running of compulsory education. It comprises primary and lower secondary education, which often {{takes place at the}} same institution. The law states <b>that</b> <b>education</b> is mandatory for children and adolescents between the ages of 6 and 16. The school year lasts nine months, and begins between August 21 and September 1, ending between May 31 and June 10. The minimum number of school days is 170, but after a new teachers’ wage contract, this will increase to 180. Lessons take place five days a week.|$|E

5|$|During the 18th century botany {{was one of}} the few {{sciences}} considered {{appropriate for}} genteel educated women. Around 1760, with the popularization of the Linnaean system, botany became much more widespread among educated women who painted plants, attended classes on plant classification, and collected herbarium specimens although emphasis was on the healing properties of plants rather than plant reproduction which had overtones of sexuality. Women began publishing on botanical topics and children's books on botany appeared by authors like Charlotte Turner Smith. Cultural authorities argued <b>that</b> <b>education</b> through botany created culturally and scientifically aware citizens, part of the thrust for 'improvement' that characterised the Enlightenment. However, in the early 19th century with the recognition of botany as an official science women were again excluded from the discipline.|$|E
5|$|In 1924, Philipp {{attended}} the 4. Volksschule (Pestalozzischule—4th elementary school) in Meissen. Philipp {{was a very}} good student. His mother understood <b>that</b> <b>education</b> was essential to Philipp's future. She worked very hard to raise the funds to pay for higher education in order to send Philipp to a Gymnasium (secondary school). In 1927, she managed to have Philipp admitted to the Franziskaneum in Meissen, the Realgymnasium—a secondary school built on the mid-level Realschule to achieve the Abitur (university entry qualification)—in Meissen. Alma, desperate to secure her son's schooling, wrote to the city council of Meissen in 1932 asking if the school fees could be waived.|$|E

5|$|On 24 May, Abu Nuwar was {{appointed}} as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff following Annab's retirement. Glubb's dismissal {{was met with}} great enthusiasm among Jordan's inhabitants and Arab nationalists in {{and outside of the}} country. However, Abu Nuwar's ascendancy as head of the army was resented by its veteran Bedouin units; he was generally regarded as a competent staff officer, but did not have experience as a commander. As part of his efforts to modernize the army, he mandated <b>that</b> <b>education</b> was a prerequisite for advancement, an act which disproportionately affected Bedouin officers, many of whom lacked formal education. As a result of Abu Nuwar's measure, several senior Bedouin officers were retired or reassigned to non-command posts. To counterbalance opposition to him within the army's ranks, Abu Nuwar established the Fourth Infantry Brigade, which mostly consisted of Palestinians, who he believed would form an integral part of his power base within the military. Abu Nuwar's appointment also contributed to the increasing deterioration of ties between Jordan and the British government.|$|E
5|$|Rutherford was Premier, {{but had not}} yet {{faced the}} people in an {{election}} and {{did not yet have}} a legislature to which he could propose legislation. Elections for the first Legislative Assembly of Alberta were accordingly fixed for November 9. The Conservatives, the young province's only other political party, had already selected R. B. Bennett as their leader. Bennett attacked the terms under which Alberta had been made a province, especially the clauses that left control of its lands and natural resources {{in the hands of the}} federal government and required the continued provincial funding of separate schools. He pointed out that Canada's older provinces had control of their own natural resources and <b>that</b> <b>education</b> was a provincial responsibility under the British North America Act. The Liberals responded to these criticisms by highlighting the financial compensation the province received from the federal government in exchange for control of its natural resources, which amounted to $375,000 per year. They further suggested that Conservative concern for control of lands was due to their desire to make favourable land concessions to the unpopular Canadian Pacific Railway, which had historically been friendly with the Conservatives, and for whom Bennett had acted as solicitor.|$|E
5|$|The basic {{principles}} of New Labour existed in the post-war socialist revisionism of Anthony Crosland. Crosland emphasised that Labour should not just focus on nationalisation and social welfare, but attempt to reform education, resolve wealth inequality, and pursue better industrial relations. His work The Future of Socialism stressed the idea that socialism is moral and should pursue liberty, fellowship, social justice, and equality. This required the redistribution of wealth through a progressive tax system, rendering public ownership {{of the means of}} production, enshrined in Clause IV of Labour's constitution, unnecessary. Crosland also proposed <b>that</b> <b>education</b> reform allow greater egalitarianism, proposing the abolition of the eleven plus exam.|$|E

Heins argues that even if the perceived negative impacts of pornography,hip hop music, and violent films were factually accurate (and she asserts they are not), the ends would not justify the means of degrading the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.

5|$|Writer Ed Burns, {{who worked}} as a public school teacher after {{retiring}} from the Baltimore police force shortly before going to work with Simon, has called education the theme of the fourth season. Rather than focusing solely on the school system, the fourth season looks at schools as a porous part of the community that are affected by problems outside of their boundaries. Burns states <b>that</b> <b>education</b> comes from many sources other than schools and that children can be educated by other means, including contact with the drug dealers they work for. Burns and Simon see the theme as an opportunity to explore how individuals end up like the show's criminal characters, and to dramatize the notion that hard work is not always justly rewarded.|$|E
