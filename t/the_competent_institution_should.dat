Average economic growth in Kosovo during 2006 - 2009 was 4. 8 %. This economic growth, although seemingly large, given the low level of development in Kosovo cannot solve problems to address important economic issues that Kosovo faces, unemployment, poverty etc. Kosovo has a large import of goods and the export-import cover is only 10 %, thus the trade deficit is extremely high. Unemploy-ment remains the main economic problem for many years in Kosovo. The unemployment rate in Kosovo remains high even though there are no clear statistics about the rate of unemployment. According to many stu-dies, whether local or international institutions, the unemployment rate ranges near 40 %. So this high rate of unemployment imposes as a pri-mary and essential task before the Kosovo institutions to establish poli-cies and strategies for promoting employment wich is undoubtedly the best way to combat poverty. According to many studies, {{in order to keep the}} unemployment at current levels, Kosovo needs a growth rate of 7 % and therefore we conclude that in order to reduce unemployment, the growth should be significantly increased over 7 %, and with current developments this is unachievable, neither it is expected to be achieved by <b>the</b> <b>competent</b> <b>institutions</b> regarding economical growth...|$|R

The main objective of the {{research was}} to analyze in an integrated manner the dynamics of occupation of the Meruoca EPA and evaluate their influence on environmental degradation in order to identify conflicts between land use and environmental law. The theoretical and methodological work was based on Geosystemic Theory proposed by Bertrand (1972) and the concept of the Tricart Landscape Ecodynamic (1977), as well as the interpretation of the digital image sensor on LANDSAT- 5 TM, from the use of SPRING version 5. 2. 1 (1996). As observed in the image interpretation by both classifiers, Meruoca EPA has well conserved areas. However the use of rudimentary techniques for purposes of forest overthrow and burn eventually causes an imbalance in the ecosystem as a whole.

The general principle of proportionality therefore requires that a measure is both appropriate and necessary, and as such the European Court of Justice to review both the legality of a measure, but also to some extent the merit of legislative and administrative measures. Therefore, the general principle of European Union law of proportionality is often considered as the most far-reaching {{ground of judicial review}} and of particular importance in public law cases. However, because the proportionality concept potentially concerns the merits of a measure, European judges may defer to the choice of the authority which has adopted the measure, or make what are frequently political decisions.

This note argues that none of the methods by which host Member States may set such levels of minimum protection (namely positive legislation, universally binding collective agreements, and other qualifying collective agreements) allow for real and credible participation by, and representation of, such posted workers, so much so that this is arguably a defining characteristic of the Directive.

The system was fi rst introduced by the Order of obligatory certifi cation of particleboard panels for general use and construction (Offi cial Gazette “Sl. list” 61 / 83), based on laws of the former state. In accordance with the Order, in 1995 SOSM authorized the Faculty of Forestry for conducting the certifi cation of particleboards.

In the field of wood-based panels, a respectable system was built by the end of 1998. The next step was the preparation of technical regulations with the implementation of harmonized European standards. However, for reasons beyond understanding, the system completely collapsed, and in early 2004 it practically ceased to exist. The Ministry of Economy and the Croatian Government abolished all decisions on quality control of wood-based panels, except the obligatorily certifi cation of particleboards performed by SOSM, and it stopped its activities in 2003.

Before the Croatian War of Independence, School in Šidski Banovci also bears his name but the Croatian {{government}} decided to rename the school in Elementary School Ilača-Banovci by the villages where the school is located. However, the bust of Slobodan Bajic Paja {{in front of the}} school in Šidski Banovci has not been removed, and one of the streets in the village still bears his name. Unfortunately, {{at the same time a}} monument to Slobodan Bajic Paji together with mausoleum of 33 anti-fascist partisans in Kalesija was destroyed and the bones were then confiscated and lost by local Bosniaks authorities four months after the end of the war in that country. Although the Public Television of Bosnia and Herzegovina subsequently attempted to investigate <b>the</b> matter, <b>competent</b> investigative <b>institutions</b> in Tuzla refused to open a formal investigation.|$|R
