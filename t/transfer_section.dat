The paperpath transports sheets from the feeder {{to the image}} <b>transfer</b> <b>section.</b> At arrival time, every sheet must synchronize with the photoreceptor.

Combined with a disturbance model, {{this can lead to}} an optimal paperpath design strategy. An experimental setup was built for disturbance identification and control scheme evaluation. 1.

The availability of new technology essentially reduces the amount of uncertainty with which companies deal in their daily operations. In addition, new technology is a basis for the establishment of new companies and the restructuring of old ones.
