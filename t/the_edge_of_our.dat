500|$|In October, 2017, another apocalyptic writer, Terral Croft, {{predicted}} {{the arrival of}} Nibiru for November 19; a prediction again reported in the British tabloid press. Croft describes Nibiru as a [...] "black star" [...] at <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> Solar System, which, rather than colliding with Earth, would form an apocalyptic conjunction with Earth, leading to massive earthquakes. Croft claimed that earthquakes have been increasing worldwide in the leadup to the conjunction, though The Washington Post, quoting the United States Geological Survey, was {{quick to point out}} that earthquakes had decreased in both power and frequency over the year.|$|E
500|$|Ariana Bacle of Entertainment Weekly {{called the}} music [...] "very Chronicle", {{comparing}} the video to Max Landis' previous work. Rachel Paoletta of MTV News describes the music video as [...] "a decidedly darker and more badass video" [...] compared to her [...] "sexy, sultry, and sandy video for 'Love Me Harder'". She {{also stated that}} [...] "Ariana Grande's new video takes us {{to the end of}} the world, and brings us to <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> seats". In response to similarities between the Grande video and the music video accompanying Australian band SAFIA's single [...] "You Are the One", Grande and Landis were accused of intellectual property theft. The controversy centered on similarities in the shared apocalyptic themes and stylistic format (a single, tracking shot) as well as parallels in the beginning of both videos (where a female protagonist exits a vehicle despite the protests of the male driver) and final shot (a lover's embrace as the world comes to an end around them). Members of the band described the similarities as an instance of when [...] "big labels and/or big film firms steal ideas from small independent creatives who are trying really hard to make something different for a change". Despite acknowledging similarities between the two videos, Landis denied that his ideas are stolen from them and commented that both music videos had much in common with a third earlier music video by Perth group Injured Ninja.|$|E

40|$|We report current {{transmission}} data through a split-gate constriction fabricated onto a two-dimensional electron {{system in the}} integer quantum Hall (QH) regime. Split-gate biasing drives inter-edge backscattering and is shown to lead to suppressed or enhanced transmission, in marked contrast with the expected linear Fermi-liquid behavior.

In addition, spectroscopic nano-imaging in mid-infrared 850 - 1450 cm- 1 allowed us to evaluate {{the effect of the}} substrate phonons on the plasmon damping.

60|$|My dearest Miss Mitford,--I {{am quite}} in pain {{to have to}} write a {{farewell}} to you after all. As soon as Wilson had returned--and she stayed away much longer than last year--we found ourselves pushed to <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> time for remaining in England, and the accumulation of business {{to be done before}} we could go pressed on us. I am almost mad with the amount of things to be done, as it is; but I should have put the visit to you at the head of them, and swept all the rest on one side for a day, if it hadn't been for the detestable weather, and my horrible cough which combines with it. When Wilson came back she found me coughing in my old way, and it has been without intermission up to now, or rather waxing worse and worse. To have gone down to you and inflicted the noise of it on you would have simply made you nervous, while the risk to myself would have been very great indeed. Still, I have waited and waited, feeling it scarcely possible to write to you to say, 'I am not coming this year.' Ah, I am so very sorry and disappointed! I hoped against hope for a break in the weather, and an improvement in myself; now we must go, and there is no hope. For about a fortnight I have been a prisoner in the house. This climate won't let me live, there's the truth. So we are going on Monday. We go to Paris for a week or two, and then to Florence, and then to Rome, and then to Naples; but we shall be back next year, if God pleases, and then I shall seize an early summer day to run down straight to you and find you stronger, if God blesses me so far. Think of me and love me a little meanwhile. I shall do it by you. And do, do--since there is no time to hear from you in London--send a fragment of a note to Arabel for me, that I may have it in Paris before we set out on our long Italian journey. Let me have the comfort of knowing exactly how you are before we set out. As for me, I expect to be better on crossing the Channel. How people manage to live and enjoy life in this fog and cold is inexplicable to me. I understand the system of the American rapping spirits considerably better....|$|E
