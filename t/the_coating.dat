5|$|After the {{industrial}} scale production of cadmium started in the 1930s and 1940s, the major application of cadmium was <b>the</b> <b>coating</b> of iron and steel to prevent corrosion; in 1944, 62% and in 1956, 59% of the cadmium in the United States was used for plating. In 1956, 24% of the cadmium in the United States was used for a second application in red, orange and yellow pigments from sulfides and selenides of cadmium.|$|E
5|$|In various recipes, other substitutions and {{additions}} are suggested. The Hairy Bikers (Dave Myers and Si King) suggest Welsh cheddar as {{an alternative}} to Caerphilly and propose that it should be served with a red onion and chilli pepper relish. An Australian recipe suggests Lancashire cheese {{as an alternative}} ingredient. Regarding the breadcrumbs, chef Bobby Freeman suggests using half brown and half white breadcrumbs, while the cookbook for the London-based restaurant Canteen proposes using a combination of boiled potatoes and breadcrumbs for <b>the</b> <b>coating</b> of the sausage.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} that enzymes could be crystallized eventually allowed their structures {{to be solved}} by x-ray crystallography. This was first done for lysozyme, an enzyme found in tears, saliva and egg whites that digests <b>the</b> <b>coating</b> of some bacteria; the structure was solved by a group led by David Chilton Phillips and published in 1965. This high-resolution structure of lysozyme {{marked the beginning of}} the field of structural biology and the effort to understand how enzymes work at an atomic level of detail.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>coat</b> is <b>the</b> {{result of}} a {{controlled}} matting process. Thin, rope-like corded coats are desired, and the grooming should control <b>the</b> <b>coat</b> towards <b>the</b> forming of thinner ropes. <b>The</b> Puli's <b>coat</b> needs considerable grooming to keep its cords clean, neat, and attractive. With age <b>the</b> <b>coat</b> can become quite long, even reaching the ground. Alternatively, <b>the</b> <b>coat</b> can be trimmed short regularly for easy maintenance, although <b>the</b> corded <b>coat</b> is what attracts many people to the breed.

5|$|Beryllium mirrors are of {{particular}} interest. Large-area mirrors, frequently with a honeycomb support structure, are used, for example, in meteorological satellites where low weight and long-term dimensional stability are critical. Smaller beryllium mirrors are used in optical guidance systems and in fire-control systems, e.g. in the German-made Leopard 1 and Leopard 2 main battle tanks. In these systems, very rapid movement of the mirror is required which again dictates low mass and high rigidity. Usually the beryllium mirror is coated with hard electroless nickel plating which can be more easily polished to a finer optical finish than beryllium. In some applications, though, the beryllium blank is polished without any coating. This is particularly applicable to cryogenic operation where thermal expansion mismatch can cause <b>the</b> <b>coating</b> to buckle.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} season is from August to January, though dependent on local conditions. The nest site is {{usually in the}} drooping foliage of a tall shrub or low tree, such as Casuarina, Melaleuca, Acacia, and mallee eucalypts. The site is sometimes near to or overhanging water, and the nest is usually constructed {{at the end of}} a drooping branch, suspended from twigs or foliage. The striped honeyeater often nests in the vicinity of a nesting butcherbird. It builds a deep cup-shaped or bag-shaped nest, with thick walls and the lip of the opening turned slightly inwards. The nest is made from thin dry grass and coated with plant down, feathers or wool, <b>the</b> <b>coating</b> often completely obscuring the grass framework. It is lined with spider webs, hair, wool or rootlets, and on occasion flowers and tissue paper. The striped honeyeater will commonly re-use material from previous nests.|$|E
5|$|The coffee {{farmers of}} Maraba first needed a washing station to remove sugar from <b>the</b> <b>coating</b> {{of the coffee}} bean, under the skin. If this sugar is not removed within 12 hours of picking, the flavour of the coffee is impaired. They built the first station in July 2001 in the Cyarumbo sector, close to the main road, with funding from UNR, the Office des Cultures Industrielles du Rwanda (OCIR-Café), ACDI/VOCA, and the Institut des Sciences Agronomiques du Rwanda (ISAR). The opening {{was late in the}} harvest season, so only 200kilograms (441lb) of that year's harvest were {{suitable}} for washing. However, the results were reasonably good, and the station was upgraded to allow more coffee to be processed in 2002. To bring mineral water from Mount Huye to the upgraded station, ACDI/VOCA helped fund a pipeline, which opened in March 2002.|$|E

25|$|There are two {{separate}} causes of optical effects due to coatings, often called thick-film and thin-film effects. Thick-film effects arise {{because of the}} difference in the index of refraction between the layers above and below <b>the</b> <b>coating</b> (or film); in the simplest case, these three layers are the air, <b>the</b> <b>coating,</b> and the glass. Thick-film coatings do not depend on how thick <b>the</b> <b>coating</b> is, so long as <b>the</b> <b>coating</b> is much thicker than a wavelength of light. Thin-film effects arise when the thickness of <b>the</b> <b>coating</b> is approximately the same as a quarter or a half a wavelength of light. In this case, the reflections of a steady source of light can be made to add destructively and hence reduce reflections by a separate mechanism. In addition to depending very much on the thickness of the film and the wavelength of light, thin-film coatings depend on the angle at which the light strikes the coated surface.|$|E
25|$|A hot {{mirror is}} the opposite, <b>the</b> <b>coating</b> {{preferentially}} reflects infrared. Mirror surfaces are sometimes given thin film overcoatings both to retard {{degradation of the}} surface and to increase their reflectivity {{in parts of the}} spectrum where they will be used. For instance, aluminum mirrors are commonly coated with silicon dioxide or magnesium fluoride. The reflectivity as a function of wavelength depends on both the thickness of <b>the</b> <b>coating</b> and on how it is applied.|$|E
25|$|Mirrors are {{manufactured}} by applying a reflective coating to a suitable substrate. The most common substrate is glass, {{due to its}} transparency, ease of fabrication, rigidity, hardness, and ability to take a smooth finish. The reflective coating is typically applied to the back surface of the glass, so that the reflecting side of <b>the</b> <b>coating</b> is protected from corrosion and accidental damage by the glass {{on one side and}} <b>the</b> <b>coating</b> itself and optional paint for further protection on the other.|$|E

25|$|The {{rectification}} {{action is}} due to a thin coating of aluminum hydroxide on the aluminum electrode, formed by first applying a strong current to the cell to build up <b>the</b> <b>coating.</b> The rectification process is temperature-sensitive, and for best efficiency should not operate above 86°F (30°C). There is also a breakdown voltage where <b>the</b> <b>coating</b> is penetrated and the cell is short-circuited. Electrochemical methods are often more fragile than mechanical methods, and can be sensitive to usage variations, which can drastically change or completely disrupt the rectification processes.|$|E

25|$|The {{reflectivity}} of {{a mirror}} {{is determined by the}} percentage of reflected light per the percentage of the incident light. The reflectivity may vary with wavelength. All or a portion of the light not reflected is absorbed by the mirror, while in some cases a portion may also transmit through. Although some small portion of the light will be absorbed by <b>the</b> <b>coating,</b> the reflectivity is usually higher for first-surface mirrors, eliminating both reflection and absorption losses from the substrate. The reflectivity is often determined by the type and thickness of <b>the</b> <b>coating.</b> When the thickness of <b>the</b> <b>coating</b> is sufficient to prevent transmission, all of the losses occur due to absorption. Aluminum will reflect 85 to 90% of the light in the visible to near-ultraviolet range, but is a poor reflector of infrared wavelengths longer than 800 nm. Gold is up to 96% reflective to near and far-infrared light between 800 and 12000 nm, but poorly reflects visible light with wavelengths shorter than 600 nm (yellow). Silver has the highest reflectivity in the visual to near-infrared of any metal, and can reflect up to 98 or 99% of light to wavelengths as long as 2000 nm, but loses nearly all reflectivity at wavelengths shorter than 350 nm. Dielectric mirrors can reflect greater than 99.99% of light, but only for a narrow range of wavelengths. However, dielectric coatings can also enhance the reflectivity of metallic coatings and protect them from scratching or tarnishing. In mirrors with low tolerances, <b>the</b> <b>coating</b> thickness may be reduced to save cost, and simply covered with paint to absorb transmission.|$|E
25|$|The tin(II) {{chloride}} {{is applied}} because silver will not {{bond with the}} glass. The activator causes the tin/silver to harden. Copper is added for long-term durability.
