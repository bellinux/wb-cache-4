[...] Untener stood up and shouted, [...] "The biggest problem is not whether we use `prince' or `ruler.' <b>The</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> the Mass is boring for most people." [...] Untener encouraged priests to stick to one point in their homilies and to keep their talks at seven minutes or less.|$|E

50|$|A block-based {{algorithm}} {{generates the}} arrival times (and required) times for each node, working forward (and backward) from the clocked elements. The advantage is completeness, and {{no need for}} path selection. <b>The</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> that a statistical max (or min) operation that also considered correlation is needed, which is a hard technical problem.|$|E

5000|$|Uncleanliness {{and illegal}} shops <b>are</b> the major <b>problems</b> of Model Town. One of <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>problems</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> damaged Kahuta/Sehala road. The road has been {{constructed}} {{but it only}} consists of a singly two lane road. After the construction of <b>the</b> road, <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> emerging <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> constant parking of trucks and trailers on both side of road which makes it congested and unsafe.|$|R
50|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>problems</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{inferior}} {{level of}} economy diversification they have. In 2008, they depended largely on services (45.2%), industry (52.9%) and agriculture (1.9%) strictly {{linked to the}} trade with South Africa.|$|R
50|$|Once {{secondary}} structure of RNA is known, the next {{challenge is to}} predict tertiary structure. <b>The</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> to determine the structure of regions between double stranded helical regions. Also RNA molecules often contain posttranscriptionally modified nucleosides, which because of new possible non-canonical interactions, {{cause a lot of}} troubles for tertiary structure prediction.|$|E
50|$|Helena (Regina Duarte) is a sweet, honest, {{sensitive}} and very warlike woman who faces the untimely severity {{of her daughter}} Joyce (Carla Marins), who in turn is abandoned by her boyfriend, the irresponsible Caio (Ângelo Paes Leme). <b>The</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> the girl's father, Assunção (Nuno Leal Maia), Helena's ex-husband, who {{is not in a}} situation.|$|E
50|$|In practice, however, {{windmill}} {{design is}} not very complicated and <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> the tradeoff between cost and reliability. Although the UK and the U.S.A. designs were technically superior, the lack {{of experience in the}} field meant that their machines were less reliable in the field. In contrast, the heavy agricultural windmills produced by the Danes just kept turning, and by 2000 the top three windmill manufacturers in the world were Danish.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{deforestation}} <b>is</b> a <b>big</b> <b>problem</b> in {{this department}} {{because of the}} continuous advance of the human activity, creating a great shock to the natural resources of the region. One of <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>problems</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> uncontrolled hunting of animals in the area.|$|R
50|$|However, even at {{the early}} stages, Tupolev himself {{realized}} that his bureau was unable to develop such an aircraft. <b>The</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> immense heat. <b>The</b> materials necessary to build the heat-shield were developed only in the 1980s for the Buran programme.|$|R
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>problems</b> <b>were</b> that Arena couldn't handle forms, {{and that}} the PNG support was broken from version 0.3.07 on. Earlier Arena {{releases}} had full alpha-channel support, but only with using Arena's own [...] "sandy" [...] background pattern. The animated GIFs extension - presented by Netscape in March 1996 - didn't work properly.|$|R

This School Produced Thousands of Scholars, Toppers etc.. Every Merit List must have the names of Students from Miss Hills School.

5000|$|... "To {{go back to}} nationalism, <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> the Republican mindset, the Reaganite mindset that we are {{all just}} {{individuals}} and let everyone loose to acquire wealth. That hasn't worked. Not only do we have rising inequality, but the people who defend rising inequality say it will lead to more productivity and the pie is going to be bigger blah blah. That hasn't happened, and no one has been willing to look at the deeper problems behind that." ...|$|E
50|$|For the {{families}} that can, <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> that their children, mostly {{between the ages of}} seven and twelve, have to walk the five kilometres into Pisaq along a dirty and dusty road. This road is the main transport route for trucks from the Amazon jungle to Cuzco. Little kids are getting lost in the dust by one truck and then getting run over by the next. The result is devastating. Many have lost their lives or are bedridden for months with serious injuries.|$|E
2500|$|Before 2012 {{extension}} <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> {{that despite}} being the longest of its [...] "new" [...] Russian Metro rivals (new refers to Novosibirsk, Samara and Yekaterinburg) {{it had a}} passenger traffic {{that was one of}} the lowest – 16.8 million annual ridership in 2004. For comparison, the Novosibirsk system was almost double that.|$|R
5000|$|In 2016, city school {{officials}} identified $25 million in needed repairs. <b>The</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> roof, {{with thousands of}} clay tiles which would {{all have to be}} removed (and possibly replaced afterward) for the work. Jack Thomson, executive director of the Preservation Society of Asheville and Buncombe County, called the building [...] "a master work of Ellington." ...|$|R
5000|$|Natalie {{had earlier}} {{directed}} day-camps for kids in her town so she figured {{she had all}} the experience she needed to run a summer-camp. However, <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>problems</b> <b>were</b> to find people and financial support. Many people liked the idea so by small donations and personal connections, they finally managed to get enough to start the camp.|$|R
50|$|A severe {{disadvantage}} is {{that almost}} all radiation can be absorbed by water or water vapour; this is particularly valid for infrared flame detection in the 4.3 to 4.4 µm region. From approx. 3.5 µm and higher the absorption by water or ice is practically 100%. This makes infrared sensors for use in outdoor applications very unresponsive to fires. <b>The</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> our ignorance, some infrared detectors have an (automatic) detector window self test, but this self test only monitors the occurrence of water or ice on the detector window.|$|E
5000|$|... “We {{must give}} heavy bans at last. Both for the clubs {{and for the}} supporters. <b>The</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> the hooligans {{and as long as}} the clubs are {{tolerant}} with them, the problem will become worse. In England they ban fans for life if they are involved in riots. So why don't we do the same? But the clubs must be critisiced as well. They can be warned by a potential ban from playing in European competitions. Then you'll see whether they will comply with the rules or not,” Goumas said to sdna.gr.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> {{finding a}} {{sufficient}} number of z such that both z and z+n are B-smooth. For any given B, the proportion of numbers that are B-smooth decreases rapidly with the size of the number. So if n is large (say, a hundred digits), it will be difficult or impossible to find enough z for the algorithm to work. The advantage of the general number field sieve is that one need only search for smooth numbers of order n1/d for some positive integer d (typically 3 or 5), rather than of order n as required here.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>big</b> <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> how {{to bring}} 21 {{kilograms}} of trinitrotoluene into the building, because main Post office was under constant guard of Ustasha and Germans soldiers. The <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> solved so that they themselves sent a package, {{three days before the}} sabotage. The package was received by Slavko Markon on 12 September, who placed it in a handy magazine, near to automatic exchanges facilities.|$|R
50|$|Working {{conditions}} {{during the}} operation of the mines and mill at Wittenoom were extremely poor, especially in comparison to those of <b>the</b> 1990s. <b>The</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> asbestos dust comprising small airborne asbestos fibres. Employees worked continuously amongst the asbestos dust in the poorly ventilated mine and mill, usually without effective personal protective breathing equipment. Safe working practices and systems of work were not evident.|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} {{describes the}} new classes I developed {{to solve the}} problems encountered while writing a C++ application. The application needed to quickly copy, modify, and match complex objects. Two of <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>problems</b> <b>were</b> enormous memory requirements and slow matching performance. By modifying the somewhat monolithic classes slightly so that they were arranged in a hierarchy and by using the new classes, the matching speed and memory efficiency improved dramatically...|$|R

50|$|The {{building}} is built to BREEAM Excellent rating - the highest level. The elongated {{form of the}} building allowed for natural cross-flow ventilation from the prevailing west-to-east facade. The slender plan allows natural light to permeate most areas of the building without the need to resort to electric lighting. Denton said that although buildings can be designed to be energy-efficient, <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> teaching people to use the building properly. A {{water source heat pump}} was used to provide cooling and heating around the building. The architect's intention was to originally siphon water from the River Irwell nearby but upon discovering an aquifer beneath the building, engineers considered this a more reliable option.|$|E
5000|$|He opines, [...] "Employability of the Education is {{the growing}} {{challenge}} in India; and in this regard, <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> the gap between educational syllabus/curriculum and the skillsets required for the industry at an entry level/jobs as available in the market. The largest youth population is unemployed, even educated youth is unemployed, {{despite the fact that}} the Jobs are available in the market; this is because the education itself is unemployable, which is affecting and would keep affecting the growth of the country very badly unless we take the necessary measures so as to improve the employability of Education among all sections of society; it is a major concern that requires immediate attention." ...|$|E
50|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>problems</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> {{decline of}} the Empire and {{fragmentation}} of the British colonies. Even though Egypt became independent in 1922, British influence there was strong enough for Cairo {{to be viewed as}} part of the British sphere of interest, and the idea of a road continued. After Egypt, Sudan was the next to become independent in 1956, putting an end to the colonial motivation of the dream.|$|R

5000|$|The Verges Sean OKane {{claimed in}} an Op-ed that [...] "Adam Ruins Going Green" [...] {{misrepresented}} {{a report on}} electric cars by Slate magazine. He writes, [...] "But <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> that, when Conover makes this crucial argument in the video, he cites a piece written by Slates senior technology writer Will Oremus in 2013 — a piece that’s more about the difficulty of parsing all this information than it is about how electric cars might be dirty. What’s more, Oremus spends {{a large chunk of}} his article explaining that how “clean” your electric car is will vary depending on where you live, because {{different parts of the country}} use different percentages of these fuel sources to generate electricity." ...|$|E
50|$|The Chinatowns of the 1960s and 1970s {{experiences}} a rapid influx of working-class immigrants from Hong Kong. Since their inception {{in the late}} 1960s, the Hong Kong-born immigrants and mostly unemployed though some work as waiters and busboys Wah Ching (華青) gang members began a campaign of harassment and assault of white tourists in San Francisco's Chinatown, which ultimately {{proved to be a}} predicament for the tourism-minded conservative Chinatown elite of the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association (<b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> that the CCBA simply advocated tougher policing against the gangs rather than resolve Chinatown social inequalities at the core). In North America, Chinese American street gangs often have connections with the tongs and triads. Examples of such street gangs include the Joe Boys and Jackson Street Boys, which are named after the major street of San Francisco's Chinatown.|$|E
5000|$|In an Interview he spoked {{about his}} desire to work for people - [...] "I try and help people in {{whichever}} way I can. I owned an NGO long time ago which is now turned into something which helps the people in whichever way they can. For example we collected {{a lot of things}} for victims of the Nepal earthquake. <b>The</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> that we are not ready for anything bad that happens, be it during disasters or helping people post one. For example the first earthquake in Nepal happened on 25 April and {{it took me a while}} to collect something as basic as matchboxes, candles and so on. People basically are not ready to help others. I firmly feel that we over here need a lot of awareness when it comes to population and at times I even feel bad for the Government." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{mayor and}} the Bolivian {{government}} were wrong to insist on an expensive and unnecessary dam. But <b>the</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> that Semapa's water tariffs had been too low for too long, starving the system of investment.

30|$|Small instances, such as S 1 and S 2 {{are very}} far from real-life <b>problems.</b> Whereas, <b>the</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is,</b> the closer to the real problems. The {{analysis}} of <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> instances show a huge reduction in computing time, and proves the applicability and efficiency of the algorithm {{for dealing with the}} resolution of the model with real-life data. On logical grounds, there is no compelling reason to argue that instances S 3, S 4, or S 5 are more suitable to be solved by the method proposed. The main advantage of the method proposed is the considerable improvement in computing performance, taking the computing time as a metric to compare the proposed method and CPLEX solver. Finally, the method seems to be very scalable, because <b>the</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is,</b> the more speed up reached.|$|R
40|$|Integration {{of skills}} into an {{autonomous}} robot that performs a complex task is described.
