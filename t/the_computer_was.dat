5|$|The player {{would sit}} at the stand and press the buttons to make their moves, while one panel of lights showed {{the state of the}} game, and another showed the computer's {{calculations}} during its move. The computer could be set to make its calculations at various speeds, slowing down so that the demonstrator could describe exactly what <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> <b>was</b> doing in real time. A visual guide attached to the Nimrod explained what <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> <b>was</b> doing during its turn, as well as showing possible game states and how they would be represented by the lights. Signs stating which player's turn it was and whether one or the other had won would light up as appropriate during gameplay.|$|E

5|$|On September 17, 1992, Apple {{recalled}} 60,000 PowerBook100s {{because of}} a potential safety problem. An electrical short, it was discovered, could melt a small hole in the casing, which occurred {{in three of the}} 60,000 notebooks manufactured between October 1991 and March 1992. On the day of the recall, Apple shares closed at $47, down $1.25, but some analysts discounted the recall's importance. In addition, the original power supplies had problems with insulation cracks that could cause a short in a fuse on the motherboard; and <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> <b>was</b> prone to cracks in the power adapter socket on the motherboard, which required a $400 replacement motherboard if the warranty had expired.|$|E
5|$|The logic board, {{the central}} circuit board of <b>the</b> <b>computer,</b> <b>was</b> {{based on the}} Macintosh SE design. Its size, however, was reduced using surface mount {{technology}} to 9×5inches (23×13cm), {{half the size of}} the SE board. This redesign, and the absence of expansion slots, kept manufacturing costs low. This lack of expansion abilities, along with the small screen size and Macintosh's popularity in the burgeoning field of desktop publishing led to such oddities as video displays that connected through the SCSI port by users seeking to connect a larger full- or dual-page display to their Mac. The Classic design was used once more in 1991 for the Classic II, which succeeded the Classic and replaced the Macintosh SE/30.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} home to Singapore, Priya and Honey are fired by their boss (Archana Puran Singh) for taking a non-permitted extension of 5-days in their vacation. In order to keep their jobs, Honey suggests her boss making a television program about Krishna. Aware of Krishna's love towards her, Priya calls him to join her in Singapore to ask her mother permission to marry her. Krishna's grandmother objects to this, saying that {{people will want to}} take advantage of his abilities. She then explains that his father Rohit was hired by Dr. Siddhant Arya (Naseeruddin Shah) to design a computer that could see the future in order to prevent wars and help prepare against natural disasters. However, Rohit later found out that the purpose of <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> <b>was</b> not for good purposes and he destroyed the machine. Rohit reportedly died in a laboratory accident that night, with Krishna's mother, Nisha dying of a broken heart shortly thereafter. Krishna promises his grandmother that he will never reveal his powers, so she permits him to go. In Singapore, during the program's production, Krishna keeps his word and reveals nothing exceptional about himself much to the disappointment of Honey and Priya, who get fired again.|$|E

5|$|The Nimrod, {{built in}} the United Kingdom by Ferranti for the 1951 Festival of Britain, was an early {{computer}} custom-built to play a computer game, {{one of the first}} games developed in the early history of video games. The twelve-by-nine-by-five-foot (3.7-by-2.7-by-1.5-metre) computer, designed by John Makepeace Bennett and built by engineer Raymond Stuart-Williams, allowed exhibition attendees to play a game of Nim against an artificial intelligence. The player pressed buttons on a raised panel corresponding with lights on the machine to select their moves, and the Nimrod moved afterward, with its calculations represented by more lights. The speed of the Nimrod's calculations could be slowed down to allow the presenter to demonstrate exactly what <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> <b>was</b> doing, with more lights showing the state of the calculations. The Nimrod was intended to demonstrate Ferranti's computer design and programming skills rather than to entertain, though Festival attendees were more interested in playing the game than the logic behind it. After its initial exhibition in May, the Nimrod was shown for three weeks in October 1951 at the Berlin Industrial Show before being dismantled.|$|E
5|$|The yearlong {{conversion}} began October 9, 2011. Between October and December, 96 of Jaguar's 200 cabinets, each containing 24 XT5 blades (two 6-core CPUs per node, four nodes per blade), were {{upgraded to}} XK7 blades (one 16-core CPU per node, four nodes per blade) while {{the remainder of}} the machine remained in use. In December, computation was moved to the 96 XK7 cabinets while the remaining 104 cabinets were upgraded to XK7 blades. ORNL's external ESnet connection was upgraded from 10 Gbit/s to 100 Gbit/s and the system interconnect (the network over which CPUs communicate with each other) was updated. The Seastar design used in Jaguar was upgraded to the Gemini interconnect used in Titan which connects the nodes into a direct 3D torus interconnect network. Gemini uses wormhole flow control internally. The system memory was doubled to 584 TiB. 960 of the XK7 nodes (10 cabinets) were fitted with a Fermi based GPU as Kepler GPUs were not then available; these 960 nodes were referred to as TitanDev and used to test code. This first phase of the upgrade increased the peak performance of Jaguar to 3.3 petaFLOPS. Beginning on September 13, 2012, Nvidia K20X GPUs were fitted to all of Jaguar's XK7 compute blades, including the 960 TitanDev nodes. In October, the task was completed and <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> <b>was</b> finally christened Titan.|$|E
5|$|When <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> <b>was</b> not in use, {{contents}} of the memory were preserved {{as long as the}} main lead-acid battery remained charged. The PowerBook100 Power Manager was an integrated circuit, usually placed on the logic board of a PowerBook, and was responsible for the power management of the computer. Identical to that of the Macintosh Portable, it controlled the display's backlight, hard drive spin-down, sleep and wake, battery charging, trackball control, and input/output (I/O). The 100 did add a new feature: 3.5V batteries backed up permanent and expansion random access memory (RAM) when the PowerBook100's battery was being replaced or when the 100 was otherwise temporarily removed from all power sources. This made it a perfect candidate for use with Apple's RAM disk to help increase battery life by accessing the hard disk less frequently, since the 100 was the only PowerBook that maintained the {{contents of}} RAM on shutdown in order to reduce startup time.|$|E

5|$|After {{agreeing on}} an initial idea, Bushnell and Dabney {{began trying to}} design a {{prototype}} based on a Data General Nova. Initially {{they were joined by}} Larry Bryan, a computer programmer who also worked at Ampex. Bushnell and Dabney put US$100 each into a partnership, named Syzygy by Bryan. They soon ran into difficulties with their planned design; <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> <b>was</b> not powerful enough to refresh the monitors as fast as was needed to make the game playable. Bryan realized this early on, when trying to design the code needed to run the games, and left the project before Syzygy was formed without ever contributing any money, but Bushnell and Dabney continued working on the design for several more months. The pair attempted to reduce the load on the computer by replacing subroutines—such as displaying the background stars—with specialized hardware, but it proved insufficient; even reducing the number of monitors was not enough. By the end of November 1970, Bushnell decided to abandon the project as untenable, while Dabney had stopped working on the design a while before. It is unclear if the pair were aware that Data General had demonstrated a more powerful variant of the Nova, sold for US$8,000, running a single game of Spacewar at the Fall Joint Computer Conference in December 1968, though that solution would have been too expensive for an arcade game, which typically cost US$1,000 at the time. Unable to put the game idea out of his mind, however, Bushnell soon thought of a way to manipulate the video signal on the screen without a computer controlling it, and from there Syzygy {{came up with the idea}} of removing the computer altogether and building specialized hardware to handle everything for the game instead.|$|E
5|$|The two-player {{game has}} the players {{engaged in a}} dogfight between two spaceships set against the {{backdrop}} of a randomly generated background starfield. The game was developed to meet three precepts: to use as much of the computer's resources as possible, to be consistently interesting and therefore have every run be different, and to be entertaining and therefore a game. The game was a multiplayer game because the computer had no resources left over to handle controlling the other ship. After the game's initial development, members of the TMRC worked to improve the game, adding an accurate starfield and a gravitational body, and spread it to the couple dozen other institutions with a PDP-1, a process which continued over the next few years. As <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> <b>was</b> uncomfortable to use for extended periods of time, Kotok and Saunders created a detached control device, essentially an early gamepad. Spacewar was reportedly used as a smoke test by DEC technicians on new PDP-1 systems before shipping, since it was the only available program that exercised every aspect of the hardware. Although the game was widespread for the era, it was still very limited in its direct reach: the PDP-1 was priced at US$120,000 and only 55 were ever sold, many without a monitor, which prohibited Spacewar or any game of the time from reaching beyond a narrow, academic audience. Russell has been quoted as saying that the aspect of the game that he was most pleased with was the number of other programmers it inspired to write their own games.|$|E

25|$|By {{the end of}} its {{operation}} in 1956, ENIAC contained 20,000 vacuum tubes, 7200 crystal diodes, 1500 relays, 70,000 resistors, 10,000 capacitors and approximately 5,000,000 hand-soldered joints. It weighed more than 30 short tons (27 t), was roughly 2.4m × 0.9m × 30m (8 × 3 × 100 feet) in size, occupied 167m2 (1,800ft2) and consumed 150 kW of electricity. This power requirement led to the rumor that whenever <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> <b>was</b> switched on, lights in Philadelphia dimmed. Input was possible from an IBM card reader and an IBM card punch was used for output. These cards could be used to produce printed output offline using an IBM accounting machine, such as the IBM 405. While ENIAC had no system to store memory in its inception, these punch cards could be used for external memory storage. In 1953, a 100-word magnetic-core memory built by the Burroughs Corporation was added to ENIAC.|$|E
25|$|Systems as {{complicated}} as computers require very high reliability. ENIAC remained on, in continuous operation from 1947 to 1955, for eight years before being shut down. Although a vacuum tube might fail, it would be replaced without bringing down the system. By the simple strategy of never shutting down ENIAC, the failures were dramatically reduced. The vacuum-tube SAGE air-defense computers became remarkably reliable – installed in pairs, one off-line, tubes likely to fail did so when <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> <b>was</b> intentionally run at reduced power to find them. Hot-pluggable hard disks, like the hot-pluggable vacuum tubes of yesteryear, continue the tradition of repair during continuous operation. Semiconductor memories routinely have no errors when they operate, although operating systems like Unix have employed memory tests on start-up to detect failing hardware. Today, the requirement of reliable performance is made even more stringent when server farms are the delivery platform. Google has managed this by using fault-tolerant software to recover from hardware failures, and is even working {{on the concept of}} replacing entire server farms on-the-fly, during a service event.|$|E
