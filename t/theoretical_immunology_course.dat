Our long term hope is to {{contribute to the development of}} a quantitative <b>theoretical</b> <b>immunology</b> from which practical applications may stem. In order to make <b>theoretical</b> <b>immunology</b> appealing to the statistical physicist audience we are going to work out a research article which, from one side, may hopefully act as a benchmark for future improvements and developments, from the other side, it is written in a very pedagogical way both from a theoretical physics viewpoint as well as from the <b>theoretical</b> <b>immunology</b> one. Furthermore, we have chosen to test our model describing a wide range of features of the adaptive immune response in only a paper: this has been necessary in order to emphasize the benefit available when using disordered statistical mechanics as a tool for the investigation. However, as a consequence, each section is not at all exhaustive and would deserve deep investigation: for the sake of completeness, we restricted details in the analysis of each feature with the aim of introducing a self-consistent model.

40|$|Abstract. The {{idiotypic network}} {{has a long}} and {{chequered}} history in both <b>theoretical</b> <b>immunology</b> and Artificial Immune Systems. In terms of the latter, the drive for engineering applications {{has led to a}} diluted interpretation of the immunological models. Research inspired by <b>theoretical</b> <b>immunology</b> has produced compelling models of self-organised tolerance and immunity, but currently fail to have any practical engineering applicability. In this paper, we briefly discuss the engineering applicability of “self-affirming ” idiotypic networks, leading to a suggestion that the “Third Generation ” network models represent a way forward in this respect. Results obtained by implementing and extending a discrete model of this type of network suggest that the extended prototype is capable of two context-dependent modes of immune response, readily applicable to unsupervised machine-learning. ...|$|R

Students found a significant decrease in cortisol over time. Additionally, there was a trend that supported the overall student hypothesis regarding the effect of stress and immune function. Compared with the same <b>Immunology</b> <b>course</b> that included an instructor-designed experiment using enzyme immunoassays for cortisol and sIgA, several assessments (e. g., final grades and comments on student evaluations) show that overall learning seemed to be much better in the course with the student-directed research project...|$|R

This paper proposes one such framework, discusses the suitability of AIS as a novel soft computing paradigm and reviews those works from the literature that integrate AIS with other approaches, focusing ANN, EA and FS. Similarities and differences between AIS and each of the other approaches are outlined. New trends on how to create hybrids of these paradigms and what could be the benefits of this hybridization are also presented. ...|$|R

Thus, a generic systematic procedure which bases on a multistep experimental design approach for determining the efficient system parameters for AIS is presented.

40|$|The {{immune system}} is a genuine example of an {{information}} processing system. Information in the {{immune system is}} present in the form of antigens (self and non-self) and receptor molecules. These are information-bearing structures that interact upon complementary matching. Embedded in a universe of > 10 ⁵ self antigens, the immune system is able to pick up novel information (i. e., foreign antigen) and is able to remember it specifically (i. e., immunological memory). These information-processing (or cognitive) properties of the immune system arise somehow from the cellular and molecular interactions between the components of the system. The immune system is composed of many different cell types and molecules. This enormous complexity hampers our understanding of the "functioning" (or information processing) of the immune system. <b>Theoretical</b> <b>immunology</b> aims to tackle this problem.

40|$|The {{complexity}} of {{systems and the}} way they work together will require new approaches for their development and operation, since conventional deterministic approaches may not be sufficient for enabling the provision of services expected from these systems.

40|$|Immunology has {{traditionally}} been a qualitative science describing the cellular and molecular components {{of the immune system}} and their functions. Only quite recently have new experimental techniques paved the way for a more quantitative approach of immunology. Lymphocyte telomere lengths have been measured to get insights into the proliferation rate of different lymphocyte subsets, T-cell receptor excision circles have been used to quantify the daily output of new T cells from the thymus, and bromodeoxyuridine and stable isotope labeling have been applied to measure proliferation and death rates of naive and memory lymphocytes. A common problem of the above techniques is the translation of the resulting data into relevant parameters, such as the typical division and death rate of the different lymphocyte populations. <b>Theoretical</b> <b>immunology</b> has contributed significantly to the interpretation of such quantitative experimental data, thereby resolving diverse controversies and, most importantly, has suggested novel experiments, allowing for more conclusive and quantitative interpretations.
