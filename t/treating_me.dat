500|$|Prior to {{the release}} of Vocal Studies + Uprock Narratives, Herren {{performed}} at the All Tomorrow's Parties festival at Camber Sands in April 2001. The festival was curated by the band Tortoise, with whom Herren toured as the opening act in May 2001. Vocal Studies + Uprock Narratives was released on June 11, 2001 through Warp on vinyl, compact disc and download. It was Warp's second release by an American musician, following Richard Devine's Lipswitch which had been released in the previous January. The album did not chart in the United States or United Kingdom. Herren was not happy on how the album was promoted, saying: [...] "I couldn't understand why they were <b>treating</b> <b>me</b> like I was 10. They were ignoring all the cultural references that were to be found throughout that first record." [...] He felt the album [...] "would have been easier to package if I'd been from the Bronx. Instead I was from Miami, and lived in Decatur." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2010, Torres {{began the}} season as a backup outfielder again. On April 25, he {{replaced}} Eugenio Vélez (who had been filling in for the injured Aaron Rowand) as the Giants' center fielder, playing six games until Rowand's return on May 1. Upon Rowand's return, Torres returned to a reserve role until May 9, {{when he became a}} starting outfielder {{for the rest of the}} season after Mark DeRosa hurt his wrist. On May 30, he had a game-ending RBI single in the 10th inning against Carlos Rosa to give the Giants a 65 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks. By midseason, he had replaced Rowand as the Giants' everyday center fielder and leadoff hitter. After the Giants blew a 92 lead over the Florida Marlins on July 28, Torres had a game-ending single in the 10th inning against Clay Hensley to give the Giants a 109 win. After the Giants blew a 73 lead on August 12, Torres had a game-ending RBI single against Andrew Cashner in the ninth inning to give the Giants an 87 victory over the Chicago Cubs. On the morning of September 12, Torres woke up with severe stomach pain and was diagnosed with appendicitis. He underwent an appendectomy the same day. He returned to the lineup roughly two weeks later, and on October 1 it was announced that he had won the 2010 Willie Mac Award. Torres said upon receiving the award, [...] "It's the best. It's an honor for me from my teammates. I've been blessed and I'm happy and just thank God for everything, putting me here and these guys <b>treating</b> <b>me</b> like a family." [...] In 139 games (507 at bats), Torres hit [...]268 with 84 runs scored, 136 hits, 16 home runs, and 63 RBI. He ranked fourth in the NL in doubles (43, behind Jayson Werth's 46 and Matt Holliday's and Ryan Braun's 45) and ranked seventh in the NL in triples (eight). He finished the year having led the Giants in stolen bases with 26.|$|E
2500|$|... "I've {{got a lot}} {{of respect}} for Jerry Reinsdorf, I do. But I really thought, the {{relationship}} we had over the last 16 years, he would have picked up the phone to say, 'Big guy, we're moving forward. We're going somewhere different. We don't know your situation or what's going to happen.' I can live with that, I really can", Thomas said. [...] "But <b>treating</b> <b>me</b> like some passing-by-player. I've got no respect for that." [...] Thomas said he was not bitter or angry and had joined the A's with an open mind.|$|E

5000|$|In 1978, [...] "You <b>Treat</b> <b>Me</b> Bad" [...] was immortalized on the {{compilation}} album, Pebbles, Volume 1 {{and later}} was the closing track for Teenage Shutdown! You <b>Treated</b> <b>Me</b> Bad!. In 2009, an album, You <b>Treat</b> <b>Me</b> Bad 1965-1967, containing {{all of the}} group's previously unreleased material and alternate takes was released, {{and in the same}} year The JuJus were inducted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends hall of fame.|$|R
2500|$|Gilmour later said, [...] "When {{we first}} started playing World Series Cricket, I think we {{lost a lot of}} friends ... not player-wise, I don't think ... the players are OK. It's the {{officials}} that take a bit of swaying again... There were officials with the cricket association who I regarded as good friends and I had drinks with them whenever I was in Sydney or whenever they were in Newcastle. And they started <b>treating</b> <b>me</b> and the other players in WSC like lepers. I think that was the most hurtful thing of all. It was something that they didn't go along with and they just couldn't handle it".".|$|E
2500|$|Although Moore's work {{numbered}} {{amongst the}} most popular strips to appear in 2000 AD, Moore himself became increasingly concerned {{at the lack of}} creator's rights in British comics. In 1985, he talked to fanzine Arkensword, noting that he had stopped working for all British publishers bar IPC, [...] "purely for the reason that IPC so far have avoided lying to me, cheating me or generally <b>treating</b> <b>me</b> like shit." [...] He did join other creators in decrying the wholesale relinquishing of all rights, and in 1986 stopped writing for 2000 AD, leaving mooted future volumes of the Halo Jones story unstarted. Moore's outspoken opinions and principles, particularly on the subject of creator's rights and ownership, would see him burn bridges with a number of other publishers {{over the course of his}} career.|$|E
2500|$|And I {{passed a}} house, {{and there was}} a woman, and I {{remember}} that she was a little tongue-tied, sitting on a step. And she saw what was happening, and she called me in. And she spent about 20 minutes <b>treating</b> <b>me</b> like an adult, teaching me how - of course the ends were gone off the shoestrings - to twist the end and put it through the hole. Then we laced and unlaced my shoes three or four times until I knew how to do it, and then she taught me how to tie a knot. And we sat there for a while, and then I went along. And, as little as I was, I thought, [...] "I'd like to be like that kind of person. I'd like to be like her." [...] I think it influenced my entire life, a little thing.|$|E
6000|$|... "And supposing that I am in {{love with}} her, is it to be {{wondered}} at, seeing how you <b>treat</b> <b>me</b> and have <b>treated</b> <b>me</b> for years?" [...] he answered furiously. [...] "It is utterly false {{to say that she}} is my mistress." ...|$|R

2500|$|Hamas {{turned over}} a two-minute 40-second video to Israel. Senior IDF officers, Defense Minister Ehud Barak, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu viewed the footage, after which Barak spoke to Shalit's father Noam and {{grandfather}} Zvi by telephone. The video {{was sent to}} the Shalit family home in Mitzpe Hila, with the family reportedly viewing it together. Members of the Israeli negotiating team for Shalit's release viewed the footage to ensure it met with Israel's demands, primarily with regard to how recently it was filmed. The , the only contact from Shalit other than three letters written by him and an audio tape released in June 2007, was released to the public at around 4:00 in the afternoon on Israeli television. In the video, Shalit is seen sitting in a chair in a bare room, looking frail and emaciated but otherwise healthy. He addressed Netanyahu and his parents, and reminisced about times he spent with his family. At the end of the video, he stated that the [...] "Mujahideen of the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades are <b>treating</b> <b>me</b> very well". During the video, he held up a newspaper dated 14 September 2009.|$|E
