5|$|In January 1918, Andrić joined several South Slav nationalists in editing a {{short-lived}} pan-Yugoslav periodical called Književni jug (Literary South). Here {{and in other}} periodicals, Andrić published book reviews, plays, verse, and translations.

5|$|In the Philosophie Zoologique, Lamarck {{proposed}} that species could acquire new characteristics from influences in their environment, in two rules that he named as laws. His first law stated that use or disuse of a body's structures would {{cause them to}} grow or shrink in <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>several</b> generations. His second law held that any changes made in this way would be inherited. Together, Lamarck's laws imply the steady adaptation of animals to their environments.|$|E
5|$|Mount Pleasant Road was {{constructed}} over <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>several</b> years by interconnecting several existing streets {{as well as}} building a new road in other places; at that time, a road existed {{to the north and}} south of the cemetery. The road to the south, running between Clarence Street (renamed Heath Street on April 7, 1913) and Moore Avenue, was known as Lyle Street and Kinsman Avenue. The road to the north, running between Balliol Street and Merton Street, was known as Alberta Avenue.|$|E

5|$|In 1164, Nur al-Din {{dispatched}} Shirkuh to lead an {{expeditionary force}} {{to prevent the}} Crusaders from establishing a strong presence in an increasingly anarchic Egypt. Shirkuh enlisted Ayyub's son, Saladin, as an officer under his command. They successfully drove out Dirgham, the vizier of Egypt, and reinstated his predecessor Shawar. After being reinstated, Shawar ordered Shirkuh to withdraw his forces from Egypt, but Shirkuh refused, claiming it was Nur al-Din's will that he remain. Over <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>several</b> years, Shirkuh and Saladin defeated the combined forces of the Crusaders and Shawar's troops, first at Bilbais, then at a site near Giza, and in Alexandria, where Saladin would stay to protect while Shirkuh pursued Crusader forces in Lower Egypt.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, a {{congestion}} charge {{was introduced to}} reduce traffic volumes in the city centre. With a few exceptions, motorists are required to pay £10 per day to drive within a defined zone encompassing much of central London. Motorists who are residents of the defined zone can buy a greatly reduced season pass. London government initially expected the Congestion Charge Zone to increase daily peak period Underground and bus users by 20,000 people, reduce road traffic by 10 to 15 per cent, increase traffic speeds by 10 to 15 per cent, and reduce queues by 20 to 30 per cent.

5|$|Jovanović {{strove to}} make The Takovo Uprising as {{historically}} accurate as possible. He studied authentic costumes and armaments {{from the time}} of the uprising, visited Takovo and sketched the church and large tree under which Obrenović led the people to revolt. Jovanović also studied the facial features of locals and sketched them, and so some of their faces appear in the painting. Jovanović painted The Takovo Uprising in Paris over <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>several</b> months in 1894. It was first exhibited the following year at his brother Milan's photography studio in Belgrade, not far from King Alexander's residence, the Old Palace.

5|$|New Multitudes is a Woody Guthrie tribute album {{performed}} by Jay Farrar, Will Johnson, Anders Parker, and Jim James {{to commemorate the}} 100th anniversary of Guthrie's birth, released through Rounder Records on February 28, 2012. The project was initiated by Woody's daughter Nora Guthrie to have Farrar add music to her father's lyrics—specifically, his earliest songwriting years in Los Angeles. Over <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>several</b> years, he invited the others to collaborate and recorded {{at a variety of}} locations across the United States. Each artist wrote music to lyrics that inspired him and presented it to the collaborators for recording. The result is an album with diverse musical genres that has garnered positive reviews from critics for its varied styles and instrumentation. The quartet promoted the album with a small promotional tour that took them to record stores, radio programs, theaters, and folk festivals. The group has plans for releasing a second volume.|$|E

5|$|Several {{attempts}} at a Franco-Mongol alliance against the Islamic caliphates, their common enemy, {{were made by}} various leaders among the Frankish Crusaders and the Mongol Empire in the 13th century. Such an alliance might have seemed an obvious choice: the Mongols were already sympathetic to Christianity, given the presence of many influential Nestorian Christians in the Mongol court. The Franks (Western Europeans {{and those in the}} Crusader States of the Levant) were open to the idea of support from the East, in part owing to the long-running legend of the mythical Prester John, an Eastern king in a magical kingdom who many believed would one day come to the assistance of the Crusaders in the Holy Land. The Franks and Mongols also shared a common enemy in the Muslims. However, despite many messages, gifts, and emissaries over <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>several</b> decades, the often-proposed alliance never came to fruition.|$|E
5|$|Sponges {{have three}} asexual methods of reproduction: after fragmentation; by budding; and by {{producing}} gemmules. Fragments of sponges may be detached by currents or waves. They use {{the mobility of}} their pinacocytes and choanocytes and reshaping of the mesohyl to re-attach themselves to a suitable surface and then rebuild themselves as small but functional sponges over <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>several</b> days. The same capabilities enable sponges that have been squeezed through a fine cloth to regenerate. A sponge fragment can only regenerate if it contains both collencytes to produce mesohyl and archeocytes to produce all the other cell types. A very few species reproduce by budding.|$|E
5|$|Sycamore {{trees are}} very {{variable}} across their wide range and have strategies to prevent self-pollination, which is undesirable because it limits the genetic {{variation of the}} progeny and may depress their vigour. Most inflorescences are formed of a mixture of functionally male and functionally female flowers. On any one tree, one or other of these flower types opens first and the other type opens later. Some trees may be male-starters in one year and female-starters in another. The change from one sex to the other may take place on different dates {{in different parts of}} the crown, and different trees in any one population may come into bloom over <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>several</b> weeks, so that cross-pollination is encouraged, although self-pollination may not be completely prevented.|$|E

5|$|At 22:00, {{troops of}} the Chinese 39th Army began a frontal assault on Hill 205, {{signaled}} by drums and whistles. An estimated platoon-sized force of Chinese made the first attack. The Rangers fought back with heavy small arms fire and several pre-sighted artillery concentrations, repulsing this first attack at 22:50. A number of Rangers were wounded in this attack, including Puckett, who refused evacuation. At 23:00 the Chinese launched a second attack which was quickly repelled, as was a third attack several minutes later. Both of these attacks were an estimated company in strength. The Rangers inflicted heavy casualties each time {{as a result of}} a well-established defensive perimeter, though the platoon of tanks at the foot of the hill opposite the Chinese attack were unable to assist the Rangers, as the crews had no experience in night operations. By 23:50 the Chinese began attacking in greater numbers, with an estimated two companies advancing at a time, moving to within hand grenade range. The Rangers began to run low on ammunition while their casualties continued to mount, and Puckett was wounded again. Over <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>several</b> hours the Chinese launched a fourth and a fifth attack, each of which was narrowly pushed back by the Rangers. The Rangers were then ordered to fix bayonets in preparation for the next attack.|$|E
5|$|In 1910, Sadler went to Europe {{and studied}} {{psychiatry}} {{for a year}} under Sigmund Freud. Sometime between 1906 and 1911, Sadler attempted to treat a patient with an unusual sleep condition. While the patient was sleeping he spoke to Sadler and claimed to be an extraterrestrial. Sadler spent years observing the sleeping man {{in an effort to}} explain the phenomenon, and eventually decided the man had no mental illness and that his words were genuine. The man's identity was never publicized, but speculation has focused on Sadler's brother-in-law, Wilfred Kellogg. Over <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>several</b> years, Sadler and his assistants visited the man while he slept, conversing with him about spirituality, history, and cosmology, and asking him questions. A larger number of interested people met at Sadler's home to discuss the man's responses and to suggest additional questions. The man's words were eventually published in The Urantia Book, and the Urantia Foundation was created to assist Sadler in spreading the book's message. It is not known who wrote and edited the book, but several commentators have speculated that Sadler played a guiding role in its publication. Although it never became the basis of an organized religion, the book attracted followers who devoted themselves to its study, and the movement continued after Sadler's death.|$|E
