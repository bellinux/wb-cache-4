5|$|According <b>to</b> <b>transit</b> {{advocate}} Steve Munro, the SSE will be {{built to}} use only automatic train control. This would preclude the operation of T1 subway cars on the extension {{as it would be}} too expensive to convert T1 cars to ATC.|$|E
5|$|As {{the planet}} is not known <b>to</b> <b>transit</b> from Earth and {{atmospheric}} conditions are not observable with current technology, no atmosphere for the planet has been confirmed to date. As such, all climate predictions for the planet are based on predicted orbits and computer modelling of theoretical atmospheric conditions.|$|E
5|$|From Pallas, Mercury, Venus, Mars, and Earth can {{occasionally}} appear <b>to</b> <b>transit,</b> or pass {{in front}} of, the Sun.

Two larger motor vessels, the Manchester Faith and Fame, 4,460 grt, were commissioned in April 1959, and the Faith quickly became the first commercial vessel <b>to</b> <b>transit</b> the newly opened St Lawrence Seaway with its larger locks.|$|E
5|$|Queen Mary 2 is a post-Panamax ship. As a result, Queen Mary 2 must {{circumnavigate}} South America {{to cross}} between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. The {{decision not to}} constrain her size <b>to</b> <b>transit</b> the Panama Canal was taken as Queen Elizabeth 2 only transited once a year, during the world cruise. Cunard decided to pass up the convenience of the occasional passage in favour of a greater passenger capacity.|$|E
5|$|The {{planet was}} one of 700 {{planetary}} candidates considered by Kepler in its first 43 days of operation. It was highlighted {{as a part of}} one of five star systems that seemed to hold multiple transiting planets. Kepler-9c and Kepler-9b were confirmed as the first planets discovered <b>to</b> <b>transit</b> the same star.|$|E

5|$|After {{a stop at}} Pearl Harbor for boiler {{repairs and}} to offload her Army passengers, Yancey sailed for Balboa, Panama Canal Zone, {{reaching}} there {{on the last day}} of the year; she was the last ship <b>to</b> <b>transit</b> the Panama Canal in 1945. On 6 January 1946, Yancey cleared Cristobal, Canal Zone, bound for Louisiana. After a brief stop at New Orleans, the attack cargo ship proceeded on, via Jacksonville, Florida, to Norfolk, where she arrived on 29 January. Less than a month later, on 27 February, Yancey sailed farther north and reached the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard the following day.|$|E
5|$|Gliese 581c {{is likely}} to lie outside the {{habitable}} zone. No direct evidence has been found for water to be present, and it is probably not present in the liquid state. Techniques like the one {{used to measure the}} extrasolar planet HD 209458 b may in the future be used to determine the presence of water in the form of vapor in the planet's atmosphere, but only in the rare case of a planet with an orbit aligned so as <b>to</b> <b>transit</b> its star, which Gliese 581c is not known to do.|$|E
40|$|The {{alpha-glucosidase}} inhibitors acarbose and miglitol {{have been}} successfully used to control postprandial hyperglycaemia in diabetics. They probably work by slowing carbohydrate digestion and absorption, but their effect on mouth <b>to</b> caecum <b>transit</b> time has not been studied. The effect acarbose (100 mg), miglitol (100 mg), and placebo on mouth <b>to</b> caecum <b>transit</b> time (380 kcal breakfast with 20 g of lactulose) was investigated in 18 normal volunteers using breath hydrogen analysis. Both miglitol and acarbose significantly increased breath hydrogen excretion (F 2, 34 = 6. 31, p = 0. 005) and shortened the mouth <b>to</b> caecum <b>transit</b> time (F 2, 34 = 3. 49, p = 0. 04) after breakfast compared with placebo. There was a significant negative correlation between breath hydrogen excretion and mouth <b>to</b> caecum <b>transit</b> time suggesting that with shorter transit times significantly more carbohydrates were spilled into the colon. These results indicate that alpha-glucosidase inhibitors accelerate mouth <b>to</b> caecum <b>transit</b> time by inducing carbohydrate malabsorption...|$|R

5|$|HMS Delight was a D-class {{destroyer}} {{built for}} the Royal Navy in the early 1930s. Delight was initially assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet before she {{was transferred to the}} China Station in early 1935. She was temporarily deployed in the Red Sea during late 1935 during the Abyssinia Crisis, before returning to her duty station where she remained until mid-1939. Delight was transferred back to the Mediterranean Fleet just before the Second World War began in September 1939. She served with the Home Fleet during the Norwegian Campaign. The ship was sunk by German dive-bombers on 29 July 1940 while attempting <b>to</b> <b>transit</b> the English Channel in daylight.|$|E
5|$|In January 2012, {{the federal}} {{government}} of Brazil enacted the Urban Mobility Law that authorizes municipalities to implement congestion pricing to reduce traffic flows. The law also seeks to {{encourage the use of}} public transportation and reduce air pollution. According to the law, revenues from congestion charges should be destined exclusively to urban infrastructure for public transportation and non-motorized modes of locomotion (such as walking and cycling), and to finance public subsidies <b>to</b> <b>transit</b> fares. The law went into effect in April 2013.|$|E
5|$|In Turkey {{the plan}} called for {{diplomatic}} pressure on 8 June 1944, following the Normandy Landings, to allow the Allied forces access to Turkey {{for the purposes of}} staging an invasion of Greece (in support of the story of Zeppelin). At the same time the Soviets would make a similar request of Bulgaria. However, it was agreed that this risked a pre-emptive invasion of Turkey by German forces. Instead, the Allies took advantage of German warships being permitted, in June, access to Turkish territorial waters <b>to</b> <b>transit</b> to the Aegean Sea. A complaint to the Turkish government emphasised the Allies' interest in the Balkans and that they did not wish to see the Germans reinforcing the region.|$|E
40|$|Abstract โ The {{cross-correlation}} {{function is}} commonly used <b>to</b> measure the <b>transit</b> time between two similar signals. The maximum value of the cross-correlation function corresponds <b>to</b> the <b>transit</b> time. The other way to measure this is to add the two signals. This method is comparable with the well known interference measurement technique. In the spectrum of the added signals after filtering a cosine function can be determined. The frequency of this function is directly proportional <b>to</b> the <b>transit</b> time...|$|R

5|$|In {{company with}} six battleships and {{eighteen}} destroyers, Arizona was sent south again <b>to</b> <b>transit</b> the Panama Canal in January 1921. After meeting {{up with the}} Pacific Fleet, Arizona continued on to Peru for {{a week before the}} two fleets combined to practice battle maneuvers. After a short return to the Atlantic, which included an overhaul in New York, Arizona returned to Peru in the summer before she began operating from her new home port of San Pedro, California, part of Los Angeles, where she was based until 1940.|$|E
5|$|In mid-June 1941, the {{division}} received new orders to relocate. The 16th Panzer Division crossed the GermanโPolish border at Groร Wartenberg heading for Oลผarรณw at the Vistula, which was reached on 19 June 1941. The German soldiers initially {{believed that they}} were just going <b>to</b> <b>transit</b> through Russia, {{on their way to the}} Middle East where they would link up with Erwin Rommel's Afrika Corps. But Generalfeldmarschall (Field Marshal) Walther von Reichenau, who visited his son, a Leutnant in the 4th company of Panzer-Regiment 2, revealed to them the true objective of the next campaign. It would be Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|The NTSB {{recommended}} that the FAA revise the procedures for ATC facilities {{in the area to}} facilitate the process for VFR traffic that wishes <b>to</b> <b>transit</b> Class B airspace. This included establishing procedures to coordinate such requests between facilities; requiring controllers to instruct pilots to self-announce on the VFR corridor frequency if they are unable to immediately enter Class B airspace; adding information to area Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS) broadcasts reminding pilots to use the self-announce frequency; and ensuring that pilots are provided with traffic advisories if they are in contact with a controller.|$|E
