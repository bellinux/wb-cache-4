25|$|In short while, pilgrimages to Căldărușani {{became the}} object of derision: in one instance, a group of {{eccentric}} high school students passing themselves off as the press made a noisy descent on the monastery, dined at the monks' expense, and even arranged an interview with Ghenadie. The prank was organized by friends Urmuz, the future writer, and by George Ciprian, later a comedian and playwright. As Ciprian recalled in the 1950s, Ghenadie was not upset when uncovering their subterfuge, and spoke <b>to</b> <b>them</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> injustices of his dismissal.|$|E
25|$|The {{events of}} Tet in early 1968 {{as a whole}} were also {{remarkable}} in shifting public opinion regarding the war. U.S. military officials had previously reported that counter-insurgency in South Vietnam was being prosecuted successfully. While the Tet Offensive provided the U.S. and allied militaries with a great victory in that the Vietcong was finally brought into open battle and destroyed as a fighting force, the American media, including respected figures such as Walter Cronkite, interpreted such events as {{the attack on the}} American embassy in Saigon as an indicator of U.S. military weakness. The military victories on the battlefields of Tet were obscured by shocking images of violence on television screens, long casualty lists, and a new perception among the American people that the military had been untruthful <b>to</b> <b>them</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> success of earlier military operations, and ultimately, the ability to achieve a meaningful military solution in Vietnam.|$|E

The Chicago Tribune published an article claiming that Curly had made statements <b>to</b> <b>them</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> battle. John F.

2500|$|Beauford Delaney {{was born}} December 30, 1901 in Knoxville, Tennessee, United States of America. Delaney's parents were {{prominent}} and respected members of Knoxville's black community. His father Samuel {{was both a}} barber and a Methodist minister. His mother Delia was also prominent in the church, and earned a living taking in laundry and cleaning the houses of prosperous local whites. Delia, born into slavery and never able {{to read and write}} herself, transferred a sense of dignity and self-esteem to her children, and preached <b>to</b> <b>them</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> injustices of racism and the value of education. Beauford was the eighth of ten children, only four of whom survived into adulthood. He summed up the reasons for this in a journal entry from 1961, saying [...] "so much sickness came from improper places to live – long distances to walk to schools improperly heated… too much work at home – natural conditions common to the poor that take the bright flowers like terrible cold in nature…" ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{convince}} Tallstar and Firestar to join his alliance, Tigerstar reveals <b>to</b> <b>them</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> BloodClan, a vicious group of rogues that lives in the alleys of a nearby twolegplace (human town). When both leaders still refuse, Tigerstar then orders BloodClan to fight for him, {{but they do not}} do so, as they only listen to the commands of their leader, Scourge. Scourge tells Tigerstar that he is the only cat in charge of BloodClan, and after Firestar tells everyone Tigerstar's bloodthirsty history and that he cannot be trusted to divide power, Scourge decides {{that there will be no}} battle. Tigerstar attacks Scourge, but Scrouge then kills him easily with his claws, which are reinforced with dead cats' and dogs' claws, ending all nine of Tigerstar's lives with one blow, by cutting him open from chin to tail. Scourge then gives all of the forest Clans three days to leave; otherwise, they will have to fight BloodClan for the forest. To face this danger, the four Clans unite, forming an alliance which is known as [...] "LionClan". During the battle, Whitestorm is killed by Bone, the BloodClan deputy, but Bone is killed soon afterwards when a group of apprentices avenge Whitestorm's death. The apprentices were Featherpaw, Stormpaw, Tawnypaw, and Bramblepaw. The battle is won when Firestar kills Scourge, though he loses one of his own nine lives in the process. Without its leader, BloodClan scatters. With the forest returned to normal, the four Clans become independent once more.|$|E
2500|$|The United States Senate finally {{ratified}} the Treaty of Payne's Landing in April 1834. The treaty {{had given the}} Seminoles three years to move west of the Mississippi. The government interpreted the three years as starting 1832, and expected the Seminoles to move in 1835. Fort King was reopened in 1834. A new Seminole agent, Wiley Thompson, had been appointed in 1834, and the task of persuading the Seminoles to move fell to him. He called the chiefs together at Fort King in October 1834 to talk <b>to</b> <b>them</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> removal to the west. The Seminoles informed Thompson {{that they had no}} intention of moving, and that they did not feel bound by the Treaty of Payne's Landing. Thompson requested reinforcements for Fort King and Fort Brooke, reporting that, [...] "the Indians after they had received the Annuity, purchased an unusually large quantity of Powder & Lead." [...] General Clinch also warned Washington that the Seminoles did not intend to move, and that more troops would be needed to force them to move. In March 1835 Thompson called the chiefs together to read a letter from President Andrew Jackson to them. In his letter, Jackson said, [...] "Should you ... refuse to move, I have then directed the Commanding officer to remove you by force." [...] The chiefs asked for thirty days to respond. A month later the Seminole chiefs told Thompson that they would not move west. Thompson and the chiefs began arguing, and General Clinch had to intervene to prevent bloodshed. Eventually, eight of the chiefs agreed to move west, but asked to delay the move {{until the end of the}} year, and Thompson and Clinch agreed.|$|E
