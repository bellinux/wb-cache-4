50|$|Karl Fischer {{titration}} is {{a classic}} titration method in analytical chemistry that uses coulometric or volumetric titration to determine trace amounts of water in a sample.

50|$|Titration, {{also known}} as titrimetry, is a common {{laboratory}} method of quantitative chemical analysis {{that is used to}} determine the unknown concentration of an identified analyte. Since volume measurements {{play a key role in}} titration, it is {{also known as}} volumetric analysis. A reagent, called the titrant or <b>titrator</b> is prepared as a standard solution. A known concentration and volume of titrant reacts with a solution of analyte or titrand to determine concentration. The volume of titrant reacted is called titration volume.|$|E
5000|$|Difficulty {{was found}} by other workers in repeating Belzer's {{successful}} 72-hour perfusion storage experiments. Woods [...] was able to achieve successful 48-hour storage of 3 out of 6 kidneys when he used the Belzer additives with cryoprecipitated plasma as the perfusate in a hypothermic perfusion system, but {{he was unable to}} extend the storage time to 72 hours as Belzer had done. However, Woods [...] later achieved successful 3 and 7 days storage of dog kidneys. Woods had modified Belzer's perfusate by the addition of 250 mg of methyl prednisolone, increased the magnesium sulphate content to 16.2 mEq and the insulin to 320 units. Six of 6 kidneys produced life sustaining function when they were reimplanted after 72 hours storage despite immediate contralateral nephrectomies; 1 of 2 kidneys produced life sustaining function after 96 hours storage, 1 of 2 after 120 hours storage, and 1 of 2 after 168 hours storage. Perfusate pressure was 60 mm Hg with a perfusate pump rate of 70 beats per minute, and perfusate pH was automatically maintained at 7.4 by a C02 <b>titrator.</b> Woods stressed the importance of hydration of the donor and recipient animals. Without the methyl prednisolone, Woods found vessel fragility to be a problem when storage times were longer than 48 hours.|$|E
40|$|Background: While {{important}} for substance use outcomes, knowledge about treatment attendance patterns, and their relation with clinical outcomes is limited. We examined {{the association between}} attendance patterns and smoking outcomes in a randomized, controlled smoking cessation intervention trial. Methods: In addition to standard smoking cessation treatment, participants were randomized to 15 weeks of an exercise intervention (n = 72) or an education control condition (n = 64). Latent class growth analysis (LCGA) tested whether intervention attendance would be better modeled as qualitatively distinct attendance patterns {{rather than as a}} single mean pattern. Multivariate generalized linear mixed modeling (GLMM) was used to evaluate associations between the attendance patterns and abstinence at the end of treatment and at 6 -month follow-up. Results: The LCGA solution with three patterns characterized by high probability of attendance throughout (Completers, 46. 3 %), gradual decreasing probability of attendance (<b>Titrators,</b> 23. 5 %), and high probability of dropout within the first few weeks (Droppers, 30. 1 %) provided the best fit. The GLMM analysis indicated an interaction of attendance pattern by treatment condition, such that titration was associated with lower probability of quit success for those in the control condition. Probability of quit success was not significantly different between <b>Titrators</b> and Completers in the exercise condition. Conclusions: These findings underscore the importance of examining how treatment efficacy may vary as a function of attendance patterns. Importantly, treatment discontinuation is not necessarily indicative of poorer abstinence outcome...|$|R
50|$|Many {{autosamplers}} {{for liquids}} {{consist of a}} carousel and the sampling apparatus. The carousel holds the samples, and revolves around its center so that samples change their horizontal position. There may be several concentric rings holding samples in a carousel. The sampling apparatus can be fixed horizontally, only {{moving up and down}} to allow the carousel to move, or it can also move horizontally, depending on the design of the system. The sampling apparatus in most of such autosamplers consist of a needle connected to a remote pumping syringe via tubing. Similar designs have been employed for <b>titrators,</b> which do not have a sampling apparatus, but a titration apparatus.|$|R
40|$|In this {{research}} project {{we plan to}} determine the rate of oxidation of pyrite associated with coaly particles (coal slurry solid) when the pH of the surrounding environment is held at approximately 7. 8. Coaly particles that contain pyrite are generated during the preparation of Illinois Basin coal for market. These particles are discharged to an impoundment, which eventually must be reclaimed. The purpose for reclamation is either to prevent the generation of acidic solution as the pyrite in the coal slurry solid reacts with air, or to prevent the migration of the acidic solution to a groundwater aquifer. The reclamation is usually accomplished by covering the impoundment with a four-foot-thick layer of topsoil. One possible alternative method for reclamation of a coal slurry impoundment is to mix in alkaline residue from the fluidized-bed combustion of coal. This codisposal would slow the production of acid and would also neutralize any acid produced. If the codisposal method {{is found to be}} environmentally acceptable, it will save the coal mining companies part of their cost of reclamation, and also provide a safe and useful disposal outlet for a portion of the residue that is generated by the fluidized-bed combustion of coal. During this quarter we purchased and set up two automatic <b>titrators,</b> which will be used in determining the rate of pyrite oxidation at nearly neutral pH. The <b>titrators</b> will provide a means for maintaining the pH at the desired level. The rate at which sulfate ion is produced as a result of pyrite oxidation will be used to measure the amount of pyrite oxidized over time...|$|R

40|$|The {{combination}} of glass vial, elastomeric stopper, and aluminum crimp seal {{represents one of}} the principal packaging systems used to package diagnostic reagents, ophthalmic and veterinary medicines, and pharmaceutical products. This work states that elastomeric flat liners are an alternative to traditional stoppers. To confirm this position, several comparative moisture transmission evaluations are conducted to contrast the barrier performance of glued flat liners against stoppers in continuous thread closures on glass vials. After a review of several standard packaging integrity testing methods, this thesis demonstrates the use of coulometric titration as an alternative package system testing methodology. Coulometric <b>titrators</b> are commercially available, and coulometric titration is well established as a precise moisture determination method for determining the micro-moisture contents in both solid and liquid products. The accuracy of coulometric titration technique is well suited for discerning the slight changes in moisture content of hygroscopic products after being packaged in candidate high moisture barrier packaging systems...|$|R
40|$|The pH-stat {{titration}} {{technique is}} an autonomous and very {{powerful tool for}} performing and monitoring chelatometric titrations of metal cations with great accuracy, poorly known, however, and seldom exploited. Based on measurement {{of the amount of}} strong base required to keep the pH of the test solution at a selected value during stepwise known additions of ethylenedinitrilotetraacetate (EDTA), it requires a glass electrode as the only sensor and is easily implemented on potentiometric <b>titrators.</b> It was introduced a quarter of century ago on an empirical basis for a very peculiar purpose (determination of calcium in diary products), but only very recently it was generalised and its fundamentals were thoroughly examined. In this work, pH-static titrations of some transition metal cations of analytical relevance (Co 2 (+), Cu 2 +, Mn 2 +, Zn 2 +) were thoroughly investigated in the acid pH range between 2. 3 and 5 or 7 (the highest pH depending on the metal hydroxide or carbonate solubility). The results at higher acidity showed unsuspected properties of such chelation reactions. At moderately acid pH (generally >= 4), indeed, pH-static titrations yield results of high precision and accuracy. On decreasing pH, however, the reaction stoichiomety deviates more and more from the 1 : 1 ratio between chelating agent and cation, seemingly because of formation of binuclear complexes, an occurrence very seldom mentioned in the current literature. The optimal titration conditions for each metal are defined, and directions for establishing a laboratory protocol for quantitative determinations are given. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.

40|$|With {{the advent}} of high-precision {{automatic}} <b>titrators</b> operating in pH stat mode, measuring the mass balance of protons in solid-solution mixtures against the pH of natural and synthetic polyelectrolytes is now routine. However, titration curves of complex molecules typically lack obvious inflection points, which complicates their analysis despite the high-precision measurements. The calculation of site densities and median proton affinity constants (pK) from such data can lead to considerable covariance between fit parameters. Knowing the number of independent parameters that can be freely varied during the least-squares minimization of a model fit to titration data is necessary to improve the model's applicability. This number was calculated for natural organic matter by applying principal component analysis (PCA) to a reference data set of 47 independent titration curves from fulvic and humic acids measured at I= 0. 1 M. The complete data set was reconstructed statistically from pH 3. 5 to 9. 8 with only six parameters, compared to seven or eight generally adjusted with common semi-empirical speciation models for organic matter, and explains correlations that occur with the higher number of parameters. Existing proton-binding models are not necessarily overparametrized, but instead titration data lack the sensitivity needed to quantify the full set of binding properties of humic materials. Modelindependent conditional pKvalues can be obtained directly from the derivative of titration data, and this approach is the most conservative. The apparent proton-binding constants of the 23 fulvic acids (FA) and 24 humic acids (HA) derived from a high-quality polynomial parametrization of the data set are pKH,COOH(FA) = 4. 18 (0. 21, pKH,Ph-OH(FA) = 9. 29 (0. 33, pKH,COOH(HA) = 4. 49 (0. 18, and pKH,Ph-OH(HA) = 9. 29 (0. 38.

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} evaluate potential diet segregation in feed lines by measuring coefficient of variation (CV) and mean salt concentration. The facility was a 1500 -head gestation barn with nine feed lines, transected by a central feed line that conveyed feed from one of two bulk bins. Quantab® chloride <b>titrators</b> were {{used to analyze the}} chloride concentration (salt) from samples collected at pre-determined feed line locations at various distances from the bulk bins. Thirty samples were collected from three feed lines (row 1, 5, and 9), ten samples were collected from drop boxes close to the central feed line (location 1), ten samples were collected from a central location within the row (location 2), and ten samples were collected from the furthest end of the feed line (location 3). Samples of approximately 50 g were collected directly from the feed drop. The sample collection procedure was repeated four times. After the first two sample collections, a bin agitator was added to the bulk bin. There was a feed line × distance (within the feed line) × agitator interaction (P > 0. 02) observed for CV. The addition of the bin agitator improved the CV in feed line 1 and 5, with no improvement observed in feed line 9. The CV observed before the addition of the agitator averaged 17. 6, 18. 6, and 14. 3 % for feed lines 1, 5, and 9, respectively, and the CV observed after the addition of the agitator averaged 13. 6, 16, and 14 % for feed line 1, 5, and 9 respectively. Within all feed lines (rows), distance CV was higher at locations 1 (17. 3 %) and 3 (17. 6 %), compared with CV at location 2 (15. 6 %) before the addition of the agitator, but was lower at locations 1 (14. 3 %) and 3 (13. 0 %), compared with CV at location 2 (15. 6 %) after the addition of the agitator. There was a mean-salt concentration effect (P< 0. 0001) observed for feed line.

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} evaluate the effects of using salt with different particle sizes and of using different samplepreparation methods on mixer-efficiency testing (time required to achieve a coefficient of variation (CV) of 10 % or less among 10 feed samples). A 3000 -lb capacity horizontal ribbon mixer was used to mix batches of feed. Ten samples were collected at eight times during mixing (0. 0, 0. 5, 1. 0, 2. 0, 3. 5, 5. 5, 8. 0, and 10. 5 min) after all ingredients were added from pre-determined locations in the mixer. Coefficient of variation {{was used to measure}} mixer efficiency by analysis for chloride concentration in each sample with Quantab® chloride <b>titrators.</b> In Exp. 1, four 3000 -lb batches of feed were prepared, two with 440 - micron salt and two with 730 -micron salt. Samples were analyzed as collected (unground; approximately 700 microns) or were ground with a coffee grinder (ground; approximately 400 microns). A salt particle size × sample preparation × mixing time interaction (P< 0. 001) was observed, but a CV of 10 % or less was never achieved, indicating inadequate mixing. In Exp. 2, all samples were collected from 2000 -lb batches of feed made in the 3000 -lb-capacity mixer. Four different salt particle sizes (440, 730, 1999, and 3000 micron) were used, and each set of samples collected was also analyzed as unground or ground. A salt particle size × sample preparation × mixing time interaction (P< 0. 04) was observed. As salt particle size decreased and mixing time increased, there was a decrease in CV. Grinding samples before analysis decreased CV, compared with that of the unground samples, but to a greater extent with coarse salt than with fine salt. The batch mixed with 440 -micron salt and the batch mixed with 730 -micron salt (ground) reached a CV of less than 10 %, indicating a uniform mixture. No other treatments reached a CV of 10 % or less. When the mixer was filled to the rated capacity we were unable to achieve an acceptable CV for mixer efficiency; therefore, it is important to test mixers at various fill levels. Our study also showed {{that it is important to}} use a fine mixing salt when testing mixers for mixer efficiency...|$|R
