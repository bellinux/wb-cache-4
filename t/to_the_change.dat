5|$|A race riot {{broke out}} in May 1943 of whites against blacks.

That year ADDSCO promoted 12 blacks to positions as welders, previously reserved for whites; and whites objected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>change</b> by rioting on May 24. The mayor appealed to the governor to call in the National Guard to restore order, but it was weeks before officials allowed African Americans to return to work, keeping them away for their safety.|$|E

5|$|Due to its sharp {{turns with}} {{restricted}} headroom, high-sided vehicles can only use the left-hand lane {{of the western}} tunnel, {{so it was not}} possible to reverse the tidal flow in the evening. On 20 April 2007 the morning tidal flow was discontinued, after reports by TfL and the Metropolitan Police (MPS) of an increase in dangerous motoring behaviour; these blamed poor driving, such as overtaking, for the decrease in safety during counterflow operations. The decision to end the counterflow was controversial, particularly as TfL and the MPS had been considering it since 2005, without properly informing affected borough councils, and an independent committee was set up to evaluate the decision. The ending of the counterflow system has brought protests from users of the tunnel and those experiencing increased congestion due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>change.</b>|$|E

5|$|From 1930 to , the River Road {{section of}} NY251 {{overlapped}} with NY35, which initially entered Monroe County {{on the former}} routing of legislative Route15 and continued north to Rochester on current NY383. The southwestern end of NY35 was moved to Mumford , shifting {{the location of the}} overlap to Main Street in Scottsville. The concurrency was replaced with one with NY383 when it supplanted most of NY35 in the early 1940s. On July 1, 1977, NY251 was truncated to begin at the eastern end of its overlap with NY383 in Scottsville. The former routing of NY251 from the west end of the concurrency in Scottsville to Gates became an extension of NY386, which was a simple connector in northern Gates and southern Greece prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>change.</b>|$|E
5|$|Many of the {{features}} found in sauropods that basal sauropodomorphs lack are related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>change</b> in body size. The greatest regions affected by this are the hind limbs and pelvis. For example, an elongating of the ilium, size reduction of the lesser trochanter shelf, and semiplantigrade posture are some features that indicate the amount and positioning of leg muscles being modified. Vulcanodon possessed these features, the latter of which is seen earliest in it. However, Vulcanodon does not have reduced distal phalanges, which are seen in Shunosaurus and all more derived sauropods. This means that while the muscle positioning of its legs were changing, they had not yet reduced in the distal region of the limb.|$|E

5|$|Mk. III {{went into}} {{extensive}} testing at No. 25 Sqn in May 1940 and another troubling problem was found. As the target aircraft {{moved to the}} sides of the fighter, the error in the horizontal angle grew. Eventually, at about 60 degrees to the side, the target was indicated as being {{on the other side of}} the fighter. Hanbury Brown concluded that the problem was due to reflections between the fuselage and engine nacelles, due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>change</b> to the long-nose IVF from the short-nose IF and IIF. In previous examples they had used the fuselage of the aircraft as the reflector, positioning and angling the antennas to run along the nose or wing leading edges.|$|E
5|$|Sherman {{spent two}} months in the {{territory}} and was the primary author of the 1,188-page report filed on conditions there when they returned in April 1856. The report explained what anti-administration members already feared: that the principle of local control was being seriously undermined by the invasion of Missourians who, while not intending to settle there, used violence to coerce the Kansans to elect pro-slavery members to the territorial legislature. The House took no action on the reports, but they were widely distributed as campaign documents. That July, Sherman proposed an amendment to an army appropriation act to bar use of federal troops to enforce the acts of the Kansas territorial legislature, which many now viewed as an illegitimate body. The amendment narrowly passed the House, but was removed by the Senate; the House ultimately agreed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>change.</b> In spite of this defeat, however, Sherman had achieved considerable prominence for a freshman representative.|$|E

5|$|The {{bill had}} a more {{difficult}} time in the Senate. The National Association of Manufacturers, Chamber of Commerce, and industrialist Henry Ford all opposed its passage. Senator Bennett Champ Clark introduced an amendment to emasculate Section 7(a), but Wagner and Senator George W. Norris led the successful opposition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>change.</b> The bulk of the Senate debate, however, turned on the bill's suspension of antitrust law. Senators William E. Borah, Burton K. Wheeler, and Hugo Black opposed any relaxation of the Sherman Antitrust Act, arguing that this would exacerbate existing severe economic inequality and concentrate wealth {{in the hands of}} the rich (a severe problem which many economists at the time believed was one of the causes of the Great Depression). Wagner defended the bill, arguing that the bill's promotion of codes of fair trade practices would help create progressive standards for wages, hours, and working conditions, and eliminate sweatshops and child labor. The Senate passed the amended legislation 57-to-24 on June 9.|$|E
5|$|The {{contract}} was signed on June 15, 1866 and the expropriation {{of the first}} 1,100 houses was completed in a few months. The work began on February 13, 1867.

The embezzlement scandal also caused a significant delay in construction, largely due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>change</b> in control.

5|$|Carey's debut studio album made {{a strong}} impact on pop music, but the singer became {{interested}} in altering her sound and branching out into other genres for her second studio effort, Emotions (1991). Columbia allowed her to take more control over her musical direction, enabling her to change the musical genre, melodies, and production style. Carey worked with many new musicians and producers on the album; Walter Afanasieff being the only holdover from her debut. Emotions contained influences from 1950s, 60s, and 70s balladry, gospel, R and soul music. The album, while praised by some as being more mature and raw, failed to reach the critical or commercial heights of her debut effort; selling fewer units and failing to introduce Carey into new markets. Columbia decided to return Carey to the same genre as her debut album and have her produce a more commercial and radio-friendly record. Their plans were to tone down Carey's vocals and soften the album's production to create a contemporary pop record. Carey and Afanasieff agreed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>change</b> and began writing and recording material for her third studio effort, Music Box (1993).|$|E
5|$|In January 1978, a WMATA {{regional}} {{task force}} approved a Green Line route in Anacostia that followed Martin Luther King, Jr., Avenue and then Wheeler Road down to the Beltway (with a new station added near St. Elizabeths Hospital).

WMATA announced in November 1978 that it had secured funding to build the Green Line from Gallery Place to Waterfront and that construction was nearly complete on this portion of the line, but that funding did not exist to push the line from Waterfront to Anacostia. Nonetheless, Metro reiterated that it intended to complete the extension to Anacostia Station by late 1983.|$|E
5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 3 January, Berryman met with Allen, Jerram and Frowen at Allen's headquarters at Post 40 to discuss plans for the next day. It was agreed that Allen would advance on Bardia and cut the fortress in two, supported by Frowen's guns, every available tank, MacArthur-Onslow's Bren gun carriers and the 2/8th Infantry Battalion, which Mackay had recently allocated from reserve. Allen gave orders accordingly. During {{the afternoon}} the 6th Cavalry Regiment was pulled back to become the brigade reserve and the 2/5th Infantry Battalion relieved the 2/2nd to free it to advance the next day. That evening, Berryman {{came to the conclusion}} that unless the Italian defence collapsed soon, the 16th and 17th Infantry Brigades would become incapable of further effort and Brigadier Horace Robertson's 19th Infantry Brigade would be required. Mackay was more sanguine about the situation, and reminded Berryman that his orders had been to capture Bardia with only two brigades. While they were discussing the matter, O'Connor and Harding arrived at 6th Division headquarters, and O'Connor readily agreed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>change</b> of plan.|$|E
