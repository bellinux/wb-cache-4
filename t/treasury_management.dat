2500|$|Its {{wholesale}} banking segment contains products sold to large- and middle-market commercial companies, {{as well as}} to consumers on a wholesale basis. This includes lending, <b>treasury</b> <b>management,</b> mutual funds, asset-based lending, commercial real estate, corporate and institutional trust services, and capital markets and investment banking services through Wells Fargo Securities. One area that is very profitable to Wells Fargo, however, is asset-based lending: lending to large companies using accounts receivable and inventory as collateral, though less traditional assets are often included in the collateral package. Historically, this type of lending has been done when normal routes of raising funds, such as the Capital Markets or unsecured bank loans, have been exhausted. The main business unit associated with this activity is Wells Fargo Capital Finance. Wells Fargo also owns Eastdil Secured, which is described as a [...] "real estate investment bank", but is essentially one of the largest commercial real estate brokers for very large transactions (such as the purchase and sale of large Class-A office buildings in central business districts throughout the United States).|$|E
50|$|Most {{banks have}} whole {{departments}} devoted to <b>treasury</b> <b>management</b> and supporting their clients' needs in this area. Until recently, large banks had the stronghold on {{the provision of}} <b>treasury</b> <b>management</b> products and services. However, smaller banks are increasingly launching and/or expanding their <b>treasury</b> <b>management</b> functions and offerings, because of the market opportunity afforded by the recent economic environment (with banks of all sizes focusing on the clients they serve best), availability of (recently displaced) highly seasoned <b>treasury</b> <b>management</b> professionals, access to industry standard, third-party technology providers' products and services tiered according {{to the needs of}} smaller clients, and investment in education and other best practices. A number of independent <b>treasury</b> <b>management</b> systems (TMS) are available, allowing enterprises to conduct <b>treasury</b> <b>management</b> internally. For non-banking entities, the terms <b>Treasury</b> <b>Management</b> and Cash Management are sometimes used interchangeably, while, in fact, the scope of <b>treasury</b> <b>management</b> is larger (and includes funding and investment activities mentioned above). In general, a company's treasury operations comes {{under the control of the}} CFO, Vice-President / Director of Finance or Treasurer, and is handled on a day-to-day basis by the organization's treasury staff, controller, or comptroller.|$|E
