40|$|When {{evaluating}} alternative {{designs of}} subscriber terminals {{that have been}} proposed for <b>two-way</b> <b>cable</b> television (CATV) systems we need to use {{political as well as}} economic criteria. The political objective a two-way communication system should serve is making government more responsive to feedback from citizens. At the national and state level this means better education about public issues and more effective exchange of information between citizens and their representatives. At the community level this means helping the discussion of public issues, aiding community decision-making, and connecting members of the community with their officials. At the group level this means helping improve decision-making and helping new groups to form and express new interests. Subscriber terminals that have been proposed for CATV systems vary widely, from a simple four-button pad to a full keyboard and printer with display screen and microphone.

40|$|A video {{distribution}} architecture with edge {{stations and}} Wi-Fi delivery networks as connection to residential homes {{is described in}} this paper. An edge station is configurable and controllable by a central server. It {{is placed in the}} access point of Wi-Fi networks and has multiple usages.

Replicating popular video con-tents in many small mirroring sites can significantly reduce the network bandwidth requirement. When this structure is used with a cable or Hybrid Fiber/Coax (HFC) network, it turns to be a Hybrid Fiber/Coax/Wi-Fi (HFCW) structure, particularly suitable for Video-on-Demand (VoD) applica-tions. There are many advantages of this architecture. First, the central server load and network traffic can be reduced to a small percentage. Second, the response time of most video playing requests can be significantly reduced. Third, true VoD can possibly be provided with a one-way cable system.

40|$|Today, {{cable system}} {{operators}} {{have to deal}} with bidirectional traffic from sources such as pay-per-view television, high-speed Internet access, and two-way telephony. A cable testing system is described that can handle bidirectional traffic even with RF noise (ingress) on the return path. The deregulation of the telecommunications industry has resulted in an unprecedented surge of effort to implement new telecommunications services.

40|$|The optimal {{structuring}} of menu indexes in computerized {{information retrieval}} is examined. The number of alternatives per page that minimizes search time is determined {{as a function}} of the human and machine factors of search strategy, scanning time, key-press time, and computer response time. For a wide range of conditions, the optimal number of alternatives per page is in the range of from four to eight, with limiting integer values of three and four for exhaustive and self-terminating search, respectively. The spread of computers in recent years has been stimulated in part by an increased demand for information-retrieval services. A case in point is the recent development of vid-eotex systems (Pres tel in Britain, Antiope in France, and Telidon in Canada). Videotex is an interactive system designed to present tex-tual and graphic information at the com-mand of the user (Madden, 1979; Tydeman, Lipinski, Adler, Nyhan, and Zwimpfer, 1982).

This paper presents a hw/sw co-verification methodology based on TWCNP-OS, a Linux-based operating system designed for FPGA-based platform of <b>two-way</b> <b>cable</b> network (TWCNP) SOC. By implementing HAL (hardware Abstraction level) specially, which is the communications interface between hardware and software, we offer a homogeneous Linux interface for both software and hardware processes. Hardware processes inherit {{the same level of}} service from kernel, as typical Linux software processes by HAL. The familiar and language independent Linux kernel interface facilitates easy design reuse and rapid application development. The hw/sw Architecture of TWCNP and design flow of TWCNP-OS are presented on detail. A software and hardware co-verification method using TWCNP-OS is proposed, through the integrated using of Godson-I test board and TWCNP, which realizes the combination of design and verification. It is not a replacement of the co-verification with generic RTOS modeling, but is complementary to them. Performance analysis of our current implementation and our experience with developing this system based on TWCNP-OS will be presented. Most importantly, since the introduction of TWCNP-OS to our FPGA-based platform, we have observed increased productivity among high-level application developers who have little experience in FPGA application design...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1985 Two-way {{transmission}} of data on broadband community cable television systems is considered in this thesis. A discussion of the data transmission environment is presented which attempts to characterize the channel noise and interference which degrades data transmission performance. The analysis considers channel degradation resulting from additive gaussian noise and various amplitudes and frequencies of sinewave interference which simulate the noise and interference environment {{likely to be found}} on cable systems. To assess the impact of the channel noise and interference, noncoherent binary frequency shift keying (FSK) using frequency discriminator detection was chosen as the basis for a theoretical and experimental investigation. To simplify the analysis, a linear model of frequency discriminator detection is presented which provides useful results in situations where the signal-to-noise ratio is high. The model was tested against laboratory experiments using an idealized FSK data transmission channel with controlled amounts of noise and interference. A comparison of theoretical and experimental results show reasonably good agreement, thus validating the model for certain noise and interference circumstances which are applicable to data transmission on <b>two-way</b> <b>cable</b> television systems. The results show that with an FSK carrier-to-sinewave interference ratio of 6 dB, an increase in carrier-to-noise ratio of approximately 5 dB is required to achieve the same 1 X 10 ⁻⁹ error rate. The usefulness of the study results for predicting FSK data transmission performance can be improved by incorporating empirical statistical data on interference ingress in the return path of the cable system...|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is on those {{elements}} of the Internet periphery and Internet service provision which are strongly based on telecommunications, in particular Internet access and Internet backbone. Access to the Internet requires a connection between the Internet user and the interface to the Internet service provider (ISP). Several access technologies exist: copper, fiber optics, <b>two-way</b> <b>cable</b> TV infrastructure (CATV network), powerline communication and radio in the loop. One may differentiate between narrowband and broadband Internet access. From a rather short run perspective the local loops of the established carriers are still - at least to some extent - monopolistic bottlenecks, with a consequent need for sector specific regulations (price cap, accounting separation, discriminatory free entry). However, neither from the (short run) perspective of narrowband Internet access nor from the (longer run) perspective of broadband Internet access does the recent introduction of line sharing regulation by the FCC as well as the European Parliament seem to be justified. Transit and peering arrangements among Internet backbone providers (IBPs) are not subject to sector-specific regulations. The agreements that cover interconnection between IBPs are characterized by private negotiations and are subject to non-disclosure rules. From the economic theory of regulation it follows that there is indeed no need for ex ante regulation due to the absence of network specific market power. The input market of communications bandwidth is competitive and each IBP can develop its own logistic concept to optimize its own backbone and set of transit and peering arrangements...|$|E
