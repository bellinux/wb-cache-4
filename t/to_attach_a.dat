5|$|Koalas were {{hunted for}} food by Aboriginals. A common {{technique}} used {{to capture the}} animals was <b>to</b> <b>attach</b> <b>a</b> loop of ropey bark {{to the end of}} a long, thin pole, so as to form a noose. This would be used to snare an animal high in a tree, beyond the reach of a climbing hunter; an animal brought down this way would then be killed with a stone hand axe or hunting stick (waddy). According to the customs of some tribes, it was considered taboo to skin the animal, while other tribes thought the animal's head had a special status, and saved them for burial.|$|E
5|$|For {{mourning}} activities, {{the flag}} can be flown {{in either of}} the following ways. The first method, commonly known as half-staffing, is performed when the flag is hoisted {{to the top of}} the flagpole, then lowered to the pole's one-third position. The other method is <b>to</b> <b>attach</b> <b>a</b> black ribbon to a flag that is permanently affixed to a staff. The ribbon itself is ten centimetres wide and it is attached to the mast so that the ends of the ribbon reach the bottom of the flag. During a funeral ceremony, the flag may be used to cover the coffins of government officials, soldiers, signatories of the Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania, and persons designated by an act of the President; these flags are later folded and presented to the next of kin before interment.|$|E
5|$|On June 13, 2016, {{during its}} E3 2016 press conference, Microsoft {{unveiled}} Xbox One S, {{a revision of}} the original Xbox One hardware with a streamlined form factor. Its new casing is 40% smaller than the original design, and supports vertical orientation with a stand. The capacitive power and eject keys were replaced by physical buttons, the side USB port and controller sync button were moved {{to the front of}} the console, and its power supply is integrated into the console's casing rather than sitting externally. Xbox One S requires a USB adapter <b>to</b> <b>attach</b> <b>a</b> Kinect sensor, as it no longer includes the proprietary port used on the original model. A free USB adapter was provided by Microsoft to Kinect owners who registered their ownership of Kinect and Xbox One S online, but this promotion ended in March 2017. Although Microsoft stated that it would eventually bundle the adapter with standalone Kinect units, it is instead sold separately.|$|E

5|$|Sabotage {{operations}} were ordered from Berlin {{in the late}} autumn of 1940, but actual work did not start until early 1941. The first {{operations were}} unsuccessful. A first attempt to smuggle a bomb into Gibraltar was aborted, as the timing device was faulty. In February {{there was a large}} explosion in the North Tunnel, and in April a bomb blew up near the airfield. In June 1941, however, the British intelligence foiled a new attempt, by a German agent, <b>to</b> <b>attach</b> <b>a</b> mine alongside an Allied cargo ship. Another attempt failed when Plazas placed a bomb inside an ammunition store but was not able to bring the explosive. It was not until 1942 that the operations begun to succeed. In January 1942, two Spanish agents manage to destroy two aircraft at the North Front landing strip.|$|E
5|$|Dividing the {{captured}} British sailors, Lejoille transferred half to Généreux and left half on Leander with a French prize crew under Louis Gabriel Deniéport. In direct contravention {{of the established}} conventions of war, both sets of prisoners were immediately ordered to effect repairs to the vessels. Only once both ships were ready for the journey to Corfu were the prisoners given bread and water, although the wounded were still denied medical attention. For ten days after the engagement the battered ships sailed northwards against the wind, Généreux forced <b>to</b> <b>attach</b> <b>a</b> tow to Leander to avoid leaving the prize behind. On 28 August, a sail appeared to the south. Panic broke out on Généreux, and Lejoille ordered the prisoners confined below and for preparations {{to be made to}} abandon Leander and make all speed for Corfu. The new arrival was in fact the 16-gun British sloop HMS Mutine under Lieutenant Thomas Bladen Capel, carrying the second copies of Nelson's despatches to Britain. Capel sighted the ships to the north, but assumed that they were Généreux and Guillaume Tell and so passed by displaying French colours. Lejoille was not fooled by the disguise but did not pursue the small vessel, continuing his passage to Corfu once Mutine had sailed out of sight.|$|E
5|$|When Davies {{presented}} his {{ideas for the}} U.S. Millionaire to ABC, the network's executives initially rejected them, so he resigned his position there and became an independent producer. Determined to bring his idea for the show to fruition, Davies decided that he was betting his whole career on Millionaires production, and the first move that he made was planning <b>to</b> <b>attach</b> <b>a</b> celebrity host to the show. Along with Philbin, {{a number of other}} popular television personalities were considered for hosting positions on the U.S. Millionaire during its development, including Peter Jennings, Bob Costas, Phil Donahue, and Montel Williams, but among those considered, it was Philbin who wanted the job the most, and when he saw an episode of the British Millionaire and was blown away by his content, Davies and his team ultimately settled on having him host the American show. When Davies approached ABC again after having hired Philbin, the network finally agreed to accept the U.S. Millionaire. With production now ready to begin, the team had only five months to finish developing the show and get it launched, with Davies demanding perfection in every element of Millionaires production.|$|E
5000|$|The drawbar {{system was}} {{virtually}} the exclusive method of attaching implements (other than direct {{attachment to the}} tractor) before Harry Ferguson developed the three-point hitch. Equipment <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> the three-point hitch can be raised or lowered hydraulically with a control lever. The equipment <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> the three-point hitch is usually completely supported by the tractor. Another way <b>to</b> <b>attach</b> <b>an</b> implement is via a quick hitch, which is <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> the three-point hitch. This enables <b>a</b> single person <b>to</b> <b>attach</b> <b>an</b> implement quicker and put the person in less danger when attaching the implement.|$|R

25|$|There {{are three}} toll booths along the Turnpike. , {{passenger}} cars pay $2 at each toll booth. Additionally, {{there is a}} toll booth at exit 48 (to US 19, North Beckley/Summersville), which charges $0.40 for automobiles. Rates for larger vehicles are higher. The southernmost toll booth is south of the split with I-64, so east/west basic traffic pays $4.

25|$|Messenger RNA {{produced}} from the LMNA gene undergoes alternative splicing and is translated into lamins A and C. Lamin A undergoes farnesylation <b>to</b> <b>attach</b> <b>a</b> membrane anchor to the protein. This {{version of the}} protein is {{also referred to as}} prelamin A. Farnesylated prelamin A is further processed into mature lamin A by a metalloproteinase removing the last 15 amino acids and its farnesylated cysteine. This allows lamin A to dissociate from the nuclear envelope membrane and fulfill nuclear functions. Mutations causing laminopathies interfere with these processes on different levels.|$|E
25|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1972, Thin Lizzy {{got their}} first major break in the UK by {{supporting}} Slade, then nearing the height of their commercial success. Inspired by Noddy Holder's top hat with mirrors, Lynott decided <b>to</b> <b>attach</b> <b>a</b> mirror to his bass, which he carried over to subsequent tours. On the opening night of the tour, an altercation broke out between Lynott and Slade's manager Chas Chandler, who chastised his lack of stage presence and interaction with the audience, and threatened to throw Lizzy off the tour unless things improved immediately. Lynott subsequently developed the onstage rapport and stage presence that would become familiar over {{the remainder of the}} decade.|$|E

25|$|The hunting {{behaviour}} of the Salticidae is confusingly varied {{compared to}} that of most spiders in other families. Salticids hunt diurnally as a rule, which is consistent with their highly developed visual system. When it detects potential prey, a jumping spider typically begins orienting itself by swivelling its cephalothorax to bring the anterior median eyes to bear. It then moves its abdomen into line with its cephalothorax. After that, it might spend some time inspecting the object of its attention and determining whether a camouflaged or doubtful item of prey is promising, before it starts to stalk slowly forward. When close enough, the spider pauses <b>to</b> <b>attach</b> <b>a</b> dragline, then springs onto the prey.|$|E
25|$|The weather worsened; several {{attempts}} <b>to</b> <b>attach</b> <b>a</b> tow-line to U-570 were unsuccessful. Believing the Germans were being obstructive, Burwell's captain, S.R.J. Woods ordered a machine gunner to fire warning shots, shots that accidentally hit and slightly wounded {{five of the}} German crew. With much difficulty, an officer and three sailors from Kingston Agate reached the submarine using a Carley float (a liferaft). After a quick search failed to find the U-boat's Enigma machine, they attached a tow line and carried out {{the transfer of the}} five wounded men and the submarine's officers to Kingston Agate. The remaining crew were taken on board HMCS Niagara, which by this time had come alongside U-570.|$|E
25|$|At 2 A.M. on Friday 31 August the Vickers Voyager {{had reached}} the scene and {{launched}} Pisces II with a polypropylene rope attached. However, the lifting rope broke free of the manipulator arm and the submersible {{had to return to}} the surface for repairs. An attempt made by Pisces V failed to find the crashed Pisces III and returned to the surface after it ran out of power. Relaunching Pisces V had more success and found the crew at 12:44 P.M. However, an attempt <b>to</b> <b>attach</b> <b>a</b> rope failed. Pisces V now remained with the stricken Pisces III. An attempt to send Pisces II down again had to be called off when it suffered a leak.|$|E

25|$|Molecular {{graphics}} {{has always}} pushed {{the limits of}} display technology, and has seen a number of cycles of integration and separation of compute-host and display. Early systems like Project MAC were bespoke and unique, but in the 1970s the MMS-X and similar systems used (relatively) low-cost terminals, such as the Tektronix 4014 series, often over dial-up lines to multi-user hosts. The devices could only display static pictures but were able to evangelize MG. In the late 1970s, {{it was possible for}} departments (such as crystallography) to afford their own hosts (e.g., PDP-11) and <b>to</b> <b>attach</b> <b>a</b> display (such as Evans & Sutherland's PS-1) directly to the bus. The display list was kept on the host, and interactivity was good since updates were rapidly reflected in the display—at the cost of reducing most machines to a single-user system.|$|E
25|$|A {{skid loader}} or {{skid steer loader}} is a small rigid frame, {{engine-powered}} machine with lift arms used <b>to</b> <b>attach</b> <b>a</b> wide variety of labor-saving tools or attachments. Though sometimes they are equipped with tracks, skid-steer loaders are typically four-wheel drive vehicles that can push material from one location to another, carry material in its bucket, or load material into a truck or trailer. Brothers Louis and Cyrill Keller co-invented the first skid-steer loader, which was based around a three-wheeled loader they developed in 1957 for a turkey farmer near Rothsay, Minnesota. In September 1958, they were hired by the Melroe brothers at Melroe Manufacturing Company in Gwinner, North Dakota, which was later to become Bobcat Company. Using the brothers' design, Melroe introduced the M60 Self-Propelled Loader and, in 1960, Louis added a rear drive axle, resulting in the M400 model, the world's first true skid-steer loader.|$|E
25|$|A {{charging}} grip {{is available}} for the Joy-Con, which provides a means <b>to</b> <b>attach</b> <b>a</b> USB-C cable for power. Alongside that, Nintendo released a charging strap that allows players to charge an individual Joy-Con via embedded AA batteries. Nintendo offers a Joy-Con Wheel, a small steering wheel-like unit that a Joy-Con can slot into, allowing it {{to be used for}} racing games like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. The Switch supports the wireless Pro Controller, which has a more traditional design reminiscent of the Wii Classic Controller Pro and Wii U Pro Controller. As of Switch System Software 3.0.0 a setting can be turned on to use the controller in wired USB mode, however currently this will disable the NFC touchpoint. Standalone Docks are available, which include the power adapter and HDMI cable. Third parties also support the Switch with additional accessories, such as carrying cases and screen protectors. The 4.0.0 system update enabled support for GameCube controllers attached via USB with the Wii U GameCube adapter.|$|E
