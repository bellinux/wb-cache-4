Although it is rare for the metropolis to get rainfall in <b>this</b> <b>month,</b> <b>in</b> recent times, April 2013 was quite exceptional as the metropolis was blessed by heavy rain on three occasions: On 2 April 2013, a thunder storm gave heavy rain in northern {{parts of the city}} where 12.6mm rain was recorded. On 8 April 2013, a strong western depression from the Persian Gulf affected the city, giving widespread heavy rainfall in the morning hours, accompanied by strong winds; a maximum of 28mm rainfall was recorded.

Downtown (Saddar) observatory in south Karachi received an accumulation of 66mm for the month, however, the record for the highest rainfall in April stands unbroken because the record of 52.8mm in 1935 was set at the Airport observatory, while the total rainfall recorded at the Airport in April 2013 was 29mm. The April 2015 was very warm in Karachi, as it was 2.4°C warmer on average compared to a standard April.|$|E

60|$|On the whole, {{though he}} bore a serene aspect to the world, Coningsby passed <b>this</b> <b>month</b> <b>in</b> {{a state of}} restless misery.

Alone, in his solitary rooms in the Albany, he felt all his desolation; and often a few minutes before he figured in the world, apparently followed and courted by all, he had been plunged in the darkest fits of irremediable wretchedness.|$|E

60|$|After {{discussing}} {{all these}} points, {{the decision was}} as follows. It {{was at least a}} month too soon to think of trusting themselves in that stormy ocean, on the high seas and in the open boats; and this so much the more because nature, as if expressly to send back a reasonable amount of warm air into the polar regions, with a view to preserve the distinction of the seasons, caused the wind to blow most of the time from the northward. As <b>this</b> <b>month,</b> <b>in</b> all prudence, must be passed on the island, {{it might as well be}} occupied with building upon the hulk, as in any other occupation. Should the cold weather return, the materials would still be there, and might be burned, in the last extremity, just as well, or even with greater facility, after being brought over to the cove, as if left where they then were, or at the wreck. Should the winter not return, the work done on the vessel would be so much gained, and they would be ready for an earlier start, when the ice should move.|$|E
60|$|I ought {{long ago}} to have thanked {{you for your}} very {{substantial}} present of Carlyle--but I waited {{in the first place}} till I should have read the book (which business was considerably delayed,) and then till I had wound up a variety of little matters, mainly matters of writing which pressed upon me in anticipation of my leaving England for two or three months. Now when at last I seize the moment, I have left England, but you will be as glad of a letter from here as from out of the dense grey medium in which we had been living for a month before I quitted London. I came hither straight from Dover last night through the hideous but convenient hole in the dear old St. Gotthard, and I have been strolling about Milan all the morning, drinking in the delicious Italian sun, which fortunately shines, and giving myself up to the sweet sense of living once more--after an interval of several years--in the adorable country it illumines. It is Sunday and all the world is in the streets and squares, and the Italian type greets me in all its handsomeness and friendliness, and also, I fear I must add, not a little in its vulgarity. But its vulgarity is the exaggeration of a merit and not, as in England and the U.S., of a defect. Churches and galleries have such a fatal chill that being sore-throatish and neuralgic I have had to keep out of them, but the Duomo lifts all its pinnacles and statues into the far away light, and looks across at the other white needles and spires of the Alps in the same bewildering cluster. I go to spend the remainder of <b>this</b> <b>month</b> <b>in</b> Florence and afterwards to--I hope--take a month between Rome, Naples and Venice--but it will be as it will turn out. Once I am in Italy it is about the same to me to be in one place as in another.|$|E
