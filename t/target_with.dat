5|$|In April 1970, a {{team led}} by Albert Ghiorso working at the University of California (Berkeley, California, United States) stepped into the competition. They claimed to have {{synthesized}} the element by bombarding a californium-249 <b>target</b> <b>with</b> nitrogen-15 ions. Alpha activity with the energy of 9.1MeV was formed; the team attempted reaction with other nuclides—bombardment of 249Cf with 14N, Pb with 15N, Hg with 15N—and stated no such activity was found in those reactions. The characteristics of the daughter nuclei correlated with those of 256103, implying the assignment of the parent to 260105.|$|E

5|$|In December 2004, the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) team in Dubna, Moscow Oblast, Russia, {{proposed}} a joint {{experiment with the}} Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, United States, to synthesize element 117—so-called for the 117 protons in its nucleus. Their proposal involved fusing a berkelium (element 97) target and a calcium (element 20) beam, conducted via bombardment of the berkelium <b>target</b> <b>with</b> calcium nuclei: this would complete a set of experiments done at the JINR on the fusion of actinide targets with a calcium-48 beam, which had thus far produced the new elements 113–116 and 118. The ORNL—then the world's only producer of berkelium—could not then provide the element, as they had temporarily ceased production, and re-initiating {{it would be too}} costly.

5|$|In {{the second}} semi-final, Super Kings played the Kings XI. The Kings XI won the toss and elected to bat first, but its top six batsman failed {{and only one}} of them reached double figures. However, due to {{significant}} contributions from the lower-order, Punjab managed to reach a total of 112/8. Super Kings fast bowler Manpreet Gony took 3 wickets by conceding just 14 runs. In reply, Super Kings lost its first wicket when Vidyut Sivaramakrishnan were dismissed for 6 runs. However, both Parthiv Patel and Suresh Raina scored a half century each and took the Super Kings to the <b>target</b> <b>with</b> 31 balls to spare. The Super Kings won the match by nine wickets, and Makhaya Ntini was given the man of the match award.|$|E

Another good partnership, between Sara McGlashan (21*) and Lydia Greenway (17*), took the Vipers to their <b>target</b> <b>with</b> seven balls to spare. Taylor, who was named as player of the tournament, was the most effective bowler for the Storm, but even she could only limit the Vipers to six runs per over.|$|E
5|$|Kitsune {{are often}} {{presented}} as tricksters, with motives that vary from mischief to malevolence. Stories tell of kitsune playing tricks on overly proud samurai, greedy merchants, and boastful commoners, while the crueler ones abuse poor tradesmen and farmers or devout Buddhist monks. Their victims are usually men; women are possessed instead. For example, kitsune {{are thought to}} employ their kitsunebi to lead travelers astray {{in the manner of}} a will o' the wisp. Another tactic is for the kitsune to confuse its <b>target</b> <b>with</b> illusions or visions.

5|$|The {{production}} {{methods for}} different isotopes vary, and only those for promethium-147 are given {{because it is}} the only isotope with industrial applications. Promethium-147 is produced in large quantities (compared to other isotopes) by bombarding uranium-235 with thermal neutrons. The output is relatively high, at 2.6% of the total product. Another way to produce promethium-147 is via neodymium-147, which decays to promethium-147 with a short half-life. Neodymium-147 can be obtained either by bombarding enriched neodymium-146 with thermal neutrons or by bombarding a uranium carbide <b>target</b> <b>with</b> energetic protons in a particle accelerator. Another method is to bombard uranium-238 with fast neutrons to cause fast fission, which, among multiple reaction products, creates promethium-147.|$|E
