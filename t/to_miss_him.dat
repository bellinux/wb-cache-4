5|$|After {{watching}} Jackass, Peter and his friends, Cleveland, Quagmire, and Joe are impressed into filming {{their own}} highly dangerous stunts. In one stunt, Peter attempts to jump a lake but instead crashes into a tree, {{causing him to}} fall into the lake and become incapacitated. Brian swims out to save him from drowning, but strains his back during the rescue and also ends up stranded in the water along with Peter, before being rescued by Joe. Lois berates Peter for his actions, since Brian is becoming old and has been smoking and drinking. Peter begins to grow upset about Brian's age so he obtains another dog and names him New Brian. His positive attitude and desirable personality make Brian feel like an outcast and Brian becomes sad that he is now unloved, and rejected. For example in one scene, when the Griffins hear New Brian fart, they think it is cute and when Brian does it, they get furious and kick him out. He ultimately decides to leave the residence, while his family begins <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
500|$|An unnamed narrator (Callum Keith Rennie), {{who as a}} {{teenager}} intended to be the [...] "Michael Jordan of sex" [...] or [...] "Wayne Gretzky with a hard-on", discusses how he met {{and fell in love}} with an older man named Frank. After the two met at a group sex session, they began an older brother–younger brother fantasy and moved in together. Frank has a voracious sexual appetite and, at times, invites the narrator for whole-day sex sessions. He is a tender lover, teaching his partner how to fly a box kite and cooking omelettes for him. The narrator is pleased with Frank's attentions and their sexual experimentation, although he is initially confused by Frank's insistence on listening to Peter Gzowski's Morningside during sex. As their ten-year anniversary approaches, Frank– having lost much weight and developed Kaposi's sarcomas– has been diagnosed with AIDS, leaving the narrator stunned; he concludes the narration with [...] "I'm going <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> <b>him.</b> [...] He was the best friend I ever had." ...|$|E
2500|$|As a four-year-old, Holy Bull won the Olympic Handicap easily but {{was pulled}} {{up during the}} Donn Handicap. Subsequent {{examinations}} showed a bowed tendon but no permanent injury. [...] "If he wasn't Holy Bull, I'd {{bring him back to}} the races next year", said Croll. [...] "I'm sorry we couldn't finish the year with him. He would have gone out in a blaze of glory. He has courage and class. I'm going <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> <b>him.</b> Everybody's going to miss him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I cannot say more," [...] he returned. [...] "I {{have only}} stated Mr. Eden's wishes, and {{certainly}} {{think it would}} be better not <b>to</b> risk <b>missing</b> <b>him</b> by going out tomorrow. In any case I shall see or communicate with your employer." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>To</b> <b>Miss</b> Day, {{crediting}} <b>him</b> {{with the}} same consciousness of mastery--a consciousness {{of which he was}} perfectly innocent--this remark sounded like a magnanimous intention to soothe her, the captive.|$|R
50|$|An injury {{sustained}} by Klose while playing for Norwich City in April 2016, ultimately led <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>missing</b> selection for Euro 2016.|$|R
6000|$|... [Sent to {{a friend}} who had complained that I was glad enough to see him when he came, but didn't seem <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> <b>him</b> if he stayed away.] ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's {{somebody}} here, and, {{in order}} not <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> <b>him,</b> we'll divide our forces once more. If you'll go in by the Hall footpath, Thurston, and whistle on sight of anything suspicious, I'd be much obliged to you." ...|$|E
60|$|So many {{thoughts}} {{rushed through}} his mind, that he fancied he had stood {{there a long}} time, when he turned and hastened down again, {{but he had been}} so rapid as to meet Markham before the servants had had time <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'Did you say {{anything}} <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> <b>Miss</b> May?' said Leonard, turning on her a flushed face, {{as if he could}} almost have been angered with her.|$|R
25|$|When she returned, Sky was gone. She {{called police}} <b>to</b> report <b>him</b> <b>missing.</b> They in turn {{contacted}} Solomon before noon that day.|$|R
6000|$|... "It’ll do ’im good," [...] ses old Burge, when Mrs. Dixon {{read the}} letter to ’em. [...] "It’s a ’ard life is the sea, and he’ll {{appreciate}} his ’ome when ’e comes back to it agin. He don’t know when ’e’s well off. It’s as comfortable a ’ome as a man could wish to ’ave." [...] It was surprising wot a little difference George Dixon’s being away made to the Blue Lion. Nobody seemed <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> <b>’im</b> much, and things went on {{just the same as}} afore he went. Mrs. Dixon was all right with most people, and ’er relations ’ad a very good time of it; old Burge began to put on flesh at such a rate that the sight of a ladder made ’im ill a’most, and Charlie and Bob went about as if the place belonged to ’em.|$|R
60|$|Stephen {{never thought}} of its being beautiful, but he revelled in the {{refreshment}} of anything so like home, and {{he had nothing to}} wish for but his brother, and after all he was too contented and happy even <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> <b>him</b> much.|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose I must {{go down to}} {{the station}} and leave word for him there," [...] said Mr Blake. Miss Lawrie only shook her head. [...] "Mr Hall will be very sorry <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> <b>him.</b> And then I have some special good news to tell him." ...|$|E
60|$|So, Richard {{said there}} was an end of it, and {{immediately}} began, on no other foundation, to build as many castles {{in the air as}} would man the Great Wall of China. He went away in high spirits. Ada and I, prepared <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> <b>him</b> very much, commenced our quieter career.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{you might}} do that, lad," [...] Captain Lister said sadly; [...] "but {{it would be the}} very worst thing you could do. With a hurried shot like that it would be ten <b>to</b> one you <b>missed</b> <b>him,</b> and then he would quietly shoot you down." ...|$|R
6000|$|The girl cast a bewildered {{glance at}} my wife, who said, [...] "You needn't pay any {{attention}} <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> <b>Miss</b> Gage. He has an idea that he is making a joke." ...|$|R
50|$|The hero's (Vladimir Fogel) {{preoccupation with}} chess leads <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>missing</b> his own wedding ceremony, but the marital peace is {{restored}} {{with the help}} of the World Chess Champion, José Raúl Capablanca.|$|R
6000|$|I sat {{reflecting}} upon my evident cosmopolite {{and wondering}} how the poet had managed <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> <b>him.</b> He was my discovery and I believed in him. How was it? [...] "The men that breed from them they traffic up and down, but cling to their cities' hem {{as a child}} to the mother's gown." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{shall not}} have time <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> <b>him</b> now, for {{we are to be}} very busy getting ready for the Twenty-second. The Dramatic Club meets to-night, and would like to come here, if they may, so I can help?" [...] said Jill, as Mrs. Minot came up, expecting to find her rather low in her mind.|$|E
6000|$|... "But <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> <b>him</b> for so long!" [...] said Margaret. [...] "Perhaps it is best, {{for it is}} very miserable when papa is sarcastic and sharp, and he cannot {{understand}} it, {{and takes}} it as meaning {{so much more than}} it really does, and grows all the more frightened and diffident. I cannot think what he would do without you to encourage him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'His {{arms were}} not of any use <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> <b>miss,</b> as I {{did not give}} him time to use them; besides, bullies of that sort are never {{formidable}} when they are faced.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Rocky {{was unhappy}} {{when he left}} after being led to believe Maxine was leading him on all along. He is {{reported}} missing in action, causing Maxine and Mom <b>to</b> both <b>miss</b> <b>him</b> terribly. Frances is delighted to learn that those love letters were for her. When she and Jimmy are wed, Jeannie is shocked to find Paul there and they are reunited. At a party honoring the troops, a sad Maxine, while singing to the men, looks up and is thrilled to see Rocky.|$|R
6000|$|... "I wouldn't try it, sir," [...] cried Billy. [...] "He'll {{strike you}} down {{before you get}} a footing. Hold up, Dolly, my dear! Faintin' won't 'elp us. You speak <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> <b>miss.</b> Maybe he'll listen to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have, at least, a well-polished, {{silver-plated}} coffee-pot {{in front}} of me," [...] said he. [...] "But, tell me, Watson, {{what do you make}} of our visitor's stick? Since we have been so unfortunate as <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> <b>him</b> and have no notion of his errand, this accidental souvenir becomes of importance. Let me hear you reconstruct the man by an examination of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|There came a day, at last, {{in which}} foul air and confinement, and money-making, {{began to tell}} on the {{constitution}} of Mr Denham; to disagree with him, in fact. The rats began <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> <b>him,</b> occasionally, from Redwharf Lane, at the wonted hour, and, no doubt, gossiped a good deal on the subject over their evening meals, after the labours and depredations of the day were ended! ...|$|E
60|$|At {{first they}} {{expected}} to overtake their comrade Cheenbuk there, {{but he was not}} found, having gone a considerable way inland in pursuit of game. Being aware of his peaceful proclivities, however, the Eskimos were not sorry <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> <b>him,</b> and they set about making an encampment on the shore {{at the mouth of the}} river, intending to leave the women there while they should be engaged in hunting and in searching for the Fire-spouters.|$|E
50|$|At the {{execution}} grounds, Asterix defeats Orinjade's executioner and saves her, while Watziznehm intercepts Hoodunnit. Cacofonix recovers his voice by the dose of magic potion he has taken, and sings, causing rain. At the victory feast in the palace, Obelix surmises that his fellow villagers might be having their customary banquet, this time without him. This is proven true; {{and at the}} banquet, some of the Gauls begin to express desire to retrieve the bard, in fear of a drought, and Fulliautomatix the blacksmith, Cacofonix's habitual menace, appears <b>to</b> be <b>missing</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1985 a {{knee injury}} led <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>missing</b> the 1985 Scotland rugby union tour of North America. In 1986 he captained Scotland for a tour of France and Spain during which Scotland won two out of five matches and drew one.|$|R
50|$|Next morning, Paul's body {{is found}} sprawled {{in plain view}} {{at the front of}} the vault. The doctor is called, sees Paul has been dead for several days, and a {{decision}} is made to move the body upstairs. Mike is sent to warn Mrs Brande. Campion investigates the scene of the crime, and finds a recently broken ventilator to the rear of the vault, leading to a garage. Questioning staff, he discovers that the position of the body made it impossible for Mike <b>to</b> have <b>missed</b> <b>him</b> the night before. The police find a length of rubber pipe stained with soot.|$|R
6000|$|... "We're too late; I don't know if I'm sorry," [...] Jake remarked with labored breath. [...] "My notion is, Shanks {{has pulled}} out for good, {{and nobody is}} going <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> <b>him</b> much. Wind's off the land, water's smooth, and the tide will run west {{for three or four}} hours. He'll be a long way down the coast before it turns. In the meantime, we're some {{distance}} from Langrigg and it looks as if you had lost your shoe." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh no! no! please!" [...] said Mrs. Bunker, {{springing}} {{up with an}} imploring feminine gesture; [...] "I am expecting my husband. He may be coming back at any moment; I must be there to see him FIRST! Please let me go back, sir, with your men; put me anywhere ashore between them and those men that are coming. Lock me up; keep me a prisoner in my own home; do anything else if you think I am deceiving you; but don't keep me here <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> <b>him</b> when he comes!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And now," [...] said Ak, [...] "when {{he had won}} {{the love}} of all the world, the Spirit of Death is {{hovering}} over him. Of all men who have inhabited the earth none other so well deserves immortality, for such a life can not be spared {{so long as there}} are children of mankind <b>to</b> <b>miss</b> <b>him</b> and to grieve over his loss. We immortals are the servants of the world, and to serve the world we were permitted in the Beginning to exist. But what one of us is more worthy of immortality than this man Claus, who so sweetly ministers to the little children?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Continuing from Porky's Duck Hunt, Porky with Barnyard Dawg (from the Foghorn Leghorn cartoons) are hunting ducks. Daffy sneaks {{up behind}} them in a giant fake duck and empties the shot from their shells, then walks off with a silly laugh and the phrase [...] "Duck hunters is the cwaziest peoples!" [...] (a {{reference}} to Lew Lehr's Fox Movietone News catchphrase, [...] "Monkeys is the cwaziest people."). Daffy taunts Porky into shooting at him. Porky shoots at Daffy but turns out <b>to</b> have <b>missed</b> <b>him</b> (Daffy flies by with a banner that says [...] "That's What You Think!").|$|R
50|$|Disaster {{struck in}} the lead up to the 1898 Grand National, when a stable boy left Manifesto’s stable door open and the horse escaped. Although he was recaptured, he managed to badly bruise a fetlock jumping a gate, leading <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>missing</b> the race.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do not try <b>to</b> shield <b>him,</b> <b>Miss</b> Bartlett. I {{know him}} better than you do. He is a very lazy and heedless boy, and I have already {{made up my mind}} what I am going to do in the matter." ...|$|R
