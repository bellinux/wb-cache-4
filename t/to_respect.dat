5|$|Although the Loons were afforded {{respect as}} {{principal}} peace chiefs, this status was not permanent. The Cranes, led in Buffalo's time by his sub-chief Tagwagane, maintained {{that they were}} the hereditary chiefs. They said the Loons' status as spokesmen hinged upon recognition by the Cranes. A chief's power in Ojibwa society was based on persuasion and consensus; it was contingent, holding only as long as the community of elders, including the women, chose <b>to</b> <b>respect</b> and follow the chief's lead.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{creation}} of the new archdiocese, Jaenberht retained his position as the senior cleric in the land, with Hygeberht conceding his precedence. When Jaenberht died in 792, he was replaced by Æthelheard, who was consecrated by Hygeberht, now senior in his turn. Subsequently Æthelheard appears as a witness on charters and presides at synods without Hygeberht, so it appears that Offa continued <b>to</b> <b>respect</b> Canterbury's authority.|$|E

5|$|During the war, Seward comes <b>to</b> <b>respect</b> and {{collaborate}} with Lincoln. Chase, {{on the other}} hand, schemes against Lincoln from within the cabinet, hoping to replace him as the Republican nominee in the 1864 presidential election. Lincoln nonetheless keeps Chase in the cabinet until 1864 for his skill at financing the war effort, and his efforts to undermine the president are ultimately unsuccessful. Lincoln also recruits Chase ally Edwin M. Stanton to replace Pennsylvania political boss Simon Cameron as Secretary of War; like Seward, Stanton comes <b>to</b> <b>respect</b> and support Lincoln. While managing the disparate personalities of his cabinet, Lincoln also struggles to manage a series of generals including George B. McClellan, Henry Halleck, and George Meade. The president finally finds success in 1864 by promoting Ulysses S. Grant to commander of the Union armies. Lincoln oversees {{the passage of the}} Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which abolishes slavery, and sees the war to its successful conclusion. He also appoints Chase as the Chief Justice of the US Supreme Court, believing him the best man to secure the rights of newly freed black citizens.|$|E
