50|$|<b>Three</b> <b>phase</b> <b>separators</b> {{are used}} in oil and gas {{production}} to separate water, oil, and gas into isolated streams. A separator, in general, is a pressurized vessel that is used to divide a product based on principles of chemical separation such as phase and density. These vessels are also known as de-liquidizers or degassers because they either remove liquid from the bulk gas stream or remove gas from the bulk liquid stream during processing. Pressure optimization based on sample compositions taken upstream can provide a solution to inefficient separations and can help to reduce the overall amount of flash gas produced.|$|R

40|$|In {{this project}} report the control {{structure}} for a <b>three</b> <b>phase</b> <b>separator</b> for a oil production unit is examined. The {{purpose is to}} analyse the control structure, and make the suggestion for how a control structure based on single loop control, can be designed to reject large disturbance occurring in the system. The second {{goal is to make}} a tuning method based on the plant properties to prevent process shutdown, that keeps the process running smooth. The assignment text states that the following tools can be used to develop the control structure: feed forward control, gain scheduling, first and second order filters, PI- and PID-controllers. A process model containing all process variables is derived in the report. For verification purposes and development of control structure and tuning, the model is implemented in MATLAB and Simulink where simulations are done. The model is normalised such that the control structure is tested for the general case. Plant verification model is based on dimensions from a real plant, but process parameters are changed for comparing with other plants. Tools like gain scheduler, anti-windup, derivative filter and low pass filter are derived and designed for the purpose. The report shows which parameters that limit the process performance and which techniques that should be used to reduce their impact to the system. There is also made analysis for how control loops and the controller can regard the limitations. An important part of this is the development of a signal filter to reduce measurement noise in the system. As a basis for controller tuning SIMC is used. The system is analysed to find a method adapted for separator tuning. The customised method is tested for different plants and compared to SIMC to verify the abilities to control the plant. Analyses of the system, is done for a linear system, even though the system is nonlinear. To be able to use linear system techniques, analysis is done for the system linearised around setpoint and chosen points within the working area. The result of the report, is a suggestion for how single loop control structure, and tuning can be performed for a separator based on the plant properties. </p...|$|E
40|$|A liquid/gas <b>phase</b> <b>separator</b> {{has been}} {{developed}} which separates both liquid He-I and He-II from their vapor. The <b>phase</b> <b>separator</b> was designed for the Superfluid Helium On Orbit Transfer (SHOOT) Flight Demonstration both to cool the liquid He after launch (at temperatures between 2. 8 and 4. 3 K) to the operating temperature of 1. 4 K and as a low rate vent on orbit to maintain operating temperature.

40|$|In {{the oil and}} gas {{reservoirs}} {{the knowledge}} of the produced volumes of oil, gas and water from single well is important for efficiency and performance monitoring. Conventional metering systems require a two or <b>three</b> <b>phase</b> <b>separator,</b> followed by independent metering device for each phase. This systems need expensive and cumbersome test separators, high maintenance and field personnel intervention. They require also regular intervention by trained personnel and cannot provide continuous well monitoring. A viable and functional alternative to multiphase separators are Multiphase Flow Metering (MFM) systems. A Multiphase Flow Meter is a device to simultaneously quantify oil, water and gas flow rates in pipelines. These measurement are generally unmet but vital in the oil industry, that began to develop and use MFM in the early 1980 s especially in the off-shore oil production. The oil companies that give their main contribution to the development of MFMs are BP, Texaco, Shell, Agip and Petrobas. MFM also find a lot of application in the nuclear, food, mining and biofuels industries. MFM applications can help facility production, well testing, reservoir management, allocation metering production, well monitoring for optimization and flow assurance, subsea metering and costs, including minimizing environmental impact. MFM focus is to determinate the flow rates of the individual components (oil, water and gas) without physically separating of the flow stream in each phase. MFM is considered among the primary metering solutions for new field development. Cause the great diversity of oil field conditions, MFMs are required to work under a very wide range conditions of flow rates, gas/oil ratio, water/oil ratio, pressure, temperature, pipe size, viscosity. Hence, it is necessary to study and describe the expected flow regimes from the wells. The biggest obstacle to the successful implementation of multiphase metering is the general lack of understanding of what it is about. Multiphase flow is a complex phenomenon which can be difficulty predicted by numerical simulations. The aim of the present work is to contribute to the MFM improvement. The device studied in this work is a control valve with a measurement system integrated which can measure the flow of each phase in two-phase flow, constituted by liquid and gas. The measuring system consists of a flow meter based on pressure difference measurements on the valve body, that allows to calculate liquid flow rate, and on the internal part present {{in the body of the}} valve, that allows to calculate the total flow. In this way it will be possible to calculate liquid and gas flow rates. The device should have a good accuracy. This focus have been set on an error less than ± 10 %...|$|E

The objective of this thesis is to develop steady state and dynamic models in HYSYS. Then, comparatively investigate the separator model for optimization and control relative to a similar work by Tyvold. Although HYSYS is based on perfect thermodynamic separation, it was possible to implement both steady state and dynamic models with non-ideal separators using the Real Separator capabilities of HYSYS. The HYSYS Real Separator capabilities offers the advantage of including carry over in order to match the separator design specification, and predicting the feed conditions or phase dispersion, device geometry, as well as inlet/exit devices on the carry over. The steady state model was optimized by performing simulations at different flow rates, oil cuts and residence time. The modelling approach was based on semi-empirical equations from stokes law, GSPA and Barnea & Mizrahi correlations. Several simulations were performed, on the HYSYS separator model, by varying the flow rates, oil cuts and residence time (factor) of the inlet stream: then, the separator efficiency was investigated by observing the purities of the product streams accordingly.

One {{of them is a}} <b>phase</b> <b>separator</b> which separates superfluid helium from its vapor. Another device is a thermomechanical pump which tranfers and circulates suprefluid helium in a cooling system. Thermomechanical effect (fountain effect) of superfluid helium with a porous medium gives a simple but effective working principle to such devices. Unfortunately, however, not all situations of the superfluid helium flow through a porous medium are ideal, i. e., predicted theoretically on the basis of two-fluid equations without appreciable dissipation effects. This study has an objective to understand experimentally the superfluid helium flow through a porous medium, i. e., a common phenomenon for both porous plug <b>phase</b> <b>separators</b> and thermomechanical pumps. In this experimental study, flow characteristics of superfluid helium through a porous element of a thermomechanical pump are measured precisely with the special emphasis on the observation of a transition from the ideal state to the superfluid turbulent one. It is found that the critical heat input depends on the temperature of superfluid helium. Its temperature dependence is also quantitatively clarified. General flow characteristics of superfluid helium through a porous medium are proposed, concerning with properties of the porous medium, based on the experimental data on the suprefluid helium flows through both porous plug <b>phase</b> <b>separators</b> and porous elements of thermomechanical pumps.

In this thesis, a nonlinear model predictive control is applied to a <b>three</b> <b>phase</b> subsea gravity <b>separator</b> system. The main modeling principle used to describe the oil droplets rising and settling of the droplets is given by Stokes law. Nonlinear dynamic equations were derived for the water level, total liquid level and for the pressure of the gas in the system based on the inflow and outflow dynamics, and were implemented in MATLAB as script files. The equations were nonlinear due to the geometry of the separator. These nonlinear models were formulated as a semi-explicit DAE system. The NMPC optimization problem used in this report is solved using direct collocation method using CasADi software within the MATLAB programming environment. Simulation studies have been carried out for four cases, namely setpoint tracking, disturbance rejection, sensitivity to measurement noise and the optimal water level investigation. The performance of the closed loop Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) has been studied based on the simulation results. Simulation results were carried out to analyze the effect of measurement noise on the performance of the controller. Based on this analysis, the performance of the system for remaining cases was studied. The controller was analyzed for the setpoint tracking scenario where step change in water level was introduced to the system. Additionally, the performance of the controller to reject the disturbances was studied. Finally, the optimal level of water in the separator was investigated based on maximization of the total volume of oil entering its native phase...|$|R
40|$|Presented is {{a system}} for {{modulation}} of a superfluid (helium II) flow in a vapor-liquid <b>phase</b> <b>separator,</b> for use in cryogenic storage tanks in future space missions. The system consists of a semicircular mechanically operated shutter, downstream of the separator plug, rotated at 0. 1 rpm to control the operational surface area of the separator. The mass flow rate was varied from 10 to 22 mg/s. Pressure gradients across the plug are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Prototype {{dilution}} cryocoolers {{based on}} dilution refrigeration and adiabatic demagnetization refrigeration (ADR) cycles were designed, constructed, and tested. Although devices the devices did not operate as fully functional dilution cryocoolers, important information was gathered. The porous metal <b>phase</b> <b>separator</b> was demonstrated {{to operate in}} the - 1 -g configuration; this phase separation is the critical element in the He- 3 circulation dilution cryocooler. Improvements in instrumentation needed for additional tests and development were identified...|$|R
