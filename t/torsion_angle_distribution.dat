The technique not only allowed quantitative determination of both the relative ratios and average torsion angles for the trans and gauche bonds, but also set an upper limit for {{the width of the}} <b>torsion</b> <b>angle</b> <b>distribution.</b> The studies confirmed that the OC-CO bonds in crystalline PEO all adopt a gauche torsion angle and determined an average angle of Ψ = 74 ± 4 ° with a distribution width of σΨ 3 ̆c 9 °. The spectra of the PEO-resorcinol and PEO-poly(α,L-glutamate) blends showed little difference from that of crystalline PEO. PEO/PNP was shown to be a suitable model system for studying conformation because 1 / 3 of OC-CO bonds are trans and the complex has extremely slow dynamics at room temperature. Simulations of the double-quantum spectra set an upper limit for the trans <b>torsion</b> <b>angle</b> <b>distribution</b> width of σ Ψ 3 ̆c 7 °.

There are too many variable <b>torsion</b> <b>angles</b> per residue, and their raw empirical distributions are poorly clustered. This study applies quality-filtering techniques (using resolution, crystallographic B factor, and all-atom steric clashes) to the backbone <b>torsion</b> <b>angle</b> <b>distributions</b> from an 8, 636 -residue RNA database. With noise levels greatly reduced, clear signal appears for the underlying <b>angle</b> preferences.

Traditional nucleic acid residues are defined from phosphate to phosphate, but here we use a base-to-base (or sugar-to-sugar) division into “suites” to parse the RNA backbone repeats, both because most backbone steric clashes are within suites and because the relationship of successive bases is both reliably determined and conformationally important. A suite conformer has seven variables, with sugar pucker specified at both ends. Potential suite conformers were omitted if not represented by at least a small cluster of convincing data points after application of quality filters.

In this work we use classical tools from statistics and signal processing to search for clusters in the RNA backbone <b>torsion</b> <b>angles.</b> Results are reported both for scalar studies, where each <b>torsion</b> <b>angle</b> is separately studied, and for vectorial studies, where several angles are simultaneously clustered.

40|$|Abstract Background Understanding and {{predicting}} {{protein stability}} upon point mutations has wide-spread importance in molecular biology. Several prediction {{models have been}} developed in the past with various algorithms. Statistical potentials {{are one of the}} widely used algorithms for the prediction of changes in stability upon point mutations. Although the methods provide flexibility and the capability to develop an accurate and reliable prediction model, it can be achieved only by the right selection of the structural factors and optimization of their parameters for the statistical potentials. In this work, we have selected five atom classification systems and compared their efficiency for the development of amino acid atom potentials. Additionally, torsion angle potentials have been optimized to include the orientation of amino acids {{in such a way that}} altered backbone conformation in different secondary structural regions can be included for the prediction model. This study also elaborates the importance of classifying the mutations according to their solvent accessibility and secondary structure specificity. The prediction efficiency has been calculated individually for the mutations in different secondary structural regions and compared. Results Results show that, in addition to using an advanced atom description, stepwise regression and selection of atoms are necessary to avoid the redundancy in atom distribution and improve the reliability of the prediction model validation. Comparing to other atom classification models, Melo-Feytmans model shows better prediction efficiency by giving a high correlation of 0. 85 between experimental and theoretical ΔΔG with 84. 06 % of the mutations correctly predicted out of 1538 mutations. The theoretical ΔΔG values for the mutations in partially buried β -strands generated by the structural training dataset from PISCES gave a correlation of 0. 84 without performing the Gaussian apodization of the <b>torsion</b> <b>angle</b> <b>distribution.</b> After the Gaussian apodization, the correlation increased to 0. 92 and prediction accuracy increased from 80 % to 88. 89 % respectively. Conclusion These findings were useful for the optimization of the Melo-Feytmans atom classification system and implementing them to develop the statistical potentials. It was also significant that the prediction efficiency of mutations in the partially buried β -strands improves with the help of Gaussian apodization of the <b>torsion</b> <b>angle</b> <b>distribution.</b> All these comparisons and optimization techniques demonstrate their advantages as well as the restrictions for the development of the prediction model. These findings will be quite helpful not only for the protein stability prediction, but also for various structure solutions in future. </p...|$|E

This work is an endeavor toward investigating the diffusional behavior of two different type of guests, hexadecane- 1, 16 -diol and hexadecane enclathration in urea tunnel architecture, whereby the correlation of the diffusion mechanism with the guest’s structural and conformational properties is explored. To carry out this study, molecular dynamics simulation approach is adopted. It is found that hexadecane- 1, 16 -diol exhibit slower diffusion with an average diffusion coefficient value ~ 1. 83 × 10 - 10, where hexadecane diffuse more rapidly with an average diffusion coefficient value ~ 2. 58 × 10 - 9.

40|$|By {{providing}} {{new insights}} into the distribution of a protein’s <b>torsion</b> <b>angles,</b> recent statistical models for this data have pointed the way to more efficient methods for protein structure prediction. Most current approaches have concentrated on bivariate models at a single sequence position. There is, however, considerable value in simultaneously modeling angle pairs at multiple sequence positions in a protein. One area of application for such models is in structure prediction for the highly variable loop and turn regions. Such modeling is difficult {{due to the fact that}} the number of known protein structures available to estimate these <b>torsion</b> <b>angle</b> <b>distributions</b> is typically small. Furthermore, the data is “sparse ” in that not all proteins have angle pairs at each sequence position.

We show that the resultant topology provides improved association with folding and unfolding rates determined for a set of two-state proteins under standardized conditions. Furthermore, unlike existing topologies, the proposed geometry exhibits fine scale structure with respect to sequence position along the chain, potentially providing insights into folding initiation and/or nucleation sites...|$|R

To illustrate this phenomenon at the molecular scale, we applied molecular dynamics method to predict the Tg of PI, which were prepared based on 4, 4 ’-oxydianiline (ODA) and 3, 3 ’, 4, 4 ’-biphenyltetracarboxylic dianhydride (3, 3 ’, 4, 4 ’-BPDA), and its isomeric system (2, 2 ’, 3, 3 ’-BPDA-ODA). Simulation result is consistent with experimental value. Non-bond energy {{plays an important role}} in glass transition process, for it has an abrupt change near Tg. The higher free volume fraction of isomeric PI can provide the polymer with more space to obtain segmental motion. However, from the <b>torsion</b> <b>angle</b> <b>distribution</b> calculations, it is shown that the torsion angle of its biphenyl group is constrained. Furthermore, from mean square displacement and vector autocorrelation functions calculations, this group is observed to rotate against other groups in the glassy state, and increases the chain rigidity to a great extent. So the isomeric PI needs much more relaxation time for the segment motion. Therefore, the higher Tg of isomeric PI is mainly attributed to the chain rigidity for the time scale, not the free volume for the space scale...|$|E

Here we extend this analysis to the glycan± protein linkage, and the peptide primary, secondary, and tertiary structures around N-glycosylation sites. We surveyed 506 glycoproteins in the Protein Data Bank crystallographic database, giving 2592 glycosylation sequons (1683 occupied) and generated a database of 626 nonredundant sequons with 386 occupied. Deviations in the expected amino acid composi-tion were seen around occupied asparagines, particularly an increased occurrence of aromatic residues before the aspara-gine and threonine at position 2. Glycosylation alters the asparagine side chain <b>torsion</b> <b>angle</b> <b>distribution</b> and reduces its flexibility. There is an elevated probability of finding glycosylation sites in which secondary structure changes. An 11 -class taxonomy was developed to describe protein surface geometry around glycosylation sites. Thirty-three percent of the occupied sites are on exposed convex surfaces, 10 % in deep recesses and 20 % {{on the edge of}} grooves with the glycan filling the cleft. A surprisingly large number of glycosylated asparagine residues have a low accessibility. The incidence of aromatic amino acids brought into close contact with the glycan by the folding process is higher than their normal levels on the surface or in the protein core. These data have signifi-cant implications for control of sequon occupancy and evolu-tionary selection of glycosylation sites and are discussed in relation tomechanisms of protein fold stabilization and region-al quality control of protein folding.

This includes the characterization of the solution conformations of the leukemia drug target Abelson (ABL) kinase in complex with three clinical drugs (imatinib, nilotinib and dasatinib), unstructured/urea-denatured polypeptides, and the transcriptional repressor in the highly conserved Notch pathway, HES 1. Solution NMR studies of ABL kinase in complex with three clinical inhibitors Aberrant forms of ABL kinase are important drug targets for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). The results of this thesis provide the first detailed characterization of solution conformations of ABL tyrosine kinase in complex with three effective clinical inhibitors imatinib, nilotinib and dasatinib. In solution, a centrally located regulatory segment termed the activation loop adopts the non-ATP binding inactive conformation in complex with imatinib and nilotinib, and preserves the ATP-binding active conformation in complex with dasatinib. However, relaxation studies and/or line broadening of some resonances in the activation loop and the phosphate-binding loop (P-loop) indicate presence of microsecond to millisecond dynamics for all the investigated ABL-inhibitor complexes. These results contribute to our understanding of drug resistance and support the rational design of improved kinase inhibitors (Manley et al., 2006, Vajpai et al., 2008 a, Vajpai et al., 2008 b). Conformational studies of unstructured oligopeptides by residual dipolar couplings The characterization of unfolded states of polypeptide chains is of high significance with regard to their role in biological processes and to understanding protein folding. Here, we have investigated the influence of amino acid substitutions X on the conformation of unfolded model peptides EGAAXAASS as monitored by backbone RDCs. The RDCs show a specific dependence on the substitutions X that correlates to steric or hydrophobic interactions with the adjacent amino acids. RDC profiles along the nonapeptide sequence show large variations for a few amino acid substitutions. In particular, RDCs for glycine and proline indicate less or more order than the other amino acids, respectively. The RDCs for aromatic substitutions tryptophan/tyrosine or isoleucine give evidence of kink or stiffness in the polypeptide backbone (Dames et al., 2006). For a quantitative description, these experimental results were compared to the predictions from the statistical coil model, which derives amino acid specific local conformations from the <b>torsion</b> <b>angle</b> <b>distribution</b> of non-, non- structures in folded proteins, or all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. While the coil model reproduced, to some extent, the observed RDC pattern for most substitutions, MD simulations showed stronger deviations from the experimental data. This indicates specific deficiencies in both the statistical coil model and the MD simulations. For the coil model, the discrepancy may be related to imperfect modeling of the side chains, while for MD simulations, inadequate sampling of the conformational space in the time used for the simulations may be the most plausible reason. Side-chains conformations in urea-denatured proteins: a study by 3 J scalar couplings and residual dipolar couplings In order to probe the conformational behavior of the side-chains in unfolded states, we have measured an extensive set of six three-bond scalar couplings (3 JNH, 3 JC’H and 3 JHH) and two 1 DCH residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) on urea-denatured proteins, ubiquitin and protein G. Interpretation of the 3 J couplings by a model of mixed staggered χ 1 rotamers yields excellent agreement and also provides stereoassignments for 1 Hβ methylene protons. Independent analysis of 1 DCH RDCs obtained in polyacrylamide gels show good correlation with the RDCs predicted from the  1 populations obtained from the 3 J data and a coil model ensemble of 50000 conformers according to the coil library backbone angle distribution.

The measurement of 3 J(C',Cgamma) and 3 J(N,Cgamma) coupling constants has enabled side-chain chi 1 <b>torsion</b> <b>angle</b> populations to be probed in the denatured polypeptide chain. Analysis of the coupling constant data has allowed the relative populations of the three staggered rotamers about chi 1 to be defined for 51 residues. The amino acids can broadly be divided into five classes that show differing side-chain conformational preferences in the denatured state. These range from a strong preference for the - 60 degrees chi 1 rotamer for methionine and leucine (74 - 79 % population) to a favouring of the + 60 degrees chi 1 rotamer for threonine (67 % population). The differences in behaviour reflect the steric and electrostatic characteristics of the side-chains concerned. A close agreement is seen between the chi 1 populations calculated from the experimental coupling constant data and predictions from the statistical model for a random coil that uses the chi 1 <b>torsion</b> <b>angle</b> <b>distributions</b> in a data base of native protein structures.

40|$|Understanding the {{structure}} of materials, and how this structure affects their properties, {{is an important step}} towards the understanding that is necessary in order to apply computational methods to the end of designing materials to fit very specific needs. Such needs include specific optical and mechanical properties. In polymers, the ability to easily create orientation through a variety of processes allows the production of materials that, while chemically similar, exhibit a wide variety of optical and mechanical properties. The ability to illuminate the connections between structure and optical or mechanical properties depends on the ability to reliably interpret a wide variety of experimental measurements. I assert that thermodynamic consistency and energy minimization {{is an integral part of}} this endeavor; reliable analyses of structure and properties are built upon the foundation of a minimum-free-energy ensemble of configurations that reproduces the experimental results. This project encompasses three goals, which make up this thesis: 1) to show how sets of experimental measurements are integrated into simulations to produce thermodynamically consistent, minimum-free-energy ensembles; 2) to show how these ensembles can characterize the conformations of macromolecules, which are not available from direct simulation; 3) to show how dynamic processes, which create inhomogeneous systems can be incorporated, along with experimental structural measurements, into thermodynamically consistent, minimum-free-energy ensembles. To achieve the first of these goals, we describe the application of the Semi-Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (SGMC) method to analyze and interpret experimental data for non-equilibrium polymer melts and glasses. Experiments that provide information about atomic-level ordering, e. g. birefringence, are amenable to this approach. (cont.) Closure of the inverse problem of determining the structural detail from limited data is achieved by selecting the lowest-free-energy ensemble of configurations that reproduces the experimental data. The free energy is calculated using the thermodynamic potential of the appropriate semi-grand canonical (SGC) ensemble [...] ., as defined by the experimental data. To illustrate the method we examine uniaxially oriented polyethylene melts of average chain length up to C 400. The simulation results are analyzed for features not explicitly measured by birefringence, such as the density, <b>torsion</b> <b>angle</b> <b>distribution,</b> molecular scale orientation and free energy, to understand more fully the underlying features of these non-equilibrium states. The stress-optical rule for polyethylene is evaluated in this way. The second goal is achieved through multi-scale modeling, which requires the selection and preservation of information crucial to understanding the behavior of a system at appropriate length and time scales. For a description of processed polymers, such a model must successfully link rheological properties with atomic-level structure. We propose a method for the calculation of an important rheological state descriptor, the configuration tensor, from atomistic simulations of oligomers. The method requires no adjustable parameters and can describe anisotropic polymer conformations at conditions of significant deformation. We establish the validity of the atomistic-to-macromolecular scaling by comparing the consistency of macromolecular predictions of among different polyethylene (PE) oligomer systems. We use this method with the previously reported Semi-Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (SGMC) method to deduce macromolecular and atomic-level structural information interchangeably for systems with flow-induced orientation. Introducing the ability to model arbitrary points in a dynamic process fulfills the third goal elaborated above. (cont.) Because the characteristic relaxation times of processed polymer chains often span several orders of magnitude, it is commonly the case that partial relaxation of the chains is frozen into the final product. We report results of molecular simulations by the Semi-grand Canonical Monte Carlo (SGMC) method to study the orientation-dependent elasticity of glassy polystyrene as a function of both the system-average degree of orientation and the degree of relaxation of chain ends at a constant average degree of orientation, in accord with the tube model of Doi and Edwards. Our simulations reproduce quantitatively the experimentally observed changes in the tensile modulus E 33 as a function of both average orientation and inhomogeneity of the orientation due to partial relaxation. The results show that the partial relaxation of the polymer chains is sufficient to explain the observed variation of mechanical properties for samples that differ in processing history, yet have the same observed birefringence. by Frederick E.

The exact details of the algorithm are provided in a paper published by Dr. Wishart and colleagues. After training and appropriate validation on independent tests sets, this SVR model is able to estimate the resolution of solved X-ray structures with a correlation coefficient of 0.92, mean absolute error of 0.28 Angstroms. This is about 15-30% better than existing methods. This is shown in Figure 1. Because the performance of the ResProx method is so high and because it only needs coordinate data to generate an estimate of the equivalent X-ray resolution, it is ideally suited to be applied to NMR structures. Interestingly when NMR structures are analyzed by ResProx, the average NMR structure has an equivalent X-ray resolution of 2.8 Angstroms—which is relatively poor (Fig. 2). This is in agreement with qualitative observations regarding the overall quality and precision of NMR structures.

For alpha helices, 3 (10) helices and beta strands mean predicted 3 JHN alpha coupling constants are 4. 8, 5. 6 and 8. 5 Hz, respectively. These values differ significantly from those expected for the ideal phi angles (3. 9, 3. 0 and 8. 9 Hz; phi = - 57 degrees, - 49 degrees, - 139 degrees for alpha and 3 (10) helices and beta strands (antiparallel), respectively) in regular secondary structure, but agree well with available experimental NMR data for nine proteins. The crystallographic data set has also been used to provide a basis for interpreting coupling constants measured for peptides and denatured proteins. Using a model for a random coil, in which all residues adopt distributions of phi, psi angles equivalent to those seen for residues in the coil regions of native folded proteins, predicted 3 JHN alpha values for different residue types have been found to range from 5. 9 Hz and 6. 1 Hz for glycine and alanine, respectively, to 7. 7 Hz for valine. A good correlation has been found between the predicted 3 JHN alpha coupling constants for this model and experimental values for a set of peptides that other evidence suggest are highly unstructured. For other peptides, however, deviations from the predictions of the model are clear and provide evidence for additional interactions within otherwise disordered states.

A spin probe, with a similar structure to one of the molecules studied, was synthesised. This allowed complimentary correlation time measurement, and showed that the molecule rotated isotropically. Difficulties were encountered in fitting the NMR data to the motional models and the need for higher radiofrequency data is indicated, to check the validity of the models used. The NMR, ESR and molecular dynamics results did, however, provide a consistent indication of the differing rigidities and motions of these molecules...|$|R

40|$|The {{usefulness}} of representing an ensemble of NMR-derived protein structures {{by a single}} structure has been investigated. Two stereochemical properties {{have been used to}} assess how a single structure relates to the ensemble from which it was derived, namely the distribution of phi psi <b>torsion</b> <b>angles</b> and the <b>distribution</b> of chi 1 <b>torsion</b> <b>angles.</b> The results show that the minimized average structure derived from the ensemble (a total of 11 ensembles from the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank were analyzed) does not always correspond well with this ensemble, particularly for those ensembles generated with a smaller number of experimentally derived restraints per residue. An alternative method that selects the member of the ensemble which is closest to the "average" of the ensemble has been investigated (a total of 23 ensembles from the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank were analyzed). Although this method selected a structure that on the whole corresponded more closely to the ensemble than did the minimized average structure, this is still not a totally reliable means of selecting a single structure to represent the ensemble. This suggests that it is advisable to study the ensemble as a whole. A study has also been made of the practice of selecting the "best" rather than the most representative member of the ensemble. This too suggests that the ensemble should be studied as a whole. A study of the conformational space occupied by the ensemble also suggests the need to consider the ensemble as a whole, particularly for those ensembles generated with a smaller number of experimentally derived restraints per residue...|$|R

5000|$|PREDITOR (PREDIction of <b>TORsion</b> <b>angles)</b> is a freely {{available}} web-server for {{the prediction}} of protein <b>torsion</b> <b>angles</b> from chemical shifts. For many years it has been known that protein chemical shifts are sensitive to protein secondary structure, which in turn, is sensitive to backbone <b>torsion</b> <b>angles.</b> <b>torsion</b> <b>angles</b> are internal coordinates {{that can be used}} to describe the conformation of a polypeptide chain. They can also be used as constraints to help determine or refine protein structures via NMR spectroscopy. In proteins there are four major <b>torsion</b> <b>angles</b> of interest: phi, psi, omega and chi-1. Traditionally protein NMR spectroscopists have used vicinal J-coupling information and the Karplus relation to determine approximate backbone <b>torsion</b> <b>angle</b> constraints for phi and chi-1 angles. However, several studies in the early 1990s pointed out the strong relationship between 1H and 13C chemical shifts and <b>torsion</b> <b>angles,</b> especially with backbone phi and psi angles. Later a number of other papers pointed out additional chemical shift relationships with chi-1 and even omega angles. PREDITOR was designed to exploit these experimental observations and to help NMR spectroscopists easily predict protein <b>torsion</b> <b>angles</b> from chemical shift assignments. Specifically, PREDITOR accepts protein sequence and/or chemical shift data as input and generates <b>torsion</b> <b>angle</b> predictions for phi, psi, omega and chi-1 angles. The algorithm that PREDITOR uses combines sequence alignment, chemical shift alignment and a number of related chemical shift analysis techniques to predict <b>torsion</b> <b>angles.</b> PREDITOR is unusually fast (<40 s per protein) and exhibits a very high level of accuracy. In a series of tests 88% of PREDITOR’s phi/psi predictions were within 30 degrees of the correct values, 84% of chi-1 predictions (3-state predictions) were correct and 99.97% of PREDITOR’s predicted omega angles were correct. PREDITOR also estimates the <b>torsion</b> <b>angle</b> errors so that its <b>torsion</b> <b>angle</b> constraints can be used with standard protein structure refinement software, such as CYANA, CNS, XPLOR and AMBER. PREDITOR also supports automated protein chemical shift re-referencing and {{the prediction of}} proline cis/trans states. PREDITOR is not the only <b>torsion</b> <b>angle</b> prediction software available. Several other computer programs including TALOS, TALOS+ [...] and DANGLE [...] have also been developed to predict backbone <b>torsion</b> <b>angles</b> from protein chemical shifts. These stand-alone programs exhibit similar prediction performance to PREDITOR but are substantially slower.|$|R

40|$|Heterogeneous {{nucleation}} phenomena, {{in particular}} the condensation of vapors in presence of a substrate, are studied by molecular dynamics simulations. The simulations reported to this date have {{paid little attention to}} the description on the substrate. Here the dynamics of the vapor phase and the surface are simultaneously treated. Two cases are studied: the condensation of argon and the condensation of platinum on polyethylene films. The fundamental difference between both systems is the relative strength of the adsorbate-substrate interactions. The United Atom Method is used to represent the interactions of methyl groups within the polymer. The properties of polyethylene in the bulk phase such as the glass transition temperature, the density and the formation of gauche defects in the crystalline phase can be well described with this model. The interactions between argon atoms can be well represented by the Lennard Jones potential. The Embedded Atom Method is used to describe interactions between platinum atoms since many body effects, important in metals, can be incorporated with a computation requirement similar to pair potentials. Cross interactions between different types of atoms and groups are here approximated by the Lennard Jones potential with Lorentz-Berthelot combining parameters. The aim of this investigation is to describe the dynamics of heterogeneous nucleation and to establish the variables which control the growth and structure formation of clusters on the surface, the nucleation rates, and possible modifications of the substrate during condensation. For this purpose, different conditions of the saturation of the vapor phase and temperature of the substrate were simulated in each of the systems studied. Stationary nucleation rates in vapor phase and on the surface are obtained from cluster size statistics using the method of Yasuoka and Matsumoto. Different growth mechanisms were observed in for the simulated systems. Argon tends to condense on the surface as two-dimensional islands which finally coalesce as layers on the polymer surface. Consistent with this type of growth the condensation in the regime of low saturated and undersaturated vapors can be explained by a two- dimensional model within the frame of the classical nucleation theory. Platinum clusters condense as three-dimensional islands and partially wet the polymer surface. For the first time the embedding of metal atoms and metal clusters growth into a polymer substrate, as observed in experiments, is attained by large-scale molecular simulations. Depending on their sizes, the platinum clusters can diffuse into the polymer matrix even at temperatures lower than the glass transition of the polymer. The routines used for the simulation and analysis have been specially developed for the systems studied. Among them are NpT and NVT ensemble molecular dynamics simulations for the preparation and equilibration of thin polymer films, simulations of condensation of argon and platinum on polyethylene films. Furthermore routines developed for the analysis of simulation results include the calculation of a) radial <b>distribution</b> functions, <b>torsion</b> <b>angle</b> <b>distributions</b> and density profiles for the characterization of polymers, b) algorithms for the recognition of clusters in bulk and on a surface and c) routines for the visualization of the performed simulations...|$|R
