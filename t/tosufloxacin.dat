40|$|The {{antibacterial}} {{activities of}} <b>tosufloxacin</b> and other quinolones against and apparent uptakes of <b>tosufloxacin</b> and other quinolones by outer membrane mutants of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Salmonella typhimurium were studied. The hydrophobicity of <b>tosufloxacin</b> was nearly {{equal to that}} of ofloxacin or lower than those of sparfloxacin and nalidixic acid. OmpF- and OmpC-deficient E. coli and 40 -kDa porin-deficient P. mirabilis mutants were twofold more susceptible to <b>tosufloxacin</b> and sparfloxacin but two- to fourfold less susceptible to other quinolones than their parent strains. In S. typhimurium lipopolysaccharide-deficient (rough) mutants, the differences in susceptibility to <b>tosufloxacin</b> were similar to those to sparfloxacin and nalidixic acid. The apparent uptake of <b>tosufloxacin</b> by intact cells was increased in porin-deficient mutants compared with that by their parent strain. These results suggest that the permeation route of <b>tosufloxacin</b> across the outer membrane is different from that of other fluoroquinolones and that <b>tosufloxacin</b> may permeate mainly through the nonporin pathway, presumably phospholipid bilayers. However, this characteristic is independent of the hydrophobicity of the molecule.

40|$|Haruki Katahira, Shigeto Kumakura, Takaaki Hattori, Hiroshi Goto Department of Ophthalmology, Tokyo Medical University, Shinjukuku, Tokyo, Japan Purpose: To {{report the}} adverse event of topical <b>tosufloxacin</b> {{administered}} after penetrating keratoplasty in one patient. Case report: A 60 -year-old female {{was referred to}} our hospital for treatment of vision loss due to corneal opacification, etiology was unknown. Slit lamp examination showed dense opacification in corneal stroma. Penetrating keratoplasty was performed on her left eye. She was treated with topical applications of 1. 5 % levofloxacin, 0. 5 % cefmenoxime, 0. 1 % betamethasone, 0. 1 % hyaluronate sodium, and 3 % aciclovir after penetrating keratoplasty. Delayed epithelialization of the donor graft was observed at day 4 post-transplantation. Because of the concern that levofloxacin induced corneal epithelialization delay, 1. 5 % levofloxacin was changed to 0. 3 % <b>tosufloxacin.</b> At day 6 post-transplantation, deposits on the epithelial defect of the donor graft were observed. <b>Tosufloxacin</b> was suspected to {{be the cause of}} deposits, and <b>tosufloxacin</b> eye drop was discontinued. The deposits decreased gradually and completely disappeared by 5  months post-transplantation. Conclusion: Topical <b>tosufloxacin</b> treatment has the risk of precipitation on compromised corneas such as corneal grafts with epithelial defect after penetrating keratoplasty.

40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{activity}} of Q- 35, an 8 -methoxy fluoroquinolone, was {{compared with those}} of ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, <b>tosufloxacin,</b> lomefloxacin, and sparfloxacin. The MICs of Q- 35 for 90 % of strains tested (MIC 90 s) of Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes were 0. 2, 6. 25, 0. 2, 0. 39, and 0. 39 micrograms/ml, respectively. The activity of Q- 35 was 4 - to 16 -fold greater than those of ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and lomefloxacin but equal to those of <b>tosufloxacin</b> and sparfloxacin against these organisms. For 82 ciprofloxacin-resistant staphylococci (MIC 90 = 100 micrograms/ml), Q- 35 was the most active of the new quinolones tested (MIC 90 = 6. 25 micrograms/ml). The MIC 90 s of Q- 35 against Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were 0. 2, 0. 78, and 12. 5 micrograms/ml, respectively, and Q- 35 was 2 - to 16 -fold less active than the other quinolones tested.

40|$|The {{in vitro}} and in vivo {{activities}} of three newly developed quinolone antimicrobial agents (sparfloxacin, <b>tosufloxacin,</b> and OPC- 17116) were investigated. All three agents showed potent in vitro activities against Chiamydia psittaci, C. trachomatis, and C. pneumoniae with MICs {{that ranged from}} 0. 031 to 0. 125,g/ml. These values were {{higher than those of}} minocycline (0. 0075 to 0. 015 j±g/ml) but lower than those of erythromycin (0. 25 to 0. 5 ji. g/ml) and ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin (0. 5 to 1. 0 ig/ml). Mice were challenged with 105 inclusion-forming units of C. psittaci each by nasal instillation. All untreated control animals died within 7 days. The survival rates of mice treated with 40 mg of sparfloxacin, OPC- 17116, or <b>tosufloxacin</b> per kg of body weight every 12 h for 7 days were 73, 73, and 60 %o, respectively, 7 days after the challenge. The survval rate of mice treated with ofloxacin at the same dosage was 53 %. On the basis of the above results, we concluded that these three new quinolones might be useful in the treatment of chlamydial respiratory infections. Sparfloxacin (SPFX), OPC- 17116 (OPC), and <b>tosufloxacin</b> (TFLX) are three newly developed quinolone antimicrobial agents characterized by potent and broad antibacterial ac-tivities. They have been reported to show potent in vitro activities not only against common gram-positive and-neg-ative bacteria but also against mycoplasmal, mycobacterial, and chlamydial species, and they may be considered drugs of first choice for the treatment of respiratory tract infections. In this study, we investigated the in vitro activities of these agents against three chlamydial species and compared them with those of other antimicrobial agents. Most previous studies have been concerned with genitourinary tract infec-tions caused by Chlamydia trachomatis. We also studied the in vivo therapeutic effects of these compounds using a mouse experimental model of C. psittaci-caused pneumonia...|$|E

40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{activity}} of the new fluoroquinolone CP- 99, 219 [7 -(3 -azabicyclo[3. 1. 0]hexyl) naphthyridone] was {{compared with those of}} four other quinolones against 541 gram-negative, 283 gram-positive, and 70 anaerobic bacterial isolates. CP- 99, 219 inhibited 90 % of many isolates in the family Enterobacteriaceae at a concentration of 16 micrograms/ml. Streptococci were inhibited by < or = 0. 25 micrograms/ml, an activity comparable to that of <b>tosufloxacin.</b> CP- 99, 219 was eight times more active than ciprofloxacin against Streptococcus pneumoniae. Bacteroides species were inhibited by CP- 99, 219 at a concentration of 2 micrograms/ml, whereas inhibition of these species required 4 - and 16 -microgram/ml concentrations of <b>tosufloxacin</b> and ciprofloxacin, respectively. The MBCs of CP- 99, 219 ranged from two to four times the MICs, and inoculum size had a minimal effect on MIC. CP- 99, 219 was active against P. aeruginosa at pH 5. 5, with only a fourfold increase in MIC compared with values obtained at pH 7. 5. The addition of up to 9 mM Mg(2 +) increased the MIC range from 0. 03 to 0. 06 microgram/ml to 0. 12 to 0. 5 microgram/ml. In view of its excellent in vitro activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, CP- 99, 219 merits further study to determine it's clinical pharmacologic properties and potential for therapeutic use...|$|E
40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{antibacterial}} activity of DU- 6859 a, a new fluoroquinolone, against {{a wide variety}} of clinical isolates was evaluated and compared with those of <b>tosufloxacin,</b> ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and sparfloxacin. DU- 6859 a showed potent broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic bacte-ria, and its activity was greater than those of the control quinolones. By comparison of MICs at which 90 % of strains are inhibited, DU- 6859 a had potent activity against bacteria resistant to the control quinolones. The time-killing curves of quinolones showed that the number of viable cells decreased rapidly during 2 to 4 h of incubation, and regrowth was not seen even after 8 h of incubation. At a concentration of four times the MIC, the frequencies of appearance of spontaneous mutants of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudo-monas aeruginosa resistant to DU- 6859 a were % 4. 0 3 1029 to 1. 9 3 1028. The 50 % inhibitory concentrations of DU- 6859 a were 0. 86 and 1. 05 mg/ml for the supercoiling activities of DNA gyrases isolated from E. coli and P. aeruginosa, respectively. The rank order of the 50 % inhibitory concentrations observed for both DNA gyrases roughly paralleled the MICs.

40|$|The {{in vitro}} and in vivo {{activities}} of CS- 940, a new 6 -fluoro- 8 -difluoromethoxy quinolone, {{were compared with}} those of ciprofloxacin, <b>tosufloxacin,</b> sparfloxacin, and levofloxacin. The in vitro activity of CS- 940 against gram-positive bacteria was nearly equal to or greater than those of the other quinolones tested. In particular, CS- 940 was two to eight times more active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus than the other quinolones, at the MIC at which 90 % of the clinical isolates are inhibited. Against gram-negative bacteria, the activity of CS- 940 was comparable to or greater than those of <b>tosufloxacin,</b> sparfloxacin, and levofloxacin, while it was lower than that of ciprofloxacin. The activity of CS- 940 was largely unaffected by medium, inoculum size, or the addition of horse serum, but it was decreased under acidic conditions, as was also seen with the other quinolones tested. CS- 940 showed potent bactericidal activity against S. aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In oral treatment of mouse systemic infections caused by S. aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, and P. aeruginosa, CS- 940 was more effective than ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin, and levofloxacin against all strains tested. Against experimental pneumonia with K. pneumoniae in mice, CS- 940 was the most effective of all the quinolones tested. These results suggest that CS- 940 may be effective in the therapy of various bacterial infections...|$|E
