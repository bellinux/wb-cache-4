5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s and early 1970s, {{financial}} crisis gripped the New York City {{government and the}} troubles spread to the city's institutions, including NYU. Feeling the pressures of imminent bankruptcy, NYU President James McNaughton Hester negotiated <b>the</b> <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> University Heights campus to the City University of New York, which occurred in 1973. In 1973, the New York University School of Engineering and Science merged into Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn, which eventually merged into NYU in 2014 forming the present Tandon School of Engineering. After <b>the</b> <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bronx campus, University College merged with Washington Square College. In the 1980s, {{under the leadership of}} President John Brademas, NYU launched a billion-dollar campaign that was spent almost entirely on updating facilities. The campaign was set to complete in 15 years, but ended up being completed in 10. In 2003 President John Sexton launched a $2.5 billion campaign for funds to be spent especially on faculty and financial aid resources.|$|E

Shortly after <b>the</b> <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> paper, staff at the Blade sought a vote to unionize {{with the help of}} the Washington-Baltimore Newspaper Guild.

5|$|After {{winning the}} bidding, TETCO raised {{the money to}} pay the {{government}} through a combination of bonds and share issues. A further government enquiry was required before the sale was allowed to go through, which was complicated by the reluctance of the state of Pennsylvania to allow the pipelines to be used to pump gas east through its territory. The government of Pennsylvania was influenced by the coal industry, who feared they would lose sales, but it eventually relented and <b>the</b> <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pipelines to TETCO was finally completed on November 1. The value of the company soared, and the original investors saw the value of their holdings increase 63-fold.|$|E

5|$|Claimants {{from the}} line of Moana Wahine made {{petitions}} to the court under the act of 1874 to quite land titles.

By December 1879 disbursement of land in trust with William Cooper Parke, (Marshal of Hawaii from 1853 to 1884) and owned by heirs, could not be agreed upon for settlement. Most supported <b>the</b> <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lands, so an order was made and all land sold at auction.|$|E

5|$|Editorials by AlterNet, The Montreal Gazette, The Wall Street Journal, The Guardian, and The New York Times {{have accused}} Wilders of {{hypocrisy}} given that, in their view, Wilders {{has called for}} the ban of <b>the</b> <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Quran while simultaneously arguing for his own personal freedom of speech. In a speech during a Dutch parliamentary debate, Wilders elaborated that he calls for the consistent application of Dutch laws restricting any act of expression that incites violence. Ideally, he would prefer to see nearly all such laws abolished. As such, he supports a European-wide constitutional protection {{of freedom of speech}} like that which exists in the United States.|$|E
5|$|In 1941, WOR's {{official}} city of license {{was changed}} to New York. Within two years, the Colonial Network's affiliate roster and shares in Mutual had been fully absorbed into the Yankee Network by John Shepard III; WNAC was the sole flagship, WAAB having been moved to Worcester, in central Massachusetts, to avoid duopoly restrictions. With WBZ taking over the slot as the NBC Red affiliate in Boston, WNAC switched to Mutual. In January 1943, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved <b>the</b> <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Yankee Network—with WNAC, its three other owned-and-operated stations, its contracts with 17 additional affiliates, and its Mutual shares—to the Ohio-based General Tire and Rubber Company.|$|E

The Securities and Exchange Commission launched a major investigation {{of the company and}} charged Lindner, Keating and others with having defrauded investors and filing false SEC reports. At particular issue was a $14 million loan that the SEC said was made on preferential terms.

Ostensibly, Rooney had provided assistance to Bell by rewarding him with a 20% commission on <b>the</b> <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Steelers.
