Significant varietal and or salinity treatment effects were registered on plant height, leaf area, plant growth, yield, dry matter plant- 1, Na+ and Cl- accumulation in <b>tomato</b> tissues. Variety BARI <b>Tomato</b> 14, BARI Hybrid <b>Tomato</b> 5 and BARI <b>Tomato</b> 2 consistently showed superior biological activity at moderate salinity (4. 1 - 8. 0 dS m- 1), based on dry matter biomass production thus displaying relatively greater adaptation to salinity.

40|$|As expected, {{noticeable}} depolymerization {{of highly}} esterified pectin (DE, 80 %) catalyzed by <b>tomato</b> polygalacturonase was observed when active <b>tomato</b> pectinmethylesterase was present, {{which was not}} the case in absence of <b>tomato</b> pectinmethylesterase. Besides, an increase in polygalacturonase activity was observed up to an optimal pressure level (100 - 20 OMPa) depending on the temperature under study. Only at higher pressures, the rate of enzymatic pectin depolymerization diminished. In presence of active <b>tomato</b> polygalacturonase a higher <b>tomato</b> pectinmethylesterase activity was observed than in absence of <b>tomato</b> polygalacturonase at atmospheric pressure. The pectinmethylesterase catalyzed pectin deesterification accelerates by increasing pressure up to 200 MPa in presence of <b>tomato</b> polygalacturonase. Higher pressures diminished the <b>tomato</b> pectinmethylesterase activity becoming even lower as compared to atmospheric pressure, which is in contrast with the pectinmethylesterase activity studies performed in absence of <b>tomato</b> polygalacturonase. In general, <b>tomato</b> polygalacturonase activity was influenced indirectly by the presence of active <b>tomato</b> pectinmethylesterase and vice versa during thermal and high-pressure treatment. The combination of 40 degrees C and 400 MPa represents an optimal condition to preserve or improve theological properties of <b>tomato</b> based products, because at this condition <b>tomato</b> polygalacturonase activity is reduced while pectinmethylesterase activity is maintained.

50|$|<b>Tomato</b> hornworms {{are known}} to eat various plants from the family Solanaceae, {{commonly}} feeding on <b>tomato,</b> eggplant, pepper, tobacco, moonflowers and potato. Accordingly, they are often found on defoliated <b>tomato</b> plants, the caterpillar clinging to the underside of a branch near the trunk. They are difficult to spot due to their green coloration. <b>Tomato</b> hornworms fluoresce differently from <b>tomato</b> leaves. Using an ultraviolet light source of 375 nm and viewed behind a blue-blocking filter (yellow or amber filter), a <b>tomato</b> hornworm fluoresces in bright green while a <b>tomato</b> leaf appears deep red/amber.
