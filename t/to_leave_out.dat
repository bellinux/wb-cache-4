Jaidev tells Sandhya about his life in Kolkata. Jaidev tells Sandhya that he made it look like that Paparayudu solved the problems of village.

5|$|Carrie {{had told}} me in an earlier writing {{appointment}} that she was expecting this album to have darker tones than any of her earlier records. So I remember sitting at the piano while writing the song thinking that if Carrie really wanted something dark, this was what she was after. Carrie really got into the story and making sure we didn't give away how the two women {{got rid of the}} man the song is about. This kind of song is really tricky because you need enough detail to tell the story and keep it interesting without it becoming so graphic that it's unpleasant to listen to more than once. I think we managed to pull that off. Either way, it was certainly fun choosing which elements of the story to put in and which ones <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E

For example, they have discovered that Cantor was advised <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>out</b> his uncountability theorem in the article he submitted; he added it during proofreading. They have traced this and other facts about the article to the influence of Karl Weierstrass and Leopold Kronecker. Historians have also studied Dedekind's contributions to the article, including his contributions to the theorem on the countability of the real algebraic numbers. In addition, they have looked at the article's legacy—namely, the impact of the uncountability theorem and the concept of countability on mathematics.|$|E
25|$|With the BLRC now {{halfway through}} the door, Britain sent a team to the Tour de France in 1955. It was the first team ever sent since the {{previous}} riders, Bill Burl and Charles Holland had competed as private entrants before the war. To turn down the Tour was something the NCU wouldn't do and yet it couldn't select riders who were BLRC members. <b>To</b> <b>leave</b> <b>out</b> BLRC members, however, would be to send a weakened team and antagonise a wavering UCI. Yet the BLRC could not select a team because the Union Cycliste Internationale didn't formally recognise it. The conundrum was solved by asking a panel of newspaper reporters {{to do the job}} instead.|$|E
25|$|Apart from England, Pakistan is {{the only}} other top-eight Test-playing nation not to be {{represented}} in the tournament. In February 2010, Ijaz Butt, {{the chairman of the}} Pakistan Cricket Board, had reportedly refused participation in the tournament due to the snubbing of Pakistani cricketers in the 2010 Indian Premier League player auction. The auction resulted in none of them being bought for the league. Butt later stated his comments were misunderstood, but the Champions League administrators had already decided <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>out</b> Pakistan due to Butt's statements. Champions League officials have made contradicting statements as to whether a Pakistan team would have been considered regardless of Butt's statement. Pakistan was also absent from the previous edition due to the deterioration of relations between host nation India and Pakistan.|$|E

25|$|All {{processes}} in organisms obey physical laws, the difference from inanimate processes lying in their organisation and their being subject to control by coded information. This {{has led some}} biologists and philosophers (for example, Ernst Mayr and David Hull) {{to return to the}} strictly philosophical reflections of Charles Darwin to resolve some of the problems which confronted them when they tried to employ a philosophy of science derived from classical physics. This latter, positivist approach emphasised a strict determinism (as opposed to high probability) and to the discovery of universally applicable laws, testable in the course of experiment. It was difficult for biology, beyond a basic microbiological level, to live up to these structures. Standard philosophy of science seemed <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>out</b> a lot of what characterised living organisms - namely, a historical component {{in the form of an}} inherited genotype.|$|E
25|$|By {{multiplying}} these modules into a grid, {{the structure}} could be extended virtually infinitely. In its original form, the ground {{level of the}} Crystal Palace (in plan) measured 1848' x 456', which equates to a grid 77 modules long by 19 modules wide. Because each module was self-supporting, Paxton was able <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>out</b> modules in some areas, creating larger square or rectangular spaces within the building to accommodate larger exhibits. On the lower level these larger spaces were covered by the floor above, and on the upper level by longer spans of roofing, but the dimensions of these larger spaces were always multiples of the basic 24' x 24' grid unit. The modules were also strong enough to be stacked vertically, enabling Paxton to add an upper floor that nearly doubled the amount of available exhibition space. Paxton also used longer trellis girders to create a clear span for {{the roof of the}} immense central gallery, which was 72 feet wide and 1800 feet long.|$|E
25|$|A good map has to {{compromise}} between portraying the items of interest (or themes) {{in the right}} place on the map, and the need to show that item using text or a symbol, which take up space on the map and might displace some other item of information. The cartographer is thus constantly making judgements about what to include, what <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>out</b> and what to show in a slightly incorrect place. This issue assumes more importance as the scale of the map gets smaller (i.e. the map shows a larger area) because the information shown on the map takes up more space on the ground. A good example from the late 1980s was the Ordnance Survey's first digital maps, where the absolute positions of major roads were sometimes a scale distance of hundreds of metres away from ground truth, when shown on digital maps at scales of 1:250,000 and 1:625,000, because of the overriding need to annotate the features.|$|E

25|$|The furore over World Series Cricket {{had led the}} ACB {{to refuse}} to {{consider}} for selection to the national team any Australian player that had signed up to WSC. The West Indies Cricket Board took a different view, and chose a number of their players from those signed to the Kerry Packer organisation {{for the first two}} games. This led to the West Indies easily beating the tourists to take a 2–0 lead in the series. However, in the lead up to the 3rd Test in Guyana, the WICB made a decision <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>out</b> three of their WSC contracted players, ostensibly to allow others a chance to play in test matches prior to the West Indies' tour to India and Sri Lanka later in the year, which would be at a time that World Series Cricket could not guarantee the availability of their West Indian players. The non-selection of these three players led to the resignation of Clive Lloyd as captain, and all of the WSC contracted West Indian players to declare themselves unavailable {{for the rest of the}} series. Australia won the 3rd Test, but lost the 4th. Australia were on track to win the 5th Test but the crowd rioted and the game had to be called off early.|$|E
25|$|Rhodes and Cordingley were {{competing}} {{for a place}} in the Yorkshire team after the sacking of Bobby Peel in 1897. Cordingley was, at that stage, as well qualified for the position as Rhodes and had good reports from his time playing with Lytham. In a trial match {{at the end of the}} 1897 season, Cordingley took eight wickets for 33 runs for Yorkshire against the Yorkshire Colts team, and also took three wickets against the senior Yorkshire side in another game. In the same games, Rhodes took just two wickets for 99 runs. At the start of the 1898 season, both Cordingley and Rhodes played for Yorkshire Colts against Nottinghamshire Colts; Rhodes took one wicket for 14 and Cordingley took four for 37. Two days later, both men were included in the squad for Yorkshire against the Marylebone Cricket Club (M.C.C.). According to one story, Yorkshire captain Lord Hawke and leading amateur cricketer Stanley Jackson could not agree on which player <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>out,</b> and chose Rhodes after spinning a coin. However, Hawke later denied this was the case. He claimed always to believe Rhodes the better bowler and said that Jackson came to the same view after seeing Rhodes bowling during practice. Rhodes took six for 33 in the game and was chosen to play in the next match, but Cordingley remained in the squad. However, during the game he received news of the death of his mother and returned home. Rhodes meanwhile took 13 wickets in the game and Cordingley accepted that there was no likelihood of taking his place. This gave rise to a legend that after seeing Rhodes bowl in his first match, Cordingley, accepting Rhodes' superiority, shook his hand and returned home without completing the team's tour of the South of England. Rhodes remained in the side for the rest of the season and took 141 wickets for Yorkshire. He was named one of Wisden's Cricketers of the Year and played for England the following season. He went on to take 4,184 wickets in a career lasting until 1930.|$|E
