40|$|For {{the public}} health worker {{the history of the}} control of Aedes aegypti-borne {{diseases}} offers a very sobering lesson. Our forebears were considerably more successful and, let's face the truth, more competent in the management and prosecution of a <b>technical</b> <b>control</b> <b>service</b> than we. All this competence is in the relatively recent past. Brazil, which had experienced recurrent severe epidemics of yellow fever, proposed to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) in 1947 that it undertake a campaign to eradicate Aedes aegypti from the Western Hemisphere (1). Dr. Fred L. Soper, during the period of this eradication campaign, was the PAHO Director. During the 1930 's Soper, as a Foundation officer, had inadvertently discovered that a highly organized program to find and destroy aegypti larval breeding sites could reduce premises indices to zero (2). The addition of specially qualified teams designated to find "hidden foci " of breeding were responsible for eradicating Aedes aegypti in Brazil. This was before the discovery of DDT, and when oil, Paris Green, the pyrethrins and sulfur smoke were the only available larvicides or adulticides. Certainly, the conditions for breeding mosquitoes in urban areas in the era of th...|$|R
40|$|To {{cope with}} the {{continuous}} requests to introduce more systems to be monitored by the <b>Technical</b> <b>Control</b> Room (TCR), {{and to keep the}} existing systems' data up to date, the <b>Technical</b> <b>Control</b> Desk (TCD) <b>service</b> was created at the end of 1999. The TCD offers a single point of entry to all CERN users who are responsible for systems monitored by the TCR, so that they may establish a request for changes. The TCD consists of a set of procedures to be followed by users and TCR operators and a set of computer based tools to record and manage the requests. The TCR pledges to reply to all requests made to the TCD within 48 hrs. The implementation of changes in monitored systems involves a number of different activities from cabling, database modifications, and finally testing. The precise details of the changes requested and the activities impacted are recorded by the TCD so that both users and the TCR operators may view the progress of implementation throughout all stages...|$|R

The Special <b>Control</b> <b>Service</b> was {{not a part of}} the 12th GU MO from very beginning, but was formerly a part of the GRU, its 6th Directorate’s department of special observation. However, it was later detached from the GRU and made an independent Special Observation Service of the Defense Ministry. Then it was renamed into a Special <b>Control</b> <b>Service</b> and re-subordinated first to the Directorate of the Commander of the Chemical Troops (the analogue of a standard ABC service in the Soviet Army), and then again re-subordinated to the 12th GU MO.|$|R

40|$|Water {{shortage}} is {{a global}} problem, which requires a global solution. Desalination technologies, whether thermal or membrane processes, are having practical limitations, which result in high operating and capital costs. The thermal desalination process, namely Multi-Stage Flash (M. S. F.) distillation, {{is still the most}} commonly used distillation method, especially in the Middle East. However, the MSF units are generally large-scale and very sophisticated, which require expertise to perform regular <b>technical</b> <b>control</b> and <b>servicing.</b> The aim of the present study is the development of a cost-effective with easy operation distillation system, to satisfy the basic water needs in remote areas in developing countries. A novel small scale three-stage compact distillation system has been designed, constructed, installed and commissioned in a pilot plant study at the University of Surrey. The study involved both theoretical experimental investigations as well as economical analysis. An extensive experimental programme were carried to study the effect of a number of parameters including increasing the heat input, heater temperature and the number of chambers (stages) on the distillate rate as well as the water product cost. The results have shown that: Increasing the number of chambers, heat input and heater temperature have lead to improvement in both the distillate and the production rate; Increasing the number of chambers has increased both the capital and running costs but reduced the specific energy consumption, as well as the unit cost of the produced water; The water production cost decreased by about 13. 0 % and 28. 0 % when the numbers of chambers were increased to two and three chambers respectively, The integration of the system with solar energy source is expected to provide a lower energy cost, which would reduce the final product cost. While the water production cost is estimated to be increased when the system integrated with the fossil fuel as energy source due to increase the oil price during the year of this study...|$|R

It takes examples from the UK government to argue that it is no longer possible to just rely on <b>technical</b> <b>controls</b> while securing electronic government transactions. Reports and studies reflect that illicit acts such as cybercrime are predominantly the result of not only disregard for basic information security and but also lack of awareness about the importance of social issues associated with information technology. Consequently, focusing on the <b>technical</b> <b>controls</b> provides only a partial solution while managing cybercrime particularly in electronic government context. 1...|$|R

Introductory material is presented on the Landing Force Integrated Communications System (LFICS) and associated methods of communications system control- The decision problem is stated as a needed choice between alternatives in both near term (1987 - 1990) and long term (1991 +) eras of service. Examined are the <b>technical</b> <b>control</b> functional requirements for both the transitional near term and the eventual long term digital systems. The study raises issues on the automation of <b>technical</b> <b>control</b> {{in the development of}} a systems engineering functional description of an "ideal" facility. Consideration is given to the many other service and industrial solutions in the formulation of twelve alternative approaches to the total solution of communications <b>technical</b> <b>control</b> in the near and long term- A gualitative, ordinal valued, multicriteria decision theory model is applied to the selection between these alternatives as opposed to a more quantitative cost and operational effectiveness analysis (COEA) study approach. The decision model is fully developed for this application and for general future use by the interested reader. Conclusions and recommendations are made based on analysis of the modeling results.
