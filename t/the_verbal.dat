5|$|Innovations in Ottawa {{morphology}} {{contribute to}} differentiating Ottawa from other dialects of Ojibwe. These differences include: the reanalysis of person prefixes and word stems; {{the loss of}} final /-n/ in certain inflectional suffixes; a distinctive form for <b>the</b> <b>verbal</b> suffix indicating doubt; and a distinctive form for <b>the</b> <b>verbal</b> suffix indicating plurality on intransitive verbs with grammatically inanimate subjects.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>verbal</b> prefix {{contains}} {{information about}} the person and number of the subject, sometimes also the person and number of the object, as well as obligatory {{information about the}} tense of the clause. Furthermore, a verbal suffix conveys further information regarding tense and aspect. While {{only a small number}} of tense and aspect affixes exist, the interplay between those in <b>the</b> <b>verbal</b> prefix and in the suffix, can generate more highly specified temporal and aspectual clauses.|$|E
5|$|There are {{personal}} pronouns for first-, second-, and third-person singular and plural. These pronouns are optional {{as subjects}} or objects, {{but only when}} <b>the</b> <b>verbal</b> inflection refers to such arguments.|$|E

5|$|Bradley {{began playing}} {{basketball}} {{at the age}} of nine. He was a star at Crystal City High School, where he scored 3,068 points in his scholastic career, was twice named All-American, and was elected to the Missouri Association of Student Councils. He received 75 college scholarship offers, although he applied to only five schools and only scored a 485 out of 800 on <b>the</b> <b>Verbal</b> portion of the SAT, which—despite being likely in the top third of all test takers that year—normally would have caused selective schools like Princeton University to reject him.|$|E

Among admitted students, the median Quebec CEGEP R-score was 30.0, while the median grade 12 averages for students entering McGill from outside of Quebec ranged between 92% and 93% (A). For American students, the median SAT scores in <b>the</b> <b>verbal,</b> mathematics, and writing sections were 700, 690, and 710 respectively, for a combined SAT score of around 2100; the median ACT score was 31.|$|E
5|$|Mayan {{languages}} {{tend to have}} a rich set of grammatical voices. Proto-Mayan had {{at least}} one passive construction as well as an antipassive rule for downplaying the importance of the agent in relation to the patient. Modern K'iche' has two antipassives: one which ascribes focus to the object and another that emphasizes <b>the</b> <b>verbal</b> action. Other voice-related constructions occurring in Mayan languages are the following: mediopassive, incorporational (incorporating a direct object into the verb), instrumental (promoting the instrument to object position) and referential (a kind of applicative promoting an indirect argument such as a benefactive or recipient to the object position).|$|E

5|$|Mongolian has vowel {{harmony and}} a complex syllabic {{structure}} for a Mongolic language that allows clusters {{of up to}} three consonants syllable-finally. It is a typical agglutinative language that relies on suffix chains in <b>the</b> <b>verbal</b> and nominal domains. While there is a basic word order, subject–object–predicate, ordering among noun phrases is relatively free, so grammatical roles are indicated by a system of about eight grammatical cases. There are five voices. Verbs are marked for voice, aspect, tense, and epistemic modality/evidentiality. In sentence linking, a special role is played by converbs.|$|E
5|$|Alexandre Baudrimont's 40-page study Vocabulaire de la langue des Bohémiens habitant {{les pays}} basques français of 1862, the most {{extensive}} of the early accounts, covers both vocabulary and aspects of grammar. He worked with two female informants, {{a mother and her}} daughter from the Uhart-Mixe area near Saint-Palais, whom he describes as highly fluent. Unfortunately, he was only able to conduct a single session as the women were then told not to cooperate further for the fear of outsiders prying into the secrets of the Romani. There is a certain degree of confusion in Baudrimont's publication—he himself states that he could not always be certain the correct forms were elicited. For example, most of the verb forms he tried to elicit lack <b>the</b> <b>verbal</b> -tu ending and appear to be participles.|$|E
5|$|Timby et al. (2014) also {{assessed}} {{the potential impact}} of MFGM supplementation on cognitive development in term infants. In this double-blind RCT, term infants (<2 months old) were fed until 6 months of age either a control formula (n=64) or an MFGM-supplemented formula (n=71). A breastfed reference group (n=70) was also included. Cognitive assessment done using the BSID-III at 12 months of age showed that the MFGM-fed infants exhibited significantly higher mean cognitive scores than the control group (105.8 vs 101.8; P<0.008), and not significantly different from the breastfed reference group. In contrast, {{there were no significant differences}} in motor domain scores between the three groups, and both experimental and control formula groups scored lower than the reference group in <b>the</b> <b>verbal</b> domain.|$|E
