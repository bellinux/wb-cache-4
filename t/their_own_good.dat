Apparently Michael was displeased with the final form of the treaty negotiated by his envoys, but was forced to comply. Prince Michael said in a conversation with the Polish envoy Lubieniecki: …they did not proceed as stated in their instructions but as <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>good</b> required and obtained privileges for themselves. He would try to avoid the obligations imposed on him {{for the rest of his}} reign.|$|E
25|$|Eventually, the Doctor {{began to}} enjoy his travels through time and space, taking people {{along for the}} ride and was always {{reluctant}} and sad to see them go, even when he knew it was for <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>good.</b> The Doctor's personality mellowed {{around the time of the}} serial Marco Polo, and he evolved into the more familiar grandfatherly figure that children loved.|$|E
25|$|Carl Jung {{rejected}} many of Freud's theories. Jung expanded on Freud's {{idea that}} dream content {{relates to the}} dreamer's unconscious desires. He described dreams as messages to the dreamer and argued that dreamers should pay attention for <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>good.</b> He {{came to believe that}} dreams present the dreamer with revelations that can uncover and help to resolve emotional or religious problems and fears.|$|E

Päts, Westel and other big businessmen, mostly members of Päts's Farmers' Unions party, have thus been accused to use this {{transaction}} money for <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>good.</b> It has also been claimed that the Bank of Estonia gave out several loans to enterprises that were related to Päts's activities and almost all other loans were given to enterprises related {{to the members of}} the bank's own council and other top-level politicians. Having big loans was also the reason why Päts, Westel and other top-level politicians did not fight with the hyperinflation at the time.|$|E
25|$|Cleckley {{writes in}} the fifth edition that he remains, since before the first edition, profoundly struck both {{by the lack of}} {{response}} to treatment of those he classes as psychopathic, and by the legal difficulty of trying to detain them in hospital. While noting the issue of the protection of liberty, he argues that better ways must be found to do the latter for <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>good</b> and that of society, on the primary basis of demonstrated disability and need, perhaps within psychiatric units but segregated from other patients. He notes that neither psychological therapy or physical methods such as shock therapy or lobotomy appear to be a real solution to the problem, but suggests that more opportunity to control and direct the person may help psychiatrists treat them in the long-run. He also considers the issue of competency hearings and the insanity defense when crimes are committed. He expresses concern that his prior equating of psychopathy with psychosis was not intended to imply that psychopaths should be automatically found not guilty. However he also expresses dissatisfaction with sending psychopaths to prison which he believes will inevitably fail to correct the behaviour due to the underlying abnormality or masked 'insanity'.|$|E

5000|$|At {{the time}} of its founding, grocery stores did not allow their {{customers}} to gather <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>goods.</b> Instead, a customer would give a list of items to a clerk, who would then go through the store himself, gathering them. This created a greater cost, therefore higher prices. Piggly Wiggly introduced the innovation of allowing customers to go through the store, gathering <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>goods.</b> This cut costs, allowing for lower prices. Others were initially experimenting with this format as well, which initially {{came to be known as}} a [...] "grocerteria", reminding people of cafeterias, another relatively new, self-service idea.|$|R

500|$|After Great Britain {{lost the}} American colonies, a second {{generation}} of Scottish intellectuals saved Britain from stagnation and reinforced a self-confidence that allowed the country to manage a world empire during the Victorian era. Scots in India, like James Mill, led the British idea of 'liberal' imperialism, {{that they had to}} take over indigenous cultures and run their society for <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>good,</b> the white-nationalist euphemism [...] "the white man's burden". Herman claims that Sir Walter Scott invented the historical novel, giving modernity a [...] "self-conscious antidote", and gave literature a [...] "place as part of modern life".|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} mostly well {{received}} by critics. Blogcritics reviewer Aaraon Peck applauded the Perry and Doofenshmirtz B-Plot, considering it {{as both the}} official Pret episode and {{an example of the}} series' ability to allow [...] "adults [...] enjoy the humor" [...] and not strictly focusing on the entertainment of younger viewers. Conversely, Ed Liu of Toon Zone was critical of the episode and other early episodes available on The Fast and the Phineas, calling them [...] "way too manic for <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>good,</b> never giving a gag enough time to develop a proper laugh before ripping off to the next one, and refusing to sit still for any length of time." [...] The production staff reacted positively to the episode, and said that they [...] "really liked" [...] its outcome.|$|E
500|$|Her {{attitude}} and language often sharply polarized debate, and made Dworkin herself {{a figure of}} intense controversy. After her death, the conservative gay writer Andrew Sullivan claimed that [...] "Many on the social right liked Andrea Dworkin. Like Dworkin, their essential impulse when they see human beings living freely {{is to try and}} control or stop them [...] for <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>good.</b> Like Dworkin, they are horrified by male sexuality, and see men as such as a problem to be tamed. Like Dworkin, they believe {{in the power of the}} state to censor and coerce sexual freedoms. Like Dworkin, they view the enormous new freedom that women and gay people have acquired since the 1960s as a terrible development for human culture." [...] Libertarian/conservative journalist Cathy Young complained of a [...] "whitewash" [...] in feminist obituaries for Dworkin, argued that Dworkin's positions were manifestly misandrist, stated that Dworkin was in fact insane, criticized what she called Dworkin's [...] "destructive legacy", and described Dworkin as a [...] "sad ghost" [...] that feminism needs to exorcise.|$|E

This practice was tolerated when the company was profitable, but by the 1780s the company's finances were not in good shape. Cornwallis eliminated the practice, increasing employee salaries in compensation. He also worked to reduce nepotism and political favouritism, instituting the practice of merit-based advancement.|$|R

The bourgeoisie developed a hegemonic culture, which propagated its own values and norms so that they became the [...] "common sense" [...] values of all.
