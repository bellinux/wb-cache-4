5|$|Church {{belief in}} {{the resurrection of the}} body led to a {{prohibition}} against cremation that was pastorally modified at the Second Vatican Council in the 1960s under limited circumstances, but <b>those</b> <b>conditions</b> have been largely ignored even by the clergy. According to the Catechism, burial of the dead is a corporal work of mercy that must treat the body with respect and love (e.g. scattering of cremated remains, burial in an unmarked grave, etc. are forbidden in the Catholic Church). Organ donation after death and organ transplants under certain terms, also autopsies for legal and scientific reasons are permitted.|$|E
5|$|In the book, Lamarck named two {{supposed}} {{laws that}} would enable animal species to acquire characteristics {{under the influence of}} the environment. The first law stated that use or disuse would cause body structures to grow or shrink over the generations. The second law asserted that such changes would be inherited. <b>Those</b> <b>conditions</b> together imply that species continuously change by adaptation to their environments, forming a branching series of evolutionary paths.|$|E

5|$|Khrushchev founded several {{academic}} towns, such as Akademgorodok. The premier {{believed that}} Western science flourished because many scientists lived in university {{towns such as}} Oxford, isolated from big city distractions, and had pleasant living conditions and good pay. He sought to duplicate <b>those</b> <b>conditions</b> in the Soviet Union. Khrushchev's attempt was generally successful, though his new towns and scientific centers tended to attract younger scientists, with older ones unwilling to leave Moscow or Leningrad.|$|E
5|$|The {{treatment}} of Tourette's focuses on identifying {{and helping the}} individual manage the most troubling or impairing symptoms. Most cases of Tourette's are mild, and do not require pharmacological treatment; instead, psychobehavioral therapy, education, and reassurance may be sufficient. Treatments, where warranted, {{can be divided into}} those that target tics and comorbid conditions, which, when present, are often a larger source of impairment than the tics themselves. Not all people with tics have comorbid conditions, but when <b>those</b> <b>conditions</b> are present, they often take treatment priority.|$|E
5|$|The {{vegetation}} of Strandzha evolved {{before the}} formation of the Bosphorus Strait when the whole southern Black Sea coast was linked and represents the westernmost extension of the Euxine-Colchic ecoregion. Because of the proximity of three seas, the Black Sea, the Marmara Sea and the Aegean Sea, Strandzha remained unaffected by the Quaternary glaciation and retained its mild and relatively humid climate. Under <b>those</b> <b>conditions</b> the region has preserved relict species from the Neogene.|$|E

5|$|B.epica {{is fairly}} new to cultivation. Kevin Collins of the Banksia Farm in Albany, Western Australia {{is said to}} have pioneered its cultivation, growing it in loamy clay or sandy gravel. It showed good {{tolerance}} for alkaline soils in <b>those</b> <b>conditions,</b> and has also succeeded in sandy, alkaline soil near the coast between Mandurah and Kwinana. The Australian National Botanic Gardens in Canberra has also had some success in cultivating the species. Seeds were sown in February 1996, and planted out in November 1997; seedlings planted into sections without good drainage died, but two seedlings that were planted into a section with excellent drainage were about a metre tall by 2002, and flowering prolifically.|$|E
5|$|The Ju 88s arrived {{over the}} target at Kenley {{to find a}} smoke pall hanging over the target. It was {{impossible}} to begin dive-bombing attacks under <b>those</b> <b>conditions.</b> Given the amount of damage to Kenley, it also seemed unnecessary to the bomber crews. As they were deciding what action to take, they were attacked. The Bf 109s led by Hannes Trautloft had a difficult job of defending the Ju 88s. After passing Biggin Hill {{on their way to}} RAF West Malling British AAA fire began targeting the formation. One Ju 88 was hit, and Trautloft gave it special protection. As he manoeuvred himself into position, the formation was jumped by Spitfires and Hurricanes. One Ju 88 was lost to 32 Squadron's Pilot Officer Bolesław Własnowolski. As they attack began, the Ju 88s turned to West Malling, and began dive-bombing attacks as an alternate target.|$|E

40|$|We {{compared}} {{the extent of}} temporary threshold shift (TTS) and hair cell loss following high level 4 kHz noise exposure with those preconditioned with moderate level 1 and 4 kHz octave band noise. Fifteen Male albino guinea pigs (300 - 350 g in weight) were randomly allocated into three groups: those exposed to 4 kHz octave band noise at 102 dB SPL (group 1, n= 5); <b>those</b> <b>conditioned</b> with 1 kHz octave band noise at 85 dB SPL, 6 hours per day for 5 days, then exposed to noise (group 2, n= 5); <b>those</b> <b>conditioned</b> with 4 kHz octave band noise at 85 dB SPL, then exposed to noise (group 3, n= 5). An hour and one week after noise exposure, threshold shifts were evaluated by auditory-evoked brainstem response (ABR) and then animals were euthanized for histological evaluation. We found that TTS and cochlear damage caused by noise exposure were significantly reduced by 1 kHz and 4 kHz conditioning (P< 0. 001). We also showed that 4 kHz protocol attenuates noise- induced TTS but no significant TTS reduction occurred by 1 kHz conditioning. Both protocol protected noise-induced cochlear damage. We concluded that lower tone conditioning could not protect against higher tone temporary noise-induced hearing loss, thus conditioning is a local acting and frequency-dependent phenomenon...|$|R

30|$|Some {{properties}} of wood (hinoki:Chamaecyparis obtusa) moisture-conditioned by an adsorption process from a dry state and by two desorption processes (from a water-saturated state {{and from a}} state with a moisture content slightly below the fiber saturation point) were investigated. The moisture contents of wood conditioned by the adsorption process and by the desorption process continued to approach to one another for the moisture-conditioning period of over 50 weeks. Accordingly, sorption hysteresis {{should be regarded as}} a transitional phenomenon that occurs during the process of approaching the true equilibrium, which requires a long time. The wood conditioned by the desorption process beginning from a water-saturated state showed slightly smaller dimensions than <b>those</b> <b>conditioned</b> by the adsorption process with the same moisture content; however, the wood conditioned by the desorption process from a moisture content below the fiber saturation point showed slightly larger dimensions than <b>those</b> <b>conditioned</b> by the adsorption process. The wood conditioned by the adsorption process from a dry state showed a higher modulus of elasticity and modulus of rupture than did the wood conditioned from a water-saturated state with the same moisture content. The mechanical {{properties of}} the wood also varied based on the states at which the desorption process was started. This is a notable characteristic of the relation between the drying condition and the mechanical properties of wood.|$|R
