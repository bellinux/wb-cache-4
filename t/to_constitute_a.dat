5|$|Each team {{consists}} of a maximum of eleven players (excluding substitutes), one of whom must be the goalkeeper. Competition rules may state a minimum number of players required <b>to</b> <b>constitute</b> <b>a</b> team, which is usually seven. Goalkeepers are the only players allowed to play the ball with their hands or arms, provided they do so within the penalty area {{in front of their}} own goal. Though {{there are a variety of}} positions in which the outfield (non-goalkeeper) players are strategically placed by a coach, these positions are not defined or required by the Laws.|$|E

To cope with the problem, President Calvin Coolidge in 1924 authorized the transfer from the Navy to the Coast Guard of twenty old destroyers that were in reserve and out of commission. Ericsson was activated and acquired by the Coast Guard on 7 June 1924.|$|E

5|$|In Quenya, the {{stressing}} of a syllable is {{predictable and}} non-phonemic (i.e. {{the meaning of}} a word never changes depending on the stress), but it is partly determined by syllable weight. Words of two syllables are stressed on the first syllable. In words of three or more syllables, the stress is on the penultimate syllable if this is heavy, otherwise on the antepenultimate syllable, i.e. the third-to-last syllable. In Quenya, heavy syllables are syllables that contain either a long vowel, a diphthong, or a cluster of two consonants (ll, ld, mm, ss, etc.). Certain combinations of consonants, e.g. ny, ry, are also regarded as heavy. Medially hy and hw are long consonants in Parmaquesta (not colloquially in Tarquesta) and a vowel before them is held <b>to</b> <b>constitute</b> <b>a</b> metrically long syllable. Quenya has also a secondary accent. The placement of stress and the distinction between heavy and light syllables is important in Quenya verse.|$|E

5|$|Kohala had two active rift zones, a {{characteristic}} common to Hawaiian volcanoes. The double ridge, shaped axially, {{was active in}} both the shield and postshield stages. The southeast rift zone passes under the nearby Mauna Kea and reappears further southeast in the Hilo Ridge, {{as indicated by the}} relationship between collected lava samples. In addition, the two features align to one another more closely then does the ridge to Mauna Kea, of which it was once thought <b>to</b> <b>constitute</b> <b>a</b> part. The bulk of the ridge is built of volcanic rock with reverse magnetic polarity, evidence that the volcano is at least 780,000years old. Older lava dated from the toe of the ridge was estimated to be roughly between 1.1 and 1.2million years old.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{component}} of the Fleet was its battleships, typically organized in eight-ship squadrons, though it also contained various other formations, including the I Scouting Group. At its creation in 1907, the High Seas Fleet consisted of two squadrons of battleships, and by 1914, a third squadron had been added. The dreadnought revolution in 1906 greatly affected {{the composition of the}} fleet; the twenty-four pre-dreadnoughts in the fleet were rendered obsolete and required replacement. Enough dreadnoughts for two full squadrons were completed by the outbreak of war in mid 1914; the eight most modern pre-dreadnoughts were used <b>to</b> <b>constitute</b> <b>a</b> third squadron. Two additional squadrons of older vessels were mobilized at the onset of hostilities, though {{by the end of the}} conflict, these formations were disbanded.|$|E
5|$|The {{rational}} nexus test {{does not}} apply where a statute treats all persons equally, but it is alleged that the authorities have applied the statute in a discriminatory manner. Instead, a modified rational nexus test is used, which requires a court to consider {{whether there is a}} reasonable nexus between the state action taken and the object of the law. Such a nexus will be absent if the action amounts to intentional and arbitrary discrimination or intentional systematic discrimination. It is insufficient if any inequality is due to inadvertence or inefficiency, unless this occurs on a very substantial scale. In addition, inequalities arising from a reasonable administrative policy or which are mere errors of judgment are insufficient <b>to</b> <b>constitute</b> <b>a</b> violation of Article 12(1).|$|E
