5|$|As the {{blizzard}} progressed, Patrick Dolan began to rant deliriously, stripped off his clothes, {{and ran into}} the woods. He returned shortly afterwards and died a few hours later. Not long after, possibly because 12-year-old Lemuel Murphy was near death, some of the group began <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> flesh from Dolan's body. Lemuel's sister tried to feed some to her brother, but he died shortly afterwards. Eddy, Salvador, and Luis refused <b>to</b> <b>eat.</b> The next morning, the group stripped the muscle and organs from the bodies of Antonio, Dolan, Graves, and Murphy and dried it to store for the days ahead, taking care to ensure that nobody would have <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> his or her relatives.|$|E

Brock refuses <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> human brains; the symbiote abandons him, and he is locked in an asylum under the care of the deranged Dr. Paine. Brock escapes to hunt the symbiote, which has gone on a killing spree to obtain brains.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the role of parental factors and {{individual}} ego development in identifying an at-risk profile for eating disordered behavior among female emerging adults. Specifically, this study was designed to test the hypotheses that parent eating attitudes and behavior and parenting style are correlated phenomena associated with a self-reported proclivity for eating disordered behavior among female offspring with individual ego development level as either a protective or exacerbating factor. Previous research with parental factors and eating disorders does not address a comprehensive model that utilizes the multiple parental variables of parent eating attitudes and behavior and parenting style, and young adult ego development. It was predicted that those at risk for developing an eating disorder would report experiencing their parents 2 ̆ 7 style as high in control and low in warmth or low in control and high in warmth, parents will report a higher incidence of personal eating disordered behaviors and attitudes, and the student 2 ̆ 7 s level of ego development will mediate the impact of these parental factors. A total of 131 mother-daughter dyads were used for this project. There were significant correlations found between daughters 2 ̆ 7 approach <b>to</b> <b>eating</b> and mothers 2 ̆ 7 approach <b>to</b> <b>eating</b> and mothers 2 ̆ 7 parenting style. However, there was no relationship between ego development and any of the predictor variables or daughters 2 ̆ 7 approach <b>to</b> <b>eating,</b> precluding ego development as a mediator. Ego development also did not emerge as a moderator in an alternative model. Additionally, only mothers 2 ̆ 7 approach <b>to</b> <b>eating</b> continued <b>to</b> be a significant predictor of daughters 2 ̆ 7 approach <b>to</b> <b>eating</b> when factoring out impact on daughters 2 ̆ 7 personal well-being. Mothers 2 ̆ 7 parenting style was found to not be a significant predictor of daughters 2 ̆ 7 approach <b>to</b> <b>eating</b> once personal well-being was factored out as a covariate. These results support the impact of mothers 2 ̆ 7 approach <b>to</b> <b>eating,</b> but more research needs to be conducted in examining the relationship between parenting style, ego development, and daughters 2 ̆ 7 approach <b>to</b> <b>eating...</b>|$|R
