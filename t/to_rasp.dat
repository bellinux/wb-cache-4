5|$|In the {{majority}} of species of caecilians, the young are produced by vivipary. Typhlonectes compressicauda, a species from South America, is typical of these. Up to nine larvae can develop in the oviduct at any one time. They are elongated and have paired sac-like gills, small eyes and specialised scraping teeth. At first, they feed on the yolks of the eggs, but as this source of nourishment declines they begin <b>to</b> <b>rasp</b> at the ciliated epithelial cells that line the oviduct. This stimulates the secretion of fluids rich in lipids and mucoproteins on which they feed along with scrapings from the oviduct wall. They may increase their length sixfold and be two-fifths {{as long as their}} mother before being born. By this time they have undergone metamorphosis, lost their eyes and gills, developed a thicker skin and mouth tentacles, and reabsorbed their teeth. A permanent set of teeth grow through soon after birth.|$|E
500|$|Most male crickets make a loud {{chirping}} sound by stridulation. The stridulatory organ {{is located}} on the tegmen, or fore wing, which is leathery in texture. A large vein runs along the centre of each tegmen, with comb-like serrations on its edge forming a file-like structure, and at the rear edge of the tegmen is a scraper. The tegmina are held at an angle to the body and rhythmically raised and lowered which causes the scraper on one wing <b>to</b> <b>rasp</b> on the file on the other. The central part of the tegmen contains the [...] "harp", an area of thick, sclerotinized membrane which resonates and amplifies the volume of sound, as does the pocket of air between the tegmina and the body wall. Most female crickets lack the necessary adaptations to stridulate, so make no sound.|$|E

50|$|Floats {{are similar}} <b>to</b> <b>rasps</b> and files. Rasps are {{generally}} coarse and cannot be resharpened. Files have angled ridges or teeth and cannot be resharpened. Floats have parallel teeth {{and they can}} be resharpened as many times as the thickness of the blade will allow.|$|R
50|$|A {{herbivore}} is {{an animal}} anatomically and physiologically adapted to eating plant material, for example foliage, {{for the main}} component of its diet. As a result of their plant diet, herbivorous animals typically have mouthparts adapted <b>to</b> <b>rasping</b> or grinding. Horses and other herbivores have wide flat teeth that are adapted to grinding grass, tree bark, and other tough plant material.|$|R

5000|$|Most species occur {{along the}} coastal {{fringes of the}} lake at depths less than 3 m. These rocky shores, with {{numerous}} rocky outcroppings and boulder formations, form a habitat similar {{to many of the}} mbuna cichlids of Lake Malawi. This habitat provides shelter, and due to the shallow depth and the long hours of strong sunlight, heavy algal growth on which they feed. The only Tropheus species to dwell further out and deeper in the lake is Tropheus duboisi, which in general inhabits deeper regions of the lake down to around 15-20 m. All species are algal grazers and have underslung mouths adapted <b>to</b> <b>rasping</b> algae and microinvertebrates from submerged rocks.|$|R

60|$|A bitter frost {{had crept}} {{down from the}} snow-clad heights that shut the cañon in, and {{the roar of the}} river had fallen to a lower tone, when Nasmyth stood one morning {{shivering}} close by the door of his rude log shanty {{at the foot of the}} gully. The faint grey light was growing slightly clearer, and he could see the clustering spruces, in the hollow, gleam spectrally where their dark masses were streaked with delicate silver filigree. Across the river there was a dull glimmer from the wall of rock, which the freezing spray had covered with a glassy crust. Though it had not been long exposed to the nipping morning air, Nasmyth felt his damp deer-hide jacket slowly stiffening, and the edge of the sleeves, which had been wet through the day before, commenced <b>to</b> <b>rasp</b> his raw and swollen wrists.|$|E

60|$|As he sauntered along {{he kicked}} the stones {{out of his}} way savagely, and {{appeared}} to find relief to his feelings in so doing, as well as by allowing his sword <b>to</b> <b>rasp</b> across the rocks and shrubs at his side. It might have been observed, however, that Glumm only kicked the little stones {{out of his way}}; he never kicked the big ones. It is interesting to observe how trifling a matter will bring out a trait of human nature! Men will sometimes relieve their angry feelings by storming violently at those of their fellows who cannot hurt them, but, strangely enough, they manage to obtain relief to these same feelings without storming, when they chance to be in the company of stronger men than themselves, thereby proving that they have powers of self-restraint which prudence-- not to say fear--can call into exercise! commend this moral reflection particularly to the study of boys.|$|E

The old Squire seemed anxious to be alone, and he restlessly escaped from Marcia's care. He sat all the first day apart, chewing upon some fragment of wood that he had picked up, and now and then putting up a lank hand <b>to</b> <b>rasp</b> his bristling jaw; glancing furtively at people who passed him, and lapsing into his ruminant abstraction. He had been vexed {{that they did not}} start the night before; and every halt the train made visibly afflicted him. He would not leave his place to get anything to eat when they stopped for refreshment, though he hungrily devoured the lunch that Marcia brought into the car for him. At New York he was in a tumult of fear lest they should lose the connecting train on the Pennsylvania Road; and the sigh of relief with which he sank into his seat in the sleeping-car expressed the suffering he had undergone. He said he was not tired, but he went to bed early, as if to sleep away as much of the time as he could.|$|E

5000|$|According to Sputnik Music, [...] "The {{songs on}} the album are awesome, {{there really is no}} other way to put it. This album is nothing but {{fourteen}} songs of pure crossover thrash, stripped down so that you experience the full brutality of The Curse Of Martha Splatterhead. Each song is propelled along by Tommy Niemeyer’s riffs which go from thrash to hardcore to punk with ease and he even slips in the odd sloppy solo which works superbly in the context of these songs. Most songs are clearly thrash, although they have a punky sound to them as well. Niemeyer is backed up by Dorando Hodous on bass and Mike Peterson on drums, who just keep adding to this deadly combination. With a new vocalist as well, known only as Brad Mowen, his performance on the album is superb. He goes from yells, <b>to</b> <b>rasps</b> that all fit in perfectly with each song. The main lyrical theme of most songs include zombies, gore and society." ...|$|R

40|$|It is argued, {{following}} Francois Sigaut, {{that the}} way elements of technology are invented, borrowed and re-combined challenges the notion of 'technical lineage'. with its implication of 'successive orderly accretions'. The contention is examined in relation to pith removal equipment used in palm starch extraction in island southeast Asia and Melanesia, which is considered additionally instructive because it yields some potential archaeological traces. The key archaeotypes - pounding and rasping tools - reflect convergent and secondary technologies that most likely were adapted to sago processing from other cultural domains. Pounders are found mainly {{in the eastern part}} of the geographic range, and rasps in the west. There is much variability in the distribution of types, even within a small area. Inferences are drawn relating to recent changes (for example, from stone to metal working edges, and from pounders <b>to</b> <b>rasps),</b> and concerning what we can learn from the distribution of different kinds of tool, including the likelihood of versions of the same tool co-existing in the same place, or being independently invented at opposite ends of the archipelago...|$|R
50|$|Once {{the general}} shape is made, the carver may {{use a variety}} of tools for {{creating}} details. For example, a “veiner” or “fluter” {{can be used to make}} deep gouges into the surface, or a “v-tool” for making fine lines or decorative cuts. Once the finer details have been added, the wood carver finishes the surface. The method chosen depends on the required quality of surface finish. The texture left by shallow gouges gives 'life' to the carving's surface and many carvers prefer this 'tooled' finish. If a completely smooth surface is required general smoothing can be done with tools such as “rasps,” which are flat-bladed tools with a surface of pointed teeth. “Rifflers” are similar <b>to</b> <b>rasps,</b> but smaller, usually double ended, and of various shapes for working in folds or crevasses. The finer polishing is done with abrasive paper. Large grained paper with a rougher surface is used first, with the sculptor then using finer grained paper that can make the surface of the sculpture slick to the touch.|$|R

50|$|Another {{adaptation}} in parasitic females is {{that their}} first legs are armed with heavy, blade-like spines, and in some species the joints also are fused, stiffening them and increasing their effectiveness for harvesting host tissue.

50|$|Many {{aquatic animals}} feed {{extensively}} on aufwuchs. The mbuna cichlids from Lake Malawi are particularly well known examples of fish adapted for feeding on aufwuchs. Examples include Labeotropheus trewavasae and Pseudotropheus zebra. They have scraper-like teeth {{that allow them}} <b>to</b> <b>rasp</b> the aufwuchs from rocks.
