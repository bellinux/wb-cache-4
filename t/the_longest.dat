40|$|This paper {{contains}} an empirical {{analysis of the}} dependence of <b>the</b> <b>long</b> forward-rate slope on the long-rate variance. <b>The</b> <b>long</b> forward-rate slope and <b>the</b> <b>long</b> rate are described by a bivariate GARCH-in-mean model.

Thus, the greater the long-rate variance, <b>the</b> steeper <b>the</b> <b>long</b> forward-rate curve slopes downward (<b>the</b> <b>long</b> forward-rate slope is negative).
