40|$|The {{acquisition}} of nutrients requires tight regulation to ensure optimal supply while preventing accumulation to <b>toxic</b> <b>levels.</b> <b>Ammonium</b> transporter/methylamine permease/rhesus (AMT/Mep/Rh) transporters {{are responsible for}} ammonium acquisition in bacteria, fungi, and plants. The ammonium transporter AMT 1; 1 from Arabidopsis thaliana uses a novel regulatory mechanism requiring the productive interaction between a trimer of subunits for function. Allosteric regulation is mediated by a cytosolic C-terminal trans-activation domain, which carries a conserved Thr (T 460) in a critical position in the hinge region of the C terminus. When expressed in yeast, mutation of T 460 leads to inactivation of the trimeric complex. This study shows that phosphorylation of T 460 is triggered by ammonium in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Neither Gln nor l-methionine sulfoximine–induced ammonium accumulation were effective in inducing phosphorylation, suggesting that roots use either the ammonium transporter itself or another extracellular sensor to measure ammonium concentrations in the rhizosphere. Phosphorylation of T 460 {{in response to an}} increase in external ammonium correlates with inhibition of ammonium uptake into Arabidopsis roots. Thus, phosphorylation appears to function in a feedback loop restricting ammonium uptake. This novel autoregulatory mechanism is capable of tuning uptake capacity over a wide range of supply levels using an extracellular sensory system, potentially mediated by a transceptor (i. e., transporter and receptor) ...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION. Elevated <b>ammonium</b> <b>levels</b> (EAL) {{are one of}} {{the side}} effects of valproic acid (VPA) treatment. This {{complication}} has been described during long-term VPA treatment, but less in critically ill patients. OBJECTIVES. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the incidence and the factors associated with EAL in those patients. METHODS. A retrospective study in a mixed 35 -bed ICU care of a tertiary university hospital was conducted over a 4 -year period (2007 - 2010). Inclusion criteria were; a) VPA therapy for more than 72 hours; b) age > 18 years; c) at least one measurement of <b>ammonium</b> <b>levels</b> during the ICU stay; d) Child C liver cirrhosis. EAL was defined as <b>ammonium</b> <b>levels</b> above 50 mcg/dL. Demographic data, comorbidities, reason for VPA treatment, biological data, concomitant therapies, presence of infection and ICU mortality were collected. RESULTS. A total of 168 patients met the inclusion criteria (median age 64 years, 95 male gender). Most of them (137 / 168) were admitted for neurological reasons. Overall ICU mortality was 23 %. Median <b>ammonium</b> <b>levels</b> were 88 [55 - 121] mcg/dL. EAL was found in 121 (72 %) patients; of those, 38 (31 %) had <b>ammonium</b> <b>levels</b> between 100 - 150 mcg/dL, 11 (9 %) between 150 - 200 mcg/dL and 13 (11 %) above 250 mcg/dL. Median time from start of VPA therapy to EAL was 4 [3 - 5] days. Median maximum VPA level during therapy was 72 [51 - 88] and was significantly higher in EAL patients than in the others (76 [58 - 92] mcg/mL vs. 56 [39 - 81] mcg/mL, p< 0. 01). EAL were more frequently observed in patients with sepsis (p< 0. 01) and in those treated with mechanical ventilation (p< 0. 01), vasopressors (p= 0. 05) and at least one other antiepileptic drug (p= 0. 02); these patients tended to have a higher ICU mortality (28 % vs. 13 %, p = 0. 06). CONCLUSIONS. <b>Ammonium</b> <b>levels</b> are often elevated during treatment with valproic acid in ICU patients, especially in those with the greatest severity.

40|$|EDITORIAL SYNOPSIS The {{evidence}} presented here favours {{the possibility that}} gastric ammonium is produced from the urea in the blood through the action of a non-bacterial gastric urease. It also originates from blood ammonium which is transferred from blood into the gastric juice, the amount depending upon {{the level of the}} blood ammonium and the pH gradient between blood and gastric juice and the state of gastric secretion. <b>Ammonium</b> <b>levels</b> in gastric juice are higher than those in blood. The concentrations of ammonium in gastric juice are measured in hundreds of micro-grams (,ug.) to milligrams (mg.) per 100 ml. (Korn-berg and Davies, 1955; FitzGerald and Murphy, 1950; Mossberg, Thayer, and Spiro, 1963; Rappo-port and Kern, 1963) whereas blood <b>ammonium</b> <b>levels</b> normally are less than 100,ug%. (Gabuzda, 1962). That gastric juice ammonium is derived from blood urea nitrogen through the action of gastric urease has been generally accepted, although whether the urease is bacterial or non-bacterial in origin remains unsettled (Kornberg and Davies, 1955; Conway, FitzGerald, McGeeney, and Geoghegan, 1959; Bessman and Stauffer, 1957). However, several observations are difficult to reconcile with the concept that gastric juice ammonium is derived from blood urea nitrogen. For example, wide ranges of values for gastric juice <b>ammonium</b> <b>levels</b> have been reported in human subjects and in animals with normal blood urea levels (Kornberg and Davies, 1955; Mossberg et al., 1963; Rappoport and Kern, 1963).

Based on its Rf, the violet pigment was PP-V isolated from fresh medium after replacing 10  mM glutamine medium (Fig.  3 b). Furthermore, the intracellular <b>ammonium</b> <b>level</b> after replacing medium decreased.

30|$|Previously, we {{revealed}} that when not only inorganic nitrogen {{but also some}} amino acids are added, a violet pigment was produced, and that pigment produced on glutamine was determined as PP-V by NMR (Arai et al. 2013). Further, we showed that PP-V productivity reduced by inhibiting glutamine synthetase (GS) and that glutamine was preferred for this pigment production than glutamate (Arai et al. 2013). These results suggested that ammonium generated through glutamine degradation by glutaminase after ammonium assimilation is used for component of PP-V (Arai et al. 2013). Hence, we considered that intracellular <b>ammonium</b> <b>level</b> is important in PP-V production. In this study, we investigated the effect of intracellular <b>ammonium</b> <b>level</b> on pigment production using glutamine as nitrogen source.|$|R

40|$|The {{removal of}} excess {{nutrients}} from water ecosystems requires oxidation of <b>toxic</b> <b>ammonium</b> by {{two types of}} bacteria; one oxidizes ammonium to nitrite and the other oxidizes nitrite to nitrate. The oxidation of ammonium is often incomplete and nitrite accumulates. Nitrite is also toxic, and is converted by the ammoniumoxidizing bacteria to nitrous oxide, a powerful greenhouse gas. Here we use mathematical modeling to analyze a potential solution to the problems related to incomplete oxidation of ammonium. We propose that a single engineered nitrifying bacterium should be capable of complete oxidation of high concentrations of ammonium to nitrate. Our model is based on available data on ammonium- and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria. The model predicts that insertion of highly expressed genes of a nitrite oxidation system into the genome of an ammonia-oxidation bacterium should result in complete oxidation of ammonium to nitrate in nutrient-overloaded conditions. Due to its increased capacity to fully oxidize ammonium to nitrate, the proposed bacterium would display dramatically reduced production of nitrous oxide, and therefore might have great potential to reduce the greenhouse effect of nutrient-overloaded water system...|$|R
40|$|A loss of soil {{organic matter}} (SOM), whether through natural means or {{management}} practices, results in soil degradation. Biochar as a soil amendment can alter soil properties, ultimately affecting the availability of nitrogen and water to plants and thus crop growth. The effects of biochar are not definitive, and often dependent on both the soil type and the biochar applied. Biochar properties can change according to the feedstock and production parameters, thus for their effective use further investigation is required to link biochar properties to its effects in soil. A high-temperature (600 ˚ C) biochar from a mixed-hardwood feedstock was investigated. The biochar increased the soil water retention, as demonstrated by a water release curve and field trials. This retention was predominant at higher water potentials, which was attributed to the greater number of meso (storage) pores in the biochar. Biochar {{did not affect the}} soil’s saturated hydraulic conductivity; this is thought to be due to the low number of macro (transmission) pores in the biochar. Thus there was no effect on the transmission rate in the soil. Biochar reduced gross <b>ammonium</b> <b>levels</b> in the soil via adsorption, but resulted in increased non-exchangeable <b>ammonium</b> <b>levels,</b> possibly due to physical entrapment. Where carbon was already abundant in the organically managed soil, the adsorbed ammonium reduced nitrification through lower substrate availability. The range of carbon fractions added {{as a result of the}} biochar amendment increased the total organic carbon (TOC) content of the soil, but this supplementary carbon was released by the microorganisms as carbon dioxide. Microorganisms in the relatively carbon poor conventionally managed soil (with lower TOC), assimilated the additional labile carbon increasing microbial biomass. The higher microbial biomass, combined with improvements in pH and the higher <b>ammonium</b> <b>levels</b> (as a result of the ammoniacal fertiliser) increased nitrification. These changes in water and nitrogen availability did not alter crop yields as measured in the glasshouse and field trials. The effects of this biochar in a sandy agricultural soil depended on the type and level of carbon and nitrogen present in the soil, thus consideration of these factors should be taken when applying...|$|R

40|$|Water {{samples were}} {{collected}} from Vilnius drinking water distribution system fed by treated and different groundwater. Parameters related to bacterial growth have been measured considering these samples: temperature, concentration of free residual chlorine, ammonium, nitrates and nitrites. Results showed that treated groundwater was less susceptible to favour bacterial growth in the pipelines. The obtained results also showed that the potential growth induced by the distribution of treated water could be reduced if: <b>ammonium</b> <b>levels</b> were below 0. 5  mg/l at the outlet of the water treatment plant; biological ammonium removal treatment implementation should reduce the levels of the nitrates and nitrites of the treated supplied water.   Article in Lithuanian </div...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of ammonium availability on bacterial community {{structure and the}} physiological status of Geobacter species during in situ bioremediation of uranium-contaminated groundwater was evaluated. Ammonium concentrations varied by 2 orders of magnitude (< 4 to 400 ?M) across the study site. Analysis of 16 S rRNA sequences suggested that ammonium {{may have been one}} factor influencing the community composition prior to acetate amendment with Rhodoferax species predominating over Geobacter species with higher ammonium and Dechloromonas species dominating at the site with lowest ammonium. However, once acetate was added and dissimilatory metal reduction was stimulated, Geobacter species became the predominant organisms at all locations. Rates of U(VI) reduction appeared to be more related to acetate concentrations rather than <b>ammonium</b> <b>levels.</b> In situ mRNA transcript abundance of the nitrogen fixation gene, nifD, and the ammonium transporter gene, amtB, in Geobacter species indicated that ammonium was the primary source of nitrogen during uranium reduction. The abundance of amtB was inversely correlated to <b>ammonium</b> <b>levels,</b> whereas nifD transcript levels were similar across all sites examined. These results suggest that nifD and amtB expression are closely regulated in response to ammonium availability to ensure an adequate supply of nitrogen while conserving cell resources. Thus, quantifying nifD and amtB transcript expression appears to be a useful approach for monitoring the nitrogen-related physiological status of subsurface Geobacter species. This study also emphasizes the need for more detailed analysis of geochemical and physiological interactions at the field scale in order to adequately model subsurface microbial processes during bioremediation...|$|R
