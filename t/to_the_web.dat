40|$|Several {{authors have}} studied {{convergence}} in distribution <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Brownian <b>web</b> under diffusive scaling of Markovian random walks. In a paper by R. Roy, K. Saha and A.

Paths in the Random Directed Forest do not cross each other before coalescence.

25|$|With the Web being a huge {{reservoir}} {{of data and}} resources, language scientists and technologists are increasingly turning <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>web</b> for language data.

25|$|Because markup languages, {{and more}} {{generally}} data description languages (not necessarily textual markup), are not programming languages (they are data without instructions), {{they are more}} easily manipulated than programming languages—for example, web pages are presented as HTML documents, not C code, and thus can be embedded within other web pages, displayed when only partially received, and so forth. This leads <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>web</b> design principle {{of the rule of}} least power, which advocates using the least (computationally) powerful language that satisfies a task to facilitate such manipulation and reuse.|$|E
