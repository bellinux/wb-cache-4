500|$|The {{authors of}} the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called it [...] "one of the most dismally unfunny episodes ever, lifted only by the brief {{appearance}} of a talking camel and Homer's clever way of getting Cooder and Spud out of his home. Whereas most of the series' politically incorrect moments are funny and well-observed, this episode seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> fairground folk and travelers really are deeply unpleasant criminals who are both irredeemable and unworthy of help. Nasty-taste-in-the-mouth time." [...] Despite the negative review from I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Isaac Mitchell-Frey of the Herald Sun described the episode as [...] "brilliant", and highlighted it along with episodes [...] "The Trouble with Trillions" [...] and [...] "The Joy of Sect" [...] {{and it has been}} described by the other Simpsons writers in the DVD audio commentary as [...] "criminally underrated".|$|E
2500|$|He {{followed}} this {{up with the}} sequel to The Born Losers, Billy Jack, in 1971. American International Pictures initially agreed to distribute the picture but after viewing it the studio refused to release the film unless many of the political references – as well as frontal nudity – were cut. This led the Laughlins to withhold the sound reels of the movie, which in effect made it a silent film. Eventually, Laughlin made a distribution deal with Warner Bros. but he disapproved of the studio's marketing of the film, sued Warners, and re-released the picture himself. The movie's re-release was successful but controversial. Roger Ebert, in his review of the film, wrote, [...] "Billy Jack seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> a gun {{is better than a}} constitution in the enforcement of justice. Is democracy totally obsolete, then? Is our only hope that the good fascists defeat the bad fascists?" ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{a bout of}} activity, he {{left for}} America in December 1879 with John Dillon {{to raise funds for}} famine relief and secure support for Home Rule. Timothy Healy {{followed}} to cope with the press and they collected £70,000 for distress in Ireland. During Parnell's highly successful tour, he had an audience with American President Rutherford B. Hayes, on 2 February 1880 he addressed the House of Representatives on the state of Ireland and spoke in 62 cities including in Canada, where he was so well received in Toronto that Healy dubbed him [...] "the uncrowned king of Ireland". (The same term was applied 30 years earlier to Daniel O'Connell.) He strove to retain Fenian support but insisted when asked by a reporter that he personally could not join a secret society. Central to his whole approach to politics was ambiguity in that he allowed his hearers to remain uncertain. During his tour, he seemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> there were virtually no limits. To abolish landlordism, he asserted, would be to undermine English misgovernment, and he is alleged to have added: ...|$|E
2500|$|The Court appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> LGE simply {{licensed}} Intel to make, use, {{and sell}} microprocessor products. LGE expressly stated that no license was granted to any third party for combining licensed products with other products; and LGE made Intel tell its customers about {{the absence of}} a license. But LGE did not say to Intel that LGE licensed Intel to make, use, and sell microprocessor products only in the field of microprocessor products combined with other LGE-licensed products (so-called Intel products). There was no explicit field-of-use limitation on Intel’s manufacturing, using, and selling rights––no “magic words.” [...] LGE came close––it said it was not licensing third parties to combine licensed product with other products, and it required Intel to notify customers of that––but LGE failed to go right to the point and expressly deny Intel any license to make microprocessor products that would be combined with other products. Furthermore, for some inexplicable reason the parties, with fatal effect, red-flagged the fact that there still was an exhaustion doctrine: “Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the parties agree that nothing herein shall in any way limit or alter the effect of patent exhaustion that would otherwise apply when a party hereto sells any of its Licensed Products.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1978, King {{returned}} to his alma mater, the University of Maine at Orono, to teach for {{a year as a}} gesture of gratitude for the education he had received there. During this time his family rented a house on a busy road in Orrington. The road claimed the lives of a number of pets, and the neighborhood children had created a pet cemetery in a field near the Kings' home. King's daughter Naomi buried her cat [...] "Smucky" [...] there after it was hit, and shortly thereafter their son Owen had a close call running toward the road. King wrote the novel based on their experiences, but feeling he had gone too far with {{the subject matter of the}} book, he discarded the idea of having it published, particularly since both his wife Tabitha and friend Peter Straub agreed Pet Sematary was too dark and unenjoyable. However, needing a final book for his contract King reluctantly submitted it to Doubleday on the advice of his wife Tabitha. The subsequent success of the book made King note how both Americans and British readers liked it despite him considering Pet Sematary too bleak in how [...] "it just spirals down into darkness. It seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> nothing works and nothing is worth it, and I don’t really believe that.” ...|$|E

It was his situation, by no fault of his own, that was fantastic, and he {{was only trying to}} be natural. He watched me put away the letter, and when it had disappeared gave a soft sigh of relief. The sigh was natural, and yet it set me thinking. His general recoil from an immediate responsibility imposed by others might be wholesome enough; but if there was an old grievance on one side, was there not possibly a new-born delusion on the other? It would be unkind to withhold a reflection that might serve as a warning; so I told him, abruptly, that I had been an undiscovered spectator, the night before, of his exploits at roulette.|$|E

5000|$|McGee’s answer <b>to</b> this <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> “political {{language}} which manifests ideology seems {{characterized by}} slogans, a vocabulary of ‘ideographs’ easily mistaken for the technical terminology of political philosophy.” [...] He {{goes on to}} offer his definition of “ideograph”: “an ideograph is an ordinary-language term found in political discourse.

50|$|The {{question}} then arises {{of the possibility}} of reconciling externalism with holism. The one seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> meanings are determined by the external relations (with society or the world), while the other suggests that meaning is determined by the relation of words (or beliefs) to all the other words (or beliefs). Frederik Stjernfelt identifies at least three possible ways to reconcile them and then points out some objections.|$|E
50|$|After {{eight years}} of production, the film's initial release was stormy. Many people were upset {{by the idea that}} the villains in the story were not just the Nazis but their British collaborators. The film seemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> fascism can rise {{anywhere}} under the right circumstances, and that people everywhere could fall under its spell. Research prior to the film from various Nazi-occupied territories (including the Channel Islands) suggested that this was indeed the case.|$|E
50|$|Another {{theme of}} the novel, though not {{unrelated}} to the first, is 'the issue of resistance versus collaboration'. Beauvoir seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> to not actively resist the German occupation is in effect to accept it. This, argues David E. Cooper, is an illustration of an existentialist view {{of the nature of}} freedom, according to which an individual is just as responsible for not refusing something as for choosing it. Any distinction between choosing and not refusing is elided.|$|E

50|$|Bimal K. Matilal (1990) {{has tried}} to unify these views - he feels that for Bhartṛhari the very process of {{thinking}} involves vibrations, so that thought has some sound-like properties. Thought operates by śabdanaor 'speaking', - so that the mechanisms of thought {{are the same as}} that of language. Indeed, Bhartṛhari seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> thought is not possible without language. This leads to a somewhat whorfian position on the relationship between language and thought. The sphoṭa then is the carrier of this thought, as a primordial vibration.|$|E
5000|$|From a Roman Catholic perspective, to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> {{all these}} irreconcilable beliefs <b>are</b> equally {{pleasing}} <b>to</b> God <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> God has no preference for truth and to deny reason. The Roman Catholic Church argues that restricted indifferentism {{is no different}} from absolute indifferentism because while nominally acknowledging the utility of religion, to affirm that [...] "all religions are equally good" [...] ultimately means that religion is good for nothing.|$|R
