5|$|Although Ibn Haukal {{reports the}} sack of Samandar by Sviatoslav, the Rus' leader {{did not bother}} to occupy the Khazar heartlands north of the Caucasus Mountains permanently. On his way back to Kiev, Sviatoslav chose to strike against the Ossetians and force them into subservience. Therefore, Khazar {{successor}} statelets continued their precarious existence in the region. The destruction of Khazar imperial power paved the way for Kievan Rus' to dominate north-south trade routes through the steppe and across the Black Sea, routes that formerly had been a major source of revenue for the Khazars. Moreover, Sviatoslav's campaigns led to increased Slavic settlement in <b>the</b> <b>region</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Saltovo-Mayaki culture, greatly changing the demographics and culture of the transitional area between the forest and the steppe.|$|E

5|$|By 1944 it {{was fairly}} routine {{practice}} for Stavka to assign its operating fronts new and more ambitious missions while the Soviet Armed Forces were conducting major offensive operations.

For the 1943/1944 winter campaign, Stalin ordered the Red Army to conduct major offensives along the entire Soviet-German front in {{a continuation of the}} 'Broad Front' strategy he had pursued {{since the beginning of the}} war. This was applied in consonance with his long-standing rationale that, if the Red Army applied pressure along the entire front, German defences were likely to break in at least one section.

In contrast, <b>the</b> extracellular <b>region</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> VLDL receptor remained intracellular {{and it did}} not bind 125 I-beta-VLDL. This difference in expression behaviour between <b>the</b> homologous <b>regions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two receptors suggests that the two receptor systems are different in receptor-protein maturation or protein targeting. Next we developed the co-expression system with 39 -kDa receptor-associated protein (RAP).

On the other hand, expression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> extracellular <b>region</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> LDL receptor was not facilitated by RAP co-expression.

5|$|The 1914 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season {{was the least}} active Atlantic {{hurricane season}} on record, with only one known tropical storm.

5|$|The clumpy {{structure}} of the dust belt {{may be explained by}} gravitational perturbation from a planet, dubbed Epsilon Eridani b.

Alternatively, the clumpiness may have been caused by collisions between minor planets known as plutinos.|$|E
