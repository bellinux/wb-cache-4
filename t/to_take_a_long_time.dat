25|$|Irenaeus' {{emphasis}} on the unity of God is reflected in his corresponding {{emphasis on}} the unity of salvation history. Irenaeus repeatedly insists that God began the world and has been overseeing it ever since this creative act; everything that has happened {{is part of his}} plan for humanity. The essence of this plan is a process of maturation: Irenaeus believes that humanity was created immature, and God intended his creatures <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> to grow into or assume the divine likeness.|$|E
25|$|Considering {{the pace}} of {{hydropower}} development in Nepal (Out of 83,000 MW potential, only 705 MW hydropower has been generated throughout the country {{till the end of}} 12th national plan viz. 2009/10-2011-12) in general and in the Karnali Basin in particular, harnessing the total hydropower potential of the Basin is envisaged <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time.</b> Based on recent water resources development planning and project progress, the likely large scale hydropower projects that will be operational in the Basin by 2025 are predicted to be: West Seti HEP (750 MW); Upper Karnali HEP (300 MW); Bheri-Babai Multipurpose Project (48 MW); and Lohore Khola HEP (58 MW).|$|E
6000|$|The {{defending}} counsel {{also was}} again brief in his cross-examination; although (as was his custom) even in being brief, he seemed <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> about it. [...] "You used a rather remarkable expression," [...] he said, looking at Cutler sleepily. [...] "What {{do you mean}} by saying that it looked more like a beast than a man or a woman?" ...|$|E
50|$|Mr Kling had and {{exercised}} a {{right of}} pre-emption entitling him <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> lease of <b>a</b> garage. At the time, {{he was just a}} licensee of the garage in Chelsea.|$|R
50|$|Paul Krugman {{noted that}} this {{assumption}} would mean that 25% unemployment {{at the height of}} the Great Depression (1933) would be the result of <b>a</b> mass decision <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> vacation.|$|R

60|$|The {{next few}} days passed without incident. Mildred settled down in her new surroundings. When Philip hurried off after breakfast she had the whole morning to do the housework. They ate very simply, but she liked <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> to buy the few things they needed; {{she could not be}} bothered to cook {{anything}} for her dinner, but made herself some cocoa and ate bread and butter; then she took the baby out in the gocart, and when she came in {{spent the rest of the}} afternoon in idleness. She was tired out, and it suited her to do so little. She made friends with Philip's forbidding landlady over the rent, which he left with Mildred to pay, and within a week was able to tell him more about his neighbours than he had learned in a year.|$|E
60|$|I followed, {{trying to}} look as subdued as possible, and feeling at the chains about my wrists. My blood was boiling. I noted nothing more of that cavern, though it seemed <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> before we had marched across it, or if I noted {{anything}} I forgot it as I saw it. My thoughts were concentrated, I think, upon my chains and the Selenites, and particularly upon the helmeted ones with the goads. At first they marched parallel with us, and at a respectful distance, but presently they were overtaken by three others, and then they drew nearer, until they were within arms length again. I winced like a beaten horse as they came near to us. The shorter, thicker Selenite marched at first on our right flank, but presently came {{in front of us}} again.|$|E
6000|$|As he {{took his}} place upon the ground there was great cheering. Then the steam-bowler was ridden into its place by the {{attendant}} engineer, and Jack began his work. I could see the colour come and go in {{his face as he}} carefully placed the ball and peeped down to get its bearing. It seemed to me as though he were taking infinite care to level it straight and even at Sir Kennington's head. I was told afterwards that he never looked at Sir Kennington, but that, having calculated his distance by means of a quicksilver levelling-glass, his object was to throw the ball on a certain inch of turf, from which it might shoot into the wicket at such a degree as to make it very difficult for Sir Kennington {{to know what to do}} with it. It seemed to me <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time,</b> during which the fourteen men around all looked as though each man were intending to hop off to some other spot than that on which he was standing. There used, I am told, to be only eleven of these men; but now, in a great match, the long-offs, and the long-ons, and the rest of them, are all doubled. The double long-off was at such a distance that, he being a small man, I could only just see him through the field-glass which I kept in my waistcoat-pocket. When I had been looking hard at them for what seemed to be a quarter of an hour, and the men were apparently becoming tired of their continual hop, and when Jack had stooped and kneeled and sprawled, with one eye shut, in every conceivable attitude, on a sudden there came a sharp snap, a little smoke, and lo, Sir Kennington Oval was--out! ...|$|E

50|$|Etymologically, {{the term}} Vesara is {{believed}} to have been derived from the Sanskrit word vishra meaning <b>an</b> area <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> walk. The quarters of Buddhist and Jain monks who left urban areas to live in cave temples were called viharas.|$|R

5000|$|Gentling {{said of the}} experience, [...] "We knew {{we wanted}} <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> on this album.

5000|$|Some loanwords {{have their}} {{spelling}} changed to reflect Norwegian pronunciation rules, {{but in general}} Norwegianised spellings of these words tend <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> to sink in: e.g. [...] (from French [...] ) and [...] (from French [...] ) are now the common Norwegian spellings, but juice is more often used than the Norwegianised form , catering more often than , service more often than , etc.|$|E
50|$|Often main {{developer}} work {{takes place}} in the trunk and stable versions are branched, and occasional bug-fixes are merged from branches to the trunk.

5000|$|The {{extension}} {{conditions of}} each use case {{provide a framework}} for investigating all the little, niggling things that somehow take up 80% of the development time and budget. It provides a look ahead mechanism, so the stakeholders can spot issues that are likely <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> to get answers for. These issues can and should then be put ahead of the schedule, so that the answers can be ready when the development team gets around to working on them.|$|E
50|$|Mubarak's ousting was {{followed}} by widespread allegations of corruption against numerous other government officials and senior politicians. These included the {{former speaker of the}} Egyptian Parliament, Fathi Sorour, and the former speaker of the higher legislative body (Shura Council), Safwat El Sherif. Trials of the accused officials started on March 5, 2011, when the former interior minister of Egypt, Habib el-Adly, appeared before the Giza Criminal Court in Cairo. The trials of el-Adly and other public figures are expected <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E

5000|$|In entomology, an egg {{sometimes}} is called unembryonated until {{it contains a}} visibly segmented embryo. An unembryonated egg might be a trophic egg, probably (but not necessarily) unfertilised or at least infertile. Such an egg will not contain a viable zygote. Alternatively, [...] "unembryonated" [...] might refer to an egg that is [...] "immature", not yet well into the process of development. These are likely <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> to hatch, as opposed to eggs that are laid partly incubated and ready to hatch soon after, or even {{at the time of}} oviposition.|$|E
50|$|The most {{prominent}} English political figure, {{to represent a}} Scottish constituency in the 18th century, was Charles James Fox. In the 1784 general election, Fox sought re-election for the Westminster constituency. Political opponents challenged Fox's election. As Westminster had the largest electorate of any English borough, the scrutiny of votes (to check that each voter had been legally qualified {{to participate in the}} election) was thought likely <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time.</b> To avoid Fox being out of Parliament, until the Westminster election petition was decided, a Scottish friend arranged for him to become member for Tain Burghs.|$|E
