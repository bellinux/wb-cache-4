5|$|After a May 23 neck surgery, Manning {{could not}} use the Colts' {{facilities}} for practice and workouts due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> lockout. Reluctant to have witnesses to his recovery, he used the Colorado Rockies baseball team's trainers at Coors Field in Denver. Manning was unable to complete his throwing motion, and his arm strength had significantly diminished. Based on an MRI, doctors told him {{in the late summer}} that he needed spinal fusion surgery and that at his age they could not guarantee his return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>NFL.</b> On September 7, the Colts officially ruled Manning out for the season opener against Houston, ending his consecutive starts streak of 208 games (227 including playoffs); the team signed Kerry Collins out of retirement and named him interim starting quarterback. After seeking other opinions, Manning had the second surgery on September 8.|$|E

McMillin's career NFL coaching mark was 14–24.|$|E

5|$|In early 1970, Rymkus {{applied for}} a job as the Browns' {{offensive}} line coach but {{did not get the}} position. Later that year, he returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> as an offensive line coach for the Baltimore Colts under Don McCafferty. After just three regular-season games, however, he was replaced by George Young and transferred to the team's scouting department. Rymkus received a championship ring that year when the Colts defeated the Dallas Cowboys in Super Bowl V.|$|E
5|$|Johnson played college {{football}} at Morris Brown College in Atlanta. In {{his last year}} at Morris Brown he had 112 tackles and 28 sacks.

5|$|Since {{it would}} {{eventually}} merge with the NFL, {{the history of}} the AFL's playoff system merits some explanation. For the 1960–68 seasons, the AFL used the two-divisional format identical <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> to determine its champion. There was no tie-breaker system in place, so ties atop the Eastern Division final standings in 1963 and Western Division in 1968 necessitated playoff games to determine each division's representative in the championship.|$|E

5|$|Adamle {{came out}} of {{retirement}} {{to play for the}} Browns at 30 years old in October 1954. He had been working as a scout for the Chicago Cardinals and was in his third year of medical school; he agreed to come back on the condition that he would only practice once a week so he could continue his studies. The Browns had advanced <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> championship game in both of the seasons he did not play, but lost both times to the Detroit Lions. In Cleveland's 1954 season, the team reached the championship game and beat the Lions, 56–10.|$|E
5|$|During its brief history, the AAFC, {{who would}} merge into the NFL for the 1950 season, used an {{identical}} playoff format <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> from 1946 to 1948. In 1949 (its last year), the AAFC would merge its two conferences {{when one of}} its teams folded, and use a four-team playoff system. In 1948, the aforementioned issue of playoff inequity came into play when the San Francisco 49ers would miss the playoffs with a 12–2 record; {{they were in the}} same conference as the 14–0 Cleveland Browns, who would go on to win the Western Conference and then the AAFC's championship game against the 7–7 Buffalo Bills (AAFC).|$|E
5|$|Following his {{retirement}} in early 1952, Rymkus accepted a position as line coach at Indiana University, where his former Notre Dame teammate Bernie Crimmins had been appointed head coach.
