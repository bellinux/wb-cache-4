The Washingtons insisted that taxes needn't be paid on the family members' income, and the case went first to the Board of Tax Appeals, and then to the Court of Appeals, which in 1927 ruled against the Washingtons by a two-to-one decision.

5|$|An {{independent}} diamond synthesis {{was achieved}} on February 16, 1953 in Stockholm by ASEA (Allmänna Svenska Elektriska Aktiebolaget), one of Sweden's major electrical manufacturing companies. Starting in 1949, ASEA employed {{a team of}} five scientists and engineers {{as part of a}} top-secret diamond-making project code-named QUINTUS. The team used a bulky split-sphere apparatus designed by Baltzar von Platen and Anders Kämpe. Pressure was maintained within the device at an estimated 8.4GPa for an hour. A few small diamonds were produced, but not of gem quality or size. The work was not reported until the 1980s. During the 1980s, a new competitor emerged in Korea, a company named Iljin Diamond; it was followed by hundreds of Chinese enterprises. Iljin Diamond allegedly accomplished diamond synthesis in 1988 by misappropriating <b>trade</b> <b>secrets</b> from GE via a Korean former GE employee.|$|E

The {{crocodile}} etc. obviously used the floor trap, but was it an illusionistically painted figure worked with sticks, or a man in a crocodile suit? There are no extant drawings or descriptions of machinery and sets for the Restoration theatre, although some documentation exists for court masques from {{the first half of the}} 17th century, notably the work of Inigo Jones and his pupil John Webb. One reason for the lack of information for the public theatres is that stage effects, and particularly machines, were <b>trade</b> <b>secrets.</b> Inventors of theatrical effects took great pains to hold on to their secrets, and the playhouses guarded their machine workings as zealously as a magician guards her or his tricks.|$|E

40|$|The {{information}} {{revolution has}} led to technological innovations in the movement, storage, and dissemination of information. The Internet allows a person, with good or bad intent, to distribute information to millions of people. This ability raises serious implications when <b>trade</b> <b>secret</b> information {{is the subject of}} Internet postings. Once a <b>trade</b> <b>secret</b> becomes publicly available, it loses its legal secrecy, and special legal protection. Additionally, competitors and everyone else on the Internet can gain access to the information. For those who rely on <b>trade</b> <b>secret</b> protection to guard their inventions, this presents a growing concern. This Note will illustrate the void in <b>trade</b> <b>secret</b> protection arising from the conflicting goals of <b>trade</b> <b>secret</b> law and the First Amendment. This void has allowed third parties to post <b>trade</b> <b>secret</b> information, often procured through inappropriate means or in violation of a duty to maintain secrecy. Part II of the Note sets out the basic frameworks of <b>trade</b> <b>secret</b> and First Amendment law as they apply in these circumstances. Part III examines both sides of this conflict, including the means of resolution used in cases like Ford Motor Co. v. Lane. Part IV explains why injunctive relief should be permitted in <b>trade</b> <b>secret</b> cases when a third party has obtained information from an employee, in violation of a duty of confidentiality. This Note concludes that, because of the gap that has emerged in <b>trade</b> <b>secret</b> protection, courts should begin to allow <b>trade</b> <b>secret</b> owners injunctive relief. This relief will mitigate damages when third parties have, through inappropriate means or an employee 2 ̆ 7 s wrongful disclosures, obtained confidential <b>trade</b> <b>secret</b> information...|$|R

Initially this lawsuit was about breach of {{contract}} and <b>trade</b> <b>secrets.</b> Later, SCO dropped the <b>trade</b> <b>secrets</b> claim, so the claim is breach of contract. SCO also added a copyright claim related to IBM's continued use of AIX, but not related to Linux.

40|$|Theories of {{intellectual}} property take the individual inventor or the firm as the unit of innovation. But studies in economic sociology show that in complex fields where knowledge is rapidly advancing and widely dispersed among different firms, the locus of innovation is neither an individual nor a single firm. Rather, innovative ideas originate in the informal networks of learning and collaboration that cut across firms. Understanding innovation in this subset of industries as emerging out of networks of informal information-sharing across firms challenges traditional utilitarian theories of <b>trade</b> <b>secret</b> law—which assume <b>trade</b> <b>secret</b> protection is needed to prevent excessive private, self-help efforts to preserve secrecy. Doctrinally, knowledge network {{research suggests that the}} scope of <b>trade</b> <b>secret</b> protection in these industries should be narrow. In these industries, strong <b>trade</b> <b>secret</b> rights that grant managers tight control over employee-inventors’ informal information-sharing practices are bad innovation policy. Rather, optimizing <b>trade</b> <b>secret</b> law requires tailoring the strength of protection to match industry characteristics, narrowing <b>trade</b> <b>secret</b> scope in those industries where informal information-sharing networks are predicted to enhance innovative output. In turn, because industry types tend to cluster around geographic centers, the importance of tailoring cautions against current trends towards uniformity by federalizing <b>trade</b> <b>secret</b> law and favors state experimentalism in designing <b>trade</b> <b>secret</b> law and policy...|$|R

5000|$|The Tenth Circuit instead {{decided that}} Rivendell had {{demonstrated}} that its software was potentially protectable as a <b>trade</b> <b>secret</b> because [...] "a <b>trade</b> <b>secret</b> can include {{a system where}} the elements are in the public domain, {{but there has been}} accomplished an effective, successful and valuable integration of the public domain elements and the <b>trade</b> <b>secret</b> gave the claimant a competitive advantage".|$|R
40|$|When a <b>trade</b> <b>secret</b> is {{stolen from}} its owner and {{posted on the}} Internet, the default rule is that it becomes a free for all. By virtue {{of the fact that}} it has been posted, it becomes public, and {{consequently}} loses its <b>trade</b> <b>secret</b> protection. The ensuing result is that independent third parties, including competitors, are entitled to use it, and the <b>trade</b> <b>secret</b> owner, despite years of laudable efforts to maintain the secret, suffers a fatal loss at the hands of a wrongdoer. The apparent injustice in that conclusion does not go unnoticed. Given that <b>trade</b> <b>secret</b> law is intended to regulate the moral and ethical pulse of competitive commercial behavior, this Article set out to explore the problem presented by <b>trade</b> <b>secret</b> Internet disclosures, and to identify whether at least in some circumstances it may be possible to retain <b>trade</b> <b>secret</b> status after a disclosure. Review of the various legal theories supports the general rule that <b>trade</b> <b>secret</b> status is lost upon disclosure. Nevertheless, considering the equitable and doctrinal considerations underlying <b>trade</b> <b>secret</b> law, and drawing from analogous attorney client privilege cases, there is support for an argument that <b>trade</b> <b>secret</b> status may be saved in some exceptional circumstances. Accordingly, I create and present a sequential preservation model, comprised of three factors, which may be used as a guide to decide which cases qualify for this exception. The model is drawn from and supported by the various legal issues surrounding the problem. While, in reality, it may only save a small number of cases from the general rule, its value lies in its use as an instrument that may be applied by courts to yield consistent results. It provides an avenue to work within the existing constraints of <b>trade</b> <b>secret</b> law to hopefully achieve more just results in compelling cases...|$|R
40|$|According {{to recent}} surveys, {{businesses}} prefer <b>trade</b> <b>secret</b> protection to patent protection. While many scholars have debated about issues of extraterritoriality of patents, copyrights, and trademarks, scholars relatively alienated {{the question of}} the geographic scope of <b>trade</b> <b>secret</b> law. In the absence of clear guidance from either the Supreme Court or both state and federal legislatures, some courts ruled in favor of extending the scope of state <b>trade</b> <b>secret</b> law to conduct abroad. This practice can cause problems in foreign relations, such as the foreign offense or interference with the sovereignty of the foreign nations. To avoid unintended conflicts with foreign nations, issues in the current extraterritorial application of state <b>trade</b> <b>secret</b> law and possible remedies for the issues should be discussed. This Note discusses the geographic scope of <b>trade</b> <b>secret</b> law from the perspective of intellectual property rights and suggests a new approach to reaching foreign conduct. The courts should exercise restraint in extraterritorial application of <b>trade</b> <b>secret</b> law in light of other concerns, such as the presumption against extraterritoriality, choice-of-law issues, and practical problems in enforcing injunctions. First, the presumption against extraterritoriality is applicable to state law. Second, courts’ reliance on choice-of-law analysis deludes courts into disregarding extraterritoriality issues. Third, implementing world-wide injunctions is practically difficult. Furthermore, this Note also addresses remedies to resolve such issues through legislative, judicial, and political branch action. These remedies include enacting a federal <b>trade</b> <b>secret</b> statute at the legislative level, adopting the presumption against extraterritoriality or the ITC approach at the judicial level, and having treaties or agreements at the political level. Through enacting a federal <b>trade</b> <b>secret</b> statute and adopting the presumption or the ITC approach, courts {{will be able to make}} more predictable, uniform, and restrained judgments. Once improved <b>trade</b> <b>secret</b> protection is ensured by treaties, agreements, or sanctions, the need to apply U. S. <b>trade</b> <b>secret</b> law abroad will decrease...|$|R

25|$|A {{trade secret}} is {{information}} that is intentionally kept confidential and that provides a competitive advantage to its possessor. <b>Trade</b> <b>secrets</b> are protected by non-disclosure agreement and labour law, each of which prevents information leaks such as breaches of confidentiality and industrial espionage. Compared to patents, the advantages of <b>trade</b> <b>secrets</b> are {{that the value of}} a trade secret continues until it is made public, whereas a patent is only in force for a specified time, after which others may freely copy the invention; does not require payment of fees to governmental agencies or filing paperwork; has an immediate effect; and does not require any disclosure of information to the public. The key disadvantage of a trade secret is its vulnerability to reverse engineering.|$|E
