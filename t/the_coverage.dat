In Shelby County v.

The other special provisions that are dependent on <b>the</b> <b>coverage</b> formula, such as the Section 5 preclearance requirement, remain valid law.

30|$|Association {{performance}} is {{also influenced by}} the discrepancy between <b>the</b> approximated <b>coverage</b> and <b>the</b> actual <b>coverage.</b> When <b>the</b> approximated <b>coverage</b> is greater than <b>the</b> actual <b>coverage,</b> positions of objects with nonregistered identifications can be estimated within <b>the</b> approximated <b>coverage.</b> Then, a group or incomplete group association increases by the condition in (5) or (11). This can frequently occur when objects move around <b>the</b> boundary of <b>coverage</b> of an identification sensor. Moreover, the effect of <b>the</b> smaller approximated <b>coverage</b> than <b>the</b> actual <b>coverage</b> {{is similar to the}} effect of <b>the</b> larger approximated <b>coverage</b> than actual <b>coverage.</b> Since <b>the</b> number of registered identifications is different from the number of estimated positions within <b>the</b> approximated <b>coverage,</b> this may increase group or incomplete group associations. However, the estimated positions of objects are eventually identified when single associations are established. While <b>the</b> inaccurate <b>coverage</b> model may delay the establishment of single associations, the number of single associations eventually increases by the object dynamics.|$|R
