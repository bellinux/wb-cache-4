5|$|During July 1914, Australia {{and other}} {{units of the}} RAN fleet were on a {{training}} cruise in Queensland waters. On 27 July, the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board learned through press telegrams that the British Admiralty thought {{that there would be}} imminent and widespread war in Europe following the July Crisis, and had begun to position its fleets as a precaution. Three days later, the Board learned that the official warning telegram had been sent: at 22:30, Australia was recalled to Sydney to <b>take</b> <b>on</b> <b>coal</b> and stores.|$|E
5|$|On 19 April {{orders were}} issued for the ANZACs to stop training, {{and for all}} ships and small boats to <b>take</b> <b>on</b> <b>coal</b> and stores, in {{preparation}} for a landing originally scheduled to occur on 23 April. Weather conditions delayed their departure from Lemnos until dawn on 24 April. The Royal Navy battleships Queen, Triumph, Prince of Wales, London, and Majestic, the cruiser Bacchante, seven destroyers and four transport ships led the way carrying the 3rd Brigade. They were followed {{by the rest of the}} force who were embarked in their own transport ships.|$|E
5|$|After the battle, Spee {{took his}} ships north to Valparaiso. Since Chile was neutral, only three ships could enter the port at a time; Spee took Scharnhorst, Gneisenau, and Nürnberg in {{first on the}} morning of 3 November, leaving Dresden and Leipzig with the colliers at Mas a Fuera. There, Spee's ships could <b>take</b> <b>on</b> <b>coal</b> while he conferred with the Admiralty Staff in Germany to {{determine}} the strength of remaining British forces in the region. The ships remained in the port for only 24 hours, in accordance with the neutrality restrictions, and arrived at Mas a Fuera on 6 November, where they took on more coal from captured British and French steamers. On 10 November, Dresden and Leipzig were detached for a stop in Valparaiso, and five days later, Spee took the rest of the squadron south to St. Quentin Bay in the Gulf of Penas. On 18 November, Dresden and Leipzig met Spee while en route and the squadron reached St. Quentin Bay three days later. There, they took on more coal, since the voyage around Cape Horn would be a long one and it was unclear when they would have another opportunity to coal.|$|E
25|$|In December 1877 {{the ship}} sailed from London to Sydney, where she <b>took</b> <b>on</b> <b>coal</b> for Shanghai, {{arriving}} there in April. However, {{the ship was}} unable to find any cargo of tea for a return trip to London—the days of the tea race were over. The master, Captain Tiptaft, died in October while still in Shanghai and was replaced by the first mate, James Wallace. The ship now had to take different cargoes around the world, including coal, jute, castor oil and tea to Australia.|$|R

The ship first went to the island of St. Vincent, <b>took</b> <b>on</b> <b>coal</b> and water, then proceeded south to Montevideo. Chesalakee then rounded South America, calling at Coronel, Chile and then at San Francisco, California. The ship left San Francisco on September 20 and arrived in Vancouver, British Columbia on September 26, 1910. With no upperworks, the ship looked like a tugboat on arrival.|$|R

Monroe dined on board, expressing enthusiasm to the ship's owner, Mr. Scarborough, over {{the prospect of an}} American vessel inaugurating the world's first transatlantic steamship service. The President was also greatly impressed by Savannahs machinery, and invited Scarborough to bring the ship to Washington after her transatlantic crossing so that Congress could inspect the vessel with a view to purchasing her for use as a cruiser against Cuban pirates.|$|R
25|$|Juan Álvarez and a {{group of}} Indian guerrillas were still in control of Guerrero as well as Acapulco, which were not reached by the French army {{in the early stages of}} the intervention. On the morning of January 8, 1863, a French war steamer the Diamant, {{anchored}} into the Acapulco port. Captain Le Bris asked for General Diego Álvarez, son of Juan Álvarez, and made several demands: that the Diamant be allowed to <b>take</b> <b>on</b> <b>coal</b> and water, that the General officially denounce the anti-French statements of the Italian-born Mexican officer Luis Ghilardi published in a local newspaper last year, which resulted in the repelling of the French warship La Bayonnaise, the removal of Ghilardi from his position and that all fort defenses be dismantled on sight. On the following day an apology was sent back but the first two demands were declined, and the city began its preparations against the expected attack. At ¾9 am on the 10th a squadron under Rear-Admiral Bouët, consisting of the Diamant, the war steamer Pallas, and two corvettes the Bayonnaise and the Galathée, approached the bay and was immediately opened fire at the forts. The forts returned the fire and after one hour of constant barrage the artillery of Fort Guerrero was eliminated. Ten minutes later Fort Iturbide was silenced and at ten in the morning Fort Galeana had the same fate. Fort Álvarez still actively exchanged shots with the fleet, though the Mexican firing range was half of those of the French. During the bombardment a number of French shells also ripped into the town, until an American envoy objected to it and thus it was ceased.|$|E

50|$|Magdalene Vinnen II was at {{the time}} the world’s largest {{auxiliary}} barque and exclusively used as a cargo ship with a crew that was partially made up of cadets. She sailed on her maiden voyage on 1 September 1921. Her voyage took her from Bremen via Cardiff, where she <b>took</b> <b>on</b> <b>coal,</b> to Buenos Aires. Despite bad weather, the journey from England to Argentina with holds full of coal took just 30 days. Magdalene Vinnen II carried all sorts of cargo: apart from coal, she took timber from Finland, wheat from Australia, pyrite from Italy and unit load from Belgium. The four-masted barque made two voyages around Cape Horn to Chile. Until her last voyage as Magdalene Vinnen II in 1936, the ship sailed to Argentina, South Africa, Australia, Reunion and the Seychelles.|$|R

Next, she departed for a European goodwill cruise on 26 October. She toured the Mediterranean Sea, stopping in Valletta, Malta, Naples, Italy, and Villefranche, France. She departed France on 30 November, and arrived in New York on 15 December. There, she went into dock at the New York Navy Yard for periodic repairs, which lasted until January 1914.
