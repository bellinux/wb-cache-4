40|$|Central to {{understanding}} the effect of arbitration schemes {{on the process of}} collective bargaining is understanding the process by which arbitrators make decisions. A model of arbitrator behavior inconventional arbitration is developed that allows the arbitration award to be a function of both <b>the</b> <b>offers</b> of <b>the</b> parties and the(exogenous) facts of the case. The weight that the arbitrator puts on the facts relative to <b>the</b> <b>offers</b> is hypothesized to be a function of the quality of <b>the</b> <b>offers</b> as measured by the difference between <b>the</b> <b>offers.</b> Two special cases of this model are derived: 1) the arbitrator bases the award strictly on <b>the</b> <b>offers</b> of <b>the</b> parties(split-the-difference) and 2) the arbitrator bases the award strictly on {{the facts of the case}}. The model is implemented empirically using data gathered from practicing arbitrators regarding their decisions in twenty-five hypothetical cases. These data have the advantage that they allow causal inference regarding the effect on the arbitration award of the facts relative to <b>the</b> <b>offers.</b> On <b>the</b> basis of the estimates, both of the special case models are strongly rejected. The arbitration awards are found to be influenced by both <b>the</b> <b>offers</b> of <b>the</b> parties and the facts of the case. In addition, the weight put on the facts of the case relative to <b>the</b> <b>offers</b> is found to vary significantly with the quality of <b>the</b> <b>offers.</b> When <b>the</b> <b>offers</b> are of low quality (far apart) the arbitrator weights the facts more heavily and <b>the</b> <b>offers</b> less heavily. These results suggest that the naive split-the difference view of arbitrator behavior, which is the basis of the critique of conventional arbitration that has led to the adoption of final-offer arbitration, is no correct in its extreme view. On the other hand,the awards are affected by <b>the</b> <b>offers</b> so that <b>the</b> parties can manipulate the outcome to some extent by manipulating their <b>offers.</b> However, <b>the</b> scope for this sort of influence is limited by the finding that <b>the</b> <b>offers</b> are weighted less heavily as their quality deteriorates. ...|$|R
30|$|In the {{following}} {{we attempt to}} find the maximum carried loads of each link in various scenarios. One observation from solving the system of equations in Section 5.1 is that the carried load will be smaller than <b>the</b> <b>offered</b> load when <b>the</b> <b>offered</b> load is too large. This corresponds to the instability of 802.11 observed in previous works (e.g., [15]). Therefore, we use binary search to find the maximum carried load under stable conditions. Initially, the search range for <b>the</b> <b>offered</b> load is between 0 and 1 [*]Mbps. We choose {{the midpoint of the}} search range to be <b>the</b> <b>offered</b> load and solve the system of equations. If the resultant carried load is the same as <b>the</b> <b>offered</b> load, <b>the</b> <b>offered</b> load can be increased, and the next search range will be the upper half of the original one. Otherwise, <b>the</b> <b>offered</b> load results in instability, and the next search range will be {{the lower half of the}} original one. This procedure is repeated until the search range is sufficiently small.|$|R

40|$|The paper reports how <b>the</b> <b>offered</b> {{university}} activities {{support the}} development of students’ entrepreneurship abilities. Data were collected from 306 students from Slovenian and 609 students from Croatian universities. The study reduces the gap between theoretical researches about the academic entrepreneurship education and individual empirical studies about the student’s estimation of <b>the</b> <b>offered</b> academic activities for development of their entrepreneurial abilities. The empirical research revealed differences in Slovenian and Croatian students’ perception about (a) needed academic activities and (b) significance of <b>the</b> <b>offered</b> university activities, for {{the development of}} their entrepreneurial abilities. Additionally, the results reveal that the impact of students’ gender and study level on their perception about the importance of <b>the</b> <b>offered</b> academic activities is not significant for most of the considered activities. The main practical implication is focused on further improvement of universities’ entrepreneurship education programs through selection and utilization of activities which can fill in the recognized gaps between the students’ needed and <b>the</b> <b>offered</b> academic activities {{for the development of}} students’ entrepreneurial abilities...|$|R
