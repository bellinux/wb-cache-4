5|$|Costume {{designer}} Anthony Powell {{found it}} a challenge to create Connery's costume because the script required the character to wear the same clothes throughout. Powell <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> own grandfather and incorporated tweed suits and fishing hats. Powell felt it necessary for Henry to wear glasses, but {{did not want to}} hide Connery's eyes, so chose rimless ones. He could not find any suitable, so he had them specially made. The Nazi costumes were genuine and were found in Eastern Europe by Powell's co-designer Joanna Johnston, to whom he gave research pictures and drawings for reference.|$|E
25|$|Akira Yamanaka {{was born}} in Yokohama, Japan, on September 2, 1946. He {{grew up in a}} family of seven children, though the only one of mixed descent as his father was a US Army soldier of Caribbean descent. In his autobiography, he {{mentions}} that he never met his biological father and that he came from a poor family in ruined Yokohama; being born in a brothel as his mother was a prostitute for the Recreation and Amusement Association. The only knowledge of his father was that he was a US soldier from either Cuba or Jamaica. Joe grew up in an orphanage after his mother and stepfather died. During an interview with Mainichi Shimbun, Akira stated that he was born with tuberculosis and that he never really <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> biological father, believing those who raise you are your real parents.|$|E
2500|$|The {{apparent}} stalemate {{was interrupted}} by {{emergence of a new}} force. The young Carlists, disappointed with vacillating Don Javier, focused on his oldest son Hugues instead. Entirely alien to politics and at the time pursuing PhD in economics in Oxford, he agreed to throw himself into the Spanish affairs. Don Javier consented to his 1957 appearance on the annual Montejurra gathering, where the young prince, guided by his equally young aides, made explicit references to [...] "my father, the king". As prince Hugues was ignorant as to Carlism and he barely spoke Spanish, it seems that his father has never considered him own successor, eager rather to free himself and the entire family from the increasingly heavy Carlist burden. It is not clear what he <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> son unexpectedly engaging in Spanish politics; perhaps he felt relieved having found a replacement or support. To many, it seemed that he [...] "had given up prevaricating".|$|E

60|$|Many {{times during}} the night had George <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> missing horses; {{but it was not}} until he was {{relieved}} from all care which the conflagration had caused, that he began to grow seriously alarmed. It did not seem possible that any one could have stolen them, and he cheered himself with the thought that they had simply broken loose and run away, or that some one living near by had cared for them.|$|E
60|$|Between {{the times}} of feeling for the money and seeing whether his brother was alive, he <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> mother: how frightened she would be if she knew what had {{happened}} to him and his brother, after they left her. And he thought of his father: how troubled he must be at their not getting home. It seemed to him that he must be to blame, somehow, but he could not understand how, exactly; and he could not think of any way to help it.|$|E

6000|$|He {{found himself}} {{thinking}} of young Heinrich {{in the very}} manner, if with a lesser intensity, in which he <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> own son, as of hopes senselessly destroyed. His mind took no note {{of the fact that}} Heinrich was an enemy, that by the reckoning of a [...] "war of attrition" [...] his death was balance and compensation for the death of Hugh. He went straight to the root fact that they had been gallant and kindly beings, and that the same thing had killed them both....|$|E
60|$|The rope {{tightened}} with a jerk, a camel {{rose from}} the water, {{and for a few}} moments swung wildly to and fro. The animal looked ridiculous, with its outstretched neck and paddling legs. Then Mossamedes steadied and one heard running wire; the camel sank and vanished and the rope came down again. When all were on board, Miguel started for the beach with a fresh crew, and Kit went to see the animals fastened up and fed. The mate was accountable for their stowing, but camels were worth much at Grand Canary, and Kit imagined his employer's interest was his. Sometimes when he <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> efforts afterwards, he smiled.|$|E
60|$|What was he {{thinking}} {{of all the}} time? He scarcely knew. One by one, like little clouds in the summer sky, fancies arose in his mind to sail slowly across its depth and vanish upon an inconclusive and shadowy horizon. Of course, he <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> instruments; these were never absent from his heart. His instinct flew back to them as an oasis, as an island of rest in the wilderness of this father's thorny and depressing conversation. The instruments were disappointing, it is true, at present; but, at any rate, they did not dwell gloomily upon impending ruin or suggest {{that it was his}} duty to get married. They remained silent, distressingly silent indeed.|$|E

60|$|But I {{think that}} when a man has reached that state of mind, as David reached it, he will rise, as David rose, to a higher state of mind still. He will rise, as David rises in this psalm, from <b>thoughts</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> own soul, to <b>thoughts</b> <b>about</b> God. In one word, he will rise from {{religion}} to that which is above even religion, namely theology.|$|R

60|$|Jim did not answer. He {{was tired}} and now the {{reaction}} from the strain had begun, was glad to indulge his bodily and mental lassitude. The springy branches on which he lay were comfortable and the camp, with the red firelight flickering on the trunks and Carrie sitting by the hearth-logs, had a curious charm. She, so to speak, dominated the tranquil picture and gave her rude surroundings a homelike touch. On other expeditions, when Carrie was not there, Jim had <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> camp as a place at which one slept. Now it was something else; a place from which one drew strength and cheerfulness. There was something strangely intimate about it; {{he was glad to}} get back.|$|E
60|$|For a while, he made steady progress; {{and then}} the snow grew harder. Its surface had melted and frozen again, {{resulting}} in a crust that could scarcely be penetrated. He <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> ax, {{but he could not}} see how he could use it in cutting steps beneath him without falling down, and this was not the place for hazardous experiments. He went on very cautiously, finding the work of kicking hollows for his feet extremely severe, until, when he supposed that half an hour had passed, he drove his toes in deep and lay down to rest. On looking up, he seemed to have come a very short distance, and when he glanced below he felt appalled at the length of the declivity he must still creep down. His limbs ached; his mittens were worn and his hands badly numbed; and one boot was coming to pieces.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Hittaway was a strong-minded woman,--the strongest-minded {{probably}} of the Fawn family,--but she had {{now come}} upon a task which taxed all her strength to the utmost. She had told her mother that she would tell [...] "Frederic" [...] what she <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> proposed bride, and she had now come to carry out her threat. She had asked her brother to come and dine with her, but he had declined. His engagements hardly admitted of his dining with his relatives. She had called upon him at the rooms he occupied in Victoria Street,--but of course she had not found him. She could not very well go to his club;--so now she had hunted him down at his office. From the very commencement of the interview Mrs. Hittaway was strong-minded. She began {{the subject of the}} marriage, and did so without a word of congratulation. [...] "Dear Frederic," [...] she said, [...] "you know that we have all got to look up to you." ...|$|E

6000|$|It was at {{any rate}} {{incumbent}} upon him to call upon Lady Julia the next morning, because of his commission. The Berlin wool might remain in his portmanteau till his portmanteau should go {{with him to the}} cottage; but he would take the spectacles at once, and he must explain to Lady Julia what the lawyers had told him about the income. So he hired a saddle-horse from [...] "The Magpie" [...] and started after breakfast on the morning after his arrival. In his unheroic days he would have walked,--as he had done, scores of times, over the whole distance from Guestwick to Allington. But now, in these grander days, he <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> boots and the mud, and the formal appearance of the thing. [...] "Ah dear," [...] he said, to himself, as the nag walked slowly out of the town, [...] "it used to be better with me in the old days. I hardly hoped that she would ever accept me, but at least she had never refused me. And then that brute had not as yet made his way down to Allington!" ...|$|E
60|$|Who {{can deny}} that fiction would be incomparably stronger, incomparably truer, if once it could tear off the habit which enslaves {{it to the}} celebration chiefly of a single passion, in one phase or another, and could frankly {{dedicate}} itself {{to the service of}} all the passions, all the interests, all the facts? Every novelist who has <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> art knows that it would, and I think that upon reflection he must doubt whether his sphere would be greatly enlarged if he were allowed to treat freely the darker aspects of the favorite passion. But, as I have shown, the privilege, the right to do this, is already perfectly recognized. This is proved again by the fact that serious criticism recognizes as master-works (I will not push the question of supremacy) the two great novels which above all others have, moved the world by their study of guilty love. If by any chance, if by some prodigious miracle, any American should now arise to treat it on the level of 'Anna Karenina' and 'Madame Bovary,' he would be absolutely sure of success, and of fame and gratitude as great as those books have won for their authors.|$|E
6000|$|He sate and mused by his fireside {{over the}} past events, and the confounded impudence and ingratitude of servants; and thought how he should get a new man: how devilish {{unpleasant}} {{it was for a}} man of his age, and with his habits, to part with a fellow to whom he had been accustomed: how Morgan had a receipt for boot-varnish, which was incomparably better and more comfortable to the feet than any he had ever tried: how very well he made mutton-broth, and tended him when he was unwell. [...] "Gad, it's a hard thing to lose a fellow of that sort: but he must go," [...] thought the Major. [...] "He has grown rich, and impudent since he has grown rich. He was horribly tipsy and abusive to-night. We must part, and I must go out of the lodgings. Dammy, I like the lodgings; I'm used to 'em. It's very unpleasant, at my time of life, to change my quarters." [...] And so on, mused the old gentleman. The shower-bath had done him good: the testiness was gone: the loss of the umbrella, the smell of paint at the Club, were forgotten under the superior excitement. [...] "Confound the insolent villain!" [...] thought the old gentleman. [...] "He understood my wants to a nicety: he was the best servant in England." [...] He <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> servant as a man thinks of a horse that has carried him long and well, and that has come down with him, and is safe no longer. How the deuce to replace him? Where can he get such another animal? ...|$|E
