5|$|From the 1890s through 1906, Tesla spent a {{great deal}} of his time and fortune on a series of {{projects}} trying to develop the transmission of electrical power without wires. It was an expansion of his idea of using coils to <b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> he had been demonstrating in wireless lighting. He could see this as not only a way to transmit large amounts of power around the world but also, as he had pointed out in his earlier lectures, a way to transmit worldwide communications.|$|E
5|$|During the Sun Dance, {{which is}} practiced by many Plains Indian tribes, the eagle is {{represented}} in several ways. The eagle nest {{is represented by the}} fork of the lodge where the dance is held. A whistle made from the wing bone of an eagle is used {{during the course of the}} dance. Also during the dance, a medicine man may direct his fan, which is made of eagle feathers, to people who seek to be healed. The medicine man touches the fan to the center pole and then to the patient, in order to <b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> from the pole to the patient. The fan is then held up toward the sky, so that the eagle may carry the prayers for the sick to the Creator.|$|E
5|$|In 1893, Edward Dean Adams, {{who headed}} up the Niagara Falls Cataract Construction Company, sought Tesla's opinion on what system {{would be best to}} <b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> {{generated}} at the falls. Over several years, there had been a series of proposals and open competitions on how best to use power generated by the falls. Among the systems proposed by several US and European companies were two-phase and three-phase AC, high-voltage DC, and compressed air. Adams pumped Tesla for information about the current state of all the competing systems. Tesla advised Adams that a two-phased system would be the most reliable, and that there was a Westinghouse system to light incandescent bulbs using two-phase alternating current. The company awarded a contract to Westinghouse Electric for building a two-phase AC generating system at the Niagara Falls, based on Tesla's advice and Westinghouse's demonstration at the Columbian Exposition that they could build a complete AC system. At the same time, a further contract was awarded to General Electric to build the AC distribution system.|$|E

30|$|The best {{response}} algorithm {{and better}} response algorithm {{are the two}} kinds of typical game decision algorithms for solving OPG’s NE. In the best response algorithm, a game player adopts a value for its <b>transmitting</b> <b>power</b> (i.e., an action) that maximizes its earnings when it {{has a chance to}} adjust its <b>transmitting</b> <b>power</b> (i.e., make decision). In the better response algorithm, a game player makes a small decrement in its <b>transmitting</b> <b>power</b> if the power decrement improves its earnings; otherwise, the player still keeps its previous <b>transmitting</b> <b>power.</b>|$|R

40|$|In WCDMA system, uplink (UL) and {{downlink}} (DL) {{have different}} channel propagation characteristics. Base station (BS) and mobile station (MS) require different target bit-energy per noise ratio (EblNo), <b>transmitting</b> <b>powers</b> and loading factor. Therefore, the path loss for UL and DL {{does not match}} and rather unbalanced. The difference in path loss between UL and DL results in unnecessary interference to MSs in other cells. If too much <b>transmitting</b> <b>power</b> of MS is used for UL, the soft capacity degraded. In WCDMA system, CPICH (Common Pilot Channel) is the reference to other common channels from the <b>transmitting</b> <b>power's</b> viewpoint. In this study, link balance between UL and DL is analyzed. <b>Transmitting</b> <b>power</b> of CPICH is manipulated for link balance between UL and DL.

40|$|This work {{considers}} an {{additive noise}} channel where the time-k noise variance is a weighted {{sum of the}} channel input powers prior to time k. This channel is motivated by point-to-point communication between two terminals that are embedded in the same chip.

25|$|Coaxial cables are {{commonly}} used at audio frequencies and above for convenience. A coaxial cable has a conductive wire inside a conductive tube, separated by a dielectric layer. The current flowing {{on the surface of}} the inner conductor is equal and opposite to the current flowing on the inner surface of the outer tube. The electromagnetic field is thus completely contained within the tube, and (ideally) no energy is lost to radiation or coupling outside the tube. Coaxial cables have acceptably small losses for frequencies up to about 5GHz. For microwave frequencies greater than 5GHz, the losses (due mainly to the electrical resistance of the central conductor) become too large, making waveguides a more efficient medium for transmitting energy. Coaxial cables with an air rather than solid dielectric are preferred as they <b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> with lower loss.|$|E

25|$|Parallel hybrids, such as Honda's Insight, Civic, and Accord hybrids, can {{simultaneously}} <b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> {{to their}} drive wheels from two distinct sources—for example, an {{internal combustion engine}} and a battery-powered electric drive. Although most parallel hybrids incorporate an electric motor between the vehicle's engine and transmission, a parallel hybrid can also use its engine to drive one of the vehicle's axles, while its electric motor drives the other axle and/or a generator used for recharging the batteries. This type is called a road-coupled hybrid. The Audi Duo plug-in hybrid concept car {{is an example of}} this type of parallel hybrid architecture. Parallel hybrids can be programmed to use the electric motor to substitute for the ICE at lower power demands as well as to substantially increase the power available to a smaller ICE, both of which substantially increase fuel economy compared to a simple ICE vehicle.|$|E

It allowed a farmer to combine cutting and threshing grain into a single mechanical operation, enabling farmers to cut more wheat in one pass, increasing productivity and cutting labor hours nearly in half.
