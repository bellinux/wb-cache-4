40|$|International {{audience}} 4 D Trajectory optimization {{in dense}} <b>terminal</b> <b>control</b> <b>area</b> {{is one of}} the most challenging problems in air traffic management research. In order to efficiently and robustly land more aircraft at Beijing Capital International Airport (BCIA), one of the busiest airport in the world, a novel trajectory operation model is proposed, i. e. Multi-layer Point Merge (ML-PM) based Autonomous Arrival Management System. This paper aims at the evaluation of its potential operational benefits in terms of flight efficiency and runway throughput. Horizontal and Vertical profiles of ML-PM route network are introduced, the objective and constraints of this optimizing mathematical model are analyzed, especially the speed change profile and the conflict detection mode for merging zone. Then a case study is made by simulating arrival flows under three different operational modes: baseline, traditional point merge, and the ML-PM. Finally, the results show that rational arrival sequence and conflict-free trajectories are generated in ML-PM system, the benefits gained are very positive. Comparing with baseline and the traditional point merge system, ML-PM system shows good performance on flight time, fuel consumption, CO 2 emission. The saving of fuel with ML-PM system is expected around 26838 Yuan per hour at BCIA compared with baseline scenario by numerical simulation. Furthermore, more flexible sequence position shift and continuous descent are possible in ML-PM system, and it is capable to handle the high-density operation environment...|$|E

Fast-time simulation was used to evaluate each scenario against a wide range of accuracy levels corresponding to required navigation precision standards and linked to on-board navigation and communication systems. Experiments reveal a strong robustness of the separation algorithm up to relatively high uncertainty levels, indicating that UASs equipped with low accuracy navigation systems can still manage proper separation. However, the maneuvering cost for separation increases when the accuracy deteriorates. Nevertheless, a UAS with GPS-based navigation in a collaborative environment (e. g. aircraft providing their navigation parameters through ADS-B) can expect robustness at a reasonable cost...|$|R

40|$|This work {{addresses}} the real-time optimization of take-off and landing operations at a busy <b>terminal</b> <b>control</b> <b>area</b> {{in case of}} traffic congestion. Terminal areas are becoming the bottleneck of the entire air traffic control system, in particular in the major European airports, {{where there is a}} limited possibility to build new infrastructure. The real-time problem of effectively managing aircraft operations is particularly challenging, since it is necessary to incorporate the safety regulations into the optimization model and to consider numerous performance indicators that are important to compute good quality solutions. However, in practice there is no well-recognized objective function and traffic controllers often use simple scheduling rules. In this paper, mixed integer linear programming formulations are proposed to investigate the trade-off between various performance indicators of practical interest, while taking into account the safety constraints with a high modeling precision. Experiments are performed for the two major Italian airports, Milano Malpensa and Roma Fiumicino, by simulating various sets of random landing and take-off aircraft disturbances. Practical-size instances are solved to (near) optimality via a commercial solver. The optimized solutions are also compared with a commonly used scheduling rule. A comprehensive computational analysis makes possible the selection of those solutions that are able to find a good compromise among the various indicators and, consequently, the investigation of the most representative formulation. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{addresses}} the real-time problem of scheduling aircraft in a <b>Terminal</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Area</b> (TCA). At a congested airport, airborne decisions {{need to be}} taken regarding take-off and landing operations in given time horizons of traffic prediction. In this work, aircraft are rescheduled at holding circles, air segments and runways during disturbances in order to minimize the propagation of aircraft delays. We formulate this problem via an alternative graph formulation, i. e., a detailed job shop scheduling model of the aircraft scheduling problem. A rolling horizon framework is introduced to manage busy traffic situations with a large number of delayed aircraft. As scheduling algorithms, we compare a Branch and Bound (BB) algorithm with a First Come First Served (FCFS) rule that we use as a surrogate for the dispatchers behaviour. The solution algorithms are evaluated on practical size instances from Roma Fiumicino and Milano Malpensa airports, in Italy. Traffic disturbances are simulated for the assessment of the solution procedures. We distinguish between entrance aircraft delays and small random variations on the aircraft entry times in the TCA. Rolling horizon parameters are evaluated such as the extension of the current traffic flow forecast and the time shift between the start of successive traffic predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that BB solutions are of better quality compared to FCFS solutions. BB computes feasible schedules that better minimizes aircraft delay and travel time minimization. Also, BB requires less frequent changes of aircraft scheduling decisions between consecutive traffic predictions. The performance of BB is less affected by random variations of entry times...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis work {{addresses}} the real-time problem of managing take-off and landing operations in presence of traffic disturbances at a busy <b>Terminal</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Area</b> (TCA). The possible aircraft conflict detection and resolution actions are aircraft timing and routing decisions. An important objective of traffic controllers is the minimization of delay propagation, which {{may reduce the}} aircraft travel times and their energy consumption. To improve the effectiveness of air traffic monitoring and control in a busy TCA, we present an optimization-based decision support system based on a rolling horizon framework. The problem is modelled via an alternative graph formulation, i. e. a detailed model of air traffic flows in the TCA, and solved by aircraft rescheduling and rerouting algorithms. We compare a truncated branch and bound algorithm for aircraft rescheduling with fixed routes, a tabu search scheme for combined aircraft rescheduling and rerouting, and the {{first in first out}} (FIFO) rule that we use as a surrogate for the dispatchers behaviour. Computational experiments are based on practical size instances from the Milan Malpensa airport, in Italy. Disturbed traffic situations are generated by simulating various sets of delayed landing/departing aircraft and a temporarily blocked runway. We evaluate different parameters of the rolling horizon framework, such as the frequency of aircraft retiming and rerouting and the time horizon of prediction, i. e., the extension of the current traffic flow forecast, including roll and look-ahead periods. The roll period is the time shift between the start of successive traffic predictions. A detailed analysis of the experimental results demonstrate that the solutions produced by the optimization algorithms are of better quality compared to FIFO, in terms of delay and travel time minimization. However, the optimization approaches require frequent re-timing and re-routing in consecutive time horizons...|$|E

The article investigates the influence of the various parameters on the separation achieved and the amount of maneuvers required, especially the strategy used to select the best maneuver among the allowed headings. The analysis of our results shows that, amid two basic and “extreme” strategies that favor either minimal heading changes or the robustness of the maneuvers, the combination of both, switching from the first one to the second whenever the distance between the UAS and aircraft falls under a given threshold, gives the best results with very few remaining airproxes, while keeping low the amount and amplitude of maneuvers...|$|R
