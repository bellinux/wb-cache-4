5|$|Grey's troops marched {{around the}} head of the Acushnet River and camped on the eastern banks. The {{following}} day, they embarked on <b>their</b> <b>boats,</b> but General Grey decided that Fairhaven should also be raided. Concurrently, militia were beginning to arrive to defend Fairhaven, with Major Israel Fearing taking command from an elderly colonel who was reluctant to pursue an active defense. The British approached Fairhaven on the morning of September 6, and Fearing arrayed about 150 men between the village and their landing point. The British set fire to a few nearby buildings and then headed for the village. At this point, Fearing's men unleashed a withering volley of musket fire, and the British precipitately retreated to <b>their</b> <b>boats.</b>|$|E
5|$|On January 12, 2016, Iranian {{armed forces}} {{captured}} United States Navy personnel when <b>their</b> <b>boats</b> entered Iranian territorial waters {{off the coast}} of Farsi Island in the Persian Gulf.

5|$|Arriving off Kamimbo, Hashimoto's force loaded 1,972 {{soldiers}} by 00:03 on 8 February, unhindered by the U.S. Navy. For {{an additional}} 90 minutes, destroyer crewmen rowed <b>their</b> <b>boats</b> {{along the shore}} calling out {{again and again to}} make sure no one was left behind. At 01:32, the Reinforcement Group left Guadalcanal in its wake and reached Bougainville without incident at 10:00, completing the operation.|$|E
50|$|Purchasing and {{maintaining}} a yacht can be costly. Most cruising sailors do not own a house and consider <b>their</b> <b>boat</b> <b>their</b> home during the duration of their cruise. Many cruisers find they spend, on average, 4% of <b>their</b> <b>boat's</b> purchase price annually on boat maintenance.|$|R

5|$|Due to the hurricane's threat, workers fled oil {{platforms}} in the Gulf of Mexico, {{while the}} Coast Guard moved <b>their</b> <b>boats</b> inland. Officials in Mississippi suggested that about 100,000people evacuate the coastal counties. Shelters were opened in Hancock and Harrison counties, though only 68people {{went to a}} shelter in the former. Gambling ships were moved into harbors and inland canals. Two run-offs for special legislative elections scheduled for August 25 were postponed.|$|E
5|$|On August 1, {{officials}} in Puerto Rico issued {{a tropical storm}} warning for the island. The next day, approximately 600 tourists evacuated the islands of Vieques and Culebra. On August 2, {{the government of the}} Bahamas issued a Hurricane Watch for the Turks and Caicos Islands, the Acklins and Crooked Islands, Ragged Island, Inagua, and Mayaguana. In response to the threat, officials urged citizens to stock up on hurricane supplies, while boat owners in Staniel Cay secured <b>their</b> <b>boats</b> in preparation for the storm.|$|E
5|$|The stations' closure also {{forced the}} Tyne Sea Scouts, who had {{operated}} from the North station since 1978, to seek new accommodation. The scouts {{had moved into}} the station when their boat house in Blyth was deemed unsafe and demolished. They had been provided with two site offices, storage in the power station complex, and permission to keep <b>their</b> <b>boats</b> at the North station's jetty, {{at the end of}} which they had a slipway built.|$|E
50|$|During the series, Dick and James travel {{round the}} {{coastline}} of South-West Cornwall on <b>their</b> <b>boat,</b> the Morwenna, visiting local food producers, inviting them onto <b>their</b> <b>boat</b> {{at the end}} of each show for a competition to see who cooks the best dish.|$|R
25|$|In the Fall of 1673, Jacques Marquette, a French Jesuit missionary, and Louis Jolliet, a French Canadian explorer, {{passed a}} small piece of Kentucky by the mouth of the Ohio on <b>their</b> <b>boat</b> trip down the Mississippi River. Later, <b>their</b> <b>boat</b> would capsize, and many of their papers were destroyed.|$|R
5|$|On 24 March, CUBC {{announced}} <b>their</b> <b>boat</b> name Kevin after Kevin Whyman, cox of {{the successful}} 1996 and 1997 crews {{who was killed in}} a solo aircraft display crash at CarFest North in August 2015. OUBC announced <b>their</b> <b>boat</b> name Daniel after their former coach Daniel Topolski, who died in February 2015.|$|R
5|$|After many {{boats were}} wrecked and {{several hundred people}} died, the North-West Mounted Police (NWMP) {{introduced}} safety rules, vetting the boats carefully and forbidding women and children to travel through the rapids. Additional rules stated that any boat carrying passengers required a licensed pilot, typically costing $25 ($680), although some prospectors simply unpacked <b>their</b> <b>boats</b> and let them drift unmanned through the rapids {{with the intent of}} walking down to collect them on the other side. During the summer, a horse-powered rail-tramway was built by Norman Macaulay, capable of carrying boats and equipment through the canyon at $25 ($680) a time, removing the need for prospectors to navigate the rapids.|$|E
5|$|As the new-fangled Ford Model Ts {{and other}} early {{automobiles}} increasingly {{took to the}} roads in the 1920s, inland steamship lines in the U.S. initially resisted carrying automobiles on <b>their</b> <b>boats.</b> By the Depression-ravaged 1930s, however, the Old Bay Line {{became one of the}} first inland steamship companies to promote the carriage of automobiles as a means of filling its ships' empty cargo holds. The Depression and loss of business to improved highways took an increasing toll of many U.S. steamship lines in the 1930s, as historic companies such as the Fall River Line ceased operation in 1937, preceded by the Lake Champlain company, which was the oldest steamboat line in the U.S. at its demise in 1932.|$|E
5|$|Because a Hurricane Watch {{existed for}} the New York City {{metropolitan}} area, New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani urged citizens to take preparations. In addition, city officials {{set up a}} hurricane helpline, activated the city's Emergency Command Center at the Police Headquarters, and distributed leaflets to flood-prone areas. Near New Bedford, Massachusetts, where landfall was predicted to occur, schools were prepared as shelters {{in case of a}} direct hit. New Bedford Mayor issued a state of emergency for the city. However, few people stayed in shelters during the storm's passage. On Cape Cod, thousands of tourists and summer residents evacuated in preparation for the storm, resulting in an 18-mile (29km) traffic backup. As a result, many beach resorts lost millions in potential revenue. Of those who remained on Cape Cod, 900 stayed in emergency shelters when the storm passed the area. In Boston's Logan International Airport, numerous flights were cancelled or delayed to move planes to safety. Many sailors removed <b>their</b> <b>boats</b> from the water prior to the storm. At one time in Mattapoisett Harbor, workers removed boats at a rate of one every eight minutes. In Maine, the Red Cross opened several emergency shelters, though they were never used. Like in Massachusetts, sailors removed <b>their</b> <b>boats,</b> and due to media coverage, residents were well-prepared for the hurricane.|$|E

5|$|During Darwin's lifetime, many {{geographical}} {{features were}} given his name. An expanse of water adjoining the Beagle Channel was named Darwin Sound by Robert FitzRoy after Darwin's prompt action, {{along with two}} or three of the men, saved them from being marooned on a nearby shore when a collapsing glacier caused a large wave that would have swept away <b>their</b> <b>boats,</b> and the nearby Mount Darwin in the Andes was named in celebration of Darwin's 25th birthday. When the Beagle was surveying Australia in 1839, Darwin's friend John Lort Stokes sighted a natural harbour which the ship's captain Wickham named Port Darwin: a nearby settlement was renamed Darwin in 1911, and it became the capital city of Australia's Northern Territory.|$|E
5|$|Foley's {{attack was}} {{followed}} by Hood in Zealous, who also crossed the French line and successfully anchored next to Guerrier in the space Foley had intended, engaging the lead ship's bow from close range. Within five minutes Guerriers foremast had fallen, to cheers from the crews of the approaching British ships. The speed of the British advance took the French captains by surprise; they were still aboard Orient in conference with the admiral when the firing started. Hastily launching <b>their</b> <b>boats,</b> they returned to their vessels. Captain Jean-François-Timothée Trullet of Guerrier shouted orders from his barge for his men to return fire on Zealous.|$|E
5|$|Franklin's three-year {{exploration}} of the northern coast of Canada {{in search of the}} Northwest Passage had ended in disaster amid accusations of murder and cannibalism, with 11 of the 20members of the group killed and the survivors reduced to eating lichen, their own boots, and the remains of rotten carcasses abandoned by wolves. The party had become stranded {{on the wrong side of}} the Coppermine River after <b>their</b> <b>boats</b> had been destroyed in a storm; John Richardson had attempted to swim to safety and suffered severe hypothermia. A single member of the party had fashioned a small canoe from canvas and willow, and the survivors had been obliged to cross the river one at a time using the makeshift canoe.|$|E

5|$|From here Alcibiades {{joined in}} the siege of Byzantium along with Theramenes and Thrasyllus. A portion of the {{citizens}} of the city, demoralized and hungry, decided to surrender the city to Alcibiades for similar terms as the Selymbrians had received. On the designated night the defenders left their posts, and the Athenians attacked the Peloponnesian garrison in the city and <b>their</b> <b>boats</b> in the harbor. The portion of the citizenry that remained loyal to the Peloponnesians fought so savagely that Alcibiades issued a statement {{in the midst of the}} fighting which guaranteed their safety and this persuaded the remaining citizens to turn against the Peloponnesian garrison, which was nearly totally destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Kidnapping is also {{a common}} theme in such folklore. Encantados {{are said to be}} fond of abducting humans with whom they fall in love, {{children}} born of their illicit love affairs, or just about anyone near the river who can keep them company, and taking them back to the Encante. The fear of this is so great among {{people who live in the}} Amazon river area that both children and adults are terrified of going near the water between dusk and dawn, or entering water-bodies alone. Some who supposedly have encountered encantados while out in their canoes have been said to have gone insane, although in fact, the creatures seem to have done little more than follow <b>their</b> <b>boats</b> and nudge them from time to time.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the shark}} attacks the other kids, hitting one of <b>their</b> <b>boats,</b> and causing {{most of them}} to capsize and crash into {{each other in the}} ensuing panic, {{throwing}} several of them, including Mike and Sean, into the water. The other teens help them out of the water while two of them pull Mike out as the shark goes for him and head back to get help. Sean and the others remain adrift on the wreckage of tangled boats. A Coast Guard marine helicopter that Brody contacted arrives to tow them to shore. Before the pilot can tow them, the shark attacks and sinks the chopper with the pilot at the controls. It then knocks Sean into the water, but Marge sacrifices herself to save him.|$|E

When they return from <b>their</b> <b>boat</b> after the dive, they are greeted by Carlton and Azra, who have been hiding in <b>their</b> <b>boat</b> and are ready to kill them. Carlton tells them that in container one there is the casing and in container two there is a nuclear warhead. One without the other is useless but together they make a powerful weapon.

5|$|NYC Ferry {{operates}} three {{shuttle bus}} routes. One is a preexisting NY Waterway {{service to the}} East 34th Street landing. The other two are brand-new services to the Rockaway landing, which is at Beach 108th Street. One route goes west to Jacob Riis Park, while the other was originally planned for operation between the ferry landing and Beach 67th Street, but was ultimately extended eastward. The Environmental Impact Statement provided for {{an extension of the}} Beach 67th Street bus to Beach 31st Street via Rockaway Beach Boulevard and Beach Channel Drive, but de Blasio's office said that extending the bus further would cause a bus fleet shortage, resulting in passengers missing <b>their</b> <b>boats.</b> As of June 2017, the East Shuttle bus only runs to Beach 35th Street.|$|E
5|$|PLO {{cross-border}} raids against Israel grew {{during the}} late 1970s. One of the most severe—known as the Coastal Road massacre—occurred on 11 March 1978. A force of nearly a dozen Fatah fighters landed <b>their</b> <b>boats</b> near a major coastal road connecting the city of Haifa with Tel Aviv-Yafo. There they hijacked a bus and sprayed gunfire inside and at passing vehicles, killing thirty-seven civilians. In response, the IDF launched Operation Litani three days later, {{with the goal of}} taking control of Southern Lebanon up to the Litani River. The IDF achieved this goal, and Arafat withdrew PLO forces north into Beirut.|$|E
5|$|The {{governments of}} the islands in the {{predicted}} path of Erika urged residents to quickly prepare for the hurricane through radio addresses. In the wake of busy seasons in 1995 and 1996, which some islands were still recovering from, emergency preparations began. In Puerto Rico, fishermen secured <b>their</b> <b>boats</b> {{in preparation for the}} storm. Also on the island, citizens formed long lines at gas stations and purchased emergency supplies. Officials in Anguilla enacted a plan that would turn off the island's power supply if the winds exceeded 50mph (80km/h). As a precaution, authorities on Saint Martin enacted a curfew for all but those in service jobs.|$|E
