500|$|Night of the Blood Beast was one {{of several}} films {{produced}} by B movie filmmaker Roger Corman and his brother, Gene Corman. The two also partnered together in making Hot Car Girl (1958), Beast from Haunted Cave (1959), Attack of the Giant Leeches (1959) and The Premature Burial (1962). Jerome Bixby, the science fiction screenwriter who wrote It! The Terror from Beyond Space (1958), was originally approached for the job, but Bixby was working on another project and recommended his close friend Martin Varno for the job. Varno, the son of veteran actor Roland Varno, was 21 years old at the time. He met with Roger and Gene Corman, who discussed with him what Varno called [...] "some sort of a weird idea for the picture". They offered Varno a couple hundred dollars for the job, which was below the minimum compensation rates known as [...] "scale", but Varno {{was not part of the}} Writers Guild of America at the time and did not know about the guidelines. He accepted the offer and signed a contract. Although Varno had a rough idea it would be a low-budget film, he said the Cormans set no specific guidelines for him: [...] "I gave them <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> knew pretty much what I was doing, and they sort of got the idea that I wasn't going to use 50,000 extras and things." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bowie {{himself was}} quoted in a 1998 {{interview}} as saying [...] "I really did object to <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> did not write the songs on The Man Who Sold the World. You only have {{to check out the}} chord changes. No-one writes chord changes like that". [...] "The Width of a Circle" [...] and [...] "The Supermen", for example, were already in existence before the sessions began. Ralph Mace played a Moog modular synthesizer borrowed from George Harrison; Mace was a 40-year-old concert pianist who was also head of the classical music department at Mercury Records.|$|E
2500|$|... "Machine {{guns and}} rifles opened {{up on us}} the moment we topped the rise behind which we had formed up. I {{remember}} thinking that the sound of crackling bullets was just like hailstorm on a iron-roofed building, so you may guess what the fusillade was....A whole heap of men and horses went down twenty or thirty yards from the muzzles of the guns. The squadron broke into a few scattered horsemen at the guns and seemed to melt away completely. For a time I, at any rate, had <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was the only man left alive. I was amazed to discover we were the victors".|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, yes; {{you might}} as well try to say {{something}} cheerful, which might do away with <b>the</b> <b>impression.</b> Not <b>that</b> <b>I</b> think it will be of any use; only do not let him think it has been under discussion." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Not,' said Glossin, perceiving he {{had made}} <b>the</b> desired <b>impression,</b> 'not <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am against being civil'; and he slid into Hatteraick's passive hand a bank-note of some value.|$|R
60|$|I {{have more}} than once {{detected}} the milkman winking at the maid with a diabolical suggestion <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was returning from a carouse, and Roundsman 9999 has once or twice followed me a block or two with <b>the</b> evident <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was a burglar returning from a successful evening out. Nevertheless, these various indiscretions have brought me into contact {{with a kind of}} character and phenomena whose existence I might otherwise have doubted.|$|R
2500|$|That is not surprising. In a 1995 {{interview}} Wild nominated {{his most}} significant achievement {{to be the}} building of the Culgoora radio-heliograph and providing the world with a unique eye to view and record moving pictures of rapidly changing solar activity. He observed:most scientific discoveries, had they not been made by the originator, would have been made by somebody else within a year or so or even less. To my mind the most significant discoveries or projects are those which would have eluded other researchers for decades or more. … The [...] revealed a whole range of previously unknown phenomena at a wavelength millions of times longer than the wavelength of all other moving pictures ever taken of the sun. Today, nearly three decades later, the instrument has not been duplicated and the results remain unique. In saying this I do not want to give <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> did it all by myself. I owe much to the CSIRO and the Ford Foundation for providing the resources and to a wonderful bunch of colleagues who built it and made it all work.|$|E
2500|$|Haneke {{dealt with}} the matter since 1992. The work on the script was {{interrupted}} by a writer's block. Haneke normally wrote out the script exactly before the writing process. This time {{the end of the story}} was not clear to him. He began writing in the hope that this would occur to him at work, but this did not happen. [...] "I have tormented myself terribly with the script and I was left with <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have not succeeded in getting the hang of this topic", he said. At the same time the director realized that the Swiss-Canadian Léa Pool with La dernière fugue (2010) had created a similar story, about an old man who is taken care of by his wife. Therefore, he let the project in favor of another. He worked only sporadically on it, until his writer's block loosened and he could finish the script quickly. Haneke wrote it specifically for Trintignant, having already written the scripts for The Piano Teacher (2001) and Caché (2005) specifically for actors (Isabelle Huppert and Daniel Auteuil). Haneke prefers this way of working, because in this way one [...] "writes specifically something that fits to the advantages of each actor and helps to particularly work them out".|$|E
6000|$|... "My sister told me," [...] M. de Bellegarde continued, [...] "that I {{ought to}} come and remove <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had taken such great pains to produce upon you; <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am a lunatic. Did it strike you that I behaved very oddly the other day?" ...|$|E
60|$|Admiration of the {{ingenuity}} {{which had}} woven this smooth and finished texture {{out of the}} ravelled skein was naturally <b>the</b> first <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> felt, on handing the manuscript back to Ezra Jennings. He modestly interrupted the first few words in which my sense of surprise expressed itself, by asking me if the conclusion which he had drawn from his notes was also the conclusion at which my own mind had arrived.|$|R
60|$|Yet as our {{intimacy}} grew {{closer and}} closer, these fancies {{seemed to be}} losing their hold. And often she questioned me concerning my own reminiscences of her shadowy isle. And cautiously I sought to produce <b>the</b> <b>impression,</b> <b>that</b> whatever <b>I</b> had said of that clime, had been revealed to me in dreams; but that in these dreams, her own lineaments had smiled upon me; and hence the impulse which had sent me roving after the substance of this spiritual image.|$|R
6000|$|I {{have been}} under <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> all along <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had an {{unpleasant}} paragraph about the Boers somewhere in my notebook, and also a pleasant one. I have found them now. The unpleasant one is dated at an interior village, and says-- ...|$|R

60|$|Hawking is {{a disappointing}} pursuit, {{owing to the}} {{frequent}} loss of hawks; and can hardly be carried on except in a hawking country, where the sportsman {{has a better chance}} than elsewhere, both of recovering and replacing them; it is impracticable except where the land is open and bare; and it is quite a science. There are some amateurs who will not hear a word of disparagement about their hawks, but <b>the</b> decided <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> bear away with me from all I have learnt, is, that the birds are rarely affectionate or intelligent.|$|R
6000|$|... "Some days since: nay, I can number them--four; it {{was last}} Monday night, a {{singular}} mood came over me: one in which grief replaced frenzy--sorrow, sullenness. I had long had <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> since <b>I</b> could nowhere find you, you must be dead. Late that night--perhaps it might be between eleven and twelve o'clock--ere I retired to my dreary rest, <b>I</b> supplicated God, <b>that,</b> if it seemed good to Him, I might soon be taken from this life, and admitted to that world to come, where there was still hope of rejoining Jane.|$|R
500|$|There is {{a lengthy}} study of Missoula {{in the title}} essay of Jonathan Raban's Driving Home: An American Journey: despite writing that on his arrival, [...] "I had <b>the</b> {{powerful}} <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had driven deep into the Rocky Mountains and somehow arrived in Rotherham or Barnsley," [...] and that [...] "the overall effect [...] was oddly unsettling; the streets too open for comfort, the town too closed in, inducing mild claustrophobia and agoraphobia at the same time", he notes the literary heritage {{of the city and}} its reputation as a [...] "kindly town" [...] (evidenced by its being a place where [...] "odds and ends naturally collected and cohered").|$|R
60|$|He {{closed the}} window, and {{introduced}} us through it in dumb show; but he contrived to give <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was the specimen under glass.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{what are}} you shamming for, and {{frightening}} us in this way?" [...] said Peterkin, smiling through his tears; for the poor boy had been really under <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was dying.|$|E
6000|$|... "'This is my {{secretary}} and manager,' said the colonel. 'By the way, I was under <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> left this door shut just now. I fear {{that you have}} felt the draught.' ...|$|E
6000|$|He showed <b>the</b> varying <b>impressions</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{produced}} {{on his mind}} without the slightest concealment. My separation from Eustace distressed him. My resolution to dispute the Scotch Verdict, and my unjust suspicions of Mrs. Beauly, first amused, then surprised him. It was not, however, until I had described my extraordinary interview with Miserrimus Dexter, and my hardly less remarkable conversation with Lady Clarinda, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> produced my greatest effect on the lawyer's mind. I saw him change color for the first time. He started, and muttered to himself, {{as if he had}} completely forgotten me. [...] "Good God!" [...] I heard him say--"can it be possible? Does the truth lie that way after all?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have had}} a curious and eventful history," [...] he said, when the young {{sergeant}} had finished, [...] "and appear to have conducted yourself with great discretion, readiness, and courage. From what you tell me of your conversation with Colonel Shepherd, I {{have no doubt that}} he formed <b>the</b> same <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> do, from your manner and appearance--that you are of a respectable, if not of good family--and <b>I</b> trust <b>that</b> you will some day discover a clue to your parents. It seems to me that, had the authorities of the place where you were left properly bestirred themselves, they ought {{to have been able to}} find out who you are.|$|R
6000|$|... "It IS an ugly word," [...] said Anne, laughing. [...] "Avonlea {{graveyard}} {{was full}} of old tombstones 'sacred {{to the memory of}} So-and-So, RELICT of the late So-and-So.' It always made me think of something worn out and moth eaten. Why is it that so many of the words connected with death are so disagreeable? <b>I</b> do wish <b>that</b> the custom of calling a dead body 'the remains' could be abolished. I positively shiver when I hear the undertaker say at a funeral, 'All who wish to see the remains please step this way.' It always gives me <b>the</b> horrible <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am about to view the scene of a cannibal feast." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well!" [...] exclaimed Gertrude, outraged. Then, after a pause, [...] "I {{was under}} <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had {{accepted}} the escort of a gentleman." [...] Then, after another pause, Trefusis being quite undisturbed, [...] "How {{do you know that}} I am unhappy?" ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{it was her}} {{indifference}} to <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> myself had made on Mrs Monnerie that nettled me the most. [...] "Why, then, who is Lord B.?" [...] I inquired impatiently at last, pushing back the bandage that had fallen over my eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Nay, dry the {{starting}} tear,' said Charteris cheerfully. 'In the first place, I shouldn't get kept in on a Thursday anyhow. I should be shoved into extra on Saturday. Also, I shrewdly conveyed to the Bargee <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was at Rutton by special permission.' ...|$|E
60|$|These, however, are minor matters {{which are}} {{mentioned}} chiefly {{in order to}} guard against <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that,</b> because <b>I</b> left them unchanged, I approved of them. The permanent interest attaching to these lectures does not spring from the facts which they give. For these, students will refer to Gibbon. They will be valued chiefly for the thoughts which they contain, for the imagination and eloquence which they display, and last, not least, {{for the sake of}} the man, a man, it is true, of a warm heart rather than of a cold judgment, but a man whom, for that very reason, many admired, many loved, and many will miss, almost every day of their life.|$|R
5000|$|Cooper is openly gay; {{according}} to The New York Times, he is [...] "the most prominent openly gay journalist on American television." [...] For years, Cooper avoided discussing {{his private life}} in interviews.On July 2, 2012, however, he gave Andrew Sullivan permission to publish an email that stated, in part: I've begun to consider whether the unintended outcomes of maintaining my privacy outweigh personal and professional principle. It's become {{clear to me that}} by remaining silent on certain aspects of my personal life for so long, I have given some <b>the</b> mistaken <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am trying to hide something—something that makes me uncomfortable, ashamed or even afraid. This is distressing because it is simply not true. ... The fact is, I'm gay, always have been, always will be, and I couldn't be any more happy, comfortable with myself, and proud.|$|R

I {{do not wish to}} revive painful memories, but it cannot be denied that there was, here and there, some slight bickering between us on that occasion. The fault,' said Psmith magnanimously, 'was {{possibly}} mine. I may have been too exacting, too capricious. Perhaps so. However, the fact remains that you conceived the happy notion of getting me into this bank, under <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that,</b> once <b>I</b> was in, you would be able to--if I may use the expression--give me beans. You said as much to me, if I remember. I hate to say it, but don't you think that if you give me the sack, although my work is satisfactory to the head of my department, you will be by way of admitting that you bit off rather more than you could chew? I merely make the suggestion.' ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Crying Blood" [...] is {{the debut}} single by singer V V Brown (also known by her writing alias Geeki). It was {{released}} on 3 November 2008 and {{was accompanied by a}} music video. The song did not chart as it was not eligible to do so. It was released as a limited release on Digital download and 7-inch vinyl.Brown wrote this song after finishing with her mean American boyfriend and returning to England. Despite its lyrical woe, the melody is upbeat. She explained to Q magazine: “That was an accident, actually. I simply wanted to give <b>the</b> <b>impression,</b> musically, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was over him. It’s true he was terribly mean, but ultimately I’m an optimistic sort.”. This song is also featured on Just Dance 2 as a downloadable song.
