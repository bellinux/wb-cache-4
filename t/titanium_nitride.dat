40|$|We have {{performed}} first-principles evolutionary searches for all stable <b>titanium</b> <b>nitrides</b> and have found, {{in addition to}} the well-known rocksalt-type TiN, new ground states Ti_ 3 N_ 2, Ti_ 4 N_ 3, Ti_ 6 N_ 5 at atmospheric pressure, and Ti_ 2 N and TiN_ 2 at higher pressures. The latest nitrogen-rich structure presents encapsulated N_ 2 dumbbells with a N-N distance of 1. 348 Å at 60 GPa and TiN_ 2 is predicted to be mechanically stable (quenchable). Our calculations of the mechanical properties (bulk modulus, shear modulus, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, and hardness) are in excellent agreement with the available experimental data and show that the hardness of <b>titanium</b> <b>nitrides</b> increases with increasing nitrogen content. The hardness of <b>titanium</b> <b>nitrides</b> is enhanced by strengthening directional covalent bonds and disappearance of Ti-Ti metallic bonds. Among the predicted compounds, TiN_ 2 has the highest hardness of 27. 2 GPa. Comment: 8 pages, 7 figure...|$|R
40|$|AISI 316 L {{stainless}} steel (SS) and <b>titanium</b> <b>nitriding</b> were studied {{in a low}} pressure arc-assisted nitriding process where the substrate temperature and the plasma parameters are uncoupled. Lower nitriding temperature limits were explored for constant plasma parameters in Ar–N 2 gas mixtures and substrates at floating potential.

25|$|When the {{transistors}} {{are extremely}} scaled down, {{it is necessary}} to make the gate dielectric layer very thin, around 1nm in state-of-the-art technologies. A phenomenon observed here is the so-called poly depletion, where a depletion layer is formed in the gate polysilicon layer next to the gate dielectric when the transistor is in the inversion. To avoid this problem, a metal gate is desired. A variety of metal gates such as tantalum, tungsten, tantalum nitride, and <b>titanium</b> <b>nitride</b> are used, usually in conjunction with high-κ dielectrics. An alternative is to use fully silicided polysilicon gates, a process known as FUSI.|$|E
500|$|Titanium {{is one of}} the few {{elements}} that burns in pure nitrogen gas, reacting at [...] to form <b>titanium</b> <b>nitride,</b> which causes embrittlement. Because of its high reactivity with oxygen, nitrogen, and some other gases, titanium filaments are applied in titanium sublimation pumps as scavengers for these gases. Such pumps inexpensively and reliably produce extremely low pressures in ultra-high vacuum systems.|$|E
2500|$|An {{additional}} category of anti-reflection coatings {{is the so-called}} [...] "absorbing ARC". These coatings are useful in situations where high transmission through a surface is unimportant or undesirable, but low reflectivity is required. They can produce very low reflectance with few layers, and can often be produced more cheaply, or at greater scale, than standard non-absorbing AR coatings. (See, for example, [...]) Absorbing ARCs often make use of unusual optical properties exhibited in compound thin films produced by sputter deposition. For example, <b>titanium</b> <b>nitride</b> and niobium nitride are used in absorbing ARCs. These {{can be useful in}} applications requiring contrast enhancement or as a replacement for tinted glass (for example, in a CRT display).|$|E

By varying the nitrogen content of the gas atmosphere, the structure and hence the hardness and cavitation erosion behaviour of the laser nitrided layers can be controlled in a wide range.

40|$|Ti-Al {{intermetallic}} coatings on titanium {{have been}} produced by laser surface alloying. A 5 -kW CO 2 laser was employed to melt {{the surface of the}} titanium specimens and to alloy it with aluminium powder in a nitrogen atmosphere.

40|$|AbstractThe nanotribological {{studies are}} needed to develop {{fundamental}} understanding of interfacial phenomena on a smaller scale in nanostructures used in magnetic storage systems and other industrial applications. In several fields of technical application, e. g., in the automotive or aircraft industries, the reduction of friction and wear is a very important aspect with respect to longer lifetimes, increased service intervals and lower operation costs of tools, machines and other devices or mechanically loaded elements. Many researchers have studied tribological properties of various binary thin film materials to investigate various properties like adhesion, hardness and friction coefficients according to the respective applications. The different deposition techniques they used are Unbalanced Magnetron Sputtering. Ion Beam Assisted Deposition, Physical Vapour Deposition etc. Recently ternary nitride based coatings are invesitgated as they exhibit improved tribological, mechanical and thermal properties compared to binary nitride based coatings.

On the other hand titanium oxide is useful as an electrode for fuel cell, solar cell, or electrolysis of water, since it can fix catalyst, dye and enzyme on its surface. In the present study, titanium (Ti) metal was chemically and thermally treated to form nano structure with high specific surface area, conductivity, scratch resistance and ability for catalyst fixation on its surface. Ti metal electrode with nano-network structure composed of <b>titanium</b> <b>nitrides,</b> <b>titanium</b> oxynitride and titanium oxide on its surface was prepared by NaOH and HCl solution treatments and subsequent heat treatments in N 2 gas. The effect of the temperature of heat treatment in N 2 gas on the structure, total surface area and conductivity of the Ti metal surface were studied. The fine network structure with high total surface area was formed on the surfaces of the Ti metal heated at 600 °C to 1000 °C. However, it was partially densified over 900 °C. The electrical conductivity became higher with increasing temperature of the heat treatment because of the formation of the highly conductive <b>titanium</b> <b>nitrides</b> and oxygen deficient titanium oxide. Consequently, the highly conductive Ti metal electrode without reducing its total surface area could be prepared, when it was heated at 850 °C.
