5|$|One of {{the tenets}} of {{population}} genetics since its inception has been that macroevolution (the evolution of phylogenic clades at the species level and above) was solely {{the result of the}} mechanisms of microevolution (changes in gene frequency within populations) operating {{over an extended period of}} time. During the last decades of the 20th century some paleontologists raised questions about whether other factors, such as punctuated equilibrium and group selection operating on the level of entire species and even higher level phylogenic clades, needed to be considered to explain patterns in evolution revealed by statistical analysis of the fossil record. Near the end of the 20th century some researchers in evolutionary developmental biology suggested that interactions between <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> developmental process might have been the source of some of the structural innovations seen in macroevolution, but other evo-devo researchers maintained that genetic mechanisms visible at the population level are fully sufficient to explain all macroevolution.|$|E

5|$|The {{other story}} about the balance between THSR {{construction}} and the environment is the protection plan of “300-year-old camphor tree and the temple”(保護金山面老樹及伯公廟) in the Hsinchu City for more than 10 years. The tree and the temple are located on the main route of the THSR, {{and both of them}} faced removal because of railway construction. The temple -“Local Land God Temple”(伯公廟) established just beside the old tree is the belief center of the people there. In 1998, THSRC adjusted the line and design to keep the tree and temple in their original place and cooperated with local government and people to protect the old tree and the temple until today. Afterwards, together with the local government, <b>the</b> <b>Environment</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Resources Protection Committee, and cultural and historical authorities, THSRC drafted the Hsinchu Old Camphor Tree Medical Plan, which called for the repair of decayed branches as well as measures designed to maintain the long-term growth and the health of the tree.|$|E

The treatments affected the analyzed variables, except for biofertilizer doses and interaction of treatments.

30|$|The {{proposed}} framework allows {{developers to}} generate an executable {{model for the}} management of smart environment devices. To enable the executable model generation, developers provide a model of <b>the</b> considered <b>environment</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> target objective. <b>The</b> <b>environment</b> model is defined by specifying for each device, its states, its state transitions <b>and</b> its effects on <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> parameters. <b>The</b> objectives are defined by specifying <b>the</b> values <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> parameters must take. From <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> model <b>and</b> <b>the</b> objectives are generated a controller and an execution rule. At runtime, the execution rule collects data from <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> <b>and</b> invokes <b>the</b> controller that makes appropriate decisions to reliably achieve the objectives. In the followings, our approach is compared with the related work approaches to show its advantages.|$|R
