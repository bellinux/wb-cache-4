50|$|Older, green coloured, {{suspension}} spheres typically last between 60,000 and 100,000 km. Spheres {{once had}} a <b>threaded</b> <b>plug</b> on top for recharging. Newer spheres do not have this plug, {{but it can be}} retrofitted enabling them to be re-gassed. The sphere membrane has an indefinite life unless run at low pressure, which leads to rupture. Timely recharging, approximately every 3 years, is thus vital. A ruptured membrane means suspension loss at the attached wheel, however, ride height is unaffected. With no springing other than the (slight) flexibility of tyres, hitting a pothole with a flat sphere can bend the suspension parts or dent a wheel rim. In the case of main accumulator sphere failure, the high pressure pump is the only source of braking pressure for the front wheels. Some older cars had a separate front brake accumulator on power steering models.|$|E

The OTPG {{is composed of}} a rigid industrial endoscope, a charge-coupled device camera, and a two degree-of-freedom motion control unit. A sequence of partial wall images of an internal thread are retrieved and reconstructed into a 2 D unwrapped image. Then, a digital image processing and classification procedure is used to normalize, segment, and determine {{the quality of the}} internal thread. The proposed OTPG provides an orientation-free and convenient method for detecting defects such as scratches, collapses, and flaws in an internal thread. Keywords Internal thread.

50|$|Gauge blocks {{are usually}} made either from {{hardened}} alloy tool steels or from cemented carbides (such as tungsten carbide or tantalum carbide). Often the carbide has a hardness of 1500 Vickers hardness. Long series blocks {{are made from}} high-quality steel having cross section (35 × 9 mm) with holes for clamping two slips together. These are also available in carbon steel material. Steel blocks are hardened and tempered. The hardness {{is important because it}} slows down the gauge's rate of wear during use (this is why other kinds of gauges, such as pins, <b>thread</b> <b>plugs,</b> and rings, are also hardened.) The cutting of the blocks to size is accomplished with grinding followed by lapping. Usually no plating or other coating is involved. Blocks are kept very lightly oiled, and are stored and used in dry climate-controlled conditions; unplated, uncoated steel gauge blocks can last for decades without rusting.|$|R

40|$|A {{multistage}} electrophoresis apparatus {{has been}} invented {{for use in}} the separation of cells, protein molecules, and other particles and solutes in concentrated aqueous solutions and suspensions. The design exploits free electrophoresis but overcomes the deficiencies of prior free-electrophoretic separators by incorporating a combination of published advances in mathematical modeling of convection, sedimentation, electro-osmotic flow, and the sedimentation and aggregation of droplets. In comparison with other electrophoretic separators, these apparatuses are easier to use and are better suited to separation in relatively large quantities characterized in the art as preparative (in contradistinction to smaller quantities characterized in the art as analytical). In a multistage electrophoretic separator according to the invention, an applied vertical steady electric field draws the electrically charged particles of interest from within a cuvette to within a collection cavity that has been moved into position of the cuvette. There are multiple collection cavities arranged in a circle; each is aligned with the cuvette for a prescribed short time. The multistage, short-migration-path character of the invention solves, possibly for the first time, the fluid-instability problems associated with free electrophoresis. The figure shows a prototype multistage electrophoretic separator that includes four sample stations and five collection stages per sample. At each sample station, an aqueous solution or suspension containing charged species to be separated is loaded into a cuvette, which is machined into a top plate. The apparatus includes a lower plate, into which 20 collection cavities have been milled. Each cavity is filled with an electrophoresis buffer solution. For the collection of an electrophoretic fraction, the lower plate is rotated to move a designated collection cavity into alignment {{with the opening of the}} cuvette. An electric field is then applied between a non-gassing electrode in the collection cavity and an electrolyte compartment, which is separated from the cuvette by a semipermeable membrane. The electrolyte is refreshed by circulation by use of a peristaltic pump. In subsequent steps, the lower plate is rotated to collect other electrophoretic fractions. Later, the collected fractions are removed from the collection cavities through ports that have <b>threaded</b> <b>plugs.</b> The base of the apparatus contains power supplies and a computer interface. The design includes provisions for monitoring and feedback control of cavity position, electric field, and temperature. The operation of the apparatus can easily be automated, as demonstrated by use of software that has already been written for this purpose...|$|R

Myocardial contrast echograms were recorded in short-axis cross sections of the left ventricle after intracoronary injection of 2 ml hand-agitated sa-line-Renografin solution through a catheter placed in the coronary artery. An echo contrast washout index (t ½) was measured by digital processing computer analysis of successive end-diastolic images obtained by two-dimensional echocardiography during myocardial contrast agent injection. The injection to injection correlation coefficient of these t ½ measurements was satisfactory (r = 0. 87, {{standard error of estimate}} 4. 8 seconds).

However Robert Parker Parrott at the Cold Springs Foundry near the United States Army Military Academy at West Point used the Rodman water core method of casting to produce large bore rifled guns in 200, 300, and 400 pound models. Parrott rifles that had been cast using the Rodman method were inscribed with the initials WC in order to differentiate those guns from ones that had been cast using ordinary methods. Primarily these guns were used on naval vessels especially large monitors.In the 1870s and 1880s efforts focused on converting existing Rodman guns into rifles. 10-inch Rodman smoothbore guns were converted into 8-inch rifles.

5000|$|Over {{the years}} {{variations}} on the basic spark plug design have attempted to provide either better ignition, longer life, or both. Such variations {{include the use of}} two, three, or four equally spaced ground electrodes surrounding the central electrode. Other variations include using a recessed central electrode surrounded by the spark <b>plug</b> <b>thread,</b> which effectively becomes the ground electrode (see [...] "surface-discharge spark plug", below). Also there is the use of a V-shaped notch in the tip of the ground electrode. Multiple ground electrodes generally provide longer life, as when the spark gap widens due to electric discharge wear, the spark moves to another closer ground electrode. The disadvantage of multiple ground electrodes is that a shielding effect can occur in the engine combustion chamber inhibiting the flame face as the fuel air mixture burns. This can result in a less efficient burn and increased fuel consumption.|$|R

5000|$|The {{length of}} the {{threaded}} portion of the plug should be closely matched to {{the thickness of the}} head. If a plug extends too far into the combustion chamber, it may be struck by the piston, damaging the engine internally. Less dramatically, if the <b>threads</b> of the <b>plug</b> extend into the combustion chamber, the sharp edges of the threads act as point sources of heat which may cause pre-ignition; in addition, deposits which form between the exposed threads may make it difficult to remove the plugs, even damaging the threads on aluminium heads in the process of removal. The protrusion of the tip into the chamber also affects plug performance, however; the more centrally located the spark gap is, generally the better the ignition of the air-fuel mixture will be, although experts believe the process is more complex and dependent on combustion chamber shape. On the other hand, if an engine is [...] "burning oil", the excess oil leaking into the combustion chamber tends to foul the plug tip and inhibit the spark; in such cases, a plug with less protrusion than the engine would normally call for often collects less fouling and performs better, for a longer period. In fact, special [...] "anti-fouling" [...] adapters are sold which fit between the plug and the head to reduce the protrusion of the plug for just this reason, on older engines with severe oil burning problems; this will cause the ignition of the fuel-air mixture to be less effective, but in such cases, this is of lesser significance.|$|R
40|$|From 1995 to {{the present}} the {{friction}} stir welding (FSW) process has been under study at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC). This is {{an account of the}} progressive emergence of a set of conceptual tools beginning with the discovery of the shear surface, wiping metal transfer, and the invention of a kinematic model and making possible a treatment of both metallurgical structure formation and process dynamics in friction stir welding from a unified point of view. It is generally observed that the bulk of the deformation of weld metal around the FSW pin takes place in a very narrow, almost discontinuous zone with high deformation rates characteristic of metal cutting. By 1999 it was realized that this zone could be treated as a shear surface like that in simple metal cutting models. At the shear surface the seam is drawn out and compressed and pressure and flow conditions determine whether or not a sound weld is produced. The discovery of the shear surface was followed by the synthesis of a simple 3 - flow kinematic model of the FSW process. Relative to the tool the flow components are: (1) an approaching translational flow at weld speed V, (2) a rotating cylindrical plug flow with the angular velocity of the tool, and (3) a relatively slow ring vortex flow (like a smoke ring) encircling the tool and driven by shoulder scrolls and pin <b>threads.</b> The rotating <b>plug</b> flow picks up an element of weld metal, rotates it around with the tool, and deposits it behind the tool (wiping metal transfer); it forms plan section loops in tracers cut through by the tool. Radially inward flow from the ring vortex component retains metal longer in the rotating plug and outward flow expels metal earlier; this interaction forms the looping weld seam trace and the tongue and groove bimetallic weld contour. The radial components of the translational and ring vortex flows introduce parent metal intrusions into the small grained nugget material close to the tool shoulder; if this feature is pronounced, nugget collapse may result. Certain weld features, in particular internal banding seen in transverse section as onion rings and associated surface ridges called tool marks, have long implied an oscillation flow component, but have only recently been attributed in the literature to tool eccentricity. Rotating plug shape, typically a hollow cylinder flared at the end where it sticks to the shoulder, varies as pressure distribution on the tool determines where sticking occurs. Simplified power input estimates balanced against heat loss estimates give reasonable temperature estimates, explain why the power requirement changes hardly at all over a wide range of RPM s, and yield isotherms that seem to fall along boundaries of parameter windows of operation...|$|R
