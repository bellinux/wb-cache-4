40|$|J-hook {{latching}} mechanism which joins modules of equipment together and holds cargoes in vehicles relatively simple, strong, and self-aligning. Objects brought together into coarse alignment, shaft turned, causing upper object, mounting bracket, and fixed nut to travel downward on left-handed thread and <b>traveling</b> <b>nut</b> upward on right-handed thread. This allows J-hook to turn under spring load and reach under receptacle...|$|E
40|$|Described {{here is a}} {{latching}} {{device for}} latching two items together that has a housing and a shaft mounted to one item such that rotation of the shaft by a sprocket causes the shaft to move longitudinally up and down. The shaft has one end extending beyond the housing with an alignment cone attached to this end for engaging a receptor on the other item. A latch mounted to a shaft by a <b>traveling</b> <b>nut</b> provides a pivot point for the latch so that rotation of the shaft causes the pivot point of the latch to translate along the longitudinal axis of the shaft. Camming surfaces and a camming spring are used for rotating the latch so that the latch will engage and disengage a receptor on the other item...|$|E

40|$|An {{alignment}} positioning {{mechanism for}} correcting and compensating for misalignment of structures to be coupled is disclosed. The mechanism comprises a power screw with {{a base portion}} and a threaded shank portion. A mounting fixture is provided for rigidly coupling said base portion to the mounting interface of a supporting structure with the axis of the screw perpendicular thereto. A <b>traveling</b> ball <b>nut</b> threaded on the power screw is formed with an external annular arcuate surface configured {{in the form of}} a spherical segment and enclosed by a ball nut housing with a conforming arcuate surface for permitting gimballed motion thereon. The ball nut housing is provided with a mounting surface which is positionable in cooperable engagement with the mounting interface of a primary structure to be coupled to the supporting structure. Cooperative means are provided on the ball nut and ball nut housing, respectively, for positioning the ball nut and ball nut housing in relative gimballed position within a predetermined range of relative angular relationship whereby severe structural stresses due to unequal loadings and undesirable bending moments on the mechanism are avoided...|$|R
