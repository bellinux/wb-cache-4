5|$|Worthington {{built the}} Buckwood Inn, an {{exclusive}} resort, with an eighteen-hole golf course designed by A. W. Tillinghast. This {{later became the}} Shawnee Country Club. The course was completed around 1910. In 1913, John McDermott won the Shawnee Open golf tournament at Shawnee-on-Delaware, ahead of top Englishmen Harry Vardon and Ted Ray. After trying unsuccessfully to keep <b>the</b> <b>fairways</b> in shape by grazing sheep on them, Worthington designed the gang mower with three moving wheels. He launched the Shawnee Mower Factory to manufacture it.|$|E

The on-campus shuttle travels to most sections of the school, while the off-campus shuttles travel to housing complexes (<b>The</b> <b>Fairways</b> at Towson, University Village, The Colony, Donnybrook) that students live in {{that are on the}} outskirts of the campus. There is also direct access to the MTA Maryland buses with services connecting to the light rail.|$|E

He continued to have top-10 hits until the mid-1970s, and still performed occasionally {{for the remainder of}} his life. In recent years, audio and video compilations of his music have been released, as well as a biography.|$|E

25|$|In its 2015â€“16 {{listing of}} the best golf courses by state, Golf Digest ranked Oak Tree National #51 in their Americas 100 Greatest Golf Courses. Also, they ranked it second {{in the state of}} Oklahoma. The course was {{redesigned}} by Pete Dye in 2002. The course measures 7,412 yards from the tournament tees and 6,873 yards from the championship tees. However, for the 2006 Senior PGA Championship, the course played to 7,102 yards. Oak Tree has Bent grass for the greens, and Bermuda grass for <b>the</b> <b>fairways.</b> Water comes into play on 13 of the 18 holes. The course and slope rating is 79.3/155 from the tournament tees and 76.4/153 from the championship tees.|$|E
25|$|In November 2013, {{stadium and}} 49ers' {{officials}} initially requested the NFL to not schedule any Monday or Thursday night home games during Levi's Stadium's inaugural season due to parking {{issues in the}} area surrounding the stadium during weekdays. Two months later, in January 2014, the Santa Clara city government was able to secure more than the 21,000 necessary parking spots by approving use of <b>the</b> <b>fairways</b> at the city-owned Santa Clara Golf and Tennis Club (which is located {{to the north of}} the stadium across Tasman Drive). This arrangement is similar to and was modeled upon a longstanding arrangement between the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California and the adjacent Brookside Golf Course, where the golf course was modified to allow for vehicular access to the fairways; they are used for parking only when dry to minimize damage, and any damage that does occur is repaired afterward.|$|E
40|$|Rijkswaterstaat is {{responsible}} for maintaining <b>the</b> <b>fairway</b> of <b>the</b> river Waal for navigation {{for more than a}} hundred years. In the past problem areas, which cause hindrance for navigation and block <b>the</b> <b>fairway,</b> were prevented with structural measures. Dredging was used as a last resort. In 2005 <b>the</b> desired <b>fairway</b> depth was increased from BRV - 2, 5 m to BRV - 2, 8 m which changed the role of dredging in the maintenance of <b>the</b> <b>fairway.</b> <b>The</b> dredging of <b>the</b> <b>fairway</b> is now executed through a performance-based contract. Today dredging is seen more as a permanent measure and is constantly used to maintain <b>the</b> <b>fairway.</b> In <b>the</b> last hundred years an increasing number of measurements have been executed on the river Waal and have been stored in databases. This data is currently hardly used for the day-to-day maintenance of the river system. This research aims at gaining more insight in the dredging efforts needed to maintain <b>the</b> <b>fairway</b> using <b>the</b> available data from Rijkswaterstaat. Former dredging contracts as well as the currently used performance-based contract were studied {{in order to get a}} better understanding of the efforts needed to maintain <b>the</b> <b>fairway</b> for navigation. It was tried to deduce a relation, between the discharge hydrograph and the efforts that are needed to maintain <b>the</b> <b>fairway,</b> in order to obtain an indication of the consequences of expected future changes to the river system. The expected future changes which were studied in this research are changing the currently used river groynes and climate change. The relation found could unfortunately not be used to indicate the possible consequences of changing the groynes on the necessary dredging efforts but it could be used to indicate the consequences of climate change on the necessary dredging efforts. Climate change will cause a major increase in the necessary dredging efforts. River EngineeringHydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
50|$|Pre-green is a golf {{term used}} to {{describe}} the grass between the green and <b>the</b> <b>fairway.</b> Around a foot in width, the grass is slightly shorter than that of <b>the</b> <b>fairway,</b> but longer than the green itself. The pre-green is commonly mistaken for the fringe. The fringe is the change in level from the green to the pre-green. Many courses don't make use of the pre-green, which means the fringe will connect <b>the</b> <b>fairway</b> and <b>the</b> green directly.|$|R
50|$|The {{third stage}} is where players attempt to hit their drives on <b>the</b> <b>fairway.</b> They {{can choose to}} hit up to 3 drives. Getting the drives on <b>the</b> <b>fairway</b> results in getting 1, 2 and 3 points {{respectively}} for the three drives in order. Though missing a drive results in points earned for this challenge resetting to zero. If a player hits all 3 drives in <b>the</b> <b>fairway,</b> they can hit a bonus drive worth 5 points.|$|R

2500|$|In April 1983, the National Park Service chose a new company, Golf Course Specialists, {{to manage}} Langston Golf Course. The company reopened the course by Memorial Day weekend. The company {{considered}} Langston the worst {{golf course in}} the entire D.C. metropolitan area when it took over. The clubhouse had chicken wire over the windows to prevent breakage, iron bars covered all windows and doors, and buildings and the course had been heavily vandalized. The greens were in very bad condition, and poor neighborhood children would sneak onto the course and steal balls in play {{so that they could}} sell them back to golfers. Over the next five years, numerous improvements were made to the course. To discourage kids from stealing golf balls, course manager Wallace [...] "Sarge" [...] McCombs (a former United States Army sergeant) hired many of the children to find lost balls in the traps and rough. The rough was groomed, greens resodded, security patrols increased to reduce daylight and after-hours crime, and a community outreach program implemented. Trash was cleared from <b>the</b> <b>fairways</b> and greens, water coolers were placed at each tee, portable toilets were put on the course at strategic spots, and clubhouse and course etiquette rigidly enforced. The number of golfers climbed from a low of 20,000 in 1981 to 33,000 in 1986 and a projected 40,000 in 1987. Gross revenues also rose significantly, from $70,000 in 1983 to a projected $150,000 in 1987.|$|E
60|$|Since {{this most}} Christian war {{includes}} laying mines in <b>the</b> <b>fairways</b> of traffic, and since these mines may be laid {{at any time}} by German submarines especially built for the work, or by neutral ships, all fairways must be swept continuously day and night. When a nest of mines is reported, traffic must be hung up or deviated till it is cleared out. When traffic comes up Channel it must be examined for contraband and other things; and the examining tugs lie out {{in a blaze of}} lights to remind ships of this. Months ago, when the war was young, the tugs {{did not know what to}} look for specially. Now they do. All this mine-searching and reporting and sweeping, plus the direction and examination of the traffic, plus the laying of our own ever-shifting mine-fields, is part of the Trawler Fleet's work, because the Navy-as-we-knew-it is busy elsewhere. And there is always the enemy submarine with a price on her head, whom the Trawler Fleet hunts and traps with zeal and joy. Add to this, that there are boats, fishing for real fish, to be protected in their work at sea or chased off dangerous areas whither, because they are strictly forbidden to go, they naturally repair, and you will begin to get some idea of what the Trawler and Auxiliary Fleet does.|$|E
