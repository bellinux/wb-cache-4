40|$|Electricity use in many {{buildings}} is increasing, sometimes such that new buildings built to modern standards can have greater energy usage than their predecessors. A major cause is {{increased use of}} appliances such as computer equipment, lighting, and electronics. Increasing standby power consumption and more appliances being left running unnecessarily, compounds these effects. Monitoring equipment should provide insights into these issues, but the few systems currently available are either expensive, invasive, or both. This paper shows a case study where temperature monitoring was used to reduce industrial plant usage, and shows a method of electrical appliance monitoring, using very low cost sensors. Results show that the method can effectively reveal equipment usage patterns.

Tuber rot of potato induced by Ech {{is a threat}} to potato cultivation in the tropics (2), but it is also found in the cooler climates (3). The diploid interspecific hybrid of Solanum spp., DG 88 - 9, and 72 potato cultivars registered in Poland were evaluated for their susceptibility to Ech strain SCRI 4063 at two different <b>temperatures,</b> 30 <b>oC</b> and 20 oC. After incubation the width of decayed tissue was measured (in mm) in the widest part of vertically sliced tubers. All tubers of cultivars and the diploid clone were infected at a <b>temperature</b> 30 <b>oC,</b> but not all were infected at a <b>temperature</b> 20 <b>oC.</b> There were significant differences among cultivars in susceptibility to Ech. The statistical analysis of data (the width of decayed tissue at 30 oC) obtained from 72 cultivars and one diploid clone has defined four groups (mean ± 95 % a confidential interval) : I - 8 cultivars and the diploid clone poorly susceptible (9. 0 ± 2. 1), II - 17 cultivars moderately susceptible (13. 2 ± 2. 3), III - 36 cultivars susceptible (16. 9 ± 2. 1), IV - 11 cultivars strongly susceptible (19, 9 ± 2, 0). The cultivars, which were most susceptible at <b>temperature</b> 30 <b>oC,</b> were more susceptible at <b>temperature</b> 20 <b>oC.</b> The mean diameter of decayed tissue was 15. 9 mm, with a range for individual cultivar from 7. 7 mm to 22. 0 mm. The diploid clone DG 88 - 9, used as resistant standard to tuber soft rot, showed the least infection with the mean value 7. 2 mm. Tubers of 48 cultivars and the clone DG 88 - 9 did not show any symptoms of infection with Ech at a <b>temperature</b> 20 <b>oC.</b> Tubers of 24 cultivars showed partial rotting, since symptoms of infection were observed for three to 10 inoculation sites out of 20 for each cultivar. It was observed that among 9 less infected cultivars at a <b>temperature</b> 30 <b>oC</b> there was only one cultivar with symptoms of infection at a <b>temperature</b> 20 <b>oC.</b> On the contrary, in the group of 11 cultivars highly infected cultivars at a <b>temperature</b> 30 <b>oC,</b> 7 showed symptoms of infection at a <b>temperature</b> 20 <b>oC.</b> The expression of potato resistance to bacteria Ech differs depending on the temperature. Temperature influences the bacterial growth rate as well as the wound-induced suberization and periderm formation in potato tubers. The wound healing occurs most rapidly at 25 °C, and is delayed at 10 or 15 °C, while a temperature of 35 °C prevents the periderm formation and retards suberization (4). Our observations are in agreement with the statement of Perombelon et al. (5) that Ech could be a threat to potato in warmer countries but also in Central Europe due to warming climate. vokMyynti MTT Tietopalvelut 31600 Jokioine...|$|R

The optima of the responses of the adequate models found that the propagation velocity of Pleurotus ostreatus AMRL 141 depends on high temperature, high wheat straw content and high humidity. In the second aim investigated the biodegradation of insecticide lindane by two fungi Pleurotus ostreatus AMRL 141 and Ganoderma australe AMRL 315 in sterile contaminated soil for the period of two weeks. In this part of the thesis two experiments were completed. A solid-state substrate, soil and wheat straw, was inoculated with the two fungi and investigated their ability to biodegrade one of the most persistent environmental pollutants, the insecticide lindane. An orthogonal one-half fractional Central Composite Design (CCD) of experiments was used to construct second order response surfaces with five design factors (variables) investigated were <b>temperature</b> (<b>oC),</b> humidity (% in soil-straw mixture), straw content (% in soil-straw mixture), lindane content (ppm in soil) and nitrogen content (ppm in soil). The optima of responses of the adequate models for Pleurotus ostreatus AMRL 141 were found to be biodegradation / biomass 55. 6 μg / g. The optima of the response for Ganoderma australe AMRL 315 of the adequate models were found to be biodegradation/biomass 56. 9 μg / g. The final aim was the study of an in- situ technology such as Landfarming. Examined the biodegradation of lindane by Pleurotus ostreatus AMRL 141 in non sterile contaminated soil by using landfarming technology for the period of two and four weeks. A Multilevel Factorial design was used to construct a second order response surface with two design factors namely: straw content (%) and lindane content (ppm). The optima of the adequate models for the period of four weeks were found to be: biodegradation/biomass 0. 15 μg / mg. Contamination of soils is one of the major problems facing the world today.

Generalized additive models revealed that high C. edentulus catches were associated withfew boat loadings of large-sized fishes, which were conserved in higher boat storage temperatures and attained high market prices. Our long-term study stressed that variations on C. edentulus fishery were related to changes on boat storage temperature, fish size, price paid per kg, and frequency of landings, and that these descriptors are correlated with C. edentulus ecological traits and high phytoplankton availability. Nevertheless, further studies should be performed to address whether less evident factors, such as the fluctuation of concurrent Sardinella brasiliensis stock, would explain the temporal dynamics of C. edentulus stocks in Guanabara Bay. C. edentulus {{accounts for}} the major fishery resource in Guanabara Bay, but there are only few studies about its captures. This study analyzed the long term changes on C. edentulus catches in Guanabara Bay, focusing especially on temporal variation on capture effort, boat storage temperature, and fish price and size. We assessed the 2002 - 2011 database of fish landings at the pier of Rubi S.

40|$|Valproic acid is an {{anticonvulsant}} drug that works {{by increasing the}} levels ofγ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Determination of valproic acid is quite difficultbecause it has no chromophore groups in its structure. Aa analytical method usinggas chromatography (GC) with flame ionization detector for the determination ofvalproic acid in human plasma has been developed and optimized. Valproic acid wasextracted from plasma by liquid-liquid extraction method using diethyl ether. Theoptimum analysis conditions for valproic acid in plasma were achieved by regulatedgas chromatography injector and detector at a <b>temperature</b> of 250 <b>oC</b> and temperatureprogramming with an initial <b>temperature</b> of 70 <b>oC</b> and 5 <b>oC</b> <b>temperature</b> increasingper minute until a <b>temperature</b> of 100 <b>oC,</b> then held for 1 minute.

40|$|Abstract—The {{composite}} flour blend {{consisting of}} corn, pearl millet, black gram and wheat bran in {{the ratio of}} 80 : 5 : 10 : 5 was taken to prepare the extruded product and their effect on physical properties of extrudate was studied. The extrusion process was conducted in laboratory by using twin screw extruder. The physical characteristics evaluated include lateral expansion, bulk density, water absorption index, water solubility index, and rehydration ratio and moisture retention. The Central Composite Rotatable Design (CCRD) was used to decide the level of processing variables i. e. feed moisture content (%), screw speed (rpm), and barrel <b>temperature</b> (<b>oC)</b> for the experiment. The data obtained after extrusion process were analyzed by using response surface methodology. A second order polynomial model for the dependent variables was established to fit the experimental data. The numerical optimization studies resulted in 127 °C of barrel temperature, 246 rpm of screw speed, and 14. 5 % of feed moisture as optimum variables to produce acceptable extruded product. The responses predicted by the software for the optimum process condition resulted in lateral expansion 126 %, bulk density 0. 28 g/cm 3, water absorption index 4. 10 g/g, water solubility index 39. 90 %, rehydration ratio 544 % and moisture retention 11. 90 % with 75 % desirability.

40|$|Drying {{of solid}} {{particles}} is generally {{divided into three}} periods: a short initial heating period, a constant drying rate period, and a falling drying rate period. Drying in a fixed under various drying conditions was experimentally studied. The main goals of the measurements were to calculate the heat transfer coefficient {{based on the measured}} values, and to evaluate the validity of the constant drying rate period. The exact duration of the constant drying period concerning the entire bed is short. The calculated heat transfer coefficients seem to be somewhat reasonable.

40|$|In Oso Bay, a {{wastewater}} treatment plant acts {{as a source of}} eutrophication and may have measureable impact on the health of the bay. The objectives of this study were to create a model for modeling dissolved oxygen concentrations over time and to determine if eutrophication caused by the {{wastewater treatment}} plant is harmful to the bay. Continuous monitoring of environmental variables was carried out at 6 stations in Oso Bay over a 9 -month period beginning in February and ending in December of 2013. Variables measured were water <b>temperature</b> (<b>oC),</b> pH, salinity (ppt), conductivity (mS), depth (meters), turbidity (nephilometric turbidity units), dissolved oxygen in both % saturation and concentration (mg/L), and chlorophyll-? concentration (?g/L). Grab samples of chlorophyll concentration (?g/L), total suspended solids (mg/L), and nutrient concentrations (?M) were also taken throughout the sampling period. Nutrients of interest were phosphate (PO_(4)), silicates (SiO_(4)), ammonium (NH_(4)), and nitrate+/-nitrite (NO_(x)). Hypoxia was observed at each of the stations in the bay and fluctuated on a diel cycle. Temperature, salinity, and temporal variability were significant factors in explaining the variance in dissolved oxygen concentrations (P <. 0001) and were used to model dissolved oxygen variance (R^(2) =. 7810). It is likely that the respiratory patterns of phytoplankton and bacteria also influence dissolved oxygen concentrations in Oso Bay, and that this is an indirect result of the discharge from the {{wastewater treatment plant}}...|$|E
