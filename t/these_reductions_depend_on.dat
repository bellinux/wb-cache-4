40|$|Hydrogen is {{an energy}} carrier {{able to be}} {{produced}} from domestic, zero-carbon sources and consumed by zero-pollution devices. A transition to a hydrogen-based economy could therefore potentially respond to climate, air quality, and energy security concerns. In a hydrogen economy, both mobile and stationary energy needs could be met through the reaction of hydrogen (H 2) with oxygen (O 2). This study applies a full fuel cycle approach to quantify the energy, greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs), and cost implications associated with a large transition to hydrogen in the United States. It explores a national and four metropolitan area transitions in two contrasting policy contexts: a "business-as-usual" (BAU) context with continued reliance on fossil fuels, and a "GHG-constrained" context with policies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. A transition in either policy context faces serious challenges, foremost among them from the highly inertial investments {{over the past century}} or so in technology and infrastructure based on petroleum, natural gas, and coal. A hydrogen transition in the USA could contribute to an effective response to climate change by helping to achieve deep reductions in GHG emissions by mid-century across all sectors of the economy; however, <b>these</b> <b>reductions</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> the use of hydrogen to exploit clean, zero-carbon energy supply options.

This is true even in the presence of banking and borrowing provisions in existing emissions trading programs. Nonetheless, many have argued that such provisions can reduce price volatility and lower costs in the face of uncertainty, despite any theoretical or empirical evidence. This paper develops a model and solves for optimal banking and borrowing behavior with uncertain cost shocks that are serially correlated. We show that while banking does reduce price volatility and lowers costs, the degree of <b>these</b> <b>reductions</b> <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> the persistence of shocks. For plausible parameter values related to U. S. climate change policy, we find that bankable quantities eliminate about 20 percent of the cost difference between price and nonbankable quantities. welfare, prices, quantities, climate change...|$|R
40|$|Particulate fume {{generation}} {{rates and}} fume composition have been measured {{for a range}} of continuous wire arc welding consumables as a function of power supply type. Welding wires considered included gas-shielded cored wires of the rutile-flux, basic-flux and metal core types, for joining structural steels; gas-shielded solid and flux-cored wires for stainless steel; and an open-arc surfacing wire. The range of power supply types used included conventional (transformer-rectifier) DC units, conventional (transistor switched) pulsed supplies as well as both low frequency and high frequency inverter-based power supplies. The inverter type power supplies were used in both the DC and pulsed modes. In all cases fume measurements were made at average welding currents at the low and high ends of the normal operating ranges. Significant decreases in fume formation rate, compared to that from conventional DC power supplies, were found for several combinations of power source and consumable type. The magnitude of <b>these</b> <b>reductions</b> <b>depended</b> <b>on</b> the particular power source/wire combination. For the cored joining wires for structural steels the reductions in fume formation rates were generally in the range 20 to 50 % with the most consistent reductions occurring with the conventional-pulsed and pulsed high frequency inverter supplies. Both the solid and cored wires for stainless steel also showed considerable reductions in fume generation rate with certain power supplies. Reductions of about 60 % compared to those from conventional DC power supplies were found from both stainless steel wire types with the most consistent reductions occurring with the conventional-pulsed power supply. Fume generation rates from the open-arc surfacing wire were found to be reduced by 30 to 50 % in some instances and again the most consistent reduction was with the conventional-pulsed supply. Chemical analyses of the collected fume indicated that in most instances power source type did not have a major influence on the chemical composition. This was certainly the case for the flux-cored wires for structural steel. However the results for the stainless steel and hardfacing wires suggested that the lowest hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) levels were achieved with the conventional DC power source...|$|R

2500|$|A 2007 joint {{study by}} the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) and the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) {{similarly}} found that the introduction of PHEVs into America’s consumer vehicle fleet could achieve significant greenhouse gas emission reductions. The EPRI-NRDC report estimates that, between 2010 and 2050, a shift toward PHEV use could reduce GHG emissions by 3.4 to 10.4 billion metric tons. The magnitude of <b>these</b> <b>reductions</b> would ultimately <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> the level of PHEV market penetration and the carbon intensity of the US electricity sector.

40|$|Plug-in {{electric}} vehicles (PEVs) {{have the potential}} to achieve deep greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions. However, the magnitude of <b>these</b> <b>reductions</b> <b>depends</b> largely <b>on</b> the source(s) of electricity, which can vary regionally and over time, making it unclear how policymakers should regulate PEVs over the short and long-term. To contribute to this discussion, I model the short and long-term operational (source-to-wheels) greenhouse gas emissions intensity of PEVs in the Canadian provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, and Ontario. I use empirical data on vehicle preferences, driving patterns, and potential recharge access from the Canadian Plug-in Electric Vehicle Survey (n= 1754) to construct a temporally explicit model of PEV usage and emissions over the short-term. Fleet-wide emissions intensity of PEVs varies substantially between the three regions studied, with the greatest reduction potential in British Columbia (78 - 99 %), followed by Ontario (58 - 92 %) and Alberta (34 - 41 %) relative to conventional (gasoline) vehicles. I then model the potential long-term dynamics of technology, behaviour, and emissions with the CIMS energy-economy model under three policy scenarios. Emissions intensity of electricity decreases by at least one-third by 2050 even under current policies, with the deepest reductions in Alberta (64 %). Consequently, by 2050, fleet average PEV emissions are 23 - 40 % (BC), 51 - 68 % (Alberta), and 25 - 40 % (Ontario) below 2015 levels. Despite the large range of emissions intensities between regions and over time, PEVs offer substantial GHG emissions benefits compared to conventional vehicles. Therefore, policy makers should look to design policies that concurrently promote vehicle electrification and decarbonisation of the electricity supply to help achieve long-term mitigation targets...|$|R
40|$|Both {{satellite}} and ground-based broadband albedo measurements over rough and complex terrain show several limitations concerning feasibility and representativeness. To assess these limitations {{and understand the}} effect of surface roughness on albedo, firstly, an intrasurface radiative transfer (ISRT) model is combined with albedo measurements over different penitente surfaces on Glaciar Tapado in the semi-arid Andes of northern Chile. Results of the ISRT model show effective albedo reductions over the penitentes up to 0. 4 when comparing the rough surface albedo relative to the albedo of the flat surface. The magnitude of <b>these</b> <b>reductions</b> primarily <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> the opening angles of the penitentes, but {{the shape of the}} penitentes and spatial variability of the material albedo also play a major role. Secondly, the ISRT model is used to reveal the effect of using albedo measurements at a specific location (i. e., apparent albedo) to infer the true albedo of a penitente field (i. e., effective albedo). This effect is especially strong for narrow penitentes, resulting in sampling biases of up to ± 0. 05. The sampling biases are more pronounced when the sensor is low above the surface, but remain relatively constant throughout the day. Consequently, it is important to use a large number of samples at various places and/or to locate the sensor sufficiently high in order to avoid this sampling bias of surface albedo over rough surfaces. Thirdly, the temporal evolution of broadband albedo over a penitente-covered surface is analyzed to place the experiments and their uncertainty into a longer temporal context. Time series of albedo measurements at an automated weather station over two ablation seasons reveal that albedo decreases early in the ablation season. These decreases stabilize from February onwards with variations being caused by fresh snowfall events. The 2009 / 2010 and 2011 / 2012 seasons differ notably, where the latter shows lower albedo values caused by larger penitentes. Finally, a comparison of the ground-based albedo observations with Landsat and MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) -derived albedo showed that both satellite albedo products capture the albedo evolution with root mean square errors of 0. 08 and 0. 15, respectively, but also illustrate their shortcomings related to temporal resolution and spatial heterogeneity over small mountain glaciers. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Concerns {{about the}} {{aviation}} 2 ̆ 7 s environmental impact have prompted research efforts around the world. Much {{of this research}} has focused on changes to future aircraft and engine designs. However, it {{will take a long time}} for these changes to be developed and propagate through the operational fleet in sufficient numbers to have a significant impact on overall emission levels. Until then, operational mitigations that reduce the environmental impacts of existing aircraft will be the most effective strategies. ^ Part I of this thesis involved the identification and qualitative assessment of operational changes that could mitigate aviation’s environmental footprint in the near-term. This resulted in the development of a comprehensive list of mitigation strategies that indicated environmental mitigation potential of various operational changes. ^ Part II of this research effort focused on a specific mitigation measure, that is, the use of end-around taxiways at high-traffic airports with parallel runways. An explicit evaluation of the environmental implications of these taxiways at a candidate airport, DFW (Dallas/Fort-Worth International Airport) was conducted. ^ Observed usage patterns indicated that the use of the end-around taxiway varied significantly on a daily basis. Since operations on the taxiway did not follow strict procedures, there existed the potential to develop procedures for the effective use of the end-around taxiway, in terms of surface fuel burn reduction. ^ A focused investigation on a short taxi segment in the southeast quadrant at DFW revealed that that, while the end-around taxiway shows significant promise in terms of fuel burn and emissions <b>reduction,</b> <b>these</b> benefits <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> the manner of operation of the taxiway. Factors such as traffic conditions on adjacent runways, traffic flow direction, arrival time of aircraft, and the specific aircraft type play a major role in extracting environmental benefits from end-around taxiways. For example, the results showed that the average fuel burn for aircraft using the end-around taxiway was less than the average fuel burn of aircraft using a conventional taxiway during a select portion of the day, specifically, between 5 pm and 1 am. ^ Decision rule-based studies showed that always or never using the end-around taxiway did not bring about environmental benefits. Further, implementation of decision rules based on the results of this research showed promise in terms of fuel burn reduction. Hence, better understanding of the factors that affect endaround taxiway operations and the manner in which they should be used could lead to the development of improved taxiway procedures that maximize the environmental benefits of the EAT. ...|$|R
