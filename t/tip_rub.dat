40|$|Rotor {{test rigs}} which {{simulate}} transient dynamic {{events such as}} blade <b>tip</b> <b>rub</b> with inner surface of casing require high frequency data acquisition capability. Data acquisition from a rotating component is conventionally done with a slip-ring arrangement or telemetric transmission. While slip rings introduce noise into the signal, the telemetric transmission works {{out to be very}} expensive. As an alternate solution, a novel data acquisition system is designed in order to acquire and store data for a short duration of time and at a high sampling rate of 35 kHz. This system is calibrated through standard tests and provides a simple and efficient mode of data capture. By virtue of being mounted on the rotor, it eliminates the need of transreceiver system and hence the associated signal noise. The system is designed and tested to sustain centrifugal loads corresponding to a maximum speed of 2000 rpm...|$|E
40|$|Preliminary {{acoustic}} {{studies have}} indicated that low-density, open-cell, metal foams may be suitable acoustic liner material for noise suppression in high by-pass engines. Metal foam response under simulated <b>tip</b> <b>rub</b> conditions was studied to assess whether its durability would be sufficient for the foam to serve both as a rub strip above the rotor as well as an acoustic treatment. Samples represented four metal alloys, nominal cell dimensions ranging from 60 to 120 cells per inch (cpi), and relative densities ranging from 3. 4 to 10 percent. The resulting rubbed surfaces were relatively smooth and the open cell structure of the foam was not adversely affected. Sample relative density appeared to have significant influence on the forces induced by the rub event. Acoustic responses of various surface preparations were measured using a normal incidence tube. The results {{of this study indicate that}} the foam s open-cell structure was retained after rubbing and that the acoustic absorption spectra variation was minimal...|$|E

Silicon carbide and silicon nitride structures were selected for study since an initial analysis of the problem gave these materials the greatest potential for development into a successful materials system. Segments of silicon nitride and silicon carbide materials over a range of densities, processed by various methods, a honeycomb structure of silicon nitride and ceramic blade tip inserts fabricated from both materials by hot pressing were tested singly and in combination. The evaluations included wear under simulated engine blade <b>tip</b> <b>rub</b> conditions, thermal stability, impact resistance, machinability, hot gas erosion and feasibility of fabrication into engine components. The silicon nitride honeycomb and low-density silicon carbide using a selected grain size distribution gave the most promising results as rub-tolerant shroud liners. Ceramic blade tip inserts made from hot-pressed silicon nitride gave excellent test results. Their behavior closely simulated metal tips. Wear {{was similar to that}} of metals but reduced by a factor of six...|$|E

40|$|International audienceLoss of a blade from {{a running}} {{turbofan}} rotor introduces not only huge imbalance into the dynamical system rather {{it makes the}} entire rotor asymmetric as well. In a nonsymmetric rotor, the various terms of mass, gyroscopic and stiffness matrices also become time-dependent. In this paper, all the dynamical equations include {{the effect of the}} rotary inertia and gyroscopic moments as a result of both shaft bending as well as staggered blades flexing in-and-out of the plane of the disk. The governing equations also account for internal material damping in the shaft and the external damping in the support bearing system. In addition to the unbalance load at the disk location, the shaft may also be subjected to a torque and axial forces. Here, the fan blades are modeled as pre-twisted thin shallow shells. They have coupled flexural–torsional motion in the lateral out-of-plane direction as well as extensional degrees-of-freedom in the longitudinal spanwise direction of the blade airfoil. The effect of blade <b>tip</b> <b>rub</b> forces being transmitted to the shaft are analyzed in terms of the dynamic stability of the rotor, especially during windmilling...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSevere rubs between {{gas turbine}} blades and engine casings can {{in extreme cases}} result in {{damaging}} blade vibration levels and rapid loss of casing lining material. Even for more minor rubs, the wear in the lining material will result in increase tip gaps and a consequent loss in efficiency. Major rub events are extremely rare in practice, and there is seldom any useful diagnostic evidence of {{the root cause of}} the behaviour. Moreover, traditional analysis methods are not suitable for exploring the wide range of potential conditions under which an unstable vibration response might be initiated. A new modelling technique has been developed for modelling blade casing rubs which includes a detailed model of the interaction with liner wear. The method is time based, but is very efficient, enabling a wide range of initiating conditions to be explored. A series of examples have been developed to firstly: demonstrate the method is robust and reliable, and secondly: to investigate potential interaction phenomena under representative simulated conditions. The method has been applied to a real blade example, for which severe wear is known to have occurred. The method predicts that instability may occur above a threshold level of <b>tip</b> <b>rub</b> severity, and also demonstrates the improvement in an alternative blade design for which rub tolerance is known to be superior...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{innovation}} is to reduce aircraft noise in the communities surrounding airports by significantly attenuating the noise generated by the turbomachinery, and enhancing safety by providing a containment barrier for a blade failure. Acoustic liners are used in today's turbofan engines to reduce noise. The amount of noise reduction from an acoustic liner {{is a function of}} the treatment area, the liner design, and the material properties, and limited by the constraints of the nacelle or casement design. It is desirable to increase the effective area of the acoustic treatment to increase noise suppression. Modern turbofan engines use wide-chord rotor blades, which means there is considerable treatment area available over the rotor tip. Turbofan engines require containment over the rotors for protection from blade failure. Traditional methods use a material wrap such as Kevlar integrated with rub strips and sometimes metal layers (sandwiches). It is possible to substitute the soft rub-strip material with an open-cell metallic foam that provides noise-reduction benefits and a sacrificial material in the first layer of the containment system. An open-cell foam was evaluated that behaves like a bulk acoustic liner, serves as a <b>tip</b> <b>rub</b> strip, and can be integrated with a rotor containment system. Foams can be integrated with the fan-containment system to provide sufficient safety margins and increased noise attenuation. The major innovation is the integration of the foam with the containment...|$|E
40|$|The HPTR blades {{were found}} to have damages in the form of peeling off of coating and heat effects. The blades were also covered with molten and {{solidified}} metal rich in titanium and oxygen. Evidences suggest that severe <b>tip</b> <b>rubbing</b> was responsible for the crack initiation at the coating- base material interface. The crack then propagated along the interface resulting in peeling off of coating. Due to loss of coating, the blade material was exposed to high temperatures with subsequent degradation of the microstructure. There were no abnormalities either in the coating or in the coating-base material interface. The coating thickness was measured to be about 65 m...|$|R
40|$|The damaged/failed {{compressor}} stator and rotor blades of an aeroengine were analyzed. All the blades {{were found to}} have failed by fatigue. The fatigue cracks in the stator blades have initiated at the under cut of the leading edge hub. Stress concentrators such as rough filing marks and rough EDM surface were found responsible for the fatigue crack initiation. In the case of rotor blades, fatigue cracks initiated from either side of the airfoil with multiple origins and propagated to form through thickness cracks. No metallurgical abnormalities were responsible for fatigue crack initiation and hence fatigue appears to be stress related. Evidences suggest that <b>tip</b> <b>rubbing</b> with the casing would have caused excessive bending stresses on the blade resulting in fatigue crack initiation. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{compressor}} rotor blade in question had failed by fatigue. There were two fatigue {{cracks in the}} airfoil of the blade: one in the longitudinal direction and the other, in the transverse direction of the blade airfoil. Analysis shows that a longitudinal crack had developed on the concave surface of the airfoil probably due to <b>tip</b> <b>rubbing.</b> It appears that once the tip clearance was established by wear, this crack had ceased to propagate. Subsequently, another fatigue crack had initiated on the existing longitudinal crack due to notch effect, which eventually propagated progressively through the blade thickness leading to fracture. The microstructure and {{the composition of the}} blade material conform to Ti-alloy of IMI 550 specification. No metallurgical and/or mechanical abnormalities were responsible for the fatigue crack initiation...|$|R
40|$|The {{fan case}} in a jet engine is {{required}} to contain a fan blade in the rare event of a blade loss during operation. Because of its function, the fan case is the largest structural component in high-bypass-ratio turbofan engines used in commercial aircraft. Therefore, the use of lighter and stronger materials would be advantageous in most engines and is practically a necessity in the latest generation of high-bypass engines. Small panels, 7 in. wide by 7 in. long, {{of a number of}} metallic alloys were impact tested at room temperature with a 0. 50 -caliber blunt-nose titanium alloy projectile at the NASA Glenn Research Center (ref. 1). These metallic systems included several high-strength aluminum (Al) alloys, Al-based laminates, aluminum metal matrix composites (Al-MMCs), nickel-base superalloys (Inconel 718 and 625), several titanium (Ti) alloys in different heat treated conditions, 304 L stainless steel, a stainless-steel-based laminate, and a high strength steel (Nitronic 60). It was determined that a simple Co-base alloy (Haynes 25) had the best impact resistance on an areal weight basis. Haynes 25 was at least 10 percent better than IMI 550, the best titanium alloy tested to date, and it was far superior to other metals, especially at higher impact velocities (greater than 1100 ft/sec). Because this material could be ideal for fan containment applications in supersonic aircraft as a replacement for titanium, impact tests were also conducted at 371 oC and compared with results from alloys tested at elevated temperature under previous programs (i. e., Inconel 718, Ti- 6242, M- 152, Timetal 21 S, and Aeromet 100). Although cobalt-base alloys are used in some high-temperature engine applications, to our knowledge they are not used in any containment systems. Advantages of cobalt over titanium include lower cost, easier processing, better high-temperature strength, and no fire hazard if <b>tip</b> <b>rub</b> occurs. Future plans include testing of lightweight sandwich panels with Haynes 25 as a core material {{in the form of a}} foam or lattice block structure and scaling up the current tests by using blade-simulating projectiles impacting large plates and half rings...|$|E

40|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{understand}} how surface contacts affect friction, and {{to bridge the gap}} between single contact and large scale friction studies, silicon and PDMS multi-tip arrays were produced in the McGill Microfabrication Facility.

Changes in tip ordering could be correlated to changes in the diffraction pattern. Values for tip-to-tip separation were extracted from the diffraction pattern and it was found that the PDMS tip array compressed by 10 % after sliding. Simulations of an AFM <b>tip</b> <b>rubbing</b> along an ionic surface were also performed.

40|$|LecturePg. 21 - 30 The {{first task}} in {{extending}} {{the life of}} gas turbine parts is to develop meaningful life trend and aging characteristics for each material. Components that have reached their critical life limit can then be hot isostatic press (HIP) rejuvenated and returned to service.

Blades which have suffered impact damage or <b>tip</b> <b>rubs</b> can often be restored by welding. However, it is important to analyse in detail the stress distribution in each blade and to consider the mechanical and metallurgical characteristics of the airfoil geometry, weld configuration and filler metal strength. Stress profiles and life predictions are calculated for weld repaired turbine blades, comparing low strength and high strength filler metal welds. The stress levels in the tip repaired region and in the hole region of a blade with a lashing wire are calculated using finite element analysis. The results indicate that, although a lower strength repair is acceptable in the tip area, it will cause reduced life in a notch or lashing wire hole application...|$|R
40|$|An {{analytical}} model was constructed {{to predict the}} magnitude of stresses produced by rubbing a turbine blade against its tip seal. This model used a linearized approach to the problem, after a parametric study, found that the nonlinear effects were of insignificant magnitude. The important input parameters to the model were: the arc through which rubbing occurs, the turbine rotor speed, normal force exerted on the blade, and the rubbing coefficient of friction. Since {{it is not possible}} to exactly specify some of these parameters, values were entered into the model which bracket likely values. The form of the forcing function was another variable which was impossible to specify precisely, but the assumption of a half-sine wave with a period equal to the duration of the rub was taken as a realistic assumption. The {{analytical model}} predicted resonances between harmonics of the forcing function decomposition and known harmonics of the blade. Thus, it seemed probable that blade <b>tip</b> <b>rubbing</b> could be at least a contributor to the blade-cracking phenomenon.

40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} the present paper is to study {{interaction}} phenomena between an abradable material (M 601) and a titanium alloy (TA 6 V). This interaction which can occur in an aircraft engine when the rotating blade <b>tips</b> <b>rub</b> on the compressor casing, is analyzed on an experimental laboratory set-up. Only orthogonal cutting conditions are considered in this preliminary study to monitor the load evolution with velocity. The experimental results obtained for a range of velocities 10 < V < 107 m/s and for a range interaction depth 0. 05 < t 1 < 0. 5 mm are presented. After analysis of measurements, the mean interaction force increases proportionally to the interaction depth increment. The effects of the contact geometry on the loads, especially the radius of the edge, are investigated. The increase of the radius value for a given interaction depth increases the load value. This work provides new basic data for behaviour laws introduced in numerical models simulating the interaction between the blade tip and the compressor casing in turbine engine applications.

40|$|There was an {{incidence}} to {{an aircraft}} wherein after flight, pilot noticed “Decelerate Right Engine” caption on MFWS along with longitudinal thud. Also, there was momentary display of “Right Engine Vibration” caption. Following this, the pilot {{switched off the}} RH engine and the aircraft landed with one engine (port). Boroscopic examination of the affected engine revealed damages in the turbine area, mostly concentrated in and around LP turbine. On strip examination, {{it was found that}} the LPTR blades, and a labyrinth with the LP turbine disc were severely damaged. A few of these damaged components, viz., (a) fractured and dislodged labyrinth support ring of LP turbine disc, (b) fractured and dislodged labyrinth, (c) parts of LPTR disc containing the fracture surface, (d) LPTR blades, and (e) lock and pin of LPTR blades retainer ring were sent to this laboratory for establishing the probable cause(s) of failure. Examination revealed that the damages to LPTR blades were mostly confined to the tip region except for one where the blade had fractured in the airfoil at one-third height from the blade root platform. Evidences suggested that the damages to the LPTR blades were caused due to <b>tip</b> <b>rubbing</b> with the turbine casing. Fractographic examination confirmed that the fracture in all the blades was by overload. None of the blades showed any signatures of progressive failure. The damages on the lock and pin of LPTR blades retainer ring were also found to be secondary in nature. A part of the labyrinth was retrieved from the damaged engine. It was found mangled and separated from the labyrinth support ring with the LP turbine disc. No pins were available with the labyrinth. The fractured ends of the labyrinth were severely damaged. Fractographic examination showed dimple rupture wherever the fracture features were preserved, indicating failure under overload. The labyrinth support ring got completely separated from the LP turbine disc. Again, only a part of this ring was available for examination. But, the entire mating fracture surface of the ring was available with the disc. Fracture surface analysis showed that separation of the labyrinth support ring from the disc was by overload fracture. The force acted on the support ring was in the radial direction from outside to inside. Further examination of the separated labyrinth support ring showed presence of cracks in four pin holes, located in a sector adjacent to each other. The cracks were located at the edge of the holes on the free surface. It was confirmed through scanning electron fractographic study that these cracks were progressive in nature and they had propagated by fatigue mechanism. From the laboratory investigation, it could not be established whether or not these cracks have bearing on the separation of the labyrinth support ring from LP turbine disc. The presence of fatigue cracks, however, does indicate some distress at the pin holes originating either from assembly or during engine run. Considering the overall damages to various components of the engine in and around LP turbine and the laboratory investigation, it appears that the failure in the labyrinth was due to some location specific problem(s). Analysis also suggests that the overload fracture of labyrinth support ring is indicative of sudden overload on this component during the engine run. Although it was not possible to establish as to what caused this sudden overload, it is believed that the detachment of labyrinth support ring was the first in the chain of events that led to engine failure. In view of this, it is suggested that various possibilities that could lead to sudden overload on the labyrinth support ring of the LP turbine disc be investigated. It also needs to be investigated whether or not there could be any common cause(s) which is responsible for generation of fatigue cracks at the pin holes as well as the separation of the labyrinth support ring from LP turbine disc. Laboratory test results showed that the materials used for fabrication of the components in question conform to specification in terms of chemical composition. No comments can be offered on the microstructure and hardness parameters because of the insufficient data made available to this laboratory. However, based on the overall understanding of the failure, any metallurgical abnormality leading to separation of the labyrinth support ring appears to be a remote possibility...|$|R
