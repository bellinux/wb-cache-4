5|$|In {{the early}} days of Twitter, tweets were stored in MySQL {{databases}} that were <b>temporally</b> sharded (large databases were split based on time of posting). After the huge volume of tweets coming in caused problems reading from and writing to these databases, the company decided that the system needed re-engineering.|$|E
5|$|Spacetime {{events are}} not {{absolutely}} defined spatially and <b>temporally</b> but rather are known {{relative to the}} motion of an observer. Minkowski space approximates the Universe without gravity; the pseudo-Riemannian manifolds of general relativity describe spacetime with matter and gravity. String theory postulates the existence of additional dimensions.|$|E
5|$|In the White Sea {{region of}} Russia, all three {{assemblage}} types {{have been found}} in close proximity. This, and the faunas' considerable temporal overlap, makes it unlikely that they represent evolutionary stages or <b>temporally</b> distinct communities. Since they are globally distributed – described on all continents except Antarctica – geographical boundaries {{do not appear to be}} a factor; the same fossils are found at all palaeolatitudes (the latitude where the fossil was created, accounting for continental drift) and in separate sedimentary basins.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Malory becomes <b>temporally</b> blinded {{after having}} an {{allergic}} reaction to zucchini. Seeing {{this as an opportunity}} to help themselves, secretary Cheryl and human resources representative Pam hack into the ISIS computer mainframe from Malory's office and alter their files, allowing them better health care and other perks they can not afford themselves. The whole time, Malory rants about how disgruntled she is about her own and others' life choices.|$|E
5|$|The {{book had}} {{chapters}} on memory, imitation and suggestion, perceptual illusions, and esthetics. In these he refuted {{the idea that}} experience was just the external environment acting on and molding a mind working as a passive recipient. Stratton saw the sensation of time as being multidimensional, in analogy with perception of space. That we could simultaneously hear separately, without synthesizing, multiple mixed tones meant our experiences did not necessarily come in single file <b>temporally.</b> To Stratton this meant time had multiple dimensions, since simultaneous events could not be distinguished on the one past-present-future dimension of time alone. He did not address how the other dimensions could be in temporal-space if the events were indistinguishable <b>temporally</b> to begin with. He also analyzed poetic measure as mathematically connected to the waxing and waning span of attention, tying the arts to psychology. This last was rebutted by Charles Samuel Myers, writing in Nature, who saw poetry and its rhythm as too complex a subject to be reduced to the arithmetic of attention spans.|$|E
5|$|In MN 4, Seorsumuscardinus {{has been}} {{recorded}} from Oberdorf, Austria (sites 3 and 4, which yielded 6 and 17 Seorsumuscardinus alpinus teeth, respectively); Karydia, Greece (S.alpinus); and Tägernaustrasse, Switzerland (5 teeth; S. cf. alpinus). Affalterbach, Germany, where 10 teeth of S.bolligeri were found, is the only known MN 5 locality. In all these localities, {{it is part of}} a diverse dormouse fauna. Because the distributions of the two known species are <b>temporally</b> distinct, Prieto suggested that the genus may be useful for biostratigraphy (the use of fossils to determine the age of deposits). Seorsumuscardinus occurred at the same time as the oldest known Muscardinus.|$|E
5|$|The {{sex ratio}} of male to female dragonflies varies both <b>temporally</b> and spatially. Adult dragonflies {{have a high}} male-biased ratio at {{breeding}} habitats. The male-bias ratio has contributed partially to the females using different habitats to avoid male harassment. As seen in Hine's emerald dragonfly (Somatochlora hineana), male populations use wetland habitats, while females use dry meadows and marginal breeding habitats, only migrating to the wetlands to lay their eggs or to find mating partners. Unwanted mating is energetically costly for females because it affects {{the amount of time}} that they are able to spend foraging.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, Ua Conchobair {{convened a}} great assembly at Athboy. The Annals of the Four Masters states that 13,000 horsemen attended the meeting—1,000 {{of which were}} supplied from Dublin. One of the many rulers recorded to have attended this gathering is a certain Ragnall mac Ragnaill, styled tigerna Gall ("lord of the foreigners"). The latter's name and title suggest that he was either an otherwise unattested brother of Ascall, or else an annalist's mistake for Ascall himself. Meanwhile, after his expulsion from Ireland, Mac Murchada sought out Henry on the Continent, and gained permission to recruit military aid from the latter's subjects. In the autumn of 1167, Mac Murchada and his English allies arrived in Ireland, where they established themselves at Ferns. Ua Conchobair responded by penetrating Uí Chennselaig in a campaign, recounted by the fourteenth-century Annals of Tigernach, that included military support from Dublin. With Mac Murchada <b>temporally</b> kept in check, a preoccupied Ua Conchobair allowed him to hold onto {{at least part of}} his patrimony.|$|E

25|$|It was <b>temporally</b> remodelled in 1969, {{where the}} missing parapet {{on the north}} (upstream) facade of the bridge was removed, a {{cantilevered}} steel walkway and services were added. These alteration works {{have not had a}} positive impact on the composition of the bridge.|$|E
25|$|Gilbert et al. use 2D corners in both {{space and}} time. These are grouped {{spatially}} and <b>temporally</b> using a hierarchical process, with an increasing search area.

25|$|Quantum chaos {{typically}} {{deals with}} systems whose properties {{need to be}} calculated using either numerical techniques or approximation schemes (see e.g. Dyson series).

25|$|Craig {{examines}} arguments {{aimed at}} showing either that God is timeless or omnitemporal. He defends the coherence of a timeless and personal being, but {{says that the}} arguments for divine timelessness are unsound or inconclusive. By contrast, he gives two {{arguments in favor of}} divine temporality. First, he says that if a temporal world exists, then in virtue of his real relations to that world, God cannot remain untouched by its temporality. Craig says that given God's changing relations with the world he must change at least extrinsically, which is sufficient for his existing <b>temporally.</b> Second, Craig says that if a temporal world exists, then in virtue of his omniscience, God must know tensed facts about the world, such as what is happening now, which Craig argues is sufficient for his being <b>temporally</b> located. Craig argues that, since a temporal world does exist, it follows that God exists in time.|$|E
25|$|As an {{analytical}} technique it possesses distinct advantages such as: Increased sensitivity over most other analytical techniques because the analyzer, as a mass-charge filter, reduces background interference, Excellent specificity from characteristic fragmentation patterns to identify unknowns or confirm {{the presence of}} suspected compounds, Information about molecular weight, Information about the isotopic abundance of elements, <b>Temporally</b> resolved chemical data.|$|E

25|$|The reaction, most {{extensively}} researched in crayfish, allows crustaceans {{to escape}} predators through rapid abdominal flexions that produce powerful swimming strokes—thrusting the crustacean backwards {{through the water}} and away from danger. The type of response depends {{on the part of}} the crustacean stimulated, but this behavior is complex and is regulated both spatially and <b>temporally</b> through the interactions of several neurons.|$|E
25|$|Indeed, Trubachev {{argues that}} this {{location}} fostered contacts between speakers of Pre-Proto-Slavic {{with the cultural}} innovations which emanated from central Europe and the steppe. Although language groups cannot be straightforwardly equated with archaeological cultures, {{the emergence of a}} Pre-Proto-Slavic linguistic community corresponds <b>temporally</b> and geographically with the Komarov and Chernoles cultures (Novotna, Blazek). Both linguists and archaeologists therefore often locate the Slavic Urheimat specifically within this area.|$|E
25|$|Actin’s {{cytoskeleton}} {{is key to}} {{the processes}} of endocytosis, cytokinesis, determination of cell polarity and morphogenesis in yeasts. In addition to relying on actin these processes involve 20 or 30 associated proteins, which all have a high degree of evolutionary conservation, along with many signalling molecules. Together these elements allow a spatially and <b>temporally</b> modulated assembly that defines a cell’s response to both internal and external stimuli.|$|E
25|$|Multiple seismic {{surveys were}} {{conducted}} near Sakhalin in 2010, carried out separately by Rosneft, Sakhalin Energy and Gazprom. The surveys conducted by Sakhalin Energy and Rosneft apparently had corresponding monitoring and mitigation plans. The monitoring data, including acoustic and visual information on whale distribution and behavior, {{is yet to}} be analyzed. Two of those seismic surveys occurred later in the year when more gray whales were present and <b>temporally</b> overlapped.|$|E

25|$|While driving, {{the player}} {{collects}} power-ups from item boxes placed in various {{points on the}} track. These power-ups allow the player to attack opponents, causing them to slow down or spin out of control; defend against such attacks; or gain boosts in speed. These include the series staple items, such as the Mushroom, Koopa shell projectiles, the Starman, and banana peels. There are also new items such as the Mega Mushroom, which <b>temporally</b> grows the player to an enormous size and allows them to flatten opposing karts.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{conductance}} of {{ionic current}} flow {{is controlled by}} the gate voltage, using a material with high dielectric constant as the wall of the channel is desired. In this case, there is a stronger field seen within the channel due to a higher gate capacitance. A channel surface with a low surface charge is also desired in order to strengthen the effect of potential tuning by gate electrode. This increases the ability to spatially and <b>temporally</b> tune the ionic and electrostatic environment in the channel.|$|E
25|$|Real world {{bodies are}} often not in {{thermodynamic}} equilibrium and not homogeneous. For study by methods of classical irreversible thermodynamics, a body is usually spatially and <b>temporally</b> divided conceptually into 'cells' of small size. If classical thermodynamic equilibrium conditions for matter are fulfilled to good approximation in such a 'cell', then it is homogeneous and a temperature exists for it. If this is so for every 'cell' of the body, then local thermodynamic equilibrium is said to prevail throughout the body.|$|E
25|$|Astronauts {{must remain}} alert and {{vigilant}} while operating complicated equipment. Therefore, getting enough sleep {{is a crucial}} factor of mission success. Weightlessness, a confined and isolated environment, and busy schedules coupled with {{the absence of a}} regular 24-hour day make sleep difficult in space. Astronauts typically average only about six hours of sleep each night. Cumulative sleep loss and sleep disruption could lead to performance errors and accidents that pose significant risk to mission success. Sleep and circadian cycles also <b>temporally</b> modulate a broad range of physiological, hormonal, behavioral, and cognitive functions.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} decade of the 21st century, Persinger and his colleagues, Blake T. Dotta and David Vares, {{measured}} ultraweak photon emissions from human volunteers, experimental animals, cells, aqueous reactions, and air. Increases in numbers of photon counts under hyperdark conditions during cellular activity and certain types of cognition were associated with small decreases in local geomagnetic intensity with the potential for non-local effects. Persinger and his colleagues experimentally demonstrated that simultaneous application of <b>temporally</b> patterned magnetic fields and specific wavelengths of light to cells stored energy that was subsequently released as the same wavelength of light more than an hour later.|$|E
25|$|In September 1943, the {{squadron}} was re-roled <b>temporally</b> as a level bomber unit, widening its field of operations to Crete and mainland Greece, launching several {{day and night}} operations. The squadron was equipped with Lockheed Venturas in February – March 1944, and although several operations were undertaken around the Greek Islands, the type was not considered successful and in July 1944, No. 459 Squadron was re-equipped with Martin Baltimore aircraft. Prior to the conversion, {{the squadron}} had moved its headquarters to Palestine in April 1944; it remained there until August 1944, when No. 459 was transferred back to Berka, in Libya.|$|E
25|$|However, the First Cause {{does not}} {{necessarily}} have to be <b>temporally</b> the first. Thus, {{the question of whether}} or not the universe can be imagined as eternal was fiercely debated in the Middle Ages. The University of Paris's condemnation of 1270 denounced the belief that the world is eternal. Aquinas' intellectual rival, Bonaventure, held that the temporality of the universe is demonstrable by reason. Aquinas' position was that the temporality of the world is an article of faith, and not demonstrable by reason; though one could reasonably conclude either that the universe is temporal or eternal.|$|E
25|$|GAPDH acts as {{reversible}} metabolic switch under oxidative stress. When {{cells are}} exposed to oxidants, they need excessive amounts of the antioxidant cofactor NADPH. In the cytosol, NADPH is reduced from NADP+ by several enzymes, three of them catalyze the first steps of the Pentose phosphate pathway. Oxidant-treatments cause an inactivation of GAPDH. This inactivation re-routes <b>temporally</b> the metabolic flux from glycolysis to the Pentose Phosphate Pathway, allowing the cell to generate more NADPH. Under stress conditions, NADPH is needed by some antioxidant-systems including glutaredoxin and thioredoxin {{as well as being}} essential for the recycling of gluthathione.|$|E
25|$|Nonsynaptic {{activity}} in the cell is usually expressed as changes in neuronal excitability. This occurs through modulation of membrane components, such as resting and voltage-gated channels and ion pumps. Nonsynaptic processes {{are thought to be}} involved in memory storage. One possible mechanism of this action involves marking a neuron that has been recently active with changes in excitability. This would help to link <b>temporally</b> separated stimuli. Another potential mechanism comes from a computational model that indicates that nonsynaptic plasticity may prime circuits for modification in learning because excitability changes may regulate the threshold for synaptic plasticity.|$|E
25|$|Kant {{ran into}} a problem with his theory that the mind plays a part in {{producing}} objective knowledge. Intuitions and categories are entirely disparate, so how can they interact? Kant's solution is the (transcendental) schema: a priori principles by which the transcendental imagination connects concepts with intuitions through time. All the principles are <b>temporally</b> bound, for if a concept is purely a priori, as the categories are, then they must apply for all times. Hence there are principles such as substance is that which endures through time, and the cause must always be prior to the effect.|$|E
25|$|In {{classical}} mechanics, {{space and}} time are different categories and refer to absolute {{space and time}}. That conception {{of the world is}} a four-dimensional space but not the one that was found necessary to describe electromagnetism. The four dimensions of spacetime consist of events that are not absolutely defined spatially and <b>temporally,</b> but rather are known relative to the motion of an observer. Minkowski space first approximates the universe without gravity; the pseudo-Riemannian manifolds of general relativity describe spacetime with matter and gravity. Ten dimensions are used to describe string theory, eleven dimensions can describe supergravity and M-theory, and the state-space of quantum mechanics is an infinite-dimensional function space.|$|E
25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1955, Asimov {{published}} an early timeline {{in the pages of}} Thrilling Wonder Stories magazine based upon his thought processes concerning the Foundation universe's history at that point in his life, which vastly differs from its modern-era counterpart. Many included stories would later be either jettisoned from the later chronology or <b>temporally</b> relocated by the author. Also, the aforementioned lengthier scope of time was changed. For example, in the original 1950s timeline, humanity does not discover the hyperspatial drive until around 5000 AD, whereas in the reincorporated Robot universe chronology, the first interstellar jump occurs in 2029 AD, during the events of I, Robot.|$|E
