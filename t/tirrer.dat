Objectives To develop a survey to assess the readiness of data repositories to participate in linked research – the Transform International Research Readiness (<b>TIRRE)</b> survey. Method We develop the questionnaire based on our requirement analysis; with questions at micro-, meso- and macro levels of granularity, study-specific questions about diabetes and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD), and research track record. The scope of the data required was extensive. We piloted this instrument, conducting ten preliminary telephone interviews to evaluate the response to the questionnaire.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Recruitment to {{research}} studies {{in primary care}} is challenging despite widespread implementation of electronic patient record (EPR) systems which potentially {{make it easier to}} identify eligible cases. METHODS: Literature review and applying the learning from a European research readiness assessment tool, the TRANSFoRm International Research Readiness instrument (<b>TIRRE),</b> to the context of the English NHS in order to develop a model to assess a practice's research readiness. RESULTS: Seven dimensions of research readiness were identified: (1) Data readiness: Is there good data quality in EPR systems; (2) Record readiness: Are EPR data able to identify eligible cases and other study data; (3) Organisational readiness: Are the health system and socio-cultural environment supportive; (4) Governance readiness: Does the study meet legal and local health system regulatory compliance; (5) Study-specific readiness; (6) Business process readiness: Are business processes tilted in favour of participation: including capacity and capability to take on extra work, financial incentives as well as intangibles such as social and intellectual capital; (7) Patient readiness: Are systems in place to recruit patients and obtain informed consent? CONCLUSIONS: The model might enable the development of interventions to increase participation in primary care-based research and become a tool to measure the progress of practice networks towards the most advanced state of readiness...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{intent of}} this paper is to examine {{personnel}} perceptions of the leadership style of the executive director of a medical center. This study is significant because leadership is the cornerstone of every organization. Based on the responses given, it was found that employees perceived the executive director 2 ̆ 7 s leadership style as autocratic. Also, a majority of the respondents favored the director 2 ̆ 7 s leadership style, and felt it to be beneficial to the organization. They stated that the supervisory channels are clearly identified. Relative to job satisfaction, and the issue of whether or not enough time is allowed for the completion of assignments, a large percentage of the respondents indicated that they liked their jobs, even though there were some employees who said they did not have enoueh <b>tirr,e</b> to complete their work. This study utilizes both primary and secondary data sources. The primary source consists of a seventeen-item questionnaire administered to fifty-two of the sixty-five staff members at the medical center. The secondary sources used were books, research journals, and a United States Health and Human Services Continuation Grant for Community Health Centers. Recommendations to improve the quality of work-life at the center are offered...|$|R
40|$|Several {{studies suggest}} that the {{administration}} of GnRH near the time of insemination improves pregnancy rates in cattle. It has also been reported that there is greater improvement in repeat-breeder animals than at first service. The mechanism for this observation has not been established. Twenty-eight lactating Holstein cows that returned to estrus after one or more inseminations from the usu caine Dairy were used in the study. Anilrals were rarxiomly divide:i into tW 2 ̆ 7 O treatment groups, intrarmJscular administration of 100 ug GnRH or saline oontrol at the <b>tirre</b> of insemination. Blood samples were collected at o, 1, 1. 5, 2, 2. 5, 3 and 4 hours post-insemination for LH determination and on days 0 through 7, 10, 16 and 22 for progesterone determination. Pregnancy status was detennined by rectal palpation 40 to 47 days post insemination. serum IR concentrations reached peak concentrations (9. 33 ± 5. 5 ng/ml) by one hour following GnRH administration. This was significantly different from saline controls (p Serum progesterone levels increased as expected. from day o to day 16 in all animals. Animals treated with GnRH that became pregnant tended to have the highest progesterone levels beginning from day 4. Animals treated with GnRH that were non-pregnant at 40 to 47 days tended to have the lowest progesterone levels from days 4 through 10 but were high on day 16. Pregnant animals had higher progesterone levels than non-pregnant animals from days 4 to 16. These differences approached significance (0. 25 3 ̆e p 3 ̆c 0. 10).

40|$|Recent {{investigations}} of Ausubel's advance organizer technique, a prereading in-stuctional intervention which serves to link new material with existing prior knowl-edge, {{have examined the}} interaction between learner characteristics and the charac-teristics of an advance organizer. However, this research fails to make eplicit {{the relationship between the}} advance organizer and the existing prior knowledge of the learner. The current study investigated the effects on comprehension of verbal and pictorial advance organizers with 8 -year-old children having high or low prior knowledge relative to a science topic. In Experiment 1 a verbal advance organizer assisted the comprehension of only the children in the strong prior knowledge group. In Experiment 2 the addition of a pictorial component to the verbal advance organizer facilitated ths comprehension of children in the weak prior knowledge group. Recent research on the role of cognitive processes in reading comprehension has indicated that the learner's prior knowledge is fundamental in the comprehen-sion of prose. Readers bring prior knowledge to the reading task, enabling them to both instantiate the text information and to make inferences and elaborations that go beyond the text (Anderson & Pearson, 1984; Paris, Wixon, & Palincsar, 1986). The task for educators is to devise instructional interventions that are functionally related to prior knowledge. This study sought to examine the effectiveness of an advance organizer intervention {{as a function of the}} relevant prior knowledge of young readers. Prior knowledge may affect comprehension in at least two ways. First, failure to comprehend may stem from inadequate utilization of existing prior knowledge (Spiro & <b>Tirre,</b> 1980; Townsend, 1983). Proponents of this view tend to devise instructional strategies that have the learner consciously monitor his or her cognitive processes and prior knowledge during the learning task.

40|$|With {{increasing}} {{population and}} the demand for potable water, water with elevated salinity and reclaimed water are now commonly used for irrigating urban landscape in many communities in the arid Southwest. It not only saves potable water, but also provides the stable supply of irrigation water for maintaining urban greenery and recreational facility, usually at a discounted price. There are many examples of successful use of water with elevated salinity, such as shown in Fig. 1 - 1. At the same time, there have been reported cases of landscape quality degradation in some of these use sites. The degradation includes foliar damage, stunted growth, premature defoliation, and in some cases, tree mortality. Thinning of turf covers is also reported, especially in sports fields irrigated with water of elevated salinity. In order to reduce the incidences of landscape quality degradation, Texas AgriLife Research Center at El Paso, in cooperation with both water providers and water users, has been investigating salt tolerance of various landscape plants, and the levels of salt accumulation in different types of soils. The main source of funding came from the Rio Grande Basin Initiative through the Texas Water Research Institute, matched by a local fund from El Paso Water Utilities. The Bureau of Reclamation USDI provided a fund through the Water Conservation Field Service Program to develop soil suitability guidelines, which is shown in a companion report. This report covers spray and soil salinity tolerance of landscape plants, and describes how the information can be used for assessing site suitability. Management capabilities of water users undoubtedly affect quality of landscape, and for this reason, it {{is an important factor in}} assessing site suitability. However, it is beyond the scope of this guideline. This project was assisted by a number of student workers from the University of Texas at El Paso. The task of preparing this report was assisted mainly by Doriana Torres and Yvette Pereyra, student workers. David Ornelas and David <b>Tirre</b> from El Paso Water Utilities have cooperated with our investigation of salt tolerance of landscape plants...|$|R
40|$|Surficial sediments east of Dunnville, Ontario {{representing}} a limited deltaic/lacustrine/aeolian system are investigated {{with the aim}} of defining and interpreting their geological history by means of exarrrrning their sedimentology and interrelationships. The Folk and grain size statistics of samples fran the area were calculated. These sample parameters were e 1 en plotted on maps to detennine regional patterns. The strongest pattern observed was one of distinct fining to the east, away fran the sand source. Aeolian deposits were fourrl to be better sorted than the surrcunding sediments. The grain size parameter values were also plotted on bivariate graphs in an attempt to separate the samples according to depositional environment. This exercise met with little success, as rrost of the sediments sampled in the area have similar grain size parameters. This is believed to be because the sediment sources for the different environments (delta, distal delta, aeolian dune) are intimately related, to the point that nnst dunes appear to have been sourcErl fran immediately local sediments. It is FOstulated that in such a srrall sedimentological sub-system, sediments were not involved in active transport for a length of time sufficient for the rraterial to cane to equilibritnn with its transporting medium. Thus, fe [...] v distinctive patterns of parameters were developed that would enable one to differentiate between various environments of neposition. The i. rnTaturity of rrany dune forms and the i. Imaturity of mineralogical composition of all deposits support the above hyt:XJthesis of limited transport time. Another hypothesis proposen is that eadh geologically or geographically distinct area or "sub-system" rray have its o,. m "signature" of grain size relationships as plotted on bivariate graphs. Thus, the emphasis, concerning graphs of this type, should not be placErl on attempting to nifferentiate between various environnents of deposition, hut raB 1 er on investigating the interrelationships between sanples am environments within that "sub-system". Through the course of this investigation, the existence of nelta plain distributary Channels in the thesis area is SUG 0 ested, and the mscovery of significantly mfferent sub-units within the TUnnville dune sediments is documented.
