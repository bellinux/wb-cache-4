5|$|McLeod {{attended}} Mayesville's one-room black schoolhouse, Trinity Mission School, {{which was}} run by the Presbyterian Board of Missions of Freedmen. She was the only child in her family to attend school, so each day, she taught her family what she had learned. To get <b>to</b> <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>school,</b> Mary walked five miles each day. Her teacher Emma Jane Wilson became a significant mentor in her life. Wilson had attended Scotia Seminary (now Barber-Scotia College). She helped McLeod attend the same school on a scholarship, which she did from 1888–1893. The following year, she attended Dwight L. Moody's Institute for Home and Foreign Missions in Chicago (now the Moody Bible Institute), hoping to become a missionary in Africa. Told that black missionaries were not needed, she planned to teach, as education was a prime goal among African Americans.|$|E
25|$|In many countries, backpacks {{are heavily}} {{identified}} with students, {{and are a}} primary means of transporting educational materials <b>to</b> <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>school.</b> In this context they are sometimes known as bookbags or schoolbags. The purchase of a suitably fashionable, attractive, and useful backpack is a crucial back-to-school ritual for many students.|$|E
25|$|The murders {{shocked the}} city. Worried parents formed escort groups to take {{children}} <b>to</b> <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>school</b> every day, and to patrol streets {{at night and}} on weekends. The Washington Post called the murders of Kendrick and Bradley {{two of the four}} most shocking murders in the city during 1973.|$|E
25|$|The {{only public}} {{transport}} provided currently in Bouldon are buses to Ludlow in the morning, returning {{in the late}} afternoon. These services (176 and 715) are provided mainly for travel <b>to</b> <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>schools</b> <b>and</b> colleges, and only run on schooldays.|$|R
50|$|Bus {{transportation}} is available <b>to</b> <b>and</b> <b>from</b> the <b>school</b> <b>from</b> most residential areas of Tunis, La Marsa, Gammarth, El Manar and Carthage.|$|R
40|$|One way of combating rising obesity {{rates and}} {{decreasing}} {{physical activity levels}} among children is to promote active transportation <b>to</b> <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>schools.</b> The award-winning I-WALK program provides a comprehensive framework for addressing community walkability and related infrastructure. The program uses a unique and innovative methodology that combines volunteer data collection workshops; classroom-based teacher tallies; and a dynamic Web-based survey that brings parents <b>and</b> children together <b>to</b> discuss school transportation issues. The program 2 ̆ 7 s success demonstrates the benefits of coalition-building and community-based participatory research approaches <b>to</b> designing healthy <b>and</b> safe local environments...|$|R
25|$|Buses run {{inside the}} school {{and there is a}} ferry wharf for {{students}} to travel <b>to</b> <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>school.</b> Buses include the 632 to Chatswood, the 650 to Mosman, the 651 to Northbridge and the 654 to Drummoyne. The ferry runs down the Lane Cove River, stopping at Hunters Hill, Longueville, Northwood and Greenwich, then continuing to Birchgrove, Kirribilli and Circular Quay.|$|E
25|$|The University of Ottawa {{has also}} {{introduced}} a bike share program to encourage cycling <b>to</b> <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>school.</b> The university offers free bicycle rentals {{and access to}} free maintenance and repair workshops. Along with new bike routes and services, the university has enhanced car-pooling and shuttle services, and is also located next to the transit way {{to encourage students to}} use public transit via a discounted university student bus pass.|$|E
25|$|The {{scholarship}} includes full tuition, dormitory housing, {{three meals}} per {{day at the}} campus cafeteria, textbooks in Spanish for all courses, school uniform, basic toiletries, bedding, and a small monthly stipend of 100 Cuban pesos ($4). The scholarship does not include travel expenses <b>to</b> <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>school</b> which is not necessary {{in the first three}} out of six years as all classes during those years are walking distance from the dorms. The scholarship also does not include travel to and from Cuba.|$|E
50|$|A summer-uniform {{alternative}} is also available. It {{consists of a}} white short-sleeved shirt with a school crest embroidered on the pocket and may be worn without a blazer or tie <b>to</b> <b>and</b> <b>from</b> the <b>school</b> in hot weather.|$|R
50|$|From 1909 to 1945, some {{students}} were transported <b>to</b> <b>and</b> <b>from</b> Jeffers High <b>School</b> via a special train on the Copper Range Railroad.|$|R
2500|$|... shichidō garan (七堂伽藍)– {{a double}} {{compound}} term literally meaning [...] "seven halls" [...] (七堂) and [...] "(temple) buildings" [...] (伽藍). What is {{counted in the}} group of seven buildings, or shichidō, can vary greatly <b>from</b> temple <b>to</b> temple <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>school</b> <b>to</b> school. In practice, shichidō garan can also mean simply a large complex.|$|R
25|$|Violence against girls discourages {{them from}} {{attending}} school. Sexual or physical {{violence on the}} way <b>to</b> <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>school</b> or at home reduces girls' ability to concentrate in class. Instead of attending to the lesson, they are thinking about the violence they have experienced or worrying about future violence to come. Abuse reduces girls' participation in class even further than normal and reduces their ability to complete homework. Abused girls {{are more likely to}} have low attainment, more grade repetition and a higher drop-out rate than non-abused girls.|$|E
25|$|On March 15, 1920, {{the first}} day of the blizzard, the school {{dismissed}} its students early to enable them to go home before the storm arrived. Many of the students, like the Miner children, were used to driving <b>to</b> <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>school</b> with a horse and buggy, but the school teacher had a rule that no child was permitted to drive home in bad weather without permission from a parent. William Miner, who was worried about the blizzard conditions, rode the two miles to the school on a saddle horse to escort his children home.|$|E
25|$|By the mid-1980s, rumours of Rose's {{sex life}} had reached {{several of the}} children's classmates, and {{although}} the West children had been instructed never to divulge details of their home lives to their peers, Heather did confide to her friends {{that many of these}} rumours were true. The father of one of these classmates was a friend of the Wests; as such, word soon reached Fred and Rose that Heather had divulged details of her home life—including details of her mother's promiscuity—to her classmates. Fred was so concerned by these revelations that he began to escort Heather <b>to</b> <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>school.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Hogwarts Express is {{the train}} which {{transports}} Hogwarts students <b>to</b> <b>and</b> <b>from</b> the <b>school</b> {{at the beginning}} and end of each term. It also transports willing students home for the Christmas holidays. It is stationed in Hogsmeade when not in use, and it can be accessed only by using the magical wall between the platforms 9 and 10.|$|R
30|$|The {{role of the}} {{rickshaw}} is ever evolving {{in society}} as dependence on them increases. In Delhi, {{the capital city of}} India, the cycle rickshaws not only transport passengers but also act as cargo carriers through the narrow bylanes of the old city, provide metro feeder services, alternates <b>to</b> buses <b>and</b> for plying children <b>to</b> <b>and</b> fro <b>from</b> <b>schools.</b>|$|R
50|$|Because Magnet {{students}} come from anywhere within upper Montgomery County, 18 buses service out-of-area students <b>to</b> <b>and</b> <b>from</b> the high <b>school.</b> For Poolesville local students, there are 9 buses.|$|R
25|$|Prior to 1950, San Bruno's {{high school}} {{students}} attended San Mateo High School (opened in 1902) and then Burlingame High School (opened in 1923), traveling <b>to</b> <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>school</b> on the street cars that ran next to the Southern Pacific railroad. Finally, on September 11, 1950, Capuchino High School opened in San Bruno. After years of using Green Hall as a multi-purpose building, the city dedicated a library and city hall in 1954. That same year saw {{the dedication of the}} current central terminal at the airport, part of a major expansion program. A central fire station was later built next to the city hall; an additional station was built in Crestmoor.|$|E
25|$|Schooled {{mostly in}} one-room schools, Bascom quit school while in grade three {{to work on}} the Hyssop 5H Ranch, east of Lethbridge. It was not long before a Canadian Mountie, who was visiting the Hyssop Ranch, thought that one of the cowboys was just too young looking to be a {{seasoned}} cowpuncher and bronc peeler. The Mountie asked Earl Bascom just how old he was - he was 13 years old. Earl was returned to school. Attending school felt better after Earl's father, who had a school district transportation contract, gave him the job of driving an old stagecoach pulled by a team of Bascom horses each day to the surrounding ranches transporting fellow students <b>to</b> <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>school.</b>|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{this time}} Genie's father almost never {{permitted}} {{anyone else to}} leave the house, only allowing his son to go <b>to</b> <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>school</b> and requiring him to prove his identity through various means before entering, and to discourage disobedience he frequently sat {{in the living room}} with a shotgun in his lap. He did not allow anyone else in or near the house, and kept his gun nearby in case someone did come. No one in the neighborhood knew about the abuse Genie's father carried out on his family, or was aware that Genie's parents ever had a child besides their son. Throughout this time, Genie's father kept detailed notes chronicling his mistreatment of his family and his efforts to conceal it.|$|E
25|$|The College uniform varies {{throughout}} the grades, these being between Years Prep–3, 4–6, 7–11 and 12. One defining factor of the uniform is the boater, {{a straw hat}} worn <b>to</b> <b>and</b> <b>from</b> the <b>school</b> <b>and</b> in public {{that has been a}} college tradition since its conception. In Years 4–6, the uniform consists of a green shirt, a green and black tie, grey shorts and plain grey socks.|$|R
40|$|The {{state of}} Texas, {{particularly}} the large urban areas, has experienced considerable {{population growth in}} recent years. This growth has produced new schools in areas near highways originally designed for low volumes and relatively high speeds. Another trend is the higher proportion of children being transported <b>to</b> <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>schools</b> in private vehicles. These realities, {{and many of the}} other issues associated with traffic around schools, make it important to aggressively consider the design of roadways within <b>and</b> around schools <b>to</b> ensure the safest possible traffic environment. Equally important is the consideration of the location and design of the school site, preferably during the planning stages, in order <b>to</b> establish safe <b>and</b> efficient operations. The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) is currently focusing attention on these issues through its Precious Cargo Program. Precious Cargo allows TxDOT staff to review school site plans and make recommendations before the schools are built. Since the program’s inception, more than 180 schools in 70 various school districts statewide have seen traffic safety improvements around their schools or future school sites...|$|R
50|$|Following {{the theft}} of a student's bicycle from Hutch Tech in March 2009, the {{administration}} announced a policy that in essence banned bike riding <b>to</b> <b>and</b> <b>from</b> the <b>school.</b> The student brought the matter before the Buffalo school board, and the first bike rack at Hutch Tech was installed, contributed by a local bicycling advocacy group. The superintendent of schools expressed a desire and plan for bike racks throughout the Buffalo Public School District.|$|R
25|$|Both {{boys and}} girls could {{experience}} sexual harassment although girls experienced it more frequently. Members of the school community sexually harassed girls in and around school. Jobless men, unmarried men looking for partners or sex, and married men looking for sex, sexually harassed girls on their way <b>to</b> <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>school.</b> In some cases, this could involve sexual assault and rape. Girls in the 10 to 19 year age group were most affected. Rape perpetrators could be diverse men in the community or men passing through the community. When rape occurred at home, perpetrators included uncles, cousins, fathers and stepfathers. Girls could be abducted for marriage which meant the man {{did not have to}} pay a bride price. Some compensation might be paid to the girl's parents so they would acknowledge the marriage. Parents could arrange an early or forced marriage against the girl's wishes to continue her education.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have shown}} that if the sexual {{harassment}} was done by a male, {{both male and female}} victims experienced behavioral problems, in contrast to if the female was the perpetrator, where the behavioral problems occurred less. Being absent from school frequently, having difficulties concentrating on school work, and performing poorly on academic work often result. In a 2011 nationwide survey conducted by the AAUW of 7th-12th grade students, 32% of students who had experienced sexual harassment did not want to return to school after it occurred. This included 37% of female students and 25% of male students. 31% of the surveyed students felt physically sick after being sexually harassed, with 37% of females and 21% of males reporting this effect. 30% of students had difficulties studying and focusing on school as a result of sexual harassment including 34% of females and 24% of males, and 19% of students reported having a difficult time sleeping due to sexual harassment, including 22% of females and 14% of males. Other effects include getting into trouble at school, changing the route in which one gets <b>to</b> <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>school,</b> and stopping doing activities and sports.|$|E
25|$|Once girls enter school, patriarchal {{norms and}} values work against norms {{and values of}} modern {{education}} which aims to provide equal education for boys and girls. Parents may allow girls to attend school but still expect them to fulfill traditional duties rather than giving then time to do homework or arrive at school before school gates are shut. Girls are expected to participate in class contrary to their training for non-participation. If girls try to meet school norms for participation they are subjected to psychological violence reinforcing patriarchal norms. Girls may also be subjected to violence and abuse at home if they act on new school norms contrary to tradition. This clash of norms continues on the way <b>to</b> <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>school</b> with older boys and adult men seeing adolescent girls as unprotected by marriage. Consequently, girls experience physical and sexual violence and {{are at risk of}} abduction. Girls' attempts to cope with the educational system may increase their risk of violence and sexual abuse. Girl students were some of the main perpetrators of violence against other girls and they could act as go-betweens for boys in the hope that boys would favor them.|$|E
40|$|Conducting {{research}} on children, {{young people and}} learning often requires access <b>to</b> <b>and</b> help <b>from</b> <b>schools,</b> charities or NGOs.

50|$|Conn-Area Catholic School also {{operates}} in the borough at 613 East Crawford Avenue. The School provides kindergarten through sixth grade {{at an annual}} tuition fee. The School's Principal is Mrs Cecilia Solan. The school offers a strong STEM (Science, Technology, Mathematics, Engineering) focus. There are also several sports programs including: basketball, volleyball, soccer, and cheerleading. By state law, the local public schools, within 10 miles of C-ACS must provide free bus service <b>to</b> <b>and</b> <b>from</b> the <b>school.</b>|$|R

500|$|The University of Massachusetts Amherst offered Achebe a {{professorship}} {{later that}} year, {{and the family}} moved to the United States. Their youngest daughter was displeased with her nursery school, and the family soon learned that her frustration involved language. Achebe helped her face the [...] "alien experience" [...] (as he called it) by telling her stories during the car trips <b>to</b> <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>school.</b>|$|E
500|$|The story covers {{three years}} of tests, talking between classes, culture festivals, and {{athletic}} events at school, as well as time spent traveling <b>to</b> <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>school,</b> studying at Chiyo's house, and vacations at Chiyo's summer beach home and the fictional theme park Magical Land, concluding with the graduation of the main cast. It is generally realistic in tone, marked by occasional bursts of surrealism and absurdity, such as Osaka imagining Chiyo's ponytails being [...] "unscrewed" [...] from her head and an episode featuring the characters' New Year's dreams.|$|E
500|$|The Kansas {{case was}} unique {{among the group}} in {{that there was no}} {{contention}} of gross inferiority of the segregated schools' physical plant, curriculum, or staff. The district court found substantial equality as to all such factors. The lower court, in its opinion, noted that, in Topeka, [...] "the physical facilities, the curricula, courses of study, qualification and quality of teachers, as well as other educational facilities in the two sets of schools [...] comparable." [...] The lower court observed that [...] "colored children in many instances are required to travel much greater distances than they would be required to travel could they attend a white school" [...] but also noted that the school district [...] "transports colored children <b>to</b> <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>school</b> free of charge" [...] and that [...] "o such service [...] provided to white children." ...|$|E
50|$|Harlech {{railway station}} {{is located at}} a level {{crossing}} on the A496 in {{the centre of the}} town of Harlech in Gwynedd, North Wales. The waiting shelters were installed to cater for the high numbers of schoolchildren commuting <b>to</b> <b>and</b> <b>from</b> neighbouring <b>schools.</b> The station is on the Cambrian Coast Railway with passenger services to Porthmadog, Pwllheli, Barmouth, Machynlleth and Shrewsbury. Until the 1960s there was a summer service between London Paddington and Pwllheli, via Birmingham Snow Hill, Shrewsbury and Machynlleth.|$|R
50|$|Besides its {{standardised}} version, {{the five}} historic Basque dialects are Biscayan, Gipuzkoan, and Upper Navarrese in Spain, and Navarrese-Lapurdian and Souletin in France. They take their names from the historic Basque provinces, but the dialect boundaries are not congruent with province boundaries. Euskara Batua was created so that Basque language could be used—and easily understood by all Basque speakers—in formal situations (education, mass media, literature), {{and this is}} its main use today. In both Spain and France, the use of Basque for education varies <b>from</b> region <b>to</b> region <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>school</b> <b>to</b> school.|$|R
