5|$|<b>The</b> <b>aspect</b> weaver {{analyzes}} the advice {{specified by the}} pointcut in <b>the</b> <b>aspect</b> and uses that advice to distribute the implementation code into the defined class. The code differs slightly in each method due to slight variances in requirements for the method (as the method identifier has changed). <b>The</b> <b>aspect</b> weaver determines the appropriate code to generate in each situation {{as defined by the}} implementation advice and then injects it into methods matching the specified pointcut.|$|E
5|$|In the {{programming}} language AspectJ, pointcuts, join points, and the modularized code are defined in an aspect block {{similar to that}} of Java classes. Classes are defined using Java syntax. The weaving process consists of executing <b>the</b> <b>aspect</b> advice to produce only a set of generated classes that have <b>the</b> <b>aspect</b> implementation code woven into it.|$|E
5|$|The example {{at right}} shows a {{potential}} implementation of an aspect which logs the entry and exit of all methods. Without an aspect weaver, this feature would necessitate duplication of code {{in the class}} for every method. Instead, the entry and exit code is defined solely within <b>the</b> <b>aspect.</b>|$|E

5|$|Aspect weavers take {{instructions}} {{known as}} advice specified {{through the use}} of pointcuts and join points, special segments of code that indicate what methods should be handled by aspect code. The implementation of <b>the</b> <b>aspect</b> then specifies whether the related code should be added before, after, or throughout the related methods. By doing this, aspect weavers improve modularity, keeping code in one place that would otherwise have been interspersed throughout various, unrelated classes.|$|E
5|$|Aspect weavers' {{performance}}, {{as well as}} {{the performance}} of the code that they produce, has been a subject of analysis. It is preferable that the improvement in modularity supplied by aspect weaving does not impact run-time performance. Aspect weavers are able to perform aspect-specific optimizations. While traditional optimizations such as the elimination of unused special variables from aspect code can be done at compile-time, some optimizations can only be performed by <b>the</b> <b>aspect</b> weaver. For example, AspectJ contains two similar but distinct keywords, thisJoinPoint, which contains information about this particular instance of woven code, and thisJoinPointStaticPart, which contains information common to all instances of code relevant to that set of advice. The optimization of replacing thisJoinPoint with the more efficient and static keyword thisJoinPointStaticPart can only be done by <b>the</b> <b>aspect</b> weaver. By performing this replacement, the woven program avoids the creation of a join point object on every execution. Studies have shown that the unnecessary creation of join point objects in AspectJ can lead to a performance overhead of 5% at run-time, while performance degradation is only approximately 1% when this object is not created.|$|E

These include Orbitwar (1974, PLATO network computers), Space Wars (1977, arcade), and Space War (1978, Atari 2600). Additionally, in Asteroids (1979), designer Ed Logg used elements from Spacewar, namely the hyperspace button {{and the shape}} of the player's ship.

However, the bytecode weaving process produces more efficient runtime code than would usually be achieved through compiled woven source.|$|E

5|$|Nanostructures of ZnO can be {{synthesized}} into {{a variety}} of morphologies including nanowires, nanorods, tetrapods, nanobelts, nanoflowers, nanoparticles etc. Nanostructures can be obtained with most above-mentioned techniques, at certain conditions, and also with the vapor-liquid-solid method.

Certain additives, such as polyethylene glycol or polyethylenimine, can improve <b>the</b> <b>aspect</b> ratio of the ZnO nanowires. Doping of the ZnO nanowires has been achieved by adding other metal nitrates to the growth solution.

5|$|Through this weaving process, aspect weavers {{allow for}} code {{which would have}} {{otherwise}} been duplicated across classes. By eliminating this duplication, aspect weavers promote modularity of cross-cutting concerns. Aspects define the implementation code which would have otherwise been duplicated and then use pointcuts and join points to define the advice. During weaving, <b>the</b> <b>aspect</b> weaver uses the pointcuts and join points, known as a pointcut designator, to identify the positions in candidate classes at which the implementation should be injected. The implementation is then injected into the classes at the points identified, thus permitting the code to be executed at the appropriate times without relying on manual duplication by the programmer.|$|E

5|$|After The English Teacher, Narayan's {{writings}} {{took a more}} {{imaginative and}} creative external style compared to the semi-autobiographical tone of the earlier novels. His next effort, Mr. Sampath, was the first book exhibiting this modified approach. However, it still draws from {{some of his own}} experiences, particularly <b>the</b> <b>aspect</b> of starting his own journal; he also makes a marked movement away from his earlier novels by intermixing biographical events. Soon after, he published The Financial Expert, considered to be his masterpiece and hailed {{as one of the most}} original works of fiction in 1951. The inspiration for the novel was a true story about a financial genius, Margayya, related to him by his brother. The next novel, Waiting for the Mahatma, loosely based on a fictional visit to Malgudi by Mahatma Gandhi, deals with the protagonist's romantic feelings for a woman, when he attends the discourses of the visiting Mahatma. The woman, named Bharti, is a loose parody of Bharati, the personification of India and the focus of Gandhi's discourses. While the novel includes significant references to the Indian independence movement, the focus is on the life of the ordinary individual, narrated with Narayan's usual dose of irony.|$|E

Two months later however, Crusaders began legal proceedings against the redevelopment. The club called for the process to be judicially reviewed, believing it to be against European Union competition laws and also a form of State aid towards Linfield.

The {{painting of the}} Libyan Sibyl and the Prophet Daniel, which are side-by-side, are exemplary. On the yellow dress of the Sibyl, Michelangelo has bright yellow highlights, passing through carefully graded tones of deeper yellow to pale orange, darker orange and almost to red in the shadows. While red shadows are of themselves unusual in a fresco, the gradation through adjacent parts of the spectrum is a natural enough solution. On Daniel's robes, {{there is no such}} gentle gradation. The yellow lining of his cloak becomes a sudden dense green in the shadows, while the mauve has shadows that are intensely red.
