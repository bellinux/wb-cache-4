25|$|One {{informant}} who {{was close}} to DeStefano described him as a highly emotional, temperamental individual, extremely egotistical and concerned with his personal appearance. <b>The</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> home were lined with mirrors and as DeStefano talked to people he continually watched his reflection in those mirrors as he walked across the room. He was described as being of such a temperament {{that he could be}} crying at one moment and laughing the very next. DeStefano would often state if he had not been framed for rape at age 17, he would have been the president of the United States.|$|E
25|$|Saturn Devouring His Son is {{the name}} given to a {{painting}} by Spanish artist Francisco Goya. According to the traditional interpretation, it depicts the Greek myth of the Titan Cronus (in the title Romanized to Saturn), who, fearing {{that he would be}} overthrown by one of his children, ate each one upon their birth. The work is one of the 14 Black Paintings that Goya painted directly onto <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> house sometime between 1819 and 1823. It was transferred to canvas after Goya's death and has since been held in the Museo del Prado in Madrid.|$|E
25|$|César de Hauke’s {{catalogue}} raisonné of {{the works}} of Seurat lists fourteen works as oil studies for the Bathers, most if not all of which were almost certainly painted outdoors, and in which the composition of the final piece may be seen gradually taking shape. The last of these studies—presently housed at the Art Institute of Chicago—was painted in 1883 and is very close to the final work, except most obviously in respect of its size; it is just 25cm long and 16cm high. Seurat was fond of these small studies, calling them his croquetons (a nonce word best translated as ‘sketchettes’), and hanging them on <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> studio.|$|E

25|$|Stieglitz also {{continued}} to intertwine <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> galleries with {{the pages of}} his magazine. Stieglitz’s closest friends (Steichen, Demachy, White, Käsebier and Keiley) were represented in both, while many others were granted one but not the other. Increasingly, a single photographer was given the preponderance of coverage in an issue, {{and in doing so}} Stieglitz relied more and more on his small circle of old supporters. This led to increase tensions among Stieglitz and some of his original colleagues, and when Stieglitz began to introduce paintings, drawings and other art forms in his gallery many photographers saw it as the breaking point in their relationship with Stieglitz.|$|E

25|$|Noting {{well the}} Thracian's fierce raw talent and {{popularity}} with the masses, Batiatus purchases him for training within <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> ludus {{under the tutelage}} of Oenomaus, a former gladiator and fellow slave who is known to the gladiators as 'Doctore', meaning instructor. He is befriended by Varro, a Roman who sold himself into slavery in order to pay his debts and support his family. He is harassed by more senior gladiators, notably Crixus, an undefeated Gaul, and Barca, a Carthaginian. Spartacus soon learns that Sura was sold to a Syrian slave trader. Batiatus, who has been unable to control Spartacus during his first days of training, promises to find Sura and reunite them in exchange for the promising neophyte's cooperation in the arena.|$|E

25|$|Manuel {{wished to}} induce the crusaders to cross to Asia Minor by the Hellespont, keeping {{them away from}} Constantinople. However, they ignored the advice of Manuel's {{ambassador}} and pushed towards Constantinople, arriving on 10 September. Manuel had extensively repaired and strengthened <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> capital as a safeguard against any crusader aggression. The Germans encamped around the suburban palace of Philopatium, but so pillaged it that it became quickly uninhabitable. They then moved to another suburban palace, Pikridion. The crusader force, {{which may have been}} suffering from a lack of food, made depredations on, and acts of violence against, the local population. Manuel was determined to get the Germans across the Bosporus as quickly as possible and mobilised part of his military forces to induce them to move.|$|E
25|$|Alexandros Panagoulis {{was brutally}} {{tortured}} during his incarceration by the junta. Many {{believe that he}} maintained his faculties thanks to his will, determination to defend his beliefs, {{as well as his}} keen sense of humour. While imprisoned at Bogiati, Panagoulis is said to have written his poetry on <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> cell or on small papers, often using his own blood as ink (as told in the poem 'The Paint'). Many of his poems have not survived. However, he managed to smuggle some to friends while in prison, or to recall and rewrite them later. While in prison his first collection in Italian titled Altri seguiranno: poesie e documenti dal carcere di Boyati (Others will Follow: Poetry and Documents of the Prison of Boyati) was published in Palermo in 1972 with an introduction of the Italian politician Ferruccio Parri and the Italian film director and intellectual Pier Paolo Pasolini. For this collection Panagoulis was awarded the Viareggio International Prize of Poetry (Premio Viareggio Internazionale) the following year. After his liberation he published his second collection in Milan under the title Vi scrivo da un carcere in Grecia (I write you from a prison in Greece) with an introduction by Pasolini. He had previously published several collections in Greek, including The Paint (I Bogia).|$|E
25|$|In 1702 {{the war in}} {{northern}} Italy was in its second year. After Austria's initial success Louis XIV sent Marshal Vendôme to command the Bourbon army, and with greatly superior numbers he began to dominate and pin back his opponent. Although Prince Eugene held the French at the Battle of Luzzara on 15 August, the Austrians had lost {{much of what they}} gained in the first campaign, and the Bourbons were still firmly in control of the Duchy of Milan. In June 1703 Eugene returned to Vienna to preside over the Court War Council (Hofkriegsrat) and set about reorganising the Imperial armies, leaving Guido Starhemberg to oppose Vendôme. Vendôme had been ordered to link with the Elector of Bavaria for the thrust into the Tyrol, but he made little progress towards this goal, due in part to rumours that Victor Amadeus, Duke of Savoy, was about to defect to the Grand Alliance. Louis XIV had failed to satisfy Amadeus' claims on the Duchy of Milan, and the latter had taken umbrage at France's limited financial aid. Moreover, reasoned the Duke, if French power was established in Italy his territory would be surrounded by lands ruled from Versailles. Fearing that he would become little more than a French vassal, Amadeus secured himself behind <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> capital, Turin, and declared war on France on 24 October. Won over by a combination of subsidies and territorial concessions, he signed a formal treaty with the Emperor on 8 November.|$|E
