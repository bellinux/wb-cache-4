5|$|In 1991, Subspecies {{became the}} first American film to be filmed in Bucharest, Romania. Director Ted Nicolaou was {{initially}} apprehensive about shooting on location in Romania, but during a four-day location scout he came <b>to</b> <b>love</b> <b>the</b> location thanks to the free rein he had over the ancient ruins and woodland area. Other Transylvanian areas {{would be used for}} all Subspecies films, with specific location shootings at Hunedoara, Brașov, and Sinaia. Although, the remnants of communism left in the country, along with cultural differences and the general problems that accompany film productions lent to a difficult experience for the crew while shooting the first Subspecies film.|$|E

5|$|Though {{the book}} is on its face an {{adventure}} story, a major theme {{is the need for}} a love of education; through this, Milo applies what he has learned in school, advances in his personal development, and learns <b>to</b> <b>love</b> <b>the</b> life that previously bored him. Critics have compared its appeal to that of Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and to L. Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.|$|E
5|$|I {{should say}} I {{wanted to write}} poetry in the {{beginning}} because I {{had fallen in love}} with words. The first poems I knew were nursery rhymes and before I could read them for myself I had come <b>to</b> <b>love</b> <b>the</b> words of them. The words alone. What the words stood for was of a very secondary importance... I fell in love, that is the only expression I can think of, at once, and am still at the mercy of words, though sometimes now, knowing a little of their behaviour very well, I think I can influence them slightly and have even learned to beat them now and then, which they appear to enjoy. I tumbled for words at once. And, when I began to read the nursery rhymes for myself, and, later, to read other verses and ballads, I knew that I had discovered the most important things, to me, that could be ever.|$|E

25|$|It {{also shows}} a special {{concern for the}} poor, for widows and the fatherless: all Israelites are {{brothers}} and sisters, and each will answer to God for his treatment of his neighbor.

Furthermore, there is a specific commandment <b>to</b> <b>love</b> <b>the</b> stranger.|$|E
25|$|Stock {{car racing}} in the United States has {{its origins in}} bootlegging during Prohibition, when drivers ran bootleg whiskey made {{primarily}} in the Appalachian region of the United States.

Many of the drivers would modify their cars for speed and handling, as well as increased cargo capacity, {{and some of them}} came <b>to</b> <b>love</b> <b>the</b> fast-paced driving down twisty mountain roads.|$|E

For his hundreds of songs alone – including the haunting cycle Winterreise, which will never release its tenacious hold on singers and audiences – Schubert is central to our concert life.... Schubert's first few symphonies may be works in progress. But the Unfinished and especially the Great C major Symphony are astonishing. The latter one paves the way for Bruckner and prefigures Mahler.|$|E
25|$|Just as the Imām {{is seen by}} Ismailis as {{the manifestation}} of the first-created Light, during the period between the Imāmates of Muhammad ibn Ismail and al-Madhi Billah, the {{relationship}} between the teacher and the student became a sacred one, and the Dai became a position much beyond a normal missionary. The Dai passed on the sacred and hidden knowledge of the Imām to the student, who could then use that information to ascend to higher levels. First the student loved the Dai, and from the Dai he learned <b>to</b> <b>love</b> <b>the</b> Imām, who was but an interceder on behalf of God. In Nizari Ismailism, the head Dai is called the Pir.|$|E
25|$|Young came <b>to</b> <b>love</b> <b>the</b> City of London. He relished {{command of}} a force {{small enough to}} know every constable well. He enjoyed the City's rich social life too, and he much valued the {{invitation}} to join the Goldsmiths Company. The police needed to recruit and with considerable success he set about making service more attractive. Pay and allowances were increased, housing modernised, and catering improved. Uniforms were made more comfortable and practical. At another level, he pushed through changes in career structures. He engineered a national recruitment revolution in the British police, running command courses and seeing through a fast-track entry scheme to attract graduates - and for many years he was director of extended interviews for the Senior Command Course that he had founded.|$|E

It was the time when “no music was valued in Russia more than gypsy music, when <b>to</b> <b>love</b> <b>the</b> gypsies and prefer them to Italians didn’t seem strange” according to Leo Tolstoy. A guitarist virtuoso, singer, dancer and song composer Ilya Sokolov was a favourite of Moscow and Saint-Petersburg. “Not a man, but flame and lighting”, - the newspapers said about him. “The sound of Sokolov’ guitar still rings in ears”, - was sung decades after. The Sokolov’s choir performed Russian songs and romances, but in its own way, giving the music a wild sultry sound. Vivacity of gypsy dance came to frenzy. At the Club’s balls and masquerades performed the best orchestras conducted by Stepan Ryabov, Sachs and Kreinbring.|$|E

In the days following young Stephen's return he was jubilant about his adventure on the high sea and spoke of wanting to go sailing often. His parents had different aspirations, especially his mother who had hopes that Stephen would one day become an Episcopal clergyman, and tried to discourage the eight-year-old from such jaunty ambitions, fearing such would distract Stephen from his studies.|$|E
