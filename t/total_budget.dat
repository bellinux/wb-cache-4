5|$|After Pelacur, Sarumpaet {{began working}} on a film {{adaptation}} entitled Jamila dan Sang Presiden (Jamila and the President). The film's production took three years, {{due in part to}} a lack of funding; the <b>total</b> <b>budget</b> was Rp.6.5 billion (US$800,000) Released on 30 April 2009, the film was well received both domestically and internationally.

5|$|In the 2000s Unicamp {{consolidated}} {{itself as}} one of the leading research and education centers in Latin America but also brought new challenges: just as with other public universities in Brazil, the high payroll costs (over 90% of the <b>total</b> <b>budget)</b> constrain investment and expansion. This is further aggravated by the economic depression that Brazil is facing since 2014, the largest in the country's history.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other public}} {{universities}} in Brazil, Unicamp {{is almost entirely}} funded by the government, {{in this particular case}} of the State of São Paulo.

Additional co-production support was provided by Essential Filmproduktion of Germany and BIM Distribuzione of Italy. The <b>total</b> <b>budget</b> was 12.38 million euro. In retrospect, Noé called Irréversible a bank robbery, a film made in order to finance Enter the Void. He also {{saw it as a}} helpful technical exercise.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1964, a group working within the Military Department, which {{approved}} of nuclear tests in Switzerland, presented a secret plan for the attainment of nuclear weapons to the Federal Council. In {{the first phase of}} the plan, 50 bombs from 60–100 kt would be procured. In phase two, another 200 bombs would be procured. To clarify definitively whether nuclear tests should be carried out in Switzerland, the military chief of staff Jacob Annasohn requested of Federal Councillor Paul Chaudet, head of the Military Department, to obtain authorization for the <b>total</b> <b>budget</b> of 20 million Swiss francs from the Federal Council.|$|E

5|$|Even in {{the wake}} of major companies' refusal to support the project, Madsen and Andersen {{continued}} to research archives in England, Germany and Sweden. In 2005, however, German films about World War II started to become popular, and several German companies became interested in the idea for the film. It became a co-production between Denmark and Germany, with three companies—Nimbus Film, Wüste Film and Babelsberg Studio—producing it. Filming took place at the Babelsberg locations in Potsdam-Babelsberg, Germany, and large parts of the film were shot at locations in Copenhagen, Denmark, and Prague, Czech Republic. It received a €342,000 ($460,000) grant from the German Film Fund for its <b>total</b> <b>budget</b> of more than 45million Danish kroner (or $7.6million), making it the most expensive Danish film produced to that date.|$|E

The two had previously assisted Ron Gilbert with the creation of The Secret of Monkey Island and , and the studio felt that Grossman and Schafer were ready to manage a project. The company believed that the pair's humor matched well with that of Maniac Mansion and suggested working on a sequel. The two developers agreed and commenced production. Gilbert and Gary Winnick, the creators of Maniac Mansion, collaborated with Grossman and Schafer on the initial planning and writing. The <b>total</b> <b>budget</b> for the game was about $600,000, according to Schafer.|$|E
5|$|Richmond also {{planned to}} {{increase}} the main stand's capacity by a further 1,800seats by building new changing rooms and office blocks, and add a second tier to the Midland Road stand, {{to increase the}} ground capacity to more than 35,000. However, the club went into administration in May 2002, and Richmond was replaced by new co-owners Julian Rhodes and Gordon Gibb. The following year, Valley Parade was sold to Gibb's pension fund for £5million, with the club's offices, shop and car park sold to London-based Development Securities for an additional £2.5million. Bradford City's annual rent bill in 2011 to Gibb's pension fund is £370,000.

5|$|Romney {{restructured}} the organization's {{leadership and}} policies. He reduced budgets and boosted fundraising, alleviating {{the concerns of}} corporate sponsors while recruiting new ones. Romney worked {{to ensure the safety}} of the Games following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks by coordinating a $300million security budget. He oversaw a $1.32billion <b>total</b> <b>budget,</b> 700employees, and 26,000volunteers. The federal government provided approximately $400million to $600million of that budget, much of it a result of Romney's having aggressively lobbied Congress and federal agencies. It was a record level of federal funding for the staging of a U.S. Olympics. An additional $1.1billion of indirect federal funding came to the state in the form of highway and transit projects.|$|E
5|$|The school {{relied heavily}} on donations, which made up over {{ten percent of the}} <b>total</b> <b>budget.</b> The Friends of SCPA (commonly known as The Friends), a nonprofit {{organization}} led by parents and members of the business and arts communities, had been a vital source of funding since the school's inception. In 1984, The Friends raised over $400,000 to pay the salaries of the artistic director, technical director, costume designer, and dance, strings, and production teachers. In later years, The Friends raised up to $1million each year through special events, corporate gifts and sponsorships, advertising sales, and other programs to support the artistic needs of the school including staff salaries, production expenses, scholarships for private lessons, and artists in residence.|$|E
5|$|Nataraja Mudaliar {{sought the}} advice of his friend, the theatre artist Pammal Sambandha Mudaliar, who {{suggested}} that he should depict the story of the Mahabharata characters Draupadi and Kichaka. Some of Nataraja Mudaliar's relatives objected to it as they felt {{that it was not a}} proper story for his debut venture. Nataraja Mudaliar, however, decided to proceed and launched his directorial debut titled Keechaka Vadham, which was based on an episode from the Mahabharatha. The episode follows the attempts made by Keechaka, one of the generals of King Virata, to woo and marry Draupadi. Keechaka's misbehaviour with Draupadi prompts the latter to inform Bhima about it. Bhima kills him. Nataraja Mudaliar was not a writer, so he had to take assistance from his close friend C. Rangavadivelu, a lawyer by profession. Besides writing the screenplay, Rangavadivelu agreed to coach artists on sets. Nataraja Mudaliar engaged stage actors Raju Mudaliar and Jeevarathnam to play the roles of Keechaka and Draupadi respectively. The <b>total</b> <b>budget</b> of the film was 35,000, which was then considered expensive.|$|E

5|$|The Louvre {{is owned}} by the French government; however, since the 1990s it has become more independent. Since 2003, the museum has been {{required}} to generate funds for projects. By 2006, government funds had dipped from 75percent of the <b>total</b> <b>budget</b> to 62percent. Every year, the Louvre now raises as much as it gets from the state, about €122 million. The government pays for operating costs (salaries, safety and maintenance), while the rest – new wings, refurbishments, acquisitions – is up to the museum to finance. A further €3 million to €5 million a year is raised by the Louvre from exhibitions that it curates for other museums, while the host museum keeps the ticket money. As the Louvre became a point of interest in the book The Da Vinci Code and the 2006 film based on the book, the museum earned $2.5million by allowing filming in its galleries. In 2008, the French government provided $180million of the Louvre's yearly $350million budget; the remainder came from private contributions and ticket sales.|$|E
5|$|When Universal {{cancelled}} King Kong in 1997, Jackson and Walsh immediately received {{support from}} Weinstein {{and began a}} six-week process of sorting out the rights.

The first film would have dealt with what would become , , and the beginning of , ending with Saruman's death, and Gandalf and Pippin going to Minas Tirith. In this treatment, Gwaihir and Gandalf visit Edoras after escaping Saruman, Gollum attacks Frodo when the Fellowship is still united, and Farmer Maggot, Glorfindel, Radagast, Elladan and Elrohir are present. Bilbo attends the Council of Elrond, Sam looks into Galadriel's mirror, Saruman is redeemed before he dies and the Nazgûl just make it into Mount Doom before they fall. They presented their treatment to Harvey and Bob Weinstein, the latter of whom they focused on impressing with their screenwriting as he had not read the book. They agreed upon two films and a <b>total</b> <b>budget</b> of $75million.|$|E
5|$|The West Coast offices {{had wanted}} {{a test case}} to take to court, but had a {{difficult}} time finding a Japanese American who was both willing to violate the internment orders and able to meet the ACLU's desired criteria of a sympathetic, Americanized plaintiff. Of the 120,000 Japanese Americans affected by the order, only 12 disobeyed, and Korematsu, Hirabayashi, and two others were the only resisters whose cases eventually made it to the Supreme Court. Hirabayashi v. United States came before the Court in May 1943, and the justices upheld the government's right to exclude Japanese Americans from the West Coast; although it had earlier forced its local office in L.A. to stop aiding Hirabayashi, the ACLU donated $1,000 to the case (over a third of the legal team's <b>total</b> <b>budget)</b> and submitted an amicus brief. Besig, dissatisfied with Osmond Fraenkel's tamer defense, filed an additional amicus brief that directly addressed Hirabayashi's constitutional rights. In the meantime, A.L. Wirin served as one of the attorneys in Yasui v. United States (decided the same day as the Hirabayashi case, and with the same results), but he kept his arguments within the perimeters established by the national office. The only case to receive a favorable ruling, ex parte Endo, was also aided by two amicus briefs from the ACLU, one from the more conservative Fraenkel and another from the more putative Wayne Collins.|$|E
