5|$|In 1980, {{his team}} at NIMH {{admitted}} {{a patient with}} depression who had observed seasonal changes within himself and thought previous research regarding melatonin release at night {{may be able to}} help him.

They conducted a formal follow-up study to confirm the success. The results were published in 1984, officially describing SAD and pioneering light therapy as an effective treatment method. The research on SAD and light therapy is inconclusive and in some ways controversial, as not all researchers agree with Rosenthal's conclusions on the effect of light therapy and at what time of day the light should be administered.|$|E

5|$|In 1924, Sadler began hosting Sunday tea gatherings at his home, {{which could}} {{accommodate}} fifty guests. Many attendees {{worked in the}} medical establishment, and typically adhered to a progressive ideology. The group often held a forum to discuss <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> <b>with</b> the sleep issue and devise questions for him. The observers withheld the man's name from the group, but relayed some of his statements. In 1925, the forum, which then had thirty members, closed their meetings to visitors and began to require a pledge of secrecy. Sadler instructed forum members not to publicize what they learned, telling them that they had an incomplete picture of what was occurring. He also feared that the patient would face criticism if his identity were known. His identity has never been confirmed; Joscelyn Godwin, of Colgate University, and skeptic Martin Gardner posit that the sleeping man was Wilfred Kellogg, the husband of Lena's sister Anna.|$|E
5|$|The {{residents}} initially {{arrive at}} the hospital each morning and argue over who will care for a certain patient that arrives each day. A hospital superior {{is in charge of}} assigning cases, often translating to tense feelings between the residents and their superiors. Episodes migrate {{back and forth from the}} doctors interacting with their patients, and with their co-workers. Once assigned a case, each doctor diagnoses <b>the</b> <b>patient,</b> <b>with</b> the help of his or her attending physician, which usually leads to surgery. The surgeons tend to form personal connections with their patients, with a patient often conveying a message to his or her doctor, which unintentionally relates to the doctor's private life. The show displays the growth of relationships between the doctors, either friendly or sexual, often stemming to a clash between their personal and professional lives. Emotional scenes are often accompanied by an indie rock background song, something that has become a hallmark of the series. At the conclusion of each episode, one of the characters delivers another voice-over, typically contrasting or following up on their initial one.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The panting {{manoeuvre}} may be {{used during}} the assessment of airway resistance and in asthmatic patients during bronchial provocation testing or spontaneous asthma. To study whether panting opens <b>the</b> larynx in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> asthma, laryngeal resistance was examined in six <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> stable asthma before and after methacholine induced bronchoconstriction and in another six <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> spontaneous asthma. Subjects were asked to pant and then to hold their breath immediately afterwards. Laryngeal resistance after panting was compared to that during quiet tidal breathing. Change in laryngeal resistance was estimated by a method using low frequency sound and respiratory resistance by forced oscillation at 10 Hz. Mean baseline respiratory resistance during inspiration was 0 245 and 0 470 kPa/l. s before and after methacholine in <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> stable asthma and 0 - 480 kPa/l. s in <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> spontaneous asthma. In <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> stable asthma mean laryngeal resistance was lower after panting than during the preceding quiet tidal breathing, {{both before and after}} methacholine induced bronchoconstriction (by 0 O 08 before and by 0 065 kPa/l. s after). In contrast, <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> spontaneous asthma showed an increase in laryngeal resistance after panting of 0 - 089 kPa/l. s. The magnitude of change in laryngeal resistance after panting was similar to the change in respiratory resistance in <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> spontaneous asthma and in <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> stable asthma after methacholine, but was greater than the change in respiratory resistance in <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> stable asthma before methacholine.

40|$|Abstract. Some {{functional}} properties of IFNα-induced dendritic cells (DCs) from <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> pulmonary tuberculosis (PT) were under study.

NO production by DCs from <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> was also reduced. In addition, it has been shown, that DCs of PT patients were characterized by low allostimulatory activity in mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR), and this defect was more marked in <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> PPD-anergy. As compared to healthy donors, DCs from <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> PT (in particular, with PPD-anergy) exhibited a decreased capacity for induction of intracellular expression and production of IFNγ by T-cells.

40|$|Background: Hypersensitivity {{pneumonitis}} (HP) is an immune-mediated {{lung disease}} induced by inhalation of numerous antigens. Pathologically, chronic HP tends to show usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) and fibrotic nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (fNSIP) patterns. <b>Patients</b> <b>with</b> UIP pattern present insidious onset and a risk for acute exacerbations. Methods: To evaluate the proteomic differences of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) between UIP and fNSIP patterns, BALF from seven <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> UIP pattern and four <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> fNSIP pattern was examined using {{two-dimensional gel electrophoresis}} and mass spectrometry.
