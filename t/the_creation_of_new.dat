5|$|According to {{historian}} David Armitage, the Declaration of Independence did {{prove to}} be internationally influential, but not as a statement of human rights. Armitage argued that the Declaration {{was the first in}} a new genre of declarations of independence that announced <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> states.|$|E
5|$|Archaea host a {{new class}} of {{potentially}} useful antibiotics. A few of these archaeocins have been characterized, but hundreds more are believed to exist, especially within Haloarchaea and Sulfolobus. These compounds differ in structure from bacterial antibiotics, so they may have novel modes of action. In addition, they may allow <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> selectable markers for use in archaeal molecular biology.|$|E
5|$|After World War II {{the study}} of {{probability}} theory and stochastic processes gained more attention from mathematicians, with signification contributions made {{in many areas of}} probability and mathematics as well as <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> areas. Starting in the 1940s, Kiyosi Itô published papers developing the field of stochastic calculus, which involves stochastic integrals and stochastic differential equations based on the Wiener or Brownian motion process.|$|E
50|$|Since 1987, <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> some <b>new</b> {{congressional districts}} {{have been met}} with controversy, {{especially}} due to incumbent political clans and their allies benefiting from the new district arrangements. Some <b>of</b> these <b>new</b> congressional districts are tied to <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> a <b>new</b> province, because such an act necessarily entails <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> a <b>new</b> congressional district.|$|R

50|$|The {{demand for}} <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>newer</b> states in Nigeria tends to emanate from sub-state groups, often ethnic- or tribal-interest groups, which accuse the current larger state governments of subverting or {{ignoring}} {{the interests and}} necessities of the more local regions.|$|R
5|$|In February 2006 Band {{took over}} the {{positions}} of First Sea Lord and Chief of Naval Staff from Admiral Sir Alan West and in a press statement set out the Navy's priorities in the 21st century. Upon taking up the post of First Sea Lord he became the professional head of the Royal Navy. Band is a proponent for the Sustained surface combatant capability and <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> ships to maintain the Royal Navy {{as one of the}} world's leading navies. These include the new Type 45 destroyer and the Royal Navy CVF programme, designed to replace the UK's current aircraft carriers.|$|E
5|$|In the 8th and 9th centuries, {{civil service}} {{constituted}} the clearest path to aristocratic status, but, {{starting in the}} 9th century, the civil aristocracy was rivalled by an aristocracy of nobility. According to some studies of Byzantine government, 11th-century politics were dominated by competition between the civil and the military aristocracy. During this period, Alexios I undertook important administrative reforms, including <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> courtly dignities and offices.|$|E
5|$|Narayan is {{associated}} with the Kirana gharana (stylistic school of Kirana) through Abdul Wahid Khan, but his performance style is not strongly connected to it. Most of Narayan's compositions are from the singing repertoire of his teachers and were modified and adapted to the sarangi. He has created original compositions and in performance varies those he was taught. Narayan disfavors <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> ragas, but developed compound ragas, including those of Nand with Kedar and Kafi with Malhar.|$|E

50|$|Since Confederation in 1867, {{there have}} been several {{proposals}} for new Canadian provinces and territories.

50|$|However, the Supreme Court {{declared}} <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> legislative district as unconstitutional on January 28, 2010. The Supreme Court further reaffirmed on March 10, 2010 {{its decision}} to declare <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> legislative district as unconstitutional, thus, the city remains part of the 1st District of Bulacan.|$|R
5|$|One of the {{consequences}} of the development of the entertainment industry has been <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> types of employment. While jobs such as writer, musician and composer exist as they always have, people doing this work are likely to be employed by a company rather than a patron as they once would have been. New jobs have appeared, such as gaffer or special effects supervisor in the film industry, and attendants in an amusement park.|$|E
5|$|Some noncoding DNA {{sequences}} play structural {{roles in}} chromosomes. Telomeres and centromeres typically contain few genes but {{are important for}} the function and stability of chromosomes. An abundant form of noncoding DNA in humans are pseudogenes, which are copies of genes that have been disabled by mutation. These sequences are usually just molecular fossils, although they can occasionally serve as raw genetic material for <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> genes {{through the process of}} gene duplication and divergence.|$|E

Along with University College, they {{comprise}} the university's constituent colleges, which are established and funded by the central administration and are therefore financially dependent. Massey College was established in 1963 by the Massey Foundation as a college exclusively for graduate students. Regis College, a Jesuit seminary, entered federation with the university in 1979.|$|E
5|$|The {{reign of}} Nyuserre Ini {{witnessed}} the unabated {{growth of the}} priesthood and state bureaucracy, a phenomenon which had started in the early Fifth Dynasty in particular under Neferirkare Kakai. Changes in the Egyptian administration during this period are manifested by a multiplication {{in the number of}} titles, reflecting <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> administrative offices. These in turn, reflect a movement to better organise the administration of the state with the new titles corresponding to charges attached to very specific duties.|$|E
5|$|This {{prompted}} {{the development of}} the Parliamentary Triangle, a core part of Griffin's design, and since then various buildings of national importance were constructed on the lakefront. The Australian National University was built, and sculptures and monuments were built. On average, the population of Canberra increased by more than 50% every five years between 1955 and 1975 as {{the development of the}} capital became more concerted, and new residential land was released through <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> town centres in the 1960s and 1970s.|$|E

5|$|Baseball {{has also}} {{inspired}} <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> cultural forms. Baseball cards {{were introduced in}} the late 19th century as trade cards. A typical example would feature {{an image of a}} baseball player on one side and advertising for a business on the other. In the early 1900s they were produced widely as promotional items by tobacco and confectionery companies. The 1930s saw the popularization of the modern style of baseball card, with a player photograph accompanied on the rear by statistics and biographical data. Baseball cards—many of which are now prized collectibles—are the source of the much broader trading card industry, involving similar products for different sports and non-sports-related fields.|$|E
5|$|During the Texas Constitutional Convention of 1868, {{the delegates}} paid {{attention}} to northeastern portion of the state, especially the increasing need for <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> counties in the region. At the time, there were a total of twenty counties located in the region, compared to twenty-three presently. The convention originally met to write a new state constitution, but members quickly tried to shift the focus to other issues. During the convention, the Committee on Counties and County Boundaries presented proposals {{for the creation of}} three new counties in the region. They were to be called Delta, Webster, and Richland. Delta County was established on July 29, 1870, by the Twelfth State Legislature. The proposals for Webster and Richland counties, however, were not passed.|$|E
5|$|Feminist economists Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum {{created the}} human {{capabilities}} approach {{as an alternative}} way to assess economic success rooted in the ideas of welfare economics {{and focused on the}} individual's potential to do and be what he or she may choose to value. Unlike traditional economic measures of success, focused on GDP, utility, income, assets or other monetary measures, the capabilities approach focuses on what individuals are able to do. This approach emphasizes processes as well as outcomes, and draws attention to cultural, social and material dynamics of well-being. Martha Nussbaum, expanded on the model with a more complete list of central capabilities including life, health, bodily integrity, thought, and more. In recent years, the capabilities approach has influenced <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> models including the UN's Human Development Index (HDI).|$|E

5|$|Habitat {{protection}} and management {{is seen as}} the most important element for the conservation of Triturus newts. This includes preservation of natural water bodies, reduction of fertiliser and pesticide use, control or eradication of introduced predatory fish, and the connection of habitats through sufficiently wide corridors of uncultivated land. A network of aquatic habitats in proximity is important to sustain populations, and <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> breeding ponds is in general very effective as they are rapidly colonised when other habitats are nearby. In some cases, entire populations have been moved when threatened by development projects, but such translocations need to be carefully planned to be successful. Strict protection of the northern crested newt in the United Kingdom has created conflicts with local development projects; at the same time, the charismatic crested newts are seen as flagship species, whose conservation also benefits a range of other amphibians.|$|E
5|$|Jeff Tolbert also {{accepts the}} Slender Man as folkloric and {{suggests}} {{it represents a}} process he calls “reverse ostension.” Ostension in folkloristics {{is the process of}} acting out a folk narrative. According to Tolbert, the Slender Man does the opposite by creating a set of folklore-like narratives where none existed before. It is an iconic figure produced through a collective effort and deliberately modeled after an existing and familiar folklore genre. According to Tolbert, this represents two processes in one: it involves <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> objects and new disconnected examples of experience, and it involves the combination of these elements into a body of “traditional” narratives, modeled on existing folklore (but not wholly indebted to any specific tradition).|$|E
5|$|Miklós Kis, a Transylvanian Protestant {{priest and}} schoolteacher, became deeply {{interested}} in printing after {{being sent to}} Amsterdam to help print a Hungarian Protestant translation of the Bible. This {{was a period of}} considerable prosperity for the Netherlands and a time when its styles of printing were very influential across Europe, making it a centre for <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> typefaces. He developed a second career as a punchcutter, an engraver of the punches used as a master for making moulds for metal type, working on commission for printers and governments. Kis returned to Transylvania around 1689 and may have left matrices (the moulds used to cast type) in Leipzig on his way home. The Ehrhardt type foundry of Leipzig released a surviving specimen sheet of them around 1720.|$|E
