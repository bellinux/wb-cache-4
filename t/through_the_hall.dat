5|$|From the 18th century onwards, the {{interior}} of the castle was converted to provide accommodation for the Lord Wardens, almost all of which is now open to visitors. The castle is still entered through the ground floor of the gatehouse in the western bastion, which contains the original porter's lodge. In the middle of the castle is the keep, which originally housed the Servants' Hall and now a set of tea rooms. In the southern bastion is a set of rooms which are reached <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hall</b> Room, originally built as gunners' lodgings in the 18th century and converted into the entrance hall to the castle in the 1930s. On {{the far side of the}} bastion are the Sackville and Willingdon Rooms, built in the 18th century; the Willingdon Room is now used as a museum for objects relating to William Pitt. The Lucas Room has been redecorated in a mid-19th century style and is used to present various items of Wellington memorabilia. The north and east bastions are filled in, providing solid foundations for the gun platforms above.|$|E
5|$|The video {{opens with}} two men street dancing in a white hall, with {{speakers}} and chairs scattered around. Shots of an audience lead to Roberts walking to a microphone positioned on a stage before she starts lip-synching, wearing a 1970s style outfit. After knocking over the microphone stand, Roberts performs a routine with three female back-up dancers in front of multiple speakers. During the chorus, she dances with the same three dancers, whilst shots of men watching them are shown. Roberts then leads the three women <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> before they perform a dance section in {{the bridge of the}} track. Three men marching in a small white room are shown, leading to a shot of Roberts marching alongside a marching band of drummers. She is then shown in a multi-coloured sweater-dress, stood atop a speaker and surrounded by dancers. Final shots show Roberts producing shapes of letters L, O, V, and E with cheerleaders. The video ends with Roberts casually interacting with her dancers.|$|E

25|$|The gunfight distracted Harris and Klebold {{from the}} injured Brian Anderson. Anderson escaped {{to the library}} and hid inside an open staff break room. Back in the school, the duo moved along the main North Hallway, {{throwing}} pipe bombs and shooting at anyone they encountered. Klebold shot Stephanie Munson in the ankle, although she was able to walk out of the school. The pair then shot out the windows to the East Entrance of the school. After proceeding <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> several times and shooting toward—and missing—any students they saw, Harris and Klebold went toward the west entrance and turned into the Library Hallway.|$|E
25|$|Shortly afterwards, passing <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hall</b> of Abraham, Goldstein {{entered the}} Hall of Isaac, where some 800 Muslims were at prayer. He {{was dressed in}} his army uniform and carried an IMI Galil assault rifle and four {{magazines}} of ammunition, which held a total of 140 rounds in 35 rounds per magazine. He was not stopped by the guards, who assumed {{that he was an}} officer entering the tomb to pray in an adjacent chamber reserved for Jews. Standing in front of the only exit from the hall and positioned {{to the rear of the}} Muslim worshippers, is reported as having thrown a grenade into the middle of the hall, and then opened fire, killing 29 people and wounding another 125, among them children. Several people were left with paralyzing wounds. According to survivors, Goldstein bided his time until sujūd, the part of the prayer where worshippers prostrate themselves with their heads on the floor. After someone in the crowd hurled a fire extinguisher, which struck him on the head, he was overcome, disarmed and then beaten to death. No criminal charges were filed in connection with his killing.|$|E

500|$|In Old English, sib ("family") is cognate with Old Norse Sif and sif. In the Old English poem Beowulf (lines 2016 to 2018), Hroðgar's wife, Wealhþeow, moves <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> serving mead to {{the warriors}} and {{defusing}} conflict. Various scholars beginning with Magnus Olsen {{have pointed to}} the similarity with what Sif does at the feast described in Lokasenna. Richard North further notes that unusually, sib is personified here and in lines 2599 to 2661, and suggests they may be references to Sif in Danish religion: [...] "Both instances may indicate that the poet of Beowulf {{was in a position}} to imagine a sixth-century Scandinavia on the basis of his knowledge of contemporary Danish legends." ...|$|E
500|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{for the song}} was uploaded onto the YouTube channel of Stan's label, Maan Studio, on 27 September 2012, after teasing it on 19 September. The clip was filmed by Iulian Moga at Palatul Snagov It commences with Stan entering a party hall in sepia while being pictured by a photographer. Following her flirting with the man, she leaves {{the room and the}} video introduces to pool-party in normal color, where Stan dances along with fellow background dancers sporting a pink outfit. Next, the singer is shown in a dark hall, sitting on an old-fashioned couch. Following this, Stan is portrayed in a church, with her body and face being covered by a red robe; fellow black-clothed people surround her. Subsequently, scenes with the singer and her love interest from a hotel room are shown, after which the clip ends with the people from the church scene getting out of disguise and running <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> in white lingerie, followed by Stan dancing around a fire after letting candles falling down at a date with her boyfriend.|$|E
500|$|Bryan {{continued}} with language evoking the Civil War, telling his audience that [...] "in this contest brother has been arrayed against brother, father against son." [...] By then, {{as he spoke}} in a sincere tone, his voice sounded clearly and loudly <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall.</b> He denied, however that the contest was personal; he bore no ill-will towards those who supported the gold standard. However, he stated, facing towards the gold delegates, [...] "when you come before us and tell us that we are about to disturb your business interests, we reply that you have disturbed our business interests by your course." [...] The gold men, during the address, paid close attention and showed their appreciation for Bryan's oratory. Bryan then defended the right of silver supporters to make their argument against opposition from gold men, who were associated with financial interests, especially in the East. Although his statements nominally responded to a point made by Russell, Bryan had thought of the argument the previous evening, and had not used it in earlier speeches. He always regarded it as the best point he made during the speech, and only the ending caused more reaction from his listeners: ...|$|E

2500|$|Crawley {{was granted}} a charter for a weekly market in 1202. [...] Thereafter, {{what had been a}} village, on the London–Brighton road halfway between the two places, slowly grew into a market town and a centre for {{agriculture}} and ironworking. [...] As the area became more prosperous, several timber-framed open hall-houses were built {{on both sides of the}} High Street (the name given to the part of the London–Brighton Road running through the town centre). [...] These [...] "Wealden hall-houses"—the design of which allowed smoke from open fires to rise <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> and disperse readily—were common in the Weald of Kent and Sussex, and five have been documented in Crawley. [...] One such building was the Shades (perhaps its original name), which was built in the 15th century.

The skirt was trimmed with white roses and the bodice with lace. She wore a huge diamond necklace and a large brooch of diamonds and pearls.
