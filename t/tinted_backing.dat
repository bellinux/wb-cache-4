50|$|The {{slender body}} of the {{bonefish}} is silver, with a blue to green <b>tinted</b> <b>back.</b> On {{the upper half of}} the body there are dark streaks with cross bands connecting to the lateral line. The body is rounded with a long, slightly downturned snout. The dorsal and caudal fins are black. Bonefish vary in adult length from 40-100 cm depending on species. The average size of a bonefish is from 3 to 5 pounds (1-2 kg) with the Florida record being 16 pounds 3 oz (7.34 kg).|$|R
5000|$|In Russia, window tinting {{limits are}} {{specified}} in GOST 5727-88. The limit is 75% {{for the front}} windshield (a darker stripe no wider than 10 cm is allowed at the very top) and 70% for the front side windows. <b>Tinting</b> of <b>back</b> windows is not regulated. In practice, however, bribes are often used to pass inspection or avoid road police tickets even with illegal tint.|$|R
50|$|The flower is 2 cm diameter, {{with six}} or seven (and on rare {{occasions}} eight to ten) tepals (petal-like segments) with many stamens. In the wild the flowers are usually white but may be pinkish, lilac or blue, and often have a darker <b>tint</b> on the <b>backs</b> of the tepals. The flowers are pollinated by insects, especially hoverflies. The seeds are achenes.|$|R
50|$|Mouse lemurs {{are among}} the {{smallest}} primates, and Goodman’s mouse lemur is no exception. Although not the smallest overall, Goodman’s mouse lemur has a head-body length comparable to M. berthae which is the smallest known primate. The average size ranges from 45-48 grams, with males being slightly larger than females. Goodman’s mouse lemur is mainly maroon with a white underbelly and orange <b>tint</b> on their <b>backs.</b>|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the leading}} milliners of New York, Daché had {{realised}} that hats were going out of fashion, and had added an extravagant pink-and-white salon to her building {{in order to attract}} a different type of customer. Kenneth was employed to head up the salon, which became the most important hairdressing venue in New York. Among the clients who came to Lilly Daché for hairdos were Lucille Ball, who called Kenneth [...] "God", and the actress Kay Kendall, who in 1957, was steered towards Kenneth by Lilly Daché's house model, Gillis McGil. Kenneth rescued her overdyed red hair, which Kendall said made her [...] "look like Danny Kaye in drag", cutting it short and <b>tinting</b> it <b>back</b> to the original color, creating a coiffure that became an international sensation, with many women queueing outside the salon to have their hair done the same way.|$|R
50|$|Wood anemone, Anemone nemorosa, {{is similar}} to A. ranunculoides but has {{slightly}} larger flowers (usually white, {{but they may be}} pinkish or lilac, often with a darker <b>tint</b> to the <b>back</b> of the 'petals'). Anemone × lipsiensis is a hybrid between these two species and has pale yellow flowers; it is often found where the two parent species grow near each other. A. × lipsiensis 'Pallida' is the best-known result of this cross. A most attractive plant, it has been awarded the AGM, H4, like both of its parents.|$|R
50|$|With {{the lack}} of natural color {{processing}} available, films of the silent era were frequently dipped in dyestuffs and dyed various shades and hues to signal a mood or represent a time of day. Hand <b>tinting</b> dates <b>back</b> to 1895 in the United States with Edison's release of selected hand-tinted prints of Butterfly Dance. Additionally, experiments in color film started as early as in 1909, although it took a much longer time for color to be adopted by the industry and an effective process to be developed. Blue represented night scenes, yellow or amber meant day. Red represented fire and green represented a mysterious atmosphere. Similarly, toning of film (such as the common silent film generalization of sepia-toning) with special solutions replaced the silver particles in the film stock with salts or dyes of various colors. A combination of tinting and toning {{could be used as}} an effect that could be striking.|$|R
60|$|Presently he {{was joined}} by Mrs. Sunshine. She was not such a bright yellow as was Sunshine, having an olive-green <b>tint</b> on her <b>back.</b> But {{underneath}} she was almost clear yellow without the reddish-brown streaks. She too {{was glad to see}} Peter but couldn't stop to gossip, for already, as she informed Sunshine, she had found just the place for their nest. Of course Peter begged to be told where it was. But the two little folks in yellow snapped their bright eyes at him and told him that that was their secret and they didn't propose to tell a living soul.|$|R
50|$|The adult {{yellow-green vireo}} is 14-14.7 cm {{in length and}} weighs 18.5 g. It has olive-green upperparts and a dusky-edged gray crown. There is a dark line from the bill to the red-brown eyes, and a white supercilium. The underparts are white with yellow breast sides and flanks. Young birds are duller with brown eyes, a brown <b>tint</b> to the <b>back,</b> and less yellow on the underparts. The adult yellow-green vireo differs from the red-eyed vireo in its much yellower underparts, lack of a black border to the duller gray crown, yellower upperparts and {{different}} eye color.|$|R
50|$|The golden palm civet is {{brown on}} the upper side, but {{individually}} variable from dark sepia to ochreous, rusty or golden-brown. The tips of the contour hairs are frequently lustrous, sometimes greyish. The legs {{are about the same}} <b>tint</b> as the <b>back,</b> but the tail and the face are sometimes noticeably paler, buffy-grey. The face does not have a pattern, and the vibrissae are dirty white. The hair in front of the shoulders radiates from two whorls and grows forward along the sides of the neck and the nape to the head. It also grows forward on the fore throat, radiating from a single whorl. The dorsal pattern consists of faint bands and spots that are slightly darker than the ground colour. The lower side is slightly paler and sometimes greyer than the upper.|$|R
50|$|The African river martin (Pseudochelidon eurystomina) is a {{passerine}} bird, one of {{two members}} of the river martin subfamily of the swallow family, Hirundinidae. When discovered, it was not initially recognised as a swallow, and its structural differences from most of its relatives, including its stout bill and robust legs and feet, have led to its current placement in a separate subfamily shared only with the Asian white-eyed river martin. The African river martin is a large swallow, mainly black with a blue-green gloss to the head and a greener <b>tint</b> to the <b>back</b> and wings. The under-wings are brownish, the underparts are purple-black, and the flight feathers are black. This martin has red eyes, a broad orange-red bill and a black, square tail. Young birds are similar in appearance to the adults, but have browner plumage. This species has a variety of unmusical calls, and displays both in flight and on the ground, although the purpose of the terrestrial display is unknown.|$|R
50|$|The {{gravel chub}} is a {{medium-sized}} minnow usually smaller than 10 cm. Its slender body is colored silver with an olive <b>tint</b> on the <b>back</b> {{and a white}} tint on the front, followed by a crosshatch pattern all over the scales. The gravel chub is often misidentified as the streamline chub, the gravel chub can be distinguished from the streamline by the more defined crosshatch marking and lack of dark blotches along the lateral line, which runs straight from the anterior to posterior end of the fish. The gravel chub is also defined by its subterminal jaw with barbels extending from both of {{the upper and lower}} maxillary jaw bone. Their outer covering consists of small bony-ridged, cycloid scales (40-43 of these scales run along the lateral line) and a forked homocercal tail. Gravel Chubs are soft ray-finned fish and have no adipose fin. The pectoral fins are pointed made up of approximately 13-16 rays and located relatively low on the body, typical of primitive species. The pelvic fins are rounded, made up of eight rays and located further back posterior to the dorsal fin in the abdominal position. The caudal fin is moderately forked and pointed.|$|R
