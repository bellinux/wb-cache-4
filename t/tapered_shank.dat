50|$|This shank {{was common}} before 1850, {{and is still}} in production. At first, the <b>tapered</b> <b>shank</b> was just rammed into a square hole {{in the end of}} the drill. Over time, various chuck designs have been invented, and modern chucks can grasp and drive this shank effectively.|$|E

50|$|Most {{drill bits}} for {{consumer}} use have straight shanks. For heavy duty drilling in industry, bits with <b>tapered</b> <b>shanks</b> are sometimes used. Other types shanks used include hex-shaped, and various proprietary quick release systems.|$|R
50|$|Tools with a <b>tapered</b> <b>shank</b> are {{inserted}} into a matching tapered socket and pushed or twisted into place. They are then retained by friction. In some cases, the friction fit {{needs to be}} made stronger, as {{with the use of a}} drawbar, essentially a long bolt that holds the tool into the socket with more force than is possible by other means.|$|E
50|$|Threaded {{fasteners}} {{either have}} a <b>tapered</b> <b>shank</b> or a non-tapered shank. Fasteners with tapered shanks {{are designed to}} either be driven into a substrate directly or into a pilot hole in a substrate. Mating threads are formed in the substrate as these fasteners are driven in. Fasteners with a non-tapered shank are designed to mate with a nut or to be driven into a tapped hole.|$|E
50|$|For light loads (such as {{encountered}} by a lathe tailstock or a drill press), tools with self-holding tapers are simply slipped onto {{or into the}} spindle; {{the pressure of the}} spindle against the workpiece drives the <b>tapered</b> <b>shank</b> tightly into the tapered hole. The friction across the entire surface area of the interface provides a large amount of torque transmission, so that splines or keys are not required.|$|E
5000|$|End-milling cutters with a Morse <b>taper</b> <b>shank</b> with a tang are {{occasionally}} seen: {{for security}} these {{must be used}} with a C-collar or similar, fitting into the neck between cutter and shank, and pulling back against the large end of the taper ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Tapered</b> <b>shanks</b> [...] "stick" [...] in {{a socket}} best when both the shank and the socket are clean. Shanks can be wiped clean, but sockets, being deep and inaccessible, are best cleaned with a {{specialized}} taper cleaning tool which is inserted, twisted, and removed.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Boring head on Morse <b>taper</b> <b>shank.</b> A small {{boring bar}} is {{inserted}} {{into one of}} the holes. The head can be shifted left or right with fine gradation by a screw, adjusting the diameter of the circle that the cutting tip swings through, thus controlling the hole size, even down to within 10 micrometres if all machining conditions are good.|$|R
5000|$|The {{flexibility}} {{is also used}} to provide accurate axial location. An HSK toolholder has both a <b>tapered</b> <b>shank,</b> and a flange with a mating surface. The shank is short (about half as long as other machine tapers), with a shallow taper (a ratio of 1:10), and slightly too large to allow the flange to seat fully in the socket. The thin walls, short shank and shallow taper provide a large opening {{in the back of the}} tool. An expanding collet fits in there, and mates with 30Â° chamfer inside the shank. As the drawbar retracts, it expands the collet and pulls the shank back into the socket, compressing the shank until the flange seats against the front of the socket. This provides a stiff, repeatable connection ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Tapered</b> <b>shank</b> {{tools are}} removed from a socket using {{different}} approaches, depending {{on the design of}} the socket. In drill presses and similar tools, the tool is removed by inserting a wedge shaped block of metal called a [...] "drift" [...] into a rectangular shaped cross hole through the socket and tapping it. As the cross section of the drift gets larger when the drift is driven further in, {{the result is that the}} drift, bearing against the foremost edge of the tang, pushes the tool out. In many lathe tailstocks, the tool is removed by fully withdrawing the quill into the tailstock, which brings the tool up against the end of the leadscrew or an internal stud, separating the taper and releasing the tool. Where the tool is retained by a drawbar, as in some mill spindles, the drawbar is partially unthreaded with a wrench and then tapped with a hammer, which separates the taper, at which point the tool can be further unthreaded and removed. Some mill spindles have a captive drawbar which ejects the tool when actively unscrewed past the loose stage; these do not require tapping. For simple sockets with open access to the back end, a drift punch is inserted axially from behind and the tool tapped out.|$|E
40|$|A {{drill bit}} loader is {{described}} for loading a <b>tapered</b> <b>shank</b> of a drill bit into a similarly tapered recess {{in the end}} of a drill spindle. The spindle has a transverse slot at the inner end of the recess. The end of the <b>tapered</b> <b>shank</b> of the drill bit has a transverse tang adapted to engage in the slot so that the drill bit will be rotated by the spindle. The loader {{is in the form of}} a cylinder adapted to receive the drill bit with the shank projecting out of the outer end of the cylinder. Retainer pins prevent rotation of the drill bit in the cylinder. The spindle is lowered to extend the shank of the drill bit into the recess in the spindle and the spindle is rotated to align the slot in the spindle with the tang on the shank. A spring unit in the cylinder is compressed by the drill bit during its entry into the recess of the spindle and resiliently drives the tang into the slot in the spindle when the tang and slot are aligned. In typical remote drilling operations, whether in hot cells or water pits, drill bits have been held using a collet or end mill type holder with set screws. In either case, to load or change a drill bit required the use master-slave manipulators to position the bits and tighten the collet or set screws. This requirement eliminated many otherwise useful work areas because they were not equipped with slaves, particularly in water pits...|$|E
50|$|To use {{a cutting}} tool within a CNC machine there is a basic holder {{required}} to mount it on the machine's spindle or turret. For CNC milling machines, {{there are two types}} of holder. There are <b>shank</b> <b>taper</b> (SK) and hollow <b>shank</b> <b>taper</b> (HSK).|$|R
5000|$|The Morse taper {{allows the}} bit to be mounted {{directly}} into the spindle of a drill, lathe tailstock, or (with the use of adapters) into the spindle of milling machines. It is a self-locking (or self holding) taper of approximately 5/8" [...] per foot that allows the torque {{to be transferred to}} the drill bit by the friction between the <b>taper</b> <b>shank</b> and the socket. The tang {{at the end of the}} taper is only for ejecting the drill bit from the spindle, with the aid of a drift.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Various design charts of ample {{validity}} and prompt access are presented, which per-mit the contact stresses within the lug of a pinned connection to be forecast {{in the presence}} of an initial clearance between the pin periphery and the lug bore. To cover the range of the practically encountered geometries and loadings, round-ended lugs of various widths and with a variously <b>tapered</b> <b>shank</b> are considered, and several inclinations of the applied load are addressed. The charts are compiled with the aid of finite elements. The employment of the recently proposed load factor F allows the combined effects on the peak contact stresses of the load intensity and of the initial clearance to be predicted...|$|E
40|$|Whole-cell {{recording}} is {{the most}} widely used configuration of the patch recording technique, mainly because it allows to manipulate the intracellular environment while recording membrane current. However, the patch pipette <b>tapered</b> <b>shank</b> and the small tip opening give high access resistances and preclude efficient exchange between pipette solution and cell cytosol. Independently by the recording configuration, another problem of this technique is to gain consistently tight seals. Here it is described a method to enlarge the pipette shank without affecting the tip opening diameter, through the calibrated combination of heat and air pressure, with a custom made inexpensive set-up. These pressure polished pipettes give small access resistances, and allow the accommodation of pulled quartz or plastic perfusion tubes very close to the pipette tip (to deliver exogenous molecules into the cytosol with a controlled timing). Finally, it is also described a method to consistently attain seals with pipettes made from just one glass type, {{on a wide variety of}} cell types, isolated from different amphibian, reptilian, fish, and mammalian tissues, and on artificial membranes composed by many different lipid mixtures...|$|E
40|$|What I {{would like}} to talk about today is {{essentially}} a portion of a program that has been sponsored by the AFOSR. The primary objectives of the program are to try and analyze defects associated with fastener holes. These include straight-shank fastener holes, <b>tapered</b> <b>shank</b> fastener holes, and cold-worked holes. The total scope of the program is to try and understand the factors that affect the detection capabilities associated with the fastener hole, both with the fastener in place and with the fastener out (including metallurgical, geometric, and local stresses), and {{to see if there is}} some way of characterizing the size, the shape and the orientation of the hole in the hope of differentiating between what might be considered a benign defect versus a critical defect. A benign defect, for example, could be some scratches on the inside of the hole that might not be expected to grow.

50|$|Tools with an R8 taper are {{inserted}} {{directly into}} the machine's spindle. R8 collets are typically used to hold tooling with round shanks, although any shape can be held if the collet has the correct corresponding shape cut in it. The collets have a precision bore with axial compression slots for holding cutting tools and are threaded for the drawbar. The R8 system is commonly used with collets {{ranging in size from}} â³ to â³ in diameter or tool holders with the same or slightly larger diameters. The collets or tool holders are placed {{directly into the}} spindle and the drawbar is tightened into the top of the collet or tool holder from above the spindle. Other tools such as drill chucks, fly cutters, indexable insert cutters, etc. may have an R-8 <b>taper</b> <b>shank</b> built into or added to the tool.|$|R

40|$|Suppression or {{elimination}} of burr formation {{at the exit}} edge of the workpiece during drilling is essential to make quality products. In this work, low alloy steel specimens have been drilled to observe burr height under different machining conditions. <b>Taper</b> <b>shank,</b> uncoated 14 [*]mm diameter HSS twist drills are used in these experiments. Dry environment is maintained in experiment set I. Water is applied as cutting fluid in experiment set II. In the next four sets of experiments, the effect of providing back-up support material and exit edge bevel is observed on formation of burr at the exit edge of specimens under dry and wet conditions. It is revealed that an exit edge bevel of 31 degrees with water as the cutting fluid gives negligible burr at the exit edge of the drilled hole at certain machining conditions. Use of a back-up support can also reduce drill burr to a large extent. In this paper, artificial neural networks (ANN) are developed for modeling experimental results, and modeled values show close matching with the experimental results with small deviations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{characterizes the}} Utah Slant Optrode Array (USOA) {{as a means}} to deliver {{infrared}} light deep into tissue. An undoped crystalline silicon (100) substrate was used to fabricate 10 Ã 10 arrays of optrodes with rows of varying lengths from 0. 5 mm to 1. 5 mm on a 400 -Âµm pitch. Light delivery from optical fibers and loss mechanisms through these Si optrodes were characterized, with the primary loss mechanisms being Fresnel reflec-tion, coupling, radiation losses from the <b>tapered</b> <b>shank</b> and total internal reflection in the tips. Transmission at the optrode tips with different optical fiber core diameters and light in-coupling interfaces was investigated. At Î» = 1. 55 Âµm, the highest optrode transmittance of 34. 7 %, relative to the optical fiber output power, was obtained with a 50 -Âµm multi-mode fiber butt-coupled to the optrode through an intervening medium of index n = 1. 66. Maximum power is directed into the optrodes when using fibers with core diameters of 200 Âµm or less. In addition, the output power varied with the optrode length/taper such that longer and less tapered optrodes exhibited higher light transmission efficiency. Output beam profiles and potential impacts on physiological tests were also examined. Future work is expected to improve USOA efficiency to greater than 64 %...|$|E
40|$|During machining, cutting forces exerted on a {{toolholder}} {{will cause}} its shank to bend within the spindle. If the shank 2 Ì 7 s deflections {{are larger than}} the gap separating the two surfaces, impacting will occur. The repetitive impacting motion between the spindle and toolholder results in a fretting condition. Over time, this will lead to wear and corrosion damage that is costly to repair and can potentially affect machining performance. Typical means of dealing with fretting {{include the use of}} surface treatments such as coatings or the use of wear resistant materials. However, these are only treatments and not solutions. Although they may reduce fretting damage, they do not prevent the fretting condition. The proper solution would be to prevent the contact that causes the fretting. Through finite element simulations and experimental testing, modal analysis was performed on various toolholder designs. Since different designs will have different dynamic characteristics, the goal was to find those designs that would minimize shank deflections, and thus minimize fretting damage. Two types of toolholders were studied: straight shank and <b>tapered</b> <b>shank.</b> The design of each was altered by varying the overall length and diameter. Within typical operating frequencies, it was generally found that shank deflections were less in tapered designs than in straight designs and that the deflections decreased as the length of the toolholder decreased. Increasing the diameter had no significant effect on deflections. By understanding how design modifications can affect shank deflections, a toolholder can be created to minimize the chance of fretting. Dept. of Mechanical, Automotive, and Materials Engineering.

40|$|The elastic maximum {{equivalent}} stress in a pin-loaded, straight- or taper-shanked, round-ended lug subject to inclined loading is investigated using the finite element and the boundary element methods, and, partly, photoelasticity. The {{influence of the}} load direction, of the ratio between the bore diameter and lug width, and of the <b>shank</b> <b>taper</b> angle are particularly addressed. In addition, {{the effects of the}} axial length of the lug trunk and, partially, of the initial clearance between the lug bore and pin are numerically examined {{in the presence of a}} loading variously inclined to the lug axis. An interpolating expression for the maximum {{equivalent stress}} as a function of the ratio between the bore diameter and lug width, taper angle, and load inclination angle is proposed...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{the stress}} {{state in a}} round-ended, taper-shanked lug loaded by an oblique point force is investigated. Numerical, {{analytical}} and, partially, photoelastic studies were carried out. In the analytical model, the lug is modelled as a plane problem, and it is partially likened to a ring examined with a Michell-type series solution; the differences in shape between lug and ring are overcome by endowing the series solution with degrees of freedom suitable for adapting the ring solution to the lug actual geometry.

40|$|A {{metallic}} threaded composite fastener, particularly {{suited for}} high temperature applications, has a body member made of {{high temperature resistant}} composite material with a ceramic coating. The body member has a head portion configured to be installed in a countersunk hole and a shank portion which is noncircular and tapered. One part of the shank may be noncircular and the other part tapered, or {{the two types of}} surface could be combined into a frustum of a noncircular cone. A split collar member made of high strength, high temperature tolerant metal alloy is split into two halves and the interior of the halves are configured to engage the shank. The exterior of the collar has a circumferential groove which receives a lock ring to secure the collar halves to the shank. In the assembled condition torque may be transmitted from the body to the split collar by the engaged noncircular portions to install and remove the fastener assembly into or from a threaded aperture and shear loads in the collar threads are transferred to the <b>shank</b> <b>tapered</b> portion as a combination of radial compression and axial tension loads. Thus, tension loads may be applied to the fastener shank without damaging the ceramic coating...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the shape of}} canine teeth {{under the assumption that}} the toothâs morphology is optimized by the evolutionary trade-off to minimize breakage and maximize ease of the penetration of prey. A series of experiments using artificial teeth to puncture the hides of a deer Odocoileus virginianus and pig Sus scrofa domesticus were conducted to establish the relationships between the tooth shape and the force needed to puncture the hide. The shapes of these teeth were also used in a beam theory analysis to calculate the strength of the teeth. Because the relative costs of puncturing and breakage were not known, a complete prediction of tooth shape was not possible. Instead, we used two independent measures of tooth shape: aspect ratio (total tooth length/tooth width at base) and rate of <b>taper</b> along the <b>shank</b> of the tooth. We quantified rate of taper in several species of felids, and by assuming this was the optimal design, we determined the relative costs of breakage and puncturing that would produce such a taper. Then, we used the relative costs to predict the aspect ratio of the optimum tooth. The average predicted value is about 2. 5, very close to the average value in extant species of cats...|$|R
