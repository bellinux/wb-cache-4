50|$|Aware of {{the scenic}} {{location}} of Mount Rigi, Swiss engineer Niklaus Riggenbach masterminded {{the construction of}} a railway from Vitznau, on the shores of Lake Lucerne and the southern flank of Mount Rigi, to a point close to its summit.

5000|$|Where {{the line}} is too steep to rely on {{adhesion}} for climbing, a rack railway may be used, in which a toothed cog wheel engages with a <b>toothed</b> <b>rack</b> rail laid between the tracks. A now little used alternative to the rack and pinion railway is the Fell system, in which traction and/or braking wheel are applied to a central rail under pressure.|$|E

25|$|The line {{uses the}} Abt rack system devised by Roman Abt, a Swiss {{locomotive}} engineer. The system comprises {{a length of}} <b>toothed</b> rail (the <b>rack)</b> between the running rails which meshes with a toothed wheel (the pinion) mounted on each rail vehicle's driving axle. The traditional logo for the railway is a pinion ring engaged on a rack bar. At the stations and passing loops, the real items are mounted on steel frames.|$|R
50|$|Because only a {{lightweight}} locomotive could work on cast iron rails without breaking them, the total load they {{were capable of}} hauling was very much limited.In 1811, John Blenkinsop patented a <b>toothed</b> wheel and <b>rack</b> rail system.

5000|$|A few early watches had a Barrow {{regulator}}, {{which used}} a worm drive, {{but the first}} widely used regulator was invented by Thomas Tompion around 1680. [...] In the Tompion regulator the curb pins were mounted on a semicircular <b>toothed</b> <b>rack,</b> which was adjusted by fitting a key to a cog and turning it. The modern regulator, a lever pivoted concentrically with the balance wheel, was patented by Joseph Bosley in 1755, but it didn't replace the Tompion regulator until the early 19th century.|$|E
50|$|The {{rotating}} fantail {{turns the}} cap of the windmill via {{a system of}} gearing to a <b>toothed</b> <b>rack</b> {{around the top of}} the mill tower, or to wheels running {{on the ground in the}} case of a post mill. It does so until the fantail sails are oriented parallel to the wind, as in this case the wind can no longer move them. When the fantail is oriented parallel to the wind, the main sails are in the optimal perpendicular orientation and produce maximum power.|$|E
50|$|His {{work was}} further {{researched}} and improved by a German engineer Nikolaus August Otto, who was later to invent the first 4-stroke engine to efficiently burn fuel directly in a piston chamber. In August 1864 Otto met Eugen Langen who, being technically trained, glimpsed {{the potential of}} Otto's development, and {{one month after the}} meeting, founded the first engine factory in the world, NA Otto & Cie, in Cologne. In 1867 Otto patented his improved design and it was awarded the Grand Prize at the 1867 Paris World Exhibition. This atmospheric engine worked by drawing a mixture of gas and air into a vertical cylinder. When the piston has risen about eight inches, the gas and air mixture is ignited by a small pilot flame burning outside, which forces the piston (which is connected to a <b>toothed</b> <b>rack)</b> upwards, creating a partial vacuum beneath it. No work is done on the upward stroke. The work is done when the piston and <b>toothed</b> <b>rack</b> descend under the effects of atmospheric pressure and their own weight, turning the main shaft and flywheels as they fall. Its advantage over the existing steam engine was its ability to be started and stopped on demand, making it ideal for intermittent work such as barge loading or unloading.|$|E

40|$|Purpose. During {{operation}} of cold-pilgering mills {{rotation of the}} shafts is carried out by means of pinion gears being in meshing with stationary gear racks, which is accompanied by various tribological defects, that can be avoided during the detailed investigation and justification of selection and evaluation of kinematic and tribological characteristics of the system "pinion - gear rack". Methodology. Runout occurs {{as a consequence of}} increased friction and depends on the material hardness of which pinions and <b>toothed</b> <b>racks</b> are manufactured, their thermal treatment, selection of correct lubrication, insufficient oil purity and its untimely change, gears overload and other factors. To assess the runout of tribological pair cogs "pinion - gear rack" of the cold-pilgering mills we will use a system of differential equations of the first order. Using the solution of this system under the given conditions, it is possible to obtain relations for kinematic and tribological parameters. Findings. Relations for the durability, runout, sliding speed, and length of the line of the tribological pair "pinion - gear rack" contact are obtained. They provide high indicators of runout and durability of the system with minimum weight and overall dimensions of the design, which is an important factor to increase efficiency of cold-pilgering mills. Originality. The analysis of the relations, which was obtained to identify durability, wear, sliding speed, and the length of the line of the tribological pair "pinion - gear rack" contact allows you to choose for cold-pilgering mills special pinions with the design parameters, which optimally satisfy the technological conditions of rolling. Practical value. Analytical determination of the slip velocity for tribological pair makes it possible to adjust the technical process of cold-pilgering mills and to make constructive changes in the system of "pinion - gear rack" in order to increase its wear resistance...|$|R
50|$|The ship's stockless bower anchors weighed 10 tons, {{attached}} to 125 ton, 330 fathom chains all manufactured by N. Hingley & Sons Ltd. The steam capstans {{to raise them}} were constructed by Napier Brothers Ltd, of Glasgow. The turbines were 25 ft long with 12 ft diameter rotors, the large diameter necessary because of the relatively low speeds at which they operated. The rotors were constructed on site, while the casings and shafting was constructed in John Brown's Atlas works in Sheffield. The machinery to drive the 56 ton rudder was constructed by Brown Brothers of Edinburgh. A main steering engine drove the rudder through worm gear and clutch operating on a <b>toothed</b> quadrant <b>rack,</b> with a reserve engine operating separately on the rack via a chain drive for emergency use. The 17 ft three bladed propellers were fitted and then cased in wood to protect them during the launch.|$|R
50|$|A {{rack railway}} (also {{rack-and-pinion}} railway, cog railway, or cogwheel railway) is a steep grade railway with a <b>toothed</b> <b>rack</b> rail, usually between the running rails. The trains are fitted {{with one or}} more cog wheels or pinions that mesh with this rack rail. This allows the trains to operate on steep grades above around 7 to 10%, which is the maximum for friction-based rail. Most rack railways are mountain railways, although a few are transit railways or tramways built to overcome a steep gradient in an urban environment.|$|E
50|$|The Benz Patent-Motorwagen was a {{three-wheeled}} automobile with a rear-mounted engine. The vehicle contained {{many new}} inventions. It was constructed of steel tubing with woodwork panels. The steel-spoked wheels and solid rubber tires were Benz's own design. Steering was {{by way of}} a <b>toothed</b> <b>rack</b> that pivoted the unsprung front wheel. Fully elliptic springs were used at the back along with a live axle and chain drive on both sides. A simple belt system served as a single-speed transmission, varying torque between an open disc and drive disc.|$|E
50|$|Soon, {{the company}} was looking for {{alternatives}} to the staff and cost-intensive rack railway operations (which with {{the maintenance of the}} Prussian T 26 rack locomotives and the <b>toothed</b> <b>rack</b> sections, particularly in winter, were complex and expensive). As early as 1923, both class 94.5-17 and class 95 locomotives were tested. However, the class 95 locomotives proved to be too heavy because they damaged the rail track superstructure. The experiments with class 94.5-17 locomotives however proved satisfactory and thus the changeover to adhesion operations occurred in 1927 with steam locomotives that could operate on the rack sections (with Riggenbach counter-pressure brakes), which now also hauled the trains while facing uphill because of the comprehensive introduction of fail-safe air brakes and more powerful locomotives.|$|E
5000|$|The gun was transported {{in three}} loads - body and cradle, bed, barrel - towed by either heavy horses or a Holt tractor. The {{equipment}} comprised a segment shaped ground platform assembled from steel section and bolted to a holdfast sunk {{flush with the}} ground. An earth box fitted above ground {{to the front of}} the holdfast, with 9 LT (Mk 1) or 11 LT (Mk 2) of earth prevented it [...] "bucking". On soft ground, extra beams were used under the holdfast. [...] The carriage was mounted on the platform, it was pivoted at the front and traversed up to 30 degrees left and right by a spur gear engaging a curved <b>toothed</b> <b>rack</b> at the breech end of the platform, with the weight of the carriage on rollers.|$|E
5000|$|A central draught lamp, or Argand lamp, {{works in}} the same manner as the flat wick lamp. The burner is {{equipped}} with a tall glass chimney, of around 12 inches tall or taller, to provide the powerful draft this lamp requires to burn properly. The burner uses a wick, usually made of cotton, that is made of a wide, flat wick rolled into a tube, the seam of which is then stitched together to form the complete wick. The tubular wick is then mounted into a [...] "carrier," [...] which is some form of a <b>toothed</b> <b>rack</b> that engages into the gears of the wick-raising mechanism of the burner and allows the wick to be raised and lowered. The wick rides in between the inner and outer wick tubes; the inner wick tube (central draft tube) provides the [...] "central draft" [...] or draft that supplies air to the flame spreader. When the lamp is lit, the central draft tube supplies air to the flame spreader that spreads out the flame into a ring of fire and allows the lamp to burn cleanly.|$|E

Next, the whole Achilles tendon was prelevated from each specimen with a calcaneal bone block. All soft tissues including the paratenon were removed from around the tendon. The calcaneal bone block was clamped between two steel plates with a rim on the end. The proximal part of the Achilles tendon was fixed in a custom made clamp with a polymer <b>toothed</b> <b>rack.</b> The tendon was kept moist at all time during the experiment using a wet cloth and water spray.|$|E
