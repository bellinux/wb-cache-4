Time–activity curves were generated using data {{extracted from the}} PET images by applying the spherical (radius 4  mm) regions of interest images centred on <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> <b>coordinates</b> of each cluster. Total distribution volume (VT), which reflects the H 3 receptor density in the brain, was calculated using Ichise’s multilinear analysis (MA 1) [11] with the time–activity curves for the initial 60  min and plasma input functions according to the previous quantitative analysis of [11 C] TASP 457 –PET data [6]. The correlation analyses between MRI (ß value) and PET (VT) data were conducted with IBM SPSS Statistics, version 23 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). To compensate for the small sample size, we used a resampling procedure based on 5000 bootstrapped samples, using bias-correlated and accelerated (BCa) 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) to estimate Pearson’s correlation coefficient for the neural activity and VT.|$|E
40|$|Type 2 {{diabetes}} mellitus (T 2 DM) {{has been associated}} with cognitive impairment. However, its neurological mechanism remains elusive. Combining regional homogeneity (ReHo) and functional connectivity (FC) analyses, the present study aimed to investigate brain functional alterations in middle-aged T 2 DM patients, which could provide complementary information for the neural substrates underlying T 2 DM-associated brain dysfunction. Twenty-five T 2 DM patients and 25 healthy controls were involved in neuropsychological testing and structural and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data acquisition. ReHo analysis was conducted to determine <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> <b>coordinates</b> of brain regions with abnormal local brain activity synchronization. Then, the identified brain regions were considered as seeds, and FC between these brain regions and global voxels was computed. Finally, the potential correlations between the imaging indices and neuropsychological data were also explored. Compared with healthy controls, T 2 DM patients exhibited higher ReHo values in the anterior cingulate gyrus and lower ReHo in right fusiform gyrus, right precentral gyrus and right medial orbit of the superior frontal gyrus. Considering these areas as seed regions, T 2 DM patients displayed aberrant FC, mainly in the frontal and parietal lobes. The pattern of FC alterations in T 2 DM patients was characterized by decreased connectivity and positive to negative or negative to positive converted connectivity. Digital Span Test forward scores revealed significant correlations with the ReHo values of the right precentral gyrus (ρ = 0. 527, p = 0. 014) and FC between the right fusiform gyrus and middle temporal gyrus (ρ = - 0. 437, p = 0. 048). Our findings suggest that T 2 DM patients suffer from cognitive dysfunction related to spatially local and remote brain activity synchronization impairment. The patterns of ReHo and FC alterations shed light on the mechanisms underlying T 2 DM-associated brain dysfunction and might serve as imaging biomarkers for diagnosis and evaluation...|$|E

Neuroimaging meta-analysis is used to 1) identify areas of consistent activation; and 2) build a predictive model of task type or cognitive process for new studies (reverse inference). To simultaneously address these aims, we propose a Bayesian point process hierarchical model for CBMA. We model the foci from each study as a doubly stochastic Poisson process, where the study-specific log intensity function is characterised as a linear combination of a high-dimensional basis set. A sparse representation of the intensities is guaranteed through latent factor modeling of the basis coefficients.

40|$|We {{present an}} e$cient indexing/matching {{algorithm}} that {{is independent of}} the changes in the illuminant color and the geometric conditions for 3 -D object with multiple colors. The color contents of an object can be represented bythe <b>peak</b> <b>coordinates</b> in <b>the</b> chromaticityhistogram space corresponding to the distinct colors in an image. The visible color areas and their relative sizes of the histograms maychange with viewing conditions, but the coordinates of local maxima remain stable. However, a change in illumination color results in a deformation of the chromaticitydistribution so as to degrade the performance of color recognition. In order to discount lighting change, we de&quot;ne a chromatic invariant that normalizes the chromaticities of <b>the</b> histogram <b>peaks</b> bythe norm of each channel. Therefore, the normalized <b>coordinates</b> of <b>the</b> <b>peaks</b> are stable to the changes in illumination color, scaling, rotation, partial occlusion, viewing direction, and deformation.

40|$|Ventral {{intermediate}} nucleus thalamotomy is {{an effective}} treatment for Parkinson's disease tremor. However, its mechanism is still unclear. We used resting-state fMRI to investigate short-term ReHo changes after unilateral thalamotomy in tremor-dominant PD, and to speculate about its possible mechanism on tremor suppression. 26 patients and 31 healthy subjects (HS) were recruited. Patients {{were divided into two}} groups according to right- (rPD) and left-side (lPD) thalamotomy. Tremor was assessed using the 7 -item scale from the Unified Parkinson's disease rating scale motor score (mUPDRS). Patients were scanned using resting state fMRI after 12 h withdrawal of medication, both preoperatively (PDpre) and 7 - day postoperatively (PDpost), whereas healthy subjects were scanned once. The regions associated with tremor and altered ReHo due to thalamic ablation were examined. The impact of unilateral VIM thalamotomy was characterized in the frontal, parietal, temporal regions, basal ganglia, thalamus, and cerebellum. Compared with PDpre, significantly reduced ReHo was found in the left cerebellum in patients with rPDpost, and slightly decreased ReHo in the cerebellum vermis in patients with lPDpost, which was significantly higher than HS. We demonstrated a positive correlation between the ReHo values in the cerebellum (in rPD, <b>peak</b> <b>coordinate</b> [- 12, - 54, - 21], R = 0. 64, P = 0. 0025, and <b>peak</b> <b>coordinate</b> [- 9, - 54, - 18], R = 0. 71, P = 0. 0025; in lPD, <b>peak</b> <b>coordinate</b> [3, - 45, - 15], R = 0. 71, P = 0. 004) in the pre-surgical condition, changes of ReHo induced by thalamotomy (in rPD, R = 0. 63, P = 0. 021, R = 0. 6, P = 0. 009; in lPD, R = 0. 58, P = 0. 028) and tremor scores contralateral to the surgical side, respectively.

40|$|Meta-analyses are {{essential}} to summarize {{the results of the}} growing number of neuroimaging studies in psychiatry, neurology and allied disciplines. Image-based meta-analyses use full image information (i. e. the statistical parametric maps) and well-established statistics, but images are rarely available making them highly unfeasible. Peak-probability meta-analyses such as activation likelihood estimation (ALE) or multilevel kernel density analysis (MKDA) are more feasible as they only need reported <b>peak</b> <b>coordinates.</b> Signed-differences methods, such as signed differential mapping (SDM) build upon the positive features of existing peak-probability methods and enable meta-analyses of studies comparing patients with controls.
