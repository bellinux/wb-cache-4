25|$|The {{incident}} led Boeing {{to modify}} the <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser</b> <b>system</b> to prevent similar occurrences by adding sync-locks, which prevent the thrust reversers from deploying when the main landing gear truck tilt angle is not at the ground position.|$|E
50|$|Co-pilot {{attempted}} to operate left engine thrust reverser override switch, {{that would allow}} the <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser</b> <b>system</b> to stow the reverser in flight.|$|E
50|$|Boeing 737 was {{designed}} such that when in air (as detected by weight on main gear) the <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser</b> <b>system</b> is de-energized. It then either remains at its last achieved position, or is opened by aerodynamic forces {{if it was}} opened by at least 2 inches.|$|E
50|$|In early August 1991, Boeing {{issued an}} alert to {{airlines}} stating that over 1,600 late model 737s, 757s, 767s, and 747s had thrust-reverser systems {{similar to that}} of the OE-LAV. On Monday, 9 September 1991, the Boeing Commercial Airplane Group asked its customers to replace a valve in the <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser</b> <b>systems</b> that could cause the <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser</b> to deploy in flight.|$|R
2500|$|NTSB {{investigators}} {{examined and}} tested the antiskid, autobrake, and <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser</b> <b>systems</b> on the aircraft. The autobrake selector switch {{in the cockpit}} {{was found in the}} [...] "max" [...] position. The tailcone handle in the main cabin had been actuated, presumably for evacuation purposes, and the rear tailcone had detached.|$|R
40|$|The key {{features}} of the integrated propulsion systems developed for short haul aircraft are discussed including the high Mach number, fixed geometry, near sonic inlet, the variable area nozzles, <b>thrust</b> <b>reversing</b> <b>systems,</b> and aircraft accessory location. The roles and interplay of each element are considered and comparisons are made with conventional state-of-the-art technology...|$|R
50|$|The cold stream {{system is}} known for {{structural}} integrity, reliability, and versatility. During thrust reverser activation, a sleeve mounted {{around the perimeter of}} the aircraft engine nacelle moves aft to expose cascade vanes which act to redirect the engine fan flow. This <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser</b> <b>system</b> can be heavy and difficult to integrate into nacelles housing large engines.|$|E
50|$|FHA {{results are}} {{normally}} shown in spreadsheet form, with columns identifying function, failure condition, phase of flight, effect, hazard classification, DAL, means of detection, aircrew response, and related information. Each hazard is assigned a unique identifier that is tracked {{throughout the entire}} safety life cycle. One approach is to identify systems by their ATA system codes and the corresponding hazards by derivative identifiers. For example, the <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser</b> <b>system</b> could be identified by its ATA code 78-30. Untimely deployment of thrust reverser would be a hazard, which could be assigned an identifier based on ATA code 78-30.|$|E
5000|$|As {{evidence}} {{started to}} point towards the thrust reversers {{as the cause}} of the accident, simulator flights were made at Gatwick Airport which appeared to show that deployment of a thrust reverser was a survivable incident. Lauda said that the thrust reverser could not be the sole cause of the crash. The accident report states that the [...] "flightcrew training simulators yielded erroneous results" [...] and stated that recovery from the loss of lift from the reverser deployment [...] "was uncontrollable for an unexpecting flight crew".The incident led Boeing to modify the <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser</b> <b>system</b> to prevent similar occurrences by adding sync-locks, which prevent the thrust reversers from deploying when the main landing gear truck tilt angle is not at the ground position.|$|E
50|$|<b>Reverse</b> <b>thrust</b> mode is {{used only}} for a {{fraction}} of aircraft operating time but affects it greatly in terms of design, weight, maintenance, performance, and cost. Penalties are significant but necessary since it provides stopping force for added safety margins, directional control during landing rolls, and aids in rejected take-offs and ground operations on contaminated runways where normal braking effectiveness is diminished. Airlines consider <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser</b> <b>systems</b> a vital part of reaching a maximum level of aircraft operating safety.|$|R
50|$|Thrust reversal, {{also called}} <b>reverse</b> <b>thrust,</b> is the {{temporary}} diversion of an aircraft engine's thrust {{so that it}} is directed forward, rather than backward. <b>Reverse</b> <b>thrust</b> acts against the forward travel of the aircraft, providing deceleration. <b>Thrust</b> <b>reverser</b> <b>systems</b> are featured on many jet aircraft to help slow down just after touch-down, reducing wear on the brakes and enabling shorter landing distances. Such devices affect the aircraft significantly and are considered important for safe operations by airlines. There have been accidents involving thrust reversal systems such as Lauda Air Flight 004.|$|R
50|$|In December, 2009, Nexcelle {{became a}} partner on the world's first truly {{integrated}} propulsion system. The company {{was selected to}} provide a combined nacelle, <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser</b> and exhaust <b>system</b> for the new CFM International LEAP-X1C engine selected as the sole western powerplant to launch China’s COMAC C919 jetliner. Nexcelle’s contribution to LEAP-X on the C919 includes an innovative nacelle design that is produced with {{a significant percentage of}} composites, and which incorporates advanced acoustic treatment. It also is to be equipped with an Electrical <b>Thrust</b> <b>Reverser</b> Actuation <b>System</b> (ETRAS).|$|R
40|$|Recent {{performance}} {{testing of the}} two-dimensional convergent-divergent (2 D-CD) nozzle has established the concept as {{a viable alternative to}} the axisymmetric nozzle for advanced technology aircraft. This type of exhaust system also offers potential integration and performance advantages in the areas of thrust reversing and vectoring over axi-symmetric nozzles. These advantages include the practical integration of thrust reversers which operate not only to reduce landing roll but also operate in-flight for enhanced maneuvering and thrust spoiling. To date there is a very limited data base available from which criteria can be developed for the design and evaluation of this type of <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser</b> <b>system.</b> For this reason, a static scale model test was conducted in which five different thrust reverser designs were evaluated. Each of the five models had varying performance/integration requirements which dictated the five different designs. Some of the parameters investigated in this test included; variable angle external cascade vanes, fixed angle internal cascade vanes, variable position inner doors, external slider doors and internal slider valves. In addition, normal force and yawing moment generation was investigated using the <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser</b> <b>system.</b> Selected results from this test will be presented and discussed in this paper...|$|E
40|$|A {{case study}} {{modeling}} the <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser</b> <b>system</b> (TRS) {{in the context}} of the fatal accident of a Boeing 767 is presented to illustrate the application of Probabilistic Safety Assessment methods. A simplified risk model consisting of an event tree with supporting fault trees was developed to represent the progression of the accident, taking into account the interaction between the TRS and the operating crew during the accident, and the findings of the accident investigation. A feasible sequence of events leading to the fatal accident was identified. Several insights about the TRS and the accident were obtained by applying PSA methods. Changes proposed for the TRS also are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} a scale model static {{performance}} test of target thrust reverser configurations for the Pratt and Whitney Aircraft JT 8 D- 100 series engine are presented. The objective of the test was to select a series of suitable candidate reverser configurations for the subsequent airplane model wind tunnel ingestion and flight controls tests. Test results indicate that adequate reverse thrust performance with compatible engine airflow match is achievable for the selected configurations. Tapering of the lips results in loss of performance and only minimal flow directivity. Door pressure surveys were conducted on a selected number of lip and fence configurations to obtain data to support {{the design of the}} <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser</b> <b>system...</b>|$|E
40|$|The NASA Langley Configuration Aerodynamics Branch has {{conducted}} an experimental investigation {{to study the}} static performance of innovative <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser</b> concepts applicable to high-bypass-ratio turbofan engines. Testing was conducted on a conventional separate-flow exhaust system configuration, a conventional cascade <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser</b> configuration, and six innovative <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser</b> configurations. The innovative <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser</b> configurations consisted of a cascade <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser</b> with porous fan-duct blocker, a blockerless <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser,</b> two core-mounted target thrust reversers, a multi-door crocodile <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser,</b> and a wing-mounted <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser.</b> Each of the innovative <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser</b> concepts offer potential weight savings and/or design simplifications over a conventional cascade <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser</b> design. Testing was conducted in the Jet-Exit Test Facility at NASA Langley Research Center using a 7. 9 %-scale exhaust system model with a fan-to-core bypass ratio of approximately 9. 0. All tests were conducted with no external flow and cold, high-pressure air was used to simulate core and fan exhaust flows. Results show that the innovative <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser</b> concepts achieved <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser</b> performance levels which, when {{taking into account the}} potential for system simplification and reduced weight, may make them competitive with, or potentially more cost effective than current state-of-the-art <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser</b> <b>systems.</b> All data gathered in this investigation are contained in the CD-ROM...|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} conducted in the Jet-Exit Test Facility at NASA Langley Research Center to study the static aerodynamic performance of a wing-mounted thrust reverser concept applicable to subsonic transport aircraft. This innovative engine powered <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser</b> <b>system</b> is designed to utilize wing-mounted flow deflectors to produce aircraft deceleration forces. Testing was conducted using a 7. 9 %-scale exhaust system model with a fan-to-core bypass ratio of approximately 9. 0, a supercritical left-hand wing section attached via a pylon, and wing-mounted flow deflectors attached to the wing section. Geometric variations of key design parameters investigated for the wing-mounted thrust reverser concept included flow deflector angle and chord length, deflector edge fences, and the yaw mount angle of the deflector system (normal to the engine centerline or parallel to the wing trailing edge). All tests were conducted with no external flow and high pressure air was used to s [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Variable-pitch-fan engines may be {{attractive}} for future short-haul aircraft if sufficient reverse thrust {{is available for}} aircraft deceleration after touchdown. Thrust reversal is obtained in these engines by changing fan blade pitch about 90 deg, which causes the fan airflow to enter the fan duct nozzle and exhaust through the fan inlet. This capability would eliminate the heavy and costly <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser</b> <b>system</b> required for current fixed-pitch turbofan engines. NASA has, therefore, supported the development of advanced technology for a quiet, clean, high-bypass-ratio turbofan engine for future short-haul aircraft. In connection with this program, tests were conducted {{to determine the effect}} of forward velocity and angle of attack on steady-state reverse-thrust performance. Other objectives of the tests were related to the determination of the effect of forward velocity on forward-to-reverse thrust transient performance and the determination of the effectiveness of an overshoot blade angle technique to establish reverse thrust during a transient. The results of the tests are discussed...|$|E
50|$|A {{simple and}} {{effective}} {{method is to}} reverse {{the direction of the}} exhaust stream of the jet engine and use the power of the engine itself to decelerate. Ideally, the reversed exhaust stream would be directed straight forward. However, for aerodynamic reasons, this is not possible, and a 135° angle is taken, resulting in less effectiveness than would otherwise be possible. Thrust reversal can also be used in flight to reduce airspeed, though this is not common with modern aircraft. There are three common types of <b>thrust</b> <b>reversing</b> <b>systems</b> used on jet engines: the target, clam-shell, and cold stream systems. Some propeller-driven aircraft equipped with variable-pitch propellers can <b>reverse</b> <b>thrust</b> by changing the pitch of their propeller blades. Most commercial jetliners have such devices, and it also has applications in military aviation.|$|R
5|$|The CFM56 is {{designed}} to support several <b>reverse</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>systems</b> which help slow and stop the aircraft after landing. The variants built for the Boeing737, the CFM56-3 and the CFM56-7, use a cascade type of <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser.</b> This type of <b>thrust</b> <b>reverse</b> consists of sleeves that slide back to expose mesh-like cascades and blocker doors that block the bypass air flow. The blocked bypass air is forced through the cascades, reducing {{the thrust of the}} engine and slowing the aircraft down.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} an advanced composite fairing {{designed to reduce}} drag on DC- 9 nacelles {{as a part of}} the NASA Engine Component Improvement Program. This fairing is the aft enclosure for the <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser</b> actuator <b>system</b> on JT 8 D engine nacelles and is subjected to a 500 F exhaust flow during the <b>reverse</b> <b>thrust.</b> A reduced-drag configuration was developed by using in-flight tuft surveys for flow visualization in order to identify areas with low-quality flow, and then modifying the aerodynamic lines to improve the flow. A fabrication method for molding the part in an autoclave was developed; this material system is suitable for 500 F. The resultant composite fairing reduces the overall aircraft drag 1 % with a weight reduction of 40 % when compared with a metal component...|$|R
25|$|The {{accident}} investigation determined {{the causes of}} the accident were that the crew touched down too far down the runway, at too high a speed, following a non-stabilised approach, and that they failed to properly utilise the aircraft's brake and <b>reverse</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>systems,</b> which resulted in their being unable to stop the aircraft within the available runway and overrun distance.|$|R
25|$|One {{member of}} the Operations team of the Accident Investigation Committee had a {{different}} opinion {{from the rest of}} the Committee regarding the cause of the accident, stating that he believed the crew failed to realise the touchdown speed and distance, failed to follow the company's poor-braking-action landing technique, and failed to properly utilise the aircraft's brake and <b>reverse</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to the two types used on turbojet and low-bypass turbofan engines, a third type of <b>thrust</b> <b>reverser</b> is found on some high-bypass turbofan engines.
