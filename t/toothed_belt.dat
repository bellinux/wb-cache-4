25|$|The chief {{designer}} of most Ducati motorcycles in the 1950s was Fabio Taglioni (1920â€“2001). His designs {{ranged from the}} small single-cylinder machines that were successful in the Italian 'street races' to the large-capacity twins of the 1980s. Ducati introduced the Pantah in 1979; its engine was updated in the 1990s in the Ducati SuperSport (SS) series. All modern Ducati engines are derivatives of the Pantah, which uses a <b>toothed</b> <b>belt</b> to actuate the engine's valves. Taglioni used the Cavallino Rampante (identified with the Ferrari brand) on his Ducati motorbikes, Taglioni chose this emblem of courage and daring {{as a sign of}} respect and admiration for Francesco Baracca, a heroic World War I fighter pilot who died during an air raid in 1918.|$|E
25|$|Land Rover's radically updated {{product line}} was {{launched}} in 1983. Initially only the long-wheelbase One Ten was available and it was sold with the same engine line-up as the preceding Series III model- 2.25-litre petrol and diesel engines and the 3.5-litre Rover V8. However, Land Rover planned a series of rolling improvements. Launched shortly before the short-wheelbase Ninety model in 1984 was a 2.5-litre diesel engine. This {{was little more than}} an updated version of the existing diesel unit (at this time 22 years old). The stroke was lengthened to improve torque, and an updated cylinder head was used to reduce noise and emissions. A more modern injector pump improved fuel economy and an improved glow plug system improved cold-starting performance. The most significant change was the swapping of the chain-driven camshaft for one driven by a fibre <b>toothed</b> <b>belt,</b> which also drove the repositioned injector pump. The drive vacated by the injector pump was used to power a vacuum pump for the brake servo system. To reduce engine weight, extensive use of aluminium castings was made for the cambelt case, vacuum pump, rocker cover and other parts. Other small improvements were made such as the fitment of a spin-on cartridge oil filter instead of older, harder-to-change element type and the fitting of under-piston oil jets. In the mid-1980s Land Rover was part of the Land Rover Group, responsible for production of the Freight Rover van. The 2.5-litre diesel was fitted to the Freight Rover 300-series and the FX4 taxi (the engines for these applications had slight design changes, such as higher-mounted injector pumps and non-waterproof cambelt cases. They received the designations 14J and 15J respectively. Being fitted with a timing belt rather than a chain the 15J engine suffered none of the reliability problems in the FX4 that its 10J predecessor had encountered (see above)). The engine became a special-order only option after the introduction of turbodiesel engines (see below) but remained in production (and popular with military and some commercial buyers) until 1994. The British Army used this engine {{in the vast majority of}} the 20,000 Land Rovers it bought between 1985 and 1994. A manufacturing flaw with pistons combined with Army maintenance practises (such as a tendency to over-fill the sump with oil) caused the engines to over-breathe and ingest their oil, leading to piston failure. Late military-spec engines had a centrifugal separator in the breather system, allowing excess oil to drain back to the sump. These engines were designated 13J. and 11J (ref Land Rover Defender Military 110 1991 Supplementary Parts Catalogue). These later, modified engines were the first in their class (small capacity high-speed diesels) to pass the Ministry of Defence's arduous 500-hour durability trial.|$|E
2500|$|... 2,495 cc diesel, {{overhead}} valve, type 12J: Land Rover reworked the old 'two and a quarter' diesel for the 1980s. The {{injection pump}} was driven off a <b>toothed</b> <b>belt</b> {{at the front}} of the engine (together with the camshaft), a change compared with the older diesels.|$|E
50|$|The {{first known}} {{automotive}} application of <b>toothed</b> <b>belts</b> to drive overhead camshafts was with Devin-Panhard racing specials built by Bill Devin for the Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) H-modified racing series. Some of these specials were powered by engines built from the crankcases of Panhard flat-twin engines and the cylinders of Norton motorcycles. The overhead camshafts on the Norton cylinders were driven by <b>toothed</b> <b>belts</b> from the Gilmer Belt Company {{instead of the}} tower shafts used in the Norton engines. Jimmy Orr won the 1956 SCCA H-modified championship in an overhead camshaft Devin-Panhard.|$|R
50|$|As <b>toothed</b> <b>belts</b> {{can deliver}} {{more power than}} a friction-drive belt, they are used for {{high-power}} transmissions. These include the primary drive of some motorcycles, notably later Harley-Davidsons; and the supercharger used for dragsters.|$|R
50|$|Aero-engine {{reduction}} gears are typically of the gear type, but smaller two-stroke engines {{such as the}} Rotax 582 use <b>belt</b> drive with <b>toothed</b> <b>belts,</b> which is a cheap and lightweight option with built-in damping of power surges.|$|R

5000|$|The angular-velocity ratio {{may not be}} {{constant}} {{or equal}} to that of the pulley diameters, due to slip and stretch. However, this problem has been largely solved by the use of <b>toothed</b> <b>belts.</b> Working temperatures range from [...] to [...] Adjustment of center distance or addition of an idler pulley is crucial to compensate for wear and stretch.|$|R
50|$|With {{help from}} Norton {{motorcycle}} racer Don Evans, Devin adapted the cylinder barrels, cylinder heads and pistons from the Norton Manx motorcycle to the two-cylinder boxer Panhard crankcase, roller-bearing crankshaft assembly and piston rods. He then fabricated a custom manifold that accepted two-barrel side-draft Weber carburetors. All of these alterations {{did not affect}} the displacement of the engine, leaving the 79.5mm bore and 75mm stroke unchanged for a total displacement of 745cc. What made the engine unique was the method Devin used to operate the valves. He abandoned the Panhard's pushrod OHV system and contacted the L. H. Gilmer company about using their <b>toothed</b> <b>belts</b> to drive the Manx cylinder heads' overhead cams. Development of synchronous toothed-belts was begun by the Gilmer company around 1940. Their primary application had been as a means of transmitting power in textile mills. Devin's use of the technology to drive the valve train in the Devin-Panhard engine was the first time <b>toothed</b> <b>belts</b> were used in a timing belt application. Devin did not apply for a patent on this innovation.|$|R

50|$|The Endura-DE engine {{features}} a cast iron block and indirect injection style cylinder head, which {{means there is}} a combustion chamber built into the cylinder head. This engine makes use of aluminium for some other components to minimise the weight penalty of the Diesel engine. It has a single overhead camshaft opening eight valves via shim-and-bucket followers. The camshaft is rotated by a <b>toothed</b> <b>belt</b> driven by a toothed sprocket on the Crankshaft, likewise the fuel injection pump is rotated by a second <b>toothed</b> <b>belt</b> driven from the crankshaft. The diesel injection pump is a rotary distributor type most typically made by Lucas CAV.|$|E

50|$|Timing <b>belts,</b> <b>toothed</b> <b>belts,</b> cogged or cog belts, and {{synchronous}} belts are non-slipping {{mechanical drive}} belts. They are made as flexible belts with teeth moulded onto their inner surface. The belts run over matching toothed pulleys or sprockets. When correctly tensioned, {{these type of}} belts have no slippage, and are often used to transfer motion for indexing or timing purposes (hence their name). They are often used in lieu of chains or gears, so there is less noise and a lubrication bath is not necessary.|$|R

Its 6.10 m diameter two-bladed rotor has a chord of 20 cm, with anti-torque handled by a conventional two-bladed tail rotor. The main rotor transmission uses a combination of V-belts and <b>toothed</b> <b>belts.</b> Pitch link controls are mounted inside the hollow rotor mast tube. The aircraft has an empty weight of 193 kg and a gross weight of 386 kg, giving a useful load of 193 kg. With full fuel of 58.8 L the payload is 151 kg.|$|R

5000|$|A bicycle {{chain is}} a form of roller chain. Bicycle chains may have a master link, or may require a chain tool for removal and installation. A similar but larger and thus {{stronger}} chain is used on most motorcycles although it is sometimes replaced by either a <b>toothed</b> <b>belt</b> or a shaft drive, which offer lower noise level and fewer maintenance requirements.|$|E
50|$|The {{first known}} timing belt {{was used in}} 1945.
