One of the most famous of these artists is Liu Lanfang (1944-present), a noted singer and actress. She first made a name for herself in 1972 when she sang the full-length script of The Story of Yue Fei.

50|$|In {{contrast}} to composites, isotropic materials (for example, aluminium or steel), in standard wrought forms, typically {{have the same}} stiffness regardless of the directional orientation of the applied forces and/or moments. The relationship between forces/moments and strains/curvatures for an isotropic material can be described with <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>material</b> properties: Young's Modulus, the shear Modulus and the Poisson's ratio, in relatively simple mathematical relationships. For the anisotropic material, it requires the mathematics of a second order tensor and up to 21 material property constants. For the special case of orthogonal isotropy, there are three different material property constants for each of Young's Modulus, Shear Modulus and Poisson's ratio—a total of 9 constants to describe the relationship between forces/moments and strains/curvatures.|$|E
5000|$|In {{an essay}} {{examining}} {{the use of}} cinematic effects of time on Angel, Tammy Kinsey points out the cut sequence in this episode when Gunn {{pulls up to the}} shelter after Wesley has been shot. Although upon normal viewing it appears to simply be a few flashes of color, when played slowly it reveals itself as a shot of lightning over a field, a negative image of the scene itself, a flash of light, then a return to the positive image of the scene. The effect, Kinsey argues, is that the viewer experiences a [...] "forced pause, not unlike the musical notation of a beat" [...] which gives an unconscious impression of <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>material.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The {{reducing}} syllable can be {{the final}} one (pono(pï) to tell O, ona(mï) to bury/hide O), or the initial one ((pï)tai shoes, mïta mouth). The full form occurs when <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>material</b> (affix, stem, clitic) has a consonant cluster, i.e. is CCV-initial (the first consonant resyllabifies as the coda of the reducing syllable), or then starts with r.The reduced forms occur when {{this is not the}} case: the coda grade when a possible cluster - mp, nt, nk, ns, hp, hk, ht - results, and the length grade in the other cases (the zero grade for verb stems, when no clitics follow). Reducing syllables generally consist of a stop or nasal and the vowels ï or u (pï, pu, tï, tu..., mï, mu,...); rï and ru syllables can also reduce, but with some irregularities; wï syllables only reduce stem-initially (and apparently never have a coda grade).|$|E

This choice was also {{specifically}} emphasized by Ekaterina Andreeva, leading research associate of the State Russian Museum Department {{of the new}} wave, art critic and curator, characterizing Khvostov as an “absurdist primitivist painter of the hermitage museum culture”. She believes {{that it was an}} inheritance of traditions of the Leningrad necrorealism of the 80’s that brought along a harmonious cooperation of Khvostov and others from “the New Stupid” both art groups grew from the “New artists” movement. [...] No, it’s not difficult to find a model, but it’s easier to draw yourself. You yourself are the most disciplined and untiring sitter. Narrow bounds allow to focus on a single object, investigate his psychology Oleg Khvostov Portraits and self-portraits and lavender landscapes, borrowed from impressionists and postimpressionists, hold a special place among cross-cutting themes of Khvostov’s art works. Stanislav Savistsky (art critic, curator, lecturer of the Saint Petersburg State University Faculty of Liberal Arts and Sciences) in his “Absolute painting” exhibition review pinpointed some patterns of Khvostov’s portraiture. In his remakes of classical works and ultimate series of self-portraits the art expert traced a commonness of geometric forms, which led him to the conclusion that any of Khvostov’s portraits actually, to a varying degree, is a self-portrait - a way of searching for the artist’s self-identity. Among Khvostov’s portraits Pilikin emphasized his taste for illustrating political leaders, public men, people of religion and mass art as another cross-cutting theme, for the artist considers them to represent the spirit of his times.|$|E
