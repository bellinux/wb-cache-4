50|$|The wax <b>thermostatic</b> <b>element</b> {{was invented}} in 1936 by Sergius Vernet (1899-1968). Its {{principal}} application is in automotive thermostats used in the engine cooling system. The first applications in the plumbing and heating industries were in Sweden (1970) and in Switzerland (1971).|$|E

This wax motor principle also finds applications besides engine cooling systems, including heating system thermostatic radiator valves, plumbing, industrial, and agriculture.|$|R

He it was who first showed the way to produce malleable platinum on a com-mercial scale- incidentally the first successful example of powder metallurgy- {{and he was the}} discoverer of two new elements in native platinum which he named palladium and rhodium (I, 2). Fortunately he left a considerable quantity of notebooks and memoranda recording both his experiments and his financial transactions, most of these still preserved in the care of the University of Cambridge and others in the Science Museum, and it was in the course of examining his miscellaneous income and expenditure accounts that the writer came across an entry of particular interest. This records a payment to one Malacrida of the sum of 19 s for two platinum thermometers (3). It appears that one of these two thermo-meters was intended for the use of Wollaston’s scientific and financial partner Smithson Tennant, the discoverer of iridium and osmium, for among the miscellaneous Wollaston papers preserved at Cambridge there exists a loose sheet of paper on which is written “Platina Thermometer, for Mr Tennant”. The other was presumably employed by Wollaston himself. So far as the writer is aware no reference has been made in the literature to such a thermometer, nor has any description of it been given. There is some reason to suppose, however, that it was of the bimetallic type, with platinum as one of the compound metals and that it was a forerunner of the many kinds of <b>thermostatic</b> <b>element’s</b> that are now so widely employed.

40|$|This master‘s thesis {{deals with}} the thermal {{overload}} trip unit in automatically operated electrical switching devices. The {{first part of this}} thesis serves as a basis for a design of <b>thermostatic</b> bimetal <b>element</b> in electrical switching device. The thesis presents important parameters and calculation principles needed for the design of bimetal element. The thesis further describes the operating principle of thermal trip unit and its possible design solutions. The main part is devoted to analytical calculation and measurement of specific thermostatic bimetal type contained in thermal trip unit of molded case circuit breaker. It is measurement of force and deflection, depending on temperature change. In the next part a numerical model of the bimetallic strip was created and its deflection was simulated. The analytical results are compared with the measured and simulated results {{at the end of the}} thesis...|$|R
