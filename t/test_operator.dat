40|$|For a class L of {{languages}} let PDL[L] be {{an extension of}} Propositional Dynamic Logic which allows programs {{to be in a}} language of L rather than just to be regular. If L contains a non-regular language, PDL[L] can express non-regular properties, in contrast to pure PDL. For regular, visibly pushdown and deterministic context-free languages, the separation of the respective PDLs can be proven by automata-theoretic techniques. However, these techniques introduce non-determinism on the automata side. As non-determinism is also the difference between DCFL and CFL, these techniques seem to be inappropriate to separate PDL[DCFL] from PDL[CFL]. Nevertheless, this separation is shown but for programs without <b>test</b> <b>operators.</b> ...|$|R

A review of the literature in NPP simulator studies reveals a variety of ways to measure human performance in NPP control room simulations including direct observation, automated computer logging, recordings from physiological equipment, self-report techniques, protocol analysis and structured debriefs, and application of model-based evaluation.

40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this paper is}} to argue for an {{analysis}} of final rises in American English as ‘intonational adverbs ’ expressing epistemic uncertainty. Furthermore, it is suggested that the question-like behavior of declaratives with final rises can be derived as a secondary effect from maxims of rational conversation and is not directly due to their intonational properties.

The meaning of final rises is expressed in formal semantic terms as Veltman’s <b>test</b> <b>operator,</b> in the framework of update semantics, enriched with a simple semantics for polar questions.
