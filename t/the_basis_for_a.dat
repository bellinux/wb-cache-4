5|$|Bach {{composed}} {{an early}} chorale cantata on a hymn by Luther, Christ lag in Todes Banden, BWV 4, probably in 1707. During his chorale cantata cycle, Bach used a hymn by Luther as <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> cantata on nine occasions. He performed Christ lag in Todes Banden again during that cycle.|$|E
5|$|For {{four months}} {{beginning}} in late 1956, Eichmann was extensively interviewed by Nazi expatriate journalist Willem Sassen {{with the intention}} of producing a biography. Tapes, transcripts, and handwritten notes by Eichmann were produced. The memoirs were later used as <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> series of articles that appeared in Life and Der Stern magazines in late 1960.|$|E

5|$|The basic Su-25 {{model was}} used as <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{commercial}} export variant, known as the Su-25K (Komercheskiy). This model was also built at Factory 31 in Tbilisi, Georgia. The aircraft differed from the Soviet Air Force version in certain minor details concerning internal equipment. A total of 180 Su-25K aircraft were built between 1984 and 1989.|$|E
5|$|The {{coaching}} stock was extremely solidly constructed, and offered levels of accommodation {{far in advance}} of anything else at the time - certainly compared to any other narrow gauge railway. Almost 70 years later, the design was used as <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new rake of carriages built by the Ffestiniog - testament to the excellence of the original design.|$|E

5|$|The {{historical}} {{significance of the}} location {{has been used as}} <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> number of proposals to rename the bridge. In 1921 the Chicago Historical Society suggested that the bridge should be named Marquette–Joliet Bridge, and in 1939 it was proposed to rename the bridge as Fort Dearborn Bridge. These proposals were not adopted.|$|E
5|$|The novel {{began as}} a 1956 {{screenplay}} for the producer Henry Morgenthau III for a proposed television show entitled Commander Jamaica. When those plans foundered, Fleming adapted the ideas as <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> novel, provisionally titled The Wound Man. The book's eponymous villain was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories.|$|E
5|$|The {{trivalent}} dysprosium ion (Dy3+) {{has been}} studied due its downshifting luminescence properties. Dy-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (YAG:Dy) excited in the ultraviolet region {{of the electromagnetic spectrum}} results in the emission of photons of longer wavelength in the visible region.

5|$|The true {{impact of}} Operation Mincemeat is unknown, {{although}} {{the island was}} liberated more quickly than anticipated and losses were lower than predicted. The events were depicted in Operation Heartbreak, a 1950 novel by the former cabinet minister Duff Cooper, before one of the agents who planned and carried out Mincemeat, Ewen Montagu, wrote a history in 1953. Montagu's work formed <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> 1956 film.|$|E
5|$|This unique {{geography}} {{has greatly}} influenced Ikata's growth. On the one hand, it has presented significant challenges to urban development {{that were not}} overcome until recently in the town's long history. On the other, the peninsula is what gives the town its beautiful mountain and ocean scenery which, bolstered by significant investments in infrastructure and tourist facilities, has formed <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> burgeoning tourism industry.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} the ship arrived in Leningrad, only the two forward gun turrets had been {{installed}} and the bridge superstructure was incomplete. The only secondary guns installed were the 3.7cm anti-aircraft guns. The Soviet Navy renamed the ship Petropavlovsk on 25 September 1940, and designated the construction effort to complete the ship Projekt 83. The vessel's design provided <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> planned heavy cruiser, designated Projekt 82, although this ship was canceled before work began. Training for the Soviet crew of the ship proved to be contentious; the Soviets wanted their personnel trained in Germany, while the Germans preferred sending instructors to the Soviet Union. Language barriers and inexperience with international training missions also hampered the training effort.|$|E

5|$|Critical {{reception}} to Dynamite Headdy was positive. Critics {{highlighted the}} game's originality and creativity in distinguishing it among other {{games in the}} action-platform genre. They also commended Treasure for demonstrating their technical expertise with impressive graphical effects and building {{on the success of}} their earlier game Gunstar Heroes (1993). In reviews from the time and in retrospect, Dynamite Headdy is cited for being one of the best games on the Genesis. An 8-bit port was released for Game Gear, which itself served as <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> Master System port released exclusively in Brazil.|$|E
5|$|Father Dale Grubba, {{the priest}} who had presided over Kulwicki's funeral, {{released}} {{a biography of}} his friend entitled Alan Kulwicki: NASCAR champion Against All Odds in 2009. The book was <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> low-budget feature film, Dare to Dream: The Alan Kulwicki Story, released on April 1, 2005. The film chronicles Kulwicki's life from racing late models at Slinger Super Speedway, through his rise to NASCAR champion, and ends with his death. The movie was created by Kulwicki's Wisconsin fans for less than $100,000. The star of the film, Brad Weber, was a Kulwicki fan and credits the late driver with being his inspiration to become an actor.|$|E
5|$|In 1481 {{two local}} men, Thomas Croft and John Jay, sent off ships {{looking for the}} mythical island of Hy-Brasil. There {{was no mention of}} the island being {{discovered}} but Croft was prosecuted for illegal exports of salt, on the grounds that, as a customs officer, he should not have engaged in trade. Professor David Beers Quinn, whose theories form <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> variety of popular histories, suggested that the explorers may have discovered the Grand Banks off Newfoundland, waters rich in cod.|$|E

5|$|In February 1996, Bisceglie {{provided}} {{a copy of}} the 1971 essay written by Ted Kaczynski to the FBI. At the UNABOM Task Force headquarters in San Francisco, Supervisory Special Agent Joel Moss immediately recognized similarities in the writings. Linguistic analysis determined that the author of the essay papers and the manifesto were almost certainly the same. When combined with facts gleaned from the bombings and Kaczynski's life, that analysis provided <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> search warrant.|$|E
5|$|In {{the latter}} half of the 11th century, the Seljuk Turks began {{penetrating}} into medieval Armenia and the eastern regions of Anatolia. In 1071, the Seljuks defeated the Byzantines at the Battle of Manzikert, starting the Turkification process in the area; the Turkish language and Islam were introduced to Armenia and Anatolia, gradually spreading throughout the region. The slow transition from a predominantly Christian and Greek-speaking Anatolia to a predominantly Muslim and Turkish-speaking one was underway. Alongside the Turkification of the territory, the culturally Persianized Seljuks set <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> Turko-Persian principal culture in Anatolia, which their eventual successors, the Ottomans, would take over.|$|E
5|$|Manhunter {{focuses on}} the {{forensic}} work {{carried out by the}} FBI to track down killers and shows the long-term effects that cases like this have on profilers such as Graham, highlighting the similarities between him and his quarry. The film features heavily stylized use of color to convey this sense of duality, {{and the nature of the}} characters' similarity has been explored in academic readings of the film. It was the first film adaptation of Harris' Hannibal Lecter novels, as well as the first adaptation of Red Dragon, which later became <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> film of the same name in 2002.|$|E
