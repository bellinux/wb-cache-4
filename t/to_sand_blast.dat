5000|$|Surface {{roughness}} {{and texture}} has an undeniable influence on protein adsorption on all materials, {{but with the}} ubiquity of metal machining processes, {{it is useful to}} address how these impact protein behavior. The initial adsorption is important, as well as maintained adhesion and integrity. Research has shown that surface roughness can encourage the adhesion of scaffold proteins and osteoblasts, and results in an increase in surface mineralization. Surfaces with more topographical features and roughness will have more exposed surface area for proteins to interact with. [...] In terms of biomedical engineering applications, micromachining techniques are often used to increase protein adhesion to implants in the hopes of shortening recovery time. The technique of laserpatterning introduces grooves and surface roughness that will influence adhesion, migration and alignment. Grit-blasting, a method analogous <b>to</b> <b>sand</b> <b>blasting,</b> and chemical etching have proven to be successful surface roughening techniques that promote the long-term stability of titanium implants. The increase in stability {{is a direct result of}} the observed increase in extracellular matrix and collagen attachment, which results in increased osteoblast attachment and mineralization when compared to non-roughened surfaces. Adsorption is not always desirable, however. Machinery can be negatively affected by adsorption, particularly with Protein adsorption in the food industry.|$|R
40|$|The {{origin of}} the shapes of stones and other {{particles}} formed by water or wind has always {{attracted the attention of}} geologists and mathematicians. A classical model of abrasion due to W. J. Firey leads to a geometric partial differential equation representing the continuum limit of the process. This model predicts convergence to spheres from an arbitrary initial form; analogously, the two-dimensional version of the model predicts convergence to circles. The shapes of real stones are, however, not always round. Most notably, coastal pebbles tend to be smooth but somewhat flat, and ventifacts (e. g. pyramidal dreikanters) often have completely different shapes with sharp edges. Inspired by Firey’s results, a new PDE is derived in this paper, which not only appears to be a natural mathematical generalization of the PDE, but also represents the continuum limit of a generalised abrasion model based on recurrent loss of material due to collisions of nearby pebbles. Preliminary results suggest that our model is capable to predict a broad range of limit shapes: polygonal shapes with sharp edges develop due <b>to</b> <b>sand</b> <b>blasting</b> (big stone surrounded by infinitesimally small particles), round stones emerge due to collisions with relatively big stones, and flat shapes are the typical outcome in the intermediate case.

The acid etching process was performed in a dual bath of H 2 SO 4 1 n and HCl 1 n (1 : 1) at different elevated temperatures (60 °C, 80 °C, and 100 °C) using different process durations (1 h, 3 h, 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h). Passivation was done in 30 % HNO 3 at room temperature. On modified surfaces we evaluated topography, by measuring roughness, and analyzing scanning electron micrographs. Contact angle was measured using static method and direct measurement of the tangent angle at the three-phase contact point on a sessile drop proﬁle. We found that the influence of <b>sand</b> <b>blasting</b> prior <b>to</b> acid etching at low temperature (60 °C) on contact angle is beneficial when using long acid etching times (12 h and 24 h). Increasing the process time for acid etching leads to a decrease in contact angle which is a desired result.

40|$|Today {{cleaning}} {{with carbon}} dioxide pellets similar <b>to</b> <b>sand</b> <b>blasting</b> is an established technology. It {{is used for}} cleaning buildings outsides, rusty contamination or even to remove paint from airplanes. In any of these cases, the treated contamination is of a rough and macroscopic character. For the cleaning challenges of the Semiconductor Industry of the Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) with submicron particle contamination and thin film contamination this process {{is not at all}} suitable. On the other hand, established cleaning methods for the above mentioned problems, such as wet cleaning with water or chemicals, are often inconvenient, costly and are followed by the necessary disposal of cleaning media. At the Fraunhofer IPA, Stuttgart, Germany, experiments have been performed to develop an optimized cleaning system with carbon dioxide snow. High purity carbon dioxide is highly compressed and afterwards expands through a specially formed nozzle. Like this the carbon dioxide creat es a mix of snowflakes and gas. The effect of cleaning is a result of an almost gentle but very effective momentum transfer by the snowflakes on the contamination and the resulting shock wave which is induced by the sublimating carbon dioxide. The main advantages of this cleaning method can be described as follows: - cleaning of hybrid structures with a very high local resolution - minimal consumption of carbon dioxide - dry cleaning - no contaminated cleaning media (compared to wet cleaning with water or chemicals - disposal-free cleaning - cleaning of particle and filmic contamination - effective cleaning of submicron contamination at a high performance.

Study protocol: Forty-eight conical implants were initially made of second-grade titanium alloy. The diameter of implants was 4 mm at the head and 2. 6 at the apex, all implants were of 8 mm length and of large variable thread design. Half of them were subjected <b>to</b> <b>sand</b> <b>blasting</b> and immersion in biomimetic fluid at 37 ⁰C for four weeks with daily replenishment of solution until the moment of placement; another 24 implants were left with untreated machined surface. Three-dimensional roughness values were obtained with the help of confocal laser scanning microscope. Forty-eight implants were implanted in 12 dogs. Twenty-four implants were retrieved after a 6 -week healing period following installation, and the remaining 24 were removed upon the completion of 16 weeks, using a torque calibrator ((BTG 150 CN-S TOHNICHI) with a 20 cN•m - 150 cN•m scale of force registration was applied for the measurements of the removal torque. Results: The mean 3 -dimensional roughness value of biomimetically treated implant surfaces was 1. 34 ± 0. 24 µm and the mean roughness value measured for the machined surfaces was 0. 33 ± 0. 04 µm (P< 0. 05). As to the average parameters of maximum peak-trough distance, these were equal to 2. 85 for machined and 24. 25 for incubated sandblasted implants. Machined implants demonstrated 49. 5 ± 10. 3 removal torque values after the 6 -week healing period. But for the immersed sandblasted implants the same parameter was equal to 72. 7 ± 15. 98 Ncm.

It deals with the effects of <b>sand</b> <b>blasting</b> duration (from 0 to 60 min) and impact angle (from 0 to 90 °) on the material and its properties. The principal erosion characteristics and properties of the material studied are the mass loss, the erosion rate, the surface roughness, the optical transmission and the mechanical strength. The influence of the optical transmission degradation on the relative efficiency of solar panels protected by eroded glass was also examined. The sand used has mostly a rounded shape and presents a grain size distribution between 300 and 500 µm and hardness greater than that of the glass tested. The evolution of the roughness and the optical transmission with variable duration present an important variation at the beginning and tends towards a constant level after about 20 minutes. The mass loss is function of the <b>sand</b> <b>blasting</b> duration and the impact angle. It is maximal for an impact angle of 90 °. Fracture strength (up to 300 min) indicates that there is an important drop in strength values (about 13 %) after 30 minutes with a significant dispersion. The strength values tend then to level out with a reduced dispersion after 60 minutes. Weibull distribution function was used to characterize statistically the variation of the mechanical strength by comparing samples in the as received state and eroded by <b>sand</b> <b>blasting</b> during 30 and 60 minutes. The as received glass Weibull plot shows a large dispersion expressed by a low Weibull modulus (m = 5. 41) and a relatively higher average strength value (smoy = 76 MPa).

The results reveal the highest compressive residual stress with up to - 5. 3 GPa for the 012 texture while the stresses for the 001 and 110 textures peaked at - 3. 1 and - 2. 0 GPa, respectively.

In creating a uniform surface finish on machined parts. It is additionally used in cleaning mineral specimens, most of which have a Mohs hardness of 7 or less and would thus be damaged by sand.|$|R
40|$|Surface {{finishing}} treatments such as {{shot blasting}} and wire brushing can be beneficial {{in improving the}} integrity of machined surfaces of austenitic stainless steels. These operations optimize in-service properties such as resistance to pitting corrosion and stress corrosion cracking (SCC). In this study, ground steel surfaces were subjected {{to a series of}} <b>sand</b> <b>blasting</b> and wire brushing treatments. The surfaces were then characterized by their hardness, surface residual stress state, and resistance to stress corrosion and pitting corrosion. Some samples were selected for depth profiling of residual stress. It is found that surface hardening and the generation of near-surface compressive residual stress are the benefits that can be introduced by <b>sand</b> <b>blasting</b> and brushing operations...|$|R
