500|$|When Lefty and Desdemona {{are forced}} to immigrate to the United States, they have {{different}} mindsets. Whereas Lefty embraces his new country's customs, Desdemona is adamant that she will follow her old country's ways. For example, she is angered that her [...] "immigrant hair" [...] is chopped off because {{she does not want}} to [...] "look like an Amerikanidha" [...] and decides to regrow her hair immediately. Lefty attempts to assimilate into American culture by zealously learning English. Lina, the cousin of Lefty and Desdemona, is the paragon of immigrant integration. Cal noted: [...] "In <b>the</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> <b>since</b> leaving Turkey, Sourmelina had managed to erase just about everything identifiably Greek about her." ...|$|E

500|$|The General Board, {{whose main}} {{concern was the}} {{integrated}} operation of the United States , pushed for the design to provide more scouting capabilities for fleet operations. But {{the high cost of}} the design—$1,900,000 for hull and machinery vs. $790,000 for the [...] ships—and the lack of operating experience with the —the first of the [...] "thousand tonners" [...] (destroyers exceeding [...] displacement) which were just beginning to be launched—caused C to resist the much larger design. The Chief Constructor of the Navy, the head of C, pointed out that the British had not repeated the Swift design in <b>the</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> <b>since</b> her introduction, and noted that [...] "a destroyer that gets too large loses many of the desirable features of the type".|$|E
500|$|The Cybus Industries logo, {{which had}} been used on the Cybermen since their {{redesign}} for the revived series in [...] "Rise of the Cybermen"/"The Age of Steel" [...] (2006), was covered up for the Cybermen in this episode {{as well as the}} ones which had previously appeared in [...] "A Good Man Goes to War". This is because the Cybermen from [...] "Rise of the Cybermen" [...] originated from a parallel universe, while the prime universe has its own Cybermen from the planet Mondas, as seen in the classic series. As the Cybermen that feature in [...] "Closing Time" [...] were barely surviving, the production team made them look broken down and {{as if they had been}} cannibalizing parts to survive. The suits were already worn to an extent, as they had been used so often in <b>the</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> <b>since</b> they were made. The Cyber Controller conversion equipment was built around Corden.|$|E
500|$|Musically, 21st Century Breakdown {{is similar}} to the punk rock style of American Idiot, but many critics have claimed that Green Day's {{traditional}} sound has evolved in <b>the</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> <b>since</b> their last release to incorporate new influences such as heavier, louder pop rock and stadium rock on an epic scale. Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone indicated that the album sports ballads that are Green Day's most polished; he claimed that the band [...] "combine punk thrash with their newfound love of classic-rock grandiosity". MTV compared the material to that of classic rockers like The Who, while Spin called the title track [...] "Green Day's most epic song yet". Cool has remarked: [...] "It's important to us that we're still looked at as a punk band. It was our religion, our higher education". However, he also noted that Armstrong had delved into the past in writing 21st Century Breakdown, gleaning inspiration from the artists who shaped rock music. Armstrong himself has stated: [...] "Ground zero for me is still punk rock. I like painting an ugly picture. I get something uplifting out of singing some of the most horrifying shit you can sing about. It's just my DNA." ...|$|E
50|$|Qantas bookings rose during Australia Week 2008 to record-breaking levels.

2500|$|Cosmogramma {{was awarded}} the top spot in Exclaim! magazine's annual ranking of {{electronic}} albums, with Exclaim!s Dimitri Nasrallah writing of Ellison: [...] "In <b>the</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> <b>since</b> he first appeared on the scene, the Los Angeles native's talents have grown in such leaps and bounds that he now finds himself pioneering a full-blown West-Coast beats renaissance." [...] It was later ranked the fourteenth best album of 2010 by Pitchfork, and named the best {{album of the year}} at British radio DJ Gilles Peterson's 2011 Worldwide Winners awards ceremony.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2016, {{former members}} of Thursday posted a picture of {{themselves}} hanging out to Rickly's Twitter account. This sparked rumors that the band would soon be reuniting, however Rickly quickly dispelled these rumors saying that their communication was minimal in <b>the</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> <b>since</b> disbanding and they were [...] "just finally mending some fences and healing some old wounds." [...] Thursday's former booking agent began encouraging them to reunite the band with the freedom {{to do whatever they}} wanted and without the pressure of having to write a new album.|$|E
2500|$|Then on 10 July 2005, JAXA {{was finally}} able to launch a new X-ray {{astronomy}} mission named Suzaku (ASTRO-EII). This launch was important for JAXA, because in <b>the</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> <b>since</b> the launch failure of the original ASTRO-E satellite, Japan was without an x-ray telescope. [...] Three instruments were included in this satellite: an X-ray spectrometer (XRS), an X-ray imaging spectrometer (XIS), and a hard X-ray detector (HXD). However, the XRS was rendered inoperable due to a malfunction which caused the satellite to lose its supply of liquid helium.|$|E

2500|$|Following the decision, many of {{the plaintiffs}} {{expressed}} an intent to find other means by which they could continue contesting the seizure of their homes. [...] Soon after the decision, city officials announced plans to charge {{the residents of the}} homes for back rent for <b>the</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> <b>since</b> condemnation procedures began. [...] The city contended that the residents have been on city property for those five years and owe {{tens of thousands of dollars}} of rent. [...] In June 2006, Governor M. Jodi Rell intervened with New London city officials, proposing the homeowners involved in the suit be deeded property in the Fort Trumbull neighborhood so they may retain their homes. A group of New London residents formed a local political party, One New London, to combat the takings.|$|E
2500|$|After Wickham's joining and {{the move}} to Ireland, the band went three years before {{releasing}} another album. [...] Fisherman's Blues, and more particularly Room to Roam, traded [...] "The Big Music"'s keyboards and brass for traditional instruments such as tin whistle, flute, fiddle, accordion, harmonica, and bouzouki. Celtic folk music replaced rock as the main inspiration for song arrangements on both albums. [...] Rolling Stone describes the sound as [...] "an impressive mixture of rock music and Celtic ruralism..., Beatles and Donovan echoes and, of course, lots of grand guitar, fiddle, mandolin, whistle, flute and accordion playing". Traditional folk songs were recorded along with those written by Scott. [...] "The Raggle Taggle Gypsy", a British folk ballad at least two hundred years old, was recorded on Room to Roam. It became {{closely associated with the}} band, much as the song [...] "The Big Music" [...] did, and also gave its name to describe the band's character. The recording emphasises how distinctly different the band's music had become in <b>the</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> <b>since</b> the last of [...] "The Big Music" [...] albums.|$|E
