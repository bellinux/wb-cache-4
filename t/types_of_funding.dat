40|$|Background: Childbirth {{assistance}} in highly technological settings and existing {{variability in the}} interventions performed are cause for concern. In recent years, numerous recommendations have been made concerning {{the importance of the}} physiological process during birth. In Spain and Catalonia, work has been carried out to implement evidence-based practices for childbirth and to reduce unnecessary interventions. To identify obstetric intervention rates among all births, determine whether there are differences in interventions among full-term single births taking place in different hospitals according to <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>funding</b> and volume <b>of</b> births attended to, and to ascertain whether there is an association between caesarean section or instrumental birth rates and <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>funding,</b> the volume <b>of</b> births attended to and women’s age. Methods: Cross-sectional study, taking the hospital as the unit of analysis, obstetric interventions as dependent variables, and <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>funding,</b> volume <b>of</b> births attended to and maternal age as explanatory variables. The analysis was performed in three phases considering all births reported in the MBDS Catalonia 2011 (7, 8570 births), full-term single births and births coded as normal. Results: The overall caesarean section rate in Catalonia is 27. 55 % (CI 27. 23 to 27. 86). There is a significant difference in caesarean section rates between public and private hospitals in all strata. Both public and private hospitals with a lower volume of births have higher obstetric intervention rates than other hospitals (49. 43 %, CI 48. 04 to 50. 81). Conclusions: In hospitals in Catalonia, both the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>funding</b> and volume <b>of</b> births attended to {{have a significant effect on}} the incidence of caesarean section, and <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>funding</b> is associated with the use of instruments during delivery...|$|R

40|$|Partnership {{between the}} public and private sectors has been studied using {{different}} methodologies; among them, scientific articles offer an objective way to quantify and assess some of these public-private interactions. The present paper takes advantage of the funding acknowledgements (FA) section included in WoS articles written in English and studies some features of the funded research, such as impact and collaboration. For this purpose, articles with Spain in the address field are selected and retrieved (years 2008 - 2013), dividing them in two sets: articles with or without FA. Besides, given the large volume of items, the study is focused on groups of articles of each area selected by stratified random sampling. Additionally, those items with a FA section are analysed to identify three <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>funding</b> sources: only public, only private, or both sectors. The results show differences between areas in terms of presence of FA and <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>funding</b> sectors. On the one hand, in general, articles funded by both {{the public and private sectors}} present the best impact, as well as the highest number of authors and organisations. On the other hand, there are important variations in impact and collaboration between areas depending on <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>funding</b> sectors. Thus, items funded by both the public and private sectors show the highest significant impact in Clinical Medicine, Life Sciences and Physics, having also greater international collaboration, in most areas, than articles funded only by the public sector. Finally, some limitations of this study are identified and some recommendations for funders and authors are offered.

40|$|More {{than ten}} {{years have passed since}} the European Commission adopted Directive 94 / 19 /EC on deposit-guarantee schemes. The Directive laid the {{foundations}} for general harmonisation of deposit insurance across the European Union Member States, requiring them to legally set up deposit-guarantee schemes by a specified deadline. Based on minimum harmonisation, the Directive left it to Member States to develop their own deposit insurance systems in terms of e. g. definition of eligible deposits, level of cover, <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>funding</b> mechanism, and calculation of members’ contributions. This autonomy has resulted in quite divergent evolution of deposit-guarantee schemes and gives rise to a series of possible problems, which were the subject of the European Commission’s review of the Directive in 2006. This paper overviews the current state of deposit insurance across the European Union, highlights the main controversial issues which cause disparities in the implementation of deposit insurance between Member States (e. g. the definition of eligible deposits, the level of cover applied, the implementation of topping-up arrangements, the <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>funding</b> mechanism), and discusses {{the pros and cons of}} further harmonisation.

The preliminary results, based on 16 case studies with Belgian university spin-offs, seem {{to confirm that}} successful application for government subsidies {{for the development of a}} technology, product or business increases the likelihood of venture survival.
