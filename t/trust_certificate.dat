40|$|Abstract—The {{certificate}} authority model for authenticating public keys of websites has been attacked in recent years, and several proposals {{have been made}} to reinforce it. We develop and extend certificate transparency, a proposal in this direction, so that it efficiently handles certificate revocation. We show how this extension can be used to build a secure end-to-end email or messaging system using PKI with no requirement to <b>trust</b> <b>certificate</b> authorities, or to rely on complex peer-to-peer key-signing arrangements such as PGP. This makes end-to-end encrypted mail possible, with apparently few additional usability issues compared to unencrypted mail (specifically, users do not need to understand or concern themselves with keys or certificates). Underlying these ideas is a new attacker model appropriate for cloud computing, which we call “malicious-but-cautious”. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{penetration}} of PKI {{technology in the}} market is moving slowly due to interoperability concerns. Main causes are not technical but political and social {{since there is no}} trust development model that appropriately deals with multidomain PKIs. We propose a new architecture that on one hand considers that trust is not an homogeneous property but tied to a particular relation, and on the other hand, trust management must be performed through specialized entities that can evaluate its risks and threads. The model is based on <b>trust</b> <b>certificate</b> lists that allows users to hold a personalized trust view without having to get involved in technical details. The model dynamically adapts to the context changes thanks to a new certificate extension, we have called TrustProviderLink (TPL) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Our {{previous}} works have proposed {{the deployment of}} mobile agents to assist vertical handover decisions in 4 G. Adding a mobile agent in the 4 G could lead to many advantages such as reduced consumption of network bandwidth, delay in network latency and reduction in the time taken to complete a particular task. However, this deployment demands that the deployed collection of agents shall be secure and trustworthy. Security of a mobile agent includes maintaining confidentiality, reality and integrity of not only the agent employed but also the system {{in which it is}} deployed. In fact, many conventional security solutions exists, however, very few of them addresses the challenge of introducing trusted computing in mobile agents, deployed in 4 G, in particular. This paper proposes a new reliability model by implementing <b>trust</b> <b>certificate</b> for mobile agents in vertical handover...|$|E

40|$|Ad Hoc {{network is}} a multi-hop {{wireless}} network, consist of the self-organizing wireless mobile nodes and without fixed infrastructure, but its openness brings “stranger access ” problem. Trust management strategy based on trust evaluation can solve such problems. By entrusting <b>trust</b> <b>certificate</b> with trust value, {{access control policy}} can be passed to "strangers", and make them able to access the nodes in Ad Hoc network. In order to achieve the trust management based on trust evaluation, this paper proposes policy language for trust management in Ad hoc network. ATPL is defined based on constraint Datalog, realizes the three trust delegation chain of TEAMA by entrusting authorization rules, and completes the calculation of certificate execution and delegation trust value at the same time. This paper defines the syntax of ATPL, discusses the safety of ATPL rules, and proposes the basic safety convention of ATPL and safety statute. By the discussion of ATPL explanatory semantics, this paper solves the legacy security issue, and proves that ATPL rule is safe under various security constraints defined herein...|$|E
40|$|A mobile ad hoc {{network is}} a {{temporary}} network based on movable nodes within a specific range. Due to this motion the information related to nodes is continually changes likewise the addition of new node and its deletion from network is required. Due to this the authenticity of node must be justify to participate in data transmission. In the absence of this verification process some of the unidentified nodes may does malicious act. This type of activity is done by node known as blackhole/grayhole attack. A black hole node is a malicious node which sends the fake reply for route requests and drops the packets. In this work, a novel approach is proposed to detect blackhole nodes for AODV protocol of MANET. Our solutions find out the safe route between sending node and receiving node through some routing decision which is calculated through proposed <b>Trust</b> <b>Certificate</b> Sequence Exchange (TCSE) mechanism. In this mechanism the trust of each node in a network is calculated {{on the basis of}} behavior analysis of nodes & issues a certificate. The trust value is measure as a parameter of reliability & analyses delivery ratio, overhead & delays. This value is stored in a specific certificate & regularly shared with every neighbor. The work also introduces a control node named as watcher node which will monitors the behavior & trust of every other node within its neighbours. Initial results shows that the mechanism proposed will provide an effective solution to the mentioned problem of cooperative blackhole detection & prevention...|$|E
40|$|Trust plays a {{vital role}} in the {{decision}} to initiate any interaction. Rational agents may use past experiences and other agents’ opinions to decide to trust, but {{due to the nature of}} open multi-agent systems, where agents can dynamically join and leave the system at any time, agents may find themselves dealing with complete strangers whom neither they nor their friends have encountered before. This situation forces the agents to choose partners randomly, which significantly increases the risk of encountering unreliable agents. For instance, service requesters may become reluctant to initiate communication with newly-joined service providers. And when the newcomers are service requesters, who are willing to exploit the environment, service providers may also hesitate to start any connection with them. As a result, newcomers are excluded from the competition and old agents lose the possibility of interacting with better agents. In this thesis, we address that issue by creating a <b>Trust</b> <b>Certificate</b> (TC) model in which each agent is equipped with a certificate that works as a reference by providing information about its holder. The information is obtained and stored by the agent itself and is available to other agents who request it to evaluate the holder’s trustworthiness for a potential interaction. The stored information is about the agent’s role in the society and its performance in past interactions. The TC model allows agents to retrieve reputation information and make initial trust evaluations when evidence is unavailable. It also helps agents to avoid the need to make random partner selection due to the information scarcity. We show how this model enhances the interaction process between agents by evaluating it in the context of a simulated multi-agent system...|$|E
