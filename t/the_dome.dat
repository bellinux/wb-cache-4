5|$|An {{important}} feature of Western Chalukya roof art {{is the use of}} domical ceilings (not {{to be confused with the}} European types that are built of voussoirs with radiating joints) and square ceilings. Both types of ceilings originate from the square formed in the ceiling by the four beams that rest on four pillars. <b>The</b> <b>dome</b> above the four central pillars is normally the most attractive. <b>The</b> <b>dome</b> is constructed of ring upon ring of stones, each horizontally bedded ring smaller than the one below. The top is closed by a single stone slab. The rings are not cemented but held in place by the immense weight of the roofing material above them pressing down on the haunches of <b>the</b> <b>dome.</b> The triangular spaces created when <b>the</b> <b>dome</b> springs from the centre of the square are filled with arabesques. In the case of square ceilings, the ceiling is divided into compartments with images of lotus rosettes or other images from Hindu mythology.|$|E

5|$|Marge and {{the kids}} wake up to find {{themselves}} back in Springfield, now in ruins (except Springfield Elementary School, much to Bart's chagrin). They find Moe Szyslak, who {{is dressed in a}} bathrobe, a traffic cone and bullets and has become self-proclaimed Emperor of Springfield (although his leadership was unsuccessfully challenged by Barney). Just then, Russ Cargill reappears on the giant screen, and announces to the people of Springfield that placing <b>the</b> <b>dome</b> over Springfield was a mistake, and the government has commenced Operation: Soaring Eagle, an ill-named plan which involves killing them all. A helicopter lowers a small but powerful bomb down a rope through a hole in <b>the</b> <b>dome.</b> While Homer climbs to the top of <b>the</b> <b>dome,</b> the townspeople attempt to climb the rope to escape through the still-opened hole, but Homer slides down the rope and knocks them off along with the bomb. After reconciling with Bart, Homer drives a motorcycle along <b>the</b> <b>dome,</b> inspired by the earlier carnival attraction. As a passenger of the motorcycle, Bart throws the bomb through the hole; seconds later it detonates, shattering <b>the</b> <b>dome</b> and freeing the town. Cargill arrives personally and prepares to shoot Homer with a shotgun, but Maggie knocks him unconscious with a boulder. The town finally praises and forgives Homer, who rides into the sun rise with Marge and Maggie, whereupon the townspeople restore Springfield to normal. As a symbol of their gratitude, the Simpsons and their friends begin to rebuild the family's house.|$|E

25|$|Mitchell Park Horticultural Conservatory (Mitchell Park <b>Domes</b> or, simply, <b>the</b> <b>Domes)</b> is a {{conservatory}} at Mitchell Park. It {{is owned}} and operated by the Milwaukee County Park System, and replaced the original Milwaukee Conservatory which stood from 1898 to 1955. <b>The</b> three <b>domes</b> display a large variety of plant and bird life. The conservatory includes <b>the</b> Tropical <b>Dome,</b> <b>the</b> Arid <b>Dome</b> and <b>the</b> Show <b>Dome,</b> which hosts four seasonal (cultural, literary, or historic) shows and one Christmas exhibit held annually in December for visitors to enjoy.|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>domes,</b> like <b>the</b> <b>domes</b> of St. Mark's Basilica, {{were raised}} in height externally, giving a Byzantine {{appearance}} to the building, while the multitude of small belfries which accompany <b>the</b> <b>domes</b> recall Turkish minarets. Externally, at the main roof line each section of the building {{is marked by a}} low gable decorated with blind arcading in brick. These gables combine with <b>the</b> <b>domes,</b> <b>the</b> broad buttresses and the little towers to create a massive sculptural form, both diverse and unified in its conglomeration of features. As a work of architecture the building is particularly effective when viewed from the north west,{cn|date=May 2017}} an extra dimension [...] being added to the facade by the huge plinth and dynamic equestrian monument of the Condottiero Gattamelata by Donatello.|$|R

50|$|The zoo {{first opened}} with two domes (Africa and Asia); the third being built later. In total there are {{approximately}} 275 animal species in Randers Tropical Zoo; about 200 in <b>the</b> <b>domes</b> and 75 in the saltwater aquarium. <b>The</b> South American <b>dome</b> is 2000 m2 and is home to species such as South American tapir, West Indian manatee, callitrichid monkeys and macaws, <b>the</b> African <b>dome</b> is 500 m2 and is home to species such as lemurs, and <b>the</b> Asian <b>dome</b> is 700 m2 and is home of species such as pileated gibbon and Komodo dragon. In 2015, an exhibit for jaguars opened, {{which is the first}} located outside <b>the</b> <b>domes.</b> Adjacent to <b>the</b> <b>domes</b> is Danmarksparken ("Denmark Park") with farm animals and playgrounds.|$|R

5|$|Alternative {{theories}} are that La Reforma is a dome which was eroded {{to form a}} circular pattern or a set of tectonic blocks. Although <b>the</b> <b>dome</b> {{was thought to be}} formed by the older Comondú volcanics, {{it appears to be a}} product of La Reforma activity.|$|E
5|$|Assisted by {{the school}} janitor Mister One, and pursued by a {{grotesque}} scarecrow-like being named Labor 9 who suddenly appears on the school grounds, Ryouta and Sakuya begin investigating <b>the</b> <b>dome</b> and the murder. They visit the lab and compare alibis; Shuu, who Ryouta distrusts, asks if Ryouta has forgotten anything important, to which he replies that he hasn't. Upon investigating the headmaster's office, they discover the headmaster had likewise been poisoned to death, what they saw earlier being merely pre-recorded footage; they also find a computer {{and a pair of}} documents, one titled The Human Representative and a torn, unreadable one titled Operation Hatoful. The Human Representative reveals that if the protagonist, a symbol of humanity, were to die, the campus would be sealed off and the birds inside handed over to humans as sacrifices—something confirmed when the computer is used to open a small hatch in <b>the</b> <b>dome</b> and students are shot dead as they attempt to flee—when <b>the</b> <b>dome</b> is lifted twelve hours after her death is reported.|$|E
5|$|Attached to <b>the</b> <b>dome</b> is a three-storey {{rectangular}} building {{which houses}} the telescope control room, computer room, kitchen etc. Almost no human presence is required inside <b>the</b> <b>dome,</b> {{which means the}} environmental conditions can be kept very stable. As a result, the WHT obtains perfect dome seeing. This building also houses a detector laboratory and a realuminising plant. Because the WHT has the largest single mirror at the Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos, its realuminising plant has a vacuum vessel {{large enough to accommodate}} the mirrors from any other telescope on the mountain. As a result, all of the other telescopes at the observatory contract to use the WHT plant for their realuminising (with the exception of the Gran Telescopio Canarias, which has its own plant).|$|E

50|$|The most {{recognizable}} {{features of the}} Memorial Center are its two <b>domes,</b> <b>the</b> larger Deai <b>Dome</b> (で愛ドーム Deai Dōmu) and <b>the</b> smaller Fureai <b>Dome</b> (ふれ愛ドーム Fureai Dōmu). Though <b>the</b> Deai <b>Dome's</b> capacity (4,500 people) is much larger than <b>the</b> Fureai <b>Dome's</b> (600 people), both facilities are able to accommodate international and nationwide sports competitions and events. They can play host to basketball, volleyball, table tennis, indoor tennis, gymnastics, {{in addition to other}} indoor sports. <b>The</b> <b>domes</b> can also be used for meetings, ceremonies and exhibitions.|$|R

5|$|Funds were {{provided}} {{for the purchase of}} a 6-inch (150mm) refracting telescope from T. Cooke & Sons. <b>The</b> <b>dome</b> was originally designed to mount a small transit, and the lengthy telescope, over 2 metres long, had a limited field of view though the dome's opening. A large stone pillar was constructed inside the tower, raising the telescope to bring it closer to <b>the</b> <b>dome</b> and improve its field of view. Unfortunately, the new telescope was unable {{to take part in the}} transit measurements due to bad weather, and missed the 1895 Transit of Mercury for the same reason.|$|E
5|$|Inscribed on {{the front}} of <b>the</b> <b>dome,</b> above the main entrance, are two poetic lines, written by Welsh poet Gwyneth Lewis in the Welsh and English languages. The {{lettering}} is formed by windows in the upstairs bar areas and is internally illuminated at night.|$|E
50|$|According to {{the first}} plans for the church, <b>the</b> four <b>domes</b> were to be placed diagonally {{according}} to <b>the</b> main <b>dome,</b> which was however changed as they were placed frontally forming a square around <b>the</b> main <b>dome.</b> <b>The</b> octagon which was originally broad, was made thinner, higher, and placed on a square form.

5|$|Quatermass is {{narrowly}} {{saved from}} discovery by the rioting construction workers, who storm {{the plant and}} along with him are besieged inside the gas distribution centre, where they pump oxygen into the completed pressure dome to poison the ammonids, however some of the workers succumb to propaganda from the plant controllers, who offer them {{the chance to see}} inside <b>the</b> <b>dome.</b> The guards kill them by blocking the pipe with their bodies. In anger, the remaining workers fire on <b>the</b> <b>dome</b> with a bazooka, igniting the hydrogen and subsequently destroying the entire plant, killing the ammonids and releasing ammonia gas into the surrounding area.|$|E
5|$|Roman domes {{were used}} in baths, villas, palaces, and tombs. Oculi were common features. They were customarily {{hemispherical}} in shape and partially or totally concealed on the exterior. In order to buttress the horizontal thrusts of a large hemispherical masonry dome, the supporting walls were built up beyond the base to at least the haunches of <b>the</b> <b>dome</b> and <b>the</b> <b>dome</b> was then also sometimes covered with a conical or polygonal roof. A variety of other shapes, including shallow saucer domes, segmental domes, and ribbed domes were also sometimes used. The audience halls of many imperial palaces were domed. Domes were also very common over polygonal garden pavilions. Construction and development of domes declined in the west with the decline {{and fall of the}} western portion of the empire.|$|E
5|$|The Allies {{first noticed}} {{construction}} activity at Wizernes in mid-August 1943 when the Germans began building railway track and the offloading stores {{into the old}} quarry. After Hitler authorised the decision to turn the depot into a missile launch site, construction was stepped up. Work on <b>the</b> <b>dome</b> began in November 1943 and tunnelling in the cliff face below began in December. At the start of January, Allied reconnaissance aircraft observed an elaborate system of camouflage on the hill top, installed to conceal <b>the</b> <b>dome.</b> The building works were greatly hindered by the constant air-raid warnings, which stopped work 229 times in May 1944 alone. In response to Hitler's desire to see the site completed the workforce was expanded substantially from 1,100 in April 1944 to nearly 1,400 by June. About 60% of the workers were Germans; skilled workers, such as miners from Westphalia, were recruited to excavate the tunnels and build <b>the</b> <b>dome.</b> The remainder were principally Frenchmen conscripted by the Service du travail obligatoire (STO), plus Soviet prisoners of war. The project was overseen by several large German construction companies, with Philipp Holzman A.G. of Frankfurt am Main and the Grossdeutsche Schachtbau and Tiefbohr GmbH serving as the chief contractors.|$|E

5|$|The Ayyubid {{period in}} Jerusalem {{following}} its conquest by Saladin {{was marked by}} a huge investment {{in the construction of}} houses, markets, public bathes, and pilgrim hostels.

Saladin ordered all the inner walls and pillars of <b>the</b> <b>Dome</b> of the Rock to be covered in marble and he initiated the renovation of the mosaics on the dome's drum. The mihrab of the al-Aqsa Mosque was repaired and in 1217, al-Mu'azzam Isa built the northern porch of the mosque with three gates. <b>The</b> <b>Dome</b> of the Ascension was also built and restoration work was done to the existing free-standing domes of the Temple Mount.|$|E
