25|$|The {{fact that}} half of DSPD {{patients}} are not depressed indicates that DSPD {{is not merely a}} symptom of depression. Sleep researcher Michael Terman has suggested that <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>follow</b> their internal circadian clocks may be less likely to suffer from depression than those trying to live on a different schedule.|$|E

25|$|<b>Those</b> <b>who</b> <b>follow</b> Voldemort {{consider}} the Dark Mark {{to be of}} great importance, and while some people are 'lucky' enough to have one, the privilege is restricted to those of 'pure' blood. It is stated that Fenrir Greyback (a vicious werewolf) is not allowed the Dark Mark, which is likely {{because he is a}} werewolf.|$|E
25|$|Universal grammar {{takes into}} account general formal {{structures}} and features that are common to all dialects and languages, and the template of which pre-exists {{in the mind of}} an infant child. This idea is based on the theory of generative grammar and the formal school of linguistics, whose proponents include Noam Chomsky and <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>follow</b> his theory and work.|$|E
25|$|The Mahayana sutras often {{claim to}} {{articulate}} the Buddha's deeper, more advanced doctrines, reserved for <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>follow</b> the bodhisattva path. That path is explained as being built upon the motivation to liberate all living beings from unhappiness. Hence the name Mahāyāna (lit., the Great Vehicle). The Theravada school does not treat the Mahayana Sutras as authoritative or authentic teachings of the Buddha.|$|E

25|$|Buddhist Bhotiyas engage a Lama {{to perform}} rites and celebrations. In Buddhism, correct thinking, ritual sacrifices, and self-denial {{will enable the}} soul {{to break the cycle}} of reincarnation and reach Nirvana (a state of eternal bliss) at death. Only <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>follow</b> the middle way and the noble eight-fold path can achieve that state. The Bhotiya are lamaistic Buddhists who follow the teachings of the Dalai Lama.|$|E
25|$|The {{first is}} the older, and remains in use by the Old Believers as well as <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>follow</b> the Ruthenian recension (among them the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church and the Ruthenian Catholic Church). The second, {{corresponding}} more closely to the Greek, appeared in 1656 under the liturgical reforms of Patriarch Nikon of Moscow, and is in use by the Russian Orthodox Church, the Serbian Orthodox Church, the Bulgarian Orthodox Church and the Ukrainian Orthodox Church).|$|E
25|$|Conservation is {{an ethic}} of {{resource}} use, allocation, and protection. Its primary focus is upon maintaining {{the health of the}} natural world, its fisheries, habitats, and biological diversity. Secondary focus is on material conservation, including non-renewable resources such as metals, minerals and fossil fuels, and energy conservation, which is important to protect the natural world. <b>Those</b> <b>who</b> <b>follow</b> the conservation ethic and, especially, those who advocate or work toward conservation goals are termed conservationists.|$|E

A king has the blind men of the capital brought to the palace, where an elephant is brought in and they are asked to describe it.|$|E
25|$|On July 4, 2011, Obama was {{the subject}} of a death hoax on Twitter when Fox News's Politics Twitter account (@foxnewspolitics) was hacked. The hackers were {{unfamiliar}} with Twitter and started their hoax messages with @BarackObama, thus only making the message appear in the Twitter timelines of <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>follow</b> both Fox News and the Presidential account. Eventually the hackers switched to hashtag references, increasing the visibility of their activities. Fox News acknowledged the breach and apologized.|$|E
25|$|In {{the words}} of soprano Montserrat Caballé:She opened a new door for us, for all the singers in the world, a door that had been closed. Behind it was {{sleeping}} not only great music but great idea of interpretation. She has given us the chance, <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>follow</b> her, {{to do things that}} were hardly possible before her. That I am compared with Callas is something I never dared to dream.

25|$|He {{was a man}} {{of strong}} character, athletic, brave, resolute, cool and {{resourceful}} in emergency; a man of rare ability and natural aptitude for war, and possessed, moreover, of that magnetic influence which communicates the highest confidence and devotion to <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>follow.</b> Lumsden upheld the principle that the greatest and best school for war is war itself. He believed in the elasticity which begets individual self-confidence, and preferred a body of men taught to act and fight with personal intelligence.|$|E
25|$|According to Allameh Muzaffar, Allah gives humans {{the faculty}} of reason and argument. Also, Allah orders humans to spend time {{thinking}} carefully on creation while he refers to all creations as his signs of power and glory. These signs encompass all of the universe. Furthermore, there is a similarity between humans as the little world and the universe as the large world. Allah does not accept the faith of <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>follow</b> him without thinking and only with imitation, but also Allah blames them for such actions.|$|E
25|$|There is {{yet another}} points table for State/Provincial wide events for the State/Provincial Championship. However, instead of wide gap points between winners and <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>follow</b> and between skill levels, they are quite close i.e. for first place in Expert, Intermediate and Novice it is 20, 19, and 18 respectively. Also, {{it is only a}} one-point {{difference}} between places i.e. 20 points for first and 19 points for second place in Expert. The same for the Novice and Intermediate levels. Also unlike on the National and District level no participant points are awarded.|$|E

50|$|The {{extraordinary}} {{beauty and}} {{passion of the}} poetic choral descriptions indicate that the author certainly knew what attracted <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>followed</b> Dionysus.

50|$|According to Samaritan sources, a {{civil war}} broke out between the Sons of Ithamar and the Sons of Phinehas - which {{resulted}} in the division of <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>followed</b> Eli and <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>followed</b> High Priest Uzzi ben Bukki at Mount Gerizim Bethel (a third group followed neither). Likewise according to Samaritan sources, the high-priestly line of the sons of Phinehas died out in 1624 C.E. with the death of the 112th High Priest Shlomyah ben Pinhas, when the priesthood was transferred to the sons of Itamar; see article Samaritan for list of High Priests from 1613 to 2004-the 131st High priest of the Samaritans is Elazar ben Tsedaka ben Yitzhaq.|$|R
25|$|Then, for the {{ultimate}} truth, there are two schools of Madhyamaka: those who assert {{the ultimate}} is the illusory nature, and those who make no assertions. To explain further, the first says that the illusory nature is established when the perceiver of an object experiences a perception of that object as being unreal. This view was put forth by Kamalashila, Shantarakshita, and other proponents of the Svatantrika Madhyamaka school. Their view is clearly explained in Mipham Jamyang Gyatso's commentary on Shantarakshita's 'Ornament of the Middle Way.' This commentary by Mipham Rinpoche is often considered the most important philosophical text of the Nyingma lineage in Tibet, particularly for <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>follow</b> Mipham Rinpoche's understanding of the Shentong Madhyamaka view.|$|E
25|$|As {{there had}} never been a single {{organizational}} body governing the teaching of the art, several variant styles and sub-styles developed. Although there are classical texts which include specific encoded instructions and general guidelines for practice, many of these are ignored by most modern practitioners, and interpreted in different ways by <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>follow</b> their instruction (this is depicted in the lineage chart further down this page). As a result, over the decades and especially over the last few dozen years, branches of the art have considerably differentiated and diverged. This trend was strengthened by cross influences various Xing Yi teachers had from other martial arts and martial artists, and the spread of Xing Yi to the Western World.|$|E
25|$|However, some Hindus {{believe that}} when the emanations of the Supreme Being are pratyaksha, or obvious to the sight, they become sacara, or embodied. Krishna was such an {{embodiment}} and usually bore a human form. In that mode of appearance the deities are generally supposed to be born of a woman, but without any carnal intercourse. This belief is not adhered to by <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>follow</b> the Purva Mimansa, or the philosophy of Jaimini. They insist that the Devas were mere mortals whom the Supreme Being endowed with qualities similar to his own. In general, the Hindus perform acts of worship to some of their ancient monarchs and sages, who were deified on account of their eminent virtues.|$|E
50|$|William's work spurred a {{development}} of logic in {{the thirteenth century}} under the general designation De Proprietibus Terminorum. <b>Those</b> <b>who</b> engaged in this part of logic were called the Moderni, or Terministae.
