Owing to the added value of motility and indole production in the differentiation of enteric pathogens, we prepared and evaluated a motility-indole-lysine (MIL) medium. The following 890 organisms were tested: 264 Shigella, 2 Edwardsiella, 182 Salmonella enteritidis, 235 S. typhi, 3 Arizona, 32 Yersinia enterocolitica, and 172 {{other members of the}} family Enterobacteriaceae. With few exceptions the MIL medium gave the same results as the standard motility, indole, and lysine decarboxylase (Moeller) test media. All discrepancies were with the indole reaction, which was weak in 2 of 67 strains of Escherichia coli and falsely negative in 6 of 32 strains of Y. enterocolitica. When both <b>TSI</b> <b>agar</b> and lysine-iron agar (LIA) slants are used in the evaluation isolates from fecal cultures, detection of H 2 S is duplicated. Both LIA and MIL medium detect lysine decarboxylase and deaminase activity equally well. Because of its ability to detect motility and indole production, the MIL medium is more useful than LIA when used with <b>TSI</b> <b>agar.</b> The combination of <b>TSI</b> <b>agar,</b> MIL <b>medium,</b> and urea <b>agar</b> enables reliable initial recognition of enteric pathogens of the Enterobacteriaceae...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: The {{evaluation}} of Mutans streptococci (MS) {{is one of}} the index for caries risk. Dentocult TM and CRT TM are commercial kits to detect and evaluate MS, conveniently. However, the {{evaluation of}} MS has also been carried out simply using an instruction manual. But the instruction manual is not easy to use for evaluation of MS. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the utility of modified Mitis-Salivalius Bacitracin (MSB) <b>agar</b> <b>medium</b> compared with MSB <b>agar</b> <b>medium</b> and commercial kits, and to establish a convenient kit (mMSB-kit) using modified MSB agar. Methods: The MS in stimulated saliva from 27 subjects were detected by MSB, modified MSB <b>agar</b> <b>medium</b> and commercial kits. Laboratory and clinically isolated strains of MS were similarly evaluated. The ratios of MS in detected bacteria were compared by ELISA. Results: The scores using an mMSB-kit on the basis of modified MSB <b>agar</b> <b>medium</b> were tabulated. Saliva samples showed different levels of MS between culture methods and the commercial kit. Some samples which were full of MS were not detected by the commercial kit. The detection of MS by modified MSB <b>agar</b> <b>medium</b> and mMSB-kit were significantly higher when compared with MSB <b>agar</b> <b>medium,</b> CRT TM, (P<. 01) and Dentocult SM TM (P<. 05).

As the poor hygiene and sanitation prevailing in the abattoirs as well as the butcher shops encourage microbial contaminations and growth. The higher microbial load in the butcher shops further enhances the chances of early meat spoilage (Sudhakar et al. 2007) Contamination of carcasses occurs during different stages of slaughtering processes. These hygienic levels are determined quantitatively by the number and kind of microbes on the surfaces of carcasses. A total of 200 swabs were used in this work.
