Currently there is a trend of eliminating the <b>truck</b> <b>mixing</b> mechanism of concrete production from major construction contracts in Saudi Arabia.

This paper presents an experimental study of strength and uniformity aspects of the concrete produced by the central and the <b>truck</b> <b>mixing</b> mechanisms {{in order to make a}} case for or against the latter. Results indicate that, with adequate control on mixing performance factors such as mixing time and drum speed, the two mechanisms comply with strength and uniformity requirements. However, in spite of adequate quality control at the 95 % confidence level, the average compressive strength from the truck mechanism is less than that from the central plant, while the variability of strength of the former tends to be more than that of the later. A procedure is presented for determination of the critical mean strength of a truck mix that matches with that of the central mix produced by a given plant.

40|$|Freight vehicle capacity, {{whether it}} be road, ocean or air transport, is highly underutilized. This under-utilization {{presents}} an opportunity for companies to reduce their vehicular traffic and reduce their carbon footprint through greater supply chain integration. This thesis describes the impact of ordering guidelines on the transport efficiency of a large firm and how those guidelines and associated practices can be changed {{in order to gain}} better efficiency. To that end, we present three recommendations on improving the guidelines based on the shipment data analysis. First, we discuss the redundancy of one of the company's fill metrics based on a scatter plot analysis and a chi-square independence test. Second, we explore the impact of using linear programming to allocate SKUs to different shipment, highlighting the {{reduction in the number of}} shipments through better <b>truck</b> <b>mixing.</b> Finally, we divide the SKUs into three groups: cube-constrained, neutral, and weight-constrained. Based on this segmentation, we present a basic model that mixes different SKUs and helps a shipment to achieve a much higher utilization rate. The application of the last two findings can be further explored to address under-utilization in freight carriers across different industries. by Jaya Banik and Kyle Rinehart. Thesis (M.

40|$|When {{animals are}} exposed to a novel {{situation}} such as transportation, they react by eliciting certain physiological and behavioural functions in order {{to cope with the}} situation. These changes can be measured to indicate how much stress the animal is suffering. Physiological stress indicators often measured in animal transport research include changes in heart rate, live-weight, cortisol levels, and blood composition including electrolytes, metabolites and enzymes (Broom and Johnson, 1993). Animal behavioural stress indicators include struggling, vocalisation, kicking or biting, hunching of the back, urination, defecation and recumbence (Broom et al. 1996; Gregory, 1998). Meat quality parameters post mortem can also help to indicate stress levels in animals (Grandin, 1990; Gregory, 1998). These include incidence of bruising and DFD in all farm animal species and PSE in pigs. Mortality is also an obvious indicator of poor welfare. Combined aspects of transport that contribute to causing stress in livestock include loading and unloading procedures, close proximity to stock handlers, water/feed deprivation, noise, riding in a <b>truck,</b> <b>mixing</b> with other animals and being forced into unfamiliar environments. The responses of stock to these conditions will depend on the animal's genetically controlled adaptability, physical condition and its previous handling experiences (Gross and Siegel, 1993). Factors such as the adequate preparation of animals for transport, controlled prior access to feed and water, minimal disruption to social groups, considerate animal handling skills, adequate handling and transport facilities including good ventilation in trucks, and careful driving technique are major areas that dictate the standard of animal transport. For example, considerations for pigs should include a pre-transport fasting period which balances the requirement to avoid hunger, travel sickness and deaths. Breeding and selecting for more stress-resistant genotypes of pigs can improve the welfare by reducing mortality and the metabolic consequences of transport stress. Other factors influencing animal transport include farm size and country size. For example, livestock transport in Scandinavia involves transport vehicles travelling to more than one farm in order to fill a vehicle. In Australia often one farm pick up can fill a truck, and although the distances may be much longer to the abattoir, it will be more direct. The market demand dictates the type of animals transported. For example the veal trade in Europe demands young live calves to be transported over long distances from northern countries which supply it to the southern countries which demand it. This trade exists in live animals rather than meat because the demanding countries further fatten and slaughter these animals specific to their needs. The industry set up influences the standard of animal transport in different countries. For example in countries where industries are vertically integrated consisting of producer-owned slaughter plant co-operatives (Sweden and Denmark), producers are paid according to slaughter weight and lean meat percentage, therefore there is more consistent quality control measures in place. In Australia the marketing system is such that it provides no economic incentive to reduce losses. Greater public awareness of animal welfare seems to be increasing in western countries, and as a result there is more pressure on the livestock industry to adopt better standards for the farming, handling, transport and slaughter of animals. The transport of livestock in Australia continues to be under increased scrutiny from overseas markets and animal welfare groups. In the European Union (EU), public pressure has been a successful instigator to the drafting and continued improvement of comprehensive legislation for animal transport. EU animal transport laws cover aspects such as minimum design standards for livestock vehicles (including ventilation controls), maximum journey lengths before resting intervals, stocking rates, what animals are considered as fit to travel, and general handling and care requirements of animals in transport. These laws are causing debate between northern and southern countries in areas such as maximum journey lengths and vehicle design standards. Some countries such as the UK have also gone to a great effort to adjust national laws in order to incorporate EU transport laws, but countries such as Spain and Italy have not. Typically it is these countries that more often have poor standards of animal welfare, and the welfare of farmed animals has historically been of low priority (Schmidt, 1995). When and how these countries will adopt the comprehensive EU animal transport regulations, continues to be an unanswered and politically sensitive question between EU member states...|$|E

This is a mobile miniaturized version of the large stationary batch plant. They are used to provide Ready Mix Concrete utilizing a continuous batching process or metered concrete system. The volumetric mobile mixer is a truck that holds sand, rock, cement, water, fiber, and some add mixtures and color {{depending on how the}} batch plant is outfitted. These <b>trucks</b> <b>mix</b> or batch the ready mix on the job site it's self. This type of <b>truck</b> can <b>mix</b> as much or as little amount of concrete as needed.

This is a hybrid approach between centralized batch plants and traditional on-site mixing. Each type of system has it's advantages and disadvantages, depending on the location, size of the job, and mix design set forth by the engineer.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to briefly {{emphasize}} the shale gas technology of extraction and because the important role of water within this process, the imperious need to preserve the water quality. If rigorous geological prospects indicate the presence of gas in shale, it is extracted using the hydraulic fracturing technology. The water delivered by tank <b>trucks</b> <b>mixed</b> with sand and additives is injected into a well, at near 1, 500 m, under high pressure, from a pumper truck, through a probe (lined with several layers of steel and cements for protecting the groundwater of the fluids that are pumped through the probe and also of the natural gas that is released and collected inside the well). For obtaining gas from shale, holes are horizontally made in stainless steel and cement casing of the probe up to shale, and gas is extracted from the fractures with steel pipes. The reflux water is conducted to depuration stations in order to be cleaned and reused (about 10 – 30 % is recycled). The residues (wastewater and solids) resulted from depuration process are stored in special facilities designed and built with aim of waste storage. Usually, such a well is productive for several decades. Complete exploitation of such facility needs about 10, 000 – 20, 000 m 3 water. By comparison with other types of fuels, the ratio water volume used/unit of energy, is the lowest for shale gas production.

40|$|In {{response}} {{to the need to}} improve asphalt pavement performance, the Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP) was initiated in 1987. Products from SHRP included performance-based specifications for asphalt binders and performance-based mix design tests and criteria for asphalt mixtures. The Superpave asphalt binder specification addresses performance of in-service pavements for given environmental and traffic conditions. During the 1985 paving season in Indiana, the original asphalt binder and HMA (<b>truck</b> <b>mix</b> samples) from a number of pavements were sampled and retained. Cores were also taken from these pavements after seven or eight years of service. Condition surveys were performed on these pavements, prior to coring. The study objectives were directed toward characterizing the original and extracted/recovered asphalt binders from the field samples using Superpave test methods and equipment. Taking this approach provided an early opportunity to examine a number of features of the Superpave system, including short (RTFO) and long-term (PAVE) aging. Results of this research documented the difference in stiffness between RTFO aged and asphalts extracted and recovered from loose mixtures; in addition to, the difference in stiffness between PAV aged and in-service aged asphalts, in Indiana. Additionally, asphalt stiffness was related to pavement performance. A poor relationship was found between the stiffness of RTFO aged asphalts and rutting. On the other hand, a good relationship was found between stiffness of in-service asphalts and cracking. Collected weather data from seven counties indicated agreement between calculated PG grades for these counties and recommended Superpave PG grade, based on the environmental conditions. Based on the results of this research, recommendations were made to further investigate the short-and long-term binder aging to better address variability of these procedures, to address storage conditions sometimes unavoidable for field samples, and to validate PG grades requirements for Indiana...|$|R
