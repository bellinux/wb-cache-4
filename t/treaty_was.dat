5|$|In November 2010, the Croatian Parliament {{decided to}} hold the EU {{accession}} referendum 30 days after the <b>treaty</b> <b>was</b> signed; since the <b>treaty</b> <b>was</b> signed on 9 December 2011, the referendum was consequently (originally) scheduled for 9 January 2012. In November 2010, the Croatian Government proposed to hold the EU accession referendum simultaneously with another referendum aimed at altering general referendum rules.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability to}} enforce the <b>treaty</b> <b>was</b> dubious.|$|E
5|$|A trade <b>treaty</b> <b>was</b> signed {{between the}} Commonwealth and Prussia, {{unfavorable}} to the Commonwealth. The Partition {{cut off the}} Commonwealth's access to the Baltic Sea, and the state {{had no choice but}} to accept the high tariffs imposed by Prussia.|$|E
50|$|Treaties {{sometimes}} include {{provisions for}} self-termination, {{meaning that the}} <b>treaty</b> <b>is</b> automatically terminated if certain defined conditions <b>are</b> met. Some <b>treaties</b> <b>are</b> intended by the parties to be only temporarily binding and are set to expire on a given date. Other treaties may self-terminate if the <b>treaty</b> <b>is</b> meant to exist only under certain conditions.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>treaties</b> <b>are</b> {{endlessly}} disputed for {{a number}} of reasons and have been subject to numerous court cases. One of the major controversies regarding the <b>treaties</b> <b>is</b> the actual terms of the <b>treaties</b> <b>were</b> left blank at the time of signing and a number of clauses and pages were instead inserted at a later date.|$|R
5000|$|The {{provisional}} {{application of a}} <b>treaty</b> <b>is</b> a specific situation where a treaty or {{a part of a}} <b>treaty</b> <b>is</b> applied provisionally pending its entry into force.|$|R
5|$|India, Israel, New Zealand, Tunisia, Turkey, and Vietnam {{are among}} the {{countries}} that {{expressed a desire to}} conclude trade agreements with the new Eurasian Economic Union after the <b>treaty</b> <b>was</b> signed.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, in 1875, the Treaty of the Metre passed {{responsibility}} for verification of the kilogram and metre against agreed prototypes from French to international control. In 1921, the <b>Treaty</b> <b>was</b> extended {{to include all}} physical quantities including electrical units originally defined in 1893.|$|E
5|$|The Olney–Pauncefote Treaty of 1897 was a {{proposed}} treaty between the United States and Britain in 1897 {{that would have}} required arbitration of major disputes. The <b>treaty</b> <b>was</b> rejected by the U.S. Senate and never went into effect.|$|E
5000|$|International {{treaties}} and conventions contain rules about what entities could sign, ratify or accede to them. Some <b>treaties</b> <b>are</b> restricted to {{states that are}} members of the UN or parties to the Statute of the International Court of Justice. In rare cases there is an explicit list of the entities that the <b>treaty</b> <b>is</b> restricted to. More commonly the aim of the founding signatories <b>is</b> that the <b>treaty</b> <b>is</b> not restricted to particular states only and so a wording like [...] "this <b>treaty</b> <b>is</b> open for signature to States willing to accept its provisions" [...] is used (the so-called [...] "All States formula").|$|R
5000|$|Point 3 {{is called}} the {{compatibility}} test and is difficult to determine. It is not always clear what the object and purpose of the <b>treaty</b> <b>is,</b> especially when <b>treaties</b> <b>are</b> long and complex.|$|R
50|$|A {{plurilateral}} <b>treaty</b> <b>is</b> {{a special}} type of multilateral treaty. A plurilateral <b>treaty</b> <b>is</b> a <b>treaty</b> between {{a limited number}} of states with a particular interest in the subject of the treaty. The primary difference between a plurilateral treaty and other multilateral <b>treaties</b> <b>is</b> that the availability of reservations is more limited under a plurilateral treaty. Due to the limited nature of a plurilateral treaty, the full cooperation of the parties to the <b>treaty</b> <b>is</b> required in order for the object of the <b>treaty</b> to <b>be</b> met. As a result, reservations to plurilateral <b>treaties</b> <b>are</b> not allowed without the consent of all other parties to the <b>treaty.</b> This principle <b>is</b> codified in international law by article 20(2) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties:When it appears from the limited number of the negotiating states and the object and purpose of a treaty that the application of the treaty in its entirety between all the parties is an essential condition of the consent of each one to be bound by the treaty, a reservation requires acceptance by all the parties.|$|R
5|$|The {{development}} project was negotiated {{as an international}} treaty {{between the two countries}} rather than a commercial agreement between companies and included a clause, originally asked for by the UK, imposing heavy penalties for cancellation. A draft <b>treaty</b> <b>was</b> signed on 29 November 1962.|$|E
5|$|The most {{significant}} {{point of the}} <b>treaty</b> <b>was</b> that Porfirio Díaz, and his vice president, Ramón Corral, resign and that de la Barra, acting as interim president organize free elections as soon as possible.|$|E
5|$|The {{territory}} {{which today}} makes up Lycoming County was purchased from the Iroquois in two treaties signed at Fort Stanwix in New York: the first <b>treaty</b> <b>was</b> in 1768, {{and the second}} <b>treaty</b> <b>was</b> in 1784. The county was formed on April 13, 1795 from part of Northumberland County. The county originally contained seven townships when formed: Lower Bald Eagle, Loyalsock, Lycoming, Muncy, Nippenose, Pine Creek, and Washington. Today Pine Creek is part of Clinton County and Lower Bald Eagle is part of both Centre and Clinton counties, but the rest are still in Lycoming County, although many other municipalities have been formed from these since.|$|E
50|$|Two <b>treaties</b> <b>were</b> {{negotiated}} simultaneously at Prairie du Chien in {{the summer}} of 1829, both signed by General John McNeil, Colonel Pierre Menard, and Caleb Atwater for the United States. Both <b>treaties</b> <b>were</b> proclaimed on January 2, 1830.|$|R
5000|$|Many of the Reconstruction <b>Treaties</b> <b>were</b> titled {{with the}} phrase [...] "Treaty of Washington." [...] These {{treaties}} replaced the <b>treaties</b> that <b>were</b> voided when the tribes signed treaties with the Confederacy. Some Indian tribes signed treaties at the Ft. Smith conference. The Five Civilized Tribes agreed to draft treaties, but final <b>treaties</b> <b>were</b> signed in Washington, D.C. during the year of 1866.|$|R
2500|$|Legally, and by Article 18, {{all of the}} clauses of the <b>Treaty</b> <b>were</b> of equally secret status. There were no 'public' vs. 'secret' clauses in the Treaty. All of the clauses the <b>Treaty</b> <b>are</b> {{set forth}} {{verbatim}} in this Article. [...] There are no others.|$|R
5|$|The <b>treaty</b> <b>was</b> finally {{signed on}} 29 March 1790, and {{ratified}} on 23 April. It was a defensive treaty, as each country promised {{to aid the}} other in case of being invaded.|$|E

50|$|The <b>treaty</b> <b>is</b> not yet {{in force}} because {{it has not yet}} been {{ratified}} by both countries. The full name of the <b>treaty</b> <b>is</b> Agreement on the Delimitation of the Maritime Border between the Gabonese Republic and the Democratic Republic of São Tomé and Príncipe.|$|R

25|$|First {{international}} copyright <b>treaties</b> <b>were</b> {{concluded in}} Spring 1861 with France and in July 1862 with Belgium. Both treaties provided for reciprocal copyright protection, but {{were limited to}} literature only; translation rights were not covered, and censorship was explicitly allowed.

5|$|Although no general {{arbitration}} <b>treaty</b> <b>was</b> entered into, Taft's administration settled several {{disputes with}} Great Britain by peaceful means, often involving arbitration. These included {{a settlement of}} the boundary between Maine and New Brunswick, a long-running dispute over seal hunting in the Bering Sea that also involved Japan, and a similar disagreement regarding fishing off Newfoundland. The sealing convention remained in force until abrogated by Japan in 1940.|$|E
5|$|Another {{treaty that}} fared badly was the Johnson-Clarendon convention, {{negotiated}} in {{settlement of the}} Alabama Claims, for damages to American shipping from British-built Confederate raiders. Negotiated by the United States Minister to Britain, former Maryland senator Reverdy Johnson, in late 1868, it was ignored by the Senate during {{the remainder of the}} President's term. The <b>treaty</b> <b>was</b> rejected after he left office, and the Grant administration later negotiated considerably better terms from Britain.|$|E
5|$|Capturing the 16-gun French {{privateer}} La Jeune Creole on 1 January 1801 after a chase lasting 50hours, {{she returned}} to Norfolk with her prize on 15January. Chesapeake returned briefly to the West Indies in February, soon after a peace <b>treaty</b> <b>was</b> ratified with France. She returned to Norfolk and decommissioned on 26 February, subsequently being placed in reserve.|$|E
50|$|A <b>treaty</b> <b>is</b> an official, express written {{agreement}} that states use to legally bind themselves. A <b>treaty</b> <b>is</b> the official document which expresses that agreement in words; {{and it is}} also the objective outcome of a ceremonial occasion which acknowledges the parties and their defined relationships.|$|R

5|$|Florida {{returned}} to normal peacetime duties in 1919. She was heavily modernized in 1924–1926, including a complete overhaul of her propulsion system. She remained in service until 1930, when the London Naval <b>Treaty</b> <b>was</b> signed. Under {{the terms of the}} treaty, Florida and Utah were removed from active service. Therefore, Florida was decommissioned in 1931 and scrapped the next year in Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|Following a Viking raid in 994, a peace <b>treaty</b> <b>was</b> {{agreed with}} one of the raiders, Olaf Tryggvason. Besides {{receiving}} danegeld, Olaf converted to Christianity and undertook never to raid or fight the English again. Ælfheah may have played a part in the treaty negotiations, and it is certain that he confirmed Olaf in his new faith.|$|E
5|$|He helped broker the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, an {{international}} treaty designed to curb greenhouse gas emissions. The <b>treaty</b> <b>was</b> not ratified in the United States after a 95 to 0 {{vote in the}} Senate. The primary objections stemmed from the exemptions the treaty gave to China and India, whose industrial base and carbon footprint have grown rapidly, and fears that the exemptions would lead to further trade imbalances and offshoring arrangement with those countries.|$|E
