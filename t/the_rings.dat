5|$|Evidence that <b>the</b> <b>rings</b> {{might have}} gaps first arose during a stellar {{occultation}} in 1984 when <b>the</b> <b>rings</b> obscured {{a star on}} immersion but not on emersion. Images from Voyager 2 in 1989 settled the issue by showing several faint rings.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>rings</b> of Neptune, {{like those}} of Uranus, {{are thought to be}} {{relatively}} young; their age is probably significantly less than that of the Solar System. Also, {{like those of}} Uranus, Neptune's rings probably resulted from the collisional fragmentation of onetime inner moons. Such events create moonlet belts, which act as the sources of dust for <b>the</b> <b>rings.</b> In this respect <b>the</b> <b>rings</b> of Neptune are similar to faint dusty bands observed by Voyager 2 between the main rings of Uranus.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>ring</b> current creates its own {{magnetic}} field. Outside <b>the</b> <b>ring,</b> {{this field}} {{is in the}} same direction as the externally applied magnetic field; inside <b>the</b> <b>ring,</b> <b>the</b> field counteracts the externally applied field. As a result, the net magnetic field outside <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> is greater than the externally applied field alone, and is less inside <b>the</b> <b>ring.</b>|$|R
50|$|As a graded Hopf algebra, {{the dual}} of <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> of quasisymmetric {{functions}} is <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> of noncommutative symmetric functions.

50|$|Due to a {{rotating}} hole's rotational frame-dragging effects, spacetime {{in the vicinity}} of <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> will undergo curvature in the direction of <b>the</b> <b>ring's</b> motion. Effectively this means that different observers placed around a Kerr black hole who are asked to point to the hole's apparent center of gravity may point to different points on <b>the</b> <b>ring.</b> Falling objects will begin to acquire angular momentum from <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> before they actually strike it, and the path taken by a perpendicular light ray (initially traveling toward <b>the</b> <b>ring's</b> center) will curve in <b>the</b> direction of <b>ring</b> motion before intersecting with <b>the</b> <b>ring.</b>|$|R
5|$|There are {{two main}} {{hypotheses}} regarding the origin of <b>the</b> <b>rings.</b> One hypothesis is that <b>the</b> <b>rings</b> are remnants of a destroyed moon of Saturn.

Some ice in the E ring comes from the moon Enceladus's geysers.|$|E
5|$|Between {{the events}} of the first game and Halo 2, the Chief and a few other {{survivors}} return to Earth, warning of an impending Covenant attack; this attack forms the first mission of the game. Meanwhile, the Covenant, unaware of the destructive nature of <b>the</b> <b>rings,</b> attempt to fire another ring, Installation 05, to fulfill their religious prophecy and to do so launch an attack on Earth. Helping the Chief to defend the Earth are Sergeant Avery Johnson and Commander Miranda Keyes. One race in the Covenant, the Elites, learn the truth about <b>the</b> <b>rings</b> and are led by a former Elite commander named the Arbiter (also a player character) to join forces with humanity to stop the firing of the ring. Though they are successful, the unexpected shutdown of the installation triggers a fail-safe protocol, priming all <b>the</b> <b>rings</b> for firing from the Ark.|$|E

5000|$|In Handly Cup Style Lawn Darts, {{scores are}} based on darts in <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> plus darts closer to <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> {{than any of the}} {{opposing}} team's darts. Darts landing inside <b>the</b> <b>ring,</b> or [...] "ringers", are worth 3 points each, and can be cancelled by an opponent also throwing a dart into <b>the</b> <b>ring.</b> Additionally, any dart that is closer to <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> (but outside) than any other dart by the opposing team is worth one point. This means that if neither team managed to place a dart into <b>the</b> <b>ring,</b> but Team A had two darts closer than any of Team B's darts, Team A would score 2 points. If Team A had one dart in <b>the</b> <b>ring,</b> and one dart closer than any of Team B's darts, they would score 4 points. If both teams have darts in <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> it is impossible for a dart outside <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> to score any points (as it is farther from <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> than <b>the</b> opposing team's dart that is inside). If Team A and Team B each had a dart inside <b>the</b> <b>ring,</b> and Team A also had a dart outside <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> but closer to <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> than Team B's other dart, neither team would score any points for that round. Handly Cup Style matches typically are played in teams of two, with the pairs alternating, until one team's total score is 21 or more. In addition, for a point to count the dart must stick into the ground.|$|R

5|$|Prior to the 2004 {{arrival of}} the Cassini–Huygens spacecraft, <b>the</b> <b>rings</b> of Saturn were widely thought to be much younger than the Solar System and were not {{expected}} to survive beyond another 300million years. Gravitational interactions with Saturn's moons were expected to gradually sweep the rings' outer edge toward the planet, with abrasion by meteorites and Saturn's gravity eventually taking the rest, leaving Saturn unadorned. However, data from the Cassini mission led scientists to revise that early view. Observations revealed 10km-wide icy clumps of material that repeatedly break apart and reform, keeping <b>the</b> <b>rings</b> fresh. Saturn's rings are far more massive than <b>the</b> <b>rings</b> of the other giant planets. This large mass {{is thought to have}} preserved Saturn's rings since it first formed 4.5billion years ago, and is likely to preserve them for billions of years to come.|$|E

5000|$|If {{a wrestler}} executes {{a move on}} another wrestler too close to <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> ropes, they may end up {{knocking}} their opponent, or themselves, out of <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> entirely.

The wrestler who has been knocked out has a count of 20 to re-enter <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> to avoid being counted out. Often, in the situation where the player's wrestler has been knocked out of <b>the</b> <b>ring,</b> <b>the</b> opposing wrestler will follow {{them in order to}} execute one of the 4 moves allotted in the given situation. The first 3 moves are similar to The Straight Jab and The Karate Chop, the fourth, The Corner Bar, causes the wrestler executing the move to bash his opponent's head into <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> post.

The purposes of these moves is to hopefully keep the wrestler from re-entering <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> in time and be counted out.
