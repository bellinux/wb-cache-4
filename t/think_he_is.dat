5|$|After awakening, Jon Snow {{is greeted}} by Davos Seaworth and Melisandre. When asked by Davos {{what he can}} remember, Jon says he remembers only his {{assassination}} but nothing from being dead. Melisandre tells Jon that her religion prophesies the return of a heroic prince and suggests that this prince may not be Stannis, as she first thought, but Jon. Jon enters the courtyard {{to meet with the}} wildlings. He meets with and embraces Tormund Giantsbane and Dolorous Edd, Tormund saying the Wildlings <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> a god.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} act, Hyde fears {{that he will}} be arrested for the murder. He gives his landlady, Rebecca, money to tell {{visitors}} that he is not home. Inspector Newcome from Scotland Yard offers Rebecca more money to turn Hyde in, which she promises to do. Hyde flees to Jekyll's laboratory, where Utterson is waiting to confront the doctor about his will; he insults Utterson and leaves. Rebecca, who has followed Hyde, arrives and tells Utterson that Hyde murdered Sir Danvers. In the play's original version, the act ends with Jekyll returning to his laboratory. In later versions (revised after its premiere), the second act contains an additional scene in which Jekyll returns home; his friends <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> protecting Hyde. Agnes, who saw Hyde before her father was murdered, wants Jekyll to accompany her to provide the police with a description, and is distraught when he refuses.|$|E

25|$|As {{he admits}} in the Papers, Flashman is a coward, who will flee from danger {{if there was}} any way to do so, and has on some {{occasions}} collapsed in funk. He has one great advantage in concealing this weakness: when he is frightened, his face turns red, rather than white, so that observers <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> excited, enraged, or exuberantas a hero ought to be.|$|E
25|$|Sabinus {{has been}} wounded in battle. He hears news of Éponine's capture and is desperate to rescue her. The Genius of Gaul appears and tells Sabinus that Éponine {{will be saved}} but Sabinus must first hide {{underground}} so everybody will <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> dead. To encourage Sabinus, the Genius offers him {{a vision of the}} future glory of Gaul: the Emperor Charlemagne is seen on his throne ruling the nations of Western Europe.|$|E

He said that he had been persuaded by the support of the people. He stated that he does not <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> the favourite in the election, and that he won't run a political campaign, attack his rivals, or participate in debates. He also announced that he will participate in a television programme called A week with the President.|$|E

25|$|Superintendent Spence informs Hercule Poirot of {{the case}} of Mrs McGinty, an elderly charwoman, {{apparently}} killed by her lodger, James Bentley, for her savings of £30, which she kept under a floorboard. Bentley is convicted and to be executed for the crime, but Spence does not <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> guilty. Poirot agrees {{to go to the}} town of Broadhinny and investigate the murder further. Poirot finds that Mrs McGinty often worked as a cleaner at the houses of people in the village. No one wants to talk to Poirot, and most believe Bentley is the killer.|$|E

However, he intends to gather the 50,000 signatures required to qualify for the presidential ballot. He also announced that he will participate in a television programme called A week with the President. Michal Horáček criticised Zeman's decision not to participate in presidential debates.|$|E
25|$|Sargent's best portraits {{reveal the}} {{individuality}} and {{personality of the}} sitters; his most ardent admirers <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> matched in this only by Velázquez, {{who was one of}} Sargent's great influences. The Spanish master's spell is apparent in Sargent's The Daughters of Edward Darley Boit, 1882, a haunting interior that echoes Velázquez's Las Meninas. As in many of his early portraits, Sargent confidently tries different approaches with each new challenge, here employing both unusual composition and lighting to striking effect. One of his most widely exhibited and best loved works of the 1880s was The Lady with the Rose (1882), a portrait of Charlotte Burckhardt, a close friend and possible romantic attachment.|$|E

25|$|Root threatens Mulch with {{imprisonment}} in {{the goblin}} prison Howler's Peak, and offers the dwarf a two-day head start if he assists in the break-in. The team use Mulch's original strategy to enter {{through one of}} the titanium foundation rods. One rod was not actually solid as Mulch and his cousin had diverted sewage into the shaft instead. After reaching the bottom of the foundation rod, and climbing through Mulch's recyclings, Butler, Root and Holly mount a desperate charge to the communications centre. While the three soldiers battle through an army of goblins, Artemis enters the network of deactivated plasma cannons to reach the centre by another route. Artemis manages to sneak into the hub long enough to communicate with Foaly, who uses Artemis's laptop to play back Cudgeon's own voice, revealing that Cudgeon planned to betray the goblins. Cudgeon is unfazed, and reactivates the plasma cannons to knock out all the goblins in Koboi Labs. Butler, Root and Holly smash their way into the centre, where Cudgeon holds Artemis at gunpoint. However, Foaly calls Artemis' mobile phone, and Artemis hands it to Koboi, who is then enraged to find that Cudgeon planned to betray her too. The two masterminds grapple with each other on Opal's hoverchair, and Cudgeon is killed when he is thrown into the open DNA cannon plasma feed, while the crash causes Opal to blackout, and destroys the remote control used by Opal to control LEP weaponry. Foaly uses the restored power to activate DNA cannons in Police Plaza, neutralizing most of the goblins involved in the revolt. Foaly remains in the Operations Booth, as the LEP outside, commanded by Captain Trouble Kelp, still <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> to blame for the revolt.|$|E

[...] Encouraged by Koch, the young woman contacted the campus police, who again warned Cho against further unwanted contact. After that warning, Cho made no further contact with the second female student.|$|E

When asked whether or not Mulder is Jewish, Gordon said that he did not think that he is, nor did he <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> [...] "even half-Jewish". He did, however, note that [...] "there's something about David [...] that could be Jewish or that has a Jewish sensibility." ...|$|E

When Michael and Dwight get the news, they celebrate their success, believing, erroneously, that they accomplished it. After agonizing over the decision, Jim accepts the position and suggests to Karen Filippelli (Rashida Jones) that she join him in Scranton. In a talking head interview, Karen admits that even though she does not <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> [...] "into her," [...] she is [...] "kind of into him".|$|E
500|$|In April 2007, Dr. Frank Menetrez, {{a former}} Editor-in-Chief of the UCLA Law Review, {{published}} {{an analysis of}} the charges made against Finkelstein by Dershowitz, finding no merit in any single charge and concluding that Dershowitz had misrepresented matters. In a follow-up analysis he concluded that he could find 'no way of avoiding the inference that Dershowitz copied the quotation from Twain from Peters's From Time Immemorial, and not from the original source', as Dershowitz claimed. In an interview given for the film [...] in 2009, Dershowitz said of Finkelstein: [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> a Jew. He's Jewish only on his parents' side." ...|$|E
500|$|Meeting {{the rest}} of Pam's family and friends, Greg still feels like an outsider. Despite efforts to impress the family, Greg's {{inadvertent}} actions make him {{an easy target for}} ridicule, disdain and anger: He accidentally breaks Debbie's nose during a volleyball mishap; uses a malfunctioning toilet that floods the Byrnes' back yard with sewage; sets the wedding altar on fire and inadvertently leads Jack to <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> a marijuana user. He also feels inferior to Kevin, Pam's ex-fiance who, unlike him, receives nothing but warmth and friendliness from Jack. Later, Greg loses Jinx and replaces him with a feral cat whose tail he spray paints to make him look like Mr. Jinx while desperately seeking Jack's approval.|$|E
