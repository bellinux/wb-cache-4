Known as tungsten spitting, this can be identified with radiography and can be prevented by changing the type of electrode or increasing the electrode diameter. In addition, if the electrode is not well protected by the gas shield or the operator accidentally allows it to contact the molten metal, it can become dirty or contaminated.

40|$|We {{study the}} zero-bandwidth {{limit of the}} two-impurity Anderson model in an antiferromagnetic (AF) metal. We calculate, for {{different}} values of the model parameters, the lowest excitation energy, the magnetic correlation $ $ between <b>the</b> <b>impurities,</b> and <b>the</b> magnetic moment at each impurity site, {{as a function of}} the distance between <b>the</b> <b>impurities</b> and <b>the</b> temperature. At zero temperature, in the region of parameters corresponding to the Kondo regime of <b>the</b> <b>impurities,</b> we observe an interesting competition between the AF gap and the Kondo physics of <b>the</b> two <b>impurities.</b> When <b>the</b> <b>impurities</b> are close enough, the AF splitting governs the physics of the system and the local moments of <b>the</b> <b>impurities</b> are frozen, in a state with very strong ferromagnetic correlation between <b>the</b> <b>impurities</b> and roughly independent of the distance. On the contrary, when <b>the</b> <b>impurities</b> are sufficiently far apart and the AF gap is not too large, the scenario of the Kondo physics take place: non-magnetic ground state and the possibility of spin-flip excitation emerges and the ferromagnetic $ $ decreases as the distance increases, but the complete decoupling of <b>the</b> <b>impurities</b> never occurs. In adition, the presence of the AF gap gives a non-zero magnetic moment at each impurity site, showing a non complete Kondo screening of <b>the</b> <b>impurities</b> in <b>the</b> system. We observe that the residual magnetic moment decreases when the distance between <b>the</b> <b>impurities</b> is increased.
