5|$|Japanese {{scientists}} and engineers {{have contributed to the}} advancement of agricultural sciences, electronics, industrial robotics, optics, chemicals, semiconductors, life sciences and various fields of engineering. Japan leads the world in robotics production and use, possessing more than 20% (300,000 of 1.3 million) of the world's industrial robots —though its share was historically even higher, representing one-half of all industrial robots worldwide in 2000. Japan boasts the third highest number of scientists, <b>technicians,</b> <b>and</b> engineers per capita in the world with 83 scientists, <b>technicians</b> <b>and</b> engineers per 10,000 employees.|$|E
5|$|In April 1942, the Maritime Commission {{took control}} of SS Agwileon under a bareboat charter and used her to {{transport}} civilian <b>technicians</b> <b>and</b> advisors to Freetown, Sierra Leone, for the U.S. Army. After having boiler difficulties there, the ship then proceeded back to New York via Cape Town, Brazil, Trinidad, and Cuba. The voyage was completed in October.|$|E

Since the show's fourth season (2000), Parker has assumed most of the show's directorial duties, while Stone relinquished {{his share of the}} directing to focus on handling the coordination and business aspects of the production.

5|$|At {{approximately}} 2:42a.m. on November 18, 1999, the 59-foot high stack, {{consisting of}} about 5000logs, collapsed during construction. Of the 58students and former students {{working on the}} stack, 12 were killed and 27 were injured. Immediately after the collapse, Emergency Medical <b>Technicians</b> <b>and</b> trained First Responders of the Texas A Emergency Care Team (TAMECT), a student-run, volunteer service, who staffed each stage of construction, administered first aid. TAMECT alerted the University Police and University EMS (also a student-run service), who dispatched all remaining university medics, and requested mutual aid from the surrounding agencies.|$|E
5|$|CSG International {{originally}} sold {{two versions}} of its billing process outsourcing services. Under new leadership in 1994, it began developing additional software and providing consulting to in-house billing departments. During this period it developed CSG Workforce Express, a suite of software products that manage the dispatch of <b>technicians</b> <b>and</b> other logistics at customer sites. Workforce Express consists of three applications: CSG Workforce Management, CSG TechNet and CSG TechNet CE, which integrate with CSG's databases and billing systems. It also developed CSG Care Express, which is for creating online self-service portals for consumers to view and pay their bills online.|$|E

5|$|In general, {{availability}} {{and quality of}} health care is better in Antananarivo than elsewhere in Madagascar, although it remains inadequate across the country relative to that in more developed countries. One of Madagascar's two medical schools is located in Antananarivo; most medical <b>technicians</b> <b>and</b> specialists are trained there. Neonatal and antenatal care is significantly better in Antananarivo than elsewhere on the island. Despite the presence of facilities and trained personnel, {{the high cost of}} health care places it beyond the reach of most residents of Antananarivo. Pharmaceuticals are imported, making them particularly unaffordable; traditional herbal medicines remain popular and are readily available in local markets frequented by most of the population.|$|E
5|$|Maeser also {{inspired}} a relationship between Meissen, where he was born, and Provo, Utah. Now, the two cities share a sister-city relationship. It is the hope of both cities that the relationship will grow to include the exchange of delegations, including manufacturers, youth, academicians, scientists, artists, associations, clubs, tourists, <b>technicians</b> <b>and</b> others, which will result in enriching the cultures of the respective cities. As of 2001, the two cities have been sending high school age students on a three-week-long exchange to gain more knowledge about their differences in society and culture.|$|E
5|$|One {{source of}} skilled {{personnel}} was the Army itself, particularly the Army Specialized Training Program. In 1943, the MED created the Special Engineer Detachment (SED), with an authorized strength of 675. <b>Technicians</b> <b>and</b> skilled workers {{drafted into the}} Army {{were assigned to the}} SED. Another source was the Women's Army Corps (WAC). Initially intended for clerical tasks handling classified material, the WACs were soon tapped for technical and scientific tasks as well. On 1 February 1945, all military personnel assigned to the MED, including all SED detachments, were assigned to the 9812th Technical Service Unit, except at Los Alamos, where military personnel other than SED, including the WACs and Military Police, were assigned to the 4817th Service Command Unit.|$|E

It offers 10 undergraduate programs which includes the degrees of Physician and Surgeon, Nurse, and Dentist, 3 graduate diplomas in medical administration, 22 medical specialties, 4 nursing specialties, 3 dentistry specialties, 5 Master's degrees, and a Doctorate in medical research with 3 emphasis areas.|$|E
5|$|Under a {{bareboat charter}} by the United States Maritime Commission, Agwileon carried {{civilian}} <b>technicians</b> <b>and</b> advisors to Sierra Leone for the U.S. Army. In November 1942, {{the ship was}} taken over by the Army as USAT Agwileon and converted to a troopship, making one trip in that capacity. In June 1943, the ship was selected for conversion to an Army hospital ship, and was renamed USAHS Shamrock. Operating locally in the Mediterranean for most of her career, the ship had transported almost 18,000 patients by September 1944. The ship was converted for use in the Pacific Theatre, but not before the war ended. The ship was placed in reserve in February 1946, and was scrapped in February 1948.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with other}} members of the lipocalin protein family, major urinary {{proteins}} can be potent allergens to humans. The reason for this is not known, however molecular mimicry between Mups and structurally similar human lipocalins has been proposed as a possible explanation. The protein product of the mouse Mup17 gene, known as Musm1, Ag1 or MA1, accounts for much of the allergenic properties of mouse urine. The protein is extremely stable in the environment; studies have found 95% of inner city homes, and 82% of all types of homes in the United States have detectable levels in at least one room. Similarly, Ratn1 is a known human allergen. A US study found its presence in 33% of inner city homes, and 21% of occupants were sensitized to the allergen. Exposure and sensitization to rodent Mup proteins is considered a risk factor for childhood asthma, and is a leading cause of laboratory animal allergy (LAA)—an occupational disease of laboratory animal <b>technicians</b> <b>and</b> scientists. One study found that two-thirds of laboratory workers who had developed asthmatic reactions to animals had antibodies to Ratn1.|$|E

5|$|Compton {{felt that}} having teams at Columbia University, Princeton University, the University of Chicago and the University of California was {{creating}} too much duplication {{and not enough}} collaboration, and he resolved to concentrate the work in one location. Nobody wanted to move, and everybody argued in favor of their own location. In January 1942, soon after the United States entered World War II, Compton decided on his own location, the University of Chicago, where {{he knew he had}} the unstinting support of university administration. Chicago also had a central location, and scientists, <b>technicians</b> <b>and</b> facilities were more readily available in the Midwest, where war work had not yet taken them away. In contrast, Columbia University was engaged in uranium enrichment efforts under Harold Urey and John Dunning, and was hesitant to add a third secret project.|$|E
5|$|From {{the first}} class of 14 June 1943, until the final class of 16 December 1944, more than 7,000 {{recruits}} were indoctrinated at the Palm Beach station. Approximately, 70 percent of the enlisted women who received recruit training also received some specialized training. Yeoman and storekeepers represented the largest share, but many SPARS were given the opportunity for training in other fields. Some attended other Navy schools and were trained as motion picture sound technicians, link trainer operators, parachute riggers, and air control operators. Others attended USCG schools and learned to be: cooks, bakers, radioman, pharmacist mates, radio <b>technicians,</b> <b>and</b> motor vehicle drivers. In January 1945, the training of enlisted personnel was transferred from Palm Beach to Manhattan Beach, Brooklyn, New York, the largest USCG training station for men.|$|E
5|$|The Waqf Ministry of Jordan held {{control of}} the al-Aqsa Mosque until the 1967 Six-Day War. After Israel's victory in that war, Israel {{transferred}} the {{control of the}} mosque and the northern Noble Sanctuary to the Islamic waqf trust, who are independent of the Israeli government. However, Israeli Security Forces are permitted to patrol and conduct searches within the perimeter of the mosque. After the 1969 arson attack, the waqf employed architects, <b>technicians</b> <b>and</b> craftsmen in a committee that carry out regular maintenance operations. The Islamic Movement in Israel and the waqf have attempted to increase Muslim control of the Temple Mount as a way of countering Israeli policies and the escalating presence of Israeli security forces around the site since the Second Intifada. Some activities included refurbishing abandoned structures and renovating.|$|E

5|$|The White armies were {{established}} by former Tsarist military officers, and included Anton Denikin's Volunteer Army in South Russia, Alexander Kolchak's forces in Siberia, and Nikolai Yudenich's {{troops in the}} newly independent Baltic states. The Whites were bolstered when 35,000 members of the Czech Legion – prisoners of war from the conflict with the Central Powers – turned against Sovnarkom and allied with the Committee of Members of the Constituent Assembly (Komuch), an anti-Bolshevik government established in Samara. The Whites were also backed by Western governments who perceived the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk as a betrayal of the Allied war effort and feared the Bolsheviks' calls for world revolution. In 1918, the United Kingdom, France, United States, Canada, Italy, and Serbia landed 10,000 troops in Murmansk, seizing Kandalaksha, while later that year British, American, and Japanese forces landed in Vladivostok. Western troops soon {{pulled out of the}} civil war, instead only supporting the Whites with officers, <b>technicians</b> <b>and</b> armaments, but Japan remained because they saw the conflict as an opportunity for territorial expansion.|$|E
5|$|The {{republicans}} boasted a new air force, {{while the}} royalists {{claimed to have}} shot down a MiG-17 fighter with a Russian pilot. The US State Department said that this claim, as well as reports of twenty-four MiGs and forty Soviet <b>technicians</b> <b>and</b> pilots who had arrived in Yemen, were correct. In January, the republicans were defending San'a with about 2,000 regulars and tribesmen, plus armed townsmen and about ten tanks. They also had the backing of a score or more fighter aircraft piloted by Russians or Yemenis who passed {{a crash course in}} the Soviet Union. The city could still feed itself from the immediately surrounding countryside. Between 4,000 and 5,000 royalists suffered from republican air power, but had the advantage of high ground. However, they did not have enough ammunition, as the Saudis had halted arms deliveries after the Khartoum agreement and stopped financing the royalists after December.|$|E
5|$|With {{the opening}} of the Platine rivers, Paraguay now found it {{possible}} to contract with European <b>technicians</b> <b>and</b> Brazilian specialists to aid in its development. Unhindered access to the outside world also enabled it to import more advanced military technology. During the greater part of the 1850s, the dictator Carlos López harassed Brazilian vessels attempting to freely navigate the Paraguay River. López feared that the province of Mato Grosso might become a base from which an invasion from Brazil could be launched. This dispute was also leverage with the Imperial government for acceptance of his territorial demands in the region. The nation also experienced difficulties in delimiting its borders with Argentina which wanted the whole Gran Chaco region: a demand which Paraguay could not accept, as this would entail surrendering more than half of its national territory.|$|E
