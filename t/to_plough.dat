5|$|Viva Piñata is a first-person life {{simulation}} game {{in which}} the player restores and tends to a neglected garden on Piñata Island. The player uses gardening tools, such as shovels and watering cans, <b>to</b> <b>plough</b> their garden, sow seeds, create ponds, and sculpt the garden to their liking. When certain requirements are fulfilled, the garden will attract a black-and-white outline of a given piñata species. After fulfilling additional requirements, the piñata will become a resident, changing into a full-color version.|$|E
5|$|International {{treaties}} may {{be necessary}} for such objectives as the setting up of marine reserves. Another international agreement, the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals, protects animals that migrate across the globe and need protection {{in more than one}} country. However, the protection of habitats needs {{to take into account the}} needs of the local residents for food, fuel and other resources. Even where legislation protects the environment, a lack of enforcement often prevents effective protection. Faced with food shortage, a farmer is likely <b>to</b> <b>plough</b> up a level patch of ground despite it being the last suitable habitat for an endangered species such as the San Quintin kangaroo rat, and even kill the animal as a pest. In this regard, it is desirable to educate the community on the uniqueness of their flora and fauna and the benefits of ecotourism.|$|E

25|$|Before the {{outbreak}} of war, Henderson-Stewart sought {{to ensure that the}} system of National Service in the armed services worked smoothly; in November 1939, he criticised the operation of the scheme in calling up agricultural workers when the government was calling for farmers <b>to</b> <b>plough</b> more land. In the Norway Debate of May 1940, Henderson Stewart voted against Chamberlain. After Churchill took over as Prime Minister, Henderson-Stewart enlisted again in the Royal Artillery in which he served from September 1940 to June 1941.|$|E
25|$|After {{the victory}} of the Popular Front in February 1936, the new {{government}} promised to start the land reform, but the agricultural unemployment was very high and the peasants started to illegally occupy large states. On 25 March 1936, 60,000 landless peasants in Badajoz led by the socialist's land union, the Federación Nacional de Trabajadores de la Tierra or FNTT, took over 3,000 farms and started <b>to</b> <b>plough.</b> The government decided to legalise the land occupations. By June 1936, 190,000 landless peasants had been settled in the southern Spain. Many landowners left for the cities.|$|E

25|$|The disease nagana or African animal trypanosomiasis (AAT) causes gradual health {{decline in}} {{infected}} livestock, reduces milk and meat production, increases abortion rates, and animals eventually {{succumb to the}} disease (annual cattle deaths caused by trypanosomiasis are estimated at 3 million). This has {{an enormous impact on}} the livelihood of farmers who live in tsetse-infested areas, as infected animals cannot be used <b>to</b> <b>plough</b> the land, and keeping cattle is only feasible when the animals are kept under constant prophylactic treatment with trypanocidal drugs, often with associated problems of drug resistance, counterfeited drugs, and suboptimal dosage. The overall annual direct lost potential in livestock and crop production was estimated at US$4.5 billion.|$|E
25|$|Due <b>to</b> <b>Plough</b> Lane's modest {{capacity}} and Wimbledon's unprecedented rise from non-League football to the First Division in under ten years, the club {{had a much}} lower level of support than its top-flight rivals. During Wimbledon's first season in The Football League, Wimbledon's average attendance was only 3,135 – however, by the club's appearance in the top flight nine years later the average attendance had risen by 149% to 7,811. Attendances did not immediately change much following the move to Selhurst Park in 1991 – however, the larger capacity gradually started to be used. Average crowds peaked at 18,235 in 1998–99, and during the next season, the team's final year in the FA Premier League, home crowds averaged 17,157. With relegation, attendances dropped catastrophically {{to an average of}} only 7,897 during 2000–01.

25|$|Tithes are broken-off {{during the}} Sabbatical year (such {{as when the}} ground lies fallow), during which year, all fruits, grains and {{vegetables}} that are grown of themselves in that year are considered free and ownerless property. For example, whatever lands were held by those returning from the Babylonian exile {{at the time of}} Ezra are forbidden to be ploughed and sown by any Jew during the Seventh year, and even if gentiles were <b>to</b> <b>plough</b> such land and sow it, the produce would be forbidden unto Jews to eat. On the other hand, the extension of such lands held by the people of Israel who departed Egypt and who entered the Land of Canaan under their leader, Joshua, are forbidden to be ploughed by any Jew during the Seventh year, but if gentiles had ploughed such land and sown it, the produce is permitted to be eaten by a Jew. If on a regular week-year, fruits and grains and vegetables, if grown by an Israelite in these places, would require tithing.|$|E
25|$|Wimbledon {{originally}} {{played on}} Wimbledon Common, using the Fox and Grapes public house in Camp Road as the team's headquarters and changing room. The club moved <b>to</b> <b>Plough</b> Lane in September 1912. During the 1930s and 1940s, crowds of between 7,000 and 10,000 were not uncommon at the ground. Wimbledon's highest {{attendance at the}} ground came on 2 March 1935, when 18,080 people were attracted to an FA Amateur Cup tie against HMS Victory. However, the ground was basic, and even after the club's rapid rise to the First Division Plough Lane had changed little from Wimbledon's amateur days. The only notable difference was the addition of floodlights, first used on 3 October 1960 in a London Charity Cup match against Arsenal. At {{the time of the}} club's acceptance into The Football League, applicants had only to meet minimal stadium criteria, and once in the League these same criteria sufficed whether the club subsequently found itself in the Fourth or First Division. Following the Hillsborough disaster and the Taylor Report, the football authorities introduced far stricter safety rules that gave top-flight clubs specific deadlines by which to redevelop terraced grounds or to build new all-seater stadiums. The board of the club decided that Plough Lane could not be made to comply with this economically and, in 1990, announced plans to temporarily groundshare with Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park in the town of Croydon, Surrey. When the club competed in the Intertoto Cup in 1995 Selhurst Park was not available, so Wimbledon's home games were played at the Goldstone Ground, the then home ground of Brighton & Hove Albion.|$|E

50|$|Grain farming {{occurred}} in two bursts of activity. Spring, after the melting of the snows, was dedicated <b>to</b> <b>ploughing</b> and sowing the spring field.

40|$|Abstract. Two field {{experiments}} were carried from 1999 to 2001 {{to assess the}} effectiveness of autumn, winter and spring application of straw-based farmyard manure (FYM). The soil was a sandy loam containing 106 g clay kg- 1 situated in the temperate coastal climate of Denmark. The FYM was applied manually to experimental plots at a target rate of 300 kgN ha- 1. The manure was incorporated by three initial tillage strategies (harrowing, rotavating or no-tillage) prior <b>to</b> <b>ploughing.</b> All combinations of tillage strategies were also carried out without manure application. Spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) was grown, followed by ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.). The results suggest that, as far as circumstances permit, FYM should be applied in spring to achieve the optimum use of nitrogen in the manure. Further, yield and nitrogen uptake did not benefit from harrowing or rotavating the manure before ploughing. When manure was not applied, soil tillage prior <b>to</b> <b>ploughing</b> did not significantly affect grain yield or nitrogen uptake...|$|R
500|$|The {{commission}} report described redeveloping Plough Lane, which Merton Council insisted remained viable [...] "if {{there is a}} will for the club to pursue this option", as the only recourse for Wimbledon other than Milton Keynes. A feasibility study carried out by Drivers Jonas, commissioned and funded jointly by Wimbledon F.C. and Merton Council, described a 20,000-capacity stadium at Plough Lane as physically possible but [...] "extremely ambitious", risky and financially unsustainable given the club's money problems. The commission ruled that it was unreasonable to expect Wimbledon's owners to pursue a move back <b>to</b> <b>Plough</b> Lane under these circumstances. Parker and Stride concluded that on the evidence presented Milton Keynes was the only option {{that would give the}} club a chance of financial survival, and therefore ruled in favour of the move, two to one—Turvey dissented—on 28 May 2002.|$|E

No. 'Heather Mills has Melt Down' screamed the headlines, so now she had lost her marbles to boot.

500|$|Noble {{and church}} landowners responded in various ways. They began to invest {{significantly}} less in agriculture and land was increasingly {{taken out of}} production altogether. In some cases entire settlements were abandoned, and nearly 1,500 villages were lost during this period. Landowners also abandoned the system of direct management of their demesne lands, which had begun back in the 1180s, and turned instead to [...] "farming" [...] out large blocks of land for fixed money rents. Initially, livestock and land were rented out together under [...] "stock and lease" [...] contracts, but this {{was found to be}} increasingly impractical and contracts for farms became centred purely on land. Many of the rights to church parish tithes were also [...] "farmed" [...] out in exchange for fixed rents. This process was encouraged by the trend for tithe revenues being increasing [...] "appropriated" [...] by central church authorities, rather than being used to support local clergy: around 39% of parish tithes had been centralised in this way by 1535. As the major estates transformed, a new economic grouping, the gentry, became evident, many of them benefiting from the opportunities of the farming system. Land distribution remained heavily unequal; estimates suggest that the English nobility owned 20% of English lands, the Church and Crown 33%, the gentry 25%, and the remainder was owned by peasant farmers. Agriculture itself continued to innovate, and the loss of many English oxen to the murrain sickness in the crisis increased the number of horses used <b>to</b> <b>plough</b> fields in the 14th century, a significant improvement on older methods.|$|E
