5|$|In 1954, Romeo Guest, a {{building}} contractor, {{met with the}} North Carolina state treasurer, Brandon Hodges, {{and the president of}} Wachovia, Robert Hanes, to discuss building a research park in North Carolina to attract new industries to the region. They obtained support for the concept of Research Triangle Park from state governor Luther Hodges and the three universities that form <b>the</b> <b>research</b> triangle: University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Duke University and North Carolina State University. <b>The</b> <b>Research</b> Triangle Institute (now RTI International) was formed as <b>the</b> <b>research</b> park's first tenant in 1958 by the park's founders.

The method of this study, <b>the</b> group <b>research</b> in physical education were drawn out from "Research Journal of Physical Education" (published by Japsnese Society of Physical Education) and their researches were classified and examined. Main findings were as follows: (1) Till about 1960, the studies on the group learning, learning by the small groups, were remarkable. Also, <b>the</b> <b>researches</b> on <b>the</b> learning group in physical education, especialy concerning with the play group were started in this term. (2) Later, these researches were differentiated tnto "the <b>research</b> on <b>the</b> learning method", which were developed and used in the practice of school physical education, and <b>the</b> "positive <b>researches</b> on <b>the</b> mechanism of the learning group in physical education". (3) <b>The</b> positive <b>researches</b> were futher being specialized into the reesarches on "the play group" or "the learning group in physical education" and <b>the</b> <b>researches</b> on "the sports group". (4) As the methods, the experiments by model small group in <b>the</b> <b>researches</b> on <b>the</b> play group, and a questionnire in <b>the</b> <b>researches</b> on <b>the</b> sports group have been chiefly used. (5) As the themes on <b>the</b> groups <b>research</b> in future, <b>the</b> following points may be indicated.
