He also {{played a role in the}} introduction of the shot clock; and in the NCAA, his dominating play around the basket led to the outlawing of defensive goaltending. Mikan was a harbinger of the NBA's future, which would be dominated by tall, powerful players.|$|E
5|$|Ferranti {{began work}} on {{building}} the computer on 1 December 1950, with engineer Raymond Stuart-Williams adapting the design by Bennett into a working machine. Development was completed by 12 April 1951, resulting in a device <b>twelve</b> <b>feet</b> wide, nine feet deep, and five feet tall. The majority of the volume was taken up by vacuum tubes and the light bulbs that displayed {{the state of the}} game, with the actual computer taking up no more than two percent of the total volume of the machine. The Nimrod took the form of a large box with panels of lights, with a raised stand in front of it with buttons corresponding with the lights, which in turn represented the objects the player could remove.|$|E
5|$|With {{his budget}} {{concerns}} alleviated, Chandler booked time at Olympic, where on February 3, 1967, {{he and the}} Experience met sound engineer Eddie Kramer. During Kramer's first session with the group, he deviated from the standard recording method {{that they had been}} using at CBS and De Lane Lea, which was to record bass and drums in mono on two tracks. He instead recorded Mitchell's drums on two tracks in stereo, leaving the remaining two tracks available for Redding's bass and rhythm guitar parts played by Hendrix. Kramer's unorthodox approach, which was inspired by Hendrix's complaints regarding the limitations of four-track recordings, captured the live sound of the band using all four available tracks. Kramer and Chandler then pre-mixed and reduced the first four tracks down to two, making two more tracks available for lead guitar overdubs and vocals. This method satisfied both Hendrix's perfectionism and Chandler's desire {{to reduce the number of}} takes required for a satisfactory rhythm track, thus minimizing their expenses. Another change instigated by Kramer was the use of a mixture of close and distant microphone placements when recording Hendrix's guitar parts whereas, during previous sessions, the microphones had been placed about <b>twelve</b> <b>feet</b> away from Hendrix's amplifiers. In addition to the usual choices, Kramer used Beyer M1 60 ribbon microphones, which were typically not used to record loud music.|$|E

50|$|A 12 ft tall wooden statue {{stands at}} the Riverfront Park in Peace River to commemorate Henry Fuller Davis, {{one of the most}} famous figures in the Town of Peace River's history. His “Twelve Foot Davis” {{nickname}} stems from the <b>twelve</b> <b>foot</b> land claim during the Cariboo Country gold rush in British Columbia which netted him almost $30,000 worth of gold. He took these profits and staked it all on a trading post close to where the Town of Peace River stands today. It is for this reason that the Town of Peace River is sometimes referred to as the Land of <b>Twelve</b> <b>Foot</b> Davis. <b>Twelve</b> <b>Foot</b> Davis' gravesite is designated a park and is located on the top of Grouard Hill just east of the town.|$|R

25|$|William Louis ordered {{trenches}} to be dug {{towards the}} fortress and sconces {{to be built}} around the city. As a result, all the roads that were administered to the city was thus {{cut off from the}} outside. The siege lines around Coevorden was virtually complete except on the East part of city which was marshy and no siege work could be done. Engineers and pioneers were sent to the city moat so that a cover trench could be made on the fortress. Digging begun and soon the trench itself was four to five feet deep (about 1.5 meters) and <b>twelve</b> <b>feet</b> wide (approximately four meters). An attack by pioneers and soldiers on a village suburb was attempted whilst the siege lines got closer. However, the attack was repulsed by the garrison in the city but determined they attacked again the next day and managed to occupy the suburb.|$|E
25|$|The {{garden was}} located behind the house, {{or on the}} {{southern}} side. The garden was grown above a man-made level platform where {{there used to be}} a hill, and was exactly one acre (about 4000sqm) in area. A gravel path runs from the back of the house to the southern edge, and was <b>twelve</b> <b>feet</b> (3.7m) wide during Mason's time period, the same width as the central passage in the house and the portico. Today, the path is narrower, crowded by boxwoods that are now about 250 years old. The path ends in an overlook extending out from the steep edge of the garden. From here, the Potomac river can be seen. The Gunston Hall museum website says that the view was more impressive during Mason's time, when the trees were cleared. The garden was most likely broken into four rectangles, with additional gravel paths running through and around it. To give the illusion from the house of all rectangles being the same size, the rectangles closer to the house were probably shorter than the rectangles farther away.|$|E
25|$|After {{the bones}} were prepared, photographed and studied, {{they were sent}} to New Jersey where work began on making the mount. This work {{consists}} of bending steel to support each bone safely and to display the entire skeleton articulated {{as it was in}} life. The real skull was not incorporated into the mount as subsequent study would be difficult with the head 13 feet off the ground. Parts of the skull had been crushed and broken, and thus appeared distorted. The museum made a cast of the skull, and altered this cast to remove the distortions, thus approximating what the original undistorted skull may have looked like. The cast skull was also lighter, allowing it to be displayed on the mount without the use of a steel upright under the head. The original skull is exhibited in a case that can be opened to allow researchers access for study. When the whole skeleton was assembled it was forty two feet (twelve meters) long from nose to tail and <b>twelve</b> <b>feet</b> (four meters) tall at the hips.|$|E

25|$|There were {{problems}} of congestion at Smethwick {{caused by the}} time taken to traverse the locks and with supplying sufficient water to the summit level. John Smeaton was engaged to advise on a solution. He specified a 1000-yard cutting through the top eighteen feet of the summit, eliminating three locks from each end, and doubling {{the capacity of the}} descent at Smethwick locks by building a parallel flight of three locks, in use until the 1960s. The changes were made in two phases with a new cut to the side to remove two locks from each end and lower the summit by <b>twelve</b> <b>feet,</b> and then another parallel cut another six feet lower, removing another lock at each end and the provision of a parallel set of three locks at the Smethwick end. In 1790, after 2½ years the cutting was completed. The canal was closed for only 14 days. The lowered summit was at the Wolverhampton Level and simplified water supply. Water was also pumped from several local coal mines. The Spon Lane engine was removed and sold but the Smethwick Engine continued to be used to pump used water from the Birmingham Level.|$|E
25|$|The Mālaqa shipyards, the Atarazanas, {{were built}} {{during the reign}} (1354–1391) of Mohammed V to {{strengthen}} his political and military power. Constructed as a naval workshop, with probably some limited use as a warehouse, the main building was one of Mālaqa's largest and most impressive, and was noted for its seven monumental horseshoe arches. During this period the coast was further inland and the Atarazanas was {{at the edge of}} the sea, so low that the water flowed in and formed a basin capacious enough to contain 20 galleys. The walls around it were eighty feet high; the arches, for the reception of ships, were sixty feet high by thirty wide, and <b>twelve</b> <b>feet</b> thick, and each of these arches had its own gate. The southern facade was described by Hieronymus Münzer in 1494: it had six open arches providing access to a high vaulted nave with transverse ribs under which the ships anchored. The seventh arch, located on the left, and still in existence today, was the entranceway to a large columned courtyard. There are two heraldic shields above the arch, designed in Castilian style and having diagonal bands inscribed in Arabic with the Nasrid motto, Wah lâ ghâlib ilâ Allâh (There is no victor other than God). At the western corner was a square tower attached to the portal and from there a wall joined the Borch Hayta, or Torre del Clamor, which closed the natural inlet between it and the Genoese castle, which is no longer extant. The tower served as a minaret for the muezzin to call the faithful to prayer at the mosque.|$|E
25|$|Vercingetorix {{sent the}} cavalry around Gaul {{to call the}} Gallic tribes to war and come to Alesia. When Caesar heard of this from deserters and captives, he dug a trench twenty feet deep (6 metres, 19ft.) with {{perpendicular}} sides, built all other works four hundred feet (118 m, 388ft.) away from that trench and in between he dug two trenches fifteen feet (4.4 m,14.5ft.) in length and depth. The inner one was filled with water from the rivers. Behind them he built a <b>twelve</b> <b>feet</b> high (3.5 m, 11.6ft.) rampart and wall with a parapet and large stakes projecting from the joint between the parapet and the battlement to prevent the enemy from scaling it. This was surrounded with turrets eighty feet apart (23.7 m, 77.7ft.). The stakes for the palisade were sharpened to a point, sunk into a five-feet deep trench (1.5m, 4.85ft.), fastened at the bottom {{so that they could}} not be pulled up, and placed in five intersected rows. Eight rows, three feet apart (0.89 m, 2.9ft.), of conic pits which were three feet deep were dug in oblique rows {{in the form of a}} quincunx (an arrangement of five objects with four at the corners the fifth at the centre) in front of the palisade.They were called 'cippi.' Stakes sharpened at the top and hardened with fire, the thickness of a man’s thigh, were sunk in the pits and protruded four inches (0.1 m, 3.9 inches) from the ground. The pits were filled with clay and covered over with twigs. One-foot-long stakes (0.3 m) with iron hooks were sunk at small intervals in front of the pits. To prepare for the arrival of the Gallic relief forces he constructed an outer fortification, a contravallation, with the same specifications as protection against external attack by the Gallic relief force. The besiegers were preparing to be besieged.|$|E
