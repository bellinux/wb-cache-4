5|$|By {{the close}} of the first day, the 7th Army was still largely mobilising and concentrating, and fifth column actions meant <b>that</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>all</b> the {{fighting}} was conducted by border troops. The 38th Infantry Division Dravska was deployed along the southern bank of the Drava, with the 128th Infantry Regiment and an artillery battalion around Ptuj, the 45th Infantry Regiment and an artillery battalion around Maribor and the 112th Infantry Regiment and an artillery battalion were at Slovenj Gradec and marching east towards Dravograd. German and Italian air attacks interfered with the deployment of troops and command was hampered by reliance on civilian telegraph and telephone services.|$|E
5|$|Courses on {{this subject}} have grown {{significantly}} {{in the last couple}} of decades. Teaching accountants about ethics can involve role playing, lectures, case studies, guest lectures, as well as other mediums. Recent studies indicate <b>that</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>all</b> accounting textbooks touch on ethics in some way. In 1993, the first United States center that focused on the study of ethics in the accounting profession opened at Binghamton University. Starting in 1999, several U.S. states began requiring ethics classes prior to taking the CPA exam.|$|E
5|$|Lashed together, Temeraire and Fougueux {{exchanged}} fire, Temeraire initially {{clearing the}} French ship's upper deck with small arms fire. The French rallied, but the greater {{height of the}} three-decked Temeraire compared to the two-decked Fougueux thwarted their attempts to board. Instead Harvey dispatched his own boarding party, led by First-Lieutenant Thomas Fortescue Kennedy, which entered Fougueux via her main deck ports and chains. The French tried to defend the decks port by port, but were steadily overwhelmed. Fougueuxs captain, Louis Alexis Baudoin, had suffered a fatal wound earlier in the fighting, leaving Commander François Bazin in charge. When he learned <b>that</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>all</b> of the officers were dead or wounded and {{that most of the}} guns were out of action, Bazin surrendered the ship to the boarders.|$|E

5|$|There is some {{disagreement}} {{among both}} ancient authors and modern scholars about the ethnic {{identity of the}} ancient Macedonians. Ernst Badian notes <b>that</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>all</b> surviving references to antagonisms and differences between Greeks and Macedonians exist in the written speeches of Arrian, who lived {{at the time of}} the Roman Empire, when any notion of an ethnic disparity between Macedonians and other Greeks was incomprehensible. Hatzopoulos argues that there was no real ethnic difference between Macedonians and Greeks, only a political distinction contrived after the creation of the League of Corinth in 337BC (which was led by Macedonia through the league's elected hegemon PhilipII, when he was not a member of the league itself). Other academics who concur that the difference between the Macedonians and Greeks was a political rather than a true ethnic discrepancy include Michael B. Sakellariou, Malcolm Errington, and Craige B. Champion.|$|E
5|$|Late that day, {{mountain}} pioneers destroyed some isolated Yugoslav bunkers in {{the area}} penetrated by Kampfgruppe Palten, and German aircraft again attacked the 7th Army's air reconnaissance assets {{on the ground at}} Cerklje, destroying most of them at the second attempt. This was followed by Italian air attacks on 7th Army troop concentrations. The VVKJ was unable to interdict the Axis air attacks because their fighters were based too far away. After having been grounded {{for most of the day}} by poor weather, in the afternoon, Yugoslav bombers flew missions against airfields and railway stations across the Reich frontier. By the close of 6 April, the 7th Army was still largely mobilising and concentrating, and fifth column actions meant <b>that</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>all</b> the fighting was conducted by border troops. The 38th Infantry Division Dravska was deployed along the southern bank of the Drava around Ptuj and Maribor, and a reinforced infantry regiment was approaching Dravograd from the west. German and Italian air attacks interfered with the deployment of troops and command was hampered by reliance on civilian telegraph and telephone services. LI Infantry Corps had occupied Gornja Radgona, Murska Sobota and Radenci, and had crossed the Drava near Sveti Duh. XLIX Mountain Corps captured border crossings on the approaches to Dravograd, but were held up by border troops in mountain passes located further west.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect of}} the mirror flaw on {{scientific}} observations depended on the particular observation—the core of the aberrated PSF was sharp enough to permit high-resolution observations of bright objects, and spectroscopy of point sources was only affected through a sensitivity loss. However, the loss of light to the large, out of focus halo severely reduced {{the usefulness of the}} telescope for faint objects or high-contrast imaging. This meant <b>that</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>all</b> of the cosmological programs were essentially impossible, since they required observation of exceptionally faint objects. NASA and the telescope became the butt of many jokes, and the project was popularly regarded as a white elephant. For instance, in the 1991 comedy , Hubble was pictured with the Lusitania, the Hindenburg, and the Edsel. Nonetheless, during {{the first three years of}} the Hubble mission, before the optical corrections, the telescope still carried out a large number of productive observations of less demanding targets. The error was well characterized and stable, enabling astronomers to partially compensate for the defective mirror by using sophisticated image processing techniques such as deconvolution.|$|E

5|$|The {{greater number}} of naturalists who have taken into {{consideration}} the whole structure of man, including his mental faculties, have followed Blumenbach and Cuvier, and have placed man in a separate Order, under {{the title of the}} Bimana, and therefore on an equality with the orders of the Quadrumana, Carnivora, etc. Recently many of our best naturalists have recurred to the view first propounded by Linnaeus, so remarkable for his sagacity, and have placed man in the same Order with the Quadrumana, under the title of the Primates. The justice of this conclusion will be admitted: for in the first place, we must bear in mind the comparative insignificance for classification of the great development of the brain in man, and that the strongly marked differences between the skulls of man and the Quadrumana (lately insisted upon by Bischoff, Aeby, and others) apparently follow from their differently developed brains. In the second place, we must remember <b>that</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>all</b> the other and more important differences between man and the Quadrumana are manifestly adaptive in their nature, and relate chiefly to the erect position of man; such as the structure of his hand, foot, and pelvis, the curvature of his spine, and the position of his head. I absolutely know of none. If only someone might tell me a single one! If I would have called man a simian or vice versa, I would have brought together all the theologians against me. Perhaps I ought to have by virtue of the law of the discipline.|$|E
