Three analyses of <b>telemonitored</b> mood data are reported, each corresponding to a journal paper by the author. The first analysis reveals that patients whose sleep varies in quality tend to return mood ratings more sporadically than those with less variable sleep quality. The second analysis finds that forecasting depression with weekly data is not feasible using weekly mood ratings. A third analysis shows that depression time series cannot be distinguished from their linear surrogates, and that nonlinear forecasting methods are no more accurate than linear methods in forecasting mood. An additional contribution {{is the development of}} a new k-nearest neighbour forecasting algorithm which is evaluated on the mood data and other time series. Further work is proposed on more frequently sampled data and on system identification.

Design Case series of <b>telemonitored</b> patients with leg ulcers including cost-effectiveness analysis. Setting Home monitoring by home care nurses. Patients Sixteen patients with 45 leg ulcers of different origin were included. Main Outcome Measures After an initial outpatient visit when the leg ulcers were assessed and classified, teledermatological follow-up was done by home care nurses. Relevant clinical information and 1 to 4 digital images of the wound and surrounding skin were transmitted weekly via a secure Web site to an expert at the wound care center, who assessed the wound and made therapeutic recommendations. Results Of the 707 images transmitted for teleconsultation, in 644 (89 %) {{the quality of the}} images was excellent or sufficient and the experts were confident in giving therapeutic recommendations. Of the 45 ulcers, 32 (71 %) decreased in size and 14 (31 %) healed completely, whereas 10 of the 45 ulcers (22 %) increased slightly in size despite the teledermatological monitoring. In 3 ulcers (7 %), no measurement was possible owing to the overly large size of the ulcers. The acceptance of telemedicine was very good by most patients. Of 15 home care nurses working in the district, 7 were very satisfied with teledermatological monitoring of wound care. There was a reduction of 46 % in transportation costs for the insurance companies {{as well as for the}} patients owing to a significant decrease in the number of visits to general physicians or the wound care center. Conclusions The acceptance of teledermatological monitoring of wound care was very high by patients, home care nurses, and wound experts.

5000|$|The {{last decade}} {{has seen a}} {{proliferation}} of information technology use in the planning and conduct of clinical trials. Clinical trial management systems are often used by research sponsors or CROs to help plan and manage the operational aspects of a clinical trial, {{particularly with respect to}} investigational sites. Advanced analytics for identifying researchers and research sites with expertise in a given area utilize public and private information about ongoing research. [...] Web-based electronic data capture (EDC) and clinical data management systems are used in a majority of clinical trials to collect case report data from sites, manage its quality and prepare it for analysis. Interactive voice response systems are used by sites to register the enrollment of patients using a phone and to allocate patients to a particular treatment arm (although phones are being increasingly replaced with web-based (IWRS) tools which are sometimes part of the EDC system). While patient-reported outcome were often paper based in the past, measurements are increasingly being collected using web portals or hand-held ePRO (or eDiary) devices, sometimes wireless. Statistical software is used to analyze the collected data and prepare them for regulatory submission. Access to many of these applications are increasingly aggregated in web-based clinical trial portals. In 2011, the FDA approved a phase 1 trial that used <b>telemonitoring,</b> also known as remote patient monitoring, to collect biometric data in patients' homes and transmit it electronically to the trial database. This technology provides many more data points and is far more convenient for patients, because they have fewer visits to trial sites.|$|E

In total, 31 out of 86 (36 %) heart failure clinics were using <b>telemonitoring</b> and 12 heart failure clinics (14 %) planned to use <b>telemonitoring</b> within one year. The number of heart failure patients receiving <b>telemonitoring</b> generally varied between 10 and 50; although in two clinics more than 75 patients used <b>telemonitoring.</b> The main goals for using <b>telemonitoring</b> are "monitoring physical condition", "monitoring signs of deterioration" (n= 39, 91 %), "monitoring treatment" (n= 32, 74 %), "adjusting medication" (n= 24, 56 %), and "educating patients" (n= 33, 77 %). Most patients using <b>telemonitoring</b> were in the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classes II (n= 19, 61 %) and III (n= 27, 87 %) and were offered the use of the <b>telemonitoring</b> system "as long as needed" or without a time limit. However, the expectations of the use of <b>telemonitoring</b> were not met after implementation. Eight of the 11 items about expectations versus experiences were significantly decreased (Pandlt;. 001). Health care professionals experienced the most changes related to the use of <b>telemonitoring</b> in their work, in particular with respect to "keeping up with current development" (before 7. 2, after 6. 8, P=. 15), "being innovative" (before 7. 0, after 6. 1, P=. 003), and "better guideline adherence" (before 6. 3, after 5. 3, P=. 005).

40|$|Background There {{has been}} growing {{interest}} regarding the impact of <b>telemonitoring</b> {{and its ability to}} reduce the increasing burden of chronic diseases, including chronic cardiovascular disease (CVD), on healthcare systems. A number of randomised trials have been undertaken internationally and synthesised into various systematic reviews to establish an evidence base for this model of care. This study sought to synthesise and critically evaluate this large body of evidence to inform clinicians, researchers and policy makers. Methods A systematic review of systematic reviews investigating the impact of <b>telemonitoring</b> interventions in the primary care management of CVD was conducted. Reviews were included if they explored primary care based <b>telemonitoring</b> in either CVD, heart failure or hypertension, were reported in the English language and were published between 2000 and 2013. Data was extracted by one reviewer and checked by a second reviewer using a standardised form. Two assessors then rated the quality of each review using the Overview Quality Assessment Questionnaire (OQAQ). Results Of the 13 included reviews, four focused on <b>telemonitoring</b> interventions in hypertension or CVD management and the remaining 9 reviews investigated <b>telemonitoring</b> in HF management. Seven reviews scored a five or above on the OQAQ evidencing good quality reviews. Findings suggest that <b>telemonitoring</b> can contribute to significant reductions in blood pressure, decreased all-cause and HF related hospitalisations, reduced all-cause mortality and improved quality of life. <b>Telemonitoring</b> was also demonstrated to reduce health care costs and appears acceptable to patients. Conclusion <b>Telemonitoring</b> has the potential to enhance primary care management of CVD by improving patient outcomes and reducing health costs.
