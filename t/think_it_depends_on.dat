Although some articles wrote that Ren used his photographs to cultural jamming traditional misunderstood which treated the nudity as a shame, Ren didn't believe he was challenging the stereotype and leading a revolution.For Ren, nudity and sexuality are natural themes which he shot in his works."Nudes are there since always. We were born nude. So talking about revolution, I don't think there's anything to revolutionize. Unless people are born with clothes on, and I want to take their clothes off, then I {{think this is a}} revolution. If it was already like that, then it's not a revolution. I just photographed things on their more natural conditions."Ren said he was not trying to liberate nudity and sexuality since he believed that Chinese young generation was open-minded and less affected by the old-fashioned cultures. When Hang talked about the question whether the topic of sexuality was still a taboo in China, Ren said:"I don't think it's related to our times, these are individual cases. Like how to say it, I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> different people, it doesn't really relate to other things.

30|$|Additionally, all student {{participants}} expressed {{support for}} providing extended time for all students. The authors shared the concept of Universal Design for Assessment (UDA) with the students, and received primarily positive feedback from the focus group. Jordan echoed the group’s sentiments saying, “You know, {{if it was just}} given to everybody, you wouldn’t have to go through, like {{you have to go to}} the doctor and pay for the doctor’s visit. And then we talked about how it is an issue for international students…It should be an option for everybody.” Fellow students Emerson and Taylor agreed, “I think it’s beneficial for everyone. Like, even if they don’t use it, just like that extra cushion is nice to have.” “It’s good for everyone, as long as nobody abuses it, and uses it wisely, I don’t see a downfall.” Two of the students shared some concern about making extended time available to everyone. Jacob stated, “I think it should be circumstantial,” and Amari suggested, “I do <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> the person.” UDA carries significant implications on testing within secondary and postsecondary environments. The feedback from this focus group, however, suggests that students would be open to the idea of providing extended time to all students, and many would welcome the opportunity to have the option of extended time without having to go through the challenging application process. These findings confirm those cited in previous research on accommodations (Elliott and Marquart 2004; Lewandowski et al. 2014; Lovett and Leja 2013).|$|E

Nonetheless, mental processes are, in our view, the essence and the engine of creative endeavors. Although there are many useful and productive ap-proaches to understanding creativity, the creative cognition approach (Finke, Ward, and Smith 1992) focuses on the cognitive processes and structures that underlie creative thinking. This book unites the theo-retical ideas and research findings of cognitive scientists who have studied various aspects of creative cognition. One basic goal of the creative cognition approach is to improve understanding of creative processes by using the methods and con-cepts of cognitive science. Most of the contributors to this book would agree, however, {{that there is no}} single process that we can identify as the creative process. Instead, creative thinking encompasses special combinations and patterns of the same cognitive processes seen in other noncreative endeavors. A second goal of the creative cognition approach is to learn more and raise new questions about cognition by examining it in creative contexts. For example, research on how creative thinking is inhibited or blocked may stimulate new ideas about how noncreative thinking is inhibited. The creative use of categories may yield insights about the way categories in general are represented. Theoretical models for inducing new ideas may have implications for models of text compre-hension. Just as ecological approaches have uncovered important properties of cognition by examining it in naturalistic contexts (Neisser 1982), so, too, does a creative cognition approach suggest new ideas about cognition by placing it in a creative context. The creative cognition approach has roots in associationism (Thorn...|$|R
40|$|Aim of the study. To {{analyze the}} impact of the factors {{influencing}} the mode of life on student resiliency. Methods. This work was carried out by analyzing scientific references. The anonymous questionnaire was also used to carry out the survey. The data received was processed using the statistics processing program SPSS 13. 0 for windows. Results. The questionnaire survey of the first year full time students of Kaunas College was carried out. The survey included 382 students (129 male and 253 female). The received data showed that 34. 8 % of students think that resiliency <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> the influence of other people, 27. 8 % of students <b>think</b> that <b>it</b> <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> the environment and 16. 5 % identified that resiliency <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> personal characteristics. In order to regain resiliency the respondents usually use passive methods such as watching TV, listening to the music, communicating with friends. The majority of the respondents (66. 7 % male and 75. 9 % female) indicated that they either often or very often feel tired. After the analysis of the results the statistically valid connection between the experienced tiredness and nutritional habits, time allocated for sleeping, rest and entertainment has been observed (p< 0. 05). While assessing the psychological feelings of students in the learning environment we observed that 53. 4 % of students often feel peer support, 60 % of students are successful in solving conflicts. However, the respondents having lower inner resiliency feel that the work load is extremely hard for them (p< 1. 15). Female compared to male are characterized by lower inner resiliency (p= 0. 003 < 0. 005). Conclusions. After analyzing the received date we may conclude that the factors influencing the mode of living {{have an impact on the}} student resiliency.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} how the interviewed people feel about being described in portrait interviews and how exactly it matches with their own image of the interview. The main issues were: Do they recognize themselves in the published article? If they don’t, what do they <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>depends</b> <b>on?</b> If they had the opportunity to read the article text before publishing, to what extent were they allowed to make changes to the text? Do the interviewees trust the local papers? This report involves a qualitative study on portrait interviews from the local newspaper Barometern. The articles were selected between June and November this year. The criteria for the selection of articles were that it was to deal with a single person and there be one photograph of this person in the article as well. The last criterion was that the text comprise at least 2000 characters. Personal interviews were undertaken with the people who had been portraited. In total 12 persons were interviewed. The study shows that interviewed people were overall pleased with the article and the way they had been presented. About half of the interviewed persons read the article before publishing and most of them were free to make changes to the text, though there were a few that weren´t allowed this opportunity. If there had been some things wrong in the articles most of them were about factual errors. Peoples’ trust in local journalists were greater than in journalists in larger cities, which was assumed, but most of the people had a certain scepticism when it came to trust in media in general. ...|$|E
40|$|Water {{rights in}} the Sahara Desert? CUE: What {{does it mean to}} have the right to water? Can a {{statement}} on water rights in a constitution achieve anything? And is it meaningful to tell people living in a dry area that they have a right to, for example, 20 litres of water per day, when that water may simply not exist? Virginia Roaf works for WaterAid, an international NGO that aims to improve the access of poor people to water and sanitation. Mike Davison went to the WaterAid office in London, and started by asking how useful she thought it was to give someone a right to water. IN: 		?The question of the right? OUT:		?coming from the local communities? DUR?N	 5 ? 08 BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Virginia Roaf of WaterAid describing some of the key issues raised by the right to water. Transcript Roaf	The question of the right to water is actually not as simple as it sounds. Everyone would agree that the right to water is a good right, it should be in the UN Declaration of Human Rights. But you also have to look at what is meant by the right to water, how much water, for whom, how clean is that water going to be? One of the problems of introducing a right to water is setting the standards that go with that. For example they might decide that everyone has a right to 20 litres per person per day. Now that?s obviously not going to be accessible to those people living in villages in rural areas, in the middle of the Sahara Desert for example, because that water is just not accessible; there isn?t that water in the ground. So setting a right to water which has unrealistic standards, you may actually find that the right to water works against the needs of the poorest. Maybe I can explain this best by looking at the right to housing. In South Africa the right to housing is enshrined in the constitution but along with that right to housing is also a long list of standards that are required to be met by that housing. For example they are to do with what the walls are to be made of, what the roof is to be made of. Now that?s obviously unaffordable to the poor who are presently living in shacks and in over crowded conditions. So while it?s a very good thing for the right to housing to be enshrined in the constitution it?s actually not accessible. Davison	So having that right to housing you would say is meaningless? Roaf	I think often it can be meaningless unless you?ve got a government that?s committed to creating the framework or the policies that will actually be able to deliver that housing. Davison	And if we were to carry that on to the example of the village in the Sahara Desert having a right to water, would you regard it in the same way? Roaf	Yes, I would say that rather than setting the standards for the right to water here in Britain or through the UN, I think it?s important to include local communities from poor areas, from developing countries, to ensure that the standards are not inaccessible. Davison	Do you think that if a country adds a statement on the right to water to its constitution, that is likely to help the poorer people who currently don?t have access to water? Roaf	I think that in some cases that will strengthen the poor community?s hand. I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> whether the poor community is well organised and whether they know that they have the right to water. I think however that generally these rights that stand in the constitution become just words on a piece of paper and that they are actually more likely to protect the rights of the middle income people or the people in power than they are to protect the rights of the poor. Davison	Can you explain what you mean by that? Roaf	In Dhaka in Bangladesh a vast proportion of the population live in illegal settlements which they don?t have the rights to. It could be because it?s along the river bank or it?s on pavements or it?s on land which is ear-marked for other purposes, and the government is not willing to give land rights. There?s a community in an area called Tejganj where the people are living on a pavement adjacent to the factory where they are working. And they?ve been living there for maybe 25 or 30 years without access to adequate water and sanitation and the reason for that is the government is not prepared to provide water and sanitation to that community because they lack land title. So what WaterAid has done is actually to work with the community and they have negotiated with the local council, for the local council to give the community a 5 year, a short term lease, which will then allow the municipal supplier to actually provide water and sanitation. Interestingly this has caused a problem with the middle income community which lives opposite. The middle class community has decided that this is a threat to them and persuaded the local municipality to evict the community. Within a week the community were back living in that area because they had nowhere else to go. So they are actually now living in that area again and they are still obviously working in the factory. Davison	So that suggests that often when you get water rights you may well have a situation of conflict between two different groups? Roaf	There?s always going to be conflict over resources which are limited. The water supply in Dhaka probably reaches maybe 25 % of the population but obviously that?s going to be going to the richer parts of that community. And so if the middle class community see that the water is now being accessed by poorer communities obviously there?s going to be less water to go around. Davison	To me water rights would seem to be quite a western concept. To what extent do you think that the communities that WaterAid is working with feel that they have a right to water? Roaf	I think that the people living in Dhaka in Bangladesh through the work that they?ve been doing in accessing their right to land has actually introduced ideas of rights of water to those communities. Davison	So the increasing awareness of water rights has come through increasing awareness and interest in land rights? Roaf	I would say that there is more interest now in water rights, yes, because there?s been interest in land rights and the demand is coming from the local communities. End of tape.

6000|$|Nor, if we would, {{can we get}} rid of this conviction. We have at {{all times}} some instinctive sense that the {{function}} of one painter is greater than that of another, even supposing each equally successful in his own way; and we feel that, if it were possible to conquer prejudice, and do away with the iniquities of personal feeling, and the insufficiencies of limited knowledge, we should all agree in this estimate, and be able to place each painter in his right rank, measuring them by a true scale of nobleness. We feel that the men in the higher classes of the scale would be, in the full sense of the word, Great--men whom one would give much to see the faces of but for an instant; and that those in the lower classes of the scale (though none were admitted but who had true merit of some kind) would be very small men, not greatly exciting either reverence or curiosity. And with this fixed instinct in our minds, we permit our teachers daily to exhort their pupils to the cultivation of [...] "great art"--neither they nor we having any very clear notion as to what the greatness consists in: but sometimes inclining to <b>think</b> <b>it</b> must <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> the space of the canvas, and that art on a scale of 6 feet by 10 is something spiritually separated from that on a scale of 3 feet by 5;--sometimes holding it to consist in painting the nude body, rather than the body decently clothed;--sometimes being convinced that it is connected with the study of past history, and that the art is only great which represents what the painter never saw, and about which he knows nothing;-and sometimes being firmly persuaded that it consists in generally finding fault with, and endeavoring to mend, whatsoever the Divine Wisdom has made. All which various errors, having yet some motes and atoms of truth in the make of each of them, deserve some attentive analysis, for they come under that general law,--that [...] "the corruption of the best is the worst." [...] There are not worse errors going than these four; and yet the truth they contain, and the instinct which urges many to preach them, are at the root of all healthy growth in art. We ruin one young painter after another by telling him to follow great art, without knowing, ourselves, what greatness is; and yet the feeling that it verily is something, and that there are depths and breadths, shallows and narrows, in the matter, is all that we have to look to, if we would ever make our art serviceable to ourselves or others. To follow art for the sake of being a great man, and therefore to cast about continually for some means of achieving position or attracting admiration, is the surest way of ending in total extinction. And yet it is only by honest reverence for art itself, and by great self-respect in the practice of it, that it can be rescued from dilettantism, raised to approved honorableness, and brought to the proper work it has to accomplish in the service of man.|$|R
40|$|The {{advancement}} in the CATV {{industry has been}} remarkable. In the beginning, CATV provided a few television channels. Now it provides a variety of advanced services such as video on demand (VOD), Internet access, Pay-Per-View on demand and interactive TV. These advances have increased the popularity of CATV manyfold. Current improvements focus on interactive services with high quality. These interactive services require more upstream (transmission from customer premises to cable operator premises) channel bandwidth. The flow of data through the CATV network in both the upstream and downstream directions is governed by a standard {{referred to as the}} Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification (DOCSIS) standard. The latest version is DOCSIS 3. 1, which was released in January 2014. The previous version, DOCSIS 3. 0, was released in 2006. One component of the upstream communication link is the QAM demodulator. An important component in the QAM demodulator is the equalizer, whose purpose is to remove distortion caused by the imperfect upstream channel as well as the residual timing offset and frequency offset. Most of the timing and frequency offset are corrected by timing and frequency recovery circuits; what remains is referred to as offset. A DOCSIS receiver, and hence the equalizer within, can be implemented with ASIC or FPGA technology. Implementing an equalizer in an ASIC has a large nonrecurring engineering cost, but relatively small per chip production cost. Implementing equalizer in an FPGA has very low non-recurring cost, but a relatively high per chip cost. If the choice technology was based on cost, one would <b>think</b> <b>it</b> would <b>depends</b> only <b>on</b> the volume, but in practice that is not the case. The dominant factor when it comes to profit, is the time-to-market, which makes FPGA technology the only choice. The goal of this thesis is to design a cost optimized equalizer for DOCSIS upstream demodulator and implement in an FPGA. With this in mind, an important objective is to establish a relationship between the equalizer’s critical parameters and its performance. The parameter-performance relationship that has been established in this study revealed that equalizer step size and length parameters should be 1 / 64 and approximately 20 to yield a near optimum equalizer when considering the MER-convergence time trade-off. In the pursuit of the objective another relationship was established that is useful in determining the accuracy of the timing recovery circuit. That relationship establishes the sensitivity both of the MER and convergence time to timing offset. The equalizer algorithm was implemented in a cost effective manner using DSP Builder. The effort to minimize cost was focused on minimizing the number of multipliers. It is shown that the equalizer can be constructed with 8 multipliers when the proposed time sharing algorithm is implemented...|$|R
