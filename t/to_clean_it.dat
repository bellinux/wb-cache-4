5|$|On {{the fourth}} orbit, {{drifting}} in an inverted spacecraft with the Earth 'above' him, Schirra continued his photography and attempted—unsuccessfully—to spot the Echo 1 satellite while passing over East Africa. As he approached California, he spoke briefly to John Glenn in a two-minute conversation broadcast live across the United States {{on radio and}} television. Problems began to recur with the pressure suit, with water condensing on the faceplate; Schirra, concerned about the internal temperature, avoided opening the visor <b>to</b> <b>clean</b> <b>it</b> for fear that the suit temperature would misbehave again.|$|E
5|$|Da Matta, Andretti, and Franchitti contended {{for third}} {{position}} until the field closed {{up because of}} the presence of slower cars. The third caution was shown fourteen laps later when Adrián Fernández lost engine power driving into the second turn, and he went to the bottom of the track on the backstretch to retire. Oil was laid on the track heading into turn two, and marshals were required <b>to</b> <b>clean</b> <b>it.</b> It was announced on lap 90 that Kniefel had reduced the number of laps to be run from 168 to 140 because of the danger from fading sunlight. All of the leaders (including Bräck) chose to make pit stops for fuel and tyres under caution on lap 100. Castroneves passed da Matta and Andretti around the inside in the pit lane and Newman/Haas Racing believed he had committed an infraction. The team informed CART of Castroneves' passing, which was observed by their co-owner Paul Newman.|$|E
5|$|In August 1939 Cunningham rejoined his {{squadron}} {{which had}} been equipped with {{a version of the}} Bristol Blenheim. John was not enthusiastic about flying the Blenheim. The turret had been eliminated to reduce weight and increase speed, but the flying suits and cockpit were not heated, which caused discomfort to the crews over the winter period. The radios were too short-range which caused communication problems. The Blenheim's cockpit windshield was multi-faceted and difficult <b>to</b> <b>clean.</b> <b>It</b> was also liable to reflect light; which made cooperation with searchlights hazardous. The unit also had unspecified problems with blind-flying instruments. The squadron incurred some losses owing to the inexperience of crews flying patrols over the North Sea from RAF North Weald in Essex, a number of them a result of the difficulties with the aircraft. In January 1940 604 moved to RAF Northolt and flew Blenheim's adorned in the Finnish Air Force Swastika to Finland via Sweden to assist the country after the Soviet invasion.|$|E

5|$|West Nohno {{had made}} her way to Hampton Roads, Virginia, by 29 May, when she sailed for Key West, Florida. After her 4 June arrival at Key West, she began a nine-month journey to Alexandria, Cairo, and other ports. During this {{extended}} voyage, three crewmen entered one of West Nohnos fuel tanks <b>to</b> <b>clean</b> <b>it</b> while the ship was at Suez on 29 September 1942. The crewmen did not use gas masks and were soon overcome by fumes. The second mate of the Norwegian tanker Britannia, Henning Vaagsnes, entered the tank and removed all three men. Two of West Nohnos men survived but the third, despite two hours of attempts to revive him by Vaagsnes, did not. For his efforts, Vaagsnes received a pair of binoculars from U.S. president Franklin D. Roosevelt and a gold watch from the ship owners. He was also awarded St. Olav's medal with Oak Branch, a medal awarded for personal courage and bravery by the Norwegian government.|$|E

When they find {{themselves}} unable <b>to</b> <b>clean</b> <b>it,</b> Leslie calls Maria Portlesman (Bonita Friedericy), who teaches cleaning courses at the recreation center. She declines payment and hints she would prefer preferential treatment when Leslie cuts the classes, despite Leslie's assurance this will not happen. When Leslie realizes she has not prepared any food for the party, she calls a culinary teacher from the recreation center. Later, at the party, Andy complains about Justin to April (Aubrey Plaza), who makes Andy happy when she proposes putting chewed up gum in Justin's pockets. Eventually, Tom's ex-wife Wendy (Jama Williamson) arrives. Tom expresses anger that Leslie invited her, especially because Ron is romantically interested in her. When Ron impresses Wendy by eating a hot red pepper, Tom attempts to eat a bigger one, but has {{to run to the}} bathroom in pain immediately. When Justin starts yawning, a worried Leslie calls in other recreation center teachers to make the party more interesting, including a belly-dancer, a fencer, a cartoonist and an origami teacher.|$|E

25|$|As a pilot project, the Trillium Line {{system was}} {{built at the}} cost of $21 million, {{relatively}} little compared with {{the hundreds of millions of}} dollars usually required to build a new transit line. It runs on an existing Canadian Pacific Railway track (Ellwood and Prescott subdivisions,) so the only construction work necessary was to build the stations themselves and the passing tracks necessary to allow trains to operate in both directions. The downside to this, however, is that much ground pollution remains from the track’s previous use. This will become a liability one day when the city has to pay <b>to</b> <b>clean</b> <b>it</b> up, which it has thus far avoided by not digging into the ground under the tracks.|$|E

From the newspaper, James had just learned that gang member Dick Liddil had confessed to participating in Wood Hite's murder. He was suspicious that the Fords had not told him about it. Robert Ford later said he believed that James had realized they were there to betray him. Instead of confronting them, James walked across the living room and laid his revolvers on a sofa. He turned around and noticed a dusty picture above the mantle, and stood on a chair <b>to</b> <b>clean</b> <b>it.</b> Robert Ford drew his weapon, and shot the unarmed Jesse James {{in the back of the}} head.|$|E
25|$|The New York Iron and Coal Company {{created the}} first {{business}} venture in {{what was to become}} McIntyre Township in when they constructed a sawmill on Lycoming Creek. The New York Iron and Coal Company also built an iron furnace near the mouth of Frozen Run in 1831. They began to make iron using iron ore that was mined nearby. The company also established a charcoal making operation for the fuel that was needed to keep the furnaces fired. The iron industry had little success in McIntyre. The ore was difficult <b>to</b> <b>clean,</b> <b>it</b> could only be separated from the dirt that was mixed in when it was frozen. And the ore that they did manage to extract produced iron that proved to be very brittle. The reason that several companies attempted to succeed in what proved to be a failing enterprise {{was the fact that the}} furnace was within easy distance of the Williamsport and Elmira Railroad which connected the industrial centers of Williamsport, Pennsylvania and Elmira, New York.|$|E

Other scenes cut out explained that the teenage Kirk stole his stepfather's antique car because he had forced him <b>to</b> <b>clean</b> <b>it</b> before an auction; and that the Orion he seduced at the Academy worked in the operations division.

500|$|The Los Angeles Illustrated Daily News {{was founded}} in 1923 by Cornelius Vanderbilt IV, who wished {{to start his own}} {{newspaper}} chain. The young Vanderbilt had served as a news reporter in New York for four years, but had no experience running a paper.

[...] Repudiating the legendary adage of William Henry Vanderbilt, [...] "The public be damned," [...] Vanderbilt announced that the paper's philosophy would be [...] "The public be served." [...] Vanderbilt ignored attempts by the newspaper moguls who dominated Los Angeles journalism, William Randolph Hearst and Harry Chandler, to warn him off. Denied advertising in other newspapers, Vanderbilt attempted to gain publicity for his paper by having trucks drive through the streets bearing the paper's banner, and [...] hiring boys to chalk the paper's name on sidewalks, much to the annoyance of landowners who had <b>to</b> <b>clean</b> <b>it</b> up.|$|E

On the way, Marlborough and Fearless encountered the British submarines [...] and the two submarines prepared to attack the ships but fortunately recognised them before they launched torpedoes. By 15:00, eight destroyers from the Harwich Force had joined Marlborough and another pump had been lowered into the flooded boiler room. At around 23:30, the pump was being moved <b>to</b> <b>clean</b> <b>it</b> when the roll of the ship threw the pump into the damaged bulkhead, knocking the shores loose. Water flooded into the ship and Marlboroughs captain ordered Fearless and the destroyers to prepare to come alongside, to rescue the crew if the flooding worsened at 00:47 on 2 June.
