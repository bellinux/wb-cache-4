5|$|Aside {{from his}} {{opposition}} <b>to</b> <b>slavery,</b> Garrard {{did not take}} a particularly {{active role in the}} convention's proceedings. His most notable action not related <b>to</b> <b>slavery</b> occurred on April 13, 1792, when he reported twenty-two resolutions from the committee of the whole that provided the framework for the new constitution.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of Greek slaves {{was a constant}} source of discomfort for free Greeks. The enslavement of cities was also a controversial practice. Some generals refused, such as the Spartans Agesilaus II and Callicratidas. Some cities passed accords to forbid the practice: {{in the middle of the}} 3rd century BC, Miletus agreed not to reduce any free Knossian <b>to</b> <b>slavery,</b> and vice versa. Conversely, the emancipation by ransom of a city that had been entirely reduced <b>to</b> <b>slavery</b> carried great prestige: Cassander, in 316 BC, restored Thebes. Before him, Philip II of Macedon enslaved and then emancipated Stageira.|$|E
5|$|By {{the rules}} of war of the period, the victor possessed {{absolute}} rights over the vanquished, whether they were soldiers or not. Enslavement, while not systematic, was common practice. Thucydides recalls that 7,000 inhabitants of Hyccara in Sicily were taken prisoner by Nicias and sold for 120 talents in the neighbouring village of Catania. Likewise in 348 BC the population of Olynthus was reduced <b>to</b> <b>slavery,</b> as was that of Thebes in 335 BC by Alexander the Great and that of Mantineia by the Achaean League.|$|E
50|$|The French {{colony of}} Saint-Domingue {{was one of}} the first American jurisdictions <b>to</b> end <b>slavery,</b> in 1794. Brazil was last nation in the Western Hemisphere <b>to</b> end <b>slavery,</b> in 1888.|$|R

5|$|By {{the time}} Harriet Beecher Stowe (1811â€“1896) moved to Florida in 1867, {{she was already}} internationally famous for {{authoring}} Uncle Tom's Cabin, published as a serial between 1851 and 1852. The novel expounded upon her abolitionist views and was extraordinarily influential in condemning slavery in the United States. Stowe's opposition <b>to</b> <b>slavery</b> sprang from a moral passion based on her Christian faith. She had grown up {{the daughter of a}} Presbyterian minister, Lyman Beecher; seven of her brothers became ministers in Calvinist or Congregational denominations, and she married a minister.|$|E
5|$|First, he shunned the states' rights viewpoint, {{stressing}} {{instead the}} need for a strong interdependence between the states. Second, he called for an end <b>to</b> <b>slavery.</b> Third, he emphasized the importance of education. Though they agreed on this last point, Breckinridge's father had ardently opposed emancipation of slaves and favored states' rights. Historian James C. Klotter opines that Louis Marshall and Robert's mother Mary may have influenced his positions.|$|E
5|$|Igbo Landing (alternatively {{written as}} Ibo Landing, Ebo Landing, or Ebos Landing) is a {{historic}} site at Dunbar Creek on St. Simons Island, Glynn County, Georgia. It was the setting of a mass suicide in 1803 by captive Igbo people who had taken control of their slave ship and refused to submit <b>to</b> <b>slavery</b> in the United States. The event's moral value as a story of resistance towards slavery has symbolic importance in African American folklore and literary history.|$|E
5000|$|With {{the defeat}} of the Confederacy {{at the hands of the}} Union in the American Civil War, the Thirteenth Amendment was {{ratified}} <b>to</b> outlaw <b>slavery</b> throughout the United States.

500|$|The <b>Slavery</b> Commission sought <b>to</b> {{eradicate}} <b>slavery</b> and slave trading {{across the}} world, and fought forced prostitution. Its main success was through pressing the governments who administered mandated countries <b>to</b> end <b>slavery</b> in those countries. The League secured {{a commitment from}} Ethiopia <b>to</b> end <b>slavery</b> {{as a condition of}} membership in 1923, and worked with Liberia to abolish forced labour and intertribal slavery. The United Kingdom had not supported Ethiopian membership of the League on the grounds that [...] "Ethiopia had not reached a state of civilisation and internal security sufficient to warrant her admission." ...|$|R
50|$|Published in 1998, {{and written}} by Dave Stern and Steve Vance, the Big Book of Vice {{examines}} alcohol, drugs, tobacco, sex, and gambling. Subjects {{range from the}} history of tobacco, <b>to</b> sexual <b>slavery,</b> <b>to</b> pinball machines.|$|R
5|$|In December 1817, Edwards, {{responding}} to a movement for statehood led by his ally Daniel Pope Cook, recommended to the legislature that Illinois apply for admission to the Union. He also recommended that a census first be taken of the territory, a standard practice, but the legislature rejected this. Legislators, particularly those opposed <b>to</b> <b>slavery,</b> feared that any delay would allow Missouri to apply for statehood before Illinois, and that since Missouri was a slave state, this would cause so much turmoil in Congress that it would delay Illinois' admission even longer.|$|E
5|$|In early March 1781, Zong was {{purchased}} by the master of William, {{on behalf of a}} syndicate of Liverpool merchants. The members of the syndicate were Edward Wilson, George Case, James Aspinall and William, James and John Gregson. William Gregson had an interest in 50slaving voyages between 1747 and 1780. He served as mayor of Liverpool in 1762. By the end of his life, vessels in which Gregson had a financial stake had carried 58,201 Africans <b>to</b> <b>slavery</b> in the Americas.|$|E
5|$|King {{stated that}} black Americans, {{as well as}} other {{disadvantaged}} Americans, should be compensated for historical wrongs. In an interview conducted for Playboy in 1965, he said that granting black Americans only equality could not realistically close the economic gap between them and whites. King said that he did not seek a full restitution of wages lost <b>to</b> <b>slavery,</b> which he believed impossible, but proposed a government compensatory program of $50billion over ten years to all disadvantaged groups.|$|E
50|$|Abdel, {{now able}} to contextualize the {{circumstances}} which allow for <b>slavery</b> <b>to</b> be perpetuated in his country, began <b>to</b> denounce <b>slavery.</b> He trained himself to do the basics, everyday tasks which were once performed by his slaves.|$|R
50|$|At {{some point}} after 1785, Benjamin Franklin was elected as the organization's president. The society {{asked him to}} bring the matter of <b>slavery</b> <b>to</b> the Constitutional Convention of 1787. He petitioned the U.S Congress in 1790 <b>to</b> ban <b>slavery.</b>|$|R

5|$|Opposition <b>to</b> <b>slavery</b> {{began to}} {{organize}} in Indiana around 1805, and in 1809 abolitionists {{took control of}} the territorial legislature and overturned many of the laws permitting retaining of slaves. By the time Indiana was granted statehood in 1816, the abolitionists were in firm control and slavery was banned in the constitution. In 1820, an Supreme Court of Indiana ruling in Polly v. Lasselle freed all the remaining slaves in the state. An additional Supreme Court ruling in 1821 freed indentured servant Mary Bateman Clark, helping {{to bring an end to}} indentured servitude.|$|E
5|$|Although {{significant}} {{opposition to}} abolitionism existed {{early on in}} Massachusetts, resulting in anti-abolitionist riots between 1835 and 1837, opposition <b>to</b> <b>slavery</b> gradually increased throughout the next few decades. Abolitionists John Brown and Sojourner Truth lived in Springfield and Northampton, respectively, while Frederick Douglass lived in Boston and Susan B. Anthony in Adams, Massachusetts. The works of such abolitionists contributed to Massachusetts's actions during the Civil War. Massachusetts was {{the first state to}} recruit, train, and arm a Black regiment with White officers, the 54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment. In 1852, Massachusetts became the first state to pass compulsory education laws.|$|E
5|$|Born in North Carolina, Coffin {{was exposed}} to and {{developed}} an opposition <b>to</b> <b>slavery</b> as a child. He followed his family and immigrated to Indiana in 1826, following the slaveholders' persecution of Quakers. In Indiana he became a local business leader, merchant, and farmer. Coffin's accumulated wealth from his business interests allowed {{him to become a}} major investor in the Richmond, Indiana, branch of the Second State Bank of Indiana, where he served as director in the 1830s. Coffin's financial position and standing in the community also provided the mead to supply food, clothing, and transportation for the Underground Railroad operations in the region.|$|E

5|$|Bristol was a {{starting}} place for early voyages of exploration to the New World. On a ship out of Bristol in 1497 John Cabot, a Venetian, {{became the first}} European since the Vikings to land on mainland North America. In 1499 William Weston, a Bristol merchant, was the first Englishman to lead an exploration to North America. At {{the height of the}} Bristol slave trade, from 1700 to 1807, more than 2,000 slave ships carried an estimated 500,000 people from Africa <b>to</b> <b>slavery</b> in the Americas. The Port of Bristol has since moved from Bristol Harbour in the city centre to the Severn Estuary at Avonmouth and Royal Portbury Dock.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of Hamilton's early {{participation}} in the American Revolution, his abolitionist sensibilities had become evident. Hamilton was active during the Revolution in trying to raise black troops for the army, {{with the promise of}} freedom. In the 1780s and 1790s he generally opposed pro-slavery southern interests, which he saw as hypocritical to the values of the American Revolution. In 1785 he joined his close associate John Jay in founding the New-York Society for Promoting the Manumission of Slaves, and Protecting Such of Them as Have Been, or May be Liberated, the main anti-slavery organization in New York. The society successfully promoted the abolition of the international slave trade in New York City and (shortly after his death) passed a state law to end slavery in New York through a decades-long process of emancipation, with a final end <b>to</b> <b>slavery</b> in the state on July 4, 1827.|$|E
5|$|Greeley, in his paper, {{initially}} {{supported the}} Whig program. As divisions between Clay and President Tyler became apparent, {{he supported the}} Kentucky senator and looked to a Clay nomination for president in 1844. However, when Clay was nominated by the Whigs, he was defeated by the Democrat, former Tennessee governor James K. Polk, though Greeley worked hard on Clay's behalf. Greeley had taken positions in opposition <b>to</b> <b>slavery</b> as editor of The New-Yorker in the late 1830s, opposing the annexation of the slaveholding Republic of Texas to the United States. In the 1840s, Greeley became an increasingly vocal opponent of the expansion of slavery.|$|E

5|$|In {{a speech}} at the Berlin Geographical Society in 1919, Detzner claimed that the natives of New Guinea had opposed Australian {{domination}} and resisted a military recruitment that amounted <b>to</b> <b>slavery,</b> that even the English plantation holders wished to remain independent of Australia, and that the natives were collecting money to build a war memorial for the Germans. The report on Detzner's speech, transmitted from a news agency in London, caused a small flutter in Australian government circles, but generally was dismissed; an earlier report by the Australian judiciary had absolved the Australian force of improper recruiting or treatment of the New Guineans. An angry letter to the editor from another Australian source, who claimed to have been in service in Morobe from 1914â€“1915, received little attention.|$|E
5|$|Lewis Wendell Willkie {{was born}} in Elwood, Indiana, on February 18, 1892, the son of Henrietta (Trisch) and Herman Francis Willkie. Both of his parents were lawyers, his mother {{being one of the}} first women {{admitted}} to the Indiana bar. His father {{was born in}} Germany and his mother was born in Indiana, to German parents; his grandparents were involved in the unsuccessful 1848 revolutions in Germany. The Trisches initially settled in Kansas Territory but, as they were abolitionists, moved to Indiana after the territory was opened <b>to</b> <b>slavery</b> in the mid-1850s. Willkie was the fourth of six children, all intelligent, and learned skills during the nightly debates around the dinner table that would later serve him well.|$|E
5|$|Periyar's {{philosophy}} of self-respect {{was based on}} his image of an ideal world and a universally accepted one. His philosophy preaches that human actions {{should be based on}} rational thinking. Further, the outcome of the natural instinct of human beings is to examine every object and every action and even nature with a spirit of inquiry, and to refuse to submit to anything irrational as equivalent <b>to</b> <b>slavery.</b> Thus, the {{philosophy of}} self-respect taught that human actions should be guided by reason, right and wrong should follow from rational thinking and conclusions drawn from reason should be respected under circumstances. Freedom means respect to thoughts and actions considered 'right' by human beings on the basis of 'reason'. There is not much difference between 'freedom' and 'self-respect'.|$|E

50|$|On June 19, 1862, Congress {{prohibited}} {{slavery in}} all {{current and future}} United States territories (though not in the states), and President Lincoln quickly signed the legislation. By this act, they repudiated the 1857 opinion of the Supreme Court of the United States in the Dred Scott Case that Congress was powerless <b>to</b> regulate <b>slavery</b> in U.S. territories.This joint action by Congress and President Lincoln also rejected the notion of popular sovereignty that had been advanced by Stephen A. Douglas as a solution <b>to</b> the <b>slavery</b> controversy, while completing the effort first legislatively proposed by Thomas Jefferson in 1784 <b>to</b> confine <b>slavery</b> within the borders of existing states.|$|R
