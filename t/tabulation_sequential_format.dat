40|$|The paper {{reports on}} the effects of one-sided {{imperfect}} information on bidding behaviour in simultaneous and sequential first-price auctions of non-identical objects when bidders have multi-unit demands. The analysis provides the following four main results. First, when different objects are to be sold in sequence, the seller maximises her expected revenues by selling the most valuable object first. Second, the more the objects are different and the more the <b>sequential</b> <b>format</b> favours the informed bidder. Third, by switching the order of sales, the seller may want to change her initial preference for a simultaneous format (in which bidders submit object-specific bids) to one for a <b>sequential</b> <b>format.</b> Fourth, <b>sequential</b> auctions are mostly preferred by the seller when the objects are likely to be of low value and the precision of the informed bidder’s signal is low...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2014 Millions {{of people}} in {{developing}} countries die from infectious diseases (e. g. malaria), yet many of these deaths can be prevented if given the tools for accurate diagnosis. Current diagnostic capabilities with the required clinical sensitivity are confined to laboratory settings due to cost, electrical, and personnel requirements. Current POC diagnostics targeting infectious diseases in low resource settings, lateral flow tests (LFTs), have the appropriate usability, but are confined to a single chemical step, {{and as a result}} lack the required sensitivity for clinical utility. A two-dimensional paper network (2 DPN) is an inexpensive new technology based on the strengths of LFTs but allows complex chemical processes to be performed. Fluid control tools are essential for the success of a 2 DPN in carrying out complex chemical processes in an automated fashion. Three versions of a 2 DPN-based amplified assay in a malaria detection system are demonstrated using three fluid control tools: paper network geometry, dissolvable sucrose barriers, and cellulose-based delay shunts. Using the same system, assays based on two delivery <b>formats,</b> <b>sequential</b> delivery of analyte and colorimetric label and premixed one step delivery were characterized for reproducibility, sensitivity, and time to result. The <b>sequential</b> delivery <b>format</b> offers the potential for higher sensitivity detection compared to the premix delivery format used by conventional LFTs, but at the expense of additional time to result. Next steps for implementation of a high-sensitivity 2 DPN using the <b>sequential</b> <b>format</b> are discussed...|$|R

The first effect relates to the cartel’s ability to identify and punish defectors within the sequence, thus lowering the gains from a deviation {{with respect to a}} simultaneous format. The second effect concerns the cartel’s ability to allocate the bidder with the highest incentive to deviate (the ‘maverick’) to the last object of the sequence, thus increasing the viability of the collu-sive agreement.

40|$|The {{production}} of hematopoietic cells {{is under the}} tight control {{of a group of}} hematopoietic cytokines. Each cytokine has multiple actions mediated by receptors whose cytoplasmic domains contain specialized regions initiating the various responses—survival, proliferation, differentiation commitment, maturation, and functional activation. Individual cytokines can be lineage specific or can regulate cells in multiple lineages, and for some cell types, such as stem cells or megakaryocyte progenitors, the simultaneous action of multiple cytokines is required for proliferative responses. The same cytokines control basal and emergency hematopoietic cell proliferation. Three cytokines, erythropoietin, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, have now been in routine clinical use to stimulate cell production and in total have been used in the management of many millions of patients.

There are many interesting datasets in this format coming from various domains including parallel textual corpora, duplicate bug reports, and other pairs of related sequences of events. Our goal is to mine a set of closed discriminative dyadic sequential patterns from a database of sequence pairs each belonging to one of the two classes +ve and -ve. These dyadic sequential patterns characterize the discriminating facets contrasting the two classes. They are potentially good features to be used for the classification of dyadic sequential data. They can be used to characterize and flag correct and incorrect translations from parallel textual corpora, automate the manual and time consuming duplicate bug report detection process, etc. We provide a solution of this new problem by proposing new search space traversal strategy, projected database structure, pruning properties, and novel mining algorithms. To demonstrate the scalability and utility of our solution, we have experimented with both synthetic and real datasets. Experiment results show that our solution is scalable.

Streaming of the MV representation format can be performed in several different ways. The basic way of streaming the MV video is to stream each view individually. A second streaming option is to perform some kind of merging of views, such as sequential (S) merging or aggregation by combining (C). With sequential merging, frames from different views are used to form one sequence in the following order: first view 1 of frame 1, followed by view 2 of frame 1,…, followed by view V of frame 1, followed by view 1 of frame 2 … We also name this signal as the CV.

40|$|Wrongful {{conviction}} {{of the innocent}} is likely the most egregious error that occurs {{in the criminal justice}} system. Yet, through the recent advent of DNA testing, exonera-tions of the innocent are increasing at a rate that few {{in the criminal justice system}} would have predicted (Scheck & Neufeld, 2001). Studies in which cases involving wrongful conviction have been examined have consis-tently indicated that mistaken eyewitness identification evidence is the leading contributing factor (Huff, Rattner, & Sagarin, 1996; Scheck, Neufeld, & Dwyer, 2000). However, findings that mistaken eyewitness identifica-tions frequently lead to wrongful conviction come as no surprise to psychologists who study eyewitness memory (Wells & Olson, 2003). Over the past 20 years, eyewit-ness researchers have pursued various procedures that might reduce such mistaken identifications in everyday practice. A much heralded procedural innovation in eyewitness identification was suggested by Lindsay and Wells (1985) and subsequently investigated by Lindsay and colleagues in more than a dozen studies (see Lindsay, 1999). These researchers proposed that the lineup procedure typically used by law enforcement, in which all photographs are presented to the witness at the same time in a simultaneous format, may lead to increased false positive choices as a result of a particular face’s being selected on the basis of that individual’s familiarity relative to that of others in the lineup. They recommended that an alternative procedure might reduce this reliance upon relative judgments— namely, presenting photographs to the witness one at a time in a <b>sequential</b> <b>format.</b> Lindsay and Wells proposed that such a procedure would encourage the use of what they termed “absolute judgments, ” based largely on eval-uating each face individually.
