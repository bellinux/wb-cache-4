5|$|Due {{to local}} {{conditions}} it was sometimes {{necessary for the}} Commission <b>to</b> <b>deviate</b> <b>from</b> its standard design. In places prone to extreme weather or earthquakes, such as Thailand and Turkey, stone-faced pedestal markers are used instead of the normal headstones. These measures are intended to prevent masonry being damaged during earthquakes or sinking into sodden ground. In Italy, headstones were carved from Chiampo Perla limestone {{because it was in}} more plentiful supply. In Struma Military Cemetery, in Greece, to avoid risk of earthquake damage, small headstones are laid flush to the ground. Due to their smaller size, the markers often lack unit insignia.|$|E
5|$|Four {{people were}} killed in the Philippines by Koni, and an {{additional}} person was injured. Damage reports from the Philippines remained scarce, though the PAGASA indicated that damage costs totaled 67.250million Philippine pesos (US$1.26million). On July18, an Airbus A330-242 carrying 242passengers bound for Hong Kong encountered Koni in the South China Sea and attempted <b>to</b> <b>deviate</b> <b>from</b> its planned trajectory in order to avoid severe weather. However, the plane inadvertently encountered an area of severe turbulence, resulting in three minor injuries on board. The plane was later able to exit the area of turbulence and land safely at Hong Kong International Airport.|$|E
5|$|Fourth, camber thrust {{contributes}} to the centripetal force necessary to cause the bike <b>to</b> <b>deviate</b> <b>from</b> a straight path, along with cornering force due to the slip angle, and can be the largest contributor. Camber thrust {{contributes to}} the ability of bikes to negotiate a turn with the same radius as automobiles but with a smaller steering angle. When a bike is steered and leaned in the same direction, the camber angle of the front tire is greater than that of the rear and so can generate more camber thrust, all else being equal.|$|E

5|$|In 1889, Miloš's {{descendant}} King Alexander visited Jovanović at his Vienna {{studio and}} requested {{a painting of}} the revolt to commemorate its 75th anniversary. With his rise in stature, the artist had found himself producing numerous replicas of his earlier Orientalist works. According to biographer Nikola Kusovac, Jovanović grew bored with painting replicas and considered taking up a different genre. Alexander's request presented Jovanović with an opportunity <b>to</b> <b>deviate</b> <b>from</b> Orientalism and try his hand at history painting. The Takovo Uprising was his first historical composition.|$|E
5|$|NY9M {{began at}} an {{intersection}} with NY8 (now CR53) {{north of the}} hamlet of Starbuckville {{in the town of}} Horicon. The route followed Valentine Pond Road north for a negligible distance, then progressed westward along the eastern bank of the Schroon River on East Schroon River Road. Across the river, Carl Turner Road, a locally maintained highway, followed a routing parallel to that of NY9M on the other shore. Both roads gradually curved northward, mirroring a similar turn in the river's course. Carl Turner Road came to an end here; however, NY9M continued on. Near a junction with modern-day Short Street, NY9M began <b>to</b> <b>deviate</b> <b>from</b> the river.|$|E
5|$|Past I-190, NY104 begins <b>to</b> <b>deviate</b> <b>from</b> the Niagara River. It heads {{through a}} small {{neighborhood}} situated between the Moses Parkway and NY104 and intersects {{the northern end of}} NY265. North of this junction, NY104 curves northeast to descend the Niagara Escarpment. As it heads downward in elevation, it intersects the western terminus of NY18 by way of an interchange. As part of the same exit, NY104 meets the parkway one more time as well as the southern terminus of NY18F near the village of Lewiston. Here, the Seaway Trail leaves NY104 to follow NY18F. East of the exit, NY104 intersects NY18 again by way of another interchange.|$|E

5|$|Series creator David Wolstencroft {{believed}} that writing Tom {{was the most}} fun, yet the hardest work compared with other characters, because he was Spooks primary protagonist. Wolstencroft chose a job in Information Technology (IT) as the cover story Tom used in his relationship with Ellie, because he felt that in real life people are reluctant {{to ask questions about}} IT work. To portray the character, actor Matthew Macfadyen followed the scripts, and did not want <b>to</b> <b>deviate</b> <b>from</b> them, as he did not believe doing so would be useful. Macfadyen was also keen to explore parts of Tom from within him for influence.|$|E
5|$|Across {{the county}} line in Lake Luzerne, NY9N begins <b>to</b> <b>deviate</b> <b>from</b> the Hudson River, {{gradually}} curving {{to the northeast}} as it passes through the hamlets of Lake Luzerne, Fourth Lake, and Lake Vanare, {{all of which are}} named for small lakes bearing those names {{near the center of the}} communities. Just northeast of Lake Vanare, NY9N enters the town of Lake George, where it connects to I-87 (the Adirondack Northway) at exit21 and meets US9. Here, it joins its parent route northward toward the village of Lake George. The conjoined routes intersect the northern end of NY9L just south of the village line before becoming Canada Street and entering the village limits upon crossing over West Brook. US9 and NY9N serve as the primary north–south thoroughfare through the village before splitting at the north end of the village. While US9 continues to the north, NY9N heads northeast along the western edge of Lake George.|$|E
5|$|By the 2005–06 season, {{clubs in}} England were {{increasingly}} {{in favour of}} using the 4–5–1 system. Wenger, having earlier suggested he would never resort to a negative system, later adopted the formation for Champions League matches. The decision to pack the midfield and play a lone striker resulted in Arsenal reaching the final. With Fábregas breaking into the first team, Wenger chose <b>to</b> <b>deviate</b> <b>from</b> their counter-attacking style, to a more possession based one. In 2009–10, he instituted a fluid 4–3–3 formation to benefit from Fàbregas' creativity, and since the player's departure, had remodelled the system to 4–1–4–1 and 4–2–3–1. During {{the latter half of}} the 2016–17 Premier League season, Wenger switched to a 3-4-3 formation first used against Middlesbrough in a 1-2 win.|$|E

5|$|McDowall fined Revie £27 {{for missing}} {{two weeks of}} {{training}} for a family holiday in Blackpool, which infuriated him as he had already won permission from trainer Laurie Barnett and had promised to train whilst on holiday. McDowall dropped Revie {{for much of the}} 1955–56 season, preferring instead to play Bobby Johnstone. Revie played only one FA Cup match that season before being named in the team for the 1956 FA Cup Final against Birmingham City, with Johnstone being moved to the wings. He provided the assist for Joe Hayes's opening goal, and instructed Ken Barnes <b>to</b> <b>deviate</b> <b>from</b> the manager's instructions at half-time, with the result being a more dominant second half display and a 3–1 victory; Revie was named as Man of the Match. However the rift with his manager was not forgotten, and he was moved to right-half in the 1956–57 campaign, leaving him to seek a move away from Maine Road.|$|E
5|$|The 9/11 Commission {{estimated}} that the flight was hijacked between 08:51 and 08:54, shortly after American Airlines Flight 11 struck the World Trade Center and not too long after United Airlines Flight 175 had been hijacked. The last normal radio communications from the aircraft to air traffic control occurred at 08:50:51. Unlike the other three flights, there were no reports of anyone being stabbed or a bomb threat and the pilots were not immediately killed but shoved {{to the back of}} the plane with the rest of the passengers. At 08:54, the plane began <b>to</b> <b>deviate</b> <b>from</b> its normal, assigned flight path and turned south. Two minutes later at 08:56, the plane's transponder was switched off. The hijackers set the flight's autopilot on a course heading east towards Washington, D.C.|$|E
