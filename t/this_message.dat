5|$|Before {{receiving}} the French intelligence material, Rejewski {{had made a}} careful study of Enigma messages, particularly of the first six letters of messages intercepted on a single day. For security, each message was encrypted using different starting positions of the rotors, as selected by the operator. <b>This</b> <b>message</b> setting was three letters long. To convey it to the receiving operator, the sending operator began the message by sending the message setting in a disguised form — a six-letter indicator. The indicator was formed using the Enigma with its rotors set to a common global setting for that day, termed the ground setting, which was shared by all operators. The particular way that the indicator was constructed introduced a weakness into the cipher.|$|E

5|$|During {{the period}} of Nazi occupation, some Belgians collaborated with their occupiers. There were pro-Nazi {{political}} organizations in both Flemish and Walloon communities {{before and during the}} war. The most significant were DeVlag, Verdinaso and Vlaams Nationaal Verbond (VNV) in Flanders as well as the Catholic Rex movement in Wallonia. Each of these movements had subtly different ideologies, their own paramilitary forces and printed their own newspapers. These organisations were also instrumental in encouraging Belgians to enlist into the German Army. Unlike the German-style National Socialist agenda of DeVlag, VNV appealed directly to a Flemish separatist agenda, though <b>this</b> <b>message</b> was never the main source of their popularity. Infighting between the groups, particularly VNV and DeVlag, was considerable.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor uses Amy's {{communication}} chip {{to track}} her location, and lands the TARDIS in the Silence's control room five days later. As River and Rory hold the Silence at bay, the Doctor shows them the live {{broadcast of the}} moon landing.

Because of <b>this</b> <b>message,</b> humans will now turn upon the Silence whenever they see them. The group frees Amy and departs in the TARDIS, while River kills all the Silence in the control room. Amy reassures Rory that the man he overheard her speaking of loving through the communication chip was him, not the Doctor.|$|E

At 14:02, after being informed that the ship could no longer steer and was unavoidably sinking, Admiral Itō ordered the mission canceled, the crew to abandon ship, and for the remaining ships to begin rescuing survivors. Yamato communicated <b>this</b> <b>message</b> to the other surviving ships by signal flag because her radios had been destroyed.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 14 March, Kent and Glasgow {{approached}} Cumberland Bay; their appearance was relayed back to Dresden by one of her pinnaces, which {{had been sent to}} patrol the entrance to the bay. Dresden was unable to maneuver, owing to her fuel shortage, and Lüdecke signaled that his ship was no longer a combatant. The British disregarded <b>this</b> <b>message,</b> as well as a Chilean vessel that approached them as they entered the bay. Glasgow opened fire, in violation of Chile's neutrality; Britain had already informed Chile that British warships would disregard international law if they located Dresden in Chilean territorial waters. Shortly thereafter, Kent joined in the bombardment as well. The German gunners fired off three shots in response, but the guns were quickly knocked out by British gunfire.|$|E
5|$|Prosperity {{theology}} {{has become}} popular among poor Americans, {{particularly those who}} seek personal and social advancement. It has seen significant growth in black and Hispanic churches and is particularly popular among immigrants. Apologists for the movement note its ethnic diversity and argue that it encompasses a variety of views. Joel Robbins of Cambridge University notes that most anthropologists attribute the theology's appeal to the poor—especially in the Global South—to {{the fact that it}} promises security and helps explain capitalism. Simon Coleman developed a theory based on the doctrine's rhetoric and the feeling of belonging it gave parishioners. In a study of the Swedish Word of Life Church, he noted that members felt part of a complex gift-exchange system, giving to God and then awaiting a gift in return (either from God directly or through another church member). Hillsong Church, the largest congregation in Australia, teaches a form of prosperity theology that emphasizes personal success. Marion Maddox has argued that <b>this</b> <b>message</b> has drawn a significant number of upwardly mobile Australians.|$|E
5|$|The next operation, VII, {{began on}} the night of 30 June, when Albatross, Roon, and five torpedo boats steamed out of the Vistula River; they were met the {{following}} morning by Augsburgthe flagship of Kommodore (Commodore) Johannes von KarpfLübeck, and two more torpedo boats. Albatross was to lay another minefield off Bogskär. Later that day, Roon, Lübeck, and two torpedo boats separated {{from the rest of the}} flotilla to guard a channel between German minefields, while Albatross and the rest of the ships continued north to Bogskär. That evening, Albatross laid a field of 160mines, after which she and Augsburg turned back south and rendezvoused with Roon and Lübeck. Karpf then issued via wireless a report to headquarters that gave his position, speed, and bearing. <b>This</b> <b>message</b> was intercepted and decrypted by the Russians; coincidentally, the Russian fleet had planned an operation to bombard Memel the following day, and several cruises had put to sea on 1 July.|$|E

Mickey guides the reset Data-Sora to the extra world where he is tested by a virtual Roxas to endure the pain of having forgotten his friends {{as a result of}} being reset. Data-Sora defeats Data-Roxas and is allowed access to the deepest portion of Castle Oblivion. There he and Mickey encounter a virtual Naminé, who reveals the real Naminé as the one who left the message after discovering a set of memories relating to the people tied to the real Sora's heart—Roxas, Axel, Xion, Terra, Aqua, and Ventus—while restoring his lost memories; the bugs are also revealed to have been an unintentional side effect of her message. Before disappearing, Data-Naminé explains that it is the real Sora's duty to save these people. Mickey relays <b>this</b> <b>message</b> to Sora through the bottled letter shown at the end of Kingdom Hearts II.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{details the}} design and {{development}} of a new messaging system for use in the mobile space. <b>This</b> <b>messaging</b> system consists of one back-end server, an API, a proxy server, client components, and a website. Developing such a system for the mobile space is a challenge, however, due to the unique characteristics found in the mobile space. Solutions to overcome these challenges are derived from RESTful web services and cloud computing technologies. Furthermore, the HTTP and CoAP protocols are explored for use in <b>this</b> <b>messaging</b> system. Experiments are then conducted to derive the most optimal protocol. For the purposes of testing <b>this</b> <b>messaging</b> system, two adaptive application management features are developed and provided through the system to the mobile development community. The rst feature is GUI Menu Ordering, which allows developers to adapt their application menu's automatically depending on user usage. The second feature is Proficiency User Modeling, which allows developers to automatically con gure their applications depending on user use behavior style. Results show the successful development of an event messaging system. In terms of the protocols CoAP surpasses HTTP in terms of performance and data consumption. However, the addition of a required CoAP proxy server a ects performance and client/server data consumption. Thus CoAP becomes slower than HTTP, but consumes less data if only the client data is measured. Furthermore, results show that if encryption is used there is an a ect. CoAP with encryption remains faster than HTTPS, even with a CoAP proxy server...|$|R

50|$|A Tea object acts {{with the}} {{property}} that messages sent to it are redirected to replicated copies of itself on other users' participating machines in a peer-to-peer network. <b>This</b> <b>messaging</b> protocol supports a coordinated distributed two-phase commit {{that is used}} to control the progression of computations at participating user sites. In <b>this</b> way <b>messages</b> may be dynamically redirected to large numbers of users while maintaining the appropriate deadline-based scheduling. Thus, TeaTime is designed to allow for a great deal of adaptability and resilience and works on a heterogeneous set of resources. It is a framework of abstraction that works over a range of implementations and that can be evolved and tuned over time, both within an application and across applications.|$|R
