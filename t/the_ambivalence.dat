5|$|In 2014, his <b>The</b> <b>Ambivalence</b> of 1960 was {{featured}} in an exhibition at the Casino Luxembourg. The piece is a six-minute collage of speeches from Nigeria's 1960 independence festivities, including those of President Nnamdi Azikiwe, Prime Minister Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, and English Princess Alexandra of Kent. Their aspirations for a human rights, freedom, religious tolerance, and economic development, compared with the present day, show Nigeria's political failures over the previous half-century. Ogboh visited New York City in September 2014 with his danfo share taxi, a symbol of public transport in Lagos, for a one-day installation (Lagos State of Mind II at The Africa Center in Harlem. The installation included photos of the taxi with historic landmarks and African-American neighborhoods in New York City, juxtaposed against sounds situated {{in and out of}} the taxi. One of Ogboh's earlier works, Verbal Maps of Ojuelegba, features a Lagos danfo driver reciting the Ojuelegba route. The artist noted how hawking has been banned on Lagos's new roads and that the danfo share taxi will eventually disappear, along with their contribution to the city's soundscapes. This historical element was not an initial consideration in the project, though the artist planned for his future work to narrate the transformation of the city.|$|E

Ultimately, <b>the</b> <b>ambivalence</b> of labor groups led those within the Administration who supported NAFTA to believe that strengthening NAFTA's labor side agreement too much would cost more votes among Republicans than it would garner among Democrats, and would make it harder for the United States to elicit support from Mexico.|$|E

500|$|Originally {{starting}} {{its life}} as a strategy game, From Dust marked the return of Éric Chahi to the video game industry following an extended sabbatical {{after the completion of}} his last game, Heart of Darkness.

The team was further inspired by [...] African and New Guinean tribes, Conway's Game of Life, works of Polish painter Zdzisław Beksiński, and Koyaanisqatsi. Some features, such as the biological life cycle of the tribespeople, were left out of the game because of the huge amount of work they would require. Ubisoft was originally doubtful about the project but was later convinced by Chahi. The game was made by a small team within the Montpellier studio, so was considered an independent game produced by a large publisher. The game was announced at E3 2010 as Project Dust.|$|E
500|$|The {{story and}} characters—particularly Trevor—polarised reviewers. Some {{felt that the}} {{narrative}} was not as well written as previous Rockstar games and cited Grand Theft Auto IV and Red Dead Redemptions plot strengths. Others felt that the protagonists' contrasting personalities gave the narrative tighter pacing. GamesRadar's Hollander Cooper thought the game negated inconsistencies {{in the story of}} previous entries, whose single lead protagonists had muddled morality. GameSpot's Petit considered Trevor in particular a [...] "truly horrible, terrifying, psychotic human being—and a terrific character". Eurogamers Bramwell found Trevor [...] "shallow and unconvincing", and felt that his eccentricities hurt the narrative and overshadowed Michael and Franklin's character development. Joystiq's de Matos faulted the protagonists' lack of likability for him, and found <b>the</b> <b>ambivalence</b> between Michael and Trevor a tired plot device as their conflict grew into a [...] "seemingly endless cycle". The Escapists Greg Tito had difficulty connecting with the characters' emotions since they acted out of greed with no sense of morality and thus gave players little reason to support them.|$|E

[...] Eurogamer's Tom Bramwell, however, felt that Trevor undermined the other characters {{because he was a}} [...] "shallow and unconvincing" [...] sensationalised anti-hero, and that [...] "his antics derail the narrative" [...] and overshadowed the character development of Michael and Franklin.

500|$|One of the {{decisions}} Yasui made was to make Drakengard 2 far more colorful than the previous game, wanting {{to do something that}} was the [...] "opposite" [...] of Drakengard. In contrast to the previous game, the game contained far less of the mature themes found in the original. Shiba, speaking in a 2013 interview, said that the reason for this was that Square Enix, the company's Japanese publisher, wanted that aspect toned down to make a more mainstream game. It was designed to keep some dark aesthetics from its predecessor, with the previous game's theme of immorality as one of the key character and narrative themes, as well as themes of war and death. Other themes explored were love and hate, and <b>the</b> <b>ambivalence</b> represented in the world's prevalent factions (the Knights of the Seal, and the Cult of Watchers). Highlighted aspects of the story were the father-son relationship between Nowe and Legna, and how Manah had matured since the events of Drakengard. To promote the game in Japan, Fujisaka created a light-toned joke advertisement under the name Angelegna, referring to the original names of the two dragon characters. While Square Enix published the title in Japan, they entered an agreement with developer and publishing company Ubisoft to publish the title overseas. Ubisoft also handled the game's localization.|$|E

Jon Pareles of The New York Times praised Polow da Don's production of the song, writing [...] "Fading' strategizes with long and short elements—sustained choruses and staccato verses, edgeless keyboard chords and notes that are suddenly truncated—to capture <b>the</b> <b>ambivalence</b> of a failing romance." [...] Melissa Maerz of Rolling Stone commented that the singer manages to remain [...] "serene" [...] on the song, even with the sampling of Enya's [...] "One by One", and added that [...] "maybe the good girl gone bad is getting better?", in reference to Rihanna's third studio album title, Good Girl Gone Bad (2007).|$|E

500|$|In {{the high}} {{distance}} of the background, above the hybrid stone formations, four groups of people and creatures are seen in flight. On the immediate left a human male rides on a chthonic solar eagle-lion. The human carries a triple-branched tree of life on which perches a bird; according to Fraenger [...] "a symbolic bird of death". Fraenger believes the man is intended to represent a genius, [...] "he is {{the symbol of the}} extinction of the duality of the sexes, which are resolved in the ether into their original state of unity". To their right a knight with a dolphin tail sails on a winged fish. The knight's tail curls back to touch the back of his head, which references the common symbol of eternity: the snake biting its own tail. On the immediate right of the panel, a winged youth soars upwards carrying a fish in his hands and a falcon on his back. According to Belting, in these passages Bosch's [...] "imagination triumphs... <b>the</b> <b>ambivalence</b> of [...] visual syntax exceeds even the enigma of content, opening up that new dimension of freedom by which painting becomes art." [...] Fraenger titled his chapter on the high background [...] "The Ascent to Heaven", and wrote that the airborne figures were likely intended as a link between [...] "what is above" [...] and [...] "what is below", just as the left and right hand panels represent [...] "what was" [...] and [...] "what will be".|$|E
500|$|Just as Lee explores Jem's {{development}} {{in coming to}} grips with a racist and unjust society, Scout realizes what being female means, and several female characters influence her development. [...] Scout's primary identification with her father and older brother allows her to describe the variety and depth of female characters in the novel both as one of them and as an outsider. [...] Scout's primary female models are Calpurnia and her neighbor Miss Maudie, both of whom are strong-willed, independent, and protective. [...] Mayella Ewell also has an influence; Scout watches her destroy an innocent man in order to hide her desire for him. [...] The female characters who comment the most on Scout's lack of willingness to adhere to a more feminine role are also those who promote the most racist and classist points of view. [...] For example, Mrs. Dubose chastises Scout for not wearing a dress and camisole, and indicates she is ruining the family name by not doing so, in addition to insulting Atticus' intentions to defend Tom Robinson. [...] By balancing the masculine influences of Atticus and Jem with the feminine influences of Calpurnia and Miss Maudie, one scholar writes, [...] "Lee gradually demonstrates that Scout is becoming a feminist in the South, for with the use of first-person narration, she indicates that Scout/ Jean Louise still maintains <b>the</b> <b>ambivalence</b> about being a Southern lady she possessed as a child." ...|$|E
