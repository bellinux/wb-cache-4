25|$|Like Plato, Mazzoni {{was very}} {{concerned}} with determining the purpose of poetry (Weinberg, 324). For him, its purpose is to “move the reader to pleasure and delight {{in the perception of}} the believable images.” Essentially, for Mazzoni, the purpose of poetry is recreation and pleasure; however, he also attaches a concept he calls “civil faculty.” In part, <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the idea that taking a break from serious business (i.e., by creating or consuming poetry) allows one to return to that business afterwards with renewed enthusiasm. Mazzoni also says, however, that there is a distinct pleasure in poetry which, in addition to its ability to delight, carries with it a concealed lesson, moral, or other element that allows it to contribute to the improvement of society.|$|E
25|$|A study {{conducted}} in the Tocantis State, in northern Brazil, found that many families were cutting down forests {{in order to produce}} two conglomerates of oilseed plants, the J. curcas (JC group) and the R. communis (RC group). This region is composed of 15% Amazonian rainforest with high biodiversity, and 80% Cerrado forest with lower biodiversity. During the study, the farmers that planted the JC group released over 2193 Mg CO2, while losing 53-105 Mg CO2 sequestration from deforestation; and the RC group farmers released 562 Mg CO2, while losing 48-90 Mg CO2 to be sequestered from forest depletion. The production of these types of biofuels not only led into an increased emission of carbon dioxide, but also to lower efficiency of forests to absorb the gases that these farms were emitting. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the amount of fossil fuel the production of fuel crops involves. In addition, the intensive use of monocropping agriculture requires large amounts of water irrigation, as well as of fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides. This does not only lead to poisonous chemicals to disperse on water runoff, but also to the emission of nitrous oxide (NO2) as a fertilizer byproduct, which is three hundred times more efficient in producing a greenhouse effect than carbon dioxide (CO2).|$|E

2500|$|Many older North American sockets {{have two}} {{different}} current and voltage ratings, most commonly 10A 250V/15A 125V. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with a peculiarity of the National Electrical Code from 1923 to the 1950s. Originally, sockets were rated at 10A 250V, because the NEC limited lighting circuits to 10A. In 1923, the code changed to allow lighting circuits {{to be fused}} at 15A, but the previous 10A rule still applied to circuits over 125V.

2500|$|Buenos Aires {{has also}} become a {{prominent}} center of contemporary street art; its welcoming attitude has made {{it one of the}} world's top capitals of such expression.

However, not all of its street art concerns politics, it is also used as a symbol of democracy and freedom of expression. Murals and graffiti are so common that they are considered [...] "an everyday occurrence," [...] and have become part of the urban landscape of barrios such as Palermo, Villa Urquiza, Coghlan and San Telmo. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the legality of such activities —provided that the building owner has consented—, and the receptiveness of local authorities, who even subsidize various works.

2500|$|Novelists {{often will}} be {{assessed}} in contemporary criticism {{based on their}} gender or treatment of gender. Largely, <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the dominance {{of men in the}} publishing situation. Literary criticism, especially since the rise of feminist theory, pays attention to how women, historically, have experienced a very different set of writing expectations based on their gender; for example, the editors of The Feminist Companion to Literature in English point out: [...] "Their texts emerge from and intervene in conditions usually very different from those which produced most writing by men." [...] It {{is not a question of}} the subject matter or political stance of a particular author, but of her gender: her position as a woman within the literary marketplace. However, [...] the publishing market's orientation to favor the primary reading audience of women may increasingly skew the market towards female novelists; for this reason, novelist Teddy Wayne argued in a 2012 Salon article titled [...] "The agony of the male novelist" [...] that midlist male novelists are less likely to find success than midlist female novelist, even though men tend to dominate [...] "literary fiction" [...] spaces.|$|E
2500|$|Kierkegaard also {{stresses}} the importance of the self, and the self's relation to the world, as being grounded in self-reflection and introspection. He argued in Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments that [...] "subjectivity is truth" [...] and [...] "truth is subjectivity." [...] <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with a distinction between what is objectively true and an individual's subjective relation (such as indifference or commitment) to that truth. People who in some sense believe the same things may relate to those beliefs quite differently. Two individuals may both believe that many of those around them are poor and deserve help, but this knowledge may lead only one of them to decide to actually help the poor. This is how Kierkegaard put it: [...] "What a priceless invention statistics are, what a glorious fruit of culture, what a characteristic counterpart to the de te narratur fabula [...] of antiquity. Schleiermacher so enthusiastically declares that knowledge does not perturb religiousness, and that the religious person does not sit safeguarded by a lightning rod and scoff at God; yet with the help of statistical tables one laughs at all of life." [...] In other words, Kierkegaard says: [...] "Who has the more difficult task: the teacher who lectures on earnest things a meteor's distance from everyday life – or the learner who should put it to use?" [...] This is how it was summed up in 1940.|$|E

[...] Meng Guang then said, [...] "This is what is expected of every other person. What I really want to know is his level of political wisdom and how good his political skills are." [...] Xi Zheng replied, [...] "The Crown Prince's approach towards life is to focus on winning people's hearts and favour. He won't do what he shouldn't do. He doesn't openly reveal his wisdom. Besides, political skills can only be used under certain circumstances; they cannot be cultivated and learnt in advance." [...] Meng Guang knew that Xi Zheng was trying to careful with his words, so he said, [...] "I like to speak my mind as freely as possible. Every time I openly make criticisms, people will ridicule or hate me for that. Although I sense that you don't like to hear what I say, my words make sense. The Empire is not unified yet. Political skills are crucial in this time and age. While one's mastery of political skills depends on his intellectual abilities, political skills can be learnt and mastered through diligence. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the Crown Prince's education.

2500|$|One may query what <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with zero-point energy. Given {{the complex}} and {{adaptive}} behaviour that arises from nonlinear systems considerable attention {{in recent years has}} gone into studying a new class of phase transitions which occur at absolute zero temperature. These are quantum phase transitions which are driven by EM field fluctuations as a consequence of zero-point energy A good example of a spontaneous phase transition that are attributed to zero-point fluctuations can be found in superconductors. Superconductivity {{is one of the best}} known empirically quantified macroscopic electromagnetic phenomena whose basis is recognised to be quantum mechanical in origin. The behaviour of the electric and magnetic fields under superconductivity is governed by the London equations. However, it has been questioned in a series of journal articles whether the quantum mechanically canonised London equations can be given a purely classical derivation. Bostick for instance, has claimed to show that the London equations do indeed have a classical origin that applies to superconductors and to some collisionless plasmas as well. In particular it has been asserted that the Beltrami vortices in the plasma focus display the same paired flux-tube morphology as Type II superconductors. Others have also pointed out this connection, Fröhlich has shown that the hydrodynamic equations of compressible fluids, together with the London equations, lead to a macroscopic parameter ( [...] = electric charge density / mass density), without involving either quantum phase factors or Planck's constant. In essence, it has been asserted that Beltrami plasma vortex structures are able to at least simulate the morphology of Type I and Type II superconductors. This occurs because the [...] "organised" [...] dissipative energy of the vortex configuration comprising the ions and electrons far exceeds the [...] "disorganised" [...] dissipative random thermal energy. The transition from disorganised fluctuations to organised helical structures is a phase transition involving a change in the condensate's energy (i.e. the ground state or zero-point energy) but without any associated rise in temperature. This is an example of zero-point energy having multiple stable states (see Quantum phase transition, Quantum critical point, Topological degeneracy, Topological order) and where the overall system structure is independent of a reductionist or deterministic view, that [...] "classical" [...] macroscopic order can also causally affect quantum phenomena. Furthermore, the pair production of Beltrami vortices has been compared to the morphology of pair production of virtual particles in the vacuum.|$|E
