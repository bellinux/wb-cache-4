5000|$|A <b>tiltrotator</b> (known under {{a number}} of trade names) is an {{hydraulic}} attachment/tool used on most excavators, and backhoes between 3-30 tons in the Nordic countries (Sweden, Finland, and Norway). A <b>tiltrotator</b> is mounted on the excavator such that the excavator bucket can be rotated through 360 degrees and one tilts +/- 45 degrees, {{in order to increase}} the flexibility and precision of the excavator. A <b>tiltrotator</b> can best be described as a wrist between the arm of the excavator and bucket, (or whatever other tool is fitted to the tiltrotator's quick coupler). With its integral quick coupler and rotary swivel, the <b>tiltrotator</b> can also use extra hydraulic functions to power and manipulate other worktools below it such as a breaker, grapple or an auger, which can be attached to the quickcoupler on the <b>tiltrotator,</b> for simplified attachment mounting, dramatically increasing the excavator's utilization on the jobsite. control systems which allows the operator to operate the machine fully through the joysticks. Recognized control systems are SVAB, ICS by Indexator, Engcon Microprop DC2 and Steelwrist XControl G2. The <b>tiltrotator</b> is nowadays controlled through machines two or four electro-proportionally controlled hydraulic lines.|$|E
50|$|Other {{companies}} manufacturing {{their version}} of Rotortilt {{on a smaller scale}} include SMP, HKS, Kinshofer, Marttiini Metals, Catsu and Giant China under various product names as <b>tiltrotator,</b> swingrotator, swingotilt, mRoto, Nox, Rotiltor etc., although it's still commonplace on the market as a genericized trademark to call all versions a <b>Tiltrotator.</b>|$|E
50|$|In recent years, {{hydraulic}} excavator capabilities have expanded far beyond excavation tasks. With {{the advent of}} hydraulic powered attachments such as a <b>tiltrotator,</b> breaker, a grapple or an auger, the excavator is frequently used in many applications other than excavation and with the <b>tiltrotator</b> attachment, actually serves as an effective tool carrier. Many excavators feature quick coupler (quick-attach) mounting systems for simplified attachment mounting, dramatically increasing the machine's utilization on the jobsite.|$|E
50|$|Rototilt Group AB is a {{technology}} company in Vindeln in Västerbotten, Sweden that manufactures <b>tiltrotators</b> {{to the construction}} industry.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Tiltrotator</b> (also {{known as}} a Rotortilt) was invented in Sweden in the early 1980s by the Norgrens under the family owned and {{operated}} company named Noreco, and has become the standard in Scandinavia. The concept has recently gained popularity in other countries such as the Netherlands, Germany, UK, Japan, Canada and since 2002, are now being distributed in the United States.There are three major manufacturers of the <b>Tiltrotator</b> concept today (although similar products are sold by various competitors); Indexator, (founded in 1973 by Alan Jonsson) who purchased Noreco in 1992, hired the Norgren brothers, and registered the brandname Rototilt, Engcon, (founded in 1993 by also ex-Noreco employee, Stig Engstrom) who started manufacturing their own product using only [...] "tiltrotator" [...] to avoid trademark infringements, and Steelwrist, (founded in 2005 {{by a team of}} industrialists), who started manufacturing after acquiring a new design originating from a <b>tiltrotator</b> called Dento which was released in 1989.|$|E
50|$|Rototilt Group AB is a {{spin-out}} from Indexator, {{a family}} company purchased in 1973 by Allan Jonsson, who 10 years previously had founded crane manufacturer Cranab. The focus on tiltrotators began during Jonsson’s time. In 1992 he {{gained access to}} the <b>tiltrotator</b> product and the brand of Rototilt - developed by Noreco founded in the 1980s by the Norgren brothers - through acquisition of the bankrupt family company Noreco in Umeå. 1 Rototilt is a <b>tiltrotator</b> that makes excavation, rotation and tilting by the bucket (or other tool intended for excavators) possible in one single movement.|$|E
5000|$|With {{the advent}} of {{hydraulic}} powered attachments such as a <b>tiltrotator,</b> breaker, a grapple or an auger, the backhoe is frequently used in many applications other than excavation and with the <b>tiltrotator</b> attachment, serves as an effective tool carrier. Many backhoes feature quick coupler (quick-attach) mounting systems for simplified attachment mounting, dramatically increasing the machine's utilization on the job site. Backhoes are usually employed together with loaders and bulldozers. Excavators that use a backhoe are sometimes called [...] "trackhoes" [...] by {{people who do not}} realize the name is due to the action of the bucket, not its location on a backhoe loader.|$|E
5000|$|Backhoe loaders {{are very}} common {{and can be}} used {{for a wide variety of}} tasks: construction, small demolitions, light {{transportation}} of building materials, powering building equipment, digging holes/excavation, landscaping, breaking asphalt, and paving roads. Often, the backhoe bucket can also be replaced with powered attachments such as a breaker, grapple, auger, or a stump grinder. Enhanced articulation of attachments can be achieved with intermediate attachments such as the <b>tiltrotator.</b> Many backhoes feature quick coupler (quick-attach) mounting systems and auxiliary hydraulic circuits for simplified attachment mounting, increasing the machine's utilization on the job site. Some loader buckets have a retractable bottom or [...] "clamshell", enabling it to empty its load more quickly and efficiently. Retractable-bottom loader buckets are also often used for grading and scraping. The front assembly may be a removable attachment or permanently mounted.|$|E
