For example, the Great Fairy's Mask helps retrieve stray fairies {{scattered throughout}} the four temples, the Bunny Hood allows Link to run faster, and the Stone Mask renders Link invisible to most non-playable characters and enemies. Less valuable masks are usually involved only in optional side-quests or specialized situations. Examples include the Postman's Hat, which grants Link access <b>to</b> <b>items</b> in mailboxes, and Kafei's Mask, which initiates a long side-quest to receive the Couple's Mask.|$|E

25|$|Attention deficit {{hyperactivity}} disorder (ADHD) {{is known to be}} highly comorbid with conduct disorder (a theorized precursor to ASPD), and may also co-occur with psychopathic tendencies.

25|$|According <b>to</b> <b>items</b> of {{experiences}} involved, two subdivisions are made: general meditation, which aims at the mental assimilation of the Divine Truths (through philosophical thinking, hearing discourses from the Masters, or reading the written expositions of the Masters), and specialized meditation (meditation {{concerned with the}} object of experience, meditation concerned with the subject of experience and meditation concerned with mental processes), in which the mind is exclusively concerned with some definite experience it selects. In this system of classification are also mentioned two types of meditation of the Spiritually Perfect: Nirvana (or absorption) and the Nirvikalpa State (or divinity in expression).|$|E

40|$|Probabilistic {{and learned}} {{approaches}} to student modeling are attractive {{because of the}} uncertainty surrounding the student skills assessment {{and because of the}} need to automatize the process. <b>Item</b> <b>to</b> <b>item</b> structures readily lend themselves to probabilistic and fully learned models because they are solely composed of observable nodes, like answers to test questions. Their structure is also well grounded in the cognitive theory of knowledge spaces. We study the effectiveness of two Bayesian frameworks <b>to</b> learn <b>item</b> <b>to</b> <b>item</b> structures and <b>to</b> use the induced structures <b>to</b> predict <b>item</b> outcome from a subset of evidence. One approach, POKS, relies on a naive Bayes framework whereas the other is based on the Bayesian network learning and inference framework. Both approaches are assessed over their predictive ability and their computational efficiency in different experimental simulations. The results from simulations over three data sets show that they both can e#ectively perform accurate predictions, but POKS generally displays higher predictive power than the Bayesian network. Moreover, the simplicity of POKS translates to a time e#ciency of one to three orders of magnitude greater than the Bayesian network runs. We furhter explore the use of the <b>item</b> <b>to</b> <b>item</b> approach for handling concepts mastery assessment. The approach investigated consist in augmenting an initial set of observations, based on inferences with the <b>item</b> <b>to</b> <b>item</b> structure, and feed the augmented set to a Bayesian network containing a number of concepts. The results show that augmented set can effectively improve predictive power of a Bayesian network for item outcome, but that improvement does not transfer to the concept assessment in this particular experiment.
