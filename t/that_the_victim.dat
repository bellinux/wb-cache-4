5|$|On December 18, 2007, a 44-year-old guest {{was found}} {{unconscious}} after the train {{returned to the}} station. He {{was taken to a}} hospital, where he was pronounced dead. A preliminary autopsy by the Orange County medical examiner's office concluded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> had died of dilated cardiomyopathy.|$|E
5|$|Although immobilizing {{a victim}} {{in front of}} a gun before firing the cannon {{is by far the most}} {{reported}} method, a case from Istanbul in 1596 alleges <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> was actually put into the gun and executed in that manner. Reports exist that attest that on occasion, people were fastened to rockets and blown into the air, this is said to have occurred for a Brahmin under Hyder Ali's reign (1761â€“1782), and also, in an 1800 treason case, in the Maratha Empire.|$|E
5|$|Chandler {{was found}} guilty of the murders, and was sentenced to death on November 4, 1994. He {{maintained}} his innocence, and continued to pursue legal appeals while on Florida's Death Row. He admitted to the Madeira Beach incident but said the sex was consensual, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> changed her mind during the act. Since Chandler had already been sentenced to death for the Rogers family murders, and prosecutors did not want to subject Blair to the emotional trauma of a rape trial, he was never prosecuted for Blair's rape.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{virtually}} everyone recognizes <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> themselves {{have no choice}} or say in their lot, Stephen Awudi Gadri says <b>that</b> [...] "both <b>the</b> parents (of <b>the</b> <b>victims)</b> and <b>the</b> girls (<b>that</b> is, <b>the</b> <b>victims)</b> have no choice".|$|R
25|$|However, he also commented <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> of this {{disaster}} were pitiable.|$|R

5|$|In 2009, President Obama {{signed into}} law the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010, which {{contained}} in it the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, the first addition to existing federal hate crime law in the United States since Democratic President Bill Clinton {{signed into law}} the Church Arson Prevention Act of 1996. The Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act expanded existing federal hate crime laws in the United States to apply to crimes motivated by a victim's actual or perceived gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability, and dropped the prerequisite <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> be engaging in a federally protected activity.|$|E
5|$|In Mendota, Minnesota, John Doggett (Robert Patrick) {{arrives at}} an {{abandoned}} apartment building {{after getting a}} tip, and sees a figure bolt {{out of one of}} the rooms during the night. He hears a scratching sound and claws away at the fresh plaster wall until blood begins streaming downward. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) performs an autopsy on the body Doggett found and one of her FBI cadets, Rudolph Hayes, accurately guesses <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> hooked up with a psychotic killer at a bar. Hayes's suggestions lead Scully to connect this murder to another killing two weeks earlier. In the meantime, Doggett wonders why anyone tipped him off about the murder, since it is not an X-File.|$|E
5|$|Scully {{tells her}} {{version of the story}} via a {{flashback}} to the previous day. She arrives at work and Mulder tells her about a murder in Texas, which he believes to be the work of vampires. In her version, Mulder is exuberant, insensitive, and irritating, while she is calm and mindful of her thoughts. The agents travel to the small town of Chaney, Texas where they meet Sheriff Hartwell (Luke Wilson), whom Scully finds highly charming. Mulder and Hartwell leave to investigate further while Scully autopsies the body. She discovers <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim,</b> whose last meal had been pizza, was incapacitated with chloral hydrate. She returns to the motel room and orders a pizza, but Mulder soon appears and sends her back to autopsy another body. She leaves him just as her food is delivered. When she finds that the second victim had also ingested chloral hydrate in a pizza, she realizes Mulder is in danger and returns to the motel room. She finds him about to be attacked by the pizza delivery boy, Ronnie Strickland (Patrick Renna). She shoots at Ronnie, who runs off into the woods. When she catches up to him, Mulder has gotten there first and hammered a stake into Ronnie's heart.|$|E
5000|$|Gary Rosenblatt, {{editor-in-chief}} of The Jewish Week, commented <b>that</b> reactions to <b>the</b> Itamar killings {{may have been}} more muted given <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> were religious Israelis living in a small West Bank settlement. He claimed <b>that</b> had <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> been secular Jews living inside the Green Line [...] "outrage would have been far greater".|$|R
5|$|During {{a protest}} against the {{juvenile}} convict's release on December 16, 2015, <b>the</b> <b>victim's</b> mother said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim's</b> name was Jyoti Singh {{and she was not}} ashamed of disclosing her name.|$|R

5|$|There {{were now}} four {{possible}} actions for theft, by the victim: the action furti itself and three complementary actions. The actio furti concepti was available against the occupier {{of the building}} in which the stolen goods were found, regardless of his knowledge of them and brought three-times damages. The actio furti prohibiti could be pursued against anyone who declined a search with witnesses, with four-times damages. The actio furti non exhibiti could be brought if the respondent did not bring the thing to court, although its penalty is unclear. There was a further action available to the respondent of an actio furti concepti who had been found liable: he could sue the person who gave it to him, for {{the extent of his}} own liability. <b>That</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> could sue both the thief and handler, if he could show who the thief was, which would have difficult without the presence of the thing. This was both penal, and an attempt to give the plaintiff enough actions to compensate him, because the thief, at least was not usually solvent.|$|E
25|$|Victim blaming: The {{victim of}} someone else's {{accident}} or bad luck may be offered criticism, the theory being <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> {{may be at}} fault for having attracted the other person's hostility.|$|E
25|$|Twenty-year-old student Ashraf Haziq was {{attacked}} while cycling along Queen's Road in Barking. The prosecution said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> was {{punched in the}} face by {{one of a group}} of 100 youths. His bike, PlayStation Portable and mobile phone were stolen. In September 2011, an accusation of robbery was made against 24-year-old Reece Donovan.|$|E

During a trial brought by the victim's family against Oakwood, a jury returned a narrative verdict stating <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> died due to being improperly restrained.|$|E
25|$|In May 2006 the Supreme Court of Ireland {{struck down}} the law on {{statutory}} rape as unconstitutional as it did not allow an individual accused to enter the defence of reasonable belief <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> was of age. The Supreme Court's decision surprised the whole country, and in the aftermath, McDowell was widely criticised for failing to anticipate the decision.|$|E

25|$|The power rapists {{tends to}} have fantasies about sexual conquests and rape.

The rapist believes <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> enjoyed what was done to them, and they may even ask the victim to meet them for a date later.|$|E
25|$|The plot {{revolves}} around a murder where the forensic investigation discovers <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> {{was killed by}} a hug from a humaniform robot. The robot violated both the First Law and Dilov's Fourth Law (assumed in Kesarovksi's universe to be the valid one) because it did not establish for itself that it was a robot. The story was reviewed by Valentin D. Ivanov in SFF review webzine The Portal.|$|E

25|$|Because {{it would}} take a very large amount of heavy water to replace 25% to 50% of a human being's body water (water being in turn 50â€“75% of body weight) with heavy water, {{accidental}} or intentional poisoning with heavy water is unlikely to the point of practical disregard. Poisoning would require <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> ingest large amounts of heavy water without significant normal water intake for many days to produce any noticeable toxic effects.|$|E
25|$|On May 22, 2006, a 39-year-old {{man from}} Lakeville, Minnesota {{suffered}} a bruised spinal cord {{while attempting to}} ride the FlowRider wave ride on a boogie board.
