Forty years earlier, a full-length book had appeared, An Essay on the Dramatic Character of Sir John Falstaff (1777), by Maurice Morgann, often taken {{as the beginning of}} that school of Shakespearean criticism which considers the characters of Shakespeare's plays as though they were real people. Hazlitt, who seems to have had little acquaintance with Morgann's work, is careful never <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> Falstaff's status as a character in a play—three plays, in fact, though the two parts of Henry IV are examined in a single essay.|$|E

It was determined that the ship in question was a neutral American merchant, and she was allowed to continue on her way. Prowse recovered the boat and hauled away from the French warship.

40|$|The {{question}} what scientific progress means {{for a particular}} domain such as medicine seems importantly different from the {{question what}} scientific progress is in general. While the latter question received ample treatment in the philosophical literature, the former question is hardly discussed. I {{argue that it is}} nonetheless important to think about this question in view of the methodological choices we make. I raise specific questions that should be tackled regarding scientific progress in the medical sciences and demonstrate their importance by means of an analysis of what evidence-based medicine (EBM) has, and has not, to offer in terms of progress. I show how critically thinking about EBM {{from the point of view}} of progress can help us in putting EBM and its favoured methodologies in the right perspective. My conclusion will be that blindly favouring certain methods because of their immediately tangible short-term benefits implies that we parry the important question of how best to advance progress in the long run. This leads us <b>to</b> <b>losing</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> our general goals in doing research in the medical sciences...|$|R

25|$|Why {{does the}} Court not apply this clear law to these clear facts, and conclude, as I do, that the funding scheme {{here is a}} clear {{constitutional}} violation? The answer must be, in part, that the Court fails to confront the evidence {{set out in the}} preceding section. Throughout its opinion, the Court refers uniformly to Wide Awakes Christian viewpoint or its religious perspective, and in distinguishing funding of Wide Awake from the funding of a church, the Court maintains that Wide Awake is not a religious institution, at least in the usual sense. The Court does not quote the magazine's adoption of Saint Paul's exhortation to awaken to the nearness of salvation, or any of its articles enjoining readers to accept Jesus Christ, or the religious verses, or the religious textual analyses, or the suggested prayers. And so, it is easy for the Court <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> what the University students and the Court of Appeals found so obvious, and to blanch the patently and frankly evangelistic character of the magazine by unrevealing allusions to religious points of view.|$|E
500|$|At 4:11pm Lion {{observed}} the track of a torpedo fired by Moltke pass astern, {{but it was}} thought that the torpedo was fired by a U-boat on the disengaged side.

The range had grown too far for accurate shooting so Beatty altered course four points to port to close the range again between 4:12 and 4:15.

40|$|The authors {{attempted}} to identify perceptual mechanisms that pick up information for initiating a run to catch fly balls and for judging their landing locations. Fly balls {{have been shown}} to be tracked with the eyes and head (R. R. D. Oudejans, C. F. Michaels, F. C. Bakker, & K. Davids, 1999). This raised the question of whether constraining eye and head movements of experienced baseball players by having them wear eye-movement-preventing goggles (eye movements would lead <b>to</b> <b>losing</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> the ball) or a head-movement-preventing neck brace, or both, would limit their capacity (a) to start running in the correct direction and (b) to make correct judgments about the balls' landing locations. Restrictions had minimal effects on response accuracy, but response latency was affected. The goggles increased latency of both running and judging. Moreover, the neck brace decreased judgment time, particularly for difficult balls, suggesting that head stability is important for making judgments. High performance levels suggested that the perceptual system was flexible; that is, different parts of the system can perform the same function. The implications of these findings for perceptual mechanisms are discussed...|$|R
500|$|At 4:11 p.m. a torpedo {{fired by}} Moltke passed under Princess Royal. Those aboard the British ship saw the torpedo's track, but {{incorrectly}} {{concluded that a}} U-boat was positioned {{on the opposite side}} of the British line (away from the German battlecruisers) and was firing towards both groups of ships. This false impression was compounded by reports of a periscope sighting by the destroyer [...] By this time, the distance between the British and German ships was too great for accurate fire, so Beatty altered course four points to port between 4:12 and 4:15, closing the range. This manoeuvre exposed Lion to the fire of the German battlecruisers, and the smoke from multiple successful hits caused Derfflinger <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> Princess Royal and switch targets to [...] at 4:16. By 4:25, the range was down to [...] and Beatty turned two points to starboard to open the range again.

At 4:30, the light cruiser , scouting in front of Beatty's ships, spotted the lead elements of the High Seas Fleet charging north at top speed.

500|$|The range {{had grown}} too far for {{accurate}} shooting, so Beatty altered course four points to port {{to close the}} range again between 16:12 and 16:15. This manoeuvre exposed Lion to the fire of the German battlecruisers, and she was hit several times. The smoke and fumes from these hits caused [...] <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> Lion, which had sheered out of line to starboard, and to switch her fire to Queen Mary, now visible to Derfflinger's gunnery officer as the second ship in the British line and therefore assumed to be Princess Royal, at 16:16. Queen Mary hit Seydlitz again at 16:17 and knocked out one gun of her secondary armament. In return, Queen Mary had been hit twice by Seydlitz before 16:21 with unknown effects, but the German battlecruiser hit the turret face of 'Q' turret {{at that time and}} knocked out the right-hand gun in the turret. By 16:25 the range was down to , and Beatty turned two points to starboard to open the range again. This move came too late, however, for Queen Mary, as Derfflingers fire began to take effect, hitting her twice before 16:26. One shell hit forward and detonated {{one or both of the}} forward magazines, which broke the ship in two near the foremast. Stationed inside 'Q' turret, Midshipman Jocelyn Latham Storey survived and reported that there had been a large explosion forward which rocked the turret, breaking the left gun in half, the gun breech falling into the working chamber and the right gun coming off its trunnions. Cordite in the working chamber caught fire and produced poisonous fumes that asphyxiated some of the turret's crew. It is doubtful that an explosion forward could have done this, so 'Q' turret may have been struck by the second shell. A further explosion, possibly from shells breaking loose, shook the aft end of the ship as it began to roll over and sink. The battlecruiser behind her, , was showered with debris from the explosion and forced to steer to port to avoid her remains. 1,266 crewmen were lost; eighteen survivors were picked up by the destroyers , , and , and two by the Germans.|$|E

30|$|At {{the very}} moment one chooses not to follow what ātman indicates, one loses one’s śraddhā {{and the ability to}} {{recognize}} dharma.

These are the stories of the confusion about dharma in the Mahābhārata. Those who are ruled by the selfish motives rooted in the individual (ahaṃkāra) are not aware of their social and sacred inner nature, or ātman. They are not aware that ātman encompasses the individual, or ahaṃkāra. What the message of Kṛṣṇa a in the Gītā adds to the story of the Mahābhārata, therefore, is the theological sense that when the sattvic (pure) form of śraddhā is not manifest in a person’s heart, the consequence is the deterioration of all forms of life. For, the ability to recognize truth and the laws of nature comes from ātman by means of sattvic śraddhā.|$|R
