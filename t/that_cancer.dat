5|$|In 2008, Australian {{researcher}} Jean Williams claimed <b>that</b> <b>cancer</b> {{rates in}} the town of Innisfail, Queensland were 10 times higher than the state average due to secret testing of Agent Orange by the Australian military scientists during the Vietnam War. Williams, who had won the Order of Australia medal for her research on the effects of chemicals on U.S. war veterans, based her allegations on Australian government reports found in the Australian War Memorial's archives. A former soldier, Ted Bosworth, backed up the claims, saying that he had been involved in the secret testing. Neither Williams or Bosworth have produced verifiable evidence to support their claims. The Queensland health department determined <b>that</b> <b>cancer</b> rates in Innisfail were no higher than those {{in other parts of the}} state.|$|E
5|$|He {{continued}} his busy schedule, travelling to the United States, England, Finland, Canada and Japan, and sketching a violin concerto, {{but by the}} first week of 1994 it was clear <b>that</b> <b>cancer</b> had taken hold, and after an operation the composer weakened quickly and died on 7 February at the age of eighty-one. He had, a few weeks before, been awarded Poland's highest honour, the Order of the White Eagle (only the second person to receive this since the collapse of communism in Poland—the first had been Pope John Paul II). He was cremated; his devoted wife Danuta died shortly afterwards.|$|E
40|$|The concept <b>that</b> <b>cancers</b> {{arise from}} “embryonic rests” and contain cell populations capable of {{self-renewal}} was proposed 100 years ago (1). Only {{within the past}} decade, however, has the accumulating research pro-vided {{strong support for the}} cancer stem cell (CSC) 2 hypothesis.

Self-renewing “cancer stem cells ” maintain tumor growth and generate the diverse populations constituting the tumor bulk. TheCSChypothesis has tremendously im-portant clinical implications.

5|$|In 1986, Danish Prime Minister Poul Schlüter {{commissioned}} a radiological {{examination of the}} surviving workers.

5|$|The {{vascular}} (blood) {{system can}} be impacted by solid tumors. Between 15 and 25 percent of deep vein thrombosis is caused by cancer (often by a tumor compressing a vein), {{and it may be}} the first hint <b>that</b> <b>cancer</b> is present. It causes swelling and pain in the legs, especially the calf, and (rarely) in the arms. The superior vena cava (a large vein carrying circulating, de-oxygenated blood into the heart) may be compressed by a tumor, causing superior vena cava syndrome, which can cause chest wall pain among other symptoms.|$|E

50|$|The role of epigenetics {{in cancer}} {{has been the}} subject of {{intensive}} study. For the purposes of epigenetic therapy, the two key findings from this research are <b>that</b> <b>cancers</b> frequently use epigenetic mechanisms to deactivate cellular antitumor systems and <b>that</b> most human <b>cancers</b> epigenetically activate oncogenes, such as the MYC proto-oncogene, at some point in their development.

25|$|Cancer {{immunotherapy}} (Immuno-oncology or Immunooncology) {{is the use}} of {{the immune}} system to treat cancer. Immunotherapies can be categorized as active, passive or hybrid (active and passive). These approaches exploit the fact <b>that</b> <b>cancer</b> cells often have molecules on their surface that can be detected by the immune system, known as tumour-associated antigens (TAAs); they are often proteins or other macromolecules (e.g. carbohydrates). Active immunotherapy directs the immune system to attack tumor cells by targeting TAAs. Passive immunotherapies enhance existing anti-tumor responses and include the use of monoclonal antibodies, lymphocytes and cytokines.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} authors have {{questioned}} the assumption that cancers result from sequential random mutations as oversimplistic, suggesting instead <b>that</b> <b>cancer</b> results from {{a failure of the}} body to inhibit an innate, programmed proliferative tendency. A related theory developed by astrobiologists suggests <b>that</b> <b>cancer</b> is an atavism, an evolutionary throwback to an earlier form of multicellular life. The genes responsible for uncontrolled cell growth and cooperation between cancer cells are very similar to those that enabled the first multicellular life forms to group together and flourish. These genes still exist within the genome of more complex metazoans, such as humans, although more recently evolved genes keep them in check. When the newer controlling genes fail for whatever reason, the cell can revert to its more primitive programming and reproduce out of control. The theory is an alternative to the notion that cancers begin with rogue cells that undergo evolution within the body. Instead they possess a fixed number of primitive genes that are progressively activated, giving them finite variability. Another evolutionary theory puts the roots of cancer back to the origin of the eukarote (nucleated) cell by massive horizontal gene transfer, when the genomes of infecting viruses were cleaved (and thereby attenuated) by the host, but their fragments integrated into the host genome as immune protection. Cancer now originates when a rare somatic mutation recombines such fragments into a functional driver of cell proliferation.|$|E

25|$|Chromothripsis is the {{phenomenon}} by which up {{to thousands of}} clustered chromosomal rearrangements occur in a single event in localised and confined genomic regions in {{one or a few}} chromosomes, and is known to be involved in both cancer and congenital diseases. It occurs through one massive genomic rearrangement during a single catastrophic event in the cell's history. It is believed that for the cell to be able to withstand such a destructive event, the occurrence of such an event must be the upper limit of what a cell can tolerate and survive. The chromothripsis phenomenon opposes the conventional theory <b>that</b> <b>cancer</b> is the gradual acquisition of genomic rearrangements and somatic mutations over time.|$|E
25|$|An {{assessment}} by Health Canada found <b>that</b> <b>cancer</b> {{mortality rates}} are almost identical {{in the two}} countries. Another international comparison by the National Cancer Institute of Canada indicated that incidence rates for most, but not all, cancers {{were higher in the}} U.S. than in Canada during the period studied (1993–1997). Incidence rates for certain types, such as colorectal and stomach cancer, were actually higher in Canada than in the U.S. In 2004, researchers published a study comparing health outcomes in the Anglo countries. Their analysis indicates that Canada has greater survival rates for both colorectal cancer and childhood leukemia, while the United States has greater survival rates for Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma as well as breast and cervical cancer.|$|E
25|$|It was {{originally}} {{believed that there}} were two major pathways in colorectal cancer formation. The first was a chromosomal instability pathway thought to be responsible for the adenoma to carcinoma progression, which was characterized by loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on chromosome 5q, 17p and 18q. The second pathway was believed to be the microsatellite instability pathway, which is characterized by increases or decreases in the number of tandem repeats of simple DNA sequences. This type of instability is associated with some specific mutations, including genes involved with DNA mismatch repair and surprisingly, transforming growth factor-beta. More recently, those in the field of colorectal cancer have acknowledged <b>that</b> <b>cancer</b> formation is far more complex, but cancer related genes still tend to be categorized as chromosomal or microsatellite instability genes.|$|E
5000|$|Hill’s {{views on}} <b>cancer</b> {{treatment}} were <b>that</b> <b>cancers</b> should be radically excised aiming for cure, an approach {{in contrast to}} the mainstream view of leading European surgeons such as Alexander Monro primus, Samuel Sharp (c1709- 1778) and Henri François Le Dran (1685-1770) <b>that</b> <b>cancers</b> should only be minimally excised to relieve symptoms. He was able to review the outcome of surgery in 88 patients, 86 of whom recovered from the procedure and 77 of these enjoyed a normal expectation of life ‘according to the bills of mortality.’ These outcomes were much superior to the documented results of, for example, Alexander Monro primus. The cancers concerned were mainly skin cancers and a few breast cancers and Hill acknowledges the diﬃculty in dierentiating some cancers from benign lesions in the era before histological examination. He concludes that his results justify his recommendation that tumours, including ‘the most triﬂing,’ should be ‘cut entirely out.’ ...|$|R
40|$|An {{increasing}} body {{of research}} is showing <b>that</b> <b>cancers</b> might contain their own stem cells.

Now, evidence has shown <b>that</b> brain <b>cancers,</b> such as glioblastomas, medulloblastomas and astrocytomas, also contain cells that may be multipotent neural stem cell-like cells.

25|$|Malignant Tumor cells perform {{glycolysis}} at a {{rate that}} is ten times faster than their noncancerous tissue counterparts. During their genesis, limited capillary support often results in hypoxia (decreased O2 supply) within the tumor cells. Thus, these cells rely on anaerobic metabolic processes such as glycolysis for ATP. Some tumor cells overexpress specific glycolytic enzymes which results in higher rates of glycolysis. Often these enzymes are Isoenzymes, of traditional glycolysis enzymes, that vary in their susceptibility to traditional feedback inhibition. The increase in glycolytic activity ultimately counteracts the effects of hypoxia by generating sufficient ATP from this anaerobic pathway. This phenomenon was first described in 1930 by Otto Warburg and {{is referred to as the}} Warburg effect. The Warburg hypothesis claims <b>that</b> <b>cancer</b> is primarily caused by dysfunctionality in mitochondrial metabolism, rather than because of uncontrolled growth of cells.|$|E
25|$|In 1965, a major {{breakthrough}} in cancer therapy occurred. James F. Holland, Emil Freireich, and Emil Frei hypothesized <b>that</b> <b>cancer</b> chemotherapy should follow the strategy of antibiotic therapy for tuberculosis with combinations of drugs, each with a different mechanism of action. Cancer cells could conceivably mutate to become resistant to a single agent, but by using different drugs concurrently {{it would be more}} difficult for the tumor to develop resistance to the combination. Holland, Freireich, and Frei simultaneously administered methotrexate (an antifolate), vincristine (a Vinca alkaloid), 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and prednisone — together referred to as the POMP regimen — and induced long-term remissions in children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). With incremental refinements of original regimens, using randomized clinical studies by St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, the Medical Research Council in the UK (UKALL protocols) and German Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster clinical trials group (ALL-BFM protocols), ALL in children has become a largely curable disease.|$|E
25|$|Hydrazine sulfate was {{specifically}} {{developed as a}} result of a proposal by Joseph Gold for a therapy that could offset the rapid loss of weight that occurs in cancer (cancer cachexia). This hypothesis was based on the fact <b>that</b> <b>cancer</b> cells are often unusually dependent on glycolysis for energy (the Warburg effect), Gold proposed that the body might offset this increased glycolysis using gluconeogenesis, which is the pathway that is the reverse of glycolysis. Since this process would require a great deal of energy, Gold thought that inhibiting gluconeogenesis might reverse this energy requirement and be an effective treatment for cancer cachexia. Hydrazine is a reactive chemical that in the test tube can inactivate one of the enzymes needed for gluconeogenesis, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEP-CK). It was also postulated that if tumor energy gain (glycolysis) and host-energy loss (gluconeogenesis) were functionally interrelated, inhibition of gluconeogenesis at PEP CK could result in actual tumor regression in addition to reversal or arrest of cancer cachexia. In this model, hydrazine sulfate is therefore thought to act by irreversibly inhibiting the enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase.|$|E

25|$|Much smaller {{incidental}} {{doses of}} iodine-131 than {{those used in}} medical therapeutic procedures, are supposed by some studies to be the major cause of increased thyroid cancers after accidental nuclear contamination. These studies suppose <b>that</b> <b>cancers</b> happen from residual tissue radiation damage caused by the I-131, and should appear mostly years after exposure, long after the I-131 has decayed. Other studies can't find a correlation.|$|R
25|$|The {{cells in}} which all these DNA {{alterations}} accumulate are difficult to trace, but two recent lines of evidence suggest that normal stem cells may be the cells of origin in cancers. First, there exists a highly positive correlation (Spearman’s rho = 0.81; P < 3.5 × 10−8) between {{the risk of developing}} cancer in a tissue and the number of normal stem cell divisions taking place in that same tissue. The correlation applied to 31 cancer types and extended across five orders of magnitude. This correlation means that if the normal stem cells from a tissue divide once, the cancer risk in that tissue is approximately 1X. If they divide 1,000 times, the cancer risk is 1,000X. And if the normal stem cells from a tissue divide 100,000 times, the cancer risk in that tissue is approximately 100,000X. This strongly suggests that the main reason we have cancer is that our normal stem cells divide, which implies <b>that</b> <b>cancer</b> originates in normal stem cells. Second, statistics show that most human cancers are diagnosed in aged people. A possible explanation is that cancers occur because cells accumulate damage through time. DNA is the only cellular component that can accumulate damage over the entire course of a life, and stem cells are the only cells that can transmit DNA from the zygote to cells late in life. Other cells cannot keep DNA from the beginning of life until a possible cancer occurs. This implies that most cancers arise from normal stem cells.|$|E
