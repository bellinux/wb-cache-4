500|$|Tifa was {{designed}} to use the [...] "monk" [...] character class that appears in previous games in the series. She has long, black hair in a style resembling a dolphin's tail at the tip, and garments described as simple and monotone, consisting of a white tank top and black miniskirt. She also wears red boots and gloves, and sleeves extend up her arms from her wrists to her elbows, with suspenders connecting her skirt <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulders,</b> and a large metal guard covering her left elbow. She stands about 5feet 6inches (167cm) tall, and has measurements of 36-24-35" [...] (92-60-88cm).|$|E
500|$|The body, {{dressed in}} a black sweater and yellow skirt, was soon {{identified}} as the missing Patricia Jones. Jones had been hit with four shots from a [...]22 caliber pistol. Although the fatal wound was a shot to Jones's head, entering near her mouth on an upward trajectory, she also had one through and through bullet wound to her abdomen and two penetrating gunshot wounds <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulders</b> on a downward trajectory through her body. Powder burns on the hemline of her skirt, which had been raised to her waist, indicated that the gun had been fired from close range at least once. Initial reports and investigation placed Jones's time of death at approximately 9 p.m. on May 27.|$|E
500|$|The seventh {{match was}} between Melina and Torrie Wilson (managed by Candice Michelle, {{who was also}} the guest referee), in a Bra and Panties match. The only way to win a [...] "Bra and Panties" [...] match is for a wrestler to strip her {{opponent}} down to her underwear. At {{the start of the}} match, Melina pulled off Wilson's shirt to reveal her bra, but Wilson retaliated and pulled off Melina's shirt. Wilson then lifted Melina <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulders</b> and dropped her to the mat, while she attempted to pull off her pants, but Melina countered the attack by pulling Wilson's pants off to win the match. Afterward, Michelle stripped Melina and then removed her own clothes, as well.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, I {{have said}} it," [...] she whispered, without lifting her head. Lingard made a brusque {{movement}} at her elbow and bent his head close <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder.</b>|$|R
60|$|She {{patted her}} hair into place, and, in {{adjusting}} a hair-pin, permitted a long, thick tress <b>to</b> escape <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder.</b> She uttered a little squeal of dismay.|$|R
500|$|Western Chalukyan deity sculptures were well-rendered; {{exemplified}} best {{by that of}} Hindu goddess Sarasvati at the Sarasvati {{temple in}} Gadag city. Much of the drapery on the bust of the image is ornamentation comprising jewellery made of pearls around her throat. An elaborate pile of curls forms her hair, some of which trails <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulders.</b> [...] Above these curly tresses and behind the head is a tiered coronet of jewels, the curved edge of which rises to form a halo. From the waist down, the image is dressed in {{what seems to be}} the most delicate of material; except for the pattern of embroidery traced over it, it is difficult to tell where the drapery begins and where it ends.|$|E
500|$|The {{official}} {{music video}} {{for the cover}} premiered on Oprah.com on February 28 at midnight, followed by an exclusive interview. It was directed by Peter Zavadil. After her first performance of the song on Unplugged on the Country Music Television, McEntire also performed the song at the Country Music Association (CMA) awards on November 10, 2010. Mawuse Ziegbe of MTV News praised her cover, writing, [...] "Singing with no band onstage, donning a glittery black dress with her signature red hair flowing <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulders,</b> the legendary vocalist's performance scored a standing ovation." [...] Jillian Mapes and Megan Vick of Billboard praised the performance, writing, [...] "As if Beyonce's 2008 ballad 'If I Were a Boy' wasn't moving enough, country queen Reba McEntire's smokey twang and solemn stance turned the song on its head." [...] They {{also noted that the}} simple and powerful performance [...] "is enough to inspire tears, or at least goosebumps." [...] Country Music Television's Chet Flippo felt that McEntire's performance was [...] "the musical highlight of the evening" [...] and added that it was [...] "a lesson of what country music should be striving for these days". Jon Caramanica of The New York Times gave a mixed review of her performance, writing that [...] " [...] did something unexpected, softening her delivery and finding the creases in the song, as if Beyoncé were whispering to her from the wings." [...] However, Entertainment Weeklys Mandi Bierly wrote that the lyrics were [...] "just too young for , {{and when it comes to}} the chorus, I want someone to belt it".|$|E
2500|$|Marie-Angélique {{created the}} famous fashion of Fontanges: during a hunt {{in the forest}} of Fontainebleau, her hair clung to a branch and she {{appeared}} before the king with her hair loosely tied in a ribbon, tumbling in curls <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulders.</b> The king found this [...] "rustic" [...] style delightful. The next day, all the courtiers adopted this hairstyle, except the Marquise de Montespan, who thought her hairstyle was in [...] "bad taste". The bitterness between Athénaïs and Marie {{went as far as}} Athénaïs releasing her two tame bears which she kept in a little menagerie Louis had given her in the grounds of the palace, and [...] "accidentally," [...] the two bears went to destroy Marie's apartment in Versailles. This event made both women comical at court.|$|E
50|$|Yao {{competed in}} the Chinese Nationals in May but failed to medal due <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> injury. She was {{left out of the}} Olympic squad for the 2016 Summer Olympics.|$|R
50|$|Determined to find Hunt {{and finish}} him off, Turner finally shoots and kills him {{after a long}} and violent {{confrontation}} and a bullet wound <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder.</b> She is then taken away by fellow police officers.|$|R
5000|$|On September 29, 1996, Bernadette Moore, age 34, {{sustained}} injuries <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> {{and back}} after a police ride in which she reported that the driver was [...] "swerving and slamming on the brakes". She was later awarded $15,000.|$|R
60|$|Dick at once arose, {{placed the}} kettle of soup {{close to the}} old woman's side, and unbuckling his saddle-girth, removed the blanket that covered his saddle, and {{transferred}} it <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulders.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll do it, of course," [...] said Mrs. Melbury, {{taking off}} her silk train, hanging {{it up to}} a nail, {{carefully}} rolling back her sleeves, pinning them <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulders,</b> and stripping Giles of his apron for her own use.|$|E
60|$|So saying, Roy {{threw the}} lines of the sledge over his {{shoulder}} and led the way, followed by his sister, whose only burden was a light blanket, fastened as a bundle <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulders,</b> and a small tin can, which hung at her belt.|$|E
6000|$|... 'O la! what dreadful {{thing is}} it?' she exclaimed, and beheld a cow of Loveday's, {{of the name}} of Crumpler, {{standing}} close <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder.</b> It being about milking-time, she had come to look up David and hasten on the operation.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come along," [...] {{said the}} latter, and she quickly took him and undressed him. Then she picked him up, and his bare legs hung {{down in front}} of her. His head drooped drowsily on <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder,</b> against <b>her</b> neck.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dead!" [...] replied Mrs. Clirehugh. [...] "Dead o' the influenza. 'E's to {{be buried}} to-day. I can't--I can't--I can't--" [...] Wild choking stopped her utterance. Mrs. Gerhardt put an arm round her and drew <b>her</b> head on <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder.</b>|$|R
60|$|My {{suggestion}} was acted on {{the moment we}} returned to the house. Miss Halcombe led me round to the servants' offices, and we found the girl in the dairy, with her sleeves tucked up <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulders,</b> cleaning a large milk-pan and singing blithely over her work.|$|E
60|$|The Story Girl was barefooted and barearmed, having {{rolled the}} sleeves of her pink gingham up <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulders.</b> Around her waist was twisted a girdle of the blood-red roses that bloomed in Aunt Olivia's garden; on her sleek curls she wore a chaplet of them; and her hands were full of them.|$|E
60|$|Sarah Ann hastily {{poured a}} few cupfuls {{of water into}} the kettle, then she put down both {{utensils}} and stood holding her bare arms to warm them. Her chief garment consisted of a skirt with grey bodice and red flannel skirt, very much torn. Her black hair hung in wild tails on <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulders.</b>|$|E
60|$|Margaret pushed Jimmy {{back and}} put the rifle <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder.</b> A sharp report rolled across the clearing, twigs fell from a quivering pine branch, and the trooper {{vanished}} in the woods. Jimmy's hands shook, but his relief was keen.|$|R
60|$|At {{first sight}} of the man she had been {{positive}} {{that he would be}} torn to pieces, and she had half risen from her shelter, raising <b>her</b> rifle <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>to</b> do what she could to avert the man's terrible fate.|$|R
6000|$|... "Watch and pray, dear, {{never get}} tired of trying, and never think it is {{impossible}} to conquer your fault," [...] said Mrs. March, drawing the blowzy head <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> and kissing the wet cheek so tenderly that Jo cried even harder.|$|R
60|$|Nor was he mistaken: for a widow lady, {{with her}} {{sleeves rolled up}} <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulders,</b> and her arms frothy with soap-suds and smoking with hot water, replied to the summons with startling rapidity. Before she looked at Walter {{she looked at the}} knocker, and then, {{measuring}} him with her eyes from head to foot, said she wondered he had left any of it.|$|E
60|$|The {{woman was}} {{clad in a}} {{straight}} and narrow robe, cut low beneath her breast. Her face was mild and beautiful, and {{in her right hand}} she held a looped sceptre. Her hair descended in many long plaits on <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulders.</b> For head-dress she wore two horns, supporting between them a burnished disc of gold like to that of the moon when it is full.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, don't!" [...] {{said the}} other. [...] "It chokes {{me to be}} bundled up so tight." [...] She shrugged the shawl down <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulders</b> with a pretty petulance. [...] "If my chest's protected, that's all that's necessary." [...] But she made no motion to drape the outline which her neatly-fitted dress displayed, {{and she did not}} move from her place, or look up at her anxious friend.|$|E
60|$|Yet Father wasn't {{altogether}} {{satisfied with}} his fire. The dry twigs he kept feeding to it flared up and were gone. The Innocents huddled together, {{closer and closer to}} the coals. Father gave little pats <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> while she shivered and began to look anxious.|$|R
60|$|The colour in Miss Mallow's cheeks spread <b>to</b> <b>her</b> sloping <b>shoulders.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "You may, darling; this is {{the place}} where little {{troubles}} are best cured, and this is what mothers are for, I fancy"; and Aunt Jessie drew the curly head <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> with a tender look that proved how well she knew what medicine the child most needed.|$|R
60|$|She was unnoticed, and her sudden return had plainly {{not been}} expected. During {{the short time}} of Cytherea's absence, Miss Aldclyffe had pulled off a kind of chemisette of Brussels net, drawn high above the throat, which she had worn with her evening dress as a semi-opaque {{covering}} <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulders,</b> and in its place had put her night-gown round her. Her right hand was lifted to her neck, as if engaged in fastening her night-gown.|$|E
60|$|Dorothy let {{the maids}} pin ribbons <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulders,</b> {{after which they}} were ready for the King's dinner. When they met the shaggy man in the splendid drawing-room of the palace they found him {{just the same as}} before. He had refused to give up his shaggy clothes for new ones, because if he did that he would no longer be the shaggy man, he said, and he might have to get acquainted with himself all over again.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked up}} as Iskander entered. Her large dark eyes glanced through his soul. Her raven hair descended <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulders</b> in many curls {{on each side of}} her face, and was braided with strings of immense pearls. A broad cap of white fox-skin crowned her whiter forehead. Her {{features}} were very small, but sharply moulded, and a delicate tint gave animation to her clear fair cheek. She {{looked up as}} Iskander entered, with an air rather of curiosity than embarrassment.|$|E
60|$|On {{reaching}} the bedroom, {{we heard the}} voice of Miss Scatcherd: she was examining drawers; she had just pulled out Helen Burns's, and when we entered Helen was greeted with a sharp reprimand, and told that to-morrow she should have half-a-dozen of untidily folded articles pinned <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder.</b>|$|R
60|$|She gave {{a little}} moan of anguish and despair and turned <b>her</b> face <b>to</b> <b>her</b> chairback. <b>Her</b> <b>shoulders</b> shook with weeping, but she listened. He went <b>to</b> <b>her</b> and stood {{with his hand on}} the chairback.|$|R
50|$|Thom {{played for}} Team USA, the United States {{national}} softball {{team in the}} summer of 2013. She started as the second baseman in her first game at the World Cup. Thom sat out the following summer to recover from an injury <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>shoulder</b> that she sustained her senior year.|$|R
