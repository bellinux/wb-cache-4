5|$|Because of the {{commercial}} success of Enamorada de Ti, Capitol Latin confirmed a trilogy of Selena remix/duet albums. In May 2012, Capitol Latin confirmed an English-language followup. By February 2012, Canadian singer Michael Bublé was confirmed as one of many other artists who expressed interest in recording a duet with Selena. In late August 2012, fans were asked <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> survey from the official Selena Facebook page, inviting them to choose three Latin singers and three non-Latin singers {{they would like to}} see recording a duet with Selena on the follow-up album. Guerra suggested La Mafia's Oscar de la Rosa, Jennifer Lopez, Blake Shelton, Drake, Bruno Mars and Beyoncé Knowles.|$|E
5|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Francis Lawrence and produced by Caleb Dewart of DNA Inc. The video deals directly with the lyrics' theme of Stefani's search for inspiration in songwriting. It opens with a lengthy non-musical section in which Stefani arrives in Los Angeles off of No Doubt's Rock Steady Tour. She receives several calls from Interscope label head Jimmy Iovine, who attempts to push her forward with her solo debut project, but she replies that she is tired and uninspired. After a failed studio attempt, Stefani sees a flyer advertising help for writer's block. Upon arrival she is asked <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> suspicious questionnaire, where the camera pans to the questions which will be important. She is then told {{that she will be}} billed when she is finished. She asks for clarification only to discover that she is already back in the studio by herself. When Stefani picks up an oversized pocket watch from the piano, a rabbit knick-knack that she had previously seen jumps across the room. She throws the watch at the knick-knack, causing her to fall back on her chair and find herself transported to a fantasy world based on Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass.|$|E
5|$|Staley met guitarist Jerry Cantrell at a {{party in}} Seattle around August 1987. A few months before that, Cantrell had watched a concert of Staley's then-band, Alice N' Chains, in his {{hometown}} at the Tacoma Little Theatre and was impressed by his voice. Cantrell was homeless after being kicked out of his family's house, so Staley invited Cantrell to live with him at the rehearsal studio Music Bank, and the two struggling musicians became roommates. Alice N' Chains soon disbanded, and Staley joined a funk band. Cantrell's band, Diamond Lie, broke up and he wanted to form a new band, so Staley gave him the phone number of Melinda Starr, the girlfriend of drummer Sean Kinney, so that Cantrell could talk to him. Cantrell called the number and set up a meeting with Kinney. Kinney and his girlfriend went to the Music Bank and listened to Cantrell's demos, who mentioned that they needed a bass player to jam with them, and he had someone in mind: Mike Starr, with whom Cantrell had played in a band in Burien called Gypsy Rose. Kinney then mentioned that his girlfriend was actually Mike Starr's sister, and that he had been playing in bands together with Starr since they were kids. Kinney called Starr and a few days later he started jamming with him and Cantrell at the Music Bank, but they didn't have a singer. Staley's funk band also required a guitarist at the time, and Staley asked Cantrell to join as a sideman. Cantrell agreed on condition that Staley join his band, because Cantrell, Starr and Kinney wanted Staley to be their lead singer, so they started auditioning terrible lead singers in front of Staley to send a hint. The last straw for Staley was when they auditioned a male stripper – he decided to join the band after that. Eventually the funk project broke up, and in 1987 Staley joined Cantrell's band on a full-time basis. Two weeks after the band's formation, they were playing a gig at the University of Washington, trying <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> 40-minute set with a couple of original material along with Hanoi Rocks and David Bowie covers.|$|E

25|$|Badger (voiced by Andy Cunningham, {{operated}} by Andy Cunningham + others) - Badger {{is named after}} what he is - a badger. He is anthropomorphic - {{he has the ability}} to talk and wears smaller versions of human clothes (including his trademark red beret and red and white patterned neckerchief) and is obsessed with mashed potato, which he likes to play with as well as eat. Because he has a low, booming voice, he has a laugh that's similar to boxer Frank Bruno. He gets Simon into trouble much of the time by playing around with mashed potato because some of the characters do not know about Badger, so instead Simon gets the blame for Badger's mishaps. It is Badger's child-like inability to continually behave that gets him into trouble with Simon, when Simon has to take the blame for many of Badger's antics to try and keep Badger secret. However Badger is still a very good friend to Simon and tries to help him out every way he can. All this said, however, Badger still exhibits the natural instincts of a badger beyond simply his physical limitations by being a badger. For example he still pinches and eats various items that he isn't supposed to in situations when it isn't exactly helpful. On two occasions he has eaten smashed up cake at completely inappropriate times and on another he ate a biro pen when Bodger got one out <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> job application form. He can also run very fast (badgers can run up to 19mph) and can frequently be heard scuttling away from any given situation or location.|$|E

In most of the film Perry Como is called Eddie Anders and toward the end (for no reason) they start calling him Perry Como." [...] Como asked for and received a release from the remainder of his movie contract in the same year. Quoting Como, [...] "I was wasting their time and they were wasting mine." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1875, {{the manager}} of the Royalty Theatre, Richard D'Oyly Carte, needed a short piece <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> bill with Offenbach's La Périchole. [...] Carte had {{conducted}} Sullivan's Cox and Box. Remembering that Gilbert had suggested a libretto to him, Carte reunited Gilbert and Sullivan, and the result was the one-act comic opera Trial by Jury. Trial, starring Sullivan's brother Fred as the Learned Judge, became a surprise hit, earning glowing praise from the critics and playing for 300 performances over its first few seasons. The Daily Telegraph commented that the piece illustrated the composer's [...] "great capacity for dramatic writing of the lighter class", and other reviews emphasised the felicitous combination of Gilbert's words and Sullivan's music. One wrote, [...] "it seems, as in the great Wagnerian operas, as though poem and music had proceeded simultaneously from one and the same brain." [...] Soon after the opening of Trial, Sullivan wrote The Zoo, another one-act comic opera, with a libretto by B. C. Stephenson. But the latter work had only a few short runs, and for the next 15 years Sullivan's sole operatic collaborator was Gilbert; the two created an additional 12 operas together.|$|E

500|$|In the 1990s, the {{television}} industry made wide use of spec scripts, or episode scripts solicited from freelance writers. While The X-Files {{had a large}} staff of writers, the staff would occasionally {{have to take a}} risk on a teleplay written by an unaffiliated writer <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> full season order. [...] "Sanguinarium" [...] was such a case, being written by sisters Vivian Mayhew and Valerie Mayhew. This marked their first experience with writing a one-hour network program, and they would later write several episodes in {{the television}} series Charmed. Prior to having their script picked up by the series, the sisters asked staff writers Glen Morgan and James Wong for writing suggestions. Morgan and Wong told them that [...] "the scariest things are those which repeat every day". Soon thereafter, Vivian was paged by a number she did not recognize. She realized that pagers in their own way are scary, because an unknown person can connect to the pager's owner. The Mayhews then went from focusing on pagers to the group of people who normally use them: doctors. It was then that they realized a plot about doctors losing control and being bewitched could make for a good episode. After writing their spec script, they presented it to Morgan and Wong, who suggested they change the villain from a woman to a man as [...] "plastic surgery is related to vanity, and everyone expects that from a woman, but not a man." [...] After the script was submitted, it was selected to become a full episode.|$|E
