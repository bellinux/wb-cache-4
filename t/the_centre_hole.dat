25|$|The four {{fingers of}} the left hand can each be used {{in at least two}} {{different}} positions, three {{in the case of the}} index finger. The key normally operated by this finger is primarily used for E4. (Rarely it can be used as a trill key.) This key has a small hole drilled into it. The player can lift the finger completely off the key, or press the key down, closing the hole. A third possibility is to slide the finger down, so the key remains closed, but the hole is open. The middle finger typically stays on <b>the</b> <b>centre</b> <b>hole</b> on the tenor joint. It can also move to a lever used for E4 and a rarely-used trill key. The ring finger operates, on most models, one key. Some models, like a Polisi Artist bassoon, have two assignments. The upper assignment is used for alternate fingerings in the alto register. The smallest finger operates two side keys on the bass joint. The lower key is typically used for C1. The upper key is used for E1, E3, F3, F3, A4, B4, B4, C4, C4, and D4.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} near to {{the surface}} and bulk residual stress distributions in a new rail measured by using an integrated incremental centre-deep hole drilling technique. It was found that <b>the</b> incremental <b>centre</b> <b>hole</b> drilling and deep hole drilling worked well as complementary techniques. The residual stresses measured by using the integrated drilling technique were compared with residual stresses measured by neutron diffraction and the two sets of results were found to be in good agreement. Particularly, a very good match was seen in the web, where the effect of cutting the rail for ND measurements was the lowest. As it can be applied to an uncut rail, the integrated incremental centre-deep hole drilling technique is better suited for residual stress measurement in rails...|$|R
40|$|The ESR {{absorption}} spectra at room temp. and reduced pressure of 10 - 2 Torr of six forms of type Y-zeolite, NaY, NaNiY (1), NaScY (2), NaScY (3), NaZrY (D), NaZrY (5) were investigated {{before and after}} treatment with different organic reagents. These zeolites were also exposed to r-irradiation at 77 °K with and without cumene. It was found that at room temperature and under reduced pressure of 10 - 2 Torr, these samples showed no electron spin resonance (ESR) signals. The introduction by injection of microamounts of reagents to the scandium and zirconium forms led to {{the appearance of a}} single narrow line in the ESR spectrum, its intensity depends on the nature of reagent. On the other hand, these reagents gave no signal with the NaY and NaNiY (1). After r-irradiation at 77 °K, NaY and NaNiY (1) gave an intense single line from an electron-centre. In the case of the scandium and zirconium forms, besides the intense line, a second broad unresolved one appeared, which may be related to <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> <b>centres.</b> <b>The</b> introduction of cumene on the zeolite followed by r-irradiation showed different ESR behaviour. For NaY and NaNiY (1), besides a single line from electron-centres, another sharp signal with a five line hyperfine structure was also observed. In the case of the zirconium forms, the latter signal decreased with the appearance of a weak broad line from <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> <b>centres.</b> In <b>the</b> case of the catalytically active scandium forms, only a line from electron-centres and a less intense broad one from <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> <b>centres</b> were detected...|$|R

5000|$|Until the 19th century, coins {{denominated}} in wen were cast, {{the most}} common formation being the round-shaped copper coin with a square or circular <b>hole</b> in <b>the</b> <b>centre.</b> <b>The</b> <b>hole</b> enabled the coins to be strung together to create higher denominations, as was frequently done due to the coin's low value.

[...] Each string of cash was divided in ten sections of 100. The person who strung the cash into a string took one, two, or three cash per hundred, depending on local custom, as payment for his effort. So, in fact, an ounce of silver could vary in exchange from 970 to 990 cash (or more) between two places fairly close together. In places in the North where there was a shortage of coinage a string of 500 or 500 exchanged for an ounce of silver. Paper money sometimes showed pictures of the appropriate number of 1 wén coins strung together.|$|R

5000|$|The {{left thumb}} alone {{operates}} nine keys. B1, B1, C1, D1, D4, C4 (also B4), two keys when combined create A4, and the whisper key. Additional notes {{can be created}} with these keys. The D1 and bottom key above whisper key on the tenor joint creates both C2 and C3. The same bottom tenor-joint key is also used, with additional fingering setup on the instrument, to create E4 and F4. D4 and C4 together create C4. When the two keys on the tenor joint to create A4 are used with slightly altered fingering on the boot joint, B4 is created. The whisper key is used throughout the instrument's register, along with other fingerings, to produce either a more muted or more piercing sound. The right thumb operates four keys. The top lever, which is very thin, is used to produce B2 and B3, and is used in B4, C4, D4, F4, and E4. The large, circular key (otherwise known as the [...] "pancake key"), is used in mostly the bass register. From B1 to E1, it is held constantly. It is also used, like the whisper key, in additional fingerings for muting the sound. For example, in Ravel's [...] "Boléro", the bassoon is asked to play the ostinato on G4. This is easy to perform with the normal fingering for G4, but with the E1 key (pancake key). The next key operated by the right thumb {{is known as the}} [...] "spatula key". Its primary use is to produce F1 and F2. The bottom key is used the least often. With the combination of the backmost key of the right hand little finger it produces A1 and A2. This is most advantageous in pieces like Dukas's [...] "The Sorcerer's Apprentice". The four fingers of the left hand can each be used in at least two different positions, three {{in the case of the}} index finger. The key normally operated by this finger is primarily used for E4. (Rarely it can be used as a trill key.) This key has a small hole drilled into it. The player can lift the finger completely off the key, or press the key down, closing the hole. A third possibility is to slide the finger down, so the key remains closed, but the hole is open. The middle finger typically stays on <b>the</b> <b>centre</b> <b>hole</b> on the tenor joint. It can also move to a lever used for E4 and a rarely-used trill key. The ring finger operates, on most models, one key. Some models, like a Polisi Artist bassoon, have two assignments. The upper assignment is used for alternate fingerings in the alto register. The smallest finger operates two side keys on the bass joint. The lower key is typically used for C1. The upper key is used for E1, E3, F3, F3, A4, B4, B4, C4, C4, and D4. The four fingers of the right hand have at least one assignment each. The index finger stays over one hole, except when E4 is played. A side key at the top of the boot is used. The middle finger remains stationary over the hole with a ring around it. The ring, with other pads, are lifted when the smallest finger on the right hands pushes a lever. The ring finger typically remains stationary on the lower ring-finger key. However, the upper ring-finger key can be used in place of the top thumb key on the front of the boot joint. The smallest finger operates three keys. The backmost one, closest to the bassoonist, is held down throughout most of the bass register. The key is not used after F1 is played. F2 is created with this key, as well as G4, B4, B4, and C4. The lowest key for the smallest finger on the right hand is primarily used for A1 and 2, but can be used E4, and F4. The frontmost key is used with the bottom thumb key on the boot joint to create A1 and A2.|$|E
40|$|Unilateral intrastriatal and intra-medial {{forebrain}} bundle {{injections of}} 6 -OHDA impair the {{performance in a}} lateralised choice reaction time task. However, the extent and pattern of deficits after nigral 6 -OHDA injections is less well studied, {{as well as the}} impact of training regime or the modification of various task parameters. The nigral 6 -OHDA lesion resulted in impaired response accuracy and an increased time to react to and execute the response on the side contralateral to the lesion as compared to sham-lesioned controls. Pre-training of the rats on the task prior to the lesion resulted in slightly faster reaction times as well as a reduced number of preservative panel presses compared to when rats were trained after the 6 -OHDA injection. When the rat had to perform a longer sustained nose poke before responding to the lateralised stimuli, the number of useable trials was reduced in both controls and 6 -OHDA rats {{as a result of an}} increased number of premature withdrawals from <b>the</b> <b>centre</b> <b>hole.</b> This study demonstrates that rats with a nigral 6 -OHDA lesion display several distinct deficits in this operant task, which are similar to those seen after striatal and bundle 6 -OHDA injections. In addition, by combining pre-training with the use of a short set of holds, improved sensitivity of this task can be achieved. This improvement in sensitivity may be of advantage when exploring new therapeutic interventions for PD, where subtle but relevant changes in performance may arise. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Previous {{research}} has established that dopamine signals are crucial in orienting behavior to reward. Less is known, however, about the psychopharmacology of task performance under small-reward conditions {{as compared to}} large-reward conditions. The current study {{examined the effects of}} the noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) -receptor antagonist dizocilpine (MK- 801) on reaction time (RT) in a nose-poke task with rats completing an asymmetric reward schedule. In all trials, the rats were required to poke their nose in either the left or the right peripheral hole immediately adjacent to <b>the</b> <b>centre</b> <b>hole</b> when the corresponding light was illuminated. Depending on the stimulus-reward mapping, however, one position was associated with a large reward, while the alternative position was associated with a small reward. Correct performance was required in every trial; if the rat did not make a correct response within 20 s, the trial was aborted, and the same stimulus was presented again on the next trial. In this way, the rat was forced to perform the same visuo-spatial discrimination task under different reward conditions. Reaction times (ms) were faster for large-reward trials than for small-reward trials, replicating previous findings. At a dosage of MK- 801 (0. 04 mg/kg), there was no significant influence of on RT in large-reward trials. In contrast, the same dosage of MK- 801 in small-reward trials produced a decrease in RT as compared to the control condition, implying an improvement of performance. Below 0. 04 mg/kg of MK- 801, a steady decrease of RT in small-trials was seen as a function of dosage. Above 0. 04 mg/kg of MK- 801, the majority of rats failed to perform the task at all, whereas the rats that did manage to perform the criterion of 80 correct trials in a session showed no difference in RT between large- and small-reward trials. These data indicate that the systemic administration of a relatively small dosage of MK- 801 facilitates performance when reward is small. It is suggested that the facilitation {{may be due to the}} reinforcement of mechanisms that work in opposition to response bias. As a corollary, the study provides a useful paradigm to study the voluntary control of unavoidable action...|$|E
40|$|The {{production}} of silver chain {{is a high}} volume business. Traditionally Silver chain is produced using two methods of production. In the USA a solid wire with a solder core is used. In this process a large billet is cast and then drilled down its centre. A solder is then melted into <b>the</b> <b>centre</b> <b>hole</b> before the billet is reduced by rolling and drawing to the final size required for the chain. After the links of the chain have been formed it is passed through a furnace to melt the solder in the core, which then flows out and joins the links. A method called “powder packing” is used in most other jewellery production centres in the world. In this method a solid wire is first drawn and then formed on a chain-making machine. To join the chain a zinc powder is packed between each link and the complete chain is then passed through a furnace. Both of the standard production methods for silver chain are time consuming and expensive for different reasons. Gold chain by contrast is generally joined using lasers. The lasers are mounted directly on the chain-making machine and as each link is formed, the laser fires a single shot to the join link. Up to four hundred links a minute can be joined and when the chain leaves the chain-making machine, no further work is required. Standard sterling silver because of high conductivity and reflectivity has not proved to be suitable for laser joining. It does not produce welds with sufficient strength. EP 1699581 describes a method of making chain more efficiently with silver copper germanium alloys, using a laser to join the links. Silver is the most conductive of all metals {{and this is one}} reason it is difficult to weld. The addition of germanium to sterling silver increases the thermal and heat resistivity of the alloy. A resistive alloy traps the energy and welds more efficiently. Steel {{is a good example of}} a resistive metal that welds easily The infrared spectrum of the germanium also aids the laser light to couple with the silver. Sterling silver normally will reflect the majority of the laser power away from its surface...|$|E
40|$|The overall aim of {{the present}} {{investigation}} is to adopt a fundamental approach towards the identification, measurement and modelling {{of the effect of}} pre- and post-processing upon shot-peening residual stresses. At present this is carried out in an ad hoc fashion with little understanding of the fundamental properties which are being affected by these treatments and of how these basic properties influence product performance and determine (the peening) process parameters. Indeed, current concern of reliability and efficiency of machinery alone justifies the widespread interest in the present investigation. The specific objectives arising from the above overall aim can be summarised as follows: (i) to identify, measure and model the effect of pre-processing upon the locked-in residual stress field and surface morphology of a prospective peening component, (ii) to identify, measure and synthesize the effect of shot-peening treatment upon the resulting stress field and surface profile of the treated component, (iii) to identify, measure and model the effect of post-processing upon the aforementioned parameters, and (iv) to examine the effect of residual stresses and incomplete-coverage upon ultimate product performance. Consideration of the surface profile will be accounted for in the analysis. The outcome of these investigations should provide the foundation necessary for process control and optimisation of working surfaces of components currently employed in aerospace, automotive and power generation industries. Accordingly a number of investigations will be carried out, in parallel, to highlight these effects. In view of the large number of variables involved in these processes, we focus our attention to the following: for pre-processing, controlled turning was selected and for post-processing, controlled grinding was selected. Residual stress measurements were performed by <b>the</b> <b>centre</b> <b>hole</b> air-abrasive off-centre rotating nozzle method, and whenever possible, the results were verified by other methods such as X-ray diffraction and etching. An experimental rig was designed, built and commissioned to allow for locating different sizes and shapes of cylindrical and flat components accurately near the 'drilling head'. The surface topography was measured, using a motorised stage and a profilometer of the stylus type. This arrangement enabled the three dimensional determination of treated surfaces. The materials investigated were typical of aircraft alloys: steel 817 M 40 and aluminium 7075, which were provided by a major landing-gear manufacturer (Dowty Rotol). In order to examine the effect of residual stresses and surface profile upon ultimate product performance, fatigue tests using electro-hydraulic servo-controlled test equipment were used to evaluate the effect of the treatment upon the fatigue life and relaxation of residual stresses. Both complete and incomplete coverage were considered in the analysis. The results of the work show that pre-processing can induce unfavourable tensile residual stresses, which are detrimental to the fatigue life of the component. They also show that peening residual stresses play an important role ~n negating these tensile residual stresses. Effects of surface profile due to the pre-treatment also indicated a major influence on the success of the treatment, and upon the selection of the appropriate peening parameters. As for post-processing, it was shown that the residual stresses varied linearily with depth removed and remained significant even after 50 percent of the arc height had been removed from the component...|$|E

30|$|The {{action of}} X-ray {{irradiation}} on glasses {{is to produce}} secondary electrons from the sites where {{they are in a}} stable state and have an excess energy. Such electrons may traverse in the glass network depending upon their energy and the composition of the glass and are finally trapped, thus forming colour centres (or alternatively they may form excitons with energy states in the forbidden gap). The trapping sites may be the neodymium ions which constitute the glass structure, ions of admixtures to the main composition and the structural defects due to impurities in the glass. Thus this process leads to the formation of (1) boron electron centres, (2) non-bridging oxygen <b>hole</b> <b>centres</b> and (3) boron oxygen <b>hole</b> <b>centres</b> [35, 36, 37].

They show photocatalytic activity after platinization, in the visible light (420 – 550 nm) for H 2 -production from aqueous solutions containing sacrificial donors such as hypophosphite. The spectral sensitization is shown {{to be due to}} peroxotitanium species in the rutile-type structure. Peroxide ion, O 22 −, arises from the dimerization of O−, <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> <b>centres,</b> produced during <b>the</b> disproportionative decomposition of residual hydroxyls: OH− = O− + H.

40|$|High-resolution, multi-wavelength, and time-domain {{observations}} of <b>the</b> Galactic <b>centre</b> black <b>hole</b> candidate, Sgr A*, {{allow for a}} direct test of contemporary accretion theory. To date, all models have assumed alignment between the accretion disc and black hole angular momentum axes, but this is unjustified for geometrically thick accretion flows like that onto Sgr A*. Instead, we calculate images and spectra from a set of simulations of accretion flows misaligned ('tilted') by 15 degrees from the black hole spin axis and compare them with millimetre (mm) to near-infrared (NIR) observations. Non-axisymmetric standing shocks from eccentric fluid orbits dominate the emission, leading {{to a wide range}} of possible image morphologies. These effects invalidate previous parameter estimates from model fitting, including estimates of the dimensionless black hole spin, except possibly at low values of spin or tilt. At 1. 3 mm, the images have crescent morphologies, and the black hole shadow may still be accessible to future mm-VLBI observations. Shock heating leads to high energy electrons (T > 10 ^ 12 K), which can naturally produce the observed NIR flux, spectral index, and rapid variability ('flaring'). This NIR emission is uncorrelated with that in the mm, which also agrees with observations. These are the first models to self-consistently explain the time-variable mm to NIR emission of Sgr A*. Predictions of the model include significant structural changes observable with mm-VLBI on both the dynamical (hour) and Lense-Thirring precession (day-year) timescales; and ~ 30 - 50 microarcsecond changes in centroid position from extreme gravitational lensing events during NIR flares, detectable with the future VLT instrument GRAVITY. If the observed NIR emission is caused by shock heating in a tilted accretion disc, then <b>the</b> Galactic <b>centre</b> black <b>hole</b> has a positive, non-zero spin parameter (a > 0).
