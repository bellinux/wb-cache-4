2500|$|Push and Shove has {{received}} generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 61, based on 23 reviews, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic compared it favorably to Stefani's solo albums, stating, [...] "hat's <b>the</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> Push and Shove, {{for as much}} as there are clever contemporary flourishes [...] this is a modest, mature comeback, highlighted by the band's keen awareness of their strengths and subtle, unstated acknowledgment of encroaching middle age." [...] Entertainment Weeklys Melissa Maerz commented that on Push and Shove, Stefani [...] "pogos as hard as she did in her Anaheim-strip-mall ska days. But she's also just as neurotic, which adds depth to her love songs." [...] In a review for the Los Angeles Times, Mikael Wood opined, [...] "At its best, Push and Shove channels some of the infectiously restless energy of Rock Steady [...] And it further polishes a bold mix-and-match aesthetic that feels familiar today in part because of records such as Tragic Kingdom." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{composing}} for a {{film with}} such a large cast, Silvestri said, [...] "I’ve worked on films where {{there have been a}} number of stars and certainly worked on films where there have been characters of equal weight in terms of their level of importance and profile in the film, but this one is somewhat extreme in that regard because each of these characters has their own world ... the film is really about the coming together of these characters, which implies that there is this entity called the Avengers which really has to be representative of all of them together." [...] Later elaborating on this, Silvestri said, [...] "We knew that if we were to have a theme for every character in this movie, the music would get very clunky and intrusive. So I stayed away from all of that." [...] Instead, Marvel and Whedon wanted a central, definable [...] "Avengers" [...] theme for the film, which Silvestri wanted to have a heroic aspect and a grandness, but also be [...] "generated from that scene when they’re all gathering for the last great battle ... <b>the</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> it as the 'big moment; of the score is that they’re not doing anything. They’re standing there, which allowed me to move away from the idea of it being an action moment." [...] Silvestri did ultimately use some other themes in the score: he developed a motif for Loki as the central villain of the film, a [...] "low, ominous sequence of chords, [...] when his presence is either visible or implied"; he reprised his Captain America theme, for when that character [...] "makes his entrance, or when he’s in the middle of a fight scene ... yet not using it fully" [...] as [...] "a little of his theme goes a long, long way", and his Tesseract theme, including over the opening logos of the film; and midway through Silvestri's work writing the score, Whedon had seen some completed scenes featuring the Black Widow and [...] "wanted to explore music that was a bit more thematic for her", so Silvestri introduced [...] "a lonely, plucked theme with an Eastern European flavor" [...] to define the character. For the other major characters, Silvestri used instrumentation to differentiate their scenes, for instance Iron Man [...] "always has the more contemporary, rhythmic component to a lot of his music." ...|$|E
60|$|Indeed, {{it is only}} {{by walking}} out {{at least half a}} mile that you escape from the {{aggressive}} evidences of civilisation, and come out into the rice-fields {{at the back of the}} town. Here men with twists of blue and white cloth round their heads are working knee deep in the thick black mud. The largest field may be something less than two tablecloths, while the smallest is, say, a speck of undercliff, on to which it were hard to back a 'rickshaw, wrested from the beach and growing its clump of barley within spray-shot of the waves. The field paths are the trodden tops of the irrigating cuts, and the main roads as wide as two perambulators abreast. From the uplands--the beautiful uplands planted in exactly the proper places with pine and maple--the ground comes down in terraced pocket on pocket of rich earth to the levels again, and it would seem that every heavily-thatched farmhouse was chosen with special regard to the view. If you look closely when the people go to work you will see that a household spreads itself over plots, maybe, a quarter of a mile apart. A revenue map of a village shows that this scatteration is apparently designed, but the reason is not given. One thing at least is certain. The assessment of these patches can be no light piece of work--just the thing, in fact, that would give employment to a large number of small and variegated Government officials, any one of whom, assuming that he was of an Oriental cast of mind, might make the cultivator's life interesting. I remember now--a second-time-seen place brings back things that were altogether buried--seeing three years ago the pile of Government papers required in the case of one farm. They were many and systematic, but <b>the</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> them was the amount of work that they must have furnished to those who were neither cultivators nor Treasury officials.|$|E

60|$|<b>The</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> such {{opinions}} {{as these}} {{is not the}} exact height and depth of their falseness, but the considerations which could recommend them to a man of so much knowledge, both of books and of the outer facts of life, and of so much natural acuteness as De Maistre. Persons who have accustomed themselves to ascertained methods of proof, are apt to look on a man who vows that if a thing has been declared true by some authority whom he respects, then that constitutes proof to him, as either {{the victim of a}} preposterous and barely credible infatuation, or else as a flat impostor. Yet De Maistre was no ignorant monk. He had no selfish or official interest in taking away the keys of knowledge, entering not in himself, and them that would enter in hindering. The true reasons for his detestation of the eighteenth-century philosophers, science, and literature, are simple enough. Like every wise man, he felt that the end of all philosophy and science is emphatically social, the construction and maintenance and improvement of a fabric under which the communities of men may find shelter, and may secure all the conditions for living their lives with dignity and service. Then he held that no truth can be harmful to society. If he found any system of opinions, any given attitude of the mind, injurious to tranquillity and the public order, he instantly concluded that, however plausible they might seem when tested by logic and demonstration, they were fundamentally untrue and deceptive. What is logic compared with eternal salvation in the next world, and the practice of virtue in this? The recommendation of such a mind as De Maistre's is the intensity of its appreciation of order and social happiness. The obvious weakness of such a mind, and the curse inherent in its influence, is that it overlooks the prime condition of all; that social order can never be established on a durable basis so long as the discoveries of scientific truth in all its departments are suppressed, or incorrectly appreciated, or socially misapplied. De Maistre did not perceive that the cause which he supported was no longer the cause of peace and tranquillity and right living, but {{was in a state of}} absolute and final decomposition, and therefore was the cause of disorder and blind wrong living. Of this we shall now see more.|$|E

5000|$|SKiPPER is {{a domain}} {{specific}} skeleton library for vision applications [...] which provides skeletons in CAML, and thus relies on CAML for type safety. Skeletons {{are presented in}} two ways: declarative and operational. Declarative skeletons are directly used by programmers, while their operational versions provide an architecture specific target implementation. From the runtime environment, CAML skeleton specifications, and application specific functions (provided in C by the programmer), new C code is generated and compiled to run the application on the target architecture. One of <b>the</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> SKiPPER is that the skeleton program can be executed sequentially for debugging.|$|R

Light or no armor, swashbuckling, and courtly intrigue are {{the rule of the}} day. Sahud is the Asian mish-mash country, and would be suitable for a wuxia style game, or even something akin to Legend of the Five Rings.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> this matrix {{chaining}} {{is that a}} new {{coordinate system}} is defined by each such transformation. This can be extended as desired. For example, the propeller of the aircraft may be a separate model, which is then placed by translation to the aircraft nose. This translation only needs to describe the shift from the model coordinate system to the propeller coordinate system. In order to draw the entire aircraft, the transformation matrix for the aircraft is first determined, the points are transformed, and then the propeller model matrix is multiplied to the matrix of the aircraft, and then the propeller points are transformed.|$|E
5000|$|Though studio craft works {{do seem to}} {{have some}} of the {{necessary}} conditions required for injection into critical art discourse, simplifying craft theory as synonymous with art theory strikes some crafts theorists as problematic.

In his book Thinking Through Craft Adamson presents an overview of this question by presenting five aspects of this supposed second-class identity: supplementarity, sensuality, skill, the pastoral, and the amateur [...] Contrary to the implied second-class status of these themes, Adamson suggests that these are in fact the things that make craft significant and unique.|$|E

50|$|Teatro Olimpico is Europe's oldest {{existing}} post-roman theatre and it {{was built}} for the academy at Vicenza in 1584 for a production of the Greek tragedy Oedipus the King. As said earlier, this theatre was built {{in an attempt to}} revive classical theatre and <b>the</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> this theatre is that the set was built permanently and specifically for Oedipus, no other set can be built there. The scenic design in Teatro Olimpico {{is a good example of}} the kind of designs which were used during this time. Because Oedipus is a tragic play the set is built with classical architecture. Also common at the time, the set is designed in forced perspective.|$|E
5000|$|According to Eduardo Rivadavia, “although {{their music}} {{positively}} drips {{at all times}} with black metal's incomparably oppressive ambiance, sinister sounds, and deeply occult and nihilistic lyrical themes, <b>the</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> Mortuus is that their typical songs (e.g. ‘Penetrations of Darkness,’ ‘Constant Descent of Seraphim,’ etc.) actually feature ponderous pacing, lengthy guitar chords, and echoing growls reminiscent of death metal and doom. Even when they do make way for some momentary blastbeat and speed-picking activity, smashing into the rubble of their creations with the rage and force of a typhoon, other cuts like ‘Astral Pandemonium,’ ‘Illumination of God’ and ‘Rebirth in the Sterile Triad of Six,’ astonishingly remain prevalently focused on lengthy, dread-filled funeral dirges.” ...|$|E

One of <b>the</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> way that {{traditional}} cultures use plants for medicine is that cultures in very distant locations use the same plant for the same ailment. For example, plantain (Plantago major and other species) grows everywhere in the world, and it is used for the same ailments by the people in whose homeland it grows. That is, they use it primarily for skin problems—eruptions, boils, burns, cuts, insect bites, and so forth. Primitive peoples didn’t need laboratory studies and analyses to know which healing properties the plants around them contained or how to use them. All of our ancestors were herbalists!
