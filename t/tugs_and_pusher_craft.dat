60|$|Before {{the dawn}} the giant rose and went out, and {{immediately}} the queen {{ran up to}} the Bonnach stone, <b>and</b> <b>tugged</b> <b>and</b> <b>pushed</b> at it till it was quite steady on its ledge, and could not fall over. And so {{it was in the}} evening when the giant came home; and when they saw his shadow, the king crept {{down in front of the}} horses.|$|R
60|$|He {{scratched}} {{a longer}} entrance {{after his first}} hard squeezing, but that did no good; the doorway was still uncomfortably narrow, and he often reminded me, going into his house, of a very fat and pompous man trying to squeeze through a turnstile, <b>tugging</b> <b>and</b> <b>pushing</b> <b>and</b> tumbling through with a grunt at last, and turning to eye the invention indignantly. To {{get out of his}} den was easy, for during the long day he had digested his dinner and was thin again; but how to get in comfortably in the morning with a full stomach,--that was the question.|$|R
60|$|After a {{great deal}} of <b>tugging</b> <b>and</b> <b>pushing</b> at the bolt, Bella succeeded in getting it back, but even then the door would not come open. It was new, and it fitted very tight. Bella said that Mary Bell must push from the outside, while she held up the latch. Mary Bell {{accordingly}} pushed with all her force, and at length the door flew open, and to their great joy they found themselves both fairly admitted to the house.|$|R
5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Scott Yanow awarded the album 3 stars stating [...] "Falling between hard bop and avant-garde jazz, the music <b>tugs</b> <b>and</b> <b>pushes</b> at the {{boundaries}} of the modern mainstream. Douglas varies the tempos and moods from piece to piece, giving listeners not only expertly played performances but a constantly flowing program. Although none of the individual selections have themes that will stay in one's mind after the CD has ended, the solos are consistently strong, the musicians blend together well, and the ensembles are colorful. Well worth exploring".|$|R
60|$|I <b>tugged</b> <b>and</b> <b>pushed</b> as best I could, but the {{umbrella}} with which from a chair I at last managed {{to draw the}} upper bolt of the door was extremely cumbersome. The latch for a while resisted my efforts. And the knowledge that Fanny was fretting and fuming behind the gatepost hardly increased my skill. The house was sunken in quiet; Mrs Bowater apparently was sleeping without her usual accompaniment; only Henry shared my labours, and he sat moodily {{at the foot of}} the stairs, refusing to draw near until at the same moment Fanny entered, and he leapt out.|$|R
6000|$|So, after resting {{a little}} while, and getting my breath again, down I went. I {{was in for}} {{anything}} now, and the moment I reached the bottom, I swept my arm around and seized the first thing I touched. It was a pretty big thing, for it was a sea-feather over five feet high,--a regular tree. I gave a jerk at it, but it held fast. I wished, most earnestly, that I had taken hold of something smaller, but I didn't like to let go. I might get nothing else. I gave another jerk, but it was of no use. I felt that I couldn't hold my breath much longer, and must go up. I clutched the stem of the thing with both hands; I braced my feet against the bottom; I gave a tremendous <b>tug</b> <b>and</b> <b>push,</b> <b>and</b> up I came to the top, sea-feather and all! ...|$|R
60|$|Once in a way, as you steal {{through the}} autumn woods or hurry over the trail, {{you will hear}} sudden loud rustlings and shakings on the {{hardwood}} ridge above you, as if a small cyclone were perched there for a while, amusing itself among the leaves before blowing on. Then, if you steal up toward the sound, you will find Mooween standing on a big limb of a beech tree, grasping the narrowing trunk with his powerful forearms, <b>tugging</b> <b>and</b> <b>pushing</b> mightily to shake down the ripe beechnuts. The rattle and dash of the falling fruit are such music to Mooween's ears {{that he will not}} hear the rustle of your approach, nor the twig that snaps under your careless foot.|$|R
60|$|After a {{while they}} {{distinguished}} a cluster of small dark objects some distance in front, and made toward them cautiously. The ducks {{did not seem to}} get much plainer, and Whitney thought they were swimming away. Stopping a few minutes to allay suspicion, Dick paddled again; but the ducks vanished as they crept on. Then he turned in toward the bank <b>and</b> <b>pushed</b> the <b>craft</b> along the bottom, hoping the dark background would hide their approach. Presently they saw the ducks again and Whitney raised his gun.|$|R
2500|$|The {{seven men}} of the crew on Vosburg {{remained}} on board until Monday, May 6, 1912, as did the two men on board Nehalem, when the personnel of both vessels were taken off by boats manned by the life-saving station at Garibaldi, who had rowed to the scene. [...] Captain Erickson had been hoping to get Vosburg off the spit, and had kept the crew on board, but on Sunday night, huge waves began sweeping all along the <b>tug’s</b> deck, <b>and</b> <b>pushed</b> the <b>tug’s</b> hull into a into rock, making a hole through which water began to pour in, flooding the cabin and extinguishing {{the fire in the}} boiler.|$|R
40|$|JetBlue Airways Corporation, a Fortune 500 {{company based}} in New York City, is an airline that {{services}} 87 destinations across the U. S., Caribbean, and Latin America. From 2010 to 2014, JetBlue has made its overall operations increasingly more energy efficient, resulting in an 8. 3 % decline in greenhouse gas emissions intensity ratio (metric tons CO 2 -eq per 1, 000 revenue ton miles flown), which has also saved the company {{millions of dollars in}} operating costs. As JetBlue continues to enhance its efforts to couple sustainability with economic value, a logical next step was to evaluate JetBlue’s ground fleet for potential improvement. Our analysis focused on ground support operations at JetBlue’s Terminal 5 at John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) in New York. Responsible for 13, 800 metric tons of CO 2 -eq emissions, the function of ground support equipment (GSE) vehicles is to service the aircraft between flights. Our study included the three most used vehicle types—bag <b>tug,</b> belt loader, <b>and</b> <b>push</b> back tug—as they offered the largest opportunity for savings. Our study explored the economic and environmental opportunities associated with replacing current gasoline and diesel-powered GSE vehicles with electric vehicles, also called eGSE. This report first provides background on JetBlue Airways, its environmental impacts, and the airline’s sustainability program. It provides general emissions trends within the transportation sector before narrowing in on ground vehicles, where it details their specific function and describes emissions standards that apply to off-road GSE. The report then details the first step within our analysis in which we review JetBlue-provided GSE data, including a system-wide inventory and ground fuel expenditures dataset by airport. This report summarizes this data by describing the composition of JetBlue’s JFK ground vehicles by function, quantity, and energy inputs. We then consider energy reduction strategies for the GSE fleet by describing available alternative fuel sources and evaluating relevant efforts by other airlines and airports. The next stage of our analysis consisted of interviews with JetBlue employees and associated business partners and stakeholders, whose commentary and feedback have been integrated into the report. Data was also recorded on the ground at JFK to better understand the operation and retrieve accurate daily vehicle usage data. In the final stage of the analysis, all data was synthesized into a model that estimated how much gasoline or diesel the average bag <b>tug,</b> belt loader, <b>and</b> <b>push</b> back <b>tug</b> is using, as well as how much JetBlue spends per vehicle in powering it annually. Based off data from a GSE manufacturer, we calculated what the energy costs savings would be if all vehicles would run off of electricity instead of gasoline or diesel. Lastly, we modeled eight scenarios in which JetBlue would change a portion of their fleet to electric, and for each scenario the model projected fuel costs and emissions savings. Page | 2 Based on the incentives described in this report, we recommend the following for JetBlue’s GSE fleet at JFK: 1. Pursue push back electrification secondary to bag <b>tug</b> <b>and</b> belt loader 2. Launch pilot to test 1 charger, 2 belt loaders, <b>and</b> 1 bag <b>tug</b> at JFK 3. Apply for the FAA’s Voluntary Airport Low Emissions Program (VALE) funding 4. Set goal of 20 % electric bag <b>tugs</b> <b>and</b> belt loaders in 3 -year period (by 2019), replacing vehicles as they retire. In a worst case scenario where JetBlue receives no funding and pays the higher cost for all new vehicles instead of refurbished, JetBlue will save roughly $ 1. 7 million and 36, 500 metric tons of CO 2 -eq emissions across a 14 -year timeline. 5. Set goal of 50 % electric belt loaders <b>and</b> bag <b>tugs</b> in a 7 -year period (by 2023), replacing vehicles as they retire. In a worst case scenario where JetBlue receives no funding and pays the higher cost for all new vehicles instead of refurbished, JetBlue will save roughly $ 4. 3 million and 89, 200 metric tons of CO 2 -eq emissions across a 14 -year timeline. 6. Research feasibility of retrofitting 100 % electric belt loaders, bag <b>tugs,</b> <b>and</b> <b>push</b> backs, replacing vehicles are they retire. This can maximize the opportunity to save roughly $ 7 million in fuel costs (assuming funding is received) and over 60, 000 metric tons of CO 2 -equivalent emissions over 14 years...|$|R
50|$|Mohave towed coal barges from Norfolk to New England ports {{until after}} the Armistice in November 1918, and was then {{detached}} from NOTS five days before Christmas (20 December) and {{was assigned to the}} 5th Naval District. In 1919, she made two voyages to Bermuda and then operated in the Caribbean between Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, until returning to Norfolk via Key West and Charleston, S.C., on 15 December 1919. The next year, during which time she received the alphanumeric hull number AT-15 on 17 July 1920, Mohave served the fleet by towing coal and stores to Indian Head, Maryland, and making brief voyages to Charleston and New York City. On 18 March 1921, she was transferred to the 1st Naval District. Based out of Boston, the <b>tug</b> pulled <b>and</b> <b>pushed</b> her barges to ports all along the New England coast, making frequent trips to Portsmouth, N.H., Newport, R.I., and numerous Massachusetts ports over the next seven years.|$|R
50|$|Gueritz's {{immediate}} {{task was}} {{to solve the problem}} of vehicles becoming stuck in the soft sand, and to start getting men through the exits being cleared through the minefields and barbed wire by flail tanks. To add to his problems, a further brigade came ashore at 0930, only to find that high winds were driving the tide higher than expected, reducing the space available on the beach <b>and</b> <b>pushing</b> the landing <b>craft</b> on to the explosive obstacles left by the Germans. Despite all this by the evening of D-Day 30,000 troops, hundreds of vehicles and tons of ammunition and other supplies had been landed and moved through the beach area.|$|R
50|$|The pilot {{signals the}} {{departure}} and arrival of Mark Twain using a horn and bell system, along with various signals to other river craft attractions. Because the riverboat travels along an I-beam guide rail throughout the ride, the pilot does not maneuver the ship. Instead, the pilot serves as lookout for other river traffic, such as Davy Crockett's Explorer Canoes and the Rafts to Pirate's Lair on Tom Sawyer Island, and communicates his observations with the boiler engineer. The boiler engineer is stationed {{on the bottom}} deck towards the stern. This is where the throttle and reverser are located. From here, the boiler engineer controls the speed {{and direction of the}} riverboat. Steam from the boiler is used to power the paddle wheels <b>and</b> thus <b>pushes</b> the <b>craft</b> along its guide-way.|$|R

40|$|The Timed Up <b>and</b> Go (<b>TUG)</b> <b>and</b> Two-Minute Walk Test (2 MWT) are {{clinically}} appropriate mobility {{measures in}} amputee rehabilitation. Despite the tests being routinely performed, reference values for amputees {{have yet to}} be established. This study aimed to establish and trial a method for estimating normative values of the <b>TUG</b> <b>and</b> 2 MWT for transtibial and transfemoral amputees. Thirty-seven established prosthetic users aged 40 – 69 years (28 unilateral transtibial amputees and nine unilateral transfemoral) performed two recorded trials of the <b>TUG</b> <b>and</b> 2 MWT. Participant characteristics were collected using the Trinity Amputation and Prosthesis Experience Scale. Preliminary normative data for the <b>TUG</b> <b>and</b> 2 MWT were produced for three age cohorts and the two amputee subpopulations. Poorer mobility performance with transfemoral amputation was evident for both mobility measures. Multivariate analysis displayed relationships between age, length of time with a prosthesis and performance of both tests. In conclusion, normative values for the <b>TUG</b> <b>and</b> 2 MWT for transtibial and transfemoral amputees may be calculated. Preliminary results indicate that higher levels of amputation relate to poorer performance on both the <b>TUG</b> <b>and</b> 2 MWT. Studies with larger samples are required to further develop these values for use in rehabilitation...|$|R
