5|$|Teenagers {{have been}} {{participating}} in tough love behavior modification programs since the 1960s. Many {{of these programs}} {{take place in the}} wilderness in the style of military recruit training (also known as boot camps) and <b>the</b> <b>teenagers</b> are subjected to rigid discipline, including mandatory marches, physical abuse, solitary confinement, and deprivation of food and sleep. These programs have little to no oversight from the United States federal or state governments. Teenagers' claims of abuse at these facilities have not been investigated because the programs are not regulated.|$|E

Previously sending a beacon to his fellow Autobots, Bumblebee takes Sam and Mikaela to meet the new arrivals – Optimus, Jazz, Ironhide, and Ratchet. Optimus explains the details of their situation, revealing that if Megatron gained the AllSpark he would transform Earth’s machinery into a new army and exterminate mankind. Sam, Mikaela, and the Autobots travel to Sam’s house to retrieve the glasses, but <b>the</b> <b>teenagers</b> are captured by agents of Sector Seven, a top secret government branch, led by Seymour Simmons.

5|$|Till {{arrived in}} Money, Mississippi, on August 21, 1955.

The market mostly served the local sharecropper population and was owned by a white couple, 24-year-old Roy Bryant and his 21-year-old wife Carolyn. Carolyn {{was alone in the}} store that day; her sister-in-law was {{in the rear of the}} store watching children.

5|$|Brody {{runs into}} Mike, who tells {{his father that}} Sean is with his friends, {{drifting}} towards Cable Junction, a small island housing an electrical relay station, and apologizes for disobeying him and putting Sean in danger. Brody accepts his apology while telling him to get to safety and quickly finds them, but when the shark returns, he panics and maroons the police boat on Cable Junction. He then tries to pull them in with a winch but hooks an underwater power cable. The shark's next attack sends most of <b>the</b> <b>teenagers</b> into the water, and they swim to Cable Junction while Sean and Jackie are trapped on the boats. Using an inflatable raft, Brody hits the power cable with an oar to attract the shark, and encourages it to bite the cable; the shark is fatally electrocuted, and its body sinks {{to the bottom of}} the sea. The kids rejoice as Brody picks up Sean and Jackie, and they join them on Cable Junction to await rescue.|$|E
5|$|At this point, Spielberg {{considered}} {{returning to}} direct the sequel. Over the Bicentennial weekend in 1976, Spielberg had hammered out a screenplay based on Quint's Indianapolis speech. Because of his contract for Close Encounters of the Third Kind, however, {{he would not be}} able to work on the film for a further year, a gap too long for the producers. Production designer Joe Alves (who would direct Jaws 3-D) and Verna Fields (who had been promoted to vice-president at Universal after her acclaimed editing on the first film) proposed that they co-direct it. The request was declined by the Directors Guild of America, partly because they would not allow a DGA member to be replaced by someone who was not one of its members, and partly because they, in the wake of events on the set of The Outlaw Josey Wales, had instituted a ban on any cast or crew members taking over as director during a film's production. The reins were eventually handed to Jeannot Szwarc, best known for the film Bug and whom Alves knew from working on the TV series Night Gallery. Szwarc recommenced production by filming the complicated waterskier scene, giving Gottlieb some time to complete the script. He reinstated the character of Deputy Hendricks, played by Jeffrey Kramer, who had been missing from the earlier script. Many of <b>the</b> <b>teenagers</b> were sacked, with the remaining roles developed.|$|E
5|$|In the {{original}} Friday the 13th (1980), Mrs. Pamela Voorhees (Betsy Palmer) stalks and murders <b>the</b> <b>teenagers</b> preparing Camp Crystal Lake for re‑opening. She {{is determined to}} ensure that the camp does not reopen after her son Jason (Ari Lehman) drowned in the lake due to the negligence of two staff members. The last counselor, Alice Hardy (Adrienne King), fends off Mrs. Voorhees long enough to grab a machete and decapitate her. In Friday the 13th Part 2 (1981), Jason (Steve Daskewisz/Warrington Gillette) is revealed to be alive and fully grown. After killing Alice Hardy, Jason returns to Crystal Lake to guard it from all intruders. Five years later, a group of teenagers arrive at Crystal Lake to set up a new camp, but Jason murders them. Ginny Field (Amy Steel), the last counselor Jason attempts to kill, finds a cabin in the woods with a shrine built around the severed head of Mrs. Voorhees. Ginny fights back and slams a machete through Jason's shoulder. Jason is left for dead as Ginny is taken away in an ambulance. During the events of Friday the 13th Part III (1982), Jason (Richard Brooker) removes the machete from his shoulder and finds his way to Chris Higgins' (Dana Kimmell) local homestead. Chris returns to her property with some friends, and Jason kills anyone who wanders into the barn where he is hiding. Taking a hockey mask from a victim to hide his face, Jason leaves the barn to kill the rest of the group. Chris seemingly kills Jason with an axe to his head, but the night's events drive her into hysteria as the police take her away.|$|E

40|$|The {{specialist}} part of {{the thesis}} discusses communication and expression of emotions of a teenager with high-functioning autism, discordant mental abilities and suspected hyperkinetic disorder. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>teenager</b> suffers from selective mutism and shows {{a great interest in}} trains and timetables. The thesis examines the possibility to approach <b>the</b> <b>teenager</b> with high-functioning autism by use of drama activities and theatrical techniques as well as other art-related therapeutic methods and consequently gain as much information regarding his communication and expression of emotions as possible. Moreover, the thesis studies whether art techniques can help develop and improve his social skills, his verbal and non-verbal communication and influence on his ability to focus. The case study is carried out as a qualitative interpretive action research. Among others, I introduce a special copyright method of research » 8 wagons« which includes elements of theatrical activities that consistently apply to <b>the</b> <b>teenager's</b> particular interest. An integral {{part of the}} research represents a questionnaire which <b>the</b> <b>teenager</b> fills out (either orally or in writing) after each meeting and is thematically related to the drama activities of each wagon. <b>The</b> <b>teenager's</b> wish is to become a train driver and it is noteworthy that certain interests of people with high-functioning autism eventually become their source of revenue, permanent employment or even career. I would also like to point out a special appendix to the thesis - a comparative analysis of autobiographical short film about <b>the</b> mentioned <b>teenager,</b> which is a graduate work of young director Katarina Morano of the Academy of Theatre, Radio, Film and Television in Ljubljana, with the survey's results. Interviews with Benjamin's mother, brother, teachers, special pedagogy teacher, psychologist, director Katarina Morano and his peers are another important contribution to the description of Benjamin's communication and emotions. The action research results of the qualitative study of <b>the</b> <b>teenager</b> with high-functioning autism show that various theatrical techniques, drama activities and other art-related methods, such as music and dance activities, greatly contributed to <b>the</b> <b>teenager's</b> (and my own) understanding of his way of communication and emotion expression. With the help of drama activities, <b>the</b> <b>teenager</b> managed to improve his verbal and non-verbal communication, gained new social skills and developed greater ability to focus...|$|R
