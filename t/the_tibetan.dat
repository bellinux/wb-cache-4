5|$|The Tang Empire {{competed with}} <b>the</b> <b>Tibetan</b> Empire {{for control of}} areas in Inner and Central Asia, which was at times settled with {{marriage}} alliances such as the marrying of Princess Wencheng (d.680) to Songtsän Gampo (d. 649). A Tibetan tradition mentions that Chinese troops captured Lhasa after Songtsän Gampo's death, but no such invasion is mentioned in either Chinese annals or <b>the</b> <b>Tibetan</b> manuscripts of Dunhuang.|$|E
5|$|After this, <b>the</b> <b>Tibetan</b> people's {{trade in}} tiger skins became a {{relatively}} more important threat to tigers. The pelts {{were used in}} clothing, tiger-skin chuba being worn by singers and participants in horse racing festivals, and had become status symbols. In 2004, international conservation organizations launched successful environmental propaganda campaigns in China against <b>the</b> <b>Tibetan</b> tiger skin trade. There was outrage in India, where many Tibetans live, and the 14th Dalai Lama was persuaded {{to take up the}} issue. Since then there has been a change of attitude, with some Tibetans publicly burning their chubas.|$|E
50|$|The Tang dynasty became {{weakened}} considerably {{due to the}} An Lushan Rebellion, and <b>the</b> <b>Tibetans</b> took <b>the</b> {{opportunity to}} expand into Gansu and the Western Regions. <b>The</b> <b>Tibetans</b> took control of Turfan in 792.|$|R
5000|$|Thorns {{were used}} by <b>the</b> <b>Tibetans</b> to whip Father Mussot, a French Priest, and his severed hands and heads were affixed to a monastery door after <b>the</b> <b>Tibetans</b> shot him to death. Methods of {{execution}} such as encasing victims in yak skins which were then sewn shut and left out {{to be exposed to}} the elements were used upon Christians by <b>the</b> <b>Tibetans.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Tibetans</b> executed Father Soulié, and took to the Atunze monastery the head and liver of Bourdonnec after they slayed him and Dubernard, and they vowed [...] "to exterminate all inhabitants ... even the dogs and chickens, up to the least blade of grass.".|$|R
50|$|With {{the help}} of {{reinforcements}} from Galdan Boshugtu Khan, Khan of the Zungar Empire, <b>the</b> <b>Tibetans</b> attacked again in 1684. <b>The</b> <b>Tibetans</b> were victorious and concluded a treaty with Ladakh then they retreated back to Lhasa on December 1684.|$|R

50|$|Two Tibetan generals {{defected}} to the Chinese with their troops in 692.

50|$|After {{escaping}} from Lingtu, <b>the</b> <b>Tibetans</b> crossed <b>the</b> border and rallied in the Chumbi valley, defeated but not destroyed. In fact they received reinforcements and the British readied their defences in Gnathong, a plateau some {{three or four}} miles north of Lingtu. On 21May the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal arrived at Gnathong and <b>the</b> <b>Tibetans</b> attacked <b>the</b> British defences {{the next day at}} 7 AM with 3,000 men (British claim). The fighting lasted until 10 a.m. when <b>the</b> <b>Tibetans</b> retreated. <b>The</b> British admitted three killed and eight wounded and claimed to have killed around a hundred <b>Tibetans.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Tibetans</b> retreated back across the Jelap La and no other combat took place, so in June the British started to send some of the troops back to Darjeeling.|$|R

5|$|The site, {{which is}} over 1,300 years old, {{dates back to}} Songtsän Gampo, the founder of <b>the</b> <b>Tibetan</b> Empire, and was amongst the first {{buildings}} built in the Lhasa area by him during the 7th century after settlement. Although originally the site of his castle or fort, <b>the</b> <b>Tibetan</b> Annals have revealed that Pabonka was converted into a monastery, possibly under {{the reign of the}} second great Buddhist king of Tibet Trisong Detsen. Detsen, along with Guru Rinpoche and the first seven monks of the new Tibetan Empire used to meditate at the hermitage and it became one of Tibet's very earliest Buddhist monasteries, possibly even pre-dating Jokhang.|$|E
5|$|A 2011 study {{proposed}} the following treatment. The long-tailed birds from <b>the</b> <b>Tibetan</b> Plateau {{with a narrow}} white throat patch are separated as Salim Ali's swift, A. salimali, the small swifts with narrow white rumps from the Himalayas of India, Nepal and Bhutan become Blyth's swift, A. leuconyx, and the population that breeds in limestone caves in northern Southeast Asia, characterised by a green iridescence and shallow tail fork, is split as Cook's swift, A. cooki. The remaining subspecies are the nominate A. p. pacificus and the southern race A. p. kurodae (which includes <b>the</b> <b>Tibetan</b> population formerly named as kanoi). This arrangement has been accepted by the International Ornithological Committee (IOC), but not the International Union for Conservation of Nature. A 2012 paper showed that cooki {{is closely related to}} the dark-rumped swift, A. acuticauda, which should therefore be included in the pacificus clade, but made no further taxonomic recommendations.|$|E

5|$|From the 11th century, many Tibetan {{saints and}} eminent figures came to Taktsang to meditate, {{including}} Milarepa (1040–1123), Pha Dampa Sangye (died 1117), <b>the</b> <b>Tibetan</b> yogini Machig Labdrön (1055–1145) and Thangton Gyelpo (1385–1464). In {{the latter part}} of the 12th century, the Lapa School was established in Paro. Between 12th and 17th centuries, many Lamas who came from Tibet established their monasteries in Bhutan.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, {{the common}} {{blackbird}} can {{be confused with}} the paler-winged first-winter ring ouzel (Turdus torquatus) or the superficially similar European starling (Sturnus vulgaris). A number of similar Turdus thrushes exist far outside the range of the common blackbird, for example the South American Chiguanco thrush (Turdus chiguanco). The Indian blackbird, <b>the</b> <b>Tibetan</b> blackbird, and the Chinese blackbird were formerly considered subspecies.|$|E

25|$|The Tang {{established}} the Four Garrisons of Anxi in the Tarim Basin after defeating Ashina Helu's subordinate Duman at Kasghar in 659. <b>The</b> <b>Tibetans</b> invaded <b>the</b> Tarim Basin in the 660s and drove Tang forces out in 670. A Tang counter-attack regained the Tarim Basin in 692. The Tang then maintained {{control over the}} Western Regions for another century, but {{the loss of the}} Hexi Corridor to <b>the</b> <b>Tibetans</b> after <b>the</b> An Lushan rebellion caused the Four Garrisons to be cut off from the Tang empire and finally lost to <b>the</b> <b>Tibetans</b> for <b>the</b> second and last time in the 790s.|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>Tibetans</b> later {{defeated}} <b>the</b> Chinese {{and took}} control of the Four Garrisons. [...] Khotan was first taken in 665, and the Khotanese helped <b>the</b> <b>Tibetans</b> to conquer Aksu. Tang China later regained control in 692, but eventually lost control of the entire Western Regions after it was weakened considerably by the An Lushan Rebellion.|$|R
50|$|In the Kathmandu Valley, the kīla {{is still}} in usage by shamans, magicians, tantrikas and lamas of {{different}} ethnic backgrounds.

5|$|The {{birds of}} Thailand are mainly {{typical of the}} Indomalaya ecozone, with affinities to the Indian subcontinent to the west, and, {{particularly}} in Southern Thailand, with the Sundaic fauna to the southeast. The northern mountains are outliers of <b>the</b> <b>Tibetan</b> Plateau, with many species of montane birds, and in winter the avifauna is augmented by migrants from the eastern Palearctic and Himalayas.|$|E
5|$|The red fox is {{considered}} a more specialised form of Vulpes than the Afghan, corsac and Bengal foxes {{in the direction of}} size and adaptation to carnivory; the skull displays much fewer neotenous traits than in other species, and its facial area is more developed. It is, however, not as adapted for a purely carnivorous diet as <b>the</b> <b>Tibetan</b> fox.|$|E
5|$|Tibet {{was once}} a strong power {{contemporaneous}} with Tang China (618–907). Until <b>the</b> <b>Tibetan</b> Empire's collapse in the 9th century, it was the Tang's major rival in dominating Inner Asia. The Yarlung rulers of Tibet also signed various peace treaties with the Tang, culminating in a treaty in 821 that fixed the borders between Tibet and China.|$|E

5|$|Although the Silk Road from China to the West was {{initially}} formulated {{during the reign}} of Emperor Wu (141–87) during the Han, it was reopened by the Tang in 639 when Hou Junji (643) conquered the West, and remained open for almost four decades. It was closed after the Tibetans captured it in 678, but in 699, during Empress Wu's period, the Silk Road reopened when the Tang reconquered the Four Garrisons of Anxi originally installed in 640, once again connecting China directly to the West for land-based trade. The Tang captured the vital route through the Gilgit Valley from Tibet in 722, lost it to the Tibetans in 737, and regained it under the command of the Goguryeo-Korean General Gao Xianzhi. When the An Lushan Rebellion ended in 763, the Tang Empire had once again lost control over its western lands, as <b>the</b> <b>Tibetan</b> Empire largely cut off China's direct access to the Silk Road. An internal rebellion in 848 ousted <b>the</b> <b>Tibetan</b> rulers, and Tang China regained its northwestern prefectures from Tibet in 851. These lands contained crucial grazing areas and pastures for raising horses that the Tang dynasty desperately needed.|$|E
5|$|Between August 2007 to March 2008, Dhondup Wangchen and Jigme Gyatso {{gathered}} interviews from 108 Tibetan individuals {{discussing the}} political situation, {{all of whom}} agreed to have their faces shown on camera. The pair gathered 40 hours of interview footage shot by a single camera. They had completed filming and just smuggled the tapes out of Lhasa, <b>the</b> <b>Tibetan</b> capital, when riots erupted and began to spread through Tibetan-majority areas of China. As {{part of the government}} response that followed, both Jigme Gyatso and Dhondup Wangchen were detained on 28 March in Tong De, Qinghai Province.|$|E
