5|$|On 6 April 1967, Vulcan B.2 XL385 burnt out on {{the runway}} at RAF Scampton at the {{beginning}} of its <b>take-off</b> <b>run.</b> The aircraft was carrying a Blue Steel missile training round. All the crew, including an Air Training Corps cadet, escaped unhurt. The aircraft was engulfed in flames and totally destroyed. The accident was caused by failure of an Olympus 301 HP turbine disc as the engine reached full power.|$|E
25|$|The Air Yacht {{made its}} first flight in February 1930 at Hythe, England. It proved to be underpowered, with an {{excessive}} <b>take-off</b> <b>run,</b> and despite re-engining with three Armstrong Siddeley Panthers, was rejected by Guinness, who purchased a Saro Cloud instead.|$|E
25|$|The DF 2000 was {{designed}} to provide a fast, robust, comfortable, low-cost side-by-side two-seat ultralight with a short <b>take-off</b> <b>run.</b> It has a conventional layout not unlike that of, for example, the Cessna 152, with a high wing, swept vertical tail and tricycle undercarriage.|$|E
50|$|Mt.Bulgok {{serves as}} a public {{recreation}} area at the Southernmost part of the Seongnam green belt between Jeongja-dong and Gumi-dong. It also hosts hang gliding <b>take-off</b> <b>runs</b> in the Southwest and Northeast.|$|R
5000|$|Lioré et Olivier LeO C-302:Early autogyros {{suffered}} from relatively long <b>take-off</b> <b>runs.</b> To reduce the take-off length two C-301 aircraft were fitted with {{the equivalent of}} Cierva's [...] "Jump" [...] head allowing the aircraft to leap vertically after only a very short run. The C-302s were used extensively for testing rotor and undercarriage components but development was eventually abandoned in 1949/1950.|$|R
500|$|This same short span {{produced}} {{very little}} lift at low speed, {{which resulted in}} extremely long <b>take-off</b> <b>runs</b> and frighteningly high landing speeds. In an SST design, this would have required enormous engine power to lift off from existing runways, and to provide the fuel needed, [...] "some horribly large aeroplanes" [...] resulted. Based on this, the group considered {{the concept of an}} SST infeasible, and instead suggested continued low-level studies into supersonic aerodynamics.|$|R
25|$|On 28 August 1992, a Bouraq Vickers Viscount (registered PH-IVX) was {{destroyed}} in an engine fire at Syamsudin Noor Airport. The fire started during the <b>take-off</b> <b>run,</b> but the pilots noticed it in time to abort take-off and evacuate the 64 passengers (plus six crew), before the aircraft was engulfed by the flames.|$|E
25|$|On 31 October 1983, Douglas DC-3C N44896 of FBN Flying Service was {{destroyed}} by fire at Laredo International Airport while attempting to take-off on a cargo flight to McAllen-Miller International Airport, Texas. A fire had developed on board the aircraft during the <b>take-off</b> <b>run,</b> and the crew were unable to extinguish it with the equipment available to them.|$|E
25|$|Court Line Flight 95 was an {{international}} charter flight from London Luton Airport, Bedfordshire, England, to Munich-Riem Airport, West Germany, operated on 18 April 1974 by Court Line (Aviation) Ltd BAC One-Eleven 518 G-AXMJ. During its <b>take-off</b> <b>run,</b> Piper PA-23 Aztec G-AYDE of McAlpine Aviation entered the active runway without permission. Although the pilots of the One-Eleven {{tried to take}} avoiding action, a collision between the two aircraft occurred, killing the pilot of the Aztec and injuring his passenger.|$|E
50|$|Significantly, on 11 October 1940, the 8th Pursuit Group {{participated in}} a test {{designed}} to compare the <b>take-off</b> <b>runs</b> of standard Navy and Army aircraft. On that day, 24 P-40s from the 8th Pursuit Group launched from the USS Wasp, an aircraft carrier, and returned to Langley Field. That experiment, {{the first time that}} Army planes had flown from a Navy carrier, foreshadowed the use of the ship in the ferry role that it performed admirably in World War II.|$|R
2500|$|Work on the {{extension}} of the runway started on 31 January 2007, involving the moving of [...] of earthwork. The runway was extended westwards, causing a new ILS system to be installed in that direction. Costing 57 million kroner, the work saw the strip extended by [...] to [...] The extension opened on 1 July 2008. Although this allowed for longer <b>take-off</b> <b>runs,</b> the landing distances were unaffected. This allows the airport to serve as large aircraft as the Boeing 757-200 on a trans-Atlantic route.|$|R
2500|$|In the 1930s, as {{take-off}} weights {{of aircraft}} continued to increase, designers grew increasingly {{concerned about the}} effects that these weights would have on <b>take-off</b> <b>runs,</b> and several designers investigated {{the concept of a}} [...] "slip-wing", which could be jettisoned after take-off. Amongst the proponents of the [...] "slip-wing" [...] was Noel Pemberton Billing, the founder of Supermarine, who wrote several articles in the aviation press promoting the idea, either with a manned, reusable auxiliary wing, or a disposable or [...] "scrap-wing". Blackburn Aircraft also investigated [...] "slip-wings".|$|R
25|$|The Mirage F1 was {{of similar}} size to the delta-winged Mirage III and Mirage 5, and was {{powered by the}} same SNECMA Atar engine as had been used on the larger Dassault Mirage IV; however, unlike its predecessors, it shared the layout of a swept wing mounted high on the {{fuselage}} and a conventional tail surface as used by the F2. Although it has a smaller wingspan than the Mirage III, the Mirage F1 nevertheless proved to be superior to its predecessor, carrying more fuel while possessing a shorter <b>take-off</b> <b>run</b> and superior maneuverability.|$|E
25|$|The C-123T has {{recently}} been revived by {{a joint venture between}} the US-based Fleetwings Aircraft Company and the South African company Elmer Group. In 2010, they announced a project to initially remanufacture old airframes for African customers and, where there was demand, to build new aircraft. The airframes would be fitted with new turboprop Rolls-Royce T56-A-15 engines, a glass cockpit and other enhancements. The proposed C-123T would have had a 25,000lb payload capability, and a <b>take-off</b> <b>run</b> of just over 1,000ft at 50,000lb MTOW. Possible applications included maritime patrol, search and rescue, and even use as a gunship, while roll-on packages have already been developed for mid-air refueling and agricultural applications.|$|E
25|$|The second non-fatal {{incident}} occurred on 14 January 1969. It involved a BUA mainline BAC One-Eleven 201AC (registration: G-ASJJ) operating a scheduled international passenger flight from Milan's Linate Airport to London Gatwick. This {{was the same}} aircraft BUA had used to operate the One-Eleven's inaugural revenue service. On {{the day of the}} accident, the aircraft had been diverted to Linate on the outbound flight because of fog at Genoa's Cristoforo Colombo Airport. A normal <b>take-off</b> <b>run</b> was followed by a bang immediately after the aircraft had become airborne. The captain in the jumpseat who was supervising the co-pilot at the time thought that there was a problem with the no. 1 engine. He advised the pilot in command to close the throttle a short while later. The pilot in command followed this advice and lowered the nose pitch from 12 to six degrees. The engine shutdown was accompanied by an decrease in airspeed from 140 knots (161mph/ 259km/h to 115 kn (132mph / 212km/h). Although the aircraft was damaged beyond repair in the resulting forced landing on snow-covered sand about two miles from the end of runway 18, there were no fatalities among the 33 occupants (seven crew and 26 passengers) though there were two serious injuries. The accident investigators concluded that this crash was caused by the crew failing to recognise their mistake, which had resulted in shutting down the wrong engine (no. 1) in error following a compressor bang/surge in the no. 2 engine. In addition, the crew did not notice that an inadvertent movement of the relevant throttle lever had partially reduced the no. 2 engine's thrust.|$|E
2500|$|Taihōs {{upper and}} lower hangars were {{approximately}} [...] long and [...] high. The upper hangar was [...] wider than the lower. Fighters were normally stowed {{in the middle and}} forward sections of the upper hangar and were raised to flight deck level using the bow elevator to facilitate more rapid handling. Dive bombers occupied the remaining upper hangar spaces with torpedo bombers stowed in the lower hangar. With greater all-up weights and longer <b>take-off</b> <b>runs</b> than the fighters, these planes were brought up to the flight deck using the aft elevator where they could then be spotted as far astern as possible.|$|R
40|$|The {{characteristics}} of a proposed acceleration-type take-off indicator were observed during <b>take-off</b> <b>runs</b> of a large jet airplane. The instrument performed its function satisfactorily. It showed an essentially constant reading, which agreed closely with the predicted value, throughout the take-off except for about the first 135 feet of the ground roll during which the starting windup of the indicator pointer occurred. Although oscillating longitudinal accelerations at the instrument location were as much as +/- 50 percent of the steady-state acceleration, the instrument showed only small excursions from the mean reading equivalent to not more than +/- 5 percent of the mean reading and {{was considered to be}} satisfactorily readable...|$|R
50|$|Taihōs {{upper and}} lower hangars were {{approximately}} 150 m long and 5 m high. The upper hangar was 1 m wider than the lower. Fighters were normally stowed {{in the middle and}} forward sections of the upper hangar and were raised to flight deck level using the bow elevator to facilitate more rapid handling. Dive bombers occupied the remaining upper hangar spaces with torpedo bombers stowed in the lower hangar. With greater all-up weights and longer <b>take-off</b> <b>runs</b> than the fighters, these planes were brought up to the flight deck using the aft elevator where they could then be spotted as far astern as possible.|$|R
500|$|A special runway will be {{required}} for launch: {{it needs to be}} reinforced to tolerate the high equivalent single wheel load; necessitated by the Skylon's 325 tonnes takeoff weight; it will need to have heat resistant sections {{at the start of the}} <b>take-off</b> <b>run</b> and at the rotation zone; and it will have to be [...] long to allow the Skylon to accelerate to its [...] rotation speed, yet still have [...] to abort the launch and brake to a standstill if required. The Skylon would be able to land on a [...] Code F civil runway.|$|E
500|$|The DB-240 {{prototype}} flew for {{the first}} time on 14 May 1940 and began its State acceptance tests on 27 September 1940. The weaker engines prevented the DB-240 from reaching its designed performance. [...] It could only attain [...] at [...] instead of the expected [...] at [...] Its defensive armament was deemed inadequate and other problems included an excessively long <b>take-off</b> <b>run</b> and engine defects. However, these did not offset its virtues of a heavy bomb load and long-range ( [...] carrying [...] of bombs). It was ordered into production at Factory No. 18, in Voronezh, as the Yermolayev Yer-2.|$|E
500|$|The first {{prototype}} {{was completed}} in early 1928 and made its first flight on 21 February. Its manufacturer's trials were finished by 10 March and the state acceptance trials by 14 April. The pilots of the NII VVS ( [...] – Air Force Scientific Test Institute) criticized the lack of directional stability at high speeds and a slight problem in control response between maneuvers. The area of the vertical tail was increased and the elevators were given horn balances to alleviate the first problem while split ailerons addressed the second problem. Since production had begun before the aircraft was actually approved for service use, the first forty aircraft were completed with the smaller tailplane. A second prototype {{was completed in}} August 1928 and tested a different propeller optimized for high speed which increased the top speed to , although it lengthened the <b>take-off</b> <b>run.</b> The first 39 aircraft completed, plus the two prototypes, used imported engines, but the remainder used the license-built Mikulin M-17.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the day of}} the {{accident}} Croydon Air Port was shrouded in fog with visibility fluctuating at around 50 m; and all aircraft were operating under so-called [...] "QBI" [...] (a Q code denoting that all operations have to be performed under instrument flight rules) conditions. Crews of aircraft were following a white line laid out approximately East-West on the grass surface of Croydon's landing area during their <b>take-off</b> <b>runs</b> (a normal procedure at several airports in the United Kingdom at the time, that had been in use at Croydon since 1931). A number of departures by this method had already been made that day by the time the KLM DC-2 took off, including a Swissair DC-2 about 25 minutes beforehand.|$|R
50|$|Now {{ready to}} join the fleet and {{assigned}} to Carrier Division 3, Patrol Force, Wasp shifted to Naval Operating Base, Norfolk (NOB Norfolk) from the Norfolk Navy Yard on 11 October. There she loaded 24 Curtiss P-40 fighters from the Army Air Corps' 8th Pursuit Group and nine North American O-47A reconnaissance aircraft from the 2d Observation Squadron, {{as well as her}} own spares and utility unit Grumman J2F Duck flying boats on the 12th. Proceeding to sea for maneuvering room, Wasp flew off the Army planes in a test designed to compare the <b>take-off</b> <b>runs</b> of standard Navy and Army aircraft. That experiment, the first time that Army planes had flown from a Navy carrier, foreshadowed the use of the ship in the ferry role that she performed so well in World War II.|$|R
50|$|<b>Take-off</b> {{and landing}} <b>runs</b> (ground roll) are 45 and 40 m respectively. The {{corresponding}} overall distances to clear 15.25 m are 97 and 90 m.|$|R
500|$|For {{several days}} {{following}} D-Day, the squadron flew patrols and received credits for many kills. In one instance, Warrant Officer (W/O) W.F. Price and P/O J.G. Costello shot down two Do.217 {{aircraft in the}} space of twenty minutes. and the Cougars destroyed twelve German bombers in all. Following this success, however, it was five days before the squadron scored another kill. In the interval, the crews, still maintaining their schedule of nine sorties per night, had little to report. One night an engine in W/C Hiltz’s Mosquito failed on the <b>take-off</b> <b>run</b> and the aircraft, swerving off the runway, crashed into [...] "A" [...] Flight dispersal. The crews escaped injury, but many buildings went up in flames. During an operation that resulted in the thirteenth kill of the period, one aircraft crashed and its crew was unable to bail out. For the next week the weather was poor, which restricted night operations. Most of the crews that did go out had to be diverted to other bases on their return. German activity had also diminished by then and the beachhead was much quieter {{than it had been in}} mid-June. On the first two nights in July there were no sorties at all. Then the weather improved and the nightly round of nine patrols was resumed.|$|E

5|$|The {{airframe}} {{was also}} subdivided into sections to allow {{transport by road}} or rail. The wings were of standard Junkers double-wing construction. This gave the Ju 87 considerable advantage on take-off; even at a shallow angle, large lift forces were created through the aerofoil, reducing <b>take-off</b> and landing <b>runs.</b>|$|R
50|$|At an {{elevation}} of 4334 m above sea level, Qamdo Airport was formerly the highest airport in the world. It was surpassed by Daocheng Yading Airport, with {{an elevation}} of 4411 m, on 16 September 2013. It still has the longest publicly used paved runway in the world, at 5.5 km, a necessary feature due to the reduction in engine and lift performance that aircraft are subject to at altitude, requiring higher than normal lift-off speeds and therefore longer <b>take-off</b> (and landing) <b>runs.</b>|$|R

40|$|Data {{obtained}} at the N. A. C. A. tank from {{tests on the}} models of three flying-boat hulls - N. A. C. A. models 11 -A, 16, and 22 - are used to demonstrate the effect of trim angle on water resistance.

Total-resistance curves for best trimmed angles and other angles are compared for the same example. The effect of wind on best trim angles and upon the <b>take-off</b> and <b>run</b> is shown by the working of an example. The possibility of using tank data on trim angles as aid in piloting is discussed, and an instrument for use in determining the trim angle of seaplanes is described. The importance of maintaining the best trim angle throughout the take-off is indicated...|$|R
40|$|A {{performance}} analysis {{has been made}} to determine whether boundary-layer control by suction might reduce the minimum take-off and landing distances of a four-place or five-place airplane or a liaison type of airplane below those obtainable with conventional high-lift devices. The airplane was assumed to have a cruise duration of 5 hours at 60 -percent power and to be operating from airstrips having a ground friction coefficient of 0. 2 or a combined ground and braking coefficient of 0. 4. The payload was fixed at 1500 pounds, the wing span was varied from 25 to 100 feet, the aspect ratio was varied from 5 to 15, and the power was varied from 300 to 1300 horsepower. Maximum lift coefficients of 5. 0 and 2. 8 were assumed for the airplanes with and without boundary-layer-control [...] equipment weight was included. The effects of the boundary-layer control on total take-off distance, total power-off landing distance, landing and <b>take-off</b> ground <b>run,</b> stalling speed, sinking speed, and gliding speed were determined...|$|R
50|$|The first {{prototype}} flew on 13 November 1947 {{powered by}} two Rolls-Royce Nene engines of 5,000 lbf (22.2 kN) thrust each. This {{was followed by}} the second prototype on 1 September 1948 with the lower-powered (3,500 lbf/15.5 kN) Rolls Royce Derwent. Trials were disappointing: laminar flow could not be maintained, so maximum speeds, though respectable, were less than expected. As in any tail-less aircraft, <b>take-off</b> and landing <b>runs</b> were longer than for a conventional aircraft (at similar wing loadings) because at high angles of attack, downward elevon forces were much greater than those of elevators with their large moment.|$|R
