5|$|Article 9 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore, {{specifically}} Article 9(1), {{guarantees the}} right to life and {{the right to}} personal liberty. The Court of Appeal has called {{the right to life}} <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>basic</b> of human rights, but has yet to fully define the term in the Constitution. Contrary to the broad position taken in jurisdictions such as Malaysia and the United States, the High Court of Singapore has said that personal liberty only refers to freedom from unlawful incarceration or detention.|$|E

5|$|Hopping or jumping is conceptually <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>basic</b> {{mechanism}} for diffusion of adatoms. In this model, the adatoms reside on adsorption {{sites on the}} surface lattice. Motion occurs through successive jumps to adjacent sites, the number of which depends {{on the nature of}} the surface lattice. Figures 1 and 3 both display adatoms undergoing diffusion via the hopping process. Studies have shown the presence of metastable transition states between adsorption sites wherein it may be possible for adatoms to temporarily reside.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, Noam Chomsky {{formulated}} the generative {{theory of}} language. According to this theory, <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>basic</b> form of {{language is a}} set of syntactic rules that is universal for all humans and which underlies the grammars of all human languages. This set of rules is called Universal Grammar; for Chomsky, describing it is the primary objective of the discipline of linguistics. Thus, he considered that the grammars of individual languages are only of importance to linguistics insofar as they allow us to deduce the universal underlying rules from which the observable linguistic variability is generated.|$|E
5|$|One-day {{track and}} field {{meetings}} form {{the most common and}} seasonal aspect of the sport – they are <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>basic</b> level of {{track and field}} competition. Meetings are generally organised annually either under the patronage of an educational institution or sports club, or by a group or business that serves as the meeting promoter. In the case of the former, athletes are selected to represent their club or institution. In the case of privately run or independent meetings, athletes participate on an invitation-only basis.|$|E

In primary education, students are taught to add numbers in the decimal system, starting with single digits and progressively tackling more difficult problems. Mechanical aids range from the ancient abacus to the modern computer, where research on the most efficient implementations of addition continues to this day.|$|E
5|$|The arcade {{release of}} Cross Generation of Heroes has a control scheme {{consisting}} of a joystick and four buttons. Wii versions of Tatsunoko vs. Capcom have five control options: the Classic Controller, Nintendo GameCube controller, third-party arcade sticks, and two simplified control schemes—intended for inexperienced players—for the Wii Remote. Players use controller inputs to perform attacks; <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>basic</b> attacks are executed by pressing one of three attack buttons: light, medium, or strong. Players may augment basic attacks with joystick or control pad directional inputs; for example, a standard strong attack can become a sweep when the down input is added. Basic attacks can be strung together to perform combos.|$|E
5|$|The {{hydroxides}} {{themselves are}} <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>basic</b> hydroxides known, reacting with acids to give salts and with alcohols to give oligomeric alkoxides. They easily react with carbon dioxide to form carbonates or bicarbonates, or with hydrogen sulfide to form sulfides or bisulfides, {{and may be}} used to separate thiols from petroleum. They react with amphoteric oxides: for example, the oxides of aluminium, zinc, tin, and lead react with the alkali metal hydroxides to give aluminates, zincates, stannates, and plumbates. Silicon dioxide is acidic, and thus the alkali metal hydroxides can also attack silicate glass.|$|E

The Barracks produces all non-magical combat units, including melee, ranged, mounted, and siege units. However all except <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>basic</b> also need assistance from other buildings, some of which can also upgrade units.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>basic</b> {{property}} of the Reuleaux triangle {{is that it has}} constant width, meaning that for every pair of parallel supporting lines (two lines of the same slope that both touch the shape without crossing through it) the two lines have the same Euclidean distance from each other, regardless of the orientation of these lines. In any pair of parallel supporting lines, one of the two lines will necessarily touch the triangle at one of its vertices. The other supporting line may touch the triangle at any point on the opposite arc, and their distance (the width of the Reuleaux triangle) equals the radius of this arc.|$|E
5|$|All the {{alkali metals}} react vigorously or explosively with cold water, {{producing}} an aqueous solution of a strongly basic alkali metal hydroxide and releasing hydrogen gas. This reaction becomes more vigorous {{going down the}} group: lithium reacts steadily with effervescence, but sodium and potassium can ignite and rubidium and caesium sink in water and generate hydrogen gas so rapidly that shock waves form in the water that may shatter glass containers. When an alkali metal is dropped into water, it produces an explosion, {{of which there are}} two separate stages. The metal reacts with the water first, breaking the hydrogen bonds in the water and producing hydrogen gas; this takes place faster for the more reactive heavier alkali metals. Second, the heat generated by {{the first part of the}} reaction often ignites the hydrogen gas, causing it to burn explosively into the surrounding air. This secondary hydrogen gas explosion produces the visible flame above the bowl of water, lake or other body of water, not the initial reaction of the metal with water (which tends to happen mostly under water). The alkali metal hydroxides are <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>basic</b> known hydroxides.|$|E

5|$|Belgrano was {{appointed}} as {{captain of the}} urban militias in 1797 by viceroy Pedro de Melo, who was instructed by Spain to prepare defences against a possible British or Portuguese attack. Belgrano by then worked in the Consulate, and was no longer interested in pursuing a military career. Viceroy Rafael de Sobremonte requested that he create a militia to counter a possible British attack, {{but he did not}} take interest in it. His first intervention in a military conflict took place when the British, under William Carr Beresford, arrived with 1,600 men and took Buenos Aires, starting the British invasions of the Río de la Plata. Belgrano moved to the fortress as soon as he heard the warning, and gathered many men to launch resistance. But without the required knowledge, his men marched in disorder and Belgrano was ordered to disband after a single British cannon shot. Belgrano would write later in his autobiography that he regretted not having by then even <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>basic</b> knowledge of militia work.|$|E
5|$|Fifty light {{infantry}} {{men were}} in pursuit of Mercer's men when a fresh brigade of 1,100 militiamen {{under the command of}} Cadwalader appeared. Mawhood gathered his men who were all over the battlefield and put them into battle line formation. Meanwhile, Sullivan was at a standoff with the detachment of the 55th Regiment that had come to assist the 40th Regiment, neither daring to move towards the main battle for risk of exposing its flank. Cadwalader attempted to move his men into a battle line but they had no combat experience and did not know even <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>basic</b> military maneuvers. When his men {{reached the top of the}} hill and saw Mercer's men fleeing from the British, most of the militia turned around and ran back down the hill.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{detailed}} analysis of KBOs was impossible, and so astronomers were only able to determine <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>basic</b> facts about their makeup, primarily their color. These first data showed {{a broad range of}} colors among KBOs, ranging from neutral grey to deep red. This suggested that their surfaces were composed {{of a wide range of}} compounds, from dirty ices to hydrocarbons. This diversity was startling, as astronomers had expected KBOs to be uniformly dark, having lost most of the volatile ices from their surfaces to the effects of cosmic rays. Various solutions were suggested for this discrepancy, including resurfacing by impacts or outgassing. Jewitt and Luu's spectral analysis of the known Kuiper belt objects in 2001 found that the variation in color was too extreme to be easily explained by random impacts. The radiation from the Sun is thought to have chemically altered methane on the surface of KBOs, producing products such as tholins. Makemake has been shown to possess a number of hydrocarbons derived from the radiation-processing of methane, including ethane, ethylene and acetylene.|$|E
