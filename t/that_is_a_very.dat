25|$|Speaking {{before the}} opening of the Ordinary Synod of Bishops on the Family in October 2015, McAleese {{ridiculed}} the concept of 300 elderly celibates coming together to discuss family questions. Addressing a meeting of the Global Network of Rainbow (LGBT) Catholics {{on the eve of the}} Vatican’s Synod on the Family, former president McAleese said: “In the days when I was president, we had workshops on various issues and if I wanted to look at an issue, I would consult the experts... But look at the Synod, I have to ask the question: If I wanted expertise on the family, I honestly cannot say that the first thing that would come into my mind would be to call together 300 celibate males who, as far we know, have never raised a child...“Let me repeat a question I asked last year when I saw the Vatican’s lengthy pre-Synod questionnaire, namely how many of these men have ever changed a child’s nappy? For me <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> important question because it is one thing to say that we all grew up in families, we had mothers, we had fathers but it is a very different thing to raise a gay child, a very different thing to live daily in a relationship and to police the relationships between children and the world.” Acknowledging that the Synod will doubtless be considering the Catholic Church's pastoral approach to homosexuals, McAleese described herself as “cynical” about the outcome of the forthcoming three week consultation.|$|E

500|$|Luke Butcher {{noted that}} Ingels taps into metamodern sensibility, {{adopting}} a metamodern attitude; but he [...] "seems to oscillate between modern positions and postmodern ones, a certain out-of-this-worldness and a definite down-to-earthness, naivety and knowingness, idealism and the practical." [...] Sustainable development {{and renewable energy}} are important to Ingels, which {{he refers to as}} [...] "hedonistic sustainability". He has said that [...] "It's not about what we give up to be sustainable, it's about what we get. And <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> attractive and marketable concept." ...|$|E

On her character and work with Beagan, Leoni said: [...] "Agent Denham is your standard-issue, ball-breaking FBI agent. She's certainly a very tough lady, and it's not my first waltz {{with this type of}} character. However, I was able {{to spend some time with}} Anne, a great technical advisor we had on set. She's got this steely gaze that is terrifying, but what's underneath <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> interesting lady. Beyond the technical aspects of the job, she provided so much more for me to use." ...|$|E
500|$|Other {{actors who}} portrayed mutants were: Meiling Melançon as Psylocke, a mutant {{with the ability}} to {{teleport}} herself through areas of shadow; Omahyra Mota as Arclight, a mutant who has the ability to generate shock waves of concussive force; Ken Leung as Kid Omega, a mutant {{with the ability to}} eject spikes from his body, most notably his face (though the character resembles the comic books' character Quill however, the official cast credits read [...] "Kid Omega"); and Cameron Bright as Jimmy / Leech, a mutant who has the ability to neutralize the powers of nearby mutants. Various characters were included at the suggestion of editor Mark Helfrich, who brought Marvel's X-Men Encyclopedia to director Brett Ratner, searching for mutants who could make appearance. Mark Helfrich portrays an unnamed mutant with ash-gray skin. These include Phat, a mutant <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> large man who can slim down to fit in a smaller space (played by two actors, Via Saleaumua – [...] "large mode" [...] – and Richard Yee – [...] "small mode"); Spike (played by Lance Gibson), a mutant who battles Wolverine in the forest by extruding bony spikes from his flesh – the character was added because the editing team felt that the original cut of the scene portrayed Logan as a cold-blooded killer, which could be changed if another mutant attacked Wolverine before he struck the Brotherhood and Glob Herman (played by Clayton Dean Watmough), a mutant with transparent skin. Various other mutants make cameos at the X-Mansion; Shauna Kain and Kea Wong reprised their cameo roles as Siryn and Jubilee respectively, and three identical girls in the background in one scene are a reference to the Stepford Cuckoos. Olivia Williams portrays Moira MacTaggert. X-Men co-creator Stan Lee and writer Chris Claremont have cameos in the film's opening scene as the neighbors of young Jean Grey. The sergeant directing defensive preparations before the Brotherhood assaults Alcatraz Island is played by R. Lee Ermey. Lloyd Adams portrays the green-skinned mutant that climbs the guard tower on Alcatraz. Many fans believed this was Toad however, the credits list him as lizard man and Brett Ratner confirmed it was Anole. Avalanche and Vanisher also appear however it is not known who portrayed them.|$|E

They were just fulfilling a duty to have a black face in the show. The way most blacks are often portrayed on television reinforces the image of them as gangsters, pimps, whores and freaks. EastEnders could have helped provide a positive role model but they didn't take the opportunity." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dr. Irv Bromberg has {{proposed}} a 353-year cycle of 4366 months, which would include 130 leap months, along with use of a progressively shorter molad interval, which would keep an amended fixed arithmetic Hebrew calendar from drifting {{for more than seven}} millennia. It takes about 3 centuries for the spring equinox to drift an average of th of a molad interval earlier in the Hebrew calendar. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> important time unit, because it can be cancelled by simply truncating a 19-year cycle to 11 years, omitting 8 years including three leap years from the sequence.
