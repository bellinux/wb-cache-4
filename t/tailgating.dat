5|$|In 1993, {{the stretch}} of Highway401 {{eastbound}} near Milton and westbound near Whitby had chevrons painted in each lane {{in an effort to}} reduce <b>tailgating,</b> a concept borrowed from France and Britain. Signs advised motorists to keep at least two chevrons apart, in essence warning them not to follow too closely.|$|E
5|$|Homecoming {{coincides with}} a home {{football}} game, and festivities such as <b>tailgating</b> and a formal dance are sponsored by the Alumni Association to draw past graduates back to campus. The largest planned sports related celebration is the first basketball practice of the season. Dubbed Midnight Madness, this event introduces the men's and women's basketball teams shortly after midnight {{on the first day}} the teams are allowed by NCAA rules to formally practice together. In 2013, Georgetown hosted the east regional finals round of the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament.|$|E
25|$|LSU has {{continually}} been {{ranked as}} the top <b>tailgating</b> location in the country. ESPN.com ranked LSU {{as the top}} <b>tailgating</b> destination in America. LSU's <b>tailgating</b> was named No. 1 in an Associated Press poll on top <b>tailgating</b> spots and by a CNN network survey on top <b>tailgating</b> locations.|$|E
50|$|The Estate Wagons also {{featured}} a new 'clamshell' <b>tailgate</b> design, marketed as the Glide-away <b>Tailgate,</b> where the rear power-operated glass slid {{up into the}} roof as the lower <b>tailgate</b> (manually or with power assist), slid into a recess under the cargo floor. Ultimately, the manual lower <b>tailgate</b> was supplanted by the power <b>tailgate.</b> The <b>tailgate</b> system was operated by switches on the instrument panel or a key switch on the rear quarter panel. Like a top-hinged <b>tailgate,</b> the clamshell design allowed a user to stand directly at the open cargo area without impediment, facilitating loading and unloading in tight spaces.|$|R
50|$|Most other {{full-body}} SUVs {{produced at}} the time (e.g. Nissan Pathfinder, Ford Explorer) featured <b>tailgates</b> that opened upward with the glass closed. In contrast, the second generation 4Runner carried over the retractable-glass <b>tailgate</b> from the first generation. Opening these <b>tailgates</b> requires first retracting the rear window into the <b>tailgate</b> and then lowering the <b>tailgate</b> much like as on a pickup truck.|$|R
50|$|In Chevrolet GMC C/K pickup trucks, {{the term}} {{refers to the}} <b>tailgate</b> {{attachment}} points. Rather than using conventional <b>tailgate</b> hinges, trunnions are used to permit quick toolless removal and installation of the pickup <b>tailgate.</b>|$|R

5000|$|If {{the door}} is hinged at the bottom it is termed a <b>tailgate,</b> {{particularly}} in the United States. A bottom opening door is common on a station wagon, pickup truck, or sport utility vehicle (SUV). Traditional U.S. station wagons included a roll down window. Because {{of the potential for}} carbon-monoxide fumes, the <b>tailgate</b> window on station wagons should be closed whenever the engine is running. <b>Tailgates</b> may contain accessories like a [...] "pocket" [...] for storage purposes. Traditional station wagon and pickup <b>tailgates</b> can also serve as a mount for a workbench. A 3-way <b>tailgate</b> is hinged at the side and bottom so it can be opened sideways like a car door, or downwards like a truck <b>tailgate.</b> The window can be opened to load small items. The door and hinge mechanisms of the 3-way <b>tailgate</b> are designed with special handle(s) for opening in the selected direction. In the late 1970s, it was the most common station wagon <b>tailgate</b> arrangement.|$|R

25|$|Iowa State is well {{regarded}} for <b>tailgating.</b> The {{layout of}} Jack Trice Stadium on a flood-plain accommodates ample parking space immediately surrounding the stadium. Cyclone fans typically arrive hours before kick-off in large SUVs and RVs to grill popular Midwestern {{foods such as}} pork loin, bratwurst, hamburgers and hot dogs.|$|E
25|$|Driving in Germany is {{regulated}} by the Straßenverkehrs-Ordnung (road traffic regulations, abbreviated StVO). Enforcement on the federal Autobahnen is handled by each State's Highway Patrol (Autobahnpolizei), often using unmarked police cars and motorcycles and usually equipped with video cameras, thus allowing easier enforcement of laws such as <b>tailgating.</b> Notable laws include the following.|$|E

2500|$|... 1971–1976 model {{full-size}} station wagons {{featured a}} 'Clamshell' design where the rear power-operated glass slid {{up into the}} roof as the <b>tailgate</b> (manually or with power assist), dropped below the load floor. The power <b>tailgate,</b> the first in station wagon history, ultimately supplanted the manual <b>tailgate,</b> which required marked effort to lift from storage.|$|R
50|$|With the {{downsized}} 1977 model, the Catalina Safari {{got a new}} two-way <b>tailgate</b> {{that could}} be opened to the side as a door or lowered as a <b>tailgate</b> which replaced the more complicated 1971-76 clamshell <b>tailgate</b> design. The wagons also shared the same full-coil spring suspension as their sedan counterparts, rather than the multi-leaf springs found on 1971-76 Safaris.|$|R
25|$|<b>Tailgating</b> is {{very popular}} outside Beaver Stadium. Alcohol is {{permitted}} in all areas around Beaver Stadium on home football games, except inside Beaver Stadium and the Bryce Jordan Center (Alcohol is permitted inside Medlar Field at Lubrano Park, but only alcohol purchased inside the ballpark). Both the Bryce Jordan Center and Medlar Field at Lubrano Park are open for special events before kickoff during home football games.|$|E
25|$|The District {{is located}} near the {{intersection}} of US Highway 49 and Hardy Street. The historic district of campus is anchored by the five original buildings of the campus: Ogletree Alumni House, The Honor House, College Hall, Forrest Hall, and Hattiesburg Hall. It is also the traditional <b>tailgating</b> site for students during football season. It is home to Lake Byron, which {{has served as a}} focal point for many university activities and several weddings.|$|E
25|$|With {{access to}} the golf course fairways, Levi's Stadium now had 31,600 {{potential}} parking spaces, meaning that <b>tailgating</b> and weeknight games were now a possibility. However, the NFL decided not to schedule any weeknight home games at Levi's Stadium in 2014 until traffic flow within the area is figured out, {{with the exception of}} a Thanksgiving game between the 49ers and the Seattle Seahawks on November 27, 2014. Parking prices, which averaged $30 in the 49ers' final season at Candlestick Park, will increase to $40 at Levi's Stadium.|$|E
50|$|The second {{generation}} K5 models incorporated the rear hatch glass and <b>tailgate</b> {{into a single}} unit, which allowed the glass panel to retract inside of the <b>tailgate</b> by use of a manual crank mounted on the <b>tailgate</b> or an electric motor activated by a key-operated switch on the <b>tailgate</b> and a dash-mounted switch. The weight of the large glass panel was rumored to be a liability as the manual crank gears wore prematurely and the electric motor was prone to frequent overheating and subsequent failure. This also included the electric motor drive cable which goes to the window regulator to the motor (similar in design to a speedometer cable), which usually would fail under heavy abuse. Another feature of the K5 Blazer <b>tailgate</b> was the safety switch connected to the electric motor which prevented the rear window from being raised if the <b>tailgate</b> was unlatched.|$|R

25|$|Under {{the terms}} of the lease that the Rams signed in St. Louis, the Edward Jones Dome was {{required}} to be ranked in the top tier of NFL stadiums through the 2015 season. The Rams were free to break the lease and either relocate without penalty or continue to lease the Dome on a year-to-year basis. In May 2012, the Dome was ranked by Time magazine as the 7th worst major sports stadium in the United States. In a 2008 Sports Illustrated poll, St. Louis fans ranked it the worst of any NFL stadium with particularly low marks for <b>tailgating,</b> affordability and atmosphere.|$|E
25|$|W+K {{contracted}} {{production company}} Gorgeous Enterprises to handle {{production of the}} four television spots. Direction would be split between Frank Budgen (Tag, Racing, and Shaderunner) and Tom Carty (<b>Tailgating).</b> Budgen, known for his previous work on spots such as Bet on Black for Guinness and Hero's Return for Stella Artois, immediately began assembling a crew and scouting potential locations for the shoot. When the team arrived at the final location, several blocked-off streets of the Canadian city of Toronto, the weather was bad enough to force the team to rewrite the script in order to finish on schedule.|$|E
25|$|The {{official}} Ram Jam {{was started}} by the Alumni Association in 2003 and has grown to become the large pregame football <b>tailgating</b> parties they are today. During the fall semester outside the Legrand Alumni Center, students, alumni, and community members park their cars {{in the parking lot}} and hang out around the center to grill and socialize. The events also feature local bands to provide entertainment, free food and refreshments, bounce houses and other games for kids, and alcoholic beverages for those 21 and up. The Ram Band, the ASU dance team, the Angelettes, and the ASU Cheerleaders also perform and everyone walks over to the stadium prior to the game.|$|E

Arcee was {{a participant in the}} Great War and originally was partnered with <b>Tailgate.</b> During one mission, she talked to <b>Tailgate</b> on comm before being captured by Airachnid for interrogation. Arcee was tied up and refused to talk. To try to make her talk, Airachnid captured <b>Tailgate</b> and threatened to kill him. When she still didn't talk, Airachnid slaughtered him before her very eyes. After <b>Tailgate</b> was killed, Arcee was saved by Bumblebee and Cliffjumper. She began working alone and distancing herself from others to cope with her grief.|$|R
5000|$|It {{is also an}} {{informal}} name for General Motors full-size station wagons, manufactured from 1971 to 1976, that featured a complex, two-piece [...] "disappearing" [...] <b>tailgate,</b> officially known as the [...] "Glide Away" [...] <b>tailgate.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Grand Safari wagons also {{featured}} a new 'Clamshell' <b>tailgate</b> design, marketed as the Glide-away <b>Tailgate,</b> where the rear power-operated glass slid {{up into the}} roof as the <b>tailgate</b> (manually or with power assist), slid into a recess under the cargo floor. The power <b>tailgate,</b> the first in station wagon history, ultimately supplanted the manual <b>tailgate,</b> which required marked effort to lift from storage. The power system was operated by switches on the instrument panel or a key switch on the rear quarter panel. The Clamshell system, heavy and complex, {{made it easier to}} load and unload the extremely long wagons in tight spaces. But it remained unique to GM, and would be subsequently eliminated when GM reduced the length of their wagons by about a foot in 1977, and the overriding concern became increased fuel economy.|$|R
25|$|Little Rock's War Memorial Stadium plays host to {{at least}} one University of Arkansas Razorback {{football}} game each year. The stadium is known for being {{in the middle of a}} golf course. Each fall, the city closes the golf course on Razorback football weekends for fans to tailgate. It is estimated that over 80,000 people are present for the <b>tailgating</b> activities on these weekends. War Memorial also hosts the Arkansas High School football state championships, and starting in the fall of 2006 hosts one game apiece for the University of Central Arkansas and the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff. Arkansas State University also plays at the stadium from time to time.|$|E
25|$|The {{commercial}} premiered on American {{television on}} 25 June 2001, and ran until Labor Day (3 September). It {{was supported by}} three additional television and cinema commercials, titled Shaderunner, <b>Tailgating,</b> and Racing, which ran concurrently. There was also a significant offline campaign, comprising public events {{in the streets of}} major American cities, and invitation-only parties at Niketown stores attended by celebrities. Tag, and its associated campaign, were a huge critical success, garnering dozens of awards from the advertising and television industries, including the Grand Prix at the prestigious Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival. Tag was one of the ten most-awarded commercials of 2002, and its impact was such that in 2010 it was voted one of the top ten advertisements of the decade by Campaign magazine.|$|E
25|$|Levi's Stadium has {{received}} some backlash from season ticket holders, who are unhappy regarding rules that won’t {{allow them to}} print their tickets until 72 hours before the game, making re-sale very difficult. In addition, older 49ers fans say that people are more segmented at Levi's Stadium in comparison to Candlestick Park, leaving tailgaters with large expanses of empty parking stalls and a more desolate <b>tailgating</b> experience. Levi's Stadium has also received heavy criticism for the way fans are treated on hot days during early-season afternoon games. The majority of fans are seated {{on the east side}} of the stadium and during these afternoon games, they are exposed to the sun as there is no shade provided due to the lack of overhangs. With the climate of Santa Clara being much warmer than San Francisco, it makes watching games on hot days uncomfortable for fans as they are less accommodated for exposure to the sun than are patrons at other stadiums in hot-weather climates. Several fans suffered heat exhaustion during preseason and early season afternoon games. This has led to the eastern stands being largely empty on hot days.|$|E
40|$|There are {{currently}} no methods that provide mine operators with reliable <b>tailgate</b> support design. The reliance on experience or at worst, {{trial and error}} for <b>tailgate</b> support design is a major contributing factor responsible for longwall downtime and has potentially catastrophic consequences. An ongoing approach to <b>tailgate</b> support design seeks to better understand <b>tailgate</b> strata mechanics and {{the interaction between the}} strata, installed support and longwall powered support. The approach combining empirical and analytical methods for roadway layout and detailed gateroad support design is an alternative to statistically based assessments. It is also expected to provide greater rigour for pillar design where roadway serviceability is a key determinant...|$|R
50|$|Prior to 1961, all Ford wagons used a two-piece <b>tailgate</b> {{assembly}} {{that required}} the operator to lift the rear window up and locking it into place via a mechanical support, and then drop the tail gate down to fully access the rear compartment. For 1961, Ford introduced a redesigned <b>tailgate</b> assembly using a self-storing window feature which could either be rolled down into the gate via crank {{on the outside of}} the gate, or by an electrical motor actuated by the key or an interior switch. A safety lockout measure required that the rear window had to be fully retracted into the <b>tailgate</b> before the <b>tailgate</b> could be lowered.|$|R
5000|$|The {{station wagon}} (estate) version was {{introduced}} at the 1962 Stockholm Auto Show, and Volvo manufactured 73,000 examples between 1962 and 1969. The Amazon estate featured a two-piece <b>tailgate,</b> {{with the lower}} section folding down to provide a load surface and the upper section that hinged overhead. The vehicle's rear license plate, attached to the lower <b>tailgate,</b> could fold [...] "up" [...] such that when the <b>tailgate</b> was lowered and the vehicle in use, the license plate was still visible. This idea {{was used by the}} original 1959 Mini. In recent years a similar arrangement was used on the <b>tailgate</b> of the Subaru Baja.|$|R
