5|$|Californium is a {{radioactive}} {{chemical element}} with symbol Cf and atomic number98. The element was first synthesized in 1950 at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (then the University of California Radiation Laboratory), by bombarding curium with alpha particles (helium-4 ions). It is an actinide element, the sixth transuranium element to be synthesized, {{and has the}} second-highest atomic mass of all the elements that have been produced in amounts large enough <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>with</b> the unaided eye (after einsteinium). The element was named after {{the university and the}} state of California.|$|E
5|$|Some bathhouses have areas {{designed}} to facilitate impersonal sex. These areasrooms or hallwaysare illuminated {{only by a}} (dim) red exit sign. It is possible to have sex, but not <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>with</b> whom. Other bathhouses, such as the Continental Baths in New York or the Club Baths in Washington, D.C., have two or more bunkbeds in close proximity, in a public area. This provides a place to have sex for those who could afford only a locker, and facilitated exhibitionism and voyeurism for those so inclined. Baths often have a (porn) TV room or snack bar where patrons can recuperate between orgasms.|$|E
5|$|Another {{definition}} of the GCD is helpful in advanced mathematics, particularly ring theory. The greatest common divisor g of two nonzero numbers a and b is also their smallest positive integral linear combination, that is, the smallest positive number of the form ua+vb where u and v are integers. The set of all integral linear combinations of a and b is actually {{the same as the}} set of all multiples of g (mg, where m is an integer). In modern mathematical language, the ideal generated by a and b is the ideal generated byg alone (an ideal generated by a single element is called a principal ideal, and all ideals of the integers are principal ideals). Some properties of the GCD are in fact easier <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>with</b> this description, for instance the fact that any common divisor of a and b also divides the GCD (it divides both terms of ua+vb). The equivalence of this GCD definition with the other definitions is described below.|$|E

5|$|For Thanksgiving 1988, {{his family}} spent the holiday with him, {{although}} he had developed neuropathy and was increasingly bed-ridden and reliant on morphine; he died in his bed on December 16, 1988 {{at the age of}} 41. Sylvester had planned his own funeral, insisting that he be dressed in a red kimono and placed in an open-top coffin for the mourners <b>to</b> <b>see,</b> <b>with</b> his friend Yvette Flunder doing his corpse's makeup. He wanted Tracy to sing at his funeral, accompanied by choirs and many flowers. The whole affair took place in his church, the Love Center, with a sermon being provided by Reverend Walter Hawkins. The event was packed, with standing room only, and the coffin was subsequently taken and buried at his family's plot in Inglewood Park Cemetery. An album titled Immortal was posthumously released; it contained Sylvester's final studio recordings, and was compiled by Marty Blecman.|$|E
5|$|On 19 November 1940, a {{train with}} workers from Trondheim {{to the airport}} {{collided}} with the local train from Kopperå just east of Hommelvik Station. The Hommelvik train disaster killed 22 people. The trains {{were supposed to have}} passed at Homnmelvik Station, but the engineer thought he had seen the other train, and had left the station. The accident occurred at 08:03, and was caused by there being virtually no light <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>with,</b> since all outdoor sources of light were covered. On 23 January 1941, a coke and coal train from Sweden lost its braking between the border and Kopperå. The six back cars plus the caboose derailed just west of Kopperå Station, while the locomotive and 17 other trains continued their wild flight. The train derailed at Meråker Station, and the Meråker train disaster killed both the engineer and the stoker.|$|E

25|$|That Milburn had {{an earlier}} history on its present site is clearly signalled by the field-system {{radiating}} {{from the existing}} village. The evidence of a typical medieval layout is plain <b>to</b> <b>see,</b> <b>with</b> long narrow fields separated by hedges where groups of strips from the old open town fields have been brought together. This evidence is further underlined by remnants of ridge and furrow {{in many of the}} fields. However Roberts argues that village development was taking place in most cases before 1200 and in some cases as much as two centuries earlier.|$|E
25|$|Because the {{individual}} lenses are so small, {{the effects of}} diffraction impose a limit on the possible resolution that can be obtained (assuming they do not function as phased arrays). This can only be countered by increasing lens size and number. <b>To</b> <b>see</b> <b>with</b> a resolution comparable to our simple eyes, humans would require compound eyes that would each reach {{the size of their}} heads. Compound eyes fall into two groups: apposition eyes, which form multiple inverted images, and superposition eyes, which form a single erect image. Compound eyes grow at their margins by the addition of new ommatidia.|$|E

25|$|Rows 1–4 of the midband are {{specialised}} for colour vision, from ultraviolet to longer wavelengths. Their UV vision {{can detect}} five different frequency bands {{in the deep}} ultraviolet. To do this they use two photoreceptors in combination with four different colour filters. They are not currently believed {{to be sensitive to}} infrared light. The optical elements in these rows have eight different classes of visual pigments and the rhabdom (area of eye that absorbs light from a single direction) is divided into three different pigmented layers (tiers), each for different wavelengths. The three tiers in rows 2 and 3 are separated by colour filters (intrarhabdomal filters) that can be divided into four distinct classes, two classes in each row. It is organised like a sandwich; a tier, a colour filter of one class, a tier again, a colour filter of another class, and then a last tier. These colour filters allow the mantis shrimp <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>with</b> diverse colour vision. Without the filters, the pigments themselves range only a small segment of the visual spectrum: about 490-550nm. Rows 5–6 are also segregated into different tiers, but have only one class of visual pigment (a ninth class) and are specialised for polarisation vision. They can detect different planes of polarised light. A tenth class of visual pigment is found in the upper and lower hemispheres of the eye.|$|E
25|$|With {{millions}} of others I had prayed hard {{at the time of}} Dunkirk and never did prayer seem to be more speedily answered to the full. And we prayed for France and the next day she surrendered. I thought much, and when I went to bed I lay for a long time vividly awake. And I went over in my mind what had happened, concentrating on the thoughts that you had dwelt on, that prayer to be effective must be in accordance with God's will, and that by far the hardest thing to say from the heart and indeed the last lesson we learn (if we ever do) is to say and mean it, ‘Thy will be done.’ And I thought what mites we all are and how we can never see God's plan, a plan on such a scale that it must be incomprehensible. And suddenly for what must have been a couple of minutes I seemed <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>with</b> extraordinary and vivid clarity and to hear someone speaking to me. The words at the time were clear, but the recollection of them had passed when I seemed to come to, as it were, but the sense remained, and the sense was this. ‘You cannot see the plan’; then ‘Have you not thought there is a purpose in stripping you one by one of all the human props on which you depend, that you are being left alone in the world? You have now one upon whom to lean and I have chosen you as my instrument to work with my will. Why then are you afraid?’ And to prove ourselves worthy of that tremendous task is our job.|$|E
500|$|Any {{method of}} {{counting}} layers eventually runs into difficulties as {{the flow of}} the ice causes the layers to become thinner and harder <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>with</b> increasing depth. [...] The problem is more acute at locations where accumulation is high; low accumulation sites, such as central Antarctica, must be dated by other methods. [...] For example, at Vostok, layer counting is only possible down to an age of 55,000 years.|$|E

[...] Burton said of the singing, [...] "You can't just lip synch, you'd see the throat and the breath, every take they all had to belt it out. It was very enjoyable for me <b>to</b> <b>see,</b> <b>with</b> music on the set everybody just moved differently.
