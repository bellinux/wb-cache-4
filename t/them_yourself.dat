6000|$|... 'That {{is easily}} explained,' said Berenger. 'You know well, sir, {{that they were}} to {{facilitate}} my search at La Sablerie. You shall see <b>them</b> <b>yourself,</b> sir.|$|E
6000|$|... "Fashion," [...] said he, {{taking up}} his change. [...] "Fashion {{is all the}} go with you ladies--and always was. You'll be wearing <b>'em</b> <b>yourself</b> before {{a couple of years}} is out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not at all; but they'll {{be getting}} stiff {{if they think}} you're so thick with him as is their inimy--and isn't that natural too? It's only {{to come down and}} say a kind word or so to <b>'em</b> <b>yourself,</b> and you'll find them all right--and ready to stand by you and yours to the last, Mr. Thady." ...|$|R
5000|$|All mankind are heir to {{troubles}} {{and no one}} is interested in yours, so keep <b>them</b> to <b>yourself.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you are on}} {{the terrace}} just after lunch, you will find them there, and may feed <b>them</b> <b>yourself,</b> if you like" [...] was the cool, civil reply.|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{they need}} never know," [...] cried Pan-at-lee, [...] "that {{you have seen}} him unless you tell <b>them</b> <b>yourself</b> for as Jad-ben-Otho is my witness I will never betray you." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{relief was}} so great that Bathurst turned away, unable for a while to {{continue}} the conversation. When he resumed the talk, he asked, [...] "Did you see <b>them</b> <b>yourself,</b> Rujub?" ...|$|E
6000|$|BIGELOW--[Distractedly.] For {{the love}} of God, if you have such thoughts, keep <b>them</b> to <b>yourself.</b> I won't listen! You make me despise life! ...|$|R
60|$|All {{of these}} things are told at Tavistock town even to this day; and if you go thither, you may hear <b>them</b> for <b>yourself.</b>|$|R

6000|$|... [Laughing.] But you must, you must. When shall I {{come for}} your answer? To-morrow? I'll {{come with the}} bills and Gerald's I.O.U. in my pocket, and you shall burn <b>them</b> <b>yourself.</b> Good-bye.|$|E
6000|$|... "Captain Lontano, the {{servants}} {{will show you}} a room where your men can guard the prisoners. You had better remain with <b>them</b> <b>yourself.</b> Let no one, except your own men, enter the room." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I'll {{tell you}} what, Dolly; I wish you'd let me ride two of yours {{for a couple}} of days,--that is, of course, if you don't want <b>them</b> <b>yourself.</b> You ain't tight now, at any rate.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You had best go upstairs, and see <b>them</b> for <b>yourself,</b> Roger. Your {{father and}} I have weighty matters to talk over, and would fain be alone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Bright niggers isn't {{no kind of}} 'vantage {{to their}} masters," [...] {{continued}} the other, well entrenched, in a coarse, unconscious obtuseness, from the contempt of his opponent; [...] "what's the use o' talents and them things, if you can't get the use on <b>'em</b> <b>yourself?</b> Why, all the use they make on 't is to get round you. I've had {{one or two of}} these fellers, and I jest sold 'em down river. I knew I'd got to lose 'em, first or last, if I didn't." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'If you bite your nails, for example. Then, {{when you}} don't want to bite your nails, bite <b>them,</b> make <b>yourself</b> bite <b>them.</b> And {{you would find}} the habit was broken.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I haven't dug them up yet--and {{it would}} serve you just right if I made you get <b>them</b> for <b>yourself.</b> But perhaps my friends here might help you--if you were civil." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not {{the shadow}} of one!" [...] the manager agreed. [...] "I don't care if--pardon me, sir--if you stole <b>them</b> <b>yourself!</b> The loss of those jewels would do the firm more harm than I can explain to you." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You got to hang {{your things}} on that hook, all but your shoes and stockings, {{and you got}} to hang on to <b>them,</b> <b>yourself.</b> Forty's your number, and forty's your hook, and they give you the clothes off'n it in the morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then," [...] said Flip, coolly, [...] "if you're not claimin' <b>'em</b> for <b>yourself,</b> and {{you hear}} father say they ain't his, I reckon the less {{you have to say}} about 'em the better." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But what {{on earth}} am I to write about?" [...] asked Crabbe. [...] "If a man has no cases, {{how in the world}} is he to {{describe}} <b>them?</b> Help <b>yourself</b> and pass the bottle." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "These {{toys are}} wonderfully bright and pretty. Why {{do you not}} keep <b>them</b> for <b>yourself?</b> It's a pity to give them to those noisy boys and fretful girls, who break and destroy them so quickly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is a great}} riddle, this, {{which we}} toss {{from one to the}} other," [...] he observed. [...] "I am the simple valet of two gentlemen living in the hotel. You have listened, perhaps, to fairy tales, or dreamed <b>them</b> <b>yourself,</b> sir." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am afraid, my dear, it {{is because}} you do not very clearly {{comprehend}} <b>them</b> <b>yourself.</b> You first say that everybody ought to visit everybody, and then you insist on it, you will visit none but those you think {{good enough to be}} visited by Mrs. Jared Jarvis." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{alluded to}} <b>them</b> <b>yourself.</b> You {{know that they}} cannot be forgotten. What do you expect? Let me also talk to you in figurative language.
