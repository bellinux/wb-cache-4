For seasons in which Boston would later win the World Series, the starting pitchers have a 33 record. For all seasons <b>that</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> post-season, Boston pitchers have an Opening Day record of 104.|$|E

25|$|Biotic {{metabolism}} {{is directly}} {{tied to the}} global cycling of elements and compounds on Earth. The geochemical environment fuels life, which then produces different molecules <b>that</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> the external environment. (This is directly relevant to biogeochemistry.) In addition, biochemical reactions are catalyzed by enzymes which sometimes prefer one isotope over others. For example, oxygenic photosynthesis is catalyzed by RuBisCO, which prefers carbon-12 over carbon-13, resulting in carbon isotope fractionation in the rock record.|$|E
25|$|With {{contemporary}} space industry's {{economic activity}} and the related private spaceflight, with the manufacturing industries, <b>that</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> Earth's orbit or beyond, delivering them to those regions will require further energy development. Researchers have contemplated space-based solar power for collecting solar power for use on Earth. Space-based solar power has been in research since the early 1970s. Space-based solar power would require construction of collector structures in space. The advantage over ground-based solar power is higher intensity of light, and no weather to interrupt power collection.|$|E
25|$|Modulus {{refers to}} the {{stiffness}} of the graphite, not the amount of material used {{or the number of}} graphite fibres incorporated into the sheets. Buying a rod based solely on the modulus rating is a mistake because other factors must be considered, for example, if the fisherman does not want the stiffest rod for light line techniques or cranking. In addition, other qualities must be incorporated in the graphite itself and the rod must be designed correctly to ensure the best performance and durability of the rod. The other components <b>that</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> a quality rod can also add significantly to the cost.|$|E

25|$|There {{was some}} {{speculation}} by financial analysts that the Dynegy-Ameren deal {{was a poor}} one. Julien Dumoulin-Smith, executive director of UBS Investment Research, said Dynegy is {{far more likely to}} shutter all five coal-powered plants rather than add pollution control devices. Dumoulin-Smith pointed out that the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued final rules on sulfur dioxide emissions <b>that</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> effect in July 2018. Because the Edwards plant is in an area of low air quality, EPA is likely to force Dynegy to close the plant anyway. The remaining four plants are borderline cases with the exception of Duck Creek Station which spent nearly US$800m on sulfur dioxide removal, and may also be forced to close if EPA regulations tighten in the future (a highly likely possibility, he said).|$|E

This has resulted in an estimated $1 billion in savings for consumers. The rates <b>that</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> effect in the individual market were 1.4 percentage points lower than the rates originally proposed by insurance companies, which equated to nearly $425 million in savings for consumers. In the small group market, rates <b>that</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> effect were 0.8 percentage points lower, which equated to over $600 million in savings.|$|R

[...] In recent years, author Clinton Heylin has noted that Them's 1966 recording of the song is [...] "that genuine rarity, a Dylan cover to match the original." [...] After Van Morrison left the band in 1966, Them spinoff group, The Belfast Gypsies, recorded a cover of the song on their 1967 album, Them Belfast Gypsies.|$|E
500|$|Former Nice {{mayor and}} {{cookbook}} author Jacques Médecin was a strict salad traditionalist. His 1972 cookbook Cuisine Nicoise: Recipes from a Mediterranean Kitchen {{called for the}} salad to be served in a wooden bowl rubbed with garlic, and excluded boiled vegetables: [...] "never, never, I beg you, include boiled potato or any other boiled vegetable in your salade niçoise." [...] Médecin wrote that the salad should be made [...] "predominately of tomatoes" [...] which should be [...] "salted three times and moistened with olive oil". Hard-boiled eggs were added, and either anchovies or canned tuna, [...] but not both. He incorporated raw vegetables such as cucumbers, purple artichokes, green peppers, fava beans, spring onions, black olives, basil and garlic, but no lettuce or vinegar. According to Rowley Leigh, Médecin believed that salade niçoise [...] "was {{a product of the}} sun and had to be vibrant with the crisp, sweet flavours of the vegetables of the Midi." [...] Médecin advocated presenting the dish as a composed salad, [...] commenting, [...] "As the various ingredients <b>that</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> salade niçoise are of bright and contrasting colours, they can be arranged most decoratively in the salad bowl." ...|$|E
