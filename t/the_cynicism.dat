This cinematological trend reflected much of <b>the</b> <b>cynicism</b> {{and the possibility}} of nuclear annihilation of the era. This new genre introduced innovations that were not available with the earlier noir films. The violence was also more potent than in earlier noir films.|$|E
5|$|When the Whitlam Government came {{to power}} in late 1972, the CMF was in a very poor state. The new {{government}} moved quickly to end conscription, and this caused the CMF's strength to fall by roughly 5,000 to 23,119 by June 1973. In 1973 a committee of inquiry into the CMF was announced, under the chairmanship of Dr. T.B Millar and the subsequent report developed from this inquiry became known as the Millar Report. Far from being a vehicle of the Regular Army to denigrate the CMF as some opponents predicted, the report did much to highlight many of the conceptual and structural problems that the CMF was afflicted by at the time, however, {{the way in which the}} government chose to implement the recommendations, and indeed the way in which some of them were allowed to lapse, ultimately served to at least partially justify some of <b>the</b> <b>cynicism</b> voiced in certain CMF circles about the report.|$|E

500|$|In February 1832 Balzac {{received}} an intriguing letter from Odessa—with no return address and signed simply [...] "L'Étrangère" [...] ("The Foreigner")—expressing sadness at <b>the</b> <b>cynicism</b> and atheism in La Peau de Chagrin and its negative portrayal of women. His {{response was to}} place a classified advertisement in the Gazette de France, hoping that his anonymous critic would see it. Thus began a fifteen-year correspondence between Balzac and [...] "the object of [...] sweetest dreams": Ewelina Hańska.|$|E
500|$|Balzac's {{literary}} mood {{evolved over}} time {{from one of}} despondency and chagrin to that of solidarity and courage—but not optimism. La Peau de Chagrin, among his earliest novels, is a pessimistic tale of confusion and destruction. But <b>the</b> <b>cynicism</b> declined as his [...] developed, and the characters of Illusions Perdues reveal sympathy {{for those who are}} pushed to one side by society. As part of the 19th-century evolution of the novel as a [...] "democratic literary form", Balzac wrote that [...] "les livres sont faits pour tout le monde" [...] ("books are written for everybody").|$|E

Author and former Mojo editor Mat Snow writes of the timing of the album's US release: [...] "he caught a public mood that craved an echo of 1960s idealism as America was gripped by <b>the</b> <b>cynicism</b> revealed in the Watergate hearings." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Artificial Energy" [...] is {{followed}} {{on the album}} by the poignant and nostalgic Goffin–King song [...] "Goin' Back". With its chiming 12-string Rickenbacker guitar and polished harmony singing, band biographer Johnny Rogan has noted that the song provides a {{sharp contrast to the}} negativity and violence of the opening track. The song's lyrics describe an attempt {{on the part of the}} singer to reject <b>the</b> <b>cynicism</b> that comes with being an adult in favor of the innocence of childhood. Thematically, the song recalled the title of the Byrds' previous album, Younger Than Yesterday, and the understated pedal steel guitar playing of Red Rhodes gives the track a subtle country flavor.|$|E
500|$|In 1969 Sellers starred {{opposite}} Ringo Starr in the Joseph McGrath-directed film The Magic Christian. Sellers portrayed Sir Guy Grand, {{an eccentric}} billionaire who plays elaborate practical jokes on people. The critic Irv Slifkin remarked {{that the film}} was a reflection of <b>the</b> <b>cynicism</b> of Peter Sellers, describing the film as a [...] "proto-Pythonesque adaption of Terry Southern's semi-free-form short novel", and [...] "one of the strangest films to be shown at a gala premiere for Britain's royal family". The film, a satire on human nature, was in general viewed negatively by critics. Roger Greenspun of The New York Times believed that the film was of variable quality and summarised it as a [...] "brutal satire".|$|E

Faust believes that her future animated shows aimed at girls {{will be easier to}} sell considering the male adult fandom of Friendship Is Magic, and that that type of programming is not as great a risk as is perceived. After Hasbro issued a cease and desist to the Fighting Is Magic project over the use of copyrighted and trademarked characters, Faust offered to provide the developers with original character arts to allow them to continue to develop the game without copyright issues.|$|E
500|$|Near {{the end of}} [...] "200", {{the celebrities}} seek {{assistance}} from singer and actress Barbra Streisand, who resembles a giant two-legged mechanical monster. This is a reference to Streisand's appearance in the first-season episode [...] "Mecha-Streisand", in which she transforms into a monster {{in the style of}} Mechagodzilla from the Godzilla franchise. The Mecha-Streisand featured in [...] "200" [...] is designed with more sophisticated computer imagery than the original, which was a simple cut-out style cartoon like the rest of South Park. Although Parker and Stone have maintained that most of the celebrities they mock in South Park are chosen at random, with no personal animosity behind it, Barbra Streisand {{is one of the few}} they actively and vehemently dislike. Streisand, in turn, has been critical of South Park and her portrayal in it, and has accused the show of adding [...] "to <b>the</b> <b>cynicism</b> and negativity in our culture, especially in children".|$|E
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>cynicism,</b> {{challenging}} {{of traditional}} beliefs, and political controversy of Hollywood films {{during this period}} mirrored the attitudes of many of their patrons. Also gone was the carefree and adventurous lifestyle of the 1920s. [...] "After two years the Jazz Age seems {{as far away as}} the days before the war", F. Scott Fitzgerald commented in 1931. In the sense noted by Fitzgerald, understanding the moral climate of the early 1930s is complex. Although films experienced an unprecedented level of freedom and dared to portray things that would be kept hidden for several decades, many in America looked upon the stock market crash as a product of the excesses of the previous decade. In looking back upon the 1920s, events were increasingly seen as occurring in prelude to the market crash. In Dance, Fools, Dance (1931), lurid party scenes featuring 1920s flappers are played to excess. Joan Crawford ultimately reforms her ways and is saved; less fortunate is William Bakewell, who continues on the careless path that leads to his ultimate self-destruction.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{a reader}} of 'spy novels' for diversion, as was {{common in the}} {{intelligence}} field, reportedly Helms did not like one well-known novel in particular. <b>The</b> <b>cynicism,</b> violence, betrayal, and despair in The Spy Who Came in from the Cold (1963) by John le Carré offended Helms. As a leader of professionals, Helms considered [...] "trust" [...] as essential to intelligence work. So strong was his negative reaction that Helms' son Dennis said he [...] "detested" [...] this novel. Yet twenty years later in his memoirs Helms included books by le Carré among [...] "the better spy novels".|$|E
2500|$|The rise {{of music}} that is totally without social {{commitment}} also increases the separation between composer and public, and represents still another form of departure from tradition. <b>The</b> <b>cynicism</b> with which this particular departure {{seems to have been}} made is perfectly symbolized in John Cage's account of a public lecture he had given: [...] "Later, during the question period, I gave one of six previously prepared answers regardless of the question asked. This was a reflection of my engagement in Zen." [...] While Mr. Cage's famous silent piece , or his Landscapes for a dozen radio receivers may be of little interest as music, they are of enormous importance historically as representing the complete abdication of the artist's power.|$|E

[...] He later {{said that it was}} this {{experience}} which prompted his notorious remarks in an interview the following year in Der Spiegel, in which he claimed that [...] "no opera worth mentioning had been composed since 1935", that [...] "a Beatles record is certainly cleverer (and shorter) than a Henze opera" [...] and that [...] "the most elegant" [...] solution to opera's moribund condition would be [...] "to blow the opera houses up".|$|E

On the contrary, they stem from his thinking about Islam and the West in the one and a half years since he became Pope. It was certainly not the intention of the Holy Father to undertake a comprehensive study of the jihad and of Muslim ideas on the subject, still less to offend the sensibilities of Muslim faithful. Quite the contrary, what emerges clearly from the Holy Father’s discourses is a warning, addressed to Western culture, to avoid 'the contempt for God and <b>the</b> <b>cynicism</b> that considers mockery of the sacred to be an exercise of freedom.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{majority}} of <b>the</b> <b>cynicism</b> and mockery as regards conventional lovers, however, comes from Launce and Speed, who serve as foils {{for the two}} protagonists, and [...] "supply a mundane view of the idealistic flights of fancy indulged in by Proteus and Valentine." [...] Several times in the play, after either Valentine or Proteus has made an eloquent speech about love, Shakespeare introduces either Launce or Speed (or both), whose more mundane concerns serve to undercut what has just been said, thus exposing Proteus and Valentine to mockery. For example, in Act 2, Scene 1, as Valentine and Silvia engage {{in a game of}} flirtation, hinting at their love for one another, Speed provides constant asides which serve to directly mock the couple; ...|$|E
