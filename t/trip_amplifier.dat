40|$|Conception of {{high-power}} reactor pumped {{laser system}} (RPLS) is discussed. Described {{is a system}} which consist of a thermal subcritical (in neutron physics aspect) laser module controlled with a neutron flux from reactor block (one or more fast burst periodic reactors could be placed inside a laser module) (see Fig. 1). The «master oscillator- two round <b>trip</b> <b>amplifier</b> » optical scheme principle is used [1]...|$|E
40|$|The Laboratory for Oceans is {{currently}} working on the development of compact laser diode array (LD) pumped Nd:YAG lasers for use in space-based altimetry and ranging. Laser diode-array pumping technology promises to increase the electrical to optical efficiency of solid state lasers by an order of magnitude with a lifetime increase of nearly three orders of magnitude relative to today's conventional flashlamp-pumped laser systems. The small size, efficiency, and ruggedness make LD-pumped solid state lasers ideal for space based applications. In an in-house RTOP effort, a novel multiple-pass LD-pumped Nd:YAG laser amplifier was designed and tested to increase the 100 microjoule output pulse energy of the Lightwave laser oscillator. Preliminary results have yielded a round <b>trip</b> <b>amplifier</b> gain of about 15 percent using 7 microjoule LD-pump energy. As a parallel activity, funding was recently obtained to investigate the possible use of custom made fiber optic arrays to obtain an efficient optical coupling mechanism between the emitting laser diode-arrays and the target solid state laser material. Fiber optic coupling arrays would allow for the easy manipulation of the spatial emitting pattern of the diode pump sources to match either an end or side pumping laser configuration...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{determines the}} optimum high-trip- level setting of m-out-of-n:G temperature- trip-amplifier systems,used for the {{protection}} of nuclear reactors against excess temperatures, which results in the maximum reliability. The bivariate normal distribution is used to simulate the fluctuation of the thermocouple signals and the uncertainties of the trip settings. The thermocouples and the <b>trip</b> <b>amplifiers</b> can fail in two modes of failure: fail-safe and fail-danger. It is shown that by properly selecting the trip levels of the amplifier units the reliability of the protection system is maximized. The optimum trip-level is calculated for various commonly used configurations using a computer algorithm...|$|R
50|$|The correct {{operation}} of an SIS requires {{a series of}} equipment to function properly. It must have sensors capable of detecting abnormal operating conditions, such as high flow, low level, or incorrect valve positioning. A logic solver is required to receive the sensor input signal(s), make appropriate decisions based {{on the nature of}} the signal(s), and change its outputs according to user-defined logic. The logic solver may use electrical, electronic or programmable electronic equipment, such as relays, <b>trip</b> <b>amplifiers,</b> or programmable logic controllers. Next, the change of the logic solver output(s) results in the final element(s) taking action on the process (e.g. closing a valve) to bring it to a safe state. Support systems, such as power, instrument air, and communications, are generally required for SIS operation. The support systems should be designed to provide the required integrity and reliability.|$|R
