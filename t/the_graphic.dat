The two dual concepts of girth and edge connectivity are unified in matroid theory by matroid girth: the girth of <b>the</b> <b>graphic</b> matroid of a planar graph {{is the same as the}} graph's girth, and the girth of the dual matroid (<b>the</b> <b>graphic</b> matroid of the dual graph) is the edge connectivity of the graph.|$|E

5|$|Many of the {{characters}} from <b>the</b> <b>graphic</b> novel underwent significant changes for the film. V is characterized in the film as a romantic freedom fighter who shows concern {{over the loss of}} innocent life. However, in <b>the</b> <b>graphic</b> novel, he is portrayed as ruthless, willing to kill anyone who gets in his way. Evey Hammond's transformation as V's protégée is also much more drastic in the novel than in the film. At the beginning of the film, she is already a confident woman with a hint of rebellion in her; in <b>the</b> <b>graphic</b> novel, she starts off as an insecure, desperate young woman forced into prostitution. V and Evey's relationship, though not as obvious in the book, ends in the film with pledges of love. In <b>the</b> <b>graphic</b> novel's finale, she not only carries out V's plans as she does in the film, but also clearly takes on V's identity. In the film, Inspector Finch sympathizes with V, but, in <b>the</b> <b>graphic</b> novel, he is determined to stop V and goes as far as taking LSD to enter into a criminal's state of mind. Gordon, a very minor character in both adaptations, is also drastically changed. In the novel, Gordon is a small-time criminal who takes Evey into his home after V abandons her on the street. The two share a brief romance before Gordon is killed by a Scottish gang. In the film, however, Gordon is a well-mannered colleague of Evey's, and is later revealed to be gay. He is arrested by fingermen for broadcasting a political parody on his TV program, and is later executed when a Quran is found in his possession.|$|E
