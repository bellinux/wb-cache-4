5|$|The website {{sometimes}} {{adopts a}} strongly critical stance against figures that it perceives as political or ideological opponents.

5|$|Another {{story of}} the poem's origin claimed that Helmer's funeral was held {{on the morning of}} May 2, after which McCrae wrote the poem in 20 minutes. A third claim, by Morrison, was that McCrae worked on the poem as time allowed between arrivals of wounded {{soldiers}} in need of medical attention. Regardless of its true origin, McCrae worked on the poem for months before considering it ready for publication. He submitted it to <b>The</b> <b>Spectator</b> in London but it was rejected. It was then sent to Punch, where it was published on December 8, 1915. It was published anonymously, but Punch attributed the poem to McCrae in its year-end index.|$|E
5|$|Beach Thomas's primary {{interest}} {{as an adult}} was in rural matters. He was conservative in his views, and feared that the post–Second World War socialist governments regarded the countryside only from an economic perspective. He was an advocate {{for the creation of}} national parks in England and Wales, and mourned the decline of traditional village society. He wrote extensively, particularly for The Observer newspaper and <b>The</b> <b>Spectator,</b> a conservative magazine. His book The English Landscape (1938) includes selections from his contributions to Country Life magazine.|$|E
60|$|At length, {{after many}} mazy evolutions, which afforded great {{pleasure}} to <b>the</b> <b>spectators,</b> <b>the</b> sound of a loud-voiced trumpet was heard, as if it blew for instant battle, or for victory won.

5|$|Ice {{was laid}} on the on 12 November 1992 and the arena was officially {{completed}} on 1 December.

After the Olympic arena was built, Storhamar Ishall was renovated, and <b>the</b> <b>spectator</b> capacity reduced {{through the construction of}} storage facilities and VIP areas. The Olympic Amphitheatre later installed Norway's first media cube in 2004.|$|E
5|$|In 1932 Waugh {{embarked}} on an extended voyage to South America. His decision to absent himself {{may have been a}} reaction to his increasingly complicated emotional life; while his passion for Teresa Jungman remained unrequited, he was involved in various unsatisfactory casual sexual liaisons, and was himself being pursued by the much older Hazel Lavery. The choice of South America was probably influenced by Peter Fleming, the literary editor of <b>The</b> <b>Spectator.</b> Fleming had recently returned from an expedition to Brazil seeking traces of Colonel Percy Fawcett who, in 1925, had disappeared in Brazil while searching for a fabled lost city.|$|E

5|$|Levin {{reviewed}} {{television for}} the Manchester Guardian {{and wrote a}} weekly political column in <b>The</b> <b>Spectator</b> noted for its irreverence and influence on modern parliamentary sketches. During the 1960s he wrote five columns {{a week for the}} Daily Mail on any subject that he chose. After a disagreement with the proprietor of the paper over attempted censorship of his column in 1970, Levin moved to The Times where, with one break of just over a year in 1981–82, he remained as resident columnist until his retirement, covering a wide range of topics, both serious and comic.|$|E
5|$|Mortimer {{appeared}} at the Olympic Heroes Parade in Toronto. For the event, Paralympic athletes were given rooms at a hotel {{on the outskirts of}} Toronto while Olympic athletes were housed downtown and received gifts; at a dinner, the Paralympians were relegated to a different dining room. A Canadian Paralympic Committee spokesperson told <b>The</b> <b>Spectator</b> that the committee scrambled during the Paralympics to have their athletes included, and with their limited funding they could not afford the perks received by the Olympic athletes.|$|E
5|$|These games {{raised the}} profile of {{paraplegic}} (spinal cord and polio) athletes in Australia, particularly Western Australia. <b>The</b> <b>spectator</b> attendance amazed leading officials such as Dr Ludwig Guttmann, {{the founder of the}} Stoke Mandeville Games. He commented that the attendance was the best he had seen at any paraplegic sports event in the world. The Games highlighted the versatility of the athletes with many winning medals in different sports. It was noted that generally the standard of performance was below that of the Stoke Mandeville Games; however there were several outstanding performers including Vic Renalson, Bill Mather-Brown, Lorraine Dodd, M. Bazeley, Lynne Gilchrist and R. Scott who broke records in their events. A film of the Games was made.|$|E
