5|$|With the {{feedback}} received from players {{after the release}} of Nightmare, Brett Clements and Phillip Tanner started work on the major update to the series. <b>They</b> <b>struck</b> a deal with J. W. Spear & Sons, to use publishing experience and market research with Nightmare to help create the new game. The deal allowed J. W. Spear & Sons to have input into how the game was developed, which was not the case with Nightmare. Village Roadshow was also involved with the game's development and with its release in the United States. The development ended six years after it started, with about six million dollars invested {{in the development of the}} game.|$|E
5|$|In April 1904, while {{operating}} with the Home Fleet off the Scilly Isles, Royal Oak {{and her sister}} ship Revenge had their bottoms lightly damaged when <b>they</b> <b>struck</b> a sunken wreck. On 9 May 1904, Royal Oak became flagship of the Home Fleet's second-in-command, relieving her sister Empress of India, and took part in annual maneuvers in July and August. On 7 March 1905, Royal Oak paid off at Portsmouth into the Chatham Reserve, and her crew transferred to the battleship Caesar. The following day the ship recommissioned with a skeleton crew for service with the Sheerness-Chatham Division of the newly formed Fleet in Commission in Reserve at Home. While she was under refit at Chatham, an explosion in her small-arms magazine on 11 May killed one workman and injured three others. In July, Royal Oak participated in Reserve Fleet manoeuvres. Her crew was then transferred to the battleship Ocean, and Royal Oak recommissioned with a new nucleus crew {{to serve as an}} emergency reserve ship at Chatham.|$|E
5|$|In spring 829, Michael II sent a new fleet to Sicily under Theodotus, who {{was well}} acquainted with the island, having already served as its strategos in the past. After landing, Theodotus marched his army to Enna, where the Arabs were {{continuing}} the siege. He was defeated in the subsequent battle, but {{was able to find}} refuge in the fortress with most of his men. The Muslims now became so confident of victory that <b>they</b> <b>struck</b> their first coins on the island, in the name of Ziyadat Allah and Muhammad ibn Abu'l-Jawari, who however died a short while after and was replaced by Zubayr ibn Gawth. Shortly after that, Theodotus managed to reverse the situation: he led a sally that routed a Muslim raiding party and then defeated the main Muslim army on the next day, killing 1,000 men and pursuing the rest up to the Muslims' fortified encampment, which he placed under siege. The Muslims tried to break out in a night sortie, but Theodotus was expecting such a move and routed them in an ambush.|$|E

5|$|Massachusetts shelled Ponape Island on 1 May, {{her last}} mission before sailing to Puget Sound to {{overhaul}} and reline her gun barrels, now well-worn. On 1 August, she left Pearl Harbor to resume {{operations in the}} Pacific war zone. She departed the Marshall Islands on 6 October, sailing to support the landings in Leyte Gulf. In an effort to block Japanese air attacks in the Leyte conflict, she participated in a fleet strike against Okinawa on 10 October. From 12–14 October she screened Allied forces while <b>they</b> <b>struck</b> Formosa. While part of Task Group 38.3 (TG 38.3) she {{took part in the}} Battle for Leyte Gulf from 22–27 October, during which planes from her group sank four Japanese carriers off Cape Engaño. After having stopped briefly at Ulithi, Massachusetts returned to the Philippines as part of TF 38 which struck Manila on 14 December.|$|E
5|$|Walker {{resisted}} Kenney's {{proposals that}} the bombers conduct attacks from low level using bombs armed with instantaneous fuses. Kenney ordered Walker {{to try the}} fuses {{for a couple of}} months, so that data could be gained about their effectiveness; a few weeks later Kenney discovered that Walker had discontinued their use. In November, Kenney arranged for a demonstration attack on the SS Pruth, a ship that had sunk off Port Moresby in 1924 and was often used for target practice. After the attack Walker and Kenney took a boat out to the wreck to inspect the damage. As expected, none of the four bombs dropped had hit the stationary wreck, but the instantaneous fuses had detonated the bombs when <b>they</b> <b>struck</b> the water, so bomb fragments had torn holes in the sides of the ship. Walker reluctantly conceded the point. A few weeks later, Walker was shot down leading a daylight raid over Rabaul, an attack that Kenney had ordered to be conducted at night.|$|E
5|$|With {{his main}} and mizzen masts {{collapsed}} and escape impossible, Leissègues turned his ship towards the shore at 11:30, outdistancing the {{fire from the}} drifting Northumberland and leaving Superb behind, Duckworth reluctant to risk his ship in the shallow coastal shoals. Canopus maintained the pressure, pursuing the French flagship until it was clear at 11:40 that Impérial was hard aground on a coral reef, {{less than a mile}} from the beach. Diomède, under attack by Atlas and the recently returned Spencer, followed Impérial ashore. As <b>they</b> <b>struck</b> the reef, both French ships lost their remaining masts and suffered severe damage to their hulls. Their crews then gathered on deck and made preparations to abandon ship as the British squadron pulled back out of range of fire from the shore. During the engagement the French frigates and corvette had all slipped between the battling squadrons and the shoreline and escaped to the westwards. The British frigates were too preoccupied with boarding and towing prizes to initiate a chase.|$|E

5|$|After {{the death}} of Ibn Tulun's son Khumarawayh in 896, the Tulunid state quickly began {{crumbling}} from within, and failed to put up any serious resistance when the Abbasids moved to re-establish direct control over Syria and Egypt in 905. Tughj defected to the invading Abbasids under Muhammad ibn Sulayman al-Katib, and was named governor of Aleppo in return; Muhammad al-Katib himself fell victim to court intrigues soon after, and Tughj along with his sons Muhammad and Ubayd Allah were imprisoned in Baghdad. Tughj died in prison in 906, and the brothers were freed shortly after. The sons of Tughj participated in the palace coup that tried to depose the new caliph, al-Muqtadir (reigned 908–932), in favour of the older Ibn al-Mu'tazz in December 908. Although the attempt failed, Muhammad ibn Tughj and his brother were able to avenge themselves for their imprisonment on the vizier al-Abbas ibn al-Hasan al-Jarjara'i, whom <b>they</b> <b>struck</b> down {{with the aid of}} Husayn ibn Hamdan. After the coup's failure, the three fled: Ibn Hamdan returned to his native Upper Mesopotamia and Ubayd Allah fled east to Yusuf ibn Abi'l-Saj, while Muhammad fled to Syria.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the {{following}} day, the US forces attempted to retake the lost positions {{in order to}} restore the integrity of their line. Fighting raged throughout the day into the early afternoon, by which time they had successfully recaptured several of the pillboxes, supported by mortar fire. In the evening, the Americans used indirect fire and searchlights to harass the Japanese, but by early morning, just before dawn, <b>they</b> <b>struck</b> again, and captured another pillbox. As morning progressed, the US commander requested tank support and four tanks from the 754th Tank Battalion were dispatched. In the meantime, minor counterattacks succeeded in regaining part of the line; by mid-morning the tanks joined the fighting and several more positions were retaken by the US troops in several attacks before and after lunch. Having run out of ammunition and running low on fuel, {{the first group of}} tanks was withdrawn and replaced with a fresh platoon of tanks with which the attack was resumed in the mid-afternoon. Fighting continued throughout the day until 7:30pm when the Japanese retired from the position for the evening, having been forced to give up all of their earlier gains by a determined American counterattack.|$|E
25|$|In 1606, a Dutch ship {{stopped on}} the shores of the Karimanal Village, north of the mouth of the lake {{requesting}} water.

50|$|Keyboard {{instruments}} {{do not fit}} {{easily into}} this scheme. For example, the piano has strings, but <b>they</b> are <b>struck</b> by hammers, {{so it is not}} clear whether it should be classified as a string instrument or a percussion instrument. For this reason, keyboard instruments are often regarded as inhabiting a category of their own, including all instruments played by a keyboard, whether <b>they</b> have <b>struck</b> strings (like the piano), plucked strings (like the harpsichord) or no strings at all (like the celesta).|$|R
25|$|Getting to the merits, Bright {{argued that}} the race-neutral reasons for the strikes were contradicted by the prosecution's actions and the {{documents}} Foster obtained.

25|$|On March 22, 1622, the Powhatan killed about 400 colonists in the Indian Massacre of 1622.

25|$|Before <b>they</b> <b>struck,</b> Arima, Hasegawa, and Murayama jointly sent {{a message}} to the Jesuits {{justifying}} their impending attack on the carrack with the fact that Pessoa was trying to escape Japanese justice.

The Jesuits responded that it was not in Portuguese culture to surrender their captains.|$|E

25|$|Historians do {{not believe}} that Indian {{casualties}} approached the higher estimates. The Plains Indians rarely mounted a direct charge at a foe capable of defense. Rather, <b>they</b> <b>struck</b> at the rear and flanks of an opponent, using mounted mobility to probe for weaknesses and attempt to cause disorganization and panic, backing off if they encountered a stout defense, and closing in for the kill when they could do so with little risk of heavy casualties.|$|E
