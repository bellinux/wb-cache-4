5|$|The sudden boom of {{the silk}} {{industry}} in the Italian state of Lucca, starting in the 11th and 12th centuries was due to much Sicilian, Jewish, and Greek settlement, alongside many other immigrants from neighbouring cities in southern Italy. With the loss of many Italian trading posts in the Orient, the import of Chinese styles drastically declined. Gaining momentum, {{in order to satisfy}} <b>the</b> <b>rich</b> <b>and</b> <b>powerful</b> bourgeoisie's demands for luxury fabrics, the cities of Lucca, Genoa, Venice and Florence were soon exporting silk to all of Europe. In 1472 there were 84 workshops and at least 7000 craftsmen in Florence alone.|$|E
5|$|In the Life of Probus, {{the author}} 'Flavius Vopiscus of Syracuse' {{states that the}} Emperor's {{descendants}} (posteri) fled from Rome and settled near Verona. There a statue of Probus was struck by lightning, a portent according to soothsayers 'that future generations of the family would rise to such distinction in the senate they all would hold the highest posts', though Vopiscus (supposedly writing under Constantine) says this prophecy has not yet come to pass. This {{is one of the}} strongest indications of the History's late 4th-century date, as {{it seems to be a}} fairly transparent allusion to <b>the</b> <b>rich</b> <b>and</b> <b>powerful</b> senator Sextus Claudius Petronius Probus (consul in 371) whose two sons held the consulship together in 395. Petronius Probus was born in Verona.|$|E
5|$|Richard's {{government}} was formed around his uncles, most prominently <b>the</b> <b>rich</b> <b>and</b> <b>powerful</b> John of Gaunt, {{and many of}} his grandfather's former senior officials. They faced the challenge of financially sustaining the war in France. Taxes in the 14th century were raised on an ad hoc basis through Parliament, then comprising the Lords, the titled aristocracy and clergy; and the Commons, the representatives of the knights, merchants and senior gentry from across England. These taxes were typically imposed on a household's movable possessions, such as their goods or stock. The raising of these taxes affected the members of the Commons much more than the Lords. To complicate matters, the official statistics used to administer the taxes pre-dated the Black Death and, since the size and wealth of local communities had changed greatly since the plague, effective collection had become increasingly difficult.|$|E

5|$|By 1875, France {{was enjoying}} {{improved}} political stability and a recovering postwar economy. Growing {{interest in the}} upcoming Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia led Laboulaye to decide {{it was time to}} seek public support. In September 1875, he announced the project and the formation of the Franco-American Union as its fundraising arm. With the announcement, the statue was given a name, Liberty Enlightening the World. The French would finance the statue; Americans would be expected to pay for the pedestal. The announcement provoked a generally favorable reaction in France, though many Frenchmen resented the United States for not coming to their aid during the war with Prussia. French monarchists opposed the statue, {{if for no other reason}} than it was proposed by the liberal Laboulaye, who had recently been elected a senator for life. Laboulaye arranged events designed to appeal to <b>the</b> <b>rich</b> <b>and</b> <b>powerful,</b> including a special performance at the Paris Opera on April 25, 1876, that featured a new cantata by composer Charles Gounod. The piece was titled La Liberté éclairant le monde, the French version of the statue's announced name.|$|E
5|$|The economic, {{social and}} {{cultural}} dislocation of ordinary people, the economic hardship of an economy in transition, and the pressures of meteorological disasters all contributed to growing problems in Central Europe. The failure {{of most of the}} governments to deal with the food crisis of the mid-1840s, caused by the potato blight (related to the Great Irish Famine) and several seasons of bad weather, encouraged many to think that <b>the</b> <b>rich</b> <b>and</b> <b>powerful</b> had no interest in their problems. Those in authority were concerned about the growing unrest, political and social agitation among the working classes, and the disaffection of the intelligentsia. No amount of censorship, fines, imprisonment, or banishment, it seemed, could stem the criticism. Furthermore, it was becoming increasingly clear that both Austria and Prussia wanted to be the leaders in any resulting unification; each would inhibit the drive of the other to achieve unification.|$|E

25|$|Mural {{painting}} was also common in Italy, where the method employed was generally fresco, painting on freshly laid, slightly damp plaster.

25|$|The Democratic party saw the Preparedness {{movement}} as a threat. Roosevelt, Root and Wood were prospective Republican presidential candidates. More subtly, the Democrats were rooted in localism that appreciated the National Guard, and the voters were hostile to <b>the</b> <b>rich</b> <b>and</b> <b>powerful</b> in the first place. Working with the Democrats who controlled Congress, Wilson was able to sidetrack the Preparedness forces. Army and Navy leaders were forced to testify before Congress {{to the effect that}} the nation's military was in excellent shape.|$|E

25|$|The huge {{losses on}} the battlefields were {{not limited to}} men. The army quickly ran short of rifles and {{ammunition}} (as well as uniforms and food), and, by mid-1915, men were {{being sent to the}} front bearing no arms. It was hoped that they could equip themselves with the arms that they recovered from fallen soldiers, of both sides, on the battlefields. The soldiers did not feel that they were being treated as human beings, or even as valuable soldiers, but rather as raw materials to be squandered for the purposes of <b>the</b> <b>rich</b> <b>and</b> <b>powerful.</b>|$|E
25|$|Social Darwinism {{suggested}} {{that the success of}} these different ethnic groups in world affairs, and social classes in a society, were the result of evolutionary struggle in which the group or class more fit to succeed did so; i.e., the ability of an ethnic group to dominate other ethnic groups, or the chance to succeed or rise to the top of society was determined by genetic superiority. In more modern times it is typically seen as dubious and unscientific for its apparent use of Darwin's ideas to justify the position of <b>the</b> <b>rich</b> <b>and</b> <b>powerful,</b> or dominant ethnic groups.|$|E
25|$|Sociologists Dennis Gilbert, William Thompson, Joseph Hickey, and James Henslin have {{proposed}} class systems with six distinct social classes. These class models feature an upper or capitalist class consisting of <b>the</b> <b>rich</b> <b>and</b> <b>powerful,</b> an {{upper middle class}} consisting of highly educated and affluent professionals, a middle class consisting of college-educated individuals employed in white-collar industries, a lower middle class composed of semi-professionals with typically some college education, a working class constituted by clerical and blue collar workers whose work is highly routinized, and a lower class divided between the working poor and the unemployed underclass.|$|E

25|$|Hearst was on {{the left}} wing of the Progressive Movement, {{speaking}} on behalf of the working class (who bought his papers) and denouncing <b>the</b> <b>rich</b> <b>and</b> <b>powerful</b> (who disdained his editorials). With the support of Tammany Hall (the regular Democratic organization in Manhattan), he was elected to Congress in 1902 and 1904. He ran for the Democratic nomination for president in 1904, losing to a conservative New York judge, Alton B. Parker. Breaking with Tammany in 1907, Hearst ran for mayor of New York City under a third party of his own creation, the Municipal Ownership League). Tammany Hall exerted its utmost to defeat him.|$|E
25|$|Maldonado {{committed}} various {{criminal acts}} {{which made him}} an outlaw {{in the eyes of}} the Spanish authorities. According to La Democracia a local political newspaper at the time, Maldonado was accused of robbery twice and sent to prison in 1887 and again in 1889. From 1890 to 1891, he was briefly incarcerated for aggravated assault. Maldonado, who operated in the areas of Juana Díaz and Ponce, continued his assault and robbing spree. He was captured and sent to jail once more in 1896. Even though his acts were considered criminal by the authorities, he gained the admiration of the common Jibaro (humble farmer) who viewed his acts as being against <b>the</b> <b>rich</b> <b>and</b> <b>powerful,</b> and against the Spanish Crown which they considered oppressive.|$|E
25|$|The lawful age of {{marriage}} was fifteen {{for girls and}} eighteen for boys, the respective ages at which fosterage ended. Upon marriage, {{the families of the}} bride and bridegroom were expected to contribute to the match. It was custom for the bridegroom and his family to pay a coibche (modern spelling: coibhche) and the bride was allowed a share of it. If the marriage ended owing to a fault of the husband then the coibche was kept by the wife and her family, but if the fault lay with the wife then the coibche was to be returned. It was custom for the bride to receive a spréid (modern spelling: spréidh) from her family (or foster family) upon marriage. This was to be returned if the marriage ended through divorce or the death of the husband. Later, the spréid seems to have been converted into a dowry. Women could seek divorce/separation as easily as men could and, when obtained on her behalf, she kept all the property she had brought her husband during their marriage. Trial marriages seem to have been popular among <b>the</b> <b>rich</b> <b>and</b> <b>powerful,</b> and thus {{it has been argued that}} cohabitation before marriage must have been acceptable. It also seems that the wife of a chieftain was entitled to some share of the chief's authority over his territory. This led to some Gaelic Irish wives wielding a great deal of political power.|$|E

500|$|Reaction to Kantakouzenos' {{proclamation}} {{caused a}} rift in Byzantine society, with <b>the</b> <b>rich</b> <b>and</b> <b>powerful</b> land-holding magnates (traditionally called the dynatoi, the [...] "powerful ones") who dominated the countryside quickly rallying to support him, while the ordinary population, often living in abject conditions and suffering under oppressive taxation, supported the Empress-dowager and the Patriarch. Apokaukos was especially quick to capitalize upon this division and foment popular dislike for the aristocracy, by widely publicizing the immense wealth confiscated from Kantakouzenos' and his supporters' houses and estates. In {{the words of}} Donald Nicol, [...] "it was against him [...] and everything that he stood for as a millionaire and landowning aristocrat that the people rose up. 'Kantakouzenism' became their war cry, the slogan of their discontent".|$|E

Over the years the tone in his columns softened somewhat and they often consisted of his reminisces of [...] "Old Seattle." [...] In November 2000, when his union, The Newspaper Guild, went on strike against The Seattle Times, Watson, then in his eighties, made regular, daily appearances on the picket lines. During the strike he wrote for the Seattle Union Record, the strike paper of the Pacific Northwest Newspaper Guild.|$|E
500|$|By {{the late}} 1880s, public {{attention}} to the fighting between Cope and Marsh faded, drawn to international stories rather than the [...] "Wild West". Thanks to John Wesley Powell, head of the U.S. Geological Survey, and Marsh's contacts with <b>the</b> <b>rich</b> <b>and</b> <b>powerful</b> in Washington, Marsh was placed {{at the head of}} the consolidated government survey and was happy to be out of the sensationalist spotlight. Cope was much less well-off, having spent most of his money purchasing The American Naturalist, and had a hard time finding employment thanks to Marsh's allies in higher education and his own temperament. Cope began investing in gold and silver prospects in the West, and braved malarial mosquitos and harsh weather to search for fossils himself. Due to setbacks in mining and a lack of support from the federal government, Cope's financial situation steadily deteriorated, to the point that his fossil collection was his only significant asset. Marsh, meanwhile, alienated even his loyal assistants, including Williston, with his refusal to share his conclusions drawn from their findings, and his continually lax and infrequent payment schedule.|$|E
