25|$|Sir Adventurous gratefully accepts {{these two}} gifts, Organate {{declares}} {{that she will}} wait for fifteen years {{for him to come}} for her. Sir Adventurous replies that he will have <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>things</b> go. So he returns to Artois, reverts to his old name and presents to the earl, who is even less pleased than before to see him, the head of the boar {{and the head of the}} giant.|$|E
500|$|Disagreements between Steve Jobs and then-Disney {{chairman}} and CEO Michael Eisner made the negotiations {{more difficult than}} they otherwise might have been. They broke down completely in mid-2004, with Disney forming Circle 7 Animation and Jobs declaring that Pixar was actively seeking partners other than Disney. Despite this announcement, Pixar did not enter negotiations with other distributors, although a Warner Bros. spokesperson told CNN, [...] "We {{would love to be}} in business with Pixar. They are a great company." [...] After a lengthy hiatus, negotiations between the two companies resumed following the departure of Eisner from Disney in September 2005. In preparation for potential fallout between Pixar and Disney, Jobs announced in late 2004 that Pixar would no longer release movies at the Disney-dictated November time frame, but during the more lucrative early summer months. This would also allow Pixar to release DVDs for their major releases during the Christmas shopping season. An added benefit of delaying Cars from November 4, 2005, to June 9, 2006, was to extend the time frame remaining on the Pixar-Disney contract, <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>things</b> would play out between the two companies.|$|E
2500|$|Van Lente stated, [...] "What's neat {{about the}} MCU, {{just like in}} the comics' universe, is the {{interconnections}} between various movies, particularly Iron Man 2 and Thor. You'll start to see those coming out in First Vengeance." [...] On the differences between the MCU and original versions of the characters, Van Lente noted that when Joe Simon and Jack Kirby originally created Captain America, they [...] "didn't have 20/20 hindsight <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>things</b> would fit together with the Marvel characters to follow. With the MCU, we're able to make those connections and heighten all of the characters' weight." ...|$|E

2500|$|Dan Patch {{made his}} next start on August 16 at the Brighton Beach {{racetrack}} in New York City, {{known as a}} gambling hotbed. Dan Patch was the heavy favorite to win the race, but his odds to win the first heat drifted up from 3/5 to 5/4, attracting a [...] "mad scramble" [...] from bettors looking {{to cash in on}} the generous odds. The start of the first heat was delayed by over an hour due to an equipment malfunction. When the race finally began, Dan Patch went to the early lead but was then eased back. In the homestretch, he was given [...] "modest" [...] encouragement but failed to close enough ground, finishing fourth. Bettors were incensed, believing McHenry did not drive to win, possibly after having tipped the bookmakers given the way the odds changed before the race. The time for the heat was 2:09, two seconds slower than Dan Patch's best time to date. McHenry stated that he had held back because he had heard that the winner was fast and he wanted <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>things</b> sorted out. Some reports say the judges paid no attention to the [...] "improbable" [...] result. However, the Boston Globe reported that the judges were [...] "very displeased" [...] and others reported on a heated meeting of the officials and a near riot by the fans.|$|E
2500|$|On 26 April 1937 when Orwell and his ILP comrades had {{returned}} to Barcelona on their leave they had been shocked <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>things</b> had changed. The revolutionary atmosphere of four months earlier had all but evaporated, and old class divisions been reasserted. Similarly, as {{he headed for the}} French border on the train to Port Bou, Orwell noticed another symptom of the change since his arrival—the train on which classes had been abolished now had both first-class compartments and a dining car. Bowker reports that [...] "Orwell mused that coming into Spain the previous year, bourgeois-looking people would be turned back at the border by Anarchist guards; now looking bourgeois gave one easy passage." [...] A simple hostility to Stalinist Communism became a [...] "deep-dyed loathing of it." [...] Animal Farm, [...] "his scintillating 1944 satire on Stalinism" [...] would be part of his response to the Spanish betrayal. [...] "He had learned a hard lesson, especially about the new political Europe. Totalitarianism, the new creed of 'the streamlined men' of Fascism and Communism, was a new manifestation of Orwell's old Catholic enemy, the doctrine of Absolutism ... the ghost of Torquemada had arisen, imprisonment without trial, confessions extracted under torture with summary executions to follow." [...] "The essential fact about a totalitarian regime is that it has no laws. People are not punished for specific offences, but because they are considered to be politically or intellectually undesirable. What they have done or not done is irrelevant." ...|$|E
2500|$|John Spedding (1685-1758) {{was first}} {{employed}} by Lowther's father, apparently {{to assist with}} the accounts. In his will Sir John bequeathed two years' salary (£20) to Spedding, and commended him to James. Spedding's adverse reports on the accounts of the colliery manager (John Gale, relative of the Speddings) led to Gale's dismissal (1707) and the discovery of embezzlement by him. John became colliery manager in his stead. [...] It had been intended that John's younger brother, Carlisle Spedding, should go to sea with one of Gale's sons, but this now fell through, and Carlisle was instead employed as a subordinate to his brother. [...] (It is said that Carlisle was sent to Tyneside to work as a hewer (under an assumed name) <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>things</b> were done there, his true identity only being revealed by his getting expensive medical treatment after being hurt in an explosion. However the story first appeared in print a generation after Carlisle Spedding's death, and one modern writer doubts it, finding no evidence for it in the Lowther accounts, and seeing no reason for subterfuge since Tyneside and Cumberland sold their coal into different markets.) John was promoted to steward (in conjunction with Richard Gilpin 1722-30: on his own after 1730); he also entered into business on his own account, backed by Lowther's money and uncertainty as to when he was acting for himself, and when to further some scheme of his employer's was helpful to both parties. [...] Carlisle's innovations in the Lowther mines at Whitehaven earned him a national reputation as a mining engineer; he succeeded his brother as colliery manager in 1730.|$|E

60|$|Then, {{while she}} was being dressed, Effie told her dream, and Nursey thought it very wonderful; but mamma smiled <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> curiously <b>things</b> the child had thought, read, heard, and seen through the day were mixed up in her sleep.|$|R
60|$|I {{was so busy}} {{looking after}} Charlie, {{flapping}} the towel and working on him with the oxygen, that, if you'll believe me, it wasn't for quite a time that I thought of glancing around <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> the <b>thing</b> had struck Izzy Baermann.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. McWilliams sped to {{the nursery}} <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>things</b> were going on there. She was {{back in a moment}} with a new dread. She said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You bet. I {{told you}} you'd like 'em. Squarest people on earth. Uh, Carrie----Would {{you mind if}} I sneaked down to the office for an hour, just <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>things</b> are?" ...|$|E
60|$|The colored fellows didn't like it much, for {{it seemed}} like taking their {{business}} away from them; but they couldn't help it, and so they just sat and waited <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>things</b> would turn out.|$|E
60|$|She {{took her}} {{responsibilities}} lightly. When she spilled her tea on the pillow, she rubbed it carelessly with a handkerchief, {{and turned over}} the pillow. He would have felt guilty. She did not. And it pleased him. It pleased him very much <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> these <b>things</b> did not matter to her.|$|R
6000|$|... "The attempt here," [...] said Boffin severely, [...] "is to demoralise {{the rulers}} of the people. I am glad to have come once <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> the <b>thing</b> is done; but as an {{independent}} member of the House of Commons I should {{not wish to be}} known to frequent the saloon of the Duchess." [...] Then Mr. Boffin took away Mrs. Boffin, much to that lady's regret.|$|R
6000|$|... "Can {{we go to}} it?" [...] cried Richard. He had not {{yet seen}} a {{conflagration}} in the city, and was anxious <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> such a <b>thing</b> would be handled. Frank looked at his watch.|$|R
60|$|As soon as I could, {{after reading}} Alice's letter, I {{went down to}} Eberwich <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>things</b> were. Memories of the old days came over me again till my heart hungered for its old people.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{has been}} an effort to me to come," [...] Stephen admitted. [...] "But I had it in my mind, John, that we parted bad friends. I have come <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>things</b> are with you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, my dear; {{of course}} I don't. And I never did after he drank tea here that night; only Mr. Comfort {{told me it}} wouldn't be safe not <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>things</b> went a little before you,--you understand, dearest?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{would start}} 'most anybody {{up to take}} a dose like that; {{but of course it}} won't happen now we've got the lawyer. I tell you he'll be s'prised <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> we've fixed <b>things,</b> won't he?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Fan was right. Trix only waited <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> bad <b>things</b> really were, {{or rather}} her mother did. She 's as cool, hard, and worldly minded an old soul as I ever saw, and Trix {{is bound to}} obey. She gets round it very neatly in her note, 'I won't be a burden,' 'will {{sacrifice}} her hopes,' 'and always remain my warm friend,' but the truth is, Tom Shaw rich was worth making much of, but Tom Shaw poor is in the way, and may go to the devil {{as fast as he}} likes." ...|$|R
500|$|I {{like being}} home, having my routines, looking after my garden {{and playing with}} my dog, but I also love playing. I love {{being able to do}} both ...

60|$|Stanley's daily {{journeys}} {{were not}} likely to be long ones, as he had instructions to stop at all villages; and <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>things</b> were going on, and whether the people had any complaints to make of oppression and exaction by their local authorities.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, we may all be mistaken, and he {{may only}} be a brave young fellow of good ancestry; so we will think no more of it, at present, and we will wait <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>things</b> turn out, before showing any signs of our suspicions." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just so! There's {{also the}} whole estimable family, {{who have made}} up their minds I'm to go into Parliament whether I'm willing or not.

6000|$|... "Of {{course it}} took some time to bring her around all right, for I'm not a very good hand at such things, and Sonny is too young to be of much use in time of sickness, so I suppose the fight was ended before we had matters {{straightened}} out at home; but I wanted to sneak around through the bushes <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> the <b>thing</b> wound up, and I'd have done it, too, if Sonny's mother hadn't caught me by the ear, declaring that she'd suffered enough for one night, and I must stay with her and the baby.|$|R

5000|$|In October 2016, Newman {{released}} the song [...] "Putin". The Washington Post wrote: [...] "inspired by the Russian leader's penchant for bare-chested photo ops and a geopolitical approach that's somewhat short of soft and cuddly, Newman has crafted {{a song that}} tells Putin's story from multiple perspectives." [...] Newman explained that the song was from a new album that would be released in 2017, but he was putting out this song early because [...] "I think that people will lose interest after this surfeit of political talk and attention after the election....

Just think of it! Getting a fellow to help you who makes a two-days' journey of it from the pond to the big oak!
