5|$|In August 1874, Carpenter became {{involved}} in fighting at Anadarko Reservation, Wichita, Indian Territory. This fighting is considered {{the first of many}} clashes during the Red River War (1874–75). Carpenter, with Troops H & I was sent to support Fort Sill and by using aggressive patrols engaged several Kiowa and Comanche raiding parties. The relatively peaceful Wichita Indians on the reservation were <b>targets</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hostile Indians because of their increasing positive status under pacification.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with four}} other {{scientists}} and various military personnel, von Neumann {{was included in the}} target selection committee responsible for choosing the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki as the first <b>targets</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> atomic bomb. Von Neumann oversaw computations related to the expected size of the bomb blasts, estimated death tolls, and the distance above the ground at which the bombs should be detonated for optimum shock wave propagation and thus maximum effect. The cultural capital Kyoto, which had been spared the bombing inflicted upon militarily significant cities, was von Neumann's first choice, a selection seconded by Manhattan Project leader General Leslie Groves. However, this target was dismissed by Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson.|$|E

5|$|In 1830, President Andrew Jackson {{had signed}} the Indian Removal Act, which {{authorized}} {{the government to}} remove any Indian nations east of the Mississippi River across to the western side and offer land in exchange. As northern Wisconsin was not then under pressure for development by white settlers, as occurred in the Southeast, the Ojibwa were not among the first <b>targets</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> act. They watched closely as the government used the territorial claims defined by tribes in 1825 to force numerous tribes in Indiana, southern Michigan and southern Wisconsin to move west to Kansas, Iowa, Minnesota, and Indian Territory, present-day Oklahoma. These included the Odawa and Potawatomi, two Anishinaabe tribes closely related to and allied with the Ojibwa.|$|E
5|$|In the 2010 {{elections}} to the Crimean parliament, the Party of Regions received the largest share of votes, whilst the second-placed Communist Party of Ukraine received {{a much smaller}} share. Both of these political parties would later be <b>targets</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Euromaidan movement. Former president of Crimea Yuriy Olexandrovich Meshkov called for a referendum on restoring the 1992 Constitution of Crimea in July 2011. As a consequence of this, a local court in Crimea deported Meshkov from Ukraine for five years.|$|E

During its operations, the 25th Infantry killed 1,017 PAVN and NLF troops while losing 119 of its own men killed.|$|E

5|$|The Cold War {{led to the}} {{expansion}} of national defense government programs housed in offices in Northern Virginia near Washington, D.C., and correlative population growth. The Central Intelligence Agency in Langley was involved in various Cold War events, including as the target of Soviet espionage activities. Also among the federal developments was the Pentagon, built during World War II as the headquarters for the Department of Defense. It was one of the <b>targets</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> September 11 attacks; 189 people died at the site when a jet passenger plane was crashed into the building.|$|E
5|$|The initial <b>targets</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{operation}} {{were the}} personal possessions and documents of Jacobo Árbenz {{and those of}} Carlos Enrique Díaz (who had been chief {{of the armed forces}} under Árbenz, and briefly his successor as president), as well as the headquarters of the Partido Guatemalteco del Trabajo (PGT), and the offices of trade unions, known front organizations, and police agencies. The results of the initial searches were disappointing for the CIA; many of the offices had already been plundered both by the Guatemalan army and by other looters. The CIA were particularly interested in finding documents that mentioned the Árbenz's government's purchase of weapons from Czechoslovakia, but they were unsuccessful. They were also unsuccessful in finding any evidence that the Soviet Union had controlled the communist movement in Guatemala.|$|E

5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1536, the north of England was convulsed {{in a series of}} uprisings collectively known as the Pilgrimage of Grace, the most serious {{opposition}} to Henry's policies. Cromwell and Cranmer were the primary <b>targets</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> protesters' fury. Cromwell and the king worked furiously to quell the rebellion, while Cranmer kept a low profile. After it was clear that Henry's regime was safe, the government took the initiative to remedy the evident inadequacy of the Ten Articles. The outcome after months of debate was The Institution of a Christian Man informally known from the first issue as the Bishops' Book. The book was initially proposed in February 1537 in the first vicegerential synod, ordered by Cromwell, for the whole Church. Cromwell opened the proceedings, but as the synod progressed, Cranmer and Foxe took on the chairmanship and the co-ordination. Foxe did most of the final editing and the book was published in late September.|$|E
5|$|The Nazi {{occupation}} of Poland {{was among the}} most brutal of the war, resulting in death of more than 3 million ethnic Poles and about 3 million Polish Jews. The six million Jewish, Roman Catholic and Orthodox Poles represented nearly 17 percent of the country's population. Poles were one of Hitler's first extermination targets, as he outlined in an August 22, 1939 speech to Wehrmacht commanders before the invasion. Intelligentsia, socially prominent and influential people were primarily targeted, although ethnic Poles and other Slavic groups were also killed en masse. Hundreds of thousands of Roman Catholic and Orthodox Poles were sent to Auschwitz-Birkenau and other concentration camps, and the intelligentsia were the first <b>targets</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Einsatzgruppen death squads. The anti-Polish campaign culminated in the near-complete destruction of Warsaw, ordered by Hitler and Himmler in 1944. The original assumptions of Generalplan Ost were based on plans to exterminate around 85% (over 20 million) of ethnically Polish citizens of Poland, with the remaining 15% to be used as slaves.|$|E
