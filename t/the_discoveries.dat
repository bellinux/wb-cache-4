40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} processes in device-to-device communications of cellular devices is that of <b>discovery,</b> which determines <b>the</b> proximity of devices. When a discovery process is performed, there are several parameters to determine, including <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> range, <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> period, and <b>the</b> modulation and coding scheme of <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> messages. In this paper, we address the relationships between these parameters and describe an optimization framework to determine them. In the proposed procedure, it is important to first optimize <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> rate, which is defined as the number of discoverable devices per unit time. Once <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> rate is maximized, <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> period can be determined accordingly based on the device density and <b>the</b> target <b>discovery</b> range. Since <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> rate is not affected by many of discovery parameters such as <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> range, <b>the</b> device density, and <b>the</b> <b>discovery</b> period, it {{can be used as a}} performance metric for comparing discovery schemes with different discovery ranges or different discovery periods...|$|R

When demons began appearing across the world, chaos ensued with the rising of opposing factions supported by human sympathizers: servants of God who sought to bring order, and servants of Lucifer who spread chaos. The conflict culminated into the international launching of ICBMs, which devastated the world and left humanity at the mercy of demons. During the events of Shin Megami Tensei, a group of young people defied both God and Lucifer in creating a world where humans could flourish again.|$|E
5|$|Observed in back-scattered {{light the}} main ring {{appears to be}} razor thin, {{extending}} in the vertical direction no more than 30km.

One of <b>the</b> <b>discoveries</b> of the Galileo orbiter was the bloom of the main ring—a faint, relatively thick (about 600km) cloud of material which surrounds its inner part. The bloom grows in thickness towards the inner boundary of the main ring, where it transitions into the halo.|$|E

Io's location within one of Jupiter's most intense radiation belts precluded a prolonged close flyby, but Galileo did pass close by shortly before entering orbit for its two-year, primary mission studying the Jovian system. Although no images were taken during the close flyby on 7 December 1995, the encounter did yield significant results, such as the discovery of a large iron core, similar to that found in the rocky planets of the inner Solar System.|$|E

5|$|The {{situation}} {{changed dramatically}} with the French military expedition to Egypt in 1798, which {{brought with it}} a corps of scholars to examine the surviving ancient monuments. The results of their study inspired a fascination with ancient Egypt throughout Europe. In the early nineteenth century, growing numbers of Europeans traveled to Egypt, both to see the ancient monuments and to collect Egyptian antiquities. Many temple artifacts, from small objects to enormous obelisks, were removed by outside governments and private collectors. This wave of Egyptomania resulted in the rediscovery of temple sites such as Abu Simbel, but artifacts and even whole temples were often treated with great carelessness. <b>The</b> <b>discoveries</b> of the period made possible the decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphs and the beginnings of Egyptology as a scholarly discipline.|$|E
