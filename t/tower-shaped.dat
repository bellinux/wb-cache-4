25|$|Ocean City was a {{combination}} of both <b>Tower-shaped</b> City and Marine City. It consisted of two rings that were tangent to one another, with housing on the inner ring and production on the outer one. Administrative buildings were found at the tangent point. The population would have been rigidly controlled at an upper limit of 500,000. Kikutake envisaged that the city would expand by multiplying itself as though it was undergoing cell division. This enforced the Metabolist idea that the expansion of cities could be a biological process.|$|E
500|$|During the spring, {{favorable}} food supplies, adequate light, and optimum {{water temperature}} provide conditions for breeding and early growth. At this time, the female deposits hundreds of egg capsules in <b>tower-shaped</b> structures about [...] high. The male fertilizes these eggs. After fertilization, the eggs develop into trochophore larvae, and the eggs subsequently hatch as free swimming microscopic veliger larvae, {{which can be}} carried some distance on ocean currents.|$|E
500|$|West of {{the ancient}} walls, the Palmyrenes built a number of {{large-scale}} funerary monuments which now form the Valley of Tombs, a [...] necropolis. The more than 50 monuments were primarily <b>tower-shaped</b> and up to four stories high.

The city had other cemeteries in the north, southwest and southeast, where the tombs are primarily hypogea (underground).|$|E

60|$|The {{sound of}} a horn {{breaking}} the stillness recalled his senses. He {{now for the first}} time perceived that a little distance below him, partly hidden in the trees, was a queer, <b>tower-shaped</b> structure with chains and pulleys, that in some strange way recalled his boyish reading. A drawbridge and portcullis! And on the battlement a figure in a masquerading dress as absurd as his own, flourishing a banner and trumpet, and trying to attract his attention.|$|E
6000|$|The Achaeans are {{constantly}} styled in the ILIAD {{and in the}} ODYSSEY [...] "chalkochitones," [...] "with bronze chitons." [...] epics have therefore boldly argued that by [...] "bronze chitons" [...] the poet pleasantly alludes to shields. But as the Mycenaeans seem scarcely to have worn any CHITONS in battle, {{as far as we}} are aware from their art, and are not known to have had any bronze shields, the argument evaporates, as Mr. Ridgeway has pointed out. Nothing can be less like a chiton or smock, loose or tight, than either the double-bellied huge shield, the <b>tower-shaped</b> cylindrical shield, or the flat, doorlike shield, covering body and legs in Mycenaean art. [...] "The bronze chiton," [...] says Helbig, [...] "is only a poetic phrase for the corslet." ...|$|E
60|$|My {{favourite}} red willow {{was also}} the chosen haunt of another being, a peregrine falcon, a large handsome female that used to spend some months each year with us, and would sit for hours {{every day in the}} tree. It was an ideal tree for the falcon, too, not only because it was a quiet spot where it could doze the hot hours away in safety, but also on account of the numbers of pigeons we used to keep. The pigeon- house, a round, <b>tower-shaped</b> building, whitewashed outside, with a small door always kept locked, was usually tenanted by four or five hundred birds. These cost us nothing to keep, and were never fed, as they picked up their own living on the plain, and being strong fliers and well used to the dangers of the open country abounding in hawks, they ranged far from home, going out in small parties of a dozen or more to their various distant feeding-grounds. When out riding we used to come on these flocks several miles from home, and knew they were our birds since no one else in that neighbourhood kept pigeons. They were highly valued, especially by my father, who preferred a broiled pigeon to mutton cutlets for breakfast, and was also fond of pigeon- pies. Once or twice every week, according to the season, eighteen or twenty young birds, just ready to leave the nest, were taken from the dovecote to be put into a pie of gigantic size, and this was usually the grandest dish on the table when {{we had a lot of}} people to dinner or supper.|$|E

50|$|Conical hills or {{mountains}} {{occur in}} different shapes {{and are not}} necessarily geometrically-shaped cones; some are more <b>tower-shaped</b> or have an asymmetric curve on one side. Typically, however, they have a circular base and smooth sides with a gradient of up to 30°. Such conical mountains are found in all volcanically-formed {{areas of the world}} such as the Bohemian Central Uplands in the Czech Republic, the Rhön in Germany or the Massif Central in France.|$|E
5000|$|Helliconian Tree, a strange-looking tree from Helliconia with a Cooling <b>tower-shaped</b> {{tree trunk}} and {{branches}} {{on the very}} top with thin in width leaves, making the branch look like a moth antennae during the short summers. Like deciduous trees on Earth, the Helliconian Tree turns dormant during snow-filled winters. It sheds its leaves but its branches curl up and go inside the Tree. The Tree then shields its top with an ice-like cap it grows.|$|E

50|$|The main {{characteristics}} of <b>tower-shaped</b> tombs {{can be seen}} in Garabaghlar mausoleum. The mausoleum is divided into two parts - a burial vault in lower part and upper overground part. The burial vault’s plan is similar to Barda mausoleum. The overground part of Garabaghlar mausoleum is very interesting for its architectural structure. A trunk of the mausoleum standing on a stone pedestal is originated from connection of 12 semicylinders. The mausoleum is distinguished from other mausoleums of Azerbaijan for architectural structure of its trunk. There is a boom with calligraphically written inscription {{on the top of the}} trunk as in Barda mausoleum. This inscription on Garabaghlar mausoleum was written with letters of white color and its background was made of blue frieze.|$|E
5000|$|Sasso di Bordighera was founded, {{following}} a local tradition, by {{the inhabitants of}} the neighbouring city of Taggia. The village is located on a rocky summit and its oldest part is made of <b>tower-shaped</b> houses. On the 21st of April 1686, the representants of eight villages, Camporosso, Vallebona, Vallecrosia, San Biagio della Cima, Sasso, Soldano, Borghetto San Nicolò and Bordighera had a meeting in order to build what they called [...] "Magnifica Comunità degli Otto Luoghi", which can be translated as: [...] "The magnificent community of the eight villages". Their goal was to gain independence from the nearby rival city of Ventimiglia. At the beginning of the 20th century Sasso was linked to the coast with a new road which, starting from Bordighera, continues up to Seborga.|$|E
5000|$|One {{part of a}} {{biological}} profile is a person's racial or ancestral affinity. People with considerable European ancestry generally have relatively no prognathism; a relatively small face; a narrow, tear-shaped nasal cavity; a [...] "silled" [...] nasal aperture; <b>tower-shaped</b> nasal bones; a triangular-shaped palate; and an angular and sloping eye orbit shape. People with considerable African ancestry typically have a broad and round nasal cavity; no dam or nasal sill; Quonset hut-shaped nasal bones; notable facial projection in the jaw and mouth area (prognathism); a rectangular-shaped palate; and a square or rectangular eye orbit shape. People with considerable East Asian ancestry are often characterized by a relatively small prognathism; no nasal sill or dam; an oval-shaped nasal cavity; tent-shaped nasal bones; a horseshoe-shaped palate; and a rounded and non-sloping eye orbit shape. Many of these characteristics are {{only a matter of}} frequency among particular races: their presence or absence of one or more does not automatically classify an individual into a racial group.|$|E
