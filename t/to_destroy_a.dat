5|$|The {{importance}} of another key social fact: the culture. Groups, when interacting, {{create their own}} culture and attach powerful emotions to it. He {{was one of the}} first scholars to consider the question of culture so intensely. Durkheim was interested in cultural diversity, and how the existence of diversity nonetheless fails <b>to</b> <b>destroy</b> <b>a</b> society. To that, Durkheim answered that any apparent cultural diversity is overridden by a larger, common, and more generalized cultural system, and the law.|$|E
5|$|The nuclear {{properties}} of plutonium-239 were also studied; {{researchers found that}} when it is hit by a neutron it breaks apart (fissions) by releasing more neutrons and energy. These neutrons can hit other atoms of plutonium-239 and so on in an exponentially fast chain reaction. This can result in an explosion large enough <b>to</b> <b>destroy</b> <b>a</b> city if enough of the isotope is concentrated to form a critical mass.|$|E

5|$|Alien Rage is a first-person shooter {{video game}} for Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360 (through Xbox Live Arcade), and PlayStation 3 (through PlayStation Network). Alien Rage was {{developed}} by Polish developer CI Games, then known as City Interactive, using Unreal Engine 3. The game has single-player and competitive multiplayer modes. In its single player campaign, players are put in control of an elite soldier named Jack. Jack is sent <b>to</b> <b>destroy</b> <b>a</b> mining facility and the aliens within it after the aliens turned against and killed the humans that they had shared the facility with.|$|E
5|$|Coastal Command sank 27 U-boats in 1942 {{and damaged}} 18 more. Some of these kills were {{shared with the}} Navy. Bomber Command, by contrast, whose {{priority}} garnered them greater resources {{at the expense of}} Coastal Command, failed <b>to</b> <b>destroy</b> <b>a</b> single completed U-boat on the slip until April 1944. Arthur Harris, GOC Bomber Command, deplored the use of aircraft for defensive purposes and insisted the threat would be checked by attacking production. An indication of the effectiveness of air tactics was the fact very few Allied ships were sunk within 600 miles of British waters by late 1942. Between June 1942 to June 1943, 71 enemy submarines were sunk by the command.|$|E
5|$|In 1802, {{shortly after}} {{discovering}} Pallas, Olbers suggested to Herschel that Ceres and Pallas were fragments {{of a much}} larger planet that once occupied the Mars–Jupiter region, this planet having suffered an internal explosion or a cometary impact many million years before. Over time, however, this hypothesis has fallen from favor. The large amount of energy required <b>to</b> <b>destroy</b> <b>a</b> planet, combined with the belt's low combined mass, which is only about 4% of the mass of the Moon, do not support the hypothesis. Further, the significant chemical differences between the asteroids become difficult to explain if they come from the same planet. Today, most scientists accept that, rather than fragmenting from a progenitor planet, the asteroids never formed a planet at all.|$|E

Shaken by the massacre of his troops, Kurt improves the training regimen for his next batch of SPARTAN-III recruits, but they too are all killed in action so Kurt, {{in an effort to}} reduce casualties, institutes illegal biological modifications on the third company of SPARTANs. While conducting a training exercise near Zone 67, UNSC personnel find themselves under attack by alien robotic drones.|$|E
5|$|Lost Coast follows Half-Life protagonist Gordon Freeman as {{he travels}} up a coastal cliff <b>to</b> <b>destroy</b> <b>a</b> Combine {{artillery}} launcher in a monastery, which is firing {{on a nearby}} town. The Lost Coast level was originally created for Half-Life 2, but was ultimately removed from the game. As a result, it has several minor story details that {{were not included in}} Half-Life 2. The level received a generally positive reception, and there was consensus among reviewers that the new features included in Lost Coast should be integrated into future games released by Valve.|$|E
5|$|Lützow and Admiral Scheer were {{deployed}} to Norway in 1942 {{to join the}} attacks on Allied convoys to the Soviet Union. Admiral Scheer conducted Operation Wunderland in August 1942, a sortie into the Kara Sea to attack Soviet merchant shipping, though it ended without significant success. Lützow participated in the Battle of the Barents Sea in December 1942, a failed attempt <b>to</b> <b>destroy</b> <b>a</b> convoy. Both ships were damaged {{in the course of}} their deployment to Norway, and eventually returned to Germany for repairs. They ended their careers bombarding advancing Soviet forces on the Eastern Front; both ships were destroyed by British bombers in the final weeks of the war. Lützow was raised and sunk as a target by the Soviet Navy while Admiral Scheer was partially broken up in situ, with the remainder of the hulk buried beneath rubble.|$|E
