2500|$|On July 14, 2012, {{after being}} {{inspired}} by a recent Make-A-Wish function in which Ron Perlman appeared in full Hellboy makeup for a terminally ill boy, Del Toro stated, [...] "I can say publicly <b>that</b> <b>now</b> <b>we</b> are together in trying [...] ".|$|E
2500|$|Boyle {{also had}} a monogenist {{perspective}} about race origin. He was a pioneer studying races, and he believed that all human beings, no matter how diverse their physical differences, {{came from the same}} source: Adam and Eve. He studied reported stories of parents' giving birth to different coloured albinos, so he concluded that Adam and Eve were originally white and that Caucasians could give birth to different coloured races. Boyle also extended the theories of Robert Hooke and Isaac Newton about colour and light via optical projection (in physics) into discourses of polygenesis, speculating that maybe these differences were due to [...] "seminal impressions". Taking this into account, it might be considered that he envisioned a good explanation for complexion at his time, due to the fact <b>that</b> <b>now</b> <b>we</b> know that skin colour is disposed by genes, which are actually contained in the semen. Boyle's writings mention that at his time, for [...] "European Eyes", beauty was not measured so much in colour of skin, but in [...] "stature, comely symmetry of the parts of the body, and good features in the face". Various members of the scientific community rejected his views and described them as [...] "disturbing" [...] or [...] "amusing".|$|E

6000|$|... "We {{have had}} very clever people to deal with, Lady Eustace;--and I fear <b>that,</b> even <b>now,</b> <b>we</b> shall never get back the property." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you, Bathurst. Then we will {{consider}} <b>that</b> arranged. <b>Now</b> <b>we</b> will get the horses in as soon as possible, and be off at once." ...|$|R
60|$|Then, {{actually}} {{with tears}} in her eyes, she said <b>that</b> <b>now</b> <b>we</b> knew why she couldn't take us in--why she had to seem so unkind.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] he said; [...] "it won't run to <b>that</b> <b>now.</b> <b>We</b> must wave {{our hands}} at the blue hills far away there {{and go back to}} London and work." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{should say}} it was--to me. Don't be in a hurry. You're {{thinking}} <b>that,</b> <b>now</b> <b>we</b> {{know all about}} you, your utility as a sleuth has waned to some extent. Is that it?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'We shall take {{a dose of}} {{him every}} night after dinner to {{complete}} the resemblance.

6000|$|... "But {{you know}} we are so young, <b>that</b> <b>now</b> <b>we</b> have not her to judge for us, we must only do little things that we are quite sure of, or we shall get wrong." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{not asking}} about <b>that</b> <b>now.</b> <b>We</b> hope {{there will be}} years and years to come, in which you may change them, and shape them as you will. What shall I tell him now from you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She thinks <b>that</b> <b>now</b> <b>we</b> have children, {{and that}} she has two, we can {{consider}} what was past, past and closed and done with, {{and she wants to}} hear--about me.... Apart from everything else--we were very great friends." ...|$|E

30|$|Obviously, the {{independent}} and identically distributed (i.i.d.) data are strong mixing since P (A∩ B)=P(A) P (B) and α(k)≡ 0 in <b>that</b> case. <b>Now,</b> <b>we</b> provide two examples for strong mixing data.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{could do}} that myself, my dear," [...] said I, [...] "but we won't discuss <b>that</b> subject <b>now.</b> <b>We</b> will buy just what we {{absolutely}} need, and then work up from that." ...|$|R
6000|$|To this King Angus made reply: [...] "I {{had hoped}} <b>that</b> <b>now</b> <b>we</b> were come to Ireland you had changed your purpose in that matter. Are you yet {{of the same}} mind as when you first spake to me?" ...|$|E

60|$|And {{the third}} must {{therefore}} needs follow, that is, he overthroweth {{the testimony of}} his servants; for they have said, <b>that</b> <b>now</b> <b>we</b> receive the spirit of bondage again to fear no more; that is, after that we by the Holy Ghost are enabled to call God Father, Father.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is fine, Ladislaw: {{that is the}} way to put it. Write <b>that</b> down, <b>now.</b> <b>We</b> {{must begin}} to get {{documents}} about the feeling of the country, as well as the machine-breaking and general distress." ...|$|R
30|$|If M= 0, it {{is evident}} from (2.1) <b>that</b> (2.3) holds. <b>Now</b> <b>we</b> assume M> 0. Let _t→∞x(t)=α, then 0 ≤α≤c/δ+M. <b>Now</b> <b>we</b> prove <b>that</b> α≤c/δ.|$|R

"I know it's doubtful, I know it's dangerous," [...] he went on, [...] "but I am {{convinced}} <b>that</b> <b>now</b> <b>we</b> {{can no longer}} keep men's minds and souls in these feathered nests, these spheres of illusion.

6000|$|... "Tis {{only the}} innocent," [...] {{returned}} the young man, glancing his {{eye to the}} other end of the piazza. [...] "They confer often together. Whittal hath just come in from the woods, whither he is much inclined to pass an hour or two, each evening. Thou wast saying <b>that</b> <b>now</b> <b>we</b> have our sister--?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Even if {{the boats}} {{have not been}} here," [...] Nat said to Lippincott, [...] "I don't think we shall have any trouble with them; they will have heard our guns, and, I dare say, the musketry firing, and will know <b>that,</b> <b>now</b> <b>we</b> are awake and on our guard, we should {{probably}} sink them before they reached us." ...|$|E

60|$|<b>That</b> <b>now</b> <b>we</b> wish {{well to the}} Italian {{cause is}} true, I hope, but, at best, it is a noble inconsistency; {{and that we should}} set up a claim to a nation's {{gratitude}} on these grounds seems to me worse than absurd. The more we are in earnest now, the more ashamed we should be for what has been.|$|E
60|$|At least, I did {{not want}} in confidence; and when I next rushed Solan it was to one side with {{implicit}} confidence that he must turn to meet my new line of attack, and turn he did, so <b>that</b> <b>now</b> <b>we</b> fought with our sides towards the coveted goal--the great switch stood within my reach upon my right hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{told them}} not to close the path," [...] Dias said. [...] "We can do <b>that</b> <b>now</b> <b>we</b> are all together. Most of the rocks are too heavy for José and Maria to lift.

6000|$|... "Ay, ay," [...] {{said the}} captain, [...] "I could swear to <b>that.</b> And <b>now</b> <b>we</b> must act together. When I {{put my hand}} on him, you do the same, and give him no chance to use his sword or pistols." ...|$|R
