5|$|Just {{like the}} player's pilot, {{most of the}} other {{characters}} are low-key. The non-player character Admiral Aken Bosch, however, plays a crucial part in moving the story. As a prominent antagonist from the start, he sparks off a rebellion which escalates the scale of action, and brings in the other antagonist force, the Shivans, into the story. The storytelling took on a character-driven approach with expositions taking the form of cutscenes in which Bosch gives out monologues, revealing the purpose and driving forces behind his actions. A few established voice actors were brought in to give a polished touch <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>voices</b> in the game. Academy Award nominee Robert Loggia voiced the player's commanding officer, Admiral Petrarch, and Admiral Bosch was voiced by Ronny Cox. Kurtwood Smith and Stephen Baldwin participated in bit roles as well.|$|E
5|$|Vampyr {{was filmed}} between 1930 and 1931. Everything being shot on location, as Dreyer {{believed}} {{it would be}} beneficial by lending the dream-like ghost world of the film as well as allowing them to save money by not having to rent studio space. Dreyer originally wanted Vampyr to be a silent film, as it uses many elements of the silent era such as title cards to explain the story. Dialogue in the film was kept to a minimum. For the scenes with dialogue, the actors mouthed their lines in French, German and English so their lip movements would correspond <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>voices</b> {{that were going to}} be recorded in post-production. There is no record of the English version being completed. The scenes in the chateau were shot in April and May 1930. The chateau also acted as housing for the cast and crew during the filming. Life in the chateau was unpleasant for them as it was cold and infested with rats. The church yard scenes were shot in August 1930. The church was not an actual church, but a barn with a number of tombstones placed around it. This set was designed by the art director Hermann Warm.|$|E
25|$|In Aleppo, Syria this custom {{seems to}} go back about 500 years.

When they arrived at Mizmor Shir LeYom HaShabbat they would break {{to listen to a}} sermon by one of the Rabbis who discussed the Parashah of the week.

25|$|He is, by no {{stretch of}} imagination, an austere batsman, but the {{reckless}} ostentatiousness has been curbed, and a matured aggression has emerged.

It brought about his demise against Harbhajan Singh in India in 2001 when he was hell-bent on sweeping when the circumstances demanded a safer method.

25|$|Also in 1971, {{the group}} {{toyed with the}} idea of adding a second drummer, supplementing Hartman's {{drumming}} on some of their shows with that of Navy veteran Michael Hossack while still touring behind their first album. In October 1971, the band recorded several songs for their second album with Shogren on bass, guitar, and background vocals. But a little later, during the album's recording, Shogren left after disagreements with the group's new producer, Ted Templeman. Shogren was replaced in December 1971 with singer, songwriter and bass guitarist Tiran Porter, while Hossack was added to the lineup at the same time as a regular. Porter and Hossack were both stalwarts of the Northern California music scene, Porter having previously played in Scratch with Simmons. Porter brought a funkier bass style to the band and added his husky baritone <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>voices</b> of Johnston and Simmons, resulting in a rich three-part harmonic vocal blend.|$|E

500|$|The {{producers}} {{chose to}} present the Muppet Mr. Snuffleupagus ("Snuffy") and his family's experience of divorce. The episode was written by staff writer Norman Stiles, who also wrote the 1983 episode in which Mr. Hooper's death was explained. Every word of the divorce episode was reviewed by the Children's Television Workshop's (CTW) advisory board, content experts, and developmental psychologists. After tests showed that their young viewers were confused by the episode and did not understand important concepts about divorce, the producers decided to not air it, despite the investment they had made. It {{was the first time}} the show's producers made this kind of decision, and was cited as an example of the producer's practice of [...] "listening <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>voices</b> of children and by putting their needs first", despite the costs.|$|E
500|$|The work is {{concluded}} by the doxology, [...] (Glory to the Father), {{performed by}} the ensemble in two parts. The first part addresses the Trinity. Glory is given three times.

In the second , leading <b>to</b> , <b>the</b> <b>voices</b> sing the first syllable as an extended melisma in triplets, as another symbol of the Trinity, beginning in upward moving lines, for three measures in the basses, half a measure less for each following voice.

In the fourth , leading to [...] (and to the Holy Spirit), in again [...] similar pattern the voices follow each other from top to bottom, ending in a long cadenza.|$|E

Dorian Lynskey of The Guardian compared the singer's vocals <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>voices</b> of Ciara and Cassie. The second track, [...] "Push Up On Me", features echo electro claps and surging synths. [...] "Don't Stop the Music" [...] is a dance-pop and techno song that contains rhythmic devices used mainly in hip hop music. The song samples the line [...] "Mama-say, mama-sa, ma-ma-ko-ssa" [...] from Michael Jackson's 1983 single [...] "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'". The fourth song is [...] "Breakin' Dishes"; Peter Robinson of The Observer {{called it a}} [...] "wronged-woman bonanza, packed with hooks, chants and flashes of lyrical brilliance." [...] "Shut Up and Drive" [...] is a new wave and pop rock song, influenced by 1970s and 1980s musical styles, sampling New Order's 1983 single [...] "Blue Monday". The collaboration with Ne-Yo, [...] "Hate That I Love You", is a folky R song; Nick Levine of Digital Spy compared it to Ne-Yo's singles [...] "Sexy Love" [...] and [...] "Because of You".|$|E

It has low-resolution backgrounds, and pretty much nothing at all to get excited about". He also called the music [...] "boring and {{completely}} uninspiring". Allgame editor Matt Grandstaff commended the card games, as they [...] "require a fair amount of strategy, and thus remain entertaining" [...] and that [...] "the look and feel of Caesars Palace 2000 recaptures the feel of one of the most successful casinos of all-time". He stated that the game [...] "is definitely not about the looks" [...] but [...] "does an admirable job recreating the casino experience". Grandstaff felt that the game [...] "has the sound of a real casino. From background clatter <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>voices</b> of the dealer, this is Caesar's Palace". He noted that players [...] "will enjoy sitting through hours of card games" [...] but to [...] "Avoid the slots".

500|$|Based {{upon their}} findings, {{and despite the}} expense and their {{intention}} to air [...] "Snuffy's Parents Get a Divorce" [...] in April 1992, the CTW decided not to risk possibly harming their audience and not air the episode. McGrath said,"They wrote a whole show and taped it, {{and it was just}} devastating for test groups of kids. So they just threw the whole thing in the garbage and never tried it again. It was just too difficult a concept for a 3-year-old". CTW Research director Valeria Lovelace recommended scrapping the episode and going [...] "back to the drawing board", and the idea was abandoned, at least for the season. Producer Michael Loman recalled, [...] "We ate the cost and never aired it. We feel there are a range of issues that we can deal with in the family that do not go to the extreme of divorce". According to Sesame Street researcher Susan Scheiner, {{it was the first time}} the CTW had produced an episode, and after making a large investment, found after tests that the episode did not work. Rosemarie T. Truglio and her colleagues at the CTW cited the episode as an example of the CTW's practice of [...] "listening <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>voices</b> of children and by putting their needs first".|$|E

2500|$|Between 500 and 200 B.C. the Chinese {{compiled}} Erya, {{a universal}} encyclopedia which prominently featured insects.

This custom was imitated by all the people." [...] The oldest artifact identified as a cricket home was discovered in a tomb dated 960 A.D. The Field Museum of Natural History owned a 12th-century scroll painted by Su Han-Chen depicting children playing with crickets. By this time, as evidenced in the painting, the Chinese had already developed the art of making clay cricket homes, the skills of careful handling of the insects, {{and the practice of}} tickling to stimulate them. The first reliable accounts of cricket fights date back to the 12th century (Song dynasty) {{but there is also a}} theory tracing cricket fights to the reign of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang (8th century).|$|E
2500|$|Ancient Hebrew music, {{like much}} Arabic music today, was {{probably}} monophonic; that is, {{there is no}} harmony. [...] Niebuhr refers {{to the fact that}} when Arabs play on different instruments and sing at the same time, almost the same melody is heard from all, unless one of them sings or plays as bass one and the same note throughout. It was probably the same with the Israelites in olden times, who attuned the stringed instruments <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>voices</b> of the singers either on the same note or in the octave or at some other consonant interval. This explains the remark in II Chron. v. 13 that at the dedication of the Temple the playing of the instruments, the singing of the Psalms, and the blare of the trumpets sounded as one sound. Probably the unison of the singing of Psalms was the accord of two voices an octave apart. This may explain the terms [...] "'al 'alamot" [...] and [...] "'al ha-sheminit." [...] On account of the important part which women from the earliest times took in singing, it is comprehensible that the higher pitch was simply called the [...] "maiden's key," [...] and [...] "ha-sheminit" [...] would then be an octave lower.|$|E
