5|$|A {{railroad}} link to Aspen {{was therefore}} {{likely to be}} highly profitable, and two railroads, the Colorado Midland and the Denver & Rio Grande Western, hoped to be the first. In the early 1880s, however, neither seemed able to do so. The Midland was a paper railroad with no money to build anything. The Rio Grande was building, but too quickly, forcing it into receivership. Financially cautious from its recent troubles, it chose not <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>to</b> Aspen despite its president's enthusiasm for the project.|$|E
5|$|Beese {{introduced}} Winehouse to his boss, Nick Gatfield, and the Island head {{shared his}} enthusiasm in signing the young artist. Winehouse was signed to Island, as rival interest in Winehouse had started <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>to</b> include representatives of EMI and Virgin {{starting to make}} moves. Beese told HitQuarters that he felt the reason behind the excitement, over an artist who was an atypical pop star for the time, was due to a backlash against reality TV music shows, which included audiences starved for fresh, genuine young talent.|$|E
5|$|Calshot Castle was {{designed}} to protect the Solent, a body of water that led from the English Channel to the naval base at Portsmouth and, through Southampton Water, to the important port of Southampton. The castle was one of four forts that William Fitzwilliam, the Lord Admiral, and William Paulet decided <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>to</b> improve the defences along the Solent; the others were at East and West Cowes, and Hurst. Calshot was constructed on the narrow Calshot Spit, overlooking the deep-water channel running through into Southampton. Temporary earthwork defences and gun batteries were erected as an interim measure, but the castle itself was built quickly and finished by the end of 1540. It probably reused stone and lead from Bealieu and Netley abbeys, which had recently been closed during the Dissolution of the Monasteries.|$|E

Several other Scottish lines were {{authorised}} {{on the same}} day, 31 July 1845, including the Scottish Central Railway, <b>to</b> <b>build</b> from Castlecary <b>to</b> Perth, the Scottish Midland Junction Railway, <b>to</b> <b>build</b> from Perth <b>to</b> Forfar, and the Scottish Midland Junction Railway, <b>to</b> <b>build</b> from Perth <b>to</b> Forfar.

5|$|The {{light rail}} {{is now under}} {{construction}} from Lagunen via Kokstad to Bergen Airport, Flesland. Both Sørås and Indre Steinsvik have experienced rapid housing construction without a corresponding increase of public transport. Further out is a large corporate center with many of Bergen's largest employers, such as Telenor, Statoil and BKK. The area was built without sufficient roads or public transport, and has among the worst road congestion in the urban area. Building the light rail line to Flesland will supplement the airport shuttles and offer cheaper service for locals and employees at the airport. Another incentive <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>to</b> Flesland {{was that there was}} sufficient available land which allows a large depot to be constructed. After the line was opened to Lagunen, there was insufficient space at Kronstad to house additional trams. The line to the airport is scheduled to open in 2016.|$|E
5|$|Governor Broward {{ran for the}} U.S. Senate in 1908 but lost. Broward and his predecessor, William Jennings, {{were paid}} by Richard Bolles to tour the state to promote drainage. Broward {{was elected to the}} Senate in 1910, but died before he could take office. He was eulogized across Florida for his {{leadership}} and progressive inspiration. Rapidly growing Fort Lauderdale paid him tribute by naming Broward County after him (the town's original plan had been to name it Everglades County). Land in the Everglades was being sold for $15 an acre a month after Broward died. Meanwhile, Henry Flagler continued to build railway stations at towns as soon as the populations warranted them. News of the Panama Canal inspired him to connect his rail line to the closest deep water port. Biscayne Bay was too shallow, so Flagler sent railway scouts to explore the possibility of building the line through to the tip of mainland Florida. The scouts reported that not enough land was present to build through the Everglades, so Flagler instead changed the plan <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>to</b> Key West in 1912.|$|E

25|$|On 9 December 2009, BHP Billiton {{sold its}} Ravensthorpe Nickel Mine, which cost A$2.4billion <b>to</b> <b>build,</b> <b>to</b> Vancouver-based First Quantum Minerals for US$340million. First Quantum {{was one of}} three bidders for the mine and {{actually}} produced the lowest offer. The Canadian company plans to have the mine back in production in mid-2011. Ravensthorpe cost BHP US$3.6billion in writedowns when it was shut in January 2009 after less than a year of production.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} railways {{were built}} {{and paid for}} by the owners of the mines they served. As railway technology developed, longer lines became possible, connecting mines with more distant transshipment points and promising lower costs. These longer lines often required public subscription to build and crossed over land not owned by the mine owners. As a result, they needed an Act of Parliament <b>to</b> <b>build,</b> <b>to</b> enforce the sale of wayleave by landowners. The Acts also protected investors from unrealistic, or downright fraudulent, schemes.|$|E

25|$|For {{most of its}} existence, PRR was {{conservative}} in its locomotive choices and pursued standardization, both in locomotive types and their component parts. Almost alone among U.S. railroads, the PRR designed most of its steam locomotive classes itself. It built {{most of them in}} Altoona, outsourcing only when PRR facilities could not keep up with the railroad's needs. In such cases, subcontractors were hired <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>to</b> PRR designs, unlike most railroads that ordered to broad specifications and left most design choices to the builder.|$|E
25|$|Where a dam serves {{multiple}} purposes, a hydroelectric station may {{be added}} with relatively low construction cost, providing a useful revenue stream {{to offset the}} costs of dam operation. It has been calculated that the sale of electricity from the Three Gorges Dam will cover the construction costs after 5 to 8 years of full generation. Additionally, some data shows that in most countries large hydropower dams will be too costly and take too long <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>to</b> deliver a positive risk adjusted return, unless appropriate risk management measures are put in place.|$|E
25|$|In a 2009 case study, entomologists {{from the}} U.S. Forest Service, Cornell University and the University of Massachusetts-Amherst {{released}} 900 Laricobius nigrinus beetles into {{a stand of}} adelgid-infested hemlocks near Lansing, New York. L. nigrinus, which is native to the Pacific Northwest, naturally preys on the hemlock wooly adelgid. The particular site near Lansing was chosen because its hemlocks are only lightly infested with the woolly adelgid, and there are enough trees to sustain a long-term study. The site will be left untreated with pesticides for 10 years to study how well the L. nigrinus beetles become established; if the experiment proves successful, researchers expect the population will take {{two to three years}} <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>to</b> levels where they can be readily detected.|$|E

25|$|In 1947, {{the newly}} formed Metropolitan Transit Authority (M.T.A.) decided <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>to</b> Lynn as a rapid transit line, and {{construction}} began in October 1948. The {{first part of the}} Revere Extension opened to Orient Heights on January 5, 1952, with intermediate stations at Airport Station and Day Square, and to Suffolk Downs on April 21, 1952. The second phase (cut short due to limited funds, and possibly due to the Eastern Massachusetts wielding its influence to protect its business in Lynn) opened to Wonderland on January 19, 1954 with intermediate stations at Beachmont and Revere Beach. All stations from Orient Heights to Wonderland were located at the sites of former BRB stations. The line was renamed as the Blue Line in 1965.|$|E
25|$|Closely tied to {{the early}} NJRR was the Paterson and Hudson River Railroad (P), later the main line of the Erie Railroad. The P agreed in June 1833 <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>to</b> {{the west side of}} the New Jersey Palisades at Marion Junction, where it would use the NJRR's Bergen Hill Cut the rest of the way to the Hudson River. The P opened November 29, 1833, prior to the opening of any part of the NJRR, in the {{meantime}} using a stagecoach along the Newark Turnpike to reach the river. A trackage rights agreement was made October 10, 1834, and P operation to Jersey City began October 20. The Long Dock Tunnel opened April 15, 1861, giving the P (by then part of the Erie) its own route to the Hudson River.|$|E
25|$|Hitherto {{railways}} in {{the region}} had had a local focus, but now the Great North of England Railway (GNER) obtained authorising Acts to build from Newcastle to York, forming part of a continuous trunk railway network to connect to London; the project was controlled by George Hudson, the so-called Railway King. At first the GNER was content {{to get access to}} the N Newcastle terminus, by connecting with the N at Redheugh and running over its line across the Tyne and up to the Spital. This had the advantage of avoiding a separate, and expensive, crossing of the river, but would have meant a steep descent to Redheugh as the GNER line approached on high ground from the Team Valley, only to climb once again to the Spital. Moreover William Brandling had made known his intention to reach Newcastle from his line by running at a high level through Gateshead. On 25 April 1837 the N decided <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>to</b> their south side, low level terminus at Redheugh, but to leave the issue of the Tyne crossing open.|$|E

25|$|The CIFH was {{chartered}} by the New York State Legislature on June 7, 1890 {{to build}} from the 39th Street Ferry through New Utrecht to Coney Island and Fort Hamilton. Soon the Atlantic Avenue was {{also interested in}} extending its Fifth Avenue Line through Flynn's land to 36th Street, which it had a franchise <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>to.</b> In 1892, Flynn took over the Union Railroad, which had been chartered on May 6, 1884 and incorporated June 19 by other parties to connect Hamilton Ferry with Prospect Park along Union Street. Flynn's plan was to build the Union Street Line and a connection along Second Avenue to the CIFH, allowing the RIFH to reach Hamilton Ferry. Flynn also planned to extend the Union Street Line east via East New York to City Line. The Kings County Electric Railway was incorporated by Flynn on November 29, 1892 to build a crosstown line from the 39th Street Ferry east along Church Avenue and New Lots Avenue to City Line, and to build from Canarsie Landing north to the city line {{on the west side}} of the Cemetery of the Evergreens, crossing the east-west line at Brownsville and the Union Street Line extension at East New York.|$|E
