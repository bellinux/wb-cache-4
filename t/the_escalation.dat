5|$|As a {{spin-off}} {{from the}} Rudolphine Tables {{and the related}} Ephemerides, Kepler published astrological calendars, which were very popular and helped offset the costs of producing his other work—especially when support from the Imperial treasury was withheld. In his calendars—six between 1617 and 1624—Kepler forecast planetary positions and weather {{as well as political}} events; the latter were often cannily accurate, thanks to his keen grasp of contemporary political and theological tensions. By 1624, however, <b>the</b> <b>escalation</b> of those tensions and the ambiguity of the prophecies meant political trouble for Kepler himself; his final calendar was publicly burned in Graz.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> {{conflict}} <b>escalation</b> {{curve is}} a concept created by Michael N. Nagler. <b>The</b> conflict <b>escalation</b> curve proposes that the intensity of a conflict {{is directly related to}} how far dehumanization has proceeded. In other words, conflicts escalate in the degree to which parties dehumanize one another (or one party is dehumanizing the other).|$|R
5|$|In China, {{nationalist}} and communist forces resumed {{the civil}} war in June 1946. Communist forces were victorious and established the People's Republic of China on the mainland, while nationalist forces retreated to Taiwan in 1949. In the Middle East, the Arab rejection of the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine and the creation of Israel marked <b>the</b> <b>escalation</b> of the Arab–Israeli conflict. While European powers attempted to retain some or all of their colonial empires, their losses of prestige and resources during the war rendered this unsuccessful, leading to decolonisation.|$|E
5|$|On 8 October 1996, 7 {{months after}} <b>the</b> <b>escalation</b> over Imia a Greek Mirage 2000 {{reportedly}} fired an R.550 Magic II missile and shot down a Turkish F-16D over the Aegean Sea. The Turkish pilot died, while the co-pilot ejected and was rescued by Greek forces. In August 2012, after the downing of a RF-4E on the Syrian Coast, Turkish Defence Minister İsmet Yılmaz {{confirmed that the}} Turkish F-16D was shot down by a Greek Mirage 2000 with an R.550 Magic II in 1996 after violating Greek airspace near Chios island. Greece denies that the F-16 was shot down. Both Mirage 2000 pilots reported that the F-16 caught fire and they saw one parachute.|$|E
5|$|The {{dynamics}} of the air war changed in June 1941. The German invasion of the Soviet Union, Operation Barbarossa, opened up the Eastern Front. The German bomber force was heavily committed to the theatre. <b>The</b> <b>escalation</b> of the fighting in the Mediterranean and North African theatres also diverted German air strength. The operations of the Luftwaffe over Britain changed dramatically. Small numbers of bombers would make hit-and-run attacks on selected targets near the coast {{for the remainder of}} 1941, replacing the mass raids of the preceding autumn and winter. Cunningham used the decline in the pace of operations to train new crews.|$|E

5|$|The entire {{complexion}} of the American {{effort was}} altered on 8 March 1965, when 3,500 U.S. Marines came ashore at Da Nang, ostensibly {{to defend the}} southern airfields committed to prosecuting Rolling Thunder. The mission of the ground forces was expanded to combat operations and, from that point onward, the aerial campaign became a secondary operation, overwhelmed by troop deployments and <b>the</b> <b>escalation</b> of ground operations in South Vietnam. Until {{the third week of}} April, Rolling Thunder had enjoyed at least equal status with air missions conducted in the south. After that time, strikes that interfered with requirements for the southern battlefield were either cut back or cancelled.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>escalation</b> of the Cold War was {{highlighted}} by Truman's approval of NSC-68, a secret statement of foreign policy. It called for tripling the defense budget, and the globalization and militarization of containment policy whereby the U.S. and its NATO allies would respond militarily to actual Soviet expansion. The document {{was drafted by}} Paul Nitze, who consulted State and Defense officials; it was formally approved by President Truman as official national strategy after the war began in Korea. It called for partial mobilization of the U.S. economy to build armaments faster than the Soviets. The plan called for strengthening Europe, weakening the Soviet Union, and for building up the U.S. both militarily and economically.|$|E
5|$|In November 1940 Air Marshal Sholto Douglas became Air Officer Commanding (AOC) RAF Fighter Command. On 8 December 1940 a {{directive}} from the Air Staff called for Sector Offensive Sweeps. It ordered hit-and-run operations over Belgium and France. The operations {{were to be}} conducted by three squadrons to harass German air defences. On 10 January 1941 Circus attacks were initiated by sending small bomber formations protected by large numbers of fighters. <b>The</b> <b>escalation</b> of offensive operations throughout 1941 was designed to draw up the Luftwaffe as Douglas' Command took an increasingly offensive stance. These operations {{became known as the}} Circus offensive. Trafford Leigh-Mallory, AOC 11 Group, penned Operations Instruction No. 7, which he had written on 16 February. Leigh-Mallory outlined six distinct operations for day fighters: Ramrod (bomber escort with primary goal the destruction of the target); Fighter Ramrod (The same goal where fighters escorted ground-attack fighters); Roadstead (Bomber escort and anti-shipping operations); Fighter Roadstead (the same operation as Roadstead but without bombers) along with Rhubarb (poor weather ground attack operation) and Circus operations (see glossary).|$|E

5|$|In {{the last}} years of the 19th century and {{the first years of the}} 20th, <b>the</b> <b>escalation</b> in the {{building}} of battleships became an arms race between Britain and Germany. The German naval laws of 1890 and 1898 authorised a fleet of 38 battleships, a vital threat to the balance of naval power. Britain answered with further shipbuilding, but by the end of the pre-dreadnought era, British supremacy at sea had markedly weakened. In 1883, the United Kingdom had 38 battleships, twice as many as France and almost as many as the rest of the world put together. By 1897, Britain's lead was far smaller due to competition from France, Germany, and Russia, as well as the development of pre-dreadnought fleets in Italy, the United States and Japan. Turkey, Spain, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, Chile and Brazil all had second-rate fleets led by armored cruisers, coastal defence ships or monitors.|$|E
5|$|On April 15, when President Lincoln {{called for}} 75,000 troops in {{response}} to the attack on Fort Sumter, the 5th Massachusetts was ordered by Massachusetts Governor John A. Andrew to prepare for active service in the field. Andrew dispatched four regiments on April 17 and 18, holding the 5th Massachusetts in reserve for the time being. On April 19, pro-secessionist rioters in Baltimore attacked the 6th Massachusetts as that regiment attempted to make their way to Washington. Alarmed by <b>the</b> <b>escalation</b> in violence, Andrew summoned the 5th Massachusetts to Boston to prepare for departure. The first companies arrived in Boston that same day on April 19. By April 20 the remaining companies reported and the regiment was prepared to depart. That night, the unit barracked in Faneuil Hall and departed for Virginia on April 21, 1861.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} {{boom of the}} 1970s and early 1980s {{that took place in}} Texas (because of <b>the</b> <b>escalation</b> in oil prices) benefited the Bay Area communities significantly. Industrial operations were expanded including the opening of the U.S. Steel plant in Baytown in 1970, and the Barbours Cut shipping terminal at Morgan's Point in 1977. The Port of Texas City became the third leading port in Texas by tonnage and ninth in the nation. The Barbours Cut terminal, operated by the Port of Houston, became the seventh leading port in the nation. Not all of this development was without controversy, however. In building Barbours Cut, the Port of Houston used its power of eminent domain to evict residents from nearly one third of the homes in Morgan's Point. Still, when the Texas economy declined in the later 1980s, the economic diversity of the area and substantial annual federal investments related to JSC helped the region fare better than most of Greater Houston.|$|E

5|$|The {{main part}} of the Confrontation is {{generally}} split into three distinct phases. In the first, Indonesia supported revolts against the Anglo-Malaysian rule in Northern Borneo, most notably the Brunei Revolt in December 1962. In the second, the guerrilla raids for which this conflict is most reputed for began in earnest, from April 1963 onwards. The fighting in this phase, while causing some damage and casualties, was relatively small in scale and the incursions were usually only made by small bands of no more than platoon size crossing the Kalimantan border into Sarawak and Sabah. These operations were the essence of the initial strategy to improve the Indonesian negotiating position and continued alongside said negotiations throughout the summer of 1963. However, 16 September, the negotiations concluded with the formation of the Malaysian Federation, which included Malaya, Singapore, and most importantly, the two Borneo states (Sarawak and Sabah). In response, the raids were intensified into larger groups working with or consisting of Indonesian regular troops. This was the beginning of <b>the</b> <b>escalation</b> of the conflict into its third and most dangerous phase.|$|E
5|$|Nationalism in Soviet Georgia gained {{momentum}} in 1989 with {{the weakening of}} the Soviet Union. The Kremlin endorsed South Ossetian nationalism as a counter against the Georgian independence movement. On 11 December 1990, the Supreme Soviet of Georgia, responding to South Ossetia's attempt at secession, abolished the region's autonomy. Georgia declared its restoration of independence on 9 April 1991, thus becoming the first non-Baltic state of the Soviet Union to do so. A military conflict, which had broken out between Georgia and South Ossetia in January 1991, lasted until June 1992. The separatists were aided by the former Soviet military units now under Russian command. By June 1992, {{the possibility of a}} full-scale war between Russia and Georgia increased as bombing of Georgian capital Tbilisi in support of South Ossetian separatists was promised by Russian authorities. In order to prevent <b>the</b> <b>escalation</b> between Russia and Georgia, a ceasefire agreement was signed on 24 June 1992. Georgian, South Ossetian, Russian and North Ossetian peacekeepers were stationed in South Ossetian conflict zone under the Joint Control Commission's (JCC) mandate. Some, mostly ethnically Georgian parts of the former South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast remained under the Georgian control. The Tskhinvali-based separatist authorities of the self-proclaimed Republic of South Ossetia were in control of one third of the territory of the former South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast before the 2008 war.|$|E
