5|$|Michael (Steve Carell) {{is asked}} to visit the Dunder Mifflin {{branches}} to lecture about his success in Scranton. He and Pam (Jenna Fischer), who is coming along as his assistant and driver, plan to visit every branch except Nashua because Michael {{is not ready to}} face his ex-girlfriend Holly, who works there. They first visit the Utica branch, where former Scranton employee Karen (Rashida Jones) is now regional manager. Pam, who is engaged to Karen's ex-boyfriend Jim (John Krasinski), fears the encounter will be awkward. But Karen is now married and pregnant, and the two get along very well – when Pam reveals her and Jim's engagement, Karen even offers genuine congratulations. Michael's lecture in Utica proves to be a disaster when he tries to teach the employees a <b>trick</b> <b>for</b> how to memorize names and ends up insulting everybody. Nevertheless, Pam is ecstatic to have found closure with Karen. Later, on the road, Michael tells Pam that he never found closure with Holly and, at Pam's suggestion, they decide to blow off the other lectures and drive to Nashua to find Holly.|$|E
5|$|On 10 November, Benzema scored {{his second}} {{goal of the}} {{campaign}} against Real Murcia in the 2010–11 edition of the Copa del Rey. In late November, Benzema was inserted into the starting eleven following a severe back injury to Higuaín, along with the team's lack of senior strikers. In his first match since being inserted into the starting lineup permanently, he scored his first Champions League goal {{of the season in}} a group stage fixture against Dutch club Ajax. In Madrid's final group stage tie against French outfit Auxerre, Benzema scored his first hat <b>trick</b> <b>for</b> the club in a 4–0 win. The first goal he scored was Real Madrid's 300th goal in the Champions League era. Two weeks later, Benzema converted another hat trick, this time in an 8–0 thrashing of Levante in the Copa del Rey. In the team's first fixture of the 2011 calendar year, he assisted on the game-winning goal scored by Ronaldo in a 3–2 win over Getafe. In late January, {{for the first time in}} his Real Madrid career, Benzema scored goals in back-to-back matches. On 23 January, he scored the only goal in a 1–0 win at home against Mallorca. Three days later, Benzema repeated his efforts scoring the only goal in a win over Sevilla in the first leg of the team's Copa del Rey semi-final tie. Real Madrid later advanced to its 37th Copa del Rey final in club history after beating Sevilla 2–0 in the second leg.|$|E

25|$|The {{differences}} Partners Spades and Cutthroat bidding {{and play}} are substantial. In Partners, a player would bid a <b>trick</b> <b>for</b> every Ace, King, and Queen {{in a side}} suit (i.e.: non-Spade). In Cutthroat, a player would rarely bid on a King in a long side suit (5+ cards) nor a Queen in any length side suit {{because of the risk}} of their being trumped. This risk is reduced in Partners by the possibility that partner may be out of the long suit and able to discard or to overtrump an opponent.|$|E

25|$|Quicksand: A {{variation}} of penalizing overtricks, a team who exactly makes their contract gets full value. Overtricks subtract 10 points each from that value, and teams {{who do not}} make their contract subtract 10 points for each missed <b>trick.</b> <b>For</b> instance, consider a bid of 7 tricks. If the team made exactly 7 tricks, they would earn the full 70 points. If they only took 5 tricks, they would lose 20 points. If the team made 9 tricks, they would earn the 70 points, −20 points for the two overtricks, resulting in a score of 50 points.|$|E
25|$|The Whitehead torsion is {{important}} in applying surgery theory to non-simply connected manifolds of dimension>4: for simply-connected manifolds, the Whitehead group vanishes, and thus homotopy equivalences and simple homotopy equivalences are the same. The applications are to differentiable manifolds, PL manifolds and topological manifolds. The proofs were first obtained in the early 1960s by Stephen Smale, for differentiable manifolds. The development of handlebody theory allowed much the same proofs in the differentiable and PL categories. The proofs are much harder in the topological category, requiring the theory of Kirby and Siebenmann. The restriction to manifolds of dimension >4 are due to {{the application of the}} Whitney <b>trick</b> <b>for</b> removing double points.|$|E

25|$|In the 1950s and 1960s, {{correction}} fluid made its appearance, under brand {{names such as}} Liquid Paper, Wite-Out and Tipp-Ex; it was invented by Bette Nesmith Graham. Correction fluid {{was a kind of}} opaque, white, fast-drying paint that produced a fresh white surface onto which, when dry, a correction could be retyped. However, when held to the light, the covered-up characters were visible, as was the patch of dry {{correction fluid}} (which was never perfectly flat, and frequently not a perfect match for the color, texture, and luster of the surrounding paper). The standard <b>trick</b> <b>for</b> solving this problem was photocopying the corrected page, but this was possible only with high quality photocopiers.|$|E
25|$|A clown is seen {{walking with}} Graziosa, the gypsy chief's daughter. A gypsy tells {{the chief of}} the {{approach}} of Don Quixote. The chief plans a <b>trick</b> <b>for</b> his benefit and, putting on a mantle crown, sits down as though he were a king on a throne. Don Quixote is deceived and kneels to the chief in homage. The chief bids that he sit beside him and orders a festival to be given in his honor. This begins with Gypsy dances and is followed by a performance of the marionette theatre. Don Quixote is delighted with the entertainment but, mistaking the heroine for his Dulcinea and the marionettes for soldiers attacking her, he rises to assault them. The gypsies are terrified. At this moment the clown and Graziosa run away.|$|E
25|$|A {{prelude to}} the 1943 raids came from the De Havilland Mosquito, which hit the capital on 30 January 1943, the tenth anniversary of the Nazis' Machtergreifung. That same day, both Göring and Goebbels {{were known to be}} giving big speeches that were to be {{broadcast}} live by radio. At precisely 11.00am, Mosquitoes of No. 105 Squadron arrived over Berlin exactly on time to disrupt Göring’s speech. Later that day, No. 139 Squadron repeated the <b>trick</b> <b>for</b> Goebbels. These were great propaganda raids which—much as the Doolittle Raid on the Japanese home islands had done for boosting American morale in April 1942—were a severe embarrassment for the German leadership. 20 April 1943 was Hitler's 54th birthday. Bomber Command decided that they had to mark the occasion with a raid on Berlin, and it was decided that the Mosquito was the right aircraft for the job. Accordingly, No. 105 Squadron was dispatched to the German capital, successfully reaching the city with the loss of only one aircraft.|$|E

25|$|In {{the second}} leg, Lyon decided to {{preserve}} their 5–1 aggregate lead by keeping {{the pace of the}} match slow, as well as holding possession as much as possible in order to keep Anderlecht, who were now playing at home, from getting an early goal. Eventually, this strategy paid off resulting in a goal from Lisandro following a rash mistake from an Anderlecht defender who, upon receiving the ball from the goalkeeper, made a pass directly into the path of the Argentine who rightfully intercepted it and easily chipped the ball over the unexpected goalkeeper to give Lyon a 1–0 lead and effectively end Anderlecht's chances. Six minutes later, Lisandro scored again, this time due to a great cross from Anthony Réveillère, who found the striker wide open inside the penalty box. Minutes before halftime, Lisandro scored his first career hat <b>trick</b> <b>for</b> the club in just his fourth match with them, converting the goal following a turnover from the Anderlecht midfielder Jan Polák. In the second half, Anderlecht converted from the penalty spot in the 51st minute and the 3–1 scoreline eventually remained {{until the end of the}} match. The victory allowed Lyon to advance to the group stages on an aggregate score of 8–2.|$|E
500|$|In 1536, Henry's older brother, Francis, {{caught a}} chill {{after a game}} of tennis, {{contracted}} a fever and died, leaving Henry the heir. As dauphine, Catherine was expected to provide a future heir to the throne. According to the court chronicler Brantôme, [...] "many people advised the king and the Dauphin to repudiate her, since {{it was necessary to}} continue the line of France". Divorce was discussed. In desperation, Catherine tried every known <b>trick</b> <b>for</b> getting pregnant, such as placing cow dung and ground stags' antlers on her [...] "source of life", and drinking mule's urine. On 19 January 1544, she at last gave birth to a son, named after King Francis.|$|E

[...] P.M. Zall writes in [...] "The Gothic Voice of Father Bear" [...] (1974) that [...] "It was no <b>trick</b> <b>for</b> Southey, a consummate technician, to recreate the improvisational tone of an Uncle William through rhythmical reiteration, artful alliteration ('they walked into the woods, while'), even bardic interpolation ('She {{could not have been}} a good, honest Old Woman')". [...] Ultimately, it is uncertain where Southey or his uncle learned the tale.|$|E
500|$|To explain each form, Russell {{provides}} illustrations. The {{power of}} mere force {{is like the}} tying of a rope around a pig's belly and lifting {{it up to a}} ship while ignoring its cries. The power of inducements is likened to two things: either conditioning, as exemplified by circus animals which have been trained to perform this-or-that <b>trick</b> <b>for</b> an audience, or group acquiescence, as when the leader among sheep is dragged along by chains to get the rest of the flock to follow. Finally, the power of propaganda is akin to the use of carrot and stick to influence the behaviour of a donkey, {{in the sense that the}} donkey is being persuaded that making certain actions (following the carrot, avoiding the stick) would be more or less to their benefit.

500|$|The {{assumptions}} {{underlying the}} nativist view {{have also been}} criticised in Jeffrey Elman's Rethinking Innateness: A Connectionist Perspective on Development, which defends the connectionist approach that Pinker attacked. In his 1996 book Impossible Minds, the machine intelligence researcher Igor Aleksander calls The Language Instinct excellent, and argues that Pinker presents a relatively soft claim for innatism, accompanied by a strong dislike of the 'Standard Social Sciences Model' or SSSM (Pinker's term), which supposes that development is purely dependent on culture. Further, Aleksander writes that while Pinker criticises some attempts to explain language processing with neural nets, Pinker later makes use of a neural net to create past tense verb forms correctly. Aleksander concludes that while he doesn't support the SSSM, [...] "a cultural repository of language just seems the easy <b>trick</b> <b>for</b> an efficient evolutionary system armed with an iconic state machine to play." ...|$|E
