The subject area is based on traditional cultural and material knowledge of clay properties: from amphora to rammed earth building; and ranges to present uses: from desiccants and space shuttle tile patterns to bio-ceramics. The primary consideration is to control material density and porosity in a tile component, in response to specific environmental conditions.

The interplay between these properties point to the importance of directionality in the porous microstructure, at the boundary layer. Material characteristics have been investigated in the laboratory at a micron scale and in the ceramics workshop at full scale, with some interplay between the two.

However, this effect {{and its implications for}} mountain altitudinal belts have not been well studied until recently. This paper provides an overview of the research carried out in the past 5 years. MEE is virtually the heating effect of mountain massifs and can be defined as the temperature difference on a given elevation between inside and outside of a mountain mass. It can be digitally modelled with three factors of intra-mountain base elevation (MBE), latitude <b>and</b> <b>hygrometric</b> continentality; MBE usually acts as the primary factor for the magnitude of MEE and, to a great extent, could represent MEE. MEE leads to higher treelines in the interior than in the outside of mountain masses. It makes montane forests to grow at 4800 - 4900 m and snowlines to develop at about 6000 m in the southern Tibetan Plateau and the central Andes, and large areas of forests to live above 3500 m in a lot of high mountains of the world. The altitudinal distribution of global treelines can be modelled with high precision when taking into account MEE and the result shows that MEE contributes the most to treeline distribution pattern. Without MEE, forests could only develop upmost to about 3500 m above sea level and the world ecological pattern would be much simpler. The quantification of MEE should be further improved with higher resolution data and its global implications are to be further revealed...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT- A {{study was}} {{conducted}} at the Embrapa Semi-Árido, Petrolina-PE, Brazil, {{with the aim of}} understanding the mechanism by which the umbu tree (Spondias tuberosa Arr. Cam.) maintains its diurnal internal water balance in dry and wet seasons. The results obtained were based on the measuring of leaf water potential and its components using the pressure chamber <b>and</b> <b>hygrometric</b> chambers / microvoltmeter. Under dry conditions, the lowest values on water potential and osmotic potential were observed around 8 : 00 h, reaching, respectively, – 0. 97 MPa and – 1. 17 MPa, resulting a turgor pressure of 0. 2 MPa. The lowest turgor pressure occurred at 16 : 00 h when 0. 16 MPa was detected but full recovery was not observed {{by the end of the}} light period. During the raining season, however, the lowest water potential was – 1. 55 MPa at 14 : 00 h and- 1. 57 MPa at 14 : 00 h giving a turgor pressure of 0. 02 MPa. Recovery was fast and, by the end of the day, plant water status was similar to the value observed at predawn. These results suggest the umbu tree presents two strategies for maintaining a favorable internal water balance, regarding the environmental situations studied. Under dry conditions the diurnal balance would be maintained at the expenses of water stored in the tubers and by restricted transpiration. During the rainy season, the diurnal water balance may have been mediated by a short term osmotic adjustment as judged by the observed afternoon range between water potential and osmotic potential. Index terms: water potential, osmotic potential, turgor pressure, osmotic adjustment, Spondias tuberosa. ...|$|R

During the rolling process, cell breakage causes the mixing of enzymes with other chemical compounds, and fermentation starts and continues throughout the rolling and roll breaking processes. Further fermentation is allowed to continue on fermenting racks for such time as desirable. Rolling room operation should be geared for ventilating and humidifying to control those fermentation reactions at desired levels. Moisture is an essential requirement for enzyme activity and lack of humidity leads to surface drying of dhools and loosing the liquor properties of tea. During all rolling room processes, a humid atmosphere should surround dhools <b>and</b> <b>hygrometric</b> difference between 2 - 30 F is satisfactory. Humidification also helps in reducing the room temperature up {{to the level of}} ambient wet bulb. Since British introduced tea to Sri Lanka, almost all the factories still use wet and dry bulb hygrometers to observe the level of humidity during rolling and fermenting processes and use manually switchable humidifiers. Tea industry is still very reluctant to give-up wet and dry bulb difference method and move to work with relative humidity. Even Tea Research Institute in Sri Lanka is still using wet and dry bulb difference method. This research automates same art with digital wet and dry bulb sensors and reads level of relative humidity using a digital humidity sensor as an addition. While providing traditional dry-wet (D-W) control mode, the controller also provides humidity control mode for the customers to choose. Displaying relative humidity level at traditional dry-wet mode addresses the knowledge gap of tea makers to move to the direct humidity control mode from traditional wet and dry bulb difference method. The developed humidity control system addresses the lapses of previous products and performs satisfactorily compared to widely used low resolution alcohol wet and dry bulb hygrometers and automatically switches ON or OFF relevant humidifiers to maintain the desired humidity level...|$|R

In 2014, the s/c will rendezvous with the comet 67 P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and place the lander on its surface thereby allowing in situ and remote sensing of the comet nucleus. Two radio experiments, one passive (MIRO [1]) and one active (CONSERT [2]), are aboard the Rosetta s/c. MIRO, composed of two radiometers, with center band frequencies at 190 GHz and at 563 GHz to determine the brightness temperatures of the target surfaces and sub-surfaces, has already observed asteroids (2867) Steins [3] and (21) Lutetia [4]. CONSERT will investigate the deep interior of the nucleus using 90 MHz radio-waves transmitted from the orbiter through the nucleus and returned to the orbiter from the lander. To support interpretations of MIRO and CONSERT observations, a program of dielectric properties measurements is under development on a large range of frequencies encompassing those of the above-mentioned experiments. Several instruments for dielectric constant determination are available at IMS laboratory (Bordeaux, France) : impedance analyzer, coaxial sensor, resonant cavities (measuring respectively at 100 MHz, 0. 5 - 6 GHz, 1. 2 - 13. 4 GHz). Millimeter benches are available at both IMS and LERMA laboratories (measuring respectively at 30 - 110 GHz and 70 - 230 GHz). Taking into account the possible presence of regolith layers on the surface of asteroids or nuclei and the very low density of cometary nuclei [5], the dependence of the dielectric constant on the structure and porosity of given granular materials needs also to be investigated (while the thermal <b>and</b> <b>hygrometric</b> conditions are carefully monitored).

DVS experiments reveal a very low Henry's solubility but the formation of clusters at water activities higher than 40 %. The water diffusivity is almost independent of activity below 50 % HR and decreases rapidly when activity increases above 50 %. Contrary to CTH experiments, equilibrium is reached in DVS and the difference is not simply linked to the well-known effect of sample thickness on diffusion rate. The results allow hypotheses such as hydrolysis or osmotic cracking to explain the abnormal sorption phenomenon to be rejected.

For each strategy, a turbine and an ICU ventilator were used with different FiO(2) settings, {{with and without}} leaks. During CPAP, two different HH and NoH were tested. Inspired gases hygrometry was measured, and comfort was assessed. On a bench, we also assessed the impact of ambient air temperature, ventilator temperature and minute ventilation on HH performances (with NIV settings). RESULTS: During NIV, with NoH, gas humidity was very low when an ICU ventilator was used (5 mgH(2) O/l), but equivalent to ambient air hygrometry with a turbine ventilator at minimal FiO(2) (13 mgH(2) O/l). HME and HH had comparable performances (25 - 30 mgH(2) O/l), but HME's effectiveness was reduced with leaks (15 mgH(2) O/l).

This consists of an air conditioning system with radiant panels, floor heating, cooling system and primary air, in which the benefits seen from an environmental and energy point of view, are fully explained. The conservation of cultural heritage collections in museums, on the one hand implies that the attention of the specialists must turn to the prevention of the natural degradation caused through time and on the other {{to improve the quality of}} the environment. This means environmental parameters must be checked and monitoring techniques used. Since the connective tissue between the museum and its container is the environment, the building-plant system must be held responsible for the “degradation suffered by the museum itself” or “be largely responsible for its optimal conservation with the passing of time”. <br /...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{an application of}} ultra-thin white-topping on a bituminous factory pavement. Different road cement concrete mixes were studied: high-strength concrete, concrete with PP fibres added, concrete modified with latex, concrete made by tyre-rubber grains instead of natural aggregate and steel fibre reinforced concrete. The binder was CEM II/A-L 42. 5 R; super-plasticiser and silica fume {{were added to the}} mix. Mixes were tested by mechanical trials after 1 to 60 days: adhesion of concrete to bituminous surfacings, compressive <b>and</b> flexural strength, <b>hygrometric</b> shrinkage, CTOD/CMOD tests, indirect tensile strength, dynamic elastic modulus. Mechanical characterisation of the mixes suggested the use of cement concrete with PP fibres added (because they reduce incoming cracking), latex (in order to reduce slab fragility) and water-reduction additives (for higher and faster mechanical resistance) and steel fibre reinforced concrete. The application was done on a 20 cm macadam pavement with bituminous wearing course, laid in a factory area pavement. The slabs were constructed according to ACPA standards. Strain gauges and LVDT were inserted in the pavement. The experimental data revealed acceptable behaviour of whitetopping: the slabs appear monolithic and have a good response to static and dynamic stresses due to commercial vehicles...|$|R
40|$|To {{control the}} impact on {{environment}} of the greenhouse activities soilless systems have been used since many years. The culture system on trays seems to have enough flexibility regarding both the method to contain the substrate, both the feeding system for water and nutrient solution. However, the whole water balance is changed: the plant requirements <b>and</b> the internal <b>hygrometric</b> level are one another dependent. The ventilation is primarily projected to control hot temperatures during the day, but nevertheless must control the air-humidity level. An experiment inside an equipped tunnel for pot cultures on trays was set up: soil and substrate were coated with opaque and waterproof plastic films in order to evaluate the plant transpiration. A sample of 6 plants of zucchini (Cucurbita pepo L., var. Afrodite – Sandoz Seeds) was measured every 30 minutes in order to know the variations of the total weight of the plant-substrate system. The environment physical parameters, the ventilation rate, the physiological parameters of the plant, the water supplied and the product removed were recorded. The experimental data collected show a high dependence of the transpiration from the solar radiation: plants characterized by a reduced development {{at the beginning of}} the productive cycle seem to be more correlated...|$|R
40|$|En este trabajo se investigan las peculiaridades del comportamiento elástico de los filamentos de rayón, que difiere grandemente del de las fibras naturales. Es un resumen de una extensa labor de recopilación bibliográfica, de investiga-ción y de ensayo realizada en 1949 por el autor en una fábrica de tejidos de seda y de rayón de Palma de Mallorca de la cual era Director Técnico. Basándose en el {{material}} reunido, el autor pronunció una conferencia sobre este tema en una Velada Técnica organizada por la Asociación Nacional de Ingenieros de Industrias Textiles, el 30 de Mayo de 1949. Un resumen de lo expuesto en ella fue publicado más tarde, en forma de articulo en la revista Ingeniería Textil (nº 80, Noviembre - Diciembre 1949). Se adjunta un ejemplar de la misma. En la época en que se realizó este estudio, aunque ya era corriente en la industria el uso de los distintos tipos de rayón, aún no habían sido bien estudiadas muchas de las propiedades mecánicas de éstos. En particular, la noción de "tiempo" contenida en los conceptos de "alargamiento diferido" y "recuperación diferida" (elasticidad diferida) así como su gran influencia sobre los resultados de las mediciones dinamométricas, constituían una novedad en aquellas fechas. La posterior aparición de las fibras sintéticas y de ciertas materias plásticas, ha si-tuado en primer plano todos estos conceptos que ya habían alcanzado importancia con las fibras artificiales. Los conceptos expresados por el que suscribe en la conferencia y el artículo mencionados, han sido más tarde confirmados y utilizados por otros autores siendo actualmente de uso común. Los métodos estadístico-matemáticos, que habrían resultado muy apropiados para determinar el grado de significación de los ensayos efectuados, no fueron utilizados {{en este estudio}} ya que no eran todavía usuales en nuestro país en la época en que fué rea-lizado. The present {{paper is}} {{a report on the}} peculiarity of elastic behavior in rayon fibers, which differs very much from such behavior in natural fibers. This research is the summary of extensive work on the bibliography, research and experimental work done by the author in 1949 in a silk and rayon fabric manufactory in Palma de Mallorca, where the author was the technical director. Based on this research, the author gave a conference on the subject in a Technical Ses-sion organized by the Asociación Nacional de Ingenieros de Industrias Textiles (Na-tional Association Engineers of Textile Industries, Spain), on 30 May 1949. The con-ference material was published later as an article in the journal "Ingeniería Textil" (Nº 80, November - December 1949). In {{spite of the fact that}} the industry habitually used several types of rayon when this study was originally done, the mechanical properties of these fibers have still not been adequately studied. In particular, the notion of "time" embedded in the concepts of "deferred extension" and "deferred recovery" (deferred elasticity), and their significant influence on the results of dynamometric measures, were novel at that time. The later appearance of synthetic fibers and plastic materials foregrounded these con-cepts, which have remained important in the field of artificial fibers. The concepts ex-amined by the author have lately been confirmed and used by other researchers and are currently in common use. The statistical-mathematical methods that would have been very appropriate for de-termining the signification of the tests done at that early period had not been used in the original study because they were unusual at that time and in our country. This research was motivated by a number of problems and special difficulties that in-volve the manipulation of artificial fibers, mainly rayon. Many phenomena that cause important defects often seem to have no logical explana-tion and frequently induce one to think that the same causes do not always correspond to the same effects. However, that is not true. What in fact is the case is that artificial fibers are recent in industry, and their properties greatly differ from the concepts and norms considered basic and definitive until now. In particular, the concept of "elasticity" is too simple and primitive to explain the var-ied phenomena that take place in artificial fibers submitted to stresses of different kinds. In this article, we propose to enlarge this concept, placing a special emphasis on the relations between elasticity and the factors time <b>and</b> <b>hygrometric</b> state.

40|$|An {{integrated}} approach for {{the characterization of}} bioaerosol was employed in different sites (that include hypogeal and semi-confined areas), characterized by great cultural/artistic interest besides peculiar architectural structures, thermo- <b>hygrometric</b> <b>and</b> lighting parameters. These typologies of indoor environments preserve several artworks like mural paintings, stone-works, paper or parchments that are susceptible of microbial colonization. The presence of fungal spores and low air change can induce both potentially effects to human health (users/operators) or biodegradation of historical-artistic manufacts. We perform bioaerosol sampling by a portable sampler (Sartorius MD 8), equipped with gelatin filters and non-invasive sampling (Nylon membrane or sterile swab) is carried out on works of art surface. Microbial consortia is revealed and characterized by Optical, Scanning Electron and Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (OM, SEM, CLSM), in vitro culture and molecular analysis (PCR, sequencing, sequence analysis). The inter-disciplinary approach applied in this study, represents a valuable contribution for the proper planning of both direct and/or indirect biological growth control and for the conservative restoration procedure (1, 2).

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the elaboration <b>and</b> a thermal, <b>hygrometric</b> <b>and</b> structural study of Layered Double Hydroxides (LDH's) based on [Zn-Cr], [Zn-Al] and [Cu-Cr] main layers intercalating sulphate anions. In the first part, we optimized the procedures allowing to prepare these compounds {{in large quantities}} and in a reproducible way. Two varieties were obtained. The first {{is characterized by a}} basal distance of 11 Å and has a surstructure which makes it an analogue of the mineral shigaite. The second variety, characterized by a basal distance from 8, 9 Å, is obtained by washing the first one with water. By a synthesis carried out under original conditions, we were able to highlight that the sulphate LDH could intercalate the interlayer cations Na+, Li+, Mg 2 +, Ca 2 + and Al 3 +. The study of the interlayer evolution of the prepared phases was undertaken in the second part in an isothermal way; either by setting progressive vacuum which showed an important contraction which corresponds to the removal of interlayer water and is accompanied by a change of stacking sequence, or by control the of water vapour pressure. This study allows to specify the pressures at which the transformation occurs and to establish their reversibility under increasing PH 2 O. The linked gravimetric study is in agreement with the observed structural transformations. In the third part we carried out an isobar study at constant water vapour pressure by modifying the temperature of the sample. These measurements lead us to develop original experimental devices to work under PH 2 O only. This study has shown cycles of dehydration/rehydration with fast kinetics of transformation without deterioration of the crystalline quality. A higher temperatures where the deshydroxylation of the structure reaches notable proportions the transformations becomes irreversible. In the case of the sulphate LDH, these irreversible transformations are accompanied by a strong contraction of the interlayer distance which can only correspond to the grafting of the sulphate anions on the oxy-hydroxylated layers. Cette thèse présente un travail d'élaboration et une étude structurale thermique et hygrométrique de phases Hydroxydes Doubles Lamellaire [Zn-Cr], [Zn-Al] et [Cu-Cr] intercalant des anions sulfate. Dans la première partie, nous avons optimisé les modes opératoires permettant de préparer ces composés en quantités notables et de façon reproductible. Deux variétés ont été obtenues. La première, caractérisée par une distance basale de 11 A° qui en fait un analogue du minéral shigaïte. La seconde variété, caractérisée par une distance basale de 8, 9 A° est obtenue par lavage à l'eau de la précédente. Par une synthèse menée dans des conditions originales, nous avons pu mettre en évidence que les HDL sulfate pouvaient intercaler des cations interlamellaires (Na+, Li+, Mg 2 +, Ca 2 + et Al 3 +).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{carry out}} an in vitro study of Boussignac CPAP valve {{performance}} with a new humidification method, using a heated humidifier. METHODS: Two heated humidifiers were evaluated: Fisher & Paykel MR 850, and Covidien Kendall Aerodyne 2000. Baseline measurements were taken in all experimental conditions without humidification. The Boussignac valve was adapted to the input of the humidification chamber. The system was connected to a test lung to assess the degree of pressurization. <b>Hygrometric</b> <b>and</b> pressure measurements were performed with the fol-lowing gas flows: 10, 20, 30 and 40 L/min. RESULTS: The mean values of pressure generated by the Boussignac valve were 1. 99 0. 02, 6. 97 0. 05, 16. 61 0. 08 and 21. 24 0. 08 cm H 2 O, 10, 20, 30 and 40 L/min, respectively, no differences being detected between study groups. Overall absolute humidity was significantly greater with a heated humidifier than without humidification (range 40. 01 0. 57 – 25. 46 0. 49 compared to 0. 16 0. 13 mgH 2 O/L, P <. 001). Absolute humidity was significantly higher in Kendall Aerodyne 2000 compared to MR 850, regardless of the selected temperature and flow (P <. 001). CONCLUSIONS: This new method of Boussignac CPAP humid-ification yielded humidity values above 25 mg H 2 O/L regardless of the heated humidifier and flow used. Pressurization values remained constant in each experimental situation and were not influ-enced by adding humidification. These data open up {{the possibility of using}} Boussignac CPAP on different types of patients, with different interfaces and for long periods of time.

40|$|Cette {{communication}} a donné lieu à un poster disponible sur demande auprès de l'auteur. This {{has been}} presented on a poster available through a request to the author. <b>Hygrometric</b> <b>and</b> thermic measurements have been recorded to assess the microclimatology of some Guadeloupean caves. The results from Blanchard Cave and Morne Rita Cave, two Pre-columbian archeological sites, are presented here. Recordings have been conducted according to two modes: a short-step one which defines the daily cycle, and a long-term one which documents the annual cycle. Measurements show two distinct patterns: 1. The first cave records temperatures globally warmer than the exterior conditions. But the regime is very unstable due to air currents bringing cold air deep into the cave. The result is a limited hygrometry and a very high sensitivity to daily hygro-thermic variations. Annual data collection reveals fluctuations in the hot air trap system, that we link {{to the influence of}} seasonal cloud covering. 2. The second cave can be considered as a cold air trap. Lack of air currents helps to establish a more stable system, and a more humid air to be maintained in the cavity. Daily fluctuations are strongly weakened. However, seasonnal variations are still recorded. These data open up prospects for further understanding of physical processes occurring in these sites. Thus, air flows that have been highlighted in the first site can explain the presence of evaporitic minerals in the ancient deposits by seaspray transported into the cave with cold air flows. Highlighting this supply also support the assumption that salt fretting contributes heavily to wall desegregation. A 0. 6 cm/century weathering rate is thus estimated from sedimentation age model. Such a rate would explain the total lack of engravings in this kind of cave. Conversely, the stable system in Morne Rita cave would have favored the preservation of the Pre-columbian art...|$|R
