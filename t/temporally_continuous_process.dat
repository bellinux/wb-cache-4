40|$|Equatorial {{magnetosonic waves}} are {{normally}} observed as <b>temporally</b> <b>continuous</b> sets of emissions lasting from minutes to hours. Recent observations, however, {{have shown that}} this is not always the case. Using Cluster data, this study identifies two distinct forms of these non <b>temporally</b> <b>continuous</b> use missions. The first, referred to as rising tone emissions, are characterized by the systematic onset of wave activity at increasing proton gyroharmonic frequencies. Sets of harmonic emissions (emission elements) are observed to occur periodically in the region +/- 10 off the geomagnetic equator. The sweep rate of these emissions maximizes at the geomagnetic equator. In addition, the ellipticity and propagation direction also change systematically as Cluster crosses the geomagnetic equator. It is shown that the observed frequency sweep rate is unlikely to result from the sideband instability related to nonlinear trapping of suprathermal protons in the wave field. The second form of emissions is characterized by the simultaneous onset of activity across a range of harmonic frequencies. These waves are observed at irregular intervals. Their occurrence correlates with changes in the spacecraft potential, a measurement that is used as a proxy for electron density. Thus, these waves appear to be trapped within regions of localized enhancement of the electron density...|$|R

40|$|As {{opposed to}} the petro-{{chemical}} and bulk chemical industry, where <b>continuous</b> <b>processes</b> are widely applied, the pharmaceutical industry still primarily relies on traditional batch process due {{to the complexity of}} product, multi-step operation and low-volume production. Considering these conditions, the versatile batch process is more appropriate. Nowadays, driven by the contradiction between increasing demand for drugs and inefficient batch production mode, there is a trend in pharmaceutical industry, that is the transformation from traditional batch <b>process</b> to novel <b>continuous</b> <b>process.</b> Related projects and research that is aimed at analyzing this transition are conducted in worldwide, and the scale of these studies ranges from lab-scale reactions to overall arrangement of the factories. Although <b>continuous</b> pharmaceutical <b>process</b> is thriving, the safety issue in this field is not promoted at the same time. Since the <b>continuous</b> pharmaceutical <b>process</b> is a novel technology, little information can be provided to evaluate its safety level.

In recent years, sequential assimilation methods have been increasingly used to retrieve LAI from time series remote-sensing data. However, the inherent characteristics of these sequential assimilation methods result in temporal discontinuities in the retrieved LAI profiles. In this study, a sequential assimilation method with incremental analysis update (IAU) was developed to jointly update model states and parameters and to retrieve <b>temporally</b> <b>continuous</b> LAI profiles from time series Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) reflectance data. Based on the existing multi-year Global Land Surface Satellite (GLASS) LAI product, a dynamic model was constructed to evolve LAI anomalies over time. The sequential assimilation method with an IAU technique {{takes advantage of the}} Kalman filter (KF) technique to update model parameters, uses the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) technique to update LAI anomalies recursively from time series MODIS reflectance data and then calculates the <b>temporally</b> <b>continuous</b> LAI values by combining the LAI climatology data. The method was tested over eight Committee on Earth Observing Satellites-Benchmark Land Multisite Analysis and Intercomparison of Products (CEOS-BELMANIP) sites with different vegetation types. The results indicate that the sequential method with IAU can precisely reconstruct the seasonal variation patterns of LAI and that the LAI profiles derived from the sequential method with IAU are smooth and continuous...|$|R
