5|$|The {{earliest}} recorded {{flags in}} Japan {{date from the}} unification period in the late 16th century. <b>The</b> <b>flags</b> belonged to each daimyō and were used primarily in battle.

Generals also had their own flags, most of which differed from soldiers' flags due to their square shape.|$|E
