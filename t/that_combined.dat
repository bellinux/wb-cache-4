5|$|Additional nine-foot rangefinders, {{protected}} by armoured hoods, were added for each gun turret in late 1914.

Once established as a serious and reputable maker, Emerson was soon able to concentrate on making the knives he wanted to make—knives designed for use as opposed to show, specifically folding-knives designed for combat.|$|E
5|$|A second form of neuroacanthocytosis, Levine-Critchley syndrome, was {{discovered}} by the American internist Irvine M. Levine in 1960 and reported in Neurology in 1964, and again in 1968. Subsequently, similar symptoms were identified and described by the British neurologist MacDonald Critchley in 1968. In both cases, the physicians described a hereditary syndrome <b>that</b> <b>combined</b> acanthocytosis with neurological peculiarities but normal serum lipoprotein. Specific symptoms included tics, grimacing, movement disorders, difficulty swallowing, poor coordination, hyporeflexia, chorea, and seizures. Patients often mutilated their tongues, lips, and cheeks. The diseases appeared in both sexes, and were usually diagnosed in infancy.|$|E

5|$|A {{secondary}} rhetorical battle began between Walpole and the Irish {{in regard}} to Wood's patent; {{the rest of the}} constitutional debate was over the nature of Poynings' Law, a law that was brought back into use through the Declaratory Act (1720). Poyning's Law was a law that the British claimed allowed them to control all of Ireland's legal actions and to revoke the Irish parliamentary independence. Traditionally, the rulers of Ireland viewed themselves as a kingdom and not a colony that would be controlled by Poyning's Law. The Drapier agreed with the Irish interpretation of the law and incorporated aspects of Molyneux's arguments <b>that</b> <b>combined</b> proof the law was misinterpreted and Locke's political philosophy.|$|E
5|$|A {{technique}} was developed <b>that</b> <b>combined</b> the front projection effect with specially designed zoom lenses. The illusion of movement {{was created by}} zooming in on Reeve while making the front projected image appear to recede. For scenes where Superman interacts with other people or objects while in flight, Reeve and actors were put {{in a variety of}} rigging equipment with careful lighting and photography. This also {{led to the creation of}} the Zoptic system.|$|E
5|$|According to Atlury Murali, Indian Congress in the 1920s {{appealed to}} Andhra Pradesh peasants by {{creating}} Telugu language plays <b>that</b> <b>combined</b> Indian mythology and legends, linked them to Gandhi's ideas, and portrayed Gandhi as a messiah, a reincarnation of ancient and medieval Indian nationalist leaders and saints. The plays built support among peasants steeped in traditional Hindu culture, according to Murali, and this effort made Gandhi a folk hero in Telugu speaking villages, a sacred messiah-like figure.|$|E

5|$|Adding {{liothyronine}} (synthetic T3) to levothyroxine {{has been}} suggested as a measure to provide better symptom control, but {{this has not been}} confirmed by studies. In 2007, the British Thyroid Association stated <b>that</b> <b>combined</b> T4 and T3 therapy carried a higher rate of side effects and no benefit over T4 alone. Similarly, American guidelines discourage combination therapy {{due to a lack of}} evidence, although they acknowledge that some people feel better when receiving combination treatment. Treatment with liothyronine alone has not received enough study to make a recommendation as to its use; due to its shorter half-life it needs to be taken more often.|$|E
5|$|Another {{development}} was the Dreyer Fire-control Table <b>that</b> <b>combined</b> {{the functions of}} the Dumaresq and the range clock in the transmission stations. Hercules was probably fitted with a prototype table when its inventor, Commander Frederic Dreyer, was assigned to the ship at the end of 1911. The ship retained that instrument at least until February 1916, although it had been replaced by a Mark I table by 1918. Colossus received her Mark I table by early 1916.|$|E
5|$|At times Shelley {{had trouble}} finding {{sufficient}} research materials {{and had to}} make do with fewer resources than she would have liked, particularly for the Spanish and Portuguese Lives. She wrote in a style <b>that</b> <b>combined</b> secondary sources, memoir, anecdote, and her own opinions. Her political views are most obvious in the Italian Lives, where she supports the Italian independence movement and promotes republicanism; in the French Lives she portrays women sympathetically, explaining their political and social restrictions and arguing that women can be productive members of society if given the proper educational and social opportunities.|$|E

5|$|Coffin {{took the}} full range of {{architectural}} courses including studying engineering, physics, maths, mechanical drafting and freehand drawing in addition to architectural and landscape design. She also studied botany and horticulture under Charles Sprague Sargent at the Arnold Arboretum. One of her formative influences at MIT was Guy Lowell, the director of the landscape design program there, who was an advocate of the classical values of balance, order, proportion and harmony taught by the French Ecole des Beaux-Arts. Lowell was best known for his book American Gardens, published in 1902, which influenced many landscape architects to adopt his principles to design symmetrical, axial gardens <b>that</b> <b>combined</b> architectural features with classical garden ornaments with vegetation, following the tradition of Italian villas.|$|E
5|$|Cole was an Australian Institute of Sport Scholarship holder. Her coach, Graeme Carroll, trained her in Canberra in {{preparation}} for the 2012 London Paralympics with an approach <b>that</b> <b>combined</b> swim training with aerobics and gym work. She trained with Teigan Van Roosmalen, a blind and deaf S13 swimmer. Cole also mentors young athletes. When not in high school Cole was undertaking ten or more swimming sessions a week but, while at school, she reduced her load. As of 2015, her coach is Nathan Doyle.|$|E
5|$|Development of The Blair Witch Project {{began in}} 1993. While film {{students}} at the University of Central Florida, Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez came across {{the idea for the}} film after realizing that they found documentaries on paranormal phenomena scarier than traditional horror films. The two decided to create a film <b>that</b> <b>combined</b> the styles of both. After graduation, Myrick and Sánchez, along with Gregg Hale, Robin Cowie, and Michael Monello started the production company Haxan Films, derived from Benjamin Christensen's 1922 Swedish-Danish silent documentary horror film Häxan, whose English-language title is Witchcraft Through the Ages.|$|E

5|$|Economists {{incorporated}} the theoretical {{work from the}} synthesis into large-scale macroeconometric models <b>that</b> <b>combined</b> individual equations for factors such as consumption, investment, and money demand with empirically observed data. This line of research reached its height with the MIT-Penn-Social Science Research Council (MPS) model developed by Modigliani and his collaborators. MPS combined IS/LM with {{other aspects of the}} synthesis including the neoclassical growth model and the Phillips curve relation between inflation and output. Both large-scale models and the Phillips curve became targets for critics of the synthesis.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{tried to}} {{maintain}} a sophisticated household <b>that</b> <b>combined</b> hunting and drinking with cosmopolitan literary discussion and courtly values. Nonetheless, Henry's passion was for hunting, for which the court became famous. Henry {{had a number of}} preferred royal hunting lodges and apartments across his lands, and invested heavily in his royal castles, both for their practical utility as fortresses, and as symbols of royal power and prestige. The court was relatively formal in its style and language, possibly because Henry was attempting to compensate for his own sudden rise to power and relatively humble origins as the son of a count. He opposed the holding of tournaments, probably because of the security risk that such gatherings of armed knights posed in peacetime.|$|E
5|$|Imperator Nikolai I {{had four}} Curtiss-AEG main and two {{auxiliary}} turbo generators with each driving two dynamos, one each {{for alternating current}} and direct current. Each main generator was rated at 360 kilowatts while the auxiliaries had a capacity of 200 kilowatts each. These powered the complex electrical system <b>that</b> <b>combined</b> alternating current for most equipment with direct current for heavy-load machinery like the turret motors. No diesel generators were provided.|$|E
