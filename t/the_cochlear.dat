5|$|As <b>the</b> <b>cochlear</b> duct’s mesenchyme {{begins to}} differentiate, three {{cavities}} are formed: the scala vestibuli, the scala tympani and the scala media. Both the scala vestibuli and the scala tympani contain an extracellular fluid called perilymph. The scala media contains endolymph. A set of membranes called the vestibular membrane and the basilar membrane develop to separate <b>the</b> <b>cochlear</b> duct from the vestibular duct and the tympanic duct, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Around the 33rd day of development, the vesicles {{begin to}} {{differentiate}}. Closer {{to the back}} of the embryo, they form what will become the utricle and semicircular canals. Closer to the front of the embryo, the vesicles differentiate into a rudimentary saccule, which will eventually become the saccule and cochlea. Part of the saccule will eventually give rise and connect to <b>the</b> <b>cochlear</b> duct. This duct appears approximately during the sixth week and connects to the saccule through the ductus reuniens.|$|E
5|$|Hearing {{and balance}} are both {{generated}} in the inner ear. The movement of liquids within the inner ear is generated by motion (for balance) and transmitted vibrations generated by the ossicles (for sound). This creates a nerve signal that passes through the vestibulocochlear nerve. From here, it passes through to <b>the</b> <b>cochlear</b> nuclei, the superior olivary nucleus, the medial geniculate nucleus, and finally the auditory radiation to the auditory cortex.|$|E
40|$|Considerable circumstantial {{evidence}} suggests that cells in <b>the</b> ventral <b>cochlear</b> nucleus, that respond predominantly to the onset of pure tone bursts, have a stellate morphology and project, among other places, to <b>the</b> dorsal <b>cochlear</b> nucleus. <b>The</b> characteristics of such cells make them leading candidates for providing the so-called “wideband inhibitory input” which {{is an essential part}} of the processing machinery of <b>the</b> dorsal <b>cochlear</b> nucleus. Here we use juxtacellular labeling with biocytin to demonstrate directly that large stellate cells, with onset responses, terminate profusely in <b>the</b> dorsal <b>cochlear</b> nucleus. They also provide widespread local innervation of <b>the</b> anteroventral <b>cochlear</b> nucleus and a small innervation of <b>the</b> posteroventral <b>cochlear</b> nucleus. In addition, some onset cells project to <b>the</b> contralateral dorsal <b>cochlear</b> nucleus...|$|R

5|$|The {{vestibulocochlear nerve}} (VIII) splits into the {{vestibular}} and cochlear nerve. The vestibular part {{is responsible for}} innervating the vestibules and semicircular canal of the inner ear; this structure transmits information about balance, and {{is an important component}} of the vestibuloocular reflex, which keeps the head stable and allows the eyes to track moving objects. <b>The</b> <b>cochlear</b> nerve transmits information from the cochlea, allowing sound to be heard.|$|E
5|$|The bony {{labyrinth}} {{refers to}} the bony compartment which contains the membranous labyrinth, contained within the temporal bone. The inner ear structurally begins at the oval window, which receives vibrations from the incus of the middle ear. Vibrations are transmitted into the inner ear into a fluid called endolymph, which fills the membranous labyrinth. The endolymph is situated in two vestibules, the utricle and saccule, and eventually transmits to the cochlea, a spiral-shaped structure. The cochlea consists of three fluid-filled spaces: the vestibular duct, <b>the</b> <b>cochlear</b> duct, and the tympanic duct. Hair cells responsible for transduction—changing mechanical changes into electrical stimuli {{are present in the}} organ of Corti in the cochlea.|$|E
5|$|The {{porpoise}} ear has specific {{adaptations to}} the marine environment. In humans, {{the middle ear}} works as an impedance equaliser between the outside air's low impedance and <b>the</b> <b>cochlear</b> fluid's high impedance. In whales, and other marine mammals, there is no great difference between the outer and inner environments. Instead of sound passing through the outer ear to the middle ear, porpoises receive sound through the throat, from which it passes through a low-impedance fat-filled cavity to the inner ear. The porpoise ear is acoustically isolated from the skull by air-filled sinus pockets, which allow for greater directional hearing underwater. Odontocetes send out high frequency clicks from an organ known as a melon. This melon consists of fat, and the skull of any such creature containing a melon will have a large depression. The large bulge {{on top of the}} porpoises head is caused by the melon.|$|E

5|$|The ears {{of river}} {{dolphins}} have specific adaptations to their aquatic environment. In humans, {{the middle ear}} works as an impedance equalizer between the outside air's low impedance and <b>the</b> <b>cochlear</b> fluid's high impedance. In river dolphins, and other cetaceans, there is no great difference between the outer and inner environments. Instead of sound passing through the outer ear to the middle ear, river dolphins receive sound through the throat, from which it passes through a low-impedance fat-filled cavity to the inner ear. The ear is acoustically isolated from the skull by air-filled sinus pockets, which allows for greater directional hearing underwater. Dolphins send out high frequency clicks from an organ known as a melon. This melon consists of fat, and the skull of any such creature containing a melon will have a large depression. This allows river dolphins to produce biosonar for orientation. They are so dependent on echolocation that they can survive {{even if they are}} blind. Beyond locating an object, echolocation also provides the animal with an idea on the object's shape and size, though how exactly this works is not yet understood. The small hairs on the rostrum of the Amazon river dolphin are believed to function as a tactile sense, possibly to compensate for their poor eyesight.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in {{the fifth}} week of development, the {{auditory}} vesicle also gives rise to <b>the</b> <b>cochlear</b> duct, which contains the spiral organ of Corti and the endolymph that accumulates in the membranous labyrinth.

25|$|The nucleus geniculatus {{medialis}} receives axons from auditory axons. From the cochlea, peripheral auditory information goes to <b>the</b> <b>cochlear</b> nucleus. From there, through <b>the</b> <b>cochlear</b> nerve, axons {{reach the}} superior olivary complex of both sides. Axons from there constitute the lateral lemniscus which {{ends in the}} inferior colliculus. Axons from the inferior colliculus constitute the brachium of the inferior colliculus and end in the medial geniculate. The thalamocortical axons from the medial geniculate nucleus end in the primary auditory cortex located {{in the center of}} the superior temporal plane. See auditory system.|$|E

25|$|Auditory canal {{decompression}} {{is another}} surgical technique that can prolong usable hearing when a vestibular schwannoma has grown {{too large to}} remove without damage to <b>the</b> <b>cochlear</b> nerve. In the IAC (internal auditory canal) decompression, a middle fossa approach is employed to expose the bony roof of the IAC without any attempt to remove the tumor. The bone overlying the acoustic nerve is removed, allowing the tumour to expand upward into the middle cranial fossa. In this way, pressure on <b>the</b> <b>cochlear</b> nerve is relieved, {{reducing the risk of}} further hearing loss from direct compression or obstruction of vascular supply to the nerve.|$|E

50|$|LSO neurons {{are excited}} by inputs from one ear and {{inhibited}} by inputs from the other, {{and are therefore}} referred to as IE neurons. Excitatory inputs are received at the LSO from spherical bushy cells of <b>the</b> ipsilateral <b>cochlear</b> nucleus, which combine inputs coming from several auditory nerve fibers. Inhibitory inputs are received at the LSO from globular bushy cells of <b>the</b> contralateral <b>cochlear</b> nucleus.|$|R

25|$|Cochlear {{implants}} bypass most of {{the peripheral}} auditory system which receives sound and converts that sound into movements of hair cells in the cochlea; the inside-portion of these hair cells release potassium ions {{in response to the}} movement of the hairs, and the potassium in turn stimulates other cells to release the neurotransmitter, glutamate, which makes <b>the</b> <b>cochlear</b> nerve send signals to the brain, which creates the experience of sound. Instead, the devices pick up sound and digitize it, convert that digitized sound into electrical signals, and transmit those signals to electrodes embedded in the cochlea. The electrodes electrically stimulate <b>the</b> <b>cochlear</b> nerve, causing it to send signals to the brain.|$|E
25|$|The braincase of Protoavis {{is similar}} in some respects to Troodon, with an {{enlarged}} cerebellum that shifted the optic lobes ventrolaterally, and also has a large floccular lobe. The inner ear is also pretty similar and bird-like in both taxa. The canalicular systems and <b>the</b> <b>cochlear</b> process differ in both taxa, and the vestibular region is relatively small and located in a ventral position {{to most of the}} anterior and posterior semicircular canals. The anterior semicircular canal is significantly longer than the others, and <b>the</b> <b>cochlear</b> process is a relatively long, vertically oriented tube. However, Protoavis is also remarkedly non-bird like in that it possess only a single exit for the trigeminal. However, these characters are not robust enough to identify Protoavis as a bird.|$|E
25|$|The human {{inner ear}} {{develops}} during week 4 of embryonic development from the auditory placode, a thickening of the ectoderm which {{gives rise to}} the bipolar neurons of <b>the</b> <b>cochlear</b> and vestibular ganglions.

50|$|The {{superior}} olivary {{complex is}} located in the pons, and receives projections predominantly from <b>the</b> ventral <b>cochlear</b> nucleus, although <b>the</b> dorsal <b>cochlear</b> nucleus projects there as well, via the ventral acoustic stria. Within the superior olivary complex lies the lateral superior olive (LSO) and the medial superior olive (MSO). The former is important in detecting interaural level differences while the latter is important in distinguishing interaural time difference.|$|R

25|$|The {{function}} of the lateral lemniscus is not known; however it has good temporal resolution compared to other cells higher than <b>the</b> <b>cochlear</b> nuclei and is sensitive to both timing and amplitude changes in sound. It is also involved in the acoustic startle reflex; the most likely region for this being the VNLL.|$|E
25|$|The lateral lemniscus is a {{tract of}} axons in the {{brainstem}} that carries information about sound from <b>the</b> <b>cochlear</b> nucleus to various brainstem nuclei {{and ultimately the}} contralateral inferior colliculus of the midbrain. Three distinct, primarily inhibitory, cellular groups are located interspersed within these fibers, and are thus named the nuclei of the lateral lemniscus.|$|E
25|$|The {{lengthwise}} partition {{that divides}} {{most of the}} cochlea is itself a fluid-filled tube, the third duct. This central column is called <b>the</b> <b>cochlear</b> duct.
