40|$|This {{study is}} an attempt to {{evaluate}} the procedure employed in the adoption of children in Kentucky since the enactment of the new adoption law in June, 1940, which made mandatory a social investigation during the sixty-day period required between the date of the filing of the petition and the date of the court hearing. It aims (1) to examine the operations of the Kentucky law in the area of Jefferson County tor which the records were made available by the State Department of Welfare, Child Welfare Division, Frankfort, Kentucky, and (2) to measure the local procedure by the standard of the best available knowledge and practice. In the process of examination and measurement of local procedure, it is well to bear in mind that (1) many of the adoptions studied were begun a number of years ago, without benefit of specialized adoptive-placing techniques, (2) the adoption law requiring social investigation is new and (3) the machinery set up tor its administration has not been in operation long enough <b>tor</b> <b>us</b> to evaluate its program of interpretation to the community.

50|$|Esslemont and Erikson co-created the Malazan {{world in}} 1982 as a {{backdrop}} for role-playing games. In 1991 they collaborated on a feature film script set in the same world, entitled Gardens of the Moon. When the script did not sell, Erikson greatly expanded the story {{and turned it into}} a novel. The two writers agreed to both write books set in the same world. However, it took a further eight years before Gardens of the Moon was published by Bantam UK and Erikson agreed to write a further nine novels set in the same world. Life and work commitments delayed Esslemont's own entries to the series until 2004, when his first novel, Night of Knives, was published as a limited edition by PS Publishing (a mass-market release by Bantam UK followed in 2007). This book was a prequel to the main Malazan sequence. His second novel, Return of the Crimson Guard, takes place within the main Malazan sequence, shortly after the events of the sixth book, The Bonehunters. It was published by PS Publishing in May 2008 and by Bantam UK later that year. Both Night of Knives and Return of the Crimson Guard have now been bought by Tor for publication in the United States. His third novel, Stonewielder, was published by Bantam UK in 2010 and <b>Tor</b> in the <b>US.</b> His fourth novel, Orb, Sceptre, Throne was published in 2012. In spring 2014 he signed a contract with Bantam for three more novels set in the Malazan world.|$|R
40|$|Tor is a {{very popular}} anonymisation {{software}} and network. For which we created Torminator, a fingerprinting suite written in the Java programming language. Fingerprinting is an attack type applicable to Tor utilising side-channel information from the network packets. With side-channel data, we can analytically access information that purportedly been hidden by design by Tor. Because Tor is a low-latency, low-overhead by design, it will leak communication patterns with intermediate (thus total) communication size. In our case this may able us figure out to which site/service the Tor user is using. This means that anyone with access to user’s traffic can use the fingerprinting attack to partly compromise the provided anonymity. By investigating such attacks, it may help us to better understand how to withstand and resist attacks from powerful adversaries such as state agencies. Torminator automatises the process for gathering fingerprints. It uses the official Tor Browser through its GUI to enter websites to recreate the real world scenario. This gives us real and reliable fingerprints without having to employ a human to do anything, as Torminator simulates user interaction on <b>Tor</b> Browser for <b>us.</b> We can also give Torminator a list of websites to fingerprint, {{making it easy to}} generate lots of fingerprints for a great number given sites. A contribution of Torminator, is that we improved on the previous de facto standard of the fingerprints collected from the available tools from previous works. We have gathered fingerprints and have now a dataset of 65792 fingerprints. Fingerprints like these can be used with machine learning techniques to teach a machine to recognise web-pages by reading the packet size and directions saved in the fingerprint files...|$|R
40|$|Fashion and Apparel (F&A) market, {{characterized}} by fast changes in trends and demand, by short product life-cycles and by broad assortments, requires a responsive/demand driven Supply Chain (SC) focused on products availability, real- time information sharing and speed in matching customers requests (Iannone et al. 2013). In this context, the presented paper shows {{the results of}} a three-year research project by firstly analysing the overall structure and characteristics of a traditional SC in this sector Iannone et al. (2015) in order to identify the most critical aspects and processes. From a risk analysis it emerged that the correct Time Management, intended as the ability of being responsive to market fluctuation, is the most criti- cal target for fashion business. In this context, the presented work proposes a refer- ence framework for the definition and subsequent optimisation of the physical and informative flows, which is based on a deviation analysis of demand and an adjust- ing feedback loop. In last years, the wide spread of e-commerce and mobile pur- chasing is deeply changing the retailing industry leading companied to adopt a new integrated strategy, called Omni-Channel Retailing. The management of both phys- ical and mobile channels not simply means managing an additional on-line demand but requires the actual integration of all the processes of planning and execution in order to optimize performances. With these perspectives, the proposed framework has been revised and extended in order to represent a company implementing this new strategy and, after the definition of a suitable set of Key Performance Indica <b>tors</b> (KPIs), allowed <b>us</b> to evaluate how it may impact on the performances of a traditional SC. The integration of all these analysis and the correct evaluation of the defined set of KPIs may represent a useful system for supporting fashion companies in the strategic decision making process...|$|R
