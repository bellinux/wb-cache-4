40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Prodromal Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has {{recently}} {{been identified as a}} disease state where pathophysiological changes may progress despite the absence of significant clinical symptoms. Yet, the specific processes of neural dysfunction occurring during this preclinical phase remain unclear. Resting state fMRI (RS-fMRI) in combination with brain connectomic measurements may be able to provide ways to measure subtle connectivity changes in different neurological disease states. For instance, RS-fMRI scans allow us <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>functionally</b> connected yet spatially distinct brain regions that can then be separated into resting-state networks (RSNs). More recently, the exploration of RSNs in disease states have proved promising since they have been reliably altered when compared to a control population.

40|$|MscL is a mechanosensitive {{channel in}} {{bacteria}} that responds directly to membrane tension by opening a large conductance pore. <b>To</b> <b>determine</b> <b>functionally</b> important residues within this molecule, we have randomly mutagenized mscL, expressed the genes in living bacteria, and screened for gain-of-function mutants with hampered growth.

In excised patches, the mutant channels gated at membrane tensions that are less than that required for the gating of the wild-type MscL. Hence, the {{data suggest that the}} slowed or no-growth phenotype is caused by solute loss because of inappropriate gating of the channel. Most of the mutations mapped to the first transmembrane domain. When this domain is modeled as an α-helix, the most severe mutations are substitutions of smaller amino acids (three glycines and one valine) on one facet, suggesting an important role for this structure in MS channel gating...|$|E

The method provides an intuitively simple approach to clustering and makes no assumptions {{of the number of}} clusters in the data or their underlying distribution. The performance of the method and its dependence on the intrinsic parameters (size of the neighborhood, form of the interaction term, etc.) is investigated on the simulated data and real fMRI data acquired during a conventional periodic finger tapping task. The merits of incorporating Euclidean information into the connectivity analysis are discussed. The ability of the Potts model clustering to uncover the hidden structure in the complex data is demonstrated through its application to the resting-state data to determine functional connectivity networks of the anterior and posterior cingulate cortices for the group of nine healthy male subjects.

40|$|It {{is often}} {{difficult}} to determine which of the sequence and structural differences between divergent members of multigene families are functionally important. Here we use a laboratory evolution approach <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>functionally</b> important structural differences between two distantly related disulfide isomerases, DsbC and DsbG from Escherichia coli. Surprisingly, we found single amino acid substitutions in DsbG that were able to complement dsbC in vivo and have more DsbC-like isomerase activity in vitro. Crystal structures of the three strongest point mutants, DsbG K 113 E, DsbG V 216 M, and DsbG T 200 M, reveal changes in highly surface-exposed regions that cause DsbG to more closely resemble the distantly related DsbC. In this case, laboratory evolution appears to have taken a direct route to allow one protein family member to complement another, with single substitutions apparently bypassing much of the need for multiple changes that took place over ≈ 0. 5 billion years of evolution.

Limited data available suggests that non-symbiotic haemoglobins are involved in hypoxic stress and oversupply of nutrients.

Evolutionary trace analysis has identified candidate functional (trace) residues that uniquely characterize the heme-binding pocket, dimer interface and possible novel functional surfaces.

Due {{to the absence of}} infectious clones of noroviruses and the high sequence variability in their capsids, it has not been possible to identify functionally important residues in these capsids.

40|$|AbstractThe fibrous {{shape and}} biopersistence of {{multi-walled}} carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) have raised concern over their potential toxicity after pulmonary exposure. As in vivo exposure to MWCNT produced a transient inflammatory and progressive fibrotic response, this {{study sought to}} identify significant biological processes associated with lung inflammation and fibrosis pathology data, based upon whole genome mRNA expression, bronchoaveolar lavage scores, and morphometric analysis from C 57 BL/ 6 J mice exposed by pharyngeal aspiration to 0, 10, 20, 40, or 80 μg MWCNT at 1, 7, 28, or 56 days post-exposure. Using a novel computational model employing non-negative matrix factorization and Monte Carlo Markov Chain simulation, significant biological processes with expression similar to MWCNT-induced lung inflammation and fibrosis pathology data in mice were identified. A subset of genes in these processes was <b>determined</b> <b>to</b> be <b>functionally</b> related to either fibrosis or inflammation by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and was used <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> potential significant signaling cascades.

This paper describes the approach we developed that combines sequence decomposition techniques with distance geometry algorithms for homology modeling <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>functionally</b> important regions of proteins. We show here the application of these techniques to targets of medical interest chosen from those included in the CASP 5 (Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction) competition, including the dihydroneopterin aldolase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, RNase III of Thermobacteria maritima, and the NO-transporter nitrophorin from saliva of the bedbug Cimex lectularius. Physical chemical property (PCP) motifs, identified in aligned sequences with our MASIA program, {{can be used to}} select among different alignments returned by fold recognition servers. They {{can also be used to}} suggest functions for hypothetical proteins, as we illustrate for target T 188. Once a suitable alignment has been made with the template, our modeling suite MPACK generates a series of possible models. The models can then be selected according to their match in areas known to be conserved in protein families. Alignments based on motifs can improve the structural matching of residues in the active site. The quality of the local structure of our 3 D models near active sites or epitopes makes them useful aids for drug and vaccine design. Further, the PCP motif approach, when combined with a structural filter, can be a potent way to detect areas involved in activity and to suggest function for novel genome sequences...|$|E
40|$|All protein {{sequences}} from 19 complete chloroplast genomes (cpDNA) {{have been}} studied using a new computational method able to analyze functional correlations among series of protein sequences contained in complete proteomes. First, all open reading frames (ORFs) from the cpDNAs, comprising a total of 2266 protein sequences, were compared against the 3168 proteins from Synechocystis PCC 6803 complete genome to find functionally related orthologous proteins. Additionally, all cpDNA genomes were pairwise compared to find orthologous groups not present in cyanobacteria. Annotations in the cluster of othologous proteins database and CyanoBase were used as reference for the functional assignments. Following this protocol, new functional assignments were made for ORFs of unknown function and for ycfs (hypothetical chloroplast frames), which still lack a functional assignment. Using this information, a matrix of functional relationships was derived from profiles of the presence and/or absence of orthologous proteins; the matrix included 1837 proteins in 277 orthologous clusters. A factor analysis study of this matrix, followed by cluster analysis, allowed us to obtain accurate phylogenetic reconstructions and the detection of genes probably involved in speciation as phylogenetic correlates.

40|$|The Testis Specific Serine Kinases (Tssks) are {{a family}} of {{proteins}} that show testis and sperm-specific expression. Members of this family are most conserved among mammals, however there are homologs in vertebrates like birds and amphibians, chordates, and other invertebrates like insects and cnidarians. This specific expression suggests that these kinases are highly regulated. Analysis of murine and human Tssk 1, Tssk 2, and Tssk 6 sequences show that these genes are comprised of one exon each, suggesting they are retrotransposons. The expression of these genes shows their importance, since many retrotransposons are silenced due to the foreign nature of the DNA, and knock-out mouse models have shown that these kinases are required for fertility. Understanding the properties of these kinases not only expands our scientific knowledge, but also lends itself to understanding fertility issues in men {{as well as being}} a contraceptive target. We looked at an epigenetic regulation factor, DNA methylation at CpG dinucleotides, to see if this caused the testis-specific gene expression we saw. Tssk 2 and preliminary results from Tssk 1 showed that there is no differential methylation at CpG dinucleotides or between tissues. Preliminary results for Tssk 6 did show one site that may be differentially methylated, thus the tissue specific expression.

This is accomplished by a customized strategy that combines mass spectrometric analyses of protein modifications with subsequent mutational studies. When applied to the B cell receptor (BCR) -proximal effector SLP- 65, this approach uncovered a differential and highly dynamic engagement of numerous newly identified phospho-acceptor sites. Some of them serve as kinase substrates in resting cells and undergo rapid dephosphorylation upon BCR ligation. Stimulationinduced phosphorylation of SLP- 65 can be early and transient, or early and sustained, or late. Functional elucidation of conspicuous phosphorylation at serine 170 in SLP- 65 revealed a BCR-distal checkpoint for some but not all possible B cell responses.

Glycomic profiling of SRECs by mass spectrometry revealed a diverse range of glycans terminating in sialic acid or GalαGal. In terms of sialylation, α 2 – 6 linkage was more abundant than α 2 – 3, and NeuAc was more abundant than NeuGc. Virus binding and infection experiments were conducted <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>functionally</b> important glycans for influenza virus infection, {{with a focus on}} recently emerged swine viruses. Infection of SRECs with swine and human viruses resulted in different infectivity levels. Glycan microarray analysis with a high infectivity “triple reassortant” virus ((A/Swine/MN/ 593 / 99 (H 3 N 2)) that spread widely throughout the North American swine population and a lower infectivity human virus isolated from a single pig (A/Swine/ONT/ 00130 / 97 (H 3 N 2)) showed that both viruses bound exclusively to glycans containing NeuAcα 2 – 6, with strong binding to sialylated polylactosamine and sialylated N-glycans. Treatment with mannosamine precursors of sialic acid (to alter NeuAc/NeuGc abundances) and linkage-specific sialidases prior to infection indicated that the influenza viruses tested preferentially utilize NeuAcα 2 – 6 -sialylated glycans to infect SRECs. Our data indicate that NeuAcα 2 – 6 -terminated polylactosamine and sialylated N-glycans are important determinants for influenza viruses to infect SRECs. As NeuAcα 2 – 6 polylactosamine glycans play major roles in human virus infection, the importance of these receptor components in virus infection of swine cells has implications for transmission of viruses between humans and pigs and for pigs as possible adaptation hosts of novel human influenza viruses...|$|E

Furthermore, hippocampal functions in connection with neural circuits in medial entorhinal cortex offer a good systems approach to understanding the basic functions of episodic memory formation. Then, we draw our attentions to the connections complexity between both medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) hemispheres to investigate the pattern of connectivity of MEC-MEC functional cell type neurons, furthermore, providing further data associated with spatial memory formation for future research. There are several functional spatial cell types in superficial layer 2 of MEC that code various spatially information in navigational system. These cells including; grid cells, head-direction cells, border cells, conjunctive grid x head-direction cells, conjunctive border x head-direction cells, unknown principal cells and interneurons. By injecting retrogradely transportable recombinant adeno-associated virus carrying channelrhodopsin- 2 transgene in the left MEC of two rats and also right MEC of three rats, optogenetic control over entorhinal neurons with direct projections to the contralateral MEC has been presented. Optogenetics application together with electrophysiological recordings in vivo, enabled us <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>functionally</b> specialized spatial cell types in MEC projecting to the contralateral MEC, as these cells contained minimal response latencies to laser stimulations in MEC.

These SMC's {{are involved in a}} diverse number of biological processes - production of energy, genetic and allosteric regulation, propagation of viral infection, and cell structure integrity. Understanding the motions of SMC's, as opposed to individual proteins or molecules, is a fundamental step towards determining detailed functional mechanisms. (1) TMD trajectories of F 1 -ATPase are used to resolve the motions and interactions that occur during the 120 ° rotation step of the gamma subunit. An ionic track of arginine and lysine residues on the protruding portion of the gamma subunit plays a role in guiding the motions of the beta subunits. (2) The allosteric transition of lactose repressor protein from the repressed (DNA-bound) to the induced (IPTG-bound) state is simulated using TMD. Non-covalent interactions of three interconnected pathways are described. Pathway 2 involves reorganization at the dimer interface and formation of an H 74 -H 74 ' pi-stacking intermediate. (3) TMD is utilized to investigate the translocation mechanism of HIV- 1 reverse transcriptase. The atomic-level interactions between electrostatic (i. e., K 263) and hydrophobic (i. e., W 266) residues and the DNA primer strand are highlighted.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{reports on}} {{studies of the}} pig genome as a model to identify obesity-related genes. Pig geneticists have sought to reduce fat in their pigs through selective breeding, and these efforts ultimately improved the genetic potential in the pig for higher growth, increased efficiency of conversion of food into body weight and lower fat percentage in the body. Therefore, the genetic information obtained from lean growth in the pig can be applicable to studying the genetic basis of human obesity and other related health problems. A three-generation pig family and several commercial lines of pigs were used to study porcine obesity quantitative trait loci (QTL), and genes for the relevant phenotypes to human growth and obesity. Several candidate genes were successfully localized within the porcine obesity QTL and the comparative locations of these QTL and candidate genes were discussed in the present study. Furthermore, the relationships between DNA polymorphisms of the candidate genes {{and a variety of}} phenotypic measurements were studied. These results provide important insights into the role of biological candidate genes in obesity and other related metabolic disorders. The functional properties of a naturally occurring variant of porcine melanocortin- 4 receptor (MC 4 R) gene were comparatively characterized <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>functionally</b> important structural amino acid residues in the MC 4 R sequences. This research also discovered a unique imprinting phenotype in the porcine delta-like 1 (DLK 1) locus. The imprinting phenotype was first found in the callipyge locus in sheep and called 2 ̆ 7 polar overdominance 2 ̆ 7. However, further identification has been elusive in other mammals. The results of the porcine DLK 1 locus indicate that the inheritance mechanism of polar overdominance for callipyge sheep might have a conserved role for growth and fat deposition phenotypes in pigs and the DLK 1 gene might be an important player for the imprinting phenotypes. This dissertation demonstrates the useful value of comparative genomic study of pigs as a model organism to investigate genes of interest for human health, especially obesity, and the results also have implications for the development of improved genetic selection programs for the targeted traits of interest in pig production systems...|$|E
40|$|Muscleblind (Mbl) is an {{evolutionarily}} conserved {{family of}} proteins involved in {{many aspects of}} RNA metabolism, including alternative splicing. Disruption of Muscleblind in several animals lends {{to a variety of}} defects and disease, including the multi-systemic disorder Myotonic Dystrophy (DM). Though much is known about the involvement of Muscleblind in DM, there is much basic knowledge of the protein's function to be discovered. We approach this problem by exploring the functional conservation of a diverse subset of Muscleblind homologs. The functions of Muscleblinds from a basal metazoan, Trichoplax adhaerens, a primitive chordate, Ciona intestinalis, and the model organisms, Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans were compared to human Muscleblind-like (MBNL). The zinc finger RNA-binding domains are the most conserved region between homologs, suggesting a conserved role in RNA binding and splicing regulation. To test this, we used splicing reporter assays with validated human MBNL-regulated mini-genes and performed RNA sequencing experiments in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Additionally, we accessed the subcellular localization of the homologs to determine conservation of extra-nuclear functions. Reporter assays in HeLa cells showed that the homologs can positively and negatively regulate splicing. Our RNA-seq experiments led us to discover hundreds of endogenously regulated splicing events, including the identity of the transcripts, direction of splicing regulation, types of splicing events, and the magnitude of alternate exon inclusion in the spliced mRNAs. Additionally, we identified a spectrum of splicing events, from those uniquely regulated by a single Muscleblind, to events regulated by all Muscleblinds, and, characterized the variation in splicing activity that exists between homologs. A subset of events regulated by mammalian Muscleblind were oppositely regulated by non-mammalian homologs. Muscleblinds show nuclear-cytoplasmic localization, which suggests conservation in extra-nuclear functions. In conjunction with exon and intron sequences, this information provides a future tool to discover conserved and novel RNA regulatory elements used by diverse Muscleblinds to regulate splicing and in putative cytoplasmic functions.

The first aim was <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>functionally</b> the role of the LVA conductance in the RVLM of SHR and normotensive Wistar Kyoto (WKY). Urethane anaesthetised (1. 3 g/kg ip) ventilated animals were used. Bilateral microinjection of NiCl 2 (50 nl, 50 mM) were made into the RVLM of SD, WKY and SHR. In both SD (n= 4) and WKY (n= 5) SNA decreased immediately (peak change - 56 ± 8 % and - 63 ± 4. 5 %) as did BP (peak change - 31 ± 5 and - 39 ± 2 and mmHg) and HR (- 33 ± 13 bpm and - 57 ± 6 bpm). Vehicle had no effect. Ni 2 + evoked effects were not significantly different between the two strains. In contrast injections of NiCl 2 in SHR (n= 6) elicited sustained increases in SNA (+ 54 ± 6 %), AP (+ 42 ± 8 mmHg) and HR (+ 41 ± 9 bpm). The quandary is to explain how Ni 2 + could evoke this response in SHR. T-type channels can be modulated by various endogenous ligands and a number of functional and chemical differences have been individually described in the RVLM of SHR compared to WKY. In order to identify all possible candidates that could modify T-type channels we next sought to compare the protein profile in the RVLM of SHR (n= 3) and WKY (n= 3) by shot gun proteomics. Brains were rapidly removed under pentobarbitone anaesthesia (100 mg/kg ip) and frozen before RVLM region dissection (~ 1 mm x 1. 5 mm). Conventional protein preparation and digestion strategies preceded LC-MS/MS. In total 1438 proteins were identified with 168 significantly differentially expressed: 70 up regulated and 98 down regulated in SHR vs WKY. Key pathways affected include: increased glutamatergic signalling (VGLUT 2, EAAT, GNAO); synaptic vesicle related activity (SYN 1, SYN 2, SYT, SNAP 25, SYNGR 3, NRXN 3, FLOT 1, FLOT 2), remodelling (MAP 6, CAPZB, SEPT 6, GSN, TUBB 3, TUBB 4, TUBB 5, TUBB 4 B, EMS 1), decreased GABAergic signalling (GAD, ABAT, GPHN), oxidative phosphorylation (ND 1, NDUF 6, CYTB, CYTC, ATP 5 G 1) and altered glutathione signalling (GSS, GSTT 1) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{study of}} phylogeny, i. e. the {{evolutionary}} history of species, {{is a central}} problem in biology and a key for understanding characteristics of contemporary species. Many problems in this area can be formulated as combinatorial optimisation problems which makes it particularly interesting for computer scientists. The reconstruction of the phylogeny of species can be based on various kinds of data, e. g. morphological properties or characteristics of the genetic information of the species. Maximum parsimony is a popular and widely used method for phylogenetic reconstruction aiming for {{an explanation of the}} observed data requiring the least evolutionary changes. A certain property of the genetic information gained much interest for the reconstruction of phylogeny in recent time: the organisation of the genomes of species, i. e. the arrangement of the genes on the chromosomes. But the idea to reconstruct phylogenetic information from gene arrangements has a long history. In Dobzhansky and Sturtevant (1938) it was already pointed out that “a comparison of the different gene arrangements in the same chromosome may, in certain cases, throw light on the historical relationships of these structures, and consequently {{on the history of the}} species as a whole”. This kind of data is promising for the study of deep evolutionary relationships because gene arrangements are believed to evolve slowly (Rokas and Holland, 2000). This seems to be the case especially for mitochondrial genomes which are available for a wide range of species (Boore, 1999). The development of methods for the reconstruction of phylogeny from gene arrangement data has made considerable progress during the last years. Prominent examples are the computation of parsimonious evolutionary scenarios, i. e. a shortest sequence of rearrangements transforming one arrangement of genes into another or the length of such a minimal scenario (Hannenhalli and Pevzner, 1995 b; Sankoff, 1992; Watterson et al., 1982); the reconstruction of parsimonious phylogenetic trees from gene arrangement data (Bader et al., 2008; Bernt et al., 2007 b; Bourque and Pevzner, 2002; Moret et al., 2002 a); or the computation of the similarities of gene arrangements (Bergeron et al., 2008 a; Heber et al., 2009). 1 1 Introduction The central theme of this work is to provide efficient algorithms for modified versions of fundamental genome rearrangement problems using more plausible rearrangement models. Two types of modified rearrangement models are explored. The first type is to restrict the set of allowed rearrangements as follows. It can be observed that certain groups of genes are preserved during evolution. This may be caused by functional constraints which prevented the destruction (Lathe et al., 2000; Sémon and Duret, 2006; Xie et al., 2003), certain properties of the rearrangements which shaped the gene orders (Eisen et al., 2000; Sankoff, 2002; Tillier and Collins, 2000), or just because no destructive rearrangement happened since the speciation of the gene orders. It can be assumed that gene groups, found in all studied gene orders, are not acquired independently. Accordingly, these gene groups should be preserved in plausible reconstructions of the course of evolution, in particular the gene groups should be present in the reconstructed putative ancestral gene orders. This can be achieved by restricting the set of rearrangements, which are allowed for the reconstruction, to those which preserve the gene groups of the given gene orders. Since it is difficult <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>functionally</b> what a gene group is, it has been proposed to consider common combinatorial structures of the gene orders as gene groups (Marcotte et al., 1999; Overbeek et al., 1999). The second considered modification of the rearrangement model is extending the set of allowed rearrangement types. Different types of rearrangement operations have shuffled the gene orders during evolution. It should be attempted to use the same set of rearrangement operations for the reconstruction otherwise distorted or even wrong phylogenetic conclusions may be obtained in the worst case. Both possibilities have been considered for certain rearrangement problems before. Restricted sets of allowed rearrangements have been used successfully for the computation of parsimonious rearrangement scenarios consisting of inversions only where the gene groups are identified as common intervals (Bérard et al., 2007; Figeac and Varré, 2004). Extending the set of allowed rearrangement operations is a delicate task. On the one hand it is unknown which rearrangements have to be regarded because this is part of the phylogeny to be discovered. On the other hand, efficient exact rearrangement methods including several operations are still rare, in particular when transpositions should be included. For example, the problem to compute shortest rearrangement scenarios including transpositions is still of unknown computational complexity. Currently, only efficient approximation algorithms are known (e. g. Bader and Ohlebusch, 2007; Elias and Hartman, 2006). Two problems have been studied with respect to one or even both of these possibilities in the scope of this work. The first one is the inversion median problem. Given the gene orders of some taxa, this problem asks for potential ancestral gene orders such that the corresponding inversion scenario is parsimonious, i. e. has a minimum length. Solving this problem is an essential component 2 of algorithms for computing phylogenetic trees from gene arrangements (Bourque and Pevzner, 2002; Moret et al., 2002 a, 2001). The unconstrained inversion median problem is NP-hard (Caprara, 2003). In Chapter 3 the inversion median problem is studied under the additional constraint to preserve gene groups of the input gene orders. Common intervals, i. e. sets of genes that appear consecutively in the gene orders, are used for modelling gene groups. The problem of finding such ancestral gene orders is called the preserving inversion median problem. Already the problem of finding a shortest inversion scenario for two gene orders is NP-hard (Figeac and Varré, 2004). Mitochondrial gene orders are a rich source for phylogenetic investigations because they are known for more than 1 000 species. Four rearrangement operations are reported at least in the literature to be relevant for the study of mitochondrial gene order evolution (Boore, 1999) : That is inversions, transpositions, inverse transpositions, and tandem duplication random loss (TDRL). Efficient methods for a plausible reconstruction of genome rearrangements for mitochondrial gene orders using all four operations are presented in Chapter 4. An important rearrangement operation, in particular for the study of mitochondrial gene orders, is the tandem duplication random loss operation (e. g. Boore, 2000; Mauro et al., 2006). This rearrangement duplicates a part of a gene order followed by the random loss of one of the redundant copies of each gene. The gene order is rearranged depending on which copy is lost. This rearrangement should be regarded for reconstructing phylogeny from gene order data. But the properties of this rearrangement operation have rarely been studied (Bouvel and Rossin, 2009; Chaudhuri et al., 2006). The combinatorial properties of the TDRL operation are studied in Chapter 5. The enumeration and counting of sorting TDRLs, that is TDRL operations reducing the distance, is studied in particular. Closed formulas for computing the number of sorting TDRLs and methods for the enumeration are presented. Furthermore, TDRLs are one of the operations considered in Chapter 4. An interesting property of this rearrangement, distinguishing it from other rearrangements, is its asymmetry. That is the effects of a single TDRL can (in the most cases) not be reversed with a single TDRL. The use of this property for phylogeny reconstruction is studied in Section 4. 3. This thesis is structured as follows. The existing approaches obeying similar types of modified rearrangement models as well as important concepts and computational methods to related problems are reviewed in Chapter 2. The combinatorial structures of gene orders that have been proposed for identifying gene groups, in particular common intervals, as well as the computational approaches for their computation are reviewed in Section 2. 2. Approaches for computing parsimonious pairwise rearrangement scenarios are outlined in Section 2. 3. Methods for the computation genome rearrangement scenarios obeying biologically motivated constraints, as introduced above, are detailed in Section 2. 4. The approaches for the inversion median problem are covered in Section 2. 5. Methods for the reconstruction of phylogenetic trees from gene arrangement data are briefly outlined in Section 2. 6. 3 1 Introduction Chapter 3 introduces the new algorithms CIP, ECIP, and TCIP for solving the preserving inversion median problem. The efficiency of the algorithm is empirically studied for simulated as well as mitochondrial data. The description of algorithms CIP and ECIP is based on Bernt et al. (2006 b). TCIP has been described in Bernt et al. (2007 a, 2008 b). But the theoretical foundation of TCIP is extended significantly within this work in order to allow for more than three input permutations. Gene order rearrangement methods that have been developed for the reconstruction of the phylogeny of mitochondrial gene orders are presented in the fourth chapter. The presented algorithm CREx computes rearrangement scenarios for pairs of gene orders. CREx regards the four types of rearrangement operations which are important for mitochondrial gene orders. Based on CREx the algorithm TreeREx for assigning rearrangement events to a given tree is developed. The quality of the CREx reconstructions is analysed in a large empirical study for simulated gene orders. The results of TreeREx are analysed for several mitochondrial data sets. Algorithms CREx and TreeREx have been published in Bernt et al. (2008 a, 2007 c). The analysis of the mitochondrial gene orders of Echinodermata was included in Perseke et al. (2008). Additionally, a new and simple method is presented to explore the potential of the CREx method. The new method is applied to the complete mitochondrial data set. The problem of enumerating and counting sorting TDRLs is studied in Chapter 5. The theoretical results are covered to a large extent by Bernt et al. (2009 b). The missing combinatorial explanation for some of the presented formulas is given here for the first time. Therefor, a new method for the enumeration and counting of sorting TDRLs has been developed (Bernt et al., 2009 a) ...|$|E
40|$|A {{multidisciplinary}} approach {{is required to}} understand the complex intricacies of drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE). A challenge that neurosurgeons across the world face is accurate localization of epileptogenic zone. A significant number of patients who have undergone resective brain surgery for epilepsy still continue to have seizures. The reason behind this therapy resistance still eludes us. Thus to develop a cure for the difficult to treat epilepsy, we need to comprehensively study epileptogenesis. Till date, {{most of the studies}} on DRE is focused on undermining the abnormal functioning of receptors involved in synaptic transmission and reduced levels of antiepileptic drugs around there targets. But recent advances in imaging and electrophysiological techniques have suggested the role epileptogenic networks in the process of epileptogenesis. According to this hypothesis, the local neurons recruit distant neurons through complex oscillatory circuits, which further recruit more distant neurons, thereby generating a hypersynchronus neuronal activity. The epileptogenic networks may be confined to the lesion or could propagate to distant focus. The success of surgery depends on the precision by which the epileptogenic network is determined while planning a surgical intervention. Here, we summarize various modalities of electrophysiological and imaging techniques <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the <b>functionally</b> active epileptogenic networks. We also review evidence pertaining to the proposed role of epileptogenic network in abnormal synaptic transmission {{which is one of the}} major causes of epileptiform activity. Elucidation of current concepts in regulation of synaptic transmission by networks will help develop therapies for epilepsy cases that cannot be managed pharmacologically...|$|R

Peripheral blood and skin biopsies were obtained 6 or 24 h after sensitive subjects were challenged with intradermal injections of grass pollen allergen (Ag) and control (C) solution. The frequency of cells expressing CD 3, CD 4, CD 8, CD 45 RO, and CD 25 /mm 2 {{was determined by}} immunohistochemistry in nine subjects. Vβ usage was assessed by reverse transcription-PCR in five of nine subjects. A significantly greater frequency of CD 3 + and CD 45 RO+ (memory) T cells was detected in Ag sites than in C sites at 24 h after challenge but not at 6 h. The frequency of activated (CD 25 +) and helper (CD 4 +) T cells appeared to be increased in Ag sites as well, though not significantly. Vβ 6 was the most commonly expressed Vβ detected in Ag sites, {{but it was also}} detected in accompanying C sites. Vβ 2 was the most commonly expressed Vβ detected in C sites. Sequence analysis in one case revealed Vβ expression in a 6 -h Ag site to be essentially polyclonal. Our findings suggest that memory T cells with Vβ expression similar to that in normal skin accumulate in developing cutaneous LPR. The limited usage of Vβ suggests a preferential recruitment or retention of reactive T cells from an endogenous subset of skin-homing T cells with its own skewed Vβ repertoire...|$|R
40|$|The {{functional}} activity of lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA- 1) on leukocytes can be regulated by T-cell receptor (TCR) stimulation and pharmacologic agents. It was of interest <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> if <b>functionally</b> active LFA- 1 could be reconstituted on a nonhematopoietic, LFA- 1 -negative cell line. We report {{the expression of}} LFA- 1 and diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) Mac- 1 alpha beta heterodimers on the cell surface of a fibroblastoid cell line, COS, by DEAE dextran cotransfection of the alpha and beta subunit cDNAs. Immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that the alpha and beta subunit was expressed in heterodimers. The alpha or beta subunit was expressed at lower levels after transfection with the alpha or beta subunit cDNA alone. Cotransfection of the alpha and beta subunit cDNAs, but not transfection of alpha or beta alone, was sufficient to reconstitute intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 (ICAM- 1) binding activity. Consistent with this observation, LFA- 1 on the fibroblastoid cells possesses the activation epitope defined by the L 16 monoclonal antibody (mAb). This epitope marks the conversion of LFA- 1 from the low to high avidity state on peripheral blood T lymphocytes (PBLs) and is constitutively present on activated cell lines. In contrast to LFA- 1 on leukocytes, the {{functional activity}} of LFA- 1 on fibroblastoid cells was not influenced by phorbol ester treatment. Furthermore, the use of agents that interfere with intracellular signaling, a protein kinase C inhibitor, cAMP analogue, or {{the combination of a}} phosphodiesterase inhibitor and adenyl cyclase activator, did not affect the binding of COS cells expressing LFA- 1 to purified ICAM- 1...|$|R

In each of those cases networks of functionally related residue positions were discovered that upon mutation influenced enzyme specificity and/or activity as predicted.
