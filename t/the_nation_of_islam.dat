5|$|By March 1964, MalcolmX {{had grown}} disillusioned with <b>the</b> <b>Nation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Islam</b> and its leader Elijah Muhammad.

After a period of travel in Africa and the Middle East, which {{included}} completing the Hajj, he also became known as el-Hajj Malik el-Shabazz. He repudiated <b>the</b> <b>Nation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Islam,</b> disavowed racism and founded Muslim Mosque, Inc. and the Organization of Afro-American Unity. He continued to emphasize Pan-Africanism, black self-determination, and black self-defense.|$|E

5|$|Many {{whites and}} some blacks were alarmed by MalcolmX and the {{statements}} he made during this period. He and <b>the</b> <b>Nation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Islam</b> {{were described as}} hatemongers, black supremacists, racists, violence-seekers, segregationists, and a threat to improved race relations. He was accused of being antisemitic. One {{of the goals of}} the civil rights movement was to end disenfranchisement of African Americans, but <b>the</b> <b>Nation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Islam</b> forbade its members from participating in voting and other aspects of the political process.

5|$|MalcolmX {{is widely}} {{regarded}} as the second most influential leader of <b>the</b> <b>Nation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Islam</b> after Elijah Muhammad. He was largely credited with the group's dramatic increase in membership between the early 1950s and early 1960s (from 500 to 25,000 by one estimate; from 1,200 to 50,000 or 75,000 by another).|$|E

5|$|After leaving <b>the</b> <b>Nation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Islam,</b> MalcolmX {{announced}} {{his willingness to}} work with leaders {{of the civil rights}} movement, though he advocated some changes to their policies. He felt that calling the movement a struggle for civil rights would keep the issue within the United States, while changing the focus to human rights would make it an international concern. The movement could then bring its complaints before the United Nations, where MalcolmX said the emerging nations of the world would add their support.|$|E

5|$|Published posthumously, The Autobiography of MalcolmX is {{an account}} of the life of MalcolmX, born Malcolm Little (1925–1965), who became a human rights activist. Beginning with his mother's pregnancy, the book {{describes}} Malcolm's childhood in Michigan, {{the death of his father}} under questionable circumstances, and his mother's deteriorating mental health that resulted in her commitment to a psychiatric hospital. Little's young adulthood in Boston and New York City is covered, as well as his involvement in organized crime. This led to his arrest and subsequent eight- to ten-year prison sentence, of which he served six-and-a-half years (1946–1952). The book addresses his ministry with Elijah Muhammad and <b>the</b> <b>Nation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Islam</b> (1952–1963) and his emergence as the organization's national spokesman. It documents his disillusionment with and departure from <b>the</b> <b>Nation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Islam</b> in March 1964, his pilgrimage to Mecca, which catalyzed his conversion to orthodox Sunni Islam, and his travels in Africa. MalcolmX was assassinated in New York's Audubon Ballroom in February 1965, before they finished the book. His co-author, journalist Alex Haley, summarizes the last days of MalcolmX's life, and describes in detail their working agreement, including Haley's personal views on his subject, in the Autobiography's epilogue.|$|E
