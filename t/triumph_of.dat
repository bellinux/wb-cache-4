5|$|Critics {{have offered}} many {{explanations}} for the characters' longevity, suggesting variously that the Hardy Boys embody simple wish fulfillment, American ideals of boyhood and masculinity, a well-respected father paradoxically argued to be inept, {{and the possibility of}} the <b>triumph</b> <b>of</b> good over evil.|$|E
5|$|God {{in whose}} hands are {{the hearts of}} Kings, who art the consoler of the humble and the {{protector}} of all who hope in thee, grant to our Queen Elizabeth and to the Christian people to celebrate wisely the <b>triumph</b> <b>of</b> thy goodness {{so that they may}} be always renewed to glory through thee, through Jesus Christ our Lord.|$|E

5|$|In 1821 Etty's The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia (also {{known as}} The <b>Triumph</b> <b>of</b> Cleopatra) was a {{critical}} success. The painting featured nude figures, and over the following years Etty painted further nudes in biblical, literary and mythological settings. All {{but one of the}} 15 paintings Etty exhibited in the 1820s included at least one nude figure.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, the Los Angeles-based gay neo-Nazi National Socialist League under Russell Veh stirred {{controversy}} in the United States when it attempted mass distribution of Jud Süß. The NSL was {{actively involved in the}} distribution of Nazi propaganda films in America, including <b>Triumph</b> <b>of</b> the Will.|$|E
5|$|Leni Riefenstahl's <b>Triumph</b> <b>of</b> the Will (1935)—documenting the 1934 Nuremberg Rally—and Olympia (1938)—covering the 1936 Summer Olympics—pioneered {{techniques}} of camera movement and editing that influenced later films. New {{techniques such as}} telephoto lenses and cameras mounted on tracks were employed. Both films remain controversial, as their aesthetic merit is inseparable from their propagandising of National Socialist ideals.|$|E

Veshch will champion constructive art, whose mission is not, after all, to embellish life, but to organize it.|$|E

5|$|A christening ewer and basin {{made by the}} Garrard&Co. founder George Wickes in 1735 {{were used}} at the christening of the future GeorgeIII in 1738. His father, Frederick, Prince of Wales, had been banished from the royal court by GeorgeII and was {{forbidden}} to use the CharlesII Font. An inscription {{at the front of}} the ewer records its use at the christening of GeorgeIII's son, Prince Alfred, in 1780. The handle of the ewer is topped by a figure of Hercules slaying the Hydra, symbolising the <b>triumph</b> <b>of</b> virtue over vice.|$|E
5|$|A stage {{adaptation}} of Winesburg, Ohio by Sherwood Anderson (initially {{in collaboration with}} playwright Arthur Barton) was performed at the Hedgerow Theatre in Rose Valley, Pennsylvania in 1934. Directed by Jasper Deeter, it achieved some success, running from June through September of that year. Charles Scribner's Sons published {{this version of the}} play alongside three one-act plays (<b>Triumph</b> <b>of</b> an Egg, Mother, and They Married Later), also by Anderson, as Plays: Winesburg and Others in 1937.|$|E
5|$|After the <b>triumph</b> <b>of</b> the {{previous}} season, the 1945–46 season {{was a complete}} loss for Kennedy. He {{got off to a}} slow start, beginning the season at right wing before being returned to his center position and he also fell ill. By January Kennedy had only 5 points in 21 games and was then lost {{for the rest of the}} season due to an injury to his foot, when a Boston Bruin player's skate dug into his boot. With the Leafs also losing Captain Syl Apps to injury Toronto missed the playoffs.|$|E

5|$|During the Second Barons' War, Boniface {{seems to}} have sided first with the English bishops against King Henry, but later he sided with Henry. In 1262, he went to France, where he excommunicated the barons {{opposing}} the king. He was not summoned to the Parliament at London in January 1265 because he was abroad. On the <b>triumph</b> <b>of</b> the king's party in 1265, he returned to England, arriving there in May 1266.|$|E
5|$|One of Speer's first {{commissions}} after Troost's {{death was}} the Zeppelinfeld stadium—the Nürnberg parade grounds seen in Leni Riefenstahl's propaganda masterpiece <b>Triumph</b> <b>of</b> the Will. This huge work {{was able to}} hold 340,000 people. Speer insisted that as many events as possible be held at night, both to give greater prominence to his lighting effects and to hide the individual Nazis, {{many of whom were}} overweight. Speer surrounded the site with 130 anti-aircraft searchlights. Speer described this as his most beautiful work, and as the only one that stood the test of time.|$|E

5|$|The Punch {{serialisation}} {{ended in}} May 1889 with the diary entry for 21 March, which records the Pooters {{and their friends}} celebrating the minor <b>triumph</b> <b>of</b> Lupin's appointment as a clerk at Perkupps. That was the intended end of the diary; however, when the writers were preparing the manuscript for publication as a book, they added a further four months' entries to the text, and included 26 illustrations by Weedon Grossmith.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Commission {{began its}} {{work and the}} {{proceedings}} were followed closely and eagerly debated by the public. As Playford did not commute Stuart's sentence, Dunstan introduced a bill to abolish capital punishment. The vote was split along party lines and was thus defeated, but Dunstan used the opportunity to attack the Playmander with much effect in the media, portraying the failed legislation as an unjust <b>triumph</b> <b>of</b> a malapportioned minority who had a vengeance mentality over an electorally repressed majority who wanted a humane outcome.|$|E
5|$|The Stuckists gained {{significant}} {{media coverage}} {{for eight years}} of protests (2000–2006 and 2008) outside Tate Britain against the Turner Prize, sometimes dressed as clowns. In 2001 they demonstrated in Trafalgar Square at the unveiling of Rachel Whiteread's Monument. In 2002, they carried a coffin marked The Death of Conceptual Art to the White Cube Gallery. In 2004 outside the launch of The <b>Triumph</b> <b>of</b> Painting at the Saatchi Gallery they wore tall hats with Charles Saatchi's face emblazoned and carried placards claiming that Saatchi had copied their ideas.|$|E
