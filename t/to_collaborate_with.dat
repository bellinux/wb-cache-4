5|$|New Multitudes is one {{of several}} tribute albums for American folk singer-songwriter Woody Guthrie. Guthrie died in 1967 after an {{extended}} battle with Huntington's disease, but his abbreviated career helped to inspire innumerable musicians during his lifetime {{as well as in the}} 1960s folk revival movement. Initially, this project was announced as a Farrar solo album with Johnson as a contributor. It was intended to follow previous efforts to elaborate on the archives of the Foundation by Billy Bragg and Wilco with the albums Mermaid Avenue (1998) and Mermaid Avenue Vol. II (2000), Blackfire's Woody Guthrie Singles (2003), Jonatha Brooke's The Works (2008), and the various artists compilation Note of Hope: A Celebration of Woody Guthrie (2011). Farrar was initially invited <b>to</b> <b>collaborate</b> <b>with</b> Bragg on the Mermaid Avenue sessions in 1995, but felt uncomfortable working on the material with someone else. Warner Bros. Records wanted all of Son Volt <b>to</b> <b>collaborate</b> <b>with</b> Bragg, but after Farrar declined, he kept the idea in mind. In 2006, he approached Nora Guthrie about returning to her father's lyrics and she agreed.|$|E

5|$|Buscetta {{claimed that}} Mafia boss Stefano Bontade {{organized}} De Mauro’s kidnap, because his {{investigations into the}} death of Mattei {{came very close to}} the Mafia, and Bontade’s own role in the affair.

5|$|From 1907 to 1908, {{during the}} time when the Young Turks came to power in the Ottoman Empire, Armenians from the Caucasus, Western Armenia, and Iran started <b>to</b> <b>collaborate</b> <b>with</b> Iranian constitutionalists and revolutionaries. Political parties, notably the Dashnaktsutiun, wanted to {{influence}} the direction of the revolution towards greater democracy and to safeguard gains already achieved. The Dashnak contribution to the fight was mostly military, as it sent some of its well-known fedayees to Iran after the guerrilla campaign in the Ottoman Empire ended with the rise of the Young Turks. A notable ARF member already in Iran was Yeprem Khan, who had established a branch of the party in the country. Yeprem Khan was highly instrumental in the Constitutional revolution of Iran. After the Persian national parliament was shelled by the Russian Colonel Vladimir Liakhov, Yeprem Khan rallied with Sattar Khan and other revolutionary leaders in the Constitutional Revolution of Iran against Mohammad Ali Shah Qajar. Relations between Sattar Khan and the ARF oscillated between amity and resentment. Sometimes he was viewed as being ignorant, while at other times he was dubbed a great hero. Nonetheless, the ARF came <b>to</b> <b>collaborate</b> <b>with</b> him and alongside Yeprem Khan posted many victories including the capture of Rasht in February 1909. At the end of June 1909, the fighters arrived in Tehran and after several battles, took over the Majles building and the Sepahsalar mosque. Yeprem Khan was then appointed chief of Tehran police. This caused tensions between the Dashnaks and Khan.|$|E
