5|$|After the 1998 season, Wells {{was traded}} to the Toronto Blue Jays for Roger Clemens, who had just {{completed}} two consecutive Cy Young Award-winning seasons. In a regular season that included another perfect game by a Yankees pitcher, this one by David Cone, New York led the AL East with 98 wins and beat the Rangers in the ALDS. This led to an ALCS against the rival Red Sox. New York won the first two games en route to a 4–1 series win, and went on to sweep the Braves in the 1999 World Series. The postseason results gave the 1998–99 Yankees a 22–3 playoff record, and the team held a 12-game winning streak in World Series competition dating back to 1996. Although the 2000 Yankees had an 87–74 regular season record <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> among playoff qualifiers, the team won consecutive playoff series to claim the AL championship. New York's pennant placed them in the 2000 World Series against the cross-town Mets, the first Subway Series in 44 years. With a four games to one victory, the Yankees gained their third successive title. As of 2016, the 2000 Yankees are the most recent MLB team to repeat as World Series champions and the Yankees of 1998–2000 are the last team to win three consecutive World Series.|$|E
25|$|At Brisbane, on a wicket <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> that I {{have ever}} seen, the Yorkshireman was superb. The head-high bouncer was safely ignored. The chest-high {{deliveries}} {{of both the}} pace men and the spinners were played safely to the ground, {{out of the way}} of the many grasping hands in the leg-trap, and Hutton's display was a perfect lesson in the art of batsmanship...that will long remain in my memory, being by far the best innings I have ever seen played.|$|E
500|$|Speaking {{about the}} moment when Nico Rosberg let him past {{in the early stages}} of the race, Hamilton told the press that he had thanked his {{teammate}} for [...] "being a gentleman". When asked how painful it had been to be asked to let Hamilton go by, Rosberg said: [...] "It was more painful the feeling that I had in the car. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst.</b> Around Monaco, that's not a nice feeling to have. I had no confidence at all. The second thing [...] was just a consequence of that." [...] Mercedes's motorsport director Toto Wolff also praised Rosberg for working for the team and moving to the side without questioning the team's decision. Rosberg was however unable to give an explanation for his slow pace during the early stages. He pointed to the possibility that his car's tyre and brake temperatures had been particularly affected by the period behind the safety car.|$|E

50|$|Another {{branch of}} {{conflict}} theory <b>is</b> <b>the</b> conflict theory of aging.

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Vince Gilligan, John Shiban, and Frank Spotnitz three days after another script idea fell through. [...] Spotnitz noted that [...] "Darin Morgan had left the show but was going to {{contribute}} an episode. And we realized at the eleventh hour that it wasn't going to happen, and we were stuck with nothing. John, Vince and I broke that story in maybe two days. We split up the acts, wrote it in probably another two days, and gave the crew something to prep before Christmas break. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> ever." [...] Carter ended up rewriting the script over the holiday. The initial cut ended up being too long, resulting in a scene introducing Scully's older brother Bill Scully, played by Pat Skipper, being removed. The character, still played by Skipper, would eventually make his first appearance in the fourth-season finale [...] "Gethsemane". The scene which would have established the character was intended to echo a similar scene in the second season episode [...] "One Breath", which featured Don S. Davis as Scully's father. Both scenes featured the actors standing over a supine Scully, wearing white United States Navy dress uniforms. Also deleted from the episode was a kiss between Mulder and Scully, {{which would have been}} the first in the series' run. This was an ad-lib on Anderson and Duchovny's part, and was removed from the episode as it was something Chris Carter felt he wanted to make use of in the series' film adaptation. Such a kiss was eventually deferred to season six's [...] "Triangle".|$|E

Watson has been reported as saying: [...] "It [...] changed my priorities. Made me appreciate the importance of relationships, of friends and family and, most of all, my two daughters. My fear for them if I died, [...] – <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> part. I adore them". In August 2015 Watson married his girlfriend of five years, Louise Harris, 'in a fairytale Spanish ceremony'.|$|E

2500|$|The Ninth Doctor {{intentionally}} electrocuted the Dalek {{he encountered}} in [...] "Dalek" [...] despite its pleas {{for him to}} have pity, coldly stating [...] "you never did". The Tenth Doctor notably had a [...] "one chance only" [...] policy when dealing with aliens invading the Earth, leading to his companion Donna Noble commenting that he needs [...] "someone" [...] to keep his temperament in check. In [...] "The Family of Blood", the Doctor defeats an alien who noted retrospectively that [...] "he never raised his voice – <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> thing, the fury of a Time Lord". The Eleventh Doctor was the only Doctor to undergo three significant personality changes: becoming even more ruthless when alone in his travels, when Amy Pond and Rory Williams were absent; falling into a depression beyond his other incarnations when the couple were lost to him, becoming the first Doctor to retire voluntarily; and finally being overjoyed at the prospect that Clara Oswin Oswald was alive.|$|E

30|$|Over erasure channels, DE becomes one-dimensional, and {{it allows}} to analyze and even to {{construct}} capacity-achieving codes [20]. It works by recursively tracking the erasure probability messages passed {{around the edges of}} the graph during IT decoding. Roughly speaking, this means that it recursively computes the fraction of erased messages passed during the IT decoding. Using this technique, the decoding threshold of codes <b>is</b> defined as <b>the</b> supremum value of ε (<b>that</b> <b>is,</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> channel condition) <b>that</b> allows transmission with an arbitrary small error probability assuming N goes to infinity [19].|$|R

50|$|A {{utilitarian}} welfare function (also {{called a}} Benthamite welfare function) sums {{the utility of}} each individual {{in order to obtain}} society's overall welfare. All people <b>are</b> treated <b>the</b> same, regardless of their initial level of utility. One extra unit of utility for a starving person is not seen to be of any greater value than an extra unit of utility for a millionaire. At <b>the</b> other extreme <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Max-Min, or Rawlsian utility function (Stiglitz, 2000, p102)reference. According to the Max-Min criterion, welfare <b>is</b> maximized when <b>the</b> utility of those society members <b>that</b> have <b>the</b> least <b>is</b> <b>the</b> greatest. No economic activity will increase social welfare unless it improves the position of <b>the</b> society member <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> off.
