5|$|The show's {{goals for}} {{outreach}} were addressed {{through a series}} of programs that first focused on promotion and then, after the first season, on the development of educational materials used in preschool settings. Innovative programs were developed because their target audience, children and their families in low-income, inner-city homes, did not traditionally watch educational programs on television and because <b>traditional</b> <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> promotion and advertising were not effective with these groups.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{time was}} {{on the side of}} the defenders; most armies could not afford to wait out the {{prosecution}} of a siege, especially of a well-fortified, well-provisioned city. Until the invention of gunpowder-based weapons (and the resulting higher-velocity projectiles), the balance of power and logistics definitely favored the defender. With the introduction of large-caliber mortars and howitzers (in modern times), the <b>traditional</b> <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> defense became less effective against a determined siege, although many of the trace italienne fortresses presented a formidable challenge well into the twentieth century.|$|E

5|$|The Echo {{moved from}} Bridge Street to a {{purpose-built}} newspaper office at Echo House, Pennywell Industrial Estate, in 1976. The move brought {{an end to}} the <b>traditional</b> <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> printing using hot molten metal to produce type and printing plates, and introduced computer technology. The £4million development saw the Echo become the first daily newspaper in the North East to be completely produced by photo-composition and web-offset printing. It also saw a change in the Echos appearance, with a new shape, bolder typefaces and clearer printing. The first new-look Echo was printed at Pennywell on 26 April 1976 and was issue number 32,512.|$|E
5|$|Ya Kun Kaya Toast {{have over}} forty Singaporean outlets, {{about half of}} which are franchised, and over thirty {{overseas}} outlets, all franchised, across seven countries (China, Indonesia, Japan, Myanmar, South Korea, Taiwan, Philippines and United Arab Emirates); they plan to expand to Brunei, India, Malaysia, the Maldives, and Thailand in future. The stores have a retro ambience, with wooden tables and stools, Chinese calligraphy of the company name, posters about their history, <b>traditional</b> <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> preparing food and customer service reflecting Chinese family values. Unlike their main competitors, they have a limited menu that revolves around their core product, kaya toast, with cheese, peanut butter and ice cream as alternative spreads for their thin, brown, crispy bread. To appeal to a wider demographic, Ya Kun also sell French toast and Toastwiches (their Asian alternative to sandwiches); set meals combine any type of toast with soft-boiled eggs and a beverage, usually coffee or teh tarik.|$|E

25|$|With {{the advent}} of Islam in India the <b>traditional</b> <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> {{education}} increasingly came under Islamic influence. Pre-Mughal rulers such as Qutb-ud-din Aybak and other Muslim rulers initiated institutions which imparted religious knowledge. Scholars such as Nizamuddin Auliya and Moinuddin Chishti became prominent educators and established Islamic monasteries. Students from Bukhara and Afghanistan visited India to study humanities and science.|$|E

25|$|Other ways of {{measuring}} innovation {{have traditionally been}} expenditure, for example, investment in R (Research and Development) as percentage of GNP (Gross National Product).
