5|$|On Thursday, December 12, 1799, Washington {{spent several}} hours {{inspecting}} his plantation on horseback, in snow, hail, and freezing rain; that evening, he ate his supper without changing from his wet clothes. He awoke {{the next morning}} with a severe sore throat and became increasingly hoarse as the day progressed, yet still rode out in the heavy snow, marking trees for cutting on the plantation. Some time around 3a.m. <b>that</b> <b>Saturday,</b> he suddenly awoke with severe difficulty breathing and almost completely unable to speak or swallow. He was {{a firm believer in}} bloodletting, which was a standard medical practice of that era, and he had used it to treat various ailments of slaves on his plantation. He ordered estate overseer Albin Rawlins to remove nearly a pint of his blood.|$|E
5|$|Many USGS {{scientists}} {{worked on}} the team monitoring the volcano, but it was graduate student Harry Glicken who had been manning the ColdwaterII observation post for the {{two and a half}} weeks immediately preceding the eruption. The evening before the eruption he was scheduled to be relieved by USGS geologist Don Swanson in order to visit the graduate school at the University of California. Swanson, however, wanted to meet with a German graduate student who was returning to Germany on May 18. Two days before the eruption, Swanson ran into Johnston in the hallway and asked him to take his place. Johnston hesitantly agreed to man the base for one day. <b>That</b> <b>Saturday,</b> the day before the eruption took place, Johnston ascended the mountain and went on a patrol of the volcano with geologist Carolyn Driedger. Tremors shook the mountain. Driedger was supposed to camp on one of the ridges overlooking the volcano that night, but Johnston told her to head home and said that he would stay on the volcano alone. While at ColdwaterII, Johnston was to observe the volcano for any further signs of an eruption. Just prior to his departure, at 7p.m. on the evening of May 17, 13½ hours before the eruption, Glicken took the famous photograph of Johnston sitting by the observation post trailer with a notebook on his lap, smiling.|$|E

25|$|The {{competition}} challenge changes each year, and {{the teams}} can only reuse certain components from previous years. The robots weigh at most , without batteries and bumpers.

In addition to that, teams are allowed to spend another $3,500 on their robot. The purpose of this rule is to lessen the influence of money on teams' competitiveness. Details of the game have been released on the first Saturday in January (except when <b>that</b> <b>Saturday</b> falls on January 1 or 2), and the teams have been given six weeks to construct a robot that can accomplish the game's tasks.|$|E

25|$|The extreme {{reaction}} to Mr Bigley's murder is {{fed by the}} fact that he was a Liverpudlian. Liverpool is a handsome city with a tribal sense of community. A combination of economic misfortune—its docks were, fundamentally, on the wrong side of England when Britain entered what is now the European Union—and an excessive predilection for welfarism have created a peculiar, and deeply unattractive, psyche among many Liverpudlians. They see themselves whenever possible as victims, and resent their victim status; yet at the same time they wallow in it. Part of this flawed psychological state is that they cannot accept that they might have made any contribution to their misfortunes, but seek rather to blame someone else for it, thereby deepening their sense of shared tribal grievance against the rest of society. The deaths of more than 50 Liverpool football supporters at Hillsborough in 1989 was undeniably a greater tragedy than the single death, however horrible, of Mr Bigley; but that is no excuse for Liverpool's failure to acknowledge, even to this day, the part played in the disaster by drunken fans at the back of the crowd who mindlessly tried to fight their way into the ground <b>that</b> <b>Saturday</b> afternoon. The police became a convenient scapegoat, and the Sun newspaper a whipping-boy for daring, albeit in a tasteless fashion, to hint at the wider causes of the incident.|$|E
25|$|Nine-year-old Cassie Logan {{is walking}} {{to school with}} her {{siblings}} Stacey (twelve years old), Christopher-John (seven years old), and Little Man whose real name is Clayton Chester Logan (six years old) in rural Mississippi. Cassie talks about the land on which the Logan family lives. It belonged to Harlan Granger, but he sold 2000 acres of it in 1886 to cover his taxes during Reconstruction. Their grandfather bought two hundred acres in 1887, then another two hundred acres in 1918. After several miles of walking, T.J. Avery and his brother appear. The Avery family sharecrop on the Granger plantation. At school, Cassie and Little Man go to their classroom, where Cassie's teacher, Daisy Crocker, gives them their textbooks, worn-out, outdated castoffs from the white school with a chart that says only white kids used these books up until they were in bad condition, indicating their future uses are intended only for black students. Crocker meets with Cassie's mother, Mary, who calmly glues {{a piece of paper}} over the chart containing the racist indicator in all the books. She hands them back to a dumbstruck Crocker. <b>That</b> <b>Saturday</b> their father, David Logan, comes home from his railroad job in Louisiana, bringing with him L.T. Morrison to assist in planting, farming, protection and other jobs, as Morrison was fired from the railroad for a fight that was the white men's fault. Papa leaves the next day to catch a train.|$|E

Repeats {{of the episode}} began <b>that</b> <b>Saturday</b> at 7:30 p.m. The episode received a Nielsen Rating of 3.1, with a 4.8% share of American audiences, making it the sixth most-watched American telecast of the week. According to Catherine Mullally, Vice President and Executive Producer of Nickelodeon Video and Audio Works in 1995, the episode was the highest Nielsen-rated telecast in the network's history. The episode was supplanted as Nickelodeon's most-viewed in 1998, by another Rugrats special, when the Thanksgiving episode [...] "The Turkey Who Came to Dinner" [...] attracted 3.7 million viewers (9.4/28).|$|E
500|$|Through {{the early}} hours of <b>that</b> <b>Saturday,</b> July 21, many from the 6th Regiment deserted, until only 11 were left, who were then {{incorporated}} into the ranks of the 5th.

Toward nightfall, a battery of artillery was stationed at the depot.|$|E
500|$|Lemmie Quinn, foreman of {{the metal}} room, testified that he spoke briefly with Frank {{in his office at}} 12:20. Frank had not {{mentioned}} Quinn when the police first interviewed him about his whereabouts at noontime on April 26. Frank had said at the coroner's inquest that Quinn arrived less than ten minutes after Phagan had left his office, and during the murder trial said Quinn arrived hardly five minutes after Phagan left. According to Conley and several experts called by the defense, it would have taken at least thirty minutes to murder Phagan, take the body to the basement, return to the office, and write the murder notes. By the defense's calculations, Frank's time was fully accounted for from 11:30a.m. to 1:30p.m., except for eighteen minutes between 12:02 and 12:20. Hattie Hall, a stenographer, said at trial that Frank had specifically requested that she come in <b>that</b> <b>Saturday</b> and that Frank had been working in his office from 11:00 to nearly noon. The prosecution labeled Quinn's testimony as [...] "a fraud" [...] and reminded the jury that early in the police investigation Frank had not mentioned Quinn.|$|E

500|$|While sources {{agree the}} name is a {{reference}} to North Texas' athletics teams, the Mean Green, there are conflicting accounts as to how, when, and why Greene received his [...] "Mean Greene" [...] nickname. When he first arrived at North Texas, the university's moniker was the Eagles. In 1966, Greene's first year on the varsity team, the team adopted the [...] "Mean Green" [...] moniker. Two possible origins of the nickname are two separate cheers that supposedly developed independently during North Texas' 1966 game against UTEP. One cheer was by Sidney Sue Graham, wife of the North Texas sports information director. In response to a tackle by Greene, she blurted out, [...] "That’s the way, Mean Greene!" [...] Bill Mercer, former North Texas play-by-play announcer, states Graham's thought behind the nickname was the Mean Green defense. Meanwhile, in the student section, North Texas basketball players Willie Davis and Ira Daniels, unsatisfied with the unenthusiastic crowd, began to sing, [...] "Mean Green, you look so good to me". The rest of the crowd soon followed. [...] "After that we did it every game," [...] Davis said. [...] "A lot of people later on started associating it with Joe because his last name was Greene, but it actually started with that simple chant <b>that</b> <b>Saturday</b> night at Fouts Field.

500|$|The school’s {{refusal to}} play Ward in the Georgia Tech game later {{became part of}} the public legacy of President Gerald R. Ford. Ward {{recalled}} that he met “my man Jerry” during freshman orientation in 1932, and the two became friends and roommates when the football team traveled for road games. When Ford learned that the school had capitulated to Georgia Tech, some accounts indicate that he [...] "quit the team" [...] or threatened to quit in order [...] "to make a statement and take a stand because Willis Ward was his friend." [...] Ford wrote about the Georgia Tech incident in his autobiography, recalling that he felt the decision to keep Willis out of the game was [...] "morally wrong." [...] “I went to Willis himself. He urged me to play. [...] ‘Look,’ he said, ‘the team’s having a bad year. We’ve lost two games already and we probably won’t win any more. You’ve got to play Saturday. You owe it to the team.’ [...] I decided he was right. <b>That</b> <b>Saturday</b> afternoon, we hit like never before and beat Georgia Tech 9–2.” [...] Years later, Ford wrote that the Ward incident had influenced his thinking about race. Ford noted: “His sacrifice led me to question how educational administrators could capitulate to raw prejudice.” [...] Ford used the story to voice his support for U-M’s affirmative action admissions policy saying, “Do we really want to risk turning back the clock to an era when the Willis Wards were isolated and penalized for the color of their skin, their economic standing or national ancestry?” ...|$|E
