5|$|For choreographer, Bergstein chose Kenny Ortega, who {{had been}} trained by Gene Kelly. For a location, they did not find {{anything}} suitable in <b>the</b> <b>Catskills</b> (as many of the resorts had been shut down at that point), so they decided {{on a combination of}} two locations: Lake Lure, North Carolina and the Mountain Lake Hotel near Newport, Virginia, and with careful editing made it look like all shooting was done in the same area.|$|E
5|$|After {{one block}} of Main Street, NY32 and NY212 turn onto Market Street, then east onto Ulster Avenue after another block. As it crosses the {{railroad}} tracks and leaves the village, the road widens and becomes a commercial highway just before reaching a Thruway exit. This, the fourth time NY32 has crossed the Thruway, {{is the first time}} it does so at an exit. Beyond the overpass, the concurrency ends when NY32 turns and heads north once again. A tight nearby on-ramp provides access to the southbound Thruway. NY32 does not enter <b>the</b> <b>Catskills</b> but provides access to them along this stretch.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Catskill</b> Center for Conservation and Development, usually {{referred}} to as <b>the</b> <b>Catskill</b> Center, is a not-for-profit organization based in Arkville, New York, United States. It works to preserve the natural environment of <b>the</b> <b>Catskill</b> region and foster sustainable economic development in it.|$|R
50|$|Lexington {{is within}} <b>the</b> <b>Catskill</b> Mountains and <b>the</b> <b>Catskill</b> Park. <b>The</b> south town {{line is the}} border of Ulster County.|$|R
5|$|As NY22 {{continues}} north, it remains, at first, {{within a}} mile of Massachusetts, moving to the east to intersect with NY43 in Stephentown. North of that junction, it begins to run through a deep, isolated, lightly populated valley in the New York section of the Berkshires. Wide curves take the road through Berlin, where Berlin Mountain, the highest peak in the state outside of <b>the</b> <b>Catskills</b> and Adirondacks, caps the eastern skyline. Route22 trends further west, then back east to where NY2 crosses via an overpass at Petersburgh on its way to Petersburg Pass, the northernmost crossing of the New York–Massachusetts state line. The next road to head east from NY22, NY346 at North Petersburgh, enters Vermont.|$|E
5|$|NY23 {{has three}} {{distinct}} sections: its western third in Central New York and the Central New York Region (formerly Leatherstocking), the middle in <b>the</b> <b>Catskills,</b> {{and east of}} the Hudson River. Most of the route is maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT); however, some sections are either locally maintained or owned by other agencies. In the city of Norwich, NY23 is entirely city-owned and maintained. Farther east {{in the city of}} Oneonta, the route is city-maintained from the western city line to James F. Lettis Highway. Finally, the Rip Van Winkle Bridge and its approaches are maintained by the New York State Bridge Authority (NYSBA).|$|E
25|$|Climatically, <b>the</b> <b>Catskills</b> {{lie within}} the Allegheny Highlands forests ecoregion.|$|E
50|$|The town {{is inside}} <b>the</b> <b>Catskill</b> Park, {{and it is}} entirely mountainous. Within it lies Slide Mountain, <b>the</b> <b>Catskill</b> Mountains' highest peak.|$|R
5|$|There {{are also}} several less {{significant}} rock formations in Nescopeck Creek's watershed. These include the Spechty Kopf Formation, the Hamilton Formation, and <b>the</b> <b>Catskill</b> Formation. Little is understood about the Spechty Kopf Formation, but it occurs between <b>the</b> <b>Catskill</b> and Pocono Formations. <b>The</b> <b>Catskill</b> Formation is grayish-red shale, siltstone, and sandstone.|$|R
50|$|North Mountain is a peak in <b>the</b> <b>Catskill</b> Mountains of New York, on {{the border}} between <b>the</b> towns of <b>Catskill</b> and Hunter, in Greene County. It is part of <b>the</b> <b>Catskill</b> Escarpment.|$|R
25|$|Tremper has {{a typical}} {{assortment}} of animal life for <b>the</b> <b>Catskills.</b> Herbivores such as white-tailed deer, chipmunks and porcupines dominate {{the lower end}} of the food chain, with predators like fishers and black bear at the top. The ledges in the former quarry are one of the few rattlesnake habitats in <b>the</b> <b>Catskills</b> close to a hiking trail, with at least one confirmed den, and visitors should exercise caution if they wish to explore it.|$|E
25|$|High Peak stands {{slightly}} {{apart from}} other major peaks in <b>the</b> <b>Catskills,</b> squarely {{in the middle of}} the Catskill Escarpment, the sudden rise of the peaks from the Hudson Valley floor. From the valley, it is easy to understand how it came to be seen as the highest peak in <b>the</b> <b>Catskills,</b> since there are no higher peaks close to it. It is bracketed by the only two gaps in the Escarpment — Platte Clove to the south and Kaaterskill Clove to the north.|$|E
25|$|Iuzzini {{was born}} August 31, 1974, {{and raised in}} <b>the</b> <b>Catskills</b> region of New York. His father was a {{plumbing}} and heating technician, his mother a veterinarian assistant and wildlife rehabilitator.|$|E
50|$|In {{contrast}} to the Adirondack Park, <b>the</b> <b>Catskill</b> Park does not include all the land {{generally considered to be}} part of <b>the</b> <b>Catskill</b> Range. However, all but two of <b>the</b> 35 <b>Catskill</b> High Peaks are inside the Blue Line.|$|R
50|$|The county, {{which starts}} about 70 miles {{northwest}} of New York City, is in <b>the</b> <b>Catskill</b> Mountains. Its northeastern corner is within <b>the</b> <b>Catskill</b> Park.|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>Catskill</b> Escarpment, often {{referred}} to locally as just the Escarpment or the Great Wall of Manitou, and known as <b>the</b> <b>Catskill</b> Front to geologists, is the range forming the northeastern corner of <b>the</b> <b>Catskill</b> Mountains in Greene and Ulster counties in the U.S. state of New York. It rises very abruptly from the Hudson Valley to summits above [...] in elevation, including three of <b>the</b> <b>Catskill</b> High Peaks, with almost no foothills. The plateau {{to the south and}} west averages [...] above sea level.|$|R
25|$|Treasure hunters meet {{annually}} in <b>the</b> <b>Catskills</b> {{to search for}} the safe. One such meeting was documented in the documentary film Digging for Dutch: The Search for the Lost Treasure of Dutch Schultz.|$|E
25|$|According to Catskill forest {{historian}} Michael Kudish, the Slide wilderness {{contains the}} most extensive tract of first-growth forest in <b>the</b> <b>Catskills.</b> Much of the area remained out of reach during the peak years of logging and barkpeeling from eastern hemlock trees, to make tannin for leather production in the mid-19th century and thus remained largely untouched. Indeed, the upper valley of the East Branch of the Neversink, located centrally within the SMWA, is the only completely wild valley in <b>the</b> <b>Catskills.</b> It is possible to look out over it from several points on the surrounding mountains and see no evidence of civilization.|$|E
25|$|The {{mountain}} {{was first}} known as Timothyberg, {{in the vernacular}} of the early Dutch settlers of <b>the</b> <b>Catskills.</b> The area was first settled in the 1780s. Its location near the creeks and valleys made it ideal for barkpeeling, the first major industry of <b>the</b> <b>Catskills.</b> Bark from the many eastern hemlocks on its slopes was {{a rich source of}} tannin, and leather hides were often brought to the region to be tanned. The creek valley made it possible to easily transport them to and from the Hudson River at Kingston to the east, and the later development of the Ulster and Delaware Railroad (UDRR) made it even easier. The road up {{the south side of the}} mountain, which forest historian Michael Kudish calls the best example of an extant bark road in <b>the</b> <b>Catskills,</b> was built for this purpose. By the end of the century, since a synthetic process for creating tannin had made it less necessary to harvest large acres of forest, it was being used for quarrying instead.|$|E
50|$|The town is in <b>the</b> <b>Catskill</b> Mountains {{and partly}} within <b>the</b> <b>Catskill</b> State Park. Batavia Kill, a {{tributary}} of Schoharie Creek, flows to the west through Windham.|$|R
50|$|Vivian Fine's Dancing Winds is a {{composition}} for wind quintet that {{was completed in}} 1987 to a commission by <b>the</b> <b>Catskill</b> Conservatory for <b>the</b> <b>Catskill</b> Wind Quintet.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Catskill</b> Aqueduct, {{part of the}} New York City {{water supply}} system, brings water from <b>the</b> <b>Catskill</b> Mountains to Yonkers where it connects {{to other parts of}} the system.|$|R
25|$|The {{streams of}} <b>the</b> <b>Catskills,</b> {{including}} those in this wilderness, are famous for their trout, and the brook, brown and rainbow varieties can be found here, although not in sufficient numbers to allow for intensive fishing.|$|E
25|$|The Escarpment is {{considered}} {{the only place in}} <b>the</b> <b>Catskills</b> where the region's boundary is distinct and unambiguous. In other directions the slow descent of the mountains into the hills of the Allegheny Plateau leads to arbitrary delineations of the range's extent.|$|E
25|$|The {{fire damage}} and steep slope have {{also led to}} {{a small patch of}} boreal forest growing on the Hunter side of NY214 as it ascends into Stony Clove Notch. The {{elevation}} there is around , far lower than such forests are usually found in <b>the</b> <b>Catskills.</b>|$|E
50|$|Located in the {{northern}} tier of <b>the</b> <b>Catskill</b> mountains, settlement was not facilitated by terrain. <b>The</b> <b>Catskill</b> Creek, which flows through Livingstonville, is too shallow to allow significant travel.|$|R
50|$|Hardenburgh sits in {{the western}} corner of the county, {{bordering}} Sullivan and Delaware counties, deep in <b>the</b> <b>Catskill</b> Mountains. Five of <b>the</b> <b>Catskill</b> High Peaks are within or along its borders.|$|R
50|$|Andes {{is located}} in southeastern Delaware County on {{the western edge of}} <b>the</b> <b>Catskill</b> Mountains. <b>The</b> south town line is the border of Ulster County. Andes is partly in <b>the</b> <b>Catskill</b> Park.|$|R
25|$|Note {{that even}} though they all {{resulted}} from the Grenville orogeny, neither the Adirondacks (now uplifted by a hot spot) nor <b>the</b> <b>Catskills</b> or Poconos (a dissected plateau formed from delta deposits) {{are part of the}} Appalachian Mountain chain (faulted and folded by continental collisions).|$|E
25|$|Jews, {{most of them}} {{originally}} {{immigrants from}} Germany, began arriving in <b>the</b> <b>Catskills</b> and Mountaindale {{in the early years}} of the 20th century. They either began farming the area or opening summer resorts for their co-religionists, since Jews were then excluded from existing Catskill resorts.|$|E
25|$|Agudas Achim's steep {{gabled roof}} and arched windows are both unusual {{features}} on synagogues, reflecting the meetinghouse {{tradition of the}} older Baptist and Presbyterian churches in <b>the</b> <b>Catskills.</b> The raised sanctuary with wide front steps leading to the entrance is seen on many other synagogues in the county.|$|E
50|$|The Delaware County railbed from Highmount to Bloomville, a {{distance}} of 45 mi, is owned by <b>the</b> <b>Catskill</b> Revitalization Corporation. <b>The</b> track ends at Hubbell Corners, where it becomes <b>the</b> <b>Catskill</b> Scenic Trail.|$|R
5000|$|Halcott Mountain [...] - [...] A {{mountain}} east of {{the town}} in <b>the</b> <b>Catskill</b> Park. It is one of <b>the</b> <b>Catskill</b> High Peaks. <b>The</b> summit {{and much of the}} mountain are actually in Lexington.|$|R
50|$|Rusk Mountain is a peak {{located in}} the towns of Jewett and Lexington in Greene County, New York, United States. At 3,680 feet (1,121 m) in elevation, it is the 20th-highest peak in <b>the</b> <b>Catskill</b> Mountains and {{considered}} a member of <b>the</b> <b>Catskill</b> High Peaks. While there is no maintained trail, a bushwhack to the summit is considered relatively easy, and required for membership in <b>the</b> <b>Catskill</b> Mountain 3500 Club.|$|R
