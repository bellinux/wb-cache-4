40|$|The {{synthesis}} of 1, 3, 5 -triamino- 2, 4, 6 -trinitrobenzene (TATB) from <b>trichlorotrinitrobenzene</b> (TCTNB) in toluene and ammonium hydroxide solution {{under the influence}} of ultrasonic waves was investigated. When the two-phase reaction mixture was irradiated with high intensity ultrasound at ambient temperature, fine-particle TATB (FP-TATB) was produced. This sonochemically produced TATB powder is lemon color in appearance and was analyzed to have the same explosive properties as reported in the literature. That is, it is insensitive to impact stimuli, and thermally stable. The median particle diameter of FP-TATB was calculated to be around 14 {mu}m, and the powder can be pressed to a density of 1. 82 g/cm{sup 3 } without a binder. The amination process is simple and requires neither the monitoring of the ammonia gas pressure nor the controlling of the reaction temperature during amination reaction, and we anticipate no problem in large scale production of FP-TATB...|$|E
