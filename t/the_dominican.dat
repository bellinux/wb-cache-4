5|$|Coinciding {{with the}} {{issuance}} of the first advisory on the tropical depression, the government of <b>the</b> <b>Dominican</b> Republic issued a tropical storm watch from Barahona to its border with Haiti, while a tropical storm watch was issued from Haiti's border with <b>the</b> <b>Dominican</b> Republic westward to Port-au-Prince. The United States' National Hurricane Center in Miami recommended interests in eastern Cuba to monitor {{the progress of the}} storm. When the depression was 205miles (330km) south-southeast of Santo Domingo, <b>the</b> <b>Dominican</b> Republic issued a tropical storm warning from Punta Palenque to its border with Haiti. While located 155miles (250km) from the coast of Hispaniola, the government of <b>the</b> <b>Dominican</b> Republic extended the tropical storm warning eastward to Isla Saona, while the government of Haiti upgraded its watch area to a tropical storm warning along the coast. The National Hurricane Center also recommended citizens in the Bahamas to monitor the progress of the storm. After the heavy rainfall began in <b>the</b> <b>Dominican</b> Republic, officials evacuated citizens of low-lying areas.|$|E

50|$|On {{the basis}} of his record, Oldebourg concludes that Raymond was a “fanatic”. Later in 1235 <b>the</b> <b>Dominicans</b> were {{required}} to leave Count Raymond’s territories, the Bishop with them, and he left Toulouse in the midst of popular unrest. <b>The</b> <b>Dominicans</b> withdrew to Carcassonne. Bishop Raymond went to Rome, to appeal to Pope Gregory IX for help; the Pope wrote putting pressure on Count Raymond, and <b>the</b> <b>Dominicans</b> negotiated a return to Toulouse in 1236.|$|R
25|$|<b>Dominican</b> Friary. <b>The</b> <b>Dominicans</b> were {{established}} in Carlingford in 1305 primarily because of their patron Richard Óg de Burgh, 2nd Earl of Ulster, with the friary itself being dedicated to St. Malachy. Dissolved in 1540 by Henry VIII, it became the centre of a repossession struggle between <b>the</b> <b>Dominicans</b> and Franciscans in the 1670s. It was resolved in favour of <b>the</b> <b>Dominicans</b> by Oliver Plunkett. However, the friary itself was subsequently abandoned in the 18th century by <b>the</b> <b>Dominicans</b> to their present location of Dundalk. The remains today consist of a nave and chancel divided by a tower. Also, there are possible remains of some domestic buildings to the south like a mill, mill race and mill pond.|$|R

5|$|For decades Haitians {{have been}} {{crossing}} the Haitian-Dominican border for various reasons, including voluntary and involuntary migration, long- and short-term residence in <b>the</b> <b>Dominican</b> Republic, {{legal and illegal}} entry, smuggling, and human trafficking. Haitians move across the Haitian-Dominican border in search of opportunities and they are highly vulnerable to exploitation. In fact, <b>the</b> <b>Dominican</b> Republic {{has one of the}} worst records of human rights abuses, including human trafficking, against migrant workers in all of the Caribbean. Haitians in <b>the</b> <b>Dominican</b> Republic are widely disparaged as a migrant minority because of the countries' proximity. During the dictatorial reign of Jean-Claude Duvalier in the 1970s and 80s, he sold Haitians at bulk rates to work on sugar plantations in <b>the</b> <b>Dominican</b> Republic.|$|E
5|$|In April 1965, Yancey {{was ordered}} to <b>the</b> <b>Dominican</b> Republic to support Operation Power Pack, the code name for the United States' {{intervention}} in <b>the</b> <b>Dominican</b> Republic. The attack cargo ship arrived at Santo Domingo, the capital city, on 30 April. Yancey loaded nearly 600 evacuees from 21 nations. Among those on board the ship were the daughter of William Tapley Bennett Jr., the United States Ambassador to <b>the</b> <b>Dominican</b> Republic; the Belgian Ambassador to <b>the</b> <b>Dominican</b> Republic; sixteen nuns from <b>the</b> <b>Dominican</b> Order; and several large families. Yanceys officers and crew vacated their quarters to allow room for female passengers and children, and many slept on the decks of the ship during the passage to San Juan, Puerto Rico. One of the passengers gave birth during the short trip, and gave her son the middle name of Yancey {{in honor of the}} ship.|$|E
5|$|Nine {{people were}} killed in <b>the</b> <b>Dominican</b> Republic: two {{fishermen}} went missing at sea during the storm and the others were swept away by flood waters when rivers burst their banks in Guaricanos and Puerto Plata.

50|$|Briefly before 1600 Portuguese traders left Solor {{and settled}} in Larantuka.

5|$|In 1542, the New Laws {{were issued}} {{with the aim}} of {{protecting}} the indigenous peoples of the Spanish colonies from their overexploitation by the encomenderos. Friar Bartolomé de las Casas and his followers left Spain in July 1544 to enforce the New Laws. Las Casas arrived in Ciudad Real with 16 fellow Dominicans on 12 March 1545. <b>The</b> <b>Dominicans</b> were <b>the</b> first religious order to attempt the evangelisation of the native population. Their arrival meant that the colonists were no longer free to treat the natives as they saw fit without the risk of intervention by the religious authorities. <b>The</b> <b>Dominicans</b> soon came into conflict with the established colonists. Colonial opposition to <b>the</b> <b>Dominicans</b> was such that <b>the</b> <b>Dominicans</b> were forced to flee Ciudad Real in fear of their lives. They established themselves nearby in two indigenous villages, the old site of Villa Real de Chiapa and Cinacantlán. From Villa Real, Bartolomé de las Casas and his companions prepared for the evangelisation of all the territory that fell within the Bishopric of Chiapa. <b>The</b> <b>Dominicans</b> promoted <b>the</b> veneration of Santiago Matamoros (St. James the Moor-slayer) as a readily identifiable image of Spanish military superiority. <b>The</b> <b>Dominicans</b> soon saw <b>the</b> need to reestablish themselves in Ciudad Real, and the hostilities with the colonists were calmed. In 1547, the first stone for <b>the</b> new <b>Dominican</b> convent in Ciudad Real was placed.|$|R

He also became the commercial representative of <b>the</b> <b>Dominican</b> government in Paris, Bern and London. At one time Betances attempted to be a venture capital partner on a failed enterprise that attempted to commercialize the use of Samaná Bay to benefit <b>the</b> <b>Dominican</b> Republic, and also to prevent foreign interests (particularly the United States) from taking over the bay, which was considered a primary strategic geographical feature of Hispaniola, in both commercial and military terms.|$|E

5|$|In 1869, Grant {{proposed}} to annex the independent largely black nation of <b>the</b> <b>Dominican</b> Republic, {{then known as}} Santo Domingo. Previously in 1868, President Andrew Johnson had attempted to annex <b>the</b> <b>Dominican</b> Republic and Santo Domingo, but the House of Representatives defeated two resolutions {{for the protection of}} <b>the</b> <b>Dominican</b> Republic and Santo Domingo and for the annexation of <b>the</b> <b>Dominican</b> Republic. In July, 1869 Grant sent Orville E. Babcock and Rufus Ingalls who negotiated a draft treaty with Dominican Republic President Buenaventura Báez for the annexation of Santo Domingo to the United States and the sale of Samaná Bay for $2million. To keep the island nation and Báez secure in power, Grant ordered naval ships, unauthorized by Congress, to secure the island from invasion and internal insurrection. Báez signed an annexation treaty on November 19, 1869 offered by Babcock under federal State department authorization. Secretary Fish drew up a final draft of the proposal and offered $1.5million to <b>the</b> <b>Dominican</b> national debt, the annexation of Santo Domingo as an American state, the United States' acquisition of the rights for Samaná Bay for 50 years with an annual $150,000 rental, and guaranteed protection from foreign intervention. On January 10, 1870 the Santo Domingo treaty was submitted to the Senate for ratification. Despite his support of the annexation, Grant made the mistakes of not informing Congress of the treaty or encouraging national acceptance and enthusiasm.|$|E
