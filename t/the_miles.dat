5|$|In the 18th {{century the}} gorge was quarried to produce {{building}} stone for the city. Stone {{was taken by}} boat into the floating harbour. In the 19th century celestine was discovered in Leigh Court estate and <b>the</b> <b>Miles</b> family authorised quarrying. Between 1880 and 1920 Bristol was producing 90% of the world's Celestine, but the enterprise {{did not last long}} into the 20th century. Bristol Diamonds, brilliant quartz crystals found in geodes in dolomitic conglomerate in the gorge, were popular souvenirs for visitors to the Hotwells spa in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Quarries on the Bristol side of the gorge are now popular with climbers and are a habitat for Peregrine falcons and other wildlife.|$|E

In 1884 the second Baronet, Sir Sir Philip Miles, entertained the Prince of Wales, later Edward VII.|$|E
5|$|Miles {{purchased}} the art collection of Richard Hart Davis and others.

5|$|Because he owed few favors to the state's {{established}} politicians, many of Brown's top appointees were businesspeople. Keeping {{a campaign}} promise {{to appoint a}} woman and an African-American to his cabinet, Brown named William E. McAnulty Jr., and Jacqueline Swigart to his cabinet. McAnulty resigned his post {{as secretary of the}} state's Department of Justice within one month, saying the position would keep him from spending enough time with his family. Brown re-appointed McAnulty to his former position as a judge with the Jefferson County District Court and replaced him with another African-American, George W. Wilson. He also appointed Viola Davis Brown as Executive Director of the Office of Public Health Nursing – in 1980, she was the first African-American nurse to lead a state office of public health nursing in the U.S. His most controversial appointment was Frank Metts, his secretary of transportation. Metts broke with political tradition in Kentucky, announcing that contracts would be awarded on the basis of competitive bids and performance rather than political patronage. Despite cutting personnel from the department, Metts doubled <b>the</b> <b>miles</b> of road that were resurfaced.|$|E

5000|$|With qualifiers, [...] "mile" [...] is {{also used}} to {{describe}} or translate a wide range of units derived from or roughly equivalent to <b>the</b> Roman <b>mile,</b> such as <b>the</b> nautical <b>mile</b> (now 1.852 km exactly), <b>the</b> Italian <b>mile</b> (roughly 1.852 km), and <b>the</b> Chinese <b>mile</b> (now 500 m exactly). The Romans divided their mile into 5,000 feet but the greater importance of furlongs in pre-modern England meant that <b>the</b> statute <b>mile</b> was made equivalent to 8 furlongs or 5,280 feet in 1593. This form of <b>the</b> <b>mile</b> then spread to the British-colonized nations who continue to employ <b>the</b> <b>mile.</b> <b>The</b> US Geological Survey now employs the metre for official purposes but legacy data from its 1927 geodetic datum has meant that a separate US survey mile ( [...] km) continues to see some use. While most countries replaced <b>the</b> <b>mile</b> with <b>the</b> kilometre when switching to the International System of Units, <b>the</b> international <b>mile</b> continues to be used in some countries, such as Liberia, Myanmar, the United Kingdom, the United States, and a number of countries with fewer than one million inhabitants, most of which are UK or US territories, or have close historical ties with the UK or US.|$|R

25|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, the {{demographic}} shift in Union-Miles Park was largely complete. The heart of this community was centered at Aetna Road and E. 93rd Street, where the majority of Poles and Slovaks began settling about 1890. Whereas once the area had been dominated by descendants of New England Yankees and by Irish, Scottish, and Welsh immigrants, the neighborhood was overwhelmingly populated by immigrant Poles and Slovaks by 1900. To accommodate the large number of children in these immigrant families, <b>the</b> <b>Miles</b> School (not to be confused with <b>the</b> <b>Miles</b> Park School) opened in September 1899 just outside the southeast boundary of the Union-Miles Park neighborhood at E. 119th Street and Miles Avenue.|$|E
