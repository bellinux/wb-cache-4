5|$|The use of lethal {{force on}} the Berlin Wall was an {{integral}} part of <b>the</b> <b>East</b> <b>German</b> state's policy towards its border system. Nonetheless, <b>the</b> <b>East</b> <b>German</b> government was well aware that border killings had undesirable consequences. The West German, US, British and French authorities protested killings when they occurred and the international reputation of East Germany was damaged as a result. It also undermined <b>the</b> <b>East</b> <b>German</b> government's support at home.|$|E
5|$|After the war {{he played}} an {{important}} role in the political scene of East Germany. Before the establishment of an East German state he was the chairman of the German Economic Commission, the precursor to <b>the</b> <b>East</b> <b>German</b> government. Subsequently, he became chairman of the National Planning Commission of East Germany and a deputy chairman of <b>the</b> <b>East</b> <b>German</b> Council of Ministers. He was a leading economic politician and diplomat of East Germany and led various ministries at different times. Within East Germany's ruling Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) he was a member of the party's CC Politburo.|$|E

5|$|The small pro-democracy Monday demonstrations soon swelled into {{crowds of}} {{hundreds}} of thousands of people in cities across East Germany. <b>The</b> <b>East</b> <b>German</b> leadership considered using force but ultimately backed down, lacking support from the Soviet Union for a violent Tiananmen Square-style military intervention. Reformist members of <b>the</b> <b>East</b> <b>German</b> Politbüro sought to rescue the situation by forcing the resignation of the hardline Party chairman Erich Honecker, replacing him in October 1989 with the marginally less hardline Egon Krenz.|$|E
5|$|After the German reunification, <b>the</b> <b>East</b> <b>German</b> {{football}} association {{joined the}} DFB. <b>The</b> <b>East</b> <b>German</b> women's national football team had played only one official international match, losing 0–3 to Czechoslovakia {{in a friendly}} match on 9 May 1990. The unified German team defended their title successfully at the 1991 European Championship. After winning all games in the qualifying group, Germany again met Italy in the semi-final, this time winning 3–0. On 14 July 1991, the German team once more faced Norway in the final. The game went to extra time, during which Heidi Mohr and Silvia Neid scored for Germany and secured the 3–1 victory.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, <b>the</b> <b>East</b> <b>German</b> {{leadership}} considered {{proposals to}} replace the expensive and intrusive fortifications with a high-technology system codenamed Grenze 2000. Drawing on technology used by the Soviet Army during the Soviet–Afghan War, it would have replaced the fences with sensors and detectors. However, the plan was never implemented.|$|E

25|$|Several BFS {{personnel}} were honoured for their work. Jack Owen, a BFS officer and former Royal Marine, was awarded an MBE in 1963 following a tense incident at Bohldamm near Lüchow in Lower Saxony. The border ran along a stream, but its precise location was disputed. The West Germans considered {{the far side}} of the stream to be the location of the border, while <b>the</b> <b>East</b> <b>Germans</b> regarded <b>the</b> border as lying in the middle of the stream. An overgrown cobbled footbridge crossed the stream but was blocked by <b>the</b> <b>East</b> <b>Germans</b> with a movable barbed wire trestle barrier situated at the far end of the bridge. One day in 1962 <b>the</b> <b>East</b> <b>Germans</b> moved <b>the</b> barrier to the middle of the bridge, despite protests from West German border guards and customs officials. The situation escalated when <b>the</b> <b>East</b> <b>Germans</b> warned that they would shoot anyone who touched the trestle and backed up their warning by emplacing machine guns and armoured cars on their side of the stream. The West Germans called up a BFS platoon and a British Army section to back them up. Owen called <b>the</b> <b>East</b> Germans' bluff by walking onto the bridge with two British soldiers and carrying the trestle back to the eastern side of the stream. He then stood by it for the next eight hours to make sure that it would not be moved again.|$|R
5|$|In an {{interview}} with Reagan himself, he recalls <b>the</b> <b>East</b> <b>German</b> police not allowing people to get near the wall, which prevented the citizens from experiencing the speech at all. The fact that West German police acted {{in a similar way}} has however seldom been noted in accounts such as these.|$|E
5|$|Likewise in 1949, {{the ruling}} SED {{implemented}} traditional leadership structures of communist parties and Rau {{became a member}} of the newly established Central Committee of the SED and candidate member of its Politburo; in 1950 he became a full member of the Politburo as well as deputy chairman of <b>the</b> <b>East</b> <b>German</b> Council of Ministers.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>East</b> <b>German</b> {{government}} {{sought to}} define {{the country as a}} legitimate state in its own right and portrayed West Germany as enemy territory (feindliches Ausland)– a capitalist, semi-fascist state that exploited its citizens, sought to regain the lost territories of the Third Reich, and stood opposed to the peaceful socialism of the GDR.|$|E
40|$|In 1990 {{when the}} GDR and FRG were united, {{there was a}} lot of {{optimism}} about the future of the new state. However, after few years after this historical event, both West and <b>East</b> <b>Germans</b> felt disillusioned by the transformation process. The sensation of <b>the</b> <b>East</b> <b>Germans</b> was named GDR-nostalgia or the so called Ostalgie, nostalgic longing for the former GDR. This feeling was rooted both in the objective socio-economic situation and in the feeling of loss in the biographies of <b>the</b> <b>East</b> <b>Germans.</b> This paper deals with the political dimension of the GDR-nostalgia, focusing on the political party PDS, a successor party of the communist state party SED. Despite the pessimistic prophecies about the PDS the party was growing steadily in <b>the</b> <b>East.</b> <b>The</b> <b>East</b> <b>Germans</b> felt that <b>the</b> party represents their particular interests in the united Germany. Yet the PDS didn't use a chance to deal critically with its controversial history. The hypothesis is, that the party, by presenting an idealistic version of the GDR past to the public and their potential voters, tried to strengthen the nostalgia feeling in order to gain votes. To prove the thesis the structure of the party, its program and history institutions will be examined. The concept of politics of memory will be described...|$|R

5|$|The rivers were as heavily guarded {{as other}} parts of the border. On the Elbe, East Germany {{maintained}} a fleet of about 30 fast patrol boats and West Germany had some 16 customs vessels. The river border was closely watched for escapees, many of whom drowned attempting to cross. Numerous bridges blown up in the closing days of the Second World War remained in ruins, while other surviving bridges were blocked or demolished on <b>the</b> <b>East</b> <b>German</b> side. There were no ferry crossings and river barges were rigorously inspected by the GDR border guards. To prevent escape attempts, <b>the</b> <b>East</b> <b>German</b> river banks were barricaded with a continuous line of metal fences and concrete walls. At one location, Rüterberg on the Elbe, the border fortifications completely surrounded the village and sealed off the inhabitants from the rest of East Germany as well as the West.|$|E
5|$|Around {{half of the}} Grenztruppen were conscripts, a lower {{proportion}} than {{in other}} branches of <b>the</b> <b>East</b> <b>German</b> armed forces. Many potential recruits were screened out as potentially unreliable; for instance, actively religious individuals or those with close relatives in West Germany. They were all subjected to close scrutiny to assure their political reliability and were given intensive ideological indoctrination.|$|E
5|$|Heidemann {{was also}} {{released}} from prison in 1987. Five years later it {{was reported in the}} German newspaper Der Spiegel that in the 1950s he had been recruited by the Stasi, <b>the</b> <b>East</b> <b>German</b> secret police, to monitor the arrival of American nuclear weapons into West Germany. In 2008 he had debts exceeding €700,000, and was living on social security; his situation had not changed by 2013, and he remained bitter about his treatment.|$|E
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>East</b> <b>Germans</b> {{also had}} 360,000 Soviet troops on their soil in 1989; however, North Korea {{has not had}} any foreign troops on its soil since 1955. [...] "East Germany {{collapsed}} because Gorbachev chose to do what none of his predecessors would ever have done, namely, keep those troops in their barracks rather than mobilize them to save the Honecker regime". <b>The</b> <b>East</b> <b>Germans</b> looked favorably {{at the fact that}} West Germans had good retirement benefits, public order and strong civil society, whereas the North Korean citizens are not aware of any immediate benefits from uniting with South Korea, because all such knowledge is kept from them by the state.|$|R

5|$|Prices for the West Berlin S-Bahn {{were kept}} {{slightly}} below the fares of the West Berlin BVG. In East Berlin, a flat fee of 0.20 Mark was charged until 1991. West Berlin politics {{and most of}} the populace fully boycotted the S-Bahn, which was run by <b>the</b> <b>East</b> <b>German</b> railways, and introduced bus and U-Bahn lines running parallel to the S-Bahn network and the Stadtbahn.|$|E
5|$|The time of Rau's German Economic Commission {{ended in}} October 1949 with the {{establishment}} of <b>the</b> <b>East</b> <b>German</b> state, the German Democratic Republic (GDR). The GDR was proclaimed on 7October 1949, at a ceremony in the former Air Ministry Building in Berlin, until then the seat of Rau's organisation. Five days later, the DWK was formally abolished on 12October 1949. Rau thereupon became a delegate of the People's Chamber, the newly established parliament of the GDR and joined the new government.|$|E

On July 24-25, Heddy won bronze medals in the 400 m medley and 400 m freestyle respectively. On July 26, she was part of the silver medal winning 4 × 100 m freestyle relay team. The American team had taken the world record from <b>the</b> <b>east</b> <b>Germans</b> <b>the</b> previous year and swam 1.25 seconds below that mark in the final, but still lost to <b>the</b> <b>east</b> <b>Germans</b> who took back the world record and won the gold. On July 27, Heddy finished fourth in the 100 m freestyle, a mere 1/100 s from the bronze. She had to settle for four medals in total, when summing up her 1975 world championship.|$|R
5000|$|Up until 1952, the {{demarcation}} {{lines between}} <b>East</b> Germany and <b>the</b> western occupied zones {{could be easily}} crossed in most places. On 1 April 1952, <b>East</b> <b>German</b> leaders met <b>the</b> Soviet leader Joseph Stalin in Moscow; during the discussions Stalin's foreign minister Vyacheslav Molotov proposed that <b>the</b> <b>East</b> <b>Germans</b> should [...] "introduce a system of passes for visits of West Berlin residents to <b>the</b> territory of <b>East</b> Berlin as to stop free movement of Western agents" [...] in the GDR. Stalin agreed, calling the situation [...] "intolerable". He advised <b>the</b> <b>East</b> <b>Germans</b> to build up their border defenses, telling them that [...] "The demarcation line between East and West Germany {{should be considered a}} border—and not just any border, but a dangerous one ... The Germans will guard the line of defence with their lives." ...|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> 3.5 million <b>East</b> <b>Germans</b> who {{had left}} by 1961 totaled {{approximately}} 20% of <b>the</b> entire <b>East</b> <b>German</b> population. <b>The</b> emigrants tended to be young and well educated.

5|$|Germany's borders {{underwent}} {{many changes}} during the 20th century, which {{had an effect}} on the make-up of the German football team. After the annexation of Austria, the Austrian team was absorbed into the German team, resulting in the inclusion of several Austrians in Germany's 1938 World Cup squad. After World War II and the break-up of Germany, two breakaway national teams were formed: Saarland (1950–56) and East Germany (1952–90). During this period, the team was commonly known as West Germany until the country's reunification in 1990, when <b>the</b> <b>East</b> <b>German</b> team was reintegrated into the German national team.|$|E
5|$|Haislett was {{the first}} American woman to defeat a swimmer from East Germany in the 100-meter {{freestyle}} since the 1972 Summer Olympics; she did so at the 1990 Goodwill Games in Seattle, Washington. At the 1991 World Aquatics Championships in Perth, Western Australia, Haislett won the 100-meter freestyle, and swam the anchor legs for the winning U.S. teams in the 4×100-meter freestyle and the 4×100-meter medley relays, ending <b>the</b> <b>East</b> <b>German</b> women's eighteen years of overwhelming dominance in the 100-meter freestyle at the world championships. Haislett also endured the emotional agony of disqualifying her team on an early exchange in the 4×200-meter freestyle relay – a relay race that the American women won in the water.|$|E
5|$|Krüger hid at {{his home}} until November 1946 when he handed himself over to the British authorities. Forging an enemy's {{currency}} was not a war crime; he faced no charges. He was detained until early 1947 when he was {{handed over to the}} French. They attempted to persuade him to forge passports for them, but he refused; he was released in November 1948. He underwent a denazification process, during which statements were produced from the forger-inmates whose lives he had been responsible for saving. He later worked for the Hahnemühle paper company.
