50|$|The {{beginning}} of the subatlantic opened at {{the middle of the}} first millennium BC with the so-called Roman Warm Period which lasted to the {{beginning of}} the 4th century.

It was not very pronounced and of short duration - an average temperature drop of 0.2 °C and a winter temperature drop of 0.4 °C center around 350 AD (or 1,600 years BP). This climatic deterioration with the establishment of drier and cooler conditions might have forced the Huns to move west thus in turn triggering the migrations of the Germanic tribes.

40|$|As {{part of the}} internship, {{three major}} {{projects}} were undertaken at the Alcoa Pinjarra Refinery involving the performance evaluation of control loops in operation, design of a new control system and improvement of an existing control system. The performance evaluation was performed using Honeywell's Loop Scout software and a systematic approach was devised to enable others to follow a similar approach. Using this approach, several control loops were evaluated and from the results obtained a report was produced targeted at improving the level of understanding about Loop Scout detailed reports at the Pinjarra refinery. This was done so that operators with less control theory knowledge could diagnose controller issues and identify the cause of poor performance in control loops. Several controllers were analysed and {{the results have been}} included in this report along with systematic analysis and the most probable cause of poor performance in that loop. The design of a new control system involved first researching into a pre-existing control system, which was then altered to work with the new area. This control system allows the liquor flow through the 30 E evaporators to increase to its designed capacity while ensuring critical processes connected to the 30 E evaporators do not exceed set constraint limits. Unfortunately no conclusive data as to the success of this project was available due to maintenance issues with the 30 E building, but the control system has been commissioned on the control network so that when the maintenance is able to be carried out, the controller will be ready to go. Improving the existing temperature control system around the 35 S tank involved first diagnosing the cause of <b>temperature</b> <b>spikes</b> and then making changes to the control structure to reduce the severity and frequency of these <b>temperature</b> <b>spikes.</b> The cause was found to be two upstream level controllers rapidly changing their outputs, so feed forward control was implemented in an attempt to cancel out some of these disturbances.

40|$|During the <b>temperature</b> <b>spike</b> of {{the contact}} {{co-firing}} {{step in a}} solar cell process, {{it has been shown}} that the concentration of lifetime-killer dissolved metallic impurities increases, while adding an annealing after the spike getters most of the dissolved impurities towards the phosphorus emitter, where they are less detrimental. The contact co-firing temperature profile including the after-spike annealing has been called extended contact co-firing, and it has also been proposed as a means to decrease the emitter saturation current density of highly doped emitters, benefiting thus a wide range of materials in terms of detrimental impurity content. The aim of the present work is to determine the effect of performing this additional annealing on contact quality and solar cell performance, looking for an optimal temperature profile for reduction of bulk and emitter recombination without affecting contact quality. It presents the effect of the extended co-firing step on fill factor, series resistance and contact resistance of solar cells manufactured with different extended co-firing temperature profiles. Fill factor decreases when extended co-firing is performed. Series resistance and contact resistance increase during annealing, more dramatically when the temperature peak is decreased. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images show silver crystallites in contact with silver bulk before the annealing that allow a direct current path, and silver crystallites totally surrounded by glass layer (> 100 nmthick) after annealing. Glass layer redistribution and thickening at low temperatures at the semiconductor-metal interface can be related to the series resistance increase. Degradation of series resistance during the <b>temperature</b> <b>spike,</b> when it is below the optimum one, can be also attributed to an incomplete silicon nitride etching and silver crystallite formation. To make full use of the beneficial effects of annealing, screen-printing metallic paste development supporting lower temperatures without thick glass layer growth is needed...|$|E
40|$|Microlensing {{observations}} {{indicate that}} quasar accretion discs have half-light radii larger than expected from standard theoretical predictions based on quasar fluxes or black hole masses. Blackburne and colleagues {{have also found}} a very weak wavelength dependence of these half-light radii. We consider disc temperature profile models that might match these observations. Nixon and colleagues have suggested that misaligned accretion discs around spinning black holes will be disrupted at radii small enough for the Lense-Thirring torque to overcome the disc's viscous torque. Gas in precessing annuli torn off a disc will spread radially and intersect with the remaining disc, heating the disc at potentially large radii. However, if the intersection occurs at an angle {{of more than a}} degree or so, highly supersonic collisions will shock-heat the gas to a Compton temperature of T~ 10 ^ 7 K, and the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of discs with such shock-heated regions are poor fits to observations of quasar SEDs. Torn discs where heating occurs in intermittent weak shocks that occur whenever the intersection angle reaches a tenth of a degree pose less of a conflict with observations, but do not have significantly larger half-light radii than standard discs. We also study two phenomenological disc temperature profile models. We find that discs with a <b>temperature</b> <b>spike</b> at relatively large radii and lowered temperatures at radii inside the spike yield improved and acceptable fits to microlensing sizes in most cases. Such temperature profiles could in principle occur in sub-Keplerian discs partially supported by magnetic pressure.
