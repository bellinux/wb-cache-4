500|$|Claire becomes {{increasingly}} ruthless {{as the season}} progresses. When Galloway leaks an intimate photo of Claire to appease his jealous fianceé, Claire intimidates him into publicly stating that he fabricated the picture, ruining his reputation. When Gillian Cole (Sandrine Holt), a pregnant former employee, returns to demand health care {{as part of her}} severance, Claire says, [...] "I am willing <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>your</b> child wither and die inside you, if that’s what’s required,...Am I really the sort of enemy you want to make?" [...] Claire also manipulates First Lady Patricia Walker (Joanna Going) into believing that her husband is having an affair in order to distract President Walker from Frank's machinations.|$|E
500|$|Kershaw {{started the}} 2010 season by posting a 3.07 ERA in April, but {{did so by}} walking 22 batters in 29 innings. On May 4, he had his worst start of his career against the Milwaukee Brewers at Dodger Stadium, {{throwing}} just 57 pitches in 1 innings, while retiring only four of the 13 batters he faced—including the pitcher. He was booed loudly upon being pulled from the game. Kershaw said after the game, [...] "I didn't give our team any kind of chance. It's just not a good feeling <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>your</b> teammates down, let everybody down. It stings, it hurts. I've got to figure things out." ...|$|E
500|$|... nstead of {{rewriting}} the game, I thought, well maybe {{it should be}} dwarves instead. And it should be real-time to combat the [...] problem. Now, you'd be digging out minerals in a mountain, combating threats inside, and making little workshops. Then I thought, well, how should the high score list work? We really like to keep records of plays. Not just high score lists, but expansive logs. So we'll often {{try to think of}} ways to play with the idea. This time, the idea was <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>your</b> adventurer come into the fortress after you lose and find the goblets you've made, and journals it generates.|$|E

500|$|Francis {{characterized}} Genevieve as [...] "harsh", attesting {{this quality}} to her past tragedy. In {{an interview with}} AOL, Francis said that, [...] "Although tragic things have happened to her, she is not tragic." [...] Michael Fairman of On-Air On-Soaps described Genevieve as an [...] "eerie bitch". Jamey Giddens of Zap2it described her as [...] "kooky" [...] and [...] "The Pervy-Odd Mob Mama". The soap opera's official website describes her relationship with Colin Atkinson (Tristan Rogers) as [...] "twisted" [...] and [...] "confusing". Genevieve was considerably [...] "darker" [...] than the role of Laura Spencer on General Hospital, which Francis loved. She said, [...] "It's so freeing <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>your</b> dark side shine {{for a minute and}} when you do a scene when you've been really evil, when the scene ends, you laugh. It's just fun." ...|$|E
500|$|Alexandra's letters {{reveal that}} Maria, the middle {{child of the}} family, {{sometimes}} felt insecure and left out by her older sisters and feared she wasn't loved {{as much as the}} other children. Alexandra reassured her that she was as dearly loved as her siblings. At age eleven, Maria apparently developed a painful crush on one of the young men she had met. [...] "Try not <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>your</b> thoughts dwell too much on him, that's what our Friend said," [...] Alexandra wrote to her on December 6, 1910. Alexandra advised her third daughter to keep her feelings hidden because others might say unkind things to her about her crush. [...] "One must not let others see what one feels inside, when one knows it's considered not proper. I know he likes you as a little sister and would like to help you not to care too much, because he knows you, a little Grand Duchess, must not care for him so." ...|$|E
500|$|Gosling was {{scheduled}} to begin filming The Lovely Bones in 2007. However, he left the production two days before filming began because of [...] "creative differences" [...] {{and was replaced by}} Mark Wahlberg. Gosling had been cast as the father of the murdered teenage girl and initially felt he was too young for the role. The director Peter Jackson and the producer Fran Walsh persuaded him that he could be aged with hair and make-up changes. Before shooting began, Gosling gained 60 pounds in weight and grew a beard to appear older. Walsh then [...] "began to feel he was not right. It was our blindness, the desire to make it work no matter what." [...] Gosling later said, [...] "We didn't talk very much during the preproduction process, which was the problem ... I just showed up on set, and I had gotten it wrong. Then I was fat and unemployed." [...] He has said the experience was [...] "an important realisation for me: not <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>your</b> ego get involved. It's OK to be too young for a role." ...|$|E

500|$|Villarreal {{commented that}} the film [...] "teaches you not <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>your</b> friends down", while Fishburne {{believed}} that the theme of community was important. Marrit Ingman of The Austin Chronicle said the film indicates [...] "a community-based, cooperative model of group success," [...] while Justin Chang of Variety said it [...] "focuses ... on the bee's community-uniting impact." [...] Hodges said Akeelah goes to the spelling bee because she recognizes it [...] "proves that someone from their neighborhood can achieve success, and her achievementis, in a real sense, their own". In contrast, Bernard Beck wrote for Multicultural Perspectives that it depicts [...] "the success of individual perseverance", while Red Feather Journalls Kathryn Linder expressed a similar opinion about individual success. Nevertheless, Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times commented [...] "it raises important points about the ... obstacles to success that kids from poor neighborhoods face." [...] The New York Presss reviewer went further and said social class was its [...] "real subject" [...] as it [...] "depicts the basics of class mobility that are routinely taken for granted". However, Chang asserted it shows the spelling bee contest as [...] "a democratizing force", while Rob Asghar, for The Seattle Times, wrote it treats English as [...] "the quintessential American tool for success." ...|$|E
2500|$|There are two {{approaches}} {{to the business of}} being noticed by today's record-buying public. The first ... revolves around oodles of hype and ever-more preposterous wardrobe selections. The second ... requires ... the confidence <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>your</b> music do the talking... Amazingly, given preconceived notions about America's supposed preference for style over substance, it is the second of these two sales techniques which appears to be working better.|$|E
2500|$|Media personalities {{have weighed}} in on the confrontations. During the standoff, Bundy was interviewed (via remote link) by {{television}} host Sean Hannity. Hannity stated that some fear events could wind up mirroring the Waco siege and Ruby Ridge and said, [...] "This is public land, and it's not being used, in my mind, and I'm not a rancher, (but) I would think the federal government might be thankful because you're cutting the lawn for free, and they're charging huge amounts of money, right, <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>your</b> cattle graze there with these fees". In contrast, a comparison of BLM grazing fees with private land market prices demonstrated the Bundy's are getting a 93% discount by grazing on BLM land.|$|E
2500|$|Lyrically {{the song}} is about letting loose, being as wild as can be, while she asks ladies to [...] "whip their hair" [...] and [...] "shake haters off". The lyrics have motivational undertones, {{speaking}} of self-love and assurance, and referring <b>to</b> <b>letting</b> <b>your</b> hair down as a representation of this in parts like the line, [...] "Keep fighting until I get there, when I'm down and I feel like giving up/I whip my hair back and forth, I whip it, I whip it real good." ...|$|R

[...] You signed that paper, knowing only what the interpreter told you it said. If anything happened when the paper was being made up that changed its order, if you had been educated and could read and write, you could have known about it and refused to put your name on it.
