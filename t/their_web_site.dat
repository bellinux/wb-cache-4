25|$|In late 2008, a new {{variable}} {{came into}} play. Previously, applicants to most colleges {{were required to}} submit all scores, with some colleges that embraced Score Choice retaining the option of allowing their applicants {{not to have to}} submit all scores. However, in 2008, an initiative to make Score Choice universal had begun, with some opposition from colleges desiring to maintain score report practices. While students theoretically now have the choice to submit their best score (in theory one could send any score one wishes to send) to the college of their choice, some colleges and universities, such as Cornell, ask that students send all test scores. This had led the College Board to display on <b>their</b> <b>web</b> <b>site</b> which colleges agree with or dislike Score Choice, with continued claims that students will still never have scores submitted against their will. Regardless of whether a given college permits applicants to exercise Score Choice options, most colleges do not penalize students who report poor scores along with high ones; many universities, such as Columbia and Cornell, expressly promise to overlook those scores that may be undesirable to the student and/or to focus more on those scores that are most representative of the student's achievement and academic potential. College Board maintains a list of colleges and their respective score choice policies that is recent as of November 2011.|$|E

An announcement of the new Halo project was expected at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) 2008 trade fair, with Bungie unveiling a countdown on <b>their</b> <b>web</b> <b>site,</b> but the announcement was shelved by Microsoft. Microsoft stated that it wanted the game to have its own event. On September 25, 2008, a year after the release of Halo 3, Bungie debuted a teaser for the new project on <b>their</b> <b>web</b> <b>site.</b> A full trailer was released during the Tokyo Game Show on October 9, 2008, officially unveiling the game's name as Halo 3: Recon and a release date of Autumn 2009. [...] In an unusual approach for Bungie, the trailer used pre-rendered graphics instead of the game engine or existing assets. Staten explained that it was too early in the game's development to spend a large amount of time on the trailer, and it would not have allowed Bungie to add touches for fans to discuss.|$|E

40|$|Marketing {{communications}} {{is regarded}} as a common function of all <b>Web</b> <b>sites,</b> even if this is not the express objective of the site. As no previous research specifically considered these issues, this study examined the extent to which lodges graded by the Tourism Grading Council of South Africa effectively use <b>their</b> <b>Web</b> <b>sites</b> as online marketing communications tools. A content analysis was used to investigate the <b>Web</b> <b>sites</b> of graded lodges according to a list of evaluation criteria based on the elements of the marketing communications mix (i. e., advertising, sales promotion, public relations, direct marketing and personal selling). A number of specific online marketing communications techniques that could be employed in a tourism firm’s <b>Web</b> <b>site</b> were identified from an extensive literature review for each element of the marketing communications mix. The extent to which these specific techniques were employed in the <b>Web</b> <b>sites</b> of the graded lodges was then determined. The findings show that the graded lodges are not using <b>their</b> <b>Web</b> <b>sites</b> effectively as online marketing communications tools for communications with their target audiences. Comparisons were also made between the three, four and five star lodges to determine whether differences were present in <b>their</b> <b>Web</b> <b>sites</b> based on <b>their</b> star grading. Overall, the lodges did not differ much in terms of the online marketing communications techniques that they employed and only slight differences existed. The main recommendation for this study is that the managers of South African graded lodges include as many of the 30 online marketing communications techniques investigated as possible in <b>their</b> <b>Web</b> <b>sites.</b> This study was limited as it only focused on lodges that have been graded by the Tourism Grading Council of South Africa and the findings cannot be generalised to all South African lodges or to other types of accommodation establishments. Potential reasons for the inclusion/exclusion of these techniques, whether the lodges maintain <b>their</b> <b>Web</b> <b>sites</b> themselves, what specific techniques <b>Web</b> <b>site</b> visitors regard as important {{and the fact that the}} researcher was the only coder of the sites were also limitations of this study that could be overcome in future research.
