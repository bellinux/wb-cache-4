5|$|Richmond Bridge is an 18th-century stone {{arch bridge}} that crosses the River Thames at Richmond, {{connecting}} the <b>two</b> <b>halves</b> <b>of</b> the present-day London Borough of Richmond upon Thames. It {{was designed by}} James Paine and Kenton Couse.|$|E
5|$|As the {{incipient}} ocean widened in the Late Proterozoic and Early Paleozoic, {{it broke}} the continental crust {{in two and}} a true ocean basin developed to the west. All the earlier formations were thus dissected along a steep front on the <b>two</b> <b>halves</b> <b>of</b> the previous continent. A wedge of clastic sediment then started to accumulate {{at the base of}} the two underwater precipices, starting the formation of opposing continental shelves.|$|E
5|$|Eland herds are {{accompanied}} by a loud clicking sound that has been subject to considerable speculation. It is believed that {{the weight of the}} animal causes the <b>two</b> <b>halves</b> <b>of</b> its hooves to splay apart, and the clicking {{is the result of the}} hoof snapping together when the animal raises its leg. The sound carries some distance from a herd, and may be a form of communication.|$|E

5|$|The crests of Corythosaurus {{resemble}} {{that of a}} cassowary, or a Corinthian helmet. They {{are formed}} {{by a combination of}} the praemaxillae, nasals, prefrontals and frontals, as in Saurolophus, but instead of projecting backwards as a spine, they rise up to make the highest point above the orbit. The <b>two</b> <b>halves</b> <b>of</b> the crest are separated by a median suture. In front of the orbit, the crest is made of thick bone.|$|E
5|$|Hilton Head Island is {{sometimes}} referred to as the second largest barrier island on the Eastern Seaboard after Long Island (which is not actually a barrier island but two glacial moraines). Technically, however, Hilton Head Island is only a half barrier island. The north end of the island is a sea island dating to the Pleistocene epoch, and the south end is a barrier island that appeared as recently as the Holocene epoch. Broad Creek, which is actually a land-locked tidal marsh, separates the <b>two</b> <b>halves</b> <b>of</b> the island.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{presence}} of a post-Constantinian editor, as originally postulated by Theodore Mommsen, still has notable support, most recently articulated by Daniel Den Hengst, who suggests that the editor was the author of {{the second half of the}} History, operating under the pseudonyms of Pollio and Vopiscus. Further, that this editor not only wrote the secondary lives in the first half, but he was also responsible for the insertions into the primary lives in that series. He takes the view that the vast stylistic differences between the <b>two</b> <b>halves</b> <b>of</b> the History means they cannot have been written by the same author.|$|E

5|$|Indoor soccer {{features}} {{six players}} per team {{as opposed to}} the standard eleven, and is played without an offside rule on an artificial field of play. The pitch is far smaller than that used in regular soccer, with a regulation size of 200 feet by 85 feet, identical to a North American ice hockey rink. The goals and penalty areas are also scaled down. Instead of <b>two</b> <b>halves</b> <b>of</b> 45 minutes each, matches are divided into four quarters of 15 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Malaysia's main {{newspapers}} {{are owned by}} the government and political parties in the ruling coalition, although some major opposition parties also have their own, which are openly sold alongside regular newspapers. A divide exists between the media in the <b>two</b> <b>halves</b> <b>of</b> the country. Peninsular-based media gives low priority to news from the East, and often treats the eastern states as colonies of the Peninsula. The media have been blamed for increasing tension between Indonesia and Malaysia, and giving Malaysians a bad image of Indonesians. The country has Malay, English, Chinese, and Tamil dailies.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the late}} Umayyad and early Abbasid caliphs, the {{frontier}} between Byzantium and the Caliphate became stabilized {{along the line}} of the Taurus-Antitaurus mountain ranges. On the Arab side, Cilicia was permanently occupied and its deserted cities, such as Adana, Mopsuestia (al-Massisa) and, most importantly, Tarsus, were refortified and resettled under the early Abbasids. Likewise, in Upper Mesopotamia, places like Germanikeia (Mar'ash), Hadath and Melitene (Malatya) became major military centers. These two regions came to form the <b>two</b> <b>halves</b> <b>of</b> a new fortified frontier zone, the thughur.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} to Pola, Tegetthoff kept his fleet {{in the northern}} Adriatic, where it patrolled against a possible Italian attack. The Italian ships never came, and on 12 August, the two countries signed the Armistice of Cormons; this ended the fighting {{and led to the}} Treaty of Vienna. Though Austria had defeated Italy at Lissa and on land at the Battle of Custoza, the Austrian army was decisively defeated by Prussia at the Battle of Königgrätz. As a result, Austria, which became Austria-Hungary in the Ausgleich of 1867, was forced to cede the city of Venice to Italy. The <b>two</b> <b>halves</b> <b>of</b> the Dual Monarchy held veto power over the other, and Hungarian disinterest in naval expansion led to severely reduced budgets for the fleet. In {{the immediate aftermath of the}} war, the bulk of the Austrian fleet was decommissioned and disarmed.|$|E
5|$|The {{station and}} the nearby Queens Center Mall are served by nine local MTA Regional Bus Operations routes and two express bus routes. Three of the four Woodhaven Boulevard bus lines (Q11, Q21, Q52 Limited) {{terminate}} at the station, with the Q53 Limited bus continuing westward towards the Woodside – 61st Street Station. Except for the Q88, Rego Park-bound Q59, Jamaica-bound Q60, and Corona-bound Q38, all northbound buses stop at the mall entrance, while all southbound buses {{as well as the}} QM10 and QM11 express buses stop at Hoffman Drive adjacent to Hoffman Park. The Q88 terminates at 92nd Street, in between the <b>two</b> <b>halves</b> <b>of</b> the mall.|$|E
5|$|Though {{at first}} Silver stalks Sonic and impedes his {{attempts}} to save Elise, Shadow reveals to him that Sonic is {{not the cause of}} his world's suffering but rather Mephiles, who is trying to erase the past for his own evil purposes. Throughout the story, Sonic and friends travel between the past, present, and future in their efforts to stop Mephiles and Iblis and protect Elise from Doctor Eggman. They learn that Mephiles seeks to bond with Iblis, as they are the <b>two</b> <b>halves</b> <b>of</b> Soleanna's omnipotent god, Solaris. Mephiles succeeds, but Sonic, Shadow, and Silver use the power of the Chaos Emeralds to transform into their super forms and defeat Solaris.|$|E

5|$|Following the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 16th {{century the}} advowson of Chesham Woburn {{remained}} attached to Woburn Abbey and was transferred, {{along with the}} abbey building, to John Russell, 1st Earl of Bedford. The advowson of Chesham Leicester was sold, {{and from then on}} had a succession of owners, eventually coming into the ownership of prominent local landowners the Skottowe family, who purchased it from Sir Francis Whichcote, MP for Cambridgeshire. From 1601 onwards, other than a brief period between 1623–1660, the appointees of Chesham Woburn and Chesham Leicester were the same person, and thus the parish was served by a single vicar, although he continued to be appointed by the holders of each advowson separately. In 1769 John Russell, 4th Duke of Bedford, who had inherited Chesham Woburn, also acquired Chesham Leicester and from then on the parish was served by a single vicar assisted by multiple curates; in 1767 the <b>two</b> <b>halves</b> <b>of</b> the parish were formally unified by an Act of Parliament.|$|E

5|$|In K. guimarotae, the <b>two</b> <b>halves</b> <b>of</b> the dentary diverge {{from each}} other at an angle of 20° near the front, then 40° near the back. It also bears two convexities {{on the bottom of}} the jaw, one at the third and fourth teeth and another at the eighth to tenth teeth. The latter {{convexity}} is replaced by a concavity in K. langenbergensis. In both species, the top margin of the jaw behind the tooth row slopes upwards in a straight line. The side of the dentary is pitted, albeit much more densely so in K. langenbergensis. Near the back of the dentary in both species, the pits are replaced by longitudinal grooves. On the interior of the jaw, the splenial bears an oval foramen behind the level of the symphysis in both species, and the top of the bone bears a low and roughened crest in K. guimarotae.|$|E
5|$|Matilda {{gave birth}} to her third son William on 22 July 1136 at Argentan, and she then {{operated}} out of the border region for the next three years, establishing her household knights on estates around the area. Matilda may have asked Ulger, the Bishop of Angers, to garner support for her claim with the Pope in Rome, but if she did, Ulger was unsuccessful. Geoffrey invaded Normandy in early 1136 and, after a temporary truce, invaded again later the same year, raiding and burning estates rather than trying to hold the territory. Stephen returned to the Duchy in 1137, where he met with Louis VI and Theobald to agree to an informal alliance against Geoffrey and Matilda, to counter the growing Angevin power in the region. Stephen formed an army to retake Matilda's Argentan castles, but frictions between his Flemish mercenary forces and the local Norman barons resulted in a battle between the <b>two</b> <b>halves</b> <b>of</b> his army. The Norman forces then deserted the King, forcing Stephen to give up his campaign. Stephen agreed to another truce with Geoffrey, promising to pay him 2,000 marks a year in exchange for peace along the Norman borders.|$|E
5|$|Non-human animals may {{experience}} both spontaneous and traumatic pneumothorax. Spontaneous pneumothorax is, as in humans, classified as primary or secondary, while traumatic pneumothorax {{is divided into}} open and closed (with or without chest wall damage). The diagnosis may be apparent to the veterinary physician because the animal exhibits difficulty breathing in, or has shallow breathing. Pneumothoraces may arise from lung lesions (such as bullae) or from trauma to the chest wall. In horses, traumatic pneumothorax may involve both hemithoraces, as the mediastinum is incomplete {{and there is a}} direct connection between the <b>two</b> <b>halves</b> <b>of</b> the chest. Tension pneumothorax – the presence of which may be suspected due to rapidly deteriorating heart function, absent lung sounds throughout the thorax, and a barrel-shaped chest – is treated with an incision in the animal's chest to relieve the pressure, followed by insertion of a chest tube.|$|E
