5|$|In 1913, Ernst Zermelo used chess as a {{basis for}} his theory of game strategies, which is {{considered}} as one of the predecessors of game theory. Zermelo's theorem states <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> solve chess, i.e. to determine with certainty the outcome of a perfectly played game (either white can force a win, or black can force a win, or both sides can force at least a draw). However, according to Claude Shannon, there are 1043 legal positions in chess, so it will take an impossibly long time to compute a perfect strategy with any feasible technology.|$|E
5|$|Though most {{computers}} since mid-2004 can boot from USB {{mass storage}} devices, USB {{is not intended}} as a primary bus for a computer's internal storage. Buses such as Parallel ATA (PATA or IDE), Serial ATA (SATA), or SCSI fulfill that role in PC class computers. However, USB has one important advantage, in <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> install and remove devices without rebooting the computer (hot-swapping), making it useful for mobile peripherals, including drives of various kinds (given SATA or SCSI devices {{may or may not}} support hot-swapping).|$|E

40|$|Gemes (2009) argued that, {{given that}} I believe that I have hands and I believe <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{not the case}} that I have a hand with a wart on <b>it,</b> <b>it</b> must <b>be</b> the case {{that at least one of}} my experience-based beliefs (EBBs) is true. This follows since the contradictions of those two propositions {{believed}} by me are jointly inconsistent. Gemes (2009) concluded that this refutes the sceptical claim <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> all one's EBBs are false. The first section of this article addresses some objections to the argument of Gemes (2009). The second section develops new counter-examples to the claim <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> all one's EBBs are false, and then argues that they are also counter-examples to the claim <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> all one's direct, that is, perceptual, EBBs are false. The third section presents counter-examples to the claim <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> all one's positive, that is, existential entailing, EBBs are false. Readers who are already convinced of the soundness of the argument of Gemes (2009) might skip the first section of this article...|$|R
