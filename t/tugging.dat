5|$|At {{the end of}} the {{planetary}} formation epoch the inner Solar System was populated by 50–100 Moon- to Mars-sized planetary embryos. Further growth was possible only because these bodies collided and merged, which took less than 100million years. These objects would have gravitationally interacted with one another, <b>tugging</b> at each other's orbits until they collided, growing larger until the four terrestrial planets we know today took shape. One such giant collision is thought to have formed the Moon (see Moons below), while another removed the outer envelope of the young Mercury.|$|E

And all along, the riveting friendship {{between the two}} polarized women and the events that bring them together, keep <b>tugging</b> at your heart. Shreyas Talpade proves that (his previous film), Iqbal was no accident and Gul Panag gives {{one of the most}} convincing portrayals of her career. But, it is Ayesha Takia who simply blows your breath away. Her journey from joyous subjugation — where she is content to dance before her husband and be at the beck and call of her in-laws — to silent emancipation is absolutely endearing.|$|E
5|$|The Kepler {{team has}} said that Kepler-11b and Kepler-11c are {{probably}} composed mostly of water with a thin hydrogen and helium atmosphere. In comparison to the outer planets of the system, which probably have large hydrogen and helium atmospheres, Kepler-11c's proximity to its star has blown off most of its atmosphere. Kepler-11 and its six-planet system form what NASA considers {{to be the most}} compact and flattest planetary system yet discovered. Kepler-11b and Kepler-11c orbit Kepler-11 with a phenomenon called orbital resonance, a gravitational <b>tugging</b> that keeps their orbit stable at a 5.4 ratio.|$|E
40|$|This study {{presents}} <b>Tug</b> Fleet and Ground Operations Schedules and Controls plan. This {{plan was}} developed and optimized out {{of a combination of}} individual <b>Tug</b> program phased subplans, special emphasis studies, contingency analyses and sensitivity analyses. The subplans cover the <b>Tug</b> program phases: (1) <b>Tug</b> operational, (2) Interim Upper Stage (IUS) /Tug fleet utilization, (3) and IUS/Tug payload integration, (4) <b>Tug</b> site activation, (5) IUS/Tug transition, (6) <b>Tug</b> acquisition. Resource requirements (facility, GSE, TSE, software, manpower, logistics) are provided in each subplan, as are appropriate <b>Tug</b> processing flows, active and total IUS and <b>Tug</b> fleet requirements, fleet management and <b>Tug</b> payload integration concepts, facility selection recommendations, site activation and IUS to <b>Tug</b> transition requirements. The impact of operational concepts on <b>Tug</b> acquisition is assessed and the impact of operating <b>Tugs</b> out of KSC and WTR is analyzed and presented showing WTR as a delta.

40|$|Shuttle {{interfaces}} {{required for}} space <b>tug</b> accommodation are primarily involved with supporting and servicing the <b>tug</b> during launch countdown, flight, and postlanding; deploying and retrieving the <b>tug</b> on orbit; and maintaining {{control over the}} <b>tug</b> when it is {{in or near the}} orbiter. Each of these interface areas was investigated to determine the best physical and operational method of accomplishing the required functions, with an overriding goal of establishing simple and flexible orbiter interface requirements suitable for <b>tug,</b> <b>tug</b> payloads, IUS and other cargo. It is concluded the orbiter payload accommodations and the MSFC baseline <b>tug</b> are generally interface compatible. Specific minor changes to <b>tug</b> and orbiter interfaces were identified to provide full compatibility. A system concept for supporting and deploying <b>tug</b> from orbiter is described...|$|R
5|$|This corvid {{is known}} to join mixed-species flocks with other species {{including}} unicolored jays and emerald toucanets. It is also known to travel in groups with two to ten other azure-hooded jays. It is a skulking and secretive species, rarely coming out into the open. Because of this habit, the bird {{is extremely difficult to}} observe in the wild and not much is known about its ecology. Mates are known to preen each other, a process which entails one bird bending over {{in front of the other}} and <b>tugging</b> on its throat feathers. The feathers of the crown are often moving swiftly, and it is believed that the condition of a mate can be determined by this movement.|$|E
5|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{displays}} are seen, with aggressive behaviours outnumbering pro-social ones. Crouching low and uttering quiet begging calls are common signs of submission. The manus flutter is a submissive display where a magpie will flutter its primary feathers in its wings. A magpie, particularly a juvenile, may also fall, roll over on its back and expose its underparts. Birds may fluff up their flank feathers as an aggressive display or preceding an attack. Young birds display various forms of play behaviour, either by themselves or in groups, with older birds often initiating the proceedings with juveniles. These may involve picking up, manipulating or <b>tugging</b> at various objects such as sticks, rocks or bits of wire, and handing them to other birds. A bird may pick up a feather or leaf and flying off with it, with other birds pursuing and attempting {{to bring down the}} leader by latching onto its tail feathers. Birds may jump on each other and even engage in mock fighting. Play may even take place with other species such as blue-faced honeyeaters and Australasian pipits.|$|E
5|$|Analysis of the jaw {{structure}} of Carnotaurus by Mazzetta and colleagues (1998, 2004, 2009) {{suggests that the}} animal was capable of quick bites, but not strong ones. Quick bites {{are more important than}} strong bites when capturing small prey, as shown by studies of modern-day crocodiles. These researchers also noted a high degree of flexibility (kinesis) within the skull and especially the lower jaw, somewhat similar to modern snakes. Elasticity of the jaw would have allowed Carnotaurus to swallow small prey items whole. In addition, the front part of the lower jaw was hinged, and thus able to move up and down. When pressed downwards, the teeth would have projected forward, allowing Carnotaurus to spike small prey items; when the teeth were curved upwards, the now backward projecting teeth would have hindered the caught prey from escaping. Mazzetta and colleagues also found that the skull was able to withstand forces that appear when <b>tugging</b> on large prey items. Carnotaurus may therefore have fed mainly on relatively small prey, but also was able to hunt large dinosaurs.|$|E

40|$|A {{recoverable}} Space <b>Tug</b> {{launched by}} the Space Shuttle can provide the required post-orbital propulsion needed for placement of unmanned satellites. The Space <b>Tug</b> will {{also be used to}} launch interplanetary spacecraft from low earth orbit. This study summarizes the performance of single and multiple Space <b>Tugs</b> (in tandem) for launching spacecraft beyond earth escape. Trajectories are developed that allow recovery of the <b>Tugs</b> whenever practical. The effects of important <b>Tug</b> and trajectory parameters on performance are presented. It is concluded that a single <b>Tug</b> can inject spacecraft to Mars or Venus and still be recovered. The use of several <b>Tugs</b> in tandem can provide a significant increase in capability over the use of a single <b>Tug.</b> The more difficult missions involve a mix of recovered and expended <b>Tugs...</b>|$|R
50|$|When a huge, renegade wolf attacks a young child, Will {{is called}} {{to deal with the}} menace.

5|$|Once prey {{is brought}} down, wolves begin to feed excitedly, ripping and <b>tugging</b> at the carcass in all directions, and bolting down {{large chunks of}} it. The {{breeding}} pair typically monopolizes food {{in order to continue}} producing pups. When food is scarce, this is done {{at the expense of other}} family members, especially non-pups. The breeding pair typically eats first, though as it is they who usually work the hardest in killing prey, they may rest after a long hunt and allow the rest of the family to eat unmolested. Once the breeding pair has finished eating, the rest of the family tears off pieces of the carcass and transport them to secluded areas where they can eat in peace. Wolves typically commence feeding by consuming the larger internal organs of their prey, such as the heart, liver, lungs and stomach lining. The kidneys and spleen are eaten once they are exposed, followed by the muscles. A single wolf can eat 15–19% of its body weight in a single feeding.|$|E
5|$|Three {{straight}} draws {{followed in}} December, the first away to league leaders Aston Villa. United were fortunate {{to pick up}} a point given their opponents dominance in the second half, and were careless at Tottenham Hotspur, throwing away a 2–0 lead. Solskjær put United two goals ahead, but in the 39th minute Gary Neville received a red card for a second bookable offence, <b>tugging</b> on David Ginola's shirt. Spurs captain Sol Campbell brought his team back into the match with 20 minutes remaining and on the cusp of stoppage time powered a header in the top left-hand corner, sparking jubilant scenes at White Hart Lane. Chelsea grabbed a creditable draw at Old Trafford to stake their championship credentials four days later and United, who were without their manager Ferguson for the Middlesbrough game were beaten 3–2; their last defeat of the season. On Boxing Day the team collected three points against Nottingham Forest and merited a point at Stamford Bridge in the last match of 1998 to solidify their position in the top four.|$|E
5|$|Merson came {{in place}} of John Jensen in Arsenal's {{starting}} XI, while for Milan Zvonimir Boban replaced the suspended Simone, and Christian Panucci was chosen to stand in for Paolo Maldini. Graham deployed a 4–1–4–1 formation, with Schwarz acting as the lone defensive midfielder and Hartson positioned the furthest forward. Watched by a crowd of 23,953, Milan eased to a 2–0 win {{and in the process}} ended Arsenal's 15-match unbeaten run in Europe. The home side's first goal came minutes before half-time, when Daniele Massaro's defensive-splitting pass found Boban, who scored, despite Schwarz's attempts to hold him back by <b>tugging</b> his shirt. The Croatian forward nearly scored a second, but for Seaman's quick intervention. Up until then, Arsenal had briefly threatened; from a long ball in the 19th minute, Hartson managed to turn Franco Baresi, but scuffed his shot wide. Milan found it easy to contain the opposition, given Desailly and Savićević influenced the tempo of the match. The latter came close to doubling Milan's lead when he broke forward and hit a shot goalwards, only for Seaman to divert the ball round the post. In the second half, Wright thought he had equalised for Arsenal when he tapped the ball in, but the referee disallowed the goal as there was infringement in the build-up. Milan continued to attack and extended their lead soon after; from Savićević's corner, Massaro jumped higher than his marker Lee Dixon and headed the ball into the Arsenal goal. Dixon, who required treatment early in the second half, was substituted for Martin Keown right away as he struggled to play on.|$|E

50|$|Canadian National <b>Tug</b> no. 5, or CN <b>Tug</b> no. 5, was a tugboat {{owned and}} {{operated}} by the Canadian National Railway (CNR) company on Okanagan Lake in British Columbia, Canada. She was launched on May 8, 1930 and was a steel <b>tug</b> that pushed railway barges to the Okanagan Landing shipyard and railway connection to transport fruit. By the 1950s and 1960s, CNR had three tugs: MV Pentowna, CN <b>Tug</b> no. 6, and CN <b>Tug</b> no. 5. Only one <b>tug</b> operated at a time, though two would be used in busy times, and each <b>tug</b> only pushed one barge. CNRs competitor on the lake, the Canadian Pacific Railway company, ran three <b>tugs</b> at a time, as well as many sternwheelers over the years, and each <b>tug</b> pushed two barges. Although the date of CN <b>Tug</b> no. 5s retirement is unknown, CNR terminated barge service on the lake in 1973, retiring its last ship, CN <b>Tug</b> no. 6, due to the highways and other modes of transportation that had emerged by that time.|$|R

5|$|The {{following}} year, on September 19, 1827, Bowie and Wright {{attended a}} duel on a sandbar outside of Natchez, Mississippi. Bowie supported duellist Samuel Levi Wells III, while Wright supported Wells's opponent, Dr. Thomas Harris Maddox.

Other members of the groups, who had various reasons for disliking each other, began fighting. Bowie {{was shot in the}} hip; after regaining his feet he drew a knife, described as a butcher knife, and charged his attacker, who hit Bowie over the head with his empty pistol, breaking the pistol and knocking Bowie to the ground. Wright shot at and missed the prone Bowie, who returned fire and possibly hit Wright. Wright then drew his sword cane and impaled Bowie. When Wright attempted to retrieve his blade by placing his foot on Bowie's chest and <b>tugging,</b> Bowie pulled him down and disemboweled Wright with his large knife. Wright died instantly, and Bowie, with Wright's sword still protruding from his chest, was shot again and stabbed by another member of the group.

25|$|Throughout {{the first}} year of life, infants are unable to {{communicate}} with language. Instead, infants communicate with gestures. This phenomenon is known as prelinguistic gestures, which are nonverbal ways that infants communicate that also had a plan backed with the gesture. Examples of these could be pointing at an object, <b>tugging</b> on the shirt of a parent to get the parent's attention, etc. Harding, 1983, devised the major criteria that come along with the behavior of prelinguistic gestures and their intent to communicate. There are three major criteria that go along with a prelinguistic gesture: waiting, persistence, and ultimately, development of alternative plans. This process usually occurs around 8 months of age, where an appropriate scenario may be of a child <b>tugging</b> on the shirt of a parent to wait for the attention of the parent who would then notice the infant, which causes the infant to point to something they desire. This would describe the first two criteria. The development of alternative plans may arise if the parent does not acknowledge what the infant wants, the infant may entertain itself to satisfy the previous desire.|$|E
25|$|Business {{continued}} to decline and in 1956 the Seabee was sold. Soon afterwards the target <b>tugging</b> contract was lost as the Air Force needed faster aircraft.

25|$|The medieval European timpani were {{typically}} {{put together by}} hand in the southern region of France. Some drums were tightened together by horses <b>tugging</b> from {{each side of the}} drum by the bolts. Over the next two centuries, a number of technical improvements were made to timpani. Originally, the head was nailed directly to the shell of the drum. In the 15th century, heads began to be attached and tensioned by a counterhoop that was tied directly to the shell. In the early 16th century, the bindings were replaced by screws. This allowed timpani to become tunable instruments of definite pitch. The Industrial Revolution enabled the introduction of new construction techniques and materials, in particular machine and pedal tuning mechanisms.
