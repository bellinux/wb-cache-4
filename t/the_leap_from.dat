A number of tie-in books were also published, including a handful of paperback prose storybooks in 1977 and 1993, and two football quiz books in 1978 and 1979. Roy of the Rovers never made <b>the</b> <b>leap</b> <b>from</b> page to screen, although he did make an appearance on the BBC comedy sports quiz They Think It's All Over in 1999, {{in the form of}} a cardboard cut-out. on 10 October 2006.|$|E
25|$|However, other {{researchers}} have contested {{the claims of the}} media effects paradigm. An article by Christopher Ferguson, Benjamin Winegard, and Bo Winegard, for example, argues that peer effects {{are much more likely to}} cause body dissatisfaction than media effects, and that media effects have been overemphasized. It also argues that one must be careful about making <b>the</b> <b>leap</b> <b>from</b> arguing that certain environmental conditions might cause body dissatisfaction to the claim that those conditions can cause diagnosable eating disorders.|$|E

25|$|Out of {{the twelve}} {{passengers}} who suffered major injuries, nine suffered the injuries from the impact and three suffered the injuries from the evacuation. Most of the injuries occurred to passengers and crew located in the flight deck and forward cabin. According to passenger reports, <b>the</b> <b>leap</b> <b>from</b> the aircraft to the ground caused many of the injuries, including broken legs, and ruptured vertebrae. The Captain sustained back and head injuries during {{the impact of the}} crash when his seat was wrenched out of place by the force of the impact, causing him to hit his head against the overhead controls. Minor injuries included twisted ankles, sore necks, bruises and effects from smoke inhalation. A total of 33 persons were taken to various hospitals within and outside Toronto for treatment, of which 21 were treated for minor injuries and released. The York-Finch campus of the Humber River Regional Hospital treated seven people for smoke inhalation. William Osler Health Centre, Etobicoke General Hospital, Credit Valley Hospital, and Peel Memorial Hospital were additional nearby hospitals that had admitted victims of the crash.|$|E

500|$|A key scene {{involving}} a large 3D hologram star map, dubbed the Orrery, {{was inspired by}} the 1766 Joseph Wright painting A Philosopher Lecturing on the Orrery, in which a scientist displays a mechanical planetarium by candlelight. While discussing the necessity of a star map with Spaihts, Scott mentioned that he envisaged a physical representation being similar to the painting, although he was unaware of its title and described it as [...] "circles in circles with a candle lit image". Using Scott's description, Spaihts located an image of the painting. Spaihts said, [...] "making <b>the</b> <b>leap</b> <b>from</b> a star map, to an Enlightenment painting, and then back into the far future. [...] mind just multiplexes in that way". The Orrery {{was one of the most}} complex visual effects, contained 80–100 million polygons, and took several weeks to render as a single, complete shot.|$|E

500|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine {{said that}} with the album, Madonna began {{her career as a}} disco diva, in an era that did not have any such divas to speak of. In the {{beginning}} of the 80s, disco was an anathema to the mainstream pop, and according to him, Madonna had a huge role in popularizing dance music as mainstream music, utilizing her charisma, chutzpah and sex appeal. Erlewine claimed that Madonna [...] "launched dance-pop" [...] and set the standard for the genre for the next two decades. The staff of Vice magazine stated that the album [...] "drew the blueprint for future dance-pop." [...] Rolling Stone ranked the album at number 50 on [...] "The 100 Best Albums of the Eighties" [...] list, writing: [...] "Indeed, initial response to Madonna gave no indication of the mania to follow. It took {{a year and a half}} for the album to go Gold. But its assured style and sound, as well as Madonna's savvy approach to videos, helped the singer make <b>the</b> <b>leap</b> <b>from</b> dance diva to pop phenom, and it pointed the direction for a host of female vocalists from Janet Jackson to Debbie Gibson." ...|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weekly gave [...] "D.P.O." [...] a B+, {{considering}} {{that despite the}} lack of action, it managed to [...] "keep you glued" [...] for the photography and [...] "truly hilarious sociopathic high jinks". Todd VanDerWerff [...] of The A.V. Club gave the same grade, praising Ribisi and Black's performances and [...] "sequences that confidently walk the tricky line between horror and broad comedy", and marking it as the point where [...] "the show's direction, always good, made <b>the</b> <b>leap</b> <b>from</b> consistently interesting to look at to consistently cinematic." [...] Jane Goldman, in The X-Files Book of the Unexplained felt like the combination of Howard Gordon's [...] "acutely observed dialogue" [...] and Ribisi's [...] "compelling performance" [...] made Darin Oswald [...] "one of season three's most memorable characters". Writing for Den of Geek, Nina Sordi put [...] "D.P.O." [...] only behind [...] "Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose" [...] as the best standalone season 3 episode, praising Ribisi's [...] "all quiet, creepy power that eventually explodes into homicidal rage" [...] and Jack Black's [...] "weary and ultimately doomed sidekick". The plot for [...] "D.P.O." [...] was also adapted as a novel for young adults in 1996 by Neal Shusterman, under the title Voltage and the pseudonym Easton Royce.|$|E
500|$|After {{leaving the}} B-stage, U2 often played [...] "Bad" [...] or [...] "Sunday Bloody Sunday", with {{performances}} of [...] "Bullet the Blue Sky" [...] and [...] "Running to Stand Still" [...] following. For [...] "Bullet the Blue Sky", the video screens displayed burning crosses and swastikas. During [...] "Running to Stand Still", Bono mimed {{the actions of}} a heroin addict from the B-stage, rolling up his sleeves and then pretending to spike his arm during the final lyric. Afterwards, red and yellow smoke flares ignited from either end of the B-stage, before the band re-grouped on the main stage for U2 classics played straight. [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name" [...] was accompanied by sped-up video of the group in the desert from The Joshua Trees photo shoot. U2 often finished their set with [...] "Pride (In the Name of Love)" [...] while a clip from Martin Luther King, Jr.'s famed [...] "I've Been to the Mountaintop" [...] speech was played on the video screens. The group was initially unconvinced that <b>the</b> <b>leap</b> <b>from</b> the rest of the show's irony and artifice to something more sincere would be successful, but they thought {{that it was important to}} demonstrate that certain ideals were so strong and true that they could be held onto no matter the circumstance. The group alternated performances of [...] "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For" [...] in acoustic form on the B-stage with using it to close the main set.|$|E

Unlike other major studios, which produced politically charged, socially conscious leftist films, Tianyi mainly focussed on making apolitical [...] "entertainment" [...] films. By the 1930s, Tianyi had become one of the top Chinese film studios, along with Mingxing and Lianhua.|$|E

2500|$|In 1984, Lloyd Webber {{contacted}} Cameron Mackintosh, the co-producer of Cats and Song and Dance, {{to propose}} a new musical. He was aiming for a romantic piece, and suggested Gaston Leroux's book The Phantom of the Opera as a basis. They screened both the 1925 Lon Chaney and the 1943 Claude Rains motion picture versions, but neither saw {{an effective way to}} make <b>the</b> <b>leap</b> <b>from</b> film to stage. Later, in New York, Lloyd Webber found a second-hand copy of the original, long-out-of-print Leroux novel, which supplied the necessary inspiration to develop a musical: [...] "I was actually writing something else at the time, and I realised that the reason I was hung up was because I was trying to write a major romantic story, and I had been trying to do that ever since I started my career. Then with the Phantom, it was there!" ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{commensal}} pathway was {{traveled by}} vertebrates that fed on refuse around human habitats or by animals that preyed on other animals drawn to human [...] camps. Those animals established a commensal relationship with humans {{in which the}} animals benefited but the humans received no harm but little benefit. Those animals that were most capable of {{taking advantage of the}} resources associated with human camps would have been the tamer, less aggressive individuals with shorter fight or flight distances. Later, these animals developed closer social or economic bonds with humans that led to a domestic relationship. <b>The</b> <b>leap</b> <b>from</b> a synanthropic population to a domestic one could only have taken place after the animals had progressed from anthropophily to habituation, to commensalism and partnership, when the relationship between animal and human would have laid the foundation for domestication, including captivity and human-controlled breeding. From this perspective, animal domestication is a coevolutionary process in which a population responds to selective pressure while adapting to a novel niche that included another species with evolving behaviors.|$|E
2500|$|In this battle, the {{two factors}} {{combined}} {{to give a}} glimpse of what would end the Plains Indians way of life since horses had made them true nomads. [...] Although the “Comanche” had always been a nomadic people, it was the horse that transformed them into a true nomad culture, and a very warlike one. [...] In the Journal of American History Pekka Hämäläinen [...] estimates, as do most military historians and cultural anthropologists, that it was around 1700 that the Comanche got access to a sufficient number of Spanish horses {{that they were able to}} make <b>the</b> <b>leap</b> <b>from</b> dog and human assisted nomadic hunter-gatherer to a true nomad culture. [...] The effects of this transformation were radical. [...] Because they were the first Plains tribe to fully incorporate the horse into their way of life, and into their way of making war, they were far and away the best at it [...] [...] Though it was rare, the only successes the Spanish ever had in battle with the Comanche were on occasions that they were able to take them by surprise. [...] However, since the Comanche became classic horse nomads, this was never easy to do. [...] It was only when the Rangers had adopted classic Comanche tactics of cold camps, forced marches, and use of scouts were they able to alter the dynamic of nomad cavalry attacking fixed settlements. [...] At Little Robe Creek, they in large part succeeded in surprising the Comanche.|$|E
2500|$|Apart from {{creating}} the effects for Clark’s powers, Entity FX {{also has the}} responsibility of dressing up the backgrounds of location shoots. For instance, in a flashback sequence from [...] "Lineage", where Lionel finds his son {{in a field of}} flattened corn, Entity FX had to step in and adjust the scene based on executive producer Ken Horton’s request. The script called for [...] "corn flattened {{as far as the eye}} could see", but Horton wanted a defined stopping point for all the destruction; a wall of corn was digitally erected surrounding the area of trammeled corn stalks. For the final shot of the season finale, where Clark is on a motorcycle heading toward Metropolis, Entity FX had to remove the forests and mountains that occupy the Vancouver landscape and digitally insert hills, extend the road into the distance and create a digital version of Metropolis in the background. In the episode [...] "Insurgence", during the moment when Clark is about to make his leap from the Daily Planet to LuthorCorp, the camera pans around the Daily Planet globe revealing Metropolis in its reflection before shifting down to the roof as Clark walks out. Entity FX created the image of Metropolis by using a computer to combine CG buildings, matte paintings, and real elements from the Vancouver streets. The company also took over the rest of the visual elements for the shot of Clark's actual leap. After Welling was shot on a green screen performing <b>the</b> <b>leap</b> <b>from</b> the Daily Planet, Entity FX performed their usual slowing and quickening of the timing elements, to give the effect of Clark’s speed, as well as added a reflected version of Clark in the LuthorCorp building to illustrate Clark’s impending crash through the glass.|$|E
