25|$|The next model {{produced}} by TVR was the Grantura Mark 1, which used a fastback-style body over the existing chassis design (with the same <b>trailing-arm</b> independent suspension front and rear.) Engine options included the Ford 100E sidevalve (normally aspirated or supercharged), the Ford 105E OHV unit, two different Coventry Climax units, or the MGA's BMC B-series. The {{interior of the}} Grantura was cramped, with the short doors and 17"-diameter steering wheel proving impediments to ingress. Climax-powered cars would be finished with a leather interior, while cars with the lower-specification engines were trimmed with vinyl.|$|E
25|$|In 1949, TVR {{built its}} first {{original}} chassis. The Hotchkis-style rear suspension used the live axle from a Morris Eight, {{and the front}} suspension was of an independent <b>trailing-arm</b> design. The engine was a Ford 1172cc sidevalve from a 1936 van, tuned to 35hp. Even before the car was bodied, it was crashed by the man hired to create the bodywork, Les Dale. After repairs, the body was styled and built from aluminium, and painted British racing green. Although neither Wilkinson nor Pickard found the finished bodywork to be very aesthetically appealing, it was functional, {{and the two men}} conducted the first successful test drive on the runway at Squires Gate aerodrome in 1949. Later that year, TVR Number One was sold to Wilkinson's cousin for £325. It was later crashed and salvaged for parts.|$|E

2500|$|The six-cylinder {{engines that}} were {{introduced}} by AMC in 1964 were continued.

The new Rebels also eliminated the torque tube design used in the Rambler Classic in favor of an open drive shaft with a four-link, <b>trailing-arm</b> rear live axle rear suspension system to provide a more comfortable coil spring ride.

50|$|A {{semi-trailing}} {{arm suspension}} is a supple {{independent rear suspension}} system for automobiles where each wheel hub is located only by a large, roughly triangular arm that pivots at two points. Viewed from the top, the line formed by the two pivots is somewhere between parallel and perpendicular to the car's longitudinal axis; it is generally parallel to the ground. <b>Trailing-arm</b> and multilink suspension designs are much more commonly used for the rear wheels of a vehicle where they can allow for a flatter floor and more cargo room. Many small, front-wheel drive vehicles feature a MacPherson strut front suspension and <b>trailing-arm</b> rear axle.|$|E

50|$|From 1949 to 1962, DKW {{produced}} the Schnellaster with a <b>trailing-arm</b> {{rear suspension system}} with springs in the cross bar assembly. Spanish subsidiary IMOSA produced a modern successor introduced in 1963, the DKW F 1000 L.

5000|$|A <b>trailing-arm</b> suspension, {{sometimes}} referred as trailing-link is a vehicle suspension design {{in which one}} or more arms (or [...] "links") are connected between (and perpendicular to and forward of) the axle and a pivot point (located on the chassis of a motor vehicle). It is typically used on the rear axle of a motor vehicle. A leading arm, as used on the Citroën 2CV and the M422 Mighty Mite, has an arm connected between (and perpendicular to, and to the rear of) the axle and the chassis. It is used on the front axle.|$|E
5000|$|The {{suspension}} system that Lawrence developed and used {{first in the}} DS104 {{came to be called}} the [...] "Lawrence Link" [...] system. Lawrence recalled some late-night discussions with Keith Duckworth as being the foundations of his knowledge of suspension design and it was the principles he learned during these discussions that led him to design the suspension. The Lawrence Link was a <b>trailing-arm</b> suspension where the axes of the trailing links converged towards the car's centre-line. Lawrence was granted a patent for it. When his LawrenceTune Engines business ran into financial troubles in 1963, Lawrence sold the patent to Rover.|$|E
50|$|<b>Trailing-arm</b> {{designs in}} live axle setups often use just {{two or three}} links and a Panhard rod to locate the wheel laterally. A {{trailing}} arm design {{can also be used}} in an independent suspension arrangement. Each wheel hub is located only by a large, roughly triangular arm that pivots at one point, ahead of the wheel. Seen from the side, this arm is roughly parallel to the ground, with the angle changing based on road irregularities. A twist-beam rear suspension is very similar except that the arms are connected by a beam, used to locate the wheels and which twists and has an anti-roll effect.|$|E

50|$|One {{criticism}} of the early 280ZX was a reduction in spring rates, giving a softer ride and making the car rather difficult to drive hard through corners without transient oversteer, which was a feature of <b>trailing-arm</b> rear suspensions. The release of the turbocharged model in 1981 saw {{the introduction of a}} revised rear suspension, which Nissan continued to use in the 1982 and 1983 turbos, as well as the non-turbo from mid-1982 onward. Car and Driver had another complaint of the 280ZX turbo: in a 1981 comparison of several performance cars, they decided that while the acceleration was on par with other sports cars of the era, the braking system was prone to fading away completely before a lap could be completed on their test track.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} multi-epoch Hubble Space Telescope (HST) study of stellar proper motions (PMs) for four fields {{spanning}} 200 degrees along the Sagittarius (Sgr) stream: one trailing arm field, one field near the Sgr dwarf spheroidal tidal radius, and two leading arm fields. We determine absolute PMs {{of dozens of}} individual stars per field, using established techniques that use distant background galaxies as stationary reference frame. Stream stars are identified based on combined color-magnitude diagram and PM information. The results are broadly consistent with the few existing PM measurements for the Sgr galaxy and the trailing arm. However, our new results provide the highest PM accuracy for the stream to date, the first PM measurements for the leading arm, and the first PM measurements for individual stream stars; we also serendipitously determine the PM of the globular cluster NGC~ 6652. In the <b>trailing-arm</b> field, the individual PMs allow us to kinematically separate <b>trailing-arm</b> stars from leading-arm stars that are 360 degrees further ahead in their orbit. Also, in three of our fields we find indications that two distinct kinematical components may exist within the same arm and wrap of the stream. Qualitative comparison of the HST data to the predictions of the Law & Majewski and Penarrubia et al. N-body models show that the PM measurements closely follow the predicted trend with Sgr longitude. This provides a successful consistency check on the PM measurements, {{as well as on}} these N-body approaches (which were not tailored to fit any PM data).

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{discusses the}} active suspension control of vehicle models. It contains two main parts. In {{the first part}} of the thesis, we discuss the necessity of employing active suspension through the analysis of the mechanical networks. We apply classical network theory to show that an active suspension is necessary in half- and full-car vehicle models in certain situations. Typically, these situations involved specifying a soft response from road disturbances as when a soft passive suspension is implemented, and a stiff response from load disturbances as when a stiff passive suspension is implemented. In the second part of the thesis, we derive a parametrisation of the set of all stabilising controllers for a given plant which leaves some pre-specified closed-loop transfer function fixed. To facilitate the parametrisation at the required level of generality we define left and right normalrank factorisations of a rational matrix. We also show that under some certain conditions, the achievable performance of the remaining transmission paths can approximate the original performance set. The results are then studied in the context of quarter-, half- and full-car vehicle models, to derive appropriate controller structures. In the half-car case, we discuss the simplicity assumptions which are required to allow a decomposition of the half-car into two quarter-cars. In the full-car case, we exploit a symmetry assumption to decompose it into the bounce/pitch and roll/warp half-car models. The warp mode is handled in a special way to reduce the twisting forces on the chassis. For complex models, the numerical calculation of the controller structures is also discussed and applied to the double-wishbone models. We also present the <b>trailing-arm</b> model as an example of the main [...] ...|$|E
