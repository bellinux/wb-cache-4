5|$|Another {{important}} experiment {{carried out}} by Wu was the confirmation of the E. M. L. Pryce and John Clive Ward's calculations on the correlation of the quantum polarizations of two photons propagating in opposite directions. This was the first experimental confirmation of quantum results relevant <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of entangled photons as applicable to the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox. Wu later conducted research into the molecular changes in the deformation of hemoglobins that cause sickle-cell disease. She also did research on magnetism, and on the Mössbauer effect during the 1960s. She wrote a textbook with , Beta Decay, {{which was published in}} 1966, and became a standard reference on the subject.|$|E
5|$|Following the club's 4–0 home defeat, United {{returned}} to Open Cup play, where they took on New England Revolution in the MLS qualification semifinals. Hosted at Maryland SoccerPlex in Boyds, the Revolution quickly {{got off to}} a 2–0 lead, thanks <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of goals from Revolution midfielder Kheli Dube. Dube scored in 37th and 47th minutes of play. Twenty minutes following Dube's second goal, Virginia-native Alan Koger gave the Revs a 3–0 lead. Shortly thereafter, United's Branko Bošković scored his first two goals of 2011 to trim the lead down to one goal. The late rally, however, proved to be too little, too late as the Revolution defeated United 3–2. Consequently, {{it was the first time}} since 2002 that United did not qualify into the main tournament propers of the Open Cup.|$|E
5|$|For graphs G and H, the {{question}} of whether G has a homomorphism to H corresponds to a CSP instance with only one kind of constraint, as follows. The variables are the vertices of G and the domain for each variable is the vertex set of H. An evaluation is a function that assigns to each variable an element of the domain, so a function f from V(G) to V(H). Each edge or arc (u,v) of G then corresponds to the constraint ((u,v), E(H)). This is a constraint expressing that the evaluation should map the arc (u,v) <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> (f(u),f(v)) that is in the relation E(H), that is, to an arc of H. A solution to the CSP is an evaluation that respects all constraints, so it is exactly a homomorphism from G to H.|$|E

5|$|I-96 crosses into Ingham County and {{continues}} {{along the southern}} edges of the Lansing metro area. It passes through areas with residential subdivisions and commercial developments, coming <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of interchanges including one for {{the eastern end of}} BL I-96 (Cedar Street). Near the crossing of the Red Cedar River, I-96 goes through the interchange for I-496/US127. East of that interchange, the freeway begins to exit the metro area as the landscape transitions back to farm fields. I-96 continues eastward, bypassing Williamston and Webberville to the south. Near the latter, the freeway turns more southeasterly and crosses into Livingston County.|$|E
5|$|M-85, {{also known}} as Fort Street or Fort Road for its entire length, is a state {{trunkline}} highway in the U.S. state of Michigan. The highway serves several Downriver suburbs of Detroit, as well as neighborhoods in the city itself. From its southern terminus at exit28 on Interstate75 (I-75) to its second interchange with exit43 on I-75 in southwest Detroit, M-85 {{is part of the}} Lake Erie Circle Tour. In between, it serves mostly residential areas running parallel <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of rail lines; the highway carries between 5,000 and 43,000vehicles per day on average. Once in the city of Detroit, Fort Street runs parallel to I-75 for several miles before they separate near the Ambassador Bridge. The northern end of M-85 is at the intersection with Griswold Street in downtown Detroit, one block away from Campus Martius Park.|$|E
5|$|NY421 {{begins at}} a dead end south of the hamlet of Horseshoe in an {{isolated}} part {{of the town of}} Piercefield. Here, the highway connects <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of dirt roads, one of which leads north alongside Horseshoe Lake to Horseshoe. The two-lane route heads eastward from the trails, following the southern shore of Horseshoe Lake while traversing the deep woods of Adirondack Park. At the southeastern end of the lake, NY421 turns northeastward, crossing a small stream feeding into the lake before curving back toward the east. For the next , the road passes through unabated wilderness as it heads toward the western shoreline of Tupper Lake.|$|E

5|$|Plato, in his Laws, {{set forth}} rules that governed not the ideal state, which he {{described}} in The Republic, but what he felt might be obtainable in the real world. Included amongst them were some dealing with inheritance and heiresses. In general outline, they conformed to Athenian practice, with {{the daughter of a}} man who died without male heirs becoming an epikleros. Plato gave rules governing who the husband of the epikleros might be, and said that the inherited plot might not be divided or added to another plot. The main departure from Athenian law came if there was no direct heir, and the inheritance go to collateral relations. In that case, Plato assigned the inheritance not to one person, but <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair,</b> one male and one female, and ordered that they must marry and provide an heir to the estate, much like the epikleros.|$|E
5|$|The {{site was}} {{approved}} in 1934, {{under the supervision}} of CORF (Commission d'Organisation des Régions Fortifiées), the Maginot Line's design and construction agency. Work by the contractor Chanel of Antibes began in 1935 at a cost of 14.5 million francs. A second phase was planned to add an artillery block. This was scaled back <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of separate artillery casemates. A separate entrance block was proposed in April 1940, linking to the casemates. As the initial confrontation with Germany was already underway, {{it was too late to}} be built, with a projected construction time of 18 months.|$|E
5|$|The two {{roots of}} any {{quadratic}} equation {{may be of}} three possible types: two different real numbers, two identical real numbers (i.e., a degenerate double root), or a pair of complex conjugate roots. The first case corresponds to the usual situation; each pair of roots corresponds <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of solutions that are related by circle inversion, as described below (Figure6). In the second case, both roots are identical, corresponding to a solution circle that transforms into itself under inversion. In this case, one of the given circles is itself {{a solution to the}} Apollonius problem, and the number of distinct solutions is reduced by one. The third case of complex conjugate radii does not correspond to a geometrically possible solution for Apollonius' problem, since a solution circle cannot have an imaginary radius; therefore, the number of solutions is reduced by two. Interestingly, Apollonius' problem cannot have seven solutions, although it may have any other number of solutions from zero to eight.|$|E

5|$|Dunston Power Station refers <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of {{adjacent}} {{coal-fired power}} {{stations in the}} North East of England, now demolished. They were built on the south bank of the River Tyne, in the western outskirts of Dunston in Gateshead. The two stations were built on a site which is now occupied by the MetroCentre. The first power station built on the site was known as Dunston A Power Station, and the second, which gradually replaced it between 1933 and 1950, was known as Dunston B Power Station. The A Station was, in its time, {{one of the largest}} in the country, and as well as burning coal had early open cycle gas turbine units. The B Station was the first of a new power station design, and stood as a landmark in the Tyne for over 50years. From the A Station's opening in 1910 until the B Station's demolition in 1986, they collectively operated from the early days of electricity generation in the United Kingdom, through the industry's nationalisation, and until a decade before its privatisation.|$|E
5|$|The two routes {{continue}} {{to the southeast}} through business areas, meeting CR 575 and a ramp to the Atlantic City Expressway. CR 575 turns east to follow US 40/US 322. The road enters Egg Harbor Township, and CR 575 splits from US 40/US 322 by turning to the south. The route passes more wooded residential and commercial areas, {{as well as the}} Storybook Land amusement park, before intersecting CR 563. US 40/US 322 forms a concurrency with that route and passes through a business district that includes the Harbor Square shopping center. CR 563 splits from the road by continuing southeast and the Black Horse Pike heads east interchange with the Garden State Parkway. The only direct ramp present is between the Black Horse Pike westbound and the Garden State Parkway northbound; all other movements are provided by CR 563. Past here, US 40/US 322 continues east past more businesses, crossing CR 651 before entering Pleasantville. In Pleasantville, the road crosses US 9, where the name changes to Verona Avenue. Upon crossing CR 585, the Black Horse Pike continues past residences as an undivided road, crossing back into Egg Harbor Township. The road passes more businesses, closely paralleling the Atlantic City Expressway before entering Atlantic City. Here, the name becomes Albany Avenue and it comes <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of ramps that provide access to and from the Black Horse Pike eastbound and the Atlantic City Expressway westbound. US 40/US 322 enters marshland, crossing the Great Thorofare onto Great Island before passing over the Beach Thorofare. Past this bridge, the road passes between businesses to the west and the closed Bader Field airport and the abandoned Bernie Robbins Stadium to the east. US 40/US 322 crosses the Inside Thorofare on a drawbridge and continues as a county maintained road to its end at Atlantic Avenue and Pacific Avenue, one block from the boardwalk. Through New Jersey, US 40 serves as a main road connecting Atlantic City with points south along Interstate 95, such as Baltimore and Washington, D.C.|$|E
