5|$|The same {{building}} {{was also the}} site of the discovery in 1918 of a bronze bust of outstanding quality depicting Cato the Younger. One of the most notable artefacts discovered at Volubilis, it is now on display in the Archaeological Museum in Rabat. It was still on its original pedestal when it was found by archaeologists. The bust has been dated to the time of Nero or Vespasian and may be a copy of a bust created in Cato's lifetime or shortly thereafter. Its inscription identifies its subject as the orator. Another outstanding bust, depicting a Hellenistic prince, was discovered in a bakery across the street. It seems to have been made {{at the same time as}} <b>the</b> <b>Cato</b> bust and may well have come from the House of Venus, where an empty pedestal in another room suggests that <b>the</b> <b>Cato</b> had a companion piece. The bust, which is also on display in Rabat, is usually identified as Juba II but other possibilities include Hiero II of Syracuse, Cleomenes III of Sparta, Juba I or Hannibal.|$|E

The arrest was not straightforward, and a scuffle ensued. The Naval and Military Gazette (May 1845) identified Sergeant Graham as the man who saved FitzClarence's life.|$|E
5|$|The Fifth Ward Wardroom is {{historically}} significant {{as a historical}} reminder of the pivotal time in which Pawtucket was incorporated as a city and gave up its town-meeting form of governance. The building is also architecturally significant as a rare type of building, wardrooms, {{and is one of}} three extant examples in Rhode Island. William R. Walker & Son constructed three such structures in Pawtucket with the First Ward Wardroom being extant and the third example having been demolished. Though both constructed by William R. Walker & Son, the two Pawtucket wardrooms are related, but not identical in construction and show variations by the firm. Another wardroom, with a bungalow style, is located in <b>the</b> <b>Cato</b> Hill Historic District in Woonsocket, Rhode Island. The Fifth Ward Wardroom was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} fall of Phnom Penh to Vietnamese forces and their Kampuchean allies in January 1979, representatives of Democratic Kampuchea called for an {{emergency}} meeting of the United Nations Security Council, so Prince Norodom Sihanouk could present the deposed regime's case. Despite strong objections from the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia, the UN Security Council gave Sihanouk this chance. Although Sihanouk distanced himself from the human rights abuses of the Khmer Rouge, he accused Vietnam of using aggression to violate Kampuchea’s sovereignty. As such, he demanded all UN countries to suspend aid to Vietnam and not recognise the Vietnamese-installed regime. Subsequently, seven non-aligned members of the UN Security Council submitted a draft resolution calling for a ceasefire and the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Kampuchea, which was endorsed by the People's Republic of China, France, Norway, Portugal, the United States and the United Kingdom. However, the resolution was not approved due to strong opposition from the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia. Ted Galen Carpenter, a foreign policy analyst from <b>the</b> <b>Cato</b> Institute argues that Vietnam did not invade Cambodia out of any noble desire to stop the atrocities committed by Pol Pot's regime but rather to consolidate their domination of Indochina.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> Distichs of <b>Cato</b> {{was most}} {{commonly}} referred to as simply [...] "Cato". In the Middle Ages it was assumed the work had been written by <b>Cato</b> <b>the</b> Elder, or even <b>Cato</b> <b>the</b> Younger. <b>Cato</b> <b>the</b> Elder was assumed to have included tracts of the prose in his Carmen de Moribus, but this was found to be a later addition. It was eventually attributed to the anonymous author Dionysius Cato (also known as Catunculus) from the 3rd or 4th century AD, based upon evidence in a manuscript discussed by Julius Caesar Scaliger (1484-1558). This manuscript no longer exists, though Scaliger found it authoritative.|$|R

Priscus, like Major, may have been merely an epithet used to distinguish him from <b>the</b> later <b>Cato</b> of Utica. There is no precise information as to when he first received <b>the</b> title of <b>Cato,</b> which may have been given in childhood as a symbol of distinction. The qualities implied in <b>the</b> word <b>Cato</b> were acknowledged by the plainer and less outdated title of Sapiens, by which he was so well known in his old age, that Cicero says, it became his virtual cognomen. From the number and eloquence of his speeches, he was a styled orator, but <b>Cato</b> <b>the</b> Censor (<b>Cato</b> Censorius), and <b>Cato</b> <b>the</b> Elder are now his most common, as well as his most characteristic names, since he carried out the office of Censor with extraordinary standing and was <b>the</b> only <b>Cato</b> who ever held it.|$|R

Additional backing for the founding of the Institute came from Mises's wife, Margit, Henry Hazlitt, Lawrence Fertig, and Friedrich Hayek.

5000|$|<b>The</b> surname <b>Cato</b> {{is said to}} {{have been}} {{bestowed}} upon <b>Cato</b> <b>the</b> Elder in consequence of his shrewdness; before this, Plutarch says that he bore the cognomen Priscus, [...] "the elder". [...] However, it may be that like Major, Priscus simply distinguished him from his descendant, Cato Uticensis, and was erroneously supposed to have dated to <b>the</b> elder <b>Cato's</b> lifetime. <b>The</b> same man also bore the epithets of Sapiens, the wise, Orator, and most famously, Censorius, from his tenure as censor.|$|R
5000|$|The {{themes of}} the poem were {{influenced}} by John Trenchard and Thomas Gordon who wrote <b>the</b> <b>Cato's</b> Letters, a series of letters on religion, sin, and suffering under <b>the</b> pseudonym <b>Cato.</b> They promoted <b>the</b> belief that suffering originated in vice, and that man is ever subject to passions that cannot be controlled. This is connected to Coleridge experiencing both suffering and guilt over what he described later as his loss of innocence. In [...] "Easter Holidays", Coleridge describes the time of innocence {{as in the past}} although others that he attends school with are still joyful and innocent.|$|R
