50|$|He {{was chief}} {{administrative}} officer in Sør-Trøndelag County Municipality, then {{chief administrative officer}} in Trondheim. While chief administrative officer in Trondheim, he was under police investigation for an attempt to purchase a municipal lot next to his own. In 2000, he asked to purchase a lot in Reppe, which he was granted from the municipality. But the County Governor rejected the transaction, as the lot was within a recreational area. The politicians then passed a new area plan, which stated that the lot {{would be allowed to}} be used for building. The city administration did an error and colored the official planning maps green, for recreational areas, and then afterwards made a <b>technical</b> <b>correction</b> to change it to yellow. When the sale of the lot was voted over again in 2004, after Sæther was no longer chief of administration, and Sæther was again permitted to purchase the lot. But the County Governor again terminated the sale, stating that the correction was not valid. This resulted in arguing between the municipality and the County Governor, and the politicians and the municipal administration. Sæther was never allowed to purchase the lot and was instead reported to the police for corruption, nepotism and forgery. The charges were dropped by the police.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} paper is to give axiomatic {{characterization}} of quantum relative entropy utilizing resource conversion scenario. We consider two sets of axioms: non-asymptotic and asymptotic.

In the latter setting, we prove uniqueness of quantum relative entropy, that is, D^Q(ρ||σ) should equal a constant multiple of D(ρ||σ). In the analysis, we define and use reverse test and asymptotic reverse test, which are natural inverse of hypothesis test. Comment: A new proof of joint convexity of D^R is added.

40|$|Language {{for special}} {{purposes}} ("LSP") is {{a variety of}} standard language, whose primary objective is exchange of information among specialists (speakers {{of one or more}} languages). Among other things, the LSP speciality consists of lexical units, so-called technical vocabulary, included in technical dictionaries. This thesis deals with issues regarding the creation of a German-Czech Dictionary of Aerial Terms, a multilingual technical dictionary, which is primarily designed for translators, interpreters, students and readers of popular science texts and easier LSP literature. The core of the dictionary consists of vocabulary from the area of aircraft construction and types of airplanes, aircraft engine, equipment and emergency devices. By comparing concept systems from subareas of both languages, an essential analysis regarding questions in the fields of synonymy and equivalence was accomplished, and 500 vocabulary items with linguistic as well as encyclopaedic information were compiled.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the extension of}} classical 2 -dimensional topological quantum field theories to Klein topological quantum field theories which allow unorientable surfaces. We approach this using the theory of modular operads by introducing a new operad governing associative algebras with involution. This operad is Koszul and we identify the dual dg operad governing A-infinity algebras with involution in terms of Mobius graphs which are a generalisation of ribbon graphs. We then generalise open topological conformal field theories to open Klein topological conformal field theories and give a generators and relations description of the open KTCFT operad. We deduce an analogue of the ribbon graph decomposition of the moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces: a Mobius graph decomposition of the moduli spaces of Klein surfaces (real algebraic curves). The Mobius graph complex then computes the homology of these moduli spaces. We also obtain a different graph complex computing the homology of the moduli spaces of admissible stable symmetric Riemann surfaces which are partial compactifications of the moduli spaces of Klein surfaces.

40|$|This {{paper was}} written, apart from one <b>technical</b> <b>correction,</b> in July and August of 2013. The, then very recent, {{breakthrough}} of Y.

A complete and connected version of the proof, in our style but not intended for journal publication, seemed a natural first step in this project. Following the further spectacular advance given by J. Maynard (arXiv: 1311. 4600, Nov 20, 2013), {{we have had to}} re-think our position. Maynard's method, at least in its current form, proceeds from GPY in quite a different direction than does Zhang's, and achieves numerically superior results. Consequently, although Zhang's contribution to the distribution of primes in arithmetic progressions certainly retains its importance, the fact remains that much of the material in this paper would no longer appear in a new edition of our book. Because this paper contains some innovations that we do not wish to become lost, we have decided to make the work publicly available in its current form...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The phrase program {{specialization}} &quot; was de ned by Jones et al. in 1993 {{to capture}} {{the idea of a}} specializer being strong enough to remove entire layers of interpretation. As it has become clear that it does not imply &quot; in the everyday meaning of the word, we propose to rename the concept -optimality&quot;. We argue that the 1993 de nition of Jones-optimality is in principle impossible to ful l for strongly typed languages due to necessary encodings on the inputs and outputs of a well-typed self-interpreter. We propose a <b>technical</b> <b>correction</b> of the de nition which allows Jones-optimality to remain a meaningful concept for typed languages. We extend recent work by Hughes and by Taha and Makholm on the long-unsolved problem of Jones-optimal specialization for strongly typed languages. The methods of Taha and Makholm are enhanced to allow optimal &quot; results when a self-interpreter is specialized to a typeincorrect program; how to do this has been an open problem since 1987. Neither Hughes ' nor TahaMakholm's methods are by themselves su-cient for Jones-optimal specialization when the language contains primitive operations that produce or consume complex data types. A simple postprocess is proposed to solve the problem. An implementation of the proposed techniques has been produced and used for the rst successful practical experiments with truly Jones-optimal specialization for strongly typed languages...|$|E
40|$|The conormal lift of a link K in ^ 3 is a Legendrian submanifold Λ_K in {{the unit}} cotangent bundle U^* ^ 3 of ^ 3 with contact {{structure}} equal to the kernel of the Liouville form. Knot contact homology, a topological link invariant of K, {{is defined as the}} Legendrian homology of Λ_K, the homology of a differential graded algebra generated by Reeb chords whose differential counts holomorphic disks in the symplectization × U^*^ 3 with Lagrangian boundary condition ×Λ_K. We perform an explicit and complete computation of the Legendrian homology of Λ_K for arbitrary links K in terms of a braid presentation of K, confirming a conjecture that this invariant agrees with a previously-defined combinatorial version of knot contact homology. The computation uses a double degeneration: the braid degenerates toward a multiple cover of the unknot which in turn degenerates to a point. Under the first degeneration, holomorphic disks converge to gradient flow trees with quantum corrections. The combined degenerations give rise to a new generalization of flow trees called multiscale flow trees. The theory of multiscale flow trees is the key tool in our computation and is already proving to be useful for other computations as well.
