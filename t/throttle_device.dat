The angle of attack was varied from α = - 2 ° to α = 2 °, and the sideslip angle was varied from β = 0 ° to β = 2 ° in between different test runs. The internal contraction ratio of the inlet was varied between I = 1. 17 and I = 1. 52 {{by the use of}} cowl inserts that changed the position of the cowls leading edge.

40|$|As {{the digital}} age engulfs our society, more and more devices {{surrender}} to the inevitable fate of digital control. Routinely, digital electronics replace traditional mechanical systems usually yielding an improvement in cost, size, weight, durability, performance, repeatability, and power consumption. As of the date of this document, no commercially available automobile {{is equipped with a}} digitally controlled <b>throttling</b> <b>device</b> for their air conditioning system. A primary reason for this is economics. Automotive manufactures cannot justify the additional costs associated with a microcontroller and an electronically controlled <b>throttling</b> <b>device,</b> even if they significantly improve performance and durability. As electronics become smaller, cheaper, "smarter", and faster, electronic alternatives to traditional systems become increasingly prevalent. Most techniques of actively controlling the performance of vapor-compression air conditioning system use evaporator superheat as the feedback parameter. Unfortunately, any amount of superheat causes the evaporator to operate at reduced capacity due to dramatically lower heat transfer coefficients in the superheated region. This document presents and defends a system that allows a vapor-compression air conditioning system to be stably controlled in a regime where liquid and vapor refrigerant are exiting the evaporator. The uniqueness of this system is attributed to the feedback transducer. The transducer is able to deliver a signal to the controller that {{is a function of the}} amount (by mass) of liquid droplets impinging on the transducer. By placing the transducer in the stream of refrigerant exiting the evaporator, a refrigerant <b>throttling</b> <b>device</b> can be manipulated to regulate the amount of liquid refrigerant that impinges the feedback transducer. With the signal from this transducer as the feedback in a control scheme, a controller can be constructed that essentially regulates system performance, and is able to control the system in regimes where superheat feedback is unable to operate.

40|$|In {{design and}} {{operation}} of the hydraulic drive a with throttle control {{it is necessary to}} know the relationship between the pressure drop in the throttle controller and the flow of the working fluid flowing through it. To define this relationship it is necessary to know the area of hole at the throttling channel inlet and the value of flow rate. Experience shows that manufacturing process capabilities disable us to provide a completely circular hole at the inlet of a cylindrical throttle channel and exclude having a chamfer. In this case, it is impossible to use a direct method to measure the actual design value of the area obtained as a result of manufacturing the throttle channel. The paper proposes the indirect method to determine a design area. The method is {{based on the fact that}} the flow rates at the same Reynolds number, lying in the zone of self-similarity, with fluid flow through the cylindrical channel having a circular cross section in separated state are equal to the flow rate of a sharpedged hole in the thin wall. In order to assess the correctness of the indirect method are experimentally studied <b>throttle</b> <b>device</b> models with cylindrical throttle channels of different geometric dimensions and models with a sharp-edged hole in the thin wall. The experimental studies have found that for models with cylinderical throttle channels, design values of the inlet area received by indirect method lie between the values of the area determined by direct measurement of the outer and inner diameters of the chamfer. Graphs of the flow rate as a function of the Reynolds number obtained from the experimentally determined dependence of the flow on the available head and taking into account the value of the hole areas defined by an indirect method coincided for all models with the cylinderical throttle channels and for the model with a circular hole in a thin wall in the range of Reynolds numbers from 104 до 106. The assessment results allow us to draw a conclusion that the indirect method to determine the design area of the throttle channel inlet is correct and recommend this method for practical use. </p...|$|E

In so doing, it also seeks to assess the wider diagnostic potential of flow field computational techniques in internal combustion engine designs. Full-scale models, comprising simplified representations of the induction tract, <b>throttling</b> <b>device,</b> inlet valve and cylinder, have been manufactured in Perspex for steady-state water analogy tests. The resulting photographs of flow tracers in a variety of viewing planes provide a clear, but qualitative, picture of the princi - pal features of the flow in the models under study. The essentially qualitative data obtained from water analogy tests are complemented by limited hot wire velocity measurements at particular stations in the Perspex models, with air replacing the water as the flow medium. These data, supplemented by information in the literature, provide the framework for comparisons with an extensive computational simulation of induction flows which are performed using the general purpose PHOENICS code developed by CHAM. These studies include both transient and steady state predictions. The statistically stationary turbulent flow field through alternative induction system <b>throttling</b> <b>devices</b> -a conventional butterfly valve and a variable geometry ramp restriction- are modelled computationally and compared with water analogy flow visualization. The principal flow field characteristics are satisfactorily reproduced, including in particular the extent of the recirculation zone in the lee of the throttle and the relative persistence of the turbulence generated downstream for varying throat apertures. That generated by the two-dimensional variable geometry ramp is predicted to be both higher and persist beyond the inlet valve into the cylinder producing discernible swirl at high throttle settings. The limited quantitative comparisons with hot wire velocity measurements lend further support to the more detailed aspects of the computational predictions. Finally, comparisons are made between PHOENICS predictions and Laser-Doppler measurements of velocity for transient flow inside an axisymmetric motored piston-cylinder assembly, for different valve seat angles, reported in the literature.

Cost of power makes HPRM's attractive with recoveries as small as 25 hp on a continuous basis. When incorporated into new plants, expansions, or revamps, payback can occur in as little as six months. When adapted to existing installations, payback may require 12 to 18 months depending on the extent of new hardware necessary. Because it is a positive displacement device, the HPRM torque and speed are almost completely independent - unlike hydraulic power recovery turbines (centrifugal motors). Three screw HPRM's have low moments of inertia, operate at low vibration and noise levels and extract power in the 70 - 85 % efficiency range. Output power levels to 600 hp and differential pressures to 2500 psi are possible. A primary application for the HPRM is driving process pumps. Where a full capacity process pump is used, an HPRM can through-drive it augmenting the primary driver and reducing power requirements by Higher speed special designs also are available 75 %...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we develop an {{algorithm}} for peak load reduction {{to reduce the}} impact of increased air conditioner usage in a residential smart grid community. We develop Demand Response Management (DRM) plans that clearly spell out the maximum duration as well as maximum severity of inconvenience. We model the air conditioner as a power <b>throttling</b> <b>device</b> and for any given DRM plan we study the impact of {{increasing the number of}} power states on the resulting peak load reduction. Through simulations, we find out that adding just one additional state to the basic ON/OFF model, which can throttle power to 50 % of the rated air conditioner power, can result in significant amount of peak reduction. However, the peak load that can be reduced is diminishing with the increase in number of states. Furthermore, we also observe the impact of inconvenience duration and inconvenience severity in terms of peak load reduction. These observations can serve as useful guidelines for developing appropriate DRM plans. Comment: 6 pages, 2 figures, 1 table, conference pape...|$|R
40|$|This work formulates {{a unified}} set of {{boundary}} conditions to efficiently represent {{the majority of}} valve and orifice devices found in water supply, transmission, and distribution systems. A particularly useful combination of mathematical components results when a lumped inertia model is linked with a <b>throttling</b> <b>device.</b> This combination of elements, termed a pipe replacement element/valve-in-line (PREVIL), has been constructed to permit {{a wide range of}} control-valve/short-pipe combinations to be conveniently modeled with the method of characteristics. The solution is quadratic in form and explicit, regardless of the number of pipes that are connected to the boundary condition. A variety of on-off and modulating valves can be accurately handled within this framework. An additional feature developed in this treatment of pressure-reducing and pressure-sustaining valves, how controllers, and other similar devices permits a more realistic representation of these important control devices. The response time of the regulating valve on opening or closing can be readily approximated so that a greater range of control behavior can be simulated. Application of the combined boundary condition is illustrated in a pipe network...|$|R
40|$|A {{device to}} be used with an {{aircraft}} simulator to apply positive and negative g forces to the pilot's arm is described. An arm harness fits around the arm which the pilot uses to operate the <b>throttle.</b> The <b>device</b> allows the harness to track intentional arm movements without exerting any restraining forces, and at the same time, applies g forces to to the pilots arm which are recorded by the aircraft simulator computer...|$|R
