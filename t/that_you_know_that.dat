Reading it one suddenly realizes that one is {{in the presence of}} an American classic." [...] In a 2002 interview with Taylor, Susan Settlemyre Williams proposed Emily Dickinson, Marianne Moore, and Elizabeth Bishop as possible influences, but Taylor herself acknowledged Edna St. Vincent Millay as the poet she had read enthusiastically as a student, and who had [...] "made me feel that poetry was contemporary and could relate to me right now, in the way <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> all those wonderful heroines of poetry and heroes do, ...".|$|E

I should {{not mention the}} matter {{if it were not}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are now one of ourselves, and that the facts might come to your ears in some harsher form if I were silent upon them.

I {{shall not}} attempt {{to do any of}} this for you; I {39} assume, in giving this advice, that you wish to pursue the science of botany as your chief study; I have only broken moments for it, {{snatched}} from my chief occupations, and I have done nothing myself of all this I tell you to do. But so far as you can work in this manner, even if you only ascertain the history of one plant, so <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> accurately, you will have helped to lay the foundation of a true science of botany, from which the mass of useless nomenclature,[17] now mistaken for science, will fall away, as the husk of a poppy falls from the bursting flower.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{must go back}} a bit. You seem to know everything, so I expect <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> I met {{her when}} she was a {{passenger}} and I was first officer of the ROCK OF GIBRALTAR. From the first day I met her, she was the only woman to me. Every day of that voyage I loved her more, and many a time since have I kneeled down {{in the darkness of the}} night watch and kissed the deck of that ship because I knew her dear feet had trod it. She was never engaged to me. She treated me as fairly as ever a woman treated a man. I have no complaint to make. It was all love on my side, and all good comradeship and friendship on hers. When we parted she was a free woman, but I could never again be a free man.|$|E
6000|$|... 3. You must, therefore, {{commence}} {{with the}} philosophic {{idea of the}} thing, {{the true nature of}} which you wish to find out and manifest. You must carry your rule ready made, if you wish to measure aright. If you ask me how I can know that this idea--my own invention--is the truth, by which the phenomena of history are to be explained, I answer, in the same way exactly <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> your eyes were made to see with; and that is, because you do see with them. If I propose to you an idea or self-realizing theory of the constitution, which shall manifest itself as in existence from the earliest times to the present,--which shall comprehend within it all the facts which history has preserved, and shall give them a meaning as interchangeably causals or effects;--if I show you that such an event or reign was an obliquity to the right hand, and how produced, and such other event or reign a deviation to the left, and whence originating,--that the growth was stopped here, accelerated there,--that such a tendency is, and always has been, corroborative, and such other tendency destructive, of the main progress of the idea towards realization;--if this idea, not only like a kaleidoscope, shall reduce all the miscellaneous fragments into order, but shall also minister strength, and knowledge, and light to the true patriot and statesmen for working out the bright thought, and bringing the glorious embryo to a perfect birth;--then, I think, I have a right to say that the idea which led to this is not only true, but the truth, the only truth. To set up for a statesman upon historical knowledge only, is as about as wise as to set up for a musician by the purchase of some score flutes, fiddles, and horns. In order to make music, you must know how to play; in order to make your facts speak truth, you must know what the truth is which ought to be proved,--the ideal truth,--the truth which was consciously or unconsciously, strongly or weakly, wisely or blindly, intended at all times.[1] ...|$|E
