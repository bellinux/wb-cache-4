25|$|There {{are many}} <b>threading</b> {{processes}} including: <b>cutting</b> <b>threads</b> with a tap or die, thread milling, single-point <b>thread</b> <b>cutting,</b> <b>thread</b> rolling, cold root rolling and forming, and thread grinding.

2500|$|Single-point threading, also colloquially called single-pointing (or just <b>thread</b> <b>cutting</b> {{when the}} context is implicit), is an {{operation}} that uses a single-point tool to produce a thread form on a cylinder or cone. The tool moves [...] while the precise rotation of the workpiece determines {{the lead of the}} thread. The process can be done to create external or internal threads (male or female). In external <b>thread</b> <b>cutting,</b> the piece can either be held in a chuck or mounted between two centers. With internal <b>thread</b> <b>cutting,</b> the piece is held in a chuck. The tool moves across the piece linearly, taking chips off the workpiece with each pass. Usually 5 to 7 light cuts create the correct depth of the thread.|$|R
40|$|This paper studies {{causes of}} scrap occurrence, wear and {{breakage}} of cutters during <b>thread</b> <b>cutting</b> of steel sleeves poured in Al die castings of motor car engine components. It {{was concluded that}} the reason for occurrence of problems with <b>thread</b> <b>cutting</b> of sleeves most probably should be attributed to the fact whether hardness value reaches 200 HB or over 250 HB. The most probable reason for over wear and consequently to breakage of cutters and scrap occurrence, although castings display top quality, {{lies in the fact that}} the internal diameter of sleeves frequently falls down under minimally allowed tolerances for threaded sleeves...|$|R

For {{internal}} threads, solid cutters are generally limited to holes larger than , and indexable internal <b>thread</b> <b>cutting</b> tools {{are limited to}} holes larger than [...] The advantage {{is that when the}} insert wears out it is easily and more cost effectively replaced. The disadvantage is the cycle time is generally longer than solid tools. Note that solid multiple-form <b>thread</b> <b>cutting</b> tools look similar to taps, but they differ in that the cutting tool does not have a backtaper and there is not a lead-in chamfer. This lack of a lead-in chamfer allows the threads to be formed within one pitch length of the bottom of a blind hole.|$|R

5000|$|A common {{method of}} <b>threading</b> is <b>cutting</b> with taps and dies. Unlike drill bits, hand taps do not {{automatically}} remove the chips they create. A hand tap cannot cut its threads {{in a single}} rotation because it creates long chips which quickly jam the tap (an effect known as [...] "crowding"), possibly breaking it. Therefore, in manual <b>thread</b> <b>cutting,</b> normal wrench usage is to cut the threads 1/2 to 2/3 of a turn (180 to 240 degree rotation), then reverse the tap for about 1/6 of a turn (60 degrees) until the chips are broken by the back edges of the cutters. It {{may be necessary to}} periodically remove the tap from the hole to clear the chips, especially when a blind hole is threaded.|$|R

Of course, this fact highlights the importance of the moldmakers getting the mold just right (in preparation for millions of cycles, usually at high speed).|$|R
