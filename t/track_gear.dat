50|$|The car {{now known}} as the No. 6 car debuted at Daytona in 1997 as the No. 9 car. Jeff Burton drove the <b>Track</b> <b>Gear</b> {{sponsored}} Ford Taurus to a 40th-place finish. During the 1997 season, Robbie Crouch, Ted Musgrave, and Rob Wilson drove the No. 9 on limited schedules, with a best finish coming from Crouch at Loudon. Over the next six years, Burton drove to 16 wins with additional sponsorships from Northern Light, Febreze, and Gain, among others. After Burton left Roush Racing midway through 2004, Mark Martin returned to the Busch Series, posting four top-10s in five starts. In 2005, Martin ran five races and won twice. The car switched to the No. 6 in 2006, after a number switch with Evernham Motorsports, and ran a part-time schedule sponsored by Ameriquest. In 2007, David Ragan drove the car full-time in 2007 using the No. 06 owner's points, with sponsorship coming from the Discount Tire Company. After a 5th-place finish in points, Ragan was named Rookie of the Year. After running full-time in 2008, Ragan went to part-time and won the 2009 Aaron's 312 for his first Nationwide series victory as well as a win at Bristol. Rookie Erik Darnell filled {{out the rest of the}} schedule with Northern Tool and Equipment sponsoring. He won a pole and had two top-fives, but was unable to return the next season due to a lack of funding.|$|E

The conceptual track, CDS 101, which is mainly discussed in the paper, is intended for advanced students in science and engineering who can benefit from an overview of control techniques but who might not have the need for the mathematical depth underlying the material. Special attention is paid to ensuring that the course is accessible to students from biological, physical, and information sciences, using examples from these domains to illustrate concepts. The goal of the course is to enable students to use the principles and tools of feedback in their research activities...|$|R

50|$|The early {{models of}} Mochet's 'La bicyclette de l'Avenir' (The bicycle of the Future), the 'Vélo-Vélocar', or 'V-V' as the factory {{referred}} to them, used a 40mm steel-tube, single-beam frame and 450 x 55 wheels with handlebars over the rider and steering torque transmitted by bevel gears.

40|$|This {{project has}} been {{sponsored}} by QinetiQ Limited (QinetiQ); whose aim it is to model the dynamics of a prototype high-speed military tracked vehicle. Specifically their objective is to describe the mechanism by which force inputs are transmitted from the ground to the vehicle’s hull. Many <b>track</b> running <b>gear</b> components are steel and can be modelled as simple lumped masses or as linear springs without internal damping. These present no difficulty to the modeller. However <b>tracked</b> vehicle running <b>gear</b> also has nonlinear components that require more detailed descriptions. Models for two rubber components, the road wheel tyre and track link bush, and {{a model for the}} suspensions rotary damper, are developed here. These three components all have highly nonlinear dynamic responses. Rubber component nonlinearities are caused by the materials nonlinear elastic and viscoelastic characteristics. Stiffness is amplitude dependent and the material exhibits a significant amount of internal damping, which is predominantly Coulombic in nature but also relaxes overtime. In this work, a novel method for measuring the elastic and viscoelastic response of Carbon Black Filled Natural Rubber components has been devised and a ‘general purpose’ mathematical model developed that describes the materials response and is suited to use in multibody dynamic analysis software. The vehicle’s suspension rotary damper model describes three viscous flow regimes (laminar, turbulent and pressure relief), as a continuous curved response that relates angular velocity to damping torque. Hysteresis due to the compression of entrapped gas, compliance of the dampers structure and compression of damper oil is described by a single non-parametric equation. Friction is considered negligible and is omitted from the model. All components are modelled using MSC. ADAMS TM multibody dynamic analysis software. The models are shown to be easily implemented and computationally robust. QinetiQ’s requirement for ‘practical’ <b>track</b> running <b>gear</b> component models has been met.
