50|$|In {{the home}} shop the {{radial arm saw}} is an {{alternative}} to the table saw. Both machines can rip, crosscut, do simple and compound miters, dado, mold or shape, make tenons, make open mortises, taper cut, and rabbet. The radial arm saw requires less clearance or space in the shop to handle long stock, since it only requires clearance on the sides, whereas a table saw needs clearance to the sides, in front and at the back. The radial saw is perfectly efficient backed up against a wall, whereas the table saw needs to be placed {{in the center of the}} shop to give all around clearance. With some accessories the former can be used as a shaper, a disk or drum sander, a grinder, a surface planer, a router, a horizontal boring machine and even as a power unit for a lathe; whereas a table saw's secondary uses are limited to shaper and disk sander. The major shortcoming of most current radial arm saws for home-use is that, most radial arm saws that have been built after the early 1960s are manufactured with stamped sheet metal parts and are machined to loose tolerances, hence they are not precise for doing accurate work without 'tuning'. A high-quality radial arm saw has carefully machined <b>track</b> <b>arm</b> ways and locking mechanisms, and a motor that runs very smoothly; under 'no-load' conditions most of the sound and vibration will originate from the whisper/whistling and the imbalance of the saw blade upon the arbor.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} improve the ability of {{obstacle}} negotiation and stability of mobile robot under unstructured environment, {{a new type of}} planetary gear and track hybrid mobile robot has been designed. This robot can surmount lower obstacles by its gravity and inertia of epicyclic gear train, otherwise, higher obstacles can be negotiated by the track arms. The two-part body connected by universal coupling can adjust to different terrain. Also, key parts of the robot were analyzed by ANSYS. According to the analysis results, an optimization design has been put forward. The analysis results can be concluded that the total deformation of the <b>track</b> <b>arm</b> can be reduced from 289 mm to 41. 9 mm and the stiffness was improved...|$|E

Other “seventh generation” television consoles {{use a different}} strategy, featuring hand-held controllers to <b>track</b> <b>arm</b> motion. The Nintendo Wiimote 11 is tracked {{by a combination of}} built-in accelerometers and IR detection to sense position in 3 -space. The Sony PlayStation Move 12 features wand controllers with glowing, LED-illuminated orbs, which active markers can be tracked by visible light cameras. The Oblong Mezzanine spatial operating system 13 uses handheld wands and ultrasonic emitters to recognize and interpret gestures, like those portrayed by the movie “Minority Report.” Twhirleds is distinguished from these by virtue of its intrinsic sensing, onboard tracking of spinning (padiddle) and whirling (poi). In that sense, it can be compared to the Zoom ARQ Aero RhythmTrak, 14 which features an embedded accelerometer for controlling music effects.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Arm pose of {{individual}} person often indicates his/her behavior and interaction in a crowd. This paper focuses {{on how to}} model arm pose with respect to walking styles in visual surveillance. We propose to use a Bayesian network to represent {{the relationship between the}} upper arm, forearm and hand. Two sets of probabilistic templates are used to estimate the likelihoods of these three arm parts against their boundary, foreground and skin color features. The prior distributions, a critical part of the Bayesian formulation, are estimated using a kernel density estimator based on the CMU motion dataset, whereby MAP is applied to estimate the part’s orientation and size before fitting them to the arms. The proposed method is found to perform effectively on the CAVIAR sub-dataset and a HKU dataset, and compare well against another popular method. Potentially, it can be extended to <b>track</b> <b>arm</b> movements or to analyze the objects carried by individuals...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{efficient}} technique for tracking three-dimensional palm motion, which is captured by two cameras. If we perform template matching independently for each image, two points in two images {{do not always}} correspond to each other. Thus we propose to set the search area in the three-dimensional space, not in image planes, {{so that we can}} find the correct correspondences. The three-dimensional coordinates of the search area are projected on each image plane. We perform template matching at the projected point in each image. We add those two similarities {{and use it as a}} similarity at the three-dimensional coordinates. We search for the position that has the maximum similarity in the search area. When hands are crossing, we cannot track an occluded palm because the palm region is occluded by an occluding palm. Still at that situation we can <b>track</b> <b>arm</b> regions. We use the arm tracking result to solve the occlusion of hands. ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{relationship}} between nutritional state and wound healing was examined in 66 adult surgical patients. Wound-healing response {{was assessed by}} measuring the colla-gen content (hydroxyproline) of fine tubes of Gore-tex inserted subcutaneously along standardized needle <b>track</b> <b>arm</b> wounds. After a period of 7 days, the tubes were removed and {{it was found that}} there was a higher hydroxyproline content in the tubing of 36 normally nourished patients than there was in the tubing of 21 patients with mild protein energy malnutrition (p < 0. 01) and 9 patients with moderate to severe protein energy malnutrition (p < 0. 01). There was no difference in the wound-healing response between the two latter groups of patients who had significantly different degrees of malnutrition. The results suggest that a definite abnormality in the wound-healing re-sponse exists in malnourished surgical patients, but it occurs earlier {{in the course of the}} illness than previously supposed. (Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition 10 : 550 - 554, 1986) Many surgeons have observed that very malnourished patients heal poorly. However, despite this, there are few, if any, objective human studies that describe the rela-tionship between nutritional state and the wound-heal-ing response. Any understanding that at present exists does so through animal studies, 1 - 5 where it has been demonstrated that animals with gross protein depletion have a delay in the wound-healing response. It is not clear, however, whether this abnormality starts only when gross protein depletion has occurred, or whether it occurs earlier when mild malnutrition is present. We have used the new method of Goodson and Hunt’ to carry out a study of the wound-healing response in normally nourished patients and to compare it with that of patients suffering from protein energy malnutrition (PEM) of varying severity...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a tracked robot with two articulated <b>tracked</b> <b>arms</b> for explosive or toxic gases detecting under coal mine. The ground under coal mine is seriously uneven. There are rails, crossties, ditches and some electrical apparatuses arranged {{in the coal}} mine tunnels. And sometimes the tunnels are with large slopes. The two articulated <b>tracked</b> <b>arms</b> can help the robot to surmount more obstacles and improve the adaptivity to uneven ground under coal mine. Since the coal mine is the highest degree explosive gases atmosphere, the coal mine detection robot itself {{can not be the}} source of explosion and must meet the mine-permissible requirements. Explosion-proof is essentially. In order to decrease the weight of the coal mine detection robot as possible, pressurized enclosure explosion-proof type is adopted for it.

40|$|Based on the {{characteristics}} of wheeled, tracked and legged movements, a variable parallelogram tracked mobile robot(VPTMR) is proposed and developed to enhance its adaptability and stability in the complex environment. This VPTMR robot consists of two variable parallelogram structures, which are composed of one main <b>tracked</b> <b>arm,</b> two lower <b>tracked</b> <b>arms</b> and a chasis. The variable parallelogram structure is actuated by a DC motor. And another DC motor actuates the track rotation, which enables VPTMR robot to move in wheeled, tracked and legged mode that makes the robot to adapt to all rugged environments.

At the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory, protons and gold nuclei {{have been brought to}} collide at nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energies up to √ sNN = 200 GeV.
