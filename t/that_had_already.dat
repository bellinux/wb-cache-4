5|$|Among {{the many}} {{technical}} {{challenges of the}} ion-deposition apparatus was obtaining a sufficiently high ion current (mass deposition rate) while simultaneously decelerating the ions so they could all deposit onto a target electrode embedded in a balance pan. Experiments with gold showed the ions had to be decelerated to very low energies to avoid sputtering effects—a phenomenon whereby ions <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>already</b> been counted ricochet off the target electrode or even dislodged atoms <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>already</b> been deposited. The deposited mass fraction in the 2003 German experiments only approached very close to 100% at ion energies of less than around 1eV (<1km/s for gold).|$|E

5|$|On February 14, 2008 a typo {{in court}} papers filed by Federal {{prosecutors}} erroneously alleged that Bonds tested positive for steroids in November 2001, a month after hitting his record 73rd home run. The reference was meant instead {{to refer to a}} November 2000 test <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>already</b> been disclosed and previously reported. The typo sparked a brief media frenzy.|$|E

5|$|Although {{named the}} Jersey Act by a {{critical}} foreign press, after Lord Jersey, the new regulation {{did not have}} the force of law as it was promulgated by the registration authorities of the Thoroughbred horse, not by the United Kingdom government. Nor was it promulgated by the Jockey Club, which had no authority over registration, only over racing matters. The regulation required that any horse registered in the General Stud Book trace in every line to a horse <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>already</b> been registered in the General Stud Book, effectively excluding most American-bred Thoroughbreds.|$|E
5|$|As the {{persecution}} worsened, thousands of Quakers left North Carolina for the Old Northwest, where slavery was prohibited and land was less expensive. (A large Quaker community <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>already</b> settled in what became Ohio and Indiana had been influential in securing a territorial ban on slavery.) In 1822 Coffin accompanied Benjamin White to Indiana {{and stayed in}} Indiana with the Whites for about a year. On his return to North Carolina, Coffin brought back reports of Indiana and its prosperity. Convinced that Quakers and slaveholders could not co exist, Coffin {{decided to move to}} Indiana.|$|E

5|$|Bergonzoli {{knew that}} if Bardia and Tobruk held out, a British advance further into Libya {{eventually}} must falter under the logistical difficulties of maintaining a desert force using an extended overland supply line. Not knowing how long he had to hold out, Bergonzoli was forced to ration his stocks {{of food and water}} so that O'Connor could not simply starve him out. Consequently, hunger and thirst adversely affected the morale of the Italian defenders <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>already</b> been shaken by the defeat at Sidi Barrani. So too did medical conditions undermine morale, particularly lice and dysentery, the results of poor sanitation.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1906, most {{leaders from}} Azusa Street had spun off to form other congregations, such as the 51st Street Apostolic Faith Mission, the Spanish AFM, and the Italian Pentecostal Mission. These {{missions}} were largely composed of immigrant or ethnic groups. The Southeast United States was a particularly prolific area of growth for the movement, since Seymour's approach gave a useful explanation for a charismatic spiritual climate <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>already</b> been taking root in those areas. Other new missions were based on preachers who had charisma and energy. Nearly all of these new churches were founded among immigrants and the poor.|$|E
5|$|He {{was also}} {{concerned}} by {{reports of the}} invasion of Kiska in the Aleutian Islands in August 1943, in which a large Allied force invaded an island <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>already</b> been evacuated by the Japanese. If this could happen, it was also possible that a force might attack where the Japanese were unexpectedly strong. Different levels of command sometimes came up with widely varying estimates of Japanese strength because they used different methods to estimate it.|$|E

By 1982 he had published four more collections: Przejście przez lustro (Through the Mirror, 1975); Iluzyt (1976); Feniks (The Phoenix, 1981); and Ogon diabła (The Devil's Tail, 1982).|$|E
5|$|If {{a player}} who has never played in an IIHF {{competition}} changes their citizenship, they must participate in national competitions in their new country {{for at least two}} consecutive years and have an international transfer card (ITC). If {{a player who}} has previously played in an IIHF tournament wishes to change their national team, they must have played in their new country for four years. A player can only do this once. The original IOC rules stated that an athlete <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>already</b> played for one nation could not later change nations under any circumstances.|$|E
5|$|In July 1940, Britain {{offered the}} United States {{access to its}} {{scientific}} research, and Cockcroft briefed American scientists on British nuclear weapons developments. He discovered that the American S-1 Project (later renamed the Manhattan Project) was smaller than the British, and not as far advanced. The two projects exchanged information, but did not initially combine their efforts, ostensibly over concerns about American security. Ironically, it was the British project <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>already</b> been penetrated by atomic spies for the Soviet Union.|$|E

He would, however, continue to seek to win delegates for the national party convention in the states <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>already</b> voted.|$|E
5|$|The British and Americans {{exchanged}} nuclear information, but did {{not initially}} combine their efforts. British officials did not reply to an August 1941 offer by Bush and Conant to create a combined British and American project. In November 1941, Frederick L. Hovde, {{the head of the}} London liaison office of OSRD, raised the issue of cooperation and exchange of information with Anderson and Lord Cherwell, who demurred, ostensibly over concerns about American security.

5|$|The {{king was}} {{reluctant}} to shed blood, and this greatly irritated the ultra-reactionary Chamber of Deputies, who felt that Louis XVIII was not executing enough. The government issued a proclamation of amnesty to the “traitors” in January 1816, but the trials <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>already</b> begun were finished in due course. That same declaration also banned {{any member of the}} House of Bonaparte from owning property in, or entering, France. It is estimated that between 50,000– 80,000 officials were purged from the government during what was known as the Second White Terror.|$|E
5|$|The same update {{released}} {{alongside the}} Fury expansion pack introduced in-game advertisements, {{found in the}} loading screens before a race. This move was met with criticism from gaming news outlets, particularly as the advertisements almost doubled the loading time between levels, and while the game content loads at the same speed, the advert must finish playing before the race can begin. The adverts were removed soon after numerous complaints were made by players. In addition to the load time problems, there had been consternation about advertising being retroactively added into a game <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>already</b> been paid for.|$|E
5|$|The war-time {{deployment}} of the Territorial Army envisioned it being deployed piecemeal, to reinforce the regular army <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>already</b> been deployed to the European mainland, as equipment became available.

As a result, the division did not leave the United Kingdom as the British Expeditionary Force was evacuated from France during May and June 1940.|$|E
