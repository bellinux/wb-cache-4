5|$|Individual {{nations are}} {{beginning}} to note the effect of fishing on seamounts, and the European Commission has agreed to fund the OASIS project, a detailed study {{of the effects of}} fishing on seamount communities in the North Atlantic. Another project working towards conservation is CenSeam, a Census of Marine Life project formed in 2005. CenSeam is intended to provide the framework needed to prioritise, integrate, expand and facilitate seamount research efforts in order to significantly reduce the unknown and build towards a global understanding of seamount ecosystems, and the roles <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> the biogeography, biodiversity, productivity and evolution of marine organisms.|$|E
5|$|Rodents {{are able}} to {{recognize}} close relatives by smell and this allows them to show nepotism (preferential behavior toward their kin) and also avoid inbreeding. This kin recognition is by olfactory cues from urine, feces and glandular secretions. The main assessment may involve the MHC, where the degree of relatedness of two individuals is correlated to the MHC genes <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> common. In non-kin communication, where more permanent odor markers are required, as at territorial borders, then non-volatile major urinary proteins (MUPs), which function as pheromone transporters, may also be used. MUPs may also signal individual identity, with each male house mouse (Mus musculus) excreting urine containing about a dozen genetically encoded MUPs.|$|E
5|$|Steam's {{primary service}} {{is to allow}} its users to {{download}} games and other software that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> their virtual software libraries to their local computers as game cache files (GCFs). Initially, Valve was required to be the publisher for these titles since they had sole access to the Steam's database and engine, but {{with the introduction of}} the Steamworks software development kit (SDK) in May 2008, anyone could potentially become a publisher to Steam, outside of Valve's involvement to curate titles on the service.|$|E

5|$|The Sauvignon blanc vine often buds late but ripens early, {{which allows}} it to perform well in sunny climates when not exposed to {{overwhelming}} heat. In warm regions such as South Africa, Australia and California, the grape flourishes in cooler climate appellations such as the Alexander Valley area. In areas where the vine is subjected to high heat, the grape will quickly become over-ripe and produce wines with dull flavors and flat acidity. Rising global temperatures have caused farmers to harvest the grapes earlier than <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> the past.|$|E

25|$|The Rhagophthalmidae are a glow-worm-like {{lineage of}} Elateroidea. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> {{the recent past}} usually been {{considered}} a distinct family, but whether this is correct is still disputed.

25|$|The longer {{people are}} missing teeth, wear {{dentures}} or partials, the less bone <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> their jaws.

Films are a contemporary form of mythmaking, reflecting our response to ourselves and the mysteries and wonders of our existence.|$|E

25|$|However, the {{situation}} in Iraqi Kurdistan (the three northern governorates with primarily Kurdish populations) is quite different. Due to their better stability, the Kurdish semi-autonomous area enjoys health care superior to that under Saddam. Health workers have not left the provinces for Syria or Jordan, as <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> sectarian Iraq, and new programs for continuing professional education in major Iraqi Kurdish cities reflect the optimism of the area.|$|E
25|$|Nineteenth century New Testament {{scholars}} who rejected the traditional {{perspective of the}} priority of Matthew in favor of Marcan priority speculated that the authors of Matthew and Luke drew the material <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> common with the Gospel of Mark from that Gospel. Matthew and Luke, however, also share large sections of text which are not found in Mark. They suggested that neither Gospel drew upon the other, but upon a second common source, termed the Q.|$|E
25|$|The {{body parts}} {{appear to be}} classed for {{compensation}} based on how much use <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> society. The higher the use; the higher the compensation cost. Loss of hearing, for example, as well as loss of testes and/or penis incur very high redress rates, because their loss will cause either danger or an inability to continue lineage, which was highly important in such a kin-based society. The tongue is also particularly high because, as with the ear, it would have formed the primary means of communication for the victim.|$|E

25|$|The {{essence of}} the D/L method is 'resources'. Each team is taken to have two 'resources' to use to make as many runs as possible: the number of overs they have to receive; {{and the number of}} wickets <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> hand. At any point in any innings, a team's ability to score more runs depends on the {{combination}} of these two resources. Looking at historical scores, there is a very close correspondence between the availability of these resources and a team's final score, a correspondence which D/L exploits.|$|E
25|$|The railway {{can call}} {{on a large}} fleet to operate its services. Only a core of {{vehicles}} actually belong to the railway company, the remainder being owned by associated groups, such as the Great Western (Severn Valley Railway) Association, and individuals. The SVR is also {{the base of the}} DMU (diesel multiple unit) West Midland Group. Locomotives and stock from the railway do not now often operate excursions on the National Rail network, but <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> the past been seen from Mallaig to Plymouth.|$|E

60|$|This was {{scarcely}} surprising. The Baggara, the tyrants of the desert, are horsemen. The infantry were, {{for the most}} part, drawn from the conquered tribes. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> enlisted <b>in</b> the Khalifa's force partly because <b>they</b> <b>had</b> no other means of subsistence, partly from their innate love of fighting. <b>They</b> <b>had,</b> <b>in</b> fact, been little better than slaves; and their condition, as soldiers in the Egyptian Army, was immeasurably superior to that which <b>they</b> <b>had</b> before occupied.|$|R
25|$|Stephen Harper and Jack Layton are {{reported}} to have {{said that if the}} Green Party were included, they would not participate in the Leaders' Debates. Dion said that while he supports May's inclusion, he would not attend if Harper does not, and the Bloc QuÃ©bÃ©cois has stated it will not boycott the debates if May is included. The media consortium in charge of the debate, made up of the CBC, CTV, Global Television and TVA, had decided that it would prefer to broadcast the debates with the four major party leaders, rather than risk not at all or with minimal participation. The Green Party indicated they had begun procedures to lodge a formal complaint with the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission, as <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> past federal elections.|$|E
25|$|If {{you wish}} you may tell the police {{to be careful not}} to rile me. Of course, I am a {{reasonable}} spirit. I take no offense at the way they have conducted their investigations in the past. In fact, they have been so utterly stupid as to not only amuse me, but His Satanic Majesty, Francis Josef, etc. But tell them to beware. Let them not try to discover what I am, for it were better that they were never born than to incur the wrath of the Axeman. I don't think there is any need of such a warning, for I feel sure the police will always dodge me, as <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> the past. They are wise and know how to keep away from all harm.|$|E
25|$|France overtook Ireland as the European Union {{member state}} with the highest birth-rate in 2007. Projected birth rates {{indicate}} that France will have the largest population in the EU by 2050, with 75million citizens, overtaking Germany, but only the second largest in Europe, with the UK having a larger estimated population. In 2011, France was the only European Union member with a fertility rate at replacement level, with an average rate of 2.08 children per woman while Ireland's fertility rate declined to 2.01 children per woman, slightly below replacement level. This reason {{for an increase in}} children are due to the government family benefits that are provided to these families. They receive an allowance based off income and how many children <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> that household.|$|E
