40|$|Populations of Houbara Bustards have {{dramatically}} declined in recent years. Captive breeding and reintroduction programs have had limited success in reviving population numbers and thus new technological solutions involving molecular methods {{are essential for}} the long term survival of this species. In this study, we sequenced the 694 bp segment of COI gene of the four specimens of Asian Houbara Bustard (Chlamydotis undulata macqueenii). We also compared these sequences with earlier published barcodes of 11 individuals comprising different families of the orders Gruiformes, Ciconiiformes, Podicipediformes and Crocodylia (out group). The pair-wise sequence comparison showed a total of 254 variable sites across all the 15 sequences from different taxa. Three of the four specimens of Houbara Bustard had an identical sequence of COI gene and one individual showed a single nucleotide difference (G > A transition at position 83). Within the bustard family (Otididae), comparison among the three species (Asian Houbara Bustard, Great Bustard (Otis tarda) and the Little Bustard (<b>Tetrax</b> <b>tetrax)),</b> representing three different genera, showed 116 variable sites. For another family (Rallidae), the intra-family variable sites among the individuals of four different genera were found to be 146. The COI genetic distances among the 15 individuals varied from 0. 000 to 0. 431. Phylogenetic analysis using 619 bp nucleotide segment of COI clearly discriminated all the species representing different genera, families and orders. All the four specimens of Houbara Bustard formed a single clade and are clearly separated from other two individuals of the same family (Otis tarda and <b>Tetrax</b> <b>tetrax).</b> The nucleotide sequence of partial segment of COI gene effectively discriminated the closely related species. This is the first study reporting the barcodes of Houbara Bustard and would be helpful in future molecular studies, particularly for the conservation of this threatened bird in Saudi Arabia...|$|R

This area, being dominated by cereal steppe landscapes, holds significant numbers of several threatened bird species. The study focuses on the selection of habitat by the Great Bustard (Otis tarda), the Little Bustard (<b>Tetrax</b> <b>tetrax)</b> and the Calandra Lark (Melanocorypha calandra) at various scales(namely regional, landscape and patch scale). This is done by making use of modern statistical approaches (GLM’s and GAM’s) embedded within a Geographical Information System (GIS) environment, combining field data with satellite imagery and map data. Expected results include potential (habitat-based) distribution models of these species in the study area, and a series of scale-dependent management recommendations for the conservation of the species and their habitats.

50|$|There {{have been}} several {{hypotheses}} proposed as to why males cluster into leks. The hotshot hypothesis is the only model that attributes males as {{the driving force behind}} aggregation. The hotshot model hypothesizes that attractive males, known as hotshots, garner both female and male attention. Females go to the hotshots because they are attracted to these males. Other males form leks around these hotshots as a way to lure females away from the hotshot. A manipulative experiment using the little bustard, <b>Tetrax</b> <b>tetrax,</b> was done to test the various lek evolution models. The experiment involved varying the size and sex ratio of leks using decoys. To test whether or not the presence of a hotshot determined lek formation, a hotshot little bustard decoy was placed within a lek. After the fake hotshot was added to the lek, both male and female visitation to the lek increased.|$|R
40|$|Evaluating the {{effectiveness}} of conservation funding is crucial for correct allocation of limited resources. Here we used bird monitoring data to assess the effects of long-term conservation investment in a Natura 2000 (N 2000) bird protection area (PA), which during two decades benefited from protection regulations, conservation projects, and agri-environment schemes. Variation between 1995 – 1997 and 2010 – 2012 in richness and abundance of flagship (Otis tarda, <b>Tetrax</b> <b>tetrax,</b> and Falco naumanni) and specialized fallow field species were more favorable (i. e., increased more or declined less) inside the PA than in a nearby control area. However, the reverse was found for total bird species, farmland, ground-nesting and steppe species, species associated to ploughed fields, and species of European conservation concern. Enhancing {{the effectiveness}} of conservation investment in N 2000 farmland may require a greater focus on the wider biodiversity alongside that currently devoted to flagship species, as well as improved matching between conservation and agricultural policies. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
40|$|The {{little bustard}} <b>Tetrax</b> <b>tetrax</b> is a bird of agro-pastoral landscapes rapidly disappearing {{from most of}} Western Europe due to {{agricultural}} intensification. In Italy, the species is virtually extinct from the mainland but still occurs in Sardinia, where four Special Protection Areas (SPAs) have been designated in 2007 to protect the bustard and related habitat. In this note, we document a steep decline (between 50 and 87, 5 %) of the species {{during the last decade}} in one of those four SPAs, Plains of Semestene, Bonorva, Macomer and Bortigali. However, during summer 2009, a group of 17 individuals was found within the SPA, confirming that the species, although at low numbers (5 - 15 displaying males), still breeds successfully in the area. Potential limiting factors are also discussed.

40|$|International audience: In {{their choice}} of mates, females may use {{alternative}} tactics, including a comparative assessment of males in a population, using one or several relative preference criteria. Traits involved in female choice should presumably be variable between, but not within males, thus potentially providing reliable cues of male identity and quality for prospecting females. In lekking species, sexual selection is usually intense, and females can freely choose mates. Studying the Little Bustard <b>Tetrax</b> <b>tetrax,</b> a bird with an exploded lek mating system, we first identified male phenotypic traits that showed higher among, than within variation (plumage pattern, display rates and call structure). Among those and other traits (ornaments and their symmetry, body condition, lek spatial organization and territory quality), we identified phenotypic traits that correlated with male attractiveness toward females. At least four phenotypic male traits were correlated with female attraction, i. e. body condition, lek attendance, ornamental symmetry and display rates. Traits related to the initial female attraction on male territory seem to differ from traits related to the decision of females {{to stay in the}} territory of attractive males...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} designing policies for habitat conservation on agricultural land. The case under study requires a non-aggregated spatial distribution of the fields to be enrolled in an agri-environmental programme. A spatially explicit mathematical programming farm-based model, which accounts for three spatial levels (field, farm and landscape), is coupled with a relevant spatial pattern index (the Ripley L-function) to analyse the design and implementation of an agri-environmental programme aimed to preserve the <b>Tetrax</b> <b>tetrax</b> in the Plaine de Niort, France.

40|$|International audienceIn {{response}} to climate {{changes that have}} occurred during Pleistocene glacial cycles, taxa associated to steppe vegetation might have followed a pattern of historical evolution in which isolation and fragmentation of populations occurred during the short interglacials and expansion events occurred during the long glacial periods, in contrast to the pattern described for temperate species. Here, we use molecular genetic data to evaluate this idea in a steppe bird with Palaearctic distribution, the little bustard (<b>Tetrax</b> <b>tetrax).</b> Overall, extremely low genetic diversity and differentiation was observed among eight little bustard populations distributed in Spain and France. Mismatch distribution analyses showed that most little bustard populations expanded during cooling periods previous to, and just after, the last interglacial period (127, 000 - 111, 000 years before present), when steppe habitats were widespread across Europe. Coalescent-based methods suggested that glacial expansions have resulted in substantial admixture in Western Europe due to the existence of different interglacial refugia. Our results are consistent with a model of evolution and genetic consequences of Pleistocene cycles with low between-population genetic differentiation as a result of short-term isolation periods during interglacials and long-term exchange during glacial periods...|$|R

Through {{the analysis of}} landscape dynamics between 2002 – 2011, a gradient of agricultural intensification was identified in selected areas of Baixo Alentejo. In cereal fields, total bird abundance of steppe and resident birds decreased along the intensification gradient. During the breeding season, this trend should be related {{to an increase in}} height and density of vegetation structure in intensive areas. Food availability is not influenced by intensification. In extensive areas, the bird abundance is influenced by differences associated to the type of cereal and vegetation structure. In fallows, the abundance of steppe and resident birds is affected by intensification. Wintering and breeding species are influenced by fallow age and livestock presence. The multi-scale analysis of local management and landscape composition effects on steppe bird community in cereal fields showed that local component is more important in winter.

40|$|The Niort plain (Poitou-Charentes, France) {{presents}} several environmental challenges due to {{the presence}} of: (i) the protected bird species, Little Bustard (<b>Tetrax</b> <b>tetrax),</b> which needs different types of grassland for its optimal development (nesting and growth), and (ii) droughts which reduce the water available for maize irrigation.

In this context, socio-anthropological interviews were carried out with eleven farmers to ascertain their views about grazing for dairy cows, {{and whether or not they}} practise it. Results of interviews are presented in terms of farmers’ general ideas on grazing; its implications for product (butter) labelling; their conceptions in terms of labour requirements and herd management; and the security and simplicity of diets (erratic milk production associated with transition from maize silage to grazing in spring, and implications of effects on rumen flora).

40|$|International audienceHunting {{is one of}} {{the human}} {{activities}} that directly affect wildlife and has received increasing attention given its socioeconomic dimensions. Most studies have been conducted on coastal and wetland areas and showed that hunting activity can greatly affect bird behaviour and distribution. Hunting-free reserves for game species are zones where birds find an area of reduced disturbance. We evaluated the effect of hunting activities on the behaviour and use of hunting-free areas of lapwings Vanellus vanellus, golden plovers Pluvialis apricaria and little bustards <b>Tetrax</b> <b>tetrax</b> in agricultural areas. We compared the habitat use and behaviour of birds on days before, during and after hunting took place. All three studied species showed strong behavioural responses to hunting activities. Hunting activity increased flight probability and time spent vigilant (higher on hunting days than just before and after a hunting day), to the detriment of resting. We also found distributional (use of hunting-free reserve) responses to hunting activities, with hunting-free reserves being used more frequently during hunting days. Thus, reserves can mitigate the disturbance caused by hunting activities, benefiting threatened species in agricultural areas. Increasing the size or number of huntingfree areas might be an important management and conservation tool to reduce the impacts of hunting activities...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{analysed}} {{the display}} behaviour of male little bustard <b>Tetrax</b> <b>tetrax</b> to identify displays {{that are used}} in the context of male–male competition and those that are used for attracting females. Courtship was the main activity of males during the breeding season. Calling activity occurred throughout the day, and leks were attended for more than 4 months. Male sexual displays included snort call, wing-flash, and jump display. Snort call was performed throughout the day and mainly involved male–male interactions. In contrast, the wing-flash display was given only at twilight, and was performed most commonly when a female was present, supporting an inter-sexual function for this display. The jump display was performed only in the presence of female at anytime of the day. Analysis of individual variations in display behaviour revealed that intra-individual variation was low compared to inter-individual variation, especially for the jump display. It is, therefore, possible that display rates provide information on male quality. Four male settlement patterns could be defined, singles, paired, lekking and satellite lekking, but only wing-flash display and stamped snort call differed among those categories. We suggest that satellite males are attempting to benefit from proximity to higher status males, in accordance with the hotshot hypothesis of lek evolution...|$|R

To identify set-aside features {{important to the}} ecology of four ground nesting species, namely Little Bustard <b>Tetrax</b> <b>tetrax,</b> Stone-curlew Burhinus oedicnemus, Greater Short-toed Lark Calandrella brachydactyla and Calandra Lark Melanocorypha calandra. Methods. Set-aside fields were surveyed in four regions of Catalonia (northeast of Spain) for the selected species during the 2004 and 2005 breeding seasons. Set-aside habitat descriptors (e. g. size, vegetation structure) were collected. Ordination plots and information theoretic methods {{were used to assess}} the relationship between the selected bird species, set-aside features and the regions. Results. The region where the set-aside was located had a strong effect on the abundance of the selected species. In addition, vegetation coverage, field shape of set-aside and surrounding natural habitats were critical features, but with contrasting effects on the different species. Conclusion. Populations of the selected species of conservation concern could be improved by effective management of set-aside.

40|$|International audienceThe {{little bustard}} (<b>Tetrax</b> <b>tetrax)</b> has {{declined}} rapidly across European farmland landscapes due to agricultural intensification. In France, {{the number of}} breeding males in agricultural habitats has been reduced by 92 % over the last 20 years {{as a result of}} decreases in insect abundance and nest destruction during harvesting. An ageand sex-structured stochastic metapopulation model was formulated for the remaining little bustard population in south-west France and, using actual estimates of demographic rates obtained after 1997, its extinction risk over the next 30 years was estimated to be ca. 0. 48. Limited population reinforcement has thus appeared as a potential conservation strategy for this species in agricultural habitats, while agro-environmental actions have begun to have an effect on habitat quality at the landscape level. Different strategies for the reinforcement of fledglings, including the number and frequency of releases and the number of release localities in relation to four criteria for choosing the release points, were evaluated in terms of their effect in reducing the extinction risk of local populations and of the metapopulation. The reinforcement of 100 fledglings per year for 5 years and choosing the actual release points using the current abundance were found to be the optimal choices for reducing the estimated extinction risk of the remaining little bustard population in south-west France...|$|R

In Western Europe, France now holds the only remaining migratory population, which currently numbers fewer than 300 displaying males. However, the movements of these birds are virtually unknown, {{in spite of the}} important implications of this information for the conservation of this species. We identified migratory movements and overwintering areas of French migratory populations, using wild individuals fitted with satellite or radio-transmitters. Little Bustards completed their migration journey over a relatively short time period (2 – 5 days), with nocturnal migration flights of 400 – 600 km per night. All birds overwintered in Iberia. In addition, we tested the consequences of captive rearing on migratory movements. French wild adults and French captive-bred juveniles behaved similarly with regard to migration, suggesting that hand-raising does not alter migratory movements. However, birds originating from eggs collected in Spain and reared in western France did not migrate, suggesting a genetic component to migratory behaviour. These results therefore suggest that a conservation strategy involving the release in France of birds hatched from eggs collected in Spain may imperil the expression of migratory movements of the French population. More generally, to maintain the integrity of native populations, the introduced individuals should mimic their migratory movements and behaviour...|$|R

Understanding how animal populations respond to these landscape changes often requires using landscape mosaics as the unit of investigation, but few previous studies have measured both response and explanatory variables at the land mosaic level. Here, we used a "whole-landscape" approach to assess the influence of regional variation in the land cover composition of 81 farmland mosaics (mean area of 2900 ha) on the population density of a threatened bird, the little bustard (<b>Tetrax</b> <b>tetrax),</b> in southern Portugal. Results showed that ca. 50 % of the regional variability in the density of little bustards {{could be explained by}} three variables summarising the land cover composition and diversity in the studied mosaics. Little bustard breeding males attained higher population density in land mosaics with a low land cover diversity, with less forests, and dominated by grasslands. Land mosaic composition gradients showed that agricultural intensification was not reflected in a loss of land cover diversity, as in many other regions of Europe. On the contrary, it led to the introduction of new land cover types in homogenous farmland, which increased land cover diversity but reduced overall landscape suitability for the species.

His breast and lower neck sides are {{chestnut}} {{and there is a}} golden wash to the back and the extent of these bright colours tending to increase as the male ages. In the breeding season, the male has long white neck bristles, which measure up to 12 - 15 cm in length, continually growing from the third to the sixth year of life. In flight, the long wings are predominantly white with brown showing along the edges of the lower primary and secondary feathers and a dark brown streak along the upper-edge of the wing. The breast and neck of the female are buff, with brown and pale colouration over the rest of the plumage rendering it well camouflaged in open habitats. Immature birds resemble the female. The eastern subspecies (O. t. dybowskii) is more extensively grey in colour in both sexes, with more extensive barring on the back. The great bustard has long legs, a long neck and a heavy, barrel-chested body. It is fairly typical of the family in its overall shape and habitat preferences. Three other bustard species overlap in range with this species: the Macqueen's (Chlamydotis macqueenii), houbara (Chlamydotis undulata) and little bustards (<b>Tetrax</b> <b>tetrax).</b> However, none of these attains the plumage coloration nor approach the body sizes of this species.

40|$|Leks have {{recently}} been defined as male display aggregations that females attend primarily {{for the purpose of}} mating. This is an extended version of previous definitions, as a clear-cut definition of leks is difficult to obtain. Four criteria should be verified to identify a lekking species: (i) there is no male parental investment beyond the sperm; (ii) males aggregate at specific sites for display; (iii) the only resource females find on the lek is the male, i. e. the male genes; (iv) females can select her mate(s), although the necessity of this latter condition for lekking species has been highly debated. We applied these criteria to the endangered little bustard <b>Tetrax</b> <b>tetrax,</b> a species that is claimed to show an exploded lek mating system, but for which this has never been fully investigated. We monitored a population of little bustards in western France during 2 years to investigate the two central criteria in the assessment of their mating system: male aggregation in arenas and lack of consistent resources in male territories. We analysed the spatial distribution of little bustard male territories, the individual variation in size, and the land use characteristics of male territories, with particular attention to the habitats that may be considered as defensible resources.

Several bird species occur in these grazed habitats and are now experiencing a near continuous decline. We investigated the impact of livestock grazing on the threatened little bustard (<b>Tetrax</b> <b>tetrax</b> L.). The study was conducted at the NATURA 2000 Site/Important Bird Area of Cabrela, Portugal. Our main goals were to investigate responses of little bustard territorial males and breeding females to different livestock management practices, namely pasture types, stocking rates and sward structure. Bird distribution was surveyed using car and foot surveys. Data on grazing was supplied by land managers every 10 days from February to June through field interviews. Generalised additive models and model averaging were used to compute predictive models. Results indicate that higher probabilities of occurrence were found in long-term pastures and under light-moderate grazing conditions (stocking rates around 0. 4 LU/ha). Conversely, lower probabilities of occurrence were found in ungrazed or heavy grazed fields. Males occurred mostly in large fields, but this variable seemed to be less important for females. On the other hand, green plant cover and the vegetation height were good predictors for the occurrence of females but not for males. Females used mostly pastures with vegetation height around 20 – 25 cm. Our results suggest that grazing management plans that aim to conserve little bustard populations should consider (1) {{the maintenance of the}} larger long-term pastures and (2) the use of light-moderate stocking rates (0. 2 – 0. 6 LU/ha) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{little bustard}} <b>Tetrax</b> <b>tetrax</b> has {{undergone}} severe range contraction within Europe due to abandonment of traditional agro-pastoral activities. Previous studies of habitat selection have mainly focused on extensive cereal and cropland mosaics, while the species’ ecology in pastoral landscapes is understood less well, and data are completely lacking from the Sardinian population. We conducted distance sampling surveys of displaying males across three contrasting landscapes in Sardinia and modelled habitat preference {{at both the}} landscape and local (within pastures and recent fallows) scale. Abbasanta, with a balance of pasture and cropland, the greatest isolation from roads and shortest vegetation, supported the highest little bustard densities (95 %CI 2. 7 – 3. 4 males/ 100 ha). Significantly lower densities were found in two landscapes with lower isolation from roads and taller vegetation within grasslands: Campeda (0. 1 – 0. 2 males/ 100 ha), comprising cropland and pasture in similar proportions to those found at Abbasanta, and Campidano (0. 3 – 0. 4 males/ 100 ha) that was dominated by cereal agriculture. At the landscape level, males preferred pastures and recent fallows over arable lands. At the local scale, within grasslands, probability of occurrence was greater with shorter vegetation, more legume and green herb cover and at points remote from roads. Shorter vegetation in grasslands resulted from high grazing pressure, and habitat suitability for breeding males depends strongly on extensively grazed grasslands. Conservation efforts for this species should focus on maintaining traditional agro-pastoral practices which maintain large areas of extensively grazed pastures and recent fallows located far from roads...|$|R
40|$|Hunting and its {{associated}} management have significant costs and benefits for biodiversity conservation,which makes this socio-economic activity highly controversial at both international and regional levels. We investigated relationships between management for small game species (mainly Red-legged Partridges Alectoris rufa and rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus) and both abundance and richness of farmland and scrubland songbirds, raptors and ground-nesting birds, and on the abundance of three species of conservation concern (Little Bustard <b>Tetrax</b> <b>tetrax,</b> Eurasian Thick-knee Burhinus oedicnemus and Montagu’s Harrier Circus pygargus) in southern Portugal farmland. We compared 12 game estates and 12 matching areas with similar sizes and land uses but no game management. Richness and abundance were estimated from fixed point counts, and were related to game regime (managed or unmanaged), habitat characteristics and census period. Our results showed that game management was associated, albeit weakly, with higher abundance of raptors and ground-nesting birds, but no relationship (either positive or negative) was found for other guilds and species. Habitat was generally {{the most important factor}} explaining bird species richness and abundance. Our results suggest possibilities for promoting management systems that could maximize both hunting sustainability and conservation value of managed areas, particularly when management helps to improve or maintain beneficial habitats or practices for farmland birds. This study was funded by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) (PRAXIS/C/AGR/ 11062 / 1998) and by the European Commission under the 7 th Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development through the project HUNT(212160, FP 7 - ENV- 2007 - 1), and contributes to the project CGL 2009 - 13029 from the Spanish Ministry of Science.

40|$|Positive {{interactions}} between species can have important conservation implications, {{especially when the}} species associating are both vulnerable. We studied the habitat use of pin-tailed sandgrouses Pterocles alchata and their association with another vulnerable species, the little bustard <b>Tetrax</b> <b>tetrax</b> in agrarian pseudo-steppes of central Spain using radio-tracking. The occurrence of mixed-species flocks varied seasonally, being more frequent in winter (65 % of pin-tailed sandgrouse flocks). In this season, pin-tailed sandgrouses preferred stubble fields and fallows. Moreover, we found that habitat selection of pin-tailed sandgrouse depended on the association with little bustards in mixed-species flocks. When in mixed-species groups, sandgrouses changed their agrarian substrate preferences, and used stubble fields significantly more often than when in sandgrouse-only flocks. We also provide evidence that pin-tailed sandgrouse benefited from the anti-predator vigilance of little bustards, allowing sandgrouse to exploit new feeding grounds (stubble fields) {{that would otherwise be}} too risky to exploit. Our results indicate a close positive association between these two species, which are both declining in Europe, and we discuss implications for their management and conservation. We also recommend taking into account inter-specific positive interactions when designing conservation strategies for threatened species. The study was ﬁnanced by the Dirección General de Investigación (projects CGL 2007 - 66322 /BOS and CGL 2008 - 04282 /BOS), and the Consejeríade Educación y Ciencia of Castilla-La Mancha (projectsPAI 08 - 0171 - 9582 and PAC 06 - 137).

40|$|Foraging {{strategies}} and diet selection play {{an essential role}} in individual survival and reproductive success. The study of feeding ecology becomes crucial when it concerns endangered species such as the Little Bustard (<b>Tetrax</b> <b>tetrax),</b> whose populations are suffering strong declines as a consequence of agricultural intensification. Despite the fact that several populations are overwintering in areas affected by agricultural transformation, nothing is known about how feeding behavior responds to these changes. We studied {{for the first time the}} winter diet composition of the Little Bustard in Spain and compared it between areas with two different farming systems: dry and irrigated farmland. Diet was studied through the micro-histological analysis of 357 droppings collected in 16 locations across the wintering range of the Little Bustard in Spain. Up to 62 plant species were identified. Most consumed species were cultivated legumes (46. 7 %) and dicotyledon weeds (45. 6 %), while monocotyledons were scarcely consumed (7. 7 %). Diet composition differed significantly between dry and irrigated farmland areas. In irrigated areas, diet was mainly composed of legumes, in particular alfalfa (Medicago sativa). In contrast, in dry farmland areas diet was more diverse, composed mainly of weeds (Compositae, Papaveraceae, and Cruciferae) and also cultivated legumes, particularly vetch (Vicia sativa). These results suggest that legume crops could be an effective measure to improve habitat quality in areas with scarce food resources. However, in the case of irrigated areas, the strong reliance on alfalfa could make the Little Bustard more vulnerable to changes in land use. This study is the first step to understand the winter trophic requirements of the endangered Little Bustard, but further research is necessary to understand the food requirements of this species during the entire annual cycle...|$|R
40|$|Niche theory {{predicts that}} coexisting species will {{partition}} resources {{to limit the}} effects of interspecific competition. We examined microhabitat partitioning in six sets of steppe birds associated to agroecosystems in central Spain (female and male Great Bustards Otis tarda, female and male Little Bustards <b>Tetrax</b> <b>tetrax,</b> Red-legged Partridges Alectoris rufa and Eurasian Stone-curlews Burhinus oedicnemus) to estimate realized niche breadth, overlap and segregation. Principal Components Analysis on data from used and random microhabitat locations produced two axes we retained for analysis related with two key factors: cover-visibility and food availability. Non-parametric kernel density functions were calculated {{for each of the}} PCA axes and species (or sexes), and niche overlap estimated as the area shared between species’ density functions. Null models were run to evaluate overlap significance. In analyses of microhabitat selection by the six sets of birds, 13 out of 15 pairs had significant resource partitioning and niche segregation, except for the pairs partridge and female Great Bustard and the two sexes of Great Bustard. Eurasian Stone-curlew showed wider trophic niche breadth, although segregated from the other species, probably because of its higher invertebrate requirements. Great and Little Bustards segregated in both niche axes, selecting microhabitat according to their body size. Accessibility to food resources and shelter seems to be similar for partridges and female Great Bustards, overlapping in their selection, which may indicate the existence of segregation in other niche factors (e. g., feeding habits). Great Bustard males showed niche overlap with females. Little Bustard males showed feeding microhabitat selection patterns similar to those of females, although they preferred more open microhabitats to meet their sexual display requirements. The entire assemblage had significantly less overlap than expected by chance, suggesting that differential microhabitat selection and realized niche partitioning may explain coexistence in steppe bird communities. Our results suggest that the maintenance of different microhabitat structure should be a priority in the management of agricultural environments...|$|R
