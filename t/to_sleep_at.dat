Churchill's office-bedroom included BBC broadcasting equipment; Churchill made four wartime broadcasts from the Cabinet War Rooms. Although the office room was also fitted {{out as a}} bedroom, Churchill rarely slept underground, preferring <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> <b>at</b> 10 Downing Street or the No.10 Annexe, a flat in the New Public Offices directly above the Cabinet War Rooms. His daughter Mary Soames often slept in the bedroom allocated to Mrs Churchill.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before she}} turned 15, Falle met two child prostitutes {{who were also}} in their early teens. One of these girls was {{pregnant}} by her 42-year-old pimp. The two girls offered Falle a place <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> <b>at</b> their apartment while their pimp was away; feeling there was no alternative, she accepted. Out of concern for Falle's safety, they {{taught her how to}} put a condom on a penis by practicing on a cucumber. These children effectively groomed Falle. She stayed at the apartment for several days, and she was watched by various men. By the time the pimp returned, Falle had moved on.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the highly}} {{productive}} lead-up, Davidson faltered {{in his first}} outing as Australia's Test spearhead. He conceded 1/115 in only 32 overs in the first innings as South Africa reached 9/470 in the First Test in Johannesburg. With Australia 102 behind on the first innings, Davidson's tour nearly ended. Unable {{to cope with the}} 10 pm curfew imposed by team manager Jack Norton, Davidson and roommate Les Favell absconded and went sightseeing. By the time they had returned, Norton had confiscated their keys and left them a note asking them to report. The pair then went <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> <b>at</b> the home of some supporters who had hosted the team for dinner the previous day.|$|E

Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) and Gabe invite the office over to Gabe's {{house for a}} Glee viewing party. When the show starts, Michael and Gabe get into an argument over how high the volume should be. After taking turns raising and lowering the volume, Michael retreats to Gabe's bedroom, hoping that his employees will follow him there. Meanwhile, Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) has been {{having a hard time}} with getting her daughter CeCe to go <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> <b>at</b> night, so Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) picks her up to try to calm her down. Pam is stunned that CeCe becomes completely quiet in Dwight's hands.|$|E
5|$|The WSGA {{group was}} taken to Cheyenne {{to be held at}} the barracks of Fort D.A. Russell as the Laramie County jail was unable to hold that many prisoners. They {{received}} preferential treatment and were allowed to roam the base by day as long as they agreed to return to the jail <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> <b>at</b> night. Johnson County officials were upset that the group was not kept locally at Ft. McKinney. The general in charge of the 6th Cavalry felt that tensions were too high for the prisoners to remain in the area. Hundreds of armed locals sympathetic to both sides of the conflict were said to have gone to Ft. McKinney {{over the next few days}} under the mistaken impression the invaders were being held there.|$|E
5|$|On the way home, Peter and Brian argue until Brian {{gets out}} of the car. A police officer gives Brian a ticket, for which Peter has to pay $10, for violating the local leash law, which only widens the rift between Peter and Brian. Another {{argument}} ensues and Peter mentions that he found Brian on the road as a stray dog. Angry that Peter brought that up and becoming more angry when Peter then demands that Brian stop being a bad dog, Brian leaves the house, whereupon he is treated cruelly by the community, and is (ultimately) forced <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> <b>at</b> the bus shelter. Peter buys a new cat which turns out to be mischievous and abusive; the family gets rid of it and searches for Brian. By the time Peter decides to apologize to Brian, Brian has been kicked out of a restaurant and a public store and chased by the police when he was found drinking from a water fountain. Brian becomes homeless, having actually attacked a man on the street for treating him as a drunken hobo and for not believing that he was not a good dog but a crazy animal. He is subsequently taken away by the police.|$|E

5|$|Vainio's friends Heikki Kauppinen and Reijo Tani quit {{drinking}} in 1972, {{and at first}} Vainio found their decision odd. When Vexi Salmi was hired by Fazer in 1970, Vainio and Salmi started drinking together often and sometimes even came to work with hangovers. On one occasion, Vainio forgot that {{he was supposed to}} have finished the text of an advertising tune. When the deadline arrived, Vainio was too hung over to finish the lyrics and eventually Salmi agreed to help by writing the lyrics for Vainio's composition. Vainio's alcohol use increased in the 1970s, and his parents watched without being able to do anything about it. It is reported that Vainio would not go <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> <b>at</b> night unless he had liquor under his bed, and he always kept a bottle with him. Vainio began to realize that he could not live like this forever. By summer 1975 he decided that he needed to stop drinking altogether. He was especially helped in this decision through his meeting footballer Kai Pahlman, who told Vainio that he was surprised he was still alive. In late 1975, Vainio stayed sober for four months, but then caved in for a short time. In January 1976 he finally managed to {{quit drinking}} for good.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile Thornton had strolled the North Barracks between 21:00 on the 24th and 02:00 on Christmas Day {{observing the}} ongoing partying, before going <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> <b>at</b> 02:00.

The girls sang special songs intended to summon the powers that the vÇ«lva wished to communicate with. The session was a success because the vÇ«lva was permitted to see far into the future and the famine was averted.|$|E

25|$|In P. arnaudi, nests are {{not only}} used for {{breeding}} {{and to protect the}} chicks, but also for fully grown birds <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> <b>at</b> night. The species builds roofed nest in thorny Acacia trees and forms colonies. One of the two entrances is closed however just before eggs are laid and opened again around the moment of fledging. Male and female share incubation duties. Adult and adolescent birds from previous broods often help in nest building and feeding the chicks. The nestlings are initially fed on a diet consisting exclusively of insects, and grass seeds are only given during the last days. Fledging occurs after about twenty days.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} {{those who have}} DSPD seek medical help, they usually have tried many times to change their {{sleeping}} schedule. Failed tactics <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> <b>at</b> earlier times may include maintaining proper sleep hygiene, relaxation techniques, early bedtimes, hypnosis, alcohol, sleeping pills, dull reading, and home remedies. DSPD patients who have tried using sedatives at night often report that the medication makes them feel tired or relaxed, but that it fails to induce sleep. They often have asked family members to help wake them in the morning, or they have used multiple alarm clocks. As the disorder occurs in childhood and is most common in adolescence, it is often the patient's parents who initiate seeking help, after great difficulty waking their child in time for school.|$|E
25|$|By this time, Barry was openly {{suffering}} {{from the effects of}} longstanding addictions to cocaine and alcohol; he would later admit that he lost control of his drug habit soon after being sworn in for a third term.

His ability to function as mayor had become so impaired that even his closest associates urged him not to run again. They tried to create an endowed professorship for him at the University of the District of Columbia. In the wake of Barry's inattention, the city declined badly.
