40|$|There {{is growing}} {{knowledge}} about, and appreciation of, {{the importance of}} non-timber forest products (NTFPs) to rural livelihoods in developing countries, {{and to a lesser}} extent, developed countries. However, there is also an assumption on the part of policy-makers and many managers that any harvesting of wild animal or plant products from the forests and other natural and modified ecosystems must be detrimental to the long-term viability of <b>target</b> <b>populations</b> and <b>species.</b> This book challenges this idea and shows that while examples of such negative impacts certainly exist, there are also many examples of sustainable harvesting systems for NTFPs. The chapters review and present coherent and scientifically sound information and case studies on the ecologically sustainable use of NTFPs. They also outline a general interdisciplinary approach for assessing the sustainability of NTFP harvesting systems at different scales. A wide range of case studies is included from Africa, Asia and South America, using plant and animal products for food, crafts, textiles, medicines and cosmetics...|$|R
40|$|Procellariiform seabirds {{are among}} the avian species with the fastest rates of {{extinction}} due to interactions with fisheries and introduction of alien predators to the breeding colonies. Conservation and management policies <b>targeting</b> <b>populations</b> of these <b>species</b> must include information on colony demographics and levels of isolation and genetic markers {{go a long way}} toward providing reliable estimates of these parameters. To this end, we report isolation and character-ization of 14 anonymous nuclear loci, with average length of 657 bp, in the pelagic seabird White-faced Storm-petrel Pelagodroma marina, a species for which there is virtually no genetic information available. These loci, initially isolated from a genomic library built from P. marina, were further tested, for a range of conditions, in 7 other species representing all Procellariiform families. We found high levels of cross-specie...|$|R
40|$|As {{part of a}} multi-collaborator {{research}} project on the potential of non-timber forest product (NTFP) trade for conservation and development the authors designed tools to assess the effects of NTFP trade on people’s livelihoods and the environment. To assess livelihood outcomes of NTFP trade they used the Sustainable Rural Livelihoods framework and identified indicators to capture changes in financial, physical, natural, human and social assets at the household and community level. They also selected indicators to assess livelihood related changes at the national level. To assess {{the environmental impacts of}} commercial NTFP production this paper identified indicators at four levels: <b>target</b> <b>species</b> <b>population,</b> land use ecosystem, landscape, and global level. The method presented in this paper is meant to provide a time and cost effective tool to measure the effects of NTFP trade, based on expert judgment.

40|$|Fishing impacts {{biodiversity}} {{on multiple}} levels, potentially resulting in unintended feedbacks to economic {{performance of the}} fishery over time. For example, targeting observable traits within a population can impact genetic diversity, <b>targeting</b> <b>populations</b> within a <b>species</b> can impact <b>population</b> diversity, and <b>targeting</b> valuable species can impact biodiversity at the ecosystem level. The natural science and economics literatures, however, have given {{little attention to the}} impact of fishing on population diversity, even though population diversity is directly linked ecosystem services and estimates of population extinction rates are three orders of magnitude higher than species extinction rates. Here we develop a stochastic bioeconomic model that links the harvest of multiple salmon populations by a single commercial fishery to the trajectory of population diversity in a salmon stock complex. We parameterize our model with biological and economic data from the Copper River Chinook salmon fishery. We show that markets can incentivize the degradation of population diversity, reducing infra-marginal fishery rents and increase the variability in financial returns to the fishery. Factors impacting the magnitude of our results include the level and distribution of harvesting efficiency and market conditions. We also show that second-best management can conserve population diversity and improve welfare. Furthermore, depending fishermen’s time preferences, this management strategy is potentially self-financing...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{describe}} the dolphinfish bycatch rates in the longline fisheries of the Western Mediterranean and modelling the nominal bycatch abundance and distribution of dolphinfish from the Spanish Mediterranean as a function of technical, geographical, and seasonality factors. Our results indicate that the impact of the pelagic and semipelagic longline on the dolphinfish population is relatively low (1. 083 fishes per 1000 hooks), in contrast with the greater effect on the <b>target</b> <b>species</b> <b>population.</b> We obtained a statistically significant logistic model, with the following factors: technical characteristics of the fishery, geographical location, and seasonality. Drifting surface longliners targeting albacore is the gear with the highest effect on Mediterranean dolphinfish population. The technical characteristics of the fishery and seasonality factors have an important role in explaining the absence or presence of dolphinfish bycatch in the different boat strata, gear types, and seasons. Moreover, sea surface temperature and lunar phases also present additional explanations.

40|$|Interspecific {{competition}} {{can influence}} the distribution and abundance of species {{and the structure of}} ecological communities and entire ecosystems. Interactions between apex predators can have cascading effects through the entire natural community, which supports broadening the scope of conservation from single species to a much wider ecosystem perspective. However, competition between wild large carnivores can hardly be measured experimentally. In this study, we analyzed the expansion of the Scandinavian wolf (Canis lupus) population during its recovery from the early 1990 s. We took into account wolf-, habitat-, human- and brown bear (Ursus arctos) -related factors, because wolf expansion occurred within an area partially sympatric with bears. Wolf pair establishment was positively related to previous wolf presence and was negatively related to road density, distance to other wolf territories, and bear density. These findings suggest that both human-related habitat modification and interspecific competition have been influential factors modulating the expansion of the wolf population. Interactions between large carnivores have the potential to affect overall biodiversity. Therefore, conservation-oriented management of such species should consider interspecific interactions, rather than focusing only on <b>target</b> <b>populations</b> of single <b>species.</b> Long-term monitoring data across large areas should also help quantify and predict the influence of biotic interactions on species assemblages and distributions elsewhere. This is important because interactive processes can be essential in the regulation, stability, and resilience of ecological communitie...|$|R

40|$|Setting {{operational}} {{targets for}} the protection of species is crucial for identifying conservation priorities and for monitoring conservation actions' effectiveness. The use of quantitative targets for global species conservation has grown in the past ten years {{as a response to the}} commitment of reducing extinction rates established by the Convention on Biological Diversity. We reviewed the use of conservation targets in global scale conservation analyses, and found that most of the publications adopted species representation targets, corresponding to an amount of area to be protected. We found no work adequately targeting species' persistence, i. e. the complement to species extinction risk. Despite the adoption of pragmatic <b>population</b> <b>targets,</b> consisting in a number of individuals to be protected, has been recently proposed for global species conservation, the use of these targets at the species level is not always warranted. Pros and cons of using <b>population</b> persistence <b>targets</b> for <b>species</b> conservation have been discussed, yet the fundamental issue of how to scale these <b>targets</b> from <b>populations</b> to <b>species</b> is still unresolved. We discuss the process of "scaling up" <b>population</b> persistence <b>targets</b> to the species level using habitat distribution models, and test our approach in a case study on the European ground squirrel (Spermophilus citellus). We identified three main steps to be followed: (i) definition of a <b>population</b> <b>target,</b> (ii) characterisation of the species' populations by means of a habitat suitability model, and (iii) definition of a scaled species target. An up-scaled species target should include multiple conditions reflecting species persistence (number, size, location of the populations to be protected), uniqueness (e. g. evolutionary potential) and representativeness (e. g. presence in different ecosystems). Adopting scaled up species persistence targets within conservation planning approaches can allow protected area plans to give the highest contribution to reducing global species extinction risk...|$|R

Field research was carried out, in pear orchards in the Emilia-Romagna region (I), to study the side effects on populations of Anthocoris nemoralis F. of three different strategies to control the first generation of Cydia pomonella L. The strategies were: i) soft = application of CpGV, ii) OP = application of phosmet and chlorpyrifos and iii) reduced risk = thiacloprid and methoxyfenozide. These strategies were applied on large single block plots and the responses on Cacopsylla pyri L. and A. nemoralis F. populations were analysed by means of geostatistical approach. The A. nemoralis data was collected by means of a grid sampling plan based on referenced points while C. pyri were sampled as average of mobile instars per each plot. The population density of C. pyri and A. nemoralis were higher in OP and soft strategies than in the reduced risk strategy, but the prey/predator population ratio was similar for the three strategies.
