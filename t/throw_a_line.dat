50|$|A {{replacement}} lifeboat, William and Mary, was {{gifted in}} 1880 by {{the friends of}} the RNLI in Manchester. She had the same characteristics as her predecessor - self-righting, with a beam of 8 ft and 10 oars. Serving from 1880 to 1899, her 12 service launches resulted in the saving of 45 lives. One of her launches, on 25 November 1883, {{was one of the most}} notable achievements in the history of the Eastbourne Lifeboat. When news reached Eastbourne of a ship in trouble near Belle Tout Lighthouse, west of the town, the appalling weather conditions made it impossible to launch the lifeboat from Eastbourne beach. A team of seven horses was used to pull the boat on its carriage five miles overland to Birling Gap, with another three horses used to provide a boost on the steep hills in between. The Gap was too narrow to allow the lifeboat to pass through so it was offloaded onto skids while helpers cut away the banks to allow the boat to reach the beach. Launched into the teeth of a gale, the lifeboat was able to reach the stricken ship, the New Brunswick, after 45 minutes of rowing. The lifeboatmen were able to <b>throw</b> <b>a</b> <b>line</b> to the ship and evacuate the New Brunswick's eleven crewmembers. All managed to reach the shore successfully. In recognition of this feat, the lifeboatmen were awarded a special medal for the rescue of the New Brunswick.|$|E

50|$|The rescue was {{extremely}} dangerous because the waves were breaking around the wrecked H. C. Higginson. Captain James took the Nantasket out twice. The first attempt failed after forty-five minutes of rowing {{when the boat}} hit rocks that knocked two holes in it, making it necessary to return to shore to make temporary repairs using lead patches. On the second attempt, the Nantasket was rowed {{close enough to the}} schooner for the men to <b>throw</b> <b>a</b> <b>line</b> on board the H. C. Higginson. The first sailor to be rescued was in the mizzen rigging; he came cautiously down the shrouds, tied the line around his body, leaped overboard into the sea, and was hauled into the surf boat. Four other sailors in the fore rigging, exhausted from their long exposure, had to work their way with great difficulty into the main rigging. There they fastened lines to themselves and in turn jumped into the breaking waters and were hauled one by one into the Nantasket. Once in the surf boat, they were taken safely to the shore, where the half-starved and half-frozen men were quickly conveyed in carriages to the home of Selectman David O. Wade of Hull. Not all of the crew of the H. C. Higginson were so fortunate. Three lost their lives: the captain and one sailor were washed overboard in the night and a third man died in the rigging from exposure.|$|E
40|$|In Australia, 86 "rescuers" have drowned over 15 years (1992 - 2007). Many {{victims have}} needlessly drowned {{simply because of}} {{bystander}} unfamiliarity with the simple skill of throwing a lifeline or lifebuoy. The basic paradigm of aquatic lifesaving is to affect a rescue, without placing oneself at risk. Twenty-five fit, untrained adults were recruited to assess their lifeline throwing abilities. Results from 190 competitors as participants in the Line Throw events at the National Australian Pool Lifesaving Competition 2009 were analyzed for speed, efficacy, and accuracy. It takes a medium time of 35 s for an untrained bystander to throw a lifeline. Only 20 % can <b>throw</b> <b>a</b> <b>line</b> within 2 m of the target at a first attempt. In {{the heat of the}} moment, 20 % do not secure the end of the flung rope. Trained children can affect a 10 m accurate throw and pull a potential victim to safety with a medium elapsed time of 23 s. The Australian national record for trained lifesavers (adult, 12 meter), is 10. 08 s-world record 9. 06 s. This simple lifesaving technique, with training in improvisation (e. g., garden hoses), will undoubtedly save lives...|$|E

50|$|As {{early as}} 1791 John Bell (1747-1798) had devised <b>an</b> {{apparatus}} for <b>throwing</b> <b>a</b> <b>line</b> to ships from the shore; and, concurrently with Trengrouse, Captain George William Manby {{was engaged in}} perfecting an apparatus very similar to Bell's. The idea occurred to Manby in February 1807, after the grounding of HMS Snipe a mere 50 yards off shore in a storm and the subsequent loss of 67 lives, and in August he exhibited some experiments {{to the members of}} the Suffolk House Humane Society. He sought to establish communication between the shore and the shipwreck by means of <b>a</b> <b>line</b> fastened to <b>a</b> barbed shot which was fired from a mortar on the shore. By means of this <b>line</b> <b>a</b> hawser was drawn out from the shore to the ship, and along it was run a cradle in which the shipwrecked persons were landed. This invention had been recommended by various committees, and adopted to some extent before 1814.|$|R

40|$|The "Philadelphia" {{was built}} by David Bell at Buffalo, New York in 1868. From 1868 to 1873, the 236 foot vessel was owned by the Erie and Western Transportation Company of Buffalo, New York. From 1873 until 1893, she was owned by the Erie and Western at Erie, Pennsylvania. In a dense fog {{on the morning of}} November 7, 1893, she {{collided}} with the "Albany" 12 miles off Point aux Barques, Michigan in Lake Huron. The crew of the "Philadelphia" <b>threw</b> <b>a</b> <b>line</b> to the "Albany" and began towing her to Point aux Barques. But the "Albany" rapidly filled with water. After her crew transferred to the "Philadelphia," the "Albany" sank within a half an hour. When the "Philadelphia" began to sink in 200 feet of water, both crews took to the lifeboats.
