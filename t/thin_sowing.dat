40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this review}} {{is to examine the}} {{literature}} on possible animal models for anorexia nervosa. Method: The literature was searched using MedLine, PSYCHLIT, and CAB Abstracts using search items that included body composition, <b>thin</b> <b>sow</b> syndrome, and halo-thane gene. In addition, key workers in the field of animal husbandry and body composition were sent earlier drafts of the paper for comment. Results: <b>Thin</b> <b>sow</b> syndrome in pigs has some similarities to anorexia nervosa. Leanness and susceptibility to stress are associated in pigs with mutations of the ryanodine gene. Body composition in animals has a high herita-bility and various components of this overall composite trait are influenced to a major extent by polymorphism at specific gene loci. Discussion: Recent developments in understanding body composition in animals offer intriguing insights into anorexia nervosa and suggest several candidate genes which would be worthy of further examination. © 1997 by Joh...|$|R
40|$|When {{designing}} a feeding program for gestating sows, {{we must remember}} the overall goals for the nutrition program: 1) prepare sows to be in proper body condition at farrowing; 2) maximize reproductive performance (farrowing rate and litter size); and 3) meet the daily nutrient requirements at the lowest cost possible (measured as cost per sow per day). We {{are well aware of}} the problems with overfeeding gestating sows, including the unnecessary expense, potential problems with impaired mammary development, and reduced feed intake in lactation. Over-conditioned sows used to be the main problem on swine farms. In recent years, <b>thin</b> <b>sows</b> have become a more prevalent problem. Too little backfat reserves can reduce reproductive performance and increase sow mortality. Low backfat reserves also can be an animal welfare concern as <b>thin</b> <b>sows</b> have a greater chance of developing shoulder sores. Management techniques for accurate feeding levels. There is little disagreement on the importance of having sows in the correct body condition at farrowing. Although there is some disagreement on whether the idea...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 684 sows from {{breeding}} groups over six weeks {{were used to}} compare three methods of feeding during gestation and to assess the subsequent effects on lactation performance. Control gilts and sows were fed according to body condition based {{on a scale of}} 1 to 5, (1 =thin, 5 =fat). Sows were visually assessed for body condition at breeding and were assigned a daily feed allowance to achieve a body condition score of 3 at farrowing. Sow body condition was evaluated every two weeks throughout gestation, and feed allowance was adjusted as required. Treatment two used feeding levels based on backfat thickness (measured between d 0 and 5 after breeding) and weight at weaning for sows or weight at service for gilts. Feed allowance was calculated to achieve a target backfat of 19 mm at farrowing. Sow feeding level remained constant from d 0 to 101 of gestation. Feed allowances were based on modeled calculations of energy and nutrient requirements to achieve target sow maternal weight and backfat gain. Treatment three was identical to treatment two except that feeding pattern was altered for <b>thin</b> <b>sows</b> and gilts (21 mm) but no difference in the percentage of <b>thin</b> <b>sows</b> ( 21 mm) at farrowing compared to sows with < 21 mm. The high proportion of sows in the optimum backfat category demonstrates that feeding based on backfat and body weight has potential for facilitating more precise gestation feeding...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the present field experiment was to examine how plant density and en-hanced source, i. e. thinning treatments, may affect grain yield and its components for a non-prolific maize hybrid, SC 704. The environment of the hybrid maize crop was changed at intervals over its life cycle by removing every other plant in rows equispaced at 75 cm apart {{with a population of}} 13. 34 plants m- 2. The plants were grown with no wa-ter or nutrient restrictions. Results showed that earlier thinning was associated with greater stem, leaf, shoot and ear dry weight accumulation, ear kernel weight (EKW) and kernel number per ear row (KNER). In this ways the greatest of these characteristics were obtained in <b>thinning</b> at <b>sowing</b> i. e. 6. 67 plants m- 2 throughout. Delay in thinning un-til the 12 -leaf stage reduced stem dry weight and EKW significantly. Thinning at tasseling also resulted in significantly lower stem dry weight accumulation compared to <b>thinning</b> at <b>sowing.</b> At final harvest, the stem dry weight of plants thinned at tasseling was 20. 47 % (P< 0. 05) lower than those <b>thinned</b> at <b>sowing.</b> Similar effects were found upon delay in thinning until tasseling on leaf, shoot, and ear dry weight accumulation. Delay in thinning until the 12 -leaf stage or later, also reduced EKW significantly compared to plants <b>thinned</b> at <b>sowing.</b> This reduction was attributable to decreased KNER and 1000 -kernel weight. According to these results, KNER and 1000 -KW were found to be yield compo-nents sensitive to light environment...|$|R
2500|$|<b>Thin</b> <b>Sow</b> Syndrome (TSS) is a {{behavior}} observed in stalled sows {{that is similar}} to AA where some sows after early pregnancy are extremely active, eat little and waste away, resulting very often in death. They suffer from emaciation, hypothermia, a depraved appetite, restlessness and hyperactivity. [...] The syndrome may mainly be related to social and environmental stressors. [...] Stress in stalled sows is often perceived as the consequence of the restraint of animals that happens in intensive production units. The sows that suffer the most restraining conditions are those lactating or pregnant as they have very little room to move around because they are kept in barred gestation crates or tethered for the 16 weeks of pregnancy which prevents natural and social behaviors. [...] However, increased movement and freedom is also stressful for adult sows, which is usually the case after weaning. When placed into groups they fight vigorously, with one dominant sow emerging that eats voraciously. It is also likely that two subordinate sows make up part of the group who actively avoid competitive feeding situations and are bullied by the dominant sow. Affected sows have poor appetite but often show pica, excessive water intake (polydipsia) and are anemic.|$|R
40|$|A {{literature}} review {{was conducted on}} shoulder ulcers in sows. Shoulder ulcers are caused by pressure that the shoulder blade exerts against tissues that overlie it. Those issues lose blood supply and die. Because the pressure is directed outward, tissue damage occurs before the ulcer is evident on the skin surface. Ulcer prevalence is highly variable; 0 to more than 20 % of the sows in 218 herds evaluated had shoulder ulcers. Ulcers usually develop during late gestation and early lactation and many heal shortly after weaning. Numerous risk factors for developing shoulder ulcers have been identified. Inactivity and <b>thin</b> <b>sow</b> body condition {{seem to be the}} most important ulcer risk factors. Thus, farrowing caretakers may be able to prevent ulcers by carefully monitoring each sow’s lying behavior and attempting to fix any problem that restricts movement. Checking the gestation and lactation feeding programs to ensure that sows enter the farrowing area in proper body condition also may prevent ulcers. Experience from Denmark indicates a pad fixed to the shoulder of sows at the first sign of redness in the skin may prevent ulcers too. Sows starting to develop an ulcer benefit from treatment of underlying issues that cause inactivity, daily application of a topical disinfectant, early weaning and movement to a hospital pen, or a rubber mat to lie on in the farrowing crate. Close observation and appropriate care of sows especially around the time of farrowing should keep the incidence of shoulder ulcers low in the pork industry...|$|R
40|$|Sow longevity, or more {{accurately}} called sow productive life (SPL), {{has been a}} major focus point of concern in the swine industry for some time now. In addition to the animal and worker welfare concerns, industry leaders are realizing the substantial economical losses that occur when a farm has poor SPL in its commercial females. The economic benefits for increasing {{the average age of the}} females of reproductive age in the herd by one tenth of a parity are an additional $ 0. 23 and $ 0. 13 for every hog marketed in a farrow-tofinish and farrow-to-wean operations, respectively. Taken collectively, this sums up to over 15 million dollars in increased income in the US swine industry alone. Therefore even minor improvements to SPL can make an enormous impact of the financial bottom line for swine operations. Previous to this research, no studies have focused on the genes that play a pivotal role in SPL. Many researchers using model organisms such as nematodes, flies, and mice have shown a clear network of genes that play an integral role in increasing simple lifespan of these animals, primarily through a reduction in caloric intake or changes in the genes that mimic caloric restriction. These observations also hold true for human longevity studies. It is therefore our working hypothesis that these same genes may be involved in SPL. We realize that SPL and simple lifespan are not completely correlated. We are fully aware that in swine production <b>thinner</b> <b>sows</b> are typically culled earlier because they typically don’t have the body reserves to rely on during times of extreme nutrient requirements. We expect (and have encountered) alleles in these same genes from the model organisms that are associated with higher backfat to actually be the beneficial alleles for SPL. Our research has shown that there are several genes that can be selected for to improve the SPL of females at the commercial level...|$|R
25|$|The open {{canopy of}} cumin is another problem. Only a low {{proportion}} of the incoming light is absorbed. The leaf area index (LAI) of cumin is low (about 1.5). This might be a problem because weeds can compete with cumin for essential resources such as water and light and thereby lower yield. The slow growth and a short stature of cumin favours weed competition additionally. Two hoeing and weeding sessions (30 and 60 days after sowing) are needed for the control of weeds. During the first weeding session (30 days after <b>sowing),</b> <b>thinning</b> should be done, as well, to remove excess plants. The use of preplant or pre-emergence herbicides is very effective in India, but this kind of herbicide application requires soil moisture for a successful weed control.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the alternative applications on thinning based upon excessive manual labour in cotton production in Turkey`s field conditions. For this purpose, two different thinning systems were studied as alternative to conventional thinning system. Hand thinning, which is one of these systems, was applied through sparse sowing in low sowing norm using the pneumatic spacing drill. In the other system, thinning procedure was done with the rotary <b>thinner</b> after conventional <b>sowing.</b> The results were compared according to the parameters of emergence degree, working time requirements, cost and seed cotton yield. Finally, no differences were observed among the emergence degree values related to the systems applied. However, according to time requirements the lowest value (112. 86 h ha - 1) was obtained in the system which involved the use of rotary thinner. In terms of cost rotary thinner was 23. 18 and 30. 99 $ ha - 1 cheaper when compared to sparse sowing and conventional system, respectively. Thus, it was more economical than the other systems. Similarly, the highest value of seed cotton yield (4720. 95 kg ha - 1) was observed when the rotary thinner system was used...|$|R
