5|$|German {{politicians}} of the then government parties (Social Democrats and Liberals) {{as well as}} the opposition (the conservative Union parties) generally acclaimed the non-violent outcome of the hijacking. This reflected <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>opinion</b> that with the Munich attackers having left the country, the risk of further terrorist acts against German targets had diminished. Criticism evolved around the lack of sufficient airport security to prevent explosives being smuggled into passenger airliners, and Lufthansa not employing sky marshals, which at that time were already common on certain flights by El Al, Pan Am, Swissair, and others.|$|E

25|$|The {{criticism}} that the government received by conservatives proved unfounded: <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>opinion</b> followed almost fondly the events relating, as the conversion immediately took on the symbolic value of a real and lasting fiscal consolidation and a stable national unification.

5000|$|<b>The</b> term <b>public</b> <b>opinion</b> first {{emerged in}} France during the eighteenth century. <b>The</b> {{definition}} of <b>public</b> <b>opinion</b> has been debated over time.

That which floats and flows cannot be understood by being locked up in a formula... After all, when asked, everyone knows exactly what <b>public</b> <b>opinion</b> means.

25|$|Death {{sentences}} in post-Maoist mainland China can be politically or socially influenced.

5000|$|In general, {{similar to}} {{previous}} elections, the Intifada created a significant gap in <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>opinions,</b> as <b>the</b> <b>public</b> which once identified itself as [...] "moderate left" [...] drifted significantly {{away from the}} left, leaving a vacuum {{between it and the}} far left group.

25|$|The Winter War {{also helped}} reaffirm the Swedish position.

25|$|There was a {{chasm between}} the official, {{communist}} culture and genuine culture.
