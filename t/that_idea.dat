5|$|Poland had regained {{independence}} following World War I, in 1918. In 1919 Znaniecki {{contacted the}} newly founded Ministry of Religion and Education, offering {{to return to}} Poland if the Ministry could help him secure a chair at a Polish university. He proposed creating a novel Institute of Sociology, but bureaucracy and communication delays resulted in <b>that</b> <b>idea</b> being shelved, and he was offered a philosophy professorship at the newly organized Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań.|$|E
5|$|A common idea in {{the comics}} is that Bruce saw a Zorro film with his parents before they were murdered. Nolan {{explained}} that by ignoring <b>that</b> <b>idea</b> – which he stated is not found in Batman's first appearances – it {{emphasized the importance of}} bats to Bruce and that becoming a superhero is a wholly original idea on his part. It is for this reason Nolan believes other DC characters do not exist in the universe of his film; otherwise, Wayne's reasons for taking up costumed vigilantism would have been very different.|$|E
5|$|Drawing {{inspiration}} from the Mario series, Yoshizawa kept the same title but changed everything else; it became a platformer {{as opposed to a}} beat 'em up such as Double Dragon; the gameplay was modeled after Konami's Castlevania, with Ryu being equipped with a katana-like Dragon Sword, shurikens, and ninpo techniques such as fire wheels. In designing the protagonist Ryu Hayabusa, the development team wanted him to be unique from other ninjas. They designed him with a ninja vest in order to place emphasis on his muscles, and they furnished him with a cowl that arched outward. They originally wanted to equip Ryu with sensors and a helmet with an inside monitor to check his surroundings, but <b>that</b> <b>idea</b> was scrapped. According to Kato, they utilized specific locations and environments to justify the need for having a ninja for a main character.|$|E

50|$|Objection: Then {{why does}} {{everyone}} think that matter and an external world exist? Answer: People notice <b>that</b> some <b>ideas</b> appear {{in their minds}} independently of their wishes or desires. They then conclude <b>that</b> those <b>ideas</b> or perceived objects exist outside of the mind. This judgment, however, is a contradiction. Some philosophers, who know <b>that</b> <b>ideas</b> exist only in the mind, assume that there are external objects <b>that</b> resemble the <b>ideas.</b> They think <b>that</b> external objects cause internal, mental ideas.|$|R
5|$|The eagle was {{the largest}} {{denomination}} authorized by the Mint Act of 1792, which established the Bureau of the Mint. It was not struck until 1795, as the Mint at first struck copper and silver coins. The number of stars on the obverse was initially intended to be equal {{to the number of}} states in the Union, but with the number at 16, <b>that</b> <b>idea</b> was abandoned in favor of using 13 stars in honor of the original states. The initial reverse, featuring an eagle with a wreath in its mouth, proved unpopular and was replaced by a heraldic eagle.|$|E
5|$|Williams {{had wanted}} to make a horror game for eight years prior to Phantasmagoria, and had started to design one on several occasions, but none came to fruition. She felt the {{computer}} game industry and software technology had not yet reached the point where an effective and frightening computer game could be made. As a result, she decided to wait until CD-ROMs were faster and could handle real actors, which she believed was crucial for a horror game because she felt the player {{had to be able to}} empathize with the character to fear for them. Williams had been considering several horror story ideas for years before making the game. In one, the heroine answers a magician's advertisement for an assistant and gets the job, but the magician turns out to be insane. Another was set in the past, with the female protagonist getting involved in the supernatural life of a magician character. <b>That</b> <b>idea</b> evolved into a woman being married to a man who is drawn to a bizarre house that previously belonged to illusionists and is haunted by ghosts. The final story as it appears in the game has a contemporary setting, but combines elements from modern fiction, 19th century literature, and classic horror films of the 1950s.|$|E

5000|$|Friedrich Nietzsche held <b>that</b> the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> {{to treat}} others as more {{important}} than oneself is degrading and demeaning to the self.

40|$|Abstract: This paper argues <b>that</b> the <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> win out in {{economics}} {{are not necessarily}} those that a representative researcher would choose, but are rather the emergent result of the competition of ideas in which system replicator dynamics dominate. This means <b>that</b> those <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> fit the analytic technology available to researchers at the time dominate, while “better ” <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> do not offer advancement to researchers lose out. This paper spells out that view and offers a number of suggestions for heterodox European macro economists for competing and shaping the economic institutional environment...|$|R

40|$|Culturally {{counterintuitive}} {{concepts are}} <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> violate {{a small number}} of justifiable expectations raised by shared beliefs of a group of people.

25|$|We {{said this}} movie is a stylized movie, it’s not so {{different}} from the world of a musical. And there were a few other things that contributed to that direction. One was the decision on Universal’s part, a crazy decision, to shoot the movie almost entirely in the studio under a tarpaulin. They built this gigantic tarpaulin, and the Battery and all these other places were built as real places. The Richlands. And just so you know, this is the early ’80s and you had stylized films—like New York, New York—that were all done on set and <b>that</b> <b>idea</b> was in the air. <b>That</b> <b>idea</b> of a totally artificial universe. The point is that we had in mind one sentence inspired by George Lucas: “in a galaxy long ago,” a futuristic past. That was in our heads…there’s the past and there’s the future, sort of.|$|E
