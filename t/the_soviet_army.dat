5|$|In 1988, the East German {{leadership}} considered {{proposals to}} replace the expensive and intrusive fortifications with a high-technology system codenamed Grenze 2000. Drawing on technology used by <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Army</b> during the Soviet–Afghan War, it would have replaced the fences with sensors and detectors. However, the plan was never implemented.|$|E
5|$|In January 1945, with <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>army</b> approaching, the Germans {{decide to}} flee, taking 60,000 inmates on a death march to {{concentration}} camps in Germany.

5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s old {{ammunition}} stocks for the D-1 {{were removed from}} the Soviet inventory. The only shells retained were the OF-530, O-530, G-530/G-530Sh, and possibly chemical shells. <b>The</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Army</b> also possessed a 152mm nuclear shell, {{but it is not clear}} whether that shell could be used with the D-1.|$|E
5|$|Although war pigeons {{and mobile}} dovecotes were used {{extensively}} during the Second World War, {{it is unclear}} to what extent, if any, they were employed for aerial photography. According {{to a report in}} 1942, <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>army</b> discovered abandoned German trucks with pigeon cameras that could take photos in five-minute intervals, as well as dogs trained to carry pigeons in baskets. On the allied side, as late as 1943 it was reported that the American Signal Corps was aware of the possibility of adopting the technique.|$|E
5|$|From 1918–1940, when Estonia was independent, {{the small}} Swedish {{community}} was well treated.

5|$|Smyth {{writes that}} as a result of Husky, Hitler {{suspended}} the Kursk offensive on 13July. This was partly because of the performance of <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>army,</b> but partly because he still assumed that the Allied landing on Sicily was a feint that preceded the invasion in the Balkans, and he wanted to have troops available for fast deployment to meet them. Smyth observes that once Hitler gave up the initiative to the Soviets, he never regained it.|$|E

5|$|The Hungarian Revolution of 1956 {{occurred}} {{shortly after}} Khrushchev arranged {{the removal of}} Hungary's Stalinist leader Mátyás Rákosi. In response to a popular uprising, the new regime formally disbanded the secret police, declared its intention {{to withdraw from the}} Warsaw Pact and pledged to re-establish free elections. <b>The</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Army</b> invaded. Thousands of Hungarians were arrested, imprisoned and deported to the Soviet Union, and approximately 200,000 Hungarians fled Hungary in the chaos. Hungarian leader Imre Nagy and others were executed following secret trials.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Army</b> {{captured}} {{large numbers}} of German armored vehicles, including Panzer IVs (Russian designation T-4).

5|$|Vazgen Sargsyan {{was born}} in Ararat village, Soviet Armenia, near the Turkish border, on 5 March 1959, to Greta and Zaven Sargsyan. After {{finishing}} secondary school in his village, he attended the Yerevan Institute of Physical Culture from 1976 to 1979. He worked as a physical education teacher at the secondary school in Ararat from 1979 to 1983.

5|$|Activated in 1921, the {{division}} was created as an infantry unit {{with a focus}} on nighttime combat operations. Deployed during World War II, {{the division}} saw almost 200 days of fighting in northwestern Europe as it fought through France, Belgium, and western Germany, fighting back several fierce German counterattacks as it advanced through the theater throughout late 1944 and 1945. This was the only combat duty that the 104th Infantry Division has served during its history. At the end of the fighting on 7 May 1945 (V-E Day), this division was in central Germany opposite the troops of its allies from <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Army.</b>|$|E
5|$|Brezhnev {{temporarily}} left <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Army</b> {{with the}} rank of Major General in August 1946. He had spent the entire war as a political commissar rather than a military commander. After working on reconstruction projects in Ukraine, he again became General Secretary in Dnipropetrovsk. In 1950, he became a deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union's highest legislative body. Later that year he was appointed Party First Secretary in the Moldavian SSR. In 1952, he {{had a meeting with}} Stalin after which Stalin promoted Brezhnev to the Communist Party's Central Committee as a candidate member of the Presidium (formerly the Politburo).|$|E
50|$|From 1945 to 1951, <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Army's</b> {{soldiers}} were {{stationed at the}} airbase. In the early 1950s, <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> handed <b>the</b> airbase to the Polish Air Force. It was then used by the 39th Fighter Regiment, created on 17 April 1951.|$|R
50|$|Parts of the Polish First Army also briefly used M4A2 (76 mm) {{borrowed}} from <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>armies</b> after heavy {{losses in the}} conquest of Danzig. After receiving replacements, the army was re-equipped with T-34s.|$|R
50|$|Jack Bradley Fahy (1908-1947) was an American {{government}} official. He allegedly spied for <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Naval GRU during World War II.

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the encirclement of the 6th Army on 23 November 1942, the Geschwaderstab was moved to Morozovskaya-West, outside the Stalingrad pocket. Wilcke organized fighter escort missions for the transport aircraft delivering supplies for the 6th Army. Pressed by the advancing Soviet armored spearheads, Morozovskaya-West had to be abandoned by the Geschwaderstab on 23 December, and the aircraft were moved to Morozovskaya-South, which was not yet threatened by <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Army.</b> On 3 January 1943, this airfield had to be abandoned as well and the Geschwaderstab was relocated to Tazinskaya, there it remained until the fighting over the Stalingrad pocket ended. During this period the Geschwaderstab claimed 25 victories, 21 by Wilcke and 4 by Dahl, for the loss in action of two pilots.|$|E
5|$|Wallenberg started {{sleeping}} in a different house each night, to guard against being captured or killed by Arrow Cross Party members or by Adolf Eichmann's men. Two days before <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Army</b> occupied Budapest, Wallenberg negotiated with Eichmann and with Major-General Gerhard Schmidthuber, the supreme commander of German forces in Hungary. Wallenberg bribed Arrow Cross Party member Pál Szalai to deliver a note in which Wallenberg persuaded the occupying Germans to prevent a Fascist plan {{to blow up the}} Budapest ghetto and kill an estimated 70,000 Jews. The note also persuaded the Germans to cancel a final effort to organize a death march of the remaining Jews in Budapest by threatening to have them prosecuted for war crimes once the war was over.|$|E
5|$|As <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Army</b> {{pushed the}} Wehrmacht {{back on the}} Eastern Front, it became {{necessary}} to reactivate Prinz Eugen as a gunnery support vessel; on 1 October 1943, the ship was reassigned to combat duty. In June 1944, Prinz Eugen, the heavy cruiser Lützow, and the 6th Destroyer Flotilla formed the Second Task Force, later renamed Task Force Thiele after its commander, Vizeadmiral August Thiele. Prinz Eugen was at this time {{under the command of}} KzS Hans-Jürgen Reinicke; throughout June she steamed in the eastern Baltic, northwest of the island of Utö as a show of force during the German withdrawal from Finland. On 19–20 August, the ship steamed into the Gulf of Riga and bombarded Tukums. Four destroyers and two torpedo boats supported the action, along with Prinz Eugens Ar 196 floatplanes; the cruiser fired a total of 265 shells from her main battery. Prinz Eugens bombardment was instrumental in the successful repulse of the Soviet attack.|$|E
