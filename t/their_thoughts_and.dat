5|$|The Upanishad {{describes}} four {{kinds of}} sannyasins (Hindu monks), their eating habits and lifestyle. Yoga is {{the path of}} spiritual liberation for all four. Of these, the Paramahamsa monks are discussed in this text at greater length, and described as loners who are patient with everyone, free from dualism in <b>their</b> <b>thoughts,</b> <b>and</b> who meditate on their soul and the Brahman.|$|E
5|$|In myth, {{the gods}} behave much like humans. They feel emotion; they can eat, drink, fight, weep, sicken, and die. Some have unique {{character}} traits. Set is aggressive and impulsive, and Thoth, patron {{of writing and}} knowledge, is prone to long-winded speeches. Yet overall, the gods are more like archetypes than well drawn characters. Their behavior is inconsistent, and <b>their</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>and</b> motivations are rarely stated. Most myths about them lack highly developed characters and plots, because the symbolic meaning of the myths {{was more important than}} elaborate storytelling.|$|E
5|$|On Earth, Arthur's double, {{known as}} the Skinless Boy, has thrown a {{hospital}} near Arthur's home into panic by infecting staff and patients with a fungoid, extraterrestrial life-form which allows him to read and eventually control <b>their</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>and</b> actions. This fungus, nicknamed Grayspot, is mistaken for a biological weapon, and the hospital put under quarantine. Leaf infiltrates the hospital, seeking to obtain and destroy the magical object used to create the Skinless Boy: a pocket torn from one of Arthur's shirts. She succeeds, but is infected by Grayspot in the process. She then leaves the hospital, {{only to find that}} the House has appeared above it and cannot be reached from the ground. With the help of a retired pharmacist named Sylvie, Leaf makes her way to Arthur's house where she uses a special telephone to contact Arthur's friends and get help, just as the fungus gains full control of her body.|$|E

25|$|The idea of {{self-concept}} {{is known}} as the ability of a person to have opinions and beliefs that are defined confidently, consistent and stable. Early in adolescence, cognitive developments result in greater self-awareness, greater awareness of others and <b>their</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>and</b> judgments, the ability to think about abstract, future possibilities, and the ability to consider multiple possibilities at once. As a result, adolescents experience a significant shift from the simple, concrete, and global self-descriptions typical of young children; as children, they defined themselves by physical traits whereas as adolescents, they define themselves based on their values, thoughts, and opinions.|$|E
25|$|Witches and Stitches, {{a series}} of early digital comics, from the 1980s, which were the first webcomics ever published. This {{unauthorized}} Wizard of Oz parody comic was published by Millikin on CompuServe as early as 1985 {{when he was in}} elementary school. Publishing on Compuserve allowed Millikin to self-publish, avoiding censorship. Witches and Stitches was popular with audiences around the world and Millikin's success inspired many artists to create their own webcomics. Copies of Witches and Stitches are now often difficult to find because Millikin was threatened with a lawsuit over the comic. Millikin's outspoken autobiographical style paved the way for other artists to express <b>their</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>and</b> opinions on the web.|$|E
25|$|The novel {{initially}} received {{mixed reviews}} {{and was not}} expected to be a commercial success by its publishers, but has since become a revered household classic—and by 2004 had sold more than 700,000 units and had been printed in 60 editions in Finland. It launched Väinö Linna into a steady career as a public figure and The Unknown Soldier was adapted into different formats, such as theatre, cinema and audiobooks. Although the book was critized, for example, by senior officers of the Finnish Defence Forces as an erroneus account of hte War, the book was well received by the masses and frontline veterans who thought it depicted <b>their</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>and</b> experiences accurately. The cover art of a soldier's white silhouette against a red background, designed by Martti Mykkänen, became similarly famous and is often used as a symbol for war in Finland.|$|E

25|$|The art {{of writing}} Chinese {{characters}} is called Chinese calligraphy. It is usually done with ink brushes. In ancient China, Chinese calligraphy {{is one of}} the Four Arts of the Chinese Scholars. There is a minimalist set of rules of Chinese calligraphy. Every character from the Chinese scripts is built into a uniform shape by means of assigning it a geometric area in which the character must occur. Each character has a set number of brushstrokes; none must be added or taken away from the character to enhance it visually, lest the meaning be lost. Finally, strict regularity is not required, meaning the strokes may be accentuated for dramatic effect of individual style. Calligraphy was the means by which scholars could mark <b>their</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>and</b> teachings for immortality, and as such, represent some of the more precious treasures that can be found from ancient China.|$|E
25|$|Calligraphic {{process is}} also {{structured}} {{in the same}} way as wéiqí. A minimalist set of rules conveys a system of incredible complexity and grandeur. Every character from the Chinese scripts is built into a uniform shape by means of assigning it a geometric area in which the character must occur. Only three basic forms are used in the creation of the character, those being square, triangle and circle. Each character has a set number of brushstrokes, none must be added or taken away from the character to enhance it visually, lest the meaning be lost. Finally, strict regularity is not required, meaning the strokes may be accentuated for dramatic effect or individual style.

25|$|Some {{research}} has found {{the average length of}} abstinence for bulimics in OA was significantly higher than the average length for binge eaters. Paradoxically, bulimics were also found to attend fewer meetings, and had less of a commitment to write <b>their</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>and</b> feelings down daily. However, the frequency of relapse for bulimics and binge eaters was not significantly different. The differences may be explained by the predictable nature of the bulimic cycle. Other {{research has}} found binge eaters in OA had better success than bulimics. Most OA members who have reported negative experiences in the program are anorexic. This could be caused by OA's focus on problems of eating too much rather than too little. Some OA practices, such as refraining from eating certain kinds of foods, are antithetical in the case of anorexics. Though, most anorexics have a previous history of bulimia.|$|E

25|$|There is {{a strong}} {{correlation}} between child abuse, especially child sexual abuse, and development of BPD. Many individuals with BPD report a history of abuse and neglect as young children, but causation is still debated. Patients with BPD {{have been found to be}} significantly more likely to report having been verbally, emotionally, physically, or sexually abused by caregivers of either gender. They also report a high incidence of incest and loss of caregivers in early childhood. Individuals with BPD were also likely to report having caregivers of both sexes deny the validity of <b>their</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>and</b> feelings. Caregivers were also reported to have failed to provide needed protection and to have neglected their child's physical care. Parents of both sexes were typically reported to have withdrawn from the child emotionally and to have treated the child inconsistently. Additionally, women with BPD who reported a previous history of neglect by a female caregiver and abuse by a male caregiver were significantly more likely to experience sexual abuse by a non-caregiver.|$|E
500|$|Many {{men come}} to church to save or gain a reputation; {{or because they}} will not be singular, but comply with an {{established}} custom; yet, all the while, they are loaded with the guilt of old rooted sins.

500|$|Hazlitt's {{discussion}} of the particular characters incorporates observations about the way Shakespeare creates them, showing that, rather than being broad types, characters even superficially similar differ in finely discriminated ways. Desdemona and Emilia, for example, are [...] "to outward appearance, characters of common life, not more distinguished than women generally are, by difference of rank and situation." [...] As the dialogue unfolds, [...] "the difference of <b>their</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>and</b> sentiments is however laid open, their minds are separated from each other by signs as plain and as little to be mistaken as the complexions of their husbands." ...|$|E

40|$|High {{functioning}} {{students with}} autism spectrum disorder (ASD) manifest rigidity in <b>their</b> <b>thought</b> <b>and</b> behavioural patterns, {{which are often}} regarded as negative and challenging trait that disadvantage them in their learning. As a result, their teachers often dismiss them as incapable of literary appreciation and so exclude them from rich and meaningful literary experiences which include reading classics and creative writing. However, the author, a former mainstream school teacher and university academic, of this paper firmly believes that literary appreciation and creative writing could still be taught to such students by tapping on <b>their</b> <b>thought</b> <b>and</b> behavioural rigidity and utilise it as a teaching tool {{to teach them how}} to create free verses. In this paper, the author has created a scaffolding strategy – Question-and-Answer Scaffolding Structure (QASS) – and also illustrated how he has used it to teach his students with ASD to create free verses...|$|R
