Now can a taxpayer from California in your view challenge that?" [...] Clement responded [...] "I say no. I would say no, no." [...] Because in his reading of Flast, [...] "You need a congressional statute that is an exercise of the taxing and spending authority; but then you need the money to go outside the Government." [...] Breyer than asked if [...] "All over America, they build churches dedicated to one religion; and Congress passes a statute and says in every city, town, and hamlet, {{we are going to have}} a minister, a Government minister, a Government church, and dedicated to the proposition that this particular sect is the true sect; and they pass a statute like that, nobody could challenge it?"

5000|$|The glyph used in {{the modern}} Western world to {{represent}} the number 2 traces its roots back to the Brahmin Indians, who wrote [...] "2" [...] as two horizontal lines. The modern Chinese and Japanese languages still use this method. The Gupta rotated the two lines 45 degrees, making them diagonal, and sometimes also made the top line shorter and made its bottom end curve towards the center of <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>line.</b> Apparently for speed, the Nagari started making the top line more like a curve and connecting to <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>line.</b> <b>The</b> Ghubar Arabs made <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> completely vertical, and now the glyph looks like a dotless closing question mark. Restoring <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> to its original horizontal position, but keeping the top line as a curve that connects to <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> leads to our modern glyph.|$|R

Organizations must instead <b>think</b> about <b>the</b> “Triple <b>Bottom</b> Line” and its implications for their ability to grow their brand, customer loyalty and profits. The three components of <b>the</b> Triple <b>Bottom</b> <b>Line</b> are: people and community (social responsibility), planet (environmental sustainability) and profit (<b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>line).</b> Successful 21 st century organizations must consider how {{they are going to}} actively engage in each of <b>the</b> Triple <b>Bottom</b> <b>Line</b> components. This requires many organizations to adopt a more innovative approach to business, while constantly communicating with current and potential customers. Why should any of us care about incorporating a Triple <b>Bottom</b> <b>Line</b> approach to business? Consumer demands, combined with the world’s rising population, unstable economic situation and environmental struggles have created a new global climate that no organization can afford to ignore...|$|R
