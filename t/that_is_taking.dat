5|$|Mughal-e-Azam {{is one of}} {{only two}} films {{directed}} by Asif; one of his unfinished projects was released posthumously as a tribute. Over time the title has become part of Bollywood vernacular, used to describe a project <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>taking</b> too long to complete. Art director Omung Kumar, who has designed sets for major Indian films such as Black (2005) and Saawariya (2007), said that he and others in his field look to Mughal-e-Azam as a source of inspiration for art direction. It has also been used {{as a model for the}} perfect love story, requiring directors to ensure lovers overcome obstacles. Following her success in the film, Madhubala could have gone on to land further major roles, but she was advised not to overwork owing to her heart condition, and had to withdraw from some productions that were already underway.|$|E

25|$|Thus, a Lisp list is not {{an atomic}} object, as an {{instance}} of a container class in C++ or Java would be. A list {{is nothing more than}} an aggregate of linked conses. A variable which refers to a given list is simply a pointer to the first cons in the list. Traversal of a list can be done by cdring down the list; <b>that</b> <b>is,</b> <b>taking</b> successive cdrs to visit each cons of the list; or by using any of several higher-order functions to map a function over a list.|$|E
25|$|A random {{variable}} has a probability distribution, which specifies {{the probability that}} its value falls in any given interval. Random variables can be discrete, <b>that</b> <b>is,</b> <b>taking</b> any of a specified finite or countable list of values, endowed with a probability mass function characteristic of the {{random variable}}'s probability distribution; or continuous, taking any numerical value in an interval or collection of intervals, via a probability density function that is characteristic of the random variable's probability distribution; or a mixture of both types. Two random variables with the same probability distribution can still differ {{in terms of their}} associations with, or independence from, other random variables. The realizations of a random variable, that is, the results of randomly choosing values according to the variable's probability distribution function, are called random variates.|$|E
25|$|The role {{of forests}} in the {{national}} economy and in ecology was further emphasized in the 1988 National Forest Policy, which focused on ensuring environmental stability, restoring the ecological balance, and preserving the remaining forests. Other objectives of the policy were meeting the need for fuelwood, fodder, and small timber for rural and tribal people while recognising the need to actively involve local people {{in the management of}} forest resources. Also in 1988, the Forest Conservation Act of 1980 was amended to facilitate stricter conservation measures. A new target was to increase the forest cover to 33% of India's land area from the then-official estimate of 23%. In June 1990, the central government adopted resolutions that combined forest science with social forestry, <b>that</b> <b>is,</b> <b>taking</b> the sociocultural traditions of the local people into. The cumulative area afforested during the 1951-91 period was nearly 179,000 square kilometres. However, despite large-scale tree planting programmes, forestry is one arena in which India has actually regressed since independence. Annual fellings at about four times the growth rate are a major cause. Widespread pilfering by villagers for firewood and fodder also represents a major decrement. In addition, the 1988 National Forest Policy noted, the forested area has been shrinking as a result of land cleared for farming and development programmes.|$|E

[...] "They are returning again and again to repeat an experience <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>taking</b> a 3-hour and 14-minute chunk out of their lives, and dragging others with them, so they can share the emotion." [...] Cameron emphasized people from all ages (ranging from 8 to 80) and from all backgrounds were [...] "celebrating their own essential humanity" [...] by seeing it. He described the script as earnest and straightforward, and said it intentionally [...] "incorporates universals of human experience and emotion that are timeless – and familiar because they reflect our basic emotional fabric" [...] and that the film was able to succeed in this way by dealing with archetypes. He did not see it as pandering. [...] "Turan mistakes archetype for cliche," [...] he said. [...] "I don't share his view that the best scripts are only the ones that explore the perimeter of human experience, or flashily pirouette their witty and cynical dialogue for our admiration." ...|$|E

2500|$|Except for the 30th Anniversary Special, {{which was}} taped at Harrah's Rio in Las Vegas, Nevada, The Price Is Right has been taped in Studio 33 in CBS Television City in Hollywood, California for its entire run. The studio, {{which is also}} used for other {{television}} productions, was renamed the Bob Barker Studio in the host's honor on the ceremonial 5,000th episode taped in March 1998. When Carey became host, {{there was talk of}} the show traveling in the future. The program is usually produced in about an hour, although if there is a guest involved, some tapings will last longer because of question and answer sessions by the audience and the guest, which the host usually moderates. Two episodes are usually taped each day, normally with three taping days per week (Monday through Wednesday, with one episode taped at 12:00pm and another at 4:00pm). The program is taped in advance of its airdate. For example, the show broadcast on February 28, 2008 was taped on January 16. As with many other shows that start production in the summer, the lead time varies during the season, as many as fifteen weeks to as little as one day. The audience is entertained by the announcer before taping begins and in case of guests, the guest will answer questions from the audience. After the taping session, there is a drawing for a door prize. On some episodes, all members of the audience receive a prize from a sponsor or celebrity guest; those prizes are usually mentioned in the Showcase (such as a complimentary slice of Papa John's Pizza, an NHL Winter Classic game puck, a couples' gift box from Hershey's or a book authored by a guest). Television and Internet viewers have also been directed to the show's official website to enter a drawing for a similar prize offered to all viewers or another prize related to the special offer (such as the Rock of Ages signed CD). Some episodes are taped [...] "out-of-order" [...] so that a specific episode will air after other episodes have aired. Notably, the Christmas Week episodes are usually taped in early December outside of the regular rotation. An episode may be taped out-of-order if a prize package reflects a trip to an event <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>taking</b> place close to the date that episode will air (primarily with CBS properties such as the Academy of Country Music Awards, NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship, and various NFL on CBS games, most notably CBS Super Bowl years since Carey took over, but other games are offered). Other episodes may be aired out-of-order because of game-related incidents or situations beyond the network's control. Most episodes which have aired out of order have occurred when the show is taped far in advance, but in the time between the show taping and its airdate, a natural disaster took place at the trip venue. This happened in June 2005 with episodes that featured trips to New Orleans (which was later struck by Hurricane Katrina), with airdates moved to May and June 2006 and again in April 2010 with episodes that featured trips to Nashville, Tennessee (due to the May 2010 Tennessee floods), with airdates moved to September 2010.|$|E
