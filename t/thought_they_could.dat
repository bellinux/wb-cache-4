5|$|Attrition by 1942 {{had created}} a {{shortage}} of experienced combat leaders. No special training was made available for this role. Galland set up a course in late 1943, but it only lasted a few months. Galland {{was quoted as saying}} he <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> learn the skills while on operations, as he had. This ignored his own talents, and blithely expected other pilots to reach his high standards.|$|E
5|$|At the convention, held August 5–8, Agnew {{abandoned}} his favorite son status, placing Nixon's name in nomination. Nixon narrowly secured the nomination {{on the first}} ballot. In the discussions that followed about a running mate, Nixon kept his counsel while various party factions <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> influence his choice: Strom Thurmond, the senator from South Carolina, told a party meeting that he held a veto on the vice presidency. It was evident that Nixon wanted a centrist, though there was little enthusiasm when he first proposed Agnew, and other possibilities were discussed. Some party insiders thought that Nixon had privately settled on Agnew early on, and that the consideration of other candidates {{was little more than}} a charade. On August 8, after a final meeting of advisers and party leaders, Nixon declared that Agnew was his choice, and shortly afterwards announced his decision to the press. Delegates formally nominated Agnew for the vice presidency later that day, before adjourning.|$|E
5|$|Beyond the band's {{specific}} {{legal issues}} and {{insight into the}} making of the new album, the film also examines the state of the modern music industry as a whole, focusing on the complex relationships between major labels and their artists. Other musicians give their first-hand accounts of their own experiences in the business. The logistics and economics of how a record company works are explained by music industry insiders, including former EMI employees, music producers and music journalists. They trace the impact of the growing American economic recession on the industry, wherein many companies were taken over by larger groups who <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> save them. In this instance, Terra Firma Capital Partners sought to rescue EMI despite having little experience in music management.|$|E

60|$|A short pause followed, {{during which}} the freedman and the singing-boy stared upon each other in mutual perplexity. At length the one resumed his address of apology, and the other resumed his efforts on the lyre. Once more, after an interval, the eyes of Vetranio lazily unclosed, {{and this time he}} began to speak; but his thoughts--if <b>thoughts</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> be called--were as yet wholly {{occupied}} by the 'table-talk' at the past night's banquet.|$|R
5|$|In 1984 Robert Holmes à Court, {{the wealthy}} Australian {{investor}} who owned ATV Music Publishing, {{announced he was}} putting the ATV catalog up for sale. In 1981, McCartney was offered the ATV music catalog for £20 million ($40 million). According to McCartney, he contacted Yoko Ono about making a joint purchase by splitting the cost at £10 million each, but Ono <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> buy it for £5 million each. When {{they were unable to}} make a joint purchase, McCartney, {{who did not want to}} be the sole owner of the Beatles' songs, did not pursue an offer on his own. According to a negotiator for Holmes à Court in the 1984 sale, McCartney was given first right of refusal and declined to purchase. Jackson was informed of the sale by his attorney, John Branca, in September 1984. An attorney for McCartney also assured Branca that McCartney was not interested in bidding. McCartney reportedly felt it was too expensive, but several other companies and investors were interested in bidding. Jackson submitted a bid of $46 million on November 20, 1984. His agents thought they had a deal several times, but encountered new bidders or new areas of debate. In May 1985, Jackson's team left talks after having spent more than $1 million and four months of due diligence work on the negotiations. In June 1985, Jackson and Branca learned that Charles Koppelman's and Marty Bandier's The Entertainment Company had made a tentative agreement with Holmes à Court to buy ATV Music for $50 million; however, in early August, Holmes à Court's team contacted Jackson and talks resumed. Jackson raised his bid to $47.5 million, which was accepted because he could close the deal more quickly, having already completed due diligence of ATV Music. Jackson also agreed to visit Holmes à Court in Australia, where he would appear on the Channel Seven Perth Telethon. Jackson's purchase of ATV Music was finalized on August 10, 1985.|$|E

25|$|In April 1897, Thomson {{had only}} early {{indications}} that the cathode rays could be deflected electrically (previous investigators such as Heinrich Hertz had <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not be). A month after Thomson's announcement of the corpuscle, he found that he could reliably deflect the rays by an electric field if he evacuated the discharge tube to a very low pressure. By comparing the deflection of a beam of cathode rays by electric and magnetic fields he obtained more robust measurements of the mass-to-charge ratio that confirmed his previous estimates. This became the classic means of measuring the charge and mass of the electron.|$|E

25|$|By 1870, the Democratic–Conservative {{leadership}} {{across the}} South decided {{it had to}} end its opposition to Reconstruction and black suffrage to survive {{and move on to}} new issues. The Grant administration had proven by its crackdown on the Ku Klux Klan that it would use as much federal power as necessary to suppress open anti-black violence. Democrats in the North concurred with these Southern Democrats. They wanted to fight the Republican Party on economic grounds rather than race. The New Departure offered the chance for a clean slate without having to re-fight the Civil War every election. Furthermore, many wealthy Southern landowners <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> control part of the newly enfranchised black electorate to their own advantage.|$|E
25|$|The {{growth of}} Super Tuscans is also {{rooted in the}} {{restrictive}} DOC practices of the Chianti zone prior to the 1990s. During this time Chianti could be composed {{of no more than}} 70% Sangiovese and had to include at least 10% of one of the local white wine grapes. Producers who deviated from these regulations could not use the Chianti name on their wine labels and would be classified as vino da tavola - Italy's lowest wine designation. By the 1970s, the consumer market for Chianti wines was suffering and the wines were widely perceived to be lacking quality. Many Tuscan wine producers <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> produce a better quality wine if they were not hindered by the DOC regulations.|$|E
25|$|In this book, {{mention is}} made, {{from both the}} conquered peoples and the Draka themselves, of the Western Allies refusal to join forces with Nazi Germany, even though Adolf Hitler was dead by late 1942 (officially by heart attack, but in reality assassinated by German Military Intelligence), to fight the Draka once the full horror of the Drakan onslaught's threat to European {{civilisation}} is apparent. Widespread disgust and revulsion at Germany's genocidal policies towards political, ideological and racial enemies, and utter hatred by former occupied countries are cited {{as the cause of}} this reluctance even though the Draka treatment to defeated enemies is, by that stage, universally known. Both Nazi Germany and the Allies foolishly <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> defeat the Draka without uniting.|$|E

25|$|At one point, the Alliance was at 30.5% in the polls, {{and some}} <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> win a {{minority}} government. On election night, the Alliance increased their seats over Reform totals from 60 to 66, and kept Reform's strong representation in western Canada, but the hoped-for breakthrough in Ontario did not occur, {{with the party}} electing just two MPs in that province. However, the Alliance increased their overall vote totals by over one million and reduced the Progressive Conservatives to 12 seats in the House of Commons. The Liberals' attacks on Day ended up decimating the NDP and Progressive Conservatives, as many voters who would otherwise have supported those parties voted strategically for the Liberals to prevent an Alliance victory.|$|E
25|$|Interscope gave us, like, {{a million}} bucks last year, and we built a {{recording}} studio, and then they basically didn't do too well with Pummel, so we bailed out and took our recording studio with us. I think the thing they didn't realize, and we did realize, is that it's easier to market some of those mall punk bands because you've got the fashion that's there with it; you know, the nice hairdos and the fake British accents. But with All or Descendents, it's basically these ugly dork people playing music. They <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> market {{it because it was}} the right music, but the fact of it is that the music doesn't {{have anything to do with}} anything, really. We knew that.|$|E
25|$|In {{considering}} {{the history of}} the Free India Legion, the most controversial aspect is its integral link to the Nazi Germany, with a widespread perception that they were collaborators with Nazi Germany by the virtue of their uniform, oath and field of operation. The views of the founder and leader of the Azad Hind movement, Subhas Chandra Bose, were somewhat more nuanced than straightforward support for the Axis. During the 1930s Bose had organised and led protest marches against Japanese imperialism, and wrote an article attacking Japanese imperialism, although expressing admiration for other aspects of the Japanese regime. Bose's correspondence prior to 1939 also showed his deep disapproval of the racist practices and annulment of democratic institutions by the Nazis. He nonetheless expressed admiration for the authoritarian methods which he saw in Italy and Germany during the 1930s, and <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> be used in building an independent India.|$|E

25|$|In {{the night}} between 27 and 28 October 1922, about 30,000 Fascist blackshirts {{gathered}} in Rome {{to demand the}} resignation of liberal Prime Minister Luigi Facta and {{the appointment of a}} new Fascist government. On the morning of 28 October, King Victor Emmanuel III, who according to the Albertine Statute held the supreme military power, refused the government request to declare martial law, which led to Facta's resignation. The King then handed over power to Mussolini (who stayed in his headquarters in Milan during the talks) by asking him to form a new government. The King's controversial decision has been explained by historians as a combination of delusions and fears; Mussolini enjoyed a wide support in the military and among the industrial and agrarian elites, while the King and the conservative establishment were afraid of a possible civil war and ultimately <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> use Mussolini to restore law and order in the country, but failed to foresee the danger of a totalitarian evolution.|$|E

2500|$|With {{the growing}} canonization of the {{contents}} of the Hebrew Bible, both in terms of the books that it contained, and the version of the text in them, and an acceptance that new texts could not be added, there came a need to produce material that would clearly differentiate between that text, and rabbinic interpretation of it. [...] By collecting and compiling these <b>thoughts</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> be presented in a manner which helped to refute claims that they were only human interpretations. The argument being that by presenting the various collections of different schools of thought each of which relied upon close study of the text, the growing difference between early biblical law, and its later rabbinic interpretation could be reconciled.|$|R

500|$|A Metroid {{game was}} rumored to be in {{development}} for the Nintendo 64, but it never entered production. Producer Shigeru Miyamoto said this was because Nintendo [...] "couldn't come out with any concrete ideas".

Nintendo approached another company to make an N64 Metroid, but the offer was declined, supposedly because the developers <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not equal Super Metroid.|$|E

Hansa was dissatisfied with the group's demos and did not wish to release [...] "Killing an Arab". [...] The label suggested that the band attempt [...] cover versions instead. [...] They refused, and by March 1978 Easy Cure's contract with the label had been dissolved. Smith later recalled, [...] "We were very young.

500|$|While {{designing}} the Eisenhower Tunnel, controversies erupted {{over how to}} build the portions over Vail Pass and Glenwood Canyon. The route of US6 over Vail Pass has a distinctive [...] "V" [...] shape. Initially engineers <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> shorten the route of I-70 by about [...] by tunneling from Gore Creek to South Willow Creek, an alternative known as the Red Buffalo Tunnel. This alternative sparked a nationwide controversy as it would require an easement across federally protected lands, through {{what is now called}} the Eagles Nest Wilderness. After the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture refused to grant the easement, the engineers agreed to follow the existing route across Vail Pass. The engineers added infrastructure to accommodate wildlife, and had significant portions of the viaducts constructed offsite and lifted in place to minimize the environmental footprint. The grade over Vail Pass reaches seven percent.|$|E
