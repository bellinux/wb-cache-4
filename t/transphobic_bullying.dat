The program aims to reduce homophobic and <b>transphobic</b> <b>bullying</b> and discrimination in schools. Research work undertaken by ARCSHS into same-sex attracted and gender diverse youth has helped underpin the program. This program has created controversy. At a national symposium, Ward said, [...] "When people do complain then school leadership can very calmly and graciously say, 'You know what? We’re doing it anyway, tough luck'!

The Australian Christian Lobby (ACL) {{and others have}} criticised the program as [...] "radical sexual experimentation" [...] which [...] "exposed students to extreme material" [...] and asked for the withdrawal of $8 million allocated to the Australia-wide program. ACL says the program instructs students how to use facilities that match gender identities, how to have anal sex and how girls can bind their chests to change gender.|$|E

40|$|Academics in {{a variety}} of {{disciplines}} are calling attention to bullying motivated by homophobia in high schools. Building on these efforts, this thesis provides an in-depth analysis of focus groups and interviews with 16 lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, two-spirit, or queer (LGBTTQ) young people who recently left a British Columbia high school in which they believe they experienced homophobic or <b>transphobic</b> (HTP) <b>bullying.</b> The participants provide insight about the context of the bullying, the effects of those experiences, and discuss why they think HTP persists in high schools and how it can be addressed. Special attention is given to more positive experiences and outcomes. Drawing on Foucault and Bourdieu, the author argues for greater attention to less obvious, “gentle” forms of violence and suggests that school administrators take a more holistic approach to creating a positive environment for the LGBTTQ youth in their high schools...|$|R

5000|$|A {{legislative}} {{requirement for}} all schools to deliver LGBTI inclusive {{education in the}} lifetime of this parliament.

40|$|This chapter {{draws on}} {{findings}} from a European project, ‘Rights through alliances: Innovating and networking both within homes and schools’ (RAINBOW-HAS), conducted during 2013 – 2015. RAINBOW-HAS involved collaboration between six European Union countries to analyse {{and improve the}} rights of children, young people and their families experiencing bullying in relation to sexual and gender identities in educational settings (Arateko, 2015). We {{share some of the}} key findings emerging from a review of the education policy literature on homophobic and <b>transphobic</b> <b>bullying</b> in the UK, and then use this to foreground a practice example led by the English project team which developed and piloted a family and student led intervention within two secondary schools aimed at preventing homophobic and <b>transphobic</b> <b>bullying.</b> We reflect on the potential of such an intervention as a model for community engagement with secondary schools and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) young people and their families. Finally, we discuss the implications for social work where there is tendency for silence on LGBT issues more broadly and conclude with some suggestions for how social workers can be more active in their contribution to young people’s well-being in education through LGBT rights-based advocacy...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{draws on}} {{findings}} from a European project ‘Rights through alliances: Innovating and networking both within homes and schools’ (RAINBOW-HAS) conducted 2013 - 2015. It built collaboration between six European Union countries to analyse {{and improve the}} rights of children and youth regarding sexual orientation and gender identity in educational settings. The main focus of discussion derives from a secondary discourse analysis following thematic analyses of the qualitative interviews undertaken {{with a range of}} different families, schools and community associations across these European countries, which provide a snapshot of contemporary practice. We discuss the relative silence of social work in challenging homophobic and <b>transphobic</b> <b>bullying,</b> given their potential in promoting family and young people’s engagement...|$|E
40|$|This chapter uses {{material}} from qualitative research with LGBTQ+ {{young people to}} explore {{the ways in which}} heteronormativity, heterosexism and gender binarism are legitimated and perpetuated in sexualities education in school settings. The research suggests that LGBTQ+ young people experience oppression at two levels, in the content of sex and relationships education, which reproduces gender as binary and sexuality as primarily heterosexual and reproductive, and at the level of institutionalised heteronormativity, and homophobic and <b>transphobic</b> <b>bullying</b> and victimisation. Despite these restrictions, LGBTQ+ young people often develop critical knowledge that allows them to challenge heteronormativity and gender binarism, particularly when supported by other sources such as inclusive and holistic youth groups, peers and media. This leads us to argue that a critical pedagogies approach would enter into dialogue with young people’s critical capacities and knowledge in order to understand, challenge and ultimately transform heteronormativity and gender binarism in both SRE content, and schools as institutions...|$|E
