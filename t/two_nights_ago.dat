6000|$|... "Before I go, Mademoiselle," [...] I pursued, looking {{straight}} before me as I spoke, and dimly conscious that her glance was bent upon my face--"before I go, I fain would {{thank you for}} all that you have done for me here.

60|$|At length, grown {{weary and}} {{uncertain}} of my way, I sank down {{to rest and}} think. And my thoughts were chiefly of that hermit somewhere above me in these hills, and of the blessedness of such a life, remote from the world that man had made so evil. And then, with thinking of the world, came thoughts of Giuliana. <b>Two</b> <b>nights</b> <b>ago</b> I had held her in my arms. <b>Two</b> <b>nights</b> <b>ago!</b> And already it seemed a century remote--as remote as {{all the rest of}} that life of which it seemed a part.

60|$|She {{looked up}} the fawn of the red doe they had killed <b>two</b> <b>nights</b> <b>ago,</b> and found it. But it was lonely hunting without Andoo, and she {{returned}} caveward before dawn. The sky was grey and overcast, the trees up the gorge were black and unfamiliar, and into her ursine mind came a dim sense of strange and dreary happenings. She lifted up her voice and called Andoo by name. The sides of the gorge re-echoed her.|$|E
