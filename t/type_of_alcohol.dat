500|$|Dwarves {{need to be}} {{provided}} with food and drink (mostly {{in the form of}} alcohol). A dwarf will get negative thoughts for drinking plain water and even for drinking the same <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohol,</b> making it necessary to grow different crops for producing different drinks. Things like not having a separate bedroom can upset a dwarf. They may make friends and sometimes marry; females give birth. Dwarves can get upset by sustaining injuries, having poor clothing, losing their pets, friends or relatives; interacting with or seeing their corpses can aggravate this. A frustrated dwarf may break furniture or attack others. Continuous stress will cause them to throw tantrums and eventually go insane, whether going [...] and attacking their comrades in a homicidal rage, becoming suicidally depressed and jumping off a cliff, or simply going [...] "stark raving mad" [...] and stumbling around randomly until their untimely death. Their quality of life can be improved by giving them luxurious personal bedrooms and a well-decorated dining room, medical care, and providing them with a variety of drinks and well-cooked meals. A chain reaction where a single dwarf's unhappiness causes the entire fortress's population to start throwing tantrums can begin when one dwarf throws a tantrum, attacks and kills another one with many friends, which drastically affects the happiness of many more.|$|E

2500|$|Alcohol {{intoxication}} {{has been}} shown to be directly connected to the actions of GIRK channels. [...] GIRK channels have a hydrophobic pocket that is capable of binding ethanol, the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> found in alcoholic beverages. When ethanol acts as an agonist, GIRK channels in the brain experience prolonged opening. [...] This causes decreased neuronal activity, the result of which manifests as the symptoms of alcohol intoxication. [...] The discovery of the hydrophobic pocket capable of binding ethanol is significant in the field of clinical pharmacology. [...] Agents that can act as agonists to this binding site can be potentially useful in the creation of drugs for the treatment of neurological disorders such as epilepsy in which neuronal firing exceeds normal levels.|$|E

Biodiesel production was performed by transesterification using 0. 58 % sodium hydroxide (NaOH) as a basic catalyst at 60 °C and 20 min of reaction time. The yield of biodiesel produced in each experiment was separated from glycerol and determined. Equal ratio of the biodiesel and the glycerol obtained from each experimental run was vigorously re-mixed and subsequently, the settling behaviour of glycerol was observed. The settling time reduces significantly with increasing alcohol concentration. When a mixture <b>of</b> two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohols</b> is used, synergetic effect <b>of</b> the mixed <b>alcohols</b> reduces the settling time of glycerol...|$|R
