40|$|PhDThis {{thesis is}} about the silver {{business}} of Matthew Boulton and John Fothergill at their Soho Manufactory near Birmingham. Their partnership lasted from 1762 until 1782. A rounded discussion of the topic is attempted. Within the contexts of industry elsewhere and Soho's other activities, successive chapters cover the early development, marketing, production, design, and later decline of the partners' silver. Silver plate was prestigious and, untypically for Boulton, he concentrated on sales to the public rather than trade customers. To attract orders he made modest charges. This was viable where mainly machinery was used to make plate, even though sales were not high, since the expense of machinery was substantially covered by the larger sales of non-silver items. However, where Boulton relied {{to a greater degree}} upon hand methods, he lacked technical means to compensate for low profit-margins. Moreover, inefficiency and the firm's lack of capital which led to substantial bankers' interest charges on payment for bullion, particularly when customers paid late, caused losses. These problems applied particularly <b>to</b> <b>silver</b> <b>plate</b> and were mainly responsible for the decision to reduce production drastically; however, the manufacture of a large range of small items remained relatively consistent. The thesis includes appendices. Some contain new information about annual totals for the following aspects of the business: the volume of assay silver; each type of article; pieces sold on commission; and sterling silver supplies. Other appendices provide details about the partners' silversmiths and extracts from a Soho inventory. This thesis involves a more detailed use of sources than previous studies of the topic. Apart from the silver itself (which is selectively illustrated), the Matthew Boulton Papers and statistics derived from The Birmingham Assay office provide the main sources. Manuscripts covering silver production elsewhere provide contextual material for understanding the partners' silver business...|$|E

The second was a costly shrine that according to Snorre Sturlasson was made by King Magnus Olavsson (1035-1047), Olav’s son. This shrine was probably a wooden coffin covered by <b>silver</b> <b>plates</b> with religious motives. <b>To</b> the <b>silver</b> <b>plates</b> were fixed valuable jewels.

5000|$|Britannia silver has a millesimal {{fineness}} of {{at least}} 958. The alloy is 95.84% pure silver and 4.16 per cent copper or other metals. The Britannia standard was developed in Britain in 1697 to help prevent British sterling silver coins from being melted <b>to</b> make <b>silver</b> <b>plate.</b> It was obligatory in Britain between 1697 and 1720, when the sterling silver standard was restored. It became an optional standard thereafter.|$|R
50|$|The Curtisville {{area was}} one of the first parts of Glastonbury to be settled by English colonists, who had been using its riverfront meadows since the 17th century. Early land use in the area divided the area into narrow strips {{fronting}} on the river, with houses located on the terrace facing what is now Main Street. Salmon Brook was recognized as a source of water power in the colonial period, but its industrial development did not begin until the 1840s, when Oswin Welles began the manufacture of wooden wares and cigars. Brothers Frederick and Joseph Curtis established a major <b>silver</b> <b>plating</b> factory on the south bank of the brook around that time. Their endeavour was underfinanced and failed around 1860. The property was taken over by Thomas Vail, who manufactured rifles and single-shot pistols during the American Civil War. The property returned <b>to</b> <b>silver</b> <b>plating</b> when his business failed after the war ended. Tobacco continued to be a mainstay of agriculture in the area, and there was regular ferry and barge service at a wharf at the end of Pratt Street.|$|R

50|$|There are {{combinations}} {{of glass and}} iron-nickel-cobalt alloys (Kovar) where even the non-linearity of the thermal expansion is matched. These alloys can be directly sealed to glass, but then the oxidation is critical. Also, their low electrical conductivity is a disadvantage. Thus, they are often gold plated. It is also possible <b>to</b> use <b>silver</b> <b>plating,</b> but then an additional gold layer is necessary as an oxygen diffusion barrier to prevent the formation of iron oxide.|$|R

Through the chelating effect, {{it can be}} directly used <b>to</b> eletroless <b>silver</b> <b>plating</b> without roughening, sensitization and activation. The molecule structure, morphology and thermal stability were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and therm-gravimetric (TG) analysis. In addition, electrical conductivity, and washing performance were also tested respectively. The results indicated that silver-coated PAN fiber based on APTES/MPTES modification had high conductivity with a compact and homogeneous silver layer, as well as good washing fastness performance...|$|R
5000|$|A stamp {{indicating}} {{the purity of}} the silver is called the assayer's mark. The mark for silver meeting the sterling standard of purity is the Lion Passant, but there have been other variations over the years, most notably the mark indicating Britannia purity. The Britannia standard was obligatory in Britain between 1697 and 1720 to try to help prevent British sterling silver coins from being melted <b>to</b> make <b>silver</b> <b>plate.</b> It became an optional standard thereafter, and in the United Kingdom and Ireland is now denoted by the millesimal fineness hallmark [...] "958", with the symbol of Britannia being applied optionally. The purity mark for Irish silver is the harp crowned.|$|R
50|$|Cornelius {{was born}} in Philadelphia to Sarah Cornelius (born Soder) and Christian Cornelius. His father had immigrated from Amsterdam in 1783 {{and worked as a}} {{silversmith}} before opening a lamp manufacturing company. Robert Cornelius attended private school as a youth, taking a particular interest in chemistry. In 1831, he began working for his father, specializing in <b>silver</b> <b>plating</b> and metal polishing. He became so well renowned for his work that shortly after the daguerrotype was invented, Cornelius was approached by Joseph Saxton <b>to</b> create a <b>silver</b> <b>plate</b> for his daguerreotype of Central High School in Philadelphia. It was this meeting that sparked Cornelius's interest in photography.|$|R

In December 1675 Berkeley was appointed, with Sir William Temple and Sir Leoline Jenkyns, ambassador extraordinary on the part of England at the Congress of Nijmegen then about to assemble, but bad health both delayed his departure for Nijmegen, which he finally reached in November 1676, and caused him to return the following May, before the conference finished.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Electrodeposited silver layers {{obtained}} from high-cyanide <b>silver</b> <b>plating</b> solution are widely applied for connectors and switches of automobiles. However, few groups {{have discussed the}} relationship between the crystal structure of silver layers and their properties. In this study, the effect of the concentration of Se, added as a brightener <b>to</b> high-cyanide <b>silver</b> <b>plating</b> solution, was investigated by XRD and EBSD analysis for electrodeposited silver layers with { 200 } orientation. By optimizing the concentration of Se in the <b>silver</b> <b>plating</b> solution, the { 200 } orientation ratio of the silver layer was increased to as high as 94 %. Since the diffusion of Cu from the Cu substrate used in this study into the silver layer was inhibited, the silver layer with the high { 200 } orientation ratio exhibited good electrical contact resistance of the surface of 1. 3 mΩ after a heating test performed at 200 °C for 74 h. In addition, the silver layer had good bend formability. The results of XRD analysis confirmed that the recrystallization of the electrodeposited silver layer occurred at room temperature within several hours, thus increasing the { 200 } orientation ratio of the silver layer. Introduction Electrodeposited silver layers have outstanding properties, such as the highest reported electrical conductivity, good electrical contact resistance of the surface, good solderabilit...|$|R
50|$|Elkington {{was born}} in Birmingham, {{the son of a}} {{spectacle}} manufacturer. Apprenticed <b>to</b> his uncles' <b>silver</b> <b>plating</b> business in 1815, he became, on their death, sole proprietor of the business, but subsequently took his cousin, Henry Elkington, into partnership. The science of electrometallurgy was then in its infancy, but the Elkingtons were quick to recognize its possibilities. They had already taken out certain patents for the application of electricity to metals when, in 1840, John Wright, a Birmingham surgeon, discovered the valuable properties of a solution of cyanide of silver in potassium cyanide for electroplating purposes. The Elkingtons purchased and patented Wright's process (British Patent 8447 : Improvements in Coating, Covering, or Plating certain Metals), subsequently acquiring the rights of other processes and improvements. In 1843 Elkingtons acquired the rights to Werner von Siemens's first invention, an improvement to the gold and <b>silver</b> <b>plating</b> process.|$|R
5|$|During the 1740s, {{a form of}} the {{crucible}} steel process was discovered that allowed the manufacture of {{a better quality of}} steel than had previously been possible. In about the same period, a technique was developed for fusing a thin sheet of silver onto a copper ingot <b>to</b> produce <b>silver</b> <b>plating,</b> which became widely known as Sheffield plate. These innovations spurred Sheffield's growth as an industrial town, but the loss of some important export markets led to a recession in the late 18th and early 19thcentury. The resulting poor conditions culminated in a cholera epidemic that killed 402people in 1832. The population of the town grew rapidly throughout the 19thcentury; increasing from 60,095 in 1801 to 451,195 by 1901. The town was incorporated as a borough in 1842 and was granted a city charter in 1893. The influx of people also led to demand for better water supplies, and a number of new reservoirs were constructed {{on the outskirts of the}} town.|$|R
50|$|The king {{set up his}} {{standard}} at Nottingham on 23 August. A declaration of non-resistance by Shrewsbury council on 30 August gave the initiative in the county to the royalists. Encouraged by Ottley, the king led his army south westwards across the Midlands and occupied Shrewsbury on 20 September. The royalist field army remained at Shrewsbury until 12 October, confronted by the parliamentary army, under the Lord General Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex, based at Worcester. The king was initially welcomed, although the population had little choice {{in the face of}} overwhelming force. However, the behaviour of the royalists began to damage their own cause. The troops were ill-paid or unpaid and took to looting, both in the towns and the north Shropshire countryside, even though the king opened a mint at Shrewsbury <b>to</b> turn <b>silver</b> <b>plate</b> into coin. The king issued proscription lists, covering the local parliamentary and Puritan leadership, and this continued under Ottley, who commanded the garrison after the field army departed. Corbet and his associates were effectively excluded from their native county.|$|R

Unused to physical work, he is soon exhausted from his digging, and is visited by a formidable lady who believes {{him to be a}} drunkard. Affecting a Somersetshire accent, the Duke enjoys the deception. The lady sends her daughter to try to reform him. The house is later surrounded by other neighbours and police who have mistaken him for a thief believed <b>to</b> have burgled <b>silver</b> <b>plate</b> from a nearby manor house. The Duke takes to his heels, pursued by the local Chief Constable and others, but evades them. He returns home, accompanied by the lady, and resumes his true identity, much to her amusement.|$|R
40|$|Aspect {{ratios of}} gold {{nanorods}} have been finely modified in reduction-limited conditions via two electrochemical ways: {{by changing the}} amount of a growth solution containing small gold clusters {{in the presence of}} already prepared gold nanorods as seeds or by changing electrolysis time in {{the presence or absence of}} a <b>silver</b> <b>plate.</b> While the atomic molar ratio of gold in the growth solution to gold in the seed solution is critical in the former method, the relative molar ratio of gold ions <b>to</b> <b>silver</b> ions in the electrolytic solution is important in the latter way for the control of the aspect ratios of gold nanorods. The aspect ratios of gold nanorods decrease with an increase of electrolysis time in the absence of a <b>silver</b> <b>plate,</b> but they increase with an increase of electrolysis time in the presence of a <b>silver</b> <b>plate...</b>|$|R
3000|$|During the Ag plating step, {{simultaneously}} to {{the proliferation of}} the silver microstructures, there is a production of dihydrogen at the silver/HF electrolyte solution interface. The H 2 production is accompanied by injection of holes to the silicon via the catalyst. On the other hand, each reduction of silver ions induces an excess of holes. These holes are injected into the valence band of silicon which oxidizes and then dissolves into silicon hexafluoride ions (SiF 62 -) in the hydrofluoric acid aqueous solution. Throughout the dissolution process, Ag particles sink below towards the bulk silicon, creating irregular porous conic grooves roofed with Ag microstructures[15]. This synchronized mechanism of Ag+ reduction and silicon dissolution is illustrated in Figure  5 and labeled as step 1 corresponding <b>to</b> the <b>silver</b> <b>plating</b> process. The silicon dissolution process is likely to follow a microelectrochemical mechanism where the current flux is provided mainly by continuous silver ion reduction. Thus, the silver particles {{play the role of}} the cathode. Yet, silicon underneath the silver particle plays the role of the anode. The electrochemical redox reaction can be formulated as half-cell reactions (1), (2), and (3)[12, 13, 24, 26, 33, 34]: [...]...|$|R

These helmets were {{modelled}} on the helmets of the Sapeurs-pompiers which Captain Sir Eyre Massey Shaw had seen on a visit to Paris and introduced to the Metropolitan Fire Brigade in London in 1868, replacing a black leather helmet. The design was widely copied by other British and British Empire fire services.

The Earl, Jones reasoned, could be {{exchanged}} for American sailors impressed into the Royal Navy. The Earl was discovered to be absent from his estate, so his wife entertained the officers and conducted negotiations. Canadian historian Peter C. Newman gives credit to the governess for protecting the young heir and to the butler for filling a sack half with coal, and topping {{it up with the}} family <b>silver,</b> in order <b>to</b> fob off the Americans. Jones claimed that he intended to return directly to his ship and continue seeking prizes elsewhere, but his crew wished to [...] "pillage, burn, and plunder all they could". Ultimately, Jones allowed the crew <b>to</b> seize a <b>silver</b> <b>plate</b> set adorned with the family's emblem to placate their desires, but nothing else. Jones bought the plate himself when it was later sold off in France, and returned it to the Earl of Selkirk after the war.|$|R
