The SM-62 {{was a significant}} forerunner of cruise missiles developed many years later. The Wing received its first Snark training missile (e.g., an N-25 research vehicle) in late May 1952, and the 6556th Guided Missile Squadron activated a Snark cadre at AFMTC on 16 June. The squadron conducted 97 test launches at the Cape beginning on 29 August 1952 through 5 December 1960 from LC-1, LC-2 and LC-4 for the Snark Employment and Suitability <b>Test</b> (<b>E</b> and ST) program. There were several mishaps during the test program—though they were valuable learning experiences—caused some to label Florida’s coast as [...] "Snark infested waters." [...] On 27 June 1958, Strategic Air Command's (SAC) 556th Strategic Missile Squadron launched its first Snark (an N-69E) {{under the supervision of}} the 6555th GMS from LC-2.

40|$|The present paper gives a {{technical}} review of fracture toughness testing, evaluation and standardization for metallic materials {{in terms of}} the linear elastic fracture mechanics as well as the elastic–plastic fracture mechanics. This includes the early investigations and recent advances of fracture toughness test methods and practices developed by American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM). The review describes the most important fracture mechanics parameters: the elastic energy release rate G, the stress intensity factor K, the Jintegral, the crack-tip opening displacement (CTOD) and the crack-tip opening angle (CTOA) from the basic concept, definition, to experimental estimation, test methods and ASTM standardizing practices. Attention is paid to guidelines on how to choose an appropriate fracture parameter to characterize fracture toughness for the material of interest, and how to measure the fracture toughness value defined either at a critical point or in a resistance curve format using laboratory specimens. The relevant ASTM fracture toughness test standards considered in this paper are E 399 for KIc <b>testing,</b> <b>E</b> 561 for K–R curve <b>testing,</b> <b>E</b> 813 for JIc <b>testing,</b> <b>E</b> 1152 for J–R curve <b>testing,</b> <b>E</b> 1737 for JIc and J–R curve <b>testing,</b> <b>E</b> 1290 for CTOD (δ) testing, a combined common <b>test</b> standard <b>E</b> 1820 for measuring the three parameters of K, J and δ, E 1921 for the transition reference temperature T 0 testing and the master curve of cleavage toughness KJc <b>testing,</b> and <b>E</b> 2472 for CTOA testing.

40|$|Abstract Effects {{of depth}} of {{encoding}} on form-specific memory were examined. After viewing words (e. g., “bear”) presented centrally during initial encoding, par-ticipants completed word stems (e. g., “BEA”) presented laterally and pattern masked during subsequent test. When the encoding task was perceptual, letter-case specific memory was not observed, unlike in previous experiments without pattern masking. However, when the encoding task required both perceptual and con-ceptual processing, letter-case specific memory {{was observed in}} direct right-hemisphere, but not in direct left-hemisphere, test presentations, like in previous studies without pattern masking. Results were not influ-enced by whether stems were completed to form the first words {{that came to mind}} or words explicitly retrieved from encoding. Depth of encoding may influ-ence form-specific memory through interactive process-ing of visual and postvisual information. An important aspect of repetition priming is that it can be form specific under some conditions.
