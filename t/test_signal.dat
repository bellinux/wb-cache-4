30|$|The {{procedure}} {{also does}} not guarantee to find <b>test</b> <b>signals</b> for every given system, because it cannot automatically derive <b>test</b> <b>signals</b> from system specifications, meaning that the equations for signal synthesis have to be invented by the test designer.|$|R

As with the previous satellites, these are leased services under the FAA's Geostationary Satellite Communications Control Segment contract with Lockheed Martin for WAAS geostationary satellite leased services, who is contracted to provide up to three satellites through the year 2016. A third satellite was later added to the system. From March to November 2010, the FAA broadcast a WAAS <b>test</b> <b>signal</b> on a leased transponder on the Inmarsat-4 F3 satellite.

40|$|Abstract. For {{multi-channel}} process, due to {{disadvantages of}} the open-loop single variable step method, multi-channel test method is used. That means {{all of the}} channels are tested at the same time. In order to eliminate cross-effect of the different <b>test</b> <b>signals,</b> it requires that all the <b>test</b> <b>signals</b> are uncorrelated. Several <b>test</b> <b>signals</b> are introduced and analyzed. Based on two familiar identifi-cation methods: correlation analysis method and least-squares method, we put our strength {{on the way to}} get uncorrelated <b>test</b> <b>signals.</b> A novel design for the period length of uncorrelated pseudo random binary sequence (PRBS) is pro-posed. Use this design method, identifiable PRBS signals can be gained and their periods are the shortest. Simulation results show the effectiveness. ...|$|R
30|$|The {{application}} range of synthesized <b>test</b> <b>signals</b> is in general {{limited to the}} one system the stimuli have been targeted at, because the procedure {{does not address the}} effect of implementation changes in the system under test on the measurement results obtained with the synthetic stimuli. This means that the validity of <b>test</b> <b>signals</b> has to be re-assessed on product improvements affecting {{one or more of the}} subsystems that contribute to the processing of the <b>test</b> <b>signals</b> in the system under test.|$|R
30|$|Measuring system {{responses}} with <b>test</b> <b>signals</b> is {{a typical}} problem of system identification and has been solved with measurement techniques based on <b>test</b> <b>signals</b> that meet some typical requirements regarding their power spectrum and their amplitude distribution. Particularly, the minimization of peaks has been of interest {{with regard to the}} fact that practical systems have a limited dynamic range. However, the synthesis of <b>test</b> <b>signals</b> that allow enforcing a signal feature like modulation has only recently been proposed [4, 5].|$|R
50|$|In a {{telecommunications}} system, a transmission-level point (TLP) {{is a test}} point or interface, i.e. a physical point in an electronic circuit where a <b>test</b> <b>signal</b> may be inserted or measured, and for which the nominal power of the <b>test</b> <b>signal</b> is specified.|$|E
50|$|Since {{the early}} 1990s various {{writers such as}} Julian Dunn have {{suggested}} that dynamic range be measured {{in the presence of}} a low-level <b>test</b> <b>signal.</b> Thus, any spurious signals caused by the <b>test</b> <b>signal</b> or distortion will not degrade the signal-to-noise ratio. This also addresses concerns about muting circuits.|$|E

40|$|Hearing {{instrument}} development {{involves the}} acoustic veri-fication of system functionality. The used <b>test</b> <b>signals</b> should allow efficient repetition of tests.

30|$|Furthermore, the {{synthesis}} of <b>test</b> <b>signals</b> {{is dependent on the}} design. For example, if crossover frequencies of the demonstrated noise reduction subsystem would change in the course of product innovation, then <b>test</b> <b>signals</b> would need to be re-synthesized, based on the new set of crossover frequencies.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{increasing}} role of exhaustive testing {{techniques in}} VLSI has prompted {{a number of}} investigations into methods for achieving locally exhaustive testing {{of the components of}} a large digital circuit using a comparatively small number of <b>test</b> <b>signals.</b> This paper examines the possibility of introducing linear sums of the <b>test</b> <b>signals</b> into this <b>testing</b> process. It is shown that {{with the addition of a}} relatively small amount of additional circuitry, significant reductions in the number of required <b>test</b> <b>signals</b> (and <b>tests)</b> can often be achieved. In particular, it is shown that for any specific combinational circuit the number of required <b>test</b> <b>signals</b> can be made to be independent of the number of inputs and to depend only logarithmically on the number of outputs. The role of these linear sums in the generation of universal test sets is also discussed...|$|R
50|$|A {{vertical}} interval <b>test</b> <b>signal</b> inserter, or VITS inserter inserts test patterns into the {{vertical interval}} {{of a television}} signal. Unlike <b>test</b> <b>signal</b> generators; a VITS inserter is used to insert the <b>test</b> <b>signal</b> into live programming, so that inline measurements of a transmission chain can be made while the chain is operational. (As the vertical interval is typically not visible on end-user televisions, {{this can be done}} without producing any artifacts noticeable to viewers). Since VITS signals can often be transmitted, it is also possible for a television station to receive its own on-air feed, and use the VITS to detect and troubleshoot problems in on-air transmission.|$|E
50|$|For example, {{assume a}} device with an input-referred third-order {{intercept}} point of 10 dBm is driven with a <b>test</b> <b>signal</b> of −5 dBm. This power is 15 dB below the intercept point, therefore nonlinear products will appear at approximately 2×15 dB below the <b>test</b> <b>signal</b> {{power at the}} device output (in other words, 3×15 dB below the output-referred third-order intercept point).|$|E
