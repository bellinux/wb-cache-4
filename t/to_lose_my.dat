500|$|They {{made their}} {{television}} debut on Later... with Jools Holland on 30 May 2008, playing [...] "Unfinished Business" [...] and [...] "Death". This marked their final public performance prior to recording their debut album, scheduling sessions in ICP Studios in Belgium and Kore Studios in West London. The album was provisionally titled <b>To</b> <b>Lose</b> <b>My</b> Life or Lose My Love, with a scheduled release date {{was set for}} January 2009. The title came from {{a line in the}} album's title track, [...] "To Lose My Life". During the summer of 2008, the band played numerous UK and overseas music festivals, including major festivals Oxegen, T in the Park, and the Reading and Leeds Festivals. Beginning in September 2008, the band played their first headline tour, performing thirteen dates in the United Kingdom. The tour marked the release of [...] "Death" [...] on 22 September 2008, with a further six dates played in the United States in October 2008. The tour included an appearance at the CMJ Music Festival in New York on 23–24 October, alongside Jay Reatard, Amazing Baby and Violens. Following this, the band returned to support Glasvegas on their fifteen date UK tour in November and December 2008. NME.com exclusively announced their debut album would be released on 12 January 2009, with shortened title <b>To</b> <b>Lose</b> <b>My</b> Life.... The band preceded the album with the single release of [...] "To Lose My Life" [...] one week earlier. The full-length video for [...] "To Lose My Life" [...] premiered exclusively on the band's MySpace on 21 November 2008.|$|E
500|$|Ranaut {{lives in}} Mumbai {{with her sister}} Rangoli, who {{was the victim of}} an acid attack in 2006. She makes yearly visits to her {{hometown}} of Bhambla. A practicing Hindu, Ranaut follows the teachings of the spiritual leader Swami Vivekananda and considers meditation to be [...] "the highest form of worshipping God". She practices vegetarianism and was listed as [...] "India's hottest vegetarian" [...] in a poll conducted by PETA in 2013. Since 2009 Ranaut has been studying the dance form of kathak from the Nateshwar Nritya Kala Mandir. She has said that the technical process of filmmaking is of tremendous interest to her, and to better her understanding of it Ranaut enrolled in a two-month screenplay writing course at the New York Film Academy in 2014. In an interview with Filmfare she said that despite her stardom, she wants to lead a normal life: [...] "I don't want <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>my</b> rights as a common person to learn and grow".|$|E
500|$|The most {{important}} casting decision {{was that of}} the host, the only human character in the show. The host's role was to empower and challenge the show's young viewers, to help increase their self-esteem, and to strongly connect with them through the television screen. The producers originally wanted a female host, but after months of research and over 1,000 auditions, they hired actor/performer Steve Burns based on the strength of his audition. Burns received the strongest and most enthusiastic response in tests with preschoolers. Johnson said that what made Burns a great children's TV host was that [...] "he didn't want to be a children's host... He loved kids, but he didn't want to make a career out of it." [...] Burns remained on Blue's Clues for seven years and was in over 100 episodes before he left. Burns himself stated, [...] "I knew I wasn't gonna be doing children's television all my life, mostly because I refused <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>my</b> hair on a kid's TV show, and it was happenin'—fast." ...|$|E

500|$|Discussing Cordelia's {{relationship}} with Xander, Carpenter says, [...] "A lot of Cordy's conflict, {{and a lot}} of who she is, comes out around Xander. Because she is in love with him in spite of herself, or in spite of him. I have my best moments with [...]" [...] However, her character's growing involvement with Buffy and her friends caused the actress some concern; [...] "I wasn't sure how I felt about it, because I didn't want <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>my</b> edge. I didn't want her to be nice; I didn't want her to change because that's who she is." [...] Carpenter's challenge was to find a balance between the good and bad sides of Cordelia, and she explains, [...] "That's why I enjoy playing her so much. She's got to be somewhat tolerable or why would they hang out with her? But I [...] not to lose her edge, her honesty." [...] Carpenter claims that Cordelia's [...] "rough edges" [...] made for difficult experiences with fans, who expected her to be snobby like her character. Charisma continually pleaded to get to slay a vampire, which the writers let her do in her final Buffy appearance, [...] "Graduation Day, Part Two".|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with the BBC's Newsbeat programme, McVeigh stated that {{due to the nature of}} the band's songwriting techniques clashing with their difficult touring schedules, there will be no new White Lies material until 2010. Despite this, McVeigh has mentioned that the ambitious recording of [...] "Nothing to Give" [...] and [...] "The Price of Love" [...] (from <b>To</b> <b>Lose</b> <b>My</b> Life...) act as a taster of the different sound to come on their sophomore release. In September 2009, the band released [...] "Taxidermy" [...] as a digital download through iTunes for the first time. A live favourite amongst fans, the track had previously only been released on the (now deleted) vinyl release of [...] "To Lose My Life". During the same month, the band supported Kings of Leon's tour of the United States, and Coldplay's tour of the United Kingdom. As well as this, the band played their own headline tour across Europe during October—November 2009, including some of their biggest shows to date in the UK. A number of the tour dates were later cancelled, due to McVeigh falling ill during their concert in Munich, Germany. Having fully recovered in time for the beginning of their UK dates, the tour continued as normal, with cancelled dates being rescheduled for February 2010.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{the release}} of <b>To</b> <b>Lose</b> <b>My</b> Life, White Lies became the first British act in 2009 to achieve a number one album, and the first album to debut at number one. After {{charting}} high in the midweek sales, the album beat off competition from Lady Gaga, The Script and Kings of Leon. In support of the release, the band played on Channel 4's Shockwaves Album Chart Show, Last Call with Carson Daly and the Late Show with David Letterman, the latter being the band's first performance on US television. Following supporting Snow Patrol on their tour of both Ireland and the United Kingdom, the band embarked on their own headline world tour, playing sold out dates across Europe, North America, Japan and the United Kingdom. While in North America, the band co-headlined the NME Presents tour with Friendly Fires. The bands were supported by The Soft Pack, with White Lies headlining seven of the fifteen dates, including their first appearance at the South by Southwest festival. During the tour, the band were forced to play a shortened, six song set at New York's Bowery Ballroom, due to McVeigh having throat problems. During summer 2009, the band played {{a number of major}} UK and overseas music festivals, including Rock Werchter, Benicàssim, Coachella, Glastonbury, Isle of Wight, Lollapalooza, Oxegen, Radio 1's Big Weekend, Reading and Leeds, Roskilde and T in the Park. [...] "Death" [...] was re-released on 29 June 2009. To mark the release, live performances from a selection of the band's festival appearances were broadcast online through the band's web player, titled [...] "The Summer of Death".|$|E
5000|$|In 1985, R.E.M. {{traveled}} to England to record its third album Fables of the Reconstruction, a difficult process {{that brought the}} band to {{the verge of a}} break up. After the album was released, relationships in the band remained tense. Gaining weight and acting eccentrically (such as by shaving his hair into a monk's tonsure), Stipe later said of the period, [...] "I was well on <b>my</b> way <b>to</b> <b>losing</b> <b>my</b> mind". They toured in Canada and throughout Europe that year; Stipe had bleached his hair blond during this time.|$|R

500|$|... "AFRICOBRA II" [...] {{was held}} in 1971 at the Studio Museum in Harlem before it {{traveled}} to five other museums and galleries. Jarrell exhibited Revolutionary and Black Prince (both 1971) at the show. These two portraits are described by art historian Robert Douglas as displaying [...] "Jarrell's masterful understanding of portraiture, rendered through a chiaroscuro technique employing a multitude of meticulously painted B's in different sizes and coolade hues." [...] Revolutionary is a homage to Angela Davis. She wears a Revolutionary Suit that was designed by Jae Jarrell for the AFRICOBRA II exhibition. Prints were made of the work. However, in the original, the cartridge belt {{is attached to the}} canvas, an idea of Jae's. The words [...] "love", [...] "black", [...] "nation", [...] "time", [...] "rest", [...] "full of shit", [...] "revolution", and [...] "beautiful" [...] burst out of her head on the canvas. The message [...] "I have given my life in the struggle. If I have <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>my</b> life, that is the way it will be," [...] travels down her chest and left arm. [...] "B", as usual, represents [...] "blackness" [...] "bad" [...] and in this painting [...] "beautiful". The work epitomizes the goal by AFRICOBRA artists to use all space possible in their creations, described as [...] "jam-packed and jelly tight." [...] Revolutionary was reviewed by Nancy Tobin Willig as [...] "a portrait of a young black woman screaming slogans – with a bandoleer loaded with real bullets slung over her shoulder. Jarrell's painting is an overstatement. It is not art as the weapon. It is the weapon as art." [...] Black Prince is Jarrell's second tribute to Malcolm X. [...] "B" [...] appears in the painting, as well as [...] "P"; [...] "PRINCE" [...] and [...] "BLACK" [...] which travel throughout Malcolm's face and hand. The quote [...] "I believe in anything necessary to correct unjust conditions, political, economic, social, physical. Anything necessary as long as it gets results," [...] is painted across his chest and arm. Their second show, [...] "AFRICOBRA III", opened in 1973. Critics were more aware of the aesthetic and movement at this show; critic Paul Richard commented that the works of Nelson Stevens, Jeff Donaldson and Jarrell [...] "together contradict something I have long believed: that art that is so blatantly political is not art at all." ...|$|E
2500|$|Having {{signed the}} {{contract}} {{for a new}} opera, Bellini began to look around for a suitable subject and, {{in a letter to}} Florimo of 11 March 1834, he alludes to the opera which was to become I puritani, noting: [...] "I am about <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>my</b> mind over the plot of the opera for Paris, as it has been impossible to find a suitable subject for my purpose and adaptable to the company".|$|E

"Happily, Jeanne," [...] Harry replied coolly, [...] "your dying {{would in}} no respect benefit him; and as {{your life is}} in my eyes of a {{thousand}} times more consequence {{than that of the}} king, and as your chances of safety to some extent depend upon mine, I do not mean to risk one of those chances {{for the sake of his}} majesty. Besides, to tell you the truth, I have a good deal of liking for my own life, and have a marked objection <b>to</b> <b>losing</b> <b>my</b> head. You see I have people at home who are fond of me, and who want to see me back again with that head on my shoulders." ...|$|R
50|$|Ultimately, it was Viinberg’s {{parents who}} {{introduced}} her to rowing. “They helped me discover rowing after seeing all the rowers train every morning on Wascana Lake when they drove to work.

2500|$|The New York Times Patrick Healy {{stated in}} February 2011 that Spider-Man had become [...] "a {{national}} object {{of pop culture}} fascination—more so, perhaps, than any show in Broadway history" [...] due to media coverage and late-night comedians' monologues on the musical's many delays, injuries, and creative issues. He speculated that the musical would not have staying power through repeat viewings like other hit musicals, after [...] "tourists and parents with children" [...] watched it for [...] "bragging rights at dinner parties or on the playground". The New York Post columnist Michael Riedel opined that month that the musical would be short-lived: [...] "Depending on how much more money its backers are willing <b>to</b> <b>lose,</b> <b>my</b> hunch is that 'Spider-Man' will stagger through the spring, pick up with the tourist traffic {{in the summer and}} then collapse in the fall. It should be gone by September [...]" ...|$|E
2500|$|Huma Mian, a 2004 {{graduate}} of the University of Colorado Boulder in Boulder, Colorado, majored in accounting. Mian {{was born in the}} United States to Pakistani-born parents. Huma Mian and her parents and siblings had lived in Qatar and Colorado. At the time of Shahzad's arrest, Mian lived with her parents and her two children fathered by Shahzad in Saudi Arabia. Mian's father is Mohammad Asif Mian, a petroleum engineering expert. He has written a number of books and technical manuals, including a best-selling book on project economics and decision analysis; worked for companies such as Saudi Aramco and Qatar General Petroleum; and has two master's degrees from the Colorado School of Mines in Golden, Colorado. After Shahzad was arrested, his father-in-law Mohammad Asif Mian said: [...] "to go to this extreme, this is unbelievable. He has lovely children. Two really lovely children.

2500|$|After Jang's death, it was belatedly {{revealed}} {{that she had}} been secretly married. She had wed her husband, Kim Young-kyun, while in the U.S. for cancer treatment, and registered the marriage to make it official in Korea just days before her death. Kim later published a book commemorating the 608 days of their relationship, called My Last Gift To Her. The book features previously unreleased photos (including that of their Las Vegas wedding), {{as well as some of}} the letters and text messages they'd exchanged. When asked in an interview why he wrote the book, Kim answered: [...] "Right now, my memories of Jin-young are distinct, but I'm human and someday my memories will grow dimmer. I don't want <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>my</b> memories of being with her. Writing this was my way to deal with that. Someone who writes for a living told me that it helps and is a good method for organizing their emotions, and those words motivated me to write the book. Also, as I've already said in the prologue, Jin-young was an actress who had a great future ahead of her, and I thought it would help in having her remembered beautifully. Even when her time was limited, she didn't give up hope and lived diligently, and I wanted to let people know of Jin-young's passionate life." ...|$|E

Seven years on I don’t feel a gap in my life and I suppose that’s the proof of the pudding isn’t it?

2500|$|White Lies' first {{release was}} a short {{extended}} play, titled [...] "Unfinished Business". The release contained only two tracks and was limited to only 500 copies. They made their television debut on Later... with Jools Holland in May 2008, where they played [...] "Unfinished Business" [...] and [...] "Death", the latter of which was released as a single later that year and reached number 52 in the United Kingdom.

[...] <b>To</b> <b>Lose</b> <b>My</b> Life..., the band's debut album, was released one week later. The album was a commercial success, debuting at {{number one on the}} UK Albums Chart.

2500|$|In 1969, Haggard {{released}} [...] "Okie From Muskogee," [...] with lyrics ostensibly {{reflecting the}} singer's {{pride in being}} from Middle America where people are conventionally patriotic, don't smoke marijuana, don't take LSD, don't protest by burning draft cards or otherwise challenge authority. In the ensuing years, Haggard gave varying statements regarding whether he intended the song as a humorous satire or a serious political statement in support of conservative values. In a 2001 interview, Haggard called the song a [...] "documentation of the uneducated that lived in America at the time." [...] However, he made several other statements suggesting that he meant the song seriously. On the Bob Edwards Show, he said, [...] "I wrote it when I recently {{got out of the}} joint. I knew what it was like <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>my</b> freedom, and I was getting really mad at these protesters. They didn't know anything more about the war in Vietnam than I did. I thought how my dad, who was from Oklahoma, would have felt. I felt I knew how those boys fighting in Vietnam felt." [...] In the country music documentary series Lost Highway, he elaborated: [...] "My dad passed away when I was nine, and I don't know if you've ever thought about somebody you've lost and you say, 'I wonder what so-and-so would think about this?' I was drivin' on Interstate 40 and I saw a sign that said '19 Miles to Muskogee.' Muskogee was always referred to in my childhood as 'back home.' So I saw that sign and my whole childhood flashed before my eyes and I thought, 'I wonder what dad would think about the youthful uprising that was occurring at the time, the Janis Joplins.... I understood 'em, I got along with it, but what if he was to come alive at this moment? And I thought, what a way to describe the kind of people in America that are still sittin' {{in the center of the}} country sayin', 'What is goin' on on these campuses?'" [...] In the American Masters documentary about him, he said, [...] "That's how I got into it with the hippies.... I thought they were unqualified to judge America, and I thought they were lookin' down their noses at something that I cherished very much, and it pissed me off. And I thought, 'You sons of bitches, you've never been restricted away from this great, wonderful country, and yet here you are in the streets bitchin' about things, protesting about a war that they didn't know any more about than I did. They weren't over there fightin' that war any more than I was." ...|$|E
