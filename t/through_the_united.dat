5|$|Some seabird {{species have}} benefited from fisheries, {{particularly}} from discarded fish and offal. These discards compose 30% of the food of seabirds in the North Sea, for example, and compose up to 70% of the total food of some seabird populations. This can have other impacts; for example, {{the spread of the}} northern fulmar <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Kingdom is attributed in part to the availability of discards. Discards generally benefit surface feeders, such as gannets and petrels, to the detriment of pursuit divers like penguins.|$|E

5|$|A {{cold front}} moved eastward <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States {{in the middle}} part of July, and reached the East Coast of the United States on July23. By the {{following}} day, a low pressure area developed just southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina ahead of the frontal zone, and quickly formed into a subtropical depression. In association with a nearby upper-level low, the depression tracked quickly southeastward before turning to the southwest. The subtropical depression gradually organized, and satellite classifications began subsequent to merging with a tropical wave on July25. Convection developed closer {{to the center of}} circulation as it gradually decelerated while continuing southwestward and on July27, the system organized into Tropical Depression Three while located about 335miles (539.1km) east of Daytona Beach, Florida.|$|E

5|$|After {{his return}} to Parliament in 1922, Lansbury was denied office in the brief Labour {{government}} of 1924, although he served as First Commissioner of Works in the Labour government of 1929–31. After {{the political and economic}} crisis of August 1931, Lansbury did not follow his leader, Ramsay MacDonald, into the National Government, but remained with the Labour Party. As the most senior of the small contingent of Labour MPs that survived the 1931 general election, Lansbury became the Leader of the Labour Party. His pacifism and his opposition to rearmament in the face of rising European fascism put him at odds with his party, and when his position was rejected at the 1935 Labour Party conference, he resigned the leadership. He spent his final years travelling <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States and Europe in the cause of peace and disarmament.|$|E
5|$|After this, SR75 passes <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States Naval Amphibious Base for a {{few miles}} before {{entering}} downtown Coronado. The highway becomes Orange Avenue and turns north-northeast as the main street through Coronado. SR75 intersects SR 282 at the one-way couplet of Third and Fourth Streets; SR282 continues west on Third Street and returns to SR75 on Fourth Street, while SR75 continues east on Fourth Street and heads west towards Orange Avenue on Third Street. The one-way couplet is brief, and SR75 becomes a divided highway before crossing the Coronado Bridge. While on the bridge, SR75 crosses into the city of San Diego again.|$|E
5|$|As British offshoots, the Australian colonies {{participated in}} Britain's small {{wars of the}} 19th century, while later as a federated dominion, and then an {{independent}} nation, Australia fought in the First World War and Second World War, {{as well as in}} the wars in Korea, Malaya, Borneo and Vietnam during the Cold War. In the Post-Vietnam era Australian forces have been involved in numerous international peacekeeping missions, <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Nations and other agencies, including in the Sinai, Persian Gulf, Rwanda, Somalia, East Timor and the Solomon Islands, as well as many overseas humanitarian relief operations, while more recently they have also fought as part of multi-lateral forces in Iraq and Afghanistan.

In 1839 she wrote The Characters of Schiller, a critical {{essay on the}} writer Friedrich Schiller including her translation {{of many of his}} poems. She wrote Scenes in the Life of Joanna of Sicily, a history of the lifestyles of female nobility, and Rambles about the Country, a lively description of the scenery she had observed in her travels <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States, in 1840. She continued writing poems, translations and essays on European literature which she contributed to the American Monthly, the North American Review, the Southern Literary Messenger, the Southern Quarterly Review and other periodicals.

5|$|In late 2000, Wail {{traveled}} to the United Arab Emirates, where he purchased traveler's checks, presumed to have been paid for by Mustafa Ahmed al-Hawsawi. Five other hijackers passed <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Arab Emirates and purchased traveler's checks, including Majed Moqed, Saeed al-Ghamdi, Hamza al-Ghamdi, Ahmed al-Haznawi and Ahmed al-Nami. The 9/11 Commission believes {{that three of the}} future muscle hijackers, including Wail and Waleed, traveled in a group from Saudi Arabia to Beirut and then onward to Iran where they could travel through to Afghanistan without getting their passports stamped. An associate of a senior Hezbollah operative is thought to have been on the same flight, although this may have been a coincidence.|$|E
5|$|In view {{of growing}} labor shortages, on July 1, 1944 the War Manpower Commission made an {{important}} decision, ruling that {{from then on}} all hiring of male employees in the country was to be done <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States Employment Service (USES). By that time the USES followed strict anti-discrimination employment practices. The PTC management finally gave in and within a week posted notices about available skilled positions that {{would be open to}} all applicants, regardless of race. The company accepted eight black applicants (three from the USES and five from its own ranks) to train as streetcar coachmen. Their training was to take place in late July, and they were to start taking an empty streetcar on the lines from August 1. It was that impending trial run of the streetcars by the eight black trainees that finally triggered the strike.|$|E

5|$|Macdonald's Conservative {{government}} {{then fell}} from {{power over the}} Pacific Scandal, {{and was replaced by}} the Liberal administration of Alexander Mackenzie, who placed more credence on Morris's reports and had his own moral concerns about the whiskey trade. These worries were amplified by calls from Washington for Ottawa to secure the frontier and so prevent American Indians from purchasing whiskey in Canada. Mackenzie initially suggested sending a joint Canadian-United States military expedition, but, after the Governor General and others noted the serious implications of inviting the United States Army to deploy into Canadian territory, he instead agreed to deploy the new mounted police to carry out the operation. Another 150 men were recruited in eastern Canada and sent west by rail <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States to rendezvous with {{the first part of the}} force at Fort Dufferin.|$|E
5|$|New Jersey {{remained}} in mothball fleet until the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act of 1999 passed <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States Congress 18 October 1998.

Section 1012 also required the transferee to locate the battleship in the State of New Jersey. The Navy made the switch in January 1999, and on 12 September, New Jersey was towed by the tug Sea Victory from Bremerton, Washington to Philadelphia, for restoration work in the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard in advance of her planned donation {{for use as a}} museum.|$|E

The actual decision to surrender was taken by Niazi on 15 December and was conveyed to Manekshaw <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States Consul General in Dhaka (then Dacca) via Washington. But Manekshaw replied that he would stop the war only if the Pakistani troops surrendered to their Indian counterparts by 9:00a.m. on 16 December.
