5|$|Susan was {{diagnosed}} with Multiple sclerosis in 2007. Two years prior, MS Australia pitched a storyline to the Neighbours team asking for a character to be diagnosed with MS and for them to then show the impact MS can have on a community. The society contacted a producer and discussed a possible storyline for a young character in her twenties who had a promising career and family ahead of her. In 2006, the society {{received a phone call}} from one of the writers who revealed that they had chosen to write an MS story into the show and they had selected Susan Kennedy to be the character <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> diagnosed. The society was initially disappointed, as Susan was older than the typical person diagnosed with the condition. However, they were pleased that a permanent character and not an extra was chosen. MS Australia attended a meeting with the Neighbours writers to help develop a realistic and true portrayal of the diagnosis, symptoms and treatments. On-screen Susan was seen displaying unusual symptoms, including black outs and loss of sight and sensation in her hands. She was then seen undergoing an MRI scan, before she {{was diagnosed}} with multiple sclerosis.|$|E

25|$|As was {{the case}} in most {{southern}} cities, African Americans in Hopewell were subject to Jim Crow segregation until the success of the Civil Rights Movement. The picturesque theater in the middle of town, the Beacon Theater, only allowed Blacks in the balcony.

500|$|The {{suit that}} Clark dons {{in the series}} finale was {{originally}} used in the 2006 film Superman Returns, worn by Brandon Routh. The producers of Smallville had been offered the suit worn by Christopher Reeve in the original Superman films; however, they turned the offer down. Peterson reasoned that this was because it [...] "didn't quite fit with our world". The final scene was shot to be reminiscent of the similar scene in the original 1978 Superman film, where Reeve rips open his shirt to reveal the Superman suit. Beeman {{and the rest of}} the production staff reviewed the scene to make sure that they filmed the homage correctly, but Beeman later noted that the iconic scene was [...] "clunkier" [...] and more [...] "out of focus" [...] than they wanted, and that people's memories make it seem more impressive. However, he was pleased that the recreated shot was the sequence to wrap up Smallville, noting that he [...] "always thought <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the final moment".|$|E
500|$|On March 15, 2012, Rihanna {{explained}} her {{collaboration with}} Brown to Ryan Seacrest during his morning show: [...] "The first song that came about was 'Birthday Cake'. I mean, {{we ended up}} recording {{them at the same}} time and executing them together. But I reached out to him about doing 'Birthday Cake' because that’s the only person that, really, it made sense to do the record. Just as a musician, despite everything else, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the person. You know I thought about rappers, and I’ve done that so many times, and the hottest R artist out right now is Chris Brown. So I wanted him on the track, and then in turn he was like, ‘Why don’t you do the remix to my track?’ and it was a trade-off. We did two records. One for my fans, one for his fans, and that way our fans can come together. There shouldn’t be a divide. You know? It’s music, and it’s innocent." [...] In March 2012, American rapper Fabolous released his own verse to the [...] "Birthday Cake" [...] remix. The following month, Rick Ross also released the track featuring an added rap verse from himself, along with the previously incorporated Chris Brown verses. Busta Rhymes released his own freestyle to the song along with rapper Reek da Villian.|$|E

500|$|... "The Xindi" [...] {{was seen}} as a new pilot by {{executive}} producers Brannon Braga and Rick Berman, who also wrote the episode. Braga said [...] "We were re-establishing an Enterprise <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a little bit different this year, so we had to think of it in those terms." [...] They felt {{the best way to do}} this was to immediately reveal the Xindi to the audience, and to give the MACOs something to do in order to introduce them as well. He called it a [...] "big episode" [...] as they sought to set up the rest of season. The shoot began on June 26, 2003, with the expectation that it would take nine days (as opposed to the usual seven) to complete. One of the special effects on the episode used ground Styrofoam which had been painted blue and processed through a wood chipper. It was used to represent the mineral Trellium-D within the mine. However, the ground Styrofoam stuck to the actors' shoes and costumes and ended up being spread throughout the Paramount lot where the series was filmed. It would turn up in unexpected places on set for the rest of the series, and was found in among the sets as they were being dismantled after the end of [...]|$|E
500|$|Rings Around the World was the Super Furry Animals' {{first album}} for Epic Records {{following}} the demise, in 1999, {{of their previous}} label Creation {{and the success of}} 2000's Mwng, which was issued on the band's own label, Placid Casual. Singer Gruff Rhys has stated that the band aimed to make a [...] "laid back and sort of wiped clean" [...] record with Rings.... In a 2008 interview with Uncut Rhys described the album as [...] "a very ambitious project" [...] stating that [...] "We were trying to make a blockbuster album <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> like The Eagles ... We were trying to make utopian pop music that had pretensions of being progressive and exciting." [...] Rings... was originally going to be called Text Messaging is Destroying the Pub Quiz as We Know It and released as a double album containing 75–90 minutes of material with Rhys stating that he was [...] "into the excess of it, that was the whole point". The group eventually decided against the idea but, drawn by the technical capabilities of the format and the desire to do something that had never been done before, produced a DVD version of Rings..., making it the first album to be simultaneously released on CD and DVD. The DVD features a surround sound mix alongside music videos and remixes and was made possible only by the financial backing of Epic.|$|E
500|$|Between 2010 and 2012, Ariel Pink, Jennifer Herrema and Danny Brown {{revealed}} {{that they had}} worked with the Avalanches on new music, the latter mentioning a track named [...] "Frank Sinatra". In December 2011, the band's Twitter page released lyrics to a new song, [...] "The Stepkids". [...] In 2012, the group released a track entitled [...] "A Cowboy Overflow of the Heart" [...] featuring musician David Berman, reading a poem he composed over music by the group. A year later, the Avalanches also released a remix of Hunters & Collectors' first single [...] "Talking to a Stranger". During this era, they also devoted {{a large amount of}} time working on the score to King Kong, a 2013 theater production which took two years to produce. In the end, only a 25-second track by the group was used in the final production. Later, they worked on a psychedelic animation project <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a [...] "hip hop version of Yellow Submarine". It was to be a feature-length animated movie released under the Avalanches' name along with an album. The animation was being produced in a classic cel animation style by an artist in South Korea, drawing influences from 1960s Japanese pop art. It was being funded privately but the money fell through two years into production and the project was never finished. The Wildflower track [...] "The Noisy Eater" [...] features remains of the project. Through the projects and collaborations over the years, the group had collected enough music which could be combined into a new album, marking a similar process to how Since I Left You was built.|$|E
