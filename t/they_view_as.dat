25|$|On 7 February 2014, {{student and}} other protesters showed their anti-government stances by {{carrying}} and throwing around computer mice {{in front of}} the Parliament building, criticizing what <b>they</b> <b>view</b> <b>as</b> the government's reluctance to implement a system of electronic voting.|$|E
25|$|Certain modern Buddhists, {{particularly}} in Western countries, reject—or {{at least take}} an agnostic stance toward—the concept of rebirth or reincarnation, which <b>they</b> <b>view</b> <b>as</b> incompatible {{with the concept of}} anatta. Stephen Batchelor discusses this issue in his book Buddhism Without Beliefs. Others point to research that has been conducted at the University of Virginia as proof that some people are reborn.|$|E
25|$|The Habad-Lubavitch {{intellectual}} {{school of}} Hasidism {{broke away from}} General-Hasidism's emotional faith orientation, by making the mind central as the route to the internal heart. Its texts combine what <b>they</b> <b>view</b> <b>as</b> rational investigation with explanation of Kabbalah through articulating unity in a common Divine essence. In recent times, the messianic element latent in Hasidism {{has come to the}} fore in Habad.|$|E

25|$|Since the September 11, 2001 attacks, many in {{the party}} have {{supported}} neoconservative policies {{with regard to the}} War on Terror, including the 2001 war in Afghanistan and the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The George W. Bush administration took the position that the Geneva Conventions do not apply to unlawful combatants, while other prominent Republicans strongly oppose the use of enhanced interrogation techniques, which <b>they</b> <b>view</b> <b>as</b> torture.|$|E
25|$|Withdrawing the advert {{was also}} controversial, as critics accused Heinz of homophobia. The gay rights group Stonewall {{called for a}} boycott of the company's products. Some have {{expressed}} surprise that Heinz has responded to what <b>they</b> <b>view</b> <b>as</b> {{a small number of}} complaints, relative to the United Kingdom's 3.6million gay and lesbian consumers. MP Diane Abbott called the decision to withdraw the advert 'ill-considered' and 'likely to offend the gay community' in an early day motion on June 25.|$|E
25|$|The Samaritans, a {{very small}} {{community}} located entirely around Mount Gerizim in the Nablus/Shechem region of the West Bank and in Holon, near Tel Aviv in Israel, regard themselves as {{the descendants of the}} Israelites of the Iron Age kingdom of Israel. Their religious practices are based on the literal text of the written Torah (Five Books of Moses), which <b>they</b> <b>view</b> <b>as</b> the only authoritative scripture (with a special regard also for the Samaritan Book of Joshua).|$|E

40|$|In December 1972 a {{group of}} {{scholars}} engaged in educational evaluation and curriculum reform assembled, in what was later {{to be called the}} Cambridge conference, to challenge what <b>they</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> the then “traditional style of evaluation” (MacDonald & Parlett 1973 : 74). Their aim was to develop guidelines for the future of educational evaluation, and to challenge the traditional evaluation style. In the present policy context, it is instructive to revisit the manifesto that summarised this conference MacDonald & Parlett 1973) to see what these scholars wanted to challenge, what <b>they</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> problematic and what they wanted to promote...|$|R
25|$|Opponents {{to the law}} {{claim that}} the reforms do in fact {{represent}} an imposition of legislation that does not enjoy broad support, pointing out that opinion polls often favor urban populations and are not representative of Moroccan society as a whole. Many Islamic groups have emphasized {{that they do not}} oppose reform of the Mudawana in general, but reject what <b>they</b> <b>view</b> <b>as</b> reforms rooted in externally imposed principles, such as those based in international human rights law, as opposed to exclusively Islamic origins.|$|E
25|$|Christian countercult {{activism}} stems {{mainly from}} evangelicalism or fundamentalism. The countercult movement asserts that particular Christian sects whose beliefs they deem to be partially or wholly not {{in accordance with}} the Bible are erroneous. It also states that a religious sect can be considered a cult if its beliefs involve a denial of what <b>they</b> <b>view</b> <b>as</b> any of the essential Christian teachings such as salvation, the Trinity, Jesus himself as a person, the ministry and miracles of Jesus, his crucifixion, his resurrection, the Second Coming and the Rapture.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, {{mandatory}} vaccination laws sometimes provoke {{opposition from}} members of anti-government or libertarian factions, who express concern for what <b>they</b> <b>view</b> <b>as</b> the convergence or merger {{of the public and}} private sectors. They point to possible conflicts of interest due to vaccine research funding and misinformation that fuels debate on both sides. Others argue that, for compulsory vaccination to effectively prevent disease, there must be not only available vaccines and a population willing to immunize, but also sufficient ability to decline vaccination on grounds of personal belief.|$|E
25|$|The rising {{capitalistic}} {{middle class}} resented the drain of their wealth to the church; in northern Europe, they supported local reformers against the corruption, rapacity and venality which <b>they</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> originating in Rome.|$|R
5000|$|Mollie Monroe was despised {{by most of}} Prescott's {{high society}} women, for what <b>they</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> [...] "manly manners" [...] and, as a popular {{publication}} of the time said, [...] "morals that are dissolute".|$|R
50|$|The play {{received}} critical {{attention for}} its exploration of gay themes in Christianity. It was also condemned by Catholic League, a Roman Catholic watchdog group, for what <b>they</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> blasphemy, sacrilege, and anti-Catholic bigotry.|$|R
25|$|The Russian {{recognition}} of Abkhazia and South Ossetia {{is also an}} issue. On one hand, Circassians are often highly enthusiastic to help the Abkhaz, who <b>they</b> <b>view</b> <b>as</b> brothers, and are enthusiastic also for Abkhazia's independence. On the other hand, however, it evidences a perceived double standard used negatively on the Chechens (whom many Circassians supported during the First Chechen War), {{and to a lesser}} extent, the Circassians as well. Paul Goble noted that the {{recognition of}} South Ossetia, in addition to enraging the Chechens and Ingush, also radicalized many Circassians against Russia, because of the mass of double standards.|$|E
25|$|A {{portion of}} the {{homeless}} population are generally in transit, {{but there is no}} generally accepted terminology to describe them; some nomenclature is frequently associated with derogatory connotations, and thus the professional and vernacular lingo to describe these persons is both evolving and not lacking in controversy. Much of the concern stems from the European situation, where homeless persons of Roma, Sinti and other ethnic descent have rejected the term gypsy, which <b>they</b> <b>view</b> <b>as</b> a racial slur. Other terms which some use regarding in-transit persons are: transient, vagabond, tramp or drifter. Occasionally, these terms are interchanged with terms not necessarily implying that the person is a traveler, e.g. hobo. The pejorative term bum is used for persons who are alleged to be lacking a work ethic. The term transient is frequently used in police reports, without any precise definitions across jurisdictions.|$|E
25|$|The socialist view of {{economic}} freedom conceives of freedom as a concrete situation {{as opposed to}} an abstract or moral concept. This view of freedom is closely related to the socialist view of human creativity and the importance ascribed to creative freedom. Socialists view creativity as an essential aspect of human nature, thus defining freedom as a situation or state of being where individuals are able to express their creativity unhindered by constraints of both material scarcity and coercive social institutions. Marxists stress the importance of freeing the individual from what <b>they</b> <b>view</b> <b>as</b> coercive, exploitative and alienating social relationships of production they are compelled to partake in, as well as the importance {{of economic}} development as providing the material basis for the existence of a state of society where there are enough resources to allow for each individual to pursue his or her genuine creative interests.|$|E

5000|$|The Stone Roses {{asked the}} duo to remix [...] "Begging You", from their Second Coming album. After {{beginning}} {{work on a}} remix which <b>they</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> having potential, <b>they</b> later denied the idea and the work was cancelled.|$|R
25|$|Jehovah's Witnesses {{believe their}} {{allegiance}} belongs to God's Kingdom, which <b>they</b> <b>view</b> <b>as</b> an actual government. They refrain from saluting {{the flag of}} any country or singing nationalistic songs, which they believe are forms of worship, although they may stand out of respect. They also refuse to participate in military serviceeven when it is compulsoryand do not become involved in politics. They believe Jesus' refusal to rule the kingdoms {{of the world as}} offered by the Devil, his refusal to be made king of Israel by the Jews, and his statements that he, his followers, and his kingdom {{are not part of the}} world, provide the bases for not being involved in politics or government. Witnesses are taught that they should obey laws of the governments where they live unless such laws conflict with their beliefs, such as operating covertly in countries where their activities are banned.|$|E
25|$|Since 2000, Russia {{has also}} {{experienced}} {{a string of}} suicide bombings that killed hundreds {{of people in the}} Caucasian republics of Chechnya, Dagestan and Ingushetia, as well as in Russia proper including Moscow. Responsibility for most of these attacks were claimed by either Shamil Basayev's Islamic-nationalist rebel faction or, later, by Dokka Umarov's pan-Islamist movement Caucasus Emirate which is aiming to unite most of Russia's North Caucasus as an emirate since its creation in 2007. Since the creation of the Caucasus Emirate, the group has abandoned its secular nationalist goals and fully adopted the ideology of Salafist-takfiri Jihadism which seeks to advance the cause of Allah on the earth by waging war against the Russian government and non-Muslims in the North Caucasus, such as the local Sufi Muslim population, whom <b>they</b> <b>view</b> <b>as</b> mushrikeen (polytheists) who do not adhere to true Islamic teachings. In 2011, the U.S. Department of State included the Caucasus Emirate on its list of terrorist organisations.|$|E
500|$|The Kalikula (family of Kali) form of Shaktism is most {{dominant}} in Nepal, northern and eastern India, and is most widely prevalent in West Bengal, Assam, Bihar and Odisha, {{as well as}} parts of Maharashtra, Bangladesh and some parts of Kerala. Kalikula lineages focus upon the Devi {{as the source of}} wisdom (vidya) and liberation (moksha). They generally stand [...] "in opposition to the brahmanic tradition," [...] which <b>they</b> <b>view</b> <b>as</b> [...] "overly conservative and denying the experiential part of religion." ...|$|E

50|$|The new {{government}} gave particular {{importance to the}} Islamic community, especially the Bosnian Muslims which <b>they</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> Croat Muslims. The Meštrović Pavilion in the centre of Zagreb {{was turned into a}} mosque, with three minarets built around it.|$|R
60|$|Sir Philip laughed heartily, {{for both}} he and the Doctor had been so much entranced and amused as {{to be far more}} {{diverted}} at the lad's discomfiture than scandalised at the bride's escapade, which <b>they</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> child's play.|$|R
500|$|Positive Black Soul has {{promoted}} political activity and activism in other areas. The group urged Senegalese people {{to participate in}} the country's government and vote in elections. PBS also decries images of Africa in the media, which <b>they</b> <b>view</b> <b>as</b> one-sided. They state: [...] "We want to show the positivity in the black soul. That's our fight. Africa is not only a land of suffering, misery, war and disease. We're proud to live there and we are not suffering." [...] They view their chosen medium of rap as an accessible way to talk about issues such as corruption and politics. AIDS has also been featured in their music: one song, [...] "Écoute Fils" [...] ("Listen Son"), is written about the disease and cautions listeners about its dangers.|$|E
500|$|Their sixth {{full-length}} album, Narrow Stairs, {{was released}} on May 12, 2008. The first single, [...] "I Will Possess Your Heart", {{was released on}} March 18, 2008. The album version of the song is over eight minutes in length, leading radio and promotional edits to remove the extended intro to shorten the song to four minutes. The second single, [...] "Cath...", was released on July 21, 2008, and the third single [...] "Grapevine Fires", was released on March 3, 2009. The two singles [...] "I Will Possess Your Heart" [...] and [...] "Cath..." [...] both reached the top ten of the Alternative Songs chart, while [...] "Grapevine Fires" [...] reached number 21. In an album review, MTV writer James Montgomery said [...] "Narrow Stairs is a great album, one that could make them very famous, but could very well also kill their careers," [...] and although [...] "Death Cab for Cutie had gone insane," [...] he believed the LP could be [...] "an early contender for the best album of 2008." [...] Indeed, Narrow Stairs was nominated for [...] "Best Alternative Music Album" [...] and [...] "I Will Possess Your Heart" [...] received a nomination for [...] "Best Rock Song" [...] at the 51st Grammy Awards. The band lost in both categories, but prompted debate after appearing at the ceremony sporting blue ribbons to protest against what <b>they</b> <b>view</b> <b>as</b> the excessive use of Auto-Tune in the music industry. Narrow Stairs was their first album to reach No.1 on the Billboard 200 chart on May 31, 2008. [...] Though the album achieved strong success, Gibbard went on {{to call it the}} band's most [...] "depressing record".|$|E
