25|$|One {{challenge}} studying sleep {{evolution is}} that adequate sleep information is known only for two phyla of animals- chordata and arthropoda. With the available data, comparative {{studies have been}} used to determine how sleep might have evolved. One question that scientists <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> through these studies is whether sleep evolved only once or multiple times. To understand this, they look at sleep patterns in different classes of animals whose evolutionary histories are fairly well-known and study their similarities and differences.|$|E

500|$|Jennie Punter of The Globe and Mail {{praised the}} film, stating [...] "Van Dormael holds this {{fractured}} fairy tale together by giving it an emotional core and delivers {{two hours of}} time travel with a playful spirit and at a mostly hyperkinetic pace, sprinkling it with amusing side journeys and sometimes letting a scene unfold at a more natural tempo." [...] Bruce Kirkland of Jam! gave the film four stars out of five and wrote, [...] "Expect the unexpected. <b>Try</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> the unanswerable question that writer-director Van Dormael poses. It is a worthwhile exercise." [...] He also described Leto's acting as a [...] "marvelously full-blooded, brain-spinning, tour-de-force performance." [...] Ken Eisner from The Georgia Straight summarized the film as [...] "a dazzling feat of philosophical fancy, and it attempts {{nothing less than the}} summing up of an entire life, and an epoch or two, with its free-spinning take on recent human history as projected into possible futures." ...|$|E

By contrast, Arsenal made their 21st Community Shield appearance, and won 13, including one shared in 1991. They went into the match as holders of the Shield, having defeated Manchester City a year earlier. Both clubs had only once met before in the Shield, when Chelsea won by two goals to one in 2005. Arsenal had failed to beat Chelsea in all competitions since 2011, and [...] Mourinho was undefeated against his opponent Arsène Wenger in 13 matches. Mourinho told reporters a winless run was something he would not tolerate: “I would <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer,</b> not because of a mental block but because I would {{want to try to}} find solutions to help my team to do it – try to find a different way, try to find the reasons why it goes all the time against my team."

2500|$|The short {{version of}} the ode was {{possibly}} finished in one day because Wordsworth left {{the next day to}} spend time with Samuel Taylor Coleridge in Keswick. Close to the time Wordsworth and Coleridge climbed the Skiddaw mountain, 3 April 1802, Wordsworth recited the four stanzas of the ode that were completed. The poem impressed Coleridge, and, while with Wordsworth, he was able to provide his response to the ode's question within an early draft of his poem, [...] "". In early 1804, Wordsworth was able to return his attention to working on the ode. It was a busy beginning of the year with Wordsworth having to help Dorothy recover from an illness in addition to writing his poems. The exact time of composition is unknown, but it probably followed his work on The Prelude, which consumed much of February and was finished on 17 March. [...] Many of the lines of the ode are similar to the lines of The Prelude Book V, and he used the rest of the ode to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> the question {{at the end of the}} fourth stanza.|$|E
