500|$|Because of {{his many}} {{absences}} from home, on parliamentary and other business, Richard Cobden was a somewhat remote figure to his daughters, although his letters indicate that he felt warmly towards them and that he wished to direct their political education. In later years they would all acknowledge his influence over their ideas. Both parents impressed on the girls their responsibilities for the poor in the local community; Jane Cobden's 1864 diary records visits to homes and workhouses. She and her younger sister Anne, at the ages of 12 and 10 respectively, taught classes in the local village school. [...] The girls were encouraged by their father to contribute what money they possessed to relieve local poverty: [...] "Do not keep the money... as you have now made up your minds {{to give it to}} poor sufferers, let your own neighbours have it. Your Mama will tell you how to dispose of it, and <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> about it".|$|E
500|$|Merryman had a {{relationship}} with stock car racing driver Jeff Gordon. She first met Gordon in 2000 while she was employed in Palm Beach, Florida at a Neiman Marcus store in a mall where she advised customers about cosmetics products. Merryman did not recognize the race-car driver at their first meeting, though her friends were excited to meet him during the same encounter. Initially Merryman turned down Gordon's request to take her out for lunch. One year after their initial encounter, they began {{a relationship}}. They were romantically-linked for 11 months. Merryman and Gordon vacationed together in Saint-Jean, Saint Barthélemy in the Caribbean in January 2003 to celebrate the New Year. This relationship caused difficulty for his then-ongoing marriage to Brooke Sealy. Sealy discovered Gordon's relationship with Merryman and subsequently divorced the race-car driver. Gordon's wife, who also went by the name Jennifer Brooke Gordon, cited Merryman by name in her divorce papers with the racecar driver. Merryman was featured in the October 2003 issue of Playboy magazine, where she was interviewed about her relationship with Gordon. Merryman stated that Gordon had confided in her: [...] "He got married when he was 23 and has been on the racetrack since he was a kid. He used to <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> the time he {{never had a chance to}} have fun." [...] She reflected on what she had learned after her period of time with Gordon, saying in the future she would avoid relationships both with men of his occupation and those who were married. Gordon did not comment on Merryman's 2003 appearance in the magazine. When asked about the article, Gordon refused to comment on it. He stated: [...] "It's not even worth commenting on. All I want to talk about is being fast". Gordon's divorce was finalized in June 2003.|$|E
2500|$|Papa's {{sense of}} humor went toward the visual, the kind that lends itself best to live performance. [...] He'd <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> sorts of stories about his boyhood there in Melville, {{and most of them}} were {{probably}} true. ... Most of them I thought were hilarious.|$|E

2500|$|Jill Marie Jones {{left the}} show {{at the end of}} Season 6. Akil stated, [...] "I would love for her (Jones) to come back, but Jill doesn't want to return. I don't know 100% why she made this decision. She didn't <b>tell</b> <b>me.</b> <b>All</b> she said when we talked was that she felt it was time for her to move on. The door is not closed. We've asked her to come back and have offered {{different}} ways for her to return. But I completely wish her well. There's no drama involved." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the first}} name of 'I' is not stated {{anywhere}} in the film, {{it is widely believed}} that it is 'Peter'. This myth arose {{as a result of a}} line of misheard dialogue. In the scene where Monty meets the two actors, Withnail asks him if he would like a drink. In his reply, Monty both accepts his offer and says [...] "...you must <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> the news, I haven't seen you since you finished your last film". [...] While pouring another drink, and downing his own, Withnail replies that he has been [...] "Rather busy uncle. TV and stuff". Then pointing at Marwood he says [...] "He's just had an audition for rep". Some fans hear this line as [...] "Peters had an audition for rep", although the original shooting script and all commercially published versions of the script read [...] "he's".|$|E
2500|$|And {{again in}} {{correspondence}} dated 7 February 1921:“I do love Sasun Eff; I {{think he is}} out and away the best man we've got and I am proud and pleased {{that he should have}} made friends with me. He is an old Jew, enormously tall and very thin; he talks excellent English, reads all the English papers, and is entirely devoid of any self-interest. He has no wish to take any further part in public life but he says he is convinced that the future of his country—if it is to have a future—is bound up with the British mandate and as long as we say he can help us he is ready to put himself at our service. He made a very considerable name in the Turkish Chamber where he sat as a strong Committee man. Some day I mean to make him <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> he really thought about the Committee. One can talk to him as man to man, and exchange genuine opinions” ...|$|E

2500|$|Prominent lyrics in {{the song}} include, [...] "I heard you like the bad girls, honey, is that true?"; [...] "Heaven is a place on earth with you/ <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> the {{things you want to}} do"; and [...] "open up a beer... and play a video game?" [...] In an {{interview}} for British online magazine The Quietus, Del Rey stated that the inspiration for the song came from her ex-boyfriend, commenting, [...] "I think we came together because we were both outsiders. It was perfect. But I think with that contentment also comes sadness. There was something heavenly about that life– we'd go to work and he'd play his video games– but also it was maybe too regular." [...] The singer also stated that she used lower vocals for [...] "Video Games" [...] because she felt that the public did not see her as a serious artist. Thematically, the lyrics have been labeled as antifeminist. Of the musical composition, MTV lauded the cinematic atmosphere of the song, adoring its feathery violins, echoing electronic thumps, and melancholic crescendos — wound into a dramatic exhibition.|$|E
2500|$|On September 19, 1968, Foley {{appeared}} in two Opry performances in Fort Wayne, Indiana, {{sponsored by the}} local Sheriff's Posse that included Billy Walker and 19-year-old Hank Williams, Jr., son of his long-time friend Hank Williams. Before the second show, according to Walker, Foley came to his dressing room and Walker shared his faith in Christ: Foley said, [...] "Do you think God could ever forgive a sinner like me?" [...] He began to <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> the rotten things he had done in his life, and I {{looked him in the}} face and said, [...] "Red, if God can forgive me, He can forgive you." [...] I prayed with Red. [...] He went out, and the last song he sang was [...] "Peace in the Valley." [...] He came over to side of the stage and said, 'Billy, I've never sung that song and feel the way I do tonight.' Foley suffered respiratory failure that night and died in his sleep, prompting Hank Williams, Jr. to write and record (as Luke the Drifter, Jr.) I Was With Red Foley (The Night He Passed Away). [...] According to the song, which charted that November, his last words were, [...] "I'm awful tired now, Hank. [...] I've got to go to bed." [...] Foley had sung [...] "Peace in the Valley" [...] at Hank Sr.'s funeral. [...] Foley was interred in Woodlawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Nashville.|$|E
