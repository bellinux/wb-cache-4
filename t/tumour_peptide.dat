40|$|The Mater Medical Research Institute {{proposes to}} {{undertake}} a Phase I clinical trial using CMRF- 56 immunoselected blood dendritic cells (BDC) loaded with control and myeloma-associated <b>tumour</b> <b>peptide</b> antigens {{for the treatment of}} multiple myeloma (MM) patients with minimal residual disease. This thesis describes some of the fundamental pre-clinical in vitro experiments undertaken in preparation for this trial so as to maximise the potential of this vaccine to induce myeloma-specific immune responses. These experiments involved determining the parameters for optimal activation of the CMRF- 56 immunoselected cell preparation and exploring the potential of novel myeloma peptide antigens to induce anti-myeloma cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses. CMRF- 56 immunoselected cell preparations, containing predominately myeloid BDC, monocytes and B cells, were prepared from both healthy donors and myeloma patients. Activation of this preparation with granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) was found to increase co-stimulatory molecule expression by and survival of BDC, improve peptide- and lysate-specific CTL induction, and, in combination with prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2), improve chemokine-specific migration of BDC. Following optimisation of in vitro CTL generation protocols, GM-CSF activated CMRF- 56 immunoselected cells were examined for their ability to induce myeloma-specific immunity. Using lysate from myeloma cell line U 266 as an antigen source, a polyclonal T cell pool was generated within which peptide specific CTL recognising myeloma antigens Muc 1, HM 1. 24 /BST 2, DKK- 1 and CT- 7 /MAGE-C 1 could be identified. Furthermore, GM-CSF activated CMRF- 56 immunoselected cells pulsed with HLA-A* 201 restricted peptides derived from Muc 1, HM 1. 24 /BST 2 and CT- 7 /MAGE-C 1 could induce CTL capable of lysing both peptide- and myeloma cell line targets in both healthy donors and myeloma patients. These results provide the first evidence of immunogenic HLA-A* 201 restricted epitopes of novel myeloma antigen CT- 7 /MAGE-C 1. The data collected in this study supports the application of GM-CSF activated CMRF- 56 immunoselected cells loaded with defined myeloma peptide antigens for the therapeutic vaccination of MM patients with minimal residual disease...|$|E

The present study concentrates on cholecystokinin (CCK), a gut-brain peptide that has been described to be able to induce mitosis of rat gliomas as well as hormone secretion by the anterior pituitary, via the CCK-B receptor. The significance of a polymorphism in the growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH) receptor (GHRH-R) gene was also determined. Finally, defects in the b-catenin gene, {{an important component of the}} developmental pathway, in a sub-set of craniopharyngiomas were investigated. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), restriction digestion analysis and direct sequencing demonstrated expression of CCK peptide itself and its A and B receptors by human gliomas, meningiomas and pituitary <b>tumours.</b> CCK <b>peptides</b> stimulated growth of cultured gliomas and meningiomas as well as in vitro hormone secretion [growth hormone (GH), luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) ] by human pituitary tumours. These biological effects were reduced or abolished by CCK antagonists. In addition, an antibody to CCK reduced mitosis by gliomas and meningiomas, and the same antibody inhibited hormone secretion by cultured human pituitary <b>tumours.</b> CCK <b>peptides</b> stimulated phosphatidylinositol (PI) hydrolysis, indicating coupling of the CCK receptors to phopsholipase C. Cyclic AMP was unaffected. In addition, caspase- 3 activity was significantly and markedly increased, whilst proteasome activity was decreased. Taken together, these results may indicate an autocrine/paracrine role of CCK in the control of growth and/or functioning of gliomas, meningiomas and pituitary tumours.

40|$|Summary. -Thirty-two scirrhous cancers {{of breast}} have been {{examined}} to determine {{the origin of the}} collagen stroma in these tumours. Employing two immunohistochemical techniques {{it has been shown that}} the malignant epithelial cells in 30 of these tumours contain not only collagen but also prolyl hydroxylase, a key enzyme in collagen biosynthesis. Neither this enzyme nor collagen was detectable in the spindle cells in the stroma of these tumours. Neither the epithelium in normal breast, that in fibrocystic disease and in fibroadenomata, nor the malignant epithelium in two medullary cancers of breast contained either collagen or prolyl hydroxylase. These results strongly suggest that the malignant epithelium of scirrhous breast cancers produces its own collagen stroma and that the scirrhous reaction in these tumours is not a host response to tumour invasion. The production of collagen and prolyl hydroxylase by breast cancer cells (of the scirrhous type) therefore represents another example of inappropriate protein production by a human tumour. MANY human <b>tumours</b> produce <b>peptides</b> or proteins unexpected from their tissue of origin. Among these inappropriate tumour products are hormones, e. g.

Our aim was to investigate WT 1 expression in a large cohort of various neuroepithelial tumours of different World Health Organization (WHO) grades and in normal central nervous system (CNS) tissue specimens to test its potential value as a diagnostic marker. Methods: Specimens were assessed by RT-PCR, Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. The samples investigated in our study consisted of 334 human neuroepithelial tumours, among those 33 oligodendrogliomas, 219 astrocytomas (including 105 glioblastomas) and 47 ependymomas. Results: Our results showed a de novo WT 1 expression in neuroepithelial tumours. In diffuse astrocytomas and ependymomas, WT 1 expression increased significantly with the grade of malignancy. In contrast, no significant difference was seen between WHO grade-II and -III oligodendrogliomas. Controlling for WHO grade, the comparison of oligodendrogliomas with ependymal and astrocytic tumours showed higher expression values for the latter. Conclusions: Our study shows that WT 1 is expressed de novo in numerous neuroepithelial tumours and increases with the grade of malignancy.

We selected a high-affinity monoclonal antibody, mAb 12 G 4, specific for human AMHR-II (hAMHR-II), by FACS analysis, Western blotting and immunohistochemical staining of a hAMHR-II-transfected CHO (Chinese hamster ovary) cell line, normal adult testicular tissue and granulosa cell <b>tumours.</b> Using <b>peptide</b> array screening, we identified the binding sequences of mAb 12 G 4 and AMH on the receptor. Identification of Asp 53 and Ala 55 as critical residues in the DRAQVEM minimal epitopic sequence of mAb 12 G 4 definitively accounted for the lack of cross-reactivity with the murine receptor, in which there is a glycine residue in place of an aspartic acid residue.

40|$|There is {{an urgent}} need to develop new {{combination}} therapies beyond existing surgery, radio- and chemo-therapy, perhaps initially combining chemotherapy with the targeting specificities of immunotherapy. For this, strategies to limit inflammation and immuno-suppression and evasion in the tumour microenvironment are also needed. To devise effective new immunotherapies we must first understand tumour immunology, including the roles of T cells, macrophages, myeloid suppressor cells and of exosomes and microvesicles (EMVs) in promoting angiogenesis, tumour growth, drug resistance and metastasis. One promising cancer immunotherapy discussed uses cationic liposomes carrying tumour RNA (RNA-lipoplexes) to provoke a strong anti-viral-like (cytotoxic CD 8 +) anti-tumour immune response. Mesenchymal stem cell-derived EMVs, with their capacity to migrate towards inflammatory areas including solid tumours, have also been used. As tumour EMVs clearly exacerbate the tumour microenvironment, another therapy option could involve EMV removal. Affinity-based methods to deplete EMVs, including an immuno-depletion, antibody-based affinity substrate, are therefore considered. Finally EMV and exosome-mimetic nanovesicles (NVs) delivery of siRNA or chemotherapeutic drugs that target <b>tumours</b> using <b>peptide</b> ligands for cognate receptors on the tumour cells are discussed.

METHODS: Labelling of Demotate 2 with (99 m) Tc was performed at room temperature using SnCl(2) as reductant in the presence of citrate at alkaline pH. Radiochemical analysis involved ITLC and HPLC methods. Peptide conjugate affinities for sst(2) were determined by receptor autoradiography on rat brain cortex sections using [DOTA(0),(125) I-Tyr(3) ]octreotate as the radioligand. The affinity profile of Demotate 2 for human sst(1) -sst(5) was studied by receptor autoradiography in cell preparations using the universal somatostatin radioligand [(125) I][Leu(8),(D:) Trp(22),Tyr(25) ]somatostatin- 28. The internalisation rates of [(99 m) Tc]Demotate 2 and [(111) In]DOTA-tate were compared in sst(2) -positive and -negative control cell lines. Biodistribution of radiopeptides was studied in male Lewis rats bearing CA 20948 <b>tumours.</b> RESULTS: <b>Peptide</b> conjugates showed selectivity and a high affinity binding for sst(2) (Demotate 2 IC(50) = 3. 2 nM and DOTA-tate IC(50) = 5. 4 nM).

40|$|Tumour {{necrosis}} factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is a pluripotent cytokine {{with its}} receptors distributed throughout many different cell types. Because {{of the diverse}} effects of the cytokine, {{it is difficult to}} clearly define its role in infection and immunity, and appreciate its clinical therapeutic value. We have identified peptides derived from the primary amino acid sequence of human TNF-alpha that have neutrophil-stimulating activity, as measured by enhanced chemiluminescence and superoxide production, and peptides which are both directly cytotoxic for tumour cells (WEHI- 164) in vitro and also prevent TNF binding to tumour cells. However, only one of these neutrophil-stimulating peptides was toxic for tumour cells in vitro. Our results indicate that the region of amino acids 54 - 94 of human TNF-alpha has previously undescribed human neutrophil-stimulatory activity, while peptides encompassing the regions 43 - 68 and 132 - 150, which are in close proximity, as indicated in the recently determined three-dimensional structure of human TNF-alpha, have in vitro anti-tumour activity. These <b>peptides</b> also slowed <b>tumour</b> growth or induced tumour regression in WEHI- 164 tumour-bearing mice.

The specific activity achievable for each radionuclide dictates the peptide amount to be injected for a tumour radiation dose of 60 Gy; tumour cure is not always possible with the same peptide amount of 0.03 nmol (corresponding to 0.1 μg) as was used in the biodistribution study. Especially, neutron capture reactor-produced radionuclides show a limitation in the maximum achievable specific activity [7]. The specific activity of the peptide should be optimized to achieve the highest possible absorbed dose to the tumour taking both the peptide mass with maximum receptor-mediated uptake and the maximum achievable specific activity into account. It is well known that unlabelled peptide will compete with the labelled peptide for the limited number of receptors and thereby reduce the uptake in target tissue [8]-[11].|$|R

40|$|Tumour {{associated}} antigens recognised by cellular or humoral effectors of {{the immune}} system are potential targets for antigen specific cancer immunotherapy. Different categories of cancer antigens have been identified that induce cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses in vitro and in vivo, namely: (1) "cancer testis" (CT) antigens, expressed in different tumours and normal testis, (2) melanocyte differentiation antigens, (3) point mutations of normal genes, (4) self antigens that are overexpressed in malignant tissues, and (5) viral antigens. Clinical studies with peptides and proteins derived from these antigens have been initiated to study the efficacy of inducing specific CTL responses in vivo. Immunological and clinical parameters for the assessment of antigen specific immune responses have been defined—delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH), CTL, autoimmmune, and tumour regression responses. Specific DTH and CTL responses and tumour regression have been observed after the intradermal administration of <b>tumour</b> associated <b>peptides</b> alone. Peptide specific immune reactions were enhanced after using granulocyte macrophage stimulating factor (GM-CSF) as a systemic adjuvant by increasing the frequency of dermal antigen presenting Langerhans cells. Complete tumour regression has been observed in the context of measurable peptide specific CTL. However, in single cases with disease progression after an initial tumour response, either a loss of single antigens targeted by CTL or of the presenting major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I allele was detected, pointing towards immunisation induced immune escape. Cytokines to modulate antigen and MHC class I expression in vivo are being evaluated to prevent immunoselection. Recently, a new CT antigen, NY-ESO- 1, has been identified on the basis of spontaneous antibody responses to tumour associated antigens. NY-ESO- 1 appears {{to be one of the}} most immunogenic antigens known to date, with spontaneous immune responses observed in 50 % of patients with NY-ESO- 1 expressing cancers. Clinical studies have been initiated to evaluate the immunogenicity of different NY-ESO- 1 constructs to induce both humoral and cellular immune responses in vivo...|$|R
30|$|Based on {{studies with}} 12 CCK 2 receptor-binding analogues, the {{biodistribution}} of the CCK 2 analogue PP-F 11 shows a very favourable uptake in CCK 2 receptor-expressing tumours and relatively low renal retention, {{which makes it}} potentially suitable for therapeutic application. This study aimed to investigate its possibilities and hurdles for successful radionuclide therapy with this peptide analogue in mice with s.c. CCK 2 receptor-expressing tumours. The particle range of the selected radionuclides has an important impact on the cure capability of the radioloabelled peptide for various sizes of tumours [3]. Since the receptor-mediated tumour uptake of radiolabelled PP-F 11 shows a saturable relation with peptide mass, the maximum achievable specific activity is an important parameter in this respect. Furthermore, {{it has to be}} taken into account that the production method of radionuclides determines the amount that can be labelled to peptides. Therefore, the higher specific activities reachable with 90 Y and 213 Bi make both radionuclides very suitable for therapy of 200 - to 300 -mg <b>tumours,</b> using lower <b>peptide</b> mass and thus higher tumour uptake. Yttrium (90 Y) is capable of controlling larger-sized (> 200 mg) tumours, whereas 213 Bi is capable of curing over the whole range of masses considered, but most optimal in the smallest sizes.|$|R
40|$|It is now {{understood}} that CD 4 + T cells {{play a central}} role in antitumour immunity; they are important in the priming of CTL and can augment cytotoxicity; they are also responsible for enhancing antitumour responses via indirect mechanisms such as recruitment of accessory cells to the tumour site and they are crucial in the formation of memory T cells. CD 4 + T cells recognise antigen in the context of peptide presented on MHC class II molecules, therefore recent research has focused on the identification of these peptides in order to formulate more effective immunotherapeutic strategies. As such, the aim of this study was to identify novel MHC class II HLA-DR 1 and HLA-DR 4 restricted immunogenic peptides derived from the MART- 1 and Tyrosinase tumour antigens. A computer algorithm (SYFPEITHI; available on the World Wide Web) was used to predict immunogenic peptides from the two <b>tumour</b> antigens; these <b>peptides</b> were then used to immunise HLA-DR 1 and HLA-DR 4 transgenic mice in order to assess their immunogenicity. At the same time efforts were made to optimise the screening process by fully characterising the BM-DC used in proliferation assays and employing antioxidants in conjunction with T cell culture...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY. -A 17 -year-old {{patient with}} a small paratesticular {{embryonic}} sarcoma presented with symptoms of renal failure, polyuria and widespread bone metastases. Investigation revealed hypercalcaemia and uraemia without any evidence of hyperparathyroidism. The hypercalcaemia responded {{over a period of}} weeks to administration of mithramycin with initial improvement in the symptoms and metabolic derangements. Control was lost with the necrosis of intra-abdominal tumour deposits and haemorrhagic polypoid deposits in the alimentary tract. The value and hazards of mithramycin are well demonstrated by these rare complications of this type of tumour. MITHRAMYCIN is an antibiotic with cytotoxic activity derived from an actinomycete of the Streptomyces genus. The drug acts like Actinomycin D by inhibiting DNA directed DNA synthesis (Yarbro, Kennedy and Barnum, 1966). Its established clinical importance is in the treatment of testicular neoplasms (Kennedy, Griffen and Lober, 1965; Brown and Kennedy, 1965). In addition {{it has been suggested that}} the drug may be of value in the emergency treatment of hypercalcaemia (Parsons, Baum and Self, 1967). Its hypocalcaemic effect appears to be due to blocking of the peripheral action of parathyroid hormone (PTH) or <b>tumour</b> produced PTH <b>peptides</b> on gut and bone. Mithramycin has been used for this purpose in a few cases producing temporary lowering of life endangerin...|$|R
40|$|The 6 -hydrazinonicotinyl group, {{known as}} HYNIC, is an {{attractive}} bifunctional coupling agent for preparing 99 mTc-labeled peptides and proteins for medical imaging. Peptides are useful for imaging disease states such as cancer and inflammation because they {{take advantage of a}} distinct cellular target, such as a receptor, being present on the cell. Receptors are often over expressed on <b>tumour</b> cells. <b>Peptides</b> will bind to their receptors with high specificity and affinity. There is a recognized need to create well-deﬁned polymer probes for in vivo and clinical PET and SPECT imaging to guide the development of new generation polymer therapeutics. In general the amount of radionuclide used in radiopharmaceuticals is small, so attaching the radionuclide to a polymer ensures that the radionuclide will be highly concentrated in the radiopharmaceutical. The number of binding sites is increased with the copolymer making it a viable choice for radiolabelling applications. The chances of successfully imaging the point of interest are therefore increased. This thesis presents the synthesis of various HYNIC analogues that are capable of chelating technetium- 99 m in order to be attached to an amino acid and incorporated into a peptide sequence via solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) to image site-specific targets. While 6 -HYNIC has been widely used, 2 -HYNIC has not, and as such both of these were used in the synthesis of a number of derivatives. These derivatives were characterised by 1 H and 13 C NMR, FT-IR and melting point data was obtained for comparison with literature. A number of derivatives were successfully synthesised and purified with the aim of binding these to copolymer chains. This work also presents the synthesis of a bifunctional copolymer (POEGMA-co-PAMA) which is biocompatible and can be attached to a HYNIC group and subsequently a peptide. This copolymer was synthesised using a controlled living radical polymerisation technique called Reversible Addition Fragmentation chain Transfer (RAFT). This technique was chosen due to its ability to synthesise polymers with predetermined molecular weights of complex architectures whilst maintaining control over polydispersity. Copolymers of varying compositions were synthesised and analysed by GPC and NMR. This method (once optimised) would allow for the copolymer to be labelled with technetium- 99 for SPECT, providing an alternative bioconjugate synthetic route...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: It {{has been}} shown that some primary human tumours and their metastases, {{including}} prostate and breast <b>tumours,</b> overexpress gastrin-releasing <b>peptide</b> (GRP) receptors. Bombesin (BN) is a neuropeptide with a high affinity for these GRP receptors. We demonstrated successful scintigraphic visualisation of BN receptor-positive tumours in preclinical studies using the radiolabelled BN analogue [(111) In-DTPA-Pro(1),Tyr(4) ]BN. However, the receptor affinity as well as the serum stability of this analogue leave room for improvement. Therefore new (111) In-labelled BN analogues were synthesised and evaluated in vitro and in vivo. METHODS AND RESULTS: The receptor affinity of the new BN analogues was tested on human GRP receptor-expressing prostate tumour xenografts and rat colon sections. Analogues with high receptor affinity (low nM range) were selected for further evaluation. Incubation in vitro of GRP receptor-expressing rat CA 20948 and human PC 3 tumour cells with the (111) In-labelled analogues resulted in rapid receptor-mediated uptake and internalisation. The BN analogue with the best receptor affinity and in vitro internalisation characteristics, Cmp 3 ([(111) In-DTPA-ACMpip(5),Tha(6),betaAla(11),Tha(13),Nle(14) ]BN(5 - 14)), was tested in vivo in biodistribution studies using rats bearing GRP receptor-expressing CA 20948 tumours, and nude mice bearing human PC 3 xenografts. Injection of (111) In-labelled Cmp 3 in these animals showed high, receptor-mediated uptake in receptor-positive organs and tumours which could be visualised using planar gamma camera and microSPECT/CT imaging. CONCLUSION: With their enhanced receptor affinity and their rapid receptor-mediated internalisation in vitro and in vivo, the new BN analogues, and especially Cmp 3, are promising candidates for use in diagnostic molecular imaging and targeted radionuclide therapy of GRP receptor-expressing cancers...|$|R
40|$|Preclinical {{research}} into radionuclide therapies based on radiation dosimetry {{will enable the}} use of any LET-equivalent radionuclide. Radiation dose and dose rate have significant influence on dose effects in the tumour depending on its radiation sensitivity, possibilities for repair of sublethal damage, and repopulation during or after the therapy. Models for radiation response of preclinical <b>tumour</b> models after <b>peptide</b> receptor radionuclide therapy based on the linear quadratic model are presented. The accuracy of the radiation dose is very important for observation of dose-effects. Uncertainties in the radiation dose estimation arise from incomplete assay of the kinetics, low accuracy in volume measurements and absorbed dose S-values for stylized models instead of the actual animal geometry. Normal dose uncertainties in the order of 20 % might easily make the difference between seeing a dose-effect or missing it altogether. This is true for the theoretical case of a homogeneous tumour type behaving in vivo {{in the same way as}} its cells do in vitro. Heterogeneity of tumours induces variations in clonogenic cell density, radiation sensitivity, repopulation capacity and repair kinetics. The influence of these aspects are analysed within the linear quadratic model for tumour response to radionuclide therapy. Preclinical tumour models tend to be less heterogenic than the clinical conditions they should represent. The results of various preclinical radionuclide therapy experiments for peptide receptor radionuclide therapy are compared to the outcome of theoretical models and the influence of increased heterogeneity is analysed when the results of preclinical research is transferred to the clinic. When the radiation dose and radiobiology of the tumour response is known well enough it may be possible to leave the current phenomenological approach in preclinical radionuclide therapy and start basing these experiments on radiation dose. Then the use of a gamma ray-emitting radionuclides for a chemically comparable beta-particle-emitting paired isotope for therapy evaluation would be feasible...|$|R
40|$|Summary A {{radioimmunoassay}} for neuron specific enolase (NSE), {{a marker}} of neuroendocrine differentiation, has been evaluated in small cell lung cancer (SCLC). In untreated patients 25 / 38 (68 %) with localized SCLC had raised blood levels of NSE (> 13 ng ml- 1), in extensive disease 34 / 39 (87 %) patients had raised NSE levels. In patients with {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC) the serum levels were raised in 16 / 94 (17 %). In extensive tumours of non-pulmonary origin NSE levels were increased in 24 / 116 (20 %) patients. Longitudinal studies indicated a good correlation between the response to chemotherapy and fall of NSE levels. Tumour progression was accompanied by a rising NSE in 25 / 29 patients, with doubling times of 7 - 90 days. In patients with progression with a normal NSE the recurrence was a NSCLC. Cerebral metastases occurring as the only recurrence during clinical complete remission were not accompanied by a rise of NSE. Serum NSE levels provides a valuable monitor for SCLC during and after chemotherapy. Enolase is a glycolytic enzyme [EC 4. 2. 1. 11] that is composed of sub units a,,B & y. Neuron specific enolase [NSE] is the yy dimer of enolase (Marangos et al., 1979). There is growing evidence that the histochemical demonstration of immunoreactive neuron specific enolase (NSE) in tumour cells can be used as an indicator of their likely neural or neuroendocrine origin. Biochemically these cells are characterised as possessing amine precursor uptake and decarboxylation (APUD) enzyme systems and the production of various hormones and <b>peptides.</b> <b>Tumours</b> arising from the neuroendocrine cell system that contain NSE include, small cell lung cancer (SCLC) (Marangos et al., 1982; Sheppard et al., 1984; Springhall et al., 1984) and some comparative rare cancers such as neuroblastom...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY Twenty five {{specimens}} {{of the human}} right atrial appendage were examined for immu-noreactivity to a human atrial natriuretic peptide. In the electron microscope characteristic amy-loid fibrils were identified around small blood vessels and adjacent to atrial muscle cells in eight of the surgical cases and in two necropsy cases. In six cases, four surgical and two necropsy, these fibrils contained immunoreactive a human atrial natriuretic peptide. Amyloid is known to occur in <b>peptide</b> secreting endocrine <b>tumours</b> and immunoreactive <b>peptide</b> may be incorporated in the amyloid matrix. The demonstration of atrial amyloid containing immunoreactive a human atrial natriuretic peptide suggests that some deposits of cardiac amyloid are of a type analogous to that found in other endocrine organs. Amyloidosis is a disorder characterised by the depo-sition of an abnormal protein usually in the extra-cellular tissues. It occurs as a primary disease process or secondary to several diverse conditions {{and the nature of}} the protein may differ from type to type. Amyloid has characteristic chemical staining reactions and is best defined by its appearance on electron microscopy which shows fine non-branching fibrils approximately 10 nm in diameter. Amyloid deposits occur in endocrine organs and may contain hormone related peptides. 1 For example, immunoreactive calcitonin is found in amyloid deposits associated with medullary car-cinoma of the thyroid. 2 3 It is now thought that the heart has an important endocrine role in the control of body fluid volume. Small molecular weight peptides have been isolated from the human atria and these have powerful natriuretic and diuretic effects. 4 Of these, the a human atrial natriuretic factor is believed to be the active circulating form. These peptides have been localised to neurosecretory granules within atrial muscle cells. During a study of the distribution and staining characteristics of neurosecretory granules in th...|$|R
