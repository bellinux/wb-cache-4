50|$|Spinellis further {{observes that}} in modern {{computer}} systems it is seldom sensible to embed such data into <b>the</b> <b>program</b> executable image itself, the performance gains {{of doing so}} being negligible.

40|$|To {{understand}} the implementation quality of <b>the</b> Tier 1 <b>Program</b> of <b>the</b> Project P. A. T. H.

In the telephone interviews, the participants described the responses of the students and the workers to <b>the</b> <b>program,</b> <b>the</b> perceived benefits of <b>the</b> <b>program,</b> their assessment of the positive and negative features of <b>the</b> <b>program,</b> as well as difficulties involved in the implementation process. Results showed that most workers perceived that the students had positive responses to <b>the</b> <b>program</b> and half of the workers had positive experiences about <b>the</b> <b>program,</b> although negative comments on <b>the</b> <b>program</b> design and difficulties in the implementation were also recorded. Nearly all workers (97. 1 %) regarded <b>the</b> <b>program</b> to be beneficial to the students and most of them (78. 6 %) had positive global evaluation of the project. In short, while <b>the</b> <b>program</b> implementers expressed concerns about <b>the</b> <b>program</b> design and <b>the</b> implementation process, they generally regarded <b>the</b> <b>program</b> as helpful to the students and they had positive global evaluation of <b>the</b> <b>program.</b> link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

5|$|In 1963, J. Alan Robinson had {{discovered}} a simple method to implement deduction on computers, the resolution and unification algorithm. However, straightforward implementations, like those attempted by McCarthy and his students in the late 60s, were especially intractable: <b>the</b> <b>programs</b> required astronomical numbers of steps to prove simple theorems. A more fruitful approach to logic {{was developed in the}} 1970s by Robert Kowalski at the University of Edinburgh, and soon this led to the collaboration with French researchers Alain Colmerauer and Philippe Roussel who created the successful logic programming language Prolog.|$|E
5|$|In 2000 a new curricular {{adjustment}} was made, {{with the}} objective to fulfill all the quality accreditation requirements.

When they both return to Tron City, they find out that Quorra had been kidnapped, and Blaze had threatened and hinted that if <b>the</b> <b>program</b> participated in <b>the</b> final match, he/she would possibly be derezzed. Then Gibson, who had come to watch the Tournament, tells <b>the</b> <b>program</b> that he saw where both Bosh and his henchmen drag her away to; so <b>the</b> <b>program</b> battled his/her way through the Elite Guards, across the Light Sail Station to Bosh, derezzed him and saved Quorra. Then both <b>the</b> <b>program</b> and Quorra hurried to the final event just in time, which was a Light Cycle battle against Blaze. <b>The</b> <b>program</b> wins, and after Blaze attempts and fails to derezz him, the user Kevin Flynn himself gave the trophy to the first ISO champion of the Grid Games.|$|R
