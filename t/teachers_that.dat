25|$|In 1998, Ioan Moisin, a Christian Democratic {{senator and}} a Greek Catholic priest, called upon Romania's Ministry of Education to {{establish}} a commission of Catholics who would revise biology textbooks and philosophical textbooks to not contradict Biblical creationism. Moisin disapproved of students learning from their religious <b>teachers</b> <b>that</b> God created human beings and then learning to the contrary from biology and philosophy <b>teachers</b> <b>that</b> humans descend from apes {{as a product of}} evolution by Darwinian natural selection. Moisin's proposal to establish the commission also sought to form a Council of Public Morality that would feature representatives composed of teachers and clergy, to oversee public education, and to be subordinated only to the direct authority of the President of Romania. Romania's Parliament and Ministry of Education never seriously considered the proposals.|$|E
25|$|An {{educational}} system was established. By June 1904, there were 50 schools {{with an average}} enrollment of 30 students each.

25|$|Educational {{outreach}} at the Folger {{began in}} the early 1970s; today, the Folger Education department continues those early efforts with a variety of programs for K–12 students and <b>teachers</b> <b>that</b> emphasize an active learning approach to Shakespeare. Teachers gather at the Folger for day-long and month-long programs to work to incorporate Shakespeare and performance in the classroom. The department also publishes a variety of materials for classroom use. Student programs include workshops, local residency initiatives, and a high school fellowship program during which students study Shakespeare at the Folger. The Emily Jordan Folger Children's Shakespeare Festival, founded in 1980, allows elementary students to perform every spring. The Secondary School Shakespeare Festival, founded the following year, brings students from grades 7–12 to perform half-hour collections of Shakespeare scenes in the Folger theater.|$|E
25|$|Turning his {{attention}} to the matter of education in the country, President Quezon by virtue of Executive Order No. 19, dated February 19, 1936, created the National Council of Education, with Rafael Palma, former President of the University of the Philippines, as its first chairman. Funds retained from the early approved Residence Certificate Law were devoted to the maintenance of the public schools all over the nation and the opening of many more {{to meet the needs of}} the young people. Indeed, by this time there were already 6,511 primary schools; 1,039 intermediate schools; 133 secondary and special schools; and five junior colleges. The total number of pupils enrolled was 1,262,353, who were placed under the charge of 28,485 schools <b>teachers.</b> <b>That</b> year's appropriation for public education amounted to 14,566,850 pesos. The private institutions of learning, for their part, accommodated more than ninety seven thousand students, thus considerably aiding the government in solving the annual school crisis. To implement the pertinent constitutional provision, the Office of Adult Education was also created.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, Dover Area School District {{agreed to}} {{participate}} in a pilot program to develop a new way to evaluate <b>teachers</b> <b>that,</b> in part, takes into account student achievement. Several other York County school districts also participated. The pilot program had 104 K-12 entities, including: nine career and technical centers, nine charter schools and nine intermediate units. Beginning in January 2012, York County some schools will use the new evaluation method and provide feedback to the Department of Education. This new evaluation will not be used to determine an educator’s official 2011-12 assessment. Under the new evaluation system, 50% of the evaluation of a teacher will be based on an observation divided into four categories: planning and preparation, classroom environment, instruction, and professional responsibilities. The other half will be based on student achievement (15 percent will be building-level data, 15 percent will be teacher-specific data, and 20 percent will be elective). The new evaluation system has both announced and unannounced observations. The system includes meetings between the teacher and evaluator before and after the direct observation of a lesson.|$|E

500|$|Critics {{also pointed}} to the {{dominance}} of Warren Thomson, who single-handedly chose the repertoire and all the jurors, {{many of whom are}} associated with the Australian Institute of Music (AIM), of which he was Artistic Director, Professional Development Programs. With assistance from others, he also auditioned all the entrants, and chose the 36 competitors. Alexei Yemtsov, a competitor at the 2000 competition, lived in Thomson's home and Thomson became his official guardian. That year, the minimum age was lowered from 18 to 17, although Thomson denied it {{had anything to do with}} Yemtsov's being only 17 at the time. The pianist Simon Tedeschi has said he [...] "has no intention of ever collaborating with Thomson and SIPCA ... The school of pianism with which he associates himself is not to my taste ... The trained-seal mentality makes for poor musicianship, and, ultimately, unhappy lives". Margaret Hair, AIM's former head of keyboard studies, said: [...] "There's a feeling among <b>teachers</b> <b>that</b> with Warren [...] in charge, Australian students have little chance of making the final cut. The most tragic outcome of his effect on the piano scene in this country is a sense of hopelessness that most students now feel".|$|E

500|$|At age six, Andrić began primary school. He later recounted {{that these}} were the happiest days of his life. At the age of ten, he {{received}} a three-year scholarship from a Croat cultural group called Napredak (Progress) to study in Sarajevo. In the autumn of 1902, he was registered at the Great Sarajevo Gymnasium (...) , the oldest secondary school in Bosnia. While in Sarajevo, Andrić lived with his mother, who worked in a rug factory. At the time, the city was overflowing with civil servants {{from all parts of}} Austria-Hungary, and thus many languages could be heard in its restaurants, cafés and on its streets. Culturally, the city boasted a strong Germanic element, and the curriculum in educational institutions was designed to reflect this. From a total of 83 <b>teachers</b> <b>that</b> worked at Andrić's school over a twenty-year period, only three were natives of Bosnia and Herzegovina. [...] "The teaching program," [...] biographer Celia Hawkesworth notes, [...] "was devoted to producing dedicated supporters of the [...] Monarchy." [...] Andrić disapproved. [...] "All that came... at secondary school and university," [...] he wrote, [...] "was rough, crude, automatic, without concern, faith, humanity, warmth or love." ...|$|E
500|$|The lyrics were {{inspired}} by {{the first week of}} live shows of The X Factor (UK) where Little Mix were the favourites to be eliminated and felt disheartened by hearing the odds in the show's green room. Group member Jesy Nelson also recalled, [...] "the paps waiting outside to shoot us were all shouting 'See you on This Morning on Monday' because that's where the losers go. I was like: 'Oh, right, thanks!'" [...] Further inspiration came from Nelson who as an aspiring singer was told by her <b>teachers</b> <b>that</b> she would end up working at Tesco. Little Mix also wrote the song as an uplifting message for their fans. Nelson said, [...] "There's nothing wrong with writing songs about clubs and partying but I think it's cool to do a song with meaning." [...] Prior to [...] "Wings", the group had been vocal about standing up to bullying and wanted the song to have a similar message that listeners would be able to relate to. However, they did not want it to sound cheesy or as if they were preaching and instead wrote it with a theme of maternal advice.|$|E
500|$|The Lindwall {{brothers}} {{returned to}} their home in Hurstville, where Ray henceforth attempted to emulate Larwood. He wanted to replicate the physical threat posed by Larwood to batsmen, {{as well as the}} dynamic batting of McCabe. Lindwall attempted to copy Larwood's action in his routine street cricket matches, before terrorising his classmates at primary school. Lindwall said that [...] "he was the most famous fast bowler in the world and I naturally wanted to copy him". Lindwall's formal cricket education began the following year when he commenced his secondary schooling at Marist Brothers Kogarah. The school had <b>teachers</b> <b>that</b> had a habit of scouting around for athletic boys who could bring sporting honour to the institution. The headmaster, Brother Aidan O'Keefe, was a competent player and invested time into training Lindwall. O'Keefe taught Lindwall batting repertoire while also encouraging him to remain aggressive. He taught Lindwall to add accuracy and variation to his raw speed. By the age of 13, Lindwall was leading the under-15 school team, opening both the batting and bowling. Aged 14, Lindwall played in two distinct Saturday competitions – in the morning against schoolboys and with adults in the afternoon in a B-grade competition with Carlton Waratahs. On one outing, he scored 219 and an unbeaten 110 in two different matches on the same day.|$|E
