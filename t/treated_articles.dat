40|$|This Note explores EPA’s {{statutory}} {{authority to regulate}} pesticides, and the policies EPA has adopted to regulate pesticides used to preserve consumer products. The use of nanosilver—small particles of silver under 100 nanometers (nm) —as an antimicrobial pesticide has brought some recent attention to EPA’s policies on articles treated with pesticides. Some public health and environmental advocates {{have been critical of}} EPA for approving the use of nanosilver as an antimicrobial in textiles and other consumer products. In general, advocates are concerned that nano-scale particles might have increased toxicity due to their size—that the tiny particles may pass through membranes and organs that ordinarily filter and block pollutants, and then accumulate in places that larger particles cannot. There is a mixed scientific literature on the toxicity profile of nano-scale particles, but nanosilver has at least the same toxicity as non-nanosilver and there are some indications of greater toxicity. In Section I, this Note documents some of the toxicity issues with nanosilver. Section II discusses those concerns within the regulatory framework EPA uses to assess and regulate pesticide risks. Section III discusses the <b>treated</b> <b>articles</b> exemption to FIFRA and how the lack of hazard labeling under the exemption could run counter to the statutory provision that allows for regulatory exemptions to “carry out the purposes of [the Act]. ” Section IV explores the history of the <b>treated</b> <b>articles</b> exemption, and argues the exemption does not represent a statutory limitation and can be challenged with proposals to label downstream <b>treated</b> <b>articles.</b> This perspective prioritizes EPA’s mandate to prevent adverse effects on human health and the environment, and does not prioritize society’s interest in rapid technological advances in protection from pests. However, even if a reader would allow more benefits from new pesticide products despite increased risks, this Note hopes to satisfy all readers that the <b>treated</b> <b>articles</b> exemption is not a statutory limitation of FIFRA itself. This Note aims to provide historical context for the <b>treated</b> <b>articles</b> exemption to explain the exemption’s statutory parameters. Hopefully, this Note will be helpful in efforts to allow more information to pass to consumers in the marketing and labeling of <b>treated</b> <b>articles,</b> and to help consumers better understand the technologies in our products, and the risks and benefits of pesticides in our products...|$|E

40|$|Antimicrobial {{additives}} {{are used}} {{in a number of}} products available to the consumer. Some manufacturers promote the incorporation of these products into their carpets as preservatives, while other manufacturers do not. The intent {{of this paper is to}} discuss some of the regulatory requirements applicable to the use of these treatments, types of treatments that are used, pertinent test methods, and the role of proper maintenance in controlling bio-contaminants in indoor environments. All antimicrobial treatments are regulated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. For EPA registration, these antimicrobial preservatives must undergo extensive toxicological assessments. The EPA <b>Treated</b> <b>Articles</b> Exemption (EPA PR Notice 2000 - 1) states that articles treated with an EPA-registered product may make claims only related to protection of the treated article against bacterial- or mold-related odors and staining. No implicit human health claims may be made unless the finished treated article (itself) is EPA registered. This EPA regulatory clarification is key in curbing overzealous marketing claims regarding the intended function of the antimicrobial treatment. Currently, there are no carpets registered as finished <b>treated</b> <b>articles,</b> therefore n...|$|E

Mixtures of active substances were added to commercially available paints by producers {{according to the requirements}} of this study. Therefore, liquid formulations were used although a number of modern paints now contain microencapsulated active substances. The textile was treated in an industrial procedure by the producer using an impregnation material that contains biocides. The contents of the active substances were confirmed by chemical analysis of the product.|$|E

30|$|Leaching under {{weathering}} conditions proceeds discontinuously {{and tends}} to decrease with duration of exposure. It does not only mainly depend {{on the availability of}} water but is also controlled by transport processes within the materials and stability of the observed substances. Runoff amount proved to be a suitable basis to compare results from different experiments. Concentrations of substances are higher in runoff collected from vertical surfaces compared to horizontal ones, whereas the leached amounts per surface area are higher from horizontal surfaces. Gaps in mass balances indicate that additional processes such as degradation and evaporation may be relevant to the fate of active substances in <b>treated</b> <b>articles.</b> Leached amounts of substances were considerably higher when the materials were exposed to intermittent water contact under laboratory conditions as compared to weathering of vertically exposed surfaces.|$|E

The procedure became the basis for harmonization within CEN, resulting in the Technical Report CEN/TR 16663 : 2014 [14] that also refers to preservative-treated wood. The basic principle of this procedure was tested for <b>treated</b> <b>articles</b> that contain other biocidal products than wood preservatives (PT 8, as defined in the BPR) during the research project and proved to be suitable for coatings that include film preservatives (PT 7) and a textile including a PT 9 product (fibre, leather, rubber and polymerized materials preservative). Therefore, a guidance document [15] was prepared and adopted by European competent authorities together with guidance on a laboratory method [16] for testing of biocidal products that belong to PT 7, PT 9 and PT 10 (construction material preservatives).|$|E

30|$|Antiviral {{activity}} of silver ions has been recorded, and interaction with -SH groups has {{been implicated in}} the mode of action. The association of silver nanoparticles with the envelope of certain viruses has been suggested to prevent them from being infective. Much of the research into the mechanism of action of silver ions has been associated with its use as a therapeutic agent especially as a topical dressing on burns. The concentration employed in and released from <b>treated</b> <b>articles</b> is significantly lower than in these applications. Under such conditions, {{it has been suggested that}} in many cases, the concentration of silver ions available following hydration of the surface of a treated article is too low to produce antimicrobial activity associated with many of the mechanisms described above. However, silver ions have been demonstrated to interact with the proteins and possibly phospholipids associated with the proton pump of bacterial membranes. This results in a collapse of the membrane proton gradient causing a disruption of many of the mechanisms of cellular metabolism and hence cell death. Silver ions clearly do not possess a single mode of action. They interact with a wide range of molecular processes within microorganisms resulting in a range of effects from the inhibition of growth, loss of infectivity to cell death. The mechanism depends on both the concentration of silver ions present and the sensitivity of the microbial species to silver. Contact time, temperature, pH and the presence of free water all impact on both the rate and extent of antimicrobial activity[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16].|$|E

Atto did not disapprove of this due to the actual ‘selling’ of holy articles, however. It was said that once restored to its original purpose, the cloth used to bear the dead would be tainted and pollute the altar and Mass it was meant to serve.
