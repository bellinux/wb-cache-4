2500|$|Although differing {{from the}} design {{originally}} laid down (see Regulatory Signs below), [...] "Keep Left" [...] and [...] "Keep Right" [...] signs are now mostly white {{on a blue}} background, on the British pattern. In order to avail themselves of standard designs from British suppliers, local authorities had made extensive use of the white-on-blue design, mostly because the electronically lit type of white-on-blue was more practical, in consequence of which legislation was enacted making both patterns legal. Under the Irish Power of One (energy conservation campaign) the electronic signs are being gradually replaced by reflective signs. The former [...] "No Entry" [...] sign, a prohibititon sign with an upward pointing arrow, was replaced with <b>the</b> <b>international</b> standard <b>red</b> disk in TSM 2010. However the older version, now termed [...] "No Straight Ahead", may be used when combined with a time or other restriction.|$|R
5|$|Along with <b>the</b> <b>International</b> <b>Red</b> Cross and Red Crescent Movement, the UN {{often takes}} {{a leading role}} in {{co-ordinating}} emergency relief. The World Food Programme (WFP), created in 1961, provides food aid in response to famine, natural disasters, and armed conflict. The organization reports that it feeds an average of 90 million people in 80 nations each year. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), established in 1950, works {{to protect the rights of}} refugees, asylum seekers, and stateless people. UNHCR and WFP programmes are funded by voluntary contributions from governments, corporations, and individuals, though the UNHCR's administrative costs are paid for by the UN's primary budget.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, Sikorski became Prime Minister of the Polish Government in Exile, Commander-in-Chief of the Polish Armed Forces, and a {{vigorous}} {{advocate of the}} Polish cause in the diplomatic sphere. He supported the reestablishment of diplomatic relations between Poland and the Soviet Union, which had been severed after the Soviet pact with Germany and the 1939 invasion of Poland— however, Soviet leader Joseph Stalin broke off Soviet-Polish diplomatic relations in April 1943 following Sikorski's request that <b>the</b> <b>International</b> <b>Red</b> Cross investigate the Katyń Forest massacre.|$|E
5|$|Following the hurricane, <b>the</b> <b>International</b> <b>Red</b> Cross and Red Crescent Movement {{launched}} an emergency appeal for Cuba. The appeal raised $217,498 (1999 CHF) to supply hygiene items, household goods, water purification tablets, and water containers to the 12,000 living in temporary shelters. The appeal asked for repair supplies {{and to improve}} the response capacity of the national society for future disasters. The Cuban Red Cross mobilized over 4,500 volunteers to the affected areas to provide first aid to injured, distribute meals and medical supplies, and collaborate with blood banks. The government-controlled media broadcast system guaranteed repair items, though many people remained in damaged houses {{in the weeks after}} the storm.|$|E
25|$|Rosso Corsa is <b>the</b> <b>red</b> <b>international</b> motor racing {{color of}} cars entered by teams from Italy. Since the 1920s Italian race cars of Alfa Romeo, Maserati, Lancia, and later Ferrari and Abarth have been painted with a color known as rosso corsa ("racing red").

40|$|Objective: To {{retrospectively}} {{evaluate the}} open reduction internal fixation and {{total hip arthroplasty}} directions, results and complications associated with internal fixation in managing these fractures. Methods: In 8 years at 4 centers, 61 patients with associated acetabular fractures (Letournel classification) were treated. The patients {{were divided into two}} groups. The total hip arthoplasty (THA) group consisted of 30 patients, while the open reduction internal fixation group had 31 patients. The average age of the patients was 74. 7 years. The following parameters were compared: the duration of surgery and hospitalization, <b>the</b> <b>international</b> unit of <b>red</b> blood cell concentrate transfusion, the time for the verticalization of the patient, perioperative complications, Harris hip score, and the short form (12) health survey. The clinical and radiographic follow-up was performed at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months and annually thereafter. Patients with post-traumatic osteoarthritis formed the third comparison group. P ≤ 0. 05 was considered statistically significant according to the analytical Student’s t-test. Results: The P < 0. 05 in favor of the THA group was: surgical time, length of stay, number of <b>the</b> <b>international</b> unit of <b>red</b> blood cell concentrate transfusions, verticalization, quality of life and hip function, a reduction of perioperative complications and reinterventions. Conclusions: Our experience shows that the THA treatment for acetabular fractures in the elderly is to be preferred...|$|R
5000|$|Koussa {{is further}} {{credited}} by the CIA, British MI6, {{as well as}} French Intelligence Services for unraveling a labyrinth of Islamic radical and fundamentalist cells and movements in neighboring Sudan, Niger, Mali, and Chad. Such groups would {{come to be known}} as Al-Qaeda. On 16 March 1998, five months before the Al-Qaeda bombings of the US Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, Libya ordered the first alert to Interpol for the capture of Osama Bin Laden, a fact unbeknown to the wider public. The warrant was forwarded to Interpol in France, where it was formalized on 15 April 1998.In 2004, George Tenet credited Libya for issuing <b>the</b> first <b>international</b> <b>red</b> notice Interpol alert and arrest warrant for Osama Bin Laden. Koussa was also credited for negotiating Libya's decision to give up its WMD program thus facilitating Libya's reintegration into <b>the</b> <b>international</b> community. US diplomatic cables released by Wikileaks reveal that the U.S. viewed Moussa Koussa as a character of high interest with a combination of intellectual acumen, operational ability, and political weight. [...] Oliver Miles, a former British ambassador to Tripoli, stated Koussa is [...] "straightforward and reliable ... I found him a perfectly reasonable person to deal with." [...] Another leaked cable described him as [...] "a useful and powerful interlocutor who has been mostly cooperative in liaison channels and key to our re-engagement." ...|$|R
5|$|In April 1943, the Polish government-in-exile led by Sikorski {{insisted on}} {{bringing}} {{the matter to}} the negotiation table with the Soviets and on opening an investigation by <b>the</b> <b>International</b> <b>Red</b> Cross. Stalin, in response, accused the Polish government of collaborating with Nazi Germany and broke off diplomatic relations with it. The Soviet Union also started a campaign to get the Western Allies to recognize the pro-Soviet government-in-exile of the Union of Polish Patriots led by Wanda Wasilewska. Sikorski died in an air crash in July—an event that was convenient for the Allied leaders.|$|E

Moshe Russnak, commander of the Haganah in the Old City, ignored his request, knowing that if the Hurva fell, {{the battle for the}} Jewish Quarter would soon be lost. On May 26, 1948, the Jordanian Arab Legion delivered an ultimatum to the Jews to surrender within 12 hours; otherwise the Hurva would be bombarded.|$|E
5|$|After Babs {{passed the}} hardest hit areas, workers were {{initially}} unable to distribute food and medicine due to ferry service being halted. Many provinces and islands were isolated after the storm, necessitating helicopter travel to be reached by national aid workers. The Department of Public Works and Highways worked quickly to clear the landslides and reopen closed roads. The country's National Food Authority provided about 73,000sacks of rice to storm victims, and the country planned to import 300,000tonnes of rice to overcome the lost crops. The Philippine Red Cross deployed search and rescue teams, as well as distributing food and coffee to 35,500people. <b>The</b> <b>International</b> <b>Red</b> Cross and Red Crescent Movement launched a global request for assistance worth about $2.2million to help 240,000people.|$|E

By September26, about PHP700,000 ($14,000USD) worth of relief supplies had been distributed to the affected areas. At least PHP480,000 ($10,000USD) of the calamity funds were sent to the local governments in Negros Occidental. On September20, the Chinese Government allocated ¥81million ($11.8million USD) in living subsidies for those affected by the typhoon. <b>The</b> <b>International</b> <b>Red</b> Cross, which was already assisting China in recovery from flooding in August, took preparatory measures and worked with local branches to get damage assessments.

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Hazel, a three-day period of national mourning was declared in Haiti for hurricane victims.

The Haitian Red Cross appealed for assistance to <b>the</b> <b>International</b> <b>Red</b> Cross, while the American Red Cross made a donation of $25,000 (1954 USD). Pan American World Airways offered the use of its planes to assist with the delivery of aid, and the US aircraft carrier USS Saipan deployed 18 helicopters to help deliver supplies. Despite the relief effort, there was an outbreak of typhoid fever following Hazel {{due to a lack of}} clean water.|$|E
5|$|Switzerland's {{trade was}} {{blockaded}} {{by both the}} Allies and by the Axis.

Over the course of the war, Switzerland interned over 300,000 refugees and <b>the</b> <b>International</b> <b>Red</b> Cross, based in Geneva, played an important part during the conflict.
