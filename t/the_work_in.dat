5|$|A {{trend towards}} greater {{authenticity}} began after Hammond's orchestrations in the 1970s provided {{a basis for}} staging <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> its original form. This process was further aided by the discovery in the 1990s of Bizet's 1863 conducting score. In this, the orchestral parts were reduced to six staves, but notes and other markings in the manuscript provided additional clues to the original orchestration. These new finds {{became the basis for}} Brad Cohen's critical edition of the score, published by Edition Peters in 2002.|$|E

He had many visitors, including royalty and politicians. Although Vivekananda was unable to attend the Congress of Religions in 1901 in Japan due to deteriorating health, he made pilgrimages to Bodhgaya and Varanasi. Declining health (including asthma, diabetes and chronic insomnia) restricted his activity.|$|E
5|$|Bach led {{the first}} {{performance}} of the cantata on 22 December 1715 in the ducal chapel. He could not revive <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> Leipzig because tempus clausum was observed there during Advent. The cantata {{was first published in}} 1881 in the Bach Gesellschaft edition, edited by Wilhelm Rust.|$|E
30|$|From Table  6, it {{also can}} be seen that only the {{proposed}} architecture and <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>in</b> [17] can support 8 K-UHD video real-time encoding. The hardware costs of <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>in</b> [17] are 1183 k gates, and fractional search module is also included. Therefore, it is difficult to make a fair comparison of hardware resources. For the processing speed of the design, the throughput of the proposed architecture is almost 2.5 times larger than <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>in</b> [17] with 5.26 pixels/cycle. The design delivers a maximum throughput of 2588 Mpixels/s for 7680 [*]×[*] 4320 78 frames/s video application, and <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>in</b> [17] can only achieve a maximum throughput of 995 Mpixels/s for 7680 [*]×[*] 4320 30 frames/s video coding. Compared to <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>in</b> [17], our architecture provides significant speed improvement.|$|R
30|$|In {{terms of}} performance, the {{throughput}} {{of the proposed}} architecture is 13.4  pixels/cycle, which is almost 18 times larger than <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>in</b> [13] with 0.73  pixel/cycle, 6 times larger than <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>in</b> [11] with 2.58  pixels/cycle, and 2 times larger than <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>in</b> [15] with 8.5  pixels/cycle. So the hardware implementation can better adapt to the HEVC standard with larger LCU size. Consequently, the hardware implementation cost of our architecture is comparable to H. 264 /AVC.|$|R

5|$|Bach {{possibly}} led {{the audition}} performance of <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> Leipzig in the Thomaskirche on 7 February 1723, probably after the sermon.

5|$|Bach {{structured}} <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> five movements, alternating arias and recitatives, and {{a closing}} chorale. The scoring requires {{only a small}} ensemble of a soprano soloist, three additional vocal parts for the chorale, and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of oboe, strings and basso continuo. While the first aria is pensive and elegiac, the second aria is of dancing folk-like character.|$|E
5|$|Despite the title, St. John the Baptist Preaching did {{not have}} an {{obviously}} religious theme.

Critics were still mostly dismissive of his work, but the piece finished third in the Salon's sculpture category.|$|E

30|$|In {{terms of}} {{hardware}} resources, the proposed architecture can reduce about 18  % area compared to <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>in</b> [11]. Although <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>in</b> [12] has eight times greater parallelism and can work at higher frequencies than the design in this paper, {{the amount of}} logic resources is also six times greater. The proposed architecture also allows {{for the use of}} a reduced input buffer so that the memory cost can be reduced by 131, 040 bits. Compared with <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>in</b> [13, 16], due to the different targeted video specification, our design consumes more hardware cost. Although hardware cost in [16] is only 28.5 k, memories are not included in the gates’ area. The reconfigurable hardware accelerator engines in [14, 15] are synthesized for the FPGA device and BRAMs are used, so it is difficult to make a fair hardware cost comparison with <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>in</b> [14, 15].|$|R

5|$|A Vision of the Last Judgement is a {{painting}} by William Blake that was designed in 1808 before becoming a lost artwork. The painting was to be shown in an 1810 exhibition with a detailed analysis added to a second edition of his Descriptive Catalogue. This plan was dropped after the exhibition was cancelled, and the painting disappeared. Blake's notes for the Descriptive Catalogue describe various aspects of <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> a detailed manner, which allow the aspects of the painting to be known. Additionally, earlier designs that reveal similar Blake depiction of the Last Judgement have survived, and these date back to an 1805 precursor design created for Robert Blair's The Grave. In addition to Blake's notes on the painting, a letter written to Ozias Humphrey provides {{a description of the}} various images within an earlier design of the Last Judgement.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 112 fictional films {{are known to}} have been {{produced}} in the Dutch East Indies (modern day Indonesia) between 1926 and the colony's dissolution in 1949. The earliest motion pictures, imported from abroad, were shown in late 1900, and by the early 1920s imported serials and fictional films were being shown, often with localised names. Dutch companies were also producing documentary films about the Indies to be shown in the Netherlands. The first reports of fictional film production in the Indies date from 1923, although <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> question was not completed. The first locally produced film, Loetoeng Kasaroeng, was directed by L. Heuveldorp and released on 31 December 1926.|$|E
5|$|After Bethe {{received}} his doctorate, Erwin Madelung offered him an assistantship in Frankfurt, and in September 1928 Bethe {{moved in with}} his father, who had recently divorced his mother. His father met Vera Congehl earlier that year, and married her in 1929. They had two children, Doris, born in 1933, and Klaus, born in 1934. Bethe did not find <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> Frankfurt very stimulating, and in 1929 he accepted an offer from Ewald at the Technische Hochschule in Stuttgart. While there, he wrote what he considered to be his greatest paper, Zur Theorie des Durchgangs schneller Korpuskularstrahlen durch Materie ("The Theory of the Passage of Fast Corpuscular Rays Through Matter"). Starting from Max Born's interpretation of the Schrödinger equation, Bethe produced a simplified formula for collision problems using a Fourier transform, which is known today as the Bethe formula. He submitted this paper for his habilitation in 1930.|$|E
