50|$|Sometime later, Mr. Hitchens and Mr. Rote were demonstrating their AGV {{simulator}} to Conco-Tellus, {{a conveyor}} system manufacturer, {{when they were}} asked if they could build a simulator for conveyor systems. Of course, <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> <b>yes</b> and <b>the</b> Real Time Conveyor Simulator (RTCS) was born. The RTCS was a custom system with 3 single-board computers. They were awarded a patent for it in 1985.|$|R
25|$|Can {{this list}} be made shorter yet? Again <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>yes.</b> To begin with, {{some of the}} above laws are implied {{by some of the}} others. A {{sufficient}} subset of the above laws consists of the pairs of associativity, commutativity, and absorption laws, distributivity of ∧ over ∨ (or the other distributivity law—one suffices), and the two complement laws. In fact this is the traditional axiomatization of Boolean algebra as a complemented distributive lattice.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, 10 years later, {{the same}} poll was repeated. The number of {{researchers}} who answered was 151: 126 (83%) believed the answer to be no, 12 (9%) believed <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>yes,</b> 5 (3%) believed the question may be independent of the currently accepted axioms and therefore impossible to prove or disprove, 8 (5%) said either don't know or don't care or don't want the answer to be yes nor the problem to be resolved.|$|E
25|$|The {{question}} of whether P equals NP {{is one of the}} most important open questions in theoretical computer science because of the wide implications of a solution. If <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>yes,</b> many important problems can be shown to have more efficient solutions. These include various types of integer programming problems in operations research, many problems in logistics, protein structure prediction in biology, and the ability to find formal proofs of pure mathematics theorems. The P versus NP problem is one of the Millennium Prize Problems proposed by the Clay Mathematics Institute. There is a US$1,000,000 prize for resolving the problem.|$|E

The Bast Texas Pine Plantation Research Project (ETPPRP) in a recent investigation addressed this question, and <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> <b>yes.</b> An analysis of the ETPPRP data set produced equations to estimate crown height (the distance from the ground to the first live branch) ...|$|R
50|$|A {{second study}} of {{developmental}} outcomes in DG looked at 3 to 10 year olds {{living in a}} large metropolitan area and asked whether children diagnosed as newborns with DG in this group {{were more likely than}} their unaffected peers to receive special educational services later in childhood. <b>The</b> <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> <b>yes.</b> Specifically, children with DG in this group were significantly more likely than other children to receive a diagnosis of, or special educational services for, a speech/language disorder.|$|R
50|$|There {{have been}} two {{instances}} of litigation regarding interpretation appealed to the New York Court of Appeals, that state's highest court. The first concerned {{the challenge for the}} 1988 America's Cup, where the question was first, whether the Mercury Bay Boating Club was a valid challenger and if the San Diego Yacht Club had to accept their challenge; and second, whether the Defender's boat (a catamaran) complied with the terms of the Deed of Gift. <b>The</b> <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> <b>yes</b> to both questions.|$|R

50|$|When {{digital cameras}} became common, many photographers asked whether their film cameras could be {{converted}} to digital. <b>The</b> <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> <b>yes</b> and no. For the majority of 35 mm film cameras <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> no, <b>the</b> reworking and cost would be too great, especially as lenses have been evolving as well as cameras. For most a conversion to digital, to give enough space for the electronics and allow a liquid crystal display to preview, would require removing {{the back of the}} camera and replacing it with a custom built digital unit.|$|R

2500|$|In another Jewish Daily Forward essay, [...] "Life Among the Goyim," [...] Heinze {{looks at}} the British comedian, Sacha Baron Cohen, and his TV comedy, Da Ali G Show, whose title {{character}} is a parody of a [...] "white wannabe-gangsta rapper who not only adopts all the appropriate clothes, gestures and locutions but also convinces himself that he is black." [...] In his essay, Heinze points out that Baron Cohen is a Jew who speaks Hebrew and keeps kosher; and his undergraduate history thesis at Cambridge University was on black-Jewish relations. Yet, Heinze wonders, is there anything about his comedy that is specifically Jewish? For Heinze, <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>yes,</b> and he arrives at the [...] "yes" [...] in the following whimsical way: [...] "If we take 'goyim' loosely to mean people who are strange, often affable, and potentially dangerous, then, yes, 'Da Ali G Show' is Jewish comedy and we, in our digital phantasmagoria of a world, are all goyim, all on camera, all the time." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "It is {{a widely}} held opinion that {{dyslexia}} is associated with remarkably artistic creativity." [...] This leads to {{us to look at}} art schools {{to see if there are}} high numbers of people who have dyslexia. <b>The</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>yes,</b> there is an unusually high correlation between people with dyslexia and art students. The question should be why? [...] There are speculations that dyslexics have differing brain structures and functions. There tends to be a lack of objective studies that confirm the art and dyslexia relationship. The Wolff and Lundberg article implies that it isn't that easy to get into art school; that people with dyslexia earn their entrance into the art schools on artistic merit, as an easy way out of conventional academics. Corlu, Özcan, and Korkmazlar suggest that further research is a valid research concern. There are studies that seemingly coincide with the concept that people with dyslexia see the world differently. There seems to be evidence that dyslexics have a superior level of visuospatial skill. Gross and Bornstein think that dyslexia might be due to a difficulty in treating mirror images as the same stimulus, when taking into consideration words that are commonly switched, such as god and dog, no and on, and saw and was.|$|E

2500|$|The Face Advantage allows {{information}} and memories to be recalled easier through {{the presentation of}} a person's face rather than a person's voice. Faces and voices are very similar stimuli that reveal similar {{information and}} result in similar processes of memory recall. During face perception, there are three stages of memory recall that include recognition, followed by the remembering of semantic memory and episodic memory, and finally name recall. The Face Advantage is shown through an experiment where participants are presented with faces and voices of unfamiliar faces and recognizable celebrity faces. [...] The stimuli are presented with a between-group design. The participants are asked to say if the face or voice is familiar. If <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>yes,</b> {{they are asked to}} recall semantic and episodic memories and finally the name of the face or voice. It was much easier for those presented with a celebrity's face to recall information than for those presented with a voice. The results show that in the second stage of face perception when memories are recalled, information is recalled faster and more accurate after a face is perceived, and slower, less accurate and with less detail after a voice is perceived. [...] A possible explanation is that the connections between face representations and semantic and episodic memory are stronger than that of voices.|$|E
2500|$|You {{note that}} I and President Joseph Fielding Smith {{and some of}} our early church leaders have said and written about this {{doctrine}} and you asked if the doctrine of blood atonement is an official doctrine of the Church today. If by blood atonement is meant the atoning sacrifice of Christ, <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>Yes.</b> If by blood atonement is meant the shedding of the blood of men to atone in some way for their own sins, the answer is No. We do not believe that it is necessary for men in this day to shed their own blood to receive a remission of sins. This is said with a full awareness of what I and others have written and said on this subject in times past. In order to understand what Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, Charles W. Penrose and others have said, we must mention that there are some sins for which the blood of Christ alone does not cleanse a person. [...] These include blasphemy against the Holy Ghost (as defined by the Church) and that murder which is the unlawful killing of a human being with malice. [...] However, and this cannot be stressed too strongly, this law has not been given to the Church at any time in this dispensation. [...] It has no application whatever to anyone now living whether he is a member or a non-member of the Church.|$|E
2500|$|The song {{received}} {{positive reaction}} from critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called it [...] "a thumping track which sounds funkier, denser, sexier with each spin". Jim Farber of The New York Daily News gave the song a positive review, stating {{that it is}} [...] "everything a single should be. Pithy, simple and maddeningly catchy, it's her most instantly embraceable single since 'Holiday.'" [...] Farber {{goes on to say}} that it is the song's chorus that [...] "kills," [...] and the [...] "power of dance music" [...] theme of the song is used to comment on current trends. In a review of the album, Vibe called the track [...] "a bouncing parade of synthesizers that pose the question 'Do fortysomething baby-mamas still have the divine right to get down?' (<b>The</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>yes).</b> And so, as the vocoders gurgle and the analog synths invoke Zapp, a slowly building crescendo of rhythm announces Madonna's return." [...] Entertainment Weekly said [...] "the song recaptures the simple perfection of [...] "Holiday" [...] (1982) and brings her career full circle." [...] Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine praised the song in a review of the album: [...] " [...] is a retro hands-in-the-air club song reminiscent of Debbie Deb's 'When I Hear Music' and Madonna's own 'Into The Groove'", and called the singer's best dance track since [...] "Vogue", [...] "She sings 'Music makes the people come together' like a track off of her debut album, and as an added bonus she uses words like [...] "bourgeoisie" [...] and [...] "acid-rock" [...] with equal abandon", he completed.|$|E
