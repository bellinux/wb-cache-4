5|$|Initially <b>the</b> <b>camps</b> housed {{political}} opponents; over time, undesirable {{members of}} German society—criminals, vagrants, deviants—were placed in <b>the</b> <b>camps</b> as well. A Hitler decree issued in December 1937 {{allowed for the}} incarceration of anyone deemed by the regime to be an undesirable member of society. This included Jews, Gypsies, communists, and those persons of any other cultural, racial, political, or religious affiliation deemed by the Nazis to be Untermensch (sub-human). Thus, <b>the</b> <b>camps</b> became a mechanism for social and racial engineering. By the outbreak of World War II in autumn 1939, there were six camps housing some 27,000 inmates. Death tolls were high.|$|E

5|$|Following the RPF victory, {{approximately}} two million Hutu fled to {{refugee camps in}} neighbouring countries, particularly Zaire, fearing RPF reprisals for the Rwandan genocide. <b>The</b> <b>camps</b> were crowded and squalid, and thousands of refugees died in disease epidemics, including cholera and dysentery. <b>The</b> <b>camps</b> were {{set up by the}} United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), but were effectively controlled by the army and government of the former Hutu regime, including many leaders of the genocide, who began rearming in a bid to return to power in Rwanda.|$|E

5|$|The first camp {{opened on}} May 15, 1941 near Baltimore, Maryland. A total of 152 camps and units were {{established}} {{over the next}} six years. The federal government provided work projects, housing, camp furnishings and paid for transportation to <b>the</b> <b>camps.</b> The responsibilities of the churches included day-to-day management of <b>the</b> <b>camps,</b> subsistence costs, meals and healthcare for the men.

50|$|The {{discrepancy}} regarding <b>the</b> <b>camp's</b> {{population is}} influenced by several issues, most significant of which are the disagreements over the accepted dimensions of <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> and <b>the</b> status of unregistered residents. Residents of <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> are not taxed on their properties within <b>the</b> <b>camp,</b> and this results in disagreements as <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> community's population and geographical size continue to grow. The tax policy regarding <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> {{has resulted in the}} immigration of Palestinians who are not registered refugees with UNRWA. Accurate figures for these immigrants is non available.|$|R
5|$|After the Anschluss, the Austrian SS was {{folded into}} SS-Oberabschnitt Donau. The third {{regiment}} of the SS-Verfügungstruppe (Der Führer) {{and the fourth}} Totenkopf regiment (Ostmark) were recruited in Austria shortly thereafter. On Heydrich's orders, mass arrests of potential enemies of the Reich began immediately after the Anschluss. Mauthausen was the first concentration camp opened in Austria following the Anschluss. Before {{the invasion of the}} Soviet Union, Mauthausen was the harshest of <b>the</b> <b>camps</b> in the Greater German Reich.|$|E
5|$|By this time, on {{both the}} Eastern and Western Front, the {{activities}} of the SS were becoming clear to the Allies, as the concentration and extermination camps were being overrun.

5|$|Bánáthy later {{traded for}} milk to give two-year-old Béla and one-year-old László enough protein. As {{extremely}} little food {{was available in}} <b>the</b> <b>camps,</b> in early 1947 his wife's twin sister came from Hungary to take their older two sons back {{to live with the}} older sister. The Pallendal family, Bánáthy's in-laws, was well-educated and relatively wealthy, so they had access to more food than what was available in <b>the</b> <b>camps.</b> They intended to return the Banathy boys to their parents within a year. Beginning in early 1948, when the Cold War ensued, it became virtually impossible for refugees or displaced persons to cross from the border of one country into another, or even from one Occupation Zone to another. The Pallendal family could not return the two boys from behind the Iron Curtain.|$|E

5|$|Civilian Public Service {{men were}} {{released}} from their assignments and <b>the</b> <b>camps</b> closed during March 1947, nineteen {{months after the}} end of the war in the Pacific.

The approximate distribution of men throughout <b>the</b> <b>camps</b> was as follows: Kozelsk, 5000; Ostashkov, 6570; and Starobelsk, 4000. They totalled 15,570 men.|$|E
5|$|The British Government had {{expected}} {{the campaign to}} be over within months, and the protracted war became increasingly unpopular especially after revelations about the conditions in the concentration camps. Emily Hobhouse, a campaigner, had forced the British Government {{to set up the}} Fawcett Commission, led by suffragist Millicent Fawcett, into the conditions at <b>the</b> <b>camps.</b> Hobhouse published reports from <b>the</b> <b>camps</b> which told of thousands of deaths from disease and malnutrition. These reports helped to sway public opinion against the war. The demand for peace led to a settlement of hostilities, and in 1902, the Treaty of Vereeniging was signed. The two republics were absorbed into the British Empire, although the British were forced to make a number of concessions and reparations to the Boers. The granting of limited autonomy for the area ultimately led to the establishment of the Union of South Africa.|$|E
5000|$|Holt Scout Ranch (now closed) was an SGVC <b>camp</b> {{located in}} <b>the</b> San Bernardino Mountains. <b>The</b> <b>camp</b> was {{named in honor}} of Herbert Brayton Holt on June 15, 1968.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>camp</b> {{was blessed}} with an {{abundance}} of academic and creative talent, which was only too willing to teach and learn in <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> environment where they had little else with which to fill their time. Within weeks of <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> opening, having already set up such institutions in their previous transit <b>camps,</b> <b>the</b> internees set up <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> ‘university’. This operated in a building {{on the north side of}} the square, marked as ‘lecture house’ in a map of <b>the</b> <b>camp</b> published in an edition of <b>The</b> <b>Camp.</b> Lectures were also held on the law in good weather or in people’s individual rooms for smaller classes.|$|R
5|$|The camp dietitian, {{with the}} help of men {{assigned}} as cooks, prepared all of the meals. Camps with large gardens provided their own fresh vegetables.

5|$|The {{retreating}} Muslim {{army was}} met by the ferocious Arab women in <b>the</b> <b>camps.</b> Led by Hind, the Muslim women dismantled their tents and armed with tent poles charged at their husbands and fellow men singing an improvised song from the Battle of Uhud that then had been directed against the Muslims.|$|E
5|$|The {{security}} and police officials selected to run <b>the</b> <b>camps</b> of Operation Reinhard were among Heydrich's closest professional contacts.

25|$|Sretensk was a Russian prisoner-of-war camp {{established}} in October 1914 {{with the intent}} of housing Central Powers' troops captured during the course of World War I. <b>The</b> <b>camp</b> was situated in the city of Sretensk and combined barracks and private residences to house the internees.

Building work began there in the winter and the gates opened to campers on 18 June 1966. Butlin retired in 1969 and the Barry Island camp was the last opening under his management.|$|E
5|$|By 1944, the SS-TV {{had been}} {{organized}} into three divisions: {{staff of the}} concentration camps in Germany and Austria, in the occupied territories, and of the extermination camps in Poland. By 1944, it became standard practice to rotate SS members {{in and out of}} <b>the</b> <b>camps,</b> partly based on manpower needs, but also to provide easier assignments to wounded Waffen-SS members. This rotation of personnel meant that nearly the entire SS {{knew what was going on}} inside the concentration camps, making the entire organization liable for war crimes and crimes against humanity.|$|E
5|$|Civilian Public Service men {{lived in}} barracks-style camps, such as former Civilian Conservation Corps facilities. <b>The</b> <b>camps</b> {{served as a}} base of operations, from which the COs {{departed}} to their daily assignments. Sites were located typically in rural areas near the agricultural, soil conservation and forestry projects where the work took place. A large camp such as number 57 near Hill City, South Dakota, had five dormitories and housed as many as 172 men building the Deerfield Dam. Later, with projects located in urban areas, the men lived in smaller units, communal housing near their assignments. CPS men typically worked nine hours, six days per week.|$|E
