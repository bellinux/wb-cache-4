5000|$|In pop-up or {{automatic}} toasters, {{bread slices}} are inserted vertically into the slots (generally only {{large enough to}} admit a single slice of bread each) {{on the top of}} the toaster. A lever on the side of the toaster is pressed, activating the toaster. When an internal device determines that the toasting cycle is complete, the toaster turns off and the toast pops up out of the slots. The heating elements of a pop-up toaster are usually oriented vertically, parallel to the bread slice - although there are some variations.In earlier days, the completion of the toasting operation was determined by a mechanical clockwork timer; the user could adjust the running time of the timer to determine the degree of [...] "doneness" [...] of the toast, but the first cycle produced less toasted toast than subsequent cycles because the toaster was not yet warmed up. Toasters made since the 1930s frequently use a thermal sensor, such as a bimetallic strip, located close to the toast. This allows the first cycle to run longer than subsequent cycles. The <b>thermal</b> <b>device</b> is also slightly responsive to the actual temperature of the toast itself. Like the timer, it can be adjusted by the user to determine the [...] "doneness" [...] of the toast.|$|E

30|$|Boiling is {{a general}} {{mechanism}} in heat transfer systems, such as those used to cool electronic devices and power plant systems.

Therefore, to transfer or dissipate high heat flux from heat sources in real-world applications, thermal devices and systems should have high BHT and CHF.

Most recently, boiling experiments with treated surfaces have been used extensively to study the effect of heating surface characteristics on BHT and CHF.|$|E
40|$|Blood {{irradiation}} can {{be performed}} using a dedicated blood irradiator or a teletherapy unit. A <b>thermal</b> <b>device</b> providing appropriate storage conditions during blood components irradiation with a teletherapy unit has been recently proposed. However, the most appropriated volume of the <b>thermal</b> <b>device</b> was not indicated. The goal {{of this study was}} to indicate the most appropriated blood volume for irradiation using a teletherapy unit in order to minimize both the dose heterogeneity in the volume and the blood irradiation time using these equipments. Theoretical and experimental methods were used to study the dose distribution in the blood volume irradiated using a linear accelerator and a cobalt- 60 therapy machine. The calculation of absorbed doses in the middle plane of cylindrical acrylic volumes was accomplished by a treatment planning system. Experimentally, we also used cylindrical acrylic phantoms and thermoluminescent dosimeters to confirm the calculated doses. The data obtained were represented by isodose curves. We observed that an irradiation volume should have a height of 28 cm and a diameter of 28 cm and a height of 35 cm and a diameter of 35 cm, when the irradiation is to be performed by a linear accelerator and a cobalt- 60 teletherapy unit, respectively. Calculated values of relative doses varied from 93 % to 100 % in the smaller volume, and from 66 % to 100 % in the largest one. A difference of 5. 0 %, approximately, was observed between calculated and experimental data. The size of these volumes permits the irradiation of blood bags in only one bath without compromising the homogeneity of the absorbed dose over the irradiated volume. Thus, these irradiation volumes can be recommend to minimize the irradiation time when a teletherapy unit is used to irradiate blood. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

40|$|As {{transistor}} gate lengths are scaled to 50 nm and below <b>thermal</b> <b>device</b> design {{is becoming an}} important part of microprocessor engineering. Decreasing dimensions lead to nanometer-scale hot spots in the transistor drain region, which may increase the drain series and source injection electrical resistances. Such trends are accelerated with the introduction of novel materials and non-traditional transistor geometries, like ultra-thin body, FinFET, or nanowire devices, which impede heat conduction. Thermal analysis is complicated by sub-continuum phenomena including ballistic electron transport, which displaces and reshapes the hot spot region compared with classical diffusion theory predictions. Ballistic phonon transport from the hot spot and between material boundaries impedes conduction cooling. The increased surface to volume ratio of novel transistor designs also leads to a larger contribution from material boundary thermal resistance.
