5|$|May 13, 1972: Near Bean Station, Tennessee, between Knoxville and Bristol, a Greyhound Scenicruiser on a {{scheduled}} trip from Memphis to New York City collided head-on with a <b>tractor-trailer</b> <b>truck.</b> The {{driver of the}} bus had begun to pass a car. Fourteen people, including both the bus and truck drivers, died. The National Transportation Safety Board determined {{that the cause of}} the crash was the Greyhound driver's overtaking maneuver and his failure to avoid the truck.|$|E
2500|$|On July 16, 1981, Chapin {{was driving}} in the left lane on the Long Island Expressway at about 65mph (105km/h) {{on the way to}} perform at a free concert {{scheduled}} for later that evening at Eisenhower Park in East Meadow, New York. Near exit 40 in Jericho, he put on his emergency flashers, presumably because of either a mechanical or medical problem (possibly a heart attack). He then slowed to about [...] per hour and veered into the center lane, nearly colliding with another car. He swerved left, then to the right again, ending up directly in the path of a <b>tractor-trailer</b> <b>truck.</b> The truck could not brake in time and rammed the rear of Chapin's blue 1975 Volkswagen Rabbit, rupturing the fuel tank as it climbed up and {{over the back of the}} car, which burst into flames.|$|E
50|$|Ural-375S was a <b>tractor-trailer</b> <b>truck</b> with {{framework}} shortened to 5.3'.|$|E
50|$|The {{standards}} and upkeep of rest areas facilities vary. Rest areas also have parking areas allotted for buses, <b>tractor-trailer</b> <b>trucks</b> (big rigs), and recreational vehicles.|$|R
50|$|Many {{territory}} bands from NOS {{traveled in}} sleeper trailers connected to <b>tractor-trailer</b> <b>trucks.</b> The most popular sleeper was manufactured by Wilson Body Company in Sioux City, IA. They were purchased, owned, and {{maintained by the}} orchestras. Lawrence Welk {{is thought to have}} been the first to design and use a sleeper.|$|R
5|$|In 2007, two <b>tractor-trailer</b> <b>trucks</b> {{collided}} in {{a tunnel}} along the truck lanes for southbound I-5 at the interchange. A resulting fire started, soon encompassing the entire tunnel along with 30 other trucks and one passenger vehicle {{that were in}} the tunnel at the time. The truck tunnel was closed for several days for structural damage inspections and repairs.|$|R
5000|$|The {{number of}} wheels {{on the most}} common type of North American <b>tractor-trailer</b> <b>truck,</b> which are hence often called 18-wheelers.|$|E
5000|$|Power-ups {{can also}} be {{obtained}} by interacting with certain objects at specific points in the level, e.g. the <b>tractor-trailer</b> <b>truck</b> in Spy Hunter.|$|E
50|$|Mechanical Concrete is strong. A tire-derived geo-cylinder {{filled with}} crushed {{limestone}} or similar aggregate produces 150 {{pounds per square}} inch (10.8 tons per square foot) working-strength material. <b>Tractor-trailer</b> <b>truck</b> tires at maximum legal weight generate 100 {{pounds per square inch}} of vertical pressure.|$|E
50|$|U.S. Route 41 (US 41) is a United States Numbered Highway {{that runs}} from Miami, Florida, to Copper Harbor, Michigan. In Tennessee, the highway is paralleled by Interstate 24 {{all the way from}} Georgia to Kentucky, and I-24 has largely supplanted US-41 as a major highway, {{especially}} for large and heavy vehicles, such as <b>tractor-trailer</b> <b>trucks</b> and buses.|$|R
50|$|The New Jersey Turnpike Authority {{developed}} and tested a similar, but heavily reinforced, design. This barrier design has {{been credited with}} effectively containing and redirecting larger vehicles, including semi-trailer (<b>tractor-trailer)</b> <b>trucks.</b> The states of New York, Massachusetts, and New Jersey have adopted the taller barrier for their roads, {{as compared to the}} standard 32 in suggested by the Federal Highway Administration.|$|R
50|$|U.S. Route 64 Truck (US 64 Truck) follows US 23 from Franklin to Dillsboro, then east {{following}} US 74 to Hendersonville, for a {{total of}} 80.8 mi. Signage is not primary, US 64 Truck signs are typically located on the side of major junction changes indicating direction of route. <b>Tractor-trailer</b> <b>trucks</b> are prohibited to use mainline US 64 between Franklin and Brevard.|$|R
50|$|On October 6, 2008, Belcher {{was killed}} in a traffic {{accident}} in Edmonson County, Kentucky when his pickup truck ran {{into the back of a}} stopped <b>tractor-trailer</b> <b>truck</b> on Interstate 65. The tractor-trailer driver, Mary Wasson of Texas, was not injured in the crash.|$|E
50|$|On July 23, 2009, {{brothers}} Stone Weeks, 24, and Holt Weeks, 20, {{both students}} at Rice University, were killed on Interstate 81 in Shenandoah County, Virginia, when a <b>tractor-trailer</b> <b>truck</b> struck their car, {{resulting in a}} multi-vehicle collision. The brothers were traveling to their parentsâ€™ home in Rockville, Maryland, from Houston, Texas.|$|E
5000|$|The ZIL-131 is {{a general}} purpose 3.5 tons 6x6 army truck {{designed}} in the Soviet Union by ZIL. The basic model being a general cargo truck. Variants include a <b>tractor-trailer</b> <b>truck,</b> a dump truck, a fuel truck, and a 6x6 for towing a 4-wheeled powered trailer. The ZIL-131 {{also serves as a}} platform for the 9P138 rocket launcher, a 30-tube variant of the BM-21 [...] "Grad".|$|E
25|$|Because of its height, the narrowness of the spans (there are no hard shoulders), the low guardrails, and the {{frequency}} of high winds, it is {{known as one of the}} scariest bridges in the world, especially in higher <b>tractor-trailer</b> <b>trucks.</b> Several incidents related to the bridge have occurred. In some cases, these have caused significant closures and traffic congestion on either side approaching the bridge.|$|R
2500|$|PMC {{regularly}} offered International Harvester trucks, mainly pickups. A 1947 International {{pickup truck}} {{may have been}} the first PMC model offered, {{and one of the first}} plastic promotional models, period (Hover 2010). It was made slightly larger than the normal 1:25 scale. Some reproductions of IH's brand of Farmall tractors were also offered as promotionals, some hauling a McCormick-Deering trailer (Timm 2010, PMC Farm Tractors page). An International TD-24 bulldozer was made in a promo/toy version and also in remote control. Several Diamond-T semi <b>tractor-trailer</b> <b>trucks</b> (Diamond-T had been purchased by International) were also made, one in Mayflower livery (Timm 2010, PMC Gallery Diamond T).|$|R
50|$|In North America, local {{delivery}} {{trucks with}} an average cylinder size of 3,000 gal, fill up large cylinders that are permanently installed on the property, or other service trucks exchange empty cylinders of propane with filled cylinders. Large <b>tractor-trailer</b> <b>trucks,</b> {{with an average}} cylinder size of 10,000 gal, transport the propane from the pipeline or refinery to the local bulk plant. The bobtail and transport are not unique to the North American market, though the practice is not as common elsewhere, and the vehicles are generally called tankers. In many countries, propane is delivered to consumers via small or medium-sized individual cylinders, while empty cylinders are removed for refilling at a central location.|$|R
50|$|He {{had become}} a non-person to the {{mainstream}} Western media. Zhang's death, {{in a car accident}} in the United States at the age of 52, was a non-event which went unreported. At a highway intersection in northern Arizona, his car was crushed by <b>tractor-trailer</b> <b>truck</b> travelling towards it at 60 miles per hour on 31 July 2006. Both he and his female driver, who was also his secretary, died.|$|E
5000|$|This truck {{configuration}} {{is currently}} common among European, Japanese and Chinese truck manufacturers, because the laws governing overall vehicle lengths are strict {{and the body}} style allows longer trailers (in {{the case of a}} <b>tractor-trailer</b> <b>truck)</b> or a longer cargo area (in the case of a [...] "straight" [...] truck, a truck with a single rigid frame supporting all components and the load) for the same overall length.|$|E

40|$|The {{delivery}} of vehicles to dealers {{is one of}} the major tasks in the vehicle production industry. It has relied on transportation companies that use special <b>tractor-trailer</b> <b>trucks</b> called auto-carriers. One of the main problems these companies have to solve is the optimal loading and routing of the auto-carriers, referred to as the Auto-Carrier Transportation (ACT) problem. In this paper we provide an integer programming formulation of the ACT problem and show that the problem is NP-hard in the strong sense. A three-step heuristic procedure strongly based on the IP formulation, which considers loading, vehicle selection, and routing aspects, is proposed. An application to a real case studyof a vehicle transportation company located in northern Italyis given, with an average deviation lower than 3 % from an upper bound on the optimal solution value...|$|R
5000|$|Given {{his great}} size (6' 8", 410 lbs) and muscular build, Razorback {{possesses}} considerable (but not superhuman) strength and endurance. He {{is an excellent}} hand-to-hand combatant with street-fighting techniques, and wears a wild-boar cowl headpiece with a mane that can be electrified by activating a device on his gloves. This electrical discharge proved strong enough to incapacitate Spider-Man. Razorback had the mutant ability to intuitively pilot, drive or operate virtually any vehicle or mode of transportation, even if he doesn't know how the vehicle operates. Thus he could fly the experimental [...] "Star Blazer" [...] spacecraft (renamed Big Pig III) despite having never seen it before. Razorback is a skilled mechanic and self-taught engineer who built two cab-over <b>tractor-trailer</b> <b>trucks</b> with sophisticated defensive systems, enhanced engines and self-drive capabilities (Big Pig I and Big Pig II).|$|R
5000|$|Condenser: The device {{between states}} 4 and 1 is the {{condense}}r. It removes {{heat from the}} engine exhaust steam to condense it back into water. In {{the case of the}} WHE-25 engine in the previous sub-section, of the 146.5 kW of heat energy supplied in the initial steam, 10 kW was converted into electricity. That leaves 146.5 - 10 = 136.5 kW of heat energy to be removed by the condenser. As a point of comparison, a Caterpillar C13 diesel engine that is commonly used in <b>tractor-trailer</b> <b>trucks</b> has a heat rejection to coolant rating of 128 kW. [...] Thus, a condenser for the WHE-25 engine producing 10 kW of power would be {{about the size of the}} radiator on a semi-truck. The newer WHE-DR is likely less efficient, so would need an even bigger condenser for the same output power.|$|R
50|$|Accounts of Lambert's death vary {{slightly}} in details. It is established {{that he was}} on the Connecticut Turnpike and that a flat tire was involved and that he was struck by a <b>tractor-trailer</b> <b>truck</b> driven by Floyd H. Demby {{in the early hours of}} October 3, 1966. The disabled vehicle was not fully off the roadway and its lights were turned off. In addition, an account on D. A. Pennebaker's website states that the accident was on the Merritt Parkway.|$|E
50|$|No. 2 and No. 6 were {{constructed}} with two trucks, with the rear truck powered on both axles. #2 had an enclosed freight compartment (like {{a very short}} boxcar), while #6 had an open bed similar to #1 (but larger). It was used only for work train service. The other four had three trucks and were articulated {{in the same manner}} as a <b>tractor-trailer</b> <b>truck.</b> In these, the second truck was powered, and the freight compartment was essentially a conventional boxcar.|$|E
50|$|MADtv spoofed Davey and Goliath {{in their}} fourteenth episode with Davey and Son of Goliath, {{alluding}} to the Son of Sam serial killer who claimed a talking dog had instructed him to kill. MADTV created a second parody for a segment in episode 25 of season three entitled Davey and Goliath 2: Pet Sematary. The sketch features Goliath being {{run over by a}} <b>tractor-trailer</b> <b>truck,</b> a motorcycle gang, and the stars of Riverdance, only to be raised from the dead in the Pet Sematary.|$|E
50|$|Buses became stuck {{not only}} due to slick roads, {{but even more}} so because traffic in metro Atlanta (except the east and southeast) quickly {{ground to a halt}} between noon and 1pm, as shown on TV by traffic-speed maps from GDOT's Georgia Navigator system. Complete {{gridlock}} ensued, preventing the area's few snowplows and other road-treatment vehicles from getting anywhere. <b>Tractor-trailer</b> <b>trucks</b> became stuck on the Perimeter (I-285), essentially closing the bypass route around the city. Other trucks, normally banned from inside the Perimeter except for local deliveries and pickups, then went through town and became stuck along with other traffic. At least three babies were born on the roads, including one delivered on I-285 by a Sandy Springs police officer who was having his own birthday that day, and whose daughter was born when the Great Blizzard of 1993 hit Atlanta. Another was born with nobody other than the mother present.|$|R
5000|$|A {{principal}} {{value of}} the inland waterways is their ability to efficiently convey large volumes of bulk commodities moving long distances. Towboats push barges lashed {{together to form a}} [...] "tow". A tow may consist of 4 or 6 barges on smaller waterways and up to over 40 barges on the mighty Mississippi River below its confluence with the Ohio River. A 15-barge tow is common on the larger rivers with locks, such as the Ohio, Upper Mississippi, Illinois and Tennessee rivers. Such tows are an extremely efficient mode of transportation, moving about 22,500 tons of cargo as a single unit. A single 15-barge tow is equivalent to about 225 railroad cars or 870 <b>tractor-trailer</b> <b>trucks.</b> If the cargo transported on the inland waterways each year had to be moved by another mode, it would take an additional 6.3 million rail cars or 25.2 million trucks to carry the load.|$|R
50|$|Iveco-UralAZ {{formed in}} late 1994 with a {{production}} capacity of 3600 vehicles per year. All production features the logo IVECO-UralAZ on the radiator grille. However, {{in the technical}} press Russian vehicles are frequently called Ural-Iveco.The first truck is the cab-IVECO-UralAZ 5531, closely derived from the Iveco 330. Its composition allows for a road train of 60 t, {{as well as the}} <b>tractor-trailer</b> and <b>truck</b> 55311 6x4 or 6x6..|$|R
50|$|Launched in 1948, the Martha S., was {{powered by}} two diesel engines making total 470 horsepower, and was 80 {{feet in length}} and 30 feet in beam. Its maximum {{capacity}} was 12 cars, or a single <b>tractor-trailer</b> <b>truck</b> alone, but it was unable to accommodate highway legal double tractor-trailer trucks. The ferry was in service from its launch until its retirement on Sunday, July 7, 2013. The vessel was {{named in honor of}} Martha Shain, the wife of State Highway Director Clarence Shain {{at the time it was}} put in service.|$|E
5000|$|The current Keller ferry, the M/V Sanpoil, is 116 feet in length, and is {{designed}} to carry 20 passenger vehicles, two single tractor-trailer trucks and 9 passenger vehicles, or a double <b>tractor-trailer</b> <b>truck</b> and 8 passenger vehicles. It was christened, received a tribal blessing, and began service on August 14, 2013, after the Martha S. docks were refit to handle the larger replacement vessel. [...] The name [...] "Sanpoil" [...] is an Anglicized version {{of the name of}} the native peoples of the surrounding area, and {{is the name of the}} river adjacent SR 21 to the north of the ferry.|$|E
5000|$|Max {{possesses}} considerable {{skill with}} firearms {{and is an}} excellent shot, but his most apparent skill is combative driving: he can shoot accurately {{with one hand while}} driving with the other. At the time of Mad Max, he was considered the [...] "top pursuit man" [...] in the MFP. He can easily pursue or evade gangs in the wasteland, whether overrunning another vehicle at high speed or ramming vehicles off the road. This skill is apparent with trucks as well as automobiles, as he drives a <b>tractor-trailer</b> <b>truck</b> after sustaining serious injuries in the second film.|$|E
2500|$|While Connecticut {{was one of}} {{the hardest}} hit areas, the state was well-prepared for the storm and managed to avoid major problems. Hartford {{received}} a total of 21.9inches (55cm) of snow â€” the second largest snowfall since 1906. A total of 18inches (46cm) fell in the small Sandy Hook village. West Hartford totaled 27inches (69cm) and Fairfield saw 27.8inches (70.6cm) of snow. Despite the large amounts of snow, there were only isolated individual power outages. [...] At the storm's onset, governor M. Jodi Rell ordered all <b>tractor-trailer</b> <b>trucks</b> off the state's highways to facilitate the efforts of highway crews with snow removal. [...] Motorists whose vehicles were not equipped with 4-wheel drive were required to use snow chains to travel on state roadways during the storm. [...] Connecticut mobilized 2,500 state-owned and privately contracted snowplows to keep state highways open during the storm. [...] The state's 169 cities and towns employed hundreds of additional plows to keep local roads passable. [...] Bradley International Airport was closed for several hours, and the storm disrupted service on Metro North.|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} with NASA's ATS- 6 satellite, that demonstrates the practicality of satellite-aided land mobile communications is described. Satellite communications {{equipment for the}} experiment was designed {{so that it would}} be no more expensive, when mass produced, than conventional two-way mobile radio equipment. It embodied the operational features and convenience of present day mobile radios. Vehicle antennas 75 cm tall and 2 cm in diameter provided good commercial quality signals to and from trucks and jeeps. Operational applicability and usage data were gathered by installing the radio equipment in five long-haul <b>tractor-trailer</b> <b>trucks</b> and two Air Force search and rescue jeeps. Channel occupancy rates are reported. Air Force personnel found the satellite radio system extremely valuable in their search and rescue mission during maneuvers and actual rescue operations. Propagation data is subjectively analyzed and over 4 hours of random data is categorized and graded as to signal quality on a second by second basis. Trends in different topographic regions are reported. An overall communications reliability of 93 % was observed despite low satellite elevation angles ranging from 9 to 24 degrees...|$|R
