The preparation and characterisation of metallacyclobutan- 3 -one (slipped oxodimethylenemethane) complexes [M(CH{lcub}COR{rcub}COCH{lcub}COR{rcub}) L 2] (where M = Pt or Pd) are presented in Chapter 2, and details the molecular structure of five of these complexes, establishing the highly puckered nature of the ring {{and the presence of}} an allylic contribution in the bonding of the oxodimethylenemethane ligand to the metal. In solution these complexes undergo rapid ring inversion at roan temperature and the activation energies for these processes have been calculated. The law temperature 1 H n. m. r. spectra shows the expected features for the static structure, the magnitude of the 2 J (PtH) and 3 J (PH) coupling for the CH protons depend on the CH bond orientation. Preliminary investigation into the reactivity of metallacyclobutan- 3 -ones is detailed in Chapter 3. The <b>triphenylarsine</b> ligands of the complexes [M(CH{lcub}COR{rcub}COCH{lcub}COR{rcub}) (ASPh 3) 2] are easily displaced by tertiary phosphines to the corresponding phosphorus ligand complexes.
