5|$|The most {{stringent}} {{tests are}} reserved for drugs and foodstuffs. For these, a number of tests are performed, lasting {{less than a month}} (acute), one to three months (subchronic), and more than three months (chronic) to test general toxicity (damage to organs), eye and skin irritancy, mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, <b>teratogenicity,</b> and reproductive problems. The cost of the full complement of tests is several million dollars per substance and it may take three or four years to complete.|$|E
5|$|Developmental effects {{occur at}} very low doses in animals. They include frank <b>teratogenicity</b> such as cleft palate and hydronephrosis. Development of some organs {{may be even more}} sensitive: very low doses perturb the {{development}} of sexual organs in rodents, and the development of teeth in rats. The latter is important in that tooth deformities were also seen after the Seveso accident and possibly after a long breast-feeding of babies in the 1970s and 1980s when the dioxin concentrations in Europe were about ten times higher than at present.|$|E
25|$|Thalidomide's <b>teratogenicity</b> {{has been}} a subject of much debate {{and over the years}} {{numerous}} hypotheses have been proposed. Two of the best-known have been the anti-angiogenesis hypothesis and oxidative stress model hypothesis, with considerable experimental evidence supporting these two hypotheses regarding thalidomide's <b>teratogenicity.</b>|$|E
25|$|Also, it {{resulted}} in abortion of F1 litters in rats and mice after i.p. injection. Embryotoxicity and <b>teratogenicity</b> were also reported in chick eggs.|$|E
25|$|Patients {{receiving}} isotretinoin therapy are {{not permitted}} to donate blood during and for at least one month after discontinuation of therapy due to its <b>teratogenicity.</b>|$|E
25|$|Female-specific: masculinization, {{irreversible}} voice deepening, hirsutism (excessive facial/body hair growth), menstrual disturbances (e.g., anovulation, oligomenorrhea, amenorrhea, dysmenorrhea), clitoral enlargement, breast atrophy, uterine atrophy, <b>teratogenicity</b> (in female fetuses).|$|E
25|$|Adverse {{effects of}} {{captopril}} include cough due {{to increase in}} the plasma levels of bradykinin, angioedema, agranulocytosis, proteinuria, hyperkalemia, taste alteration, <b>teratogenicity,</b> postural hypotension, acute renal failure, and leukopenia.|$|E
25|$|Vitamin A {{metabolic}} inhibition as {{a result}} of alcohol consumption during pregnancy is the elucidated mechanism for fetal alcohol syndrome and is characterized by <b>teratogenicity</b> closely matching maternal vitamin A deficiency.|$|E
25|$|Studies in mice, rats, {{and rabbits}} {{revealed}} <b>teratogenicity</b> for rabbits, but not rats or mice. The rate of birth defects in human infants exposed in utero to mifepristone and misoprostol is very low, {{and may be}} due to misoprostol alone.|$|E
25|$|The drug thalidomide's {{birth defects}} in {{children}} affected many people's lives, and from these events came {{the formation of}} the group called The Thalidomide Victims Association of Canada, a group of 120 Canadian survivors. Their goal was to prevent future usage of drugs that could be of potential harm to mothers and babies. The members from the thalidomide victims association were involved in the STEPS program, which aimed to prevent <b>teratogenicity.</b>|$|E
25|$|Pyrrolizidine {{alkaloids}} (PAs) are {{the toxins}} the bella moth {{is able to}} ingest and use for protection from predators. They {{are known to be}} the principal toxins found in plants that can cause disease in humans and other animals. Reported pathways for human exposure include crop contamination, milk and honey contamination and some traditional herbal medicines. Once ingested, the alkaloids affect mainly the liver and the lungs. Human poisoning can cause veno-occlusive disease and <b>teratogenicity.</b>|$|E
25|$|Screening for rubella {{susceptibility}} {{by history}} of vaccination or by serology is recommended in the United States {{for all women}} of childbearing age at their first preconception counseling visit to reduce incidence of congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). It is recommended that all susceptible non-pregnant {{women of childbearing age}} should be offered rubella vaccination. Due to concerns about possible <b>teratogenicity,</b> use of MMR vaccine is not recommended during pregnancy. Instead, susceptible pregnant women should be vaccinated as soon as possible in the postpartum period.|$|E
25|$|According to the {{boric acid}} IUCLID Dataset {{published}} by the European Commission, boric acid in high doses shows significant developmental toxicity and <b>teratogenicity</b> in rabbit, rat, and mouse fetuses as well as cardiovascular defects, skeletal variations, and mild kidney lesions. As a consequence in the 30th ATP to EU directive 67/548/EEC of August 2008, the European Commission decided to amend its classification as reprotoxic category 2, and to apply the risk phrases R60 (may impair fertility) and R61 (may cause harm to the unborn child).|$|E
25|$|One study {{concluded}} that epidemiological evidence is consistent with {{an increased risk of}} birth defects in the offspring of persons exposed to DU. Environmental groups and others have expressed concern about the health effects of depleted uranium, and there is some debate over the matter. Some people have raised concerns about the use of this material, particularly in munitions, because of its mutagenicity, <b>teratogenicity</b> in mice, and neurotoxicity, and its suspected carcinogenic potential. Additional concerns address unexploded DU munitions leeching into groundwater over time.|$|E
25|$|A {{study found}} that {{spironolactone}} {{was not associated with}} <b>teratogenicity</b> in the offspring of rats. Because it is an antiandrogen however, spironolactone could theoretically have the potential to cause feminization of male fetuses at sufficient doses. In accordance, a subsequent {{study found that}} partial feminization of the genitalia occurred in the male offspring of rats that received doses of spironolactone that were five times higher than those normally used in humans (200mg/kg per day). Another study found permanent, dose-related reproductive tract abnormalities rat offspring of both sexes at lower doses (50 to 100mg/kg per day).|$|E
25|$|Recently, new {{findings}} have emerged that suggest a novel mechanism of <b>teratogenicity.</b> Cereblon is a 51 kDa protein localized in the cytoplasm, nucleus and peripheral membrane of cells in numerous {{parts of the}} body. It acts {{as a component of}} the E3 ubiquitin ligase, regulating various developmental processes, including embryogenesis, carcinogenesis and cell cycle regulation, through degradation (ubiquitination) of unknown substrates. Thalidomide has been shown to bind to cereblon, inhibiting the activity of the E3 ubiquitin ligase, resulting in accumulation of the ligase substrates and downregulation of fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8) and FGF10. This disrupts the positive feedback loop between the two growth factors, possibly causing both multiple birth defects and anti-myeloma effects.|$|E
25|$|The 5α-reductase inhibitors {{finasteride}} and dutasteride {{may also}} be used in men with BPH. These medications inhibit the 5α-reductase enzyme, which, in turn, inhibits production of DHT, a hormone responsible for enlarging the prostate. Effects may take longer to appear than alpha blockers, but they persist for many years. When used together with alpha blockers, no benefit was reported in short-term trials, but in a longer term study (3–4 years) there was a greater reduction in BPH progression to acute urinary retention and surgery than with either agent alone, especially in patients were more severe symptoms and larger prostates. Other trials have confirmed reductions in symptoms, within 6 months in one trial, an effect that was maintained after withdrawal of the alpha blocker. Side effects include decreased libido and ejaculatory or erectile dysfunction. The 5α-reductase inhibitors are contraindicated in pregnant women because of their <b>teratogenicity</b> due to interference with fetal testosterone metabolism, and as a precaution, pregnant women should not handle crushed or broken tablets.|$|E
25|$|Although {{progesterone}} {{does not}} bind {{directly to the}} AR, it is a precursor and intermediate in the biosynthesis of androgens from cholesterol. For this reason, {{there has been some}} speculation that exogenous progesterone could be transformed into androgens by certain tissues that express the requisite enzymes. Progesterone is converted by 17α-hydroxylase into 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, 17α-hydroxyprogesterone is converted by 17,20-lyase into androstenedione, and androstenedione is converted by 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases into testosterone. CYP17A1, the cytochrome P450 gene that encodes 17α-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase, is expressed mainly in the gonads (ovaries and testes) and the adrenal glands. Despite the reasoning that progesterone could be converted into androgens however, clinical studies in which women were treated with 100 to 300mg/day OMP have found no or only a small increase in levels of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone and no change in androgen levels, including those of dehydroepiandrosterone, androstenedione, and testosterone. In these studies, levels of estradiol and cortisol, which progesterone is also a precursor of, did not change either, although levels of 11-deoxycorticosterone did increase significantly. In accordance with the lack of changes in androgen levels, progesterone, unlike various progestins, has not been associated with androgenic effects in clinical studies, including changes in the blood lipid profile or sex hormone-binding globulin levels, acne, skin oiliness, hirsutism, or voice deepening, or induction of <b>teratogenicity</b> (i.e., virilization of female fetuses).|$|E
2500|$|Transmission {{across the}} {{placenta}} during pregnancy {{has not been}} demonstrated, and no consistent pattern of <b>teratogenicity</b> or specific [...] "congenital Lyme borreliosis" [...] has been identified. As {{with a number of}} other spirochetal diseases, adverse pregnancy outcomes are possible with untreated infection; prompt treatment with antibiotics reduces or eliminates this risk.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{who do not}} {{advocate}} {{food irradiation}} argue the safety of irradiated food is not scientifically proven {{because there are a}} lack of long-term studies [...] {{in spite of the fact}} that hundreds of animal feeding studies of irradiated food, including multigenerational studies, have been performed since 1950. Endpoints investigated have included subchronic and chronic changes in metabolism, histopathology, function of most systems, reproductive effects, growth, <b>teratogenicity,</b> and mutagenicity. A large number of studies have been performed; meta-studies have supported the safety of irradiated food.|$|E
2500|$|Several trials on {{the safety}} and <b>teratogenicity</b> of {{nitrofurantoin}} in pregnancy have shown mixed results. A retrospective study in 2009 claimed that several birth defects, such as hypoplastic left heart syndrome, ophthalmic malformations, cleft lip and cleft palate, and atrial septal defect, were more common in neonates exposed to nitrofurantoin during pregnancy. A meta analysis of four out of twenty-two available studies {{on the safety}} of nitrofurantoin found no increased risk. A case-control study in 1998 found {{an increased risk of}} craniosynostosis after exposure to [...] "nitrosatable" [...] drugs. A more recent 2013 population-based cohort study which used women registered in the Norwegian Prescription Database and linked the subjects to a birth outcomes database, however, found no increased risk of major malformations in neonates born to women who took nitrofurantoin in early pregnancy. Many of the studies showing increased risk of nitrofurantoin had limitations and relied on patients' recall of the antibiotics they took during pregnancy rather than objective data, which may have led to recall bias. Nevertheless, in light of these conflicting data, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) recommends using antibiotics only for appropriate indications and for the shortest effective duration.|$|E
2500|$|A CDC report {{published}} in 2000 showed {{problems with the}} Pregnancy Prevention Program and showed {{that the increase in}} prescriptions was from off-label use, and prompted Roche to revamp its program, renaming it the [...] "Targeted Pregnancy Prevention Program" [...] and adding label changes like requirements for two pregnancy tests, two kinds of contraception, and for doctors to provide pharmacists with prescriptions directly; providing additional educational materials, and providing free pregnancy tests. The FDA had another advisory meeting in late 2000 that again debated how to prevent pregnant women from being exposed to the drug; dermatologists testified about the remarkable efficacy of the drug, the psychological impact of acne, and demanded autonomy to prescribe the drug; others argued that the drug be withdrawn or much stricter measures be taken. [...] In 2001 the FDA announced a new regulatory scheme called SMART (the System to Manage Accutane Related <b>Teratogenicity)</b> that required Roche to provide defined training materials to doctors, and for doctors to sign and return a letter to Roche acknowledging that they had reviewed the training materials, for Roche to then send stickers to doctors, which doctors would have to place on prescriptions they give patients after they have confirmed a negative pregnancy test; prescriptions could only be written for 30 days and could not be renewed, thus requiring a new pregnancy test for each prescription.|$|E
