5|$|The Reichskulturkammer (Reich Chamber of Culture) was {{organised}} {{under the}} control of <b>the</b> <b>Propaganda</b> Ministry in September 1933. Sub-chambers were set up to control aspects of cultural life such as film, radio, newspapers, fine arts, music, theatre and literature. Members of these professions were required to join their respective organisation. Jews and people considered politically unreliable were prevented from working in the arts and many emigrated. Books and scripts had to be approved by <b>the</b> <b>Propaganda</b> Ministry prior to publication. Standards deteriorated as the regime sought to use cultural outlets exclusively as propaganda media.|$|E

40|$|This Master thesis {{contributes}} {{to the history of}} science in the period of the Czechoslovak communist regime. The thesis deals with the attempts to create a scientific theory of propaganda as an independent branch of science. The main goal of this thesis is to present what {{led to the formation of}} the Marxist theory of propaganda, describe its development and potential changes in <b>the</b> approach to <b>propaganda</b> during <b>the</b> reference period. Further goals are to describe the sources of <b>the</b> theory of <b>propaganda,</b> <b>the</b> concern of the official institutions and the people who dealt with <b>propaganda.</b> <b>The</b> research is based on the archive materials from the National Archives of the Czech republic and the Slovak National Archives, and on the works about <b>the</b> theory of <b>propaganda.</b> <b>The</b> central figure of this thesis is Miloslav Chlupáč, who dealt with <b>the</b> theory of <b>propaganda</b> in <b>the</b> whole reference period and who was influential to the most phases of the development of <b>the</b> theory of <b>propaganda.</b> <b>The</b> reference period begins with the changes in the society after the year of 1948, with the main concern being science, education and propaganda; and first contributions to <b>the</b> theory of <b>propaganda,</b> which were based on the socio-political situation in the 1950 s.

In 1940 he composed his first film score, for <b>the</b> <b>propaganda</b> film 49th Parallel.|$|E
5|$|Following the attack, the German Ministry of Propaganda checked {{incoming}} {{reports from}} both London and the German Naval High command.

They claimed instead that the British had torpedoed their own vessel in an attempt to bring the United States into the war on the side of the Allies.|$|E
5|$|Heydrich was {{assigned}} to help organise the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. The games were used to promote <b>the</b> <b>propaganda</b> aims of the Nazi regime. Goodwill ambassadors were sent to countries that were considering a boycott. Anti-Jewish violence was forbidden for the duration, and news stands were required to stop displaying copies of Der Stürmer. For his part in the games' success, Heydrich was awarded the Deutsches Olympiaehrenzeichen or German Olympic Games Decoration (First Class).|$|E

This lodge was chartered by the Grande Oriente d'Italia in 1877, as a lodge for visiting Masons unable to attend their own lodges. Under Licio Gelli's leadership, in the late 1970s, P2 {{became involved in the}} financial scandals that nearly bankrupted the Vatican Bank. However, by this time the lodge was operating independently and irregularly, as the Grand Orient had revoked its charter and expelled Gelli in 1976.|$|E
5|$|In North Africa, Rommel {{received}} help in cultivating {{his image}} from Alfred Ingemar Berndt, {{a senior official}} at the Reich Propaganda Ministry, who had volunteered for military service. Seconded by Goebbels, Berndt was assigned to Rommel's staff {{and became one of}} his closest aides. Berndt often acted as liaison between Rommel, <b>the</b> <b>Propaganda</b> Ministry and the Führer Headquarters. He directed Rommel's photo shoots and filed radio dispatches describing the battles.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the British victory at Second Battle of El Alamein in November 1942, and other {{military}} reverses, <b>the</b> <b>Propaganda</b> Ministry directed the media to emphasise Rommel's invincibility. The charade was maintained until the spring of 1943, even as the German situation in Africa became increasingly precarious. In May 1943, to ensure that the inevitable defeat in Africa would not be associated with Rommel's name, Goebbels had the Supreme High Command announce that Rommel was on a two-month leave for health reasons. Instead, the campaign was presented by Berndt, who resumed his role in <b>the</b> <b>Propaganda</b> Ministry, as a ruse to tie down the British Empire while Germany was turning Europe into an impenetrable fortress, with Rommel at the helm of this success. After the radio program ran in May 1943, Rommel sent Berndt a case of cigars as a sign of his gratitude.|$|E

5|$|It is {{generally}} believed that <b>the</b> <b>propaganda</b> of the Goan priests and the alliance of the Christians with the English cause Tipu to banish the community from Canara. The main political {{reason for this}} decision was Tipu's belief that if he banished the Christians, he could keep the British at bay. However, Alan Machado Prabhu dismisses the idea of large-scale Christian support for the British during the Second Mangalore War as a myth which {{is not based on}} any concrete evidence.|$|E
5|$|Like his {{political}} career, Kogălniceanu's tracts focused on condemning Austrian ethnic and territorial policies. Also in 1875, he issued from Paris an anti-Austrian brochure about the Romanian cause in Bukovina. Called Rapt de la Bukovine d'après les documents authentiques ("The Rape of Bukovina, from Genuine Documents"), it reused old texts {{collected by the}} Hurmuzachis. <b>The</b> <b>propaganda</b> effort won support from across the floor: Junimea Conservatives (Titu Maiorescu, Theodor Rosetti, Ioan Slavici), National Liberals (D. Sturdza) and independents (Alexandru Odobescu) all signed up to the enterprise.|$|E
5|$|Starting in August 1941, when {{it became}} clear to some in <b>the</b> <b>Propaganda</b> Ministry and the Wehrmacht high command that the war would likely extend into 1942, Goebbels grew {{increasingly}} concerned about the triumphant tone of the communiques. However, a string of spectacular victories in September, especially in the Battle of Kiev, removed any restraint from the texts, making propagandists's work more difficult later on, when they had to explain the Wehrmacht's failures to the German public which was rapidly losing confidence in a swift victory.|$|E

5|$|Article 3 of {{the bill}} amended the Code of the Russian Federation on Administrative Offenses with Article 6.21, which prescribes {{penalties}} for violations of <b>the</b> <b>propaganda</b> ban: Russian citizens found guilty can receive fines of up to 5,000 rubles, and public officials can receive fines of up to 50,000 rubles. Organizations or businesses can be fined up to 1 million rubles and be forced to cease operations for up to 90 days. Foreigners may be arrested and detained for up to 15 days then deported, or fined up to 5,000 rubles and deported. The fines for individuals are much higher if the offense was committed using mass media or internet.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of deteriorating {{conditions}} in the city attributed to French governance, the unpopular establishment of martial law, and <b>the</b> <b>propaganda</b> efforts of the rebels and their Turkish backers, many neighborhood leaders in Aleppo decided to recruit men to join Hananu's rebels, {{while many of the}} city's landowners and merchants donated funds to the rebel cause. The presence of 5,000 French Senegalese troops prevented an urban revolt that specifically targeted French forces, but in numerous incidents, Muslims from Aleppo's lower-income neighborhoods, such as Bab al-Nairab, violently assaulted members of the city's large Christian minority because they were viewed as being associated with French interests.|$|E

5|$|As {{with other}} media, {{newspapers}} were {{controlled by the}} state, with the Reich Press Chamber shutting down or buying newspapers and publishing houses. By 1939, over {{two thirds of the}} newspapers and magazines were directly owned by <b>the</b> <b>Propaganda</b> Ministry. The NSDAP daily newspaper, the Völkischer Beobachter ("Ethnic Observer"), was edited by Alfred Rosenberg, author of The Myth of the Twentieth Century, a book of racial theories espousing Nordic superiority. Goebbels controlled the wire services and insisted that all newspapers in Germany only publish content favourable to the regime. His propaganda ministry issued two dozen directives every week on exactly what news should be published and what angles to use; the typical newspaper followed the directives closely. Newspaper readership plummeted, partly because of the decreased quality of the content and partly because of the surge in popularity of radio.|$|E
5|$|Castillo Armas' army of 480 men was {{not large}} enough to defeat the Guatemalan military, even with U.S.-supplied aircraft. Therefore, the plans for Operation PBSUCCESS called for a {{campaign}} of psychological warfare, which would present Castillo Armas' victory as a fait accompli to the Guatemalan people, and would force Árbenz to resign. <b>The</b> <b>propaganda</b> campaign had begun well before the invasion, with the U.S. Information Agency (USIA) writing hundreds of articles on Guatemala based on CIA reports, and distributing {{tens of thousands of}} leaflets throughout Latin America. The CIA persuaded friendly governments to screen video footage of Guatemala that supported the U.S. version of events.|$|E
5|$|Göring (who {{controlled}} Rheinmetall-Borsig) supplied {{arms to the}} Republicans; {{shipped to}} Greece supposedly for their use, the arms were transferred by Bodosakis to ships supposedly sailing to Mexico. He was also supplying the Nationalists, who got the best and latest weapons while the Republicans got the oldest and least serviceable. This supply peaked in 1937–38. Nationalists identified 18 vessels to Republican ports from 3 January 1937 and 11 May 1938, and estimated that Goering received the equivalent of one pound sterling per rifle. An earlier shipment from Hamburg to Alicante on 1 October 1936 by the Welsh ship Bramhill had 19,000 rifles, 101 machine guns and more than 20 million cartridges for the CNT militia in Barcelona. Nazi Germany also helped <b>the</b> <b>propaganda</b> war with a gift of a Telefunken transmitter for the newly created national radio service.|$|E
