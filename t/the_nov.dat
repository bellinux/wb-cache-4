40|$|The {{discovery}} of two diminutive and very distinct ibliform barnacles from shallow waters off northern New Zealand and northeastern Tasmania {{provides an opportunity}} to re-evaluate the Iblidae, the most primitive of the living thoracicans. These are retained within the Superorder Thoracica, but are distinguished at ordinal level from {{the remainder of the}} Pedunculata s. l. The resultant new order, <b>the</b> Ibliformes <b>nov.,</b> comprises barnacles with predominantly chitinous rather than calcareous capitular plates; two families are recognized, the Iblidae s. s., comprising two subfamilies, the Iblinae (Ibla s. s.) and <b>the</b> Neoiblinae <b>nov.</b> (Neoibla gen. <b>nov.),</b> and <b>the</b> Idioiblidae <b>nov.</b> comprising <b>the</b> Idioiblinae <b>nov.</b> (Idioibla gen. <b>nov.)</b> and <b>the</b> Chaetolepadinae <b>nov.</b> (Chaetolepas Studer, 1889 and Chitinolepas gen. <b>nov.).</b> <b>The</b> monotypic Chitinolepas further highlights the high endemism and relict nature of the New Zealand marine fauna in particular and the southern hemisphere in general. On the basis of morphology and, where possible, genetic and larval work, it is recommended that the remainder of the stalked thoracicans be divided between three new orders, the Cyprilepadiformes, Ibliformes, Lepadiformes and Scalpelliformes...|$|R

2500|$|As {{a part of}} a {{phenomenon}} known as [...] "Christmas creep", radio stations—responsible for so much of Christmas music broadcasting, popularization, and appreciation—are [...] "going Christmas" [...] earlier each year. Many stations now start rolling out holiday music in early November instead of Thanksgiving or Black Friday (and a select few, such as WEZW since 2011, have earned a reputation for beginning their Christmas music as early as October), because programmers [...] "think that listeners will stick with the first station to change to a seasonal theme." [...] About 400 radio stations [...] "across the U.S. play Christmas music around the clock." [...] In Chicago, WLIT-FM saw its share of all radio listeners grow from a 2.9/3.6 share earlier in the year to 9.3 during <b>the</b> <b>Nov.</b> 28 to Dec. 11, 2003 Arbitron rating period.

2500|$|In 2001, the IMF {{conducted}} considerable {{research that}} opposes a transaction tax.

This is an interesting issue. ... We will look at it from various angles and consider all proposals.'" [...] When the IMF presented its interim report for the G20 on 16 April 2010, it laid out three options: a bank tax, a Financial Activities Tax (FAT), and a third option (which was not promoted but not ruled out), a financial transaction tax. On 16 April 2011, the IMF stated, it does not endorse a financial transaction tax, believing it [...] "does not appear well suited to the specific purposes set out in the mandate from the G-20 leaders". However, it concedes that [...] "The FTT should not be dismissed on grounds of administrative practicality".|$|E
