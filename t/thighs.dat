5|$|Painful {{cramping}} in the abdomen, back, or upper <b>thighs</b> {{is common}} {{during the first}} few days of menstruation. Severe uterine pain during menstruation is known as dysmenorrhea, and it is most common among adolescents and younger women (affecting about 67.2% of adolescent females). When menstruation begins, symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) such as breast tenderness and irritability generally decrease. Many sanitary products are marketed to women for use during their menstruation.|$|E
5|$|Poison {{was given}} a {{secondary}} outfit for Capcom Fighting All-Stars alongside her primary classic attire. Made of shiny, silvery material it consisted of boots that extended halfway up her <b>thighs</b> and a combined sleeveless shirt/short skirt with a plunging neckline. Gloves and a small hairband were also added, {{as well as a}} belt, with the handcuffs hanging off of it. Her arm straps were removed, though the strap around her neck remained.|$|E

[...] When standing free, obtuse angles are formed between the dog's upper <b>thigh</b> and the hip bone, the upper <b>thigh</b> and the lower <b>thigh,</b> and the lower <b>thigh</b> and metatarsal. The upper <b>thigh</b> is moderately long, broad and strongly muscled. The lower <b>thigh</b> is long, strongly and broadly muscled, sinewy. The hocks are sturdy, well angulated, not steep. The hind feet are slightly longer than the front feet. [...] Toes are strong, arched, as tight as the front feet.|$|R

5000|$|The fascial {{compartments}} of <b>thigh</b> are {{the three}} fascial compartments that divide and contain the <b>thigh</b> muscles. The fascia lata is the strong and deep fascia of the <b>thigh</b> that surrounds the <b>thigh</b> muscles and forms the outer limits of the compartments. Internally the muscle compartments are divided by the lateral and medial intermuscular septa.|$|R
5|$|The overall {{appearance}} of the Saluki is one of grace and symmetry. Two coat types—smooth and feathered—are evident in the breed's gene pool. The latter variety has light feathering {{on the back of}} the legs and <b>thighs.</b> The fur on both types is silky and is low-shedding when compared to other breeds.|$|E
5|$|Book XI covers {{human beings}}, portents and transformations. Isidore derives human beings (homo) from the Latin for soil (humus), as in Genesis 2:7 {{it says that}} man is made from the soil. Urine (urina) gets its name either {{from the fact that}} it can burn (urere) the skin or, Isidore hedges, that it is from the kidneys (renes). Femina, meaning woman, comes from femora/femina meaning <b>thighs,</b> as this part of the body shows she is not a man. The Latin for {{buttocks}} is clunis as they are near the large intestine or colon (colum).|$|E
5|$|Many of the henchmen {{employed}} by the villains may have unique weapons; Oddjob, Auric Goldfinger's enforcer, carries a bowler hat with a razor-sharp blade concealed in the rim, while Xenia Onatopp is known to crush victims to death with her <b>thighs</b> during intercourse. In addition to these weapons, many of the henchmen are physically different; the over-large Tee Hee had an iron claw, Jaws, an assassin with steel teeth, was played by 2.18m (7'2") actor Richard Kiel, whilst Renard (the henchman to the main villainess Elektra) survived being shot in the head, which progressively killed off his senses {{and his ability to}} feel pain.|$|E

5|$|The company sells {{slightly}} {{different versions of}} the sandwich between international markets, using white meat chicken breast in some regions while using dark meat chicken <b>thighs</b> in others. To promote continuing interest in the product, Burger King occasionally releases limited-time (LTO) variants on its grilled chicken sandwiches that have different ingredients from the standard sandwich recipe. Being one of the company's major offerings, the grilled chicken sandwich is sometimes the center of product advertising for the company. Additionally, as a major product in the company's portfolio, Burger King has registered many global trademarks to protect its investment in the product.|$|E
5|$|The skin of E. rabborum was {{granular}} in {{texture and}} predominantly a mottled brown. The upper {{surfaces of the}} limbs was also mottled brown while the rear surfaces of the <b>thighs</b> were a pale yellow. The chin and upper chest was distinctively brown, though {{the rest of the}} underside of the body was mostly white speckled with irregular brown spots. The eyelids and upper surfaces of the limbs and back were studded with green flecks, the appearance and positions of which could be changed by the animal voluntarily (metachrosis). The irises of the eyes was uniformly reddish brown.|$|E
5|$|The western magpie, G. tibicen dorsalis was {{originally}} {{described as a}} separate species by A. J. Campbell in 1895 and {{is found in the}} fertile south-west corner of Western Australia. The adult male has a white back and most closely resembles subspecies telonocua, though it is a little larger with a longer bill and the black tip of its tail plumage is narrower. The female is unusual in that it has a scalloped black or brownish-black mantle and back; the dark feathers there are edged with white. This area appears a more uniform black as the plumage ages and the edges are worn away. Both sexes have black <b>thighs.</b>|$|E

5|$|A 2004 review {{reported}} 46% of bites occurring on distal extremities of the limbs, 25% on proximal {{areas of}} limbs (upper arms and <b>thighs),</b> 21% on the trunk, and 7% {{on the head}} or neck. In some cases the same spider bites a victim multiple times. Historically, victims were often bitten on the genitalia, though this phenomenon disappeared as outhouses were superseded by plumbed indoor toilets. Conversely, bites {{on the head and}} neck have increased with use of safety helmets and ear muffs. Precautions to avoid being bitten include wearing gloves and shoes while gardening, not leaving clothes on the floor, and shaking out gloves or shoes before putting them on. Also, children can be educated not to touch spiders.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{concerns}} are hypothyroidism, allergies, epilepsy, diabeties and glandular disorders which may cause baldness. The hair loss occurs at around {{six months of}} age, affecting the neck, <b>thighs</b> and tail; however the frequency has been reduced through work conducted by the breed clubs. Hip dysplasia is seen in around 8.3% of the breed, according to surveys conducted by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals over a twenty five-year period between 1974 and 1999. This {{was one of the}} lower results of the sporting breeds, with Greyhounds coming lowest with 3.4%, and the related Boykin Spaniel coming in second highest at 47%. There was no evidence of elbow dysplasia found. The breed has an average life span of 1013 years.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{types of}} {{underwear}} {{are described as}} bikini underwear and designed for men and women. For women, bikini or bikini-style underwear is underwear that is similar in size and form to a regular bikini. It can refer to virtually any undergarment that provides less coverage to the midriff than traditional underwear, panties or knickers, especially suited to clothing such as crop tops. For men, bikini briefs are undergarments that are smaller and more revealing than men's regular briefs. Men's bikini briefs can be low- or high-side that are usually lower than true waist, often at hips, and usually have no access pouch or flap, legs bands at tops of <b>thighs.</b> String bikini briefs have front and rear sections that meet in the crotch {{but not at the}} waistband, with no fabric {{on the side of the}} legs.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIntroductionCompartment {{syndrome}} isolated to {{the anterior}} <b>thigh</b> {{is a rare}} complication of soccer injury. Previous reports in the English literature on sports trauma-related compartment syndrome of the <b>thigh</b> are vague in their description of the response of <b>thigh</b> musculature to blunt trauma, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of high-risk features of compartment syndrome, vascular injury in quadriceps trauma, {{and the role of}} vascular study in blunt <b>thigh</b> injury. Case reportWe present herein the rare case of a 30 -year-old man who developed <b>thigh</b> compartment syndrome 8 days after soccer injury due to severe edema of vastus intermedius and large <b>thigh</b> hematoma secondary to rupture of the profunda femoris vein. MRI revealed “blow-out” rupture of the vastus lateralis. Decompressive fasciotomy and vein repair performed with subsequent split-skin grafting of the wound defect resulted in a good functional outcome at 2 -years follow-up. ConclusionA high index of suspicion for compartment syndrome is needed in all severe quadriceps contusion. Vascular injury can cause <b>thigh</b> compartment syndrome in sports trauma. MRI findings of deep <b>thigh</b> muscle swelling and “blow-out” tear of the vastus lateralis are strongly suggestive of severe quadriceps injury, and may be a harbinger of delayed <b>thigh</b> compartment syndrome...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the scheme to select alternative flaps {{limited to the}} region of the ipsilateral <b>thigh</b> when the perforator of the anterolateral <b>thigh</b> flap is not feasible. Total of 564 consecutive microsurgery cases using anterolateral <b>thigh</b> perforator flap was reviewed from March of 2001 to January of 2009. Total of 12 cases used a contingent flap due to anatomical and technical complications of the anterolateral <b>thigh</b> perforator. The alternatives were skin perforator flaps adjacent to the initial flap (3 cases of upper anterolateral <b>thigh</b> flap, 4 cases of anteromedial <b>thigh</b> flap), vastus lateralis muscle flap with skin graft (2 cases), and anterolateral <b>thigh</b> flap as septocutaneous flap without a prominent perforator on the septum (3 cases). All flaps survived and provided coverage as planned but one case using septocutaneous flap without a prominent perforator was noted with partial necrosis. Adjacent flaps around the anterolateral <b>thigh</b> perforator flap may provide useful alternative flaps in cases of failed elevation. Limiting the contingent secondary flap to this region may reduce further donor site morbidity and still provide an adequate flap for reconstruction...|$|R
40|$|A <b>thigh</b> {{contusion}} is {{a common}} sports related injury that can result in disability and time away from activity. <b>Thigh</b> pads can be worn to help reduce injury occurrence and severity. To evaluate the relative effectiveness of protective guards a <b>thigh</b> model is required. This study utilised data generated from impacts on human volunteers and cadaver material to select a surrogate soft tissue component for a <b>thigh</b> model. This component was attached to a stainless steel beam that represented the femur. The model was instrumented with an internal transducer to measure local peak force. This parameter provided {{a measure of the}} impact force attenuation of protective equipment. Initial tests were conducted on cricket <b>thigh</b> pads. The <b>thigh</b> model can be used to assess the relative effectiveness of <b>thigh</b> guards and has the potential to determine whether the ideally sought lightweight low bulk pads offer similar protection as other bulkier pads. ...|$|R
5|$|Herrerasaurus {{was fully}} bipedal. It had strong hind limbs with short <b>thighs</b> and rather long feet, {{indicating}} {{that it was}} likely a swift runner. The foot had five toes, but only the middle three (digits II, III, and IV) bore weight. The outer toes (I and V) were small; the first toe had a small claw. The tail, partially stiffened by overlapping vertebral projections, balanced the body and was also an adaptation for speed. The forelimbs of Herrerasaurus were {{less than half the}} length of its hind limbs. The upper arm and forearm were rather short, while the manus (hand) was elongated. The first two fingers and the thumb ended in curved, sharp claws for grasping prey. The fourth and fifth digits were small stubs without claws.|$|E
5|$|In Australia, {{the adults}} may be {{confused}} with large native frogs from the genera Limnodynastes, Cyclorana, and Mixophyes. These species can be distinguished from the cane toad {{by the absence of}} large parotoid glands behind their eyes and the lack of a ridge between the nostril and the eye. Cane toads have been confused with the giant burrowing frog (Heleioporus australiacus), because both are large and warty in appearance; however, the latter can be readily distinguished from the former by its vertical pupils and its silver-grey (as opposed to gold) irises. Juvenile cane toads may {{be confused with}} species of the Uperoleia genus, but their adult colleagues can be distinguished by the lack of bright colouring on the groin and <b>thighs.</b>|$|E
5|$|In medieval Europe, {{any effort}} to halt {{pregnancy}} was deemed immoral by the Catholic Church, although {{it is believed that}} women of the time still used a number of birth control measures, such as coitus interruptus and inserting lily root and rue into the vagina. Women in the Middle Ages were also encouraged to tie weasel testicles around their <b>thighs</b> during sex to prevent pregnancy. The oldest condoms discovered to date were recovered in the ruins of Dudley Castle in England, and are dated back to 1640. They were made of animal gut, and were most likely used {{to prevent the spread of}} sexually transmitted diseases during the English Civil War. Casanova, living in 18th century Italy, described the use of a lambskin covering to prevent pregnancy; however, condoms only became widely available in the 20th century.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging (MRI) and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) {{were used to}} examine the <b>thigh</b> lean mass in young and old men and women. METHODS A whole-body DXA scan was used to estimate <b>thigh</b> lean mass in young (20 men; 22. 4 ± 3. 1 y; 18 women; 22. 1 ± 2. 0 y) and older adults (25 men; 72. 3 ± 4. 9 y; 28 women; 72. 0 ± 4. 5 y). <b>Thigh</b> lean mass determined with a <b>thigh</b> scan on the DXA or full <b>thigh</b> MRI scans were compared. RESULTS Although the <b>thigh</b> lean mass quantified by DXA and MRI in young and older participants were correlated (R(2) = 0. 88; p< 0. 001) the magnitude of the differences in <b>thigh</b> lean mass between young and old was smaller with DXA than MRI (old vs. young men 79. 5 ± 13. 1...|$|R
5000|$|Modern stockings, pantyhose, and <b>thigh</b> highs {{are made}} by either flat {{knitting}} {{or the use of}} circular machines. Flat knitting is the original hosiery manufacturing technique of the 1930s-1950s. After the fabric has been produced, each <b>thigh</b> high is individually seamed. The top of the seam has a [...] "finishing loop", a small hole that every seamed <b>thigh</b> high has {{as a result of the}} machinist turning the welt—the <b>thigh</b> high top—inside out, in order to finish off. Once sewn, the <b>thigh</b> highs are [...] "boarded". This is a process where each <b>thigh</b> high is stretched over a flat metal leg form and [...] "set" [...] with steam. The knit tightens, creases are eliminated and the leg is correctly shaped. Because the process is time consuming, seamed <b>thigh</b> highs are never cheap. Also, around a third of production—especially during the production of sheer stockings—is discarded during quality control.|$|R

5|$|On 13 March 1995, {{a pair of}} legs, severed at the knees, {{was found}} in a plastic bag {{floating}} off Clifford Pier. Three days later, a pair of <b>thighs</b> and a torso were found in the same area, also in a plastic bag. Initially, Singapore police could only determine that the body parts belonged to a Caucasian, and they had a possible name after receiving a missing person report for Lowe from the South African High Commission. Vanessa Lowe filed the report because she was distressed that her husband, who used to make daily contact with his family when overseas, had not called home or returned to South Africa by 12 March. Lowe's colleagues at work also tried to determine his whereabouts through personal contacts in Singapore. On 1 April, she confirmed that the body parts were her husband's through visual identification. However, his arms and head were never found.|$|E
