The care and welfare equipment {{to support a}} nursing care and a self-reliance of the senior and the disabled are actively researched and developed by many researchers. However, the power assisted device required many degrees of freedom. The total weight of the wearable devices using fluid control devices increases so {{that the number of}} actuator and control valves increases according to the degree of freedom. Therefore, in our previous study, we developed a small and light-weight quasi-servo valve to reduce the burden of the user. In this paper, we proposed and <b>tested</b> a quasi-servo <b>valve</b> by using the small, light-weight and low-cost on/off valves driven by the pulse width modulation method. The valve consists of two on/off valves and a microcomputer. Both valves are connected in serial. One valve is used as a switching valve to exhaust or supply, and another is used as a PWM control valve that can adjust the valve opening. And we confirmed that the output flow rate of the <b>tested</b> <b>valve</b> could be adjusted in analog way. We also proposed the precise analytical model of the <b>tested</b> <b>valve.</b> By comparing the experimental result with the calculated results using the proposed model and the identified parameters, we confirmed that the model of the valve was valid. In the next step, a pressure control type quasi-servo valve is proposed and <b>tested.</b> The <b>tested</b> <b>valve</b> consists of the quasi-servo valve, a pressure transducer and an inexpensive tiny micro-computer. As a result, by using the <b>tested</b> <b>valve</b> and P control method with the compensation for the supplied and exhausted flow rates, the pressure control performance of the <b>tested</b> <b>valve</b> could be improved...|$|R

Methods: A pulsatile ¯ow loop {{was set up in}} a 7. 0 Tesla MRI scanner to study ¯uid velocity data downstream of a 25 mm aortic bilea¯et heart valve prosthesis. Three dimensional surface plots of velocity ®elds were displayed. In six NYHA class I patients blood velocity pro®les were studied downstream of their St. Jude Medical aortic valves using a 1. 5 Tesla MRI whole-body scanner. Blood velocity data were displayed as mentioned above. Results: Fluid velocity pro®les obtained from in vitro studies 0. 25 valve diameter downstream of the valve exhibited signi®cant details about the cross sectional distribution of ¯uid velocities.

Blood velocity pro®les in humans were considerably smoother and in some cases skewed with the highest velocities toward the anterior-right ascending aortic wall.

40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare stentless bioprostheses with stented bioprostheses with regard to their hemodynamic behavior during exercise. BACKGROUNDStentless aortic bioprostheses have better hemodynamic performances at rest than stented bioprostheses, but very few comparisons were performed during exercise. METHODSThirty-eight patients with normally functioning stentless (n = 19) or stented (n = 19) bioprostheses were submitted to a maximal ramp upright bicycle exercise <b>test.</b> <b>Valve</b> effective orifice area and mean transvalvular pressure gradient at rest and during peak exercise were successfully measured using Doppler echocardiography in 30 of the 38 patients. RESULTSAt peak exercise, the mean gradient increased significantly less in stentless than in stented bioprostheses (+ 5 ± 3 vs. + 12 ± 8 mm Hg; p = 0. 002) despite similar increases in mean flow rates (+ 137 ± 58 vs. + 125 ± 65 ml/s; p = 0. 58); valve area also increased but with no significant difference between groups. Despite this hemodynamic difference, exercise capacity was not significantly different, but left ventricular (LV) mass and function were closer to normal in stentless bioprostheses. Overall, there was a strong inverse relation between the mean gradient during peak exercise and the indexed valve area at rest (r = 0. 90). CONCLUSIONSHemodynamics during exercise are better in stentless than stented bioprostheses due to the larger resting indexed valve area of stentless bioprostheses. This is associated with beneficial effects with regard to LV mass and function. The relation found between the resting indexed valve area and the gradient during exercise can be used to project the hemodynamic behavior of these bioprostheses at the time of operation. It should thus be useful to select the optimal prosthesis given the patient’s body surface area and level of physical activity...|$|E

40|$|Abstract only availableThe {{metering}} {{poppet valve}} {{is a new}} design {{that is trying to}} maximize stability and performance. Poppet valves are typically not used as metering valves because they have stability issues. This new valve is trying to rectify the stability issues while maintaining the fast response time. The drawings of the poppet valve have been finalized, a mathematical model and an experimental setup have been developed. Once the new valve arrives, it will be implemented into the experimental setup. The Vickers Valvistor poppet valve has been used to prepare the <b>test</b> <b>valve</b> setup. A flow meter, three pressure sensors, and a LVDT sensor has been hooked into the system and then calibrated. A solenoid was attached to the valve which is controlled by Real-Time workshop on a computer. All of the data is sent to the computer and stored. The subject of dither was looked into. Dither is adding a sine wave to a signal to keep the poppet from experiencing static friction which gives a better response. The optimum frequency and amplitude for the sine wave was determined experimentally using a triangle input and measuring hysteresis. Frequency response testing is occurring to try and construct a bode plot for the valve. From the bode plot, the system's transfer function will be obtained which will be used to validate the model of the valve. All of this work is just for preparation for arrival of the new poppet valve. Once the new valve arrives, it will be implemented into the system in a similar way and the same tests will be run in order to validate the system model and illustrate the performance of this new valve.

40|$|To {{determine}} whether the location of aortic valve calcium (AVC) influences the location of paravalvular regurgitation (PR). PR is an adverse effect of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) with {{a negative effect on}} long-term patient survival. The relationship between AVC and the occurrence of PR has been documented. However, the relationship between the distribution of AVC and the location of PR is still sparsely studied. The {{purpose of this study was}} to correlate severity and location of AVC with PR in patients treated with TAVI. Fifty-six consecutive patients who underwent transaortic or transapical TAVI and had preoperative computed tomography scans were included in this retrospective study. The volume, mass and location of AVC was determined and compared between patients with and without PR using a non-parametric t-test. Postoperative echocardiography was performed to determine the presence and location of PR, which was associated with the cusp with highest AVC using a χ(2) <b>test.</b> <b>Valve</b> deployment was successful in all 56 patients. PR was present in 38 patients (68 %) after TAVI. There was a non-significantly higher volume of AVC in the PR group [214 (70 - 418) vs 371 (254 - 606) cm(3), P = 0. 15]. AVC mass was significantly higher in patients with PR than in patients without PR [282 (188 - 421) vs 142 (48 - 259) mg, respectively, P = 0. 043]. The location of PR was determined in 36 of these patients. Of these 36 patients, PR occurred at the cusp with the highest AVC in 20 patients (56 %, χ(2) P = 0. 030).

40|$|Globe valves {{are one of}} {{the oldest}} types of valve used for {{throttling}} applications for all sizes due to better controllability and wider range. One of the major limitations associated with the use globe valves in liquid application is cavitation and it takes place both in part open and in fully open conditions due to varied reasons. There are different designs of globe valves available but for control valve applications, cage and plug designs are widely employed. Cage and plug design consists of body, valve cage, plug and an actuating mechanism. Actuating mechanism is connected to the valve plug which is a moving part, through valve shaft. There are many investigations reported about the flow visualization and numerical simulation of normal type globe valves. But study on valves with cage and plug design are not reported in detail. The objective of the present study is to provide a three dimensional analysis of flow through a globe valve with cage and plug design with emphasis on the inception and development of cavitation in detail. Cavitation reduction is achieved by breaking the flow in the form of more than one liquid jet, thereby increasing the turbulence inside the valve flow path. The numerical simulation was done using GAMBIT to set up geometry and grid and FLUENT to solve difference equation postulated from the conservation of mass and momentum of the fluid in motion. The k-epsilon model was used for turbulence. Results of five configurations of the cage with constant flow areas and valve stroke are presented in this paper. The numerical results were verified with an experimental program employing total flow measurement and pressure drop created by the valve at full opening. The study was conducted for different jet configurations to generalize the results of the study. Experimental validation was done in the water test facility with an operating pressure of 1. 6 MPa and flow rate of 0. 05 m 3 /s.
