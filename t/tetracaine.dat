25|$|Common {{side effects}} with {{intravenous}} use include sleepiness, muscle twitching, confusion, changes in vision, numbness, tingling, and vomiting. It can cause low {{blood pressure and}} an irregular heart rate. There are concerns that injecting it into a joint can cause problems with the cartilage. It appears to be generally safe for use in pregnancy. A lower dose may be required in those with liver problems. It is generally safe to use in those allergic to <b>tetracaine</b> or benzocaine. Lidocaine is an antiarrhythmic medication of the class Ib type. Lidocaine works by blocking sodium channels and thus decreasing the rate of contractions of the heart. When used locally as a numbing agent, local neurons cannot signal the brain.|$|E
25|$|Local anesthetics {{are broken}} down into 2 categories: ester-linked and amide-linked drugs. The esters include benzocaine, procaine, <b>tetracaine,</b> and chloroprocaine. The amides include {{lidocaine}}, mepivacaine, prilocaine, bupivacaine, ropivacaine, and levobupivacaine. Chloroprocaine is a short-acting drug (45–90 minutes), lidocaine and mepivacaine are intermediate duration (90–180 minutes), and bupivacaine, levobupivacaine, and ropivacaine are long-acting (4–18 hours). Drugs commonly used for peripheral nerve blocks include lidocaine, ropivacaine, bupivacaine, and mepivacaine. These drugs are often combined with adjuvants (additives) with the end goal of increasing {{the duration of the}} analgesia or shortening time of onset. Additives may include epinephrine, clonidine, and dexmedetomidine. Vasoconstriction caused by local anesthetic may be further enhanced synergistically with the addition of epinephrine, the most widely used additive. Epinephrine increases the length of analgesic duration and decreases blood flow by acting as an agonist at the α1-adrenoceptor. Dexmedetomidine is not as widely used as epinephrine. Studies in humans indicate improved onset time and increased duration of analgesia.|$|E

In February 2007 the FDA notified consumers and healthcare professionals of the potential hazards of topical anesthetics entering the blood stream when applied in large doses to the skin without medical supervision. These topical anesthetics contain anesthetic drugs such as lidocaine, <b>tetracaine,</b> benzocaine, and prilocaine in a cream, ointment, or gel.|$|E
50|$|In {{biomedical}} research, <b>tetracaine</b> is used {{to alter}} the function of calcium release channels (ryanodine receptors) that control the release of calcium from intracellular stores. <b>Tetracaine</b> is an allosteric blocker of channel function. At low concentrations, <b>tetracaine</b> causes an initial inhibition of spontaneous calcium release events, while at high concentrations, <b>tetracaine</b> blocks release completely.|$|E

(Excessive use means several times a day during several days or even weeks.) ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Tetracaine,</b> {{also known}} as amethocaine, is a local {{anesthetic}} used to numb the eyes, nose, or throat. It may also be used before starting an intravenous to decrease pain from the procedure. Typically it is applied as a liquid to the area. Onset of effects when used in the eyes is within 30 seconds and last for less than 15 minutes.|$|E
5000|$|Common {{side effects}} include {{a brief period}} of burning at the site of use. Allergic {{reactions}} may uncommonly occur. Long term use is generally not recommended as it may slow healing of the eye. It is unclear if use during pregnancy is safe for the baby. <b>Tetracaine</b> is in the ester-type local anesthetic family of medications. It works by blocking the sending of nerve impulses.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tetracaine</b> was {{patented}} in 1930 {{and came}} into medical use in 1941. It {{is on the}} World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. The wholesale cost in the developing world is about 1.34 to 1.63 USD per 10 ml bottle. In the United Kingdom the eye drops cost the NHS about 0.49 pounds per dose.|$|E
50|$|Delivery of an opioid such as morphine, hydromorphone, fentanyl, sufentanyl or {{meperidine}} {{directly into}} the subarachnoid cavity (the space between the spinal cord's inner, waterproof sheath and its outer protective sheaths) provides enhanced analgesia with reduced systemic side effects, and has reduced the level of pain in otherwise intractable cases. The anxiolytic clonidine, or the nonopioid analgesic ziconotide, and local anesthetics such as bupivacaine, ropivacaine or <b>tetracaine</b> may also be infused along with the opioid.|$|E
50|$|A topical {{anesthetic}} {{is a local}} anesthetic {{that is used to}} numb {{the surface}} of a body part. They can be used to numb any area of the skin as well as the front of the eyeball, the inside of the nose, ear or throat, the anus and the genital area. Topical anesthetics are available in creams, ointments, aerosols, sprays, lotions, and jellies. Examples include benzocaine, butamben, dibucaine, lidocaine, oxybuprocaine, pramoxine, proparacaine, proxymetacaine, and <b>tetracaine</b> (also named amethocaine).|$|E
50|$|Surface {{anaesthesia}} {{is given}} by instillation of 2.5 ml xylocaine. One drop of xylocaine instilled four times after every 4 minutes will produce conjunctival and corneal anaesthesia. Paracaine, <b>tetracaine,</b> bupivacaine, lidocaine etc. may also be used in place of xylocaine. Cataract surgery by phacoemulsification is frequently performed under surface anaesthesia. Facial nerve, which supplies the orbicularis oculi muscle, is blocked in addition for intraocular surgeries. Topical anaesthesia is known to cause endothelial and epithelial toxicity, allergy and surface keratopathy.|$|E
5000|$|Cetacaine is an {{anesthetic}} {{that contains}} the active ingredients of Benzocaine at 14%, Butamben at 2%, and <b>Tetracaine</b> Hydrochloride at 2%. Cetacaine also contains small amounts of Benzalkonium Chloride at 0.5% and [...]005% of Cetyl Dimethyl Ethyl Ammonium Bromide all in a bland water soluble base. Although Cetacaine has been widely used in the medical, but mainly dental field {{it has yet to}} be officially approved by the FDA. Cetacaine is produced by the company Cetylite Industries, Inc. and they provide Cetacaine in three methods: liquid, gel, and spray.|$|E
5000|$|Lidocaine/tetracaine patch. A {{self-heating}} patch {{containing a}} eutectic mixture of lidocaine and <b>tetracaine</b> {{is available in}} several countries, and has been specifically approved by government agencies for use in needle procedures. The patch is sold under the trade name Synera in the United States and Rapydan in European Union. Each patch is packaged in an air-tight pouch. It begins to heat up slightly when the patch {{is removed from the}} packaging and exposed to the air. The patch requires 20 to 30 minutes to achieve full anesthetic effect. The Synera patch was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration on 23 June 2005.|$|E
50|$|Bupivacaine (Marcaine) is {{the local}} {{anaesthetic}} most commonly used, although lidocaine (lignocaine), <b>tetracaine,</b> procaine, ropivacaine, levobupivicaine, prilocaine and cinchocaine may also be used. Commonly opioids are added to improve the block and provide post-operative pain relief, examples include morphine, fentanyl, diamorphine or buprenorphine. Non-opioids like clonidine may also be added to prolong the duration of analgesia (although Clonidine may cause hypotension). In the United Kingdom, since 2004 the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommends that spinal anaesthesia for Caesarean section is supplemented with intrathecal diamorphine and this combination is now the modal form of anaesthesia for this indication in that country. The peculiar legal status of diamorphine (heroin) means that this cannot easily occur elsewhere.|$|E
50|$|Common {{side effects}} with {{intravenous}} use include sleepiness, muscle twitching, confusion, changes in vision, numbness, tingling, and vomiting. It can cause low {{blood pressure and}} an irregular heart rate. There are concerns that injecting it into a joint can cause problems with the cartilage. It appears to be generally safe for use in pregnancy. A lower dose may be required in those with liver problems. It is generally safe to use in those allergic to <b>tetracaine</b> or benzocaine.

50|$|Cetacaine is an {{anesthetic}} {{that is a}} Benzocaine based {{drug that}} also contains other active ingredients that include Butamben and <b>Tetracaine</b> Hydrochloride. The main use for this drug is to produce anesthesia to mucus membranes to numb and help control the pain in that area. The spray form of Cetacaine {{is also used to}} help prevent gagging in the patient. The anesthetic effect of Cetacaine can be expected to take effect in about 30 seconds and last between 30-60 minutes depending on location and application amount. Cetacaine can and has been used for surgeries that include bronchi, ear, esophagus, larynx, mouth, nose, pharynx, rectal, and vaginal procedures. These procedures can include periodontal treatment, pre-probing, pre-scaling/root planning procedures, pre-injection, and laser dentistry.|$|E
50|$|Baricity is {{one factor}} that determines the spread of a spinal {{anaesthetic}} but {{the effect of adding}} a solute to a solvent, i.e. solvation or dissolution, also has an effect on the spread of the spinal anaesthetic. In <b>tetracaine</b> spinal anaesthesia, it was discovered that the rate of onset of analgesia was faster and the maximum level of analgesia was higher with a 10% glucose solution than with a 5% glucose spinal anaesthetic solution. Also, the amount of ephedrine required was less in the patients who received the 5% glucose solution. In another study this time with 0.5% bupivacaine the mean maximum extent of sensory block was significantly higher with 8% glucose (T3.6) than with 0.83% glucose (T7.2) or 0.33% glucose (T9.5). Also the rate of onset of sensory block to T12 was fastest with solutions containing 8% glucose.|$|E

50|$|Proper {{anesthesia}} {{is essential}} for ocular surgery. Topical anesthesia is most commonly employed, typically by the instillation of a local anesthetic such as <b>tetracaine</b> or lidocaine. Alternatively, lidocaine and/or longer-acting bupivacaine anesthestic may be injected into the area surrounding (peribulbar block) or behind (retrobulbar block) the eye muscle cone to more fully immobilize the extraocular muscles and minimize pain sensation. A facial nerve block using lidocaine and bupivacaine may occasionally be performed to reduce lid squeezing. General anesthesia is recommended for children, traumatic eye injuries with cataract, for very apprehensive or uncooperative patients and animals. Cardiovascular monitoring is preferable in local anesthesia and is mandatory {{in the setting of}} general anesthesia. Proper sterile precautions are taken to prepare the area for surgery, including use of antiseptics like povidone-iodine. Sterile drapes, gowns and gloves are employed. A plastic sheet with a receptacle helps collect the fluids during phacoemulsification. An eye speculum is inserted to keep the eyelids open.|$|E
50|$|Cocaine was {{historically}} {{useful as}} a topical anesthetic in eye and nasal surgery, although it is now predominantly used for nasal and lacrimal duct surgery. The major disadvantages of this use are cocaine's intense vasoconstrictor activity {{and the potential for}} cardiovascular toxicity. Cocaine has since been largely replaced in Western medicine by synthetic local anesthetics such as benzocaine, proparacaine, lidocaine, and <b>tetracaine</b> though it remains available for use if specified. If vasoconstriction is desired for a procedure (as it reduces bleeding), the anesthetic is combined with a vasoconstrictor such as phenylephrine or epinephrine. In Australia it is currently prescribed for use as a local anesthetic for conditions such as mouth and lung ulcers. Some ENT specialists occasionally use cocaine within the practice when performing procedures such as nasal cauterization. In this scenario dissolved cocaine is soaked into a ball of cotton wool, which is placed in the nostril for the 10-15 minutes immediately before the procedure, thus performing the dual role of both numbing the area to be cauterized, and vasoconstriction. Even when used this way, some of the used cocaine may be absorbed through oral or nasal mucosa and give systemic effects. An alternative method of administration for ENT surgery is mixed with adrenaline and sodium bicarbonate, as Moffett's solution.|$|E
50|$|HTX {{acts as a}} noncompetitive {{antagonist}} of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, {{which are}} implicated in neural signaling. As a non-competitive antagonist, HTX binds to a subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.3 This actually increases the affinity for the agonist acetylcholine and stabilizes the desensitized receptor. This blocks action potentials and slows neural function. Histrionicotoxin {{has been shown to}} bind competitively with many local anesthetics, such as <b>tetracaine,</b> as well as other aromatic amine non-competitive antagonists of the receptors, indicating the compounds likely share a binding site; this site of interaction is located ouside the transmembrane domain of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, though the exact interaction remains uncharacterized. While histrionicotoxin does share a binding location with other non-competitive antagonists of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, it has been proven to have relatively higher affinity for desensitized receptors than phencyclidine, indicating further yet uncharacterized subtlety in the nature of its binding. Additionally, studies of the effects of histrionicotoxin on end-plate potential have shown that the compound hinders membrane potential propagation, but has emergent characteristics with membrane hyperpolarizations. The binding of histrionicotoxin is rapidly reversible, and so it can be readily removed from affected regions with repeated washing, or, in vivo, with natural bodily diffusion. High concentrations of HTX have been demonstrated to have antagonistic effects on batrachotoxin.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>tetracaine</b> were {{examined}} on rat ventricular myocytes. In both field-stimulated and voltage-clamped cells <b>tetracaine</b> (100 – 200 μm) produced an initial decrease of contraction before a recovery towards the control level. Removal of <b>tetracaine</b> produced a transient overshoot of contraction to levels {{greater than the}} control. The transient decrease of contraction produced by <b>tetracaine</b> {{was accompanied by a}} small transient increase in the integral of the L-type Ca 2 + current and a larger transient decrease of the Na+-Ca 2 + exchange current on repolarization. These are attributed to decreased systolic release of Ca 2 +. On removal of <b>tetracaine</b> there was an increase of the Na+-Ca 2 + exchange current. Before the addition of <b>tetracaine,</b> calculated Ca 2 + influx and efflux across the sarcolemma were approximately equal. On adding <b>tetracaine,</b> efflux was transiently less than influx and, on removal of <b>tetracaine,</b> efflux was greater than influx. These changes in Ca 2 + fluxes result in an increase of cell Ca 2 + during exposure to <b>tetracaine.</b> The calculated magnitude of this increase was equal to that measured directly by applying caffeine (20 mm) to release sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca 2 + and integrating the resulting Na+-Ca 2 + exchange current. It is concluded that the effects of <b>tetracaine</b> can be accounted for by depression of calcium-induced Ca 2 + release (CICR). The response is transient because the inhibition is compensated for by an increase of SR Ca 2 + content such that there is no steady-state effect on the magnitude of the systolic Ca 2 + transient. The consequences of this result for the effects of other modulators of CICR are discussed...|$|E
40|$|AbstractInteractions of {{two local}} anesthetics, dibucaine and <b>tetracaine</b> {{have been studied}} with {{phospholipid}} vesicles containing cholesterol and/or monosialogangliosides (GM 1) using fluorescence spectroscopy. The fluorescence intensity of <b>tetracaine</b> showed a marked increase with the increasing molar ratio of the phospholipid to <b>tetracaine,</b> while that of dibucaine showed opposite effects. Steady state anisotropy and the wavelength of maximum emission (λmax) decreased with the increasing phospholipids to <b>tetracaine</b> ratio. The extent of such changes in anisotropy and λmax in the presence and absence of two important components of neuronal membranes, cholesterol and GM 1 indicated differential membrane localization of the two local anesthetics. To understand the intercellular mode of action of local anesthetics, we have also studied the interactions of dibucaine and <b>tetracaine</b> with brain spectrin which indicate differential spectrin interactions with similar binding strength. Thermodynamic parameters associated with such binding reveal that binding is favored by entropy. <b>Tetracaine</b> brings about distinct structural changes in spectrin compared to dibucaine, {{as reflected in the}} tryptophan mean lifetime and far-UV CD spectra. <b>Tetracaine</b> also exhibits a detergent-like property inducing concentration dependent decrease in spectrin anisotropy, further indicating structural changes in brain spectrin with probable implications in its anesthetic potential...|$|E
