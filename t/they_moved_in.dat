5|$|In 1970, he met Nicaraguan-born Bianca De Macias. They {{married on}} 12 May 1971 in a Catholic {{ceremony}} in Saint-Tropez, France, and had one child, Jade. They separated in 1977, and in May 1978 she {{filed for divorce}} {{on the grounds of}} his adultery. During his marriage to De Macias, Jagger had an affair with then-Playboy model Bebe Buell from 1974 to 1976. In late 1977, Jagger began dating American model Jerry Hall; <b>they</b> <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> together and had a total of four children.

The marriage to Hall and the marriage ceremony were declared invalid, unlawful, and null and void by the High Court of England and Wales in London in 1999.|$|E
5|$|Milk's {{early career}} {{was marked by}} {{frequent}} changes; in later years he would take delight in talking about his metamorphosis from a middle-class Jewish boy. He began teaching at George W. Hewlett High School on Long Island. In 1956, he met Joe Campbell, at the Jacob Riis Park beach, a popular location for gay men in Queens. Campbell was seven years younger than Milk, and Milk pursued him passionately. Even after <b>they</b> <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> together, Milk wrote Campbell romantic notes and poems. Growing bored with their New York lives, they {{decided to move to}} Dallas, Texas, but they were unhappy there and moved back to New York, where Milk got a job as an actuarial statistician at an insurance firm. Campbell and Milk separated after almost six years; it would be his longest relationship.|$|E

25|$|Sometimes {{distinguished}} from manillas mainly by their wearability {{are a large}} number of regional types called 'Bracelet' monies and 'Legband' monies.

Throughout the day and night, Cleveland firefighters continued to respond to blazes, although <b>they</b> <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> convoys and were protected by National Guardsmen armed with rifles and machine guns.

25|$|For {{both the}} {{parallelogram}} and antiparallelogram linkages, {{if one of}} the long (crossed) edges of the linkage is fixed as a base, the free joints move on equal circles, but <b>in</b> a parallelogram <b>they</b> <b>move</b> <b>in</b> the same direction with equal velocities while <b>in</b> the antiparallelogram <b>they</b> <b>move</b> <b>in</b> opposite directions with unequal velocities. As James Watt discovered, if an antiparallelogram has its long side fixed in this way it forms a variant of Watt's linkage, and the midpoint of the unfixed long edge will trace out a lemniscate or figure eight curve. For the antiparallelogram formed by the sides and diagonals of a square, it is the lemniscate of Bernoulli.|$|R

On March 12, 1988, Wuornos accused a Daytona Beach bus driver of assault. She claimed that he pushed her off the bus following a confrontation. Moore was listed as a witness to the incident. Up until her execution, Wuornos claimed to still be in love with Moore.|$|E
25|$|In 1543, {{the history}} of direct {{contacts}} between Japan and Europe began {{with the arrival of}} storm-blown Portuguese merchants on Tanegashima. Six years later the Jesuit missionary Francis Xavier landed in Kagoshima. At first Portuguese traders were based in Hirado, but <b>they</b> <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> search of a better port. In 1570 daimyō Ōmura Sumitada converted to Catholicism (choosing Bartolomeu as his Christian name) and made a deal with the Portuguese to develop Nagasaki; soon the port was open for trade. In 1580 Sumitada gave the jurisdiction of Nagasaki to the Jesuits, and the Portuguese obtained the de facto monopoly on the silk trade with China through Macau.|$|E

In what became a startling sight for the city's residents, the soldiers were attacked and maimed with the improvised steel objects.

25|$|Richard Cohn {{grew up in}} Oregon in Northeast Portland {{before he}} {{attended}} Stanford University and the Paul H.

He was divorced in 1976, and then met co-founder Cindy Black in 1982 in Hawaii after the family business was sold. <b>They</b> <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> together and later married. A fortune teller had foretold of the meeting, {{and that he would}} move to Hawaii. Both Cohn and Black took a New Age class at the Burklyn Business School in California, which helped lay the foundation for starting Beyond Words. In Hawaii, Cohn met a photographer who knew his sister, and with publisher Bob Goodman started a publishing company to produce the photographer’s work.|$|E
25|$|Disillusioned {{with the}} route that the {{communist}} powers were taking, and wanting {{nothing more to}} do with the Soviet Union and its allies in Britain, he took up a job working first for R.H. Radford, a public relations firm and then Associated British Pathé where he eventually rose to the position of documentary writer. Meanwhile, his continued infidelity led to him and Kaplin separating in 1953, although it would only be in 1963 that he finally gained a divorce from her. During this time, he had entered into a new relationship with a woman named Beth Donovan, and she encouraged him to continue seeing his children from previous relationships, whom in later life he always regretted neglecting; in 1958 however, they too split up. In 1959, he began yet another relationship, this time with a geography teacher named Barbara Williams, and <b>they</b> <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> together after only 11 days of first meeting. They would divorce in 1967, before remarrying in 1968, subsequently breaking up again the following year.|$|E
25|$|To get to {{the rich}} new lands of the West Coast, there were two options: some sailed around the {{southern}} tip of South America during a six-month voyage, but 400,000 others walked there on an overland route of more than 2,000 miles (3,000km); their wagon trains usually left from Missouri. <b>They</b> <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> large groups under an experienced wagonmaster, bringing their clothing, farm supplies, weapons, and animals. These wagon trains followed major rivers, crossed prairies and mountains, and typically ended in Oregon and California. Pioneers generally attempted to complete the journey during a single warm season, usually over the course of six months. By 1836, when the first migrant wagon train was organized in Independence, Missouri, a wagon trail had been cleared to Fort Hall, Idaho. Trails were cleared further and further west, eventually reaching {{all the way to the}} Willamette Valley in Oregon. This network of wagon trails leading to the Pacific Northwest was later called the Oregon Trail. The eastern half of the route was also used by travelers on the California Trail (from 1843), Mormon Trail (from 1847), and Bozeman Trail (from 1863) before they turned off to their separate destinations.|$|E
