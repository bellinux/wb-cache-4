5|$|Beginning in 1558, {{with the}} {{invention}} of the patio process <b>to</b> <b>extract</b> silver from ore using mercury, mercury became an essential resource in the economy of Spain and its American colonies. Mercury was used <b>to</b> <b>extract</b> silver from the lucrative mines in New Spain and Peru. Initially, the Spanish Crown's mines in Almadén in Southern Spain supplied all the mercury for the colonies. Mercury deposits were discovered in the New World, and more than 100,000 tons of mercury were mined from the region of Huancavelica, Peru, over the course of three centuries following the discovery of deposits there in 1563. The patio process and later pan amalgamation process continued to create great demand for mercury to treat silver ores until the late 19th century.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a classification {{and evaluation of}} human summary production operations used <b>to</b> transform <b>extracts</b> into more concise, coherent and readable abstracts. Computer-aided summarisation (CAS) allows a user to post-edit an automatically produced <b>extract</b> <b>to</b> improve it. However, unlike other areas of summarisation, no guidance is available to users of CAS systems to help them complete their task. The research reported here addresses this by examining linguistic operations used by a human summariser <b>to</b> transform <b>extracts</b> into abstracts. An evaluation proves that the operations are useful; they do improve coherence when applied <b>to</b> <b>extracts...</b>|$|R

5|$|In 1992 {{an attempt}} was made <b>to</b> <b>extract</b> a {{mitochondrial}} DNA sequence from the skeletal remains of C.d.guildayi to compare its relationship to other Canis species.

In 2014 an attempt <b>to</b> <b>extract</b> DNA from a Columbian mammoth from the tar pits also failed, with the study concluding that organic compounds from the asphalt permeate the bones of all ancient samples from the LaBrea pits, hindering the extraction of DNA samples.|$|E
5|$|In medieval Germany, a red mineral {{was found}} in the Erzgebirge (Ore Mountains) that resembled copper ore. However, when miners were unable <b>to</b> <b>extract</b> any copper from it, they blamed a mischievous sprite of German mythology, Nickel (similar to Old Nick), for besetting the copper. They called this ore Kupfernickel from the German Kupfer for copper. This ore is now known to be nickeline (aka niccolite), a nickel arsenide. In 1751, Baron Axel Fredrik Cronstedt tried <b>to</b> <b>extract</b> copper from {{kupfernickel}} at a cobalt mine in the Swedish village of Los, and instead produced a white metal that he named after the spirit that had given its name to the mineral, nickel. In modern German, Kupfernickel or Kupfer-Nickel designates the alloy cupronickel.|$|E
