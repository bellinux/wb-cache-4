25|$|Sir William {{carried out}} {{extensive}} research into common design faults {{and came up}} with his own grenade, which had a central spring-loaded firing-pin and spring-loaded lever locked by a pin. A four-second <b>time</b> <b>fuse</b> allowed the thrower to take cover before it exploded. His bombs were used exclusively and successfully by the British and other Allies throughout the war and 75,000,000 were supplied. His services were rewarded by a Knighthood in 1922.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the bombing}} of the British embassy in Rome, October 1946, a series of {{operations}} against targets in the United Kingdom were launched. On 7 March 1947, Lehi's only successful operation in Britain was carried out when a Lehi bomb severely damaged the British Colonial Club, a London recreational facility for soldiers and students from Britain's colonies in Africa and the West Indies. On 15 April 1947 a bomb consisting of twenty-four sticks of explosives was planted in the Colonial Office, Whitehall. It failed to explode due to a fault in the timer. Five weeks later, on 22 May, five alleged Lehi members were arrested in Paris with bomb making material including explosives of the same type as found in London. On 2 June, two Lehi members, Betty Knouth and Yaakov Levstien, were arrested crossing from Belgium to France. Envelopes addressed to British officials, with detonators, batteries and a <b>time</b> <b>fuse</b> were found in one of Knouth's suitcases. Knouth was sentenced to a year in prison, Levstien to eight months. The British Security Services identified Knouth as the person who planted the bomb in the Colonial Office. Shortly after their arrest, 21 letter bombs were intercepted addressed to senior British figures. The letters had been posted in Italy. The intended recipients included Bevin, Attlee, Churchill and Eden. Knouth aka Gilberte/Elizabeth Lazarus. Levstein was travelling as Jacob Elias; his fingerprints connected him to the deaths of several Palestine Policemen as well as an attempt on the life of the British High Commissioner. In 1973, Margaret Truman wrote that letter bombs were also posted to her father, U.S. President Harry S. Truman, in 1947. Former Lehi leader Yellin-Mor admitted that letter bombs had been sent to British targets but denied that any had been sent to Truman.|$|E

The ships began construction with only four turrets, but two additional turrets were restored to the quarterdeck in January 1941. They could elevate {{to a maximum of}} 85° and depress to −8°. They could traverse at a rate of 12° per second and elevate at 10° per second.

2500|$|Perhaps {{the menace}} {{best suited for}} the design {{specifications}} of such an automated artillery system appeared in June 1944. Not surprisingly it was another robot. The German Aeronautical Engineers aided by Wernher von Braun produced a robot of their own; the V-1 flying bomb, an automatically guided bomb and widely considered a precursor of the cruise missile. Its flight specifications almost perfectly suited the target design criteria of Director T-10, that of an aircraft flying straight and level at constant velocity, in other words a target nicely fitting the computing capabilities of a linear predictor model such as the Director T-10. Although the Germans did have a trick up their engineering sleeve by making the bomb fly fast and low to evade radar, a technique widely adopted even today. During the London Blitz one hundred Director T-10 assisted 90mm automated gun units were {{set up in a}} perimeter south of London, at the special request of Winston Churchill. The AA units included the SCR-584 radar unit produced by the Radiation Lab at MIT and the proximity fuse mechanism, developed by Merle Tuve and his special Division T at NDRC, that detonated near the target using a microwave controlled fuse called the VT or variable <b>time</b> <b>fuse,</b> enabling a larger detonation reach envelope and increasing the chances of a successful outcome. Between June 18 and July 17, 1944, 343 V-1 bombs were shot down or 10% of the total V-1 number sent by the Germans and about 20% of the total V-1 bombs shot down. From July 17 to August 31 the automated gun kills rose to 1286 V-1 rockets or 34% [...] of the total V-1 number dispatched from Germany and 50% of the V-1 actually shot down over London. From these statistics {{it can be seen that}} the automated systems that Bode helped design had a considerable impact on crucial battles of World War II. It can also be seen that London at the time of the Blitz became, among other things, the original robot battlefield.|$|E

5000|$|In 1939, the Japanese {{introduced}} the Type 89 grenade discharger, the Type 91 fragmentation grenade was {{fitted with a}} propellant base and <b>time</b> <b>fuse.</b> It did not explode upon contact, but was designed to ignite its fuse while in flight. A weak creep spring inside the grenade firing mechanism allowed the firing pin to be thrown back upon launching, igniting a <b>time</b> <b>fuse</b> with a 7-8 second delay. Using this system, the Type 91 grenades could be launched through jungle cover or through small openings without the danger of premature detonation in the event the grenade struck an object {{on its way to}} the target. [...] Although the Type 89 could be fired by a single person, it was typically operated with a crew of 3, enabling it to reach a rate of fire of about 25 rounds per minute.|$|E

5000|$|Timed fuse: In a <b>timed</b> <b>fuse</b> grenade, {{the fuse}} is ignited on {{release of the}} safety lever, and {{detonation}} occurs following a <b>timed</b> delay. Timed <b>fuse</b> grenades are generally preferred to hand-thrown percussion grenades because their fusing mechanisms are safer and more robust than those used in percussion grenades. Fuses are frequently fixed, though the Russian UZRGM (УЗРГМ) fuses are interchangeable and allow the delay to be varied, or replaced by a zero-delay pull fuse. This is potentially dangerous due {{to the risk of}} confusion.|$|R
50|$|Alder {{buckthorn}} charcoal is prized in {{the manufacture}} of gunpowder, being regarded as the best wood for the purpose.
