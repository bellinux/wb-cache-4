5|$|As the {{campaign}} entered its final week, polls showed Specter and Sestak {{at a dead}} heat, with different surveys reporting contradictory findings over which candidate maintained a slight edge. A Quinnipiac University poll found Specter leading 44-42 percent, with fourteen percent undecided, whereas a Franklin & Marshall poll found Sestak ahead 38-36 percent, with {{about a quarter of}} voters undecided. In both cases, the lead fell within the survey's margin of error. G. Terry Madonna, director of the Franklin & Marshall poll, said that Sestak improved because his television commercials were resonating with voters on three fronts: <b>the</b> <b>arguments</b> <b>that</b> Specter switched parties for solely political reasons, that he consistently voted for Republican policies and that he had been in office too long.|$|E
5|$|The {{motion was}} {{rejected}} by 5 votes to 7 after discussions. According to Benny Morris, <b>the</b> <b>arguments</b> <b>that</b> were advanced not to launch the attack were: the negative international repercussions for Israel already accentuated by the recent assassination of Count Bernadotte; the consequences of an attack on an agreement with Abdallah; the fact that defeating the Arab Legion could provoke a British military intervention because of Britain and Jordan's common defense pact and lastly because conquering this area would add {{hundreds of thousands of}} Arab citizens to Israel.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>arguments</b> <b>that</b> {{led to the}} {{cancellation}} of the B-70 program had led some to question {{the need for a}} new strategic bomber of any sort. The USAF was adamant about retaining bombers as part of the nuclear triad concept that included bombers, ICBMs, and submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) in a combined package that complicated any potential defense. They argued that the bomber was needed to attack hardened military targets and to provide a safe counterforce option because the bombers could be quickly launched into safe loitering areas where they could not be attacked. However, the introduction of the SLBM made moot the mobility and survivability argument, and a newer generation of ICBMs, such as the Minuteman III, had the accuracy and speed needed to attack point targets. During this time, ICBMs were seen as a less costly option based on their lower unit cost, but development costs were much higher. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara preferred ICBMs over bombers for the Air Force portion of the deterrent force and felt a new expensive bomber was not needed. McNamara limited the AMSA program to studies and component development beginning in 1964.|$|E

25|$|During {{a period}} of 13 years (1980–1993) for which admissions to the Kfar Shaul Mental Health Centre in Jerusalem were analyzed, it was {{reported}} that 1,200 tourists with severe, Jerusalem-themed mental problems, were referred to this clinic. Of these, 470 were admitted to hospital. On average, 100 such tourists have been seen annually, 40 of them requiring admission to hospital. About 2 million tourists visit Jerusalem each year. Kalian and Witztum note that as a proportion of the total numbers of tourists visiting the city, this is not significantly different from any other city. The statements of these claims has however been disputed, with <b>the</b> <b>arguments</b> <b>that</b> experiencers of the Jerusalem syndrome already were mentally ill.|$|E
25|$|One approach, {{suggested}} by {{writers such as}} Stephen D. Unwin, is to treat (particular versions of) theism and naturalism {{as though they were}} two hypotheses in the Bayesian sense, to list certain data (or alleged data), about the world, and to suggest that the likelihoods of these data are significantly higher under one hypothesis than the other. Most of the arguments for, or against, the existence of God can be seen as pointing to particular aspects of the universe in this way. In almost all cases it is not seriously {{suggested by}} proponents of <b>the</b> <b>arguments</b> <b>that</b> they are irrefutable, merely that they make one worldview seem significantly more likely than the other. However, since an assessment of the weight of evidence depends on the prior probability that is assigned to each worldview, arguments that a theist finds convincing may seem thin to an atheist and vice versa.|$|E

25|$|Throughout {{the early}} years of the war, British foreign {{secretary}} Lord John Russell, Emperor Napoleon III of France, and, to a lesser extent, British Prime Minister Lord Palmerston, showed interest in recognition of the Confederacy or at least mediation of the war. William Ewart Gladstone, the British finance minister whose family wealth was based on slavery, was the key advocate calling for intervention to help the Confederacy achieve independence. He failed to convince prime minister Palmerston. By September 1862 the Union victory at the Battle of Antietam, Lincoln's preliminary Emancipation Proclamation and abolitionist opposition in Britain put an end to these possibilities. The cost to Britain of a war with the U.S. would have been high: the immediate loss of American grain shipments, the end of exports to the U.S., and the seizure of billions of pounds invested in American securities. War would have meant higher taxes, another invasion of Canada, and full-scale worldwide attacks on the British merchant fleet. Outright recognition would have meant certain war with the United States; in mid-1862 fears of race war as had transpired in Haiti led to the British considering intervention for humanitarian reasons. Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation did not lead to interracial violence let alone a bloodbath, but it did give the friends of the Union strong talking points in <b>the</b> <b>arguments</b> <b>that</b> raged across Britain.|$|E

500|$|Though his {{research}} interests were always {{in line with}} those of the German historicists, with a strong emphasis on interpreting economic history, Weber's defence of [...] "methodological individualism" [...] in the social sciences represented an important break with that school and an embracing of many of <b>the</b> <b>arguments</b> <b>that</b> had been made against the historicists by Carl Menger, the founder of the Austrian School of economics, {{in the context of the}} academic Methodenstreit ("debate over methods") of the late 19th century. The phrase [...] "methodological individualism", which has come into common usage in modern debates about the connection between microeconomics and macroeconomics, was coined by the Austrian-American economist Joseph Schumpeter in 1908 as a way of referring to the views of Weber. According to Weber's theses, social research cannot be fully inductive or descriptive, because understanding some phenomenon implies that the researcher must go beyond mere description and interpret it; interpretation requires classification according to abstract [...] "ideal (pure) types". This, together with his antipositivistic argumentation (see Verstehen), can be taken as a methodological justification for the model of the [...] "rational economic man" [...] (homo economicus), which is at the heart of modern mainstream economics.|$|E
500|$|Among {{the most}} {{significant}} acquaintances Keable made at Cambridge were two brothers among the fellowship, Arthur and Hugh Benson. The Bensons were sons of a highly accomplished academic and religious family; their father, Edward White Benson, was Archbishop of Canterbury and their mother, Mary Sidgwick Benson, the sister of the philosopher Henry Sidgwick, {{had set up a}} lesbian household with Lucy Tait (daughter of the previous archbishop of Canterbury) after her husband's death. In the years just before Keable came to Cambridge Hugh Benson (the inspiration for Keable's character [...] "Father Vassall" [...] in Peradventure (1921)) had departed from the Anglicanism of his upbringing in favour of the Roman Catholic Church, being ordained a Catholic priest in 1904. According to Keable's contemporaries, the two met when Edouardo Ginistrelli, a neighbour on Keable's staircase, invited them both to lunch: [...] "Keable ... fell under the spell of Fr Benson's winning personality," [...] wrote James I. James, a college acquaintance of Keable's: [...] "Keable's Anglican loyalty remained, but it was a new kind of loyalty. He spoke no more of Protestantism but always of Catholicism... in Chapel he now genuflected and crossed himself. A strange mystic element deep down in his being began to stir... I often suspected that Fr Benson had posed to this clever mind – for Keable was clever – <b>the</b> <b>arguments</b> <b>that</b> had recently brought himself to Catholicism." [...] Benson was also a novelist and, under his influence, the sensory, aesthetic dimension of Keable's own writing (and of his faith) began to develop. Benson sensed in Keable an [...] "inclination to Rome", but Keable elected for the Anglican priesthood, joining the theological college of Westcott House and serving as canon at Bradford after completing his studies.|$|E
500|$|Benn {{asserted}} that the teachings of Jesus Christ had a [...] "radical political importance" [...] on his life, and made {{a distinction between the}} historical Jesus as [...] "a carpenter of Nazareth" [...] who advocated social justice and egalitarianism and [...] "the way in which he's presented by some religious authorities; by popes, archbishops and bishops who present Jesus as justification for their power", believing this to be a gross misunderstanding of the role of Jesus. He believed that it was a [...] "great mistake" [...] to assume that the teachings of Christianity are outdated in modern Britain, and Higgins wrote in The Benn Inheritance that Benn was [...] "a socialist whose political commitment owes much more to the teaching of Jesus than the writing of Marx". Later in his life, Benn emphasised issues regarding morality and righteousness, as well as various ethical principles of Nonconformism. [...] "I've never thought we can understand the world we lived in unless we understood the history of the church", Benn said to the Catholic Herald. [...] "All political freedoms were won, first of all, through religious freedom. Some of the arguments about the control of the media today, which are very big arguments, are <b>the</b> <b>arguments</b> <b>that</b> would have been fought in the religious wars. You have the satellites coming in now – well, it is the multinational church all over again. That's why Mrs Thatcher pulled Britain out of UNESCO: she was not prepared, any more than Ronald Reagan was, to be part of an organisation that talked about a New World Information Order, people speaking to each other without the help of Murdoch or Maxwell." [...] According to Peter Wilby in the New Statesman, Benn [...] "decided to do without the paraphernalia and doctrine of organised religion but not without the teachings of Jesus". Although Benn became more agnostic as he became older, he was intrigued by the interconnections between Christianity, radicalism and socialism. Wilby also wrote in The Guardian that although former Chancellor Stafford Cripps described Benn as [...] "as keen a Christian as I am myself", Benn wrote in 2005 that he was [...] "a Christian agnostic" [...] who believed [...] "in Jesus the prophet, not Christ the king", specifically rejecting the label of [...] "humanist".|$|E
