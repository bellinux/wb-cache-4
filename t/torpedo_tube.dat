5|$|Between 1907 and 1910, {{the ships}} {{of the class}} were heavily rebuilt, with the {{exception}} of Kaiser Karl der Grosse. During the modernization, the ships had their superstructures cut down. Four 15cm guns and one <b>torpedo</b> <b>tube</b> were also removed. The ships' 8.8cm guns were repositioned to the upper decks where the 15cm guns had been located. Also, the smoke stacks were lengthened.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} the Ibuki class was a minor {{improvement}} over the last pair of the Mogami class after those ships had been upgraded during the late 1930s. The main improvement was {{the replacement of the}} triple <b>torpedo</b> <b>tube</b> mounts in the older ships with quadruple mounts. They cost 60,000,000 yen each and had a crew of 54 officers and 822 enlisted men.|$|E
5|$|The ship mounted four 45-calibre 4.7-inch Mark IX guns {{in single}} mounts. For {{anti-aircraft}} (AA) defence, Delight {{had a single}} 12-pounder (3-inch (76.2mm)) gun between her funnels and two quadruple Mark I mounts for the 0.5-inch Vickers Mark III machine gun. She was fitted with two above-water quadruple <b>torpedo</b> <b>tube</b> mounts for 21-inch torpedoes. One depth charge rail and two throwers were fitted; 20 depth charges were originally carried, but this increased to 35 shortly after the war began.|$|E
50|$|Akulas (excluding Nerpa) {{are armed}} with four 533 mm <b>torpedo</b> <b>tubes</b> which can use Type 53 torpedoes or the SS-N-15 Starfish missile, and four 650 mm <b>torpedo</b> <b>tubes</b> which can use Type 65 torpedoes or the SS-N-16 Stallion missile. These <b>torpedo</b> <b>tubes</b> are {{arranged}} in two rows of four tubes each. Improved Akulas, Akula IIs have an additional six 533 mm <b>torpedo</b> <b>tubes</b> mounted externally, capable of launching possibly up to 6 decoys each. The external tubes are mounted outside the pressure hull in one row, above the <b>torpedo</b> <b>tubes,</b> and can only be reloaded in port or {{with the assistance of}} a submarine tender. The 650 mm tubes can be fitted with liners to use the 533 mm weaponry. The submarine is also able to use its <b>torpedo</b> <b>tubes</b> to deploy mines.|$|R

5|$|The Wittelsbach class {{represented}} an incremental {{improvement over the}} preceding Kaiser Friedrich III class. They were equipped with the same armament of four 24cm guns, but were given an additional <b>torpedo</b> <b>tube.</b> They had improved defensive capabilities, as they were protected by a more extensive armored belt. They also differed from the preceding ships in their main deck, {{the entire length of}} which was flush. The Kaiser Friedrich III had a cut-down quarterdeck. The ships of the class, which included Wittelsbach, Wettin, Zähringen, Schwaben, and Mecklenburg, were the first battleships built under the first Naval Law of 1898.|$|E
5|$|The ship mounted four 4.7-inch Mk IX guns {{in single}} mounts, {{designated}} 'A', 'B', 'X', and 'Y' {{from front to}} rear.

5|$|On 11 June she was {{commissioned}} by the RCN and renamed Restigouche, although her refit was not completed until 20 August. Restigouche {{was assigned to the}} Canadian Pacific Coast and arrived at Esquimalt on 7 November 1938. She remained there until she was ordered to Halifax, Nova Scotia on 15 November 1939 where she escorted local convoys, including the convoy carrying half of the 1st Canadian Infantry Division to the UK on 10 December. Restigouche was ordered to Plymouth on 24 May 1940 and arrived there on 31 May. Upon arrival, the ship's rear <b>torpedo</b> <b>tube</b> mount was removed and replaced by a 12-pounder AA gun and the 2-pounders were exchanged for quadruple Mark I mounts for the QF 0.5-inch Vickers Mark III machine gun.|$|E
5|$|Grand Admiral Erich Raeder, the {{commander}} of the Kriegsmarine, proposed on 13 November that Tirpitz be deployed to Norway. The ship would be able to attack convoys bound for the Soviet Union, as well as act as a fleet in being to tie down British naval assets and deter an Allied invasion of Norway. Hitler, who had forbidden an Atlantic sortie after the loss of Bismarck, agreed to the proposal. The ship was taken into dock for modifications for the deployment. The ship's antiaircraft battery was strengthened, and the 10.5cm guns on the superstructure next to the catapult were moved outboard to increase their field of fire. The two quadruple 53.3cm <b>torpedo</b> <b>tube</b> mounts were also installed during this refit. The ship's commander, Kapitän zur See (KzS—Captain at Sea) Karl Topp, pronounced the ship ready for combat operations on 10 January 1942. The following day, Tirpitz left for Wilhelmshaven, a move designed to conceal her actual destination.|$|E
500|$|Imperator Aleksandr II carried five above-water [...] <b>torpedo</b> <b>tubes,</b> {{two in the}} bow, two {{broadside}} tubes {{that could}} traverse 70° and a tube in the stern. Smaller [...] <b>torpedo</b> <b>tubes</b> could be mounted {{in four of the}} ship's cutters. 36 mines could be carried. Imperator Nikolai I had six <b>torpedo</b> <b>tubes</b> were that were arranged differently. Only one was in the bow, four were on the broadside, two forward and aft, and the usual stern tube.|$|R
2500|$|Zwaardvisch was [...] long, had {{a beam of}} [...] and a draught of [...] {{forward and}} [...] aft. She {{displaced}} 1,290 tons surfaced and 1,560 tons submerged.

5|$|A shorter {{period of}} {{dockyard}} work took place from 7 December to 27 January 1908. She {{returned to the}} fleet for the normal peacetime routine of training exercises, and after {{the conclusion of the}} autumn maneuvers, Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse was decommissioned in Kiel on 21 September. She was taken into the Kaiserliche Werft shipyard in Kiel for an extensive modernization that lasted until 1910. During the refit, four of the ship's 15cm guns and the stern-mounted <b>torpedo</b> <b>tube</b> were removed. Two 8.8cm guns were added and the arrangement of the 8.8cm battery was modified. Her superstructure was also cut down to reduce the ship's tendency to roll excessively, and the ship's funnels were lengthened. After reconstruction, the ship was assigned to the Reserve Division in the Baltic, along with her sister ships. She was reactivated on 31 July 1911 and assigned to the III Squadron during the annual fleet exercises, then returned on 15 September to the Reserve Division. She remained there {{for the rest of her}} peacetime career.|$|E
5|$|During the modernization, four of her 15cm {{guns were}} removed and two 8.8cm guns were added. All twelve 1-pounder guns were removed, {{as was the}} ship's stern-mounted <b>torpedo</b> <b>tube.</b> Kaiser Barbarossas {{superstructure}} was also cut down to reduce the ship's tendency to roll excessively and her military masts were replaced with lighter pole masts. The ship's funnels were also lengthened. Kaiser Barbarossas modernization was completed by 1 October 1907, when she was recommissioned for service. By that time, the newest s were coming into service; along with the s, these provided enough modern battleships to create two full battle squadrons. Consequently, the Heimatflotte was renamed the Hochseeflotte (High Seas Fleet). Kaiser Barbarossa returned to {{her place in the}} I Squadron and she participated in the normal routine of divisional, squadron, and fleet maneuvers and cruises without incident over the next year. The summer fleet cruise in May that year went to the Azores and returned to Kiel on 13 August. The autumn maneuvers lasted from 27 August to 7 September. Divisional exercises in the Baltic immediately followed from 7 to 13 September.|$|E
5|$|Marco Polo, {{named after}} the eponymous explorer, was laid down on 1 July 1890 at the Royal Shipyard in Castellammare di Stabia. The ship was {{launched}} on 27 October 1892 and completed on 21 July 1894. She visited Heraklion, Crete and Piraeus, Greece in May 1897 before departing for the Far East on 26 January 1898. In May, Marco Polo sailed up the Yangtze River to make port visits at Nanking and Hankow before returning to Shanghai in July. She visited Japan from August to November and then sailed to Shanghai where she remained until August 1899. The ship departed Shanghai on 27 August and arrived in Naples on 20 October 1899. Marco Polo departed for China in October 1901 and remained there until February 1903. A year later, she began her third tour there in March 1904 and did not leave China until 14 January 1907. En route home the ship visited Zanzibar, Mogadishu, Italian Somaliland, and Massawa, Eritrea before arriving at Taranto on 26 April. Marco Polo was rearmed in 1911 and her armament was reduced to six 152mm, four 120mm, six 57mm, and two 37mm guns. One <b>torpedo</b> <b>tube</b> was also removed during this refit.|$|E
5000|$|Zwaardvisch was 276 ft long, had {{a beam of}} 25 ft and a draught of 12 ft {{forward and}} 14 ft aft. She {{displaced}} 1,290 tons surfaced and 1,560 tons submerged.

50|$|The {{secondary}} armament {{consisted of}} four 4 in QF Mark V guns and two 2-pounder guns. Two triple 21 in <b>torpedo</b> <b>tubes</b> were carried. This {{was similar to}} the County class, with the exception that the Yorks carried two fewer <b>torpedo</b> <b>tubes,</b> because of the narrower beam.|$|R
5|$|Together {{with her}} sister , Cygnet was sold to Canada on 20 October 1936 for a total price of £400,000. She was {{refitted}} again to meet Canadian standards, including the installation of Type 124 ASDIC, and handed over on 1 February 1937. The ship was renamed as HMCS St. Laurent and commissioned into the RCN on 17 February. St. Laurent was assigned to Halifax, Nova Scotia and arrived there in May. She remained there for a year before she was transferred to Esquimalt in 1938. The ship remained there until she was ordered to the East Coast on 31 August 1939, arriving at Halifax on 18 September. St. Laurent escorted local convoys while based there, including the convoy carrying half of the 1st Canadian Infantry Division to the UK on 10 December. The ship was ordered to Plymouth on 24 May 1940 and arrived there on 31 May. Upon arrival, the ship's rear <b>torpedo</b> <b>tube</b> mount was removed and replaced by a 12-pounder AA gun and the 2-pounders were exchanged for quadruple Mark I mounts for the QF 0.5-inch Vickers Mark III machine gun.|$|E
