5|$|In all Zveno configurations, all {{aircraft}} were piloted and all {{had their}} engines running — {{it was expected}} that the combined thrust would more than offset the weight and actually improve the performance of the mothership compared to conventional bombers. <b>The</b> <b>fighters</b> were rigidly attached via pyramid-shaped metal frames, with both latches controlled by the fighter pilots. (On Zveno-1, the front latches were controlled by the bomber crew, while the back latch was controlled by the pilot; this was changed to all-pilot control in the next version). The original design included umbilical fuel lines which permitted <b>the</b> <b>fighters</b> to use fuel from the bomber while attached, although this was not fully implemented in practice.|$|E

5|$|After {{a heated}} week of pre-fight confrontations, fans were expecting {{something}} special from Danny Garcia vs. Zab Judah. And <b>the</b> <b>fighters</b> delivered, though in an unanticipated fashion. From early {{on it was}} clear that the bad blood would not adversely impact the fight, as both men fought strong technical fights.|$|E
5|$|Although most U.S. {{aircraft}} losses {{continued to}} be inflicted by anti-aircraft fire, U.S. Air Force F-105s and Navy A-4 Skyhawks increasingly encountered SAMs and MiGs. North Vietnamese fighters also became a particular problem {{because of the lack}} of radar coverage in the Red River Delta region, which allowed the MiGs to surprise the strike forces. Airborne early warning aircraft had difficulty detecting <b>the</b> <b>fighters</b> at low altitudes and the aircraft themselves were difficult to see visually.|$|E
50|$|Technical {{knockouts}} {{can also}} occur in shoot boxing, {{in cases where}} <b>the</b> <b>fighter</b> is injured, <b>the</b> referee rules <b>the</b> <b>fighter</b> knocked out after two knockdowns in the same round, or <b>the</b> <b>fighter's</b> corner throws in the towel. A fight may also be stopped if a doctor rules that continuation would be dangerous to a fighter.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>fighter</b> {{then came}} {{at them from}} the rear. As it approached, Takahara blazed away at it with the cannon. At the same time shots from <b>the</b> <b>fighter</b> tore through <b>the</b> body of the flying-boat.

5|$|Claudius, {{the fourth}} Roman Emperor of the Julio-Claudian dynasty, ruled the Roman Empire {{following}} Caligula's death in AD 41 {{until his death}} in AD 54. According to Suetonius, Claudius was extraordinarily fond of the games. He is said to have risen with the crowd after gladiatorial matches and given unrestrained praise to <b>the</b> <b>fighters,</b> and he was criticized for not leaving the arena during the executions as was the custom among the noble classes.|$|E
5|$|For Commander-in-Chief of the Luftwaffe Hermann Göring it was {{an ongoing}} concern that {{inadequate}} numbers of fighters were able to continually engage the bomber streams, {{at the very time}} that the USAAF's 8th Air Force's new commander, Maj. Gen. Jimmy Doolittle had instituted a new fighter strategy against the Luftwaffe. Hence on 23 February 1944 — near the midpoint of the USAAF's Big Week bomber offensive against the Luftwaffe, also being carried out by the 15th Air Force flying out of Italian bases — Generalmajor Joseph Schmid Commander of I. Jagdkorps established a new rule for <b>the</b> <b>fighters</b> returning to base. They were to arrive at the nearest designated fighter airfield for resupply instead of returning to their own base. They were to be commanded by the senior pilot landing on that airfield, irrespective of their unit. This was meant to turn around <b>the</b> <b>fighters</b> in time to intercept returning bombers.|$|E
5|$|In late August {{to early}} September, Argus transported 24 Hurricanes of No. 151 Wing RAF to Murmansk, Russia. She then ferried a dozen Fairey Albacore torpedo bombers of 828 Squadron to Gibraltar on 30 September for {{eventual}} delivery to Malta. She was to ferry <b>the</b> <b>fighters</b> of 804 Squadron on her return trip to England, {{but this was}} cancelled. Eventually, the ship loaded some damaged aircraft and accompanied Eagle back to the United Kingdom on 20 October. Argus loaded more Hurricanes for Gibraltar and also embarked a pair of Swordfish from 818 Squadron and two Sea Hurricanes from 804X Squadron for self-defence. The ship arrived on 8 November and she transferred some of her Hurricanes to Ark Royal. Two days later, the two carriers, in Operation Perpetual, sailed {{to the west of}} Sicily and flew off their 37 Hurricanes; three of <b>the</b> <b>fighters</b> were lost en route. Ark Royal was torpedoed and sunk during the return to Gibraltar, which forced Argus to remain there to provide cover for Force H as the sole carrier available.|$|E
50|$|With {{infrared}} homing or fire-and-forget missiles, <b>the</b> <b>fighter</b> {{may be able}} to fire {{upon the}} target without having to turn its radar sets on at all. Otherwise, <b>the</b> <b>fighter</b> can turn <b>the</b> radar on and achieve a lock immediately before firing if desired. <b>The</b> <b>fighter</b> could also close to within cannon range and engage that way.|$|R
50|$|The 2002 Army Combatives manual {{dictates}} that <b>the</b> <b>fighter</b> should first {{ensure that the}} enemy's head goes underneath one of their arms. <b>The</b> <b>fighter</b> wraps their arm around the enemy's head and under their neck. <b>The</b> <b>fighter's</b> palm should be facing their own chest. With the other hand, <b>the</b> <b>fighter</b> grasps <b>the</b> first hand, ensuring {{that they have not}} reached around the enemy's arm, and pulls upward with both hands. They now sit down and place the enemy within their guard, and finish the choke by pulling with their arms and pushing with their legs.|$|R
5000|$|... <b>the</b> <b>Fighter</b> needs {{a second}} who is {{responsible}} for ammunition of the sportsman during a duel ("to tie up a helmet, to fix overlays, a protector, to tie up a belt kimono and another)" [...] as fighter not in condition independently to solve these problems in taken away on the amendment of ammunition time. During a duel the second settles down on a chair behind a place of <b>the</b> <b>fighter.</b> Thus during a duel it is forbidden to second to give to <b>the</b> <b>fighter</b> any commands or councils. For conversations with the second to <b>the</b> <b>fighter</b> <b>the</b> remark can be made, and at repeated infringement — prevention.|$|R
5|$|Internationally, the People’s Republic of China was {{identified}} as a possible export customer. Russia's state weapons exporter, Rosoboronexport, was previously negotiating an order of 50 aircraft totalling US$2.5 billion. China would have initially acquired two aircraft worth $100million for testing and then have further options to acquire an additional 12–48 aircraft. <b>The</b> <b>fighters</b> were intended to be used with the fledgling Chinese aircraft carrier programme, with the former Soviet carrier Varyag as the centrepiece.|$|E
5|$|Kampfgeschwader 27 (KG 27) bombed Liverpool {{during the}} night at 10:48. Widespread damage was caused {{in the city and}} {{neighbouring}} Birkenhead, but only nine casualties were inflicted. Elsewhere damage was reported at Eastbourne, Worthing, Bournemouth, Cardiff, Avonmouth, Manchester, Warrington, Bootle and Preston. RAF night fighters flew 64 sorties and intercepted two bombers. Neither <b>the</b> <b>fighters</b> or ground defences claimed any successes.|$|E
5|$|Luttrell stumbles upon a {{small body}} of water and submerges himself, only to find upon {{surfacing}} that a local Pashtun villager, Mohammad Gulab, has discovered his location. Gulab takes Luttrell into his care, returning to his village, where he attempts to hide Luttrell in his home. Gulab then sends a mountain man to the nearest American air base to alert military forces to Luttrell's location. The Taliban fighters arrive at the village to capture and kill Luttrell, but Gulab and the villagers intervene, threatening to kill <b>the</b> <b>fighters</b> if they harm Luttrell. <b>The</b> <b>fighters</b> leave, but later return to punish the villagers for protecting Luttrell. Gulab and his fellow militia are able to fend off several fighters during the ensuing attack. American forces, arriving via helicopters, shatter the advancing Taliban and, in the process, kill {{the bulk of the}} insurgents with concentrated weaponry fire. The American forces evacuate Luttrell back to base.|$|E
5000|$|Corner stoppage/retirement: <b>The</b> <b>fighter</b> {{is being}} {{completely}} battered, {{to the point}} where it is too dangerous for him to continue. In some cases, <b>the</b> <b>fighter</b> may have been injured. <b>The</b> <b>fighter's</b> corner decides to surrender on <b>the</b> <b>fighter's</b> behalf to prevent unnecessary damage or potential injury. (This is also known as [...] "throwing in the towel".) If the towel is thrown in by the corner at any time during the fight then TKO would be the result, but if a fighter is pulled out at the end of a round during the minute rest period by their corner, the result is RTD.|$|R

5|$|Of the 403 sorties {{put up by}} Fighter Command to {{meet the}} major German attacks, 320 of those made contact with the enemy, meaning 80 percent of <b>the</b> <b>fighters</b> sent to {{intercept}} the bombers did so.

5|$|The {{supersonic}} F-100 left {{a legacy}} of many crashes over its years of service; nearly 25 percent were lost to accidents. In particular, 1958 was the most costly, with 47 F-100 pilots killed and 116 of <b>the</b> <b>fighters</b> destroyed, a loss rate averaging almost one every three days.|$|E
5|$|With the Arab {{government}} in Damascus destroyed and Faisal exiled, Hananu's rebels sought {{to compensate for}} the consequent loss of aid from the Arab government.

5|$|According to Fumić, {{the weaker}} and ill {{children}} were lodged with compassionate local peasants, but 350 {{of the strongest}} children were taken away by <b>the</b> <b>fighters.</b> According to Lukić, a total of 727 children were liberated from the camp, but at the first rest stop at Svetojanska, medical examinations by Davila identified about 400 weak and sick children who could no longer walk, and they were returned to Jastrebarsko. Davila estimates {{the number of children}} actually liberated from the camp at around 400.|$|E
5|$|Altogether JG 1 lost 25 {{pilots and}} 29 {{aircraft}}. This return for around 60 enemy aircraft (54 on the ground) cannot {{be considered a}} complete success, although the damage at St. Denijs Westrem and Maldegem had been significant. Just nine of <b>the</b> <b>fighters</b> lost by JG 1 are confirmed to have been shot down in combat with Spitfires. It is possible a further three were shot down by Spitfires, or perhaps ground fire. Two Spitfires were shot down and destroyed, with two more damaged. One pilot of each Squadron (308 and 317) was killed. The total Spitfire losses were perhaps 32.|$|E
5|$|Between 27 and 34 RAF {{fighters were}} destroyed. A {{specialist}} {{source of the}} battle indicated the figure to be 31 destroyed or beyond repair. Of these, 25 fell to German fighters, two to return fire from the bombers. One was shot down by British ground fire in error {{and the loss of}} the remainder cannot be established. Some 26 of <b>the</b> <b>fighters</b> lost were Hurricanes, and five were Spitfires. Personnel losses for the RAF amounted to 10 British fighter pilots killed on the day, and another who died of wounds. Around 19 pilots were wounded, 11 so seriously that they did not take part {{in the rest of the}} battle.|$|E
50|$|An out-of-plane {{maneuver}} enhances this effect, by diverting <b>the</b> <b>fighter</b> {{into a new}} {{plane of}} travel. Increasing the pitch or slice can quickly provide a change in speed, which can just as quickly be reversed by returning to the original plane of travel. Out-of-plane maneuvers are not only used to provide a reduction in turn radius, but also causes <b>the</b> <b>fighter</b> to fly a longer path {{in relation to the}} direction of travel. A maneuver such as a high Yo-Yo is used to slow closure and to bring <b>the</b> <b>fighter</b> into lag pursuit, while a low Yo-Yo is used to increase closure and to bring <b>the</b> <b>fighter</b> into lead pursuit.|$|R
