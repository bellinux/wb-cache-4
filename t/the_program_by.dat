5|$|In June 1987, as {{a private}} venture, BAe, McDonnell Douglas, and Smiths Industries signed an MoU for the {{development}} of what was to become the AV-8B Plus, which saw the addition of radar and increased missile compatibility. The agreement was endorsed by the USMC and, after much consideration, the Spanish and Italian navies developed a joint requirement for a fleet of air-defense Harriers. The United States, Spain, and Italy signed an MoU in September 1990 to define the responsibilities of the three countries and establish a Joint Program Office to manage the program. On 30 November 1990, the USN, acting as an agent for the three participating countries, awarded McDonnell Douglas the contract to develop the improved Harrier. The award was followed by an order from the USMC in December 1990 for 30 new aircraft, and 72 rebuilt from older aircraft. Italy ordered 16 Harrier II Plus and two twin-seat TAV-8B aircraft, while Spain signed a contract for eight aircraft. Production of the AV-8B Harrier II Plus was conducted, in addition to McDonnell Douglas' plant, at CASA's facility in Seville, Spain, and Alenia Aeronautica's facility in Turin, Italy. The UK also participated in <b>the</b> <b>program</b> <b>by</b> manufacturing components for the AV-8B.|$|E
5|$|Some Schubert {{performers}} tend to {{play the}} entire trilogy of the last sonatas in a single recital, thereby stressing their interrelatedness, and suggesting that they form a single, complete cycle. However, since each of these sonatas is rather long (as compared, for instance, with most of Mozart's or Beethoven's sonatas), such a program may prove exhausting to some listeners. One of the solutions to this problem is to shorten <b>the</b> <b>program</b> <b>by</b> omitting repeats, mainly those of the opening movements' expositions (however, this practice is highly disputed, as noted above). The pioneers of the Schubert sonata performance, Schnabel and Erdmann, {{are known to have}} played the entire trilogy in one evening; more recently, so did Alfred Brendel, Maurizio Pollini, Mitsuko Uchida, and Paul Lewis.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method that}} allows to create <b>programs</b> <b>by</b> following <b>the</b> <b>Programming</b> <b>by</b> Demonstration paradigm.
