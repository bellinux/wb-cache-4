The style of the building evokes Gaudí's early work, such as the Casa Vicens or the Güell Pavilions; it had an entrance gate in the shape of a fishing net, currently installed in the Park Güell. The building was demolished in 1939. Also in 1906 he designed a new banner, this time for the Guild of metalworkers and blacksmiths for the Corpus Christi procession of 1910, in Barcelona Cathedral. It was dark green in colour, with Barcelona's coat of arms in the upper left corner, and an image of Saint Eligius, patron of the guild, with typical <b>tools</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trade.</b> The banner was burned in July 1936.|$|E

25|$|One major {{purpose of}} {{bankruptcy}} {{is to ensure}} orderly and reasonable management of debt. Thus, exemptions for personal effects are thought to prevent punitive seizures of items of little or no economic value (personal effects, personal care items, ordinary clothing), since this does not promote any desirable economic result. Similarly, <b>tools</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trade</b> may, depending on the available exemptions, be a permitted exemption as their continued possession allows the insolvent debtor to move forward into productive work as soon as possible.|$|E
25|$|Improvisation {{and stock}} verses were the <b>tools</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trade</b> of shantymen.

While on one hand this may simply reflect the aesthetic of the music-culture from which the form originated, this, too, was a feature suited to practical restrictions. Work tasks might be of any length and often unpredictable. Songs with a fixed set of verses, or ballads, which tell a story, were not so well suited to tasks that could end abruptly at any time or that might require extending.|$|E

This paper {{deals with the}} tension between <b>the</b> authenticity <b>of</b> designbased learning situations that is often strived at and <b>the</b> inherent complexity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> design process and CAD as a representational <b>tool</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trade.</b> We describe a three-dimensional framework for comparing innovative project-like scenarios in technology curricula to more traditional instructional sequences for science learning. We subsequently developed a dissociated geometry-oriented and an integrated technology-oriented CAD training and studied their influence on the way pupils engaged in a design task. Although the results show evidence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> complementary roles <b>of</b> different types of representations, no effect of type of CAD training is found. In the discussion, we propose potential explanations for these findings, by relating back to our framework, and make a suggestion for future research...|$|R

25|$|Fiction {{and plays}} about pirates were {{ubiquitous}} in the 19th century. Walter Scott's The Pirate (1822) and James Fenimore Cooper's The Red Rover were key {{sources for the}} romanticised, dashing pirate image {{and the idea of}} repentant pirates. Both Gilbert and Sullivan had parodied these ideas early in their careers. Sullivan had written a comic opera called The Contrabandista, in 1867, about a hapless British tourist who is captured by bandits and forced to become their chief. Gilbert had written several comic works that involved pirates or bandits. In Gilbert's 1876 opera Princess Toto, the title character is eager to be captured by a brigand chief. Gilbert had translated Jacques Offenbach's operetta Les brigands, in 1871. As in Les brigands, The Pirates of Penzance absurdly treats stealing as a professional career path, with apprentices and <b>tools</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trade</b> such as the crowbar and life preserver.|$|E

2500|$|Bigelow, now {{tough and}} leaner in stature, with a regimental {{approved}} mustache, from his tenure {{on the frontier}} had become a teacher to Remington regarding the cavalry and the <b>tools</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trade.</b> Bigelow teased his friend about his British-style pith helmet. He gave his friend a quiver of Apache hunting arrows and its bow that he had recovered from the field. Remington made dozens of sketches that often focused on what Bigelow did and often inserted himself in his own sketches. In 1889 Remington would publish some of his sketches and tell {{of what it was}} like going on a [...] "scout" [...] with the Buffalo Soldiers. The tall lean frame and face of Bigelow can be seen in many of Remington's later paintings and artistic works. Unfortunately this caused some problems for Bigelow. Not only did some officers become jealous of the attention given to Bigelow, but many women, married and single, competed for his attention. Bigelow had many a close call toward the state of matrimony, but improved his Spanish skills. On at least two occasions his [...] "notoriety" [...] caused him delay in returning to his command because of the [...] "need" [...] for him to attend a party while in transit at some frontier posting.|$|E
