500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Sarah Chatfield, who {{wanted to do a}} Tom and Jerry-like video, where the human character is cut off at the waist. Hence Allen {{was not going to be}} part of it originally. However, she did appear on the video. The singer declared on her official blog that, I did a video shoot for the next single, which is Alfie, and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> lot of fun, Alfie was played by a puppet and the whole thing looks like an episode of a mixture Tom and Jerry and Roger Rabbit, you'll understand when you see it. The whole day was a pleasurable experience [...] The video starts off with an opening title parodying Looney Tunes and shows Allen in the kitchen preparing a cup of tea, while Alfie, impersonated by a puppet, smokes in his miniature bedroom, watching television. The singer enters the room and takes away his bong, as he unsuccessfully tries to get it back. Next, Allen irons his tuxedo and marks a job announcement called [...] "The Puppet Show" [...] in the newspaper, as the lyric [...] "You need to get a job because the bills need to get paid" [...] is sung. Meanwhile, Alfie is in his bed, staring at a magazine in which there are undressed dolls, titled [...] "Roxy & Babs get it on!" [...] and proceeds to masturbate. Allen walks in on him with the newspaper and suit as he does so, but immediately exits out of embarrassment. With the start of the bridge, puppet birds sing outside the home, while Alfie sneaks out of his room and tries to get beer out of the refrigerator, but is ultimately caught by Allen. She then takes off his [...] "stupid fitted cap", as he scrawls a picture of her, which is also the cover of [...] "Littlest Things". The final scene happens at night, in the kitchen, where Allen is lying on the floor, watching her brother dance. After the last lyrics, [...] "Please don't despair, my dear, mon frere" [...] is sung, he punches her and the video ends.|$|E

We just stuck a few more words on it like 'grandchildren on your knee' and 'Vera, Chuck and Dave' ... this was just one <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> hit with us." [...] In his 1980 {{interview}} for Playboy he said, [...] "I would never even dream of writing a song like that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Minor Threat {{broke up}} in 1983. A {{contributing}} factor was disagreement over musical direction. MacKaye was allegedly skipping practice sessions {{towards the end}} of the band's career, and he wrote the lyrics to the songs on the Salad Days EP in the studio. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> contrast with the earlier recordings, as he had written and co-written the music for much of the band's early material. Minor Threat, which had returned to being a four-piece group with the departure of Hansgen, played its final show on September 23, 1983, at the Lansburgh Cultural Center in Washington, D.C., sharing the bill with go-go band Trouble Funk, and Austin, Texas, punk funk act the Big Boys. In a meaningful way, Minor Threat ended their final set with [...] "Last Song", which was the original title of [...] "Salad Days".|$|E

"Nay, Elfie, {{you little}} wretch; <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> good rose--not fair game," [...] and leaping {{up to give}} her chase in and out among the beds, they nearly ran against Janet {{returning}} with the letters, and saying [...] "she was sorry to have been so long, but mother's hoards were never easy places of research." ...|$|E
6000|$|His {{companion}} {{showed little}} less discomposure, even turning angrily, with a bitten lip, and {{reaching for his}} saddle pommel, as if to remount his pony; but [...] "Miss Sally" [...] touched his arm and said, laughingly, [...] "Come now. Marquis; <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> compliment from Saunders. It's that distinguished air of yours and aristocratic nose that made him call you that." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, but it's not all driftwood," [...] {{broke in}} Jack. [...] "A {{good deal of}} the timber is cut up in the woods and then floated down. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>an</b> {{industry}} among some of the old settlers up there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was {{perfectly}} ridiculous of me," [...] she murmured, [...] "but I was just telling Dick--he is back again for another four days' leave {{and we were}} talking about you at luncheon time--that I wasn't feeling very well, and your coming in like <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> shock. I am absolutely all right now. Do please sit down and explain," [...] she begged, motioning him to a chair.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{agree with}} you," [...] de la Vallee said. [...] "It {{would have been}} much wiser for him to have abstained, altogether, from {{interference}} in the matter. It was, of course, a different thing when he attempted to land in Scotland. Then he would have been leading the loyal portion of his subjects, against those whom he considers rebels against his authority. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> different thing from acting, without cause or reason, as a volunteer in the French army, against those whom he regards as his countrymen and subjects.|$|E
6000|$|... "It has {{not been}} pleasant," [...] Mrs. Conway said quietly. [...] "But I {{preferred}} it to the long journey by coach up to London, and down here again. We were five days on the way, as the vessel put in at so many ports. Still <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> minor question with me. I {{wanted to see you}} and have a talk with you personally. There is no saying into whose hands letters may fall, and one talk face to face does more good than a score of letters." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! {{quite right}} then, {{but you are}} a married woman now, and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> {{different}} thing. The stall of the three brides. What an attraction! I shall come {{and talk about it}} when I make my call in full form! Good-bye again." ...|$|R
6000|$|They went in together, and he lighted the big lamp. [...] "You had supper with Mrs. Custer, but <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> while ago, {{and there}} should be a little fire yet in the cook-shed stove," [...] he said. [...] "Is there {{anything}} I can make you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly. But <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> {{distinct}} {{matter from}} his dislike {{of what he}} calls Relligio. In that dislike I can sympathise fully: but on his method of escape Mr. Windrush will probably look with more complaisance than I do, who call it by the ugly name of Atheism." ...|$|R
60|$|Under {{the impulse}} of these {{feelings}} he sought and obtained leave {{to go into}} the town. He wished to see how the new Soldiers' Institute being set up there was getting along. He had promised Miss Robinson to pay it a visit. That was his plea. He did not feel called upon to inform his officer of his intention to visit the Drews! <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> private matter--yet it was the main matter; for, on landing, instead of inquiring for the spot where the new Institute was being erected, he began a search among the various hotels where English visitors were wont to put up. The search was successful. He found the hotel, but the family had gone out, he was told, and were not expected back till evening.|$|E
60|$|The lord-lieutenant and Lady Agramont, {{and their}} daughter, Lady Ida Alice, arrived to-day; and the high-sheriff, a manufacturer, a great liberal who delighted in peers, but whose {{otherwise}} perfect felicity to-day {{was a little}} marred and lessened by the haunting and restless fear that Lothair was not duly aware that he took precedence of the lord-lieutenant. Then there were Sir Hamlet Clotworthy, {{the master of the}} hounds, and a capital man of business; and the Honorable Lady Clotworthy, a haughty dame who ruled her circle with tremendous airs and graces, but who was a little subdued in the empyrean of Muriel Towers. The other county member, Mr. Ardenne, was a refined gentleman, and loved the arts. He had an ancient pedigree, and knew everybody else's, which was not always pleasant. What he most prided himself on was being the hereditary owner of a real deer--park the only one, he asserted, in the county. Other persons had parks which had deer in them, but <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> different thing. His wife was a pretty woman, and the inspiring genius of archeological societies, who loved their annual luncheon in her Tudor Halls, and illustrated by their researches the deeds and dwellings of her husband's ancient race.|$|E
60|$|Foolish Peter Rabbit! There he was boasting and bragging {{to himself}} {{of what he}} would do to some one whom he hadn't even seen, all because he had found a sign that told him the Old Pasture, in which he had made up his mind to make his new home, was already the home of some one else. Peter was like a lot of other people; he wasn't fair. No, Sir, he wasn't fair. He let his own desires destroy his sense of fair play. It was all right for him to put up signs in the dear Old Briar-patch and the Green Forest, warning other Rabbits that they must keep away, but it was all wrong for another Rabbit {{to do the same thing}} in the Old Pasture. Oh, my, yes! <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> {{different}} matter! The very thought of it made Peter very, very angry. When he thought of this other Rabbit, it was always as the stranger. That shows just how unfair Peter was, because, you see, Peter himself was really the stranger. It was his first visit to the Old Pasture, while it was very plain that the other had lived there for some time.|$|E

6000|$|... "Is she at Brighton? Then there's one fool more in {{a fashionable}} {{watering}} place. Oh, she's in Switzerland, is she? I don't care where she is; I only care about Mr. Mirabel. We all heard he was at Brighton for his health, {{and was going to}} preach. Didn't we cram the church! As to describing him, I give it up. He is the only little man I ever admired--hair as long as mine, and the sort of beard you see in pictures. I wish I had his fair complexion and his white hands. We were all in love with him--or with his voice, which was it?--when he began to read the commandments. I wish I could imitate him {{when he came to the}} fifth commandment. He began in his deepest bass voice: 'Honor thy father--' He stopped and looked up to heaven as if he saw the rest of it there. He went on with a tremendous emphasis on the next word. 'And thy mother,' he said (as if <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> different thing) in a tearful, fluty, quivering voice which was a compliment to mothers in itself. We all felt it, mothers or not. But the great sensation was when he got into the pulpit. The manner in which he dropped on his knees, and hid his face in his hands, and showed his beautiful rings was, as a young lady said behind me, simply seraphic. We understood his celebrity, from that moment--I wonder whether I can remember the sermon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Father Brown huskily, {{and looking}} at his boots; [...] "there is only one place where they grow. They grow in the basket of the guillotine, beside which the chief of police, Aristide Valentin, was {{standing}} not {{an hour before the}} murder. Oh, my friends, hear me a minute more before you tear me in pieces. Valentin is an honest man, if being mad for an arguable cause is honesty. But did you never see in that cold, grey eye of his that he is mad! He would do anything, anything, to break what he calls the superstition of the Cross. He has fought for it and starved for it, and now he has murdered for it. Brayne's crazy millions had hitherto been scattered among so many sects that they did little to alter the balance of things. But Valentin heard a whisper that Brayne, like so many scatter-brained sceptics, was drifting to us; and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> different thing. Brayne would pour supplies into the impoverished and pugnacious Church of France; he would support six Nationalist newspapers like The Guillotine. The battle was already balanced on a point, and the fanatic took flame at the risk. He resolved to destroy the millionaire, and he did it as one would expect the greatest of detectives to commit his only crime. He abstracted the severed head of Becker on some criminological excuse, and took it home in his official box. He had that last argument with Brayne, that Lord Galloway did not hear the end of; that failing, he led him out into the sealed garden, talked about swordsmanship, used twigs and a sabre for illustration, and--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{perhaps is}} the only way in which wars of this kind will ever be brought to an end. By women insisting on killing {{the kind of people who}} make them. Rooting them out. By a {{campaign}} of pursuit and assassination that will go on for years and years after the war itself is over.... Murder is such a little gentle punishment for the crime of war.... It would be hardly more than a reproach for what has happened. Falling like snow. Death after death. Flake by flake. This prince. That statesman. The count who writes so fiercely for war.... That is what I am going to do. If Teddy is really dead.... We women were ready enough a year or so ago to starve and die for the Vote, and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> little thing in comparison with this business.... Don't you see what I mean? It's so plain and sensible, Cissie. Whenever a man sits and thinks whether he will make a war or not, then he will think too of women, women with daggers, bombs; of a vengeance that will never tire nor rest; of consecrated patient women ready to start out upon a pilgrimage that will only end with his death.... I wouldn't hurt these war makers. No. In spite of the poison gas. In spite of trench feet and the men who have been made blind and the wounded who have lain for days, dying slowly in the wet. Women ought not to hurt. But I would kill. Like killing dangerous vermin. It would go on year by year. Balkan kings, German princes, chancellors, they would have schemed for so much--and come to just a rattle in the throat.... And if presently other kings and emperors began to prance about and review armies, they too would go....|$|E
