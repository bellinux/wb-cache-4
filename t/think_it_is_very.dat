500|$|... "Caliente" [...] is a salsa song {{inspired}} by 1990s dance music. [...] Regarding its style, Inna confessed {{in an interview}} with Pure Charts, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> good to update the 90s. But we also find something new on each track, original sounds that are unique to me." [...] Italian publication RnB Junk noticed that the beat was similar to her previous work, while also writing that the track showed [...] "a sensual and Latin" [...] side of the singer. [...] "Caliente" [...] begins, translated in English, with the lines [...] "Your love is hot/Your love is hot/I want to dream with you, my love".|$|E
500|$|... "Footprints in the Sand" [...] {{was written}} by Simon Cowell, David Kreuger, Per Magnusson and Richard Page, whilst the {{production}} was helmed by Steve Mac. It was recorded in 2007 at Rokstone Studios in London, England. Cowell originally {{came up with the}} idea to base a song around the Christian poem [...] "Footprints", and suggested it to Kreuger and Magnusson. They had a scheduled session in Page's home in Malibu, California and finished the song the next day. Cowell secured a songwriting credit for coming up with the idea. In an interview with HitQuarters, Magnusson said they had thought the song would be a good idea for Irish boy band Westlife, but it was offered to British singer Leona Lewis instead. When Cowell mentioned the song concept to Lewis, she agreed that it could be [...] "really quite interesting". Regarding the song, Lewis commented: [...] "Originally it was a poem; it's very inspirational so we put it into a song. I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> moving, with a very emotional lyric and I really love to sing this song"; and added that the poem [...] " [...] about standing by someone and being there for people who need your help." ...|$|E

500|$|I'm {{influenced}} by everything. By books, by the weather, by the water, by my shoes, if they're comfortable or not. Everything. One {{of it is}} music, but I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> important {{with people who are}} dealing with making music that they are not only {{influenced by}} music. And I find it very sad when you find a record, and it says on : [...] "this record was inspired by Miles Davis." [...] Because it's like making...a film, you don't make a film about a film, you make a film about real life. And you wouldn't sit down and write a book about a book, it's like recycling, it misses the point. And music isn't brilliant unless it goes beyond the point of being music and becomes real life. So I'm influenced by real life. And when people listen to my music and say [...] "Oh, I can see great influence from this artist in there", I read that and I say [...] "Okay, I didn't succeed". But if people listen to my music and say [...] "Oh, this made me feel like this and that [...] ", that's right. It should be beyond style, beyond influence, it should be about pure emotion, and real life.|$|E

2500|$|The {{excavation}} {{report for}} the predecessor of the Israel Antiquities Authority was written by Amos Kloner, now professor of archaeology at Israel's Bar-Ilan University. Kloner dissociated himself from the claims made in the documentary. He said it was incorrect to call it [...] "never before reported information" [...] {{and that he had}} published all the details in the journal Antiqot in 1996. He had not said it was the tomb of Jesus' family. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> unserious [...] work. I do scholarly work…," [...] Kloner said.

"Well, I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> kind of her {{thinking}} of it," [...] Isobel said, [...] "and I don't <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> nice of you, Doctor, {{to say that}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> an evident relief {{to her when she}} found I had someone else to take care of me.

2500|$|Lewis {{recorded}} the album in several locations the first being London, England, {{where she worked}} with Steve Mac, who produced the songs [...] "Homeless" [...] and [...] "Footprints in the Sand". [...] "Homeless" [...] was written by Jörgen Elofsson, and was previously recorded by Swedish singer Darin. [...] "Footprints in the Sand" [...] was written by Per Magnusson, David Kreuger, Richard Page and Simon Cowell. The song is an adaptation of the Christian poem [...] "Footprints", and Lewis commented [...] "Originally it was a poem; it's very inspirational so we {{put it into a}} song. I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> moving, with a very emotional lyric and I really love to sing this song". Cowell {{came up with the idea}} to base a song around the poem, and asked Kreuger and Magnusson whether they could write something dealing with this subject. They took the idea to a songwriting session the pair already had scheduled with Page at his home in Malibu, California and they finished the song the following day. When Cowell mentioned the song concept to Lewis, she agreed that it could be [...] "really quite interesting".|$|E
2500|$|On April 25, 2008, Entertainment Tonight {{reported}} that 15-year-old Miley Cyrus had posed topless {{for a photo}} shoot with Vanity Fair.

On April 29, 2008, The New York Times clarified: though the pictures left an impression that she was bare-breasted, Cyrus was wrapped in a bedsheet and was actually not topless. Some parents expressed outrage at {{the nature of the}} photograph, which a Disney spokesperson described as [...] "a situation [...] was created to deliberately manipulate a 15-year-old in order to sell magazines". [...] In response to the Internet circulation of the photo and ensuing media attention, Cyrus released a statement of apology on April 27: I took part in a photo shoot {{that was supposed to be}} 'artistic' and now, seeing the photographs and reading the story, I feel so embarrassed. I never intended for any of this to happen and I apologize to my fans who I care so deeply about. [...] Leibovitz also released a statement saying: [...] I'm sorry that my portrait of Miley has been misinterpreted. ...
