5|$|<b>The</b> <b>frontiers</b> of the Principality of Albania had {{not been}} set during the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, as they were left for the League to decide; they {{had not yet been}} {{determined}} by September 1921, creating an unstable situation. Greek troops conducted military operations in the south of Albania. Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (Yugoslav) forces became engaged, after clashes with Albanian tribesmen, {{in the northern part of}} the country. The League sent a commission of representatives from various powers to the region. In November 1921, the League decided that <b>the</b> <b>frontiers</b> of Albania should be the same as they had been in 1913, with three minor changes that favoured Yugoslavia. Yugoslav forces withdrew a few weeks later, albeit under protest.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{conflicts}} occurred between the Empire and its neighbors.

He proved his kingdom's military strength when he repelled an invasion by Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor, in 1030. Marshlands, other natural obstacles, and barricades made of stone, earth or timber provided defense at the kingdom's borders.

40|$|Efficiency {{measurement}} naturally {{requires the}} definition of a frontier as a benchmark indicating efficiency. Usually a measure reflecting the distance of a data point to <b>the</b> <b>frontier</b> indicates <b>the</b> level of efficiency. One of the crucial characteristics to distinguish efficiency measurement tools {{is the way in which}} they construct <b>the</b> <b>frontier.</b> <b>The</b> class of deterministic and non parametric tools of constructing <b>the</b> <b>frontier</b> mainly comprises of tools associated with Data Envelopment Analysis. Coming in various flavors all DEA frontiers suffer of their piecewise construction giving rise to numerous vertices. Those vertices do not allow convenient analysis of <b>the</b> <b>frontier</b> properties such as computing elasticities and the like. In this paper we want to contribute to the class of deterministic and non parametric tools of constructing <b>the</b> <b>frontier</b> in an one output and n input setting. We suggest a new empirical approach drawing on functional search in the fashion of Koza’s (1992) genetic programming. <b>The</b> <b>frontier</b> search algorithm employed evolves the functional form of <b>the</b> <b>frontier</b> and <b>the</b> parameters simultaneously. <b>The</b> <b>frontier</b> exhibits <b>the</b> neat property that it is smooth and differentiable enabling the computation of elasticities for example. In particular we introduce both the idea and the algorithm of <b>the</b> <b>frontier</b> search procedure. We discuss the advantages and shortcomings with respect to empirical problems. The arguments brought forth in the preceding sections are illustrated by the investigation of an artificial example. ...|$|R

A network of canals connected Bruges with the coast at Ostend and Zeebrugge, through which small warships such as destroyers, light cruisers and submarines could travel and find a safe harbour from which to launch raids into the English Channel and along the coasts of southeast England. U-boats could also depart from Bruges at night, cutting a day off the journey to the Western Approaches, more easily avoiding the North Sea Mine Barrage and allowing U-boat captains to gain familiarity with the net and mine defences of the English Channel, through which they had to pass to reach the main battlegrounds of the Atlantic.|$|E
