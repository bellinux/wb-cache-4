40|$|The {{development}} of accounting practice in India {{has largely been}} influenced by the practice in the United Kingdom. No regulatory body is specifically responsible for the establishment of accounting principles. In several accounting areas, mandatory requirements for accounting practices are included in the Companies Act. The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) has during the last few years issued the following accounting standards and guidance notes. The accounting in the past was restricted to the record keeping but today it covers a wide range of activities involving business planning and control, decision making, problem solving, performance measurement and evaluation, co-coordinating and directing auditing and tax determination and cost planning and management, etc. But the accounting in wholesale and retail business is restricted to cash book, ledger, trial balance, <b>trading</b> <b>account,</b> profit and <b>loss</b> <b>account</b> and balance sheet and submitting these to tax authorities and banks at the end of financial year for verification and tax purpose and for continuation of banking facilities...|$|R

40|$|Doctor of Philosophy(PhD) In {{this thesis}} we are {{concerned}} with valuing options on <b>traded</b> <b>accounts</b> using both continuous and discrete time models. An option on a <b>traded</b> <b>account</b> is a zero strike call on the balance of a <b>trading</b> <b>account</b> which consists of a position of size θ in a risky asset (which we refer to as a stock) and the remaining wealth in a risk-free account. The choice of trading positions throughout {{the life of the}} option are made by the buyer, subject to constraints specified in the contract at the time of purchase. The specification of these trading constraints gives rise to some of the more well known examples including passport options and vacation options. At maturity, the option buyer is entitled to any positive wealth accumulated in the <b>trading</b> <b>account</b> whilst any <b>losses</b> are covered by the option seller. First, we examine the problem of valuing these options in continuous time. A review of some existing methods is presented, including a complete derivation of the pricing formula for the passport option and the option on a <b>traded</b> <b>account</b> following the methods proposed by Hyer et al. (1997) and Shreve and Vecer (2000), though we often use different techniques to those authors. We also present an alternative derivation for the value of a passport option using our own methodology which we believe is simpler than those currently available. Secondly, we consider the valuation problem in a discrete time setting by looking at one specific discrete time model, the binomial tree. This is a new contribution to the literature as binomial models for these options have not been previously examined. Using this approach, the greatest difficulty is the determination of an optimal trading strategy which is required to price this class of option. We show that in general, binomial models and continuous time models {{do not have the same}} trading strategy, and in fact that the analytic determination of the trading strategy for an option on a <b>traded</b> <b>account</b> may in fact be impossible to obtain. We then turn to passport options, where we are able to derive an analytic optimal strategy which in this case is identical to that used in the continuous time models, thus the problem of valuing passport options is reduced to the same computational burdens as a binomial valuation without recombining branches. Lastly, we examine some numerical methods which could be used to value options on <b>traded</b> <b>accounts</b> with binomial models. Our problem is shown to be an NP-hard convex maximisation which we convert into both an l 1 -norm convex maximisation and an indefinite quadratic program. Whilst we present algorithms which are guaranteed to obtain the optimal solution, they are also known to be inefficient and thus inappropriate for any likely application beyond a few time steps. We conclude by summarising our results and give directions for future research in this area...|$|R

40|$|In {{the debate}} about United States {{subsidies}} of private sector R&D, it is sometimes argued {{that the state of}} our technology is closely related to our current account deficits, particularly in what has been called the Advanced Technology Products (ATP) <b>trade</b> <b>account.</b> The corollary is that taking appropriate actions to increase research and development activities will both improve our technology and reduce the size of the ATP <b>trade</b> <b>account</b> deficit. The paper exams this proposition in a two-country two-firm intra-industry trade model, where firms play a two-stage quality-quantity game. The primary result of the paper is that if, as compared to its trading partners, the United States has about the same demand function but higher production costs then increases in R&D are likely to reduce an ATP <b>trade</b> <b>account</b> deficit. If, on the other hand, both costs and the value customers place on the product are high in the United States as compared to its trading partners, then increases in R&D are likely to increase the size of the ATP <b>trade</b> <b>account</b> deficit. ...|$|R

40|$|Magistrska naloga temelji na obratnem kapitalu, kateremu bi vsa podjetja morala posvečati posebno pozornost. Dobro upravljanje z obratnim kapitalom pomeni premišljeno odločanje o obsegu zalog, terjatvah do kupcev in dolgovih. V nalogi se prepletata teoretični in empirični del. V empiričnem delu smo prikazali podatke za Skupino Gorenje, ki je eden izmed vodilnih evropskih izdelovalcev aparatov za dom. Na začetku naloge smo opredelili osnovne pojme, ki so povezani z obratnim kapitalom, v naslednjem poglavju smo opisali komponente obratnega kapitala, na koncu pa opredelili še politiko obratnega kapitala. Komponente obratnega kapitala so zaloge, terjatve do kupcev, denar in obveznosti do dobaviteljev, katerim smo v nalogi namenili največ pozornosti. Prikazali smo gibanje zalog, terjatev do kupcev in obveznosti do dobaviteljev za Skupino Gorenje, in sicer smo izračunali povprečne vrednosti le-teh, dneve vezav ter koeficiente obračanja. Ker mora podjetje obratna sredstva tudi financirati, smo poskušali preko krogotoka obratnega kapitala ugotoviti, kako hitrost obračanja obratnih sredstev vpliva na financiranje obratnega kapitala. Prišli smo do ugotovitve, da se s hitrejšim obračanjem obratnih sredstev znižujejo potrebe po virih financiranja. Za podjetje je dobro, da ima čim krajši cikel vezav zalog in terjatev do kupcev ter čim krajše dneve vezav obveznosti. Idealno bi bilo, če bi lahko podjetje zaloge in terjatve do kupcev financiralo z obveznostmi do dobaviteljev, vendar morajo podjetja v praksi običajno uporabljati še druge vire financiranja. V zadnjem poglavju smo se osredotočili na politiko obratnega kapitala, ki govori o višini obratnega kapitala v podjetju ter virih njihovega financiranja. Z ustrezno oblikovano politiko obratnega kapitala podjetje zniža potrebni obseg financiranja in poveča donosnost kapitala. The {{following}} master 2 ̆ 7 s dissertation {{is based}} on the working capital which companies should pay more attention to. Good working capital management means a well-informed decision-making when it comes to inventories, <b>trade</b> <b>accounts</b> receivables and debts. In the dissertation theoretical and empirical parts are intertwined with each other. The empirical part includes the data for Gorenje Group, one of the leading European manufacturers of household appliances. At the beginning of the dissertation there are definitions of basic concepts connected with the working capital, whereas the next chapter deals with the components of the working capital, finally followed by the working capital policy. Components of the working capital are inventories, <b>trade</b> <b>accounts</b> receivables, cash and <b>trade</b> <b>accounts</b> payables on which we have concentrated the most. The movements of inventories, <b>trade</b> <b>accounts</b> receivables and <b>trade</b> <b>accounts</b> payables have been shown for Gorenje Group and furthermore, the average values of these, the turnover ratio in days and the turnover ratio have been calculated. Since the company needs to finance the working capital, we have tried to determine how the rate of turning affects the working capital financing by means of the working capital conversion cycle. We {{have come to the conclusion}} that the high turnover of the working capital reduces the need for financing the resources. It is better for the company to have shorter days of inventories turnover, <b>trade</b> <b>accounts</b> receivables and <b>trade</b> <b>accounts</b> payables turnover. The perfect situation would be if the company could finance its inventories and <b>trade</b> <b>accounts</b> receivables with the <b>trade</b> <b>accounts</b> payables. However, in reality companies need to search for other resources of financing. In the last chapter we are focused on the working capital policy, which talks about the amount of the working capital in the company and resources for their financing. With appropriately formed working capital policy the company reduces the necessary range of financing and increases the return of capital...|$|R
