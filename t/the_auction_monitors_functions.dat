As a part of its <b>monitoring</b> <b>functions,</b> GNCC maintains and processes data on the operations of license holders. The GNCC monitors the compliance of the license holders with Georgia’s laws “On Broadcasting”, “on Copyright”, “on Protection of Minors From Harmful Influence”, “on Advertising” and “On State Secret”.The GNCC is tasked with the definition and allocation of Georgia’s national radio frequency spectrum, certification of electronic communications and broadcasting facilities, standardization, provision of metrological services, etc. The GNCC controls and restricts unauthorized and unlicensed access and use of the radio frequencies and means of electronic communications in Georgia. In the event of unauthorized use of frequencies or communication facilities, the GNCC is responsible for the application and enforcement of penalties envisaged by the laws of Georgia.|$|R

40|$|M. Sc. This {{dissertation}} investigates how auctioneer agents can maximise {{the revenue}} of an auction. Auctions are an effective solution to agent negotiation {{because of their}} simplicity. They are therefore {{the most widely used}} approach to agent negotiation. A review of auction theory proves that auction revenue is influenced by factors such as <b>the</b> <b>auction</b> format and <b>the</b> <b>auction</b> parameters. <b>The</b> optimal <b>auction</b> format and parameters are dependent on the bidders and <b>the</b> <b>auction</b> environment. A study of internet <b>auctions</b> confirms <b>the</b> findings of <b>auction</b> theory regarding <b>the</b> importance of the format as well as the parameters in an auction. There has been significant research on the strategies bidding agents can adopt in order to maximise their utility. There is little research, however, on the strategies auctioneer agents can adopt to maximise auction revenue. In this study, a survey is done of the related auctioneer agents in research that maximise <b>auction</b> revenue. <b>The</b> shortcomings of these are identified. The aim of this research is to develop an adaptive auctioneer agent that can maximise the revenue of an <b>auction.</b> <b>The</b> proposed solution is the revenue maximising adaptive auctioneer (RMAA) agent. The RMAA agent consists of three components: <b>the</b> <b>auction</b> manager, <b>the</b> <b>auction</b> format selector (AFS) and <b>the</b> <b>auction</b> parameter selector (APS). The AFS employs a customised zeroth-level classifier system to select <b>the</b> <b>auction</b> format based on <b>the</b> <b>auction</b> environment. <b>The</b> APS employs reinforcement learning combined with a local hill climbing algorithm to learn what the most profitable values are for auction parameters, such as the reserve price and the bid increment. <b>The</b> <b>auction</b> manager automates <b>the</b> <b>auction</b> and coordinates <b>the</b> AFS and APS. It implements <b>the</b> four traditional <b>auction</b> formats, namely <b>the</b> English <b>auction,</b> <b>the</b> Dutch <b>auction,</b> <b>the</b> Vickrey <b>auction</b> and <b>the</b> first-price sealed-bid <b>auction.</b> Experiments conducted {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the RMAA agent prove that this agent can consistently generate more revenue than a non-adaptive auctioneer agent. The contribution of this research is an auctioneer agent that adapts both <b>the</b> <b>auction</b> format and <b>the</b> <b>auction</b> parameters according to the environment in order to maximise <b>the</b> <b>auction</b> revenue...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the price {{dynamics}} of on-line art auctions of modern Indian art using functional data analysis. The purpose here {{is not just to}} understand what determines the final prices of art objects, but also the price movement during <b>the</b> entire <b>auction.</b> We identify several factors, such as artist characteristics (established or emerging artist; prior sales history), art characteristics (size; painting medium [...] canvas or paper), competition characteristics (current number of bidders; current number of bids) and auction design characteristics (opening bid; position of the lot in <b>the</b> <b>auction),</b> that explain <b>the</b> dynamics of price movement in an on-line art auction. We find that the effects on price vary over the duration of <b>the</b> <b>auction,</b> with some of these effects being stronger at the beginning of <b>the</b> <b>auction</b> (such as <b>the</b> opening bid and historical prices realized). In some cases, the rate of change in prices (velocity) increases at the end of <b>the</b> <b>auction</b> (for canvas paintings and paintings by established artists). Our analysis suggests that the opening bid is positively related to on-line auction price levels of art at the beginning of <b>the</b> <b>auction,</b> but its effect declines toward the end of <b>the</b> <b>auction.</b> <b>The</b> order in which the lots appear in an art auction is negatively related to the current price level, with this relationship decreasing toward the end of <b>the</b> <b>auction.</b> This implies that lots that appear earlier have higher current prices during the early part of <b>the</b> <b>auction,</b> but that effect diminishes by the end of <b>the</b> <b>auction.</b> Established artists show a positive relationship with the price level at the beginning of <b>the</b> <b>auction.</b> Reputation or popularity of the artists and their investment potential as assessed by previous history of sales are positively related to the price levels at the beginning of <b>the</b> <b>auction.</b> <b>The</b> medium (canvas or paper) of the painting does not show any relationship with art auction price levels, but the size of the painting is negatively related to the current price during the early part of <b>the</b> <b>auction.</b> Important implications for auction design are drawn from the analysis.
