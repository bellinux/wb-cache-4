5|$|Shooting for <b>The</b> <b>Curse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Black Pearl {{began on}} October 9, 2002 and wrapped by March 7, 2003. Before its release, many {{executives}} and journalists had expected {{the film to}} flop, as the pirate genre had not been successful for years, the film {{was based on a}} theme-park ride, and Depp rarely made a big film. However, <b>The</b> <b>Curse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Black Pearl became both a critical and commercial success.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> {{classification}} <b>of</b> text {{as belonging}} to the triple tradition (or for that matter, double tradition) is not always definitive, depending rather on <b>the</b> degree <b>of</b> similarity demanded. For example, Matthew and Mark report <b>the</b> <b>cursing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fig tree, clearly a single incident, despite some substantial differences of wording and content. Searching Luke, however, we find only <b>the</b> parable <b>of</b> <b>the</b> barren fig tree, in a different point <b>of</b> <b>the</b> narrative. Some would say that Luke has extensively adapted an element <b>of</b> <b>the</b> triple tradition, while others would regard it as a distinct pericope.|$|R

To prevent future incidents, the Osaka city council ordered the {{construction}} of a new Ebisubashi bridge beginning in 2004, which will make it more difficult for fans to take the celebratory leap should <b>the</b> <b>Curse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Colonel be broken and the Tigers win again.|$|E

The Tigers won the Central League {{to qualify for the}} Japan Series, and many newspapers speculated that <b>the</b> <b>Curse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Colonel had finally been broken.

5|$|Jim Carrey was {{considered}} for the part of Jack Sparrow. However, the production schedule for <b>The</b> <b>Curse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Black Pearl conflicted with Bruce Almighty. Others {{considered for the}} role include Michael Keaton and Christopher Walken. Although Cook had been a strong proponent of adapting Disney's rides into films, the box office failure of The Country Bears (2002) made Michael Eisner attempt to shut down production of Pirates of the Caribbean. However, Verbinski told his concept artists to keep working on the picture, and when Eisner came to visit, the executive was astonished by what had been created.|$|E
5|$|Pirates of the Caribbean was {{the first}} film {{released}} under the Walt Disney Pictures banner to be rated PG-13 by the MPAA; one executive noted that she found the film too intense for her five-year-old child. Nonetheless, the studio was confident enough to add <b>The</b> <b>Curse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Black Pearl subtitle to the film in case sequels were made, and to attract older children. Verbinski disliked the new title {{because it is the}} Aztec gold rather than the ship that is cursed, so he requested the title to be unreadable on the poster.|$|E
