5|$|The {{outer wall}} was 2m thick at its base, and {{featured}} arched chambers {{on the level}} of the peribolos, crowned with a battlemented walkway, reaching a height of 8.5–9m. Access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>wall</b> from the city was provided either through the main gates or through small posterns on the base of the inner wall's towers. The outer wall likewise had towers, situated approximately midway between the inner wall's towers, and acting in supporting role to them. They are spaced at 48–78m, with an average distance of 50–66m. Only 62 of the outer wall's towers survive. With few exceptions, they are square or crescent-shaped, 12–14m tall and 4m wide. They featured a room with windows {{on the level of}} the peribolos, crowned by a battlemented terrace, while their lower portions were either solid or featured small posterns, which allowed access to the outer terrace. The outer wall was a formidable defensive edifice in its own right: in the sieges of 1422 and 1453, the Byzantines and their allies, being too few to hold both lines of wall, concentrated on the defence of the outer wall.|$|E
25|$|Timur himself, at {{the head}} of his central army, arrived before Smyrna on 2 December 1402 (6 Jumada al-Awwal 805). He then ordered the left army under his {{grandson}} Muhammad Sultan Mirza and the right army under his son Miran Shah to join him. The central army began to bombard the fortifications across the isthmus with stone-throwers immediately, and set to work on undermining the walls. At some point, the ditch was infilled. Large covered platforms with huge wooden wheels were rolled up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>wall.</b> Each could house 200 men. Equipped with ladders, they attempted, apparently without success, to scale the wall. The total besieging force numbered about 4,000 men.|$|E
25|$|Female fig wasps arrive {{carrying}} pollen {{from their}} natal tree and squeeze {{their way through}} the ostiole into the interior of the syconium. The syncomium bears 500–600 female flowers arranged in multiple layers - those that are closer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>wall</b> of the fig have short pedicels and long styles, while those that are located closer to the interior of the chamber have long pedicels and short styles. Female wasps generally lay their eggs in the short-styled flowers, while longer-styled flowers {{were more likely to be}} pollinated. The eggs hatch and the larvae parasitise the flowers in which they were laid. Pollinated flowers which have not been parasitised give rise to seeds.|$|E

25|$|Whitcomb's thesis was {{confirmed}} following {{research conducted by}} Taufik De'adle of the Hebrew University and excavations undertaken by Israeli archaeologists headed by Raphael Greenberg from Tel Aviv University's Institute of Archaeology in 2010. Coins found at the site and its foundations indicate that the central building was built no earlier than 650 CE and that the bathhouse attached <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>wall</b> dates {{to the end of}} the 7th century. The foundations of the compound are made up of thick wall-stubs over two meters deep and provide an idea of the layout of the palace, the bathhouse and the wall and towers that surrounded them. The remains of water conduits and ceramic pipes from the bathhouse attest to the existence of a sophisticated water-distribution system, fed by an aqueduct.|$|E
500|$|Fullerenes are a {{synthetic}} crystalline formation with a graphite-like structure, but {{in place of}} hexagons, fullerenes are formed of pentagons (or even heptagons) of carbon atoms. The missing (or additional) atoms warp the sheets into spheres, ellipses, or cylinders. The properties of fullerenes (split into buckyballs, buckytubes, and nanobuds) {{have not yet been}} fully analyzed and represent an intense area of research in nanomaterials. The names [...] "fullerene" [...] and [...] "buckyball" [...] are given after Richard Buckminster Fuller, popularizer of geodesic domes, which resemble the structure of fullerenes. The buckyballs are fairly large molecules formed completely of carbon bonded trigonally, forming spheroids (the best-known and simplest is the soccerball-shaped C buckminsterfullerene). Carbon nanotubes are structurally similar to buckyballs, except that each atom is bonded trigonally in a curved sheet that forms a hollow cylinder. Nanobuds were first reported in 2007 and are hybrid bucky tube/buckyball materials (buckyballs are covalently bonded <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>wall</b> of a nanotube) that combine the properties of both in a single structure.|$|E
500|$|Architectural {{articulation}} [...] {{refers to}} the ornamental components that give shape <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>wall</b> of the shrine. These include projections, recesses, and representations that can produce a variety of patterns and outlines, either stepped, stellate (star-shaped), or square. If stepped (also called [...] "stepped diamond of projecting corners"), these components form five or seven projections {{on each side of}} the shrine, where all but the central one are projecting corners (projections with two full faces created by two recesses, left and right, that are at right angles with each other). If square (also called [...] "square with simple projections"), these components form three or five projections on a side, only two of which are projecting corners. Stellate patterns form star points which are normally 8-, 16-, or 32-pointed and are sub-divided into interrupted and uninterrupted stellate components. In an 'interrupted' stellate plan, the stellate outline is interrupted by orthogonal (right-angle) projections in the cardinal directions, resulting in star points that have been skipped. Two basic kinds of architectural articulation are found in Indian architecture: the southern Indian dravida and the northern Indian nagara.|$|E

At one point, the rebels were pushed back from the centre of the complex <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>wall.</b> Fighting was also reported from the Rixos Al Nasr hotel area. Reporters from inside the hotel reported that Gaddafi loyalists prevented them from leaving the compound, effectively taking them hostage amid gunfire from snipers and dwindling food supplies Fighting was also continuing in the Abu Salim district, which the rebels claimed to have captured the previous day, and later it was reported that loyalists were still in control of the area, as well as the al-Hadhba district.|$|E

2500|$|There are two {{distinctive}} [...] "other ribbed vaults" [...] (called [...] "Karbandi" [...] in Persian) in India {{which form}} {{no part of}} the development of European vaults, but are too remarkable to be passed over; one carries the central dome of the Jumma Musjid at Bijapur (A.D. 1559), and the other is Gol Gumbaz, the tomb of Muhammad Adil Shah II (A.D. 1626-1660) in the same town. The vault of the latter was constructed over a hall [...] square, to carry a hemispherical dome. The ribs, instead of being carried across the angles only, thus giving an octagonal base for the dome, are carried across to the further pier of the octagon and consequently intersect one another, reducing the central opening to [...] in diameter, and, by the weight of the masonry they carry, serving as counterpoise to the thrust of the dome, which is set back so as to leave a passage about [...] wide round the interior.

2500|$|In the colon, a field defect {{probably}} arises {{by natural}} selection of a mutant or epigenetically altered cell among the stem cells {{at the base of}} one of the intestinal crypts on the inside surface of the colon. A mutant or epigenetically altered stem cell may replace the other nearby stem cells {{by natural selection}}. This may cause a patch of abnormal tissue to arise. [...] The figure in this section includes a photo of a freshly resected and lengthwise-opened segment of the colon showing a colon cancer and four polyps. [...] Below the photo there is a schematic diagram of how a large patch of mutant or epigenetically altered cells may have formed, shown by the large area in yellow in the diagram. [...] Within this first large patch in the diagram (a large clone of cells), a second such mutation or epigenetic alteration may occur so that a given stem cell acquires an advantage compared to other stem cells within the patch, and this altered stem cell may expand clonally forming a secondary patch, or sub-clone, within the original patch. This is indicated in the diagram by four smaller patches of different colors within the large yellow original area. Within these new patches (sub-clones), the process may be repeated multiple times, indicated by the still smaller patches within the four secondary patches (with still different colors in the diagram) which clonally expand, until stem cells arise that generate either small polyps or else a malignant neoplasm (cancer). In the photo, an apparent field defect in this segment of a colon has generated four polyps (labeled with the size of the polyps, 6mm, 5mm, and two of 3mm, and a cancer about 3cm across in its longest dimension). These neoplasms are also indicated (in the diagram below the photo) by 4 small tan circles (polyps) and a larger red area (cancer).
