5|$|Each {{battery-powered}} vehicle, or AGV, {{is made up}} of two platforms. Riders sit on {{the upper}} platform, which provides three degrees of freedom. A lower platform provides omnidirectional lateral movement. Unlike previous ride designs, the <b>trackless</b> <b>system</b> and the wheel and motor configurations allow movements diagonal to a rider's perspective. The vehicles use a dead reckoning system developed by Frog AGV to navigate their way through the environment, allowing a vehicle to cross another's path. Each vehicle features a built-in controller, which wirelessly communicates with a central ride-system controller. Movement commands are issued by the ride-system controller, and executed by the vehicles' controllers. A specially-designed battery and charge system allow the vehicles to be quickly charged while docked at the loading and unloading platforms.|$|E

50|$|The {{attraction}} {{was developed}} by two New Zealand-based firms who have previously worked for Walt Disney Imagineering prototyping autonomous vehicles. Arvus Group oversaw the project and subcontracted the manufacturing of the <b>trackless</b> ride <b>system</b> to Simtech, a now-defunct manufacturer. The <b>trackless</b> ride <b>system</b> relies upon a wire buried in the floor and allows the cars to rotate on the spot, something many track-based dark rides cannot do. The five vehicles are recharged at the station through an inductive charging system.|$|R

50|$|The {{attraction}} utilises a <b>trackless</b> ride <b>system</b> {{similar to}} that used in Pooh's Hunny Hunt. It features a musical score by Danny Elfman. Continuing the Society of Explorers and Adventurers theme of Tokyo DisneySea, Mystic Manor tells the story of Lord Henry Mystic and his monkey Albert. Having recently acquired an enchanted music box, Albert opens the box and brings everything inside the house to life.|$|R
50|$|In 2002, Six Flags {{installed}} the ride at Six Flags Fiesta Texas and Six Flags St. Louis, {{with the latter}} using an existing water ride system.

ETF Ride <b>Systems</b> manufactured the <b>trackless</b> ride <b>system</b> used on the Parque Warner Madrid installation.|$|R
50|$|The system {{consisted}} of the trolleybus (<b>trackless</b> trolley) <b>system</b> as well as regular (diesel) transit buses. The former was phased out in 1963, allowing the city to remove its overhead wires. Its drivers and mechanics were part of Amalgamated Street Car Union Local 732. One of the company's promotional drives was called Orchids for Operators, in which customers could nominate a helpful or courteous employee for that honor.|$|R
5000|$|Tokyo Disneyland has two {{original}} attractions {{among the}} usual dark rides: Cinderella's Fairy Tale Hall, which features {{the story of}} Cinderella in a walk-through style attraction, and Pooh's Hunny Hunt, which uses a <b>trackless</b> ride <b>system.</b> It is also the only version of Fantasyland to still feature the original version of Dumbo the Flying Elephant with only ten flying elephants, while the other versions of the attraction have sixteen elephants.|$|R
50|$|Aquatopia is an {{attraction}} at Tokyo DisneySea theme {{park at the}} Tokyo Disney Resort in Chiba, Japan. Located in the Port Discovery area of the park, {{it is the second}} of only four attractions in the world to use a <b>trackless</b> ride <b>system</b> designed by Walt Disney Imagineering (the first being Pooh's Hunny Hunt at neighboring park Tokyo Disneyland, the third being Mystic Manor at Hong Kong Disneyland, and the fourth being Luigi's Rollickin' Roadsters at Disney California Adventure).|$|R
5000|$|Luigi's Rollickin' Roadsters (renamed Luigi's Honkin' Haul-O-Ween during Halloween) - Guests queue in Luigi's Casa Della Tires {{shop and}} ride in {{vehicles}} that move and spin around to Italian music. The attraction uses a <b>trackless</b> ride <b>system,</b> similar to Aquatopia at Tokyo DisneySea. The ride vehicles are depicted as being Luigi's cousins {{who have come}} to Radiator Springs for a dance celebration. The attraction, which officially opened March 7, 2016, replaced Luigi's Flying Tires, the original attraction in this location.|$|R
50|$|In 1948 {{the tracks}} were removed and the tunnel was paved {{for use by}} buses and {{trackless}} trolleys. The <b>trackless</b> trolley <b>system</b> in Providence was dismantled in the mid-1950s. The tunnel remains in use today, reserved exclusively for buses—currently the RIPTA routes 35, 40, 42, 49, and 78, and the 92 East. Police and Fire Department vehicles also {{make use of the}} tunnel. In addition to providing a gentler grade than the surrounding city streets, the tunnel allows the public-transit vehicles to avoid vehicular traffic and stoplights.|$|R
50|$|Pooh's Hunny Hunt utilises a <b>trackless</b> ride <b>system</b> {{developed}} by Walt Disney Imagineering. Although other <b>trackless</b> ride <b>systems</b> do {{exist on the}} market (such as ETF's Mystic Mover), Pooh's Hunny Hunt differs in that it utilises an array of sensors {{as opposed to a}} dedicated wire embedded in the floor. A custom local positioning system (LPS; {{not to be confused with}} GPS) is used to manage these sensors. The patented control system works by directional data being relayed from a master control computer directly to the vehicles which are fashioned to resemble honey pots. This data is then used to move an individual honey pot car through a complicated matrix embedded within the actual floor tiles. Every few seconds, the master computer generates a random path and ‘steers’ the honey pot in real-time, so as the cars roll through the ride the vehicles are, in fact, being told where to go. Because this system is in real-time, they can maneuver accordingly in just fractions of a second. This also allows for spontaneous yet synchronized ‘honey pot choreography’ with groups of honey pots (as many as 8 in a single show scene) appearing to ‘dance’ with the others, often timed with ‘beats’ in the music. Due to limitless variations possible, each journey through the attraction is unique. Overall, Pooh's Hunny Hunt is reported to have had a budget of $130 million.|$|R
5000|$|The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh {{is a dark}} ride {{based upon}} the film of the same name, itself based on the Winnie-the-Pooh books by A. A. Milne. The {{attraction}} exists in slightly different forms at the Magic Kingdom in the Walt Disney World Resort, Disneyland, Hong Kong Disneyland, and Shanghai Disneyland Park. Pooh's Hunny Hunt, located in Tokyo Disneyland, is an entirely different [...] "E-ticket class" [...] attraction, featuring full audio animatronics and a <b>trackless</b> ride <b>system.</b> Because of legal and licensing issues, it was decided {{not to use the}} character of Christopher Robin either visually or to have his voice.|$|R
50|$|In 1952 {{the track}} {{underwent}} changes, the circumference was shortened to 435 metres and the Inside MacWhirter <b>Trackless</b> hare <b>system</b> {{was replaced by}} an Outside McKee Scott. Three of the most well-known owners the all ran their greyhounds at Wembley; the trio of George Flintham, Noel Purvis and Norman Dupont purchased and owned many of the sports leading greyhounds. In 1953, which was the year Elvin died, 30,000 people watched {{the final of the}} St Leger with Magourna Reject and the race was screened on television. John Jolliffe had taken over as Racing Manager in the late 1940s and he recruited Jack Tetlow as his deputy.|$|R
5000|$|The Philadelphia {{trolleybus}} <b>system,</b> or <b>trackless</b> trolley <b>system</b> as it {{is known}} by its operator, forms part of the public transportation network serving Philadelphia, in the state of Pennsylvania, United States. It opened on October 14, 1923, and is now the second-longest-lived trolleybus system in the world. One of only five such systems currently operating in the U.S., it presently comprises three lines, and is operated by the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA), with a fleet of 38 trolleybuses (or [...] "trolley buses" [...] or [...] "trackless trolleys", other common American English terms). The three surviving routes serve North and Northeast Philadelphia and connect with SEPTA's Market-Frankford rapid transit line.|$|R
50|$|The Boston-area {{trolleybus}} (or, as known locally, <b>trackless</b> trolley) <b>system</b> forms part of {{the public}} transportation network serving Greater Boston in the U.S. state of Massachusetts. It opened on April 11, 1936, and since 1964 has been operated by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA). It currently includes two physically isolated networks: one serving the towns of Cambridge, Belmont, and Watertown, the otherthe Silver Line (Waterfront)located in the city of Boston proper. Prior to 1964, several additional trolleybus lines were in operation in Boston proper. Measured by fleet size, the system was the third-largest trolleybus system in the United States at its peak (end of 1952), with only the Chicago and Atlanta systems having more trolleybuses than Boston's 463.|$|R
50|$|One of the company's first {{projects}} was {{to create}} a dark ride system for Sally Corporation's Labyrinth of the Minotaur ride. It opened in 2000 at the Terra Mítica amusement park in Spain. The ride system consisted of several vehicles featuring laser blasters moving along a set track. Although this tracked dark ride system was used on other rides, the company has also developed a <b>trackless</b> dark ride <b>system</b> to expand on their offerings.|$|R

5000|$|Mystic Point (...) is {{a section}} of Hong Kong Disneyland that officially {{opened to the public}} on 17 May 2013. Prior to that it had a soft opening for a {{selected}} audience. It is set in a dense, uncharted rain forest surrounded by mysterious forces and supernatural events. The site features Mystic Manor, a Haunted Mansion style attraction with the same <b>trackless</b> ride <b>system</b> developed at Pooh's Hunny Hunt in Tokyo Disneyland. Mystic Point, along with Grizzly Gulch and Toy Story Land has been exclusive to Hong Kong Disneyland among all Disney theme parks for 5 years from opening. Composer Danny Elfman scored the music for the Mystic Manor dark ride attraction. It is the final land to open in Hong Kong Disneyland's three land expansion plan approved in July 2009.|$|R

50|$|PTC was {{established}} on January 1, 1940, by {{the merger of}} the PRT and several smaller, then-independent transit companies operating in and near the city. It operated a citywide system of bus, trolley, and trackless trolley routes, the Market-Frankford Line (subway-elevated rail), the Broad Street Line (subway), and the Delaware River Bridge Line (subway-elevated rail to City Hall, Camden, New Jersey, and {{now part of the}} PATCO Speedline) which became SEPTA's City Transit Division. PTC operated the rapid transit lines in urban Philadelphia - principally the Market-Frankford Line and Broad Street Line - leasing their fixed infrastructure from the City of Philadelphia. Most suburban transit lines were operated by other private companies, such as the Philadelphia Suburban Transportation Company, rather than by PTC. PTC's network also included the Philadelphia trolleybus (<b>trackless</b> trolley) <b>system,</b> which was much smaller, along with numerous bus lines.|$|R

40|$|Automation {{in various}} forms {{constitutes}} the backbone of most major industries. An increase in production volume, product variety and manufacturing process complexity necessitates automation to ensure consistency and profitable production. Automated material handling becomes a crucial aspect of factory automation because it frees up manual labor, streamlines the flow of material, allows for complexity management, reduces work in progress (WIP) and improves the utilization of expensive equipment. Existing material handling solutions typically cater to specific industries and can also be exorbitantly expensive. There is an emerging need for affordable automated material handling in smaller industries, and in hitherto unconventional settings like homes, offices and hospitals. The keys for an automation technology that can meet the widespread demands of such varied customers are simplicity, flexibility and integrability. With this in mind, we present a very simple yet versatile material transportation concept. We propose an overhead ceiling-based <b>trackless</b> transportation <b>system</b> that uses vehicles with magnetic wheels. The concept is developed following the principles of deterministic mechatronic design. Due to its inherent simplicity and judging from its extremely wid...|$|R
5000|$|Smaller <b>trackless</b> trolley <b>systems</b> {{were built}} in the US early as well. The first non-experimental system was a {{seasonal}} municipal line installed near Nantasket Beach in 1904; the first year-round commercial line was built to open a hilly property to development just outside Los Angeles in 1910. The trackless trolley was often seen as an interim step, leading to streetcars. In the U.S.A., some systems subscribed to the all-four concept of using buses, trolleybuses, streetcars (trams, trolleys) and rapid transit subway and/or elevated lines (metros), as appropriate, for routes ranging from the lightly used to the heaviest trunk line. Buses and trolleybuses in particular were seen as entry systems that could later be upgraded to rail as appropriate. In a similar fashion, many cities in Britain originally viewed trolleybus routes as extensions to tram (streetcar) routes where the cost of constructing or restoring track could not be justified at the time, though this attitude changed markedly (to viewing them as outright replacements for tram routes) in the years after 1918. Trackless trolleys were the dominant form of new post-war electric traction, with extensive systems in among others, Los Angeles, Chicago, Rhode Island, and Atlanta; Boston, San Francisco (California), and Philadelphia (Pennsylvania) still maintain an [...] "all-four" [...] fleet.Some trolleybus lines in the United States (and in Britain, as noted above) came into existence when a trolley or tram route did not have sufficient ridership to warrant track maintenance or reconstruction. In a similar manner, a proposed tram scheme in Leeds, United Kingdom, was changed to a trolleybus scheme to cut costs.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to explore {{the current state of}} {{automated}} guided vehicles (AGVs), sensors available for the vehicles to be equipped with, control systems for the vehicles to run on, and wireless technology to connect the whole system together. With a technological push towards increasing automation and maximizing the possible throughput of systems, automated technology needs to improve for <b>trackless</b> and wireless <b>systems</b> such as vehicles {{that can be used to}} move loads in a vast array of applications. The goal of this research is to develop and propose improvements in both vehicle and control system design that allows for improved safety and efficiency. Right now the main issues are maneuverability of vehicles and control systems being adaptive enough to deal with connection issues between systems. While prolonged connection issues will result in a stoppage of operation of any system that relies on wireless communication, intermittent issues can also cause systems to have an emergency stop. I have looked into ways to offload tasks from the central system and allow the vehicles themselves to have more computational privileges such that they can operate in a semi-independent manner. The result is a proposed system that remedies or limits negative effects that currently cause issues with trackless vehicles and control systems working with remote systems that communicate via wireless means...|$|R
40|$|Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) {{are based}} on a {{physical}} track system that greatly limits the ability of the AGV to adapt to changing needs. If the physical track system could be replaced with a trackless AGV, its flexibility could be greatly enhanced. For an AGV to navigate to a known position by trackless means, it should have the capability to locate its own position relative to a global position;This research utilized an ultrasonic distance measurement system based on time-off-light theory to estimate AGV triangulation position. This study also focused on an adaptive navigation and control system that would situate the AGV at any arbitrary position and with an arbitrary two-dimensional attitude. Absolute navigation and control instructions were based on simple control command statements;The absolute navigational algorithm was designed to navigate the AGV with the least possible deviation from a specified path. With the adaptive approach, the AGV can correct its ground track before an unacceptable position error has occurred. A statistical study based on distance and position error, their correlation, and the predicted position error was necessary to test the performance of the new trackless system;To validate this approach, the trackless method was compared with the existing tracked navigation system from several aspects including the duration of ground track completion time. The results from the test runs gave a good insight into the <b>trackless</b> AGV navigation <b>system</b> and the corresponding position error...|$|R
