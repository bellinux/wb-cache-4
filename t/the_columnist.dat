25|$|Some have {{suggested}} that Castro had decided to retaliate for the attempts on his life, and that perhaps he was behind the assassination of JFK. According to the Church Committee: Book V, Drew Pearson, {{a writer for the}} Washington Post, met with Chief Justice Earl Warren in January 1967. <b>The</b> <b>columnist</b> passed along information to Warren that a client of one of his Washington lawyer friends had told his friend that Castro had plans to retaliate. Pearson asked Warren to meet with the lawyer, but Warren never did. However, Warren did inform the director of the Secret Service, James Rowley. Rowley passed the information on to Hoover, who in turn sent six secret letters to senior Bureau officials. There are no records of these conversations, and officials have adamantly denied that conversations about Castro's revenge plans ever took place. The FBI's final word on the matter was that they had not found evidence suggesting that Lee Harvey Oswald had links to the Cuban government. They never informed the new administration of these talks.|$|E
25|$|May 2002 {{also saw}} the revelation that the new public works minister, Don Boudria, had spent the weekend of March 16–17, 2002 at an estate owned by Claude Boulay, the {{president}} of Groupe Everest advertising firm that head received $55million in contracts from the public works ministry, apparently for free. Only after the story of Boudria's stay at the Boulay estate broke in May did Boulay cash an $800 cheque from Boudria that was dated March 16, 2002; many found this to be too convenient, and opposition critics suggested that the cheque had been post-dated to explain away what {{would otherwise have been}} a major ethical violation on the part of Boudria. Boudria was forced to resign on 26 May, to be replaced with Ralph Goodale. An additional scandal broke later in May 2002 when it was revealed that the Defence Minister Art Eggleton had rewarded a contract worth $36, 500 to research mental illness amongst former soldiers to his former lover Maggie Maier without tender {{while at the same time}} the Defence Ministry had already hired a team of experts to research the same subject. As Eggleton was a Paul Martin supporter, Chrétien promptly fired him on May 27, 2002, following a ruling from Howard Wilson that Eggleton had broken conflict-of-interest rules. Some such as <b>the</b> <b>columnist</b> Don Martin believed that Wilson's swift running against the Martinista Eggleton was suspicious with Martin writing Wilson had within a day ruled that Eggleton had broken conflict-of-interest rules while Martin wrote: “But what would you call the prime minister’s chat with a Crown corporation banker to bail out a hotel linked to a golf course he may still have an interest in? Funny, ethics counsellor Howard Wilson was in a “see no evil” monkey mode on that score”.|$|E
500|$|Featured in {{the section}} [...] "In the World of Books" [...] of April 18, 1909 edition of the Los Angeles Herald, Betelguese, a Trip Through Hell was likened to George Sterling's poem [...] "The Wine of Wizardry". In {{comparing}} the two poetic works, <b>the</b> <b>columnist</b> felt that [...] "Betelguese" [...] had made [...] "Mr. Sterling's poor dragons look like small pink lizards," [...] stating that De Esque's work had [...] "immortalized the dreams of the opium eater."

500|$|Following her {{portrayal}} of such characters {{as those in}} Dev.D, Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara, Shaitan, and Margarita With a Straw, Koechlin gained wider recognition and earned the tag of a [...] "nonconformist". Clarisse Loughrey of The Independent described her as [...] "a Bollywood pioneer thanks to her unconventional roles and outspoken public presence". Don Groves of Forbes wrote that she has [...] "managed to subvert stereotypes by playing characters who are nothing like each other". <b>The</b> <b>columnist</b> and film critic Vinayak Chakravorty cites Koechlin {{as one of the}} [...] "new 'new wave' actors" [...] who has proved her easy screen presence in her short time in the film industry.|$|E
500|$|After Daiei {{very briefly}} {{exhibited}} a subtitled {{print of the}} film in Los Angeles, RKO purchased distribution rights to Rashomon in the United States. The company was taking a considerable gamble. It had put out only one prior subtitled film in the American market, and the only previous Japanese talkie commercially released in New York had been Mikio Naruse's comedy, Wife! Be Like a Rose, in 1937: a critical and box-office flop. However, Rashomons commercial run, greatly helped by strong reviews from critics and even <b>the</b> <b>columnist</b> Ed Sullivan, was very successful. (It earned $35,000 in its first three weeks at a single New York theater, an almost unheard-of sum at the time.) ...|$|E
500|$|During {{a feature}} on what storylines were working and {{not working for}} the show, a Soap World {{columnist}} praised the character, saying [...] "Naomi Canning has been perhaps the best new character {{of the last few}} years. Her cougar/cub sex fling with Josh is pure hotness and tends towards the controversial, thus providing good watercooler moments for fans." [...] <b>The</b> <b>columnist</b> also enjoyed Naomi's feud with her mother, as it led to some strong scenes between the two women. However, they criticised Naomi's attempts to seduce Toadie, believing that it was not well executed and for a character [...] "designed to be a husband-stealing minx" [...] her pursuit was [...] "tepid at best". During his review of the show in 2014, Digital Spy's Daniel Kilkelly praised O'Reilly's addition to the cast, saying [...] "Naomi has also been {{a breath of fresh air}} as a character who will push the boundaries just that little bit more than many of her neighbours!" ...|$|E

500|$|Towards {{perceived}} adversaries, Bessie showed neither patience nor respect, {{especially those}} {{with whom she had}} once shared common ground on the far left. Apart from her attacks on Bevan, she displayed particular scorn for the future Labour Party leader Michael Foot, whose practice in the 1950s of writing articles attacking the Labour leadership for right-wing newspapers was, she thought, disloyal. A much reported exchange between her and Churchill has her accusing him of being drunk, and him concurring but adding: [...] "My dear you are ugly, but tomorrow I shall be sober and you will still be ugly"—or similar words. There is no reliable evidence that any such exchange took place; despite its popularity, commentators are generally sceptical. According to <b>the</b> <b>columnist</b> Simon Hoggart, similar stories involving other figures had been circulating for years; he concluded: [...] "If it sounds true, if it echoes something we feel about the politician, then it will cling to him or her as if bonded with superglue".|$|E
500|$|When {{depicting}} {{life in the}} projects, Nas alternates from {{moments of}} pain and pleasure to frustration and braggadocio. <b>The</b> <b>columnist</b> for OhWord.com wrote: [...] " [...] narrative voice swerves between personas that are cynical and optimistic, naïve and world-weary, enraged and serene, globally conscious and provincial". Music writer Jeff Weiss of Pitchfork describes the [...] "enduring image" [...] often associated with Nas's narrated stream of consciousness: [...] " [...] baby-faced Buddha monk in public housing, scribbling lotto dreams and grim reaper nightmares in dollar notebooks, words enjambed in the margins. The only light is the orange glow of a blunt, bodega liquor, and the adolescent rush of first creation. Sometimes his pen taps the paper and his brain blanks. In the next sentence, he remembers dark streets and the noose." [...] Critic and blogger Kenny Waste comments on the significance of Queensbridge as a setting in Illmatic, writing, “The songs are made up largely of recollections or Nas describing his emotions, which range from feeling trapped to overt optimism about his abilities to escape the 'hands of doom'. But they always remain {{within the walls of}} his Queensbridge home.” ...|$|E
500|$|The {{justice of}} Bellingham's {{conviction}} was first questioned by Brougham, who condemned the trial as [...] "the greatest disgrace to English justice". In {{a study published}} in 2004 the American academic Kathleen S. Goddard criticises the timing of the trial so soon after the act, when passions were running high. She also draws attention to the court's refusal to allow an adjournment that would permit the defence to contact possible witnesses. There was, she [...] maintains, insufficient evidence produced at the trial to determine the true state of Bellingham's sanity, and Mansfield's summing-up showed significant bias. Bellingham's claim to have acted alone was accepted in court; Linklater's 2012 study posits that he could been an agent of other interests—perhaps Liverpool merchants, who bore the main brunt of Perceval's economic policies and had much to gain by his demise. Comments by a Liverpool newspaper, says Linklater, indicate that talk of assassination was common in the city. It remains unknown how Bellingham gained the funds to spend freely in the months preceding the assassination, when he was not apparently engaged in any business. This conspiracy theory has not convinced other historians; <b>the</b> <b>columnist</b> Bruce Anderson points to the lack of any concrete evidence to support it.|$|E

500|$|In January 1943, {{while in}} Edinburgh to {{campaign}} in another by-election, Driberg {{was caught by}} a policeman while {{in the act of}} fellating a Norwegian sailor. In his own account of the incident Driberg records that he escaped arrest by identifying himself as [...] "William Hickey" [...] and as a member of parliament. These disclosures evidently overawed the constable, who took no further action; indeed, Driberg says, the incident began a chaste friendship with the officer that endured for more than 10 years. Meanwhile, Beaverbrook had become disenchanted with him, and did not intervene when Arthur Christiansen, the Express editor, sacked <b>the</b> <b>columnist</b> in June 1943 over a story detrimental to a government minister, Andrew Rae Duncan. Driberg subsequently signed up with Reynolds News, a Sunday newspaper owned by the Co-operative Group, and undertook a regular parliamentary column for the New Statesman. He also contributed to a weekly BBC European Service broadcast until, in October 1943, he was banned after government pressure. He reported the post-D-Day allied advances in France and Belgium as a war correspondent for Reynolds News, and {{as a member of a}} parliamentary delegation witnessed the aftermath of the liberation of Buchenwald concentration camp in April 1945.|$|E
