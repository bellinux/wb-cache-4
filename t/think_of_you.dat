500|$|In letters {{revealed}} in 2015, Einstein {{wrote to his}} early love, Marie Winteler, about his marriage and his still-strong feelings for Marie. In 1910 he wrote to her that [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> in heartfelt love every spare minute and am so unhappy as only a man can be" [...] while his wife was pregnant with their second child. Einstein spoke about a [...] "misguided love" [...] and a [...] "missed life" [...] regarding his love for Marie.|$|E
500|$|However, rumors persisted and it {{was later}} whispered in society that Rasputin had seduced not only the Tsarina but also the four grand duchesses. The gossip was fueled by ardent, yet by all {{accounts}} innocent, letters written to Rasputin by the Tsarina and the four grand duchesses which were released by Rasputin and which circulated throughout society. [...] "My dear, precious, only friend," [...] wrote Anastasia. [...] "How much I should {{like to see you}} again. You appeared to me today in a dream. I am always asking Mama when you will come... I <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> always, my dear, because you are so good to me..." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{a series}} of couplets, Goldfrapp sings [...] "I {{borrowed}} bones, I borrowed skin / To save me from the hell I'm in / Your fantasy / And every time I <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> / I see the dark, I hear their hooves", which registers a theme of transformation, according to Chris White from musicOMH. Towards the song's end, she repeats [...] "they're coming for you" [...] in a [...] "reedy and distorted" [...] voice. The track's sound was compared to the works of Depeche Mode and Nine Inch Nails by David Chiu of Consequence of Sound. Furthermore, Chris Gerard, a writer for PopMatters, compared the production's sound to being intoxicated.|$|E

500|$|Kidd {{appeared}} in supporting roles {{as a character}} actor in the 1970s and 1980s, beginning with his performance as the faded, cynical choreographer for a cheesy beauty pageant in the satirical 1975 film Smile, which starred Bruce Dern. Film critic Roger Ebert called Kidd's portrayal of the pageant choreographer a [...] "finely etched semiautobiographical performance". He acted in and staged the musical sequences in the 1978 film Movie Movie, which was directed by [...] Stanley Donen, with whom he'd worked in Seven Brides for Seven Brothers and It's Always Fair Weather. Kidd directed an episode of the TV comedy Laverne and Shirley (1990), as well as scenes for Janet Jackson in two music videos, When I <b>Think</b> <b>of</b> <b>You</b> (1986) and Alright (1990). He conceived and choreographed the television special Baryshnikov in Hollywood, starring Mikhail Baryshnikov, in 1982, {{for which he was}} nominated for an Emmy Award.|$|E
500|$|Yitzhak Azulay {{composed}} the music played in Fill the Void. He chose primarily melodic and traditional pieces, using them frequently throughout the film. Other soundtrack is composed largely of contemporary Orthodox pop music, and the prayers are [...] "regularly chanted rather than spoken". The song [...] "Im Eshkachech Yerushalayim" [...] (Hebrew: אם אשכחך ירושלים, 'If I Forget Thee Jerusalem') features {{prominently in the}} film, playing at {{all three of the}} major events: the funeral, the Bris Milah, and the wedding. Azulay used an a cappella version of the song, which is derived from an excerpt of Psalm 137 and expresses the yearnings of the Jewish people in exile following the Babylonian conquest of Jerusalem in 586 BCE: [...] "If I forget you, O Jerusalem, let my right hand wither; Let my tongue stick to my palate if I cease to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>you,</b> if I do not keep Jerusalem in memory even at my happiest hour." ...|$|E

500|$|... "We Belong Together" [...] is an R ballad. Rolling Stone {{called it}} [...] "soulful." [...] The song is {{propelled}} by a programmed Roland TR-808-styled kick and hi-hat, which is prominently utilized in hip hop music. Reviewer Jennifer Vineyard from MTV News commented that Carey's spare and understated singing approach gave the song more power, {{which would not}} have been achieved if she had belted. The song also incorporates 1980s retro-soul music by [...] "cleverly" [...] referencing Bobby Womack's [...] "If You Think You're Lonely Now" [...] (1981) and the Deele's [...] "Two Occasions" [...] (1987), with Babyface. In the second verse of [...] "We Belong Together", Carey sings: [...] "Bobby Womack's on the radio / Singing to me, 'If you think you're lonely now'." [...] She then flips across a radio dial: [...] "So I turn the dial, tryin’ to catch a break / And then I hear Babyface / 'I only think of you...'." [...] The line [...] "If you think you're lonely now" [...] is from the song of the same name and [...] "I only think of you" [...] is from the chorus of [...] "Two Occasions." [...] In the remix she also says [...] "I only <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> / On two occasions / That's day and night..." [...] Due to the inclusion of the lyrics from both songs, the songwriters were given co-writing credits on the song. [...] "We Belong Together" [...] follows the common verse-chorus form and is structured into three distinct sections, with each section presenting the protagonist in different emotions. The first section chronicles the break-up of the couple, and a sorrowful tone is established as she laments her former mistakes. In the second section, the narrative switches to the present, and the protagonist becomes increasingly agitated and feels [...] "all out of her element" [...] when she attempts to distract herself by listening to the radio, but fails. [...] "We Belong Together" [...] does not have a bridge; instead, Carey transitions into the third section by raising the pitch an octave, which emphasizes the sheer frustration and desperation of the protagonist. Metro Times writer Johnny Loftus described the song's production, lyrics and vocals in detail: ...|$|E

2500|$|After a time {{living in}} one of the {{imperial}} residences in the Crimea, she received reports that her sons, her daughter-in-law and her grandchildren had been murdered. However, she publicly rejected the report as a rumour. On the day after the murder of the Tsar's family, Maria received a messenger from Nicky, [...] "a touching man" [...] who told how difficult was the life of her son's family in Yekaterinburg. [...] "And nobody can help or liberate them - only God! My Lord save my poor, unlucky Nicky, help him in his hard ordeals!" [...] In her diary she comforted herself: [...] "I am sure they all got out of Russia and now the Bolsheviks are trying to hide the truth." [...] She firmly held on to this conviction until her death. The truth was too painful for her to admit publicly. Her letters to her son and his family have since almost all been lost; but in one that survives, she wrote to Nicholas: [...] "You know that my thoughts and prayers never leave you. I <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> day and night and sometimes feel so sick at heart that I believe I cannot bear it any longer. But God is merciful. He will give us strength for this terrible ordeal."
