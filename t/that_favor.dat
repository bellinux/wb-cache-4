5|$|In {{practical}} terms, horses {{prefer to}} eat {{small amounts of}} food steadily throughout the day, {{as they do in}} nature when grazing on pasture. Although this is not always possible with modern stabling practices and human schedules <b>that</b> <b>favor</b> feeding horses twice a day, {{it is important to remember}} the underlying biology of the animal when determining what to feed, how often, and in what quantities.|$|E

5|$|Acquired {{risk factors}} include the strong risk factor of older age, which alters blood {{composition}} to favor clotting. Other important acquired risk factors include major surgery and trauma, {{both of which}} may increase the risk because of tissue factor from outside the vascular system entering the blood. In orthopedic surgery, venous stasis may be temporarily provoked by a cessation of blood flow {{as part of the}} procedure. Cancer can grow in and around veins, causing venous stasis, and can also stimulate increased levels of tissue factor. Pregnancy causes blood to favor clotting, and in the postpartum, placental tearing releases substances <b>that</b> <b>favor</b> clotting. Oral contraceptives and hormonal replacement therapy increase the risk through a variety of mechanisms, including altered blood coagulation protein levels and reduced fibrinolysis.|$|E

25|$|In modern {{industrial}} uses, a {{packing material}} {{is used in}} the column instead of trays when low pressure drops across the column are required. Other factors <b>that</b> <b>favor</b> packing are: vacuum systems, smaller diameter columns, corrosive systems, systems prone to foaming, systems requiring low liquid holdup, and batch distillation. Conversely, factors <b>that</b> <b>favor</b> plate columns are: presence of solids in feed, high liquid rates, large column diameters, complex columns, columns with wide feed composition variation, columns with a chemical reaction, absorption columns, columns limited by foundation weight tolerance, low liquid rate, large turn-down ratio and those processes subject to process surges.|$|E

Political parties are organized along ideologies <b>that</b> <b>favor</b> independence from Canada (sovereigntist or separatist) and various degrees of autonomy within Canada (federalists). Social democrats, liberals, and conservatives are therefore present in most major parties, creating internal tensions.|$|E

25|$|In many ecosystems, {{communities}} tend {{to recover}} following {{mild to moderate}} natural and anthropogenic disturbances. Restoration in these systems involves hastening natural successional trajectories. However, {{a system that has}} experienced a more severe disturbance (i.e. physical or chemical alteration of the environment) may require intensive restorative efforts to recreate environmental conditions <b>that</b> <b>favor</b> natural successional processes. This ability to recover is called resilience.|$|E
25|$|This {{probability}} is the p-value, considering only extreme results <b>that</b> <b>favor</b> heads. This {{is called}} a one-tailed test. However, the deviation can be in either direction, favoring either heads or tails. The two-tailed p-value, which considers deviations favoring either heads or tails, may instead be calculated. As the binomial distribution is symmetrical for a fair coin, the two-sided p-value is simply twice the above calculated single-sided p-value: the two-sided p-value is 0.115.|$|E

Democrats have {{a presence in}} La Marque and Texas City, {{both of which are}} home to large numbers of unionized refinery workers and African Americans, a traditionally Democratic voting bloc. However, Democrats' strength in this area is increasingly being superseded by newer developments in the northern areas of the county around Friendswood and League City <b>that</b> <b>favor</b> Republicans.|$|E

25|$|At {{the level}} of initiation, RNA {{polymerase}} in prokaryotes (bacteria in particular) binds strongly to the promoter region and initiates a high basal rate of transcription. No ATP hydrolysis is needed for the close-to-open transition, promoter melting is driven by binding reactions <b>that</b> <b>favor</b> the melted conformation. Chromatin greatly impedes transcription in eukaryotes. Assembly of large multi-protein preinitiation complex is required for promoter-specific initiation. Promoter melting in eukaryotes requires hydrolysis of ATP. As a result, eukaryotic RNA polymerases exhibit a low basal rate of transcription initiation.|$|E
25|$|Mammals <b>that</b> <b>favor</b> forest habitat predominate {{within the}} Slide Wilderness. Among the 49 species known to exist there, black bears have done {{exceptionally}} well, as have snowshoe hare, gray squirrel and porcupine. White-tailed deer, who were successfully reintroduced into New York in 1887 via a protected habitat on lands {{now part of}} the wilderness area, winter here. Cottontail rabbit and beaver also maintain lower population levels. Fisher were reintroduced to the area in the late 1970s and have thrived in numbers significant enough to make life difficult for the porcupine, always abundant in the Catskills.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, the immigration-reduction {{advocacy}} {{think tank}} the Center for Immigration Studies released a poll {{that found that}} 68% of Americans think U.S. immigration levels are too high, and just 2% said they are too low. They also found that 70% said {{they are less likely}} to vote for candidates <b>that</b> <b>favor</b> increasing legal immigration. In 2004, 55% of Americans believed legal immigration should remain at the current level or increased and 41% said it should be decreased. The less contact a native-born American has with immigrants, the more likely one would have a negative view of immigrants.|$|E

25|$|Russian protests {{have gained}} media {{attention}} with the reelection of Vladimir Putin in 2012. Attention {{has been given}} to incidence of violence via posting videos online. President Dmitry Medvedev has initiated reforms of the police force, in an attempt to minimize the violence by firing the Moscow police chief and centralizing police powers. Police divisions in Russia are often based on loyalty systems <b>that</b> <b>favor</b> bureaucratic power among political elites. Phone tapping and business raids are common practice in the country, and often fail to give due process to citizens. Proper investigations of police officials still remains lacking by western standards.|$|E
25|$|Cattle have a {{propensity}} to aggregate around water, {{which can be}} detrimental to riparian ecosystems. While native ungulates such as deer are commonly found in riparian zones, livestock may trample or graze down native plants, creating an unnatural amount and type of disturbance that riparian species have not evolved to tolerate. Livestock grazing {{has been shown to}} reduce areal cover of native plant species, create disturbance frequencies <b>that</b> <b>favor</b> exotic annual weeds, and alter plant community composition. For example, in an arid South African ecosystem, grazing was found to cause a reduction of grasses, sedges, and tree species and an increase in non-succulent shrubs.|$|E
25|$|To design optimal {{growth media}} {{with respect to}} {{enhanced}} growth rates or useful by-product secretion, {{it is possible to}} use a method known as Phenotypic Phase Plane analysis. PhPP involves applying FBA repeatedly on the model while co-varying the nutrient uptake constraints and observing the value of the objective function (or by-product fluxes). PhPP makes it possible to find the optimal combination of nutrients <b>that</b> <b>favor</b> a particular phenotype or a mode of metabolism resulting in higher growth rates or secretion of industrially useful by-products. The predicted growth rates of bacteria in varying media have been shown to correlate well with experimental results. as well as to define precise minimal media for the culture of Salmonella typhimurium.|$|E
