500|$|Once the {{abolition}} of slavery in the rebel states became a military objective, as Union armies advanced south, more slaves were liberated until all three million of them in Confederate territory were freed. Lincoln's comment on the signing of the Proclamation was: [...] "I never, in my life, felt more certain <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> right, than I do in signing this paper." [...] For some time, Lincoln continued earlier plans to set up colonies for the newly freed slaves. He commented favorably on colonization in the Emancipation Proclamation, but all attempts at such a massive undertaking failed. A few days after Emancipation was announced, 13 Republican governors met at the War Governors' Conference; they supported the president's Proclamation, but suggested the removal of General George B. McClellan as commander of the Union Army.|$|E
500|$|DJ Shadow's singles for Mo' Wax – {{including}} [...] "In/Flux" [...] and [...] "Lost and Found (S.F.L.)" [...] – were, as Sean Cooper of AllMusic wrote, {{hailed as}} [...] "genre-bending {{works of art}} that merged elements of funk, rock, hip hop, ambient, jazz, soul, and used-bin found records." [...] Andy Pemberton, a music journalist writing for Mixmag, coined the term [...] "trip hop" [...] in June 1994 to describe [...] "In/Flux" [...] and similar tracks being spun in London clubs at the time. DJ Shadow's follow-up single [...] "What Does Your Soul Look Like" [...] topped the British independent music charts. Following this period, he began work on his debut album, intent on capturing the downbeat mood that characterized his aforementioned three singles. The album was aptly titled Endtroducing....., as according to DJ Shadow, [...] "it signified the fourth and final chapter {{in a series of}} pieces <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> for Mo' Wax with a certain sound, a certain tone, a certain atmosphere." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} for MTV News at Dylan's Candy Bar, Minaj revealed that she had kept the collaboration a secret from everyone she knew because she was [...] "so surprised" [...] at being asked to work with Carey and {{did not believe that}} the collaboration would actually come to fruition. [...] "That one, I didn’t believe until I was physically in the studio <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> with something with Mariah," [...] Minaj said. [...] "She’s an icon, I’ve loved her since I was little, like ’Vision of Love,’ ’Someday.’ I was one of those little girls in the mirror singing her songs with my mother.” A release date of February 23, 2010, for the album was slated, and then pushed back to March 9. It was then further pushed back to March 30. However, it was confirmed in March 2010 that production of Angels Advocate had halted and the project was shelved indefinitely. Island Def Jam stated that the singer was instead working on a new project and [...] "new surprises". Metro revealed that Carey was possibly recording a Christmas album.|$|E

2500|$|By the mid-1980s, Jourgensen parted {{ways with}} George and signed to Sire Records. Jourgensen {{performed}} mostly solo for Ministry's next LP, Twitch (1986), which sold well, {{but was still}} considered to be [...] "underground". The music was danceable electronic music, but was not pop music, and the sound was harsher and more aggressive than what Ministry had recorded before. According to Jourgensen, [...] "Twitch was stuff <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> before With Sympathy came out. Some of that stuff was already {{four or five years}} old, but the record company didn't want to use it, so...". Much of the new sound was created with the use of digital sampling and the input of producer Adrian Sherwood.|$|E
2500|$|Brian {{believed}} {{the band was}} worried about him separating from the group, elaborating that [...] "it was generally considered that the Beach Boys were the main thing... with Pet Sounds, there was a resistance in <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> most of the artistic work on it vocally". Love wrote: [...] "I also {{would have liked to}} have had a greater hand in some of the songs and been able to incorporate more often my 'lead voice,' which we'd had so much success with." [...] The conflicts were resolved, according to Brian, [...] " [...] they figured that it was a showcase for Brian Wilson, but it's still the Beach Boys. In other words, they gave in. They let me have my little stint." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nazir-Ali {{was ordained}} as an Anglican priest in 1976 {{and worked in}} Karachi and Lahore. He became the first Bishop of Raiwind in West Punjab (1984–86), {{at the time he}} was the {{youngest}} bishop in the Anglican Communion. When his life was endangered in Pakistan in 1986, Robert Runcie, then the Archbishop of Canterbury, arranged for his refuge in England. Nazir-Ali said, [...] "the reason behind some of the difficulties I was facing was removed when General Zia was killed - unfortunately for him, and I am now not doing the work <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> at the time with the very poor". He became an assistant to the Archbishop at Lambeth and assisted with the planning of the 1988 Lambeth Conference; he was General Secretary of the Church Mission Society 1989-1994 and concurrently an Assistant Bishop in the Diocese of Southwark. He was appointed Bishop of Rochester, England in 1994, and in 1999 entered the House of Lords as one of the [...] "Lords Spiritual" [...] because of his seniority in episcopal office, the first religious leader from Asia to serve there. He was one of the final candidates for Archbishop of Canterbury, though Rowan Williams was appointed by the British prime minister, Tony Blair.|$|E
