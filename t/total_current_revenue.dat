40|$|This paper aims at {{determining}} whether economic, financial and monetary integration {{on the one}} hand, and institutional factors on the other, {{may have led to}} gradual convergence in key fiscal variables across the euro area over the recent period, bringing fiscal positions closer together. The Maastricht convergence criteria have facilitated this process but we investigate here whether the structural factors bringing fiscal positions closer together have been a feature of European integration starting already in the 1970 s. The alternative scenario is that the euro zone is still characterised by largely idiosyncratic national fiscal policies. Over the 1970 - 1998 period we run contemporaneous cross-correlation, dispersion and cointegration tests using annual data for government net lending, and <b>total</b> <b>current</b> <b>revenue</b> and expenditure to uncover common trends, as measures of fiscal convergence. We also investigate whether the short term fiscal position in a given country shares both a common euro area component and national features (i. e., idiosyncratic national cycles) using a dynamic factor analysis on quarterly data for the four largest euro area countries since 1985. We find convincing evidence that for euro area countries cross-correlation has increased steadily over the sample period and that fiscal dispersion has been declining at a sustained pace among all countries in the sample. There is evidence of cointegration across the euro area for several countries on the basis of <b>total</b> <b>current</b> <b>revenue,</b> and also for total current expenditure. However, when the series are corrected for the business cycle, cointegration is only accepted for net lending. There is clearly common fiscal cycles for net lending across the euro area that do not only express common business cycles. However, while countries have followed more similar policies in the 1990 s in particular during the run-up to EMU, the timing of fiscal adjustment differed across countries. In addition, idiosyncratic components still contribute to a significant share of the variability of individual countries. JEL Classification: H 60, E 61, C 22...|$|E

40|$|Twelve <b>current</b> funds <b>revenue</b> sources {{utilized}} by 212 {{community colleges in}} 11 Midwest states during {{the decade of the}} 1990 s were analyzed, using data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), available on the Internet. Comparisons were made by state as well as time, using the two-way analysis of variance. Of particular interest were trends in the proportions of student tuition and fees, and state and/or local appropriations from 1990 to 1995 to 2000. Also examined was the states 2 ̆ 7 use of alternative funding sources to compensate for a possible reduction in government appropriations. Different funding models within the 11 states were identified. They were evaluated in terms of their success in sustaining or increasing revenue income without a disproportionate increase in student tuition and fees.;Significant differences were found among the states in the proportion of <b>total</b> <b>current</b> funds <b>revenue</b> attributed to the 12 sources, especially for tuition and fees, state appropriations, and local appropriations. The community colleges in the study were not actively utilizing alternative funding sources. The proportion of <b>total</b> <b>current</b> funds <b>revenue</b> was less than. 05 for each of 6 revenue sources (federal appropriations, local grants, private gifts, endowment income, sales and service of educational activities, and other sources of revenue).;Overall, a significant difference in funding was found between the years 1990 and 1995 for state appropriations and student tuition and fees. For the decade, eight states reported a proportional decrease in state appropriations. Six of these states had an increase in tuition and fees. Two states indicated an increase in local appropriations. A continuing trend of reduced proportion of state support was found. Statistically significant state by year interaction results existed for state appropriations, sales and service of educational activities, and other sources.;Four models of <b>current</b> funds <b>revenue</b> funding were revealed. All four models generated revenue in excess of the Higher Education Price Index (HEPI) for the period.

40|$|A broad {{outline of}} the main {{elements}} of the Norwegian local tax system is first given. This is followed by a discussion of some of the changes that have taken place in the relative distribution of various sources of local revenue since the mid-seventies. It is shown that although local government's share of total national income tax revenues has increased over recent years, such taxes have decreased as a proportion of total local revenues. This relative decline in the importance of local income taxes has been compensated, in particular, by increases in state grants. Thus, whereas in 1977 taxes accounted for 53 % of <b>total</b> local <b>current</b> <b>revenues,</b> by 1982 this proportion had dropped to 47 %. Over the same period, central government grants increased from 31 % to 35 % of <b>current</b> <b>revenues.</b> It is also shown that fees and charges are becoming increasingly important as sources of local revenues. These relative changes in the composition of local revenues have not been uniform across all municipalities. Whereas the larger cities were subject to real cutbacks in tax revenues, taxes continued to increase in the smallest and most peripheral municipalities, despite a government decision in 1978 to lower the maximum local tax rate. Overall, it is suggested that the long-term effect of the policy of central government, as regards local revenues, has been to bring about a rather massive redistribution of revenues, solely benefitting the smallest and already the most well-off municipalities. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{developed}} and developing countries, taxation makes up {{a significant part of}} government‟s <b>current</b> <b>total</b> <b>revenue.</b> Tax efficiency is important in order to maximize revenue {{that can be used in}} the redistribution of wealth and public expenditure. Larger economies, however, experience difficulties in remaining efficient. This study, therefore, seeks to investigate the effect country size has on tax revenues for developing countries and to discuss whether the findings of Codrington (1989) in the 1980 s still hold in the twenty-first century. Analytical and empirical methodologies were conducted using a total of thirty-four countries. Conflicting results were found. Analytically, size played a discriminating role with respect to utilization of the tax systems as 72. 6 percent were employed by maxi-states while 59. 7 percent were adopted by small economies. Micro economies were heavily reliant on international trade and transaction taxes. Empirically, population positively influenced tax-to-GDP ratios while openness was statistically insignificant. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{undertake}} a bioeconomic {{analysis of the}} aggregate traditional fisheries in the Northern and Central areas of Red Sea {{off the coast of}} the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Results of our analysis using a Fox model and the Clarke-Yoshimoto-Pooley (CY&P) estimation procedure suggest that the aggregate traditional fisheries have been overfished since the early 1990 s. The estimated stock size in recent years is as low as 6, 400 MT, while the estimated stock size associated with the maximum economic yield (MEY) is 19, 300 MT. The socially optimal level of fishing effort is about 139, 000 days. Thus, the current effort level of 300, 000 to 350, 000 days constitutes a problem of overfishing. The estimated <b>current</b> <b>total</b> gross <b>revenue</b> from the traditional fisheries is Saudi Rials (SR) 147 million with zero net benefit. If total fishing effort is reduced to the socially optimal level, then we estimate gross revenue would be SR 167 million and the potential net benefit from the KSA Red Sea traditional fisheries could be as large as SR 111 million.

40|$|This {{research}} aims to {{find the}} key determinants of the variation of the tax revenue capacity in China, and to evaluate China’s tax revenue performance at provincial level. The econometric quantitative method is applied in this study for these purposes. The data {{used in this study}} covers the period between 1995 and 2013 on 31 provinces, autonomous or municipal cities directly {{under the control of the}} Central Government. Differing from the previous research, a new dependent variable, the <b>current</b> <b>revenue</b> ratio is used in addition to the conventional tax ratio. The <b>current</b> <b>revenue</b> is the sum of tax revenue and non-tax soured revenue excludes State Owned Enterprises revenues and expenditures. Eleven independent variables falling into six categories were selected. These six categories were: The traditional tax handles, GDP decomposition, Population factors, Income inequality, Governmental factors, and Corruption. The contributions of this study are: Firstly, for the first time the author constructed the <b>current</b> <b>revenue</b> ratio as the second dependent variable to represent the broader fiscal revenue and true tax-like revenue performance for studying tax effort index in China. Secondly, this study constructed the rural-urban income disparity Theil index as one of the explanatory variables in the tax effort index models for the first time in China’s tax performance study. Thirdly, for the first time in the tax effort index literature, this study used country specific data on corruption in a single country tax effort index model. The main results of this study are: 1) tax revenue capacity is mainly determined by the economic factors whereas the <b>current</b> <b>revenue</b> capacity is determined by both the economic and social factors; 2) tax revenue performance is diluted by the existence of non-tax sourced revenues; 3) the <b>current</b> <b>revenue</b> ratio is a better indicator for true tax performance; 4) There exists a regional disparity of tax or <b>current</b> <b>revenue</b> capacity among provinces. 5) tax/current revenue capacities and tax/current revenue efforts are mismatched in some provinces...|$|R
