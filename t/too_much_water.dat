5|$|September 16, 1999– Hurricane Floyd {{crosses the}} entire state as a {{tropical}} storm, unleashing torrential rainfall amounting {{to a maximum of}} 13.34inches (33.88cm) in Somerville. Cape May reports a storm surge of 2.6feet (.79m). Five rivers, including the Raritan River, withhold <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>water</b> and exceed flood stages. Strong wind gusts leave over 650,000citizens without power during the storm's passage. Floyd caused great damage in the state and six casualties.|$|E
5|$|Along with Once Upon ay Time in Mumbai Dobaara!, Chennai Express was {{initially}} abandoned by Pakistani distributors and exhibitors because four Pakistani films were released {{on the same}} day. The release dates were postponed to 15 and 9 August, respectively. During its Wai schedule of filming, the film's unit ran into trouble for using <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>water</b> from Dhom Dam, in the drought-stricken Satara district of Maharashtra. The state's relief and rehabilitation minister, Patangrao Kadam, addressed the problem.|$|E
5|$|The Achaeans were {{demoralized}} by this battle; Aratus {{declined the}} generalship, and when both Athens and the Aetolian League turned down their appeals, they sued Cleomenes for peace. Initially, Cleomenes advanced only minor requests, {{but as the}} talks continued, his demands became greater and he eventually insisted that leadership of the League be surrendered to him. In exchange, {{he would return to}} the Achaeans the prisoners and strongholds he had seized. The Achaeans invited Cleomenes to Lerna, where they were holding council. While marching there, Cleomenes drank <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>water,</b> which caused him to lose his voice and cough up blood—a situation that forced him to return to Sparta.|$|E
50|$|The third main {{pollutant}} is {{waste water}} from everyday household activities {{in cities and}} small towns. One of the major problems at the Kamchia reservoir {{is the lack of}} purified water provided to the town of Kotel. The city of Varna discharges <b>too</b> <b>much</b> impure <b>water.</b>|$|R
60|$|We had {{a visitor}} {{from the village}} of Powhatan very soon after Captain Smith took command of Jamestown {{to such an extent that}} the gentlemen were forced to work and to speak without oaths, through fear of getting <b>too</b> <b>much</b> cold <b>water</b> inside the sleeves of their doublets.|$|R
50|$|Gardeners in cold-winter {{states have}} also had success with newer cross-breeds, {{especially}} those between L. Indica and L. Faueri, which offer increased winter hardiness. Frequently L. Indica is root hardy to Zone 5, meaning it will be killed back during harsh winters but regrow from the roots and flower in summer. As such Northern gardeners treat it more like a perennial than a tree or shrub. The U.S. National Arboretum has developed cold-hardy varieties that can withstand Zone 6 winters, though they may die back during bad cold snaps. <b>Too</b> <b>much</b> <b>watering</b> and over-fertilizing can decrease the cold hardiness of L. indica because it stimulates new growth {{late in the season}} that does not have time to harden off.|$|R
5|$|The {{defeated}} army suffered greatly, {{not only}} from the Byzantine pursuit, but also due to lack of water: before the battle, Kardarigan had ordered the water supplies poured to the ground, trying to make his men fight harder to break through the Byzantine army and reach the Arzamon. In addition, the surviving Persians were refused entry into Dara since, according to Simocatta, Persian custom forbade entrance to fugitives. Simocatta also narrates that many Persians died of thirst or from water poisoning when they drank <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>water</b> from wells after their ordeal. Kardarigan himself had managed to find refuge on a nearby hilltop with a small detachment and withstood several Byzantine attacks. Finally, after three or four days, the Byzantines, not aware that the enemy commander was there, abandoned the effort. Kardarigan thus escaped, although his men suffered further casualties in the process, up to a thousand according to Simocatta, from Byzantine patrols.|$|E
5|$|With the {{introduction}} of non-native species, predominantly giant reed, castor bean and tobacco tree, native plant species in the watershed began to die out. As giant reed is not suitable habitat for many species, areas infested by giant reed are biologically dead in comparison with unaffected areas. It can grow extremely fast, removing <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>water</b> from the creek, and during flood events, {{many parts of the}} giant reed can wash downstream and re-establish themselves as a new colony, increasing the problem. Along with increasing concentrations of nutrients from fertilizer and other substances contained in runoff, algal blooms began to hurt the water quality of the creek, especially above Sulphur Creek Reservoir. The historically seasonal creek was replaced with a constant flow of polluted water from several large storm drains and many smaller ones.|$|E
5|$|By 01:00, {{there was}} <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>water</b> in the hull for the pumps to handle. Water began {{to enter the}} forward {{generator}} compartments, which forced the crew to work by candlelight. Lützow was so low in the water by 01:30 that water began to flood the forward boiler room. By that point, {{almost all of the}} compartments in the forward part of the ship, up to the conning tower and below the main armored deck, were thoroughly flooded. Water had also entered the ship through shell holes in the forecastle above the armored deck; the majority of the upper portion of the ship forward of the forward-most barbette was flooded as well. The battlecruiser's crew attempted to patch the shell holes three times, but as the flooding worsened and the draft increased, water increasingly washed over the deck and inhibited progress on the repair work. The crew attempted to reverse direction and steam backwards, but this had to be abandoned when the bow became so submerged that the propellers were pulled partially out of the water; forward draft had increased to over 17meters.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the major}} {{problems}} resulting from the construction of C-44 is that control of the water levels of Lake Okeechobee causes <b>too</b> <b>much</b> fresh <b>water</b> to discharge from the canal into the St. Lucie Estuary. Large discharges from Lake Okeechobee into C-44 cause salinity levels to drop rapidly, killing many species in the estuary.|$|R
6000|$|... "There's <b>too</b> <b>much</b> blame tide hereabouts {{to trust}} to your instinks," [...] he said. [...] "Heave over the anchor, Harve, and we'll fish a piece till the thing lifts. Bend on your biggest lead. Three pound ain't any <b>too</b> <b>much</b> in this <b>water.</b> See how she's {{tightened}} on her rodin' already." ...|$|R
50|$|In the Limbo Challenge, Ollie {{completed}} {{the course in}} 2:19 and Alex T, despite not having <b>too</b> <b>much</b> confidence in <b>water,</b> his time of 2:36 {{was not enough to}} win the Limbo Challenge. Therefore, Ollie was the prize for the winning team in Ultimate Jeopardy.|$|R
5|$|Upon {{growing to}} certain heights, the Star Plant grows through larger {{floating}} islands. These islands, {{along with the}} smaller ones surrounding the Star Plant, contain power-up crystals which can be collected to provide B.U.D. with extra abilities. Creatures and other plant life {{can also be found}} throughout the game's islands, as well as environmental features, such as caves and water currents. Some parts of the environment, such as leaves growing off of both the Star Plant and Star Shoots that allow the player to jump to greater heights than normally possible, can affect how the player moves throughout the world. Teleportation pads allow the player to move around the world quickly and act as save points. The player also respawns at their last activated teleportation pad if they die, which can be caused by falling long distances, being in <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>water</b> for too long, or by the player making B.U.D. self-destruct. Additionally, players can scan various flora and fauna into the teleporters to retrieve data from them. Items can be picked up by the player and stored in B.U.D.'s backpack one at a time, such as flower parachutes that make the player fall more slowly towards the ground, and leaf gliders that allow the player to travel further through the air.|$|E
25|$|The larger steamer Joseph Kellogg {{also ran}} on the same route on {{alternating}} days, except Kellogg drew <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>water</b> to go further upriver than Kelso.|$|E
25|$|Fluid {{balance is}} key. Profuse {{sweating}} {{can increase the}} need for electrolyte (salt) replacement. Water intoxication (which results in hyponatremia), the process of consuming <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>water</b> too quickly, can be fatal.|$|E
50|$|Chinese {{softshell}} turtles often submerge {{their heads}} in water. This is because they carry a gene which produces a protein {{that allows them to}} secrete urea from their mouths. This adaptation helps them survive in brackish water by making it possible for them to excrete urea without drinking <b>too</b> <b>much</b> salty <b>water.</b> Rather than eliminating urea by urinating through their cloaca as most turtles do, which involves significant water loss, they simply rinse their mouths in the water.|$|R
50|$|It {{would be}} {{difficult}} to overstate the importance of the annual flood to Egyptian civilization. A moderate inundation was {{a vital part of the}} agricultural cycle; however, a lighter inundation than normal would cause famine, and <b>too</b> <b>much</b> flood <b>water</b> would be equally disastrous, washing away much of the infrastructure built on the flood plain. Records from AD 622-999 indicate that on average, one year out of every 4 (28%) saw an inundation that fell short of expectations, during 102 of those years.|$|R
5000|$|Also, if <b>too</b> <b>much</b> fresh <b>water</b> {{flows into}} the Patawalonga it can kill off {{saltwater}} species of fish {{that exist in the}} lake - which, again, can result in an unpleasant odour, An event like this occurred on the weekend of 22-23 January 2005, and was reported {{on the front page of}} the Adelaide Advertiser as follows:Residents woke yesterday to an [...] "awful" [...] stench and the sight of hundreds of seagulls converging on the area in a feeding frenzy.|$|R
25|$|At this stage, {{the soap}} still {{contains}} <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>water,</b> {{which has to}} be removed. This was traditionally done on chill rolls, which produced the soap flakes commonly used in the 1940s and 1950s. This process was superseded by spray dryers and then by vacuum dryers.|$|E
25|$|Le Geyt then {{discovered}} that Stork drew <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>water</b> to permit her {{to enter the}} Gulf of Batabanó. He therefore transferred to the other three vessels his boats and men and sent in the cutting-out expedition {{under the command of}} Commander Edward Rushworth of Superieure.|$|E
25|$|The Erie Canal {{management}} did {{not like}} swelling for two reasons. First, it used <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>water</b> lowering the water on the pound above sometimes causing boats to run aground. In addition, it raised the water level on the pound below causing some boats to strike bridges or get stuck.|$|E
50|$|However, the {{cultivation}} and processing of cotton {{turned out to}} require <b>too</b> <b>much</b> labour and <b>water,</b> {{and the results were}} not in a reasonable proportion compared with the amount of work required. Furthermore, the Ovambos were used to getting material from the Finns and were not motivated to produce their own material. This experiment thus had to be abandoned.|$|R
40|$|There are {{concerns}} that altered thyroid functioning {{could be the}} result of ingesting <b>too</b> <b>much</b> fluoride. Community <b>water</b> fluoridation (CWF) is an important source of fluoride exposure. Our objectives were to examine the association between fluoride exposure and (1) diagnosis of a thyroid condition and (2) indicators of thyroid functioning among a national population-based sample of Canadians...|$|R
50|$|Washing {{is largely}} {{restricted}} to the upper portions where the cake surface is nearly horizontal in orientation, which occurs at {{the temperature of the}} feed. The ceramic filter uses a sintered alumina disc to dewater slurry under low vacuum. The dewatering occurs by drawing water from the slurry by capillary action. This ensures that no air or particles are drawn into the filter medium to cause blockage. However, if <b>too</b> <b>much</b> wash <b>water</b> is applied then it can cascade down the cake and into the feed trough, where it merely dilutes the slurry.|$|R
25|$|The EFSA panel also {{determined}} intakes for different populations. Recommended intake volumes {{in the elderly}} {{are the same as}} for adults as despite lower energy consumption, the water requirement of this group is increased due to a reduction in renal concentrating capacity. Pregnant and breastfeeding women require additional fluids to stay hydrated. The EFSA panel proposes that pregnant women should consume the same volume of water as non-pregnant women, plus an increase in proportion to the higher energy requirement, equal to 300 mL/day. To compensate for additional fluid output, breastfeeding women require an additional 700 mL/day above the recommended intake values for non-lactating women. Dehydration and over-hydration - too little and <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>water,</b> respectively - can have harmful consequences. Drinking <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>water</b> is one of the possible causes of hyponatremia, i.e., low serum sodium.|$|E
25|$|Vacuoles: Vacuoles {{sequester}} {{waste products}} and in plant cells store water. They are {{often described as}} liquid filled space and are surrounded by a membrane. Some cells, most notably Amoeba, have contractile vacuoles, which can pump {{water out of the}} cell if there is <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>water.</b> The vacuoles of plant cells and fungal cells are usually larger than those of animal cells.|$|E
25|$|The Esopus's role in {{the state}} and {{regional}} economy has led to a concentrated effort to protect and manage it, particularly on the upper stretch. The interests of the various stakeholders have not always converged, particularly where it concerns the city's management of its water needs. Turbidity created by discharges from the Shandaken Tunnel after a 1996 flood led to a successful lawsuit against the city and a state regulation; downstream of the reservoir the city has been criticized for contributing to flooding problems by releasing <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>water</b> during heavy rainstorms. Boaters and anglers have also clashed, and invasive species are beginning to enter the upper creek as well.|$|E
50|$|The {{issue in}} the case in 1902 (185 U.S. 125) was whether Colorado, as is claimed by Kansas, is taking <b>too</b> <b>much</b> of the <b>water</b> of the Arkansas River, making the land along the river in Kansas much less {{valuable}} due to reduced water flow. The court chose to delay making a decision until {{all of the facts}} were in evidence.|$|R
50|$|Qualifying for Race 2 {{was only}} {{partially}} completed on Sunday May 31 {{when it was}} canceled due to heavy rains causing <b>too</b> <b>much</b> standing <b>water</b> on the track. As a result, starting positions were determined by overall point standings. The rain tapered off later in the after race took place {{later in the day}} as scheduled. Sébastien Bourdais of KV Racing Technology won a timed-Race 2 which went 68 laps out of a scheduled 70. Takuma Sato racing for A. J. Foyt Enterprises and Graham Rahal of Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing taking the third podium spot.|$|R
50|$|While group one {{managed to}} {{complete}} its qualifying round, group two {{was unable to}} complete any qualifying laps. This was due to heavy rains creating <b>too</b> <b>much</b> standing <b>water</b> on the track and bringing out a red flag less than 4 mins into. As a result, the starting order was then set according to overall point standing. This erased rookie Sage Karams best qualifying time which had him poised to be either in the pole position or starting second. Karams qualifying time would have marked the highest start position for any rookie in the 2014 to date.|$|R
25|$|On January 6, 2010, the anti-whaling ship Ady Gil {{suffered}} {{severe damage}} to its bow after {{a collision with}} the Japanese whaling ship Shōnan Maru No. 2. The Ady Gil was abandoned and left to sink after it had taken on <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>water</b> to be towed. While the first officer of the Bob Barker has said that all the fuel, oil, batteries and other environmental contaminates {{were removed from the}} Ady Gil before towing began, photographic evidence released by the Institute for Cetacean Research showed the wreckage continued to leak fuel into the Southern Ocean after it had been abandoned by Sea Shepherd.|$|E
25|$|Gastric {{dilatation}} volvulus (GDV), {{also known}} as bloat, is the greatest killer of the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog. GDV occurs in deep-chested breeds and requires immediate veterinary care. It {{can be caused by}} wolfing down <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>water,</b> too much food too fast, exercise after eating, stress or unknown conditions. Symptoms are distended abdomen, excessive salivating, depression and lethargy. When GDV occurs it cuts off the esophagus, and blood supply to the heart is lessened causing low blood pressure as well as other cardiac problems; the dog can go into shock. Organ damage can occur as well and the stomach may rupture causing peritonitis to set in. If not treated, the dog may die.|$|E
25|$|The {{causes of}} {{hyponatremia}} are typically classified by a person's body fluid status into low volume, normal volume, or high volume. Low volume hyponatremia can occur from diarrhea, vomiting, diuretics, and sweating. Normal volume hyponatremia {{is divided into}} cases with dilute urine and concentrated urine. Cases in which the urine is dilute include adrenal insufficiency, hypothyroidism, and drinking <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>water</b> or too much beer. Cases in which the urine is concentrated include syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). High volume hyponatremia can occur from heart failure, liver failure, and kidney failure. Conditions {{that can lead to}} falsely low sodium measurements include high blood protein levels such as in multiple myeloma, high blood fat levels, and high blood sugar.|$|E
50|$|Certain {{ratios of}} these {{materials}} will provide beneficial bacteria with the nutrients {{to work at a}} rate that will heat up the pile. In that process <b>much</b> <b>water</b> will be released as vapor ("steam"), and the oxygen will be quickly depleted, explaining the need to actively manage the pile. The hotter the pile gets, the more often added air and water is necessary; the air/water balance is critical to maintaining high temperatures (135°-160° Fahrenheit / 50° - 70° Celsius) until the materials are broken down. At the same time, <b>too</b> <b>much</b> air or <b>water</b> also slows the process, as does <b>too</b> <b>much</b> carbon (or <b>too</b> little nitrogen). Hot container composting focuses on retaining the heat to increase decomposition rate and produce compost more quickly.|$|R
5000|$|According to Dave D'Haeze, a Belgian soil, Vietnamese farmers growing coffee rely on monocultures and use far <b>too</b> <b>much</b> fertilizer, and <b>water,</b> {{and have}} very little {{knowledge}} on farming in general. He mentions that little information/training is available to farmers. According to Will Frith, some climate change models predict 50% of the fields available in Vietnam {{to have a significant}} reduction of yield and/or even fail completely.|$|R
50|$|Potato {{requires}} frequent watering while tubers {{are growing}} to maintain yields. Due to decreasing water availability predicted {{in some areas}} (e.g. much of the United Kingdom), improving irrigation techniques and water capture is necessary to maintain potato crop yields without putting <b>too</b> <b>much</b> stress on <b>water</b> supplies. An example of an irrigation technique aimed at reducing water use which has been trialled on potatoes is Subsurface Drip Irrigation (SDI).|$|R
