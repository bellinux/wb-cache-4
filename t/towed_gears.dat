50|$|Besides the {{established}} trawling fleets, {{a significant number}} of fleets using lobster creels have developed. The better size and condition of lobsters caught by this method yield prices three to four times higher than animals netted by trawling. Creel fishing was found to have a reduced impact on the seafloor, require lower fuel consumption, and allow fishermen with smaller boats to participate in this high-value fishery. It has therefore been described as a reasonable alternative to demersal <b>towed</b> <b>gears,</b> and the allocation of additional fishing rights for this type of take has been suggested.|$|E

40|$|Most {{fisheries}} literature avoids {{speaking about}} ecosystem impacts of fishing, either because impacts are not demonstrated or because a causal relationship between impacts and fishing cannot be formally established with the available information. However, there is mounting evidence that fishing has undesired {{effects in the}} marine ecosystems. This overview examines the wide ecosystem effects of fishing, describing and illustrating the potential unintended effects of the main fisheries of the world. An operational framework for classifying the effects of fishing {{in terms of the}} mechanisms generating the effects is provided. The focus and, to a large extent, the recourse to examples is on those fisheries for which the impacts of fishing have been best studied such as those in the North Atlantic and the Northeast Pacific. Ecosystem effects are divided into direct and indirect: direct effects include the fishing mortality exerted on target populations (overfishing), the fishing mortality sustained by non-target populations (bycatch), and the physical impacts caused by <b>towed</b> <b>gears</b> on benthic organisms and on the seabed. Indirect effects include impacts mediated by biological interactions, the environmental effects of dumping discards and organic detritus (offal), and the mortality caused by lost gear (ghost fishing) Publicado...|$|E

40|$|A {{stratified}} {{sampling programme}} by gear and port {{was carried out}} by observers on board vessels in 2000 to study the discard behaviour of trawler fleets operating off Spanish North Atlantic coasts.

The data were analysed in order to find groups of ports with a similar behaviour and {{to reduce the number of}} strata (30 as a result of the crossing of 10 main ports and 3 types of <b>towed</b> <b>gears).</b> The reduction in the number of strata (from the 30 original strata to the 9 new groups obtained) would mean a high improvement in efficiency for raising purposes, for stock assessment needs and for new Spanish sampling programmes.

40|$|The {{experimental}} {{discipline of}} gear selectivity research {{has a long}} tradition that can be traced back hundreds of years. This note aims at giving a short review of central aspects of size selectivity analysis of data from experiments with towed fishing gears. It is thus not intended as a technical introduction to the analysis. More detailed descriptions can be found elsewhere in the literature. SINGLE HAUL ANALY SES Experiments with towed can be conducted by different methods. The most commonly used are covered codend and paired gear techniques. These are characterized by collecting fish in two compartments one of which is assumed virtually non-selective. The purpose of the non-selective compartment is to collect information about the local abundance of fish that entered the combined gear. With the appearance of more complicated gear with multiple selective devices (e. g. grids or panels) the experimental gears have also developed into more complex designs. The most important advancement in the analysis of single hauls was done by Millar in 1992, when he developed the SELECT method. The method is very general and covers not only all types of size selectivity experiments with <b>towed</b> <b>gears</b> but also experiments with passive gears, i. e. hooks, set-net...|$|E
40|$|Volatile {{fuel prices}} {{are a threat}} to the {{viability}} of UK fishing communities. The economic and social impacts of rising fuel costs for fishers and communities in southwest England are examined. Fuel prices doubled between early 2007 and mid- 2008, whereas fish prices remained relatively stable throughout {{as a result of the}} price-setting power of seafood buyers. It was the fishers who absorbed the increased costs, resulting in significant loss of income, reduced job security, and problems in recruiting crew. All gear types were affected, but fishers using <b>towed</b> <b>gears</b> were most adversely impacted. Fishing vessels with recent investment have greater fuel effi-ciency, so appeared to be more able to cope and to adapt to increased fuel costs. Fishing behaviour also altered as skippers attempted to increase fuel efficiency at the cost of reduced catches. Most skippers reported fishing closer to port, reducing their exploratory fishing, and ceasing experimentation with fishing gears with lesser environmental impact. Therefore, a threat to fishing community viability may have linked environmental effects. The impacts of this fuel price volatility foreshadow a likely future impact of rising fuel prices attributable to climate change adaptation and mitigation and forecasts of rising oil prices. Without proactive planning and policy development, rising fuel prices have the potential to cause job losses and economic hardship additional to problem...|$|E

40|$|Cod, haddock, whiting, saithe, plaice, sole and Norway lobster are 7 main {{target species}} of the {{demersal}} mixed fisheries in the North Sea, Skagerrak and Eastern Channel. Gadoids and Norway lobsters are mainly taken in the nor-thern North Sea by <b>towed</b> <b>gears</b> except beam trawls while the flatfish fisheries are conducted in the southern North Sea mainly using beam trawls. Recently, the central North Sea appears less fished by demersal gears. Towed nets including seines and beam trawls equipped with meshes of more than 100 mm resp. more than 80 mm were identified as the main gears effecting the depleted cod and reduced plaice stocks. The saithe sector, using towed nets with meshes of more than 110 mm, longlines, gill nets and others, appears to affect the 7 species to a lesser extend. These results support the interim effort limitations by gear types, vessel and month as enforced by the European Commission since 2003. TAC regulations alone are considered inefficient to sustainably harvest stocks by mixed fisheries. A fleet-effort management method is developed estimating the fleets’ effects based on the sum of partial exploitation rates of the species in mixed fisheries weighted by {{the ratio of the}} precautionary reference Bpa and the actual SSB size as ecological quality objective.

40|$|A {{comparison}} {{was made}} between catches from deepwater trawl and longline surveys (1993 – 2000) in the Northeast Atlantic. Longline catches {{were dominated by}} elasmobranchs, particularly squalid sharks and species numbers were low. Trawl catches had higher species numbers, with more teleosts, though elasmobranchs were still an important component. Species composition of the catch was depth dependent. Comparative trawl and longline surveys of the eastern and southern slopes of the Rockall Trough (west and north of Ireland) were used to examine size-selectivity. Trawls and longlines selected for significantly different size frequency distributions of Centroscymnus coelolepis and Deania calceus, though not for Centrophorus squamosus. These data highlight some important aspects of behavior of the species studying relation to fishing gears. Smaller C. coelolepis were selected by longlines than trawls, suggesting that smaller sharks were present at a considerable height above the seabed, {{out of reach of}} trawls, but attracted to baited hooks. In the case of D. calceus, larger females were selected by hooks, but were not present in trawl catches, possibly indicating their ability to escape <b>towed</b> <b>gears.</b> Trawl selectivity ogives were constructed for D. calceus and ogives for C. coelolepis and C. squamosus were simulated, using available data. Results suggest that longlines are not as selective for C. coelolepis as trawls. Selectivity ogives for D. calceus were similar in form, but longlines selected bigger individuals. Life history studies suggest that these species cannot sustain high fishing pressures. The implications of these results for the management of fisheries taking elasmobranchs are discussed...|$|E

40|$|There {{is growing}} {{emphasis}} on monitoring biodiversity in European waters not least {{due to the}} EC’s recent Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) listing biodiversity as one descriptor of ‘Good Environmental Status’ (GES). Member States already have various monitoring surveys in place, in particular groundfish and other fisheries surveys, which may provide a cost-effective way of assessing some elements of biodiversity. The MSFD recognises the “need to ensure, as far as possible, compatibility with existing programmes”. Although existing field surveys are a potential source of quantitative data for examining spatial and temporal biodiversity patterns, it must be acknowledged that such surveys were often not originally designed to monitor ‘biodiversity’, and long-term surveys may have had changes in survey design at some point, and/or subtle changes in survey protocols over time. Field surveys for infauna and plankton typically collect and preserve samples at sea, and subsequent laboratory work includes the use of reference collections, quality assurance and longer-term sample storage. Surveys with <b>towed</b> <b>gears</b> can collect large amounts of complex biological material which is typically processed at sea, and so different forms of quality assurance are required.

40|$|Fishing with {{demersal}} <b>towed</b> <b>gears</b> {{can have}} dramatic {{effects on the}} structure and functioning of marine ecosystems. We studied the ecosystem effects of the deep-sea red shrimp Aristaeomorpha foliacea trawl fishery (500 to 800 m) in the Strait of Sicily, at the population and community level by sampling in trawled and non-trawled sites as determined by vessel monitoring system (VMS) fishing effort data. The study was conducted within the Maltese 25 nautical mile Fisheries Management Zone {{as part of the}} ongoing MEDITS trawl survey. Samples were collected using an experimental otter trawl net with a cod-end stretched mesh size of 20 mm, from 7 stations located in trawled sites (mean depth 616 ± 26 m) and from 7 stations in non-trawled sites (mean depth 556 ± 40 m). Population and community indicators were compared across the trawled and non-trawled sites. Populations of A. foliacea and Etmopterus spinax did not show any differences in biomass between the trawled and non-trawled sites, whereas the biomass of Plesionika martia, Nephrops norvegicus, Helicolenus dactylopterus dactylopterus and Galeus melastomus was 4 times, 16 times, 6 times and 2 times higher, respectively, at the non-trawled sites. Changes in length structure were also detected for all species except for E. spinax. At the community level, higher biomass, density and diversity indices were recorded at the non-trawled sites. Despite the clear evidence of ecosystem changes due to fishing, the main target species, A. foliacea and P. martia, had a high resilience to trawling activities. Setting up trawling lanes as a management option would likely minimise negative impacts on species with slow growth rates and low resilience. peer-reviewe...|$|E

This nominal mesh size gives room for n j = 0. 1 catch of juveniles, which not exceeds the allowable proportion [n j] = 0. 1.

40|$|Baltic Sea Benthic {{ecosystem}} impacts from demersal {{fishery in}} the western Baltic is assumed to come mainly from Nephrops trawling in the central and southern Kattegat, mussel dredging in the Belt Sea, and mixed cod trawling {{in the western}} Baltic Sea. These fisheries both impact the seabed, as well as produce substantial amounts of discards. The western Baltic Sea offer {{a unique opportunity to}} analyse the benthic effects of fishingthanks to the closure of Øresund to <b>towed</b> <b>gears</b> since the 1920 s, and the introduction of the Kattegat MPA in 2009 (including cod closure) and the western Baltic Sea Natura- 2000 areas. Furthermore an extensive benthic nationalmonitoring and data collection effort has taken place in the area over a number of years, which can be usedto investigate spatial and temporal differences in the development of benthic communities in (chronically) towed and non-towed areas. To evaluate benthic impacts of <b>towed</b> <b>gears</b> in the Baltic Sea a number of gear technological innovations to reduce effort, benthic contact of fishing gears, and discarding are evaluated. There are conducted experimental fisheries in relation to evaluation and comparison of direct ecosystem and habitat impacts, catch efficiency (target/by-catch/discard/invertebrates), selectivity (discard), energy efficiency, and economic efficiency (vessel specific cost-efficiency/cost-benefit analyses) of different gear modifications compared to standard gears. Furthermore, the case study evaluates potential fishing closures directed towards sensitive benthic habitats and communities. A review of known regional benthic impacts of fishery with demersal <b>towed</b> <b>gears</b> in the area is evaluated with focus on the mussel dredging, demersal cod trawl fishery and Nephrops trawl fishery, where latter is also compared to Nephrops creel fishery. Subtidal dredging and benthic trawling in the area has been reported to affect the benthic fauna and flora as well as to change the structure of the sea bed. The impact of <b>towed</b> <b>gears</b> may also reduce substrate complexity owing to by-catch and movement of shells and stones. Among other this has been demonstrated to locally reduce survival of juvenile blue mussels as well as the population structure of sessile epibenthic organisms. Benthic towing also potentially impact on water transparency either directly owing to resuspension of sediment or {{as a result of a}} reduction in the filtering biomasser. Resuspension is induced at the bottom and in the water column during towing and at the surface when by-catch of sediment is released when heaving/washing the catch. Besides reducing transparency, resuspension of sediment has been found to increase levels of ammonia and silicate in the water column and to reduce the oxygen content. The innovations evaluated comprise: A) Lighter mussel dredges with less benthic impact; B) Smart mussel and cod fishery with previous acoustic or video monitoring or test fishery on the resources before fishery to optimize the catch and to reduce total effort as well as effort on more sensitive habitats resulting in reduced benthic impact; C) Semi-pelagic doors and alternative gear riggings to lift the doors off the seafloor in the western Baltic trawl mixed cod trawl fishery. For species like cod and plaice, which are herded by the sweeps/bridles, an off-bottom door rigging where these other gear components are on the bottom, may be a solution to maintain catchability and eliminate the seabed impact of the doors. The technical challenge with such rigging is to keep the trawl door distance above bottom nearly constant. D) Another focus is scenario evaluation of different effort (re-) allocation schemes with respect to benthic impacts and catch efficiency of W. Baltic mixed trawl fishery by reduction of overall effort or effort in more sensitive habitats through potential closures. The evaluation use the DISPLACE spatial explicit bio-ecomic model (Bastardie et al. 2013; 2014). E) Use short sweep lengths to reduce benthic impacts in the Nephrops trawl fishery (standard of 74 m compared to 5 - 10 m sweeps). Shorter sweeps are not expected to change the selectivity and catch of Nephrops, because Nephrops are not herded by the sweeps, while fish by-catch and discard is expected to be reduced because of less herding. Benthic impacts of demersal trawl fishing in an open fishing area, a short-term closed area, and a long term closed area in the Kattegat and the Sound is investigated. F) Evaluate benthic impacts of creels to be compared to benthic impacts of the Nephrops-fish mixed trawl fishery through overlapping fishery, creel fishery on soft bottom, and test attachment points of creels and inside creel shelters. The comparative analysis of all the above points of changed fishing methods with less benthic impact will involve comparative analyses of catchefficiency, benthic impacts, cost benefit (CBA), energy efficiency, and by-catch and discard. Pilot investigations on use of a light mussel dredge indicate that: a) the weight of sediment retained and re-reduction in energy transfer to the sediment, c) catch efficiency tend to increase – reducing effort and area of impact and reducing fuel consumption - and accordingly increasing economic efficiency, and d) Sea floor tracks made by the two dredges could be distinguished by use of a side-scan sonar and the tracks were still detectable two months after fishing. Pilot investigations in relation to use of semi-pelagic trawl doors indicate similar catch rates between door settings, however, there are area and seasonal differences in the catch efficiency when using pelagic doors, possibly due to substrate or seasonal related behavior differences of cod in reaction to the gears. Pilot investigations with evaluation of mixed trawl fishery impact on W. Baltic and Kattegat sensitive habitats with respect to effort pressure is presented here and will be made finally reported under WP 2 when the actual impact of the specific gear is known. Pilot investigations of bio-diversity and presence/absence of species from benthic sampling in open and short term closed trawl fishing areas in Kattegat is ongoing. Pilot investigations with creels in (Frandsen et al. 2013 b) indicate that i) the creels sank very much down into the soft sediment (camera monitoring); ii) the creels were not directly lifted off the bottom but were dragged for several minutes making a footage (camera monitoring); iii) the bait attracted Hagfish (Myxine spp.) which scared the Nephrops in the creels => some escapement; iv) all by-catch thrown overboard immediately went to the bottom, and no predation from sea birds was observed, and there were observed no visible deviations in the cod's behaviour when they swam to the bottom; v) the catch rates were about 180 g/creel per day; vi) CBA indicate a daily profit about 3800 DKK per day which is comparable to trawl fishery for trawlers 18 m (12 - 17 m) and < 18 m (18 - 32 m) which are common for Black Sea trawl fishery fleet. In each sampling period, the catches were recorded on board from at least two commercial vessels representing the study area. Fieldwork included estimating the total catch and the relative fractions per haul and recording the faunal composition as standardized for per haul duration or per day. The sediment samplings were taken from totally 40 stations and particle size analysis were realized. The stations for sediment sampling were assigned as on a vertical line to land at certain distances from each other and at four different depths. The data derived from PSA (Particle Size Analysis) and also the information of coordinates applied to the ArcMap Sediment Classification Tool (ArcGIS ver 9. 2) to derive the habitat map of the substrate in SSA. The abundance of macro benthic fauna is greater in summer months than in winter, spring and fall. The fishing mortality is increasing in this period. 70. 3 % of total catch is composed of Rapa whelk and 29. 7 % is the bycatch species. The reasons for the heavy pressure on red mullet and whiting populations were the low selectivity of meshes and the long operation durations. The high exploitation rate generally causes the catch of relatively small and immature individuals. Though the rate of discarded catch in weight is lower than the marketed catch, as it is considered in number of individual the discarded portion is larger than the market. The age composition of red mullet was composed of 0 and 1 age groups and of whiting are 0, 1 and 2 age groups. In the whiting fishery of the 2013 and 2014, the mean values of fishing effort are found to have no significant difference between seasons for the landing. The highest CPUE for the landing and discard is estimated in fall and the lowest in spring but the difference is not statistically significant. In red mullet fishery for the same years, the trend seems similar within the whiting fishery. The mean values of fishing effort in red mullet are also not significantly different between seasons for the landing. The highest CPUE for the landing and discard is determined in winter and the lowest in spring with no statistical difference. Though the rate of discard by weight seems less than of landings, the rate of discard by individual number is significantly high and cause great bio-economic losses. SSA can be accepted as a soft bottom habitat that is mostly composed of muddy sand and sandy mud. Stations having hard substratum is very limited. This soft bottom is highly available for all kind of drag-net fisheries and this makes this habitat highly sensitive because of heavy fishing pressure...|$|E

On 20 September 1967 she escorted the disabled Danish M/V Marieskou following a collision with the Chitose Maru four miles north of Cape Flattery. Modoc was reclassified as a Medium Endurance Cutter, WMEC-194, in 1968. She and her sister Comanche (WMEC-202) were the smallest cutters designated as WMEC. On 17 March 1968 she assisted USS Chowanoc (ATF-100) recover her tow of DE-373 25 miles west of Coos Bay.|$|R
40|$|When {{drafting}} {{a new model}} of a towed technical system for fisheries (trawl, <b>towed</b> TV <b>gear</b> or similar), and also when measuring an existing and already tested system {{it is not easy to}} foresee of practical behaviour, which depends of various parameters. The measuring programme for recording all data needs a lot of time and money, and also has some limitations. Therefore we developed for such systems mathematical-physical models, which allow a complex calculation. Their real value, however, results only from practical verification. During the cruise no. 222 of “Walther Herwig III” in November 2000 comparative investigations for 2 concrete systems were carried out. This was done in cooperation with the University in Rostock, where such models are being developed and computerized. One of the systems mesasured was a pelagic herring trawl and the other one the <b>towed</b> TV <b>gear</b> for underwater observations of the Institute for Fishery Technology and Fish Quality. The correspondence between model calculation and measurements was very high for both systems...|$|R
40|$|The Latitudinal Gradient Program (2002 – 2011) {{aimed at}} {{understanding}} the marine and terrestrial ecosystems existing along the Victoria Land coast (Ross Sea), an area characterized by strong latitudinal clines in environmental factors. During the program’s voyage of the Italian RV ‘‘Italica’’ in 2004, a fine-mesh <b>towed</b> <b>gear,</b> the ‘‘Rauschert dredge’’, was deployed {{for the first}} time at 18 stations in four latitudinal distinct shelf areas between * 71 S and * 74 S. The collected samples contained undescribed species and new records for the Ross Sea from a variety of different marine taxa. Here, we describe the molluscan fauna and investigate evidences for latitudinal effects on molluscan diversity, abundance and assemblage composition. No significant latitudinal trends were detected: while diversity did not vary significantly with latitude, species richness showed an apparent but non-significant decrease with increasing latitude. Beta-diversity was found to be high both within and between latitudinally distinct shelf areas. A large fraction (* 20...|$|R

This gave the navy an inexpensive ship to clear mines from its harbors in case of a war with NATO and the West.
