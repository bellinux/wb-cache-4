This is {{consistent}} with studies suggesting an inverse relation between the cooling rate and face width <b>of</b> <b>the</b> columns (Goehring et al., 2009; Grossenbacher and McDuffie, 1995). For example, if <b>the</b> ratio <b>of</b> <b>the</b> face widths <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper to lower colonnades is 4 : 6, <b>the</b> ratio <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>extents</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper to lower colonnades becomes 6 : 4. <b>The</b> ratio <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mean face widths <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper (1.3  m) and lower (2.9  m) colonnades is approximately 3 : 7, which {{is comparable to the}} ratio (6 : 4) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>extents</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper and lower colonnades (i.e., 150  m from ~ 950 to ~ 1100 masl; 100  m from ~ 850 to ~ 950 masl). <b>The</b> <b>extents</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper and lower colonnades are also consistent with the ratio (6 : 4) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper to lower colonnades from the numerical modeling. This finding indicates that <b>the</b> group <b>of</b> columnar joints of colonnades from 850 to 1100 masl in Mt. Mudeung may result from cooling of a single tuff emplacement, divided into upper and lower colonnades corresponding to the Seoseok-dae/Ipseok-dae and Gwangseok-dae colonnades, respectively. It also indicates that water infiltration along the columnar joints accelerated <b>the</b> propagation rate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> columnar jointing, resulting in <b>the</b> larger <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper colonnade compared with the lower colonnade, as evidenced by the relatively constant face widths <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper (Seoseok-dae and Ipseok-dae) and lower (Gwangseok-dae) colonnades.|$|R
5|$|After {{the assault}} on his deputies, El Paso County Sheriff M.F.

Waite, a 67-year-old Populist, dispatched 300 troops to the area on March 18 under the command of Adjutant General T.J. Tarsney. Tarsney found the area tense but quiet. Union president Calderwood assured him that union members would cooperate with his operations, even surrendering for arrest if requested. Convinced that Bowers had exaggerated <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chaos in the region, Tarsney recommended the withdrawal of troops; Waite concurred. The state militia left Cripple Creek on March 20.|$|E
5|$|After the explosion, Bennington was refloated and towed to the Mare Island Navy Yard. Because of <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{damages and}} the age of the ship, Bennington was not {{repaired}} but was instead decommissioned on 31 October 1905. After five years of inactivity, Bennington was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 10 September 1910 and sold for scrap on 14 November. Bennington was not scrapped but was purchased in 1913 by the Matson Line for use as a molasses barge. She was towed to Honolulu and remained in use there from 1913 until 1924, when she was scuttled off Oahu.|$|E

A third deceptive force, Operation Big Drum, would use radar countermeasures on the western flank of the true invasion fleet.

The writers Katharine Briggs and Patricia Monaghan {{on the other hand}} consider the creature's range to be the broader Scottish Highlands, although Briggs does sometimes specify Argyllshire. Campbell of Islay's undated manuscript notes the boobrie had not been seen for several years probably due to the widespread burning of heather in the area of its habitat.|$|E
