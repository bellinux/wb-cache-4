50|$|Several {{years after}} the events of 1990: The Bronx Warriors, <b>Trash</b> (<b>Mark</b> Gregory), former leader of the Riders gang is now a cynical loner, {{remaining}} in the impoverished, lawless wasteland of the Bronx and trading in stolen ammunition.|$|R
50|$|Attacked by {{a roller}} skating gang called The Zombies, Anne is saved {{by members of}} The Riders, and taken under the {{protection}} of The Riders’ leader <b>Trash</b> (<b>Mark</b> Gregory). The Manhattan Corporation hires a ruthless and psychopathic mercenary named Hammer (Vic Morrow), who turns the various Bronx gangs against each other to ensure Anne is returned.|$|R

5000|$|FAIR {{seems to}} be accusing us of {{covering}} {{the people who make}} decisions that affect people's lives, many of whom work in government, the military, or corporate America. That's what we do: we're a news program, and that's who makes news... I take issue with the way the FAIR report characterizes each guest, which they have obviously done very subjectively. Witness the <b>trashing</b> of <b>Mark</b> Shields and Tom Oliphant (in the full report), who are not liberal enough for FAIR's taste. When you get down to arguing about degrees of left-and-rightness, I think you undermine your own argument.|$|R
5000|$|From {{at least}} the 1950s until 2008, the island {{received}} mail service via a private ferry, which delivered mail to the island by leaving it [...] "in a specially <b>marked</b> <b>trash</b> can on the dock for recipients to pick up." [...] The U.S. Postal Service ended the practice in 2008 due to security concerns; residents of the island now must journey by boat to the Northeast Harbor post office, to retrieve their mail.|$|R
50|$|On August 9, on {{what would}} have been Drew's first game in Philadelphia, he sat out, citing a bruised right hand. In an attempt to confuse the Philadelphia fans, he did not wear his own jersey that night, which instead was worn by bullpen catcher, Jeff Murphy. The attempt failed, however, and he was booed and heckled {{throughout}} batting practice. The only time he received cheers was when he booted three consecutive grounders in the outfield while his teammates were taking batting practice. On August 10, , in Drew's first game at Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia, he was booed loudly, and even had batteries thrown at him by two fans. The Phillie Phanatic got into the act, dropping two large <b>trash</b> bags <b>marked</b> with dollar signs in the outfield between innings. Drew struggled to stay healthy, landing on the disabled list every season he played in St. Louis.|$|R
50|$|By {{adding a}} new {{treasure}} to Isla del Coco the regulations restricting human access to this protected area (on ecological grounds) are highlighted. The project challenges these regulations: In order for the exhibition to be experienced in real life (by the map holder or other ‘treasure’ seekers) access must be had. This will only be possible if the protection laws are abolished or if their enforcement fails. The recovery of the buried treasure (<b>trash?)</b> will then <b>mark</b> the loss of greater (natural) bounty. Perhaps this project represents an attempt to bury our hubris.|$|R
50|$|After {{it emerges}} Steph is {{pregnant}} with Dan's child, Lucas and Libby have a one-night stand. Lucas later tells Steph he still loves her. During Steph's trial for culpable driving, Lucas asks her {{to run away}} with him, but she turns him down and is sent to prison. Lucas takes part in illegal street racing organised by Garland Cole (Jack Finsterer). Garland orders Lucas to throw a race and lose, but Lucas does not listen and Garland has him beaten up and Number 24 <b>trashed.</b> Detective <b>Mark</b> Brennan (Scott McGregor) goes undercover at the races and asks Lucas {{to help him get}} Garland. Garland asks Lucas to rebirth a car and when he comes to pick it up, Mark has him arrested. Lucas supports Sonya after she admits she is Callum Jones' (Morgan Baker) mother and Toadie throws her out. Lucas manages to convince Toadie that Sonya loves him. Lucas's father dies and he questions going to the funeral, as he did not respect his father. Lawyer Peter Noonan (James Saunders) tells Lucas that his father left him some money and his ashes, which Lucas scatters over a football field.|$|R
40|$|There {{is concern}} that cotton gins {{may serve as}} loci for {{reintroduction}} of boll weevils, Anthonomus grandis grandis Boheman, to eradicated or suppressed zones when processing weevil infested cotton from neighboring zones. Previous work has shown that virtually all weevils entering the gin in the seed cotton will be removed {{before they reach the}} gin stand. Those not killed by the seed cotton cleaning machinery will be shunted alive into the trash fraction, which passes through a centrifugal trash fan before exiting the gin. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine survival potential of boll weevils passed through a <b>trash</b> fan. <b>Marked</b> adult weevils were distributed in gin trash and fed through a 82. 6 -cm (32. 5 -in.) diameter centrifugal fan operated across a range of fan-tip speeds. A small number of boll weevils were recovered alive immediately after passage through the fan, but all were severely injured and did not survive 24 h. In another experiment, green bolls infested with both adult- and larval-stage weevils were fed through the fan. Several teneral adults survived 24 h, and there was no evidence that fan-tip speed affected either initial survival of weevils, or the number of unbroken boll locks that could harbor an infesting weevil. Thus, designating a minimum fan-tip speed for ensuring complete kill is not possible for the boll weevil. Experiments suggest that a device installed in a gin that partially crushes or cracks bolls open before entering a trash fan will increase mortality, possibly enough that further precautions would be unnecessary...|$|R
