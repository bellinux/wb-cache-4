5|$|As atomic nuclei are fused in <b>the</b> <b>core,</b> they emit {{energy in}} the form of gamma rays. These photons {{interact}} with the surrounding plasma, adding to the thermal energy at <b>the</b> <b>core.</b> Stars on the main sequence convert hydrogen into helium, creating a slowly but steadily increasing proportion of helium in <b>the</b> <b>core.</b> Eventually the helium content becomes predominant, and energy production ceases at <b>the</b> <b>core.</b> Instead, for stars of more than 0.4 , fusion occurs in a slowly expanding shell around the degenerate helium core.|$|E
5|$|Astronomers {{characterize}} the morphology of a globular cluster {{by means of}} standard radii. These are <b>the</b> <b>core</b> radius (r'c), the half-light radius (r'h), and the tidal (or Jacobi) radius (r't). The overall luminosity of the cluster steadily decreases with distance from <b>the</b> <b>core,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>core</b> radius is the distance at which the apparent surface luminosity has dropped by half. A comparable quantity is the half-light radius, or the distance from <b>the</b> <b>core</b> within which half the total luminosity from the cluster is received. This is typically larger than <b>the</b> <b>core</b> radius.|$|E
5|$|At present, {{nearly half}} the {{hydrogen}} at <b>the</b> <b>core</b> has been consumed, with {{the remainder of the}} atoms consisting primarily of helium. As the number of hydrogen atoms per unit mass decreases, so too does their energy output provided through nuclear fusion. This results in a decrease in pressure support, which causes <b>the</b> <b>core</b> to contract until the increased density and temperature bring <b>the</b> <b>core</b> pressure into equilibrium with the layers above. The higher temperature causes the remaining hydrogen to undergo fusion at a more rapid rate, thereby generating the energy needed to maintain the equilibrium.|$|E

5|$|Core-collapse {{is thought}} to occur when the more massive stars in a {{globular}} cluster encounter their less massive companions. Over time, dynamic processes cause individual stars to migrate {{from the center of}} the cluster to the outside. This results in a net loss of kinetic energy from <b>the</b> <b>core</b> region, leading the remaining stars grouped in <b>the</b> <b>core</b> region to occupy a more compact volume. When this gravothermal instability occurs, the central region of the cluster becomes densely crowded with stars and the surface brightness of the cluster forms a power-law cusp. (Note that a core collapse is not the only mechanism that can cause such a luminosity distribution; a massive black hole at <b>the</b> <b>core</b> can also result in a luminosity cusp.) Over a lengthy period of time this leads to a concentration of massive stars near <b>the</b> <b>core,</b> a phenomenon called mass segregation.|$|E

5|$|Most of {{the energy}} {{produced}} at Vega's core is generated by the carbonnitrogenoxygen cycle (CNO cycle), a nuclear fusion process that combines protons to form helium nuclei through intermediary nuclei of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. This process requires a temperature of about 15millionK, which is higher than <b>the</b> <b>core</b> temperature of the Sun, but is less efficient than the Sun's proton-proton chain reaction fusion reaction. The CNO cycle is highly temperature sensitive, which results in a convection zone about <b>the</b> <b>core</b> that evenly distributes the 'ash' from the fusion reaction within <b>the</b> <b>core</b> region. The overlying atmosphere is in radiative equilibrium. This {{is in contrast to}} the Sun, which has a radiation zone centered on <b>the</b> <b>core</b> with an overlying convection zone.|$|E
5|$|Only {{the most}} highly skilled Chacoans shaped and set stone; others carried {{supplies}} and mixed mortar. The width of a given wall was determined by its place in a structure. The first story of a two-story wall is always wider than the second. Chacoan walls are often called core-and-veneer, but only the widest walls had cores. The Chacoans tried to build walls with two flush faces, but because the stones were typically quite small, to build a wider wall they built up a space between the two faces; this spacing is often called <b>the</b> <b>core.</b> In most walls, <b>the</b> <b>core</b> consisted of roughly shaped stone or rubble laid {{at the same time}} as the two faces. In others, the faces were built up independently, and <b>the</b> <b>core</b> packed between them. Chacoan walls derive their stability from the degree of contact between stones in the faces and the width of the wall itself, not from the strength of <b>the</b> <b>core.</b>|$|E

5|$|Stars {{far more}} massive than the sun evolve in more complex ways. In <b>the</b> <b>core</b> of the star, {{hydrogen}} is fused into helium, releasing thermal energy that heats the sun's core and provides outward pressure {{that supports the}} sun's layers against collapse in {{a process known as}} stellar or hydrostatic equilibrium. The helium produced in <b>the</b> <b>core</b> accumulates there since temperatures in <b>the</b> <b>core</b> are not yet high enough to cause it to fuse. Eventually, as the hydrogen at <b>the</b> <b>core</b> is exhausted, fusion starts to slow down, and gravity causes <b>the</b> <b>core</b> to contract. This contraction raises the temperature high enough to initiate a shorter phase of helium fusion, which accounts for less than 10% of the star's total lifetime. In stars with fewer than eight solar masses, the carbon produced by helium fusion does not fuse, and the star gradually cools to become a white dwarf. White dwarf stars, if they have a near companion, may then become Type Ia supernovae.|$|E

40|$|Mangroves are an unique {{habitat and}} are largely {{influenced}} by sea level changes and wave energy. Foraminifera (Protista) preserved in mangrove sediments provide an excellent proxy for deducing past conditions.

50|$|Growth of <b>the</b> inner <b>core</b> {{is thought}} to play an {{important}} role in the generation of Earth's magnetic field by dynamo action in <b>the</b> liquid outer <b>core.</b> This occurs mostly because it cannot dissolve the same amount of light elements as <b>the</b> outer <b>core</b> and therefore freezing at <b>the</b> inner <b>core</b> boundary produces a residual liquid that contains more light elements than the overlying liquid. This causes it to become buoyant and helps drive convection of <b>the</b> outer <b>core.</b> <b>The</b> existence of <b>the</b> inner <b>core</b> also changes <b>the</b> dynamic motions of liquid in <b>the</b> outer <b>core</b> as it grows and may help fix the magnetic field since it is expected to be a great deal more resistant to flow than <b>the</b> outer <b>core</b> liquid (which is expected to be turbulent).|$|R
5|$|The {{different}} stages of core-collapse may be divided into three phases. During a globular cluster's adolescence, the process of core-collapse begins with stars near <b>the</b> <b>core.</b> However, the interactions between binary star systems prevents further collapse as the cluster approaches middle age. Finally, the central binaries are either disrupted or ejected, resulting in a tighter concentration at <b>the</b> <b>core.</b>|$|E
5|$|The fusion rate in <b>the</b> <b>core</b> is in a self-correcting equilibrium: a {{slightly}} higher rate of fusion would cause <b>the</b> <b>core</b> to heat up more and expand slightly against {{the weight of the}} outer layers, reducing the density and hence the fusion rate and correcting the perturbation; and {{a slightly}} lower rate would cause <b>the</b> <b>core</b> to cool and shrink slightly, increasing the density and increasing the fusion rate and again reverting it to its present rate.|$|E
5|$|The {{hydrogen}} fusion {{process is}} temperature-sensitive, so a moderate increase in <b>the</b> <b>core</b> temperature {{will result in}} {{a significant increase in the}} fusion rate.
