50|$|An element {{management}} system manages {{one or more}} of a specific type of telecommunications network element. Typically, the EMS manages the functions and capabilities within each NE but does not manage the traffic between different NEs in the network. To support management of the traffic between itself and other NEs, the EMS communicates upward to higher-level network {{management system}}s (NMS) as described in the <b>telecommunications</b> <b>management</b> <b>network</b> layered model. The EMS provides the foundation to implement TMN-layered operations support system (OSS) architectures that enable service providers to meet customer needs for rapid deployment of new services, as well as meeting stringent quality of service (QoS) requirements. The TeleManagement Forum common object request broker architecture (CORBA) EMS-to-NMS interface heralds a new era in OSS interoperability by making the TMN architecture a practical reality.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1980s the term FCAPS was {{introduced}} {{within the first}} Working Drafts (N1719) of ISO 10040, the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Systems Management Overview (SMO) standard.

Since initial experiences showed that these protocols would become very similar, the ISO working group responsible {{for the development of}} these protocols (ISO/TC97/SC16/WG4, later renamed into ISO-IEC/JTC1/SC21/WG4) decided to create a single protocol for all five areas instead. This protocol is called common management information protocol (CMIP). In the 1990s the ITU-T, as part of their work on <b>Telecommunications</b> <b>Management</b> <b>Network</b> (TMN), further refined the FCAPS as part of the TMN recommendation on Management Functions (M.3400). The idea of FCAPS turned out to be very useful for teaching network management functions; most textbooks therefore start with a section that explains the FCAPS.|$|E
