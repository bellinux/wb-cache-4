The paper also raised the suggestion {{that the majority of the}} submarines be constructed in Australia and that the number of submarines be increased beyond the six Oberons. Building the submarines in Australia was initially met with reactions predicting an impossible task because of the poor state of the Australian shipbuilding industry, and Australian industry in general, although campaigning by several figures in Australian industry who thought it could be done came to the attention of those spearheading the project to design the Oberon-class replacement, and led to the view that it was both possible and feasible. The campaign to build submarines in Australia was also met with support from the Australian Labor Party and several trade unions.|$|E

5000|$|The whole object {{assumption}} leads {{children to}} constraining labels to an entire object, but children must also learn labels for characteristics {{or parts of}} an object. To override the whole object assumption, children also utilize the mutual exclusivity assumption. Simply put, the mutual exclusivity assumption suggests that every object only has one name. Children resist assigning a label to an object for which they already have a name or at least will not learn the new name as easily. Children are then able <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>considering</b> other possibilities for the new label, for instance, {{a part of the}} object. For example, an adult presents a child with two objects, a truck and a novel object. The adult asks the child to pick up the blicket. If the child already knows [...] "truck" [...] but has not heard [...] "blicket" [...] as a label for an object, the child will assume this label maps onto the novel object.|$|E

While maintaining a joyful demeanor, playing on his guitar and cheering his colleagues with his jokes, he began to find that the work he was doing to help the poor was starting to bring him into conflict with the government then in power in Argentina. This was drawing him into a close collaboration with a small community of Little Brothers of the Gospel, a semi-contemplative religious order dedicated to sharing the lives of the poorest of the earth. His collaboration with Little Brother Patrick Rice, a native of Ireland, led him <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>considering</b> a transfer from the Capuchins to that congregation. To support himself, as well as sharing in the daily life of a working person, he started driving a taxi. He was also in close touch with the Movement of Priests for the Third World.

[...] Danah Boyd expresses a future issue which the government may have to deal with in her research: Facebook is becoming an international social media website, specifically prevalent in Canada and Europe which are [...] "two regions that love to regulate their utilities."

50|$|African American southerners were {{motivated}} to move based on economic concerns. The economic deprivation suffered by southern African Americans {{prior to the}} great migration has been well documented. Plantation agriculture such as sharecropping limited African Americans to gain and work up the “agricultural ladder”. The agricultural ladder was {{a system in which}} a worker's status determined their position, not how skilled or valuable they were. Because of segregation, African American men were placed in unskilled jobs and women were placed in domestic services. These conditions had little to no change from {{the early decades of the}} twentieth century, which was a powerful incentive for African American southerners to leave and go look for opportunity elsewhere. African Americans strove to find new opportunities such as finding better ways to earn a living to support their families. Moving to the north was a way to improve their economic fortunes. World War I and new immigration policies forced northern employers <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>considering</b> southern African Americans and whites as a cheap labor force to replace the costly European workers. Other social factors such as education opportunities, political disenfranchisement, and racial violence also drove migration. The great migration was a complex process driven by a large and diverse set of forces.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{outcome of}} the Teller meeting was to prompt John Nuckolls <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>considering</b> {{what happens when the}} fusion side of the bomb, the [...] "secondary," [...] was scaled down to very small size. His {{earliest}} work concerned the study of how small a fusion bomb could be made while still having a large [...] "gain" [...] to provide net energy output. This work suggested that at very small sizes, on the order of milligrams, very little energy would be needed to ignite it, much less than a fission [...] "primary". He proposed building, in effect, tiny all-fusion explosives using a tiny drop of D-T fuel suspended {{in the center of a}} metal shell, today known as a hohlraum. The shell provided the same effect as the bomb casing in an H-bomb, trapping x-rays inside so they irradiated the fuel. The main difference is that the x-rays would not be supplied by a primary within the shell, but some sort of external device that heated the shell from the outside until it was glowing in the x-ray region (see thermal radiation). The power would be delivered by a then-unidentified pulsed power source he referred to using bomb terminology, the [...] "primary".|$|E
5000|$|Each {{block is}} then {{considered}} in more detail, still at an abstract stage, {{but with a}} lot more focus on the details of the electrical functions to be provided. At this or later stages it is common to require a large amount of research or mathematical modeling into what is and is not feasible to achieve. [...] The results of this research may be fed back into earlier stages of the design process, for example if it turns out one of the blocks cannot be designed within the parameters set for it, {{it may be necessary to}} alter other blocks instead. At this point it is also common <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>considering</b> both how to demonstrate that the design does meet the specifications, and how it is to be tested ( [...] which can include self diagnostic tools [...] ).Finally the individual circuit components are chosen to carry out each function in the overall design, at this stage the physical layout and electrical connections of each component are also decided, this layout commonly taking the form of artwork for the production of a printed circuit board or Integrated circuit. This stage is typically extremely time consuming because of the vast array of choices available. A practical constraint on the design at this stage is that of standardization, while a certain value of component may be calculated for use in some location in a circuit, if that value cannot be purchased from a supplier, then the problem has still not been solved. To avoid this a certain amount of 'catalog engineering' can be applied to solve the more mundane tasks within an overall design.|$|E
