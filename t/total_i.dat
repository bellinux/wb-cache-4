2500|$|There are, however, {{components}} of electrical circuits {{which do not}} obey Ohm's law; that is, their relationship between current and voltage (their I–V curve) is nonlinear (or non-ohmic). [...] An example is the p-n junction diode (curve at right). [...] As seen in the figure, the current does not increase linearly with applied voltage for a diode. [...] One can determine a value of current (I) for a given value of applied voltage (V) from the curve, but not from Ohm's law, since the value of [...] "resistance" [...] is not constant {{as a function of}} applied voltage. [...] Further, the current only increases significantly if the applied voltage is positive, not negative. [...] The ratio V/I for some point along the nonlinear curve is sometimes called the static, or chordal, or DC, resistance, but as seen in the figure the value of total V over <b>total</b> <b>I</b> varies depending on the particular point along the nonlinear curve which is chosen. [...] This means the [...] "DC resistance" [...] V/I at some point on the curve {{is not the same as}} what would be determined by applying an AC signal having peak amplitude ΔV volts or ΔI amps centered at that same point along the curve and measuring ΔV/ΔI. However, in some diode applications, the AC signal applied to the device is small and it is possible to analyze the circuit in terms of the dynamic, small-signal, or incremental resistance, defined as the one over the slope of the V–I curve at the average value (DC operating point) of the voltage (that is, one over the derivative of current with respect to voltage). [...] For sufficiently small signals, the dynamic resistance allows the Ohm's law small signal resistance to be calculated as approximately one over the slope of a line drawn tangentially to the V-I curve at the DC operating point.|$|E

60|$|Strehlen is a {{pleasant}} little Town, nestled prettily among its granite Hills, the steeple of it visible from Mollwitz; some twenty-five {{miles west of}} Brieg, some thirty south of Breslau, and about as far northwest of Neisse: there Friedrich and his Prussians lie, under canvas mainly, with outposts and detachments sprinkled about under roofs:--a Camp of Strehlen, more or less imaginable by the reader. And worth his imagining; such a Camp, if not for soldiering, yet for negotiating and wagging of diplomatic wigs, as there never was before.

6000|$|... "They've got him for life!" [...] I said {{to myself}} that evening {{on my way back}} to the station; but later on, alone in the {{compartment}} (from Wimbledon to Waterloo, before the glory of the District Railway) I amended this declaration {{in the light of the}} sense that my friends would probably after all not enjoy a monopoly of Mr. Saltram. I won't pretend to have taken his vast measure on that first occasion, but I think I had achieved a glimpse of what the privilege of his acquaintance might mean for many persons in the way of charges accepted. He had been a great experience, and it was this perhaps that had put me into the frame of foreseeing how we should all, sooner or later, have the honour of dealing with him as a whole. Whatever impression I then received of the, amount of this <b>total,</b> <b>I</b> had a full enough vision of the patience of the Mulvilles. He was to stay all the winter: Adelaide dropped it in a tone that drew the sting from the inevitable emphasis. These excellent people might indeed have been content to give the circle of hospitality a diameter of six months; but if they didn't say he was to stay all summer as well it was only because this was more than they ventured to hope. I remember that at dinner that evening he wore slippers, new and predominantly purple, of some queer carpet-stuff; but the Mulvilles were still in the stage of supposing that he might be snatched from them by higher bidders. At a later time they grew, poor dears, to fear no snatching; but theirs was a fidelity which needed no help from competition to make them proud. Wonderful indeed as, when all was said, you inevitably pronounced Frank Saltram, it was not to be overlooked that the Kent Mulvilles were in their way still more extraordinary: as striking an instance as could easily be encountered of the familiar truth that remarkable men find remarkable conveniences.|$|E

50|$|In some ways, 129I {{is similar}} to 36Cl.

This makes it fairly easy for 129I to enter the biosphere as it becomes incorporated into vegetation, soil, milk, animal tissue, etc.|$|E
