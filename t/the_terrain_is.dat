5|$|NY174 and NY175 {{begin to}} curve to the {{northeast}} as they become parallel with another unsigned county road (CR150), passing Marcellus County Park along the way. The roads remain as such until an intersection where the county road ends and the two state routes split. In downtown Marcellus, <b>the</b> <b>terrain</b> <b>is</b> flat, with residential homes and commercial businesses surrounding the road. At the split, NY174 heads to the west through {{the main street of}} the village, while NY175 heads eastward towards Syracuse.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{is located}} on the top of an {{irregular}} plateau, whose southern, eastern and northern slopes are abrupt, with the softer western slope, towards the modern village of Kastro, offering the easiest access. The heart of the fortress consists of a large hexagonal keep, complemented towards the west, where <b>the</b> <b>terrain</b> <b>is</b> more accessible, by an additional outer wall, likewise of irregular polygonal outline, enclosing a second, much wider courtyard (the outer ward).|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>terrain</b> <b>is</b> level enough, and {{the ridge}} broad enough, {{to allow for}} a 500-foot (150 m) parking lot along the south side of Highway 82 at the height of land. The pass is split evenly between Pitkin and Lake counties, as well as White River and San Isabel {{national}} forests. Boundaries of the Collegiate Peaks Wilderness and the Mount Massive Wilderness are near the pass on the south and north respectively. The Hunter–Fryingpan Wilderness is also nearby.|$|E
5000|$|In 2002, 1.83 km² of <b>the</b> <b>terrain</b> <b>were</b> {{given for}} 49 {{years to a}} company owned by Australian citizen Tony Mikhael that wanted to invest €650 million and build some {{residential}} areas {{as well as a}} golf course, a hippodrome, a hotel and some clubs. <b>The</b> <b>terrain</b> itself <b>is</b> estimated to be worth about €500 million, as the land costs in the area around €300/m². [...] argued that the concession of <b>the</b> <b>terrain</b> <b>was</b> illegal and that the Romanian state only gets around €0.28/m².|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>terrain</b> <b>was</b> {{as flat as}} a roof top. Utnapishtim {{opened a}} window and felt fresh air on his face.|$|R

5|$|Avinor {{has also}} {{proposed}} lowering the terrain {{east of the}} airport. <b>The</b> <b>terrain</b> <b>is</b> actually flatter to the east, but because the runway was expanded in that direction, the extension cannot be used without removing all ground in the twelve-degree slope. Although it has no impact on smaller aircraft, the reduced runway length has a severe impact {{on the performance of}} Boeing 737 aircraft, which are used by both Norwegian and SAS. For instance, during winter a 180-seat 737-800 can only utilize 71 percent of its permitted take-off weight; this would hinder fully loaded aircraft flying further than Oslo. The impacts for 150-seat 737-700 aircraft are smaller, as they can reach Oslo during winter and Berlin during summer. The airport served 169,428 passengers in 1996 and 216,000 passengers in 2000.|$|E
5|$|With the {{exception}} of the Naktong delta to the south, and the valley between Taegu and P'ohang-dong, <b>the</b> <b>terrain</b> <b>is</b> extremely rough and mountainous. Northeast of P'ohang-dong along the South Korean line the terrain was especially treacherous, and movement in the region was extremely difficult. Thus, the UN established the Pusan Perimeter in a location outlined by the Sea of Japan to the south and east, the Naktong River to the west, and extremely mountainous terrain to the north, using the terrain as a natural defense. However the rough terrain also made communication difficult, particularly for the South Korean forces in the P'ohang-dong area.|$|E
5|$|SH74 {{begins at}} an {{interchange}} with I-70 in El Rancho. Ramps from I-70 westbound branch off the freeway's exit 252 {{from the north}} side and cross the highway southwestward. Access to SH74 from I-70 eastbound is provided via U.S. Highway 40 (US40) a slight distance to the west. From I-70, the roadway heads southwesterly through El Rancho, meeting an intersection with US40 (Swede Gulch Road). The route heads westward before turning southwestward into a coniferous forest setting as a four-lane divided highway. The roadway turns westward where it meets County Road 23 (CR 23, Kerr Gulch Road). Evergreen Parkway passes Fillius Park to the north {{in the community of}} Hidden Valley, where <b>the</b> <b>terrain</b> <b>is</b> mountainous. After intersecting Bergen Parkway, which heads southwesterly toward Bergen Park, SH74 turns to the south. The parkway meets Squaw Pass Road and crosses the Troublesome Creek before traveling along the west side of Buchanan Park. SH74 follows the east side of Elk Meadow Open Space Park, where open grassland is dotted with occasional trees. The road narrows to two lanes and climbs steeply at milepost five. While passing Wah Keeney Park, the road turns southeastward and continues to the community of Hiwan. SH74 enters the town of Evergreen, passing by a lake of the same name along Bear Creek in Dedisse Park. Here, the route intersects CR 74, which heads west along the Upper Bear Creek.|$|E

50|$|But <b>the</b> <b>terrain</b> <b>was</b> {{unsuitable}} for attack. <b>The</b> <b>terrain</b> <b>was</b> rugged, with two man-made ponds being {{next to each}} other, with an embankment between them. Pekri's cavalry started {{to go through the}} embankment at the trot. Meanwhile, Pekri was warned that the narrow passage might cause difficulties; he therefore decided to retreat from those positions. While his cavalry started to turn back, it became disorganized, of which the troops of Imperial commander János Pálffy - a loyalist Hungarian - took advantage; they counter-attacked, and caused the disorganized horsemen to flee.|$|R
40|$|The {{interactive}} algorithm of {{formation and}} editing {{of the digital}} models of <b>the</b> <b>terrain</b> <b>was</b> developed on <b>the</b> basis of differential splines. The methods for processing of big amounts of information were suggested.

50|$|The Tellurometer design yields high {{accuracy}} distance measurements over geodetic distances, {{but it is}} also useful for second order survey work, especially in areas where <b>the</b> <b>terrain</b> <b>was</b> rough and/or <b>the</b> temperatures extreme.|$|R
25|$|Barceloneta's {{terrain is}} {{predominantly}} plain. Since {{it is located}} in the karst region, it features hills, ponors, and caves. Near the coast, <b>the</b> <b>terrain</b> <b>is</b> occupied by the Tiburones cienaga.|$|E
25|$|In case <b>the</b> <b>terrain</b> <b>is</b> not a {{flat plate}} (the usual case!) we use for H the local terrain height value but apply a further {{correction}} called the terrain correction (TC).|$|E
25|$|Public {{roads are}} {{maintained}} by the Bowen Island Municipality. There are roadside walking trails {{in only a few}} places and <b>the</b> <b>terrain</b> <b>is</b> hilly and winding. Private vehicles are the primary form of transportation and hitchhiking is commonplace.|$|E
5000|$|Small-scale {{realignment}} between 1950 and 1960. At {{the same}} time <b>the</b> <b>terrain</b> <b>was</b> generally modified by manual labour {{with the help of}} in-house machines. During this time approximately 950 hectares were enclosed by the farmland consolidation authority.|$|R
25|$|Before {{the actual}} {{construction}} started, <b>the</b> <b>terrain</b> <b>was</b> evenly covered with sand from the Sava and the Danube rivers {{in an effort}} to dry out the land and raise it above the reach of flooding and underground streams.|$|R
50|$|Around 1904, {{the whole}} monastery <b>was</b> {{demolished}} and <b>the</b> <b>terrain</b> <b>was</b> lowered to <b>the</b> {{level of the}} street and rent houses were built instead of the monastery. The church was not restored and was in danger of demolition.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>terrain</b> <b>is</b> hilly on the {{highlands}} within the Anti-Lebanon mountain range system. The highest {{point in the}} zone is at Mount Hermon (2814 m) on the Lebanese border. The lowest point is at the Yarmuk River at 200m below sea-level.|$|E
25|$|It is in {{a heavily}} forested area, {{and much of}} the {{community}} has retained trees for shade and decoration. <b>The</b> <b>terrain</b> <b>is</b> essentially flat, with the exception of topographic variations ranging from 125 to 175 feet between Spring Creek and Flintridge Drive.|$|E
25|$|Largely rural in character, {{land cover}} is forest, farmland, and grassland/pasture; modest {{wetlands}} {{are found in}} river valleys, and along the Mississippi.
