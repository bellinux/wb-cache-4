40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel method for adaptive anti-swing fuzzy logic control for overhead cranes with hoisting. The control action is distributed between three fuzzy logic controllers (FLC’s) : <b>trolley</b> <b>controller,</b> hoist controller, and anti-swing controller. A method for varying the ranges {{of the variables}} of the three controllers {{as a function of}} the crane’s parameters and/or motion variables is presented. Simulation examples show that the proposed controller can successfully drive overhead cranes under various operating conditions...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Gantry {{crane system}} is a {{mechanism}} in heavy engineering that moves payload such container from one point to another. Generally, experienced operators or experts are required to control manually the gantry position while minimizing the payload vibration or swing oscillation. Therefore, those manpower has to be trained in order to operate the gantry crane system safely and efficiently. Thus, to overcome this problem, a feedback control scheme has been utilized in the system. In this paper, PID and PD controllers are introduced for controlling the trolley displacement and the swing oscillation in the gantry crane system. PID controller is designed for tracking the desired position of the <b>trolley</b> whereas PD <b>controller</b> is implemented to minimize the payload oscillation. The PID and PD parameters are tuned by the auto-tuning method. Simulation results have demonstrated satisfactory response based on control system performances...|$|R
