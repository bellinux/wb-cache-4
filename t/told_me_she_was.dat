The situation soon became tense again; Richard de Mille, nephew of the famous director Cecil B. de Mille, recalled that [...] "there {{was a lot of}} turmoil and dissension in the Foundation at the time; he kept accusing Communists of trying to take control and he was having difficulties with Northrup. It was clear their marriage was breaking up – she was very critical of him and he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> fooling around with Hollister and he didn't trust her." [...] Hubbard enlisted de Mille and another Dianeticist, Dave Williams, in an attempt to convince her to stay with him. John Sanborne, who worked with Hubbard for many years, recalled: ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1904, {{her oldest}} brother, Clarence, left home, joining a small {{traveling}} troupe owned by Moses Stokes. [...] "If Bessie had been old enough, {{she would have}} gone with him," [...] said Clarence's widow, Maud. [...] "That's why he left without telling her, but Clarence <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> ready, even then. Of course, {{she was only a}} child." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{the song}} was first released, Rick Melbourne, a breakfast radio announcer, {{produced}} a parody version of the song, including the lyrics [...] "God help me, she <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> sixteen". Australian country singer John Williamson recorded a live version as [...] "Only 19" [...] and released it on his 1984 vinyl LP, The Smell of Gumleaves (rereleased in 1996 as a CD under the title Home Among the Gum Trees).|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{she told}} me-- You can't {{understand}} what <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me.</b> <b>She's</b> <b>been</b> {{away with this}} young fellow once, and she said as much as that she'd go again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No. He merely {{said he saw}} a {{great deal}} of you. Martha Preston <b>told</b> <b>me.</b> <b>She</b> <b>is</b> still here, and goes to church occasionally. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> much {{surprised}} to learn that you were in the city.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, I {{will not}} pry into other people's affairs," [...] said Lawrence, {{in his usual}} tone, [...] "but you once <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> the {{daughter}} of a chief, and assuredly no lady in this land could equal her in grace or dignity of carriage and manner, to say nothing of modesty, which is the invariable evidence." ...|$|R
2500|$|The character's [...] "scantily clad" [...] attire {{has been}} commented {{on in the}} British tabloid press, with Tony Stewart from [...] the Daily Mirror {{suggesting}} that Gemma Bissix might [...] "turn up in Albert Square starkers next". In May 2008, Clare was shown dressed as Princess Leia, and according to Stewart she looked like [...] "a porno version" [...] of the Star Wars character, [...] "in white hot pants and a skimpy top that [...] her galactic orbs to bounce about". In {{an article in the}} Daily Mail, the journalist suggested that the character had quickly made a name for herself [...] "thanks to her plunging necklines and knee-high boots [...] dressed in a tight, short silver dress and fishnet tights [...] her love of fitted clothes has attracted the attention of many of Albert Square's male residents." [...] Commenting on her character's revealing clothing, Bissix has said, [...] "I wasn't aware {{she was going to be}} so scantily clad. I knew she was going to be a minx but not that she was going to wear so little so often. Samantha Janus [...] <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> in low-cut tops all the time when she started so I think it's a bit of an initiation." ...|$|E
60|$|After {{a little}} further {{conversation}} she <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> from London, and was down with her people for their holiday.|$|E
6000|$|... "Devoted, of course; {{she wished}} you {{to marry her}} candidate. She <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{watching}} you only in order to interpose." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Her uncle <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> had <b>been</b> {{considered}} pretty,' remarked Madame Mantalini. 'I {{think her}} {{one of the most}} ordinary girls I ever met with.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know. You <b>told</b> <b>me.</b> But <b>she</b> <b>was</b> so motherly. And I didn't {{have any}} woman----Vida 's become so married and proprietary." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I understand,' said Berenger. 'The Cure of Nissard <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> traced through cakes, {{the secret}} of which was only known at Bellaise.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, mamma, {{listen to}} me. It is not many hours since Fanny <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> unalterably {{determined}} to throw herself at Lord Ballindine's feet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Little? Jim <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> tall; regal, I {{think he}} said. In fact, he's {{enthusiastic}} about her; {{and that makes}} me curious, because Jim's taste is not often bad." ...|$|E
6000|$|Philammon blushed scarlet, but {{he dared}} not lie. 'There was a--a poor black woman, wounded and trodden down, and I dare not leave her, for she <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> a Christian.' ...|$|E
60|$|A single {{glance at}} the slim, majestic figure, and at the {{classical}} outline of her face, <b>told</b> <b>me</b> who <b>she</b> <b>was</b> and <b>told</b> <b>me</b> rightly. It was Mr. Ravenor's sister.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have not}} <b>told</b> <b>me</b> who <b>she</b> <b>is</b> yet. And I shall {{probably}} not remember her. You must not {{expect me to}} recognize everyone instantaneously, as I recognized you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{it was a}} mistake; {{for from}} day to day the {{difficulty}} grew upon me, and when once there was a difficulty, I was not strong enough to overcome it. There never came the moment in which I was willing to mar my own happiness by telling you that which I thought would wound yours. I had not dreamed beforehand how much more difficult it would become when I should once be absolutely your wife. Then your sister came and <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me.</b> <b>She</b> <b>is</b> better than anybody in the world except yourself." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{maternal}} Sellars waddled {{after us}} into the passage, which she completely blocked. She <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> delight-ted to have met me, {{and that she was}} always at home on Sundays.|$|E
6000|$|... "It won't do, Edmund. You'll find it won't do! Why, old Selby <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{a pretty}} creature, only {{just like your}} good pious ladies, running into all the dirtiest cottages." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{might have}} <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> tired," [...] Emily {{said to herself}} quietly. [...] "Well! the best thing I {{can do is to}} put out the light and follow her example." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> called Dian the Beautiful, {{and that}} she belonged to the tribe of Amoz, which dwells in the cliffs above the Darel Az, or shallow sea.|$|R
6000|$|... "She <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> to {{have met}} a gentleman to-night," [...] he said. [...] "Here, we must go and speak to her now, or she'll think that something's up." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Monsieur is serious?" [...] he inquired. [...] "It {{is only a}} {{short time}} ago that I was talking with Mademoiselle Delora, and <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> dining with you here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O--h!" [...] drawled out Miss Gusset {{with a very}} {{significant}} tone. [...] "I suppose {{she is one of}} your playing-up ladies. I think you <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> only on a visit here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{did think}} {{directly}} of asking her that," [...] says he; [...] "and she <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> quite certain {{that there was}} no written evidence of the forgery except that one letter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Most {{intelligent}} and amiable women all three, {{and we shall}} have pleasant times together, I am sure. You may safely cultivate Becky; Mrs. Taylor <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> a remarkably bright girl, though she may not look it." ...|$|E
60|$|Great was my anguish when my {{neighbor}} <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> no more. It seems the dear thing pined for her old home, and kept returning {{to it in}} spite of age or bad weather.|$|R
6000|$|... "Curiosity {{killed a}} cat," [...] {{observed}} the Story Girl coolly. [...] "Miss Reade hasn't <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{going to marry}} anybody. You will find out all that {{is good for you}} to know in due time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All I know," [...] said I, [...] "is {{that her}} family name is Raynor,--my {{grandmother}} <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that,--that <b>she</b> <b>is</b> absolutely, utterly, and even wickedly {{out of place in}} the House of Martha, and that I want her for my wife." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I did not know. The Countess <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not in Keppel Street, {{but refused}} to inform me where she was staying. I should not have {{interfered}} with her ladyship's plans, had she been less secret with me." ...|$|E
6000|$|Leland started, {{and there}} was no doubt that his concern was genuine. [...] "Oh," [...] he said, [...] "the thing's quite out of the question. She <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> going to stay with us as long as we wanted her." ...|$|E
6000|$|Roberts: [...] "And she <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> no more a cook than my wife was; and {{she said}} she'd teach me to be playing my jokes on ladies; and she grabbed up her things and flew out of the room." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are quite}} a stranger, Miss Champneyes," [...] Saton said, taking her unresisting hand in his. [...] "I hope {{that you are going}} in to see the Comtesse. Only this morning <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> finding it appallingly lonely." ...|$|R
5000|$|Začela je: „Uganeš, kaj mi je tista ostudna pošast rekla? Rekla je: ‚Potem pa kar jutri pridi.

6000|$|... "Yes, I remember. You <b>told</b> <b>me</b> where <b>she</b> <b>was</b> staying. But the Countess and I are old acquaintances. I feel {{sure that}} she did not object to your having given me her address. I could not {{possibly}} leave London without calling upon her." ...|$|R
