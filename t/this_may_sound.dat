500|$|Eventually, {{the review}} for Illmatic was {{handled by the}} magazine's {{columnist}} Miss Info (then writing under the nom de plume, [...] "shortie"), who shared Schecter's enthusiasm for Nas' album. In her review of Illmatic, Minyah wrote, [...] "I must maintain {{this is one of}} the best hip-hop albums I have ever heard" [...] and wrote of its content, [...] "Lyrically, the whole shit is on point. No cliched metaphors, no gimmicks. Never too abstract, never superficial." [...] She also commented on the impact of Nas's [...] "poetic realism" [...] writing: “Nas’ images remind me of the personal memories and people, both passed and present… All <b>this</b> <b>may</b> <b>sound</b> like melodrama but it not just me. I've been hearing similar responses all over. While 'Memory Lane' is my shit, my homies claim 'The World Is Yours,' and if you've got peoples doing time, then 'One Love' may hit you the hardest.". With the backing of Schecter and the other editors on the staff, Minya awarded Illmatic with the magazine's highest rating.|$|E

Never before had a band tuned down its guitars and crunched a heavier riff than on this album. [...] "Mouth for War" [...] and [...] "A New Level" [...] and [...] "No Good (Attack the Radical)" [...] stand out on an album where every track is a classic track. Dimebag Darrell was an innovator and a true godsend for heavy metal. One of the most underrated players in the genre. And <b>this</b> <b>may</b> <b>sound</b> corny, but the way the band was able to turn seemingly negative aspects of the genre – hate, anger, violence and despair – into positive thoughts is somewhat akin to De La Soul dropping a positive message into rap." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1605 {{the actor}} Augustine Phillips left {{specific}} pieces of his wardrobe to an apprentice {{in his last}} will and testament including his [...] "mouse-colored" [...] velvet hose, purple cloak, white taffeta doublet, and black taffeta suit. To a modern sensibility, <b>this</b> <b>may</b> <b>sound</b> quaint and odd; but when [...] "a doublet and hose of seawater green satin cost £3," [...] the monetary value of Phillips' items was not negligible. Actors could face serious penalties for appropriating the costumes of their companies. [...] (The players could defray some of their costs in the used clothing market. As an example, the King's Men bought discarded items of Gondomar's wardrobe for the actor playing the Black Knight in A Game at Chess. [...] Often, [...] "eminent lords and knights at their decease" [...] would leave articles of their finery to their servants much of it [...] "unseemly" [...] for servingmen and women to wear. Such garments would end up the property of the actors.) ...|$|E
2500|$|However, Anne Rice has {{consistently}} and aggressively prevented fan fiction based {{on any of}} her fictional characters (mostly those from her famous Interview with the Vampire and its sequels in The Vampire Chronicles). She, along with Anne McCaffrey (whose stance has been changed by her son, Todd McCaffrey, since her death) and Raymond Feist, have asked to have any fiction related to their series removed from FanFiction.Net. George R.R. Martin, who was selected by Time magazine {{as one of the}} [...] "2011 Time 100" [...] and is most famous for his epic fantasy series, A Song of Ice and Fire, is also strongly opposed to fan fiction, believing it to be copyright infringement and a bad exercise for aspiring writers. Sharon Lee and Steve Miller, creators of the Liaden universe, strongly oppose fan fiction written in their universe, Lee saying that [...] "Nobody else is going to get it right. <b>This</b> <b>may</b> <b>sound</b> rude and elitist, but honestly, it's not easy for us to get it right sometimes, and we've been living with these characters... for a very long time." ...|$|E

5000|$|Stage 2: The diphthong [...] begins {{further back}} and {{open in the}} mouth, so that, for example, fish bait and old lace in <b>this</b> dialect <b>may</b> <b>sound</b> to other English {{speakers}} more like fish bite and old lice.

He who has thus gone back to the beginning, and seen everything as quaint and new, will always see things in their right order, the one depending on the other in degree of purpose and importance: the poker for the fire and the fire for the man and the man for the glory of God.|$|E
60|$|To European ears <b>this</b> <b>may</b> <b>sound</b> rather strange, {{but those}} who have seen the flat roofs of Eastern lands will {{understand}} it. Youssef's house, like nearly all the other houses of the city, had a flat roof, with a surrounding parapet nearly breast-high. Here had been placed a few wooden boxes filled with earth and planted with flowering shrubs. These formed quite a little garden, to which Youssef had been wont to retreat of an evening for meditative and, we may add, smokative purposes. But as Youssef had grown old, his eyes had nearly, and his legs had quite, failed him. Hence, being unable to climb to his roof, he had latterly given it up entirely {{to the use of}} his black slaves, Samson and Dinah White.|$|E
