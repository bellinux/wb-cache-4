5|$|Aristotle {{stated in}} the History of Animals that all beings were {{arranged}} in a fixed scale of perfection, reflected in <b>their</b> <b>form</b> (eidos). They stretched from minerals to plants and animals, and on up to man, forming the scala naturae or great chain of being. His system had eleven grades, arranged according to the potentiality of each being, expressed in <b>their</b> <b>form</b> at birth. The highest animals gave birth to warm and wet creatures alive, the lowest bore theirs cold, dry, and in thick eggs. The system was based on Aristotle's interpretation of the four elements in his On Generation and Corruption: Fire (hot and dry); Air (hot and wet); Water (cold and wet); and Earth (cold and dry). These are arranged from the most energetic to the least, so the warm, wet young raised in a womb with a placenta were higher on the scale than the cold, dry, nearly mineral eggs of birds. However, Aristotle is careful never to insist that a group fits perfectly in the scale; he knows animals have many combinations of attributes, and that placements are approximate.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the common}} {{period in which}} castles rose to {{prominence}} in Europe, <b>their</b> <b>form</b> and design varied from region to region. In the early 11thcentury, the motte and keep– an artificial mound surmounted by a palisade and tower– {{was the most common}} form of castle in Europe, everywhere except Scandinavia. While Britain, France, and Italy shared a tradition of timber construction that was continued in castle architecture, Spain more commonly used stone or mud-brick as the main building material.|$|E
5|$|Like {{elsewhere}} in Madagascar, Antankarana society was traditionally {{divided into three}} classes: nobles, commoners and slaves. Slavery was abolished under the French colonial administration but families often retain their historic affiliations. In traditional communities, descendants of nobles live on the northern side of the village and non-nobles live in the southern part. The areas may be divided by a central clearing where the town hall is often situated; if the village also has a zomba (house reserved for royalty), it would traditionally be located here. Intermarriage across classes is common among the Antankarana, and most can claim a family relation {{to a member of}} the noble class. Historically, commoners were further sub-divided into caste-like groups called karazana ("types of people") based on <b>their</b> <b>form</b> of livelihood.|$|E

People came to the shebeens not only for skokiaan or baberton (illegally self-made alcoholic beverages), but to talk about their daily worries, their political ideas and their fears and hopes.

5|$|Quern stones: Quern {{stones were}} used in China at least 10,000 years ago to grind wheat into flour. The {{production}} of flour by rubbing wheat by hand took several hours.

Saddle querns were known in China during the Neolithic Age but rotary stone mills did not appear until the Warring States Period. A prehistoric quern dating back to 23,000 BCE was found at the Longwangchan archaeological site, in Hukou, Shaanxi in 2007. The site is located in the heartland of the northern Chinese loess plateau near the Yellow River.|$|E
5|$|The club {{were unable}} to match this success in the two seasons that followed, and {{finished}} in 11th and 12th places respectively. The 1949–50 season brought another disappointing league campaign. The season started well, as the club was unbeaten in their first 19 matches and was top of the league {{at the turn of}} the year. <b>Their</b> <b>form</b> declined thereafter, and they finished eighth. This did not hinder their progress in the FA Cup, as they reached their second final (their first at Wembley), against Arsenal.

5|$|Admission to {{the school}} is through the eleven-plus examination, taken in year 6. Pupils must obtain a minimum score before their {{application}} will be considered and places will be awarded based on whether the child is in public care, whether {{he lives in the}} catchment area and attends a partnered primary school, and whether they have siblings attending the school or parents working there. In the event of a tie, places will be allocated based on proximity {{to the school}}. The school has a maximum annual intake of 116 at the start of year 7 (aged 11); pupils are arranged into forms of no more than 30, where registration takes place. <b>Their</b> <b>form</b> tutors provide access to pastoral support, overseen by their Key Stage Manager.

5|$|Building for the 2001–02 Premier League campaign, Allardyce signed France {{international}} defender Bruno N'Gotty from Marseille in a loan deal {{which was}} eventual {{made into a}} permanent one after N'Gotty {{established himself as a}} key first team player. He also brought in Henrik Pedersen from Silkeborg IF for £650,000, though otherwise remained loyal to the players that had won promotion the previous campaign. They recorded a 5–0 win at Leicester City on the opening day, then beat Middlesbrough and Liverpool to secure nine points from their first three games. After six games without a win, Bolton then recorded a shock 2–1 victory over Manchester United on 20 October. However <b>their</b> <b>form</b> dropped, and so in the January transfer window Allardyce brought in Danish midfielder Stig Tøfting, German striker Fredi Bobic (on loan), and World Cup-winning attacker Youri Djorkaeff. Djorkaeff scored both goals in a 2–1 win over Charlton Athletic on 23 March and Bobic scored a hat-trick in a 4–1 win over Ipswich Town on 6 April; the victory over Ipswich proved to be essential as Bolton ended the season in 16th place on 40 points, ahead of Ipswich who were relegated with 36 points.|$|E

5|$|For the 2008–09 season, Team Bath {{played at}} the highest level they {{achieved}} in their history. Competing in the Conference South, the club were two promotions away from The Football League. Early in the season Bath were competing for a play-off berth, but failed to maintain <b>their</b> <b>form,</b> eventually finishing 11th in the table with 16 wins. Towards the end of the season, the Football Conference notified Team Bath that as they were not a limited company they would be ineligible for further promotions, and would no longer be allowed to compete in the FA Cup; the club opted to resign from the Conference {{at the end of the}} season rather than restructure. Team Bath had at the time been discussing the possibility of a merger with Bath City, with the aim of getting the merged team into the Football League.|$|E
5|$|In 1904, MacLaren led Lancashire {{to victory}} in the County Championship, their only such success under his captaincy. Unusually for a Championship-winning team, the club relied heavily on batting rather than bowling. MacLaren played several big innings, scoring at a rapid pace, as his team began {{the season with a}} string of victories. <b>Their</b> <b>form</b> faded later in the season, but they {{remained}} unbeaten. In all first-class cricket, MacLaren scored 1,191 runs at 31.34. At some point during the season, he was asked by Ranjitsinhji, a close friend, to become his private secretary, and both men travelled to India during the winter of 1904–05. Ranjitsinhji at the time was pursuing his claim to the throne of Nawanagar, and he remained in India when MacLaren returned to England for the 1905 cricket season.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool {{started the}} 1996–97 season well, {{and by the}} turn of the year they were top of the league, two points clear of Arsenal. The club were unable to {{maintain}} <b>their</b> <b>form</b> during the rest of the season, losses to Coventry City, Manchester United and Wimbledon resulted in the club finishing the season in fourth position. Despite early exits in the League and FA Cup, Liverpool reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup. They were unable to progress after a 3–0 defeat in the first-leg, despite winning the second leg 2–0 and were knocked out 3–2 on aggregate against French team Paris Saint-Germain. Liverpool were without striker Fowler for the start of the 1997–98 season after he suffered knee ligament damage in a pre-season friendly. This was offset by the emergence of Michael Owen, who scored eighteen goals from thirty-six appearances. Paul Ince was signed to replace Barnes who joined Newcastle United. Liverpool were unable to challenge eventual winners Arsenal and finished thirteen points behind in third place. Further redevelopment took place at Anfield during the season with a second tier added to the Anfield Road stand.|$|E

5|$|Liverpool's {{first season}} in the Second Division in 1954–55 brought them an 11th-place finish. During this season the club {{suffered}} the biggest defeat in its history, a 9–1 loss to Birmingham City. Although in the following season they improved to third place, {{it was not enough}} for Welsh to keep his job and he was sacked {{at the end of the}} season. His replacement was Phil Taylor, a former captain of the club and a member of the coaching staff. Taylor signed players such as Ronnie Moran, Alan A'Court and Jimmy Melia, who would become mainstays of the club for seasons to come, but was unable to guide Liverpool back to the First Division. The Liverpool board persisted with him, despite the club's loss to non-League side Worcester City in the third round of the FA Cup in January 1959. His tenure ended during the 1959–60 season; after a good start, <b>their</b> <b>form</b> began to tail off mid-season, and after a defeat to Huddersfield Town, Taylor resigned. The man who replaced him was Huddersfield's manager, Bill Shankly.|$|E
5|$|Milne managed {{three goals}} in 22 league {{appearances}} in 1988–89. The {{first was a}} 20-yard volley on 3 December 1988 in a 3–0 home win over former club Charlton Athletic, which ended United's nine-match winless run (eight draws and a defeat) in the First Division. He also found the net on Boxing Day in a 2–0 win over Nottingham Forest at Old Trafford. The week after Milne played what he felt was his best game in a Manchester United jersey in a 3–1 New Year's victory over rivals Liverpool. However {{they were unable to}} maintain <b>their</b> <b>form</b> and finished 11th in the league after winning only three of their last 14 league games.

West Ham's form continued to be poor with the team seldom outside the relegation zone, placing Grant's future as manager under serious doubt. A 4–0 Football League Cup quarter-final win over Manchester United was an otherwise bright spot in a disappointing season. West Ham's form in the Premier League did not affect <b>their</b> <b>form</b> in the two domestic cups. The Hammers reached the semi-final of the League Cup before being eliminated by eventual winners Birmingham City as well as the quarter final of the FA cup before a 2–1 defeat at Stoke City.|$|E
