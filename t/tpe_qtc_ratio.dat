40|$|BackgroundType 2 {{diabetes}} mellitus (T 2 DM) {{is associated with}} increased risk of malignant ventricular arrhythmias. Cardiac electrical inhomogeneity may be {{the leading cause of}} the increased arrhythmic risk in patients with T 2 DM. The peak {{and the end of the}} T wave (Tp-e) interval and associated Tp-e/QT ratio are promising measures of ventricular repolarization indicating transmural dispersion of repolarization. The aim of this study was to assess ventricular repolarization in patients with T 2 DM by using Tp-e interval, Tp-e/QT ratio and Tp-e/corrected QT interval (<b>QTc)</b> <b>ratio.</b> MethodsForty-three patients with T 2 DM and 43 healthy control subjects, matched by gender and age, were studied. All participants underwent electrocardiography (ECG) recording. PR, RR and QT intervals represents the ECG intervals. These are not abbreviations. In all literature these ECG intervals are written like in this text. Tp-e intervals were measured from 12 -lead ECG. Rate QTc was calculated by using the Bazett's formula. Tp-e/QT ratio and Tp-e/QTc ratio were also calculated. ResultsMean Tp-e interval was significantly prolonged in patients with T 2 DM compared to controls (79. 4 ± 10. 3, 66. 4 ± 8. 1 ms, respectively; P< 0. 001). We also found significantly higher values of Tp-e/QT ratio and Tp-e/QTc ratio in patients with diabetes than controls (0. 21 ± 0. 03, 0. 17 ± 0. 02 and 0. 19 ± 0. 02, 0. 16 ± 0. 02, respectively; P< 0. 001). There was no difference in terms of the other ECG parameters between the groups. ConclusionTp-e interval, Tp-e/QT ratio and Tp-e/QTc ratio were prolonged in patients with T 2 DM. We concluded that T 2 DM leads to augmentation of transmural dispersion of repolarization suggesting increased risk for ventricular arrhythmogenesis...|$|R

40|$|The {{study was}} {{undertaken}} on 150 healthy human subjects {{of both the}} sexes in {{the age group of}} 18 - 38 years to assess the effect of graded head-up tilt (HUT) and head-reverse tilt (HRT) on sympathetic nervous system Vs parasympathetic nervous system. The tilt positions used were 00, 300, 600, 300 R and 00 R. The parameters and test performed were pulse rate, blood pressure, cold pressor test, <b>QTC</b> interval, valsalva <b>ratio</b> and expiratory-inspiratory (E:I) ratio. On graded head-up tilt (600) pulse rate and diastolic blood pressure showed significant increase. Cold pressor test and QTc interval showed significant increase from 300 to 600 tilt. The valsalva and E:I ratios did not show any significant change on graded HUT. On reversal of tilt all the parameters showing significant increase returned to near pre-tilt values. These responses clearly indicate that graded HUT leads to decrease in parasympathetic reactivity but increase in sympathetic reactivity, which is more significant during higher tilt levels (300 to 600). On reversal of tilt both the parasympathetic reactivity and the sympathetic reactivity i. e. autonomic reactivity return to normal pre-tilt level.

40|$|OBJECTIVES — To {{evaluate}} whether reduced {{heart rate variability}} (HRV), prolonged cor-rected QT (QTc) interval, or increased QT dispersion (QTD) are predictors of mortality in the general diabetic and nondiabetic population. RESEARCH DESIGN ANDMETHODS — Nondiabetic (n 1, 560) and diabetic (n 160) subjects aged 55 – 74 years were assessed to determine whether reduced HRV, prolonged QTc interval, and increased QTD may predict all-cause mortality. Lowest quartiles for the maximum-minimum R-R interval difference (max-min, as measured at baseline from a 20 -s standard 12 -lead resting electrocardiogram without controlling for depth and rate of respira-tion), QTc 440 ms and QTD 60 ms, were used as cutpoints. RESULTS — During a 9 -year follow-up, 10. 5 % of the nondiabetic and 30. 6 % of the diabetic population deceased. In the nondiabetic individuals, multivariate Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for cardiovascular risk factors and demographic variables showed that pro-longed <b>QTc</b> interval (hazard <b>ratio</b> 2. 02 [95 % CI 1. 29 – 3. 17]; P 0. 002) but not low max-min (0. 93 [0. 65 – 1. 34]; P 0. 700), and increased QTD (0. 98 [0. 60 – 1. 60]; P 0. 939) were asso-ciated with increased mortality.

40|$|Background and aims: the {{relationship}} between nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and prolonged heart rate-corrected QT (QTc) interval, {{a risk factor for}} ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death, is currently unknown. We therefore examined {{the relationship}} between NAFLD and QTc interval in patients with type 2 diabetes. Methods and results: we studied a random sample of 400 outpatients with type 2 diabetes. Computerized electrocardiograms were performed for analysis and quantification of QTc interval. NAFLD was diagnosed by ultrasonographic detection of hepatic steatosis in the absence of other liver diseases. Mean QTc interval and the proportion of those with increased QTc interval (defined as either QTc interval above the median, i. e. ? 416 ms, or QTc interval > 440 ms) increased steadily with the presence and ultrasonographic severity of NAFLD. NAFLD was associated with increased <b>QTc</b> interval (odds <b>ratio</b> [OR] 2. 16, 95 % CI 1. 4 – 3. 4, p < 0. 001). Adjustments for age, sex, smoking, alcohol consumption, BMI, hypertension, electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy, diabetes-related variables and comorbid conditions did not attenuate the association between NAFLD and increased QTc interval (adjusted-OR 2. 26, 95 % CI 1. 4 – 3. 7, p < 0. 001). Of note, the exclusion of those with established coronary heart disease or peripheral artery disease from analysis did not appreciably weaken this association. Conclusion: this is the first study to demonstrate that the presence and severity of NAFLD on ultrasound is strongly associated with increased QTc interval in patients with type 2 diabetes even after adjusting for multiple established risk factors and potential confounder...|$|R
40|$|Endurance {{events such}} as long {{distance}} running races are increasing in popularity and convey multiple health benefits. However, such exercise forms also represent a major challenge to human cardiovascular physiology and {{are associated with a}} momentarily increased risk for adverse cardiac events. Using the world’s largest cross-country running race Lidingöloppet as a model of endurance events, this thesis aims to: 1) investigate male and female participation and performance trends 2) detail the cardiovascular findings of a comprehensive cardiovascular preparticipation evaluation in novice male race participants aged 45 years and older 3) study the impact of race participation on cardiac autonomic tone and 4) assess features of cardiovascular function and vectorcardiography (VCG), and their response to endurance exercise in individuals with early repolarisation (ER). Study I Participation and performance trends were investigated in > 120, 000 runners partaking in the Lidingöloppet between 1993 and 2007. In a subgroup of 249 middle-aged males, the association between the cardiac biomarker NT-proBNP and runtime was also studied. Participation increased over the study period, particularly in females and older males, while participants’ fitness deteriorated, as measured by an average increase in runtime of 21 ± 31 min. Longer runtimes were independently associated with higher levels of NT-proBNP. Study II A preparticipation cardiovascular exam was performed in 153 middle-aged male first-time Lidingöloppet race participants. Runners were assessed by medical history and physical exam, 12 -lead ECG, echocardiography, and blood tests. 9 % of runners required further diagnostic work-up and 2 % were discouraged from race participation due to cardiac abnormalities that could increase their risk of exercise- related cardiac events. Study III Heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) was continuously measured from 48 hours before until 96 hours after a Lidingöloppet 30 km race. Compared to pre-race values, HR was elevated during the night after the race while HRV remained depressed for 64 [51 - 96] hours after the race. A reduced HR recovery and a greater fall in HRV post race were associated with higher levels of high-sensitivity troponin T (hsTnT). Study IV The prevalence and associated cardiac features of ER, characterized by ST-segment elevation (STE) and/or J-waves, was investigated in 153 middle-aged males registered for first-time participation in the Lidingöloppet 10, 15 or 30 km race. ER was present in 40 % and generally associated with features of better cardiovascular fitness. The cardiovascular effects of participating in the 30 km race (n= 94) were also assessed after the race; runners with J-waves, but not with STE alone, showed changes of repolarisation parameters usually considered unfavourable (e. g. prolonged T peak-to-end (<b>Tpe)</b> and <b>QTc).</b> Conclusion This thesis demonstrated that increased participation in a long distance running event (Lidingöloppet) was paralleled by deteriorating runtimes. In middle-aged men, longer runtimes were associated with higher levels of NT-proBNP. These findings may raise concern regarding the fitness and cardiovascular health of some of today’s race participants. A comprehensive preparticipation evaluation identified 9 % of first- time runners needing additional work-up and 2 % who were ultimately discouraged from participating, suggesting that such a protocol is useful to identify individuals requiring further testing prior to vigorous exercise. After the race there was a prolonged depression of HRV. The magnitude and duration of HRV depression correlated with higher levels of hsTnT, suggesting that the degree of troponin (Tn) increase after strenuous exercise may reflect the level of exercise-induced cardiovascular stress. ER was generally associated with a benign cardiovascular profile, although subjects with J-waves showed post-race changes in some parameters of ventricular repolarisation that are usually associated with increased arrhythmia propensity. More research into the mechanisms and potential preventive measures of adverse exercise related effects on cardiac function is warranted...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundDomperidone {{has been}} widely used in {{children}} with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Studies {{on the effects of}} domperidone on corrected QT interval (QTc) in young children are limited. Our aim was to study the effect of domperidone on the repolarization abnormalities assessed by electrocardiogram (ECG) in young children. MethodsECG was performed in children < 2 years of age before and after taking domperidone orally 0. 3  mg/kg three times/day for at least a 1 week period. Each ECG was reviewed and QT, RR, and Tpeak to Tend intervals (TpTe) were measured to calculate the <b>QTc</b> and TpTe/QT <b>ratio.</b> ResultsA total of 22 patients (12 male) with a median age of 8. 5 months (1 – 24 months) were enrolled. Most patients (59. 1 %) were under 1 year of age. The median baseline QTc (410 milliseconds, 350 – 450 milliseconds) was not significantly different from the QTc after taking domperidone (410 milliseconds, 320 – 560 milliseconds), p =  0. 159. Only two patients showed a QTc increase ≥ 450 milliseconds. The baseline TpTe interval and TpTe/QT (105 milliseconds, 60 – 170 milliseconds and 0. 27 milliseconds, 0. 15 – 0. 43 milliseconds) were significantly greater than the TpTe interval and TpTe/QT in children after taking domperidone (90 milliseconds, 60 – 140 milliseconds and 0. 22 milliseconds, 0. 15 – 0. 29 milliseconds), p =  0. 001 and 0. 004, respectively. ConclusionsOur data demonstrate that domperidone treatment over a short-term period in children < 2 years of age did not lengthen QTc significantly; however, QTc increased ≥ 450 milliseconds in two patients with concomitant lansoprazole. Routine baseline and follow-up ECG may not be necessary in each individual case receiving only domperidone...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBackground During last decades, the {{knowledge}} in pathophysiological mechanisms of Brugada Syndrome improved. ICD implantation {{is the only}} effective treatment to decrease arrhythmic mortality in high-risk patients. Based on experimental and clinical data hydroquinidine {{seems to be a}} promising alternative for the management of ventricular arrhythmia and SCD but need to be evaluated. Methods Fifty patients were included in this French multicentric, randomised, double-blind study. Hydroquinidine or placebo treatment was given during two 18 months cross-over phases. Arrhythmic events, ECG parameters and clinical events were evaluated. Results Twenty-six (52 %) patients completed the study. Thirty-four (68 %) presented side effects, mainly gastrointestinal, related to hydroquinidine therapy in whom 13 had to stopped. One appropriate ICD shock, one ventricular fibrillation with self-resolution and one inappropriate ICD shock occurred in absence of hydroquinidine therapy. Not one of these event occurred under hydroquinidine. No statistical analysis has been done, regarding this low number of arrhythmic events. Hydroquinidine, at short (3 hours after first taking) or long-term, significantly lengthen QT interval, QTc (respectively 404 vs 417 sm and 409 vs 433 ms), Tpe and Tpe max (respectively 94, 8 vs 106, 6 ms and 89, 4 vs 107, 7 ms) without any change on J-point elevation nor Tpe/QTc <b>ratio.</b> <b>QTc</b> interval was significantly longer (433 vs 417 ms) during long than short-term treatment without any other effect on ECG parameters. Conclusion High rates of hydroquinidine side effects and low number of arrhythmic events give difficulties to conduct large studies to prove its efficiency in Brugada Syndrome. Hydroquinidine lengthens and increases the repolarisation dispersal, with electrocardiographic effects generally similar during short and long-term treatment. These considerations should not stop its use in daily clinical practice, especially for management of electrical storms.

40|$|Objectives. This study {{sought to}} {{identify}} risk factors for cardiac events (syncope, aborted cardiac arrest or sudden cardiac death) in family members of patients with the long QT syndrome. Background. Patients with the long QT syndrome {{are known to be}} at high risk for cardiac events. Whenever the first member of a family is identified as having the long QT syndrome (proband), there is concern regarding the likelihood of cardiac events in other family members. Methods. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to evaluate the risk of cardiac events in 637 family members who were first- and second-degree relatives of 151 probands with the long QT syndrome and in a subset of 513 family members who were not receiving beta-adrenergic blocking agents. There were 293 first-degree (46 %) and 344 second-degree relatives (54 %) (293 men [46 %], 344 women [54 %]). Fifty percent of the family members had a corrected QT interval (QTc) > 0. 44 s, and relative tachycardia and bradycardia were observed in 12 % and 25 %, respectively. Results. The risk of cardiac events occurring before age 40 in family members not taking beta-blockers was influenced by the <b>QTc</b> interval (odds <b>ratio</b> [OR] 1. 18 / 0. 01 increase in QTc value; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 12 to 1. 24), relative tachycardia (OR 2. 21, 95 % CI 0. 97 to 5. 02) or bradycardia (OR 2. 24, 95 % CI 1. 10 to 4. 56) and an interaction term combining gender and closeness of the relationship to the proband (OR for female first-degree relative 3. 23 vs. all second-degree relatives, 95 % CI 1. 67 – 6. 22). Conclusions. Female first-degree relatives of patients with the long QT syndrome have a higher risk of cardiac events than male first- or second-degree relatives, independent of recorded electrocardiographic findings. Not only bradycardia, but also tachycardia increases risk of cardiac events in family members of patients with the long QT syndrome...|$|R
40|$|The {{literature}} {{on the effect of}} excess thyroid hormone on ventricular repolarization is controversial. To study whether free thyroxine (T 4) and TSH are associated with QTc prolongation we conducted population-based cohort study. This study was conducted as part of the Rotterdam Study and included 365 men and 574 women aged 55 years and older with an electrocardiogram, who were randomly sampled for the assessment of thyroid status (free T 4 /TSH) at baseline, after exclusion of participants with hypothyroidism, use of antithyroid drugs, thyroid hormones or digoxin, left ventricular hypertrophy, and left and right bundle branch block. Endpoints were the length of the QTc interval and risk of borderline QTc prolongation. The associations were examined by means of linear and logistic regression analysis, adjusted for age and gender, diabetes mellitus, myocardial infarction, hypertension, and heart failure. Overall, there was no significant association between TSH and QTc interval (0. 8 ms (95 % confidence interval (Cl) - 3. 5, 5. 2) in the first quintile compared with the fifth quintile). Subjects in the fifth quintile of free T 4 did not have an increased QTc interval (3. 2 ms (95 % Cl - 1. 1, 7. 6)); stratification on gender showed an increment of 10. 9 ms (95 % Cl 3. 4, 18. 3) in the fifth quintile in men and 1. 1 ms (95 % Cl - 4. 2, 6. 3) in the fifth quintile of free T 4 in women. When compared with subjects in the first quintile, male subjects in the fifth quintile of free T 4 had a significantly increased risk of a borderline QTc interval and <b>QTc</b> prolongation (odds <b>ratio</b> 2. 40 (95 % Cl 1. 20, 4. 80)). High levels of free T 4 are associated with substantial QTc prolongation in men of up to 10 ms. The fact that free T 4 is also associated with a significantly increased risk of borderline and prolonged QTc values with its risk of sudden cardiac death, endorses the clinical importance of our findings...|$|R
