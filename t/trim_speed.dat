5000|$|The {{pitch control}} {{response}} is direct and very efficient. It is partially stabilized by {{the sweep of}} the wings. The wing centre of gravity {{is close to the}} hang point and, at the <b>trim</b> <b>speed,</b> the wing will fly [...] "hands off" [...] and return to trim after being disturbed. The weight-shift control system only works when the wing is positively loaded (right side up). Positive pitching devices such as reflex lines or washout rods are employed to maintain a minimum safe amount of washout when the wing is unloaded or even negatively loaded (upside down). Flying faster than <b>trim</b> <b>speed</b> is accomplished by moving the pilot's weight forward in the control frame; flying slower by shifting the pilot's weight aft (pushing out).|$|E

50|$|Most of {{the changes}} that the FIA have {{implemented}} to the regulations in the nine seasons since the year 2000 have been aimed at <b>trimming</b> <b>speed</b> off the cars and, later in the decade, at reducing the costs involved in Formula One. These have risen by a factor of between three and four for the top teams like Ferrari and McLaren. This sudden increase in budgets has largely been down to the influx of big spending car manufacturers setting up teams in the sport since Mercedes paved the way by buying 40% of the Mclaren team.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} reduce {{equipment}} wear and operator pressure, {{as well as to}} improve the production efficiency of combined continuous pickling line and tandem cold rolling mill units, four sections’ speeds should be automatically optimized to control the three loopers’ abundance, which include the entry loopers’ entry <b>speed,</b> pickling <b>speed,</b> <b>trimming</b> <b>speed,</b> and tandem cold rolling mill entry speed. According to the optimal speed principle, a new optimization algorithm was proposed based on objective function. In this work, Nelder–Mead simplex method is applied to find the optimal solution by minimizing the objective function. In addition, the calculation of four initial speeds is specified, especially the initial tandem cold rolling mill entry speed. The proposed speed optimization algorithm was successfully applied to a 1450 [*]mm continuous pickling line and tandem cold rolling mill. The acceleration and deceleration are smooth and steady when welding, trimming, or roll changing takes place in practice, the three loopers’ abundance are controlled in suitable range. Results show that the continuous pickling line unit could provide the material in maximum capacity to ensure that the tandem cold rolling mill unit’s production is efficient, and the rolling yield is greatly improved due to the {{decrease in the number of}} stops...|$|R

50|$|Sliding is {{the most}} {{effective}} braking technique for downhill skateboarders. It allows a skater to reduce his or her speed much quicker than footbraking, but requires a wider area depending on his ability to control the slide. It has also evolved into its own discipline of skateboarding, with riders performing various tricks and rotations while sliding. A few names of these slides include the coleman slide, bert slide, and pendelum. Sliding can be performed on any wheel. Harder wheels (83-86a) will slide less smoothly and break traction easier while softer wheels (70-80a) will be harder to break traction but will lead to a smoother more controllable slide. Softer wheels, especially (70-75a), tend to wear out faster. Slides can be done standing upright or with one or two hands placed on the road to allow the rider to execute technical slides in any number of positions. When performing hands-down slides, protective slide gloves must be worn. These gloves can be purchased or made at home. They are usually leather gloves with sliding pucks made of hard, low-friction plastics such as UHMWPE, Corian, or Delrin attached by velcro or glue. Sliding gloves can also be bought online or at local skate shops. Gloves are commonly made by companies such as Sector 9, Vault, Landyachtz, Arbor and Loaded. Slides can also be performed on banks and transitions in a skate park. When a skater slides to a complete stop, it is called a shutdown slide. A drift that reduces the rider's speed without bringing him to a complete stop is called a speed check. Riders will also do a partial slide called a pre-drift before a corner to <b>trim</b> <b>speed</b> and then hook back up and grip the corner. When the board rotates more than 90 degrees and then returns to its original position {{over the course of the}} slide it is called a pendulum. There are myriad more technical and challenging slides that can be done such as laybacks, pressure spins, 5-0 slides, and stand-up rotations. One of the most popular slide and most basic hands-down slide is called the Coleman. Made popular by Cliff Coleman, the Coleman slide {{is the most}} popular slide used to come to a complete stop, as you do a complete 180 degree turn with one hand on the ground.|$|E

40|$|Environmental {{issues such}} as the {{emission}} of greenhouse gases, pollution, wash and noise are having an increasing impact on the design and operation of ships. These environmental issues together with economic factors, such as rising fuel costs, all ultimately lead to the need to minimise ship propulsive power. Various methods and devices for reducing propulsive power are reviewed and discussed. The most favourable methods, from a feasible and practical point of view,are identified and quantified. It is found that potential reductions in the resistance of existing good hull forms are relatively small, but optimising hull-propeller-rudder interaction offers very promising prospects for improvement. The biggest potential savings in power arise from optimised operational strategies {{such as the use of}} optimum <b>trim,</b> <b>speed</b> and weather routeing.

40|$|A {{flight test}} was {{performed}} with the NASA Lewis Research Center's DH- 6 icing research aircraft. The purpose was to employ a flight test procedure and data analysis method, to determine the accuracy with which the effects of ice on aircraft stability and control could be measured. For simplicity, flight testing was restricted to the short period longitudinal mode. Two flights were flown in a clean (baseline) configuration, and two flights were flown with simulated horizontal tail ice. Forty-five repeat doublet maneuvers were performed in each of four test configurations, at a given <b>trim</b> <b>speed,</b> to determine the ensemble variation of the estimated stability and control derivatives. Additional maneuvers were also performed in each configuration, to determine the variation in the longitudinal derivative estimates {{over a wide range}} of trim speeds. Stability and control derivatives were estimated by a Modified Stepwise Regression (MSR) technique. A measure of the confidence in the derivative estimates was obtained by comparing the standard error for the ensemble of repeat maneuvers, to the average of the estimated standard errors predicted by the MSR program. A multiplicative relationship was determined between the ensemble standard error, and the averaged program standard errors. In addition, a 95 percent confidence interval analysis was performed for the elevator effectiveness estimates, C sub m sub delta e. This analysis identified the speed range where changes in C sub m sub delta e could be attributed to icing effects. The magnitude of icing effects on the derivative estimates were strongly dependent on flight speed and aircraft wing flap configuration. With wing flaps up, the estimated derivatives were degraded most at lower speeds corresponding to that configuration. With wing flaps extended to 10 degrees, the estimated derivatives were degraded most at the higher corresponding speeds. The effects of icing on the changes in longitudinal stability and control deriva...|$|E

40|$|The {{hydrodynamic}} {{characteristics of}} a flying-boat incorporating a low-drag, planing-tail hull were determined from model tests made in Langley tank number 2 and compared with tests of the same flying boat incorporating a conventional-type hull. The planing-tail model, with which stable take-offs were possible for a large range of elevator positions at all center-of-gravity locations tested, had more take-off stability than the conventional model. No upper-limit porpoising was encountered by the planing-tail model. The maximum changes in rise during landings were lower for the planing-tail model than for the conventional model at most contact trims, an indication of improved landing stability for the planing-tail model. The hydrodynamic resistance of the planing-tail hull was lower than the conventional hull at all speeds, and the load-resistance ratio was higher for the planing-tail hull, being especially high at the hump.

Usually, a proximity sensor precedes the trim brake in order to identify the current speed of the passing train. From this, the trim will then grab the train's brake fins to reduce the train's speed to that set by the control system.|$|R
