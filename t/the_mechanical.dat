The Universal Serial Bus Micro-USB Cables and Connectors Specification details <b>the</b> <b>mechanical</b> characteristics of Micro-A plugs, Micro-AB receptacles (which accept both Micro-A and Micro-B plugs), and Micro-B plugs and receptacles, along with a standard-A receptacle to Micro-A plug adapter.|$|E
5|$|The {{frequency}} response behaviour of all mechanical filters {{can be expressed}} as an equivalent electrical circuit using the impedance analogy described above. An {{example of this is}} shown in figure 8b which is the equivalent circuit of <b>the</b> <b>mechanical</b> filter of figure 8a. Elements on the electrical side, such as the inductance of the magnetostrictive transducer, are omitted but would be taken into account in a complete design. The series resonant circuits on the circuit diagram represent the torsional resonators, and the shunt capacitors represent the coupling wires. The component values of the electrical equivalent circuit can be adjusted, more or less at will, by modifying the dimensions of <b>the</b> <b>mechanical</b> components. In this way, all the theoretical tools of electrical analysis and filter design can be brought to bear on <b>the</b> <b>mechanical</b> design. Any filter realisable in electrical theory can, in principle, also be realised as a mechanical filter. In particular, the popular finite element approximations to an ideal filter response of the Butterworth and Chebyshev filters can both readily be realised. As with the electrical counterpart, the more elements that are used, the closer the approximation approaches the ideal, however, for practical reasons the number of resonators does not normally exceed eight.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>mechanical</b> {{properties}} {{of iron and}} its alloys can be evaluated {{using a variety of}} tests, including the Brinell test, Rockwell test and the Vickers hardness test. The data on iron is so consistent that it is often used to calibrate measurements or to compare tests. However, <b>the</b> <b>mechanical</b> {{properties of}} iron are significantly affected by the sample's purity: pure, single crystals of iron are actually softer than aluminium, and the purest industrially produced iron (99.99%) has a hardness of 20–30Brinell. An increase in the carbon content will cause {{a significant increase in the}} hardness and tensile strength of iron. Maximum hardness of 65 Rc is achieved with a 0.6% carbon content, although the alloy has low tensile strength. Because of the softness of iron, it is much easier to work with than its heavier congeners ruthenium and osmium.|$|E

5|$|An early {{application}} of these new theoretical tools was in phonographic sound reproduction. A recurring problem with early phonograph designs was that mechanical resonances in the pickup and sound transmission mechanism caused excessively large peaks and troughs in the frequency response, resulting in poor sound quality. In 1923, Harrison of the Western Electric Company filed a patent for a phonograph in which <b>the</b> <b>mechanical</b> design was entirely represented as an electrical circuit. The horn of the phonograph is represented as a transmission line, and is a resistive load {{for the rest of}} the circuit, while all <b>the</b> <b>mechanical</b> and acoustic parts—from the pickup needle through to the horn—are translated into lumped components according to the impedance analogy. The circuit arrived at is a ladder topology of series resonant circuits coupled by shunt capacitors. This can be viewed as a bandpass filter circuit. Harrison designed the component values of this filter to have a specific passband corresponding to the desired audio passband (in this case 100Hz to 6kHz) and a flat response. Translating these electrical element values back into mechanical quantities provided specifications for <b>the</b> <b>mechanical</b> components in terms of mass and stiffness, which in turn could be translated into physical dimensions for their manufacture. The resulting phonograph has a flat frequency response in its passband and is free of the resonances previously experienced. Shortly after this, Harrison filed another patent using the same methodology on telephone transmit and receive transducers.|$|E

5|$|The scheme {{presented}} in the table {{is known as the}} impedance analogy. Circuit diagrams produced using this analogy match the electrical impedance of <b>the</b> <b>mechanical</b> system seen by the electrical circuit, making it intuitive from an electrical engineering standpoint. There is also the mobility analogy, in which force corresponds to current and velocity corresponds to voltage. This has equally valid results but requires using the reciprocals of the electrical counterparts listed above. Hence, M → C, S → 1/L, D → G where G is electrical conductance, the inverse of resistance. Equivalent circuits produced by this scheme are similar, but are the dual impedance forms whereby series elements become parallel, capacitors become inductors, and so on. Circuit diagrams using the mobility analogy more closely match <b>the</b> <b>mechanical</b> arrangement of the circuit, making it more intuitive from a mechanical engineering standpoint. In addition to their application to electromechanical systems, these analogies are widely used to aid analysis in acoustics.|$|E
