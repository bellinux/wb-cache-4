5|$|Some {{philosophers}} take an epistemic {{approach and}} argue that the mind–body problem is currently unsolvable, and perhaps will always remain unsolvable to human beings. This is usually termed New mysterianism. Colin McGinn holds <b>that</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> <b>are</b> cognitively closed in regards to their own minds. According to McGinn human minds lack the concept-forming procedures to fully grasp how mental properties such as consciousness arise from their causal basis. An example would be how an elephant is cognitively closed in regards to particle physics.|$|E
5|$|Scholars {{have found}} it {{extremely}} difficult to assign one specific, overarching theme to the play. Proposals for a main theme include a discovery by the characters <b>that</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> <b>are</b> neither wholly good nor wholly evil, but instead {{are more or less}} alike, awaking out of a dream and into reality, the danger of hasty action, or the power of tragic fate. None of these have widespread support. However, even if an overall theme cannot be found {{it is clear that the}} play is full of several small, thematic elements that intertwine in complex ways. Several of those most often debated by scholars are discussed below.|$|E

25|$|The idea <b>that</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> <b>are</b> {{rational}} and human behavior {{is guided by}} reason is an old one. However, recent research (on satisficing for example) has significantly undermined the idea of homo economicus or of perfect rationality in favour of a more bounded rationality. The field of behavioural economics is particularly concerned with the limits of rationality in economic agents.|$|E
25|$|Kierkegaard's {{analysis}} of the present age uses terms that resemble but are not exactly coincident with Hegel and Marx's theory of alienation. However Kierkegaard expressly means <b>that</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> <b>are</b> alienated from God because they are living {{too much in the}} world. Individuals need to gain their souls from the world because it actually belongs to God. Kierkegaard has no interest in external battles as Karl Marx does. His concern is about the inner fight for faith.|$|E
25|$|One study {{looked at}} the root of the hot-hand fallacy as being from an {{inability}} to appropriately judge sequences. The study compiled research from dozens of behavioral and cognitive studies that examined the hot-hand and gambler's fallacies with random mechanisms and skill-generated streaks. In terms of judging random sequences the general conclusion was that people do not have a statistically correct concept of random. It concluded <b>that</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> <b>are</b> built to see patterns in sensory and conceptual data of all types.|$|E

25|$|Hermeneutic {{theorists and}} {{therapists}} write that ontological hermeneutics is ideally situated {{to address this}} limitation of individualism because it upholds from the outset <b>that</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> <b>are</b> relational and it attempts to explain human suffering and healing in these relational contexts. What ontological hermeneutics theory is saying {{is that it is}} not through isolated reflection upon personal cognitive and affective processes that heals psychological suffering. Instead, it is being-in-the-world and relating authentically to others through dialogue that provides a nexus of healthy, meaningful relationships that alleviates human suffering and promotes a sense of the good life for Dasein.|$|E
25|$|Sociobiological {{research}} is particularly controversial {{with regard to}} its application to humans. The theory established a scientific argument for rejecting the common doctrine of tabula rasa, which holds <b>that</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> <b>are</b> born without any innate mental content and that culture functions to increase human knowledge and aid in survival and success. In the final chapter of the book Sociobiology and in {{the full text of}} his Pulitzer Prize-winning On Human Nature, Wilson argues, that the human mind is shaped as much by genetic inheritance as it is by culture if not more. There are limits on just how much influence social and environmental factors can have in altering human behavior.|$|E
25|$|Sufi {{psychology}} {{has influenced}} {{many areas of}} thinking {{both within and outside}} of Islam, drawing primarily upon three concepts. Ja'far al-Sadiq (both an imam in the Shia tradition and a respected scholar and link in chains of Sufi transmission in all Islamic sects) held <b>that</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> <b>are</b> dominated by a lower self called the nafs (soul), a faculty of spiritual intuition called the qalb (heart), and ruh (spirit). These interact in various ways, producing the spiritual types of the tyrant (dominated by nafs), the person of faith and moderation (dominated by the spiritual heart), and the person lost in love for God (dominated by the ruh).|$|E

25|$|Information: People do {{the general}} house {{cleaning}} (Ōsōji) to welcome coming year {{and not to}} keep having impure influences. Many people visit Buddhist temples to hear the temple bells rung 108 times at midnight (joya no kane). This is to announce {{the passing of the}} old year and the coming of the new. The reason they are rung 108 times is because of the Buddhist belief <b>that</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> <b>are</b> plagued by 108 earthly desires or passions (bonnō). With each ring one desire is dispelled. It is also a custom to eat toshikoshi-soba in the hope that one's family fortunes will extend like the long noodles.|$|E
25|$|Put otherwise, {{mainstream}} theories rarely, if at all, {{acknowledge that}} it is through relationships, via Dasein's inescapable relational nature, that symptoms and client needs emerge, therefore inadvertently limiting their ability to explain the emergence of said symptoms and needs {{in the life of}} the client. Furthermore, this causes psychotherapy to perpetuate the paradigm <b>that</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> <b>are</b> highly autonomous individuals responding primarily to cognitive reason, taking them out of their relational contexts in the world and limiting human beings to find healing purely from within. Ontological hermeneutics theory states that this kind of relational de-contextualizing actually leads to a form of individualism that is inauthentic and can also result in interpersonal problems that cause human suffering because the individual is ultimately collapsing into an empty self.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{one answer}} from modern science to give. What the {{original}} question now means indeed depends on choosing genus or species in the required answer. It is thought that the genus of man {{has been around for}} ten times as long as our species. Currently, fresh examples of (extinct) species of the genus Homo are still being discovered, so that definitive answers are not available. The consensus view is <b>that</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> <b>are</b> one species, the only existing species of the genus. With the rejection of polygenism for human origins, it is asserted that this species had a definite and single origin in the past. (That assertion leaves aside the point whether the origin meant is of the current species, however. The multiregional hypothesis allows the origin to be otherwise.) The hypothesis of recent African origin of modern humans is now widely accepted, and states that anatomically modern humans had a single origin, in Africa.|$|E

25|$|See also: D. H. Th. Vollenhoven. Developed {{from earlier}} secular traditions, modern Humanist ethical philosophies affirmed {{the dignity and}} worth of all people, based {{on the ability to}} {{determine}} right and wrong by appealing to universal human qualities, particularly rationality, without resorting to the supernatural or alleged divine authority from religious texts. For liberal humanists such as Rousseau and Kant, the universal law of reason guided the way toward total emancipation from any kind of tyranny. These ideas were challenged, for example by the young Karl Marx, who criticized the project of political emancipation (embodied in the form of human rights), asserting it to be symptomatic of the very dehumanization it was supposed to oppose. For Friedrich Nietzsche, humanism {{was nothing more than a}} secular version of theism. In his Genealogy of Morals, he argues that human rights exist as a means for the weak to collectively constrain the strong. On this view, such rights do not facilitate emancipation of life, but rather deny it. In the 20th century, the notion <b>that</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> <b>are</b> rationally autonomous was challenged by the concept that humans were driven by unconscious irrational desires.|$|E
25|$|The dialogical part of ontological hermeneutics {{states that}} Dasein co-creates meaning from his self-interpretations and {{subjective}} experiences {{through the process}} of dialogue, i.e. conversing with others. Human beings are constantly engaged in dialogue with others and their world around them. Macmurray postulated that dialogue is our primary, if not only, source of knowledge. Bakhtin claimed <b>that</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> <b>are</b> more than beings who engage in dialogue, but that they are dialogical beings composed of multiple simultaneous voices: voices that are their own and voices that belong to others. These voices represent who Dasein is, his or her dispositions, and his or her roles in society. In this case, the term voice is meant to signify a particular role Dasein takes up or a particular aspect of who Dasein is. These voices of human beings are not {{to be thought of as}} hallucinated voices, as in psychosis, but rather different elements of who Dasein is: I like Italian food as one voice and I do not like it when people interrupt me as another voice, or I am a therapist as one voice but I am a patient when I visit my primary care physician as another. That is not to say that these voices determine Dasein's actions or behaviors. On the contrary, Dasein is an agentic being (a being capable of choice) who thinks, acts, and chooses for himself. But this process “emerges through conversations among functionally independent elements within persons” (Lysaker & Lysaker: 2). The emergence of these multiple voices within us via multitudes of ongoing conversations with others is why Bakhtin described us as polyphonic beings, or “products of ongoing series of dialogues among distinct voices” (Lysaker & Lysaker: 2).|$|E
25|$|Kovel {{highlights}} {{the fact that}} Marx mentioned the idea when he stated <b>that</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> <b>are</b> {{no more than the}} planet’s “usufructaries, and, like boni patres familias, they must hand it down to succeeding generations in an improved condition”. Kovel has taken on this reading, asserting that, in an eco-socialist society, “everyone will have... rights of use and ownership over those means of production necessary to express the creativity of human nature”, namely “a place of one’s own” to decorate to personal taste, some personal possessions, the body and its attendant sexual and reproductive rights. However, Kovel sees property as “self-contradictory” because individuals emerge “in a tissue of social relations” and “nested circles”, with the self at the centre and extended circles where “issues of sharing arise from early childhood on”. He believes that “the full self is enhanced more by giving than by taking” and that eco-socialism is realized when material possessions weigh “lightly” upon the self – thus restoration of use-value allows things to be taken “concretely and sensuously” but “lightly, since things are enjoyed for themselves and not as buttresses for a shaky ego”. This, for Kovel, reverses what Marxists see as the commodity fetishism and atomization of individuals (through the “unappeasable craving” for “having and excluding others from having”) under capitalism. Under eco-socialism, he therefore believes that enhancement of use-value will lead to differentiated ownership between the individual and the collective, where there are “distinct limits on the amount of property individuals control” and no-one can take control of resources that “would permit the alienation of means of production from another”. He then hopes that the “hubris” of the notion of “ownership of the planet” will be replaced with usufruct.|$|E

500|$|The novella {{explores the}} {{isolation}} {{brought on by}} space travel, as well as themes of religion and utopia. It contains elements of ecocriticism, or {{a critique of the}} idea <b>that</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> <b>are</b> altogether separate from their natural environment. The novella and the collections it was published in received high praise from commentators. For its generation ship setting and examination of utopia, critics compared it to other Le Guin works such as [...] "Newton's Sleep", and The Telling, {{as well as to the}} works of Gene Wolfe and Molly Gloss.

500|$|Literature scholar Tonia Payne {{has written}} that [...] "Paradises Lost" [...] {{is an example of}} ecocriticism, wherein Le Guin critiques the idea <b>that</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> <b>are</b> {{separate}} from their natural environment. The premise of the novella involves human beings who live their entire lives on a ship in interstellar space, and who therefore have to create a new reality for themselves, a notion also explored in Le Guin's short story [...] "Newton's Sleep". The inhabitants of Discovery become unable to relate to representations of Earth. Some, like Hsing and Luis, still try to understand Ti Chiu, keeping in mind their position {{as a part of a}} continuum of people supposed to colonize a new planet. For others, this new reality takes the form of the religious beliefs of the cult of Bliss. These beliefs are portrayed as an understandable attempt to adjust to the reality of spaceflight. A review by Publishers Weekly identified a similar theme, common to the other stories in the [...] "Birthday of the World" [...] collection, of characters coming to terms with the world they live in.|$|E
