25|$|The <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>errors</b> may {{be traced}} back to Roger Cotes's Opera Miscellanea (posthumous, 1722), but a memoir {{prepared}} by Thomas Simpson in 1755 (printed 1756) first applied the theory to the discussion of errors of observation. The reprint (1757) of this memoir lays down the axioms that positive and negative errors are equally probable, and that certain assignable limits define the range of all errors. Simpson also discusses continuous errors and describes a probability curve.|$|E
25|$|The {{classical}} Advaita Vedanta explains all {{reality and}} everything in the experienced world to be same as the Brahman. To Advaitins, there is a unity in multiplicity, {{and there is no}} dual hierarchy of a Creator and the created universe. All objects, all experiences, all matter, all consciousness, all awareness, in Advaita philosophy is not the property but the very nature of this one fundamental reality Brahman. With this premise, the Advaita school states that any ontological effort must presuppose a knowing self, and this effort needs to explain all empirical experiences such as the projected reality while one dreams during sleep, and the observed multiplicity of living beings. This Advaita does by positing its theory of three levels of reality, the theory of two truths, and by developing and integrating these ideas with its <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>errors</b> (anirvacaniya khyati).|$|E

40|$|The present work {{analyses}} the <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>error</b> <b>of</b> René Descartes, {{mainly in}} the context of his Fourth Meditation. This analyze begins with the exposition <b>of</b> the Descartes' <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> judgment and his notions of understanding and volition. The main question is the following: Is Descartes' <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>error</b> valid, even if we consider all the objections of Descartes' critics? The maill objection is: in the explication <b>of</b> <b>error</b> during our judgment as a result of interaction between a limited understanding and an unlimited human will, we have to consider us capable do decide at will what we believe and what we don't, which is not an intuitive position. But this work suggests that this non-intuitive position is sustainable, if we abandon the "strong" version of Descartes' voluntarism, in which the will influences our believes directly, and we see Descartes' <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>error</b> as using the "milder" version of voluntarism (called here "attention" voluntarism), in which the will influence us indirectly, by forcing our attention in the needed way. As a final conclusion, we consider Descartes' <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>error</b> as valid...|$|R

In this way, Lambert quantified purely visual properties (such as luminous power, illumination, transparency, reflectivity) by relating them to physical parameters (such as distance, angle, radiant power, and color).

40|$|Abstract: The {{distribution}} <b>of</b> observation <b>errors</b> {{is determined}} {{according to their}} magnitudes by using the distribution collocation test method or figure method {{taking into account the}} result, sample total, the interval density etc. It is therefore difficult to get the specific type <b>of</b> <b>error</b> distribution <b>of</b> observations by conventional methods. In analyzing the actual situation <b>of</b> the observation <b>error</b> distribution using their statistical properties, this paper proposes the use of unsymmetrical distribution to express the true distribution <b>of</b> the observation <b>errors.</b> The P-norm distribution is a generalized form of a group <b>of</b> <b>error</b> distributions, and from the statistical properties <b>of</b> random <b>errors</b> we can arrive at an unsymmetrical P-norm distribution according to the practical situation of the occurrence <b>of</b> random <b>errors.</b> The common P-norm distribution is the specific case of this distribution. This paper deduces the density function equation of the unsymmetrical P-norm distribution, obtained the statistical properties of the distribution function and the evaluation of precision index. By choosing appropriate value for p, we can get closer to the distribution function <b>of</b> the true <b>error</b> distribution. In the <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>error</b> distribution, Gauss once deduced that accidental errors obey the normal distribution which used in analyzing the <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>error</b> distribution has many excellent properties...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relation between}} errors and awareness in two recent <b>theories</b> <b>of</b> <b>error</b> detection in speech: Perceptual Loop theory and Node Structure theory. New data and predictions are discussed. together with some nonobvious limitations <b>of</b> these <b>theories.</b> New paradigms for studying speech error detection are also discussed. together with implications for current <b>theories</b> <b>of</b> the large body <b>of</b> work on <b>error</b> detection in related skills such as reading, typing, and handwriting. © 1992 Academic Press. Inc. Awareness is a central concept for <b>theories</b> <b>of</b> <b>error</b> detection, which must explain why speakers detect some <b>of</b> their <b>errors,</b> but not others. Moreover, <b>theories</b> <b>of</b> awareness must account for a readily observed relation between errors and awareness: Some aspects of speech processing that normally do not enter awareness do so following a self-produced error. For example, speakers do not {{become aware of the}} duration of fricatives such as Ishl during normal, error-free speech production, but do so when they make a phonetic error, producing, e. g., a slurred or longer-than-normal Ishl, and may even become aware of higher level (pragmatic) implications <b>of</b> such <b>errors,</b> say, inadvisability <b>of</b> driving a car (see MacKay, 1990). This special relation between errors and awareness is nontrivial: Detection and correction <b>of</b> <b>errors</b> could in principle occur without awareness, but as Levelt (1989, p. 21) points out, "self-corrections are hardly ever made without a touch of awareness. " Explaining this special relation between errors and awareness presents a clear challenge for <b>theories</b> <b>of</b> awareness and <b>error</b> detection alike.
