25|$|The {{conclusions}} of many trials and numerous systematic reviews of acupuncture are largely inconsistent. An overview of Cochrane reviews found that acupuncture is not effective {{for a wide}} range of conditions. A systematic review of systematic reviews found little evidence of acupuncture's effectiveness in <b>treating</b> <b>pain.</b> The evidence suggests that short-term treatment with acupuncture does not produce long-term benefits. Some research results suggest acupuncture can alleviate pain, though the majority of research suggests that acupuncture's effects are mainly due to the placebo effect. A systematic review concluded that the analgesic effect of acupuncture seemed to lack clinical relevance and could not be clearly distinguished from bias. A meta-analysis found that acupuncture for chronic low back pain was cost-effective as an adjunct to standard care, while a systematic review found insufficient evidence for the cost-effectiveness of acupuncture in the treatment of chronic low back pain.|$|E
25|$|Tianeptine {{has been}} {{reported}} to be very effective for asthma. In August 1998, Dr. Fuad Lechin and colleagues at the Central University of Venezuela Institute of Experimental Medicine in Caracas published the results of a 52-week randomized controlled trial of asthmatic children; the children in the groups that received tianeptine had a sharp decrease in clinical rating and increased lung function. Two years earlier, they had found a close, positive association between free serotonin in plasma and severity of asthma in symptomatic persons. As tianeptine was the only agent known to both reduce free serotonin in plasma and enhance uptake in platelets, they decided to use it to see if reducing free serotonin levels in plasma would help. By November 2004, there had been two double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trials and a >25,000 person open-label study lasting over seven years, all showing effectiveness. A 2005 study in Egypt demonstrated tianeptine to be effective in men with depression and erectile dysfunction. Tianeptine also has anticonvulsant and analgesic effects, and a clinical trial in Spain that ended in January 2007 has shown that tianeptine is effective in <b>treating</b> <b>pain</b> due to fibromyalgia. Tianeptine has been shown to have efficacy with minimal side effects in the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.|$|E

2500|$|The {{classical}} International Association for the Study of Pain {{definition of}} pain [...] as a subjective, emotional {{experience that is}} {{described in terms of}} tissue damage, depends on the sufferer being able to self-report pain, which is little use in diagnosing and <b>treating</b> <b>pain</b> in babies. More significant are non-verbal responses, of which there are two kinds: gross physical movements and physiological response measurements. The former are simple direct observation, while the latter requires specific equipment to monitor blood pressure and stress hormone levels.|$|E
2500|$|Toward {{the middle}} 20th century, {{the use of}} opiates was {{generally}} limited {{to the treatment of}} pain, and opium was no longer a medically accepted [...] "cure-all". [...] Further, the pharmaceutical industry began synthesizing various opioids, such as propoxyphene, oxymorphone and oxycodone. [...] These synthetic opioids, along with codeine and morphine were preferable to laudanum since a single opioid could be prescribed for different types of pain rather than the [...] "cocktail" [...] of laudanum, which contains nearly all of the opium alkaloids. [...] Consequently, laudanum became mostly obsolete as an analgesic, since its principal ingredient is morphine, which can be prescribed by itself to treat pain. [...] Until now, there has been no medical consensus on which of the two (laudanum or morphine alone) is the better choice for <b>treating</b> <b>pain.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Given {{its high}} {{concentration}} of morphine, opium tincture is useful for treating moderate to severe pain. (The amount of codeine in the tincture is negligible and {{does not have any}} appreciable analgesic effect.) The dose of tincture is generally {{the same as that of}} morphine in opioid-na√Øve patients, titrated upward as needed. The usual starting dose in adults is 1.5mL by mouth every 3 to 4 hours, representing the equivalent of 15mg (approximately 1/4 grain) of morphine per dose. Opioid-tolerant patients may require higher than normal dosing. For the opioid tolerant patient, doses in the range of 3-6 mL every 3-4 hours would be usual. [...] This would represent an equivalent daily dose of between 180mg and 480mg of morphine. There is a danger of overdose in <b>treating</b> <b>pain</b> with opium tincture; see below.|$|E
