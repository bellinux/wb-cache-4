Her chief causes appear to have all been {{connected}} specifically to the assistance and welfare of women. She was president of the Scottish Home Industries Association, a charity which encouraged Scottish women to work profitably from home making plaid or other items of needlework and the like. In this way women, especially widowed mothers, remained in their homes able <b>to</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> often large families while still earning an income.|$|E

40|$|A dilemma confronts physician-investigators in {{the conduct}} of {{research}} with patient-subjects. As physicians they are dedicated <b>to</b> <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> patients, healing their pain, reducing their suffering. As investigators they are dedicated <b>to</b> <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> research, advancing knowledge for the benefit of science and future patients. These two commitments conflict whenever an individual physician-investigator comes face to face with an individual patient-subject. Indeed, in this encounter between two persons, four personae confront one another: the physician, the investigator, the patient in need of immediate help, and the subject who may himself be helped or who may help future patients...|$|R

The eldest is Sunday, who is a victim of one of Elspeth's spells that has left half of him as a garden gnome. The dwarfs allow Snow White <b>to</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> home, though the dwarf Wednesday is initially suspicious. When Elspeth learns that Snow White is still alive, she prepares a poisoned apple and transforms into Josephine, Snow White's deceased mother, with the magic mirror the Green-Eyed One gave her. Aided by Monday, who is turned into a garden gnome afterward, Elspeth, disguised as Josephine, finds her and convinces her to eat the enchanted and poisoned apple, which seemingly kills Snow White.|$|E

40|$|This essay {{investigates the}} demands on adult {{children}} <b>to</b> provide <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> elderly/ill parents from a socio-moral perspective. In order to narrow the examination, the question pursued here is agent-relative: What social and moral complexities are involved for the adult child when her parent(s) need care? First, this article examines our society’s expectation that adult children are morally obligated <b>to</b> provide <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> parents. Second, the essay articulates how transgressing against this normative expectation can inure significant moral criticism. The final sections present these tensions {{within the context of}} disability...|$|R
5|$|The {{economic}} impact of the common cold is not well understood in much of the world. In the United States, the common cold leads to 75–100 million physician visits annually at a conservative cost estimate of $7.7 billion per year. Americans spend $2.9 billion on over-the-counter drugs and another $400 million on prescription medicines for symptom relief. More than one-third of people who saw a doctor received an antibiotic prescription, which has implications for antibiotic resistance. An estimated 22–189 million school days are missed annually due to a cold. As a result, parents missed 126 million workdays to stay home <b>to</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> children. When added to the 150 million workdays missed by employees suffering from a cold, the total {{economic impact}} of cold-related work loss exceeds $20 billion per year. This accounts for 40% of time lost from work in the United States.|$|E
5|$|In August 1907, MacArthur {{was sent}} to the {{engineer}} district office in Milwaukee, where his parents were living. In April 1908, he was posted to Fort Leavenworth, where he was given his first command, Company K, 3rd Engineer Battalion. He became battalion adjutant in 1909 and then engineer officer at Fort Leavenworth in 1910. MacArthur was promoted to captain in February 1911 and was appointed as head of the Military Engineering Department and the Field Engineer School. He participated in exercises at San Antonio, Texas, with the Maneuver Division in 1911 and served in Panama on detached duty in January and February 1912. The sudden death of their father on 5 September 1912 brought Douglas and his brother Arthur back to Milwaukee <b>to</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> mother, whose health had deteriorated. MacArthur requested a transfer to Washington, D.C. so his mother could be near Johns Hopkins Hospital. Army Chief of Staff, Major General Leonard Wood, took up the matter with Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, who arranged for MacArthur to be posted to the Office of the Chief of Staff in 1912.|$|E
5|$|On 1 August, the Scottish Parliament met {{to settle}} {{religious}} issues. Knox {{and five other}} ministers were called upon {{to draw up a}} new confession of faith. Within four days, the Scots Confession was presented to Parliament, voted upon, and approved. A week later, the Parliament passed three acts in one day: the first abolished the jurisdiction of the Pope in Scotland, the second condemned all doctrine and practice contrary to the reformed faith, and the third forbade the celebration of Mass in Scotland. Before the dissolution of Parliament, Knox and the other ministers were given the task of organising the newly reformed church or the Kirk. They would work for several months on the Book of Discipline, the document describing the organisation of the new church. During this period, in December 1560, Knox's wife, Margery, died, leaving Knox <b>to</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> two sons, aged three and a half and two years old. John Calvin, who had lost his own wife in 1549, wrote a letter of condolence.|$|E

25|$|Christian {{practice}} {{and attitudes toward}} medicine drew on Jewish, Greek, and Middle Eastern influences.

Temporary medical assistance had been provided in classical Greece for visitors to festivals and the tradition extended through the Roman Empire, especially after Christianity became the state religion prior to the empire's decline. In the early Medieval period, hospitals, poor houses, hostels, and orphanages began to spread from the Middle East, each {{with the intention of}} helping those most in need.|$|E

50|$|For parents, an {{increase}} in access to reliable water resources reduces vulnerability to shocks, which allows for increased livelihood security and for families to allocate a greater portion of <b>their</b> resources <b>to</b> <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> children. This means improved nutrition for children, a reduction in school days missed due to health issues, and greater flexibility to spend resources on providing for the direct costs associated with sending children to school. And if families escape forced migration due to water scarcity, children's educational potential is even further improved with better stability and uninterrupted school attendance.|$|R

25|$|Thailand has {{observed}} global patterns of an enlarging elderly class: as fertility control is encouraged and medical advances are made, births shrink and lives age. The Thai government is noticing {{and concerned about}} this trend, but tends to let families care for their elderly members rather than create extraneous policies for them. As of 2011, there are only 25 state sponsored homes for the elderly, {{with no more than}} a few thousand members of each home. Such programs are largely run by volunteers and are questionable by quality of care, considering there is not always a guarantee care will be available. Private care is tough to follow, often based on assumptions. Because children are less likely <b>to</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> parents, private caretakers are in demand. Volunteer NGOs are available but in very limited quantities.|$|E
25|$|PHRs {{have the}} {{potential}} to help analyze an individual’s health profile and identify health threats and improvement opportunities based on an analysis of drug interaction, current best medical practices, gaps in current medical care plans, and identification of medical errors. Patient illnesses can be tracked in conjunction with healthcare providers and early interventions can be promoted upon encountering deviation of health status. PHRs also make it easier for clinicians <b>to</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> patients by facilitating continuous communication as opposed to episodic. Eliminating communication barriers and allowing documentation flow between patients and clinicians in a timely fashion can save time consumed by face-to-face meetings and telephone communication. Improved communication can also ease the process for patients and caregivers to ask questions, to set up appointments, to request refills and referrals, and to report problems. Additionally, {{in the case of an}} emergency a PHR can quickly provide critical information to proper diagnosis or treatment.|$|E

25|$|Polygyny {{in birds}} occurs {{infrequently}} {{when compared to}} mammals, as monogamy is most commonly observed. Evolutionarily speaking, polygyny in birds might have evolved because many females do not require male support <b>to</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> offspring. Because females do not need extra help raising their nests, males can afford to invest in multiple females. Nonetheless, male parental care is often found in many polygynous territorial bird species, leading to female competition for male assistance. Most often, males will seek a second female to impregnate, once the first female has laid her eggs. Strongly polygynous or monogamous species display increased female-female aggression. Many factors affect female aggression including predator density, habitat quality, nest spacing, and territory size. Oftentimes females will fight for resources from the male, such as food and nest protection. The female disadvantages of mating with an already-mated male bird can be overcome with ample resources provided by the male, resulting in female choice.|$|E
25|$|When {{sales of}} the Sylvia Stretcher declined, Kenny {{returned}} to home nursing. During one of her sales journeys, she met a family who arranged for her to visit their station west of Townsville in 1929 <b>to</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> niece Maude, who was disabled by polio. After 18 months under Kenny's care, Maude was able to walk, return to Townsville, marry and conceive a child. The newspapers in Townsville took up the story, referring {{to it as a}} cure. In 1932, Queensland suffered its highest number of polio cases in 30 years; the following year, several local people helped Kenny set up a rudimentary polio-treatment facility under canopies behind the Queens Hotel in Townsville. In a few months (after further success with local children), she moved into the bottom floor of the hotel. The first official evaluation of Sister Kenny's work took place in Townsville in 1934, {{under the auspices of the}} Queensland Health Department (QHD). This evaluation of her work led to the establishment of Kenny clinics in several cities in Australia. The Sister Kenny Clinic in the Outpatients Building of the Rockhampton Base Hospital is now listed on the Queensland Heritage Register.|$|E
