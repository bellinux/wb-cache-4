5|$|The {{automobile}} unions {{played a}} leading role in advancing the cause of women's rights. In 1955, <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>Auto</b> Workers Union (UAW) organized the UAW Women's Department to strengthen women's role in the union and encourage participation in the union's elected bodies. In a move that was met with some hostility by Teamsters leaders, the U.S. Division of Transport Personnel had in 1943 instructed Teamsters Union officials that women should be allowed full employment as truck drivers. That proved to be only a temporary wartime measure, but a change of heart among Teamsters leadership by the mid-1950s led to the Equal Pay Act of 1963. Women in the auto industry were considered leaders in the movement for women's rights.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, a Flint-area {{politician}} {{wanted to}} dedicate a highway after <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>Auto</b> Workers (UAW). As a result, the David Dunbar Buick Freeway name was moved off I-475 {{and applied to}} I-69 in Flint. The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) approved {{the extension of the}} I-69 designation eastward in 1983 so that it would terminate at the international boundary at Port Huron; this approval was contingent on construction of the roadway to Interstate Highway standards and other appropriate approvals at the federal government level. The remaining segment of freeway connecting Lapeer with Wadhams opened in 1984 as I-69 and several additional changes were made to the highway system at the same time. M-21 was shortened to Flint and replaced M-56 through the city. The former route of M-21 in Port Huron became BLI-69, and the remainder of that highway was turned back to local control. The I-69 designation was officially extended once more under Congressional legislation on February 10, 1987; this last extension designated I-69 all the way to I-94 in Port Huron to reflect the 1984 openings.|$|E
