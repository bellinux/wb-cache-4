5000|$|Instead, the Court {{pointed out}} that the DMCA {{provisions}} only require that <b>the</b> service provider <b>terminate</b> <b>the</b> account of a repeat infringer when appropriate. The crutch to this provision centers on the service provider's requirement that it knows of <b>the</b> <b>infringement.</b> Were courts to extend that duty beyond the text, it would hinder the policies of Congress. [...] Indeed, another United States District Court had previously found that [...] "the DMCA requires reasonable, not perfect, policies...." [...] As such, Veoh's policy of tracking infringing content was enough to satisfy the initial threshold requirement.|$|R

5000|$|Statutory damages are {{available}} {{as an alternative}} to actual damages and profits. If the copyright was registered either (a) within three months of publication or (b) before <b>the</b> <b>infringement,</b> then <b>the</b> plaintiff is eligible to seek statutory damages.

50|$|The saisie-contrefaçon is {{generally}} decisive {{in the success}} or failure of <b>the</b> action for <b>infringement.</b> If it is correctly performed and cannot be challenged or remains unchallenged, it will provide evidence of an <b>infringement</b> for which <b>the</b> judge ruling on the merits in <b>the</b> <b>infringement</b> proceedings cannot but pronounce civil or criminal sanctions, thereby ensuring the success of the holder of the intellectual property right over the infringer. If it is incorrectly performed, challenged and declared void, it generally leads to the failure of <b>the</b> <b>infringement</b> action on <b>the</b> merits as it fails to produce evidence of <b>the</b> <b>infringement.</b> All other means of proof certainly remain effective in theory, but in practice, they are far from being as efficient as the saisie-contrefaçon, to the extent that the failure of the saisie-contrefaçon often means that <b>the</b> <b>infringement</b> action will fail.|$|R
