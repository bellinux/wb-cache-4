5|$|The {{atmosphere}} {{is divided into}} a number of sections depending on altitude. The densest part of the atmosphere, the troposphere, begins at the surface and extends upwards to 65km. At the furnace-like surface <b>the</b> <b>winds</b> <b>are</b> slow, but {{at the top of the}} troposphere the temperature and pressure reaches Earth-like levels and clouds pick up speed to 100m/s.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>winds</b> <b>are</b> {{predominantly}} northern. Along {{the coastline}} the winds {{flow from the}} north in November – March, from the east in April – August and from the north-east in September – October. The sea breeze causes the high frequency of eastern winds in summer. In the interior the predominant wind direction is more varied with northern winds being the most frequent in January – March and in October.|$|E
5|$|When landing, {{wind shear}} {{is also a}} hazard, {{particularly}} when <b>the</b> <b>winds</b> <b>are</b> strong. As the glider descends through the wind gradient on final approach to landing, airspeed decreases while sink rate increases, and there is insufficient time to accelerate prior to ground contact. The pilot must anticipate the wind gradient and use a higher approach speed to compensate for it.|$|E

5|$|El Hatillo, at {{a higher}} {{altitude}} than the neighboring municipalities of Caracas, has slightly cooler weather than nearby downtown Caracas. The average temperature is between 21 and 24 degrees Celsius (70–75°F). At the highest elevations, the temperature can decrease to 18°C (64°F) and the atmosphere may have constant fog. The mean precipitation is 997.3millimeters a year (39inches); annual values can range from 800 to 1,500millimeters (32in to 59in). The average humidity index is 75%; similar {{to the rest of}} Venezuela, the rainy season is May through November, while all other months are considered the dry season. <b>The</b> <b>winds</b> <b>are</b> north alizé trade winds.|$|E
5|$|The Westerlies or the Prevailing Westerlies are the {{prevailing}} winds {{in the middle}} latitudes between 35 and 65degrees latitude.

5|$|The {{thermal wind}} {{relation}} {{does not explain}} why <b>the</b> <b>winds</b> <b>are</b> organized into tight jets, rather than distributed more broadly over the hemisphere. One factor {{that contributes to the}} creation of a concentrated polar jet is the undercutting of sub-tropical air masses by the more dense polar air masses at the polar front. This causes surface low pressure and higher pressure at altitude. At high altitudes, lack of friction allows air to respond freely to the steep pressure gradient with low pressure at high altitude over the pole. This results in the formation of planetary wind circulations that experience a strong Coriolis deflection and thus can be considered 'quasi-geostrophic'. The polar front jet stream is closely linked to the frontogenesis process in midlatitudes, as the acceleration/deceleration of the air flow induces areas of low/high pressure respectively, which link to the formation of cyclones and anticyclones along the polar front in a relatively narrow region.|$|E
5|$|Wind figures {{prominently}} in several popular sports, including recreational hang gliding, hot air ballooning, kite flying, snowkiting, kite landboarding, kite surfing, paragliding, sailing, and windsurfing. In gliding, wind gradients {{just above the}} surface affect the takeoff and landing phases of flight of a glider. Wind gradient can have a noticeable effect on ground launches, also known as winch launches or wire launches. If the wind gradient is significant or sudden, or both, and the pilot maintains the same pitch attitude, the indicated airspeed will increase, possibly exceeding the maximum ground launch tow speed. The pilot must adjust the airspeed {{to deal with the}} effect of the gradient. When landing, wind shear is also a hazard, particularly when <b>the</b> <b>winds</b> <b>are</b> strong. As the glider descends through the wind gradient on final approach to landing, airspeed decreases while sink rate increases, and there is insufficient time to accelerate prior to ground contact. The pilot must anticipate the wind gradient and use a higher approach speed to compensate for it.|$|E

30|$|<b>The</b> <b>wind</b> power {{prediction}} error probability distribution is very complex {{due to the}} nonlinear relationship between <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> speed and <b>wind</b> power: when <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> speed <b>is</b> less than <b>the</b> cut-in <b>wind,</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> power <b>is</b> 0; when <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> speed <b>is</b> between <b>the</b> cut-in <b>wind</b> speed and <b>the</b> rated <b>wind</b> speed, <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> power will <b>be</b> <b>the</b> smooth output; when <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> speed <b>is</b> between <b>the</b> rated <b>wind</b> speed and <b>the</b> cut-out <b>wind,</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> power will maintain its maximum power; when <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> speed <b>is</b> greater than <b>the</b> cut-out <b>wind</b> speed, <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> power will <b>be</b> 0.

50|$|A {{variety of}} {{instruments}} {{can be used}} to measure wind direction, such as <b>the</b> windsock and <b>wind</b> vane. Both of these instruments work by moving to minimize air resistance.

The streams and lakes are home to Yellowstone cutthroat, rainbow, brook, brown, lake, and golden trout—about 2.5 million of which were stocked by a local explorer named Finis Mitchell and his wife during the Great Depression. The forests are dominated by lodgepole pine, whitebark pine, subalpine fir, and Engelmann spruce.|$|E
25|$|The term Chinook wind is {{also used}} in British Columbia, and is the {{original}} usage, being rooted in the lore of coastal tribes and brought to Alberta by the fur-traders. Such winds are extremely wet and warm and arrive off the western coast of North America from the southwest. <b>The</b> <b>winds</b> <b>are</b> {{also known as the}} pineapple express, since they are of tropical origin, roughly from the area of the Pacific near Hawaii. The air associated with a west coast Chinook is stable; this minimizes wind gusts and often keeps winds light in sheltered areas. In exposed areas, fresh gales are frequent during a Chinook, but strong gale- or storm-force winds are uncommon (most of the region’s stormy winds come when a fast ‘westerly’ jet stream lets air masses from temperate and subarctic latitudes clash).|$|E
500|$|The westerlies, anti-trades, or {{prevailing}} westerlies, are [...] prevailing winds {{from the}} west toward the east in the middle latitudes between 30 and 60 degrees latitude. They originate from the high-pressure areas in the horse latitudes and tend towards the poles and steer extratropical cyclones in this general manner. Tropical cyclones which cross the subtropical ridge axis into the westerlies recurve due to the increased westerly flow. <b>The</b> <b>winds</b> <b>are</b> predominantly from the southwest in the Northern Hemisphere and from the northwest in the Southern Hemisphere.|$|E

500|$|The {{westerlies}} or {{the prevailing}} westerlies are the prevailing winds {{in the middle}} latitudes (i.e., between 35 and 65 degrees latitude), which blow in areas poleward of the high pressure area known as the subtropical ridge in the horse latitudes. These prevailing winds blow from the west to the east, and steer extra-tropical cyclones in this general manner. <b>The</b> <b>winds</b> <b>are</b> predominantly from the southwest in the Northern Hemisphere and from the northwest in the Southern Hemisphere. [...] They are strongest in the winter when the pressure is lower over the poles, such as when the polar cyclone is strongest, and weakest during the summer when the polar cyclone is weakest and when pressures are higher over the poles.|$|E
500|$|Historically, {{a system}} has been {{classified}} as a depression if it {{is an area where}} the barometric pressure is low compared with its surroundings. Other classifications historically used include: cyclonic storm where the winds did not exceed force 10 on the Beaufort scale and a Cyclone where <b>the</b> <b>winds</b> <b>are</b> either force 11 and 12 on the Beaufort scale. Between 1924 and 1988, tropical cyclones were classified into four categories: depression, deep depression, cyclonic storms and severe cyclonic storms. However, a change was made during 1988 to introduce the category [...] "severe cyclonic storm with core of hurricane winds" [...] for tropical cyclones, with wind speeds of more than [...] During 1999 the categories Very Severe Cyclonic Storm and Super Cyclonic Storm were introduced, while the severe cyclonic storm with a core of hurricane winds category was eliminated. During 2015 another modification to the intensity scale took place, with the IMD calling a system with 3-minute maximum sustained wind speeds between 90–119kn (166–221km/h, 104–137mph): an extremely severe cyclonic storm. The United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center also monitors the basin, and issues warnings on significant tropical cyclones on behalf of the United States Government. These warnings use a 1-minute sustained wind speed and can be compared to the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale, however, regardless of intensity in this basin the JTWC labels all systems as tropical cyclones.|$|E
500|$|In mountainous areas, local {{distortion}} of the airflow becomes severe. Jagged terrain combines to produce unpredictable flow patterns and turbulence, such as rotors, which can be topped by lenticular clouds. Strong updrafts, downdrafts and eddies develop as the air flows over hills and down valleys. Orographic precipitation occurs on the windward side of mountains and {{is caused by the}} rising air motion of a large-scale flow of moist air across the mountain ridge, also known as upslope flow, resulting in adiabatic cooling and condensation. In mountainous parts of the world subjected to relatively consistent winds (for example, the trade winds), a more moist climate usually prevails on the windward side of a mountain than on the leeward or downwind side. Moisture is removed by orographic lift, leaving drier air on the descending and generally warming, leeward side where a rain shadow is observed. Winds that flow over mountains down into lower elevations are known as downslope winds. These winds are warm and dry. In Europe downwind of the Alps, they are known as foehn. In Poland, an example is the halny wiatr. In Argentina, the local name for downsloped winds is zonda. In Java, the local name for such winds is koembang. In New Zealand, they are known as the Nor'west arch, and are accompanied by the cloud formation they are named after that has inspired artwork over the years. In the Great Plains of the United States, <b>the</b> <b>winds</b> <b>are</b> known as a chinook. In California, downsloped winds are funneled through mountain passes, which intensify their effect, and examples include the Santa Ana and sundowner winds. Wind speeds during downslope wind effect can exceed [...]|$|E
