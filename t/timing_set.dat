5000|$|Unlike the 351C, {{almost all}} 400 blocks used the large {{bellhousing}} bolt pattern {{used by the}} 385 family big-block and were typically equipped with the higher torque-capacity C6 transmission. There were {{a small number of}} 400 block castings produced in 1973 with the dual bellhousing patterns.

These particular blocks have been dubbed the [...] "400 FMX" [...] by enthusiasts, though were never officially referenced as such by Ford. Most 400's also had unique engine mount bolt pattern but these 400 FMX blocks had provisions for both 351C-style and 400/351M engine mounts. For 1972, the compression was reduced through the use of dished pistons. The compression reduced again for 1973 and a new <b>timing</b> <b>set</b> retarded the camshaft timing 6° to aid with reducing emissions.

40|$|The {{relation}} between reinforcer magnitude and timing behavior was studied using a peak procedure. Four rats received multiple consecutive sessions with both {{low and high}} levels of brain stimulation reward (BSR). Rats paused longer and had later start times during sessions when their responses were reinforced with low-magnitude BSR. When estimated by a symmetric Gaussian function, peak times also were earlier; when estimated by a better-fitting asymmetric Gaussian function or by analyzing individual trials, however, these peak-time changes were determined to reflect a mixture of large effects of BSR on start times and no effect on stop times. These results pose a significant dilemma for three major theories of <b>timing</b> (<b>SET,</b> MTS, and BeT), which all predict no effects for chronic manipulations of reinforcer magnitude. We conclude that increased reinforcer magnitude influences timing in two ways: through larger immediate after-effects that delay responding and through anticipatory effects that elicit earlier responding...|$|E

Listeners were asked to continuously report whether they heard a single coherent sequence (integrated) or two concurrent streams (segregated).

These results suggest that the regular temporal patterns are utilized as cues in auditory stream segregation and that long-term memory is involved in this process...|$|E
40|$|International audienceTransaction-Level Models (TLM) {{are used}} for the early {{validation}} of embedded software. A TL model is a virtual prototype of the hardware part of a System-on-a-Chip (SoC). When using SystemC for transaction level modeling, the main parallel entities of the hardware platform (processors, DMAs, bus arbiters, etc.) are modeled by asynchronous processes, which are scheduled at simulation time. The specification of this scheduling mechanism is non-deterministic; the set of all possible schedulings of the parallel activities represents the physical parallelism faithfully. Moreover TL models may contain loose timing annotations (intervals for instance), and the set of all possible values of time in these intervals is also meant to represent the hardware behaviors faithfully. However, any simulation engine is built on a deterministic scheduler, and at runtime will use specific values in the time intervals. This means that {{only a very small}} subset of all the possible schedulings and timings are exhibited during simulation. Some bugs may be missed if they are due to some behaviors of the hardware that are represented by other schedulings or timings. For a given finite test scenario, the set of valid schedulings and timings of a model is finite, but far too large to be explored fully. We present a solution to cover the set of schedulings and timings efficiently. Our solution is based on dynamic partial order reduction and constraint solving techniques. It gives a complete scheduling and <b>timing</b> <b>set,</b> which guarantees the detection of all local errors and deadlocks for a fixed test scenario...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{pressures}} on vehicle manufacturers {{to reduce their}} average fleet levels of CO 2 emissions have resulted in an increased drive to improve fuel economy and enable use of fuels developed from renewable sources that can achieve a net reduction in the CO 2 output of each vehicle. The most popular choice for spark-ignition engines has been the blending of ethanol with gasoline, where the ethanol is derived either from agricultural or cellulosic sources such as sugar cane, corn or decomposed plant matter. However, other fuels, such as butanol, have also arisen as potential candidates due to their similarities to gasoline, e. g. higher energy density than ethanol. To extract the maximum benefits from these new fuels through optimized engine design and calibration, {{an understanding of the}} behaviour of these fuels in modern engines is necessary. In particular, the use of direct injection spark-ignition technology requires spray formation and combustion characteristics to be quantified in order to improve both injector design and operating strategies. To this end an optical investigation of spray development and combustion was undertaken in a single-cylinder direct-injection spark-ignition engine with a centrally mounted multi-hole injector. Specifically, crank-angle resolved imaging studies were performed and batches of images from 100 consecutive cycles were acquired with synchronised in-cylinder pressure logging. The engine was motored and fired at 1500 RPM stoichiometrically under part load (0. 5 bar intake pressure), with injection <b>timing</b> <b>set</b> early in the intake stroke to promote homogeneous mixture formation. The effects were investigated at engine coolant temperatures of 20 °C and 90 °C using gasoline, iso-octane, ethanol and butanol. Projected spray areas as seen through the piston crown were calculated to reveal information about the atomization and evaporation processes for each fuel. Additionally, flame areas and centroids were calculated to analyse the combustion process relative to measured in-cylinder pressure histories. © 2008 SAE International...|$|E

40|$|In {{an attempt}} to study the {{numerous}} contributors towards cyclic variations in combustion in a direct injection spark ignition engine, simultaneous high-speed imaging of fuel injection and flame growth are undertaken on a crank-angle resolved basis in a single-cylinder optical research engine. Batches of images from 100 consecutive cycles are acquired for all conditions with synchronised in-cylinder pressure logging. The engine is motored and fired at stoichiometric conditions at 1500 RPM under part-load and wide-open-throttle conditions (0. 5 - 1. 0 bar intake pressure), with injection <b>timing</b> <b>set</b> early in the intake stroke to promote homogeneous mixture formation with a centrally mounted multi-hole injector. Liquid impingement is observed on the cylinder walls and on the piston crown with early intake injection and multiple injection strategies are employed in {{an attempt to}} reduce impingement and alter mixture preparation and subsequent combustion. The effects are investigated for iso-octane and pump-grade gasoline at engine coolant temperatures of 50 and 90 °C. Gasoline sprays showed severe deformation and partial collapse of the individual spray plumes at 90 °C, leading to a different mixture formation process relative to iso-octane, which showed no such effects at this engine temperature. Using multiple fuel injections per cycle, but maintaining the same overall air-to-fuel ratio with single-injection strategies, a significant reduction in direct impingement on the walls was observed, together with different flame growth relative to single injection. These results suggest that injection strategy and type of fuel is playing {{an important role in the}} mixture preparation process, even for homogeneous early direct injection, and that different types of multiple-injection strategies alone have the potential to modify significantly in-cylinder phenomena, affect combustion and potentially exhaust emissions.

40|$|Current {{practice}} {{is an important}} component of evidence-based practice. This resource provides a discussion of timing practice and assessment guide-lines and {{a detailed description of the}} impact of physiological and nonphysiological factors on the efficacy of intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) therapy. Conventional Timing Assessment Timing assessment is the process of determining if the timing settings are correct relative to the cardiac cycle. Conventional timing dictates that all actions of the IABP occur in diastole, so inflation should occur at the dicrotic notch and deflation before the next systolic ejection. To assess <b>timing,</b> <b>set</b> the IABP at 1 : 2 assist to allow comparison of assisted and unassisted beats. Figure 1 shows the assessment points. To assess inflation, draw a line (circled 1 on the figure) from visible dicrotic notch to dicrotic notch. The inflation point or V between systole and aug-mentation should be on or slightly above the line. If the V is too far above the line (more than 3 boxes on the electrocardiographic [ECG] paper), inflation timing is too early. If the dicrotic notch is visible between systole and the augmentation waveform, inflation is too late. In addition, the augmentation pressure should be greater than the systolic pressure. Deflation timing is assessed by identifying the assisted diastole, that is, the diastolic pressure after inflation of the balloon, and comparing it with the unassisted diastole (circled 2 on Figure 1), the native diastolic pressure of the patient. The assisted diastole should be lower than the patient’s diastolic pressure. Finally, draw a line from the systolic pressure to the next systolic pressure (circled 3 on Figure 1). The assisted systole, the pressure after assisted diastole, should be lower than the patient’s native systole. This finding indicates that the decrease in aortic pressure at end diastole reduced systolic pressure work on the next systolic beat. If the assisted systolic pressure is not lower than the native systolic pressure, deflation is too early (Figure 2 A). This situation may occur even when defla-tion produces a decrease in end-diastolic pressure, but if it occurs well before the next systolic ejection, the left ventricle does not benefit from that pressure About the Authors Patricia M.

The influence of valve timings on the flame development angle and the rapid burn angle is primarily associated with valve overlap values and internal gas recirculation.

As engine loads and speeds exceeded about 6 bar net indicated mean effective pressure and 3000 r/min respectively, combustion duration was virtually independent of the valve <b>timing</b> <b>setting.</b> At lower speeds and work output conditions, valve timing influenced burn angles through changes in dilution mass fraction, charge density, and charge temperature. Of these, changes in dilution mass fraction had the greatest influence. Increasing the dilution by increasing the valve overlap produced an increase in both burn angles. The effects of mean piston speed and spark timing have also been examined, and empirical expressions for the flame development and the rapid burn angles are presented...|$|R
