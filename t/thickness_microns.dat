40|$|Battery cost {{is among}} the largest {{barriers}} to mainstream adoption of electric vehicles. This dissertation examines near future battery technology and cost by (1) validating existing physics-based battery performance models using laboratory testing and manufacturer specifications, (2) constructing battery design optimization and production cost models to identify the least-cost design and investigating how key design-decision variables affect performance and cost {{for a variety of}} vehicle power and energy requirements, and (3) conducting expert elicitation on future battery costs and the key factors that drive cost. The validation, cost, and optimization modeling work use LiNi 0. 33 Co 0. 33 Mn 0. 33 O 2 /LixC 6 (NMC-G) as the chemistry of choice. Validation results of Battery Design Studio™ (BDS) a Li-ion battery modeling software indicated that BDS predictions of total energy delivered under our constant C-rate battery discharge tests are within 6. 5 % of laboratory measurements for a full discharge and within 2. 8 % when a 60 % state of charge window is considered. Once validated, BDS is used to develop a power meta-model that predicts the 10 –sec power capability of a cell design as a function of its capacity (Ah) and cathode coating <b>thickness</b> (<b>microns).</b> The production cost model is a process-based model and is constructed adopting process step information from existing literature. Subsequently, an optimization model is developed which estimates the cheapest cost battery pack design for a set of five different electrified vehicles (EVs) whereby the role of design-decision variables like cathode coating thickness is investigated among others. The energy and power requirements for the EVs, used as constraints in the optimization model, are calculated using the Powertrain Systems Analysis Toolkit (PSAT). Battery pack costs calculated are in the range of costs reported in the literature. Results indicate that higher capacity cells manufactured using higher electrode coating thicknesses can decrease manufacturing costs by 5 - 8 %. Results suggest that economies of scale can be reached at a plant size of about 200 MWh. Expert elicitation indicates that a variation of NMC-G {{is likely to be the}} cheaper cell-chemistry by 2018 with no major technological breakthroughs. Some experts also expect manufacturing improvements resulting in higher electrode coating thicknesses and cell capacities expected by 2018...|$|E
40|$|The button {{mushroom}} is rich food full of nutrient but {{compared with other}} fruits and vegetables, mushroom has a higher respiration rate and {{due to the lack}} of protective layer to prevent water loss, decay occurs quickly. It seems that suitable coating film is the one way for increase the storage life of mushroom. Therefore present research was carried out as split plot design in farme of CRD to find the best coating film in order to increase the storage life. In this research, the treatments were: control (package with Selefon), Poly Ethylene (PE) with 40 and 65 <b>micron</b> <b>thickness,</b> Biaxially Oriented Polypropylene (BOPP) with 25, 35 and 40 <b>micron</b> <b>thickness,</b> Cast PolyPropylen (CPP) with 25 and 40 <b>micron</b> <b>thickness,</b> Poly Ester (PET) with 12 and 24 <b>micron</b> <b>thickness</b> and Poly Vinyl Chloride (PVC) with 30 <b>micron</b> <b>thickness.</b> The samples were estimated after 0, 10, 15, 20 and 25 days storage at 1 °C and 90 % RH in 3 replications. The results showed that the types of plastic coating had significant effects on all measured characteristics as campared to that of control. Highest firmness value, Soluble Solid Content (SSC), titratable acidity, acidity (pH), and lowest weight less and decay were observed in packet mushroom with the coating film: BOPP and CPP and the lowest amounts were observed in the mushroom packed with control, PVC, PET and PE films.

40|$|A {{gelatinous}} coat, heterogeneous in appearance, {{was formed}} over damaged rat gastric mucosa recovering from acute ethanol injury. This coat, in places 1. 6 mm thick (median <b>thickness</b> 680 <b>microns),</b> was 10 times thicker than the translucent layer of adherent mucus (median <b>thickness</b> 70 <b>microns)</b> covering the undamaged mucosa. Immunohistochemistry and periodic acid Schiff staining showed this gelatinous coat to be predominantly a fibrin gel with an exterior layer rich in mucus and necrotic cells. The plasma clotting time was significantly decreased in vitro by pig gastric mucus gel and soluble mucus glycoprotein (90 % and 13 % respectively) suggesting that in vivo the mucus layer remaining after epithelial damage could {{act as a}} template for fibrinogen-fibrin conversion. These results show that a fibrin based gelatinous coat, quite distinct from the adherent mucus layer and with considerable protective potential could be formed over the repairing rat gastric mucosa after acute ethanol damage...|$|R

Unlike the reflectance of quartzite and basalt, the reflectance of the palagonite is flat and low (1 - 2 percent). It was found that a dusting of 1 - 20 micron palagonite particles and 20 - 250 micron particle clumps, covering 50 percent of the quartzite of the basalt host reduced the quartizite mid-IR reflectance by about 50 percent. The reflectance of the underlying rock was found to be linearly related to the exposed surface area even for extremely small amounts of palagonite (2 - 100 <b>micron</b> <b>thickness,</b> averaging 5 <b>microns),</b> indicating that mid-IR remote sensing of rocks on Mars will be practical only for dust-free areas...|$|R

40|$|A {{theory of}} an n-p-p/+/ {{junction}} is developed, entirely based on Shockley's depletion layer approximation. Under the further assumption of uniform doping the electrical characteristics of solar cells {{as a function}} of all relevant parameters (cell thickness, diffusion lengths, etc.) can quickly be ascertained with a minimum of computer time. Two effects contribute to the superior performance of a BSF cell (n-p-p/+/ junction) as compared to an ordinary solar cell (n-p junction). The sharing of the applied voltage among the two junctions (the n-p and the p-p/+/ junction) decreases the dark current and the reflection of minority carriers by the builtin electron field of the p-p/+/ junction increases the short-circuit current. The theory predicts an increase in the open-circuit voltage (Voc) with a decrease in cell thickness. Although the short-circuit current decreases at the same time, the efficiency of the cell is virtually unaltered in going from a <b>thickness</b> of 200 <b>microns</b> to a <b>thickness</b> of 50 <b>microns.</b> The importance of this fact for space missions where large power-to-weight ratios are required is obvious...|$|R

40|$|The {{mechanics}} of skin is {{as central to}} touch as optics is to vision and acoustics is to hearing. With the advent of novel imaging technologies such as the Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), we {{are now able to}} view structures within the skin to a resolution of a few microns in vivo and non-invasively. To fully understand the role of bio{{mechanics of}} the skin in interpreting touch, we need to develop a quantitative understanding of how spatio temporal loads imposed {{on the surface of the}} skin are transmitted to mechanoreceptor locations within the skin. The following thesis presents a description of the design and fabrication of an Optical Pressure Sensor Device to be used in conjunction with an Optical Coherence Tomography Apparatus to quantify loads incident on the fingerpad surface. The Optical Pressure Sensor is a five layer PDMS based device having a total <b>thickness</b> of 150 <b>microns.</b> It consists of two layers of a textured pattern separated by a layer of "Soft" PDMS of <b>thickness</b> 100 <b>microns.</b> The top and bottom protective layers are of PDMS and have a <b>thickness</b> of 20 <b>microns</b> each. "Soft" PDMS is a combination of PDMS and the silicone oil "Fluid 200 " and has a Young's Modulus less than that of Human Skin. (cont.) The entire device is fabricated bottom up on a silicon wafer using soft lithography techniques and the textured pattern is imprinted onto the PDMS using photolithography techniques. This flexible pressure sensor is designed to be used on the fingerpad skin to determine the pressure distribution due to incident loads. The sensor is placed between the OCT head and the finger pad to be imaged. The OCT head (along with the indenter) acts as the mechanical stimulus and is used to indent the finger pad. As a result of this stimulus, the human skin along with the pressure sensor gets deformed and both these deformations are picked up by the OCT image. The deflection between the two bands of patterns is used to estimate the stress at the pressure sensor and skin interface through the development of a continuum mechanics model which is also developed and introduced in this thesis. The manufactured device is tested and calibrated for use with the fingerpad. by Siddarth Kumar. Thesis (S. M.) [...] Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, 2006.

40|$|Actuator is a {{fluid control}} component, {{which will be}} used in any of the fluid control requirements. The {{proposed}} actuator is normally closed and electro-mechanically actuated with armature configuration. The armature movement is the path opening to facilitate the actuator flow and is controlled by the flexure positioned over the armature. Flexure not only provides the armature movement but also guides in the designed path. Configuration and thickness of flexure plays vital role in the actuator design. Three configurations have been studied for this application. By considering the fabrication feasibility, flexure third configuration has been conceptualised for the actuator. Analysis has been carried out for the third configuration by considering the flexure material as SS 302. Based on design requirement, flexure has to travel by 0. 3 mm maximum on both sides from neutral position to get the desired armature movement of 0. 6 mm. Three variants of thickness viz., 100, 150 and 250 microns are selected for the flexure third configuration.
