5|$|Gandhi {{expanded}} his nonviolent non-co-operation platform {{to include the}} swadeshi policy—the boycott of foreign-made goods, especially British goods. Linked to this was his advocacy that khadi (homespun cloth) be worn by all Indians instead of British-made textiles. Gandhi exhorted Indian men and women, rich or poor, to spend <b>time</b> <b>each</b> <b>day</b> spinning khadi {{in support of the}} independence movement. In addition to boycotting British products, Gandhi urged the people to boycott British institutions and law courts, to resign from government employment, and to forsake British titles and honours. Gandhi thus began his journey aimed at crippling the British India government economically, politically and administratively.|$|E
5|$|Atlantic puffins lead solitary existences when {{out at sea}} {{and this}} part of their life has been little studied as the task of finding even one bird on the vast ocean is formidable. When at sea, the Atlantic puffin bobs about like a cork, {{propelling}} itself through the water with powerful thrusts of its feet and keeping itself turned into the wind, even when resting and apparently asleep. It spends much <b>time</b> <b>each</b> <b>day</b> preening to keep its plumage in order and spread oil from the preen gland. Its downy under-plumage remains dry and provides thermal insulation. In common with other seabirds, its upper surface is black and underside white. This provides camouflage, with aerial predators unable to observe the bird against the dark watery background and underwater attackers failing to notice it as it blends in with the bright sky above the waves.|$|E
5|$|Shepard was {{assigned}} to Fighter Squadron 42 (VF-42), flying the Vought F4U Corsair. The squadron was nominally based on the aircraft carrier , but the ship was being overhauled at the time Shepard arrived, {{and in the meantime}} the squadron was based at Naval Air Station Norfolk in Virginia. He departed on his first cruise, of the Caribbean, on Franklin D. Roosevelt with VF-42 in 1948. Most of the aviators were, like Shepard, on their first assignment. Those that were not were given the opportunity to qualify for night landings on a carrier, a dangerous maneuver, especially in a Corsair, which had to bank sharply on approach. Shepard managed to persuade his squadron commander to allow him to qualify as well. After briefly returning to Norfolk, the carrier set out on a nine-month tour of the Mediterranean Sea. He earned a reputation for carousing and chasing women. He also instituted a ritual of, whenever he could, calling Louise at 17:00 (her <b>time)</b> <b>each</b> <b>day.</b>|$|E

25|$|Adults are {{particularly}} fond of nectar-rich flowers {{with a long}} and narrow calyx, since they can then {{take advantage of their}} long proboscis and avoid competition from other insects. Examples of such plants include Centranthus, Jasminum, Buddleia, Nicotiana, Primula, Viola, Syringa, Verbena, Echium, Phlox, and Stachys. They are reported to trap-line, that is, to return to the same flower beds at about the same <b>time</b> <b>each</b> <b>day.</b>|$|E

In a full day's play scheduled {{for at least six}} hours, there are formal intervals on each day for lunch and tea with brief informal breaks for drinks. There is also a short interval between innings.|$|E
25|$|Turnout {{is thought}} to reduce the {{likelihood}} of colic, although this has not been proven. It is recommended that a horse receive ideally 18 hours of grazing <b>time</b> <b>each</b> <b>day,</b> as in the wild. However, many times this is difficult to manage with competition horses and those that are boarded, as well as for animals that are easy keepers with access to lush pasture and hence at risk of laminitis. Turnout on a dry lot with lower-quality fodder may have similar beneficial effects.|$|E

As a student, he became friends with the actor Leonid Limontov, {{although}} in his memoirs Limontov recalls his reluctance to become friends with Scriabin, who was the smallest and weakest among all the boys and was sometimes teased due to his stature. However, Scriabin won his peers' approval at a concert where he performed on the piano. He ranked generally first in his class academically, but was exempt from drilling due to his physique and was given <b>time</b> <b>each</b> <b>day</b> to practise at the piano.|$|E
25|$|Construction of the boys' school {{changed the}} way boys were educated at St. Peter's. Most {{instruction}} was now carried on indoors, in great contrast to the Native American way of life at the time (in which most time was spent outdoors). The boys were responsible for maintaining the kitchen garden, herding and feeding the small herd of beef cattle, and feeding and milking the dairy cattle, so some <b>time</b> <b>each</b> <b>day</b> was spent in the barns, corrals, or garden. Small fields, watered by irrigation ditches, were also maintained by the boys. The curriculum did not change throughout the year. Boys were expected {{to work in the}} fields even in winter, and {{the amount of time spent}} indoors did not vary (even during summer, when the growing season demanded that most of the day be spent outdoors).|$|E
25|$|In return, {{the family}} must leave {{a portion of}} their supper (or beer, for the bierasal) to the spirit and must treat the kobold with respect, never mocking or {{laughing}} at the creature. A kobold expects to be fed in the same place at the same <b>time</b> <b>each</b> <b>day,</b> {{or in the case of}} the Hütchen, once a week and on holidays. One tradition says that their favourite food is grits or water-gruel. Tales tell of kobolds with their own rooms; the kobold Heinzelmann had his own chamber at the castle, complete with furnishings. and King Goldemar was said to sleep in the same bed with Neveling von Hardenberg. He demanded a place at the table and a stall for his horses. Keightley relates that maids who leave the employ of a certain household must warn their successor to treat the house kobold well.|$|E

500|$|Flood {{immediately}} {{pushed the}} band {{to change its}} recording practices. Corgan later said, [...] "Flood felt like the band he would see live wasn't really captured on record". In April 1995, the band began recording in a rehearsal space, instead of entering the studio straight away. At these sessions, the band recorded rough rhythm tracks with Flood. Originally designed to create a rough draft for the record, the rehearsal space sessions ended up yielding {{much of the new}} album's rhythm section parts. Flood also insisted the band set aside <b>time</b> <b>each</b> <b>day</b> devoted to jamming or songwriting, practices the band had never engaged in before during recording sessions. Corgan said, [...] "Working like that kept the whole process very interesting—kept it from becoming a grind." ...|$|E
500|$|Armstrong {{remained}} unpopular {{with the}} Board of Control. Despite Armstrong's triumphs, {{it was reported}} that he was only appointed captain of the 1921 Australian team to tour England by [...] "the narrowest possible margin". [...] On the voyage to England, Armstrong attempted to lose some weight by spending some <b>time</b> <b>each</b> <b>day</b> in the stokehold of the ship. [...] On arrival, however, he weighed in [...] heavier. [...] Against English teams badly affected by the Great War, the Australians dominated the series. [...] Armstrong marshalled his troops well, utilising Gregory and Ted McDonald to devastating effect. [...] Australia won the first Test in two days, the second Test by lunch on the third day and the third Test and the Ashes by 5.00pm on the third day. [...] Throughout the tour, Armstrong fought a series of running battles against the Board appointed manager, Syd Smith, on behalf of his men. [...] Smith, looking to cut overheads, had suggested boarding with wealthy cricket devotees; Armstrong dismissed the idea.|$|E

500|$|On 3 December, two battalions of the New Zealand Division {{attacked}} the Polderhoek Spur {{to shield the}} area north of the Reutelbeek stream from German observers at Gheluvelt further south. The attack was made in daylight as a ruse, {{in the hope that}} the unusual time would surprise the German defenders, who would be under cover sheltering from the bombardments being fired at the same <b>time</b> <b>each</b> <b>day.</b> The ruse failed, some British artillery-fire dropped short on the New Zealanders, the Germans engaged the attackers with small-arms fire from Polderhoek Spur and Gheluvelt ridge and winds ruined a smoke screen. The New Zealanders suffered many casualties and were forced under cover [...] short of the first objective; another attempt after dark was cancelled because of the full moon and sight of German reinforcements reaching Polderhoek Château. German counterattacks were repulsed over the next few days and the New Zealanders handed over to troops of IX Corps. The Germans used an observation balloon accurately to direct artillery-fire and on 14 December, the ground was re-captured by a German counterattack.|$|E

2500|$|Crocodiles possess some {{advanced}} cognitive abilities. They {{can observe}} and use patterns of prey behaviour, {{such as when}} prey come to the river to drink at the same <b>time</b> <b>each</b> <b>day.</b> Vladimir Dinets of the University of Tennessee, observed that crocodiles use twigs as bait for birds looking for nesting material. They place sticks on their snouts and partly submerge themselves. [...] When the birds swooped in to get the sticks, the crocodiles then catch the birds. Crocodiles only do this in spring nesting seasons of the birds, when there is high demand for sticks {{to be used for}} building nests. Vladimir also discovered other similar observations from various scientists, some dating back to the 19th century. Aside from using sticks, crocodiles are also capable of cooperative hunting. Large numbers of crocodiles swim in circles to trap fish and take turns snatching them. In hunting larger prey, crocodiles swarm in, with one holding the prey down as the others rip it apart.|$|E
2500|$|In 1904, Grey {{became friends}} with a fellow Midwestern architect, Myron Hunt. [...] The two rode horses {{together}} on Sunday mornings in Pasadena and formed a partnership in that city as Hunt and Grey. [...] Grey later wrote that he began by working only a short <b>time</b> <b>each</b> <b>day</b> [...] "until my nerves got in better shape." [...] Grey's health again failed {{during the early years}} of his partnership with Hunt, and he took a long trip to the South Sea Islands. [...] Yet, it was during his partnership with Hunt that Grey produced some of his finest work. [...] The two designed fine residences for the wealthy of Pasadena and also worked on larger projects, including schools, churches and hotels. [...] In 1905, The Architectural Record published articles on both Grey and Hunt, noting: [...] "Both Mr. Hunt and Mr. Grey stand for the attempt to naturalize in this country the best traditions of European architecture. [...] Mr. Grey, for instance, believes that a very genuine American style is in the process of making; but that as yet it is only in its infancy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Powell's {{confinement}} was not easy. He {{was constantly}} shackled with {{a form of}} manacles known as [...] "lily irons", a riveted handcuff that had two separate iron bands on each wrist that prevented bending of the wrist or use of the hands independently. Like all the male prisoners, a heavy iron ball {{at the end of}} a [...] long chain was manacled to one of his legs. Shackles were riveted closed about the ankles, which caused Powell's feet to swell considerably. Like all the prisoners, he had only a straw pallet on which to sit or lie, and a single blanket for warmth. The same meal was served four times a day: [...] Coffee or water, bread, salted pork, and beef or beef soup. On April 29, all the prisoners aboard the monitors and at the Old Capitol Prison were moved to newly constructed cells at the Washington Arsenal (now Fort Lesley J. McNair). The prisoners were not permitted to bathe or wash until May 4, at which time all bindings and clothes were removed and they were permitted to bathe in cold water in the presence of a soldier. In early May, General John F. Hartranft, special provost marshal overseeing the prisoners, began improving the living conditions. Powell and the other prisoners began to receive fresh clothing (including undergarments) more frequently, more food, and writing instruments (paper, pen, ink). When Powell was observed raising the iron ball to his head, Hartranft feared Powell might be contemplating suicide, and had the ball removed on June 2. Living conditions improved again on June 18, when the prisoners were given a box to sit on, outdoor exercise <b>time</b> <b>each</b> <b>day,</b> and reading material and chewing tobacco after each meal.|$|E
