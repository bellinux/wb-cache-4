5|$|Rahl {{installed}} decking on {{half of the}} <b>trestle</b> between 1989 and 1991, {{attempting to}} open it as a bungee jumping platform. A court ruling found that such a venture violated zoning laws, and the town denied Rahl a variance. In 2009 the county seized the <b>trestle,</b> and it was sold to an environmental group. The <b>trestle</b> was closed in 2010 for repairs, {{and is expected to}} be opened as part of the Wallkill Valley Rail Trail in 2012.|$|E
5|$|The Robin Road <b>Trestle</b> is {{the only}} {{remaining}} intact <b>trestle</b> along the former line. In the early 2000s developers purchased the property {{on either side of}} the trestle's abutments, but the developers, the New York City Department of Transportation, and the New York City Transit Authority all claimed ownership of it. Consequently, townhouses have built up against both sides of it.|$|E
5|$|The {{bridge was}} rebuilt between 1895 and 1896 {{to convert it}} from iron to steel. It was {{repeatedly}} reinforced throughout its existence. When Conrail closed the Wallkill Valley line in 1977, {{the stability of the}} <b>trestle</b> had been one of its primary reasons for doing so. Conrail had tried to sell the bridge as early as 1983, and in 1986 the <b>trestle</b> was sold to a private businessman, John Rahl, for one dollar.|$|E
50|$|The {{floodway}} of the Bonnet Carré Spillway in St. Charles Parish, Louisiana, is crossed {{by three}} wooden <b>trestles</b> each over 1.5 miles in length. The <b>trestles</b> {{are owned by}} the Canadian National Railway (two <b>trestles)</b> and the Kansas City Southern Railroad. The <b>trestles</b> were completed in 1936, after construction of the Spillway. The <b>trestles</b> may be the longest wooden railroad <b>trestles</b> remaining in regular use in North America.|$|R
50|$|There are 54 <b>trestles</b> {{along the}} 44 km length {{of various sizes}} {{spanning}} ravines. During construction, temporary timber <b>trestles</b> were built alongside the proposed <b>trestles</b> to avoid construction delays and speed up construction of the permanent concrete <b>trestles.</b>|$|R
25|$|In 1999, {{the rains}} of Hurricane Floyd caused {{considerable}} {{damage to the}} railroad. Two <b>trestles</b> were entirely destroyed by the flooding of Red Clay Creek, which also caused track washouts and damaged several other <b>trestles.</b> The two destroyed bridges were replaced by steel <b>trestles,</b> but the other timber <b>trestles</b> were simply repaired.|$|R
5|$|The {{surface of}} the walkway was rebuilt with a wood-plastic {{composite}} built by a volunteer force. On February 17, 2011, a Bergmann Associates employee used the <b>trestle</b> {{as a case study}} in a seminar on adaptive reuse of defunct railroad bridges. By late March 2011, the estimated cost of renovating the <b>trestle</b> had risen to $1.1million, and the expected time to completion increased to two years.|$|E
5|$|As a Long Island Rail Road station {{it served}} as one of two {{junctions}} between the Far Rockaway and Rockaway Beach Branches. The other junction was at Hammels Station, although it was originally a junction for the Far Rockaway Branch and the Ocean Electric Railway. Hammels is now located where Hammels Wye is. Wooden shelter sheds {{were added to the}} station in 1921 and 1923. A fire on the <b>trestle</b> between this station and another one known as The Raunt, located to the north, forced the closure of both stations on May 23, 1950, as well as the entire Jamaica Bay <b>trestle</b> which stretches from Howard Beach to Hammels Wye.|$|E
5|$|In York County, the Muddy Creek Bridge, Delta <b>Trestle</b> Bridge, and Scott Creek Bridge-North {{were added}} to the National Register of Historic Places in 1995.|$|E
25|$|<b>Trestles</b> - <b>Trestles</b> is {{inaccessible}} by vehicle; a {{long walk}} from either the north or south end passing under the <b>Trestles</b> Bridge is necessary for access. This world-famous surfing area {{is known for its}} consistent waves.|$|R
50|$|Concrete train <b>trestles</b> now form {{a part of}} the GWP entrance. They {{were part}} of the {{original}} 1906 gas plant and ran along {{the north side of the}} Office and Laboratories Building. Nothing remains of this building, but the <b>trestles</b> show where the train tracks ended and coal was delivered. Coal cars would ride up the <b>trestles</b> and release coal into hoppers parked under the <b>trestles.</b>|$|R
50|$|Many timber <b>trestles</b> {{were built}} in the 19th and early 20th centuries with the {{expectation}} that they would be temporary. Timber <b>trestles</b> were used to get the railroad to its destination. Once the railroad was running, it was used to transport the material to replace <b>trestles</b> with more permanent works, transporting and dumping fill around some <b>trestles</b> and transporting stone or steel to replace others with more permanent bridges.|$|R
5|$|The Far Rockaway Branch of the Long Island Rail Road had {{originally}} {{been part of a}} loop that traveled along the existing route. The line diverges from the present-day Atlantic and Long Beach Branches east of Valley Stream station in Valley Stream, New York. Eastbound trains continued south then southwest, through Five Towns and the Rockaway Peninsula, and onto a <b>trestle</b> across Jamaica Bay through Queens where it reconnected with the Rockaway Beach Branch; westbound trains did the reverse, using the Rockaway Beach Branch to cross the <b>trestle,</b> go through the Rockaways and Five Towns, and continue northeast then north to join the westbound Atlantic Branch.|$|E
5|$|Broad Channel {{originally}} {{opened in}} 1880 as a Long Island Railroad station. The LIRR discontinued service in 1950 after a {{fire on the}} <b>trestle</b> across Jamaica Bay, to the station's north. The station reopened June 28, 1956, as a subway station.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Highland Mills, the Port Jervis Line, {{operated}} by Metro-North Railroad, crosses over {{on a high}} <b>trestle.</b> After crossing over Woodbury Creek and under the Thruway, NY32 runs along {{the eastern side of}} the narrow valley between Schunemunk and the Hudson Highlands. This section of highway runs through mostly wooded terrain as it leaves Woodbury for Cornwall.|$|E
50|$|New Orleans {{utilizes}} steel <b>trestles</b> {{to support}} parts of I-10, the Pontchartrain Expressway, and Tulane Avenue. Also, <b>trestles</b> support the elevated railroad leading {{to and from}} the Huey P. Long Bridge.|$|R
25|$|At {{a cost of}} $197 million, new {{parallel}} two-lane <b>trestles</b> {{were built}} both to alleviate traffic and for safety reasons. Immediately after completion of the parallel <b>trestles,</b> traffic was diverted to them and the original <b>trestles</b> and roadway underwent a $20 million retrofit, repairing {{the wear and tear}} of 35 years of service and upgrading certain features, such as repaving the road surface. The older portion of the facility was then reopened on April 19, 1999.|$|R
50|$|For {{years after}} the {{abandonment}} of this section of rail line, the area was a noted attraction, with its relatively gentle grade, it became a hiker and cyclist haven. Years of disrepair on the <b>trestles</b> began to take its toll on the line. In some cases vandals had removed railway ties on the larger steel bridges, thus creating large gaps. In some cases hikers and cyclists wanting to cross the <b>trestles</b> {{would be required to}} walk on sections of steel no wider than a foot across in sections where the ties were removed. This would not normally be an issue, but many of these <b>trestles</b> and bridges were hundreds of feet in height. However, after a fatal accident involving a cyclist on one of the <b>trestles,</b> many people petitioned to have the bridges and <b>trestles</b> made safer. These upgrades included repairs after numerous years of disrepair, and the installation of handrails and planks so that people did not have to jump between each railway tie.|$|R
5|$|After {{the journey}} restarts, the train enters a tunnel through the Splash Mountain log flume attraction, crosses a <b>trestle</b> {{bridge over the}} Critter Country section, wraps around the Rivers of America in the Frontierland section, and rolls through another tunnel before {{reaching}} Mickey's Toontown Depot between the Mickey's Toontown and Fantasyland sections. While the train is stopped at this station, a non-functioning water tower {{can be seen on}} the opposite side of the track to the station's depot building.|$|E
5|$|In 1869 {{the town}} of Rosendale issued {{municipal}} bonds to pay for its portion of the Wallkill Valley Railroad, and construction of a railroad bridge spanning the Rondout Creek began the following year. After bridging the Wallkill River in New Paltz, the railroad reached Rosendale in 1871. The Rosendale <b>trestle</b> was formally opened during a large ceremony on April6, 1872. The height of the bridge terrified onlookers, who questioned the trestle's sturdiness. The bridge's completion allowed the rail line to continue north to Kingston.|$|E
5|$|The city, {{which began}} as a {{frontier}} town, has several historical attractions. The Lethbridge Viaduct, {{commonly known as the}} High Level Bridge, is the longest and highest steel <b>trestle</b> bridge in North America. It was completed in 1909 on what was then the city's western edge. Indian Battle Park, in the coulees of the Oldman River, commemorates the last battle between the Cree and the Blackfoot First Nations in 1870.|$|E

5|$|The masonry for {{a bridge}} over the Plattekill Creek between Gardiner and New Paltz was {{completed}} by late June 1870, and <b>trestle</b> work was done by July. Beginning in late September 1870, the railroad had begun laying tracks between Gardiner and New Paltz. The tracks reached the Plattekill Creek bridge {{by the end of}} October, and the rail line reached New Paltz on December1, 1870.|$|E
5|$|A {{greenway}} and/or connecting trail along Leggetts Creek {{was proposed}} in the Lackawanna River Watershed Conservation Plan in the early 2000s. The greenway would {{be known as the}} Leggetts Creek greenway. It could link to the Lackawanna River Heritage Trail and could be extended to link to the Tunkhannock greenway. The South Abington Park and the Leggetts Creek Trail are in Chinchilla and the creek flows though the latter. <b>Trestle</b> Hole Park is also along the creek's lower reaches. The Dutch Gap Little League Field is located at Wells Street.|$|E
5|$|A new Methodist {{church was}} built in the {{community}} in 1910, which was used until 1988 and is still standing. Two years later, a new two-room school replaced the old one-room school, which in turn was replaced by a modern school in the mid 1900s, all on the same property. In 1939, the wooden <b>trestle</b> part of the railroad bridge across the Willamette caught fire and burned. Boones Ferry was decommissioned after the Boone Bridge opened in 1954 carrying what was then the Baldock Freeway, and is today Interstate 5.|$|E
5000|$|In August 2003, {{a nearby}} {{wildfire}} destroyed 239 homes {{and forced the}} temporary evacuation of approx. 30,000 residents. During the 2003 fire, many <b>trestles</b> of the historic Kettle Valley Railway were destroyed. All the <b>trestles</b> have been rebuilt {{to look like the}} originals but using smaller dimension beams.|$|R
5000|$|Six {{concrete}} <b>trestles</b> {{are made}} out of wood staves preserved with creosote and bound with iron bands. These were built to reduce the length around the longest of ravines. The wooden <b>trestles</b> actually dip down {{one side of the}} ravine and go up the other relying on the downward pressure to push the water back up. These [...] "dipping" [...] <b>trestles,</b> known as [...] "inverted siphons," [...] were initially constructed of concrete as well but the material is very weak in tension and resulted in cracked segments due to the pressure of [...] (abs).|$|R

5|$|After the disincorporation, the {{commercial}} {{center of the}} former village was revitalized by artists and entrepreneurs, who purchased and restored Main Street buildings that had fallen into disrepair. Since the 1990s, Rosendale has hosted many street festivals. The former village has {{had a number of}} notable buildings, including four churches. Two notable bridges span the Rondout Creek in the village: a road bridge that carries Route32, and the Rosendale <b>trestle,</b> a former railroad bridge currently being renovated as a pedestrian walkway. Joppenbergh Mountain, named after Rosendale's founder, borders the village and has been the site of numerous ski jumping competitions and mine collapses.|$|E
5|$|Angel {{gives up}} {{his share of}} the gold to Pike in return for sending one crate of rifles and {{ammunition}} to a band of rebels opposed to Mapache. The holdup goes largely as planned until Deke's posse turns up on the train the gang has robbed. The posse chases them to the Mexican border, only to be foiled again as the robbers blow up a <b>trestle</b> spanning the Rio Grande, dumping the entire posse into the river. The pursuers temporarily regroup at a riverside camp and then quickly take off again after the Bunch.|$|E
5|$|Bridges over {{waterways}} {{had been}} known in China since the ancient Zhou dynasty. During the Song dynasty, large <b>trestle</b> bridges were constructed, such as that built by Zhang Zhongyan in 1158. There were also large bridges made entirely of stone, like the Ba Zi Bridge of Shaoxing, built in 1256 and still standing today. Bridges with pavilions crowning their central spans were often featured in such paintings as the landscapes of Xia Gui (1195–1224). Long, covered corridor bridges, like the 12th-century Rainbow Bridge in Wuyuan, Jiangxi province, which has wide stone-based piers and a wooden superstructure, were also built.|$|E
