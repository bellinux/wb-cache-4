2500|$|With time, Logroño {{was given}} the chance to do a {{political}} satire show on television station WAPA-TV, which was called [...] "Politiqueando", in 1996. As means to promote the television program, Logroño staged short on-air telephone calls to Salsoul, a Puerto Rican radio station. The early evening disc-jockey, Fernando Arévalo, would <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the characters of the show, namely a cat puppet of Logroño's called Polito Garrapatoso, as well as to Don Eleuterio, for no longer than five minutes. Success from these phone calls was such that audiences demanded a longer treatment. Agitando El Show was then born, giving Eleuterio ten, and later twenty minutes of airtime. Eventually the program grew in length, and Don Eleuterio was given a full hour of airtime daily. The program's name, [...] "Agitando", means [...] "Shaking (people up)", as to depict the expected uproar from segments of the audience whenever Don Eleuterio went on the air.|$|E
2500|$|Just {{five days}} after the shootings, 100,000 people {{demonstrated}} in Washington, D.C., against the war and the killing of unarmed student protesters. Ray Price, Nixon's chief speechwriter from 1969 to 1974, recalled the Washington demonstrations saying, [...] "The city was an armed camp. The mobs were smashing windows, slashing tires, dragging parked cars into intersections, even throwing bedsprings off overpasses into the traffic down below. This was the quote, student protest. That's not student protest, that's civil war." [...] Not only was Nixon taken to Camp David for two days for his own protection, but Charles Colson (Counsel to President Nixon from 1969 to 1973) stated that the military was called up to protect the administration from the angry students; he recalled that [...] "The 82nd Airborne was {{in the basement of the}} executive office building, so I went down just to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the guys and walk among them, and they're lying on the floor leaning on their packs and their helmets and their cartridge belts and their rifles cocked and you're thinking, 'This can't be the United States of America. This is not the greatest free democracy in the world. This is a nation at war with itself.'" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "With a bow from Majesty, dinner ends; guests gently, with {{a little}} saunter of <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> them, all vanish; and the King is in his own Apartment again. Generally flute-playing for about half an hour; till Eichel and the others come with their day's work: tray-loads of Cabinet-Orders, I can fancy; which are to be 'executed,' that is, to be glanced through, and signed. Signature for most part is all; but there are Marginalia and Postscripts, too, in great number, often of a spicy biting character; which, in our time, are in request among the curious." [...] Herr Preuss, who has right to speak, {{declares}} that the spice of mockery has been exaggerated; and that serious sense is always the aim both of Document and of Signer. Preuss had a windfall; 12,000 of these Pieces, or more, in a lump, {{in the way of}} gift; which fell on him like manna,--and led, it is said, to those Friedrich studies, extensive faithful quarryings in that vast wilderness of sliding shingle and chaotic boulders.|$|E

Each of us has had her little fling at maternity--about as much as a washerwoman does in her odd time every two or three years--and that is our uttermost reality. All the rest,--trimmings! We go about the world, Stephen, dressing and meeting each other with immense ceremony, we have our seasonal movements in relation to the ritual of politics and sport, we travel south for the Budget and north for the grouse, we play games to amuse the men who keep us--not a woman would play a game for its own sake--we dabble with social reform and politics, for which few of us care a rap except as an occupation, we 'discover' artists or musicians or lecturers (as though we cared), we try to believe in lovers or, still harder, try to believe in old or new religions, and most of us--I don't--do our best to give the gratifications and exercise the fascinations that are expected of us....|$|E

50|$|The {{girls were}} then shown {{getting ready to}} perform at CD:UK, with their TV plugger talking about how {{important}} television is in promoting Girls Aloud. Hillary then talked about how Girls Aloud were snubbed by the BRIT Awards, leading to a segment where the Sugababes, who were also on CD:UK, came to talk to Girls Aloud about the Brits situation. This led to a funny moment where Cheryl thought that Amelle Berrabah's older sister was her mum. The cameras then went outside to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> Girls Aloud's fans, {{and then it was}} shown how hours of preparation lead to just three minutes performing on TV.|$|E

5000|$|In 1978, {{director}} Michael Powell {{and some}} of the surviving cast and crew went back to Foula to re-visit the island where they had made the film that changed their lives.

In the first part, Powell drives in to Pinewood Studios and tells how the film came to be made. Then he, John Laurie, Sydney Streeter, Grant Sutherland and others return to Foula. In the second part, they <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the islanders who were there in 1937 and remember those who couldn't make the reunion.

5000|$|Clavijo's {{visit to}} Samarkand {{allowed him to}} report to the European {{audience}} on the news from Cathay (China), which few Europeans had been able to visit directly in the century that had passed since the travels of Marco Polo. Clavijo's account reported, even if in a garbled form, on the recent civil war between the descendants of the Hongwu Emperor. The Spanish were able to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the Chinese visitors, and learned about the caravan routes between Samarkand and Cambalu (Beijing). Besides telling the European readers about the Cathayan capital Cambalu, which he was told was [...] "the largest city in the world", and the mighty armies of that country, Clavijo also—mistakenly—reported that the new emperor of Cathay had converted to Catholicism. Thus his report served as one of the factors supporting the European belief in the widespread presence of Christianity in Cathay, which was to persist until the early 17th century and {{to be one of the}} reasons for sending the famed Bento de Góis expedition in 1603.|$|E
