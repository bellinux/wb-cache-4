[...] She also stated she enjoys Nicole's [...] "promiscuous side" [...] because {{she seems to}} have another boyfriend every week. James also enjoys the role because of this and the fact she gets so many [...] "pash" [...] scenes with other cast members.|$|E
500|$|Gosling's first action {{role was}} in Drive, {{based on a}} novel by James Sallis. Gosling portrayed a Hollywood stunt {{performer}} who moonlights as a getaway driver and he has described the film as a [...] "violent John Hughes movie": [...] "I always thought if Pretty in Pink had head-smashing it would be perfect". Roger Ebert compared Gosling to Steve McQueen and stated that he [...] "embodies presence and sincerity ... he has shown a gift for finding arresting, powerful characters [...] can achieve just about anything. Joe Morgenstern of the Wall Street Journal pondered [...] "the ongoing mystery of how he manages <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> impact with so little apparent effort. It's irresistible to liken his economical style to that of Marlon Brando." [...] The film was a box office success, grossing $70 million worldwide from a production budget of $15 million.|$|E

2500|$|His grandson, {{the fifth}} Duke, succeeded {{to the title}} {{at the age of}} 25 in 1913. In 1914 he decided on the {{outbreak}} of the First World War that it was unwise <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> of his riches tied up in land and property. He sold the family's Staffordshire estate except Lilleshall Hall and [...] of gardens. He then decided he wanted to live closer to London, and sold the whole package in 1917 to Sir John Lee. The Duke was childless; on his death in 1963, the line of the eldest son of the first Duke failed. He was succeeded in the earldom of Sutherland and lordship of Strathnaver, which could be inherited by females, by his niece Elizabeth. Elizabeth also inherited most of her uncle's wealth, but the dukedom and other titles could only be passed on to male heirs, and they were inherited by his third cousin once removed, John Sutherland Egerton, 5th Earl of Ellesmere, who became the 6th Duke of Sutherland as well. He was a great-great-grandson of the first Earl of Ellesmere, third son of the first Duke of Sutherland. He also died childless and was succeeded by his first cousin once removed, Francis Ronald Egerton, the seventh and present duke, a grandson of the Hon. Francis William George Egerton, second son of the third Earl of Ellesmere.|$|E
