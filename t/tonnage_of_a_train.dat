5000|$|Compensated Gross Tonnage (CGT) is <b>an</b> {{indicator}} <b>of</b> {{the amount}} of work that is necessary to build a given ship and is calculated by multiplying the <b>tonnage</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> ship by a coefficient, which is determined according to type and size <b>of</b> <b>a</b> particular ship.|$|R
2500|$|The {{displacement}} or displacement <b>tonnage</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> ship is its weight, {{expressed in}} long tons of water its hull displaces.

50|$|The {{displacement}} or displacement <b>tonnage</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> ship is the ship's weight. The name {{reflects the}} fact that it is measured indirectly, by first calculating the volume of water displaced by the ship, and then calculating the weight of that water. By Archimedes' principle, this is also the weight of the ship.|$|R

2500|$|By {{the turn}} of the 20th century, larger ships meant more people could travel, but {{regulations}} were generally still insufficient to provide for all passengers: for example British legislation concerning the number of lifeboats was based on the <b>tonnage</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> vessel and only encompassed vessels of [...] "10,000 gross tons and over". The result was that a sinking usually involved a moral dilemma for passengers and crew as to whose lives should be saved with the limited available lifeboats.|$|R
