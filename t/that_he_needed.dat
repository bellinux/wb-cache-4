5|$|By late 1941, Pontecorvo {{was having}} {{difficulty}} securing the radioisotopes <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>needed.</b> Unbeknown to him, the Manhattan Project, the wartime {{effort to build}} atomic bombs, was cornering the market. In an attempt to obtain them, he met with Fermi, von Halban and George Placzek in New York in April 1942. He was unable to secure the supplies he wanted, but Fermi showed an unexpected keen interest in the Wells Surveys work.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{military}} supremacy over land, Simeon I was aware <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> naval assistance {{in order to}} seize Constantinople. In 922 he clandestinely sent envoys to the Fatimid caliph Ubayd Allah al-Mahdi Billah in Mahdia to negotiate {{the assistance of the}} powerful Arab navy. Simeon I proposed to divide equally all spoils; the Bulgarians were to keep Constantinople and the Fatimids would gain the Byzantine territories in Sicily and South Italy.|$|E
5|$|In Berlin Busoni was at {{the heart}} of the musical world of the Weimar Republic. His works, {{including}} his operas, were regularly programmed. He continued to perform whilst his health allowed it; problems of hyperinflation in Germany meant <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> to undertake tours to England. His last appearance as a pianist was in Berlin in May 1922, playing Beethoven's Emperor Concerto. Amongst his composition pupils in Berlin were Kurt Weill, Wladimir Vogel and Robert Blum, and he also during these last years had contact with Edgard Varèse, Igor Stravinsky, Hermann Scherchen and others.|$|E

5|$|In June 1944, Bradbury {{received}} {{orders from}} Parsons, {{who was now}} the Deputy Director of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory, to report to Albuquerque, New Mexico. Parsons explained <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> Bradbury {{to work on the}} explosive lenses required by an implosion-type nuclear weapon. Bradbury was less than enthusiastic about the prospect, but he was a naval officer, and ultimately agreed to go.|$|E
5|$|In September 1970, Keating {{was granted}} a {{temporary}} restraining order from the D.C. Federal District Court to delay publication of the report, stating <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> access to all the report's backing materials and time to write a dissent. Several days later, Keating was given the desired materials and two weeks to write his report by the committee.|$|E
5|$|In another essay, {{he refers}} to James Baldwin's {{struggle}} to use the English language to accurately represent his experience, and his realisation <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> {{to take control of}} the language and expand it. The Nigerian poet and novelist Gabriel Okara likens the process of language-expansion to the evolution of jazz music in the United States.|$|E

5|$|Later in {{the morning}} of August 9 General Vandegrift advised Admiral Turner <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> more {{supplies}} unloaded from the transports before they withdrew. Therefore, Turner postponed the withdrawal of his ships until mid-afternoon. In the meantime, Astorias crew tried to save their sinking ship. Astorias fires, however, eventually became completely out of control, and the ship sank at 12:15.|$|E
5|$|Lindwall's {{physique}} had matured by {{the time}} he was 15, and he was also successful at athletics and swimming. Aware <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> a good education with his family in poverty during the Great Depression, Lindwall lifted himself for his final year of junior high school and won a half-scholarship to Marist Brothers Darlinghurst for 1937 and 1938. However, Lindwall's focus on rugby league and cricket saw him fail his Leaving Certificate in his final year.|$|E
5|$|Mildred Walpole {{found it}} hard to settle in New Zealand, and {{something}} of her restlessness and insecurity affected the character of her eldest child. In 1889, two years after the birth of the couple's daughter, Dorothea ("Dorothy"), Somerset Walpole accepted a prominent and well-paid academic post at the General Theological Seminary, New York. Robert ("Robin"), the third of the couple's children, was born in New York in 1892. Hugh and Dorothy were taught by a governess until the middle of 1893, when the parents decided <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> an English education.|$|E

5|$|Several anecdotal stories {{supposedly}} {{explain why}} Warhol chose Campbell's Soup cans as {{the focal point}} of his pop art. One reason is <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> a new subject after he abandoned comic strips, a move taken in part due to his respect for the refined work of Roy Lichtenstein. According to Ted Carey—one of Warhol's commercial art assistants in the late 1950s—it was Muriel Latow who suggested the idea for both the soup cans and Warhol's early U.S. dollar paintings.|$|E
5|$|The breach between Antony and Octavian {{prompted}} {{a large portion}} of the Senators, as well as both of that year's consuls, to leave Rome and defect to Antony. However, Octavian received two key deserters from Antony in the autumn of 32BC: Munatius Plancus and Marcus Titius. These defectors gave Octavian the information <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> to confirm with the Senate all the accusations that he made against Antony.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{planned to be}} shot entirely in and around Mumbai and Jagannadh searched for {{distinct}} localities there which suit the script's backdrops.

5|$|Windeyer {{realised}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> {{to capture}} Kakakog Ridge. Torrential rain was falling, {{making it difficult}} to resupply the forward positions, particularly Starvation Hill. On 1 October eight Douglas A-20 Havoc bombers of the US 89th Bombardment Squadron attacked the Japanese positions in the Salankaua Plantation and Kakakog Ridge area at 10:35, followed by ten Vultee Vengeance dive bombers of No. 24 Squadron RAAF. This was followed by twenty 25-pounders of the 2/12th Field Regiment firing 30 rounds per gun.|$|E
5|$|After Driberg {{had risen}} to {{responsible}} positions within the school (deputy head boy, head librarian, and chief sacristan, among others), his Lancing career ended suddenly {{in the autumn of}} 1923, when two boys complained about his sexual overtures. To avoid distressing the widowed Amy Driberg (John Driberg had died in 1919), the headmaster allowed him to remain in the school {{for the remainder of the}} term, stripped of his offices and segregated from all social contact with other boys. At the end of the term he was required to leave, on the pretext <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> private tuition to pass his Oxford entrance examination which he had failed the previous summer. Back in Crowborough, after several months' hard application under the guidance of his tutor, the future Lord Justice Pearson, Driberg won a classics scholarship to Christ Church, Oxford.|$|E
5|$|After a May 23 neck surgery, Manning {{could not}} use the Colts' {{facilities}} for practice and workouts due to the NFL lockout. Reluctant to have witnesses to his recovery, he used the Colorado Rockies baseball team's trainers at Coors Field in Denver. Manning was unable to complete his throwing motion, and his arm strength had significantly diminished. Based on an MRI, doctors told him {{in the late summer}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> spinal fusion surgery and that at his age they could not guarantee his return to the NFL. On September 7, the Colts officially ruled Manning out for the season opener against Houston, ending his consecutive starts streak of 208 games (227 including playoffs); the team signed Kerry Collins out of retirement and named him interim starting quarterback. After seeking other opinions, Manning had the second surgery on September 8.|$|E
50|$|Abdullayev {{released}} another {{video on}} 16 June 2013. In the video, which apparently precedes {{the very first}} video featuring Gular Ahmadova, Sevinj Babayeva tells Abdullayev <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> to pay Ahmadova US$500,000 to secure {{a seat in the}} National Assembly. She says <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> to pay US$500,000 more to have a high position in the government assigned to his brother Mahir Abdullayev. Abdullayev replies he does not have the extra money she asks for, of which Babayeva immediately informs Ahmadova by phone.|$|R
50|$|When Margaret becomes suspicious, Hawkeye and Trapper {{tell her}} that Buzz is {{suffering}} from low self-esteem and hint <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> intimate contact with a woman to prove {{he is still a}} man. While he is alone with Margaret, the Swampmen get Henry Blake very drunk, give him a pistol (telling him <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> to take a firearms qualification test), arrange for him to walk in on Buzz and Hot Lips, and encourage an angry, drunken response from Henry.|$|R

Lois tells Peter <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> {{to recover the}} money to buy their {{daughter}} a new pair of glasses. After hearing Quagmire and Cleveland talk about how men with Jewish-sounding names have helped them achieve financial success, Peter decides <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> a Jew to handle his money in an elaborate musical number.|$|R
5|$|After a {{match at}} Cincinnati Gardens, an enraged fan took a fire {{extinguisher}} {{off the wall}} and threw it at Costello and Kent from the balcony of the Gardens. The extinguisher hit Costello in the hip, damaging it so much <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> hip replacement surgery later that year. The fan was arrested, served 15days in jail, and fined fifty dollars for damaging the fire extinguisher. The hip injury left Costello unable to wrestle, and The Fabulous Kangaroos split up once again. Costello had a full hip replacement and was forced to retire from active competition.|$|E
5|$|Although {{he gained}} a {{reputation}} as a womaniser when he moved to Glasgow, he married in 1965 and had two sons. The marriage broke up in 1981, and in 1983 he formed another relationship that lasted the rest of his life. After retiring from football he became manager of a pub, and his continued heavy drinking damaged his liver so badly <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> two transplants at the age of 55, after which he swore off alcohol. Baxter was also addicted to gambling, and is estimated to have lost between £250,000 and £500,000. After he died of pancreatic cancer in 2001, his funeral was held in Glasgow Cathedral and his ashes were buried at Rangers' Ibrox Stadium. In 2003, a statue was erected in his honour at his hometown, Hill of Beath.|$|E
5|$|Burnham {{decided to}} reject the offer of the young Kansan (who {{followed}} through with the plan and was later killed), and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> to leave the Tonto Basin. Judge Aaron Hackney, editor of the local Arizona Silver Belt newspaper and a friend, helped him escape to Tombstone, Arizona {{with the assistance of}} Neil McLeod. He was a well-known prizefighter in Tombstone {{and one of the most}} successful smugglers along the Arizona–Mexico frontier. The Gunfight at the O.K. Corral had occurred only a few months earlier, but as Tombstone was a boomtown attracting new silver miners from all parts, it was an ideal location to hide out. Burnham assumed several aliases and occasionally he delivered messages for McLeod and his smuggler partners in Sonora, Mexico. From McLeod, he learned many valuable tricks for avoiding detection, passing coded messages, and throwing off pursuers.|$|E
