5|$|Young orangutans also beg {{for food}} by such contact and {{accordingly}} their caretakers regurgitate to feed them. Indeed, behaviours of mouth <b>to</b> <b>mouth</b> feeding of premasticated food and ritualized mouth <b>to</b> <b>mouth</b> contact for bonding {{has been observed}} in anthropoid great apes such as gorillas, orangutans, and chimpanzees. All of this supports the idea that human behaviours of kissing and feeding of premastication foods, {{either directly or indirectly}} from the mouth, have their behavioural roots in higher animals and ancestral great apes.|$|E

5|$|In many human {{cultures}}, {{the act of}} premastication {{and direct}} mouth-to-mouth feeding is linked with the showing of affection, known as kiss feeding. In the Manus cultures of the Admiralty Islands, the act of premastication {{has been used by}} a women to remind children and descendants of their obligations to her. Some human cultures such as the people of Papua New Guinea in fact use mouth <b>to</b> <b>mouth</b> contact primarily for feeding premasticated food, with sexual kissing only observed after the arrival of Europeans. This form of feeding is believed to have evolved into the modern human acts of kissing and French kissing.|$|E

25|$|Numerous {{landmarks}} {{have been}} constructed along the Hudson. Following the river from its source <b>to</b> <b>mouth,</b> there is the Hudson River Islands State Park in Greene and Columbia counties, and in Dutchess County, there is Bard College, Staatsburgh, the Vanderbilt Mansion National Historic Site, Franklin D.

South of that in Orange County is the United States Military Academy. In Westchester lies Indian Point Energy Center, Croton Point Park, and Sing Sing Correctional Facility. In New Jersey is Stevens Institute of Technology and Liberty State Park. In Manhattan is Fort Tryon Park with the Cloisters, and the World Trade Center.

25|$|The {{species is}} known to undergo a dietary shift as it grows to adulthood. Young {{individuals}} less than 10cm in length consume considerable volumes of copepods and minor amounts of polychaetes, but once they reach around 10cm, the diet shifts to a polychaete-dominated one. Further growth sees {{an increase in the}} volume of amphipods, small fish and oligochaetes taken. These changes appear to be unrelated <b>to</b> <b>mouth</b> morphology, instead the fish becomes more mobile and possesses a larger mouth {{to be able to take}} these prey. The yellowfin whitings' diet also varies spatially and temporally, which appears to be a function of prey availability at different sites and periods of the year. There is little resource partitioning between the small individuals of sillaginids which inhabit shallow inshore habitats, with Sillago vittata, S. burrus and Sillaginodes punctatus also taking copepods as their primary prey in southwest Western Australia. This changes as each species grows, with S. vittata and S burrus moving to deeper waters to avoid interspecific competition, whilst the remaining S. schomburgkii and Sillaginodes punctatus partition the resources, with S. punctatus consuming more decapods and shrimps.|$|E

500|$|Aphthous {{stomatitis}} {{has been}} {{classified as a}} type of non-infectious stomatitis (inflammation of the mouth). One classification distinguishes [...] "common simple aphthae", accounting for 95% of cases, with 3–6 attacks per year, rapid healing, minimal pain and restriction of ulceration to the mouth; and [...] "complex aphthae", accounting for 5% of cases, where ulcers may be present on the genital mucosa in addition <b>to</b> <b>mouth,</b> healing is slower and pain is more severe. A more common method of classifying aphthous stomatitis is into three variants, distinguished by the size, number and location of the lesions, the healing time of individual ulcers and whether a scar is left after healing (see below).|$|E
500|$|Under ideal {{conditions}} (uniform gentle slope on a homogeneously erodible substrate), the sinuosity of a meandering river approaches [...] The sinuosity is the ratio between the actual length and the straight-line distance from source <b>to</b> <b>mouth.</b> Faster currents along the outside edges of a river's bends cause more erosion than along the inside edges, thus pushing the bends even farther out, {{and increasing the}} overall loopiness of the river. However, that loopiness eventually causes the river to double back on itself in places and [...] "short-circuit", creating an ox-bow lake in the process. The balance between these two opposing factors leads to an average ratio of [...] between the actual length and the direct distance between source and mouth.|$|E

Still, from the 1860s to the 1940s, steamboats traveled on the Snake River from its mouth at the Columbia River to {{near the mouth of}} the Imnaha River in lower Hells Canyon. However, most of the steamboats only sailed from the river's mouth to Lewiston, located at the confluence of the Snake and Clearwater rivers. This stretch of the river is the easiest to navigate for watercraft since it has the least elevation change, although it still contained over 60 sets of rapids.|$|E
500|$|Richard Elfman {{had never}} gone to film school when {{production}} started, and [...] "I didn't know what I was getting into." [...] The production, {{from its original}} 16mm roots to its finish, took three years. Cast and crew members would sleep on the film's stage, wearing spare gorilla suits to stay warm. Among the film's artistic influences included 1940s big band and jazz music and Max Fleischer cartoons of the 1930s (such as Betty Boop).
