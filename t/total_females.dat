METHODS: All patients with a molecular diagnosis of DM 1 /DM 2 and residents in the Rome province in 2013 have been enrolled, and the age-standardized prevalence has been calculated, assuming a Poisson distribution and adjusting for age.

The most predominant species was Thermocyclops decipiens (about 50 % of the total zooplankton community), which during the whole period had a high reproductive rate. The highest densities were found in the dry- 1996 season (1700 ind/l for nauplii), and also fluctuated widely overtime. Nauplii stages dominated during the four periods, comprising 50 - 75 % of the total population density.

40|$|Despite {{being one}} of the most {{productive}} fisheries in the Northwest Atlantic, much remains unknown about the natural reproductive dynamics of American lobsters. Recent work in exploited crustacean populations (crabs and lobsters) suggests that there are circumstances where mature females are unable to achieve their full reproductive potential due to sperm limitation. To examine this possibility in different regions of the American lobster fishery, a reliable and noninvasive method was developed for sampling large numbers of female lobsters at sea. This method involves inserting a blunt-tipped needle into the female 2 Ì† 7 s seminal receptacle to determine {{the presence or absence of}} a sperm plug and to withdraw a sample that can be examined for the presence of sperm. A series of control studies were conducted at the dock and in the laboratory to test the reliability of this technique.

Treatments were: T 1) females of P. nigrispinus fed on plants of the UFV 16 and Anticarsia gemmatalis HÃ¼bner (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) caterpillars reared on leaves of this variety; T 2) females of P. nigrispinus fed on plants of the IAC 17 and A. gemmatalis caterpillars reared on leaves of this variety. Longevity of females, pre-oviposition, oviposition and pos-oviposition periods, number of eggs and egg masses/female, egg weight, interval between egg mass laying, number of eggs/egg mass, percentage of nymphs, number of nymphs/female and total number of prey killed/female of P. nigrispinus were evaluated. Most of the characteristics evaluated showed similar results between treatments, but the oviposition period was longer for females reared on the resistant genotype than on the susceptible one and the percentage of <b>total</b> <b>females</b> that laid eggs was lower on the IAC 17. Also, the resistant genotype caused higher mortality of P. nigrispinus females at the beginning of its adult stage and egg production by females of this predator was better spread along its adult stage with this resistant genotype.
