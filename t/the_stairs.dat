5|$|The {{standards}} and balusters of <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> {{on the north}} side of the hall came from Eversley Manor House and probably date to the mid-17th century, although the treads are original to the house and possibly mid-16th century. The walls above <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> and on the first-floor landing contain some very large paintings, including several portraits.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wall}} that {{separated}} {{the upper and lower}} parts was a gate that led to the upper part. The upper part did not have buildings, but there remains a pathway to <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> up to gateIV, which is 2metres off the ground, right next to tower 3.|$|E
5|$|Pooja {{is invited}} to stay at her parents' house, and Prem takes her there. When they arrive, Pooja learns that Prem and Nisha are in love, and gives Nisha a {{necklace}} as a token, promising to get them married. Shortly afterwards, Pooja accidentally slips and falls down <b>the</b> <b>stairs,</b> and dies from a head injury. Everybody is shattered by the tragedy.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Stair</b> Hall {{also has}} several moulded plaster archways. <b>The</b> {{polished}} cedar <b>stair</b> has moulded square balusters, carved newels and a panelled spandrel beneath. <b>The</b> <b>stair</b> is dog-legged, with leadlight windows to the landing.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Improbable <b>Stair</b> is a {{stairway}} that can traverse all of creation. It was the Architect's personal transport by which she visited {{all of her}} work. To enter <b>the</b> <b>Stair,</b> one must first have an item of power, such as a Key or the Piper’s Pipes. The traveler must then see a resemblance to a stair in any object, such as a bent blade of grass or jagged crack in a surface, and imagine {{the presence of a}} true stairway. There are several landings on <b>the</b> <b>Stair,</b> of which all open seemingly at random onto a place and time. Having reached a landing, the traveler must return to <b>the</b> <b>Stair</b> by <b>the</b> mentioned process. The entire use of <b>the</b> <b>Stair</b> is described as risky and dangerous, and these risks increase when the destination is near Nothing. Some Denizens cannot travel on <b>the</b> <b>Stair</b> (<b>the</b> reason for this is unknown); but Piper's Children are always accepted.|$|R
50|$|When the Fellowship {{arrived at}} <b>the</b> <b>Stair</b> Falls on 13 'January' , {{they found a}} mere trickle. Gandalf, Gimli, and Frodo climbed <b>the</b> <b>Stair,</b> {{discovered}} that <b>the</b> pool blocked their path, returned and used the main path up the cliff and around the pool. It seems possible that after the War and reoccupation of Moria, the Sirannon may have been unblocked and <b>the</b> <b>Stair</b> Falls may have flowed once more, but this is nowhere stated.|$|R
5|$|The {{painting}} {{following this}} text section shows {{a man on}} <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> of a house and two men on a boat just outside the house. The illustration matching the scene described in the text is now the fifth painting of the Hachisuka scroll.|$|E
5|$|The two-story brick {{structure}} {{is supported by}} a fieldstone foundation and still features its original front porch. The porch spans the length of the building's front (south) facade, at a height of about 6feet (1.8m). The porch is supported by four wooden pillars, which rest on stone bases. <b>The</b> <b>stairs</b> leading to the front porch are supported by two similar wooden posts, which, like the house, are set into fieldstone bases. The first step on <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> was originally a limestone block embedded in the ground. The porch roof is supported by six wooden, bracketed pillars. The pillars are simple, with the brackets coming from the boxed capitals. At the rear of the porch wooden pilasters set at each end help to support the roof. Differentiating the home from the traditional French Colonial design is the porch roof, which is separate from the main roof.|$|E
5|$|After the party, Johnny locks {{himself in}} the bathroom, {{prompting}} Lisa to carry out leaving him for Mark. Johnny finally {{comes out of the}} bathroom and retrieves the cassette recorder he attached to the phone and listens to an intimate call between Lisa and Mark. Johnny has an emotional breakdown, destroying his apartment and committing suicide via gunshot. Hearing the commotion, Denny, Mark and Lisa rush up <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> to find his body. Mark and Denny blame Lisa for Johnny's death, with Mark abandoning her. Denny asks Lisa and Mark to leave, but they stay and comfort one another as the police arrive.|$|E
6000|$|The words {{meant that}} Tommy {{thought it could}} only enter by way of <b>the</b> <b>stair,</b> and Shovel quivered with delight. [...] "H'st!" [...] he cried, dramatically, and to his joy Tommy looked anxiously down <b>the</b> <b>stair,</b> instead of up it.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>stair</b> hall, {{centrally}} {{located on the}} south west end of the building, in a semi circular recess, has a fine bi-furcating stair, turning 180 degrees and dividing at the landing between the floors and arriving at the next floor in two sections {{on either side of}} the central larger section. <b>The</b> <b>stair</b> has a continual handrail of fine quality craftsmanship. <b>The</b> <b>stair</b> hall has two sets of three arched window openings, filled with coloured and translucent glass.|$|R
50|$|The {{stairwell}} {{occupies the}} tower that terminates {{in the roof}} top belvedere. A primarily timber structure, <b>the</b> <b>stair</b> has ornamental balusters, carved stringers and marble treads and risers on the flights between ground and first floor. Painted cast iron panels are incorporated into <b>the</b> <b>stair</b> balustrade. Beyond <b>the</b> first floor <b>the</b> <b>stair</b> treads and risers are timber. A narrower <b>stair</b> connects <b>the</b> second floor to {{a room at the}} top of the tower under the belvedere.|$|R
5|$|Another {{theory is}} that Madeleine, nearly four at the time, left the {{apartment}} by herself, perhaps to look for her parents, and was abducted by a passer-by or fell {{into one of the}} open construction sites nearby. This is widely regarded as unlikely. According to her mother, Madeleine would have had to open the unlocked patio doors, close the curtains behind her, close the door again, open and close the child gate at the top of <b>the</b> <b>stairs,</b> then open and close the gate leading to the street.|$|E
5|$|Bin Laden {{peered through}} his bedroom {{door at the}} Americans {{advancing}} up <b>the</b> <b>stairs,</b> and then retreated into the room as the lead SEAL fired a shot at him, which either missed or {{hit him in the}} side. Robert O’Neill, who later publicly identified himself as the SEAL who shot bin Laden, rolled through the door and confronted bin Laden inside the bedroom. Seymour Hersh reports that, according to his sources, bin Laden was found cowering and shot dead.|$|E
5|$|Borobudur was {{considered}} {{as the source}} of souvenirs, and parts of its sculptures were looted, some even with colonial-government consent. In 1896 King Chulalongkorn of Siam visited Java and requested and was allowed to take home eight cartloads of sculptures taken from Borobudur. These include thirty pieces taken from a number of relief panels, five buddha images, two lions, one gargoyle, several kala motifs from <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> and gateways, and a guardian statue (dvarapala). Several of these artifacts, most notably the lions, dvarapala, kala, makara and giant waterspouts are now on display in the Java Art room in The National Museum in Bangkok.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> Endless <b>Stair</b> {{rose from}} <b>the</b> lowest dungeon of Moria to Durin's Tower {{at the summit}} of Celebdil. <b>The</b> Endless <b>Stair</b> was of such legendary status among Dwarves that some {{considered}} it mythical, but Gandalf confirmed its existence to Gimli when he recounted his battle with Durin's Bane (a balrog). Durin's Tower {{and the top of}} <b>the</b> <b>Stair</b> were destroyed in that struggle. The height of <b>the</b> <b>Stair</b> is not known, but Gandalf said that it climbed many thousands of steps in an unbroken spiral. <b>The</b> <b>Stair</b> was clearly of epic proportions, as it allowed Gandalf and the Balrog to ascend from one of Moria's lowest Deeps to the pinnacle of one of the tallest mountains in Middle-earth.|$|R
50|$|A {{small room}} {{at the rear of}} the banking chamber has an {{external}} door to the verandah and leads to <b>the</b> <b>stair</b> hall which has an intact cedar staircase and pressed metal ceiling. An arched opening at the end of <b>the</b> <b>stair</b> hall leads to the section of the building constructed in 1996-1997. Behind <b>the</b> <b>stair</b> hall is a large room that has been created from two smaller rooms; it has a dropped ceiling and a new door to the verandah.|$|R
6000|$|As daily I went up <b>the</b> <b>stair</b> [...] And down <b>the</b> <b>stair,</b> I did {{not mind}} the Bygone there - [...] The Present once to me; Its moving meek {{companionship}} [...] I wished might ever be, There was in that companionship [...] Something of ecstasy.|$|R
5|$|Both Mulder and Scully stumble down <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> {{in hope of}} {{just getting}} outside to die. They meet up by the door, both {{crawling}} on the floor, covered in massive amounts of blood. Scully claims he shot her, while Mulder claims she shot him. Mulder realizes that {{that could not have}} happened and stands up. The illusion is broken, and the two leave the house. Maurice and Lyda sit by the fire, holding hands, saying that they almost had the two agents. Meanwhile, at Mulder's apartment, Mulder and Scully exchange gifts, even though they told each other they would not.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Detective Chief Superintendent Roy Ranson arrived at Lower Belgrave Street early on Friday 8November, the divisional surgeon had {{pronounced}} Sandra Rivett dead and forensic officers and photographers {{had been called}} to the property. Other than the front door, which the first two officers on the scene had kicked in, {{there was no sign}} of a forced entry. A bloodstained towel was found in Veronica's first-floor bedroom. The area around the top of the basement staircase was heavily bloodstained. A bloodstained lead pipe lay on the floor. Pictures hanging from the staircase walls were askew and a metal banister rail was damaged. At the foot of <b>the</b> <b>stairs,</b> two cups and saucers lay in a pool of blood. Rivett's arm protruded from the canvas sack, which lay in a slowly expanding pool of blood. The light fitting at the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> was missing its bulb; one was noted nearby, on a chair. Blood was also found on various leaves in the adjoining rear garden.|$|E
5|$|Calhoun {{died at the}} Old Brick Capitol {{boarding}} house in Washington, D.C., on March 31, 1850, of tuberculosis, {{at the age of}} 68. He was interred at the St. Philip's Churchyard in Charleston, South Carolina. During the Civil War, a group of Calhoun's friends were concerned about the possible desecration of his grave by Federal troops and, during the night, removed his coffin to a hiding place under <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> of the church. The next night, his coffin was buried in an unmarked grave near the church, where it remained until 1871, when it was again exhumed and returned to its original place.|$|E
50|$|Removal of the 20th century {{staircase}} {{exposed the}} original outline of <b>the</b> early <b>stair.</b> <b>The</b> Smiths have recreated <b>the</b> <b>stair</b> with old materials where possible, including a newel post from a demolished Coweta {{home of the}} same era.|$|R
50|$|On the {{windmill}} tower's interior {{the single}} volume spaces of each floor are punctuated by <b>the</b> hexagonal <b>stair</b> which connects <b>the</b> {{ground with the}} observatory house. The ground floor is a concrete slab while the upper floors are timber-framed with timber floor boards of hoop pine (Araucaria cunninghamii). <b>The</b> <b>stair</b> winds around a central newel and is lined with tongue-and-groove vertical boards. The treads were strengthened and protected from further wear during the 1988 conservation work. The bottom of <b>the</b> <b>stair</b> posts are founded in the ground floor concrete slab. <b>The</b> <b>stair</b> timbers are largely red cedar (Toona australis), expect for the boarding, which is hoop pine.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, an {{algorithm}} for autonomous stair climbing with a {{tracked vehicle}} is presented. The proposed method achieves robust performance under real-world conditions, without assuming {{prior knowledge of}} <b>the</b> <b>stair</b> geometry, <b>the</b> dynamics of the vehicle’s interaction with <b>the</b> <b>stair</b> surface, or lighting conditions. The approach relies on fast and accurate estimation of the robot’s heading and its position relative to <b>the</b> <b>stair</b> boundaries. An extended Kalman filter is used for quaternion-based attitude estimation, fusing rotational velocity measurements from a 3 -axial gyroscope, and measurements of <b>the</b> <b>stair</b> edges acquired with an onboard camera. A two-tiered controller, comprised of a centering- and a heading-control module, utilizes the estimates to guide the robot rapidly, safely, and accurately upstairs. Both the theoretical analysis {{and implementation of the}} algorithm are presented in detail, and extensive experimental result...|$|R
5|$|For ten years, {{living at}} number four, Privet Drive, Harry is {{treated by the}} Dursleys more like a servant than {{a member of the}} family and is forced to live in a {{cupboard}} under <b>the</b> <b>stairs.</b> Shortly before his eleventh birthday, a series of letters addressed to Harry arrive, but Uncle Vernon destroys them before Harry can read them, leading to an influx of more and more letters. To evade the pursuit of these letters, Vernon first takes the family to a hotel, but when the letters arrive there too, he hires a boat out to a hut on a small island.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1902, Potter sketched the {{interior}} of the third Lakefield Cottage belonging to a Mrs. Lord. These drawings included a watercolour and pen-and-ink sketches of the living-room, pen-and-ink sketches of the pots of geraniums on the living-room window sill, the entrance passage, the pantry, <b>the</b> <b>stairs,</b> some of the upstairs rooms, and details of the carved oak furniture. In some of the sketches Potter roughly outlined a cat. She also sketched the village including the sloping path down to the Lakefield Cottages and the post office door. These became the backgrounds for The Pie and The Patty-Pan.|$|E
5|$|It {{begins with}} a shot of Wade's face and the guitar introduction. He then sings {{the first line of}} lyrics, which is {{followed}} by a transition to a boy lying on a bed shirtless. As the video switches between Wade and the boy, it zooms on the bed frame (which has the same face from the album cover) and opens into another area. The boy is then seen walking around the new area looking around until he goes up nearby stairs. While going up <b>the</b> <b>stairs,</b> the video switches between shots of the boy going up <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> and Wade singing the lyrics. Once up <b>the</b> <b>stairs,</b> the boy looks around and then walks into a bright light that he sees nearby. He walks through the bright archway into a dark room as the video switches to Lifehouse playing the song. After this, it switches to the boy as he looks up and the camera zooms out to reveal that he is in a giant maze. He then walks back where he came from to find that he is in a house with Lifehouse playing on the television. He then jumps off a window sill and appears tiny as he walks up to a book that is bigger than him. It then transitions to Lifehouse playing the song as the boy gets up on a chair which slowly transcends into his original bed. The video then zooms out on the boy lying on his bed and then switches to the band. It ends with the boy walking into darkness and Wade's face looking on the floor.|$|E

5|$|Later that evening, Benjamin Horne {{is meeting}} with Mr. Tojamura at The Great Northern. Mr. Tojamura gives Horne {{a check for}} $5 million to {{purchase}} the lands of the Packard Sawmill. Immediately after accepting the check, Sheriff Truman, Deputy Hawk, and Agent Cooper enter Horne's office. Truman arrests Horne for murder. Horne attempts to flee but is restrained and handcuffed. At the Palmer home, a severely impaired Sarah Palmer crawls down <b>the</b> <b>stairs,</b> crying to Leland for help. A phonograph is spinning in the background, its needle skipping {{at the end of}} the record.|$|E
5|$|Later, the gangsters whom Chengcai {{bumped into}} earlier beat him up.

On his deathbed, Mr. Lim tells Chengcai that he loves him and that he should pursue his talent for fighting and then die. Witnessing this scene, the principal is touched and allows Chengcai to return to school. The boy eventually becomes an internationally recognised martial artist.|$|E
5|$|Martin Ritt, having {{directed}} The Long, Hot Summer on suggestion by Ravetch, then {{directed the}} couple's next collaboration, The Sound and the Fury (1959), once again {{an adaptation of}} a William Faulkner novel.
