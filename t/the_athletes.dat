40|$|BACKGROUND: Recent {{studies found}} that <b>the</b> <b>athlete's</b> age of <b>the</b> best ultra-marathon {{performance}} was higher than <b>the</b> <b>athlete's</b> age of <b>the</b> best marathon performance {{and it seemed that}} <b>the</b> <b>athlete's</b> age of peak ultra-marathon performance increased in distance-limited races with rising distance. METHODS: We investigated <b>the</b> <b>athlete's</b> age of peak ultra-marathon performance in the fastest finishers in time-limited ultra-marathons from 6 hrs to 10 d. Running performance and <b>athlete's</b> age of <b>the</b> fastest women and men competing in 6 hrs, 12 hrs, 24 hrs, 48 hrs, 72 hrs, 144 hrs (6 d) and 240 hrs (10 d) were analysed for races held between 1975 and 2012 using analysis of variance and multi-level regression analysis. RESULTS: <b>The</b> <b>athlete's</b> ages of <b>the</b> ten fastest women ever in 6 hrs, 12 hrs, 24 hrs, 48 hrs, 72 hrs, 6 d and 10 d were 41 [*]±[*] 9, 41 [*]±[*] 6, 42 [*]±[*] 5, 46 [*]±[*] 5, 44 [*]±[*] 6, 42 [*]±[*] 4, and 37 [*]±[*] 4 yrs, respectively. <b>The</b> <b>athlete's</b> age of <b>the</b> ten fastest women was different between 48 hrs and 10 d. For men, <b>the</b> <b>athlete's</b> ages were 35 [*]±[*] 6, 37 [*]±[*] 9, 39 [*]±[*] 8, 44 [*]±[*] 7, 48 [*]±[*] 3, 48 [*]±[*] 8 and 48 [*]±[*] 6 yrs, respectively. <b>The</b> <b>athlete's</b> age of <b>the</b> ten fastest men in 6 hrs and 12 hrs was lower than <b>the</b> <b>athlete's</b> age of <b>the</b> ten fastest men in 72 hrs, 6 d and 10 d, respectively. CONCLUSION: <b>The</b> <b>athlete's</b> age of peak ultra-marathon performance did not increase with rising race duration in the best ultra-marathoners. For the fastest women ever in time-limited races, <b>the</b> <b>athlete's</b> age was lowest in 10 d (~ 37 yrs) and highest in 48 hrs (~ 46 yrs). For men, <b>the</b> <b>athlete's</b> age of <b>the</b> fastest ever in 6 hrs (~ 35 yrs) and 12 hrs (~ 37 yrs) was lower than <b>the</b> <b>athlete's</b> age of <b>the</b> ten fastest in 72 hrs (~ 48 yrs), 6 d (~ 48 yrs) and 10 d (~ 48 yrs). The differences in <b>the</b> <b>athlete's</b> age of peak performance between female and male ultra-marathoners for the different race durations need further investigations...|$|R
50|$|In this technique, <b>the</b> <b>athlete</b> {{is again}} behind his {{opponent}}, has {{the left arm}} of his opponent trapped, and is pulling back on his right arm. The trapped left arm is bent, with the fingers and palm trapped inside the armpit of <b>the</b> <b>athlete.</b> To trap <b>the</b> left arm, <b>the</b> <b>athlete</b> has pushed (from outside) his own left arm underneath the left elbow of <b>the</b> opponent. <b>The</b> <b>athlete's</b> left hand ends up pressing down on the scapula region of his opponent's back. This position does not permit the opponent to pull out his hand from <b>the</b> <b>athlete's</b> armpit and puts pressure on the left shoulder. The right arm of <b>the</b> <b>athlete</b> is pulling back at the opponent's right wrist (or forearm). In this way, <b>the</b> <b>athlete</b> keeps <b>the</b> right arm of his opponent straightened and tightly pulled against his right hip/lower abdomen area, which results in an arm bar putting pressure on the right elbow. <b>The</b> <b>athlete</b> is in full contact {{on top of the}} opponent, with his right leg in front of the right leg of the opponent to block him from escaping by rolling forward.|$|R
5|$|However, another {{obstacle}} arose {{with the}} Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, {{which resulted in}} a boycott of the Games by {{a large part of the}} Western World, led by the United States. The Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser was also the patron of the Australian Olympic Committee, and significant political pressure came to bear on <b>the</b> <b>athletes</b> to boycott the Games. Tonelli, however, realised that only the sportspeople would suffer from a boycott and that trade relations would continue unabated. He took a leadership role among <b>the</b> <b>athletes</b> to fight for their right to compete.|$|E
5|$|Many of <b>the</b> <b>athletes</b> {{competed in}} several sports because each country {{selected}} their team based on versatility of sporting ability {{to reduce their}} team size and costs.|$|E
5|$|The closing {{ceremony}} of the Paralympic Games takes place after all sporting events have concluded. Flag-bearers from each participating country enter, followed by <b>the</b> <b>athletes</b> who enter together, without any national distinction.|$|E
40|$|The {{rudiments of}} sports skills by <b>the</b> <b>athlete</b> during <b>the</b> {{early years of}} {{schooling}} can be developed further and improved upon during the university education period. The university setting can offer <b>the</b> <b>athlete</b> opportunity to excel in sport participation and in academics. Apart from the cognitive development of <b>the</b> <b>athlete</b> during university education, {{there is the possibility}} of exposure of <b>the</b> <b>athlete</b> to better equipment, good training facilities and services that can enhance <b>the</b> <b>athlete</b> 's performance in sportsThe university athlete needs to sustain high performance in sports and maintain adequate academic performance as well. <b>The</b> <b>athlete</b> needs to know how to utilise the resources available, to make him or her a top athlete, a successful and adjusted student. Ability to manage time adequately can ensure not only his/her active and adequate participation in sports but also his/her effective academic planning, in order to ensure success in both areas. Through counselling, <b>the</b> university <b>athlete</b> can develop awareness of what job opportunities his/her participation in sports can offer. <b>The</b> <b>athlete</b> can be assisted to recognise those social-psychological factors than can enhance performance and how his/her needs and special interest can be met. <b>The</b> <b>athlete</b> can also be assisted to learn about sports inspite of competing academic and other university demands...|$|R
5000|$|From {{a reverse}} waist lock set from the front, and staying with hips close to <b>the</b> {{opponent}}, <b>the</b> <b>athlete</b> lifts and rotates his opponent using {{the strength of}} his hips and legs (ἀναβαστάσαι εἰς ὕψος - anabastasai eis hypsos, [...] "high lifting"). Depending on <b>the</b> torque <b>the</b> <b>athlete</b> imparts, <b>the</b> opponent becomes more or less vertically inverted, facing the body of <b>the</b> <b>athlete.</b> If however <b>the</b> reverse waist lock is set {{from the back of the}} opponent, then the latter would face away from <b>the</b> <b>athlete</b> in <b>the</b> inverted position.|$|R

5|$|A model vaguely {{based on}} Glastonbury Tor (albeit with a tree {{instead of the}} tower) was {{incorporated}} into the opening ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. As <b>the</b> <b>athletes</b> entered the stadium, their flags were displayed on the terraces of the model.|$|E
5|$|Also {{part of the}} CEP are the Young Ambassadors Programme, Young Reporters Programme and Athlete Role Models.

5000|$|If <b>the</b> <b>athlete</b> {{gradually}} improves his jump height, {{the same}} platform height is continued until increases in jump height {{are no longer}} observed. At this time, takeoff height is increased by a few inches. If <b>the</b> <b>athlete</b> continually fails to jump very high, {{the height of the}} drop-down is lowered somewhat. [...] Most important here is how high <b>the</b> <b>athlete</b> jumps after <b>the</b> drop-down.|$|R
50|$|It is {{noteworthy}} that CAS had already issued an award suspending an <b>athlete</b> based on <b>the</b> longitudinal profiling of the biological markers before {{the adoption of the}} ABP by the IFs federations: in CAS 2009/A/1912 & 1913 Pechstein, the Panel suspended an Olympic <b>athlete</b> after <b>the</b> biological data showed irregular blood values. According to CAS, those abnormal values were not caused by an error occurred in a laboratory, as <b>the</b> <b>athlete</b> asserted, but due to the banned manipulation of <b>the</b> <b>athlete’s</b> blood. <b>The</b> essential difference between ABP judgments and the CAS 2009/A/1912 & 1913 consists in that in the latter case <b>the</b> <b>athlete’s</b> blood data was drawn from a sample <b>the</b> <b>athlete</b> gave at <b>the</b> federations championships and therefore not from data gathered by an official systematic program run by <b>the</b> <b>athlete’s</b> union.|$|R
5000|$|The {{simplest}} {{method to}} measure an athlete's vertical jump {{is to get}} <b>the</b> <b>athlete</b> to reach up against a flat wall, with a flat surface under his/her feet (such as a gym floor or concrete) and record the highest point he/she can reach flat-footed (this {{is referred to as}} [...] "standing reach"); fingertips powdered with chalk can facilitate the determination of points touched on <b>the</b> wall. <b>The</b> <b>athlete</b> then makes an effort to jump as high as possible (usually from a standstill) and touch the wall at the apex of <b>the</b> jump; <b>the</b> <b>athlete</b> can perform these jumps as many times as needed. The highest point <b>the</b> <b>athlete</b> touches is recorded. Next, the distance between these two recorded points is measured. This distance is <b>the</b> <b>athlete's</b> standing vertical jump.|$|R
5|$|Although the SYOGOC did {{not keep}} an {{official}} medal tally, news outlets, such as xinmsn, kept unofficial medal tables, where medals won by mixed-NOCs teams are credited to the NOCs that <b>the</b> <b>athletes</b> belong to.

See 2010 Summer Youth Olympics medal table for more details and a full table with medals won by mixed-NOCs teams counted separately.|$|E
5|$|Greek {{officials}} and the public were enthusiastic about the experience of hosting an Olympic Games.

40|$|<b>The</b> overhead-throwing <b>athlete</b> is a {{challenging}} sports medicine patient. The repetitive microtraumatic stresses imposed on <b>the</b> <b>athlete’s</b> shoulder joint complex during the throwing motion constantly places <b>the</b> <b>athlete</b> {{at risk for}} injury. These stresses may effect several adaptations to normal shoulder range of motion, strength, and scapula position. The clinician should therefore appreciate the unique physical characteristics of <b>the</b> overhead-throwing <b>athlete</b> to accurately evaluate and treat throwing-related injuries...|$|R
50|$|If {{during a}} jump <b>the</b> <b>athlete's</b> {{prosthesis}} falls off and lands {{closer to the}} takeoff board than <b>the</b> <b>athlete,</b> <b>the</b> mark is taken where the prosthesis landed.

5|$|In International elite competition, {{electronically}} tethered starting blocks {{sense the}} reaction time of <b>the</b> <b>athletes.</b> If the athlete reacts {{in less than}} 0.1 second, an alert sounds for a recall starter and the offending athlete is guilty of a false start.|$|E
50|$|The {{classification}} {{process begins}} with an assessment of <b>the</b> <b>athlete's</b> level of disability {{to determine if the}} minimum eligibility requirements for wheelchair rugby are met. These require that an athlete have a neurological disability that involves at least three limbs, or a non-neurological disability that involves all four limbs. <b>The</b> <b>athlete</b> then completes a series of muscle tests designed to evaluate the strength and range of motion of the upper limbs and trunks. A classification can then be assigned to <b>the</b> <b>athlete.</b> Classification frequently includes subsequent observation of <b>the</b> <b>athlete</b> in competition to confirm that physical function in game situations reflects what was observed during muscle testing.|$|R
5000|$|The music video, which {{revolves}} around a male high school student, {{begins with a}} presumably English teacher handing out a failing grade to the protagonist.

5|$|In {{keeping with}} an {{existing}} tradition for Australian gold medallists at the Summer Olympics, Bradbury, Camplin and Begg-Smith's victories were recognised by Australia Post, which released stamps depicting their triumphs, and gave <b>the</b> <b>athletes</b> royalties {{for the use}} of their image. Due to the relative lack of interest in winter sport in Australia, both Camplin and Bradbury had been without sponsorship before their Olympic triumphs, and were effectively broke.|$|E
5|$|Mutiny of the Matoika is {{the common}} name for the events in July 1920 {{involving}} {{a large portion of}} the Olympic team of the United States while on board the U.S. Army transport ship , headed to Antwerp for the 1920 Summer Olympics. Princess Matoika was a last-minute substitute for another ship and, according to <b>the</b> <b>athletes,</b> did not have adequate accommodations or training facilities on board. Near the end of the voyage, <b>the</b> <b>athletes</b> published a list of grievances and demands and distributed copies of the document to the United States Secretary of War, the American Olympic Committee (AOC) members, and the press. The incident received wide coverage in American newspapers at the time and was still being discussed in the popular press years later. The event was not a mutiny in the traditional sense, but has been called that since the mid-1930s.|$|E
