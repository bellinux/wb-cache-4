40|$|Translation {{agencies}} are introducing sta- tistical machine translation (SMT) {{into the work}} flow of human translators. Typ- ically, SMT produces a first-draft transla- tion, which is then post-edited by a per- son. SMT has met much resistance from translators, partly because of professional conservatism, but partly because the SMT community has often neglected some practical aspects of translation. Our paper discusses one of these: transferring formatting tags such as bold or italic from the source to the target document with a low error rate, thus freeing the post-editor from having to reformat SMT-generated text. In our 2 ̆ 01 ctwo-stream 2 ̆ 01 d approach, <b>tags</b> are <b>stripped</b> from the input to the decoder, then reinserted into the resulting target-language text.

40|$|Piperonyl butoxide is a {{synergist}} {{used in a}} {{wide variety}} of pesticides (1). Synergists are chemicals that lack pesticidal effects of their own but enhance the pesticidal properties of other chemicals (2). Piperonyl butoxide is used in pesticides containing chemicals such as pyrethrins, pyrethroids, rotenone, and carbamates (1, 3). See the Pesticide Label box above. $ Researchers developed piperonyl butoxide in 1947 using naturally-occurring safrole as a key raw material (1, 3). $ Piperonyl butoxide is a colorless to pale yellow liquid. It does not dissolve in water and is stable to breakdown by water and ultraviolet light. Researchers consider piperonyl butoxide to be noncorrosive (4). How does piperonyl butoxide work? $ Piperonyl butoxide inhibits breakdown of pesticides by insects (3, 5). Without piperonyl butoxide, an insect may degrade a pesticide before an effect can occur. The addition of piperonyl butoxide to a pesticide reduces the amount of pesticide required to be effective (2). What types of products contain piperonyl butoxide? $ Pesticides for indoor home use such as dusts, sprays, and foggers $ Pesticides for gardens, lawns, and decorative plants $ Agricultural pesticides for food and nonfood crops $ Mosquito control products $ Termite treatments $ Veterinary pesticide products $ Animal ear <b>tags</b> and pest <b>strips</b> $ Pesticides for human clothing, bedding, and mattresses NPTN General Fact Sheets are designed to answer questions that are commonly asked by the general public about pesticides that are regulated by the U.

40|$|Abstract—In {{two decades}} the web became a {{standard}} framework for Internet applications. This involved changing from an initially simple hypermedia access platform {{to a complex}} blob of different technologies. This complexity associated to the increasing filtering of TCP/UDP ports everywhere in the Internet, turned web applications into favourite targets for cyber-criminals. The Web Application Protection (WAP) tool aims to secure web applications by analysing and automatically fixing their source code [1] 1. WAP currently handles PHP code, in which most web applications are written. As of April 2014, WAP {{has been used to}} process more than 1. 5 million lines of code. This short paper briefly presents the tool and ongoing work on evolving it. I. THE WAP APPROACH The WAP approach brings to source code analysis a tension observed in Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs). These systems have been classified in two main categories. Knowledge-based IDSs contain a database of attack signatures created manually by human beings. Behaviour-based IDSs, on the contrary, learn about attacks – or normal behaviour – automatically using labelled data sets. Our approach uses a hybrid of two analog approaches. WAP searches for input validation vulnerabilities in PHP source code: cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, remote and local file inclusion, path traversal, OS command injection, and a few more. First, the tool has knowledge crafted manually about how to find these vulnerabilities. More specifically, it does taint analysis: it verifies if inputs can reach sensitive functions (sensitive sinks) without proper sanitisation or validation (taint analysis in Fig. 1). The lists of input entry points, sensitive sinks, and sanitisation/validation functions are produced by humans. Examples for XSS are in Table I Entry points Sensitive sinks Sanitisation functions $ GET echo htmlentities $ POST print htmlspecialchars $ COOKIE printf <b>strip</b> <b>tags</b> $ REQUEST die urlencod...|$|R
40|$|Problem statement: Because of {{dramatic}} declines in stocks of endangered Caspian brown trout males, Salmo trutta caspius in Caspian Sea, each male brooder is stripped indispensably {{more than once}} during the spawning season in other to artificial insemination in hatchery. The aim {{of the present study}} was to assay the changes of indicators of semen quality (sperm motility, sperm production, semen volume and chemical composition of seminal fluid) during these sequential strippings. Approach: The 11 <b>tagged</b> males were <b>stripped</b> four times every 12 - 14 days with beginning of spermiation period (2 December 2008) towards its end (10 January 2008). One-way Analysis Of Variance (ANOVA) was employed to analyze differences between means of semen parameters. Also, the relationships between semen parameters were tested using the bivariate correlation coefficients of Pearson. Results: The semen volume, sperm density, osmolality and the concentrations of Na +, Cl -, K +, Ca 2 +, Mg 2 + and total protein gradually decreased whereas the values of glucose and triglyceride had no significant changes during sequential strippings. Also, the values of semen pH, the percentage (5 s post-activation) and duration of motility were statistically stable until third stripping but a decrease was recorded for these parameters in the fourth stripping. As well as, significant positive correlations were found for sperm density vs. K +, Cl -, Na +, Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, total protein, spermatocrit; the percentage of motile spermatozoa Vs Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, K +, Cl -, Na +, total protein and also the duration of motility Vs K +, Cl -, total protein and pH. Conclusion: The semen quality of Caspian brown trout males decrease in successive strippings during spawning season. Also, the knowledge on values and correlations between the sperm motility characteristics and the composition of seminal fluid could be useful to formulation of a species-specific extender solution for cryopreservation of semen of Caspian brown trout...|$|R

40|$|The European clam Ruditapes decussatus is {{native to}} the Mediterranean Sea and Atlantic coasts and, while its {{production}} is still relatively low in Europe (8 200 tons/year; FAO, 2006), it is a high value seafood product and economically important in many Mediterranean countries (mainly Portugal, Italy and Spain). R. decussatus culture relies mainly on natural recruitment of seed, therefore is limited by its availability, which is subject to high annual fluctuations. Over the last years, drops in natural recruitment affected the demand of hatchery seed, increasing the interest in artificial spawning and larval rearing. However {{little is known about}} the best hatching practices and the biological processes of R. decussatus influencing gamete maturation and competency. In order to address these questions and improve hatchery production as an alternative source of seed, a transcriptomic study of different larval stages and oocytes was performed following a multiplexing strategy on the Illumina platform HiSeq 2000. cDNA <b>tagged</b> libraries for <b>stripped</b> oocytes, spawned eggs, larvae 48 hpf, larvae 17, 21 and 30 dpf were constructed and a 6 -plex paired-end sequencing lane (2 x 100 bp) was performed, obtaining more than 290 million reads. In order to obtain a most complete representation of the clam transcriptome, all Illumina data were merged with approximately 5, 000 publicly available Sanger sequences and nearly 500, 000 reads previously obtained with 454 sequencing of larvae, gonads and several adult tissues. Several strategies were tested in order to find the most effective assembly. A mixed strategy was preferred by using two different assembler software (MIRA 3 and CLC Genomic Workbench) obtaining a total of 366, 433 contigs. A merge was carried out through CAP 3 and the amount of metacontigs was 48, 329. The contigs not merged in CAP 3 were joined to all the metacontigs obtaining a final transcriptome scaffold of 236, 646 contigs. A preliminary annotation of 60, 986 contigs (25, 8 %) was attained through Batch Blast similarity searches locally conducted against Danio rerio and Drosophila melanogaster Ensembl protein database. To obtain gene expression values of each contig, Illumina reads of oocytes and larval stages were mapped against the assembled reference transcriptome and RPKM (Reads Per Kilobase of exon model per Million mapped reads) were calculated. A RPKM threshold value of 1 was arbitrarily set to detect the presence of a transcript. Of 2, 886 expressed contigs in spawned oocytes, 709 were annotated (against D. rerio) and characterized through the Gene Ontology (GO) analysis and the KEGG pathways identification. It was highlighted that most of the eggs expressed genes play an important role in the main biological processes for energy production, translation and cell cycle. In addition several genes with a role in oocyte maturation were identified. Finally, a comparison of sequence reads obtained from mature oocytes with those from other developmental stages identified a large set of transcripts (2, 393) that appear to be exclusively expressed in released egg cells, suggesting that the oocyte transcriptome is very specific...|$|R
