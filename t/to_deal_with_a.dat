5|$|Antigonus entered Sparta triumphantly, {{its first}} foreign conqueror. Nevertheless, he treated the {{population}} generously and humanely. He ordered that the reforms of Cleomenes be revoked, and restored the ephors, {{although he did}} not force Sparta to join the League. However, Antigonus' failure to restore the Spartan Kings suggests to historian Graham Shipley that this restoration of laws was a sham. Within three days, he left Sparta and returned to Macedon <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Dardani invasion, leaving a garrison in Acrocorinth and Orchomenos. With Cleomenes' defeat, Sparta's power collapsed and it fell into the hands of successive tyrants.|$|E
5|$|As {{opposed to}} film makers, virtual camera system creators have <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{world that is}} {{interactive}} and unpredictable.

To solve this issue, the system relies on certain rules or artificial intelligence to select the most appropriate shots.|$|E

During this time, Loxton was also active in cricket administration at club, state and international level. He was a state selector for over two decades, and served at national level for ten years, starting in 1970–71. He was also the team manager for Australia's tour of the subcontinent in 1959–60, overseeing a successful campaign despite a spate of serious illnesses to personnel. Loxton had <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> variety of tumultuous events on and off the field during his tenure, often relating to player misconduct, and retired from cricket administration in 1981 following the underarm incident.|$|E

5|$|After the {{southern}} campaign, the Commonwealth had <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{threat from the}} north, as the armistice, ending the Polish–Swedish War (1600–1629) was expiring. The majority of Polish nobles preferred {{to solve the problem}} through negotiations, unwilling to pay taxes for a new war, provided that Sweden was open to negotiations and concessions (in particular, to retreat from the occupied Polish coastal territories). Władysław himself was hoping for a war, which could yield some more significant territorial gains, and even managed to gather a sizeable army, with navy elements, near the disputed territories. Sweden, weakened by involvement in the Thirty Years' War, was however open to a peaceful solution. Władysław could not go against the decision of the Sejm and Senate, and agreed to support the treaty. Thus both sides agreed to sign the Armistice of Stuhmsdorf (Sztumska Wieś) on 12 September 1635, favourable to the Commonwealth, which regained the Prussian territories, and called for a reduction of the Swedish tolls on the maritime trade.|$|E
5|$|All {{organisms are}} {{constantly}} exposed to compounds that they cannot use as foods {{and would be}} harmful if they accumulated in cells, as they have no metabolic function. These potentially damaging compounds are called xenobiotics. Xenobiotics such as synthetic drugs, natural poisons and antibiotics are detoxified {{by a set of}} xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes. In humans, these include cytochrome P450 oxidases, UDP-glucuronosyltransferases, and glutathione S-transferases. This system of enzymes acts in three stages to firstly oxidize the xenobiotic (phase I) and then conjugate water-soluble groups onto the molecule (phase II). The modified water-soluble xenobiotic can then be pumped out of cells and in multicellular organisms may be further metabolized before being excreted (phase III). In ecology, these reactions are particularly important in microbial biodegradation of pollutants and the bioremediation of contaminated land and oil spills. Many of these microbial reactions are shared with multicellular organisms, but due to the incredible diversity of types of microbes these organisms are able <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> far wider range of xenobiotics than multicellular organisms, and can degrade even persistent organic pollutants such as organochloride compounds.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{eventually}} bowled England out for 441, {{leaving them}} {{a target of}} 98 on the final day. Bradman’s openers progressed quickly {{at the start of}} the chase. Barnes took 13 runs from the opening over by Bedser, but Morris again lacked fluency. Australia reached 38 from 32 minutes when Bedser bowled Morris for nine, but the tourists steadied to reach their target with eight wickets in hand. After bowling several balls that moved away, Bedser caught out Morris with an inswinger. Morris had developed a habit of trying to defend the ball to the leg side while shuffling towards the off, and was not in a position <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> ball that hurried off the pitch. Following the match, Fingleton criticised Morris, feeling that he was shuffling across the crease too much instead of playing from the back foot.|$|E

5|$|By {{the start}} of the 20th century it was clear that Gibraltar could be bombarded with {{relative}} impunity from the Spanish mainland. Proposals were put forward to build a new harbour {{on the east side of}} the Rock, where ships would be less vulnerable to direct artillery fire from the mainland, but were abandoned due to the vast expense and only marginal gains in security. A new round of tunnelling was carried out to provide more bombproof accommodation for the garrison, along with deep shelters and casemates capable of accommodating 2,000 men. Ultimately it was decided in 1906 that Gibraltar faced no credible threat from land and that the defences would be organised <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> threat from the sea.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} in office, Ross {{proposed}} tax reform laws intended to provide for more equitable assessments of propertyat that time, people were allowed to assess their own belongings with little oversight. The legislature passed his recommendations, and approved his plan to exert more control over school funds and to require local taxation to support the public schools. He also encouraged the legislature to enact antitrust laws. These were passed March 30, 1889, a full year before the federal government enacted the Sherman Antitrust Act. His reform acts were beneficial for the state, leading Ross to become the only Texas governor to call a special session of the legislature <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> treasury surplus.|$|E

On the first day, Price was thrown from his horse and sent back to his hotel to recover. The actor returned to work the following day. Towards the end of filming, a strike was called when the British technicians union learned the production company was not hiring a large enough crew as required by union rules. After an extra man was hired, the crew resumed working. On two occasions, Reeves was short of actors. Waddilove replaced an absent actor as a Roundhead officer during Wymark's one-day scene.

5|$|It {{was soon}} {{established}} {{that some of}} the pirates were from Cabo Rojo, since they disembarked there. Undercover agents were sent to the town to track them, and new mayor Juan Font y Soler requested resources <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> larger group which was out of control. Links between the pirates and local sympathizers made arresting them difficult. The central government, frustrated with Cabo Rojo's inefficiency, demanded the pirates' capture and western Puerto Rico military commander José Rivas was ordered to exert pressure on local authorities. Although Cofresí was tracked to the beach in Peñones, near his brothers' homes in Guaniquilla, the operation only recovered the Johns sails, meat, flour, cheese, lard, butter and candles; the pirates escaped aboard a schooner. A detachment caught Juan José Mateu and charged him with conspiracy; his confession linked Cofresí to the two hijackings.|$|E
5|$|The match {{followed}} a familiar pattern of Arsenal dictating {{the pace and}} creating chances, but failing to breach the Liverpool defence. Arsenal had a penalty appeal turned down in the first half, when defender Stéphane Henchoz handled the ball to deny Thierry Henry a goalscoring opportunity. Henchoz's partner Sami Hyypiä {{made a series of}} goalline clearances during the second half, but was helpless to stop Arsenal taking the lead in the 72nd minute. Liverpool responded by making changes and equalised in the 83rd minute; Arsenal's failure <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> free-kick presented Michael Owen the chance to score. Owen then outpaced Lee Dixon and Tony Adams to score his second and the match winner, two minutes before the end of normal time. Liverpool's victory marked the second part of their unique treble of the 2000–01 season: they had won the League Cup in late February and added the UEFA Cup four days later.|$|E
5|$|The team's {{previous}} experience was with turn-based combat games, and it struggled {{to develop a}} real-time combat system affected by customizable attributes and abilities that provided feedback to the player on how those statistics were affecting the battle.
