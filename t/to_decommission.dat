5|$|In 1999, MDOT {{petitioned the}} American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials <b>to</b> <b>decommission</b> the US27 {{designation}} in the state; {{the change was}} approved on April 16, 1999. The state waited until 2002 to make the change. After the change was implemented, Bus. US27 was renumbered to Bus. US127 as {{with all of the}} other similar business routes in the state. However, unlike the other new Bus. US127s, this one had no connection to US127, its new parent highway. MDOT has retained the business route as an unsigned trunkline designation ever since.|$|E
5|$|In {{the middle}} of June, City Council Speaker Gifford Miller visited the zoo, and {{in a press conference}} {{outlined}} some of the pragmatic consequences of closure: a savings estimated by the city of $6 million for both facilities that would be offset by a WCS estimated expenditure of $8 million, <b>to</b> <b>decommission</b> facilities and — on short notice — find homes for 160 displaced animals. If the estimates were correct, reasoning went, it would be cheaper to run the zoos than to shut them down.|$|E

After {{a meeting at}} Scapa Flow later in July between Sims, Jellicoe, and Admiral David Beatty (commander of the Grand Fleet), the Admiralty requested that the U.S. Navy send four dreadnoughts and six destroyers to join the Grand Fleet. The Admiralty intended that {{the arrival of the}} American dreadnoughts would allow it <b>to</b> <b>decommission</b> five ships of the pre-dreadnought , freeing up four thousand officers and ratings to serve on new light cruisers, destroyers, and submarines then under construction.|$|E

In December 2007, shortly after the 2007 federal election, the Australian government announced that planning for a Collins-class replacement (procurement project SEA 1000) had commenced. The 2009 Defending Australia in the Asia Pacific Century: Force 2030 white paper confirmed the replacement project, and announced that the submarine fleet would be increased to twelve vessels to sustain submarine operations in any conflict, and counter the growing potency of Asian-Pacific naval forces.|$|E
5|$|An {{expressway}} through Isabella and Clare counties {{opened in}} late 1961, and US27 was rerouted to follow it, bypassing Clare to the east. The former route of US27 along McEwan Street and Clare Avenue was designated Bus. US27 at this time. A freeway bypass north of Clare and Farwell opened in 1975, and US10 was rerouted along the US27 freeway to connect {{from the new}} bypass to the existing freeway east of the city, bypassing both cities. The section of US10 in downtown Clare was designated Bus. US10 at this time, running along Bus. US27 to connect to US27/US10 north of downtown.

5|$|Following the 1991 Gulf War and the {{subsequent}} dissolution of the Soviet Union, the United States Navy began <b>to</b> <b>decommission</b> and mothball many of the ships it had brought out of its reserve fleet in the drive to attain a 600-ship Navy. At the height of Navy Secretary John F. Lehman's 600-ship Navy plan, nearly 600ships of all types were active within the Navy. This included fifteen aircraft carriers, four battleships and over 100submarines, along with various other types of ships the overall plan specified. When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 the Navy sought to return to its traditional, 313-ship composition. While reducing the fleet created under the 600-ship Navy program, {{the decision was made}} to deactivate the four recommissioned Iowa-class battleships and return them to the reserve fleet.|$|E

5|$|The {{multiple}} explosions gutted the superstructure {{between the}} mainmast and the rear funnel and collapsed the superstructure surrounding the mainmast. The ship's side between Frames 74 and 84 was ripped open {{down to the}} lower edge of the armour belt and all the machinery in this area was destroyed. After {{it was estimated that}} it would take seven million francs and two years to fully repair Iéna it was decided <b>to</b> <b>decommission</b> the ship and use her as a target ship. All useful equipment was removed and she was towed to a mooring off the Île des Porquerolles where she was used as a target to test the effectiveness of the latest design of armour-piercing shells beginning on 9 August 1909. After the completion of numerous tests, and with Iéna close to , she was towed to deeper water. While under tow Iéna capsized and sank on 2 December 1909. The rights to the wreck were sold and she was subsequently broken up and salvaged between 1912 and 1927.|$|E
5|$|The lake {{played a}} role in the {{evacuation}} of federal troops from Texas at the onset of the American Civil War. As Texas considered whether to secede from the United States, General David E. Twiggs, commander of federal troops in Texas negotiated with state leaders concerning the transfer of federal property. After learning of such negotiations, the United States military moved <b>to</b> <b>decommission</b> Twiggs, and replace him with Colonel Carlos Waite. Texas viewed this move as a rejection of the negotiations and proceeded to forcefully claim the federal property. Twiggs, while awaiting relief from Waite, surrendered the property on the condition that federal troops could peacefully evacuate. They were allowed to depart, but only from the Texas coast. Waite arrived and relocated troops near Green Lake, where they could await coastal departure near an adequate source of freshwater. During the stay, Fort Sumter fell under siege, and Texas grew concerned about the concentration of armed federal troops in the area. With their respective nations now at war, Texas considered the deal with Twiggs void, and began to capture federal troops to force them to either join the Confederacy or be Prisoners of War. Some of the remaining uncaptured companies elsewhere in the state attempted to flee to Green Lake. Several regiments camped by the lake later in the war, and complained about mosquitos.|$|E
