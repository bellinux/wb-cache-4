5|$|Norwegian {{control over}} the Faroe Islands and Shetland was strong due to the {{importance}} of Bergen as a trading centre, while Orkney, the Hebrides and Man had more natural <b>ties</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Scottish mainland. Although traditionally having had <b>ties</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> community of Norse settlers in northern Scotland, Scottish rulers had increasingly asserted their sovereignty over the entire mainland. Haakon had at the same time gained stronger control of the Hebrides and Man than any Norwegian ruler since Magnus Barefoot. As part of a new development the Scottish king Alexander II claimed the Hebrides and requested to buy the islands from Norway, but Haakon staunchly rejected the proposals. Following Alexander II's death, his son Alexander III continued and stepped up his father's policy by sending an embassy to Norway in 1261, and thereafter attacking the Hebrides.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th and the {{beginning}} of the 20th centuries, Chile was engaged in an intense naval competition with its neighbor Argentina. This ended peacefully in 1902, but less than a decade later Argentina responded to Brazil's order for two dreadnoughts with two of its own. The Chilean congress responded by allocating money for its own dreadnoughts, which were ordered from the United Kingdom despite a strong push from the American government for the contracts, probably due to Chile's traditionally strong <b>ties</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> British.|$|E
5|$|During the 812–813 {{siege of}} Baghdad, Tahir had {{established}} close <b>ties</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> abnaʾ, which now proved useful in smoothing their acceptance of al-Ma'mun. Tahir was further rewarded with the governorship of Khurasan in September 821, {{and when he}} died in October 822, he was succeeded by his son, Talha. For the next fifty years, the Tahirid line would provide the governors of a vast eastern province centred on Khurasan, while also providing the governors of Baghdad, securing the city's loyalty to the caliphal government even after the capital was moved to Samarra.|$|E

5|$|Football is Croatia's {{most popular}} team sport, and the {{national}} team has developed an extensive fan-base since its official formation in 1991. Following Croatia's successful 1998 World Cup campaign, {{three years after the}} Croatian war of independence, there was a rapid rise in domestic and global attention for the national side. English journalist Marcus Tanner of Balkan Insight commented that the national team became a symbol of Croatian independence from Yugoslavia. However, after the death of former-president Franjo Tuđman, local political <b>ties</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> national team have loosened.|$|E
5|$|Hezbollah has close {{relations}} with Iran. It also has <b>ties</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> leadership in Syria, specifically President Hafez al-Assad (until {{his death in}} 2000) supported it. It's also a close Assad ally, and its leader pledged support to the embattled Syrian leader. Although Hezbollah and Hamas are not organizationally linked, Hezbollah provides military training as well as financial and moral support to the Sunni Palestinian group. Furthermore, Hezbollah is {{a strong supporter of}} the ongoing Al-Aqsa Intifada.|$|E
5|$|In 1911, Lipsett {{responded to}} the call from the Colonial Office for young staff {{officers}} to operate in colonial military academies, as military education had been standardised throughout the British Empire in 1909. Lipsett was sent to Canada and promoted to major (in 1913), working hard to improve training in the Dominion. He instigated numerous new training courses and special schools, establishing close <b>ties</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Canadian military establishment and personally training most {{of the next generation}} of Canadian staff officers and generals.|$|E

5|$|In January 1950, a fire {{broke out}} that {{destroyed}} over 2,500 huts, home to nearly 3,500 families and 17,000 total people. The disaster highlighted the need for proper fire prevention in the largely wooden-built squatter areas, complicated {{by the lack of}} political <b>ties</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> colonial and Chinese governments. The ruins gave new arrivals to the Walled City the opportunity to build anew, causing speculation that the fire may have been intentionally set.|$|E
5|$|In September 2006, Georgia {{became the}} second to be offered the Intensified Dialogue status, {{following}} a rapid change in foreign policy under President Mikheil Saakashvili, and what they perceived as a demonstration of military readiness during the 2006 Kodori crisis. Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Serbia similarly received offers at the April 2008 Bucharest summit. While their neighbors both requested and accepted the dialogue programme, Serbia's offer was presented to guarantee the possibility of future <b>ties</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> alliance.|$|E
5|$|Ivan Vladislav married Maria, {{possibly}} {{the daughter of}} Tsar Boris II of Bulgaria and a Byzantine noblewoman, by whom he left progeny. Maria was named zoste patrikia by Basil II, and the descendants of Ivan Vladislav entered Byzantine service, {{becoming part of the}} Byzantine nobility and forming close <b>ties</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Komnenos clan in particular. Both his daughter Catherine and an unnamed (possibly Anna) granddaughter married (future) Byzantine emperors. His second son Alusian took part in the Uprising of Petar Delyan against Byzantine rule but eventually betrayed the Bulgarian cause.|$|E

5|$|Legend has it {{that the}} Cailleach was tired from a long day herding deer. Atop Ben Cruachan she fell asleep on her watch and a well she was tending overflowed, running down from the {{highlands}} and flooding the valleys below, forming first a river and then the loch. The overflowing well is a common motif in local Gaelic creation tales - as seen in the goddess Boann's similar creation of the River Boyne in Ireland. Other connections to the region include her above-mentioned strong <b>ties</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> fierce whirlpool in the Gulf of Corryvreckan.|$|E
5|$|Nearing {{the end of}} {{his term}} in office Clarke decided not to run for {{re-election}} in 1883. He was losing too much support due to his <b>ties</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Hudson's Bay Company. The electorate suspected him of working under the influence of his office to locate important government offices on the land owned by the company. Two completely new candidates ran in the 1883 election, Captain Day Hort MacDowall and Dr. Andrew Everett Porter.|$|E
5|$|On October 29, 1861, a {{group of}} Kentuckians—Johnson among them—met at Russellville, Kentucky to discuss the {{formation}} of a Confederate government for the Commonwealth, believing the Unionist government in Frankfort did not represent the will of the majority of Kentucky's citizens. Johnson chaired the committee that authored the convention's final report, and personally introduced some of its key resolutions. The report called for a sovereignty convention to sever <b>ties</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Federal government. Johnson, Breckinridge, and Humphrey Marshall were among the notable members of the Committee of Ten that made arrangements for the convention.|$|E

5|$|Salih's wazīr was a Christian named Tadrus ibn al-Hasan, who wielded {{significant}} influence over him, according to Ibn al-'Adim, and accompanied Salih {{on all of}} his military campaigns. Aleppine Christians would largely monopolize the post of wazīr under later Mirdasid rulers, {{and members of the}} community managed significant parts of the emirate's economy. Their major role in the emirate indicated Salih's reliance on local Christian support, the existence of a large Christian minority in Aleppo and an effort to establish friendly <b>ties</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Byzantines.|$|E
5|$|Sarraj and Bizri wielded {{substantial}} {{influence in}} Syrian politics, checking {{the power of}} the political factions and purging Nasser's opponents from the officer corps. This was a source of concern for Quwatli, but he kept both men in their posts, partially due to pressure from Nasser. Quwatli further solidified his <b>ties</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> latter by appointing Akram al-Hawrani, the prominent Arab socialist leader, as speaker of parliament, and Salah al-Din Bitar, the co-founder of the pan-Arabist Ba'ath Party, as foreign affairs minister.|$|E
