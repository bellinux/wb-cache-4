5|$|Denied {{the use of}} compulsion, Chamberlain had {{to persuade}} Britons to {{volunteer}} for essential war work, and fit young workers to leave the factories and enter the Army. He had to address mass meetings and issue posters. He found that workers were reluctant to exchange <b>the</b> <b>comforts</b> <b>of</b> <b>home</b> and wartime salaries for the uncertainties of the trenches and a wage of one shilling a day. Chamberlain had little confidence in voluntary schemes and they indeed proved unsuccessful, with only 9,000workers freed to be drafted into the Army {{at a time when}} Britain was sustaining huge casualties.|$|E

2500|$|World War II was {{the decisive}} event that brought {{religious}} tolerance {{to the front}} in American life. Bruscino says [...] "the military had developed personnel policies that actively and completely mixed America's diverse white ethnic and religious population. The sudden removal from <b>the</b> <b>comforts</b> <b>of</b> <b>home,</b> the often degrading and humiliating experiences of military life, and the unit- and friendship-building of training leveled the man the activities meant to fill time support of in the military reminded the man of all they had in common as Americans. Under fire, the men survived by leaning on buddies, regardless of their ethnicity or religion." [...] After coming home, the veterans helped reshape American society. Brucino says that they used their positions of power [...] "to increase ethnic and religious tolerance. The sea change in ethnic and religious relations in the United States came from the military experience in World War II. The war remade the nation. The nation was forged in war." ...|$|E

60|$|The other object, of re-invigorating Mr. Ponsonby, had {{not been}} attained.

As for <b>the</b> <b>comforts</b> <b>of</b> <b>home,</b> he had none, for since his ordination his missions had ever been migrating. But he always dressed with care, and consequently with expense, for careful dressing is ever expensive. He always wore new black gloves, and a very long black coat which never degenerated to rust, black cloth trousers, a high black silk waistcoat, and a new black hat. Everything about him was black except his neck, and that was always scrupulously white.|$|E

Take any spirited fellow of twenty, and ask him whether he would like to go to Mexico for the next ten years!

60|$|Old Mazey, in his way, {{proved to}} be just as disreputably {{inclined}} on certain occasions as the dogs. At intervals, the original wildness in his nature broke out; he, too, lost all relish for <b>the</b> <b>comforts</b> <b>of</b> <b>home,</b> and ungratefully left the house. He usually disappeared in the afternoon, and returned at night as drunk as liquor could make him. He was by many degrees too seasoned a vessel to meet with any disasters on these occasions. His wicked old legs might take roundabout methods of progression, but they never failed him; his wicked old eyes might see double, but they always showed him the way home. Try as hard as they might, the servants could never succeed in persuading him that he was drunk; he always scorned the imputation. He even declined to admit the idea privately into his mind, until he had first tested his condition by an infallible criterion of his own.|$|E
6000|$|Such {{were the}} two girls at Popham Villa who were told on that evening that a new sister was to be brought home to them. When the next morning came they were of course still full of the subject. Sir Thomas was to go into London after breakfast, and he {{intended}} to walk over the bridge and catch an early train. He was as intent on being punctual to time {{as though he were}} bound to be all day in Court: and, fond as he might be of his daughters, had already enjoyed enough of <b>the</b> <b>comforts</b> <b>of</b> <b>home</b> to satisfy his taste. He did love his daughters;--but even with them he was not at his ease. The only society he could enjoy was that of his books or of his own thoughts, and the only human being whom he could endure to have long near him with equanimity was Joseph Stemm. He had risen at nine, as was his custom, and before ten he was bustling about with his hat and gloves. [...] "Papa," [...] said Clarissa, [...] "when shall you be home again?" ...|$|E
6000|$|There are {{situations}} in life which are beyond one. The sensible man realises this, and slides out of such situations, admitting himself beaten. Others try {{to grapple with}} them, but it never does any good. When affairs get into a real tangle, {{it is best to}} sit still and let them straighten themselves out. Or, if one does not do that, simply to think no more about them. This is Philosophy. The true philosopher is the man who says [...] "All right," [...] and goes to sleep in his arm-chair. One's attitude towards Life's Little Difficulties should be that of the gentleman in the fable, who sat down on an acorn one day, and happened to doze. The warmth of his body caused the acorn to germinate, and it grew so rapidly that, when he awoke, he found himself sitting in the fork of an oak, sixty feet from the ground. He thought he would go home, but, finding this impossible, he altered his plans. [...] "Well, well," [...] he said, [...] "if I cannot compel circumstances to my will, I can at least adapt my will to circumstances. I decide to remain here." [...] Which he did, and had a not unpleasant time. The oak lacked some of <b>the</b> <b>comforts</b> <b>of</b> <b>home,</b> but the air was splendid and the view excellent.|$|E

60|$|We had met, indeed, an {{occasional}} officer or orderly, {{huddled in a}} greatcoat and head against the wind, exercising those wonderful animals that are {{the pride of the}} British cavalry and which General Sir Douglas Haig, himself a cavalryman, some day hopes to bring into service. We had overtaken an artillery train rumbling along toward the east, the men laughing and joking as they rode, as though they were going to manoeuvres. Farther on, as the soldiers along the highroads and in the towns grew more and more numerous, they seemed so harmoniously part of the peaceful scene that war was as difficult to visualize as ever. Many sat about smoking their pipes and playing with the village children, others were in squads going to drill or exercise--something the Briton never neglects. The amazing thing to a visitor who has seen the trenches awash on a typical wet day, who knows that even billeting in cold farms and barns behind the lines can scarcely be compared to <b>the</b> <b>comforts</b> <b>of</b> <b>home,</b> is how these men keep well under the conditions.

6000|$|It {{was now the}} end of November; and {{it became}} a {{question}} how the intermediate time should be passed. The Countess was resolved that she would hold no pleasant intercourse at all with her daughter. She would not even tell the girl of her purpose of going abroad. From hour to hour she assured herself with still increasing obduracy that nothing but severity could avail anything. The girl must be cowed and frightened into absolute submission,--even though at the expense of her health. Even though it was to be effected by the absolute crushing of her spirits,--this must be done. Though at the cost of her life, it must be done. This woman had lived for the last twenty years with but one object before her eyes,--an object sometimes seeming to be near, more often distant, and not unfrequently altogether beyond her reach, but which had so grown upon her imagination as to become the heaven to which her very soul aspired. To be and to be known to be among the highly born, the so-called noble, the titled from old dates,--to be of those who were purely aristocratic, had been all the world to her. As a child,--the child of well-born but poor parents, she had received the idea. In following it out she had thrown all thoughts of love to the wind and had married a reprobate earl. Then had come her punishment,--or, as she had conceived it, her most unmerited misfortunes. For many years of her life her high courage and persistent demeanour had almost atoned for the vice of her youth. The love of rank was strong in her bosom as ever, but it was fostered for her child rather than for herself. Through long, tedious, friendless, poverty-stricken years she had endured all, still assuring herself that the day would come when the world should call the sweet plant that grew by her side by its proper name. The little children hooted after her daughter, calling her girl in derision The Lady Anna,--when Lady Anna had been more poorly clad and blessed with less of <b>the</b> <b>comforts</b> <b>of</b> <b>home</b> than any of them. Years would roll by, and they should live to know that the Lady Anna,--the sport of their infantine cruelty,--was Lady Anna indeed. And as the girl became a woman the dream was becoming a reality. The rank, the title, the general acknowledgment and the wealth would all be there. Then came the first great decisive triumph. Overtures of love and friendship were made from the other side. Would Lady Anna consent to become the Countess Lovel, all animosities might be buried, and everything be made pleasant, prosperous, noble, and triumphant! ...|$|E

Friedan notes that this was helped along {{by the fact that}} many of the women who worked during the war filling jobs previously filled by men faced dismissal, discrimination, or hostility when the men returned, and that educators blamed over-educated, career-focused mothers for the maladjustment of soldiers in World War II. Yet as Friedan shows, later studies found that overbearing mothers, not careerists, were the ones who raised maladjusted children.|$|R
