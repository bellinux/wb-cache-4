6000|$|... [Footnote 242: Those who are {{interested}} in the history of authorship may care to know the end of the matter. Copyright is no modern practice, and the perpetual right of authors, or persons to whom they had ceded it, was recognised in France through the whole of the seventeenth century and three-quarters of the eighteenth. The perpetuity of the right had produced literary properties of considerable value; for example, Boudot's Dictionary was sold by his executors for 24,000 livres; Prévot's Manual Lexicon and two Dictionaries for 115,000 livres. But in 1777--ten years after Diderot's plea--the Council decreed that copyright was a privilege and an exercise of the royal grace. The motives for this reduction of an author's right from a <b>transferable</b> <b>property</b> to a terminable privilege seem to have been, first, the general mania of the time for drawing up the threads of national life {{into the hands of the}} administration, and second, the hope of making money by a tariff of permissions. The Constituent Assembly dealt with the subject with no intelligence nor care, but the Convention passed a law recognising in the author an exclusive right for his life, and giving a property for ten years after his death to heirs or cessionaires. The whole history is elaborately set forth in the collection of documents entitled La Propriété littéraire au 18ième siècle. (Hachette, 1859.)] ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceDeep CNN-based object {{detection}} {{systems have}} achieved remarkable success on several large-scale object detection benchmarks. However, training such detectors requires {{a large number}} of labeled bounding boxes, which are more difficult to obtain than image-level annotations. Previous work addresses this issue by transforming image-level classifiers into object detectors. This is done by modeling {{the differences between the two}} on categories with both image-level and bounding box annotations, and transferring this information to convert classifiers to detectors for categories without bounding box annotations. We improve this previous work by incorporating knowledge about object similarities from visual and semantic domains during the transfer process. The intuition behind our proposed method is that visually and semantically similar categories should exhibit more common <b>transferable</b> <b>properties</b> than dissimilar categories, e. g. a better detector would result by transforming the differences between a dog classifier and a dog detector onto the cat class, than would by transforming from the violin class. Experimental results on the challenging ILSVRC 2013 detection dataset demonstrate that each of our proposed object similarity based knowledge transfer methods outperforms the baseline methods. We found strong evidence that visual similarity and semantic relatedness are complementary for the task, and when combined notably improve detection, achieving state-of-the-art detection performance in a semi-supervised setting...|$|R

Clifford seems unconcerned with Henry's ability to lead the country, and his desire for personal vengeance seems to outweigh any sense he has of aiding the House of Lancaster because he believes it to be the right thing to do. Similarly, Warwick's later actions in the play, as he himself acknowledges, have nothing to do with ensuring Henry remain king, but are based wholly on his personal feelings towards Edward; he is more concerned with bringing down the House of York than elevating the House of Lancaster. As such, [...] "the York-Warwick alliance degenerates into an inter-family feud, even more petty in its tit-for-tat predictability than York and Lancaster's squabbles."

The <b>transferable</b> <b>properties</b> of the plasmids were analysed, {{as well as their}} plasmid type. The strains were typed by multilocus sequence typing. Results Three patients were found to be positive for NDM- 1 -producing enterobacterial isolates (one with Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, one with K. pneumoniae only and one with Proteus mirabilis), where NDM- 1 stands for New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase- 1. The blaNDM- 1 carbapenemase gene was detected in all isolates in addition to genes encoding narrow-spectrum β-lactamases (TEM- 1, SHV- 11, OXA- 1, OXA- 9 and OXA- 10), extended-spectrum β-lactamases (CTX-M- 15, CMY- 16 and CMY- 30), ArmA and quinolone resistance determinants (Qnr).

40|$|Abstract: The {{presence}} of violations {{and the need}} for enforcement of tradable property rights systems in fisheries has not receiving much attention in the literature. The theoretical promise of property rights-based fisheries is to achieve a given total allowable catch with a maximum social benefit. One of the assumption for that result is that the system is in perfect compliance. The incidents of noncompliance, however, may affect the performance of <b>transferable</b> <b>property</b> rights-based fisheries in unexplored ways. In this paper, we construct and analyze a positive model of fisherman behavior that operates under a perfectly competitive individual transferable quota system, when recognizing the opportunities for violations of quota holdings, given incomplete enforcement. Considering an ill enforced <b>transferable</b> <b>property</b> rights-based fishery we are able to obtain a number of implications for the performance of the quota market and the economic efficiency of the regulatory system...|$|E

40|$|Molecular {{simulations}} {{have become}} a mainstream tool of the physical sciences. In spite of their success in allowing us to understand the behaviour of matter at a molecular scale, current and foreseeable computational power limits the system sizes and time scales of ob- servation. Many common engineering scenarios, e. g., self-assembly of aqueous surfactant solutions, require access to large systems and long time scales. A coarse-graining method- ology, in which atoms and molecules are grouped into beads {{can be used to}} capture this behaviour using molecular simulation. However, the development of coarse-grained force fields for use in molecular simulation to study structural, thermodynamic and dynamical properties still remains a challenge. This challenge is the focus of the work presented in this thesis. Coarse-grained force fields obtained in this work were used in molecular simulations for a broad range of systems including: fluid phases of small molecules such as carbon dioxide, linear chains of alkanes, siloxanes and alcohols, to more complex aqueous systems of non- ionic surfactants, electrolytes, and ionic surfactants. The coarse-grained models were developed using a molecular-based equation of state of the Statistical Associating Fluid Theory (SAFT) family, based on the Mie (generalised Lennard-Jones) inter-molecular potential for the interactions between beads. This allows the structural, dynamical, and interfacial properties to be studied directly in molecular simulation. A transferable coarse-grained model for linear alkanes was developed. The carbon chains were used to form the backbone of a variety of organic molecules. Coarse-grained potentials for charged species were also obtained using an electrolyte version of the theory (SAFT-VRE) for use in molecular simulations. The coarse-grained models developed for the linear alkanes and aqueous electrolytes were subsequently used to establish a coarse- grained force field for the aqueous mixture of an important ionic surfactant: sodium dodecyl sulphate. The phase behaviour of the aqueous solutions of sodium dodecyl sulph- ate was studied with the coarse-grained models by molecular dynamic simulations, with emphasis on the structural properties of the different phases. Graphic processing units were also employed to perform large-scale simulations of the coarse-grained SAFT-γ Mie models of aqueous solutions of a non-ionic surfactant: tetraethylene glycol monodecyl ether. Despite the relative simplicity of the coarse-grained force fields developed using the SAFT-γ Mie equation of state, the models were robust and <b>transferable.</b> <b>Properties</b> that have not been considered in the original parameterisation procedure can be predicted, and the results are comparable with the more sophisticated and computationally demanding atomistic and united atom models.

30|$|The {{choice of}} the pseudopotential form factor is {{certainly}} {{an important factor in}} the study of metallic properties, and its actual form is much more sensitive to the choice of dielectric function of the electron gas. Hence, {{the purpose of the present}} paper is not only to calculate surface tension (γ), diffusion coefficient (D), and viscosity coefficient (η) of liquid metals near melting point (Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Mg, Al, Pb and Bi), but also to see the influence of various local-field correction functions in the screening along with the newly constructed model potential [31, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37]. Thus, we incorporated seven different forms of the exchange and correlation functions, viz. Hartree (H) [39], Vashista and Singwi (VS) [40], Hubbard and Sham (HS), [41, 42], Sarkar et al. (SS) [43], Ichimaru and Utsumi(IU) [44], Taylor (T) [45], and Farid et al. (F) [46]. To the best of our knowledge, only few attempts have been made on γ, D, and η from <b>transferable</b> pseudopotential. These <b>properties</b> are important quantities from the scientific as well as technological points of view. However, the accurate measurement of these quantities is exceedingly difficult for high-temperature melts such as liquid metals. Furthermore, theoretical calculations of the surface and atomic transport properties are also difficult to perform convincingly. For surface tension, it is necessary to know the ionic and electronic structures in the inhomogeneous transition zone between liquid metal and gaseous phases, the studies of which are still in their infancy in comparison with those in bulk liquids [22]. As for viscosity coefficient, Born and Green [47] have proposed a simplified expression using their kinetic theory. In spite of oversimplified assumptions involved in the derivation, this Born-Green equation has been shown to predict apparently reasonable values for the viscosity coefficient of liquid metals with the help of pair potentials extracted from experimental structural data. However, it is remarkable that these results are by no means quantitatively reliable since pair potentials deduced from the inversion method have large uncertainties [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28].|$|R
