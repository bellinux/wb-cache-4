5|$|Wittgenstein {{believed}} {{that religion is}} significant because it offers a particular way of life, rather than confirming the existence of God. He therefore believed <b>that</b> <b>religious</b> language is confessional– a confession of what someone feels and believes– rather than consisting of claims to truth. Wittgenstein believed <b>that</b> <b>religious</b> language is different from language used to describe physical objects because it occupies a different language game.|$|E
5|$|By 1912, Sadler and his wife, both doctors by then, {{operated}} a joint practice in Chicago that catered to children's and women's health issues. Sadler initially focused on surgery, performing surgeries with his wife, but widened his practice to include psychiatric counseling in 1930 {{and became a}} consulting psychiatrist at Columbus Hospital. As a psychiatrist, Sadler advocated {{an eclectic mix of}} techniques, applying the theories of Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, Alfred Adler, and Adolf Meyer. Sadler believed <b>that</b> <b>religious</b> faith was beneficial to mental health, and specifically promoted prayer, which he believed to be most effective in the context of Christian faith. However, he thought <b>that</b> <b>religious</b> beliefs were deleterious to mental health if based on fear.|$|E
5|$|Langdon Brown Gilkey {{explained}} religious {{language and}} experience in terms of symbolism, identifying three characteristic features of religious symbolism which distinguish it from other language use. Firstly, religious symbolism has a double focus, referring both to something empirical and to something transcendent; Gilkey argued that the empirical manifestation points towards the transcendent being. Secondly, he believed <b>that</b> <b>religious</b> symbolism concerns fundamental questions of life, involving issues important to an individual or community. Finally, he argued <b>that</b> <b>religious</b> symbols provide standards by which life should be lived.|$|E

40|$|Employing the New Indices of Religious Orientation (NIRO), {{this study}} {{examines}} the theory <b>that</b> different <b>religious</b> orientations are related to individual differences in psychological type as developed by Carl Jung and operationalized by the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). Data provided by 481 weekly churchgoing Christians who completed the MBTI and the NIRO demonstrated <b>that</b> quest <b>religious</b> orientation scores were higher among intuitives than among sensers, but were unrelated to introversion and extraversion, thinking and feeling, or judging and perceiving; <b>that</b> intrinsic <b>religious</b> orientation scores were higher among extraverts than introverts, higher among sensers than intuitives and higher among feelers than thinkers, but unrelated to judging and perceiving; and <b>that</b> extrinsic <b>religious</b> orientation scores were unrelated {{to any of the}} four components of psychological type. The findings relating to Jungian psychological type differences are applied in order to elucidate the psychological significance of extrinsic, intrinsic, and quest orientations to religion...|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} 1410s several Fellows of Oriel {{took part in}} the {{disturbances}} accompanying Archbishop Arundel's attempt to stamp out Lollardy in the University; the Lollard belief <b>that</b> <b>religious</b> power and authority came through piety and not through the hierarchy of the Church particularly inflamed passions in Oxford, where its proponent, John Wycliffe, had been head of Balliol. Disregarding the Provost's authority, Oriel's Fellows fought bloody battles with other scholars, killed one of the Chancellor's servants when they attacked his house, and were prominent among the group that obstructed the Archbishop and ridiculed his censures.|$|E

5|$|Islamic philosopher Carl Ernst {{has argued}} <b>that</b> <b>religious</b> {{language}} is often political, {{especially in the}} public sphere, and that its purpose is to persuade people and establish authority, as well as convey information. He explains that the modern criticisms of the West made by some sections of Islam are an ideological reaction to colonialism, which intentionally uses the same language as colonialists. Ernst argues that when it is used rhetorically, religious language cannot be taken at face value because of its political implications.|$|E
5|$|Like {{all members}} of the House of Habsburg, Maria Theresa was a Roman Catholic, and a devout one. She {{believed}} <b>that</b> <b>religious</b> unity was necessary for a peaceful public life and explicitly rejected the idea of religious toleration. However, she never allowed the Church to interfere with what she considered to be prerogatives of a monarch and kept Rome at arm's length. She controlled the selection of archbishops, bishops and abbots.|$|E
5|$|Supporters of {{evolution}} dismiss such criticisms as counterfactual, and {{some argue that}} the opposite {{seems to be the}} case. A study published by the author and illustrator Gregory S.

The Barna Group surveys find that Christians and non-Christians in the U.S. have similar divorce rates, and the highest divorce rates in the U.S. are among Baptists and Pentecostals, both sects which reject evolution and embrace creationism.|$|E

5|$|Arrington's father {{offered to}} pay for Arrington {{to serve as an}} LDS missionary, but not for a {{university}} education. Arrington did not serve an LDS mission, but considered his educational endeavors a form of church service. Under a scholarship to the University of Idaho, Arrington studied agricultural science in 1935, later changing to agricultural economics. George S. Tanner, the director of the LDS Institute at the University of Idaho, was a progressive intellectual Mormon who taught Arrington that Christianity and science could be compatible and that other translations of the Bible could assist in its interpretation. One of the university's newest economics professors, Erwin Graue, taught the ideas of Alfred Marshall and influenced Arrington to see economics as a study of human relationships and not just mathematical economic forces. Marshall wrote <b>that</b> <b>religious</b> fervor could influence people to act altruistically.|$|E
5|$|Dawkins is an atheist, and is {{well known}} for his {{criticism}} of creationism and intelligent design. In The Blind Watchmaker (1986), he argues against the watchmaker analogy, an argument for the existence of a supernatural creator based upon the complexity of living organisms. Instead, he describes evolutionary processes as analogous to a blind watchmaker in that reproduction, mutation, and selection are unguided by any designer. In The God Delusion (2006), Dawkins contends that a supernatural creator almost certainly does not exist and <b>that</b> <b>religious</b> faith is a delusion. He opposes the teaching of creationism in schools.|$|E
5|$|Emile Durkheim {{was born}} in Épinal in Lorraine, the son of Mélanie (Isidor) and Moïse Durkheim. He came {{from a long line}} of devout French Jews; his father, grandfather, and {{great-grandfather}} had been rabbis. He began his education in a rabbinical school, but at an early age, he decided not to follow in his family's footsteps and switched schools. Durkheim led a completely secular life. Much of his work was dedicated to demonstrating <b>that</b> <b>religious</b> phenomena stemmed from social rather than divine factors. While Durkheim chose not to follow in the family tradition, he did not sever ties with his family or with the Jewish community. Many of his most prominent collaborators and students were Jewish, and some were blood relations. Marcel Mauss, a notable social anthropologist of the pre-war era, was his nephew. One of his nieces was Claudette (née Raphael) Bloch, a marine biologist and mother of Maurice Bloch, who became a noted anthropologist.|$|E

5|$|Empiricist David Hume's {{requirement}} that claims about reality must be verified by evidence influenced the logical positivist movement, particularly the philosopher A. J. Ayer. The movement proposed that, for {{a statement to}} hold meaning, it must be possible to verify its truthfulness empirically– with evidence from the senses. Consequently, the logical positivists argued <b>that</b> <b>religious</b> language must be meaningless because the propositions it makes are impossible to verify. Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein has been regarded as a logical positivist by some academics because he distinguished between things that can and cannot be spoken about; others have argued {{that he could not}} have been a logical positivist because he emphasised the importance of mysticism. British philosopher Antony Flew proposed a similar challenge based on the principle that, in so far as assertions of religious belief cannot be empirically falsified, religious statements are rendered meaningless.|$|E
5|$|In 1936, Ayer wrote Language, Truth and Logic, {{in which}} he claimed <b>that</b> <b>religious</b> {{language}} is meaningless. He put forward a strong empirical position, arguing that all knowledge must either come from observations of the world or be necessarily true, like mathematical statements. In doing so, he rejected metaphysics, which considers {{the reality of a}} world beyond the natural world and science. Because it is based on metaphysics and is therefore unverifiable, Ayer denounced religious language, as well as statements about ethics or aesthetics, as meaningless. Ayer challenged the meaningfulness of all statements about God– theistic, atheistic and agnostic– arguing that they are all equally meaningless because they all discuss the existence of a metaphysical, unverifiable being.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, Boisselier {{converted}} to Raëlism, a UFO religion {{founded by the}} French journalist Claude Vorilhon, usually known as Raël, in 1973. After attending a meeting at which Raël spoke, she felt strongly that he was completely honest and joined his movement. She had left her husband, alleging violent behavior, shortly before her conversion; afterwards, owing to her involvement with Raëlism, he gained sole custody of their youngest child. Boisselier believed <b>that</b> <b>religious</b> intolerance motivated a court to transfer the child's custody. Although her faith led to tension with her parents, her eldest child converted. In the 1990s, Raëlism was seen as dangerous and viewed with disdain in France, resulting in loss of employment for prominent members. The hostility was fueled in part by public concerns about new religious movements after deaths caused by the Order of the Solar Temple in Europe during the mid-1990s.|$|E

5|$|In July 2011 Austrian pastafarian Niko Alm won {{the legal}} right to be shown in his driving license photo wearing a pasta {{strainer}} on his head, after three years spent pursuing permission and obtaining an examination certifying that he was psychologically fit to drive. He got the idea after reading that Austrian regulations allow headgear in official photos only when it is worn for religious reasons. Some sources report that the colander in the form of pasta strainer, was recognised by Austrian authorities as a religious headgear of the parody religion Pastafarianism in 2011. This was denied by Austrian authorities, saying <b>that</b> <b>religious</b> motives were not the reason to grant the permission of wearing the headgear in a passport.|$|E
5|$|Philosopher Paul Tillich argued <b>that</b> <b>religious</b> {{faith is}} best {{expressed}} through symbolism because a symbol {{points to a}} meaning beyond itself and best expresses transcendent religious beliefs. He believed that any statement about God is symbolic and participates in {{the meaning of a}} concept. Tillich used the example of a national flag to illustrate his point: a flag points to something beyond itself, the country it represents, but also participates in the meaning of the country. He believed that symbols could unite a religious believer with a deeper dimension of himself as well as with a greater reality. Tillich believed that symbols must emerge from an individual collective unconsciousness, and can only function when they are accepted by the unconscious. He believed that symbols cannot be invented, but live and die at the appropriate times.|$|E
5|$|Professor Nathan Katz {{writes of}} {{the analogy of}} a burning building, used by the Buddha in the Lotus Sutra, which casts {{religious}} language as imperative. In the analogy, a father sees his children {{at the top of}} a burning building. He persuades them to leave, but only by promising them toys if they leave. Katz argues that the message of the parable is not that the Buddha has been telling lies; rather, he believes that the Buddha was illustrating the imperative use of language. Katz believes <b>that</b> <b>religious</b> language is an imperative and an invitation, rather than a truth-claim.|$|E
