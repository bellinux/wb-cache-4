40|$|The {{extent and}} {{magnitude}} of performance deterioration of the Pratt and Whitney JT 9 D, and the General Electric CF 6 engine models is presented. Overall engine and contributing module performance deterioration with respect to flight cycles and/or time are analyzed. The overall engine performance deterioration analyses are based on data obtained from historical records, special engine tests, and tests for specific effects. Hardware inspection data from overhaul shops and special module tests are {{the basis for the}} modular performance deterioration data used in the analyses. Various damage mechanisms such as seal rubs, erosion, surface roughness and thermal distortion, and how they contribute to performance deterioration are included in the modular analyses. Results indicate that early performance deterioration occurring within the first few flights of these engines is less than 1 percent in cruise specific fuel consumption (SFC), that it is event oriented, and that it is the result of increased blade <b>tip</b> <b>clearances.</b> This performance deterioration gradually increases to about 2. 5 to 3. 0 percent (including the initial short term deterioration) after 2500 to 3000 flights where increased blade <b>tip</b> <b>clearances,</b> airfoil quality degradation, and thermal distortion are the contributing causes...|$|R

The aircraft was configured for takeoff with flaps at 10 degrees (the flaps remaining in that position until impact) with the engines at EPR between 1.69 and 1.72, when it accelerated through Vr (152 knots) and rotation was initiated. While the aircraft rotated the pitch went through 13 degrees nose up and the airspeed had already exceeded V2 (162 KIAS) when engine #4 lost power, the engine rolling down from about 1.7 EPR to 1.0 EPR within 2-3 seconds, the engine surged 4 times during that time. Engineers determined that the high-pressure turbine of engine #4, that had been installed during the last work shop visit in January 2008, was inefficient due to too large a blade <b>tip</b> <b>clearance,</b> the reduced chord and wear of leading edges of fan blades resulting {{in a loss of}} engine power estimated at 5.8%.

5000|$|The {{gull wing}} design {{found its way}} into {{seaplanes}} by the early 1930s. As engine power increased, so did the need for large propellers that could effectively convert power to thrust. The gull wing allowed designers to ensure adequate propeller <b>tip</b> <b>clearance</b> over the water by placing the engines on the highest point of the wing. The alternative was placing the engine on a pylon. Possibly the first flying boat to utilize the gull wing configuration was the Short Knuckleduster, which flew in 1933. The Dornier Do 26, a high-speed airliner and transport platform, of which 6 aircraft were built, flew in 1938. The configuration was also used on the US Navy's PBM Mariner and P5M Marlin maritime patrol aircraft. The emergence of long range, land-based jets in the 1950s and the subsequent demise of the seaplane prevented widespread use of the gull wing, although it was still used in some post-war designs, like Beriev Be-12 Chaika (the name means 'the gull' in Russian).|$|E
5000|$|Three-dimensionality in {{turbomachine}} increases {{complexity in}} flow field so, determination of losses becomes difficult unlike two-dimensional losses where equation complexity is little. Three-dimensionality includes large pressure gradients in every direction, design/curvature of blade, shock wave, heat transfer, cavitation and viscous effects, which generates secondary flow, vortices, tip leakage vortices and other losses. Viscous effects in turbomachinery causes blockage to the flow by formation of viscous layers around blade profile which effect pressure rise/fall and reduce effective area of flow field. Interaction between these losses in rotor increase instability and decreases in efficiency of turbomachinery. In calculation of three-dimensional losses every parameter comes into picture of flow path like axial spacing between vane and blade rows, end wall curvature, radial distribution of pressure gradient, hup/tip ratio, dihedral, lean, <b>tip</b> <b>clearance,</b> flare, aspect ratio, skew, sweep, platform cooling holes, surface roughness, off take bleeds.
