50|$|To {{improve the}} engine’s {{low-speed}} torque range for off-roading and towing applications, Land Rover installed a large capacity single-turbocharger, rather than use the twin-turbo design; in addition {{the engine is}} fitted with a large engine driven cooling fan to support low speed, high load driving as may be encountered in desert conditions. Furthermore, the Land Rover variant of the Lion V6 includes a deeper, high capacity sump with improved baffles to maintain oil pressure at off-roading extreme angles and multi-layered seals to keep dust, mud and water at bay and different <b>transmission</b> <b>bell</b> <b>housing</b> bolt pattern. The Lion V6 - constructed from compacted graphite iron - {{is a member of}} the Ford Duratorq family and is produced at Ford’s Dagenham engine plant; 35,000 engines were produced from April to December 2004.|$|E
50|$|The All-Trac {{system had}} five main parts: the front differential, rear differential, center differential, the transmission, and the {{transfer}} case. The transmission, front differential, center differential and transfer case are all one large assembly and {{are connected to}} the transversely mounted engine. The <b>transmission</b> <b>bell</b> <b>housing,</b> front differential and center differential can be separated from the transfer case sub assembly. The transmission output shaft feeds power into the front/center differential assembly (the center differential is contained within the front differential). The front differential distributes the power to the front wheels, while the center differential distributes power to the transfer case that will send power to the rear differential. In most of the models, when the transfer case is not locked the majority of the power is routed to the front wheels as would be in a Toyota FWD automobile.|$|E
50|$|Other auto {{manufacturers}} {{have used the}} THM400 and its 4L80E successor, including Ferrari (in the 400/412); Jaguar/Daimler (in pre-1994 XJ12 and XJ-S coupes) and their Daimler stable mates; Rolls-Royce (in 1965-1980 Silver Shadow and 1980-1992 Silver Spirit series cars, along with their Bentley stable mates); the Nissan Prince Royal; AM General; and Jeep (usually found in the FSJ pickups and SUVs). Early Jeep THM400s used an adapter between the engine and <b>transmission</b> <b>bell</b> <b>housing</b> while later models had an AMC specific housing - which bolted to its inline six and V8. Though identical except for the bell housing pattern used through the '60s and ending in 1979 the THM400 was mated to the Dana model 18,20 and was the only transmission used with the Borg-Warner 1305/1339 all-wheel-drive transfer case used only in Jeeps (AMC/Jeep phased in the used of the Chrysler Torqueflite 727 after 1979 until the FSJ platform was phased out), It {{has been known to}} adapt a THM400 to other engines using adapters.|$|E
50|$|A {{shaft drive}} is usually {{completely}} enclosed; the visual cue is a tube {{extending from the}} rear of the <b>transmission</b> to a <b>bell</b> <b>housing</b> on the rear wheel. Inside the <b>bell</b> <b>housing</b> a bevel gear on the shaft mates with another on the wheel mount. This arrangement is superior in terms of noise and cleanliness and is virtually maintenance free, with the exception of occasional fluid changes. They are the most durable and usually last the life of the motorcycle. However, the additional gear sets are a source of power loss and added weight. A shaft-equipped motorcycle may also be susceptible to shaft effect.|$|R
50|$|The light station {{includes}} a tower, keeper's house, equipment shed, oil <b>house,</b> and <b>bell</b> <b>house.</b> The keeper's house, now privately owned, is an L-shaped two story gambrel roof oriented {{to face the}} river. The tower is a circular brick structure, topped by an lantern house surrounded by an iron railing. The <b>bell</b> <b>house</b> is distinctive {{as one of the}} few surviving period pyramidal <b>bell</b> <b>houses.</b> The oil house is a small brick gable-roofed structure, typical of oil houses at other light stations.|$|R
50|$|The {{town was}} {{incorporated}} on 25 February 1892 {{and there was}} extensive construction of houses, summer cottages, and hotels. Arguably {{the most famous of}} these structures is the Alexander Graham <b>Bell</b> <b>house</b> which still stands on Irving Avenue as the <b>Bell</b> <b>House</b> Bed and Breakfast.|$|R
50|$|The 2.0L Zetec engine {{has seen}} some issues. Although {{the block and}} {{cylinder}} head are thermally stable, the coolant outlet housing for the thermostat is not. The housing used in the 2000-2004 model year US Ford Focus and 2001-2004 model year Ford Escape with 16-Valve DOHC engine is made from ABS plastic. It is bolted {{to the surface of}} the cylinder head on the right side of the engine with three bolts. The mating surface seals to the cylinder head with a rubber O-ring style gasket. The O-ring is held in place by a lip on the housing which is prone to cracking. The immediate inner portion of the housing will exhibit pitting and bubbling. Over time, pieces of the lip will break off, releasing plastic fragments into the cooling system. These fragments have not been known to cause any severe damage to the cooling system but the damaged lip on the housing will cause the O-ring seal to rupture. This allows coolant to leak out onto the upper <b>transmission</b> <b>bell</b> <b>housing.</b> The failure can result in severe loss of coolant.|$|E
40|$|This book {{chapter is}} closed access. The {{internal}} combustion engine produces a fluctuating torque due to combustion as well as induced inertial imbalance in the reciprocating motion of pistons. When the clutch is engaged, the resulting torsional oscillations of the crankshaft are transmitted to the transmission. In the transmission the fixed driving gears (pinions) transfer the motion to the driven unselected gears (loose gears) through impacting teeth pairs in close proximity due to the compact nature of modern transmission systems. The driven gears in turn rotate freely on their bearings, as they are unselected (referred to as loose gears). As a result, the idle (loose) gears oscillate within their backlash limits, leading to impacts with the driving gears. The vibrations caused by these impacts are transferred through the transmission shafts and their support bearings to the <b>transmission</b> <b>bell</b> <b>housing,</b> and is mostly radiated as sound that resembles the noise produced when a marble rolls inside a metallic can. This sound is onomatopoeically referred to as rattle...|$|E

5000|$|The <b>bell</b> <b>housing</b> {{bolt pattern}} {{for the old}} AMC 196 Straight-6 engine {{is the same as}} for the more modern early 199 and 232 (used from 1964 to 1971), but the 196 had {{different}} dowel pin sizes. AMC's 1956 to 1966 V8s used a different <b>bell</b> <b>housing</b> bolt pattern that was slightly larger in diameter than the six cylinder bell. When AMC discontinued their first V8 engine design after 1966, the <b>bell</b> <b>housing</b> changed; all 1966-up V8 <b>bell</b> <b>housing</b> bolt patterns are the same. The <b>bell</b> <b>housing</b> for six-cylinder engines changed to match the V8 in 1972 when AMC switched from Borg-Warner to Chrysler transmissions automatic. The flywheel also changed from 153 teeth (a common Chevy size) to 164 teeth (a common Ford size). Starter motors used with the 1966-up V8 bellhousing were sourced from Motorcraft which interchanges with the Ford V8 and some of their inline sixes (which uses a separate starter solenoid) - the Jeep 4.0 L uses a Mitsubishi-designed starter which has an integrated solenoid which is lighter in weight but retaining the two mounting bolts with a threaded top hole and unthreaded hole which bolts to the transmission bellhousing.|$|R

50|$|The FS5W71C {{gearboxes}} {{had different}} ratios {{to all other}} S13/S14. A key change was the layshaft gear which changed from 22/31 to 21/32, thus running the layshaft slower and at higher torque. This gearbox is considered weaker than other S13/S14 gearboxes. The front of the SR20DET gearbox with <b>bell</b> <b>housing</b> can be removed and a CA18DET <b>bell</b> <b>housing</b> fitted to allow the gearboxes to be swapped.|$|R
