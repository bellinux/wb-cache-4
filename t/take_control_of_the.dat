5|$|About 40 {{years after}} the Persian conquest of Ionia, and in {{the reign of the}} fourth Persian king, Darius the Great, the {{stand-in}} Milesian tyrant Aristagoras found himself in this familiar predicament. In 500 BC, Aristagoras was approached by some exiles from Naxos, who asked him to <b>take</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> island. Seeing an opportunity to strengthen his position in Miletus by conquering Naxos, Aristagoras approached the satrap of Lydia, Artaphernes, proposing a joint attack on Naxos, to which Artaphernes assented.|$|E

The Belgians kept attacking, but the Liverpool defence of Emlyn Hughes and Tommy Smith were able to repel the Belgians until half-time.|$|E
5|$|Cochrane {{had several}} {{disputes}} with San Martín. He discussed {{several of his}} actions and tried to bypass his authority. During the blockade of El Callao, he proposed that O'Higgins <b>take</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mission and send any spoils of battle to Chile. As San Martín was appointed Protector of Peru, Cochrane reasoned that San Martín was no longer under Chilean command, and took the navy away. In later years Cochrane made accusations against San Martín in Chile.|$|E

5|$|Evolve is {{an action}} video {{game with a}} focus on both co-operative, and competitive, {{multiplayer}} gameplay.

The Hunters' main objective is to track and hunt the Monster in a limited amount of time, while the Monster's goal is to evolve and make themselves more powerful.|$|E
5|$|From mid-1942 through mid-1944, the Filipino guerrilla {{resistance}} {{had been}} supplied and encouraged by U.S. Navy submarines {{and a few}} parachute drops, so that the guerrillas could harass the Japanese Army and <b>take</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rural areas, jungles and mountains – thus, the Japanese Empire only controlled 12 out of 48 provinces. While remaining loyal to the United States, many Filipinos hoped and believed that liberation from the Japanese would bring them freedom and their already-promised independence.|$|E
5|$|In 1807 Agamemnon {{was part}} of Admiral James Gambier's fleet sent to <b>take</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Danish fleet before it could fall into French hands.

Firing commenced on 2 September, and lasted until the Danes surrendered on 7 September. In November, Agamemnon joined the blockading squadron off Lisbon.|$|E

England played poorly against Sri Lanka, with Trescothick finding it hard to build a large innings. He attempted to <b>take</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> match with 70 at Colombo, as England tried to get something from the series, but was also criticised for his poor catching.|$|E

Castelli argued that it was urgent to rise against Lima because its economy depended largely on those districts, and if they lost power over that area, the main royalist stronghold would be threatened. The plan was rejected as too risky, and Castelli complied with the original orders.|$|E
5|$|In November, Herring flew {{across the}} {{mountains}} to <b>take</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fighting around Buna, leaving Blamey to control operations elsewhere in New Guinea.

5|$|Korçë {{belongs to}} the region {{regarded}} as Northern Epirus, a region with substantial Albanian, Aromanian and Greek populations. The Greek national view was to classify all Aromanians and Orthodox Albanians {{as part of the}} Greek minority. The Great Powers signed the Protocol of Florence and awarded the region to the newly founded Principality of Albania on December 17, 1913. Gradual withdrawal of the Greek army would enable the Albanian forces to <b>take</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> region. Consequently, to avert this possibility, pro-Greek Epirotes decided to declare their own separate political identity and self-governance.|$|E

5|$|Llywelyn {{responded by}} {{intervening}} {{with his own}} forces but outright conflict was prevented by the diplomatic efforts of Henry III. De Clare continued building work and in 1270 Llywelyn responded by attacking and burning the site, probably destroying the temporary defences and stores.

He refused to address the Belgian parliament beforehand, as Albert I had famously done at the outbreak of World War I.
