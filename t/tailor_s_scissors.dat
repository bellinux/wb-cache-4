A fact without purpose is useless; coupled with purpose, it becomes information. The information itself might be trivial, as it is in trivia games. Suppose you are playing a game, a trivia game, where stating the right fact wins you points. Suppose the name of William Blackstone 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>tailor</b> was Jonas Maybird, and this is a fact you happen to know.

Change the game to a scholarly one concerned with illuminating Blackstone 2 ̆ 7 s Commentaries on the Laws of England, and we are back to the name of Blackstone 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>tailor</b> being just a worthless fact. For purposes of understanding Blackstone, I presume that to know the name of his tailor is to know a fact that carries no information; it has no purpose in the enterprise. Change the game again, to a study of famous tailors in eighteenth-century England, and then once again the Maybird-Blackstone connection is not just a fact, but a piece of information.

The data {{will be used to}} identify primary aircraft dynamics variables that influence changes in pilot s response and produce a simplified pilot model that incorporates this relationship. Each run incorporated a different set of second-order aircraft dynamics representing short period transfer function pitch attitude response: damping ratio, frequency, gain, zero location, and time delay. The subject s ability to conduct the tracking task was the greatest source of root mean square error tracking variability. As for the aircraft dynamics, the factors that affected the subjects ability to conduct the tracking were the time delay, frequency, and zero location. In addition to creating a simplified pilot model, the results of the experiment can be utilized in an advisory capacity.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedState sponsorship of terrorism, {{though not as}} prevalent as in previous decades, is still a complex phenomenon our government has yet to adequately address, despite the threat it continues to pose to our national security. Current U.

As such, policymakers must careful consider all of the complex ramifications before labeling an offending state for fear of alienating necessary allies and harming the international economy. This paper argues a more effective response to state-sponsored terrorism can be found through {{a deeper understanding of the}} phenomenon. To this end, a new typology for state-sponsored terrorism is presented, offering policymakers a nuanced approach to dealing with offending states.

40|$|Mouse xenotropic and {{polytropic}} leukemia viruses (XMVs and PMVs) {{are closely}} related gammaretroviruses that use the XPR 1 receptor for entry. To identify amino acid residues in XPR 1 important for virus entry, we tested mouse cells derived from evolutionarily divergent species for susceptibility to prototypical PMVs, XMVs, and the wild mouse isolate CasE# 1. CasE# 1 has a variant XMV/PMV host range, and sequence analysis of the CasE# 1 env gene identifies segments related to PMVs and XMVs. Cells from the Asian mouse species Mus pahari show a unique pattern of susceptibility to these three viruses; these cells are susceptible to XMVs and CasE# 1 but are resistant to PMVs, whereas NIH 3 T 3 cells show the reciprocal pattern, susceptibility to only PMVs. The M. pahari XPR 1 gene {{differs from that of}} NIH 3 T 3 in the two extracellular loops (ECLs) previously shown to mediate virus entry (M. Marin, C. <b>S.</b> <b>Tailor,</b> A. Nouri, <b>S.</b> L. Kozak, and D. Kabat, J. Virol. 73 : 9362 - 9368, 1999, and N. S. Van Hoeven and A. D. Miller, Retrovirology 2 : 76, 2005). Using transfected hamster cells expressing chimeric and mutated XPR 1 s, we demonstrated that the susceptibility differences between NIH 3 T 3 and M. pahari cells are receptor mediated, that PMV entry requires residues in ECL 3, that the CasE# 1 entry determinant is in ECL 4, and that determinants for XMV entry are in both ECL 3 and ECL 4. Additional substitutions in ECL 3 and ECL 4 modulate virus susceptibility and suggest that ECL 3 and ECL 4 may contribute to the formation of a single virus receptor site. The position of M. pahari {{at the base of the}} Mus phylogenetic tree indicates that XPR 1 -mediated susceptibility to XMVs is the ancestral type in this genus and that the phenotypic variants of mouse XPR 1 likely arose in conjunction with exposure to gammaretrovirus infections and coevolutionary adaptations in the viral envelope...|$|R

40|$|Although it is {{well known}} that {{self-care}} reduces the frequency of hospital admissions and exacerbations and enhances quality of life (QOL) in heart failure (HF) patients, little is known about self-care in this population. Therefore, the study purpose was to examine relationships among selected individual characteristics (demographics, severity of illness, comorbidities, and social support), self-care strategies, and QOL using Reigel 2 ̆ 7 s Model of Self Care in Patients with Heart Failure as the guiding framework. In this descriptive correlational study, self-care was measured using the Self-Care of Heart Failure Index (SCHFI), which measures self-care maintenance (SC-Mt), self-care management (SC-Mn), and self-care self-confidence (SC-Sc). QOL was measured using a disease-specific instrument, the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (LHFQ), and a generic instrument, the Short-Form Health Survey (SF- 12) characterizing physical and mental-emotional functioning. Multiple regression analysis was used to identify predictors of QOL. Data were collected using Dillman 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>tailored</b> design method for surveys.

40|$|Background: Laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) has {{recently}} been applied successfully {{in the performance of}} a host of surgical procedures. Preliminary consensus from the experts is that this mode of surgery is technically challenging and requires expertise. The transition from trainee to practicing surgeon, especially in complex procedures with challenging learning curves, takes time and mentor-guided nurturing. However, the trainee needs to use platforms of training to gain the skills that are deemed necessary for undertaking the live human case. Objective: This article aims to demonstrate a step-by-step means of how to acquire the necessary instrumentation and build a training model for practicing steeplechase exercises in LESS for urological surgeons and trainees. The tool built {{as a result of this}} could set the platform for performance of basic and advanced skills uptake using conventional, bent and articulated instruments. A preliminary construct validity of the platform was conducted. Materials and Methods: A box model was fitted with an R-Port &# 8482; and camera. Articulated and conventional instruments were used to demonstrate basic exercises (e. g. glove pattern cutting, loop stacking and suturing) and advanced exercises (e. g. pyeloplasty). The validation included medical students (M), final year laparoscopic fellows (F) and experienced consultant laparoscopic surgeons (C) with at least 50 LESS cases experience in total, were tested on eight basic skill tasks (S) including manipulation of the flexible cystoscope (S 1), hand eye coordination (S 2), cutting with flexible <b>scissors</b> (<b>S</b> 3), grasping with flexible needle holders (S 4), two-handed maneuvers (S 5), object translocation (S 6), cross hand suturing with flexible instruments (S 7) and conduction of an ex-vivo pyeloplasty. Results: The successful application of the box model was demonstrated by trainee based exercises. The cost of the kit with circulated materials was less than &# 163; 150 (Pounds Sterling). The noncamera handling skills (S 2 -S 8) of the ex-vivo training model for LESS can distinguish between laparoscopically na&# 959;ve fellows and experienced consultants in LESS. S 4 -S 8 showed the highest level of construct validity, by accurately differentiating among the M, F and C groups. Conclusion: LESS requires a significant amount of skill and has an inherent steep learning curve. The ex-vivo model described provides a cost-effective means that a trainee or training unit can build for optimising preliminary skill acquisition in LESS for urological trainees. It has construct validity in several tasks. Such platform models should be tested further with an emphasis on rapid sequence uptake of optimal skills, prior to undertaking the live human case...|$|R
40|$|The {{world is}} {{experiencing}} a rapid rise in chronic health problems, which places an enormous burden on health care services. Modifiable health behaviors such as physical inactivity are largely responsible for this high prevalence and incidence of chronic diseases. Message tailoring is a well-established approach for constructing health communication and {{has been shown to}} increase the persuasiveness of messages in the promotion of healthy behaviors. Message framing is an effective strategy that has been well-studied in psychology over the past 20 -plus years across a breadth of health-related behaviors but has received little attention in the nursing research literature. Based on prospect theory, temporal construal theory, and motivational orientation theories, the present study examined how two individual differences factors - consideration of future consequences (CFC) and motivational orientation - combine to moderate temporal proximity and valence framing effects on intentions to increase physical activity. A mail survey was conducted using Dillman 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Tailored</b> Design Method. Two hundred and eighteen adults with type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned to receive one of four versions of a health message aimed to increase regular physical activity. Messages were framed using a 2 (immediate- vs. distal-framed) x 2 (gain- vs. loss-framed) design. After reading the message, participants rated their intention to increase physical activity. They also completed a measure of CFC and two measures of motivational orientation. Participants who read a message with a temporal proximity or valence frame congruent with their CFC or motivational orientation, respectively, did not show greater intentions to increase physical activity when compared to those who read a health message that was incongruent with these individual differences. Plausible explanations for these negative results are considered. Several interesting findings emerged from supplemental analyses. For instance, participants who perceived the health message as more believable tended to have greater intentions to increase physical activity. Suggestions for future research applying message congruence to promote complex health behaviors in at-risk populations are given. Implications of message framing and other message tailoring strategies for nursing research, education, and practice are discussed...|$|R

The sample book was convenient for the seller because he could offer more apparel options to his customers without purchasing inventory in advance of sales. Sample books were used both by retailers selling custom-made clothing for wholesale manufacturers and direct sellers. Direct sellers, representing manufacturing companies, carried a sample book straight to the customer by-passing the retail venue. In this paper two types of apparel businesses were examined which dressed men by-the-book in distinctive clothing, hosiery, pajamas and underwear. The sample books examined are The International Tailoring Company 1925, for men 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>tailored</b> clothing and Superwear, Incorporated 1930 - 31, for men 2 ̆ 7 s underwear, pajamas and hosiery. Both books are in the textile collection of the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology.

40|$|In the late- 1920 s, a new {{architectural}} glass appeared which promised health benefits, by {{the enhanced}} {{transmission of the}} beneficial ultraviolet spectrum of sunlight. Vitaglass promised to turn buildings into therapeutic devices {{at a time when}} Euro-American societies were preoccupied with disease. Through its evocative visualizing of the invisible properties of ultraviolet light, Vitaglass captured the imagination if not the market, and opened the door not only for competitors, but for today 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>tailoring</b> of architectural glass to particular performance characteristics. In asking the question, 2 ̆ 2 what were the latent bodies in ultraviolet health glass? 2 ̆ 2 this dissertation relates the story of Vitaglass and its claims and interests, and how these were both communicated, and embodied in the built environment. These bodies are not physically present, but latent within the material, its communication, and the buildings in which it is found. In unpacking these bodies, this dissertation first considers them as enmeshed within a context of the sciences of light and medicine, the technologies of glass and the practices of health. The bodies are revealed through an examination of business records, reports and memos, advertising imagery and print, and client testimonials alongside built and imagined architectural projects in the United States and Britain. Needy bodies were constructed of and conveyed through the rational and persuasive words and images of a propaganda campaign. But, these could also be found within the concerns of and positions taken by a number of interwar agencies, and in the words, buildings and projects of interwar architects, who saw their work as remedial for both social and physical ills, and in that sense not unlike an array of consumer goods, which each offered the dream of a body without needs. Magical bodies were resident both in the imagery and word-magic of its body of advertising, and in the glass substance itself, which became capable of the invisible transduction of sunlight into a disease-free, healthy, and better life. Underpinning both the transductive power of the glass and the psychological control posed by the words and symbols used in its advertising, were the normal bodies propounded by the emerging techniques and fields of graphical measurement, statistics, and scientific management. This interdisciplinary study offers a way of reconsidering the ways in which buildings are shaped by the design of their materials and the concerns and capacities embodied in those designs. It furthermore offers a way of understanding the ways in which those designs, through the built environment, can impact both building performance and human practice. ...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis discusses {{the creation of a}} novel platform that incorporates multiple communication methods, including SMS, email and web-based technologies, for interacting with users of mobile communication devices. The platform utilises people in a mobile environment to solve a range of different application problems, where each problem is a separate and distinct scenario type with unique objectives. There are existing applications available that interact with users of mobile communication devices to provide a service, such as regular weather updates to the users. Other applications have been designed to manage and coordinate the users to perform tasks within a mobile environment, such as performing field studies for scientific purposes. However, the existing applications are designed for only one specific scenario, with the design and implementation solely focused on solving the objectives of that scenario. Each component of these applications needs to be developed from scratch in order to cater for the application s requirements. There is currently no integrated communications platform that offers a framework for supporting a range of different scenario types. The new platform, entitled the Connected-Mobile Platform, aims to support the rapid development and implementation of new scenarios. This platform is composed of a framework of generic components that enable the active running of multiple scenarios concurrently, with the ability to tailor to the requirements of new scenarios as they arise via a structured process. The platform facilitates a means to coordinate its users in order to tackle the objectives of a scenario. The thesis investigates several system architectures to determine an appropriate architectural design for constructing the proposed platform. The platform has a generic framework, based on a client-server architecture, to facilitate the inclusion of a multitude of scenarios. A scenario represents a problem or an event, whereby the platform can utilise and interact with users of mobile communication devices to attempt to solve the objectives of the scenario. Three mobile communication methods are supported; the Short Message Service, electronic mail and web-forms via the mobile internet. Users are able to select and switch between the different methods. The thesis describes the platform <b>s</b> <b>tailored</b> communication structure for scenarios and autonomous analysis of messages. The thesis discusses case studies of two different scenarios to evaluate the platform s facilities for rapid scenario development. The Diet Diary scenario, which is for individual users, aims to manage a user s daily calorie intake to help them reach their desired weight goal. The focus is on the platform s functionality for analysing and responding to messages autonomously. The Missing Persons scenario, which utilises multiple users, involves tracking and locating people who have been reported missing. The focus is on the platform s functionality for coordinating the multiple users, through the creation of assignments, in order to distribute the scenario objectives. The thesis concludes by highlighting the novel features of the platform and identifying opportunities for future work...|$|R
