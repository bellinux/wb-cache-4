It was found that 39 chemical compounds repelled bees (primarily alkaloids, coumarins, and saponins) and three <b>terpene</b> compounds attracted bees.

5|$|Most fungi lack an {{efficient}} {{system for the}} long-distance transport of water and nutrients, such as the xylem and phloem in many plants. To overcome this limitation, some fungi, such as Armillaria, form rhizomorphs, which resemble and perform functions similar {{to the roots of}} plants. As eukaryotes, fungi possess a biosynthetic pathway for producing terpenes that uses mevalonic acid and pyrophosphate as chemical building blocks. Plants and some other organisms have an additional <b>terpene</b> biosynthesis pathway in their chloroplasts, a structure fungi and animals do not have. Fungi produce several secondary metabolites that are similar or identical in structure to those made by plants. Many of the plant and fungal enzymes that make these compounds differ from each other in sequence and other characteristics, which indicates separate origins and convergent evolution of these enzymes in the fungi and plants.|$|E
5|$|Prenol lipids are {{synthesized}} {{from the}} five-carbon-unit precursors isopentenyl diphosphate and dimethylallyl diphosphate that are produced mainly via the mevalonic acid (MVA) pathway. The simple isoprenoids (linear alcohols, diphosphates, etc.) are {{formed by the}} successive addition of C5 units, and are classified according to number of these <b>terpene</b> units. Structures containing greater than 40 carbons are known as polyterpenes. Carotenoids are important simple isoprenoids that function as antioxidants and as precursors of vitamin A. Another biologically important class of molecules is exemplified by the quinones and hydroquinones, which contain an isoprenoid tail attached to a quinonoid core of non-isoprenoid origin. Vitamin E and vitamin K, {{as well as the}} ubiquinones, are examples of this class. Prokaryotes synthesize polyprenols (called bactoprenols) in which the terminal isoprenoid unit attached to oxygen remains unsaturated, whereas in animal polyprenols (dolichols) the terminal isoprenoid is reduced.|$|E
50|$|<b>Terpenes</b> have {{properties}} as {{chemicals in}} food, cosmetics, pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. Chemical synthesis of <b>terpenes</b> can be problematic {{because of their}} complex structure, and plants produce small amounts of <b>terpenes,</b> making it difficult, time-consuming and expensive to extract them directly from plants. The genomes of 17 plant species contain genes that encode terpenoid synthase enzymes imparting <b>terpenes</b> with their basic structure, and cytochrome P450s that modify this basic structure.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Terpenes</b> (...) are a {{large and}} diverse class of organic compounds, {{produced}} {{by a variety of}} plants, particularly conifers, and by some insects such as termites or swallowtail butterflies, which emit <b>terpenes</b> from their osmeteria.

The difference between <b>terpenes</b> and terpenoids is that <b>terpenes</b> are hydrocarbons, whereas terpenoids contain additional functional groups.|$|R

40|$|The {{greatest}} hindrance for transdermal {{drug delivery}} (TDD) is the barrier property of skin, especially the stratum corneum (SC). Various methodologies {{have been investigated}} and developed to enhance the penetration of drugs through the skin. Among them, the most popular approach is the application of penetration enhancers (PEs), including natural <b>terpenes,</b> a very safe and effective class of PEs. In the present paper, we focused on <b>terpenes</b> as skin PEs for TDD. The mechanism of their action, the factors affecting their penetration enhancement effect, {{as well as their}} possible skin toxicity were discussed. <b>Terpenes</b> abundant in nature have great potential in the development of PEs. Compared to synthetic PEs, natural <b>terpenes</b> have been proved to possess higher enhancement activity. Interaction with SC intercellular lipids is the main mechanism of action for <b>terpenes.</b> The key factor affecting the enhancement effect is the lipophilicity of both <b>terpenes</b> and drug molecules. In addition, a lot of <b>terpenes</b> have also been proved to be much less toxic compared to azone, the classic synthetic PE. In summary, <b>terpenes</b> may be preferred over the chemically synthesized compounds as safe and effective PEs to promote the percutaneous absorption of drugs...|$|R

50|$|The resin {{produced}} by most plants is composed mainly of <b>terpenes</b> and derivatives.

25|$|Since {{bacteria}} {{possess the}} ability to make secondary metabolites such as the antibiotic penicillin, their production began quite early during evolution. But they assume more significant roles in eukaryotic and multicellular organisms. In plants they seem to have diversified using mechanisms such as gene duplications, evolution of novel genes and the development of novel biosynthetic pathways. Studies have shown that diversity in some of these compounds may be positively selected for. Cyanogenic glycosides may have been proposed to have evolved multiple times in different plant lineages, and there are several other instances of convergent evolution. For example, the enzymes for synthesis of limonene – a <b>terpene</b> – are more similar between angiosperms and gymnosperms than to their own <b>terpene</b> synthesis enzymes. This suggests independent evolution of the limonene biosynthetic pathway in these two lineages.|$|E

40|$|Building {{structures}} {{made from}} fir wood are often attacked by wood-destroying insects {{for which the}} <b>terpenes</b> it contains serve as attractants. One of the possibilities for extending the lifetime of structures is to use older wood with a lower content of <b>terpenes</b> and/or thermally modified wood. The study evaluated the levels of <b>terpenes</b> in naturally aged fir wood (108, 146, 279, 287 and 390 years) and their decrease by thermal treatment (the temperature of 60 °C and 120 °C, treatment duration of 10 h). <b>Terpenes</b> were extracted from wood samples by hexane and analyzed by gas-chromatography mass-spectrometry (GC-MS). The results indicate that recent fir wood contained approximately 60 times more <b>terpenes</b> than the oldest wood (186 : 3. 1 mg/kg). The thermal wood treatment speeded up the release of <b>terpenes.</b> The temperature of 60 °C caused a loss in <b>terpenes</b> in the recent fir wood by 62 %, the temperature of 120 °C even by > 99 %. After the treatment at the temperature of 60 °C the recent fir wood had approximately the same quantity of <b>terpenes</b> as non-thermally treated 108 year old wood, i. e. , approximately 60 – 70 mg/kg. After the thermal treatment at the temperature of 120 °C the quantity of <b>terpenes</b> dropped in the recent {{as well as the}} old fir wood to minimum quantities (0. 7 – 1. 1 mg/kg). The thermal treatment can thus be used as a suitable method for the protection of fir wood from wood-destroying insects...|$|R

40|$|Interactions among {{nutrients}} and plant secondary metabolites (PSM) may influence how herbivores mix their diets and use food resources. We determined intake {{of a food}} containing a mix of terpenoids identified in sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) when present in isoenergetic diets of increasing concentrations of protein (6, 9, 15, or 21 % CP) or in isonitrogenous diets of increasing concentrations of energy (2. 17, 2. 55, 3. 30, or 3. 53 Mcal/kg). Lambs were offered choices between those diets with or without <b>terpenes</b> or between diets with <b>terpenes</b> and alfalfa hay. Intake of the diets with <b>terpenes</b> was lowest with the lowest concentrations of protein (6 %) and energy (2. 17 Mcal/kg) in the diets, and highest with diets of 15 % CP and 3. 53 ~Mcal/kg. In contrast, when <b>terpenes</b> were absent from the diets, lambs consumed similar amounts of all four diets with different concentrations of protein, {{and more of the}} diets with intermediate amounts of energy. When given a choice between the diet with or without <b>terpenes,</b> lambs preferred the diet without <b>terpenes.</b> When lambs were offered choices between terpene-containing diets and alfalfa, energy and protein concentrations influenced the amount of <b>terpenes</b> animals ingested. Energy densities higher than alfalfa, and protein concentrations higher than 6 %, increased intake of the terpene-containing diet. Thus, the nutritional environment interacted with <b>terpenes</b> to influence preference such that lambs offered diets of higher energy or protein concentration ate more <b>terpenes</b> when forced, but not when offered alternative food without <b>terpenes.</b> The nutrients supplied by a plant and its neighbors likely influence how much PSM an animal can ingest, which in turn may affect the dynamics of plant communities, and the distribution of herbivores in a landscape.

40|$|Interactions among {{nutrients}} and secondary compounds in plants {{can influence the}} kinds and amounts of different forages herbivores ingest, but {{little is known about}} how the sequence of plant ingestion may influence these interactions. The physiological pathways and rates of nutrient and secondary compound metabolism in the body influence food intake by herbivores. On this basis, we predicted the sequence in which foods that vary in {{nutrients and}} secondary compounds are ingested would influence food intake and preference. In a 2 × 2 factorial experiment, we evaluated the relationship between the sequence of presenting two foods, one with <b>terpenes</b> and the other with tannins, and the time when lambs ate a nutritious food (alfalfa–barley), either before or after eating foods with tannins and <b>terpenes.</b> When alfalfa–barley was fed prior to the <b>terpenes,</b> intake of the terpene-containing food was lower than when alfalfa–barley was fed after <b>terpenes</b> (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). The sequence when alfalfa–barley was fed did not influence intake of the tannin-containing food (P 3 ̆e 0. 10). Lambs ate more total foods with <b>terpenes</b> + tannins when fed tannins → <b>terpenes</b> → alfalfa/barley than when fed alfalfa/barley → tannins → <b>terpenes</b> (P 3 ̆c 0. 10). During preference tests, when lambs were offered all three foods simultaneously, lambs previously conditioned with the sequence tannins → <b>terpenes</b> → alfalfa–barley preferred alfalfa–barley 3 ̆e <b>terpenes</b> 3 ̆e tannins (P 3 ̆c 0. 05), whereas lambs in other treatments preferred alfalfa–barley 3 ̆e tannins 3 ̆e <b>terpenes</b> (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). During preference tests when lambs were fed only foods with secondary compounds, lambs previously conditioned with the sequence tannins → <b>terpenes</b> → alfalfa–barley showed equal preference for foods with tannins and <b>terpenes,</b> whereas lambs in other treatments preferred food with tannins 3 ̆e <b>terpenes</b> (P 3 ̆c 0. 05 – 0. 10). All of these results are consistent with the hypothesis that the sequence in which foods are consumed affects both food intake and preference. Understanding the importance of sequencing when herbivores consume foods that vary in nutrients and secondary compounds may help managers create new grazing strategies that include sequential foraging patterns to optimize food intake and more evenly use all plant species in a community, a practice used by herders in France...|$|R

40|$|We {{hypothesized}} that toxins and nutrients in foods interact to influence foraging behavior by herbivores. Based on this hypothesis we predicted that 1) <b>terpenes</b> in big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) influence intake and preference in sheep for diets varying in sources of nonstructural (barley grain) and structural (sugar beet pulp) carbohydrates, and 2) these effects {{are due to}} the differential effects of <b>terpenes</b> on fermentation products and apparent digestibility of each class of carbohydrates. Lambs were fed 2 isoenergetic and isonitrogenous diets with varying proportions of the same ingredients (beet pulp- and barley grain-based diet) or offered a choice between the 2 diets; all feeds were fed without and with <b>terpenes,</b> in consecutive periods. We also compared intake and preference of the beet pulp-and barley-based diets {{before and after the}} lambs ate a meal of sagebrush. Finally, we assessed the effect of <b>terpenes</b> on ruminal variables and in vivo digestibility. Lambs ate less when fed beet pulp or when they were offered a choice of diets with <b>terpenes</b> (P 3 ̆c 0. 001), and intake of the beet pulp-based diet was the most affected (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). Lambs preferred the beet pulp-to the grain-based diet with <b>terpenes,</b> but their preference reversed when <b>terpenes</b> were removed from the diets (P 3 ̆c 0. 05).

Additionally, the presence of phospholipids and <b>terpenes</b> did not influence the way anthocyanins degraded over a 40 day period of time at three different temperatures. Transport of anthocyanins was not dependent on dosage since absorption results were similar at both concentrations of anthocyanins tested. Two methods to mix anthocyanins, phospholipids, and <b>terpenes</b> were also assessed (Sonication and French Press).
