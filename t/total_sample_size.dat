40|$|Introduction: The human teeth {{have many}} {{anatomical}} variations {{and treatment of}} each tooth is {{under the influence of}} its configuration. Therefore, recognizing canal configuration is necessary for a correct endo-dontic therapy, and lack of information about canal configuration causes failure in therapy. Since {{one of the most effective}} factors on canal configuration is race, we planed to have an In vitro research in the city of the Isfahan. Methods and Materials: This study was descriptive, and was done on 160 extracted maxillary first premolars and mandibular second premolars, which were collected from a number of clinics and private offices in Isfahan. Teeth were decalicfied, injectetd with dye, and made transparent to determine the number of root canals and their type. Finally, the teeth were cut in cross sections in three points of the root and canal configurations of teeth were evaluated. The specimens were classified according to Weine system by naked eye. Results: In clearing Method, from 80 <b>total</b> <b>sample</b> <b>sizes,</b> most of them were type III (67. 5 percent). Mandibular second premolars, from 80 <b>total</b> <b>sample</b> <b>sizes,</b> most of them were type I (91. 25 percent). In sectional methods, from 80 <b>total</b> <b>sample</b> <b>sizes,</b> most of them were type III (70 percent) and frome mandibular second premolars, from 80 <b>total</b> <b>sample</b> <b>sizes,</b> most of them were type I (88 / 75 percent). Conclusion: In other countries many researches have been done using different methods about internal anatomy of teeth and the results are different form this study. It appears that the differences are due to genetic or race factors and methods used. Additionally, results of different studies indicate that more attention should be given to studies on canal configuration of these teeth.

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of disease in many populations is often low. For example, the {{prevalence of}} tuberculosis, brucellosis, and bovine spongiform encephalopathy range from 1 per 100, 000 to less than 1 per 1, 000, 000 in many countries. When an outbreak occurs, epidemiological investigations often require comparing the prevalence in an exposed population with that of an unexposed population. To determine if the level of disease in the two populations is significantly different, the epidemiologist must consider the test to be used, desired power of the test, and determine the appropriate <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> for both the exposed and unexposed populations. Commonly available software packages provide estimates of the required <b>sample</b> <b>sizes</b> for this application. This study shows that these estimated <b>sample</b> <b>sizes</b> can exceed the necessary number of samples by more than 35 % when the prevalence is low.

40|$|Abstract Theassessment ofsexual arousal in menandwomen informs {{theoretical}} {{studies of}} human sexuality and provides a method to assess and evaluate the treatment of sexual dysfunctions and paraphilias. Understanding measures of arousal is, therefore, paramount to further theoretical and practical advances in the study {{of human sexuality}}. In this meta-analysis, we review research to quantify the extent of agreement between selfreported and genital measures of sexual arousal, to determine if there is a gender difference in this agreement, and to identify theoretical and methodological moderators of subjective-genital agreement. We identified 132 peer- or academically-reviewed laboratory studies published between 1969 and 2007 reporting a correlation between self-reported and genital measures of sexual arousal, with <b>total</b> <b>sample</b> <b>sizes</b> of 2, 505 women and 1, 918 men.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that, for {{estimating}} a linear treatment effect with constant variance, the optimal design divides the units equally between the two extremes of the design space. If the dose-response relation may be nonlinear, however, intermediate measurements {{may be useful in}} order to estimate the effects of partial treatments.

Under reasonable assumptions about nonlinearity, we find that, unless <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> is very large, the design with no interior measurements is best, because with moderate <b>total</b> <b>sample</b> <b>sizes,</b> any nonlinearity in the doseresponse will be difficult to detect.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the independent effect of skewness and kurtosis on the robustness of the linear mixed model (LMM), with the Kenward-Roger (KR) procedure, when group distributions are different, <b>sample</b> <b>sizes</b> are small, and sphericity cannot be assumed. Methods: A Monte Carlo simulation study considering a split-plot design involving three groups and four repeated measures was performed. Results: The results showed that when group distributions are different, the effect of skewness on KR robustness is {{greater than that of}} kurtosis for the corresponding values. Furthermore, the pairings of skewness and kurtosis with group size were found to be relevant variables when applying this procedure. Conclusions: With <b>sample</b> <b>sizes</b> of 45 and 60, KR is a suitable option for analyzing data when the distributions are: (a) mesokurtic and not highly or extremely skewed, and (b) symmetric with different degrees of kurtosis. With <b>total</b> <b>sample</b> <b>sizes</b> of 30, it is adequate when group sizes are equal and the distributions are: (a) mesokurtic and slightly or moderately skewed, and sphericity is assumed; and (b) symmetric with a moderate or high/extreme violation of kurtosis.

40|$|Abstract. To {{assess the}} risk of (zoonotic) disease {{transmission}} in developing countries, decision makers generally rely on dis-tribution estimates of animals from survey records or projections of historical enumeration results. Given {{the high cost of}} large-scale surveys, the <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> is often restricted and the accuracy of estimates is therefore low, especially when spatial high-resolution is applied. This study explores possibilities of improving the accuracy of livestock distribution maps with-out additional samples using spatial modelling based on regression tree forest models, developed using subsets of the Uganda 2008 Livestock Census data, and several covariates. The accuracy of these spatial models as well as the accuracy of an ensemble of a spatial model and direct estimate was compared to direct estimates and “true ” livestock figures based on the entire dataset. The new approach is shown to effectively increase the livestock estimate accuracy (median relative error decrease of 0. 166 - 0. 037 for <b>total</b> <b>sample</b> <b>sizes</b> of 80 - 1, 600 animals, respectively). This outcome suggests that the accuracy levels obtained with direct estimates can indeed be achieved with lower <b>sample</b> <b>sizes</b> and the multimodel approach present-ed here, indicating a more efficient use of financial resources...|$|R

40|$|Many {{potential}} new medicines fail in phase III clinical trials, because of either insufficient efficacy or intolerability. Such failures {{may be caused}} by the absence of an effect and also if a suboptimal dose is being tested. It is thus important to consider how to optimise the choice of dose or doses that continue into the confirmatory phase. For many indications, it is common to test one single active dose in phase III. However, phase IIB dose-finding trials are relatively small and often lack the ability of precisely estimating the dose–response curves for efficacy and tolerability. Because of this uncertainty in dose response, it is reasonable to consider bringing more than one dose into phase III. Using simple but illustrative models, we find the optimal doses and compare the probability of success, for fixed <b>total</b> <b>sample</b> <b>sizes,</b> when one or two active doses are included in phase III...|$|R

30|$|The absent fixed {{effects for}} the {{personal}} characteristics {{could also be}} attributable to methodological/statistical issues {{because of the small}} <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> at the second level and its possible effects on the accuracy of the estimation. A number of references emphasize that the restricted-maximum-likelihood method for estimation of regression weights works well in small sample settings, {{and there are a number}} of exemplary multilevel applications that refer to small <b>sample</b> <b>sizes</b> at Level 2 (N =  15 – 20) (e.g., Kenward and Roger 1997; McNeish and Stapleton 2016; Skene and Kenward 2010; Stegmueller 2013). However, the current study contains a relatively small <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> (N =  18; participants at Level 2) in relation to a large sample of repeated measurements nested within persons (the medians of frequencies of 10 -s measurement intervals range from 101 to 184 measures per person; Level 1).

Also, Scherbaum and Ferreter (2009, p. 352) note, “as a general rule of thumb, increasing the <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> at the highest level (i.e., sampling more groups) will do more to increase power than increasing the number of individuals in the groups.” Maas and Hox (2005) found that a small <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> at Level 2 (≤ 50) leads to biased estimates of the second-level standard errors and parameters.|$|R
