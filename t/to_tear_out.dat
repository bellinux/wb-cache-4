25|$|The Master {{agrees to}} help the Doctor {{stop the spread of}} Entropy by {{adapting}} the Pharos Project radio telescope on Earth so that they are able to reopen the CVEs. However, when the Master tries to take control of it, the Doctor runs out under the upturned radio dish to sever the cable linking the Master to the CVEs. The Master makes the dish start rotating so that the Doctor will fall to his death. Before he falls, he manages <b>to</b> <b>tear</b> <b>out</b> the cable, only to leave his companions watching as he clings to the cable. As his grip begins to slip, he sees visions of all the enemies he's faced over the years, then falls. Adric, Nyssa, and Tegan gather around the mortally wounded Doctor and call out his name. The Doctor begins seeing visions of all his companions and even the Brigadier calling his name.|$|E
500|$|Seven {{months into}} her captivity, Garrido {{introduced}} Dugard to his wife, Nancy, {{who brought the}} child a stuffed animal and chocolate milk, and engaged in the same tearful apologies to her. Though Dugard craved the woman's approval at the time, in retrospect she has stated that she was manipulated by Nancy, who alternated between motherly concern and coldness and cruelty, expressing her jealousy of Dugard, whom she regarded as the one to blame for her predicament. Dugard characterized Nancy, {{who worked as a}} nursing home aide, as [...] "evil" [...] and [...] "twisted." [...] When Garrido was returned to prison for failing a drug test, Nancy replaced her husband as Dugard's jailer. The Garridos manipulated Dugard further by presenting her, on two occasions, with kittens that would later [...] "mysteriously vanish." [...] When they discovered that she was signing her real name in a journal that she kept on the kittens, she was forced <b>to</b> <b>tear</b> <b>out</b> the page with her name on it, the last time she would be permitted to say or write her name until years later. She was never allowed to see a doctor or dentist.|$|E
2500|$|On February 25, some {{construction}} details {{relating to}} the planking of the bow and stern still remained to be worked out, but the hull lines of the vessel were ready to be laid out. [...] The yacht was to be built at Supple's shipyard on the Willamette River {{at the foot of}} east Belmont Street, in Portland, Oregon. [...] It was necessary <b>to</b> <b>tear</b> <b>out</b> the wall of one of the sheds at the Supple yard {{to make room for the}} yacht's construction. [...] Supple planned to launch the boat, once engines had been installed, stern first, with the launching to occur if possible before May 15, before the water in the Willamette river could rise as it usually did in a freshet in June.|$|E
6000|$|... "And as <b>to</b> <b>tearing</b> <b>out</b> our hearts," [...] cried Alric, feeling emboldened {{now that}} the stout door stood {{between him and his}} foes, [...] "if ye do not make off as fast as ye came, we will punch out your eyes and roast your livers." ...|$|R
6000|$|As there, {{with his}} bushy red beard, he stood, [...] Pricked out to double its size, [...] He squinted so cross, 'twas {{as much as}} she could [...] <b>To</b> keep the <b>tears</b> <b>out</b> of her eyes, her eyes, [...] <b>To</b> keep the <b>tears</b> <b>out</b> of her eyes.|$|R
50|$|The {{chief of}} police. Prone <b>to</b> <b>tearing</b> <b>out</b> what little hair he has left... and what's left turned white {{due to the}} stress of the job. He has a chronic ulcer that acts up {{whenever}} the Tank Police cause too much collateral damage. In arguments with the previous mayor, he comments in the introduction that tanks are insufficient for keeping the peace, and would prefer 'replacing our guns with tactical nuclear weapons,' though it's unclear if he means this to be taken seriously.|$|R
2500|$|Both {{boys and}} girls were brought up by the city women {{until the age of}} seven, when boys (paidia) were taken from their mothers and grouped {{together}} in [...] "packs" [...] (agelai) and were sent to what is almost equivalent to present-day military boot camp. This military camp was known as the Agoge. They became inured to hardship, being provided with scant food and clothing; this also encouraged them to steal, and if they were caught, they were punished – not for stealing, but for being caught. There is a characteristic story, told by Plutarch: [...] "The boys make such a serious matter of their stealing, that one of them, as the story goes, who was carrying concealed under his cloak a young fox which he had stolen, suffered the animal <b>to</b> <b>tear</b> <b>out</b> his bowels with its teeth and claws, and died rather than have his theft detected." [...] The boys were encouraged to compete against one another in games and mock fights and to foster an esprit de corps. In addition, they were taught to read and write and learned the songs of Tyrtaios, that celebrated Spartan exploits in the Second Messenian War. They learned to read and write not for cultural reasons, but so they could be able to read military maps. At the age of twelve, a boy was classed as a [...] "youth" [...] (meirakion). His physical education was intensified, discipline became much harsher, and the boys were loaded with extra tasks. The youths had to go barefoot, and were dressed only in a tunic both in summer and in winter.|$|E
6000|$|THE EDITOR. How {{much will}} you {{remember}} {{of all that}} when you smell the beast's breath and see his jaws opening <b>to</b> <b>tear</b> <b>out</b> your throat? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No! No!" [...] he replied, violently. [...] "Of course I don't. I won't. But God! {{how sweet}} {{it would be}} <b>to</b> <b>tear</b> <b>out</b> his lying tongue--to--" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No," [...] said Charmian. [...] "The {{only thing}} is <b>to</b> <b>tear</b> him <b>out</b> of your heart; and I will help you!" [...] She made {{as if she were}} ready to begin then, and Cornelia broke into a genuine laugh.|$|R
50|$|Amphisbaenians are carnivorous, able <b>to</b> <b>tear</b> chunks <b>out</b> {{of larger}} prey with their powerful, {{interlocking}} teeth. Like lizards, some species {{are able to}} shed their tails (autotomy). Most species lay eggs, although at least some {{are known to be}} viviparous.|$|R
6000|$|Deer-Runner was {{spurred by}} the recital of famine <b>to</b> <b>tear</b> <b>out</b> a chunk of bear-meat and broil it on a stick over the coals. This he devoured with smacking lips, while Long-Beard went on: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'The Earl and the Queen {{will have}} to do the work,' said the Prioress, 'and they will no more hold {{together}} than a couple of wild hawks will hunt in company. How long do you give them <b>to</b> <b>tear</b> <b>out</b> one another's eyes?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "P.S.--I {{hope you}} {{do not intend to}} keep all my best gowns, jewels, and wearing-apparel; and make no doubt you {{dismissed}} me from your house in order to make way for some vile hussy, whose eyes I would like <b>to</b> <b>tear</b> <b>out.</b> T. V. G." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That fellow, Ezra Girdlestone, {{knows where}} they are," [...] Tom would cry, striding wildly {{up and down}} the room with unkempt hair and clenched hands. [...] "I will have his secret, if I have <b>to</b> <b>tear</b> it <b>out</b> of him." ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{he would}} seize {{her in his}} arms, and hold her to him, with a strange longing <b>to</b> <b>tear</b> from <b>out</b> his heart all other thoughts, {{feelings}} and passions save those which made him a slave to her beauty and her smiles.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I screamed {{rather than}} talked, for I felt tumultuous passions eddying through my veins, {{and the old}} spirits {{whispering}} and taunting me <b>to</b> <b>tear</b> his heart <b>out.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Sir," [...] said George Robinson {{as soon as}} he saw him, [...] "I did {{not expect}} this honour from you." [...] And then he bethought himself of his desire <b>to</b> <b>tear</b> <b>out</b> the monster's tongue, and began to {{consider}} whether he might do it now.|$|E
60|$|The captain whistled again, and far and far astern the {{invisible}} twin steam-sirens answered us. Their blasting shriek grew louder, till at last it seemed <b>to</b> <b>tear</b> <b>out</b> {{of the fog}} just above our quarter, and I cowered while the Rathmines plunged bows under on a double swell that crossed.|$|E
60|$|The {{night was}} one Captain Moore never forgot. He was hungry, {{but there was}} nothing at hand with which to satisfy the cravings of the inner man. Peck's mind began to ramble again, and once he {{struggled}} violently, thinking he was fighting with an Indian, who was trying <b>to</b> <b>tear</b> <b>out</b> his side.|$|E
60|$|The unhappy man {{stamped with}} rage. The red {{glare of the}} lanthorn showed him his two {{powerful}} warders, standing right and left. He {{felt that there was}} no escape from them, but in darkness; and suddenly he dashed at the lanthorn, and tried <b>to</b> <b>tear</b> it <b>out</b> of Wynd's hands.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{you were}} men. You did not forget your secret honour, though the whole cosmos turned an engine of torture <b>to</b> <b>tear</b> it <b>out</b> of you. I knew how near {{you were to}} hell. I know how you, Thursday, crossed swords with King Satan, and how you, Wednesday, named me in the hour without hope." ...|$|R
60|$|Francis {{was himself}} again. There was an immense relief, a joy in his heart. He had never {{for a single}} moment blamed Margaret, {{but he had never}} for a single moment forgotten. It was a closed chapter but the stain was on its pages. It was {{wonderful}} <b>to</b> <b>tear</b> it <b>out</b> and scatter the fragments.|$|R
60|$|But Lady Castlewood {{could not}} operate upon the said eyes then and there, like the barbarous monsters in the stage-direction in King Lear. When her ladyship was going <b>to</b> <b>tear</b> <b>out</b> her daughter's eyes, she would retire smiling, with an arm round her dear child's waist, and then gouge her in private.|$|E
60|$|Meanwhile the man stood, {{his hands}} to his head. Presently he began to tremble, and then fell, {{clutching}} at his bosom, as though <b>to</b> <b>tear</b> <b>out</b> the fire in his heart. He staggered, with livid, twisted face and foaming lips, to where Cleopatra lay watching him with a slow and cruel smile.|$|E
6000|$|... "Shall I {{tear out}} the leaf on which all these {{shocking}} {{things have been}} written? No. My Diary is so nicely bound--it would be positive barbarity <b>to</b> <b>tear</b> <b>out</b> a leaf. Let me occupy myself harmlessly with something else. What shall it be? My dressing-case--I will put my dressing-case tidy, and polish up the few little things in it which my misfortunes have still left in my possession.|$|E
6000|$|... "Bright is Whitefire and {{thou art}} named Brighteyes. See now: I set the great sword against thy right eye, and, if I win the match, {{it shall be}} mine <b>to</b> <b>tear</b> it <b>out.</b> Wilt thou play this game with me? If thy heart fails thee, let it go; but I will set no other stake against my good sword." ...|$|R
60|$|She proffered {{that advice}} {{in a most}} matter-of-fact tone {{as if it were}} a {{precaution}} against a cold, compressed her lips, then returning to her fixed idea, “But the house is mine,” she insisted very quietly with an accent which made me feel that Satan himself would never manage <b>to</b> <b>tear</b> it <b>out</b> of her hands.|$|R
60|$|Kenneth {{had turned}} {{around on his}} stool and was {{regarding}} old Will Rogers earnestly, brush and pallet alike forgotten. Beth was trying <b>to</b> keep the <b>tears</b> <b>out</b> of her own eyes, for the old man's voice was even more pathetic than his words.|$|R
60|$|It {{seemed a}} symbol of human faith and valour that while the skies were darkening that high place of the earth was bright. The devils might have {{captured}} heaven, but they had not yet captured the cross. He had a new impulse <b>to</b> <b>tear</b> <b>out</b> the secret of this dancing, jumping and pursuing paralytic; and {{at the entrance of}} the court as it opened upon the Circus he turned, stick in hand, to face his pursuer.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] said Staniford. He had {{a book in}} his hand, and {{he began}} to scribble a little sketch of Lydia's pose, on a fly-leaf. She looked round and saw it. [...] "You've {{detected}} me," [...] he said; [...] "I haven't any right to keep your likeness, now. I must make you a present of this work of art, Miss Blood." [...] He finished the sketch with some ironical flourishes, and made as if <b>to</b> <b>tear</b> <b>out</b> the leaf.|$|E
60|$|Before I could answer, I had {{proof of}} this last statement, for the great yellow hound, Pharaoh, that had found us in the desert, hearing our voices, emerged from some corner where it was hidden, and {{advanced}} toward us, wagging its tail. As it passed Shadrach, it stopped and growled, the hair rising on its back, whereon he hurled a stone at it and hit its leg. Next instant Pharaoh, a beast of enormous power, was {{on the top of}} him, and really, I thought, about <b>to</b> <b>tear</b> <b>out</b> his throat.|$|E
25|$|On 1 April, {{a debate}} was held {{about the film}} in the Dutch parliament.

"It {{would be}} {{reasonably}} {{accurate to say}} that up until that stage Jet was more the name of the team that was assigned to work on the DB engine modules of Access rather than a component team.
