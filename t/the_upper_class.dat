5|$|In {{another example}} of {{evolution}} of culture, Durkheim pointed to fashion, although in this case he noted a more cyclical phenomenon. According to Durkheim, fashion serves to differentiate between lower classes and upper classes, but because lower classes {{want to look like}} the upper classes, they will eventually adapt <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>class</b> fashion, depreciating it, and forcing <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>class</b> to adopt a new fashion.|$|E
5|$|A {{full-time}} etiquette {{coach was}} hired to instruct the cast in the manners of <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>class</b> gentility in 1912. Despite this, several critics picked up on anachronisms in the film, not least involving the two main stars.|$|E
5|$|Brideshead Revisited (1981), {{based on}} Waugh's novel; a miniseries {{enormously}} popular in Britain and America, {{the film has}} sometimes been seen as drawing unwanted attention to Oxford's stereotypical reputation as a playground for <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>class.</b> It stars Jeremy Irons and most college shots are of Christ Church and Hertford.|$|E

50|$|Unlike landholding, {{industry}} {{was not considered}} an honorable profession for those of senatorial rank. Cicero suggested {{that in order to}} gain respectability a merchant should buy land. Attitudes changed during the Empire, however, and Claudius created legislation to encourage <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>classes</b> to engage in shipping. Women of <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>classes</b> are documented as owning and running shipping corporations.|$|R
5|$|Public {{interest}} in the scandal eventually faded. Nevertheless, newspaper coverage reinforced negative attitudes about male homosexuality as an aristocratic vice, presenting the telegraph boys as corrupted and exploited by members of <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>class.</b> This attitude reached its climax {{a few years later}} when Oscar Wilde was tried for gross indecency as the result of his affair with Lord Alfred Douglas.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} Lord Frederick Verisopht in Charles Dickens' Nicholas Nickelby {{lived in}} an apartment in Regent Street. This reflected {{the nature of the}} street in the mid-19th century when it was still a fashionable residence for <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>class.</b>|$|E
5|$|Among its {{weaknesses}} {{were the}} positioning of its gatehouse, {{on the wrong}} side of the castle, facing away from the road, and the huge windows in the hall, reaching down to the ground and making access relatively easy to any intruder. Indeed, this vulnerability may have been intentional - its builder Laurence was a newly moneyed member of <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>class,</b> and he may not have wanted to erect a fortification that would have threatened the established Marcher Lords in the region.|$|E
50|$|Having {{what was}} {{described}} as a brilliant education herself,a reputation for great learning, and a wide net of contacts in high society, she founded a pension or a Finishing school for girls from <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>classes</b> in Stockholm. For about fifteen years, this was regarded as the finest school for girls in the capital and popular among <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>classes.</b>|$|R
50|$|Originally, burlesque {{performances}} included comic sketches lampooning <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>classes</b> {{and high}} art, such as opera, Shakespearean drama, and classical ballet. The genre developed alongside vaudeville and ran on competing circuits. Possibly due to historical social tensions between <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>classes</b> and lower classes of society, {{much of the}} humor and entertainment of later American burlesque focused on lowbrow and ribald subjects.|$|R

5|$|In Roman times, {{poisoning}} {{carried out}} {{at the dinner table}} or common eating or drinking area was not unheard of, or even uncommon, and was happening as early as 331 BC. These poisonings would have been used for self-advantageous reasons in every class of the social order. The writer Livy describes the poisoning of members of <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>class</b> and nobles of Rome, and Roman emperor Nero is known to have favored the use of poisons on his relatives, even hiring a personal poisoner. His preferred poison was said to be cyanide.|$|E
5|$|In some {{versions}} of the poem, considered older, Lalli's weapon was a sword. The axe was the murder weapon of Saint Olaf, who was very popular in Finland and may have influenced Henry's legend. However, since Lalli is not portrayed {{as a member of}} <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>class,</b> it is unlikely that he possessed an expensive weapon like a sword, and the axe is a more historically likely choice for Henry's murder.|$|E
5|$|It is the 1st Joker Card of the 1st Deck in the Dark Carnival mythology. Recording {{sessions}} for the album took place from 1991 to 1992 at Miller Midi Productions and The Tempermill Studio. The album {{is the first}} Joker's Card in the group's Dark Carnival mythology. The album's lyrics describe the Carnival of Carnage as {{a representation of the}} violence that occurs within the ghettos, which {{takes the form of a}} traveling carnival to enact the same brutality on <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>class.</b>|$|E

50|$|The Byzantines {{made and}} {{exported}} very richly patterned cloth, woven and embroidered for <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>classes,</b> and resist-dyed and printed for the lower. By Justinian's time the Roman toga {{had been replaced}} by the tunica, or long chiton, for both sexes, over which <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>classes</b> wore various other garments, like a dalmatica (dalmatic), a heavier and shorter type of tunica; short and long cloaks were fastened on the right shoulder.|$|R
5|$|Rastignac, {{who moved}} to Paris from the south of France, becomes {{attracted}} to <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>class.</b> He has difficulty fitting in, but is tutored by his cousin, Madame de Beauséant, {{in the ways of}} high society. Rastignac endears himself to one of Goriot's daughters, Delphine, after extracting money from his own already-poor family. Vautrin, meanwhile, tries to convince Rastignac to pursue an unmarried woman named Victorine, whose family fortune is blocked only by her brother. He offers to clear the way for Rastignac by having the brother killed in a duel.|$|E
5|$|The Titanics {{passengers}} {{were divided into}} three separate classes, determined {{not only by the}} price of their ticket but by wealth and social class: those travelling in first class, most of them the wealthiest passengers on board, included prominent members of <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>class,</b> businessmen, politicians, high-ranking military personnel, industrialists, bankers, entertainers, socialites, and professional athletes. Second class {{passengers were}} middle class travellers and included professors, authors, clergymen, and tourists. Third class or steerage passengers were primarily emigrants moving to the United States and Canada.|$|E
5|$|The diets of {{the wealthy}} were rich in sugars, which {{promoted}} periodontal disease. Despite the flattering physiques portrayed on tomb walls, the overweight mummies of many of <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>class</b> show {{the effects of a}} life of overindulgence. Adult life expectancy was about 35 for men and 30 for women, but reaching adulthood was difficult as about one-third of the population died in infancy.|$|E

5|$|The {{inhabitants}} {{were growing}} desperate {{to remove their}} belongings from the City, especially <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>class.</b> This provided a {{source of income for}} the able-bodied poor, who hired out as porters (sometimes simply making off with the goods), and it was especially profitable for the owners of carts and boats. Hiring a cart had cost a couple of shillings on the Saturday before the fire; on Monday, it rose to as much as £40, a fortune equivalent to more than £4,000 in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Central to {{the plot}} of the game are two main {{characters}}, Ramza Beoulve and Delita Heiral. The two characters are childhood friends, and while both are born of differing social classes; Ramza a noble and Delita a commoner, both disregarded this fact and grew up together believing in justice and honor, as taught by Ramza's father Balbanes. However, as the story progresses, the two characters faced many conflicts that changed their viewpoint on life; Delita seeks to manipulate <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>class</b> to achieve his dreams, while Ramza believes in justice and honor regardless of name and class.|$|E
5|$|During the Chou Dynasty, <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>class</b> {{considered}} daughters-in-law as commodities of the husband's parents, not the husbands. This {{meant that}} wives {{had to be}} subservient to parents-in-law. They were expected to have impeccable manners, including refraining from coughing and sneezing {{in the presence of}} their husbands' parents. Wives could not leave their rooms or accept gifts from relatives without permission. Refusal to turn gifts over to parents-in-law lead to physical abuse and expulsion from the family. In addition, wives were required to serve in-laws, including helping them bathe, arranging their bedding, and cooking. People placed a strong emphasis on food preparation in Ancient China. Cooking {{was one of the most}} time-consuming tasks for wives because of traditional rituals and high expectations for the taste and appeal of food.|$|E

5|$|Estañol's views {{represented}} {{those of}} the portion of <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>class</b> which was willing {{to come to terms}} with at least a portion of the middle class in order to crush the peasant uprisings, as exemplified by those of Zapata, which were erupting throughout Mexico. Limantour, who broadly agreed with Estañol, had the support of the Mexican financiers, who feared the downgrading of Mexican international credit and a general economic crisis as a result of ongoing social unrest, as well as that of the large landowners who were willing {{to come to terms with}} Madero if it would put an end to the agrarian uprisings.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} {{leading up to}} the {{outbreak}} of the war, the Flemish Movement had become an increasing phenomenon in Belgian politics. Traditionally French had been the dominant language of the Belgian government and <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>class</b> of Belgian society. After a period of marginalization, the Flemish Movement succeeded in achieving increased status for Dutch language, one of the movement's chief objectives, culminating in the legal recognition of Dutch as a national language in 1898. In 1914 new laws were passed giving further concessions to the movement, but the outbreak of war meant that their implementation had been postponed. Numerous grievances were left unaddressed. Among the outstanding grievances was the University of Ghent which, though situated in Flanders, taught exclusively in French.|$|E
5|$|Industrialisation, {{urbanisation}} and the Disruption of 1843 all {{undermined the}} tradition of parish schools. From 1830 the state began to fund buildings with grants; then from 1846 it was funding schools by direct sponsorship; and in 1872 Scotland moved to a system like that in England of state-sponsored largely free schools, run by local school boards. The historic University of Glasgow became a leader in British higher education by providing {{the educational needs of}} youth from the urban and commercial classes, as opposed to <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>class.</b> The University of St Andrews pioneered the admission of women to Scottish universities. From 1892 Scottish universities could admit and graduate women and the numbers of women at Scottish universities steadily increased until the early 20th century.|$|E
