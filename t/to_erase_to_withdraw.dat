40|$|This {{analysis}} of Mapocho (2002), {{a novel by}} Chilean writer and performer Nona Fernández, explores {{the significance of the}} author’s environmentalist representation of Chilean history as the accumulation of spiritual and material contaminants—ghosts and trash—that the victorious from throughout the country’s history have attempted <b>to</b> <b>erase</b> <b>to</b> further various economic and political agendas, particularly the neoliberal model installed during the Pinochet dictatorship. Fernández’s depiction of Chile as an ecological and spiritual wasteland in which the female protagonist (re) collects, recycles and reuses the specters and detritus of past conflicts represents the author’s own literary project of advocating for human rights and environmental justice during the Chilean transition while modeling a way to counter the collective amnesia promoted under the newly established democracy...|$|R

50|$|An EPROM is an {{erasable}} ROM {{that can}} be changed more than once. However, writing new data to an EPROM requires a special programmer circuit. EPROMs have a quartz window that allows them <b>to</b> be <b>erased</b> with ultraviolet light, but the whole device is cleared at one time. A one-time programmable (OTP) device uses an EPROM chip but omits the quartz window in the package; this is less costly to manufacture. An electrically erasable programmable read-only memory EEPROM uses electrical signals <b>to</b> <b>erase</b> memory. These erasable memory devices require {{a significant amount of}} time <b>to</b> <b>erase</b> data and <b>to</b> write new data; they are not usually configured to be programmed by the processor of the target system. Data is stored by use of floating gate transistors which require special operating voltages to be applied to trap or release electric charge on an insulated control gate for storage sites.|$|R

40|$|To read is to understand, to question, to know, <b>to</b> forget, <b>to</b> <b>erase,</b> <b>to</b> deface, {{to repeat}} – {{that is to}} say, the endless prosopopoeia by which the dead are made to have a face and a voice which tells the allegory of their demise and allows us to apostrophize them in our turn. No degree of {{knowledge}} can ever stop this madness, {{for it is the}} madness of words. 1 When Paul de Man’s wartime journalism in Belgium for the collaborationist paper Le Soir was unearthed in 1987, four years after his death, deconstruction was placed on trial within and beyond the academy. The scandal revolved around legacy, survival and forgetting, and raised questions about how one might speak, or come after, such an event. In the immediate aftermath, Jacques Derrida reflected that the affair had bequeathed “the gift of an ordeal, the summons to a work of reading, historical interpretation, ethico-political reflection, an interminable analysis”. 2 For Derrida, those who read after de Man are left with a ceaseless labour of judgement, a reckoning with the past that remains a matter of the present and of the future. Derrida sees de Man’s life and thought as shaped by two separate but entangled temporalities that unsettle notions of ‘before’ and ‘after’: one was a traumatic “prehistoric prelude” in occupied Belgium, the other a “posthistoric afterlife, lighter, less serious” in America. The “war” that de Man endured within himself was lived at “the crossroads of these two incompatible and disjunctive temporalities”. The accused is dead, in ashes, with “neither the grounds, nor the means, still less the choice or the desire to respond”, leaving us, alone, “to carry his memory and his name in us”. 3 Those who are left behind must live at this crossroads too, reluctant to discount the mature body of work but unable to forget the youthful ‘error’ of the collaborationist articles. This responsibility to the future is a matter of judging, remembering and reckoning with these temporalities...|$|R
40|$|Beethoven's Promethean {{image has}} been {{reenforced}} in recent scholarship {{by the idea}} of the "heroic. " Although the escalation of the concept has been recognized as an act of selective hearing based on a handful of "heroic" works, Beethoven's Promethean identity is likely to remain because it embodies the ethical values of a particularly virulent strain of humanism; Beethoven is still employed today to mark the epochal events of human history - from the fall of the Berlin Wall to the atrocities of 9 / 11. However, the humanism this hero champions has been accused as a cause of the very inhumanity the music is suppose <b>to</b> <b>erase.</b> <b>To</b> offer an alternative is not difficult - there are many works by the composer that do not conform to the Promethean image; but the alternative would be meaningless if it were merely a matter of registering other topics or narratives without grounding the difference in a set of values that challenge the ethical force of the hero. This article sketches the possibility of such an alternative through the ethics of philosophers such as Emmanuel Lévinas and Theodor W. Adorno. It explores an-Other humanism in Beethoven both in the sense of an other Beethoven and a humanism founded on the Other. © 2009 by the American Musicological Society.

Several members of the Revolutionary Youth Movement of the 1960s eventually disavowed their radical pasts and wished <b>to</b> <b>erase</b> ties <b>to</b> their earlier actions. In several cases, former radicals were able to evade arrest for more than 20 years because, through ghosting, they acquired new identities in which they proceeded to live entirely law-abiding lives.
