50|$|Like their Type B 4-6-0 sister engines, the {{locomotives}} had bar frames. <b>The</b> <b>drivers,</b> <b>the</b> middle wheelset of the coupled wheels, were flangeless {{to enable}} the engine to negotiate sharp curves. The coupled wheels were not spaced equidistant from each other, with 39 in between the wheel centres of the leading wheelset <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>drivers</b> <b>and</b> 36 in between the wheel centres of <b>the</b> <b>drivers</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> trailing wheelset.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>drivers</b> <b>and</b> {{locomotive}} {{involved in}} the Eltham (Well Hall) derailment were allocated from Hither Green TMD.|$|R

5|$|The tender {{included}} a corridor connection and tunnel {{through the water}} tank giving access to the locomotive cab from the train so that <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>and</b> fireman could be changed without stopping the train. The following year the locomotive appeared in the film The Flying Scotsman.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} explosions in taxis caused by timer bombs. The first one {{occurred}} at 22:40 at Vile Parle, killing <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>and</b> a passenger. The second explosion {{took place at}} Wadi Bunder between 22:20 and 22:25. Three people, including {{the driver of the}} taxi were killed, and about 15 others were injured.|$|E
5|$|Construction was {{not without}} incident. In May 1860, a GNR train {{overshot}} the platform at King's Cross and fell into the workings. Later in 1860, a boiler explosion on an engine pulling contractor's wagons killed <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>and</b> his assistant. In May 1861, the excavation collapsed at Euston causing considerable damage to the neighbouring buildings. The final accident occurred in June 1862 when the Fleet sewer burst following a heavy rainstorm and flooded the excavations. The Met and the Metropolitan Board of Works managed to stem and divert {{the water and the}} construction was delayed by only a few months.|$|E
50|$|The Acadiane {{was also}} fitted with wind-down windows in <b>the</b> <b>driver's</b> <b>and</b> passenger's doors. <b>The</b> Dyane car had horizontally-sliding windows.|$|R
50|$|The circuit has an {{elevation}} of 2,285 m (7,500 ft); the thin air causes difficulties for both <b>the</b> <b>drivers</b> <b>and</b> their cars.|$|R
50|$|It was {{announced}} on 24 March 2006 by the FIA that future races {{will again be}} held at the redesigned Fuji Speedway (now owned by Toyota) in Oyama, Sunto District, Shizuoka Prefecture. The news of the Japanese Grand Prix moving to the circuit redesigned by Hermann Tilke was met with some trepidation, as the Honda-owned Suzuka was a favorite of many of <b>the</b> <b>drivers</b> <b>and</b> Hermann Tilke's tracks have received mixed reviews from <b>the</b> <b>drivers</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> fans.|$|R
5|$|L'Homme-Rivière is {{a statue}} {{representing}} a log driver at work. The logs are heavily stylized, reduced {{to little more}} than cylinders. <b>The</b> <b>driver</b> <b>and</b> his hook, however, are shown as transforming into a wooden plant. Its location, in a tight space between two tall buildings, gives the sculpture the appearance of travelling down a river gorge. L'Homme-Rivière is highly dynamic, and has been described as looking as though it is about to spill onto the sidewalk. The log driver is a symbolic figure in the history and culture of Quebec, thanks notably to Félix-Antoine Savard's famous novel Menaud, maître draveur.|$|E
5|$|On 13 April 1948, {{the goods}} hoist to the Waterloo and City line began to sink while a M7 class tank engine was pushing loaded coal wagons onto it. The engine {{dropped into the}} hoist's shaft, ending up {{upside-down}} and spurting steam over it. <b>The</b> <b>driver</b> <b>and</b> fireman managed to jump free, and the locomotive was rescued piecemeal and used for spares.|$|E
5|$|The {{upper body}} had a crew {{compartment}} with three bench seats, one for <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>and</b> his assistant, {{and two others}} for the crew. The rear cargo area contained storage compartments, {{one on each side}} and two in the rear. The windshield could fold forward and was also removable. A convertible canvas top was mounted above the rear storage compartments. It fastened to the windshield when erected.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Fiesta Sporting Trophy" [...] is a One Make Championship; {{beginning}} its 1st {{season in}} March 2006. It combines keen competition with equal performance {{and leaves the}} decision about winning or losing to <b>the</b> <b>drivers</b> <b>and</b> co-drivers capabilities. <b>The</b> <b>driver,</b> co-driver <b>and</b> mechanics {{work as a team}} to compete against the toughest adversary of all—the clock.|$|R
50|$|In 2003 and 2004, BCN raced in International Formula 3000/GP2 Series, {{finishing}} as runner-up in both <b>the</b> <b>drivers</b> <b>and</b> teams {{championships in}} 2004.|$|R
50|$|This is {{also the}} only {{generation}} of the Honda Odyssey where the power windows are only on <b>the</b> <b>driver's</b> <b>and</b> front passenger's doors.|$|R
5|$|As Michael {{travels to}} Haddonfield, Laurie begins having {{hallucinations}} that mirror Michael's and also begin to include her acting out his murders. Meanwhile, Loomis goes on tour {{to promote his}} new book, only to be criticized by the public, who blame him for Michael's actions and for exploiting the deaths of Michael's victims. When Loomis' book is released, Laurie discovers that she is really Angel Myers, Michael's long-lost sister. She goes to a party with Mya (Brea Grant) and Harley (Angela Trimbur) to escape how she is feeling. Michael appears and kills Harley, then goes to the Brackett house and fatally wounds Annie Brackett (Danielle Harris). When Laurie and Mya arrive, Michael kills Mya and then comes after Laurie, who manages to escape. Laurie flags down a car, but Michael kills <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>and</b> flips the car over with Laurie still inside. Michael then takes the unconscious Laurie to an abandoned shed.|$|E
5|$|New {{locomotives}} {{were ordered}} from Stephenson's, {{but the first}} was too heavy when it arrived in February 1828. It was rebuilt with six wheels and hailed as a great improvement, Hackworth being told to convert the remaining locomotives as soon as possible. In 1828 two locomotive boilers exploded within four months, both killing <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>and</b> both due to the safety valves being left fixed down while the engine was stationary. Horses were also used on the line, and they could haul up to four waggons. The dandy cart was introduced in mid-1828: a small cart {{at the end of}} the train, this carried the horse downhill, allowing it to rest and the train to run at higher speed. The S made their use compulsory from November 1828.|$|E
5|$|Subwoofers use speaker drivers (woofers) {{typically}} between 8-inch (20cm) and 21-inch (53cm) in diameter. Some uncommon subwoofers use larger drivers, {{and single}} prototype subwoofers {{as large as}} 60-inch (152cm) have been fabricated. On the smaller end of the spectrum, subwoofer drivers as small as 4-inch (10cm) may be used. Small subwoofer drivers in the 4-inch range are typically used in small computer speaker systems and compact home theatre subwoofer cabinets. The size of <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>and</b> number of drivers in a cabinet depends {{on the design of}} the loudspeaker enclosure, the size of the cabinet, the desired sound pressure level, the lowest frequency targeted and the level of permitted distortion. The most common subwoofer driver sizes used for sound reinforcement in nightclubs, raves and pop/rock concerts are 10-, 12-, 15- and 18-inch models (25cm, 30cm, 38cm, and 45cm respectively). The largest available sound reinforcement subwoofers, 21-inch (53cm) drivers, are less commonly seen.|$|E

5|$|The {{auxiliary}} {{system is}} powered via a separate transformer winding feeding three independent {{insulated gate bipolar transistor}} (IGBT) converters each providing a three-phase 400volt system. The locomotive is designed {{with an open}} system architecture that can be adapted later. Diagnostic information is available to <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>and</b> can be sent to the control center via GSM-R. The locomotive has a large and bright cab with space for up to three people. The second series of locomotives have an improved driver's chair, which has been retrofitted on the older trains. The machine room has a center hallway. All high-current equipment is located behind a door which can only be opened with a special key. This key is locked {{in such a way that}} it cannot be accessed without grounding the locomotive, and similarly the locomotive cannot be ungrounded again until the key is back in place.|$|E
5|$|The current {{color scheme}} was {{selected}} in 1974 by then athletic director and former head coach Bobby Dodd. The original Wreck decor featured a wooden GT shield on both <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>and</b> passenger-side doors. This shield was removed during Dodd's revitalization {{of the old}} Model A. Dodd chose an old gold paint from a Lincoln car paint catalogue as the base for the new color scheme. He also placed a slightly stretched GT emblem on the door, a Tech helmet on the rear quarter panel, and a 1952 version of the Yellow Jacket on the front quarter panel. According to Tech lore, Bobby Dodd was so enamored with the Lincoln gold that he changed the football helmet and uniform color to match the new Ramblin' Wreck paint scheme.|$|E
5|$|The job goes awry {{when the}} {{pawnshop}} owner shoots and kills Standard while the Driver {{is waiting for}} him with Cook's accomplice, Blanche. Pursued by a mysterious adversary, <b>the</b> <b>Driver</b> <b>and</b> Blanche escape after an intense car chase. The Driver hides with Blanche in a motel where he learns from a news report that Standard, according to the pawnshop owner, performed the robbery by himself and that no money had been stolen. When she lies about being oblivious to the second car when the Driver interrogates her, he slaps Blanche and threatens to hurt her {{to get her to}} talk. Blanche then admits that the bag contains a million dollars and that she and Cook planned to re-steal the money using the car that chased them. Two of Cook's men ambush them in the motel room, and kill Blanche before the Driver manages to kill them both.|$|E
