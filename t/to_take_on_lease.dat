5000|$|On William's death, {{prior to}} 1558, his {{daughter}} Ursula was his heiress; {{there seems to}} be an agreement that the lease would pass to her and her husband Andrew Mowat of Hugoland. Andrew was appointed [...] "tutor" [...] to Ursula's brother, John Tulloch, in 1558, which indicates John was too young <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> the <b>lease.</b>|$|R

50|$|The Museum's {{first big}} {{opportunity}} came in 1975 when the former Borough Council Offices at 61 High Street became redundant following the major local government re-organisation. Arun District Council offered the Museum Society the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a <b>lease</b> <b>on</b> this Grade 2* listed Georgian building. The Society {{created a new}} museum which was opened in 1977. At this time AMS became a Charity (No 273790).|$|R
50|$|In 2009 Network Rail {{proposed}} to demolish the empty station building. A 'Friends of Trimley Station' group was formed and Network Rail {{agreed that they}} would leave it standing if a viable use was found for it. Suffolk Coastal District Council asked the local residents and {{found that there was}} a demand for a community meeting place and an internet café. In 2011 Network Rail offered the Friends a two-year lease to allow them time to waterproof the building and secure the funding necessary to create a meeting room and café. If successful they would then grant a long-term lease. By {{the end of the year}} the Friends had succeeded in establishing a limited company, Trimley Station Community Trust, <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> the <b>lease.</b>|$|R
50|$|Over {{his career}} he saved £85 from his wages as a footballer, enough <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> the <b>lease</b> of a shop near the club's old Arthur Street ground, buy tools, {{and set up}} his own {{plumbing}} business. He made such a success of it that within ten years he was being {{invited to join the}} Small Heath board. By this time the ground at Muntz Street was becoming inadequate; a new stadium was needed, and Morris's business acumen again came to the fore. He identified an area of wet, sloping wasteland next to a railway as a potentially suitable site for a state-of-the-art football ground, convinced his fellow directors to back the idea, and served on the committee formed to organise the works. Within ten months of the land being acquired, the new ground, which would become known as St Andrew's, was opened.|$|R

50|$|The act was {{originally}} {{supported by the}} Manchester and Leeds Railway (M&LR), who were to provide half the capital for the line, as well as work the railway for 40% of net profit; during {{the passage of the}} bill through parliament agreement was reached that a rival company, the South Yorkshire Coal Railway and Canal Company would take control of the line south of Barnsley, and the LYR the portion north, with each company having running powers over the Silkstone and Dodsworth branches. The split in capital apportioned to the construction of the line was $450,000 for the northern part and £350,000 for the southern part. The M&LR withdrew from the capital subscription arrangements, and instead agreed <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a <b>lease</b> <b>on</b> the line.|$|R
50|$|His {{father was}} Bonjorn del Barri, a wealthy {{merchant}} {{of the province}} of Roussillon {{just north of the}} Pyrenees, which at that time was part of the Catalan Kingdom of Majorca. In 1323 del Barri is recorded as having been granted permission by King Sancho of Majorca to join the council of the Jewish community of Perpignan; and to travel and trade freely throughout the country, without having to wear a yellow badge or any other symbol to mark him out as a Jew. However by 1327 del Barri was dead, and David Bonjorn appears successfully petitioning James II of Aragon to relax various provisions of his father's will, including requirements on him to move from Cotlliure and reside in Perpignan for two years; to lend no money to the new king of Majorca or his courtiers until the king's twentieth birthday; nor to provide guarantees for anyone, apart from his own sisters; nor <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a <b>lease</b> <b>on</b> any royal incomes. Bonjorn appears to have been the only male heir; but his sisters mentioned in the document include one called Venges, who {{went on to become the}} wife of the celebrated Jewish author Joseph Caspi.|$|R
50|$|In 1991, Crehan {{agreed with}} Inntrepreneur, which {{controlled}} 7,355 pubs, <b>to</b> <b>take</b> two <b>leases</b> <b>on</b> pubs in Staines, {{where he would}} have to buy the beer from Courage Ltd, which owned 19% of UK beer sales. He had to buy beer exclusively at a specified price. The lease was a standard form, and it was not negotiable. In 1991, Courage and Grand Metropolitan had set up Inntrepreneur as a jointly owned company. The leases were all extended to 20 years, much longer than previously. However, the Secretary of State, in charge of competition law enforcement at the time, required that holdings be reduced to 4,350 by October 1992, and that ties be released by March 1998. However Crehan could not compete for anywhere near that long against free houses nearby who could buy beer more cheaply, and in September 1993 his business failed, with a loss. He was sued for £15,226 for outstanding sums for beer. Courage Ltd claimed that Crehan had not paid for deliveries of beer. Crehan argued that the agreement was contrary to TEC article 81, and unenforceable, and counterclaimed for damages. It was shown that free houses were able to buy beer at much lower prices than tied tenants, reducing their profitability.|$|R

60|$|I {{got rid of}} Mr. Newcome by {{the grant}} of the lease, his whole {{manoeuvring}} having been attempted solely to lower the rent; for he was much too shrewd {{to believe in the}} truth of his own doctrines on the subject of right and wrong. That same day my axe-men appeared at the 'Nest, having passed the intermediate time in looking at various tracts of land that were in the market, and which they had not found so eligible, in the way of situation, quality, or terms, as those I offered. By this time, the surveyed lots of Mooseridge were ready, and I offered to sell them to these emigrants. The price was only a dollar an acre, with a credit of ten years; the interest to be paid annually. One would have thought that the lowness of the price would have induced men to prefer lands in fee to lands on lease; but these persons, to a man, found it more to their interests <b>to</b> <b>take</b> farms <b>on</b> three-lives <b>leases,</b> being rent-free for the first five years, and at nominal rents {{for the remainder of the}} term, than to pay seven dollars a year of interest, and a hundred dollars in money, at the expiration of the credit.[11] This fact, of itself, goes to show how closely these men calculated their means, and the effect their decisions might have on their interests. Nor were their decisions always wrong. Those who can remember the start the country took shortly after the peace of '83, the prices that the settlers on new lands obtained for their wheat, ashes, and pork; three dollars a bushel often for the first, three hundred dollars a ton for the second, and eight or ten dollars a hundred for the last, will at once understand that the occupant of new lands at that period obtained enormous wages for a laborer by means of the rich unexhausted lands he was thus permitted to occupy. No doubt he would have been in a better situation had he owned his farm in fee at the end of his lease; so would the merchant who builds a ship and clears her cost by her first freight, have been a richer man had he cleared the cost of two ships instead of one; but he has done well, notwithstanding; and it is not to be forgotten that the man who commences life with an axe and a little household furniture, is in the situation of a mere day-laborer. The addition to his means of the use of land is the very circumstance that enables him to rise above his humble position, and to profit by the cultivation of the soil. At the close of the last century, and at the commencement of the present, the country was so placed as to render every stroke of the axe directly profitable, the very labor that was expended in clearing away the trees meeting with a return so liberal by the sale of the ashes manufactured, as to induce even speculators to engage in the occupation. It may one day be a subject of curious inquiry to ascertain how so much was done as is known to have been done at that period, toward converting the wilderness into a garden; and I will here record, for the benefit of posterity, a brief sketch of one of the processes of getting to be comfortable, if not rich, that was much used in that day.|$|R

60|$|Framley Parsonage--or, rather, my {{connection}} with the Cornhill--was the means of introducing me very quickly to that literary world from which I had hitherto been severed by the fact of my residence in Ireland.
