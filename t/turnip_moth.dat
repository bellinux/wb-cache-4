40|$|Abstract The pheromone-mediated upwind {{flight of}} male <b>turnip</b> <b>moths</b> was {{observed}} in a flight tunnel {{at different times of}} day under conditions of a light-dark (LD) cycle, constant darkness (DD), and a shifted photoperiod. Under both LD and DD conditions, a significantly larger number of males flew to the pheromone during both the scotophase and the subjective scotophase than dur-ing the photophase and the subjective photophase for 2 consecutive days. When 1 -day-old moths were transferred to a shifted LD cycle with lights turned off 4 h earlier, male behavioral responses to the pheromone advanced in time accord-ingly by 4 h. This showed that male behavioral responses to the pheromone are under the control of an endogenous oscillator. To further examine the level at which the circadian rhythm of the male behavioral response is regulated, the authors tested the olfactory responses of male antennal receptors to pheromone stimuli by means of electroantennograms (EAG) at different times of day.

40|$|Male moths use female-produced pheromones as {{orientation}} cues {{during the}} mate-finding process. In {{addition to the}} needs of evaluating {{the quality and quantity of}} the pheromone signal, the male moth also needs to resolve the filamentous structure of the pheromone plume to proceed toward the releasing point successfully. To understand how a discontinuous olfactory signal is processed at the central lever, we used intracellular recording methods to characterize the response patterns of antennal lobe (AL) neurons to pulsatile stimulation with the full female-produced pheromone blend and its single components in male <b>turnip</b> <b>moths,</b> Agrotis segetum. Air puffs delivered at frequencies of 1, 3, 5, 7, or 10 Hz were used to carry the stimulus. Two types of AL neurons were characterized according to their capabilities to resolve stimulus pulses. The most common type could resolve at least l-Hz pulses, thus termed fast neurons; another type could not resolve any pulses, thus termed slow neurons. When fast neurons were excited by stimuli, they always displayed biphasic response patterns, a depolarization phase followed by a hyperpolarization phase. This pattern could be evoked by stimulation with both the single pheromone components and the blend. The pulse-resolving capability of the fast neurons correlated significantly with the size of the hyperpolarization phase. When the amplitude was higher and the fall time of the hyperpolarization faster, the neuron could follow more pulses per second. Moreover, interactions between different pheromone components eliciting different response patterns did not improve the pulse-resolving capability of fast neurons...|$|R

40|$|The long-range, pheromone-mediated, flight {{behaviour}} of male moths under {{natural and}} mating disruption conditions was monitored {{by means of}} harmonic radar. Individual male <b>turnip</b> <b>moths,</b> Agrotis segetum (Denis & Schiffermüller) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), tagged with radar transponders, were released and tracked in plots with or without disruptive doses of sex pheromone. In addition, male attraction to pheromone-baited traps and mating of calling females in treated and untreated plots was investigated. High doses of a four-component pheromone blend reduced trap catch by 79 % and mating of females by 62 % when compared with control plots in pre-radar experiments. Surprisingly, this effect {{was not associated with}} any pronounced differences in flight behaviour of males between a treatment and a control plot as revealed by harmonic radar recordings. In total, 20 flight tracks from a control plot and 22 flight tracks from a treatment plot were analysed. Moths could be followed for up to 77 min, corresponding to a track length of 7350 m. Mean ground speed ranged from 0. 7 m s 1 to 5. 4 m s 1. There was a strong trend (P = 0. 06) for a greater number of male orientations to traps from downwind in the control field compared to the treatment field. Many flight tracks were fragmented due to radar shadow. Advantages and constraints using harmonic radar to study the pheromone-mediated flight behaviour of nocturnal moths are discussed...|$|R

5000|$|The {{common name}} of this species refers to the {{supposed}} shapes of the bold dark stigmata on the usually pale forewings. In this species all the stigmata have a rounded shape, contrasting with the elongated claviform stigmata of the much commoner heart and dart. The hindwings are grey, usually much darker than in heart and dart and <b>turnip</b> <b>moth.</b> The wingspan is 35-40 mm. The moth flies at night in June and July [...] and is attracted to light and sugar.|$|E
5000|$|The term cutworm applies {{mainly to}} larvae of various {{species in the}} Noctuidae, a large family of moths; however many Noctuid species are not cutworms, and some moths whose larvae have {{essentially}} the same habit, which justifies calling them cutworms, are not Noctuids. The larvae of the <b>turnip</b> <b>moth,</b> (Agrotis segetum, Agrotis ipsilon, Agrotis exclamationis), are well-known Noctuids whose larvae are very damaging cutworms. Cutworms are notorious agricultural and garden pests. They are voracious leaf, bud, and stem feeders and can destroy entire plants. They get their name from their habit of [...] "cutting" [...] off a seedling at ground level by chewing through the stem. Some species are subterranean and eat roots.|$|E
5000|$|This is a quite {{variable}} species, forewings {{ranging from}} pale to dark brown but always recognizable by the distinctively shaped dark stigmata which give it its common name. The hindwings are whitish (compared with other common Agrotis species the hindwings {{of this species}} are usually paler than in heart and club but darker than in <b>turnip</b> <b>moth).</b> The wingspan is 35-44 mm. This species usually has a dark area {{at the front of}} the thorax, visible as a horizontal bar when viewing the moth head-on. This moth flies at night from May to July [...] and is attracted to light, sometimes in large numbers. It also frequently visits nectar-rich flowers such as Buddleia, ragwort and red valerian.|$|E
50|$|Cucurbita {{species are}} used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, {{including}} the Cabbage Moth (Mamestra brassicae), Hypercompe indecisa, and the <b>Turnip</b> <b>Moth</b> (Agrotis segetum). Cucurbita can be susceptible to the pest Bemisia argentifolii (silverleaf whitefly) as well as aphids (Aphididae), cucumber beetles (Acalymma vittatum and Diabrotica undecimpunctata howardi), squash bug (Anasa tristis), the squash vine borer (Melittia cucurbitae), and the twospotted spidermite (Tetranychus urticae). The squash bug causes major damage to plants because of its very toxic saliva.The red pumpkin beetle (Raphidopalpa foveicollis) is a serious pest of cucurbits, especially the pumpkin, which it can defoliate.Cucurbits are susceptible to diseases such as bacterial wilt (Erwinia tracheiphila), anthracnose (Colletotrichum spp.), fusarium wilt (Fusarium spp.), phytophthora blight (Phytophthora spp. water molds), and powdery mildew (Erysiphe spp.). Defensive responses to viral, fungal, and bacterial leaf pathogens do not involve cucurbitacin.|$|E
40|$|The {{circadian}} {{variation of}} pheromone {{production in the}} <b>turnip</b> <b>moth,</b> Agrotis segetum, was characterized by quantifying (Z) - 7 -dodecenyl acetate (Z 7 - 12 :OAc), the most abundant pheromone component produced by female <b>turnip</b> <b>moth,</b> {{at different times of}} day. Under 17 : 7 h light-dark cycle (LD), the peak of Z 7 - 12 :OAc production occurred around 4 h into the scotophase, while there was very little pheromone production during the photophase. When females were maintained under constant darkness (DD), the periodicity of pheromone production was sustained for 3 consecutive days. Furthermore, the rhythm in pheromone production could be entrained to a shifted LD. These results demonstrate that the pheromone production in the <b>turnip</b> <b>moth</b> is regulated endogenously by a circadian clock. To understand how the circadian rhythm of pheromone production is generated, circadian variation of pheromone- biosynthesis-activating neuropeptide (PBAN) -like activity in the brain-suboesophageal ganglion complexes (Br-SOG), hemolymph, and ventral nerve cord (VNC) was also examined. Under both LD and DD, only the VNC displayed a circadian variation in the PBAN-like activity, which was significantly higher during the late-photophase than that in the scotophase. In addition, the present study showed that removal of VNC in isolated abdomen did not affect PBAN stimulation of pheromone production, while severing the VNC impaired normal pheromone production. The role of Br-SOG, VNC, and hemolymph in the regulation of the periodicity of pheromone production is discussed...|$|E
