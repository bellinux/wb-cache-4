5|$|Earp and Behan both {{applied to}} fill the new {{position}} of Cochise County sheriff, which like the Pima County sheriff job, paid the office holder 10% of <b>the</b> <b>fees</b> and taxes collected.

5000|$|A strong {{campaign}} {{developed in}} the late 1990s from {{a section of the}} public against <b>the</b> Broadcasting <b>Fee.</b> <b>The</b> reason behind the campaign was to prove [...] "whether <b>the</b> broadcasting <b>fee</b> is a tax and the legality of applying GST to this tax". In <b>the</b> end <b>the</b> <b>fee</b> was scrapped in 1999, and the Commission has since been directly funded by <b>the</b> government. <b>The</b> <b>fee</b> was collected from those people who owned a television set although <b>the</b> <b>fee</b> was funding much more than television work, especially radio. Some campaigners believed this was unfair.|$|R
5|$|In 1859 {{a further}} {{edition of the}} Statutes was issued; the changes related mainly to the costs {{associated}} with the Order. Prior to this date it had been the policy that the insignia (which were provided by the Crown) were to be returned on the death of the holder; the exception had been foreigners who had been awarded honorary membership. In addition foreigners had usually been provided with stars made of silver and diamonds, whereas ordinary members had only embroidered stars. The decision was made to award silver stars to all members, and only require the return of the Collar. The Crown had also been paying <b>the</b> <b>fees</b> due to the officers of the Order for members who had been appointed for the services in the recent war. <b>The</b> <b>fees</b> were abolished and replaced with a salary of approximately the same average value. The offices of Genealogist and Messenger were abolished, and those of Registrar and Secretary combined.|$|E

5|$|While at college, Reed interned for Congressman Joseph Patrick KennedyII. During his {{internship}} {{he learned}} about a federal dollar-for-dollar matching grant program. In his senior year and as the undergraduate trustee on the University's Board of Trustees, he instituted a $15-per-semester student fee increase to be matched by the federal grant, with monies to be earmarked for the university's endowment. <b>The</b> <b>fees</b> were expected to total nearly $300,000 per semester. The estimate was conservative {{in the sense that}} it only assumes <b>the</b> <b>fees</b> from slightly more than 75% of the 12,000 students. The four-year totals would approach a $2.4million addition to the endowment. Reed earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science in 1991. He earned his juris doctorate from Howard University School of Law in 1995. In 2002 Reed was appointed as the youngest General Trustee to serve on Howard's Board of Trustees and continues to serve on that board.|$|E
40|$|Prominent {{economically}} oriented legal academics {{are currently}} arguing that <b>the</b> <b>fee</b> simple, <b>the</b> dominant form of private landownership in the United States, is an inefficient way for society to allocate land. They maintain that <b>the</b> <b>fee</b> simple blocks transfers {{of land to}} higher value uses because it provides property owners with a perpetual monopoly. The critics propose that landownership be reformulated to enable private actors to forcibly purchase land from other private owners, {{similar to the way}} that governments can expropriate land for public uses using eminent domain. While recognizing the significance of the critique, this Article takes issue with it and defends <b>the</b> <b>fee</b> simple. <b>The</b> Article makes two main points in defense of <b>the</b> <b>fee</b> simple. First, addressing the critique on its own economic terms, the Article argues that the critics have not established that there is a robust economic argument for dispensing with <b>the</b> <b>fee</b> simple. <b>The</b> critique that <b>the</b> <b>fee</b> simple leads to the misallocation of land rests on three empirical premises for which the critics have yet to provide much evidence. The critique also downplays or overlooks important economic benefits of <b>the</b> <b>fee</b> simple. Second, departing from the economic discourse of the critics, the Article argues that <b>the</b> <b>fee</b> simple is valuable because it gives landowners a perpetual right to choose, free from the dictates of others, whether to transfer their land. Thus <b>the</b> <b>fee</b> simple expands <b>the</b> choices of landowners and promotes their independence and autonomy. Eliminating <b>the</b> <b>fee</b> simple would leave landowners vulnerable to the whims of others, and less free and autonomous. Landownership is not only about efficiency, but also about individual freedom...|$|R
5000|$|Cable providers, in contrast, see <b>the</b> <b>fee</b> {{as a cost}} {{of doing}} {{business}} which they are passing along to the customer. [...] By listing on their bill the portion attributable to <b>the</b> <b>fee,</b> customers may feel that government is responsible for that portion, not the cable provider. Also, since customers will immediately notice any increase in <b>the</b> <b>fee,</b> and may interpret it as a [...] "tax increase", listing it on the bill may discourage governments from pushing for an increase in <b>the</b> <b>fee</b> when <b>the</b> franchise agreement is renewed.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>fee</b> {{needs to}} be paid only for the {{principal}} (the F-1, J-1, or M-1).

5|$|A further {{example of}} an {{executive}} decision invalidated by improper purpose {{can be seen from}} Congreve v. Home Office (1976). In that case, the Home Secretary, who had the power to revoke television licences, purported to revoke the licences of people who had pre-empted a rise in licence fees by buying a licence at the old rate before the date when <b>the</b> <b>fees</b> were due to go up, even though their old licences had not yet expired. The court held that this was an improper exercise of the Home Secretary's discretionary powers. His power to revoke could not be used to raise revenue, and therefore this power had been used for the wrong purpose.|$|E
5|$|All {{citizens}} of Canada, {{as well as}} corporate bodies, may petition the Crown for an award of arms. For an individual to obtain a grant of arms, a petition must {{be sent to the}} Chief Herald, providing a biography, references, and completed application forms. If the grant is approved, the individual then consults with heralds from the Authority to work out the design of their award. Upon completion of this process, the grant documents, in the form of letters patent, are created and provided to the grantee. The entire process is subject to certain fees required by the Government of Canada to cover costs of research and artwork; <b>the</b> <b>fees</b> are not to purchase the grant of arms. For corporations and institutions the process is similar.|$|E
5|$|Although {{this was}} a good start, Hastings was not a {{particularly}} well-known barrister, and cases were few and far between.

To maintain the appearance of an active and busy chamber Hastings had his clerk borrow papers from other barristers and give them to the pupil to work on, claiming that they were cases of Hastings.|$|E

5|$|Aspinall {{worked closely}} with Epstein, who {{provided}} weekly notes for Aspinall {{to give to the}} group's stage act, their concert appearances, and <b>the</b> <b>fees</b> they would receive. The Beatles had to travel in Aspinall's van along with their equipment, but British roads in the early 1960s were notoriously pot-holed and slow to navigate. Ringo Starr remembered that the travelling never seemed to stop during the early tours of Britain in Aspinall's van, as they would be driven up and down Great Britain with one of the group in the passenger seat, but with the other three on a hard bench seat in the back.|$|E

50|$|To {{understand}} how a feebate works {{it is easier to}} break the feebate into <b>the</b> <b>fee</b> and rebate components. <b>The</b> <b>fee</b> could be compared to a gasoline tax that was paid when the vehicle is first purchased.

Upgrading this car to 25MPG would reduce <b>the</b> <b>fee</b> to $400. If the upgrade costs less than the $100 savings this change would be beneficial to both producer and consumer and would be adopted.|$|R
