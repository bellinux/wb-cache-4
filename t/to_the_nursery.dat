5|$|Despite the {{maternal}} care they receive, hatchlings commonly fall to predation. While the female is transporting some <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>nursery</b> area, others are picked off by predators that lurk near the nest. The hatchlings {{are a source}} of food for most of the creatures that feed on eggs, and are also subject to aquatic attacks by turtles, fish, and snakes. Birds of prey take their toll, and in any clutch there may be malformed individuals that are unlikely to survive. In northern Australia, the survival rate for saltwater crocodile hatchlings is only twenty-five percent, but with each succeeding year of life this improves, reaching sixty percent by year five. Mortality rates are fairly low among subadults and adults, though they are occasionally preyed on by large cats and snakes. The jaguar and the giant otter may prey on caimans in South America. In other parts of the world, elephants and hippopotamuses may kill crocodiles defensively. Authorities differ as to whether much cannibalism takes place among crocodilians. Adults do not normally eat their own offspring, but there is some evidence of subadults feeding on juveniles and of adults attacking subadults. In Nile crocodiles, rival males sometimes kill each other during the breeding season.|$|E

25|$|Established in 1870, the Golden Gate Park Nursery has {{remained}} {{one of the}} few places in the park restricted to the public. This nursery began with donated plants from around the world and expanded over the years with the care of past Golden Gate Park gardeners. The nursery has moved around the park thrice; first to where McLaren Lodge stands today, then to where Kezar Stadium is currently located and finally to its current location of Martin Luther King Jr. Drive. This Nursery houses over 800 species of plants, some of which are exclusive <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>nursery,</b> and are sold to the public on the third Saturday of the month. Every week over 3,000 plants are dispersed within the city and park. When the park requires repairing or is in need of empty beds filled, the Nursery provides its wide variety of plants to fill in the blank spaces. Indoors, the plants are set up in neat rows and beds, showing off the nursery’s green diversity for the buyers picking. The Golden Gate Park Nursery is one of the city’s main green providers and is greatly responsible for the city’s plant life.|$|E

40|$|Connectivity {{throughout}} {{the life cycle}} of flatfish remains an open question, especially during the early life stages. Their effective management requires understanding of how spawning grounds and nurseries are connected and what processes influence larval retention and dispersal. The case of sole (Solea solea L.) is of particular interest because {{it is one of the}} most valuable commercial species in the North Sea, although stocks are chronically overexploited and variability in interannual recruitment is high. The transport of sole larvae from <b>the</b> spawning grounds <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>nurseries</b> is driven by hydrodynamic processes, but the final dispersal pattern and larval survival/abundance might be influenced by both behavioral and environmental factors. Therefore it is important <b>to</b> understand <b>the</b> relative impact of hydrodynamics, environment, behavior and ecophysiology on sole larval dispersal. Here we use a particle-tracking transport model coupled to a 3 D hydro-dynamic model of <b>the</b> North Sea <b>to</b> investigate interannual variability of the transport of sole larvae over a 12 -year period (1995 - 2006). A sensitivity analysis is performed <b>to</b> assess <b>the</b> relative impact of hydrodynamics, temperature and behavior on <b>the</b> recruitment dynamics <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>nurseries.</b> Four scenarios have been tested: (i) constant forcing of sea surface temperature during all years but varying meteorological forcing and river runoff, (ii) constant meteorological forcing during the whole period but varying sea surface temperature and river runoff, (iii) no vertical migration and (iv) an extended drift period (max. 30 days) before settlement if the larvae are not close to a suitable sediment type. Results suggest that year-to-year variability of larval supply <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>nurseries</b> is high, both in terms of abundance and larval source (balance between retention and dispersal). Sensitivity analysis shows that larval abundance at the end of the larval stage increases considerably if a settling delay is included. The impact of vertical migration on larval transport and the variations in larval retention at <b>the</b> <b>nurseries</b> due <b>to</b> varying meteorological conditions and sea surface temperature forcing are not spatially consistent...|$|R
