2500|$|The remodel brought ample {{exterior}} {{space to}} the house. [...] Matching porches extended into {{the front and rear}} yard {{on either side of the}} north-facing, vertical entry and stair tower. Both porches were terminated in a broad stair between elongated planting piers. Aside from additional planters below <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>window</b> and outside the stairway window, the yard was simply landscaped. A low concrete wall topped by a similarly short wrought iron fence was incorporated sometime after construction to enclose the yard along the south and east lot lines.

The sidewalk at the front entrance was demarcated by Roman brick piers topped by glass-globed light fixtures. The yard additionally featured an original ticket booth from the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition which Moore had purchased and relocated to the site.|$|E

Brown had moved to the area from Windsor, Berkshire around six months previously. According to Moat, he crouched under the open window of the living room for an hour and a half, listening to Stobbart and Brown mocking him. At 2:40 am, Brown left the house to confront Moat but was shot at close range with a shotgun, and killed.

50|$|The {{dining room}} {{itself is a}} double-square in plan, and the triple-square of the service block is centred on it; the {{formality}} is entirely appropriate to the activity of dining and entertaining and can be interpreted, as Klaus Herdeg, an architect and author, has argued, as an architectural embodiment of the social traditions of the bourgeois family. Harry Gullichsen, {{as head of the}} household, occupied {{the head of the table}} facing towards the entrance. From there he could see along the axis to the entrance and beyond into the pine forest through the clerestory windows above the vestibule, and also diagonally through <b>the</b> entire <b>living</b> <b>room.</b> Mrs. Gullichsen would occupy the seat at the opposite end of the table, conveniently close to the servery and kitchen, from where, as Herdeg writes, she ‘can contemplate her husband silhouetted against the dining room’s asymmetrical fireplace, while through the window she can see the sauna, the pool, the garden court, and the pine forest - things natural or traditional. Most of these views the father would only see reflected in an artifice, <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>windows.</b>|$|R

The second one takes place shortly after that, where Rojer is making advances towards Sandie in bed, but she turns him down. The third one occurs when Killjoy tries to get the mirror to work, where he calls technical services, and appears to get into a heated argument with the operator, but Batty calms him down. Why these scenes were cut out or not presented in a deleted scenes section is unknown.|$|E

60|$|Outside {{the frightened}} monsters groped through the {{blinding}} rain and darkness {{in search of}} shelter. Each vivid lightning flash, and bellowing of booming thunder brought responsive cries of rage and terror from their hideous lips. It was Number Twelve who first spied the dim light showing through <b>the</b> bungalow's <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>window.</b> With a low guttural to his companions he started toward the building. Up the low steps to the verandah they crept. Number Twelve peered through the window. He saw no one within, but there was warmth and dryness.|$|R
50|$|The roof structure, {{which is}} about 18 feet (5.5 m) high at its highest point and whose {{underside}} is finished with narrow wooden strips, forms the ceiling of <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room.</b> Large triangular <b>windows</b> with protruding hoods {{in each of the}} four gables provide natural light for <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> while minimizing direct sunlight.

25|$|The {{main house}} has a balloon-frame {{structure}} on a concrete foundation. The roof is flat with a parapet wall running along the roof edge to conceal the asphalt roof. There is a large overhanging eave on the northeast front and north sides of the building. The exterior is covered with spatter-dashed stucco. <b>The</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> picture <b>windows</b> are casement style, set at a 110 degree angle. The remaining windows are a two-over-two double-hung type with horizontal muntins. The original doors were replaced in the 1970s. Unfortunately, there are no photographs of the originals doors so an appropriate Streamline Moderne style door with a round port window was installed during the 1996 renovation. The street front façade has three wide horizontal bands set out from the main wall surface that emphasize the design’s horizontal orientation.|$|R
5000|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Face Down" [...] {{parallels}} {{the song in}} its treatment of violence in a relationship. After arriving home, a young woman examines a bruise on her lower back, and begins to look for and examine items that she associates with her boyfriend (i.e. pictures, a card, letters). As she does so, objects around her start to suddenly move as if thrown or destroyed by the unseen hand of an abuser. The level of damage done escalates throughout the video, though the young woman does not react or acknowledge the growing violence around her. After a chair flies through <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>window,</b> she takes the pictures and letters and throws them into a garbage can outside her house. This unfolding scene is juxtaposed with shots of the band performing the song in a living room with lighting and decor which {{appear to be the}} young woman's.|$|E
5000|$|On Halloween, Red {{shows up}} at the Coslaws with some fortuitous news: He has won a romantic getaway to New York, but since he {{separated}} from his wife, he gives the tickets to Nan and Bob. Questioned by Marty and Jane, Red reveals that he bought the tickets as a ruse to get their parents to safety. With the now full moon in the sky, they head inside to wait for the werewolf. Despite their best efforts, the three fall asleep and are startled awake when Red (who has fallen asleep with a lit cigarette in his fingers), burns himself, jumps up and drops the gun, nearly setting it off. Red begins to doubt that the werewolf is real, much less going to show up, and orders Marty and Jane to bed. Jane suddenly screams in horror as she sees the werewolf looking at her from <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>window,</b> although when Red looks he finds nothing. Red starts to think that he is being fooled by the children and unloads the pistol. At that moment the werewolf tears the power cables out of the box and cuts the power to the house, leaving the trio with only the light from the fireplace. The werewolf then smashes through the wall of the house, attacking them. Despite Red's best efforts he is tossed around like a rag doll and Jane is suspended in midair. Marty manages to retrieve the cartridge (which was tossed around in the melee and had fallen through a heating vent in the floor) and shoots the werewolf in the right eye with the silver bullet. The corpse turns back into Reverend Lowe and has one last spasm before dying. Afterwards Marty and Jane both say, [...] "I love you" [...] and the narrator then says that she too can now say it.|$|E
40|$|To {{identify}} {{the nature of}} the decoration applied to the windows and other associated joinery elements in three significant rooms within the building. Samples were removed from the box frames, sashes, architrave, shutters and skirting boards {{and in the case of}} Mr Gaskell’s study, a bookcase thought have been installed at about the time the Gaskell’s took up residence in 1850.

50|$|The {{programme}} relaunched {{with a new}} logo {{and updated}} theme on Monday 22 January 2001. The house had also been redecorated in more muted colours, echoing the ill-fated 1996 revamp. The programme moved to a line up of three main presenters, Paul Tonkinson, Amanda Byram and Donna Air. However, Tonkinson was dropped from the programme {{at the end of}} March 2001 and Air departed not long after. Richard Bacon and Amanda Byram remained as main presenters, the programme having reverted to two main presenters once more. <b>The</b> <b>living</b> <b>room,</b> which had been repainted a dark red as part of the revamp, was changed to a bright yellow and pink design, while the main presenter chairs were also reinstalled in front of <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room's</b> French <b>windows.</b> They replaced the bright green sofa which had also been brought in as part of the revamp. The new logo was replaced with one more closely resembling the traditional Big Breakfast logo, albeit utilising a slightly different font.

So, less than a year later, 1side of stand has sunk from height of about 13 inches off of the ground to about 2 inches above the ground, which in turn caused the center railing to break.
