25|$|Air {{pollutant}} emission factors are reported representative values {{that attempt to}} relate the quantity of a pollutant released to the ambient air with an activity associated {{with the release of}} that pollutant. <b>These</b> <b>factors</b> <b>are</b> usually expressed as the weight of pollutant divided by a unit weight, volume, distance, or duration of the activity emitting the pollutant (e.g., kilograms of particulate emitted per tonne of coal burned). Such factors facilitate estimation of emissions from various sources of air pollution.
