40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{complementarity}} between two kin categories, i. e. laiul mwal (<b>children</b> <b>of</b> men) and laiul shoabut (<b>children</b> <b>of</b> women), {{found in the}} formation of land-holding groups in Falalap, Woleai Atoll, Central Caroline Islands. The fundamental units in Falalap social structure are matrilineal clans (gailang) and matrilineages or uxorilocal extended families. However, according to Falalap people, one does not belong exclusively to mother's group, but to both mother's and father's groups. Two categories are recognized among the members of a matrilineal clan. <b>The</b> <b>children</b> <b>of</b> male members are called laiul mwal (<b>children</b> <b>of</b> men) and <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>of</b> female members are called laiul shoabut (<b>children</b> <b>of</b> women). These two categories show oppositions in the complementary contexts of respect-avoidance behaviors and the formation of land-holding groups. Strict respect-avoidance behaviors are stipulated between brothers and sisters. In this context, <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>of</b> men are superior to <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>of</b> women. On <b>the</b> other hand, in the formation <b>of</b> land-holding groups, <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>of</b> women are superior to <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>of</b> men. A segment is formed only when certain members within a lineage receives land from their father's lineage. When <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>of</b> men received certain land from their father's group, they had certain obligations towards their father's group before World War II. When <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>of</b> men could not meet these obligations, <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>of</b> women could chase <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>of</b> men out. This relation between <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>of</b> women and <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>of</b> men is in sharp contrast with the cross-sibling relationship in the respect-avoidance behaviors, so {{that it is possible to}} say the cross-sibling relation in Falalap, Woleai shows complementarity across the contexts...|$|R

Noting Lépine's interest in violent action films, some suggested that violence in the media and in society may have influenced his actions.

5|$|Erika Hügel-Marshall {{was born}} on 13 March 1947, <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>of</b> a Bavarian woman and an African-American soldier, Eddie Marshall, who had {{returned}} to the US before her birth. Her parents had met just after the end of World War II, after a relaxation of laws forbidding military personnel from interacting with civilians. According to her, black soldiers treated native German children well, distributing food and clothing, but her parents generally met in secret due to racist remarks from others. In November 1946 her father returned to the US after an illness. By that time, both of them knew that her mother was pregnant, but she did not know he was leaving until after he was already gone. A year after Ika's birth, her mother married a German and a half-sister was born the following year. Her mother and grandmother loved her and treated her like any other child, despite social disapproval. She was close to her half-sister, but her step-father was distant toward her.|$|E

In an attempt to avoid his death, Kamsa sends a series of demons to Gokula, where Krishna is staying with his foster-parents.

5|$|Fontaneda {{explained}} in his 1571 memoir that Carlos controlled fifty villages located on Florida's west coast, around Lake Okeechobee (which they called Mayaimi) {{and on the}} Florida Keys (which they called Martires). Smaller tribes of Ais and Jaega who lived {{to the east of}} Lake Okeechobee, paid regular tributes to Carlos. The Spanish suspected the Calusa of harvesting treasures from shipwrecks and distributing the gold and silver between the Ais and Jaega, with Carlos receiving the majority. The main village of the Calusa, and home of Carlos, bordered Estero Bay at present-day Mound Key where the Caloosahatchee River meets the Gulf of Mexico. Fontaneda described human sacrifice as a common practice: when <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>of</b> a cacique died, each resident gave up a child to be sacrificed, and when the cacique died, his servants were sacrificed to join him. Each year a Christian was required to be sacrificed to appease a Calusa idol. The building of shell mounds of varying sizes and shapes was also of spiritual significance to the Calusa. In 1895 Frank Hamilton Cushing excavated a massive shell mound on Key Marco that was composed of several constructed terraces hundreds of yards long. Cushing unearthed over a thousand Calusa artifacts. Among them he found tools made of bone and shell, pottery, human bones, masks, and animal carvings made of wood.|$|E
5|$|Kubrick {{was born}} in the Lying-In Hospital at 307 Second Avenue in Manhattan, New York City, to a Jewish family.

His sister, Barbara Mary Kubrick, {{was born in}} May 1934. Jack Kubrick, whose parents and paternal grandparents were of Polish Jewish, Austrian Jewish, and Romanian Jewish origin, was a doctor, graduating from the New York Homeopathic Medical College in 1927, the same year he married Kubrick's mother, <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>of</b> Austrian Jewish immigrants. Kubrick's great-grandfather, Hersh Kubrick (also spelled Kubrik or Kubrike), arrived at Ellis Island via Liverpool by ship on December 27, 1899, at the age of 47, leaving behind his wife and two grown children, one of whom was Stanley's grandfather Elias, {{to start a new life}} with a younger woman. Elias Kubrick followed in 1902. At Stanley's birth, the Kubricks lived in an apartment at 2160 Clinton Avenue in the Bronx. Although his parents had been married in a Jewish ceremony, Kubrick did not have a religious upbringing, and would later profess an atheistic view of the universe. By the district standards of the West Bronx, the family was fairly wealthy, his father earning a good income as a physician.|$|E
