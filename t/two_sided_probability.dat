To {{determine the}} nature of interpreter needs for these departments. METHODS: Postal questionnaire survey of 255 A&E departments in the UK. RESULTS: A total of 197 replies were received, {{a response rate of}} 77. 3 %. Altogether 186 respondents answered the question on support for a national telephone interpreter service and 124 (66. 7 %) would support one. Those departments in favour were no more likely to have required an interpreter in the last seven days (chi 2 = 0. 16, df = 1, p = 0. 69), be in the inner city (Fisher's exact test, <b>two</b> <b>sided</b> <b>probability,</b> p = 1), have predominantly local population needs compared with tourist needs (chi 2 = 0. 65, df = 1, p = 0. 42), or be current users of a telephone interpreter service (chi 2 = 0. 01, df = 1, p = 0. 93). Seventy-nine of 180 (42. 9 %) departments had used some form of interpreter in the seven days preceding completion of the survey. Seventy-six of 86 (88. 4 %) of those departments using face to face interpreters had experienced difficulty obtaining an interpreter out of hours. Nationally, the following proportion of all A&E departments listed the named language as occurring among the three most common languages requiring interpretation: French 0. 46 (95 % confidence interval 0. 42 to 0. 50), Urdu 0. 30 (0. 26 to 0. 34), and German 0. 24 (0. 21 to 0. 27). CONCLUSIONS: There is widespread need and support for a national telephone interpreter service that would match the requirements of 24 hour emergency health care provision...|$|E
40|$|We {{reveal a}} contradiction in measure-theoretic probability. The contradiction is an "equation" $ 1 / 2 = 0 $ with its <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> {{representing}} <b>probabilities.</b> Unlike known paradoxes in mathematics, the revealed contradiction cannot be explained away and actually indicates that measure-theoretic probability is inconsistent. Appearing only in the theory, the contradiction {{does not exist in}} the physical world. So practical applications of measure-theoretic probability will not be affected by the inconsistency as long as "ideal events" in the theory (which will never occur physically) are not mistaken for real events in the physical world. Nevertheless, the inconsistency must be resolved. Constructive mathematics can avoid such inconsistency. There is no contradiction reported in constructive mathematics.

40|$|We {{report an}} {{inconsistency}} found in probability theory (also {{referred to as}} measure-theoretic probability). For probability measures induced by real-valued random variables, we deduce an "equality" such that {{one side of the}} "equality" is a probability, but the other side is not. For probability measures induced by extended random variables, we deduce an "equality" such that its <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> are unequal <b>probabilities.</b> The deduced expressions are erroneous only when it can be proved that measure-theoretic probability is a theory free from contradiction. However, such a proof does not exist. The inconsistency appears only in the theory rather than in the physical world, and will not affect practical applications as long as ideal events in the theory (which will not occur physically) are not mistaken for observable events in the real world. Nevertheless, unlike known paradoxes in mathematics, the inconsistency cannot be explained away and hence must be resolved. The assumption of infinite additivity in the theory is relevant to the inconsistency, and may cause confusion of ideal events and real events. As illustrated by an example in this article, since abstract properties of mathematical entities in theoretical thinking are not necessarily properties of physical quantities observed in the real world, mistaking the former for the latter may lead to misinterpreting random phenomena observed in experiments with microscopic systems. Actually the inconsistency is due to the notion of "numbers" adopted in conventional mathematics. A possible way to resolve the inconsistency is to treat "numbers" from the viewpoint of constructive mathematics. Comment: 15 pages, 1 figur...|$|R
