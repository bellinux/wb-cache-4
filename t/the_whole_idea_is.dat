500|$|Some {{comparisons}} {{have been}} made between the lyrical content of [...] "Homesick" [...] and MercyMe's 2001 single [...] "I Can Only Imagine." [...] David Jenison of CCM Magazine referred to the song as the 'sequel' to [...] "I Can Only Imagine." [...] Regarding these comparisons, Millard said [...] "’I Can Only Imagine’ took the focus off {{of what you are}} going through and was comforting because it put the focus on where they were going... ’Homesick’ is the opposite because it completely addresses us that are left here. I don’t think as a Christian that it’s right for me to say, ‘I wish you could’ve stayed here,’ because truthfully, we’re getting the raw end of the deal if we really believe what we say that heaven is as great as we want it to be. <b>The</b> <b>whole</b> <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> that we’re the ones who have to wait.” Millard has also noted, [...] "The difference with ‘Homesick’ [...] is that it talks about those who are stuck around here after someone passes away. When you lose somebody, you learn what being homesick is really about." ...|$|E
500|$|Framestore {{was chosen}} {{to work on the}} Cloak of Levitation, due to their work {{creating}} Rocket in Guardians of the Galaxy. Ceretti called Cloak's actions [...] "kind of scripted but not as deeply" [...] as the end result, and said that during the pre-visualization process [...] "we had a big discussion about the arc of the story of the Cloak in the film". Framestore also worked on environment shots, the Mandelbrot set sequences, high resolution digital doubles, the astral form, and the Crimson Bands of Cyttorak restraint for Kaecilius, totaling over 365 shots. Alexis Wajsbrot, Framestore's CG Supervisor, called the astral form [...] "one of the hardest effects we’ve had to deal with at Framestore; finding the right balance of a look that was subtle but also beautiful." [...] Lola VFX worked on the Zealots' eyes, supplementing the make-up work with effects based on a geode. They also created digital tears for Kaecilius when he is in the Crimson Bands of Cyttorak. In addition to Dormammu and the Dark Dimension, Luma Pictures also created the first mirror sequence {{at the beginning of the}} film. In creating Dormammu, Ceretti stated that they wanted to avoid the fiery head look from the comics as [...] "it had been done before. <b>The</b> <b>whole</b> <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> he's a character that lives in-between dimensions. He can also take whatever shapes he wants to take. [...] you can feel all these ripples in his face and all that stuff… these kind of opening windows to other dimensions, and all the reflective qualities of it. We really wanted to add the evocation of that fire, but we didn't want to do fire so we went for [...] multicolored approach to try and keep the psychedelic [...] of the entire space." [...] On the Dark Dimension, Ceretti said, [...] "We tried to make it alive all the time—the whole idea of the Dark Dimension is that it's a dynamic environment," [...] with the Luma team referencing the Ditko art and a poster that when lit [...] "with a blacklight it becomes very saturated [...] colors, crazy blacklight colors." [...] He continued, [...] "It was all about finding the right balance between all these elements to pay homage to and to tribute the work of Steve Ditko, but to make it more current to the 21st century. If you look at the detail of the shapes that we have in the Dark Dimension, you can almost point to things in the comic books [...] we really tried to be faithful to." ...|$|E

5000|$|None of {{the changes}} seems to have {{achieved}} very much.

2500|$|The {{pictorial}} {{ideals of}} Roh's original magic realism attracted new generations of artists through the latter {{years of the}} 20th century and beyond. In a 1991 New York Times review, critic Vivien Raynor remarked that [...] "John Stuart Ingle proves that Magic Realism lives" [...] in his [...] "virtuoso" [...] still life watercolors. Ingle's approach, as described in his own words, reflects the early inspiration of the magic realism movement as described by Roh; that is, the aim is not to add magical elements to a realistic painting, but to pursue a radically faithful rendering of reality; the [...] "magic" [...] effect on the viewer comes from the intensity of that effort: [...] "I don't want to make arbitrary changes in what I see to paint the picture, I want to paint what is given. <b>The</b> <b>whole</b> <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> to take something that's given and explore that reality as intensely as I can." ...|$|E

Why, above a century--no, no! And on the other hand, how easily one's fancy builds! A few straws and there's a nest and squawking fledglings, all complete. Is that why--is that why that good, practical wife of yours and all your faithful household have absconded?

I shall do the thing more systematically. I have heard no sound at all, and could almost believe that I had been the victim of some hallucination suggested, perhaps, by Armitage's conversation. Of course, <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> absurd, and yet I must confess that those bushes at the entrance of the cave do present an appearance as if some heavy creature had forced its way through them. I begin to be keenly interested. I have said nothing to the Miss Allertons, for they are quite superstitious enough already, but I have bought some candles, and mean to investigate for myself.|$|E
50|$|He {{came close}} to {{returning}} to the operatic stage when Richard Wagner considered casting him as Klingsor in Parsifal in 1882. However, <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> abandoned shortly afterwards due to a role confusion—the emasculated Klingsor was not a castrato, but a eunuch castrated past puberty and thus singing baritone, not soprano.|$|R

The {{last stop}} {{of the tour}} was Morocco, where he decided to settle, running his African Rhythms Club in Tangier for five years, from 1967 to 1972.

50|$|The Local New Brighton Farmers’ Market opens every Tuesday {{morning from}} 8am to 11 am. <b>The</b> <b>whole</b> <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> to bring farm fresh produce to local residents, {{not the other}} way around.

The produce is mainly organically farmed and needs only to be transported a short distance, reducing transport costs and the carbon footprint.|$|E

50|$|For a Rule of life, Norbert {{chose the}} Rule of St. Augustine as was common among {{communities}} of clergy. In addition he adapted {{some of the}} customs of the Cistercians.

50|$|Service-Ability, therefore, {{emerges from}} an {{organization}}-wide team spirit {{based on a}} culture of trust between colleagues and between {{the people and their}} leaders, a belief in what the organization stands for and what it seeks for itself, and pride in the job: all embedded within a supporting and facilitating set of initiators, facilitators and core values under each of the four dimensions. These are nested in layers or orbits, operating at each of the levels of the organization, in which all the elements spiral, are interrelated, interconnected and ultimately become focused on the people who deliver the service-product. <b>The</b> <b>whole</b> <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> illustrated by a quadrant model that is useful for analyzing, thinking, intervening, training and organizing for Service-Ability.|$|E

In a thriller, we're supposed to be scared by some awesome menace to mankind -- the Green Blob maybe, or Big Foot, or the Invincible Squid and his implacable enemy, red wine sauce.

Nitin Chandra commented that [...] "she is confident that the film would pick up gradually, although, apart from Neetu's dance number, it does not have any popular star, but great actors. The first day response during the trial screening was not that great probably because people prefer not too catch the morning show during winter". <b>The</b> <b>whole</b> <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> to release the film in both Hindi and Bhojpuri versions was taken later.
