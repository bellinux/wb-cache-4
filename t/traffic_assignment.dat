40|$|Abstract: This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} using traffic counts to ascertain dynamic origin-destination (OD) tables, when performing dynamic <b>traffic</b> <b>assignments</b> within a <b>traffic</b> window. A family of dynamic OD trip table estimation methods containing two previously unexplored members (single-factor and biproportional) are proposed to solve this problem. The family is tested on a traffic network for the US 45 corridor in Milwaukee, WI. The tests show that dynamic <b>traffic</b> <b>assignments</b> {{can be made to}} match ground counts by a dynamic extension to a technique conceptually similar to Fratar factoring of both origins and destinations from a static OD table. The two methods that directly solve for origin or destination factors have computational and statistical advantages over whole-table dynamic OD trip table estimation procedures. Both methods have results that can be readily interpreted...|$|R

The upper-level model aims to minimize the total travel time under a stochastic demand to design a discrete network. In the lower-level model, demands are assigned to the network through a multiuser <b>traffic</b> equilibrium <b>assignment.</b> Generally, discrete network could affect path selections of demands, while the results of the multiuser <b>traffic</b> equilibrium <b>assignment</b> need to reconstruct a new discrete network. An iterative approach including an improved genetic algorithm and Frank-Wolfe algorithm is used to solve the bi-level model.

40|$|Resilience is a {{characteristic}} that indicates system performance under unusual conditions, recovery speed, {{and the amount}} of outside assistance required for restoration to its original functional state. Resilience is important for daily events, such as vehicle crashes, and more extreme events, such as hurricanes and terrorist attacks. Transportation resilience has ten dimensions: redundancy, diversity, efficiency, autonomous components, strength, collaboration, adaptability, mobility, safety, and the ability to recover quickly. This paper examines the influence of the system optimal and user equilibrium <b>traffic</b> <b>assignments</b> on the last four dimensions. No widely accepted measurement of resilience is available for transportation systems; this paper presents multiple metrics for the four examined contributing components that will aid future development of a single measure of resilience. An application of these measures to a test network found that user equilibrium results in better adaptability and safety while system optimum yields better mobility and faster recovery. ...|$|R

50|$|Kerner {{introduced}} {{an alternative approach}} to <b>traffic</b> <b>assignment</b> based on his network breakdown minimization (BM) principle. Rather than an explicit minimization of travel time that is the objective of System Optimum and User Equilibrium, the BM principle minimizes the probability of the occurrence of congestion in a traffic network. Under sufficient traffic demand, {{the application of the}} BM principle should lead to implicit minimization of travel time in the network.|$|E

The result determines zone-to-zone movements and assigns traffic to networks, and that makes much sense from the way one would imagine the system works - zone-to-zone traffic depends on the resistance occasioned by congestion.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{research}} by Caliper and others {{has led to}} a variety of new and improved methods for calculating user equilibrium <b>traffic</b> <b>assignments.</b> New options provide much faster computing and also the achievement of much tighter convergence, resulting in more accurate impact assessments and select link analysis. Even before any of the improvements discussed below, TransCAD was significantly faster in computing user equilibrium than any other commercial software. We believe that the further improvements have widened TransCAD’s lead in computing speed considerably. Greater speed is needed because of the desire to do larger and more complex problems, and greater accuracy is needed because, without it, there can be large errors in estimates of the impacts of plans and projects. The discussion below purposely limits technical detail so as to be accessible to a wide audience of users and managers, but there are numerous references that provide a full discussion of prior research and the topics discussed.

40|$|The travel {{forecasting}} {{process is}} at the heart of urban transportation planning. Travel forecasting models are used to project future traffic and are the basis for the determination of the need for new road capacity, transit service changes and changes in land use policies and patterns. Travel demand modeling involves a series of mathematical models that attempt to simulate human behavior while traveling. The models are done in a sequence of steps that answer a series of questions about traveler decisions. Attempts are made to simulate all choices that travelers make in response to a given system of highways, transit and policies. Many assumptions need to be made about how people make decisions, the factors they consider and how they react in a particular transportation alternative. The travel simulation process follows trips as they begin at a trip generation zone, move through a network of links and nodes and end at a trip attracting zone. The simulation process is known as the four step process for the four basic models used. These are: trip generation, trip distribution, modal split and <b>traffic</b> <b>assignments.</b> This paper describes the process of the traditional four steps transportation modeling system using a simplified transport network in the context of Dhaka City, Bangladesh...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the introduction of}} side constraints for refining a descriptive or prescriptive <b>traffic</b> equilibrium <b>assignment</b> model, and analyze a general such a model. Side constraints can be introduced for several diverse reasons; we consider three basic ones. First, {{they can be used}} to describe the effects of a traffic control policy. Second, they can be used to improve an existing traffic equilibrium model for a given application by introducing, through them, further information about the traffic flow situation at hand. As such, these two strategies complement the re®nement strategy based on the use of non-separable, and typically asymmetric, travel cost functions. Third, they can be used to describe flow restrictions that a central authority wishes to impose upon the users of the network. We study a general convexly side constrained <b>traffic</b> equilibrium <b>assignment</b> model, and establish several results pertaining to the above described areas of application. First, for the case of prescriptive side constraints that are associated with queueing e€ects, for example those describing signal controls, we establish a characterization of the solutions to the model through a Wardrop user equilibrium principle in terms of generalized travel costs and an equilibrium queueing delay result; in traffic networks with queueing the solutions may therefore be characterized as Wardrop equilibria in terms of well-defined and natural travel costs. Second, we show that the sid...|$|R
50|$|The Kerner-Klenov {{stochastic}} three-phase {{traffic flow}} {{model in the}} framework of Kerner’s theory has further been developed for different applications, in particular to simulate on-ramp metering, speed limit control, dynamic <b>traffic</b> <b>assignment</b> in traffic and transportation networks, traffic at heavy bottlenecks and on moving bottlenecks, features of heterogeneous traffic flow consisting of different vehicles and drivers, jam warning methods, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication for cooperative driving, the performance of self-driving vehicles in mixture traffic flow, traffic breakdown at signals in city traffic, over-saturated city traffic, vehicle fuel consumption in traffic networks (see references in Sec. 1.7 of a review).|$|E
50|$|The BM {{principle}} {{is an alternative}} to well-known principles for vehicular network optimization and control based on the minimization of travel costs (travel time, fuel consumption, etc.) or the maximization of traffic throughput (like the maximization of band width of green wave in a city). In particular, the most prominent classical principles for the minimization of travel costs in a traffic network are Wardrop’s user equilibrium (UE) and system optimum (SO) principles that are widely used in a theory of dynamic <b>traffic</b> <b>assignment</b> in the network. Wardrop's SO and UE principles have been explained in Secs. 7.1 and 7.2 of Wikipedia article traffic flow.|$|E
50|$|The user optimum {{equilibrium}} {{assumes that}} all users {{choose their own}} route towards their destination based on the travel time that will be consumed in different route options. The users will choose the route which requires the least travel time. The user optimum model is often used in simulating the impact on <b>traffic</b> <b>assignment</b> by highway bottlenecks. When the congestion occurs on highway, it will extend the delay time in travelling through the highway and create a longer travel time. Under the user optimum assumption, the users would choose {{to wait until the}} travel time using a certain freeway is equal to the travel time using city streets, and hence equilibrium is reached. This equilibrium is called User Equilibrium, Wardrop Equilibrium or Nash Equilibrium.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Estimating {{traffic volume}} at a link level is {{important}} to transportation planners, traffic engineers, and policy makers. More specifically, this vital parameter {{has been used in}} transportation planning, traffic operations, highway geometric design, pavement design, and resource allocation. However, traditional factor approach, regression-‐based models, and artificial neural network models failed to present network-‐wide traffic volume estimates because they rely on traffic counts for model development, and they all have inherent weaknesses. A review to previous research work and the state-‐of-‐practice clearly indicates that the Traditional Four-step Travel Demand Model (TFTDM) was generally based on large traffic analysis zones (TAZs) and networks consisting of high functional-class roads only. Consequently, this conventional modeling framework yielded a limited number of link <b>traffic</b> <b>assignments</b> with fairly high estimation errors. In the light of these facts and the obvious need of accurate network-wide traffic estimates, this review is conducted. In particular, this paper provides an extensive review of using traditional travel demand models for improved network-‐wide traffic volume estimation. The paper then focuses on the challenges and opportunities in achieving high-fidelity travel demand model (HFTDM). This review has revealed that, opportunities in relation to both technological advances and intelligent data present a substantial potential in developing the proposed HFTDM for a much more accurate traffic estimation at a network-‐wide level. Finally, the paper concludes with key findings from the review and provides a few recommendations for future research related to the topic...|$|R
