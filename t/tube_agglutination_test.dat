Titer of anti-D immunoglobulin preparation {{is an important}} factor to determine the dose of treatment. Many methods are used to evaluate the titer of anti-D immunoglobulin preparation.

To evaluate the BioVue column agglutination test, it was compared to conventional <b>tube</b> <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> using anti-D immunoglobulin preparations from three different producers, ten lots each.

40|$|Five {{serological}} assays: the buffered plate antigen test, {{the standard}} <b>tube</b> <b>agglutination</b> <b>test,</b> the complement fixation test, the hemolysis-in-gel {{test and the}} indirect enzyme immunoassay were diagnostically evaluated. Test data consisted of results from 1208 cattle in brucellosis-free herds, 1578 cattle in reactor herds of unknown infection status and 174 cattle from which Brucella abortus had been cultured. The complement fixation test had the highest specificity in both nonvaccinated and vaccinated cattle. The indirect enzyme immunoassay, if interpreted at a high threshold, also exhibited a high specificity in both groups of cattle. The hemolysis-in-gel test had a very high specificity when used in nonvaccinated cattle but quite a low specificity among vaccinates. With {{the exception of the}} complement fixation test, all tests had high sensitivities if interpreted at the minimum threshold. However, the sensitivities of the standard <b>tube</b> <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> and indirect enzyme immunoassay, when interpreted at high thresholds were comparable to that of the complement fixation test. A kappa statistic was used to measure the agreement between the various tests. In general the kappa statistics were quite low, suggesting that the various tests may detect different antibody isotypes. There was however, good agreement between the buffered plate antigen test and standard <b>tube</b> <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> (the two agglutination tests evaluated) and between the complement fixation test and the indirect enzyme immunoassay when interpreted at a high threshold.

A total of 362 serum samples were obtained from 8 different dog shelters in Üstanbul and Üzmir provinces. The dogs were temporarily kept in these shelters. Of the 362 serum samples, 46 (12. 7 %), 28 (7. 73 %) and 27 (7. 45 %) were found to be positive by TAT, 2 ME-TAT and ELISA, respectively. Dogs in 6 (75 %) out of the 8 kennels were found to be positive for B. canis. The prevalence of seropositive animals were ranged between 5. 26 % and 31. 57 %, 5 % and 17. 54 %, and 2. 12 % and 15. 78 % by TAT, 2 ME-TAT and ELISA tests, respectively. Amongst the 46 sera evaluated as positive by TAT, 18 (39. 1 %) and 19 (41. 3 %) were found to be negative by 2 ME-TAT and ELISA tests, respectively. A 96. 42 % similarity was found between 2 ME-TAT and ELISA results. In conclusion, the <b>tube</b> <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> when used together with additional tests such as 2 ME-TAT and ELISA would be useful in eliminating the false-positive results obtained in serological diagnosis of B. canis infection of dogs.

40|$|Abstract. A {{procedure}} for antibody detection and identification that utilizes affinity microcolumns to isolate IgG antibodies in a gel matrix containing Protein G and Protein A was commercially available in recent years. We evaluated this method (ReACT®, Red Cell Affinity Column Technology, Immucor Co., Norcross, GA) {{as an alternative}} to standard <b>tube</b> <b>agglutination</b> <b>testing,</b> in an effort to minimize subjectivity and increase consistency of antibody identification in our hospital blood banks. Although the ReACT kit was withdrawn from the market soon after completion of our study, the advantages and limitations of the procedure warrant consideration should a similar product be reintroduced. The performance of the ReACT method was compared to conventional antibody detection by a standard <b>tube</b> <b>agglutination</b> technique that uses polyethylene glycol (PEG) potentiator (Dominion Biologicals Ltd., Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, Canada). Of 685 serum or plasma samples that were screened for antibodies, 96 samples were found by the PEG procedure to contain clinically significant (n = 70) and insignificant antibodies (n = 26). In contrast, 48 of the samples were found by the ReACT procedure to contain clinically significant (n = 39) and clinically insignificant antibodies (n = 9). For the ReACT method, the sensitivity was 48. 8 % (95 % CI = 37. 8 %, 58. 0 %) and the specificity was 99. 6 % (95 % CI = 97. 5 %, 99. 9 %), compared to the PEG procedure.
