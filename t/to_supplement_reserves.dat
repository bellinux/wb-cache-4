40|$|With the {{collapse}} of high-profile corporations in Australia such as Cobar Mines, National Textiles Ltd and Ansett Airlines, the Howard Coalition Government in Australia (1996 - 2007) in 2000 established the Employee Entitlements Support Scheme (EESS). EESS was later replaced by the General Employee Entitlements and Redundancy Scheme (GEERS), funded by taxpayers to provide limited protection for employee entitlements {{in the event of}} corporate insolvency. However, the increased level of insolvencies between 2007 and 2009 due to the economic downturn in Australia, placed greater financial pressure on GEERS to provide protection for employees who had lost their jobs and entitlements. As a consequence, the Rudd Government was required <b>to</b> <b>supplement</b> the <b>reserves</b> of GEERS to cope with applications for relief.

40|$|The subject under {{consideration}} is the conception {{and significance of}} special drawing rights and {{the main reason for}} the introduction of the new international monetary unit. Also indicated is the fundamental difference between the drawing rights and the spacial drawing rights. To meet the need as and when it arises for <b>supplement</b> <b>to</b> existing <b>reserve</b> assets the Fund is authorized to allocate special drawing rights to members that are participants in the Special Drawing Account. The new international unit, commonly known as SDR (Special Drawing Rights) or gold paper was introduced in January 1970. It's parity is 0, 88671 g of fine gold, thus equal to the US dollar. It is expressed in dollars but not US dollars. It is issued by the IMF. The grounds for issuing is mutual committance {{of the participants in the}} Special Drawing Account, to use the SDR as a means of payment in international settlement of payments. The introduction of SDR constitutes a further step in demonetization of gold, but does not yet mean its full demonetization. SDR is demonetized gold, despite its parity in gold. Here gold plays the role of a yardstick of international measure of values. The introduction of SDR has positive influence on international liquidity thanks to the possibility for <b>supplement</b> <b>to</b> existing <b>reserve</b> assets. Though reducing it does not however, eliminate all the difficulties of those countries which have a long-standing debit balance of payments.

50|$|On 24 February, the PLA decided <b>to</b> <b>supplement</b> their <b>reserves,</b> the 149th Division, to {{the fight}} against the VPA 316th Division. Chinese efforts now concentrating on cutting off the retreat of the VPA 316th Division, as the PLA 447th Regiment skirted around Mount Phan Xi Pang through the Hoang Lien Son Pass and maneuvered toward the {{direction}} of Bình Lư, which was 44 km west of Sapa. In meantime, the rest of the 149th Division pushed toward Sapa along two roads parallel to Highway 10. Despite showing excellent combat performance, the VPA 316th Division was finally forced to retreat {{due to the lack of}} manpower. At 14:45 on 1 March, Sapa fell to the PLA. On the eastern wing of the offensive, Khoc Tiam succumbed to a night assault raging from 20:00 on 2 March to 14:45 on 3 March. At 19:00 on 3 March, all roads that connected Phong Thổ with Bình Lư and Pa Tần had been under Chinese control. On 4 March, Chinese forces eventually captured the town, thus successfully blocking the supply route to the VPA 316th Division from Lai Châu; the blocking position was at least 40 km from the Sino-Vietnamese border, becoming the deepest Chinese penetration in the war. The 316th Division finally ceased fighting on 5 March. On the same day, the Chinese government announced the withdrawal of troops from Vietnam.|$|R
