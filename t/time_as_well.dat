5|$|The {{rotation}} of PSR B1937+21, {{along with other}} millisecond pulsars discovered later, are very stable in their rotation.

5|$|The season's {{activity}} {{can be quantified}} in an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 61.

5|$|The season's {{activity}} {{was reflected in}} a low cumulative accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 32.

5|$|The season's {{activity}} was reflected {{with a low}} cumulative accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 36.
