As he had in previous elections, he spoke to small groups of children regarding Canadian history or civics. The strategy backfired while addressing children in Port Hope, Ontario. With the children inattentive, some playing tag or sticking cameras in his face, St. Laurent angrily told them that it was their loss {{if they did not}} pay attention, as <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> theirs to worry about far longer than it would be his.|$|E

5|$|The Brazilian {{government}} {{declared that}} <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> neutral in the First World War on 4 August 1914. The sinking of Brazilian merchant ships by German U-boats {{led them to}} revoke their neutrality, then declare war on 26 October 1917. By this time, São Paulo was no longer one of the world's most powerful battleships. Despite an identified need for more modern fire control, {{she had not been}} fitted with any of the advances in that technology that had appeared since her construction, and she was in poor condition. For these reasons the Royal Navy declined a Brazilian offer to send her and Minas Geraes to serve with the Grand Fleet. In an attempt to bring the battleship up to international standards, Brazil sent São Paulo to the United States in June 1918 to receive a full refit. Soon after she departed the naval base in Rio de Janeiro, fourteen of the eighteen boilers powering the dreadnought broke down. The American battleship , which was in the area after transporting the body of the late Uruguayan Minister to the United States to Montevideo, rendered assistance in the form of temporary repairs after the ships put in at Bahia. Escorted by Nebraska and another American ship, , São Paulo made it to the New York Naval Yard after a 42-day journey.|$|E

After this negotiations proceeded between two agents, Cyril Ramaphosa of the ANC, and Roelf Meyer of the National Party.

A date was set for the first democratic elections on 27 April 1994. The ANC won 62.5% of the votes and has been in power ever since.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the CPP taking office, British {{officials}} had prepared a ten-year plan for development. With demands for infrastructure improvements {{coming in from}} all over the colony, Nkrumah approved it in general, but halved the time to five years. The colony was in good financial shape, with reserves from years of cocoa profit held in London, and Nkrumah was able to spend freely. Modern trunk roads were built along the coast and within the interior. The rail system was modernised and expanded. Modern water and sewer systems were installed in most towns, where housing schemes were begun. Construction began on a new harbour at Tema, near Accra, and the existing port, at Takoradi, was expanded. An urgent programme to build and expand schools, from primary to teacher and trade training, was begun. From 1951 to 1956, the number of pupils being educated at the colony's schools rose from 200,000 to 500,000. Nevertheless, the number of graduates being produced was insufficient to the burgeoning civil service's needs, and in 1953, Nkrumah announced that though Africans would be given preference, <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> relying on expatriate European civil servants for several years.|$|E
