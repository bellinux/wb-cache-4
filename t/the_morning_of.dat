5|$|Exact French {{casualties}} {{are difficult}} to calculate, but of the 1,300 aboard Droits de l'Homme, 103 {{are known to have}} died in the battle and just over 300 were saved from the wreck, indicating the deaths of approximately 900men on the French ship between <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>of</b> 14January and <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>of</b> 18January. However, a French source suggests that up to another 500 of the crew were rescued from the wreck by the corvette Arrogante and the cutter Aiguille on 17 and 18 January. This would give a toll of only about 400. A menhir at Plozévet, with an inscription carved in 1840 gives a death toll of six hundred.|$|E
