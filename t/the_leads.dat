5|$|Both <b>the</b> <b>leads,</b> Perkins and Leigh, {{were given}} freedom to {{interpret}} their roles and improvise {{as long as}} it did not involve moving the camera. An example of Perkins' improvisation is Norman's habit of eating candy corn.|$|E
5|$|A non-safety fougasse {{could be}} built by simply burying the {{propelling}} charge behind the fuel drum and running leads through the soil. Instructions for several variants of this design were published but this construction increases the hazard because <b>the</b> <b>leads</b> {{would have to be}} left exposed on the surface and any electrical current applied could, theoretically, ignite the charge. Also, underground moisture could also easily ruin the charge {{over an extended period of}} time.|$|E
5|$|Electrical {{stimulation}} of the dorsal columns of the spinal cord can produce analgesia. First, <b>the</b> <b>leads</b> are implanted, guided by fluoroscopy and feedback from the patient, and the generator is worn externally for several days to assess efficacy. If pain is reduced by more than half, the therapy is deemed to be suitable. A small pocket is cut into the tissue beneath {{the skin of the}} upper buttocks, chest wall or abdomen and <b>the</b> <b>leads</b> are threaded under the skin from the stimulation site to the pocket, where they are attached to the snugly fitting generator. It seems to be more helpful with neuropathic and ischemic pain than nociceptive pain, but current evidence is too weak to recommend its use in the treatment of cancer pain.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: A {{miniature}} electro-mechanical {{linear actuator}} where <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> nut {{is part of}} <b>the</b> motor. <b>The</b> <b>lead</b> screw does not rotate, so as <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> nut is rotated by <b>the</b> motor, <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> screw is extended or retracted.|$|R
5000|$|In {{bluegrass}} music, {{the melody}} line is called <b>the</b> <b>lead.</b> Tenor is sung an interval {{of a third}} above <b>the</b> <b>lead.</b> Baritone is <b>the</b> fifth of the scale that has <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> as a tonic, and may be sung below <b>the</b> <b>lead,</b> or even above <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> (and <b>the</b> tenor), in which case it is called [...] "high baritone." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{count is}} the same as for the non-shadow two-step. The {{follower}} uses the same footwork as <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> in this case, beginning on the left foot. <b>The</b> <b>lead</b> propels <b>the</b> follower down the floor, with bodies touching or close together, as though <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> were <b>the</b> follower's shadow. The pair will normally turn and weave, and <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> may turn <b>the</b> follower before returning to standard position. <b>The</b> <b>lead</b> may also bring the follower behind him/her, giving the appearance of having swapped roles but with <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> still in control, and <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> may then bring the follower back in front.|$|R
5|$|The casting of {{low-profile}} actors aided {{in keeping}} the production budget low by avoiding the larger salaries attached to stars. To prepare for the role and create a believable friendship between <b>the</b> <b>leads,</b> Brown, Cooper, and Mann were sent to Disneyland together and spent a weekend in a cabin at Big Bear City, California.|$|E
5|$|The film won several awards {{on release}} {{including}} Best Film award at Maharashtra State Film Awards, MICTA, and 11th Pune International Film Festival. It {{is also the}} first Marathi film to have a home media release in Blu-ray. With the success of Kaksparsh, a Hindi and Tamil remake of Kaksparsh is also being directed by Mahesh Manjrekar with Arvind Swamy and Tisca Chopra as <b>the</b> <b>leads.</b>|$|E
5|$|The second {{adaptation}} of the Ronggeng Dukuh Paruk trilogy, Sang Penari required two years of research to better present the historical context, including the 30 September Movement and ensuing anti-communist actions; these details, censored in the original trilogy by the New Order government, were more explicit than in the novels. Although the film was set and shot in Purwokerto, Central Java, neither of <b>the</b> <b>leads</b> was ethnic Javanese. Nasution, cast in her debut role, is Batak, while Antara is Balinese.|$|E
50|$|Keselowski retook <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> on lap 91, {{and held}} <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> until <b>the</b> second caution {{of the race}} on lap 113, caused by debris. Keselowski lost <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> during <b>the</b> pit cycle; he was beaten out of the pits by Kyle Busch, but Larson had stayed out and assumed <b>the</b> <b>lead.</b> Larson led <b>the</b> field to the restart on lap 119, holding <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> until lap 127, when Matt Kenseth took <b>the</b> <b>lead.</b> On lap 139, Keselowski {{returned}} to <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> of <b>the</b> race, and maintained his position until the third caution period of the race, due to debris on the backstretch on lap 152. Joey Logano took <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> during <b>the</b> pit stops, but lost <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> to Clint Bowyer at the restart on lap 158. Keselowski retook <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> on lap 176, just as another debris caution was called for. Keselowski maintained his <b>lead</b> for <b>the</b> next stint of the race, before the caution flag was flown again, on lap 211.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Lead</b> has to {{communicate}} {{the direction of the}} movement to the Follow. Traditionally, <b>the</b> <b>Lead's</b> right hand is on the follow's back, near the lowest part of the shoulder-blade. This is the strongest part of the back and <b>the</b> <b>Lead</b> can easily pull the Follow's body inwards. To enable <b>the</b> <b>Lead</b> {{to communicate}} a step forward (backward for the Follow) the Follow has to constantly put a little weight against <b>the</b> <b>Lead's</b> right hand. When <b>the</b> <b>Lead</b> goes forward, <b>the</b> Follow will naturally go backwards.|$|R
50|$|The race {{restarted}} on lap 60. A {{number of}} cars began hitting pit road around lap 77. Kevin Harvick surrendered <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> to pit on lap 83 and handed <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> to Matt Kenseth. He pitted on lap 85 and handed <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> to Brad Keselowski. He ducked onto pit road the next lap and gave <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> to Kyle Larson. He pitted on lap 88 and handed <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> to Joey Logano. He ran out of fuel on lap 95 and hit pit road. This gave <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> to Danica Patrick. She pitted on lap 97 and <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> cycled back to teammate Harvick.|$|R
5|$|A true sequel series, {{tentatively}} titled IRIS 2, {{was originally}} announced for October 2011. At {{the time of}} announcement, pre-production was underway and reports estimated filming on the sequel was expected to commence in March 2011. Representatives from Taewon Productions stated in April 2010 that they expected original stars Lee Byung-hun, Kim Tae-hee, and Kim So-yeon to be cast in the sequel. Later, {{just prior to the}} finale of Athena being broadcast, lead producer Chung Tae-won confirmed that he anticipated IRIS 2 to be in production in time for a fall 2012 premiere. Concurrently, it was reported that the proposed series remained in pre-production with the scriptwriters in the process of crafting the story. Chung also revealed that no casting decisions had been made and that the writing staff were preparing two potential versions of the series as a result—one featuring the full original cast and another that would see the return of only a select few. <b>The</b> <b>leads</b> of the original series, Lee Byung-hun and Kim Tae-hee, were officially confirmed to ultimately not be reprising their roles for the sequel on August 24, 2012.|$|E
5|$|After filming was {{completed}} in 1996 the commissioning network ITV shelved it for a year. It was eventually scheduled for broadcast {{on the evening of}} 30 March 1997, as part of the network's Comedy Premieres strand, but overrunning sports coverage delayed it for an hour. Ratings were low and critical reviews were minimal, but positive; critics enjoyed the comedy drama format and praised the writing and performances of <b>the</b> <b>leads.</b> Harries entered Cold Feet in the Montreux Television Festival, where it was awarded the Rose d'Or, the festival's top prize, resulting in ITV quickly scheduling a repeat broadcast. At {{the end of the year}} it won the award for Best Comedy Drama (ITV) at the British Comedy Awards and the incoming director of channels ordered a full series, which ran for five successful years from 1998 to 2003.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of commissioning, Douglas Henshall and Daniel Craig were {{considered}} for the parts of Brown and Blair respectively, though David Morrissey and Michael Sheen were eventually announced as <b>the</b> <b>leads</b> in March 2003. Morrissey gained two stone for his role and had his hair permed and dyed. He researched Brown's background by travelling to Kirkcaldy—where Brown grew up—and reviewing numerous biographies and information about the Treasury. In comparison to his preparation for the BBC thriller State of Play, Morrissey discovered that no politicians wanted {{to help him with}} his research, so he turned to journalists Jon Snow and Simon Hoggart. Director Stephen Frears was unfamiliar with his previous work and had to be convinced by other production staff to cast him.|$|E
50|$|A traveling-nut linear {{actuator}} has a motor that stays attached to {{one end of}} <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> screw (perhaps indirectly through a gear box), the motor spins <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> screw, and <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> nut is restrained from spinning so it travels up and down <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> screw.|$|R
50|$|Gordon {{surrendered}} <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> next lap to pit. Brad Keselowski assumed <b>the</b> <b>lead.</b>|$|R
50|$|The race {{restarted}} on lap 31, before {{debris in}} turn 2 {{brought out the}} fourth caution of the race on lap 37. Johnson elected to come onto pit road during the caution and Logano retook <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> for <b>the</b> restart, on lap 41. Logano held <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> for <b>the</b> next portion of the race, before Gordon took <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> on lap 57, {{with the help of}} the lapped car of Yeley. Gordon and Logano swapped <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> over <b>the</b> next couple of laps, before Gordon maintained <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> until his next pit stop, on lap 64. He handed <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> over to teammate Dale Earnhardt, Jr. who kept <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> until lap 69, when he pitted and handed <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> to teammate Johnson. Johnson pitted on lap 77 and handed <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> back to Newman; Johnson rejoined the circuit a lap down in 25th place. Newman pitted on lap 79 and handed <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> back to Gordon. During this stint at the front - at the end of the 92nd lap - Gordon recorded his 1,000th lap led at Michigan races.|$|R
5|$|During the film's production, four of <b>the</b> <b>leads</b> became romantically involved. Bachchan married Bhaduri {{four months}} before filming started. This led to {{shooting}} delays when Bhaduri became pregnant with their daughter Shweta. By {{the time of the}} film's release, she was pregnant with their son Abhishek. Dharmendra had begun wooing Malini during their earlier film Seeta Aur Geeta (1972), and used the location shoot of Sholay to further pursue her. During their romantic scenes, Dharmendra would often pay the light boys to spoil the shot, thereby ensuring many retakes and allowing him {{to spend more time with}} her. The couple married five years after the film's release.|$|E
5|$|Following the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the mid-16th century, Henry VIII {{sold it to}} Sir William Sharington for £783, who {{demolished}} {{the abbey}} church and converted the abbey into a house, starting work in about 1539. So {{as not to be}} incommoded by villagers passing close to his residence, he is said to have sold the church bells and used the proceeds to erect a bridge over the River Ray for their convenience. Few other alterations were made to the monastic buildings themselves: the cloisters, for example, still stand below the living accommodation. About 1550, Sir William added an octagonal tower containing two small chambers, one above the other; the lower one was reached through the main rooms, and was for storing and viewing his treasures; the upper one, for banqueting, was only accessible by walking across <b>the</b> <b>leads</b> of the roof. In each chamber is a central octagonal stone table, carved with up-to-date Renaissance ornament. A mid-16th century stone conduit house stands over the spring from which water was conducted to the house. Further additions were made over the centuries, and the house now has various grand reception rooms.|$|E
5|$|Ibira {{initially}} pictured Karas as {{a horror}} {{story with a}} vengeance theme. It had a simple plot similar to the manga, Dororo. The protagonist karas is on a quest, slaughtering mikuras to recover the body parts of his murdered lover. Until he recovers all the parts, he assembles them into a katana to kill the mikuras. The final version of Karas {{was more of a}} superhero action story, and originally intended for three leading heroes in the same vein as the Japanese period drama, Sanbiki ga Kiru!. The characters Otoha, Nue, and the human detective Kure were <b>the</b> <b>leads</b> but the final version primarily focused on Otoha. The presentation of Karas differs in several ways from typical anime. The show maintains a serious tone and never indulges in slapstick, exaggerated facial expressions, or super deformed characters. It avoids heavy expositions. Dialogue tends to be short and viewers have to infer what is going on based on very little presented information. The team had left out substantial amounts of information from the show, printing them in a booklet of the final DVD package.|$|E
50|$|The {{race was}} {{scheduled}} to start at 1:19 p.m. Eastern time, but started {{a few minutes later}} with Kevin Harvick leading the field to the green flag, but he ceded <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> to Jeff Gordon on lap two. Due to overnight downpours, a competition caution came out on lap 21. Joey Logano stayed out when the others pitted and assumed <b>the</b> <b>lead,</b> leading <b>the</b> field to the restart on lap 26. Kasey Kahne took <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> from Logano on lap 33 while Paul Menard brushed the wall in turn 3 after being bumped by Juan Pablo Montoya. However, Kahne gave up <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> on lap 39 to pit, with Kyle Larson assuming <b>the</b> <b>lead,</b> handing <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> to Austin Dillon after pitting on lap 44. Dillon made his stop and handed <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> to Denny Hamlin the next lap. Hamlin made his stop on lap 55 and handed <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> back to Kevin Harvick. Gordon retook <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> from Harvick on lap 66 and then both ducked onto pit road. Hamlin retook <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> as a result.|$|R
500|$|The race {{began at}} 2:41p.m. [...] Jarrett passed Gilliland almost {{immediately}} to <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> first lap, but lost <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> to Jeff Gordon a lap later. Jamie McMurray passed Gordon for <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> on lap 4; by this time, Gilliland had fallen back to 30th {{after losing the}} draft. Three laps later Gordon regained <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> from McMurray, with drafting assistance from Vickers. On lap 18 McMurray reclaimed <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> from Gordon, and they exchanged <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> again two laps later. On lap 24 McMurray reclaimed <b>the</b> <b>lead,</b> and Kenny Wallace made a pit stop with his car smoking.|$|R
50|$|A {{player who}} wins <b>the</b> <b>lead,</b> by winning a trick to which another player led, {{is subject to}} the {{following}} restriction. As long as the player retains <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> and has any cards left in the suit in which he or she won <b>the</b> <b>lead,</b> <b>the</b> player must play cards of that suit. After that, as long as the player retains <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> and has any cards of the suit in which the previous player won <b>the</b> <b>lead,</b> <b>the</b> player must play cards in that suit.|$|R
5|$|In 1940 Hitchcock transitioned to Hollywood productions, {{the first}} of which was the {{psychological}} thriller Rebecca starring Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine. He received his first nomination for the Academy Award for Best Director, and the film won Best Picture. Hitchcock worked with Fontaine again the following year on the film Suspicion which also starred Cary Grant. In 1943 Hitchcock directed another psychological thriller Shadow of a Doubt which starred Teresa Wright and Joseph Cotten. Three years later he reunited with Grant on Notorious which also starred Ingrid Bergman. The film included a three-minute intermittent kissing scene between <b>the</b> <b>leads</b> shot specifically to skirt the Motion Picture Production Code which at the time limited such scenes to three seconds. In 1948 Hitchcock directed Rope which starred James Stewart. The film was his first in Technicolor and is remembered for its use of long takes to make the film appear to be a single continuous shot. Three years later he directed Strangers on a Train (1951).|$|E
5|$|The Wedding Day {{was started}} as his third play, {{but it was}} not {{finished}} until years later and finally brought out on both the stage and in print after his theatrical career ended. After Fielding returned to London from the University of Leyden during the end of 1729, he brought with him a version of The Wedding-Day. It was refused by John Rich to be staged, and it was not produced until 1743 by David Garrick. The only information on the origins of this play come from Fielding's preface to the play in his Miscellanies (1743). In it, Fielding says that he intended <b>the</b> <b>leads,</b> Millamour and Charlotte, for Robert Wilks and Anne Oldfield. However, Oldfield died before the play could be produced, and Fielding and Wilks got into a fight, which made it impossible for Fielding to convince him to join the production.|$|E
5|$|The {{department}} continues investigating {{leads into}} the Adena Watson case, including an interrogation {{of a man}} who lived {{within walking distance of the}} scene and was previously charged with murdering a 14-year-old girl. All of <b>the</b> <b>leads</b> turn into dead ends. While investigating the Adena Watson scene, police find coagulated blood and hair on a piece of metal. Battel witnesses the find, but agrees to hold the information until police authorize it, as long as she gets the story first. She also tells Bayliss about a carry-out store owner who claims to know who the murderer is. The episode ends with an emotional Bayliss attending Watson's funeral.|$|E
50|$|The race {{restarted}} on lap 88. It {{settled into}} a green run that {{was interrupted by a}} cycle of green flag stops beginning on lap 125. Truex pitted from <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> following lap. Keselowski pitted from <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> next lap. Ty Dillon pitted from <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> on lap 129 and handed <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> to Michael McDowell. Truex passed McDowell in Turn 1 to cycle back to <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> on lap 131. Kyle Busch was handed a pass through penalty for speeding on pit road.|$|R
50|$|Another {{round of}} green flag stops took place with 62 to go. Truex pitted from <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> with 61 to go. Jimmie Johnson pitted from <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> with 60 to go. Logano held <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> for 15 laps before pitting with 45 {{to go and}} Harvick cycled to <b>the</b> <b>lead.</b>|$|R
50|$|The race {{restarted}} on lap 30. Kurt Busch {{went ahead}} of Logano in turn 3 and took <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> on lap 31. Teammate Kevin Harvick passed him in turn 1 to take <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> on lap 51. Martin Truex Jr. took <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> on lap 58. He hit pit road on lap 79 to pit. This handed <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> to Brad Keselowski. He just about missed pit road trying {{to enter and}} handed <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> to Matt Kenseth. He ducked onto pit road on lap 82 and handed <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> to rookie teammate Erik Jones. <b>The</b> <b>lead</b> cycled back to Martin Truex Jr. on lap 84. Michael McDowell was tagged for speeding and served a drive-through penalty.|$|R
5|$|The ice-skating {{scenes were}} filmed at Wollman Rink in Central Park, {{requiring}} the rink to {{close to the}} public for three consecutive days. Some scenes with <b>the</b> <b>leads</b> were also shot at Cafe Lalo, the same restaurant where When Harry Met Sally (1989) was shot. The film was also shot at the Rockfeller Center. The producers had earlier scouted for a public bridge in India that they could use for four days, but due to the 2008 Mumbai attacks obtaining permission from a local government was difficult. The search ended in Kuala Lumpur, where a scene of Kiara and Akash attempting suicide was shot. The opening suicide attempt sequence was filmed at the Golden Gate Bridge. Several scenes were shot in Nevada, Las Vegas. Additional filming was done in Malaysia and Thailand.|$|E
5|$|The male lead of Rockstar {{is played}} by Ranbir Kapoor, with whom Eros International worked {{previously}} on Anjaana Anjaani. His role of Jordan is loosely based on Imtiaz Ali's Jat friend, {{who lived in a}} small settlement in Pitam Pura. He had seen Kareena Kapoor's performance in his Jab We Met and wanted to cast her in the film. However, the script required some romantic scenes between <b>the</b> <b>leads.</b> As Ranbir and Kareena happened to be cousins, this was touted as a problem. Moreover, the filmmakers did not want to replace Ranbir with any other actor as the character he portrayed was reportedly suitable only for him. They then made a joint decision to replace Kapoor with Nargis Fakhri, after initially approaching Sonam Kapoor and Diana Penty for the replacement. Voice actor Mona Ghosh Shetty dubbed for Fakhri. The film marked Shammi Kapoor's last appearance in a feature film; he died on 14 August 2011.|$|E
5|$|Their {{first son}} {{died at the}} age of two, but the Gouldens had ten other children; Emmeline was the eldest of five daughters. The {{youngest}} was Eva Gertrude Goulden. Soon after her birth the family moved to Seedley in Pendleton on the outskirts of Salford, where her father had co-founded a small business. Goulden was active in local politics, serving for several years on the Salford Town Council. He was also an enthusiastic supporter of dramatic organisations including the Manchester Athenaeum and the Dramatic Reading Society. He owned a theatre in Salford for several years, where he played <b>the</b> <b>leads</b> in several plays by William Shakespeare. Pankhurst absorbed an appreciation of drama and theatrics from her father, which she used later in social activism.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>lead</b> {{architect}} of i960 was superscalarity specialist Fred Pollack {{who was also}} <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> engineer of Intel iAPX 432 and <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> {{architect of}} <b>the</b> i686 chip Pentium Pro.|$|R
50|$|The race {{restarted}} on lap 34. Truex passed Edwards exiting turn 4 to take <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> on lap 60. A {{number of}} cars began pitting under green on lap 73. Truex gave up <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> to pit on lap 74 and handed <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> to Matt Kenseth. He pitted the next lap and handed <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> to Chase Elliott, who was also making his pit stop. <b>The</b> <b>lead</b> cycled back to Truex.|$|R
50|$|The race {{restarted}} on lap 48. Green flag stops {{started on}} lap 83. Kenseth pitted from <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> on lap 87 {{and handed it}} to Joey Logano.
