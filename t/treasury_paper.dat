Spinner {{has been}} {{credited}} with finding {{the solution to the}} shortage of coinage: he created postage currency (which led into the use of Fractional currency). Postage (or postal) currency was the first of five issues of US Post Office fractional paper money printed in 5-cent, 10-cent, 25-cent, and 50-cent denominations and issued from 21 August 1862 through 27 May 1863. Spinner proposed using postage stamps, affixed to <b>Treasury</b> <b>paper,</b> with his signature on the bottom (see illustration below). Based on this initiative, Congress supported a temporary solution involving fractional currency and on 17 July 1862 President Lincoln signed the Postage Currency Bill into law. The intent, however, was not that stamps should be a circulating currency.|$|E
6000|$|... [FN#17] About {{the classic}} [...] "Harrah," [...] I shall {{have more to}} say at a future time. The word [...] "Ria" [...] in {{literary}} and in vulgar Arabic is almost synonymous with Akabah, a steep descent, a path between hills or a mountain road. [FN#18] Valleys may be divided into three kinds. 1. Longitudinal, i.e. parallel to the axis of their ridges; 2. Transversal or perpendicular to the same; and, 3. Diagonal, which form an acute or an obtuse angle with the main chain of mountains. [FN#19] This act, by the bye, I afterwards learned to be a greater act of imprudence than the sleeping alone. Nothing renders the Arab thief so active as the chance of stealing a good weapon. [FN#20] Probably, because water is usually found in such places. In the wild parts of the country, wells are generally protected by some fortified building, for men consider themselves safe from an enemy until their supply of water is cut off. [FN#22] Near Al-Hamra, {{at the base of}} the Southern hills, within fire of the forts, there is a fine spring of sweet water. All such fountains are much prized by the people, who call them [...] "Rock-water," [...] and attribute to them tonic and digestive virtues. [FN#23] As far as I could discover, the reason of the ruinous state of the country at present is the effect of the old Wahhabi and Egyptian wars in the early part of the present century, and the misrule of the Turks. In Arabia the depopulation of a village or a district is not to be remedied, as in other countries, by an influx of strangers; the land still belongs to the survivors of the tribe, and trespass would be visited with a bloody revenge. [FN#24] Without these forts the Turks, at least so said my companions, could never hold the country against the Badawin. There is a little amour propre in the assertion, but upon the whole it is true. There are no Mohammed Alis, Jazzars, and Ibrahim Pachas in these days. [FN#25] To [...] "halal" [...] is to kill an animal according to Moslem rites: a word is wanted to express the act, and we cannot do better than to borrow it from the people to whom the practice belongs. [FN#26] He is now dead, and has been succeeded by a son worse than himself. [FN#27] The greatest of all its errors was that of appointing to the provinces, instead of the single Pasha of the olden time, three different governors, civil, military, and fiscal, all depending upon the supreme council at Constantinople. Thus each province has three plunderers instead of one, and its affairs are referred to a body that can take no interest in it. [FN#28] Ziyad bin Abihi was sent by Al-Mu'awiyah, the Caliph, to reform Al-Basrah, a den of thieves; he made a speech, noticed that he meant to rule with the sword, and advised all offenders to leave the city. The inhabitants were forbidden under pain of death to appear in the streets after evening prayers, and dispositions were made to secure the execution of the penalty. Two hundred persons were put to death by the patrol during the first night, only five during the second, and not a drop of blood was shed afterwards. By similar severity, the French put an end to assassination at Naples, and the Austrians at Leghorn. We may deplore the necessity of having recourse to such means, but it is a silly practice to salve the wound which requires the knife. [FN#29] These remarks were written in 1853: I see no reason to change them in 1878. [FN#30] A weak monarch, a degenerate government, a state whose corruption is evidenced by moral decay, a revenue bolstered up by a system of <b>treasury</b> <b>paper,</b> which even the public offices discount at from three to six per cent., an army accustomed to be beaten, and disorganised provinces; these, together with the proceedings of a ruthless and advancing enemy, form the points of comparison between the Constantinople of the present day and the Byzantine metropolis eight hundred years ago. Fate has marked upon the Ottoman Empire in Europe [...] "delenda est": we are now witnessing the efforts of human energy and ingenuity to avert or to evade the fiat. [FN#31] When water cannot be obtained for ablution before prayers, Moslems clap the palms of their hands upon the sand, and draw them down the face and both fore-arms. This operation, which is performed once or twice-it varies in different schools-is called Tayammum. [FN#32] I write this word as my companions pronounced it. Burckhardt similarly gives it [...] "Djedeyde," [...] and Ali Bey [...] "Djideïda." [...] Giovanni Finati wrongly calls the place [...] "Jedeed Bughaz," [...] which Mr. Bankes, his editor, rightly translates the [...] "new opening or pass." [...] [FN#33] Al-Khayf is a common name for places in this part of Arabia. The word literally means a declivity or a place built upon a declivity. [FN#34] Bughaz means in Turkish the fauces, the throat, and signifies also here a gorge, or a mountain pass. It is the word now commonly used in Al-Hijaz for the classical [...] "Nakb," [...] or [...] "Mazik." [...] Vincent (Periplus) errs in deriving the word from the Italian [...] "Bocca." [...] [FN#35] Giovanni Finati, who was present at this hard-fought field as a soldier in Tussun's army, gives a lively description of the disastrous [...] "day of Jadaydah" [...] in vol. i. of his work. [FN#36] This Abdullah, Pasha of Damascus, led the caravan in A.D. 1756. When the Shaykhs of the Harb tribe came to receive their black-mail, he cut off their heads, and sent the trophies to Stambul. During the next season the Harb were paralysed by the blow, but in the third year they levied 80,000 men, attacked the caravan, pillaged it, and slew every Turk that fell into their hands.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the case}} of the Second World War, the U.S. {{government}} took similar measures in increasing its control over the economy. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor provided the spark needed to begin conversion to a wartime economy. With this attack, Washington felt that a greater bureaucracy was needed to help with mobilization. The government raised taxes which paid for half of the war’s costs and borrowed money in the form of war bonds to cover the rest of the bill. “Commercial institutions like banks also bought billions of dollars of bonds and other <b>treasury</b> <b>paper,</b> holding more than $24 billion at the war’s end." [...] The creation of a handful of agencies helped funnel resources towards the war effort. One prominent agency was the War Productions board (WPB), which “awarded defense contracts, allocated scarce resources - such as rubber, copper, and oil - for military uses, and persuaded businesses to convert to military production." [...] Two-thirds of the American economy had been integrated into the war effort by the end of 1943. Because of this massive cooperation between government and private entities, {{it could be argued that}} the economic measures enacted prior to and during the Second World War helped lead the Allies to victory.|$|E

40|$|Motivated by Karacaoglu's <b>treasury</b> <b>paper</b> {{concerning}} the sustainability and equity of capital, {{as well as}} by Piketty's research suggesting that income inequality will increase if no action is taken to remedy it, we search for a way to reduce inequality while maintaining economic efficiency. Using a developed economic model with evolutions for debt, consumption, capital and relative factor share, which proxies inequality, we look at how tax rates on capital income and labour income can constrain all the quantities above within set bounds. We solve this problem through the mathematics of viability theory and use a program called VIKAASA to solve and display our results in terms of viability kernels. The results tell us that taxation, especially capital taxation, is a powerful tool for reducing inequality. While this taxation usually diminishes consumption and capital, we show that for some economic conditions, these decreases can be negligible. The kernels also tell us how a policy maker should react in a variety of economic situations, including high debt and high capital stocks...|$|E

2500|$|In 1949, 1950 and 1951 the Royal Mint {{produced}} sovereigns, {{but instead}} of preparing new dies with George VI's head and with the correct date, they re-issued George V sovereigns dated 1925. A total of 886,000 [...] "backdated" [...] coins (restrikes) were minted.Production resumed in 1957, ostensibly to prevent the coin being counterfeited in Syria and Italy. Subsequent publication of <b>treasury</b> <b>papers</b> appear to indicate that sovereigns were widely used in pursuance of British {{foreign policy in the}} Middle East, and it was felt that the coin could not be allowed to fall into disrepute, as many individuals were receiving payments in the form of sovereigns for services rendered to the British government.|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} five years since the {{publication}} of the <b>Treasury</b> <b>paper</b> that first set out its Living Standards Framework (LSF) (Treasury 2011). Since then, the LSF has become an increasingly central part of Treasury’s strategic direction. Treasury is now explicit about its aspiration to be “working towards higher living standards for New Zealanders” (Treasury 2015 a), and the LSF itself has been used across a wide range of Treasury’s policy advising work (Treasury 2015 c). But after five years of implementation and development, there remain questions about what exactly the LSF is and how it ought to, or could be, used by Treasury. The aim {{of this paper is to}} provide answers to these sorts of questions. It is intended as an update of Treasury’s 2011 paper, drawing on the rapid developments in the academic and policy literature on wellbeing in the last five years. We argue that the LSF can be understood as a wellbeing framework that articulates, justifies and helps enable the provision of comprehensive economic policy advice that improves wellbeing. The remainder of this introduction clarifies the main claims we will be advancing in this paper...|$|E
40|$|I {{note that}} the Committee {{acknowledged}} unanimously {{that the majority of}} the Government's economic policy settings are sound. This is a significant endorsement of the Government's management of the economy. In this context, the Committee noted some concerns about the level of household saving and recommended that the Government give appropriate attention to this issue. More specifically, the Committee was concerned about the decline in the household saving ratio and the increase in Australian household debt in nominal terms in recent years. A recent <b>Treasury</b> <b>paper,</b> The Measurement of Saving in Australia, noted that the significant decline in the ABS net household saving ratio since the mid- 1970 s may reflect some measurement and classification limitations and it is important to take this into account when examining saving issues. I have attached a copy of this paper for your information. The Committee noted that in nominal terms and as a percentage of household disposable income the aggregate debt of Australian households has grown over recent years. However, this growth in the indebtedness of Australian households should be seen in the context that historically Australian households have carried relatively little debt by international standards and that the recent increase has brought Australia more into line with other developed countries...|$|E
50|$|Though {{his friends}} were not limited to one {{political}} party, he himself espoused the whig cause with great warmth, and received the reward of his constancy. Among the <b>treasury</b> <b>papers</b> in the Record Office (vol. iii. No. 10) is a copy of an indenture whereby Dartiquenave and another acquired ‘the office of keeper of Hampton Park, Bushey Park, and the Mansion House of Hampton Court during the lifetime of the Duchess of Cleveland,’ but this was obtained by purchase. Political merits gave him from 1706 to 1726 the post of paymaster of the royal works, and his salary in 1709 was {{at the rate of}} 6s. 6d. a day, but in 1717 he pleaded for an addition of 200l. per annum, and the lords of the treasury sanctioned the increase from Michaelmas 1717 (Calendars of <b>Treasury</b> <b>Papers,</b> 1708-19). He was gazetted surveyor-general of the king's gardens in June 1726, and in March 1731 it was understood that he should be promoted to be surveyor of his majesty's private roads. It has often been erroneously stated that Dartiquenave was actually appointed to the surveyorship of George II's private roads. But the latter office was conferred on 15 May 1731 on Richard Arundel, M.P. for , who held the post till his appointment as master of the mint in 1737, when Thomas Ripley became surveyor of roads. Dartiquenave lived as became his position, about the court, in the outquarters of St. James's Palace, but on his death (19 October 1737) he was buried on 26 October in the church of Albury, Hertfordshire, where a slab in the church was placed to his memory.|$|R

40|$|Many {{past and}} {{potential}} New Zealand reforms involve significant devolution, i. e. {{the transfer of}} authority to make decisions on behalf of society from a higher to {{a lower level of}} government.
