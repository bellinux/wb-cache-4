The storyline was introduced {{just over a year}} after Gordon's partner, Chris Burkhardt, died from acute myeloid leukemia at the age of 23. Gordon drew on her experience with Burkhardt to take on the storyline. Home and Away's producer, Cameron Welsh, approached Gordon about the storyline and asked her if she would be comfortable doing it. Gordon called it an [...] "amazing opportunity to be given". Gordon said [...] "The producer asked me if I wanted to do this storyline and made sure I was comfortable doing it based on what I had been through, I definitely think this one tops all of them". Gordon added that anyone going through Martha's ordeal would find it hard, but [...] "you just look <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>friends</b> and family and do your best in that situation and then move on".|$|E

With Shawn Michaels beginning a four-year retirement after a WWF World Heavyweight Championship loss and back injury, Triple H was now the leader of D-Generation X (DX). He said he was forming a DX army and [...] "when you start an army, you look to your blood... you look to your buddies... you look <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>friends...</b> you look to The Kliq."

[...] Former National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger also blamed the Soviet Union, saying, [...] "Whatever the details of the current invasion of Zaire, {{it is clear that the}} attack took place across a sovereign border from a country in which the government was installed by Soviet arms and the military personnel of a Soviet client state. It could not have taken place—and it could not continue—without the material support or acquiescence of the Soviet Union—whether or not Cuban troops are present." [...] China concurred, provoking unpleasantness with Soviet ambassadors in Beijing and later calling the FNLC invasion [...] "a new offensive drive in the Soviet Union's political and military aggression in Africa".|$|E
2500|$|Game Revolution's Brian Gee {{awarded the}} game a C+. He wrote, [...] "It's {{easy to tell}} what the {{developers}} focused on, because The Bouncer is obviously one of the best-looking games on a console to date. Near flawless animations and picture perfect visuals make it a great choice {{to show off the}} sleek Sony super machine <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>friends.</b> Once the game begins, though, The Bouncer sheds it's [...] pretty boy image and gets down and dirty." [...] He was critical of the controls and the absence of a lock-on feature. Like other critics, he also had problems with the camera and the ratio of cutscenes to gameplay. He concluded [...] "Though many will undoubtedly be disappointed by The Bouncers inability {{to live up to the}} hype, others will find a fancy beat 'em up to pass a few hours. Its flashy graphics are at least worth taking a look at, but its many problems just might keep it from a place in the collection." ...|$|E
2500|$|This creates further problems, {{as it is}} {{even more}} crucial to 'save face' after one's {{relationship}} has been broken when one is connected to new media technologies. Erving Goffman argues that all social life boils down to face-to-face interactions. These interpersonal interactions are mediated by what Goffman terms as [...] "face-work", which are the actions undertaken to maintain consistency with one's face, and to uphold the expressive order of social situations. Individuals attempt to keep a positive image of the self when interacting with others, and in order to do so, they may have to alter their appearance or manner in some way. Such face-work can also be seen in new technologies, especially social media websites such as Facebook. If someone breaks up with you, you can actively choose what [...] "face" [...] you want to present <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>friends,</b> including your ex. You can choose to either post sad updates, which is the most natural thing you would want to do, or you can [...] "save face" [...] by posting happy updates and pictures of you going out with your friends. Even though you may be absolutely heartbroken within, Facebook allows you to hide your true feelings from the online world, and from your ex, by manipulating your profile. New media is being utilized as a tool for helping users present a desirable image of themselves, enabling them to save face in difficult situations. Nearly 35% of respondents in a study admitted to using their Facebook status to make someone think that they had plans, even if they did not.|$|E

2500|$|In 1997, {{shortly after}} the Boston Globe {{disclosed}} that Bulger and Flemmi had been informants, Weeks met with retired agent John Connolly (later sentenced to 40 years in prison), who showed him a photocopy of Bulger's FBI informant file. In order to explain Bulger and Flemmi's status as informants, Connolly said, [...] "The Mafia was going against Jimmy and Stevie, so Jimmy and Stevie went against them." [...] According to Weeks, [...] "As I read over the files at the Top of the Hub that night, Connolly kept telling me that 90 percent of {{the information in the}} files came from Stevie. Certainly Jimmy hadn't been around the Mafia the way Stevie had. But, Connolly told me, he had to put Jimmy's name on the files to keep his file active. As long as Jimmy was an active informant, Connolly said, he could justify meeting with Jimmy and giving him valuable information. Even after he retired, Connolly still had friends in the FBI, and he and Jimmy kept meeting to let each other know what was going on. I listened to all that, but now I understood that even though he was retired, Connolly was still getting information, as well as money, from Jimmy. As I continued to read, I could see {{that a lot of the}} reports were not just against the Italians. There were more and more names of Polish and Irish guys, of people we had done business with, of friends of mine. Whenever I came across the name of someone I knew, I would read exactly what it said about that person. I would see, over and over again, that some of these people had been arrested for crimes that were mentioned in these reports. It didn't take long for me to realize that it had been bullshit when Connolly told me that the files hadn't been disseminated, that they had been for his own personal use. He had been an employee of the FBI. He hadn't worked for himself. If there was some investigation going on and his supervisor said, 'Let me take a look at that,' what was Connolly going to do? He had to give it up. And he obviously had. I thought about what Jimmy had always said, 'You can lie to your wife and to your girlfriends, but not <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>friends.</b> Not to anyone we're in business with.' Maybe Jimmy and Stevie hadn't lied to me. But they sure hadn't been telling me everything." ...|$|E
