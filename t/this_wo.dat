Currently deployed heuristic-based approaches to caching are not ideal, and prior results show potential for better reuse of cached Web content. This work studies a more deterministic approach to caching of Web objects where Web servers supply more complete information to client caches about the objects served. The idea is to view container (HTML) objects {{as a collection of}} distinct objects with heterogeneous change characteristics. Relationships between these and embedded objects (images) can be exploited at the server side. Servers can generate cache invalidation information and piggyback it onto existing request/response traffic. The results indicate that these techniques can improve existing cache management strategies.

The latter two problems have to be solved for planar graphs and segments on the unit sphere, rather than in the two-dimensional plane.

40|$|Abductive {{reasoning}} (or explanation) {{is basically}} a backward-chaining process on a collection of causal rules. When given an observed event, we attempt to determine the set of causes which brought about this event. Cost-based abduction is a model for abductive reasoning which provides a concrete formulation of the explanation process. However, it restricts itself to acyclic causal knowledge bases. The existence of cyclicity results in anamolous behavior by the model. For example, assume in our knowledge base that A can cause B and B can cause A. When faced with having to explain the occurrence of A, we could postulate B. Now, since A already exists, we can use it the explain B. Our backward-chaining process to find an explanation can certainly fall into this trap. In this paper, we present a new model called generalized cost-based abduction for general causal knowledge bases. Furthermore, we provide an approach for solving this model by using linear constraint satisfaction. 1 <b>This</b> <b>wo</b> [...] ...|$|E

INTRODUCTION In multimedia systems the musical media is essentially based on pre-recorded audio, which can be played by the listener without modification. Recently, a growing interest has been demonstrated in the field of expressiveness control of audio performances [1],[2] and mathematical and perceptual models have been proposed which compute the deviations of some musical parameters in order to add the desired expressive intentions to a neutral performance [3]. These models usually decides their action on the base of a symbolic description of the performance and give the result in term of deviations of parameters of the same description.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} to identifying and eliminating mislabeled training samples. The goal of this technique is to decrease the error of classification algorithms by improving the quality of the training data. The approach employs an ensemble of classifiers that serve as a filter for the training data. Using an n-fold cross validation, the training data is passed through the filter. Only samples that the filter classifies correctly are passed to the final classification algorithm. An empirical evaluation of the approach on the task of automated land cover mapping illustrates that the ensemble filter approach is an effective method for identifying labeling errors. INTRODUCTION Current information and data related to global land cover is poor and labeling errors in land cover maps arise from a multitude of sources including lack of consistency in the vegetation classification used, variable measurement techniques, and variation in the spatial sampling resolution [1]. <b>This</b> <b>wo</b> [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Although {{a single}} {{diagnostic}} label, conduct disorder, is currently applied to children exhibiting antisocial behaviour, multiple routes {{to the same}} behavioural phenomena exist. Morton and Frith's (1995) causal modelling has been fundamentally important in influencing models of cognitive/affective and associated neural differences between callous-unemotional (CU) and reactive/threat-based antisocial behaviour. Current behavioural genetic research is still catching up with the developmental cognitive neuroscience, and very few genetically informative studies differentiate between these two subtypes of antisocial behaviour. Our own work with preadolescent twins suggests that while the CU subtype is genetically vulnerable to antisocial behaviour, the non-CU subtype manifests a primarily environmental aetiology to their antisocial behaviour. Molecular genetic work to date has not differentiated between these two subtypes, and we highlight why it might {{be of interest to}} do so. Finally, we discuss how the novel approach of imaging genetics could be harnessed to study genes to cognition pathways for different subtypes of conduct disorder.

40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version {{is available from the}} publisher via the DOI in this record. Three-dimensional polymer nanofibrous mats with tunable wettability have been fabricated using a single step non-conductive template assisted electrospinning process. Cellulose acetate nanofibers are electrospun over a nylon mesh, which acts as thetemplate. The as-deposited fiber mat is removed from this template to produce a free standing three-dimensional micropatterned nanofi-brous mat. By simply varying the template mesh dimensions, the fraction of the air-liquid interface can be changed which allows controlof the wetting mechanics. It is shown that the water contact angle can be varied from about 308 for a planar network to about 1408 for apatterned mat implying a complete transition from hydrophilic to hydrophobic behavior. Furthermore, upon stretching the fiber matloses its pattern irreversibly and reducing the contact angle from 1408 to 1108 with increasing stretching.

Important: all the found relations have a common nature of the “power of t wo”. The exact nature of this remains unknown for yet, so it requires further resea rch. The presented material may also be viewed as a logical continuation and development of Dirac’s and Edding- ton’s Large Numbers Hypothesis (LNH).
