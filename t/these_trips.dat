5|$|Defining {{themselves}} as both Swedish and American, the Swedish-American community retained a fascination {{for the old}} country {{and their relationship to}} it. The nostalgic visits to Sweden which had begun in the 1870s continued well into the 20th century, and narratives from <b>these</b> <b>trips</b> formed a staple of the lively Swedish-American publishing companies. The accounts testify to complex feelings, but each contingent of American travellers were freshly indignant at Swedish class pride and Swedish disrespect for women. It was with renewed pride in American culture that they returned to the Midwest.|$|E

40|$|Inukai Tsuyoshi (1855 - 1932) was a {{politician}} {{famous for his}} strong promotion of constitutionalism in modern Japan. He was also well known as a major supporter of Sun Yat-sen (1866 - 1925), {{the leader of the}} Chinese Nationalist Party, during Sun’s exile in Japan. Inukai went to China in 1911 - 1912 to help Sun Yat-sen during the 1911 Revolution, and visited again in 1929 to attend the inauguration of the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum. <b>These</b> two <b>trips</b> are often mentioned in studies on Inukai in discussions of his relationship with the Revolutionists. Despite the focus on <b>these</b> two <b>trips,</b> there is no academic discussion of two earlier trips, the fi rst in 1903, and the second from 1907 - 1908. This paper collected original historical records to reconstruct <b>these</b> two <b>trips</b> before the revolution. It focuses on Inukai’s reasons for the trips and the relationship he forged with Chinese offi cials during these tours. I shall discuss how <b>these</b> two <b>trips</b> changed Inukai’s views on China and infl uenced his move for the approval of a constitutional movement during the late Qing period...|$|R

5|$|During the Anglo-Saxon period, many shrines {{were built}} on former pagan sites which became popular pilgrimage destinations, while other pilgrims visited {{prominent}} monasteries and sites of learning. Senior nobles or kings would travel to Rome, {{which was a}} popular destination from the 7th century onwards; sometimes <b>these</b> <b>trips</b> were a form of convenient political exile. Under the Normans, religious institutions with important shrines, such as Glastonbury, Canterbury and Winchester, promoted themselves as pilgrimage destinations, maximising {{the value of the}} historic miracles associated with the sites. Accumulating relics became an important task for ambitious institutions, as these were believed to hold curative powers and lent status to the site. Indeed, by the 12th century reports of posthumous miracles by local saints were becoming increasing common in England, adding to the attractiveness of pilgrimages to prominent relics.|$|E

An evening eastbound trip was also extended to Stamford with only the Bridgeport intermediate stop. This trip was intended to allow commuters to reach employment centers in Bridgeport and Stamford without having to make a transfer at New Haven. On June 24, 2002, additional Stamford trains were added, {{for a total of}} two westbound and three eastbound trains.

5|$|While {{attending}} Columbia, Beebe persuaded his {{professors to}} sponsor him and several fellow students taking research trips to Nova Scotia, where {{he continued his}} hobby of collecting, as well as attempting to photograph difficult-to-observe scenes of birds and other animals. Several of Beebe's photographs from these expeditions were purchased by Columbia professors to use as slides during their lectures. During <b>these</b> <b>trips</b> Beebe also developed an interest in dredging, the practice of using nets to haul up animals that lived deep underwater, and attempting to study them before they died or disintegrated. Beebe never applied to receive a degree from Columbia, although years later he was granted honorary doctorates from both Tufts and Colgate University.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, several {{military}} expeditions sent by Spanish colonists from coastal California traveled into the Central Valley. One of <b>these</b> <b>trips,</b> headed by lieutenant Gabriel Moraga, {{arrived on the}} south bank of the Merced River on September 29, 1806. They named the river Rio de Nuestra Señora de la Merced (River of Our Lady of Mercy), who is {{the patron saint of}} the diocese of Barcelona and is celebrated on September 24. Another expedition to the Central Valley in 1805 also named the Kings River upon reaching it on January 6, 1805, which is the feast of the Magi or Epiphany. Moraga's expedition was part of a series of exploratory ventures, funded by the Spanish government, to find suitable sites for missions in the Central Valley and the Sierra Nevada foothills. In 1808 and 1810, Moraga led further expeditions along the lower Merced River below Merced Canyon, each time coming to nothing. Eventually, plans to establish a mission chain in the Valley were abandoned. In 1855, Merced County was created, named after the Merced River.|$|E
5|$|The {{protectorate}} status had {{a negative}} effect on the island's trade with Tahiti. Ships from Rurutu, as from other protectorates, were considered foreign vessels at the ports of France and its overseas territories such as the Tahitian port capital of Papeete, Rurutu's nearest significant trading partner. Consequently, Rurutu's agricultural exports were subject to tariffs from which the exports of annexed territories were exempted. The economic disadvantages of the protectorate status became even more evident when France closed the Tahitian ports to all foreigners in 1899, including merchants from Rurutu, in response to an outbreak of bubonic plague in San Francisco. This disruption of trade between the two islands occurred in a period during which Rurutu became increasingly reliant economically on Tahiti. The growing prominence of Tahiti was evidenced in the activities of Teuruarii, who regularly visited Papeete for trade and entertainment. Teuruarii incurred much debt during <b>these</b> <b>trips,</b> and the need to pay off his creditors along with the restriction on trade prompted him to consider formal annexation to France.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1938, the Kingdom of Hungary, {{under the}} regency of Miklós Horthy, passed {{a series of}} anti-Jewish {{measures}} modeled on the so-called Nuremberg Race Laws enacted in Germany by the Nazis in 1935. Like their German counterparts, the Hungarian laws focused heavily on restricting Jews from certain professions, {{reducing the number of}} Jews in government and public service jobs, and prohibiting intermarriage. Because of this, Wallenberg's business associate, Kalman Lauer, found it increasingly difficult to travel to his native Hungary, which was moving still deeper into the German orbit, becoming a member of the Axis powers in November 1940 and later joining the Nazi-led invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941. Out of necessity Wallenberg became Lauer's personal representative, traveling to Hungary to conduct business on Lauer's behalf and also to look in on members of Lauer's extended family who remained in Budapest. He soon learned to speak Hungarian, and from 1941 made increasingly frequent travels to Budapest. Within a year, Wallenberg was a joint owner and the International Director of the company. In this capacity Wallenberg also made several business trips to Germany and Occupied-France {{during the early years of}} World War II. It was during <b>these</b> <b>trips</b> that Wallenberg was able to closely observe the Nazis' bureaucratic and administrative methods, knowledge which would prove quite valuable to him later.|$|E

30|$|In {{the first}} step, the trip demand Ti is {{generated}} for each origin {{based on the}} population and specific <b>trip</b> rate factors. <b>These</b> <b>trip</b> rate factors are distinguished by year and by country under consideration of four trip purposes and eight age groups.

For the forecast years and for the policy scenarios trip rate factors are dependent on changes of the explanatory variables GDP, employment, and income level. PAD is therefore sensitive to economic and demographic changes.|$|R
