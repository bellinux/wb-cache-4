5|$|A {{creation}} date {{at the beginning}} of the second millennium BCE places the relief into a region and <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the political situation was unsteady, marked by the waxing and waning influence of the city states of Isin and Larsa, an invasion by the Elamites, and finally the conquest by Hammurabi in the unification in the Babylonian empire in 1762BCE.|$|E

5|$|The war pitted a {{reformed}} Austrian army against {{a collection of}} French veterans and conscripts. With major engagements of the war lasting from April to July 1809, Napoleon achieved the quick victory that characterised his previous campaigns. However, the War of the Fifth Coalition would also mark the last <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> Napoleon and the French Empire would emerge as decisive victors.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Thornton {{performed}} occupation duties with Jayforce, in Japan, {{where he}} was the Senior British Liaison Officer in the Tokyo sub-area. He returned to New Zealand in July 1946 to serve as a staff officer at Army Headquarters. In 1948 he commenced a two-year term as Deputy Chief of Staff and during this time he worked towards the implementation of a compulsory military training scheme for the Territorial Force, which commenced in May 1950. He was dispatched to England in 1952 to attend the Imperial Defence College after which he led the New Zealand Joint Services Liaison Staff in London. During this <b>time,</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> New Zealand's military affairs were dominated by the country's involvement in the Korean War, Thornton began to demonstrate the diplomatic skills that would prove useful during his later career.|$|E
5|$|Having {{traveled}} to France {{in the early}} 1920s, Gordon Balfour, the nephew of John Balfour, (who {{was one of the}} co-founders of Balfours Bakery), found inspiration for the frog cake in European confectionery. The frog cake was introduced by Balfours in 1922 after Gordon's return to Adelaide, during a <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> tearooms were still popular in the city. It soon became known as the Balfours mascot, and has traditionally only been sold in South Australia, although they are now sold in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland as well.|$|E

5|$|Irenaeus' eschatology {{was based}} on a literal {{interpretation}} of the Bible, especially the Book of Revelation. He believed that there would be 6000 years of suffering before the world ends in a fiery purge. This fire would purify believers ahead of a new human community existing in the New Jerusalem. The afterlife, Irenaeus proposed, focuses more on time than space; he looked forward to a <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> humans are fully developed and live the life of God.|$|E
5|$|Neither side made a {{substitution}} at half time. In the 56th minute, Cesc Fàbregas – who had {{a bicycle}} kick saved by Lloris – set up Diego Costa, whose shot from {{the left of the}} area deflected off Tottenham right-back Kyle Walker and into the net to double Chelsea's advantage. After conceding their second goal, Tottenham made a series of attacking substitutions – Andros Townsend, Ryan Mason and Chadli made way for Mousa Dembélé, Érik Lamela and Roberto Soldado respectively – but could not change the score. In the 74th minute, Dier's knee caught César Azpilicueta, drawing blood; the Chelsea left-back left the pitch to be bandaged and returned two minutes later. There were four minutes of added <b>time,</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> Chelsea substituted Costa for Didier Drogba.|$|E

Almost all of Harrison's first-choice names signed on immediately, while a day spent boating with Memphis musician Don Nix resulted in the latter agreeing to organise a group of backing singers. A local Indian astrologer had advised early August as a good <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> to stage the concert, and as things transpired, the 1st of that month, a Sunday, was the only day that Madison Square Garden was available at such short notice.|$|E
5|$|On 11 January 2015, Totti {{scored two}} goals against local rivals Lazio, {{making him the}} joint all-time top scorer in the Rome Derby in {{official}} club competitions, alongside Dino Da Costa, with 11 goals, {{as well as the}} Serie A top scorer in the Rome Derby. On 9 May, Totti scored from a penalty in a 2–1 away defeat to Milan, equalling Roberto Baggio for the record of the most goals scored in Serie A from penalties (68). On 31 May, in the final match-day of the 2014–15 season, he scored his 299th goal for Roma in a 2–1 home defeat to Palermo. Totti finished the season as Roma's leading scorer with ten goals in all competitions, the seventh <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> he had been the team's top scorer.|$|E
5|$|Pilot whales {{have one}} of the longest birth {{intervals}} of the cetaceans, calving once every three to five years. Most matings and calvings occur during the summer for long-finned pilot whales. For short-finned pilot whales of the Southern Hemisphere, births are at their highest in spring and autumn, while in Northern Hemisphere, the <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> calving peaks can vary by population. For long-finned pilot whales, gestation lasts 12–16 months, and short-finned pilot whales have a 15-month gestation period.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{the bombing}} of the Presidential Palace, North Vietnamese General Văn Tiến Dũng and his field commanders had been {{discussing}} the possibility of deploying units of the Vietnam People's Air Force (VPAF), to attack high-value South Vietnamese targets in support of North Vietnamese ground troops. Use of the Soviet MiG-17 fighter was considered, North Vietnamese pilots already had significant combat experience with the type. However, moving MiGs from their bases in North Vietnam was problematic; South Vietnamese defenses were falling much faster than anticipated, there was simply little <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> to deploy the MiGs in support of North Vietnamese units encircling Saigon. As the North Vietnamese had captured a large number of U.S.-made aircraft from the Republic of Vietnam Air Force at Pleiku and Da Nang Air Bases, it was decided to use captured aircraft instead.|$|E
5|$|Taboo Tuesday (2004) was a {{professional}} wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) and presented by AT which took place on October 19, 2004 at the Bradley Center in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. It was the first annual Taboo Tuesday event, marking the first <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the fans were {{given the chance to}} vote on stipulations for the matches. The voting for the event started on October 18, 2004 and ended during the event. Eight professional wrestling matches were featured on the event's card. The buildup to the matches and the scenarios that took place before, during, and after the event were planned by WWE's script writers. The event starred wrestlers from the Raw brand: a storyline expansion of the promotion where employees are assigned to a wrestling brand under the WWE banner.|$|E
5|$|The Diet was {{initially}} dominated by Polish nobles, but in time, it saw {{the emergence of}} a strong peasant faction. Another notable change over time included {{the emergence of a}} Ruthenian (modern Ukrainian) bloc, changing the balance of power within the body. Overall, the Diet preserved the Polish parliamentary tradition during a <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> it waned in the Prussian Partition and the Russian Partition, and saw the emergence of the major political parties and groupings that were to dominate the political life of the Second Polish Republic after World War I. The leader of the Polish peasant movement in the Second Polish Republic, Wincenty Witos, gained his experience in the Diet, elected {{for the first time in}} 1908. Similarly, the National Democrats, and the Polish socialists, had their political blocs in the diet around that time.|$|E

5|$|The Fifth Ward Wardroom is {{historically}} significant {{as a historical}} reminder of the pivotal <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> Pawtucket was incorporated as a city and gave up its town-meeting form of governance. The building is also architecturally significant as a rare type of building, wardrooms, {{and is one of}} three extant examples in Rhode Island. William R. Walker & Son constructed three such structures in Pawtucket with the First Ward Wardroom being extant and the third example having been demolished. Though both constructed by William R. Walker & Son, the two Pawtucket wardrooms are related, but not identical in construction and show variations by the firm. Another wardroom, with a bungalow style, is located in the Cato Hill Historic District in Woonsocket, Rhode Island. The Fifth Ward Wardroom was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.|$|E
5|$|The governor's {{relationship}} with the General Assembly has typically been the determining factor in his success at enacting his agenda, although other factors also play an important role. In most of Indiana's history, the governor has come to power at a <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> his party controlled the assembly. Since the political parties first became dominant in 1831 and until 2010, thirty-three sessions of the legislature have been divided with different parties controlling the House and Senate. Only five sessions have occurred where the legislature was entirely controlled by the opposition party, while in ninety-eight sessions the governor's party controlled the entire assembly.|$|E
5|$|The length <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> {{offspring}} {{stay with}} their mother varies, though it can last until the female's next calving. Likewise, calves may suckle for only a month or {{as long as a}} year. Females become sexually mature when they are four years old, while males become mature at four or five years. Spermatogenesis in male giraffes begins at three to four years of age. Males must wait until they are at least seven years old to gain the opportunity to mate.|$|E
