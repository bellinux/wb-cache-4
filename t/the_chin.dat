5|$|The headdress is {{a variant}} of the {{truncated}} or bee-hive hennin, then fashionable at the Burgundian court. A very similar style, with no tail, is seen on the older of two girls in the donor panels of Presentation of Christ by the Master of the Prado Adoration of the Magi, a pupil of Rogier van der Weyden. The black band under <b>the</b> <b>chin</b> is rarely found in other images from the period, and has been interpreted as a style borrowed from the male chaperon hat, which always has a long tailing tail or cornette, sometimes worn wrapped under <b>the</b> <b>chin</b> in this way.|$|E
5|$|Burnside {{was noted}} for his unusual facial hair, joining strips of hair {{in front of}} his ears to his {{mustache}} but with <b>the</b> <b>chin</b> clean-shaven; the word burnsides was coined to describe this style. The syllables were later reversed to give sideburns.|$|E

5|$|Although ill-equipped {{and having}} {{received}} little training, Dalforce {{was sent to}} the northwestern front where they fought against Japanese landing parties during the battles of Sarimbun Beach and Kranji. Despite their efforts, Singapore fell to the Japanese {{a few days after the}} invasion, and the Japanese army moved in to occupy <b>the</b> <b>Chin</b> Kang Huay Kuan. After the Japanese surrender on September 1945, Chin Kang Huay Kuan resumed its normal activities of running welfare programmes for needy clan members and organising cultural events.|$|E
5|$|Four {{anatomic}} features must {{be present}} for orotracheal intubation to be straightforward: adequate mouth opening (full {{range of motion}} of the temporomandibular joint), sufficient pharyngeal space (determined by examining {{the back of the}} mouth), sufficient submandibular space (distance between the thyroid cartilage and <b>the</b> <b>chin,</b> the space into which the tongue must be displaced in order for the larygoscopist to view the glottis), and adequate extension of the cervical spine at the atlanto-occipital joint. If any of these variables is in any way compromised, intubation should be expected to be difficult.|$|E

5|$|The camas {{pocket gopher}} is, {{by a small}} margin, the largest member of its genus (Thomomys). The fur is a dull brown above and dark, leaden gray beneath. There are often patches of white on <b>the</b> <b>chin,</b> throat and around the anus, and it has blackish ear and nose markings. The {{external}} ear is a thickened rim of tissue. During the summer, the gopher's coat is short and coarse; winter pelage is longer and furrier. The coat of the young {{is similar to the}} adult summer coat, but with more sparsely distributed fur; the abdominal skin may be visible.|$|E
5|$|The {{front of}} the head of the female in {{breeding}} plumage is yellow, gradually changing to olive green {{at the back of the}} head, except for the broad yellow rear brow, while the area between the eye and the bill is dark greenish grey, and the area around the ear is green. The head is surrounded by a broad yellow collar that includes <b>the</b> <b>chin.</b> The remainder of the female breeding plumage is identical to the male's.|$|E
5|$|The {{head has}} {{a less than}} {{triangular}} shape with a blunt and rounded snout. Still, the head is much wider than the neck. The rostral scale is small. The circumorbital ring consists of 10–16 scales. Across {{the top of the}} head, there are 7–11 interocular scales. 3–4 scales separate the suboculars and the supralabials. There are 12–17 supralabials and 13–17 sublabials. The first 3–4 sublabials contact <b>the</b> <b>chin</b> shields, of which there is only one pair. Often, there are two fangs on each maxilla and both can be functional.|$|E

5|$|The skin of E. rabborum was {{granular}} in {{texture and}} predominantly a mottled brown. The upper {{surfaces of the}} limbs was also mottled brown while the rear surfaces of the thighs were a pale yellow. <b>The</b> <b>chin</b> and upper chest was distinctively brown, though {{the rest of the}} underside of the body was mostly white speckled with irregular brown spots. The eyelids and upper surfaces of the limbs and back were studded with green flecks, the appearance and positions of which could be changed by the animal voluntarily (metachrosis). The irises of the eyes was uniformly reddish brown.|$|E
5|$|The soft coat is reddish to golden brown, {{in sharp}} {{contrast}} with the white ventral parts. A brown band runs across the chest, and a distinct rufous collar can be observed on the neck. <b>The</b> <b>chin</b> and the medial surfaces of the legs are also white. The face is characterised by large, round dark brown eyes, small translucent ears, a slim muzzle, and a large grayish pink rhinarium.|$|E
5|$|Black {{began the}} 1946 Cleveland Indians {{season as a}} member of the roster, looking to get playing time in an {{established}} starting rotation. His season began inauspiciously when he was hit on <b>the</b> <b>chin</b> with a ball, causing him to miss a week during spring training. The 1946 season marked the first time that Black did not finish on the major league roster. After pitching in 18 games for the Indians, he was sent to the Milwaukee Brewers of the American Association. While with the Brewers, Black failed to win any games, and at one point was suspended after he disappeared during a road trip. At the conclusion of the season, Indians owner Bill Veeck had a talk with Black, who admitted he had a problem with drunkenness. He agreed to spend the winter with Alcoholics Anonymous with Veek's help, and by the time the 1947 Cleveland Indians season began, Black was sober.|$|E

50|$|In 1985, Chin, {{who had run}} {{the day-to-day}} operations, sold the rights to her name and her {{restaurants}} to General Mills. <b>Chin</b> regained <b>the</b> ownership of her business in 1988. By <b>the</b> time <b>Chin</b> left <b>the</b> business in the late 1990s, <b>the</b> Leeann <b>Chin</b> chain had become a Chinese fast food operation. Smaller take-out locations were set up inside Byerly's grocery stores. Chin retired in 1999. <b>The</b> Leeann <b>Chin</b> chain now had more than 40 locations, mostly in the Minneapolis - Saint Paul area, as of 2010.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Tha <b>Chin</b> river {{has many}} {{regional}} names. After it splits from Chao Phraya river at Chai Nat, {{it is called}} Makham Thao River; while passing Suphan Buri it is the Suphan River; while passing Nakhon Pathom it becomes the Nakhon Chai Si river. Only near its mouth at Samut Sakhon does it become <b>the</b> Tha <b>Chin</b> River, named after the former name of Samut Sakhon. <b>The</b> name Tha <b>Chin</b> is <b>the</b> convention used in most scientific documents.|$|R
5|$|It is a small, mouse-like rodent. It {{differs from}} the very similar eastern voalavo mainly in some measurements, such as a greater tail length. It also resembles small species of Eliurus, but the fur is darker {{and there is no}} tail tuft. The fur is soft, short, and thick, and appears dark gray on most of the upperparts, but more {{brownish}} on the sides. On the back, the cover hairs, which form {{the main part of the}} fur, are three-colored: most of the hair is gray, followed by a narrow light buff band and a black tip. The longer guard hairs are black. The fur of the underparts is not different in overall color, but the individual hairs are gray for about three quarters of their length and white at the tips, except for those at <b>the</b> <b>chin,</b> which are white throughout.|$|E
5|$|Later, John and Tom {{get drunk}} {{and decide to}} kill Brandon. Lana {{attempts}} to stop them, but the pair drive to Candace's remote house where they find Brandon, who has been hiding in a nearby shed. John shoots Brandon under <b>the</b> <b>chin,</b> killing him instantly. Tom shoots Candace in the head as Lana fights with them, begging them to stop. Tom stabs Brandon's lifeless body and tries to shoot Lana but John stops him. John and Tom flee the scene while a crying Lana lies with Brandon's body. The next morning, Lana awakens next to Brandon's corpse. Her mother arrives and takes {{her away from the}} scene. As Lana leaves Falls City, a letter Brandon wrote to her is heard in a voiceover.|$|E
5|$|Males {{appear to}} reach {{maturity}} at around 45–50mm, at between 9 and 12 months, {{and at this}} size begin to develop a grey to brownish yellow wash beneath <b>the</b> <b>chin.</b> This indicates {{the development of a}} vocal sac and thus an ability to commence calling behaviour. Females reach sexual maturity at two years; those smaller than 65mm are not seen in amplexus; this length is not reached until the second season after metamorphosis. The frog is not of a type that only breeds once. Females can shed up to 26% of their weight when spawning, while males have also been seen to lose weight during breeding, because they are eating less. The weight lost during the breeding season is typically regained from January to September.|$|E

5|$|Ritual {{scarification}} in Nri {{was known}} as Ichi {{of which there are}} two styles; the Nri style, and the Agbaja style. In the Nri style, the carved line ran {{from the center of the}} forehead down to <b>the</b> <b>chin.</b> A second line ran across the face, from the right cheek to the left. This was repeated to obtain a pattern meant to imitate the rays of the sun. In the Agbaja style, circles and semicircular patterns are added to the initial incisions to represent the moon. These scarifications were given to the representatives of the eze Nri; the mbùríchi. The scarification's were Nri's way of honoring the sun that they worshiped and was a form of ritual purification.|$|E
5|$|The Bodyline {{controversy}} {{continued into}} the 1933 season. Bodyline tactics were used in several matches, including by the West Indian tourists in the second Test. In all first-class cricket, Hammond, no longer vice-captain of Gloucestershire, scored 3,323 runs, passing 3,000 in a season for the first time. With an average of 67.81, he topped the first-class tables for {{what would be the}} first of eight successive seasons. He also took 38 wickets. However, his highest score in three Test innings was 34. In the second Test, unsettled by Bodyline, Hammond was cut on <b>the</b> <b>chin</b> by a short ball, causing him to retire hurt. He again commented that he would quit rather than face such bowling; soon after his return, he was out. Les Ames, who played in the three-match series, won by England 2–0, believed that the West Indian pacemen worried Hammond, who showed a weakness against short, fast bowling.|$|E
5|$|The Fiji parrotfinch {{is a small}} finch, 10cm (4in) in length. The {{adult male}} has a bright green body and wings, red head, and scarlet rump and tail. The blackish {{feathering}} of <b>the</b> <b>chin</b> becomes dark blue on the lower throat and turquoise on the upper breast before fading into the green of the underparts. The stubby bill is blackish-grey, the eyes are reddish-brown and the legs and feet are pinkish-brown. The female {{is very similar to}} the male, but possibly slightly duller and with paler flanks. Young birds have a dark-tipped yellow bill and sometimes a bluish face which gradually turns red, {{but the rest of the}} plumage is like the adult. Full mature plumage is achieved at about 20 months. Some rare individuals of this parrotfinch have the entire head and face blue, apparently due to a natural mutation.|$|E
5000|$|Some historians (Arthur Phayre, Tun Nyein) put Pateikkaya {{in eastern}} Bengal, thus placing <b>the</b> entire <b>Chin</b> Hills under Pagan {{suzerainty}} but others, like Harvey, citing stone inscriptions, put it near <b>the</b> eastern <b>Chin</b> Hills. (Burmese Chronicles report {{the kings of}} Pateikkaya as Indian though the ethnicity of the subjects is not explicitly cited.) ...|$|R
50|$|Upon {{independence}} in 1947, {{the government of}} India used the Johnson Line {{as the basis for}} its official boundary in the west, which included <b>the</b> Aksai <b>Chin.</b> From <b>the</b> Karakoram Pass (which is not under dispute), the Indian claim line extends northeast of the Karakoram Mountains through the salt flats of <b>the</b> Aksai <b>Chin,</b> to set a boundary at the Kunlun Mountains, and incorporating part of the Karakash River and Yarkand River watersheds. From there, it runs east along the Kunlun Mountains, before turning southwest through <b>the</b> Aksai <b>Chin</b> salt flats, through the Karakoram Mountains, and then to Panggong Lake.|$|R
