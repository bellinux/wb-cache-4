40|$|Research was {{conducted}} to assess {{the effects of the}} type of zone heater and floor mat used in a wean-to-finish facility on pig performance and operating cost. Gas-fired brooder heaters were compared to 250 W heat lamps and farm-cut wood sheathing was compared to commercial (unheated) rubber floor mats for a 21 -day post-weaning period. There was no effect of heating system or mat type on pig performance, either during the 21 - day period immediately post-weaning or to slaughter. Black globe temperatures near the pig zone were slightly higher for the propane-fired heaters compared to the heat lamps, most likely due to the method and temperature settings used to control the gas flow to the heaters. Black globe temperatures were slightly higher for the wood mats versus the rubber mats, most likely due to the difference in infrared energy absorption between the black mats and the natural wood colored mats. When amortized over a seven-year payback period, <b>total</b> <b>operating</b> <b>expense</b> for the heat lamps and propane brooders was estimated to be similar based on 25 pigs per pen and 20 pens per propane control module. These results suggest that both types of heating systems are effective in maintaining an acceptable temperature zone for weaned pigs. They also suggest little difference in performance due to the type of floor mat under the zone heating device. The selection of heating system and floor mat material can be based on reasons other than pig performance...|$|R
40|$|Content {{delivery}} networks (CDNs) are {{an important}} class of Internet-scale distributed systems that deliver web, streaming, and application content to end users. A commercial CDN could comprise {{hundreds of thousands of}} servers deployed in over thousand clusters across the globe and incurs significant energy costs for powering and cooling their servers. Since energy costs are a significant component of the <b>total</b> <b>operating</b> <b>expense</b> of a CDN, we propose and explore a novel technique called cluster shutdown that turns off an entire cluster of servers of a CDN that is deployed within a data center. By doing so, cluster shutdown saves not just the power consumed by the servers but also the power needed for cooling those servers. We present an algorithm for cluster shutdown that is based on realistic power models for servers and cooling equipment and can be implemented {{as a part of the}} global load balancer of a CDN. We evaluate our technique using extensive real-world traces from a large commercial CDN to show that cluster shutdown can reduce the system-wide energy usage by 67 %. Further, much of the energy savings are obtainable without sacrificing either bandwidth costs or end-user performance. In addition, 79 % of the optimal savings are attainable even if each cluster is limited to at most one shutdown per day, reducing the required operational overhead. Finally, we argue that cluster shutdown has intrinsic architectural advantages over the well-studied server shutdown techniques in the CDN context, and show that it saves more energy than server shutdown in a wide range of operating regimes...|$|R

This research uses Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) methods with production function item as the measurement tools for Islamic banking efficiency level on BUS and UUS in Indonesian. Results of this SFA method appears in numeric score 0 - 1 form, the closer the result with score 1, the more Islamic banking approaches the perfect efficiency level. Input variables in this research are total deposits of third parties, <b>total</b> other <b>operating</b> <b>expenses,</b> and employee or labor cost. The output variable is total financing as the main product of Islamic banking. Variables were chosen based on intermediation approach. The independent sample t-test is used to find out the difference of efficiency level between each group of bank (BUS and UUS). The results of this research using SFA method shows that Islamic banking efficiency is increasing in every period between 2010 - 2013. The average efficiency on BUS and UUS respectively are 0, 90098 and 0, 901823. This suggests that UUS in Indonesian better than BUS during 2010 - 2013.

40|$|Thousands of call centers {{operate in}} the United States {{employing}} millions of people. Since personnel costs represent as much as 80 % of the <b>total</b> <b>operating</b> <b>expense</b> of these centers, {{it is important for}} call center managers to determine an appropriate staffing level required to maintain the desired operating performance. Historically, queueing models serve an important role in this regard. The one most commonly used is the Erlang-C model. The Erlang-C model has several assumptions, however, which are required for the predicted performance measures to be valid. One assumption that has received significant attention from researchers is that callers have infinite patience and will not terminate a call until the service is complete regardless of the wait time. Since this assumption is not likely to occur in reality, researchers have suggested using Erlang-A instead. Erlang-A does consider caller patience and allows for calls to be abandoned prior to receiving service. However, the use of Erlang-A still requires an assumption that is very unlikely to occur in practice - the assumption that all agents provide service at the same rate. Discrete event simulation is used {{to examine the effects of}} agent heterogeneity on the operating performance of a call center compared to the theoretical performance measures obtained from Erlang-A. Based on the simulation results, it is concluded that variability in agent service rate does not materially affect call center performance except to the extent that the variability changes the average handle time of the call center weighted by the number of calls handled and not weighted by agent. This is true regardless of call center size, the degree of agent heterogeneity, and the distribution shape of agent variability. The implication for researchers is that it is unnecessary to search for an analytic solution to relax the Erlang-A assumption that agents provide service at the same rate. Several implications for managers are discussed including the reliability of using Erlang-A to determine staffing levels, the importance of considering the service rates of the agents rather than the average handle time, and the unintended consequence of call routing schemes which route calls to faster rather than slower agents...|$|R
