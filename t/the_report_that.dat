5|$|The Alamanni high kings now {{ordered a}} mass {{mobilisation}} {{of all the}} confederation's member tribes, gathering their bands at Strasbourg. In addition, they received the timely support of the Alamanni cantons near Raetia that had been pacified by Constantius in 355. Their leaders were overthrown in an anti-Roman coup by their optimates. Gundomad was slain and Wadomar forced at sword-point to break his treaty and lead his warriors to join Chnodomar. Finally, they summoned the assistance of certain non-Alamanni tribes (probably Burgundians), partly for services rendered in the past, partly for payment. At Strasbourg on the Rhine (about 32km SE of Saverne), they gathered a combined force of some 35,000 men, according to Ammianus. This figure may be an exaggeration, but the exceptional size of the levy is shown {{by the presence of}} all the Alamanni kings and <b>the</b> <b>report</b> <b>that</b> German bands were crossing the Rhine to Strasbourg continuously for three days and nights. Their aim was to bring Julian to battle and crush him by sheer weight of numbers. They provoked Julian by sending him an ultimatum to evacuate Alsace immediately.|$|E

25|$|A.A.M. Duncan {{argues that}} the {{association}} of Giric and Eochaid in the kingship is spurious, that Giric alone was king of the Picts, which he claimed {{as the son of}} daughter of Kenneth MacAlpin, and that <b>the</b> <b>report</b> <b>that</b> he was Eochaid's guardian (alumpnus) is a misreading of uncle (auunculus). A.P. Smyth proposed that Giric was a nephew of Kenneth MacAlpin, the son of his brother Donald MacAlpin (Domnall mac AilpÃ­n), which appears to rest on what is probably a scribal error. The entry also states that an otherwise unknown CausantÃ­n, son of Domnaill (or of DÃºngail) was king. Finally, Benjamin Hudson has suggested that Giric, rather than being a member of CenÃ©l nGabrÃ¡in dynasty of Kenneth MacAlpin and his kin, {{was a member of the}} northern CenÃ©l Loairn-descended dynasty of Moray, and accepts the existence of Giric's brother CausantÃ­n.|$|E
