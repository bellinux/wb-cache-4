The bodies were taken by truck to Wanganui and thence by rail to Waiouru, where police and undertakers identified them.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} {{the result of}} {{preliminary}} design of <b>tracking</b> <b>mount</b> for ARGO-M which is a movable satellite laser ranging (SLR) system developed by Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute (KASI). The <b>tracking</b> <b>mount</b> consists {{of a couple of}} core parts such as driving motors, encoders and bearings, and the requirements of each parts are determined {{on the basis of the}} technical consideration. 2 D and 3 D models for <b>tracking</b> <b>mount</b> were preliminarily designed using the selected core parts. In order to evaluate the validity of the preliminarily design, the simulator to test the elevation axis was designed and manufactured. The test to check the tracking performance and system accuracy of the simulator was performed, and it was confirmed that the preliminary design meets the operating specifications. Additionally, it was found that the repetitive errors and hysteresis errors need to be improved by the additional control algorithm...|$|R

40|$|Controller design {{procedure}} for prototype <b>tracking</b> <b>mount</b> of Movable SLR (Satellite Laser Ranging), ARGO-M is presented. <b>Tracking</b> <b>mount</b> of ARGO-M is altitude-azimuth type {{and it has}} two axes of elevation and azimuth to control its position. Controller consists of velocity and acceleration feed-forward controller, position controller at outer loop, velocity controller at inner loop. There {{are two kinds of}} position control modes. One is the pointing mode to move from one position to the other position as fast as possible and the other one is tracking mode to follow SLR trajectory as precise as possible. Because the requirement of tracking accuracy is less than 5 arcsec and it is very tight error budget, a sophisticated controller needs to be prepared to meet the accuracy. Especially, ARGO-M is using the cross-roller bearing at each axis to increase the mechanical accuracy, which requires add-on controller DOB (Disturbance observer) to suppress friction load and low frequency disturbances. The pointing and tracking performance of the designed controller is simulated and visualized using MATLAB/ Simulink and SimMechanics and the experimental results using test are presented as well...|$|R
