The methane is then sent to a neighbouring National Grid plant (NTS), leaving the remaining NGL to be piped south via a 223 km pipeline to the Mossmorran site in Fife. At the Mossmorran NGL fractionation plant, natural gas fluid is separated by distillation (in fractionation columns) into ethane (C2H6), propane (C3H8), butane (C4H10) and pentane (C5H12). The ethane is then piped to an adjacent ethene cracker plant operated by ExxonMobil for further processing and cracking. The propane and butane is chilled, liquefied and stored on site within double integrity tanks, the gasoline is also stored on site within floating roof tanks. These liquids are then transported via pipeline to the marine terminal at Braefoot Bay on the Firth of Forth for loading onto ships for export. Mossmorran also has an adjacent road <b>tanker</b> <b>terminal</b> for road transportation of propane and butane.|$|E
50|$|The {{seemingly}} sudden {{economic growth}} of the 1990s, termed the Celtic Tiger, making Ireland {{one of the richest}} countries in the world, had deep foundations stretching back through the 1980s and 1970s.

A <b>tanker</b> <b>terminal</b> at Foynes and an oil jetty at Shannon Airport were built. In 1982 a massive alumina extraction plant was built at Aughinish. Now, 60,000-ton cargo vessels carry raw bauxite from West African mines to the plant, where it is refined to alumina. This is then exported to Canada, where it is further refined to aluminium. In 1985, a huge power plant began operating at Moneypoint, fed by regular visits by 150,000-tonne tankers. European Economic Community funding was poured into infrastructure. Industrial estates at Raheen and Plassey (Castletroy), and energetic government intervention, brought in numerous foreign firms, notably Analog Devices, Wang Laboratories and Dell Computers. A science and engineering focused third-level college called NIHE, Limerick, elevated in 1989 to university status as the University of Limerick, and the establishment of Limerick Institute of Technology, furthered the area's reputation as Ireland's Silicon Valley. Thomond College of Education, Limerick was a successful teacher training college and was integrated into the university in 1991.|$|E
40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{the impact}} of oil-related developments on output, incomes and employment in Shetland. An Input-Output approach is adopted based on a Shetland transactions table constructed by the author. Using this, the pre-oil Shetland economy is analysed as base for assessing oil impact. Three major oil activities are identified and their local effects estimated: Supply Bases, the Sullom Voe <b>Tanker</b> <b>Terminal,</b> and Oil-related Construction. Estimates of {{the impact of}} these on local activity are given in aggregate and on an individual industry basis. Appropriate oil sector 'multipliers' are derived. Attempts are made to modify the basic estimates by allowing for 'negative multiplier' effects, induced investment and other elements of impact excluded in the basic model. Finally, the possibility of oil-induced changes in local technology is considered and its implications for the preceding impact estimates discussed. In the conclusions the results of the previous analysis are drawn together and some policy implications suggested by them are considered briefly...|$|E
