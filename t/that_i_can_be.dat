500|$|Davis {{narrowly}} won the Democratic primary election, defeating Elwood Caudill Jr., {{a deputy}} clerk in the Rowan County property valuation administrator's office, by 23 votes and {{advancing to the}} general election against Republican John Cox. Davis won the election, with Cox subsequently alleging that nepotism was to blame for his loss. After winning the race, Davis told The Morehead News, [...] "My words can never express the appreciation but I promise {{to each and every}} one that I will be the very best working clerk <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> and will be a good steward of their tax dollars and follow the statutes of this office to the letter." ...|$|E
2500|$|In The Phantom Menace, Portman had {{to portray}} a {{character}} younger than herself. In Attack of the Clones, however, her character had aged 10 years. Portman had aged {{only five years}} between the two films. She remarks, [...] " [...] {{wants to make sure}} I seem older than Anakin in Attack of the Clones, so it's believable <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> bossing him around, and he's a little intimidated. She looks at him as a little boy – at least {{for the first half of}} the film." ...|$|E
2500|$|I like to {{pray and}} I like to meditate. Doing just three minutes of prayer and a minimum of five minutes {{meditation}} twice a day sets the tone—like an arrow so that you're hitting your target. When I pray I always thank Mother Nature for all the beauty in the world; it's about having an attitude of gratitude. And then I pray to Christ to say, 'Thank you for this day and {{my family and my}} health,' and now that I'm older I've added, 'Please illuminate me. Please open my heart chakra. Open my aperture and uplift my consciousness so <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> the best version of myself.' ...|$|E

It is my heartfelt wish to own <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have sinned against you, and to make all the atonement <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can.</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> too anxious to deserve your {{forgiveness}} to have any fear of seeing you." ...|$|R
2500|$|.....under no {{circumstances}} whatever will I be in connexion with Mr Pitt. It {{is sufficient for}} a man's life to have been duped once. I hesitate no less to say that I will never hold communication with the Duke of Portland until he has made that amende honorable to those...whose weight and consideration in Ireland he has made subservient to his own purposes and views in this country. ...my inclinations, my private attachments, the habits of my life, all combine to make me anxious to see the moment when I {{may be able to}} give the members of opposition honourable assistance. ... But in stating this it certainly is not in my contemplation to become again an active member of an opposition. Those days are over—circumstances have happened that make me think <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> no more usefully so...but, in one word, should circumstances ever present to me the opportunity of doing essential injury to Mr Pitt's power, or of rendering effectual service to Mr Fox, I will not fail to seize it.|$|E

6000|$|... "But you'll {{find out}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> honest too," [...] he burst {{out in a}} menacing tone, {{she had learned to}} {{appreciate}} with an amused thrill.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, it isn't," [...] I {{retorted}} quickly. [...] "Nothing <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do <b>is</b> {{good enough}} for you, but I intend to make you entirely happy if I can." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have thought}} of it, Malchus; the only thing <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> see <b>is</b> for me to stain my skin and dye my hair and go as a peasant boy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's just {{occurred}} to me <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> hardly <b>be</b> married in rags. I think I had better go up to town {{for a few days}} to get some things." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should not}} have ventured to disobey you now {{were it not for}} the hope <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> of service. I have seen Rougane, the mayor..." ...|$|E

6000|$|Ere Hudson had {{completed}} his tale, Buckingham interrupted him by exclaiming, [...] "Is it possible <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> suspected by your Majesty {{on the word}} of this pitiful variety of the baboon tribe?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{answered}} Venn, swerving {{round in}} obedience; and, after a pause, [...] "I {{wish you would}} {{tell me what this}} great trouble is. I think you have proved <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> trusted." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are right. I am a great man," [...] I answered, yawning, [...] "and if you trouble me {{too much}} you will see <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> mad also. Now what do you want?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Well; I {{did not ask}} her. I do {{not know}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> more explicit. Nevertheless it is expected; and as I {{do not mean to}} do it, you can see that there is a difficulty.' ...|$|E
