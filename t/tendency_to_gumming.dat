40|$|The {{effects of}} {{different}} hydrocolloids on the gelatinisation behaviour of hard wheat flour were investigated. Influence of guar, xanthan, Arabic, {{carboxy methyl cellulose}} (CMC) and tragacanth gums on wheat flour was studied using micro viscoamylograph. It was found that all hydrocolloids except tragacanth greatly modified the gelatinisation properties of wheat flour. Guar and xanthan significantly lowered the gelatinisation temperature, enhanced peak viscosity, increased the breakdown during cooking, promoted the stability during cooling and thus decreased the <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> setback. <b>Gum</b> Arabic lowers the peak viscosity, reduces breakdown during heating and thus provides increased stability during cooking. The addition of CMC to the wheat flour resulted in maximum stability during cooling. It also produced large breakdown during heating which provided maximum destabilization and made the cooking easier. These results suggest that by adding gums gelatinisation properties of wheat flour can be greatly modified and this {{could be used for}} the improvement of different wheat products...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we use a}} real options {{approach}} to analyze farmers' economic incentives <b>to</b> abandon <b>gum</b> production or expand by creating new plantations. Our results indicate that agricultural crops currently provide higher economic benefits as compared <b>to</b> <b>gum</b> agroforestry. However, we show that the incentives for <b>gum</b> producers <b>to</b> abandon <b>gum</b> production is low, because (i) land is abundant, (ii) gum arabic is produced {{during the dry season}} and agricultural crops mainly during the wet season, and (iii) the dry season opportunity cost of labor is low. Hence, an increase in deforestation in the near future is not expected. The analysis further shows that an increase in the prices of gum arabic of about 315 % is needed to induce an expansion of gum agroforestry and a shift in land use system from continuous agricultural production <b>to</b> <b>gum</b> agroforestry system. Hence, also an expansion of gum forests and/or agroforests in the near future is not expected. Price policies to improve incentives for expanding gum forests are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{studies suggest}} that {{feelings}} of regret are elicited by events appraised as goal incongruent and caused by the self {{and that they are}} characterized by a <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> repair the event. Study 1 investigated whether the appraisal of self-agency increases the <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> repair. Participants played a game in which goal-congruent and goal-incongruent events were caused by themselves (self-agency) or by a die (circumstances-agency). The <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> repair was measured via behavior and self-reports. Self-agency increased feelings of regret but not the <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> repair. Moreover, our data rejected the idea that regret is more than other negative feelings associated with the <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> repair. Study 2 confirmed the findings of Study 1 using autobiographical recall. Both studies provide support for a relation between self-agency and feelings of regret, but not between self-agency and the <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> repair nor between the <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> repair and feelings of regret. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} has been done {{with the aim of}} {{determining}} the relationship between emotional intelligence and the <b>tendency</b> rate <b>to</b> the type of educational media among 307 students of Islamic Azad University who have been selected randomly. The researchers have collected the data with the preparation a 33 questionnaire question to measure the emotional intelligence and a 20 questionnaire question to measure the rate of the <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> the type of educational media. The questionnaire of the emotional intelligence contains five subscales such as self-consciousness, self – control, self-motivation, social consciousness, social skills and the questionnaire of the <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> the type of educational media contains visual media, audio media, visualaudio media, multi-sensory and meta-media. The results showed that it has no relationship between the rate of selfconsciousness, controlling himself, self-motivation, his social consciousness and an amazing people and the rate of the <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> educational media. Furthermore, it does not exist no relationship between the rate of social skills of people and the rate of <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> visual media, visual-audio, multi-sensory and meta-media but there is a direct relationship between the rate of social skills of people and the rate of <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> audio media, i. e. the people with higher social skills have more <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> audio media. On the other hand, people with high emotional intelligence don’t have as much <b>tendency</b> as <b>to</b> the educational media. These people have more <b>tendencies</b> <b>to</b> visual-audio media and meta-media, and also they have fewer <b>tendencies</b> <b>to</b> visual media. In addition, the people with low emotional intelligence don’t have as much <b>tendency</b> as <b>to</b> educational media. These people withlow emotional intelligence have more <b>tendencies</b> <b>to</b> visual-audio media and meta-media, and also they have fewer <b>tendencies</b> <b>to</b> audio media.
