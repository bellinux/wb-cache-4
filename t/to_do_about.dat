5|$|One of {{the most}} {{contentious}} issues amongst islanders {{in the 21st century}} is what <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> the rodent situation. Rodents have only been on the island since a ship ran aground in 1918 and have wiped out several endemic bird species and were thought to have done the same to the Lord Howe Island stick insect. There is a plan to drop 42 tonnes of rat bait across the island but the community is heavily divided.|$|E

In fact, the show's creators made Sara Sidle while thinking of a future love interest for Grissom, but during the show's first three seasons, Grissom flirted with all the female characters, and when Sara asked him out to dinner, he rejected her, claiming {{that he did not}} know what <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> what is going on between them.|$|E

5|$|After Yogesh has met {{most of the}} girls, one of them, Sanjana (Priyanka Chopra), asks {{to talk to him}} privately. She says to {{him that}} a boy has agreed to marry her, but she is reluctant. She asks Yogesh to give her time to decide what <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> her boyfriend. He agrees, telling her about his {{problems}} with Jitu. Sanjana, touched that Yogesh will help her despite his own problems, hugs him. Devu walks in, and thinks he has interrupted them; Sanjana chases him, trying to explain. Tailing Devu, the detective is unaware that he had been with Anila at a hotel and sees him with Sanjana. Sanjana shows Devu a picture; when he says something supposedly demeaning, she becomes angry and tries to leave. Devu stops her, holding her while she cries before they leave in his car. The detective convinces Yogesh and his father that Devu is having an affair with Sanjana. Anila then comes downstairs, looking for Devu. Yogesh shows her the photos, telling her that Devu and Sanjana went to Khandala, a hill station near Mumbai. The detective tells Devu's wife this story, and they find Devu at a hotel with Sanjana. Devu thinks Yogesh betrayed him, and Yogesh thinks Devu is having an affair with Sanjana.|$|E
5|$|It is a {{new year}} at McKinley High. New Directions glee club {{director}} Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) and guidance counselor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays) are now sharing an apartment and a bed. Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch), coach of the Cheerios cheerleading squad, is running for Congress but doing badly in the polls. Glee club member Mike Chang (Harry Shum, Jr.) is now a senior, while fellow members Tina Cohen-Chang (Jenna Ushkowitz) and Artie Abrams (Kevin McHale) are juniors. Club co-captain Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith), a senior, {{has no idea what}} <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> his future. Mercedes Jones (Amber Riley) has a new boyfriend (LaMarcus Tinker); her former boyfriend Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet) moved to another state. Three New Directions members have left: Sam, Lauren Zizes (Ashley Fink), who also broke up with Puck (Mark Salling), and Sam's ex-girlfriend Quinn Fabray (Dianna Agron), who has completely reinvented herself with pink hair, a nose ring and a tattoo; she has taken up smoking, and has made friends with a group of outcast girls called the Skanks. She refuses to rejoin either the Cheerios or New Directions.|$|E

25|$|In April 1970, {{a general}} {{election}} was held with the Rhodesian Front easily winning. Ian Smith portrayed his government as not being racialist, and sought to postpone {{the question of what}} <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> the problems in the farming industry until after the election. Indeed, he was able to do so because more radical and more racist parties had at that time been formed and stood in the election.|$|E

25|$|Roddenberry became {{concerned}} at {{the concentration of}} the fanbase on Spock and not Kirk. He wrote to his friend, noted science fiction writer Isaac Asimov for advice on what <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> the situation.

These included placing the character in disguises to make Kirk seem more fun, or to create situations where Spock must save Kirk's life to demonstrate who the more important character was.|$|E

25|$|In late May 2009, reports emerged {{regarding}} a possible resurgence of xenophobic related {{activity and the}} organising of attacks in the Western Cape. Reports of threats and secret meetings by local businessmen surfaced in Gugulethu, Khayelitsha and Philippi, Cape Town. Samora Machel in Philippi once again emerging as a flash-point. In Gugulethu, reports emerged of secret meetings by local businessmen discussing 'what <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> Somali shopkeepers'. The Anti-Eviction Campaign brought these issues to the open by organising a series of anti-xenophobia meetings attempting to find {{the root cause of}} the crisis.|$|E
25|$|Many {{decisions}} {{had to be}} made, {{including what}} <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> people who may find the new technology confusing, or who {{have no desire to}} receive more than the four or five channels they originally had, and who may have been reluctant to buy a digital box to view the free channels. The government arranged for the BBC to administer a Digital Switchover Help Scheme to ensure that groups such as the over-75s and recipients of disability benefits did not lose their television services when analogue transmissions were switched off.|$|E
25|$|From the {{beginning}} of his term, Bush faced the problem of what <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> the federal budget debt. At $2.8trillion in 1990, the deficit had grown to three times larger than it was in 1980. Bush was dedicated to curbing the deficit, believing that America could not continue to be a leader in the world without doing so. He began an effort to persuade the Democratic controlled Congress to act on the budget; with Republicans believing that the best way was to cut government spending, and Democrats convinced that the only way would be to raise taxes, consensus building proved difficult.|$|E

25|$|The {{incomplete}} {{success in}} stopping inflation created an extremely difficult policy conflict. Recovery could in principle be stimulated by more expansionary credit policies and lower interest rates, which would favor increased investment, depreciation {{of the currency}} to help producers compete against imports, and improved exports. But continuing inflation {{and the fear of}} accelerating its rate of increase argued instead for keeping a very tight rein on credit and thereby blocked the actions needed for recovery. This conflict became particularly acute over the question of what <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> the exchange note: the real exchange rate went in exactly the wrong direction for recovery by appreciating when depreciation was both expected and needed.|$|E
25|$|Before the 2004-2005 {{academic}} year, a few schools, {{most notably}} Trace Crossings Elementary, had almost, {{if not more}} than, 1,000 students, resulting {{in the building of}} Riverchase Elementary. After that, the case of overcrowding was resolved, with many students moving to the new school. However, a similar case has occurred with Bumpus Middle School, resulting in meetings at multiple district schools to discuss what <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> the case. For the 2011-2012 academic year, Bumpus Middle School and its students were moved to the former freshman center of Hoover High School, and the old Bumpus site became Brock's Gap Intermediate School, which serves 5th and 6th graders. Bumpus Middle School now serves 7th and 8th graders.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Nathan-Turner {{was trying}} to figure out what <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> K-9. The robot dog was very popular among {{children}} but was difficult to deal with technically and Nathan-Turner felt that it made the TARDIS crew almost overwhelmingly formidable. He decided that a child-orientated spin-off series with K-9 might be just the thing. However, such a series would require a human as the lead, and his prime candidate for this role was Sladen. He pitched the part to the actress as a departure from what she had previously done: she would be returning as Sarah Jane Smith, but she would do so as the heroine and not just a sidekick. This offer Sladen accepted.|$|E
