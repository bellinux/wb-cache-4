500|$|The 1970 {{demo version}} of [...] "Run of the Mill" [...] appears briefly in Martin Scorsese's [...] {{documentary}} (2011), playing over {{a scene where}} Harrison takes to the stage {{for one of his}} 1974 Dark Horse Tour concerts, before cutting to him and his wife on an empty beach at sunset. Although available since the 1990s on bootleg collections such as Beware of ABKCO!, this solo demo was only issued officially in the UK in November 2011, with the [...] DVD release of the film. Six months later, it received worldwide release on the [...] compilation. Noting Harrison's usual practice of perfecting his guitar parts, compilation producer Giles Martin commented: [...] "While that's a very valid practice, I think it can sometimes inhibit the spirit of the recording... he appeal of this version <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it's very rough and edgy." ...|$|E

Named after Lavigne's childhood nickname, Abbey Dawn is designed by Lavigne herself. Kohl's describes Abbey Dawn as a [...] "juniors lifestyle brand", which incorporates skull, zebra, and star patterns, purples and [...] "hot pinks and blacks". Lavigne, who wore some of the clothes and jewellery from her line at various concerts before its official launch, pointed {{out that she was}} not merely licensing her name to the collection. [...] "I actually am the designer. What's really important <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> everything fits well and is well-made, so I try everything on and approve it all." [...] The clothing line incorporates Lavigne's musical style and lyrics, [...] "after the release of my first album, I realized how much fashion was involved in my musical career".|$|E

500|$|In June 2013, Clark Gregg {{explained}} how the series would tie into the Marvel Cinematic Universe films: [...] "...the exciting part {{is going to}} be seeing the way that Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. interacts with the S.H.I.E.L.D. component in , and the other movies, and whether those movies will then affect our show." [...] Joss Whedon did state that the show would be autonomous from The Avengers, saying [...] "It's gotta be a show that works for people who haven't seen the Marvel movies. It will please Marvel fans, I think." [...] He reiterated that sentiment in an interview at the 2012 Toronto International Film Festival, explaining [...] "It's new characters. It needs to be its own thing. It needs to be adjacent ... What does S.H.I.E.L.D. have that the other superheroes don't? And that, <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they're not superheroes, but they live in that universe. Even though they're a big organization, that [...] makes them underdogs, and that's interesting to me." ...|$|E
500|$|The film cuts to {{the closing}} credits from {{a shot of the}} top {{apparently}} starting to show an ever so faint wobble, inviting speculation about whether the final sequence was reality or another dream. Nolan confirmed that the ambiguity was deliberate, saying, [...] "I've been asked the question more times than I've ever been asked any other question about any other film I've made... What's funny <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> people really do expect me to answer it." [...] The film's script concludes with [...] "Behind him, on the table, the spinning top is STILL SPINNING. And we – FADE OUT". [...] Nolan said, [...] "I put that cut there at the end, imposing an ambiguity from outside the film. That always felt the right ending to me — it always felt like the appropriate 'kick' to me... The real point of the scene — and this is what I tell people — is that Cobb isn't looking at the top. He's looking at his kids. He's left it behind. That's the emotional significance of the thing." [...] Also, Michael Caine explained his interpretation of the ending, saying, [...] "If I'm there it's real, because I'm never in the dream. I'm the guy who invented the dream." ...|$|E
500|$|For In the Zone, Spears {{worked with}} hit {{producers}} such as Bloodshy & Avant, R. Kelly, Diddy, Christopher Stewart, Moby, Guy Sigsworth and The Matrix. She first started writing songs for In the Zone during the Dream Within a Dream Tour. Spears commented about writing while touring, [...] "The {{only thing that}} was scary <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> I didn't {{know if they were}} good. [...] You can’t trust anybody. You have to go with your feelings." [...] Spears commented that she was an autobiographical songwriter, although not to the point she felt self-exploited. Following the end of the tour, Spears invited her friend and backing vocalist Annet Artani to her home in Los Angeles. They started writing songs at the piano, and shortly after, they traveled to Lake Como in Lombardy, Italy. Among the tracks they worked on was [...] "Everytime", which Artani confirmed to be written as a response to Justin Timberlake's [...] "Cry Me a River", as well as [...] "Shine", written by Spears about her sister Jamie Lynn, which was left unfinished. Earnest recording of the album began in May 2003. Spears commented that although she did not know initially what direction she wanted to go with the album, she took time to work with different producers and to find those who she had chemistry with. The first song recorded for In the Zone was [...] "Touch of My Hand", and Spears said it [...] "really did provide a balance {{for the rest of the}} record. We just went from there." [...] Following the recording sessions for [...] "Everytime", Spears complimented Sigsworth, saying, [...] "I just basically told him exactly how I wanted the song to sound. And he was so amazing because there's a lot of producers you tell them things and they don't get it. And you're like oh, that's not the right way. He got it just right. He was amazing." ...|$|E

2500|$|Typical scripts for {{an average}} one-hour {{television}} show run 60 pages, but those for Moonlighting were nearly twice as long due to the fast talking overlapping dialogue of the main characters. While the average television show would take seven days to shoot, Moonlighting would take from 12–14 days to complete with episodes and dialogue frequently being written by Caron the same day they were shot. This attention to detail contributed to Moonlighting as {{being one of the}} most expensive television shows being produced at the time. Where most episodes would cost around $900,000 to produce, Moonlighting was running nearly double that. [...] The season 2 episode [...] "The Dream Sequence Always Rings Twice" [...] could have been filmed much more cheaply by being shot in color and then decolorized, but Caron insisted on the authentic look of black-and-white film which took 16 days to shoot, bringing the cost of the episode to the then-unheard-of sum of two million dollars. Caron often defended his filming practices in the name of giving the audience what they wanted and producing a quality product. He used the following analogy to illustrate the point, [...] "The thinking in television which makes no damn sense <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> a half hour of television costs X, and an hour of television costs Y, no matter what that television is, it strikes me as an insane hypothesis. The parallel is, you're hungry, whether you go to McDonald's or whether you go to '21,' it should cost the same; they both fill your stomach. It's nonsense." ...|$|E
2500|$|Prior to obtaining {{his record}} deal, Mika sent demos to many record {{companies}} in Britain, but was never signed. One record label in particular claimed that Mika {{had a good}} voice, but insisted he write more conventional songs like Robbie Williams {{in order to become}} more commercial. Mika rejected this advice. [...] The song [...] "Grace Kelly" [...] was inspired by these problems. In 2006 Mika signed with Island Records and began recording his debut album. His musical influences are based in classical music. Before Mika released his debut album he promised the media that [...] "It was a magical world that you could live in. A parallel universe for people that is illusory and enchanting and amazing." [...] Some songs on the album are sexually ambiguous, prompting some questioning regarding Mika's sexuality. On this, Mika comments that he has no taboos about what he can use to tell a story or what stories he can actually tell. He believes that sexualizing music is great, but politically sexualizing music and making the artist's sexuality the defining point of someone's music is [...] "boring". He says about his own sexuality: [...] "...laying myself out on the table to almost a tabloid level and kind of sharing my entire personal life, I'm really not into that." [...] The songs on the album have different subjects. [...] "Grace Kelly", as stated before, is about the struggle of getting a record deal. Mika stated that the song is a very important song on the album mostly because:"...it's a flagpole for the record in terms of lyrical content and the whole pop vision I wanted to get across." [...] The cover for the album and booklet was designed by Mika's sister, Yasmine, who works under the pen name DaWack, Richard Hogg and Mika himself. In March 2007 the album was released in the United States. Before its release there was much publicity about the album, mainly due to its success in Europe. Mika commented on the hype by saying: [...] "I think I'm lucky. Hype can be good and hype can be bad. The good thing that's happening <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the hype is about the project, it's about the music ... I'm not the son of anyone famous, I haven't really slept with anyone particularly well known ... it's really just about music, and that's something I think is very healthy." ...|$|E
