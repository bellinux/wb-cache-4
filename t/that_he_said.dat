5|$|Ellis {{fought for}} players' rights, {{including}} the right to free agency. Jackie Robinson credited him with trying to further the rights of African American players, but warned him <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> too much. In 1971, Ellis testified before the United States Senate Subcommittee on Public Health about his experiences with sickle cell and later worked with people who had the disease and raised money for sickle cell research.|$|E
5|$|In October 1827, Smith and {{his wife}} moved from Palmyra to Harmony (now Oakland), Pennsylvania, aided by a {{relatively}} prosperous neighbor, Martin Harris. Living near his in-laws, Smith transcribed some characters <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> were engraved on the plates, and then dictated a translation to his wife.|$|E
5|$|Austin {{admitted}} {{the theft of}} the cow, saying he had had no food for his children. According to his undated charge sheet, witnesses for the state were Littrell, Martin, Lane, and Lawrence Payne. Austin's account of what happened tallied {{with that of the}} posse, except <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> he was the one, not Laura, who had objected to the shotgun being removed from the wall. He said Laura had been trying to take the rifle away from her son when it was fired.|$|E

5|$|Moore {{appeared}} in other {{television and radio}} shows, including Just a Minute and, from 1992 until 1998, {{playing the role of}} GamesMaster in the television show of the same name: a character who professed to know {{everything there is to know}} about video gaming. He would issue video game challenges and answered questions on cheats and tips. The show's host, Dominik Diamond, claimed that Moore did not understand anything <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> on the show, yet managed to record his contributions in single takes.|$|E
5|$|Newsom {{attended}} Santa Clara University on {{a partial}} baseball scholarship and student loans, where {{he graduated in}} 1989 with a B.S. in political science. Newsom was a left-handed pitcher for Santa Clara, but he threw his arm out after two years and hasn't thrown a baseball since. He lived in the Alameda Apartments, which he later compared to living in a hotel. He later reflected on his education fondly, crediting the Jesuit approach of Santa Clara <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> has helped him become an independent thinker who questions orthodoxy. Newsom spent a semester studying abroad in Rome.|$|E
5|$|While {{spending}} time with Finn and Jake, Princess Bubblegum realizes {{that she needs to}} leave for a science convention in the Veggie Village. She entrusts the two with guarding her Princess Plant. However, when she departs, Finn and Jake party too hard with the plant, killing it. They then decide on a way to journey into the Land of the Dead and to reclaim the flower's soul from Death himself. For an unspecified price, Peppermint Butler (voiced by Steve Little) teaches the two how to get into the Underworld, and he instructs Finn and Jake also to tell Death <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> hello.|$|E

5|$|Edwards is a far-right {{political}} activist from Memphis, Tennessee, {{described by the}} Southern Poverty Law Center as a rising star of the modern white-nationalist movement. They write that he is articulate, charming, and at ease {{in front of the}} public, as well as in television and radio studios. He attended Briarcrest Christian School, a private school in Memphis, and in ninth grade transferred into a Christian-nationalist homeschooling program, a decision <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> led him into political activism. In 2000 he volunteered for Pat Buchanan's presidential campaign, and in 2002 ran unsuccessfully for the Tennessee House of Representatives. It was during this campaign that he met fellow activist Austin Farley, who was on the ballot against him. In October of that year, he and Farley established The Political Cesspool.|$|E
5|$|He {{also promised}} to seek income tax law changes <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> {{would help to}} lower federal deficits and would stimulate {{economic}} growth. These included: reducing individual income tax rates across the board by 20percent, maintaining the Bush administration-era tax rate of 15percent on investment income from dividends and capital gains (and eliminating this tax entirely for those with annual incomes less than $200,000), cutting the top tax rate on corporations from 35 to 25percent, and eliminating the estate tax and the Alternative Minimum Tax. He promised {{that the loss of}} government revenue from these tax cuts would be offset by closing loopholes and placing limits on tax deductions and credits available to taxpayers with the highest incomes, but said that that aspect of the plan could not yet be evaluated because details would have to be worked out with Congress.|$|E
5|$|Jussi {{found himself}} in the unusual {{position}} of attempting to defend a client who refused to defend himself. With no evidence at his disposal to support Feletti's testimony, he was forced to rely almost entirely on his own oratory. Jussi put forward some aspects of the sequence of events <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> suggested that orders had indeed come from Rome—for example, that Feletti had sent Edgardo straight off to the capital without seeing him—and asserted that the Holy Office and the Pope were far better placed to adjudge the validity of the baptism than a secular court. He quoted at length from Angelo Padovani's account of his meeting with Anna Morisi in July 1858, then cast doubt on the grocer Lepori's claim that he did not even know how to baptise a child—Jussi produced a police report in which Lepori was described as a close friend of a Jesuit priest. Jussi proposed that Lepori and Bussolari might both be lying to protect themselves, and that Morisi's sexual impropriety did not necessarily mean her story was false. He concluded that since Feletti had been inquisitor at the time, he had merely done what that office required him to do, and no crime had been committed.|$|E

25|$|In August 2012, {{during a}} week of heavy {{fundraising}} from oil company executives, Romney put forward {{what he called a}} comprehensive energy plan <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> would allow North America to become independent of foreign oil imports within a decade.|$|E
25|$|Approximately 45 {{per cent}} of {{institutional}} investors thought that better oversight by the SEC {{could have prevented}} the Madoff fraud. Harry Markopolos complained to the SEC's Boston office in 2000, telling the SEC staff they should investigate Madoff because {{it was impossible to}} legally make the profits Madoff claimed using the investment strategies <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> he used.|$|E

25|$|In 1959, Swedish {{painter and}} film {{producer}} Friedrich Jürgenson was recording bird songs. Upon playing the tape later, he heard what he interpreted {{to be his}} dead father's voice and then the spirit of his deceased wife calling his name. He went on to make several more recordings, including one <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> contained a message from his late mother.|$|E
25|$|Hyman {{criticized the}} {{ganzfeld}} papers for not describing optimal protocols, nor including the appropriate statistical analysis. He presented {{a factor analysis}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> demonstrated a link between success and three flaws, namely: flaws in randomization for choice of target; flaws in randomization in judging procedure; and insufficient documentation. Honorton asked a statistician, David Saunders, to look at Hyman's factor analysis and he concluded {{that the number of}} experiments was too small to complete a factor analysis.|$|E
25|$|On {{his death}} bed Umar vacillated to appoint his successor. However, {{it has been}} {{reported}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> that if Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah, Khalid ibn Walid or Salim, the mawla and freed Persian slave, were alive he would have appointed one of them his successor. Umar finally appointed a committee of six persons comprising Abdur Rahman bin Awf, Saad ibn Abi Waqqas, Talha ibn Ubaidullah, Uthman ibn Affan, Ali ibn Abi Talib and Zubayr ibn al-Awwam.|$|E

25|$|The Rabbis {{taught that}} Rahab {{was one of}} the four most {{beautiful}} women who ever lived, along with Sarah, Abigail, and Esther. The Rabbis taught that Rahab inspired lust by the mere mention of her name. Rabbi Isaac taught that saying Rahab's name twice would cause a man immediately to lose control. Rav Nachman protested <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> Rahab's name twice and nothing happened to him. Rabbi Isaac replied that he meant that this would happen to any man who knew her.|$|E
25|$|In June 2000, Gongadze {{wrote an}} open letter to Ukraine's chief {{prosecutor}} about harassment from the SBU, the Ukrainian secret police, directed towards himself and his Ukrayinska Pravda colleagues and apparently related to an investigation into a murder case in the southern port of Odessa. He complained that he had been forced into hiding because of harassment from the secret police, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> he and his family were being followed, that his staff were being harassed, and that the SBU were spreading a rumor that he was wanted on a murder charge.|$|E
25|$|Experts at the Johns Hopkins Center for Civilian Biodefense Strategies (CCBS) {{concluded}} {{that one of}} the nineteen 9/11 hijackers, Ahmed al-Haznawi, had likely been exposed to anthrax. al-Haznawi and another man arrived in the emergency room of a Fort Lauderdale, Florida, hospital presenting an ugly, dark lesion on his leg <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> he developed after bumping into a suitcase two months earlier. Christos Tsonas thought the injury was curious, cleaned it and prescribed an antibiotic. After September 11, federal investigators found the medicine prescribed by Tsonas among the possessions of al-Haznawi.|$|E
