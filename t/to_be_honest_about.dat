And we have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>honest</b> <b>about</b> that. While {{the rest of the world}} wants peace, Europe wants peace, the US wants peace, but this state wants war, war and war. In the first week of the massacres, there were reports in the Israeli press that Israel did not want to put all its ground forces in Gaza because it was preparing attacks on Iran. Then there were reports it was planning attacks on Lebanon. It is a lunatic state.|$|E
25|$|Becoming desperate, Elle and Sage visit Elle's ex-husband Karl, whom Elle has {{not seen}} in decades. She tells him she needs to borrow the money for rent, and he {{requests}} a kiss in return. This leads to an argument over how Elle ended their relationship, but when she pleads with him, he agrees {{to hand over the}} cash. When he asks her <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>honest</b> <b>about</b> the reason for needing the money, she tells him that Sage needs an abortion, and Karl becomes angry and emotional. Elle once aborted his child without telling him, yet went on to give birth to a baby born from a one-night stand. She explains that she wanted a child but not a husband, and Karl angrily insists he will not pay for an abortion.|$|E

I got to choose the music, but this time around it was, like, I'd sit down and think: 'What {{happened}} to me yesterday? What happened to me today?' and just write. It was very therapeutic, in a way. And easy – I was shocked at {{how easy it was}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>honest</b> <b>about</b> yourself and things that affect you. It is a dance record, but I wanted it to be serious. I wanted to talk about serious things, but do it in a not-so-serious way, with music that makes you want to get up and dance.|$|E

She also {{said that she}} would publish 100 new ideas aimed at improving lives after meeting people during her campaign. Positioning herself as a unifying candidate who would make the party [...] "fit for purpose", she called for [...] "bold and radical" [...] new approaches to policy, which would require Labour <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>honest</b> <b>about</b> funding crises in local government and health. She pledged that, if elected, she would work with the SNP government when she felt it was {{in the best interest of}} Scotland to do so, but said Labour would also be an effective opposition, holding the government to account when necessary.|$|E
500|$|Scholar Joanne M. Braxton sees Caged Bird as [...] "the fully {{developed}} black female autobiographical form {{that began to}} emerge in the 1940s and 1950s". [...] The book presents themes that are common in autobiography by Black American women: a celebration of Black motherhood; a criticism of racism; the importance of family; and the quest for independence, personal dignity, and self-definition. Angelou introduces a unique point of view in American autobiography by revealing her life story through a narrator who is a Black female from the South, at some points a child, and other points a mother. Writer Hilton Als calls Angelou one of the [...] "pioneers of self-exposure", willing to focus honestly on the more negative aspects of her personality and choices. For example, Angelou was worried about her readers' reactions to her disclosure in her second autobiography, Gather Together in My Name, that she was a prostitute. [...] She went through with it, anyway, after her husband Paul Du Feu advised her <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>honest</b> <b>about</b> it.|$|E
500|$|Wings for My Flight {{was first}} {{published}} in 1991 in hardcover by Addison-Wesley. Houle later wrote a short story titled [...] "Albert" [...] that was adapted from Wings for My Flight, focusing on Albert and Leopold's first attempts at flying. The story was published in the May 1996 issue of the children's magazine Cricket. Wings for My Flight was republished, this time in paperback, in 1999 by Pruett Publishing. This edition included a foreword by Robert Michael Pyle and a new preface and epilogue by Houle. In 2014, the book was updated and republished again by University of New Mexico Press. The updated edition contained photographs of the Chimney Rock landscape, as well as a preface by Houle that addressed the recovery of the peregrine falcon population since the book {{was first published}} in 1991. Houle highlighted the 1972 agricultural prohibition of DDT, which was the chemical primarily responsible for the peregrine decline; the Endangered Species Act of 1973, which allowed the pursuit of wildlife conservation to take precedence over land issues; and successful attempts to raise peregrines in captivity and later release them to the wild. While writing the book, Houle changed the names of various people and places, explaining the choice by saying [...] "I felt more comfortable changing the names because I worked for so long with those people, it was impossible <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>honest</b> <b>about</b> them if I named them".|$|E

The two characters conflict with each other greatly, but Jouji never gives up and would do anything to express his love towards Akane. Although his attempts to win Akanes love at first do nothing but anger Akane, he gradually starts to make an impression on her, inspiring Akane <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more <b>honest</b> <b>about</b> her own feelings.|$|R
5000|$|Proctor's {{heavy use}} as a Yankee {{reliever}} led to concerns that Torre was overusing him. General manager Brian Cashman revealed in 2011 that he confronted Torre about Proctor's workload and asked the pitcher <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more <b>honest</b> <b>about</b> whether he could pitch on a given day: [...] "I met with Proctor and said, 'You better stop telling the manager you can pitch because the way he manages' [...] - [...] I'm not criticizing Joe, that's {{just the way he}} is [...] - [...] 'He wants an honest answer.

2500|$|Publicist Marvet Britto stated, [...] "Jackson embodies grace, {{style and}} integrity...She {{has never been}} known as a bad person." [...] Britto {{describes}} Jackson’s videotaped apology as [...] "impersonal", saying, [...] "She has never been an impersonal artist, so it made it seem like she was guilty of something, and she wasn't. I would have had her and Timberlake apologizing side by side right from the beginning, since they performed side by side. Otherwise, it made the whole apology seem calculated and contrived." [...] Jackson said of the apology, [...] "I probably {{should have done it}} live. But there was so much going on at the time that I needed to just get it done. It is what it is. And it will pass, and I'm fine with it." [...] At one point Jackson was scheduled to be interviewed about the incident by Diane Sawyer on the ABC newsmagazine Primetime, however, the interview never came to fruition. Jackson later briefly discussed the incident on Good Morning America and the Late Show with David Letterman. Jackson's outfit was designed by famed designer Alexander McQueen, with Jackson later commenting [...] "I don't blame him; he didn't rip it. Alexander is so great at what he does – he's a genius." [...] In an interview with Australia's Herald Sun, Jackson commented on Timberlake (whom, as mentioned, Jackson had previously known personally and aided when she selected his former group 'N Sync to open for her Velvet Rope World Tour at the start of their career) distancing himself from the incident and seemingly changing with fame. [...] "I really want <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>honest</b> <b>about</b> this, but I just feel that anything I say about him will be taken the wrong way", said Jackson. [...] "I do think that Justin is very talented and that he has a very big career ahead of him. But he seems to have changed recently. He's gotten a bit cocky. You know, some people can handle success and some people can't. I'm starting to wonder if (the latter) is the case with Justin. And it hurts me to say that." [...] Producer Jimmy Jam revealed Jackson considered writing a song about the incident for her Damita Jo album, saying, [...] "I don't know whether it will or not. But I have a feeling it probably will, because kind of whatever's happening in her life tends to be what she writes about [...] It'd be kind of interesting to see what her feeling is about it." ...|$|E

[...] "I admit that I was greatly impressed by her," [...] I went on, [...] "but just when I had begun to hope for a better understanding, her brother Lorado chilled me with the information that she was about to be claimed by another man. <b>To</b> <b>be</b> <b>honest</b> <b>about</b> it, mother, I am not sure that she is interested in me even now; although one of her friends has just written me to say that Lorado was mistaken, and that Zulime is not engaged to any one.

Bruce Meredith cried all night, Mrs. Meredith says, when he heard Jem and Jerry were going. And he wanted to know if the 'K of K.' his father talked about was the King of Kings. He is the dearest kiddy. I just love him--though I don't really care much for children.

I don't mind looking at a nice clean baby if somebody else holds it--but I wouldn't touch it for anything and I don't feel a single real spark of interest in it. Gertrude Oliver says she just feels the same. (She is the most honest person I know. She never pretends anything.) She says babies bore her until they are old enough to talk and then she likes them--but still a good ways off.

50|$|Engaging in {{internet}} relationships is also risky because the information placed online about an individual {{does not have}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> accurate.

Prior to the start of Cannes, Winter Sleep was considered the favorite to win the Palme d'Or, but when it was shown it met with mixed critical reaction. Some found it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> too long (at 3 hours 16 minutes, it was the longest film at the festival) and difficult to finish, while others called it a great revelation.
