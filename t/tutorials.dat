40|$|Theses (M. A.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2009. The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} an online <b>tutorial</b> designed to teach digitization and metadata indexing of library and archival resources. The online <b>tutorial</b> was designed according to constructivist teaching principles to promote collaborative learning. The <b>tutorial</b> was hosted on the OLS (Open learning System) of the University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN). The research was concerned with answering three research questions: Is the online <b>tutorial</b> a teaching instrument capable of teaching metadata indexing and digitization skills? Is the online <b>tutorial</b> an effective teaching tool? Does the use of constructivist teaching elements in the <b>tutorial</b> design allow for a more effective communication of knowledge and skills? A total of 10 participants registered for and took part in the online <b>tutorial.</b> On completion of the <b>tutorial</b> a qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the <b>tutorial</b> was done. In terms of the latter a self-administered questionnaire was used as the data collection technique. The qualitative evaluation was done via an analysis of discussions on the discussion forum and e-mail correspondence between learners and the researcher during the running of the <b>tutorial.</b> A more quantitative analysis was then conducted of the responses to the self-administered questionnaire. The qualitative and quantitative analysis identified significant issues that affected the running of the online <b>tutorial.</b> The main issues included problems relating to Internet access to the online <b>tutorial,</b> participation of learners on the <b>tutorial</b> and the functioning of the online learning environment. The analysis of the results of the evaluation provided answers for the three research questions. The analysis found that the online <b>tutorial</b> was able to teach metadata indexing and digitization skills. This was based on completed work that was submitted by participants and responses participants gave to questions on the postcourse questionnaire. However, the amount of work submitted by all participants for the metadata indexing and digitization exercises was generally low. The online <b>tutorial</b> was able to conduct effective teaching at certain times in the <b>tutorial.</b> However, there were a number of issues that disrupted the functioning of the online <b>tutorial</b> and this limited the effectiveness of teaching on the <b>tutorial.</b> The use of constructivist teaching elements in the <b>tutorial</b> design was unable to enable effective communication of knowledge and skills and the promotion of constructivist learning on the <b>tutorial.</b> This goal was hampered by various problems associated with the hosting of the online <b>tutorial</b> and Internet connectivity to the OLS site.

5|$|In {{designing}} puzzles, Barth {{wanted to}} keep puzzles open-ended, allowing the player {{to come to a}} solution without funneling them in a specific direction. The team designed puzzles based on general chemistry concepts without envisioning the specific solution that the player would take. They brainstormed a number of puzzles and then eliminated those with similar solutions, and arranged the others into a reasonable learning curve for the game. Despite this, Barth reflected that the <b>tutorials</b> provided to explain the game's mechanics had mixed responses, from some players who took up the concept easily to others that remained baffled as to the puzzle's goal even when instructions were set out step by step. In some cases, Barth discovered that players made assumptions on limitations of the game from these <b>tutorials</b> such as the idea that the red and blue waldos must remain in the separate halves of the screen. Based on the feedback that players had made on sites that hosted his previous Flash-based games, Barth designed the global-based histograms to allow players to check their solution without feeling overwhelmed by the top players as would be normally listed on a leaderboard. He also devised the means of sharing solutions through YouTube videos due to similar comments and discussions on the previous games.|$|E

40|$|<b>Tutorial</b> {{dialogue}} {{has been}} the subject of increasing attention in recent years, and it has become evident that empirical studies of human-human <b>tutorial</b> dialogue can contribute important insights to the design of computational models of dialogue. This paper reports on a corpus study of human-human <b>tutorial</b> dialogue transpiring in the course of problemsolving in a learning environment for introductory computer science. Analyses suggest that the choice of corrective <b>tutorial</b> strategy makes a significant difference in the outcomes of both student learning gains and selfefficacy gains. The findings reveal that <b>tutorial</b> strategies intended to maximize student motivational outcomes (e. g., self-efficacy gain) may not be the same strategies that maximize cognitive outcomes (i. e., learning gain). In light of recent findings that learner characteristics influence the structure of <b>tutorial</b> dialogue, we explore the importance of understanding the interaction between learner characteristics and <b>tutorial</b> dialogue strategy choice when designing <b>tutorial</b> dialogue systems. ...|$|R
