500|$|Darren Aronofsky and {{his friend}} Ari Handel created the story for The Fountain, and Aronofsky wrote the screenplay. When Aronofsky saw The Matrix in 1999, he {{considered}} it a film that redefined the science fiction genre. He sought to make a science fiction film that would explore new territory in the genre like The Matrix and its predecessors Star Wars and [...] Aronofsky had in mind a science fiction film that would go beyond the other films whose plots were driven by technology and science. The director said, [...] "We've seen it all. It's not really interesting to audiences anymore. <b>The</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>things</b> are the ideas; the search for God, the search for meaning." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Freedom" [...] was {{directed}} by Sean De Sparengo, and filmed in London in July 2011. It took one day to film, and is primarily set in an underground club with red lighting, reminiscent of that featured in the group's 2002 single [...] "Freak like Me". De Sparengo commented on the concept and visual attributes of the video, saying: [...] "One of <b>the</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>things</b> for the concept for this video is that {{we knew we had}} to make everything look incredibly beautiful. It was about making a video where the Sugababes felt like they were {{at the top of their}} game." [...] The video made its premiere in August 2011. A [...] clip was uploaded to the Sugababes official VEVO channel on YouTube. Daily Mirror praised the band's appearance in the video.|$|E

One of <b>the</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>things</b> {{about this}} chord (as {{described}} by Pedler) is how McCartney's high bass note reverberates inside the soundbox of Lennon's acoustic guitar {{and begins to}} be picked up on Lennon's microphone or pick-up during the sounding of the chord. This gives the chord its special [...] "wavy" [...] and unstable quality. Pedler describes the effect as a [...] "virtual pull-off".|$|E

60|$|As for Bulstrode--when Will {{was gone}} he {{suffered}} a violent reaction, and wept like a woman. It {{was the first time}} he had encountered an open expression of scorn from any man higher than Raffles; and with that scorn hurrying like venom through his system, there was no sensibility left to consolations. But the relief of weeping had to be checked. His wife and daughters soon came home from hearing the address of an Oriental missionary, and were full of regret that papa had not heard, in the first instance, <b>the</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>things</b> which they tried to repeat to him.|$|E

Her father happened to give an asylum in his office to a lonely old man, to whom 'Sister Rose' and her brother had been greatly indebted in the revolutionary time; and out of a train of circumstances connected with that, the first acquaintance between mademoiselle and the friend whose portrait she wears, arose. After the time of her father's bankruptcy, and for many years before we were placed under her charge, our good old governess lived entirely with 'Sister Rose' and her brother.

60|$|The {{simple truth}} is that these {{observations}} of mine, though they are all true, do not tell more than {{a small fraction of}} <b>the</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>things</b> that wild animals do continually in their native state, when they are not frightened by dogs and hunters, or when we are not blinded by our preconceived notions in watching them. I have no doubt that romancing is rife just now on the part of men who study animals in a library; but personally, with my note-books full of incidents which I have never yet recorded, I find the truth more interesting, and I cannot understand why a man should deliberately choose romance when he can have the greater joy of going into the wilderness to see with his own eyes and to understand with his own heart just how the animals live. One thing {{seems to me to be}} more and more certain: that we are only just beginning to understand wild animals, and it is chiefly our own barbarism, our lust of killing, our stupid stuffed specimens, and especially our prejudices which stand in the way of greater knowledge. Meanwhile the critic who asserts dogmatically what a wild animal will or will not do under certain conditions only proves how carelessly he has watched them and how little he has learned of Nature's infinite variety.|$|E
6000|$|With this question, however, we {{need not}} concern ourselves. To me, after {{stumbling}} by chance on the little church in that solitary woodland place, the story of its origin was accepted as true; no doubt it had come down unaltered {{from generation to generation}} through all those centuries, and it moved my pity yet was a delight to hear, as great perhaps as it had been to listen to the beautiful chimes many times multiplied from the wooded hill. And if I have a purpose in this book, which is without a purpose, a message to deliver and a lesson to teach, it is only this--the charm of the unknown, and the infinitely greater pleasure in discovering <b>the</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>things</b> for ourselves than in informing ourselves of them by reading. It is like the difference in flavour in wild fruits and all wild meats found and gathered by our own hands in wild places and that of the same prepared and put on the table for us. The ever-varying aspects of nature, of earth and sea and cloud, are a perpetual joy to the artist, who waits and watches for their appearance, who knows that sun and atmosphere have for him revelations without end. They come and go and mock his best efforts; he knows that his striving is in vain--that his weak hands and earthy pigments cannot reproduce these effects or express his feeling--that, as Leighton said, [...] "every picture is a subject thrown away." [...] But he has his joy none the less; it is in the pursuit and in the dream of capturing something illusive, mysterious, and inexpressibly beautiful.|$|E

6000|$|It {{would require}} a work equal in size to the [...] "Encyclopaedia Britannica" [...] to contain all <b>the</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>things</b> that were said and seen and done on those prairies by these trappers within that brief space of time. A conscientiously {{particular}} chronicler of events would have detailed the route of each day, the latitude and longitude of each resting-place, {{the very nature of}} the wood which composed the fuel of each fire. He would have recorded that March Marston's little bay ran away with him--not, in a general way, fifty or a hundred times, but exactly so many times, specifying the concomitant circumstances of each separate time, and the results of each particular race. He would have noted, with painful accuracy, the precise number of times in which Theodore Bertram (being a bad rider) fell off his horse, or was pitched off in consequence of that quadruped putting its foot inadvertently into badger holes. He would have mentioned that on each occasion the unfortunate artist blackened his eye, or bled or skinned his nasal organ, and would have dilated anatomically on the peculiar colour of the disfigured orb and the exact amount of damage done to the bruised nose. He would have told not only the general fact that bears, and elks, and antelopes, and prairie dogs, and wolves, and buffaloes, were seen in great numbers continually, and were shot in abundance, but he would have recorded that Bertram did, on one occasion, in the height of his enthusiastic daring, give a shout and draw one of his blunderbuss-pistols, on observing a grisly bear at a short distance ahead of him; that he dashed his heels violently against the sides of his remarkable horse; that the said horse did toss his head, shake his bottle-brush, and rush full tilt towards the bear until he caught sight of it, when he turned off at a sharp angle, leaving Bertram on the plain at the mercy of the bear; that Bruin, who was in nowise alarmed, observing his condition, came to see what was the matter with him; and that he, Mr Bertram, would certainly have fallen a victim to his own headstrong courage on the one hand, and to the bear's known tendency to rend human beings on the other, had not March come up at that moment and shot it through the heart, while Redhand shot it through the brain.|$|E
60|$|It {{seemed a}} strange speech, in the circumstances, but we barely noticed that, {{we were so}} shocked and grieved at the wanton murder he had committed--for murder it was, that was its true name, and it was without palliation or excuse, for the men had not wronged him in any way. It made us miserable, for we loved him, and had thought him so noble and so {{beautiful}} and gracious, and had honestly believed he was an angel; and to have him do this cruel thing--ah, it lowered him so, and we had had such pride in him. He went right on talking, just {{as if nothing had}} happened, telling about his travels, and <b>the</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>things</b> he had seen in the big worlds of our solar systems and of other solar systems far away in the remotenesses of space, and about the customs of the immortals that inhabit them, somehow fascinating us, enchanting us, charming us in spite of the pitiful scene that was now under our eyes, for the wives of the little dead men had found the crushed and shapeless bodies and were crying over them, and sobbing and lamenting, and a priest was kneeling there with his hands crossed upon his breast, praying; and crowds and crowds of pitying friends were massed about them, reverently uncovered, with their bare heads bowed, and many with the tears running down--a scene which Satan paid no attention to until the small noise of the weeping and praying began to annoy him, then he reached out and took the heavy board seat out of our swing and brought it down and mashed all those people into the earth just {{as if they had been}} flies, and went on talking just the same. An angel, and kill a priest! An angel who did not know how to do wrong, and yet destroys in cold blood hundreds of helpless poor men and women who had never done him any harm! It made us sick to see that awful deed, and to think that none of those poor creatures was prepared except the priest, for none of them had ever heard a mass or seen a church. And we were witnesses; we had seen these murders done and it was our duty to tell, and let the law take its course.|$|E
