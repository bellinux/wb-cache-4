5|$|The {{argument}} that destruction and terror {{are part of}} revolution I do not dispute. I {{know that in the}} past every great political and social change necessitated violence...Black slavery might still be a legalized institution in the United States but for the militant spirit of the John Browns. I have never denied <b>that</b> <b>violence</b> <b>is</b> inevitable, nor do I gainsay it now. Yet {{it is one thing to}} employ violence in combat, as a means of defense. It is quite another thing to make a principle of terrorism, to institutionalize it, to assign it the most vital place in the social struggle. Such terrorism begets counter-revolution and in turn itself becomes counter-revolutionary.|$|E
5|$|The video {{opens with}} the news of a fight {{circulating}} at a diner. This scene repeats itself at a pool hall, where gang members arrive via foot, forklift, and out of sewers, while the video's titular song begins to play. The camera cuts to a scene of Jackson lying on a bed, revealing he's the one singing contemplating the senseless violence. The singer notices rival gangs and leaves. Michael Jackson dons a red leather J. Parks brand jacket, and dances his way towards the fight through the diner and pool hall. A knife fight is taking place between the two gang leaders in a warehouse. They dance battle for an interlude of music until MJ arrives; the singer breaks up the fight and launches into a dance routine. The video ends with the gang members joining him in the dance, agreeing <b>that</b> <b>violence</b> <b>is</b> not the solution to their problems.|$|E

25|$|Still more pacifists {{would argue}} that a nonviolent {{reaction}} may not save lives immediately but would in the long run. The acceptance of violence for any reason {{makes it easier to}} use in other situations. Learning and committing to pacifism helps to send a message <b>that</b> <b>violence</b> <b>is,</b> in fact, not the most effective way. It can also help people to think more creatively and find more effective ways to stop violence without more violence.|$|E
25|$|According to Li, {{everything}} {{he has ever}} wanted {{to tell the world}} can be found in three of his films: the message of Hero is that the suffering of one person can never be as significant as the suffering of a nation; Unleashed shows <b>that</b> <b>violence</b> <b>is</b> never a solution; and Fearless tells that the biggest enemy of a person is himself. Li thinks that the greatest weapon is a smile and the largest power is love.|$|E
25|$|Fascists {{believe that}} liberal {{democracy}} is obsolete and they regard the complete mobilization of society under a totalitarian one-party state {{as necessary to}} prepare a nation for armed conflict and to respond effectively to economic difficulties. Such a state is led by a strong leader—such as a dictator and a martial government composed {{of the members of}} the governing fascist party—to forge national unity and maintain a stable and orderly society. Fascism rejects assertions <b>that</b> <b>violence</b> <b>is</b> automatically negative in nature and views political violence, war and imperialism as means that can achieve national rejuvenation. Fascists advocate a mixed economy, with the principal goal of achieving autarky through protectionist and interventionist economic policies.|$|E

25|$|The Peace Testimony is {{probably}} the best known testimony of Friends. The belief <b>that</b> <b>violence</b> <b>is</b> wrong has persisted to this day, and many conscientious objectors, advocates of non-violence and anti-war activists are Friends. Because of their peace testimony, Friends are considered as one of the historic peace churches. In 1947 Friends as a worldwide religious group were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, which was accepted by the American Friends Service Committee and the then London Yearly Meeting's Friends Service Committee, now called Britain Yearly Meeting Peace & Social Witness on behalf of all Friends. The Peace Testimony has not always been well received in the world; on many occasions Friends have been imprisoned for refusing to serve in military activities.|$|E

The Well-Manicured Man's suicide scene in the series' film adaptation went through several conceptual iterations, with outcomes being considered including an imploding car or suicide by concussion grenade, although ultimately a car bomb scene was decided upon.|$|E
500|$|His message {{late in life}} is {{contrary}} to the humanistic view of man as essentially good but easily corrupted. He seems to be saying <b>that</b> <b>violence</b> <b>is</b> innate in man, [...] "forged in the substance of what, since Freud, we have called the id." [...] Hughes believed that in the end there is only the violated emptiness of acceptance of our fallen nature: like the painting of Goya's dog, [...] "whose master is as absent from him as God is from Goya." ...|$|E

5000|$|Some union sympathizers believe <b>that</b> {{labor union}} <b>violence</b> <b>is</b> justified, {{especially}} when directed at strikebreakers.

Others believe <b>that,</b> although <b>violence</b> <b>is</b> wrong, it should be tolerated as an excess done for the greater good.

She tells them <b>that</b> <b>violence</b> <b>is</b> never the answer, [...] "but sometimes it is," [...] then chops Val behind the neck, rendering Val unconscious. Karen tells Grace to go get Vince, who {{was out of the}} room, while she gets [...] "rid" [...] of Val's body.|$|E

2500|$|Ernesto Che Guevara, Leon Trotsky, Frantz Fanon and Subhas Chandra Bose were fervent {{critics of}} nonviolence, arguing {{variously}} that nonviolence and pacifism are {{an attempt to}} impose the morals of the bourgeoisie upon the proletariat, <b>that</b> <b>violence</b> <b>is</b> a necessary accompaniment to revolutionary change or {{that the right to}} self-defense is fundamental.

2500|$|Professor Martha Mahoney, of the University of Miami School of Law, {{also points}} {{to the notion of}} “separation assault”—a {{phenomenon}} where a batterer further assaults a victim who is attempting or has attempted to leave an abusive relationship—as additional evidence that domestic violence is used to subordinate victims to their batterers. [...] A batterer’s unwillingness to allow the victim to leave the relationship substantiates the idea <b>that</b> <b>violence</b> <b>is</b> being used to force the victim to continue to fulfill the batterer’s wishes that she obey him. [...] Nonsubordination theorists argue that all of these actions—the variety of abusive behaviors and settings, exploiting the victim’s children, and assault upon separation—suggest a larger problem than merely an inability to properly manage anger, though anger may be a byproduct of these behaviors. [...] The purpose of these actions is to keep the victim, and sometimes the entire family, subordinate to the batterer, according to nonsubordination theory.|$|E
2500|$|The main {{theme of}} the gangster film The American Soldier (Der Amerikanische Soldat) is <b>that</b> <b>violence</b> <b>is</b> an {{expression}} of frustrated love. A sudden frenzied outburst of repressed passion, the revelation of desire and a need for love that has been thwarted and comes too late is central here. The eponymous hit man of the title (actually a German, played by Karl Scheydt) is a cold-blooded contract killer, who returns from Vietnam to his native Munich, where he is hired by three renegade policemen {{to do away with}} a number of undesirables. Eventually he ends up killing the girlfriend of one of the policemen with his friend Franz Walsh (Fassbinder). [...] The [...] film closes with the music of the song So much tenderness, [...] written by Fassbinder and sung by Gunther Kaufmann. The American Soldier is the third and final installment of Fassbinder's [...] loose trilogy of gangster pictures formed by Love is Colder Than Death and Gods of the Plague. It pays homage to the Hollywood gangster genre, it also alludes to Southern Gothic race narratives.|$|E
2500|$|The survey reveals [...] {{acceptance}} {{of some kind}} of intervention in domestic violence themes: 85% of interviewees responded that in cases of violence, the couple should divorce; [...] and over 90% agree that men that beat women should go to jail. The survey also shows that the Brazilian population is well informed regarding the origins of violence, 75% of interviewees disagree <b>that</b> <b>violence</b> <b>is</b> part of the male nature. However, There is evidence of widespread sexism, 58,5% of the interviewees believe that if women knew how to behave, there would be less rape cases and over 65% of interviewees agree [...] that women that use clothes that show their bodies deserve to be attacked. There is also evidence of the widespread belief that the victim of violence should be the one to take action against it as reported that 65,1% of the interviewees report that victims of domestic violence that don't leave the abusive partners, like to be beaten. This assumption ignores all the [...] social and psychological issues involved in an abusive relationship that may retrain a victim of domestic violence from reporting and leaving an abusive relationship. There are researches that propose a positive correlation between financial difficulties and violence: in scenarios of economical uncertainty and instability, the women is 1/3 more likely to be victim of domestic violence.|$|E
