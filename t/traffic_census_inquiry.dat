For the modeling process, a huge data inventory has been carried out, integrating the road geometry features, fatal accident records and <b>traffic</b> <b>censuses</b> from 3 selected states for the past 3 -year period. The results show that motorcycle fatalities per kilometer on primary roads are statistically significantly affected by the average daily number of motorcycles {{and the number of}} access points per kilometer. The model established for this study can also be regarded as the first motorcycle safety performance function in Malaysia and probably in Asia.

40|$|The {{need for}} {{acquiring}} the current-year traffic data {{is a problem}} for transport planners since such data may not be available for on-going transport studies. A method is proposed in this paper to predict hourly traffic flows up to and into the near future, using historical data collected from the Hong Kong Annual <b>Traffic</b> <b>Census</b> (ATC). Two parametric and two non-parametric models have been employed and evaluated in this study. The results show that the non-parametric models (Non-Parametric Regression (NPR) and Gaussian Maximum Likelihood (GML)) were more promising for predicting hourly traffic flows at the selected ATC station. Further analysis encompassing 87 ATC stations revealed that the NPR is likely to react to unexpected changes more effectively than the GML method, while the GML model performs better under steady traffic flows. Taking into consideration the dynamic nature of the common traffic patterns in Hong Kong and the advantages/disadvantages of the various models, the NPR model is recommended for predicting the hourly traffic flows in that region.

30|$|Regarding traffic data, Czech {{national}} <b>traffic</b> <b>census</b> covers most of {{the primary}} road network; however, {{it was observed that}} it does not include interchange ramps on motorways. Since this data is required for developing interchange models, manual traffic counts needed to be performed on all ramps of approx. 450 interchanges (in more than 1000 profiles). Each profile was observed for 2 [*]h of a working day and the results were factored up to AADT, using national guidelines [16].|$|R

30|$|Also on {{national}} roads, national <b>traffic</b> <b>census</b> data was found incomplete. AADT was missing on {{large number of}} minor roads, which intersect national roads – therefore {{it would not be}} possible to develop intersection models. Due to immense number of these intersections, it was not feasible to complement it with own survey. Therefore, simplified approach was taken, similar to the Norwegian practice [47] – i.e., not considering intersections with minor roads as individual units, but in terms of their frequency. Feasibility of this approach was previously tested in Czech conditions and found satisfactory [11].|$|R

These forecasts {{are based on}} the historical traffic count data provided by detectors installed on Annual <b>Traffic</b> <b>Census</b> (ATC) stations in Hong Kong. A traffic low simulator (TFS) is developed for short-term travel time forecasting (in terms of off-line forecasting), in which the variation of perceived travel time error and the fluctuations of origin-destination (O-D) demand are considered explicitly. On the basis of prior O-D demand and partial updated detector data, the TFS can estimate the link travel times and flows for the whole network together with their variances and covariances. The short-term travel time forecasting by O-D pair can also be assessed and the O-D matrix can be updated simultaneously. The application of the proposed off-line forecasting system is illustrated by a numerical example in Hong Kong. Department of Land Surveying and Geo-Informatic...|$|R
500|$|Traffic is {{regularly}} counted {{by means of}} a <b>traffic</b> <b>census</b> at toll stations and reported by Autocesta RijekaZagreb, the operator of the motorway, and published by Hrvatske ceste. The reported traffic volume exhibits no significant variations as the motorway chainage increases, and as it passes by various major destinations and the interchanges that serve them, except at the Vrata interchange, where traffic to and from Krk Island, Crikvenica, and Novi Vinodolski flows. The greatest volume of traffic is registered between Delnice and Vrata interchangeswith a 12,600-vehicle annual average daily traffic (AADT), and a 21,150-vehicle average summer daily traffic (ASDT) figure. Sections south of Kikovica interchange [...] likely carry substantial traffic volume as they serve Rijeka commuter traffic as well as the volume registered between the Oštrovica and Kikovica interchanges. However, no traffic volume figures are published for those sections, since motorway traffic is counted by means of toll ticket sales analyses, and the sections south of Kikovica interchange are not tolled.|$|R
40|$|Very {{little work}} using {{repeated}} cross-sectional data has been undertaken in transport research. This {{is especially true}} for travel data gathered at multiple points in time, especially data that is gathered every 5 - 10 years such as Urban Area Travel Survey Data and Road <b>Traffic</b> <b>Census</b> Data in Japan. Accordingly, travel demand modeling based on these types of data is not yet fully developed. This paper deals with methods for developing models which include time series factors for predicting travel demand using three time-points travel data gathered in Hiroshima. As a result, it was shown that model parameters based on cross-sectional data were not stable over time by using Covariance Analysis or T-Statistic. The existence of first-order serial correlation in residuals was confirmed by using Generalized Durbin-Watson Statistics, while unobserved heterogeneity was checked by using Breusch-Pagan Statistics. Fixed-effects models using these two factors were developed and it was shown that their predicting accu-racy was improved in comparison to traditional cross-sectional models. ...|$|R

40|$|The most {{up-to-date}} {{annual average}} daily traffic (AADT) is always required for transport model development and calibration. However, the current-year AADT data are not always available. The short-term traffic flow forecasting models {{can be used to}} predict the traffic flows for the current year. In this paper, two non-parametric models, non-parametric regression (NPR) and Gaussian maximum likelihood (GML), are chosen for short-term traffic forecasting based on historical data collected for the annual <b>traffic</b> <b>census</b> (ATC) in Hong Kong. These models are adapted as they are more flexible and efficient in forecasting the daily vehicular flows in the Hong Kong ATC core stations (in total of 87 stations). The daily vehicular flows predicted by these models are then used to calculate the AADT of the current year, 1999. The overall prediction and comparison results show that the NPR model produces better forecasts than the GML model using the ATC data in Hong Kong. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley _ Sons, Ltd. ...|$|R
