5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata in six movements, first alternating arias and recitative, then uniting <b>the</b> <b>voices</b> in recitative and aria, {{finally a}} chorale. The two soloists {{are supported by}} an intimate Baroque instrumental ensemble of oboe, strings and continuo. The oboe accompanies the soprano, a solo violin the bass, both play when <b>the</b> <b>voices</b> are united.|$|E
5|$|The vast {{movement}} has aspects {{of both a}} fugue and a ritornello movement. In the first fugal section, <b>the</b> <b>voices</b> enter in the sequence tenor, alto, soprano I, soprano II, bass, expanding from middle range to the extreme parts, just as the theme expands from the repeated first notes to sighing motives leading upwards. In the second fugal section, the instruments begin in low registers, and <b>the</b> <b>voices</b> build, with every part first in extremely low range, from bass to soprano I. In both sections, the instruments open the fugue, but play with <b>the</b> <b>voices</b> once they enter.|$|E

30|$|Another {{important}} part of <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> timbre differences {{between male and female}} voices seems to be <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> source: major difference is primarily in the amplitude of <b>the</b> fundamental. <b>The</b> <b>voice</b> spectrum of a male voice has a weaker fundamental than <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> spectrum of a female voice.|$|R

5|$|The section {{addressing}} God as Father and Son {{is again}} a duet, {{this time of}} soprano I and tenor. <b>The</b> <b>voices</b> are often in canon and in parallel, as in the Christe. The movement is likely another parody, possibly from the 1729 cantata Ihr Häuser des Himmels, BWV 193a. As the Christe, it is a love-duet addressing Jesus. Both duets appear {{as the center of}} the symmetry within the respective part, Kyrie and Gloria. Here an obbligato flute opens a concerto with the orchestra and introduces material that <b>the</b> <b>voices</b> pick up.|$|E

5|$|After the {{founding}} of Night School Studio, the team set up a casting call for voice actors on Backstage. Prior to actors being cast and their lines recorded, the team had placeholder subtitles in the game. Lead engineer Bryant Cannon recalled that without <b>the</b> <b>voices,</b> he was unsure whether the game {{would be fun to}} play; after <b>the</b> <b>voices</b> were added, he could see the characters as believable people having conversations. Hines directed recording sessions, allowing him to change dialogue on-the-fly if he felt material did not work when voiced by the actors. All of the actors voiced their lines separately, with their conversations in-game stitched together in post-production.|$|E
