5|$|Ancient Bengal was {{the site}} of several major janapadas. In the 2ndcentury BCE, <b>the</b> <b>region</b> <b>was</b> conquered by the emperor Ashoka.

The British East India Company cemented their hold on the region following the Battle of Plassey in 1757, and Calcutta served for many years as the capital of British India. The early and prolonged exposure to British administration resulted in an expansion of Western education, culminating in developments in science, institutional education, and social reforms in the region, including {{what became known as the}} Bengal Renaissance. A hotbed of the Indian independence movement through the early 20thcentury, Bengal was divided during India's independence in 1947 along religious lines into two separate entities: West Bengala state of Indiaand East Bengalthe part of the newly created nation of Pakistan that later became Bangladesh. Between 1977 and 2011 the state was administered by the world's longest elected Communist government.|$|E
