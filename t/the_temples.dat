Despite this, in 1582, resistance elements again recaptured Torigoe and Futoge.

5|$|Temples, {{where the}} state rituals were carried out, were filled with images of the gods. The most {{important}} temple image was the cult statue in the inner sanctuary. These statues were usually less than life-size, and made of the same precious materials that were said to form the gods' bodies. Many temples had several sanctuaries, each with a cult statue representing one of the gods in a group such as a family triad. The city's primary god was envisioned as its lord, employing many of the residents as servants in the divine household that the temple represented. The gods residing in <b>the</b> <b>temples</b> of Egypt collectively represented the entire pantheon. But many deities—including some important gods {{as well as those}} that were minor or hostile—were never given temples of their own, although some were represented in <b>the</b> <b>temples</b> of other gods.|$|E
50|$|Women {{in large}} numbers did not visit <b>the</b> <b>temple,</b> due to <b>the</b> {{hardship}} in reaching <b>the</b> <b>temple.</b> Women pilgrims above the age of 50 would visit <b>the</b> <b>temple</b> to conduct <b>the</b> first rice-feeding ceremony of their children (Chottoonu) in <b>the</b> <b>temple</b> premises.

5|$|The Badami cave temples {{represent}} some of {{the earliest}} known examples of Hindu temples in the Deccan region.

5|$|The royal {{administration}} could also order one temple to divert its resources to another temple whose influence it wished to expand. Thus, a king might increase {{the income of}} <b>the</b> <b>temples</b> of a god he favored, and mortuary temples of recent rulers tended to siphon off resources from temples to pharaohs long dead. The most drastic means of controlling the temple estates was to completely revise the distribution of their property nationwide, which might extend to closing down certain temples. Such changes could significantly alter Egypt's economic landscape. <b>The</b> <b>temples</b> were thus important instruments with which the king managed the nation's resources and its people. As the direct overseers of their own economic sphere, the administrations of large temples wielded considerable influence and may have posed {{a challenge to the}} authority of a weak pharaoh, although it is unclear how independent they were.|$|E
5|$|Another {{element of}} the Vijayanagara style is the carving and consecration of large monoliths such as the Sasivekaalu (mustard) Ganesha and Kadalekaalu (ground nut) Ganesha at Hampi, the Gommateshwara (Bahubali) monoliths in Karkala and Venur, and the Nandi bull in Lepakshi. The Vijayanagara temples of Kolar, Kanakagiri, Sringeri and other towns of Karnataka; <b>the</b> <b>temples</b> of Tadpatri, Lepakshi, Ahobilam, Tirumala Venkateswara Temple and Srikalahasti in Andhra Pradesh; and <b>the</b> <b>temples</b> of Vellore, Kumbakonam, Kanchi and Srirangam in Tamil Nadu are {{examples}} of this style. Vijayanagara art includes wall-paintings such as the Dashavatara and Girijakalyana (marriage of Parvati, Shiva's consort) in the Virupaksha Temple at Hampi, the Shivapurana murals (tales of Shiva) at the Virabhadra temple at Lepakshi, and those at the Kamaakshi and Varadaraja temples at Kanchi. This mingling of the South Indian styles resulted in a richness not seen in earlier centuries, a focus on reliefs in addition to sculpture that surpasses that previously in India.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>temple</b> is {{believed}} to have been expanded during the Medieval Cholas and Vijayanagar kings. <b>The</b> <b>temple</b> has inscriptions on its walls dating from the period of Rajaraja Chola III (1223 CE).

5|$|As Antoine {{decided to}} model Antoinist {{holidays}} on Catholicism, followers celebrate Christian holidays, including All Saints, Christmas, Easter, Easter Monday and Ascension; these days, appropriate portions of Antoine's works are read during the services. There are also three special days in Antoinism, and attendance at worship is generally higher at these moments: (1) 25 June, the Father's Day. It {{was established by}} Antoine's wife shortly after his death. At first, from 1913, all <b>the</b> <b>temples</b> except the one in Jemeppe were closed {{that day in the}} purpose that followers came to attend the ceremony in that city. So many Antoinists performed a pilgrimage to Jemeppe-sur-Meuse to participate in a procession through the city which outlined the main events of Antoine's life. The procession was withdrawn in 1937 and the pilgrimage seems to be no longer organized. That day, the faithful pay homage to the founder in <b>the</b> <b>temples.</b> (2) 15 August, the consecration of the temple's Day, which commemorates the consecration of the first temple. In 1911, on that day, the General Operation took place at the temple, then the ceremony continued into a public hall, which shocked followers; therefore, the following year, the whole ceremony took place exclusively in the temple. (3) 3 November, the Mother's Day, as anniversary of Catherine's death.|$|E

He planned to dig a canal through the Isthmus of Corinth in Greece and sent a chief centurion to survey the work.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} Third Intermediate Period, Old Kingdom {{mortuary}} temples enjoyed {{a revival of}} interest due primarily to the archaizing style favoured by the kings of the Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt (c. 760–656 BCE). In particular, Taharqa (fl. c. 690–664 BCE) had reliefs from <b>the</b> <b>temples</b> of Sahure, Nyuserre and Pepi II reproduced in the temple of Amun of Gem-Aten in Karnak during his restoration works there.|$|E
