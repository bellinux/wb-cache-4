40|$|Predation on Illex argentinus (Cephalopoda, Ommastrephidae) in {{southern}} Brazil (26 °S to 34 °S) was studied from {{its presence in}} contents of over 14 000 stomachs from 63 potential predator species including fishes, cephalopods, penguins and marine mammals. The size composition of I. argentinus in the diet of their main predators was estimated using regression equations that relate mantle length and body weight to beak size. The short-finned squid {{was found in the}} diet of 32 species and appears {{to play an important role}} in the trophic relations along the upper slope and adjacent oceanic waters, where it was found in the diet of the swordfish Xiphias gladius, the tunas <b>Thunnus</b> obesus, T. <b>alalunga</b> and T. albacares, and the wreckfish Polyprion americanus. These five species stand for more than half of the landings from the upper slope demersal and oceanic pelagic fisheries in the region. On the shelf, where the dominant squid was Loligo sanpaulensis, Illex argentinus was only occasionally found in the diet of a few neritic predators. In southern Brazil, overall predation was more intense on subadults and adults of the winter-spring spawning group on the upper slope and oceanic adjacent waters, differently from its southern range along Uruguay and Argentina waters where the short-finned squid is abundant on the shelf and is preyed upon mainly by the demersal fish assemblage...|$|R
40|$|Critical gaps in our {{understanding}} of the distributions, interactions, life histories and preferred habitats of large and medium-size pelagic fishes severely constrain the implementation of ecosystem-based, spatially structured fisheries management approaches. In particular, spawning distributions and the environmental characteristics associated with the early life stages are poorly documented. In this study, we consider the diversity, assemblages, and associated habitat of the larvae of large and medium-sized pelagic species collected during 2 years of monthly surveys across the Straits of Florida. In total, 36 taxa and 14, 295 individuals were collected, with the highest diversity occurring during the summer and in the western, frontal region of the Florida Current. Only a few species (e. g. <b>Thunnus</b> obesus, T. <b>alalunga,</b> Tetrapturus pfluegeri) considered for this study were absent. Small scombrids (e. g. T. atlanticus, Katsuwonus pelamis, Auxis spp.) and gempylids dominated the catch and were orders of magnitude more abundant than many of the rare species (e. g. Thunnus thynnus, Kajikia albida). Both constrained (CCA) and unconstrained (NMDS) multivariate analyses revealed a number of species groupings including: (1) a summer Florida edge assemblage (e. g. Auxis spp., Euthynnus alleterattus, Istiophorus platypterus); (2) a summer offshore assemblage (e. g. Makaira nigricans, T. atlanticus, Ruvettus pretiosus, Lampris guttatus); (3) an ubiquitous assemblage (e. g. K. pelamis, Coryphaena hippurus, Xiphias gladius); and (4) a spring/winter assemblage that was widely dispersed in space (e. g. trachipterids). The primary environmental factors associated with these assemblages were sea-surface temperature (highest in summer-early fall), day length (highest in early summer), thermocline depth (shallowest on the Florida side) and fluorescence (highest on the Florida side). Overall, {{the results of this study}} provide insights into how a remarkable diversity of pelagic species spatially and temporally partition spawning within a region that is characterized by dynamic oceanography and strong habitat gradients...|$|R

5000|$|Escolar is {{commonly}} substituted for tuna in sushi restaurants. Escolar, {{which is much}} less expensive than tuna, is a fish with a diet high in wax esters. Since these wax esters are not digestible, these wax esters have a laxative effect in humans. [...] The laxative effect is not merely an inconvenience, but can be very serious. Although not affecting all people, the wax esters are indigestible in humans and to those susceptible can cause constipation, followed by severe oily diarrhea (keriorrhoea), rapid loose bowel movements, with onset 30 minutes to 36 hours after consumption. [...] In fact, the FDA recommends, [...] "Escolar should not be marketed in interstate commerce" [...] and the Hawaiian Legislature is considering legislation to ban escolar for the same reasons. [...] However, multiple {{studies have shown that}} a sushi restaurant advertising a [...] "white tuna" [...] {{is more likely to be}} selling escolar than any fish allowed to be labeled as [...] "tuna" [...] according to the FDA., [...] In the US, ‘white tuna’ is identified as albacore tuna (<b>Thunnus</b> <b>alalunga)</b> by the US Food and Drug Administration.|$|E
50|$|The Strait of Messina is an {{important}} migratory route of the Mediterranean Sea. The best known and important, from an economic point of view, are the great pelagic fish - that is the Tuna (Thunnus thynnus), the Albacore (<b>Thunnus</b> <b>alalunga),</b> the Atlantic bonito (Sarda sarda), the Mediterranean Spearfish (Tetrapturus belone) and the Swordfish (Xiphias gladius). The fish of the Strait are captured with boats called feluche or small engine powered fishing boats called passerelle. These pelagic fish are assets unique {{to this part of}} the Mediterranean Sea. Moreover, only in the Strait, using various techniques, it is possible to capture Tuna throughout the year and in all age classes (from juveniles to adults) as the population moves between the Tyrrhenian and the Ionian Seas. The Strait of Messina is also an established route for the migration of Cetacea, and it is probably the most important in the Mediterranean Sea in terms of whale species diversity. Worthy of note, besides the several species of Dolphins are the Fin Whale (Balaenoptera physalus) and particularly the Sperm Whales which migrate to the Strait to their breeding area, probably the Aeolian Islands. Sharks also migrate through the Strait of Messina, including the Great White Shark (Carcharodon carcharias) and the Bluntnose Sixgill Shark (Hexanchus griseus).|$|E

40|$|New tools from {{cell and}} {{molecular}} biology {{can be used}} to implement the knowledge of fish biology and fisheries. In this sense, we suggest that the use of lectins can be an understandable procedure to study population structure of fishes. Lectins are proteins or glycoproteins of non-immune origin that agglutinate cells and/or precipitate complex carbohydrates. Several lectins behave like blood group antibodies and can be used as specific gene markers. We characterise blood groups of <b>Thunnus</b> <b>alalunga</b> worldwide populations under a population genetics point of view using lectins. Fishes from several populations of Mediterranean Sea, Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans were captured and 5 mL blood was obtained from each fish. Each fish was treated with 8 FITC-labelled lectins. The binding activity of the lectins was detected using a fluorescence assay. Several statistical procedures of populations genetics were employed to analyse genetic variability, geographic differentiation, and genetic distance showing that: i) there is genetic variability within <b>Thunnus</b> <b>alalunga</b> populations, ii) we detect highly significant heterogeneity among populations, and considerable geographic differentiation, iii) Mediterranean population is quite distant of North Atlantic population, iv) North and South Atlantic populations are extremely distant, v) Pacific population is the most distant from th...|$|E
