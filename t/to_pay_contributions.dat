50|$|The {{cost of the}} {{voluntary}} units at Bermuda was originally covered by annual stipends to the Bermuda government, from the War Office.

50|$|From {{the time}} when the village was ﬁrst settled until the 16th century, no Hachenbach inhabitants’ names are known. The ﬁrst known names {{appeared}} in a 1542 taxation roll from the Waldgraviate-Rhinegraviate of the Eßweiler Tal. Written there are ten names, likely householders’. A 1586 building directory names 14 Rauchhaber (literally “smoke havers”, that is, people who have a hearth, and therefore a household) who had <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>contributions</b> in kind. It can be assumed that in 1609, some 80 or 90 people lived in Hachenbach. A 1743 document is the oldest full directory of inhabitants that is still preserved. There were then 87 souls and 20 hearths in Hachenbach. Of the 307 inhabitants in Hachenbach in 1998, 30% were more than 70 years old.|$|E

2500|$|Public {{employee}} pensions: The approved 2010 budget delays {{payments to}} the pension fund, effectively borrowing $620million from the fund while promising to start repaying in 2013 with 7.5% interest. The budget also increases the retirement age for new hires, and recalculates benefits for new hires. New hires will also have <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> a 5% <b>contribution</b> <b>to</b> the pension. However, the state will continue <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for employee <b>contributions</b> for current employees. A separate bill, HB 610 sponsored by Harry R.

5000|$|The scheme {{has been}} {{controversial}} since its inception. Upon its implementation one news site {{described it as}} having been subjected to a [...] "barrage of criticisms from the public". [...] However, {{because all of the}} major political parties in the British Virgin Islands supported the scheme, there has been very little debate over the proposals and progress towards the scheme has continued despite changes in Government. Nonetheless, the strong criticisms have been voiced in relation to the proposals, including the relatively expensive cost of the insurance compared to the private sector, the relatively low lifetime cap (and that a person will continue having <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>contributions</b> after they hit the lifetime cap), and questions regarding the validity of Government statistics which were used to justify the introduction of the scheme. [...] Doubts have also been expressed whether the limited staff and resources will be able to handle the estimated 200,000 claims each year.|$|E
50|$|Deimberg {{lay in the}} Nahegau, but {{was founded}} {{relatively}} late, likely in the 11th or 12th century. Theoretically, {{there is the possibility}} that there had formerly been another village at this same spot called Steinbäch(e)l, even before Deimberg’s founding. This has since vanished. In 1336, Deimberg had its first documentary mention in a listing of those who were liable <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>contributions</b> to Saint Valentine’s Church (Valentinskirche) in Niedereisenbach (today a constituent community of Glanbrücken). The actual Latin text states: “Item Petrus dictus Geyst de Dimberg et Jutta sua legitima dimidiam libram cerae super agrum dictum Hezzilsbirchen” (“Petrus, called Geyst from Dimberg and his wife Jutta had to deliver half a pound of grain harvested on the field called Hezzilsbirchen”), thus mentioning the village as Dimberg. By “pound”, used here to translate libram (an accusative case form; the nominative case would be libra), the reader is to understand “amount that could be weighed on a big scale”, for this is apparently how the word was understood in the 14th century.|$|E
50|$|In the meantime, the European {{balance of}} power had shifted in favour of France which gained pre-eminence. It set an {{aggressive}} territorial expansion in motion with a new phase of wars. Preparations became visible when the fortress of Philippsburg, in French hands, was enforced. In 1661, Landau was annexed by France and fortified; the French annexed the Duchy of Lorraine in 1670 and Strassburg in 1681. The Franco-Dutch War, in which France aimed to annex the Spanish Netherlands, brought destruction to the Palatinate and Germerheim, thus pretty close to Speyer. In negotiations with the French, the city managed to remain neutral. The Palatinate could not accept Speyer's neutrality; it occupied nearby Dudenhofen in 1676, the watch towers of the landwehr and the suburb of Hasenpfuhl, thus putting pressure on the city. In the same year, an imperial army recaptured Philippsburg. In 1683, Speyer again had <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>contributions</b> to the empire because of a renewed threat in the southeast by the Turks this time supported by the French. The Turkish threat enabled the French to expand their borders towards the Rhine without any resistance by the empire.|$|E
50|$|Employees and {{employers}} <b>pay</b> <b>contributions</b> according <b>to</b> a complex classification based on employment type and income. Class 1 (employed persons) NIC is charged at several rates depending on various income thresholds {{and a number}} of other factors including age, the type of occupational pension scheme contributed to by the employee and/or employer and whether or not the employee is an ocean-going mariner. Certain married women who opted <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> reduced <b>contributions</b> (in return for reduced benefits) prior to 1977 retain this right for historical reasons.|$|R

5000|$|The ECJ {{recommended}} that the Belgian government have an independent body to approve phone specifications, because {{it was wrong to}} have the state company both making phones and setting standards. RTT's market was opened to competition. An interesting aspect of the case was that the ECJ interpreted the effect of RTT's exclusive power as an [...] "abuse" [...] of its dominant position, so no abusive [...] "action" [...] as such by RTT needed to take place. The issue was further considered in Albany International Albany was a textile company, which found a cheap pension provider for its employees. It refused <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>contributions</b> to the [...] "Textile Trade Industry Fund", which the state had given the exclusive right to. Albany argued that the scheme was contrary to EU Competition law. The ECJ ruled that the scheme infringed then Article 86(1), as [...] "undertakings are unable to entrust the management of such a pension scheme to a single insurer and the resulting restriction of competition derives directly from the exclusive right conferred on the sectoral pension fund." [...] But the scheme was justified under then Article 86(2), being a service of general economic interest.|$|E
50|$|In 1793, French Revolutionary troops {{took over}} the Lordship of Reipoltskirchen and thereby the village of Relsberg, too. The populace was made <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>contributions.</b> In 1799, France {{dissolved}} all the old lordships and thereby the Lordship of Reipoltskirchen, too. Within the French First Republic, Relsberg now belonged to the Mairie (“Mayoralty”) of Hefersweiler, the Canton of Wolfstein, the Arrondissement of Kaiserslautern and the Department of Mont-Tonnerre (or Donnersberg in German). After the reconquest of the German lands on the Rhine’s left bank in 1814 by Prussian, Austrian and Russian troops, the Congress of Vienna drew new boundaries yet again. After a transitional time, Relsberg was grouped into the bayerischer Rheinkreis, later known as Rheinpfalz (“Rhenish Palatinate”), an exclave of the Kingdom of Bavaria in 1816. Relsberg then found itself in the canton of the Landcommissariat of Kusel and the Bürgermeisterei (“Mayoralty”) of Hefersweiler. In the late 1920s and early 1930s, the Nazi Party (NSDAP) became very popular in Relsberg. In the 1928 Reichstag elections, 61% of the local votes went to Adolf Hitler’s party, but by the 1930 Reichstag elections, this had grown to 90%. By {{the time of the}} 1933 Reichstag elections, after Hitler had already seized power, local support for the Nazis had swollen to a full 100%. This level of support was matched in very few other places in the area. Hitler’s success in these elections paved the way for his Enabling Act of 1933 (Ermächtigungsgesetz), thus starting the Third Reich in earnest. The village stayed with Bavaria {{until the end of the}} Second World War, when it became part of the Federal Republic of Germany within the then newly founded state of Rhineland-Palatinate. In the course of administrative restructuring in this state in 1968, Relsberg became an Ortsgemeinde within the Verbandsgemeinde of Wolfstein and the Kusel district in 1972.|$|E
5000|$|In the United States, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) {{includes}} both employer and individual mandates that take effect in 2014. The PPACA's employer mandate requires that all businesses with 50 or more full-time employees provide minimum affordable {{health insurance to}} at least 95% of their full-time employees and dependents up to age 26, or pay a fee by 2016. In the two largest EU countries, France and Germany, Statutory Health Insurance (SHI) mandates employers and employees pay into statutory sickness funds. In France, private health insurance (PHI) is voluntary and used to increase the reimbursement rate from the statutory sickness system. The same applies in Germany where {{it is also possible}} to opt out of SHI if you are a very high earner and into a PHI but if a person has reached the age of 55 and is in the PHI sector he or she must remain covered by PHI and cannot opt back into SHI. Persons who are unemployed can usually continue their payments through social insurance and the very poor receive support from the government to be insured. Most workers are insured through compulsory membership of [...] "sickness funds" [...] that are non-profit entities established originally by trades unions and now given statutory status. In Germany and France, {{as is the case with}} most European health care finance, the personal contribution to health care financing varies according to a person's income level and not according to their health status. Only 0.2% of Germans are uninsured, mainly self-employed, rich and poor, and persons who have failed <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>contributions</b> to the statutory insurance or premiums to the private health insurance. Between 1990 and 2000 the share of French SHI income coming directly from employees via salaries fell from around 30% to just 3% and employer direct contributions also fell. The difference was made up by a rise in income from government taxation, thus widening the mandatory contribution base to the health insurance system.|$|E

30|$|Building on {{existing}} arrangements may prove beneficial also for finding financial {{sources for the}} program. One of the main stumbling blocks for the introduction of an UI program is the objection of employers <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>contributions</b> to the program. To minimize additional contributions the UI program imposes, one option is to partly redirect training levy contributions. This path was chosen by Mauritius: when introducing a new UI program in 2009, it imposed a one percent contribution rate on employers while, at the same time, reduced their training levy contribution rate by half a percent (the training fund had been grossly underutilized).|$|E
30|$|Perception {{matters for}} human behaviour. Reforming {{pensions}} {{was necessary to}} help workers understand that they participated in the pension system, not – as commonly perceived {{under the rule of}} the old system – from the moment of retirement, but from the moment of first registered employment. In the old system the employers were obliged <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>contributions</b> for their employees. However, the legal obligation to pay is not equivalent with the economic notion of financing contributions. That concept is clear for economists, but not for the general public, so workers commonly ignored the cost of contributions – they thought that they did not pay.|$|E

50|$|Defined benefit {{plans are}} {{sometimes}} criticized as being paternalistic as they enable employers or plan trustees {{to make decisions}} about the type of benefits and family structures and lifestyles of their employees. However they are typically more valuable than defined contribution plans in most circumstances and for most employees (mainly because the employer tends <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> higher <b>contributions</b> than under defined contribution plans), so such criticism is rarely harsh.|$|R
