This was replaced in the 1970s.

The station was established during the 1894 {{construction of the}} end of the trolley line and was near the Devil's Den <b>trolley</b> <b>siding,</b> south of the trolley's Warren Avenue crossing, and northeast of the Plum Run trolley bridge. An uphill trail led southwest to Big Round Top with its 1895 Observation Tower, and the [...] "Slaughter Pen Path and Steps" [...] were built to Devil's Den.|$|R

50|$|The Red Devils {{were among}} the first {{lightweight}} interurban <b>trolleys</b> with <b>side</b> plates of aluminum. They had a toilet, luggage compartment, and up to 44 seats. The construction had some weaknesses. The riveting of aluminum plates to a steel frame produced an electrolytic reaction that gave rise to corrosion in the side panels and the front and rear dashers. The C&LE replaced some of the aluminum plates with steel. The cars featured Art deco styling and a distinctive bright red paint scheme. Half of the cars were outfitted as parlor cars with first class seating.|$|R

The {{remaining}} trolley routes from Manchester car house (6, 13, 14, 18 and 19) were moved to Keating in 1959. The final North <b>Side</b> <b>trolleys</b> (6/14 and 21) were transferred to South Hills Car House in 1965 and the facility became the bus-only Ross Garage.|$|R

50|$|The East <b>Side</b> <b>Trolley</b> Tunnel is {{a tunnel}} in Providence, Rhode Island, {{originally}} built for trolley use in 1914, and now used for public transit buses. It runs for 2000 feet (600 meters) under College Hill on Providence's East Side, with its west end at South Main Street and its east end at Thayer Street. Prior {{to the construction}} of the Trolley Tunnel, the steepness of the streets climbing College Hill led to construction of the only cable-car system ever to be built in New England.|$|R
5000|$|He and {{the station}} foreman tried frantically {{to clear the}} trolley off the line as the signals were already set for the 19:15 London St Pancras to Manchester express {{to pass through the}} station non-stop. A train at the up {{platform}} prevented them simply moving the trolley onto the up-line, and {{it was not possible to}} lift the c [...] hundredweight (230kg) trolley 2 ft to get it back onto the platform. They attempted to get the <b>trolley</b> on its <b>side</b> in the [...] "six-foot" [...] between the two lines, but did not succeed and had to jump for their lives as the express neared.|$|R
5|$|Kennedy Plaza, in {{downtown}} Providence, {{serves as a}} transportation hub for local public transit {{as well as a}} departure point for Peter Pan and Greyhound bus lines. Public transit is managed by Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA). Through RIPTA alone Kennedy Plaza serves over 71,000 people a day. The majority of the area covered by RIPTA is served by traditional buses. Of particular note is the East <b>Side</b> <b>Trolley</b> Tunnel running under College Hill, the use of which is reserved for RIPTA buses. RIPTA also operates the Providence LINK, a system of tourist trolleys {{in downtown}} Providence. From 2000 to 2008, RIPTA operated a seasonal ferry to Newport between May and October. In 2016 SeaStreak began operating the Providence – Newport ferry route. RIPTA began a rapid bus service called the R Line in June 2014.|$|R
5000|$|Street {{marketing}} uses unconventional {{means of}} advertising or promoting products and brands in public areas with the main goal to encourage consumers to remember and recall the brand or product marketed. As a division of guerrilla marketing, street marketing is specific to all marketing activities carried out in streets and public areas such as parks, streets, events etc. Street marketing {{is not limited to}} areas as it also encompasses advertising outdoors such as on shopping <b>trolleys,</b> public toilets, <b>sides</b> of cars or public transport, manhole covers, footpaths, rubbish bins etc. Street marketing isn’t confined to fixed advertisements. It is common practice for organisations to utilise brand ambassadors who can distribute product samples and discount vouchers and answer queries about the product while emphasizing the brand. The brand ambassadors may be accompanied by a bicycle kiosk which contains the product samples or demonstration materials, or they may be wearing a [...] "walking billboard". The physical interaction with consumers has a greater influencing power than traditional passive advertising.|$|R
500|$|Victor Lewis-Smith {{reviewed}} the restaurant for The Guardian in 2005, {{thought that a}} spring onion risotto accompaniment to a pan fried seabass tasted so good {{that it would have}} been sufficient as a main course itself and was also quite pleased that crêpe suzette was served on a <b>trolley</b> for table <b>side</b> service. Claire Ogden visited the restaurant for the Metro newspaper shortly after it was first awarded a Michelin star in 2007. She thought that a John Dory main course was [...] "pristine", and overall thought that the star was well deserved. The only negative thing she had to say about the experience was a toffee foam served on top of a pear granita which she described as [...] "flimsy-flavoured". It was named the best restaurant in Britain by Les Routiers later that year. The critic from the Western Mail stated in 2008 that [...] "the menu is short and to the point, with around five choices for each course. The wine list is huge, an insurmountable challenge for me but another's utopia." [...] However, he remarked that the main course was [...] "genuinely brilliant food" [...] and deserving of its Michelin star.|$|R
50|$|The trolley {{problem is}} a thought {{experiment}} in ethics. The general form {{of the problem is}} this:There is a runaway trolley barreling down the railway tracks. Ahead, on the tracks, there are five people tied up and unable to move. The trolley is headed straight for them. You are standing some distance off in the train yard, next to a lever. If you pull this lever, the trolley will switch to a different set of tracks. However, you notice that there is one person on the side track. You have two options:# Do nothing, and the trolley kills the five people on the main track.# Pull the lever, diverting the <b>trolley</b> onto the <b>side</b> track where it will kill one person.Which is the most ethical choice?The modern form of the problem was first introduced by Philippa Foot in 1967, but also extensively analysed by Judith Thomson, Frances Kamm, and Peter Unger. However an earlier version, in which the one person to be sacrificed on the track was the switchman's child, was part of a moral questionnaire given to undergraduates at the University of Wisconsin in 1905, and the German legal scholar Hans Welzel discussed a similar problem in 1951.|$|R

50|$|Trolleys {{arriving}} at this station travel between 69th Street Terminal in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania and Orange Street in Media, Pennsylvania. As {{part of a}} major line renovation project in 2010 the shelter at the stop was re-roofed and painted, and a metal bench and platform plantings were added, providing passengers a pleasant waiting area and shelter from the elements. It also has free parking. However these are facilities of Smedley Park, rather than of SEPTA. No elevated platforms exist at this station. Unlike most stops along Route 101 in Springfield, the Paper Mill Road stop is located along a section of single track that takes the line through wooded parkland west from Woodland Avenue to the western limit of the township (the Crum Creek Bridge) and {{a few hundred yards}} further into Nether Providence Township. Like station stops at Woodland Avenue, Thomson Road, Springfield Mall, and Bowling Green, passengers enter and leave the <b>trolleys</b> from the <b>side</b> of the single-track line where the shelter stands. At an isolated turnout in wooded Smedley Park in Nether Providence Township west of Paper Mill Road Station and east of Pine Ridge Station, the line again becomes double-tracked for the stretch to the Media town border at Bowling Green Station.|$|R
