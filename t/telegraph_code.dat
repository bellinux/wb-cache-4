25|$|Despite the {{addition}} of new head entries to the second edition, Giles kept the original 13,848 numerical arrangement owing to an unintended consequence (1912: viii). People in China were using the dictionary numbers as a Chinese <b>telegraph</b> <b>code,</b> that is, a character encoding index for telegraphs written in Chinese characters—analogous with modern Chinese input methods for computers. Another example of using Giles' 13,848 numbers to index characters is Vernon Nash's (1936) Trindex: an Index to Three Dictionaries or San zidian yinde 三字典引得, for A Chinese-English Dictionary, (1711) Peiwen Yunfu rime dictionary, and (1716) Kangxi Dictionary.|$|E
25|$|The Four-Corner Method {{was invented}} in the 1920s by Wang Yunwu (王雲五), {{the editor in chief}} at Commercial Press Ltd., China. Its {{development}} was based mainly on contributions by the Russian scholar Otto Rosenberg in the early 20th century, as well as experiments by Lin Yutang and others. Its original purpose was to aid telegraphers in looking up Chinese <b>telegraph</b> <b>code</b> (CST) numbers in use at that time from long lists of characters. This was mentioned by Wang Yunwu in an introductory pamphlet called Sijiaohaoma Jianzifa in 1926. Introductory essays for this pamphlet were written by Cai Yuanpei and Hu Shi.|$|E
2500|$|For Chinese, Chinese <b>telegraph</b> <b>code</b> {{is used to}} map Chinese {{characters}} to four-digit codes and send these digits out using standard Morse code. [...] uses the SKATS mapping, originally developed to allow Korean to be typed on western typewriters. SKATS maps hangul {{characters to}} arbitrary letters of the Latin script and has no relationship to pronunciation in Korean. For Russian and Bulgarian, Russian Morse code is used to map the Cyrillic characters to four-element codes. Many of the characters are encoded the same way (A, O, E, I, T, M, N, R, K, etc.). Bulgarian alphabet contains 30 characters, which exactly match all possible combinations of 1, 2, 3, and 4 dots and dashes. Russian requires 1 extra character, [...] "Ы" [...] which is encoded with 5 elements.|$|E

60|$|The {{time has}} gone {{as quickly as}} work can effect since I saw my Lady. As I told the mountaineers, Rooke, whom I had sent on the service, had made a {{contract}} for fifty thousand Ingis-Malbron rifles, and as many tons of ammunition as the French experts calculated to be a full supply for a year of warfare. I heard from him by our secret <b>telegraph</b> <b>code</b> that the order had been completed, and that the goods were already on the way. The morning after the meeting at the Flagstaff I had word that at night the vessel--one chartered by Rooke for the purpose--would arrive at Vissarion during the night. We were all expectation. I had always now in the Castle a signalling party, the signals being renewed {{as fast as the}} men were sufficiently expert to proceed with their practice alone or in groups. We hoped that every fighting-man in the country would in time become an expert signaller. Beyond these, again, we have always a few priests. The Church of the country is a militant Church; its priests are soldiers, its Bishops commanders. But they all serve wherever the battle most needs them. Naturally they, as men of brains, are quicker at learning than the average mountaineers; with the result that they learnt the code and the signalling almost by instinct. We have now at least one such expert in each community of them, and shortly the priests alone will be able to signal, if need be, for the nation; thus releasing for active service the merely fighting-man. The men at present with me I took into confidence as to the vessel's arrival, and we were all ready for work when the man on the lookout at the Flagstaff sent word that a vessel without lights was creeping in towards shore. We all assembled on the rocky edge of the creek, and saw her steal up the creek and gain the shelter of the harbour. When this had been effected, we ran out the boom which protects the opening, and after that the great armoured sliding-gates which Uncle Roger had himself had made so as to protect the harbour in case of need.|$|E

Western Union Telephone Company, in which a wool dealer argued that an error by a Western Union telegrapher cost $20,000 due to misread instructions. The Supreme Court subsequently ruled Western Union was liable only for the cost of the message, $1.15.|$|R

50|$|The {{compromise}} solution that was eventually found and developed into Unicode was {{to break the}} assumption (dating back to <b>telegraph</b> <b>codes)</b> that each character should always directly correspond to a particular sequence of bits. Instead, characters would first be mapped to a universal intermediate representation {{in the form of}} abstract numbers called code points. Code points would then be represented {{in a variety of ways}} and with various default numbers of bits per character (code units) depending on context. To encode code points higher than the length of the code unit, such as above 256 for 8-bit units, the solution was to implement variable-width encodings where an escape sequence would signal that subsequent bits should be parsed as a higher code point.|$|R

50|$|Technical {{obsolescence}} usually {{occurs when}} a new product or technology supersedes the old, and it becomes preferred {{to use the new}} technology in place of the old.

On a smaller scale, particular products may become obsolete due to replacement by a newer version of the product. Many products in the computer industry become obsolete in this manner; for example, Central processing units frequently become obsolete in favor of newer, faster units. Singularly, rapid obsolescence of data formats along with their supporting hardware and software can lead to loss of critical information, a process known as digital obsolescence.|$|R
