5|$|Since eliminative materialism {{claims that}} future {{research}} {{will fail to}} find a neuronal basis for various mental phenomena, it must necessarily wait for science to progress further.

For example, he viewed morality as a natural outgrowth of instincts that were beneficial to animals living in social groups. He argued that all the differences between humans and apes were explained by a combination of the selective pressures that came from our ancestors moving from the trees to the plains, and sexual selection. The debate over human origins, and over the degree of human uniqueness continued well into the 20th century.|$|E

5|$|Where is <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> located? If <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> is a {{physical}} phenomenon of some kind, {{it has to be}} located somewhere.

5|$|The idea of Żydokomuna {{continued}} to endure {{to a certain}} extent in postwar Poland (1944–1956), because Polish anti-communists saw the Soviet-controlled Communist regime as the fruition of prewar anti-Polish agitation; with it came the implication of Jewish responsibility. The Soviet appointments of Jews to positions responsible for oppressing the populace further fueled this perception. Some 37.1% of post-war management of UB employees and members of the communist authorities in Poland were of Jewish origin. They were described in intelligence reports as very loyal to the Soviets (Szwagrzyk). Some Polish historians have impugned the loyalty of Jews returning to Poland from the USSR after the Soviet takeover, which has raised the specter of Żydokomuna in <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> of other scholars.|$|E
5|$|The {{novel is}} a {{combination}} of fact and fiction.

Some characters are fictional, and those that are non-fictional still have fictionalized aspects in the book. The general details of the assassination are true, and the assassins are all real people.
