5|$|Allie Young, {{chairman}} of the state Democratic Party, called a caucus of the Democratic members of the General Assembly to be held on January 1, 1900. As {{a result of the}} caucus, J. C. S. Blackburn was nominated for a seat in the U. S. Senate, Goebel was nominated as president pro tem of the Kentucky Senate, and South Trimble was nominated as speaker of the House. When the General Assembly convened, each Democratic nominee was elected, the party possessing heavy majorities in both houses. Lieutenant Governor Marshall presented a list of committees to the Senate, but <b>that</b> <b>body</b> voted 19–17 to set aside this list and approve a list provided by Goebel instead. Similarly, in the House, the list of committees presented by Speaker Trimble and approved by <b>that</b> <b>body</b> enumerated forty committees, none of them with a Republican majority.|$|E

40|$|Leibniz holds <b>that</b> <b>bodies</b> are {{phenomena}}, {{and that}} phenomena have their being in perceiving substances. After summarizing {{the evidence for}} ascribing this mentalistic conception of phenomenon to Leibniz, I argue that this conception coheres with three of his other doctrines of body: (1) <b>that</b> <b>bodies</b> presuppose unities or simple substances; (2) <b>that</b> <b>bodies</b> are aggregates of such substances; and (3) <b>that</b> <b>bodies</b> derive or borrow their reality from their simple constituents...|$|R
50|$|C. Contrary to what Descartes argues, we {{are certain}} <b>that</b> <b>bodies</b> exist/that {{perception}} coincides with reality (5th, 6th), {{but we are}} not certain <b>that</b> the <b>bodies</b> of our perception are actual bodies in an existent external world.|$|R

5|$|A {{coalition}} {{of civil rights}} groups began a court challenge of the bill in Indiana state courts, and the Daniels' administration defended {{the government in the}} case. The Indiana Supreme Court ruled in favor of the state in late 2007. The petitioners appealed the bill to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, and <b>that</b> <b>body</b> upheld the State Supreme Court decision in the case of Crawford v. Marion County Election Board. Upon appeal the United States Supreme Court also ruled in favor of the state in April 2008, setting a legal precedent. Several other states subsequently enacted similar laws in the years following.|$|E
5|$|After peak intensity, Chapala {{skirted the}} Yemeni island of Socotra on 1November. Drier air and {{increased}} wind shear weakened the cyclone, although it maintained {{much of its}} intensity upon entering the Gulf of Aden on 2November, becoming the strongest known cyclone in <b>that</b> <b>body</b> of water. After bypassing northern Somalia, Chapala weakened further {{and turned to the}} west-northwest. Early on 3November, the storm made landfall near Mukalla, Yemen, as a very severe cyclonic storm, making it the strongest storm on record to strike the nation. The storm dissipated the next day.|$|E
5|$|After the {{convention}} many Conservative Democrats, though not happy at Tillman's victory, acknowledged him {{as head of}} the state party. Those who submitted to Tillman's rule included Hampton and Butler, the state's two U.S. senators. In his campaign, Tillman promoted support for Clemson, establishment of a state women's college, reapportionment of the state legislature (then dominated by the lowcountry counties), and ending the influence of corporation lawyers in <b>that</b> <b>body.</b>|$|E

2500|$|So {{long as the}} {{separate}} art of music had a real organic life-need in it [...] {{there was nowhere to}} be found a Jewish composer.... Only when a body’s inner death is manifest, do outside elements win the power of lodgement in it—yet merely to destroy it. Then, indeed, <b>that</b> <b>body’s</b> flesh dissolves into a swarming colony of insect life: but who in looking on <b>that</b> <b>body’s</b> self, would hold it still for living? ...|$|R

5|$|After this defeat, Wetherby {{moved to}} Franklin County and secured a {{position}} at Brighton Engineering with help from his old primary opponent, Bill May. From 1964 to 1966, he was a delegate to an assembly charged with revising the state constitution. In 1965, May backed Wetherby in his campaign for the Kentucky Senate. He won the election, defeating the candidate favored by Chandler, and was chosen president of <b>that</b> <b>body</b> from 1966 to 1968. He was so effective in this position that the state's 1966 budget was debated for only ten days before passing {{by a vote of}} 31–5 in virtually the same form as it was presented.|$|E
5|$|Alberta uses a unicameral Westminster-style {{parliamentary}} government, {{in which}} the premier {{is the leader of}} the party that controls the most seats in the Legislative Assembly. The premier is Alberta's head of government, while the Queen of Canada in right of Alberta is its head of state and is represented by the Lieutenant Governor of Alberta. The premier picks a cabinet, usually from the elected members of the Legislative Assembly, to form the Executive Council of Alberta, and presides over <b>that</b> <b>body.</b>|$|E

50|$|Of Dumbleton’s many {{scientific}} theories {{there is}} one in particular that is worth mentioning here. By making the assumption <b>that</b> <b>bodies</b> are finite, Dumbleton was able to conjecture that contraction or expansion, as in cases of condensation or rarefaction, does not eliminate any parts of a body; rather, a “denumerable number of parts” always exists. Though the idea of molecules was not theorized at this time, Dumbleton’s speculation helped to tame the view <b>that</b> <b>bodies</b> have infinitely divisible parts.|$|R
5|$|Clements {{was elected}} to the Kentucky Senate in 1941, {{representing}} Union, Webster, and Henderson counties. By 1944, he had risen to the post of majority leader in <b>that</b> <b>body</b> and {{played a central role in}} writing the state's budget that year. Due to Clements' efforts, educational appropriations were increased far above what had been called for by Republican governor Simeon Willis.|$|E
5|$|Croatian {{authorities}} {{suspect that}} a further 61 individuals killed at Ovčara were buried there as well. They suspect {{one or more}} additional mass graves exist in the general area, or that the bodies originally buried at the site were moved to a secondary grave. Nevenka Nekić, the Croatian {{author of a book}} on Nicolier, claims that an additional shallow grave was excavated at Ovčara in November 1991 and that Nicolier and 60 others were buried there. According to her, they were exhumed by Croatian Serb authorities and moved to a secondary location in early 1992 because the grave was so shallow <b>that</b> <b>body</b> parts protruded through the ground surface.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, Jones' {{political}} career began with his election as a Republican to the West Virginia House of Delegates. He {{was the youngest}} person ever elected to <b>that</b> <b>body.</b> In 1966, he {{was chosen as the}} Republican floor leader in the House. In 1968, Jones announced that he would not seek re-election to his seat, despite facing no opposition. Among the factors influencing his decision was his perception of corruption in state politics.|$|E

5|$|Of the film's net profit, {{estimated}} to amount to $30–40million (£20–25million) from the cinema release alone, roughly 20% will be split between Geoffrey Rush (as executive producer), Tom Hooper and Colin Firth, who receive their bonuses {{before the other}} stakeholders. The remaining profit is to be split equally between the producers and the equity investors. The UK Film Council invested £1million of public funds from the United Kingdom lottery into the film. In March 2011 Variety estimated that the return could be between fifteen and twenty times that. The Council's merger into the British Film Institute means that the profits are {{to be returned to}} <b>that</b> <b>body.</b>|$|E

6000|$|In {{the same}} way, {{a law of}} nature, in the {{scientific}} sense, {{is the product of}} a mental operation upon the facts of nature which come under our observation, and has no more existence outside the mind than {253} colour has. The law of gravitation is a statement of the manner in which experience shows <b>that</b> <b>bodies,</b> which are free to move, do, in fact, move towards one another. But the other facts of observation, <b>that</b> <b>bodies</b> are not always moving in this fashion, and sometimes move in a contrary direction, are implied in the words [...] "free to move." [...] If it is a law of nature <b>that</b> <b>bodies</b> tend to move towards one another in a certain way; it is another and no less true law of nature <b>that,</b> if <b>bodies</b> are not free to move as they tend to do, either in consequence of an obstacle, or of a contrary impulse from some other source of energy than that to which we give the name of gravitation, they either stop still, or go another way.|$|R
