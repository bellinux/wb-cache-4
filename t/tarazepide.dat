40|$|Background: Different {{routes of}} {{administration}} of CCK- 33 and blockage of CCK-A and muscarinic (m(3)) receptors {{are used in}} this study to evaluate the mechanisms by which cholecystokinin can stimulate the exocrine pancreas. Methods: The experiment was performed on eight anaesthetized pigs during control conditions and after administration of the CCK-A and m(3) receptor antagonists, <b>Tarazepide</b> and 4 -DAMP, respectively. Catheters were surgically implanted in the pancreatic duct for juice collection and in the gastric and right gastro-epipoic arteries and in the jugular vein, so that infusions of CCK- 33 could be made exclusively to the duodenum/stomach, duodenum/pancreas or general circulation, respectively. Results: Infusion of a low dose of CCK- 33 (13 pmol kg(- 1)) to the general circulation did not affect pancreatic protein or trypsin output. When the same dose was given directly to the duodenum/stomach or the duodenum/pancreas, pancreatic output increased during both control conditions and after <b>Tarazepide</b> and/or 4 -DAMP treatment, though the increase in trypsin Output was lower after <b>Tarazepide</b> and/or 4 -DAMP blockade. A high dose of CCK- 33 (130 pmol kg(- 1)) given peripherally stimulated the pancreatic secretion, but this response was totally abolished in <b>Tarazepide</b> and 4 -Damp treated animals. Conclusions: Pancreatic enzyme secretion due to CCK- 33 stimulation depends on the presence of short duodenal-pancreatic peptidergic reflexes evoked mainly via low sensitive, probably CCK-B, receptors located in the duodenum/stomach. Pancreatic secretion evoked by peripheral CCK- 33 in pharmacological doses was independent Of m(3) receptors blockade but depended on CCK-A receptors located elsewhere than in the duodenum/pancreas...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} three {{different}} drugs for different applications {{have been investigated}} for their physical features. The production of these nanosuspensions was performed by high pressure homogenisation. The particle size analyses have been performed by laser diffraction and photon correlation spectroscopy. Additional characterisation have been done by zeta potential investigations and x-ray-diffraction. The drug <b>Tarazepide,</b> a CCK 1 receptor antagonist, used for gastric disorders, was created as nanosuspension for i. v. administration. Different production opportunities were investigated to achieve a sterile nanosuspension. Especially the mean particle size, particle size distribution and physical long term stability were investigated. Budesonid is a corticosteroid mainly used in asthma therapy. With this drug the possibilities to create nanosuspensions for inhalation was investigated. Therefor the drug was composed with additives generally used for inhalation and the feature when nebulising the nanosuspension. To determine the increase of the dissolution velocity and increase of saturation solubility of nanosuspensions versus microsuspensions in general budesonid nano- and micorsuspensions were investigated on these features. They have been investigated after different time points of storage. Budesonid was also taken to investigate the impact of different homogenisation pressure applied to the suspension and the achieved particle size due to different pressures. Not only different homogenization pressures had been applied but also various models of high pressure homogenisers have been applied. Buparvaquone is a naphtoquinone, that is an effective treatment against the pathogen Cryptosporidium parvum. It is applied orally, and for this application created as nanosuspension. Buparvaquone was created as nanosuspension incorporated into hydrogels to further increase the mucoadhesive properties of the drug. The particle size and physical long-term stability of nanosuspensions and the nanosuspension-hydrogel systems were investigated. Also the surface charge was determined by zeta potential analysis. The increase of the efficacy by creating buparvaquon as nanosuspension and further improvement by incorporation of the nanosuspenions into hydrogel systems was shown in this study...|$|E
40|$|The {{regulation}} of the exocrine pancreas has been under thorough investigation for many decades. In rats, cholecystokinin (CCK) {{is considered to be}} the major gut hormone stimulating the pancreas to releasing the digestive enzymes. CCK acts directly via CCK-A receptors in the pancreas, or through receptors located on the vagal afferents and stimulating the secretion via the cholinergic vagal efferents. The {{regulation of}} the pancreas in pigs, as studied in this thesis, appears to be more complex, since the pancreatic acinar cells in pigs do not possess CCK-receptors and CCK given to the general circulation, in doses mimicking physiological levels, fail to stimulate exocrine secretion. However, in experiments where similar physiological doses of CCK have been given directly to the duodenal circulation, pancreatic enzyme secretion was stimulated. The major aim of this thesis was to clarify the role of CCK in the {{regulation of the}} exocrine pancreas in pigs and to determine the role and location of the CCK receptors. This was done by using directed local or general administration of CCK, in catheterised weaned pigs and CCK receptor blockers. The effect of the duodenal infusion of vegetable oils differing in their fatty acid composition, on the food-stimulated exocrine pancreatic secretion was also studied in chronically catheterised pigs. In addition, the possibility of inducing the maturation of the exocrine pancreas in suckling piglets, by enteral exposure to kidney bean lectin, was investigated. The results implied that CCK is involved in the regulation of the exocrine pancreas in pigs. Using the CCK-A receptor blocker, <b>Tarazepide,</b> and the CCK-B receptor blocker, YF 476, it was determined that there were no functional CCK-A receptors in the pancreas or duodenum; instead the CCK-A receptors were located elsewhere and only acted at supraphysiological doses of CCK. The results suggested that the stimulating effect of CCK is probably mediated by CCK-B receptors located in the duodenum, with the effect on the exocrine pancreas being mediated via short entero-pancreatic reflexes. The major change obtained after the duodenal administration of vegetable oils, having different fatty acid profiles, was a decrease in the volume while the enzyme secretion was unaffected after infusion with olive oil, and an elevated colipase output after infusion with coconut oil. Treatment of 10 -day old suckling pigs with a preparation of kidney bean lectins for three days led to a significant enhancement of the fluid secretion, the protein output, and the output of the enzymes, trypsin and amylase during CCK-stimulation in comparison to that observed in the control littermates. In addition, the basal plasma insulin levels were reduced after the lectin-treatment. The results suggested that there was an increased capacity for pancreatic enzyme secretion in the lectin-treated suckling piglets. Such increased pancreatic function might ameliorate the difficulties that may appear in modern pig production associated with abrupt weaning...|$|E
