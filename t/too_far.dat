5|$|The {{system was}} impractical. The Hamburg air defence {{district}} controlled both air and ground defences, but each was geographically {{in no position}} to help the other. There was no combined arms synthesis, meaning that the FlaK arm did not directly support the German defences thereby forming one mass defence. Instead, fighter units protecting the coast were held there, with Kriegsmarine FlaK units, while the Hamburg air defence artillery was held <b>too</b> <b>far</b> inland. The Luftwaffe fighters and FlaK units were located <b>too</b> <b>far</b> apart to coordinate.|$|E

I have {{no doubt}} that this zazou style {{originated}} in a desire to defy the forces of occupation and the austerity of Vichy. For lack of other materials, feathers and veils, promoted to the dignity of flags, floated through Paris like revolutionary banners. But as a fashion I found it repellent." ...|$|R

50|$|So in all {{the years}} that Arnold Odermatt had spent using his {{photographs}} correctly to establish the facts of cases for the judicial and insurance purposes, there must have been another element at work - an artistic independence within this photographic practice: a surplus. From the very beginning, these photographs were <b>far</b> <b>too</b> good, <b>far</b> <b>too</b> nuanced, <b>far</b> <b>too</b> skilfully and scenically cut at the edges making them very aesthetic. In short, they were <b>far</b> <b>too</b> good to be used by the police. This surplus, this status of them being 'far-too-good' for their functional purpose, conceals the comedy of the photography of Arnold Odermatt. You have to imagine: there’s a crash, everyone is running all over the place, sirens wail, the police arrive - and one person is standing there calmly taking artistic pictures that will transmit this image miles away. It’s an image that will last long after the insurance company has paid out and the drink-drivers have been given their driving licences back, for example.|$|R
5|$|Although {{the crew}} {{were eager to}} get to Guaymas as soon as possible, it was <b>too</b> <b>far</b> for a single day's journey, so {{the next day they}} put in at Puerto San Carlos, where they collected. Early the next morning they made the short run to Guaymas.|$|E
5|$|In {{the opening}} scene of the episode, Horace the {{bartender}} is suddenly knocked unconscious after falling off a ladder, causing Death to appear. After it is discovered that Horace is not actually dead, Death complains that he never likes to be <b>too</b> <b>far</b> from journalist Mike Wallace. Wallace was still alive as of the original airing date.|$|E

[...] As well as the emotional pain of retiring from football at age 24, it also left Canovile in financial peril as he had eight children by 1988.|$|R
5000|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Way Too Far" [...] premiered on May 7, 2012, and was {{directed}} by Joshua Allen, who also directed the previous music video for [...] "Chaos Lives in Everything".

5|$|The feint {{party was}} {{composed}} of 150 volunteers who ran into the hollow way and began to engage the British.

5|$|The {{range of}} the {{original}} ages was also a problem, as the rate of Kula-Farallon spreading over that time would produce a chain of seamounts much longer than observed, and <b>too</b> <b>far</b> away from the continent to explain the continentally derived sediments. This objection is attenuated somewhat in that the newer ages show a smaller range of ages.|$|E
5|$|Within the Philippines, PAGASA issued {{no public}} storm warning signals, {{as the storm}} was <b>too</b> <b>far</b> away from the country to prompt the {{issuance}} of such advisories.

5|$|At the Port of San Francisco, Steilberg {{inspected}} each {{shipment of}} stones, several thousand crates in all. The Haslett warehouse, between Fisherman's Wharf and the Hyde Street Pier, {{was used for}} storage. With groundbreaking set for July 1931 and the last freighter carrying stones still in transit, Hearst stopped his grand plan for Wyntoon because his fortunes were <b>too</b> <b>far</b> reduced from the Great Depression. The stones stayed in the warehouse, incurring annual storage fees of $15,000 in 1930s dollars.|$|E

5|$|By April, the {{prospect}} for filming parts of Thor in Del Mar, California had fallen through. Paramount Pictures {{sent a letter}} informing the city that it has instead chosen an undisclosed Northern California location to film a beachfront scene for the film.

5|$|Currently Silverthrone is not {{monitored}} closely {{enough by}} the Geological Survey of Canada to ascertain how active the volcano's magma system is. The existing network of seismographs {{has been established}} to monitor tectonic earthquakes and is <b>too</b> <b>far</b> away to provide a good indication {{of what is happening}} beneath the caldera. It may sense an increase in activity if the volcano becomes very restless, but this may only provide a warning for a large eruption. It might detect activity only after the volcano has started erupting.|$|E
5|$|For {{reasons that}} remain obscure, the planet's {{thermosphere}} {{is at an}} anomalously high temperature of about 750K. The planet is <b>too</b> <b>far</b> from the Sun for this heat to be generated by ultraviolet radiation. One candidate for a heating mechanism is atmospheric interaction with ions in the planet's magnetic field. Other candidates are gravity waves from the interior that dissipate in the atmosphere. The thermosphere contains traces {{of carbon dioxide and}} water, which may have been deposited from external sources such as meteorites and dust.|$|E
