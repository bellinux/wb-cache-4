40|$|AbstractDiabetic foot ulcer {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{complications}} caused due to Diabetes Mellitus. Elevation of blood sugar level above normal conditions causes several vascular problems (constriction of blood vessels) which lead to improper circulation of blood to the feet.

30|$|In this configuration, {{the inner}} tube {{sits in a}} double-bottom {{electromagnetic}} potential well. The depth of the potential well under electrode 1 is proportional to <b>the</b> <b>voltage</b> applied to electrode 1; similarly, {{the depth of the}} potential well under electrode 2 is proportional to <b>the</b> <b>voltage</b> applied to electrode 2. The induced quasi-static electromagnetic forces exerted on the inner tube will overcome interlayer friction if <b>the</b> applied <b>voltage</b> is sufficiently large. This large applied voltage is referred to as <b>the</b> WRITE <b>voltage.</b> When a WRITE voltage is applied to the electrode, the inner tube may move due to the induced electromagnetic forces [14, 15]. Consequently, lateral motion of the inner tube will be induced as a result. Here, a capped outer tube is employed because the inner tube can easily escape from an open outer tube due to the induced electromagnetic forces. The capacitance of the NEMS gate can be read by a distinct READ process. A constant-current pulse is applied to one of the electrodes. If the inner CNT is present under that electrode, a relatively large capacitance will be observed, and the time required to charge the electrode will be longer. If the inner tube is not present under that electrode, a relatively small capacitance will be observed, as will a concomitant fast charging time for the electrode. As a result, the logic state of the NEMS gate can be determined. It should be noted that all <b>READ</b> <b>voltages</b> are sufficiently small so that the motion of the inner tube will not be influenced. Less than 5 % of <b>the</b> WRITE <b>voltage</b> is recommended for <b>the</b> <b>READ</b> <b>voltage.</b> Whether <b>the</b> inner tube is underneath electrode 1 or electrode 2 will result in two different physical states determined by <b>the</b> <b>READ</b> <b>voltage.</b> These two different physical states can be interpreted as Boolean logic states. Therefore, the system {{can be used as a}} random access memory (RAM) cell. It should be noted that Kang and Hwang [16] proposed the similar NEMS design, called ‘Carbon nanotube shuttle’ memory device. However, our design is more specific, and we quantitatively illustrate the proposed design as SRAM and DRAM cells. In addition, the continuum model developed in this paper will help to study feasibility of large nanotube-based memory cells in practical applications.|$|R

Besides, patients who need to do self test often need to refer to the procedures and storing surrounding condition which can be hassle to some people with language restriction. Alternatively, using non-invasive will not be wasteful and the measurement or reading can be done any time and numbers of time. Previously, many researches had been done on non-invasive using near-infrared sensing. From previous research by Sia, he had investigated near-infrared sensing using signal penetrating finger method. However, by using finger penetration, there are no results obtained. He only obtained signal using glucose concentration. Therefore the objectives of this research are to investigate the performance of three different wavelength of sensors; infrared 940 nm and infrared 950 nm and also nearinfrared 1450 nm. Sensor that gave the best output had been chosen to achieve the second objective of this project which is to design non-invasive blood glucose measurement device based on optical sensing and to develop prototype of a blood glucose optical sensing instrumentation with acceptable accuracy and repeatability. Generally, the overall system consists of three parts including sensor part, signal conditioning circuit, and also numerical display. The initial design tested by considering initial voltage 1. 616 Vto 1. 68 V which referred to previous research by Sia as the output of the sensor. Then proceed by using test tube which contains various percentage of glucose concentration. The same methods had been used to the human samples fingers instead of test tube. From the experiment, output graph of the 950 nm shows more consistent pattern compared to the 940 nm. 950 nm also has a larger range scale for voltage which from 5. 016 V to 5. 4633 V compare to <b>the</b> 940 nm <b>voltage</b> range scale which from 5. 0327 V to 5. 4201 V. Further test on human finger had been done by using 950 nm infrared but <b>the</b> output <b>voltages</b> were too small. The performance of the measurement can be improved by controlling the surrounding condition and fixed the path length between transmitter and receiver. Test using test tube showed that the near infrared and infrared were capable to predict different glucose concentration. By comparing the performance of infrared and near-infrared, near-infrared gave better performance since near-infrared had higher output voltage range which from 0. 6 to 3. 417 4 V compared to infrared. Graph near- infrared output <b>voltage</b> shows that <b>the</b> <b>voltage</b> is almost directly proportional to the percentage of glucose concentrations. By using circuit designed, {{it can be seen that}} <b>the</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>reading</b> became higher compared to before meal which shows that there were increment in glucose reading from before to after meal. Therefore, it can be concluded that the circuit design functions accordingly and non-invasively. During human sample test, increment pattern can be seen from fasting to non-fasting condition but the main effect is all samples have different fingers' diameter which each of user needs to be calibrated...|$|R
