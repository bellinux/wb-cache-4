25|$|In the {{multiplayer}} modes 'Survival of the Fittest', 'Civil War', and 'Turf War', a Big Daddy suit will spawn at {{a random}} {{location in the}} level. The choice {{is given to the}} player who finds this suit to become the Big Daddy, which will give the player greater strength and endurance but prohibits the use of plasmids and hacking, as well as expelling any previously held damage bonuses against other players. The Big Daddy can stomp, shoot a rivet gun, melee attack, and throw proximity mines. All damage dealt to the Big Daddy is permanent, and cannot be replenished. Once the Big Daddy is defeated, the suit disappears and spawns in another location on the map two minutes later. In 'Capture the Sister' one member of the defending team is chosen at random <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Daddy; after the player's death, the Big Daddy suit disappears {{for the rest of the}} round.|$|E

500|$|By {{the end of}} 1997, Be Here Now {{had sold}} eight million units worldwide. However, the sales volume was largely gained {{in the first two}} weeks of release, and once the album was {{released}} to UK radio stations the turnover tapered off. Buyers realised that the album was not another (What's the Story) Morning Glory?, and by 1999, Melody Maker reported that it was the album most sold to second-hand record stores. In the 2003 John Dower-directed documentary , music critic Jon Savage pinpointed Be Here Now as the moment where the Britpop movement ended. Savage said that while the album [...] "isn't the great disaster that everybody says", he noted that [...] "t was supposed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>big,</b> big triumphal record" [...] of the period. Q expressed similar sentiments, writing, [...] "So colossally did Be Here Now fall short of expectations that it killed Britpop and ushered in an era of more ambitious, less overblown music". Irish Times journalist Brian Boyd wrote: [...] "Bloated and over-heated (much like the band themselves at the time), the album has all that dreadful braggadocio that is so characteristic of a cocaine user." [...] Reflecting in 2007, Garry Mulholland admitted, [...] "the fact that nothing could have lived up to the fevered expectations that surrounded its release doesn't change the facts. The third Oasis album is a loud, lumbering noise signifying nothing." ...|$|E
2500|$|In general, {{landslides}} generate displacements {{mainly in}} the shallower parts of the coastline, and there is conjecture {{about the nature of}} large landslides that enter water. [...] This has been shown to subsequently affect water in enclosed bays and lakes, but a landslide large enough to cause a transoceanic tsunami has not occurred within recorded history. Susceptible locations are believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Island of Hawaii, Fogo in the Cape Verde Islands, La Reunion in the Indian Ocean, and Cumbre Vieja on the island of La Palma in the Canary Islands; along with other volcanic ocean islands. This is because large masses of relatively unconsolidated volcanic material occurs on the flanks and in some cases detachment planes are believed to be developing. However, there is growing controversy about how dangerous these slopes actually are.|$|E

She observed a [...] "big old change" [...] and viewers could finally see her heart amongst the evil. She became friendlier {{as a result}} of mothering Curtis and writers ensured Grace had more comedy about her character. She dreams of a normal life even though it is not achievable for her given her past. She can be [...] "a little bit of a freak" [...] in her pursuit of the perfect family life, but ultimately Wall believed Grace would never get her [...] "happily ever after". Wall enjoyed the complexities of Grace, adding [...] "the best thing about her is that I still get <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> evil baddie who’s not very nice, but at the same time, I get to be funny and I get to have a love story." [...] Kirkwood later said that the newly family oriented Grace [...] "will be fighting for love and loyalty rather than bags of money." ...|$|E
2500|$|Oasis' {{third album}} Be Here Now (1997) was highly anticipated. Despite {{initially}} attracting positive reviews and selling strongly, the record was soon subjected to strong criticism from music critics, record-buyers and even Noel Gallagher himself for its overproduced and bloated sound. Music critic Jon Savage pinpointed Be Here Now as the moment where Britpop ended; Savage {{said that while}} the album [...] "isn't the great disaster that everybody says," [...] he noted that [...] "t was supposed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>big,</b> big triumphal record" [...] of the period. At the same time, Damon Albarn sought to distance Blur from Britpop with the band's self-titled fifth album, Blur (1997). On guitarist Graham Coxon's suggestion, Blur moved away from their Parklife-era sound, and their music began to assimilate American lo-fi influences, particularly that of Pavement. Albarn explained to the NME in January 1997 that [...] "We created a movement: as far as the lineage of British bands goes, there'll always be a place for us", but added, [...] "We genuinely started to see that world in a slightly different way." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 12 August 2008, Ralph Peters {{wrote that}} he was [...] "seeing the {{emergence}} of a rogue military power with a nuclear arsenal". Russia made it clear that it would not tolerate freedom and self-rule in its neighbours. Russian air force had been trying unsuccessfully to hit the gas pipeline running from the Caspian Sea to the Mediterranean. The Kremlin gave a signal to Europe that it not only had the power to turn off Siberian gas, it could turn off every tap in the region any time. Peters wrote: [...] "Any soldier above the grade of private can tell you that there’s absolutely no way Moscow could have launched this huge ground, air and sea offensive in an instantaneous “response” to alleged Georgian actions." [...] Even to get one armored brigade over the Caucasus Mountains needed extensive preparations. Russia (working through its mercenaries in South Ossetia) was staging brutal provocations against Georgia beginning from late July 2008. Peters compared the Russian attack on Georgia to Hitler’s march into Czechoslovakia. The war in Georgia was supposed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> debut for the Kremlin’s revitalized armed forces (funded by the new petroleum-generated wealth), but the war unintentionally revealed many of enduring Russian weaknesses.|$|E

2500|$|Suzuki joined Sega in 1983 as a programmer. In {{his first}} year, {{he created a}} 2D boxing game called Champion Boxing for Sega's first home game console, the SG-1000. According to Suzuki, the {{executive}} staff at Sega found the game so impressive that they released it in arcades as-is by simply installing an SG-1000 into an arcade cabinet. He was promoted to project leader while still {{in his first year}} at the company. Then, Suzuki began working on another arcade game which would prove <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> stepping-off point of his career. [...] "To develop this game," [...] Suzuki told G4TV, [...] "I rode on motorcycles a lot. [...] When we came up with the prototype (for the arcades), I would ride on that prototype bike for hours and hours every day." [...] His efforts culminated into the game Hang-On, released in 1985. Hang-On was a success as it broke new ground in arcade technology. It did not feature any traditional controls, as the movement of the on-screen avatar was dictated by the movements the player made with their body on the motorcycle cabinet. This began the [...] "Taikan" [...] trend, the use of motion-controlled hydraulic arcade cabinets in many arcade games of the late 1980s, two decades before motion controls became popular on video game consoles. Running on the Sega Space Harrier hardware, it was also the first of Sega's [...] "Super Scaler" [...] arcade system boards that allowed three-dimensional sprite/texture-scaling at high frame rates. The three-dimensional sprite/tile scaling was handled in a similar manner to textures in later texture-mapped polygonal 3D games of the 1990s. Suzuki stated that his [...] "designs were always 3D from the beginning. All the calculations in the system were 3D, even from Hang-On. I calculated the position, scale, and zoom rate in 3D and converted it backwards to 2D. So I was always thinking in 3D." ...|$|E
2500|$|Great Falls {{quickly became}} a {{thriving}} industrial and supply center. In 1894, naturalist Vernon Bailey passed through and described Great Falls as [...] "a very good town, appears prosperous and booming & I should judge contains 15000 inhabitants." [...] By the early 1900s, Great Falls was en route to becoming one of Montana's largest cities. The rustic studio of famed Western artist Charles Marion Russell was a popular attraction, as were the famed [...] "Great Falls of the Missouri", after which the city was named. A structure billed as the [...] "world's tallest smokestack" [...] was completed in 1908 by the city's largest employer, the Anaconda Copper Mining Company's smelter, measuring [...] tall. The Big Stack immediately became a landmark for the community. The Big Stack's 'sister' stack in Anaconda was suffering from cracking and {{it was decided to}} remove the support bands from the upper half of the Big Stack and send them to Anaconda. This action proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Stack's ultimate demise since the cracks it suffered from rapidly worsened. Citing public safety concerns due to the stack's continual deterioration of its structural integrity it was slated for demolition on September 18, 1982. In an interesting twist of fate the demolition crew failed to accomplish the task on the first try; the two worst cracks in the stack ran from just above ground level to nearly 300 feet up. As the 600lbs of explosives were set off (which was to create a wedge in the base so it would fall almost vertically into a large trench for the rubble) the cracks 'completed themselves' {{all the way to the}} ground—effectively severing the stack into two-thirds and one-third pieces. Much to the delight of the spectating community, the smaller of the two pieces remained standing, but the failed demolition only solidified the safety issue whereas the community cited the event as the stack's defiance. The demolition team who had planted the charges was recalled and several hours later they returned and finished the demolition, after packing another 400lbs of explosives into the smaller wedge.|$|E

60|$|Cowhide {{had none}} of the soft, {{yielding}} qualities of buckskin, and hurt the Indian's feet. Sitting down, he pulled one off, not without difficulty, for the boots were wet; {{but he could not}} remove the other. He hesitated a moment, being aware of the subdued merriment of his comrades, and then held up his foot to the nearest one. This chanced <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> Indian, who evidently had a keen sense of humor. Taking hold of the boot with both hands, he dragged the luckless brave entirely around the camp-fire. The fun, however, was not to be all one-sided. The big Indian gave a more strenuous pull, and the boot came off suddenly. Unprepared for this, he lost his balance and fell down the bank almost into the creek. He held on to the boot, nevertheless, and getting up, threw it into the fire.|$|E
6000|$|He saw Gertie {{two hours}} after he had reached Joralemon for a week's stay before going north. They sat in rockers on the grass beside her stoop. They were embarrassed, and rocked profusely and chattily. Mrs. Cowles was {{surprised}} and not much pleased to find him, but Gertie murmured {{that she had been}} lonely, and Carl felt that he must be nobly patient under Mrs. Cowles's slight. He got so far as to sigh, [...] "O Gertie!" [...] but grew frightened, as though he were binding himself for life. He wished that Gertie were not wearing so many combs stuck all over her pompadoured hair. He noted that his rocker creaked at the joints, and thought out a method of strengthening it by braces. She bubbled that he was going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Man in his class. He said, [...] "Aw, rats!" [...] and felt that his collar was too tight.... He went home. His father remarked that Carl was late for supper, that he had been extravagant in Plato, and that he was unlikely to make money out of [...] "all this runnin' races." [...] But his mother stroked his hair and called him her big boy.... He tramped out to Bone Stillman's shack, impatient for the hand-clasp of the pioneer, and grew eloquent, {{for the first time since}} his home-coming, as he described Professor Frazer and the delights of poesy. A busy week Carl had in Joralemon. Adelaide Benner gave a porch-supper for him. They sat under the trees, laughing, while in the dimly lighted street bicycles whirred, and box-elders he had always known whispered that this guest of honor was Carl Ericson, come home a hero.|$|E
